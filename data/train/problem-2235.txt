"You must admit that there is a possibility that he is actually sick and not possessed. If so, then maybe we can do something to help him. "
"But I'm leaving"
"I think you have secrets Mr. Watson. Until I know more, you will stay here. As my guest", he turned back to the exit.
Colum blocked my exit.
"He had his hands on the woman's breasts," added the slimy lying liar.
"I was wondering what was the most appropriate dosage, how much do you take?"
As soon as I regained consciousness, I found myself tied to the wheel of one of our wagons, obviously with my butt in the mud. I began to feel the blows received, a twinge in my stomach made me think that there would probably be big bruises on my abdomen, my face was almost certainly covered in blood and soon my right eye would have swollen and become purple.
"Listen to me, you're going to break my arm. You have to indent the bone in the right position before you put it back into the joint. "
"Yeah!" He snorted, almost disappointed by the girl's intrusion.
"Are you referring to Inverness? You're looking at it. "
"John? You do not want to wear those rags for the ceremony?! "I automatically looked at my clothes, certainly not much.
So telling her, she began to open a wooden box, which she pulled out of an old bench. It was probably something he cared about particularly, and that he feared someone could take her away.
"I have the impression that his ancestor could have a protector, someone who could protect him from the censorship of superiors," declared the Reverend.
"I can beat an English jacket only with one hand, and then I would have you put it back to me," she whispered to my ear with that deep voice of hers, which startled me.
"Are you asking me if I have been faithful to you?! Really Frank? "I began to wander about the room, unable to look him in the eye.
I could see a doubtful look in his eyes and I could feel that he had guessed something. My eyes fell on the bag of provisions fallen at my feet. Dougal did a lot more. As he bent down to pick it up, I grabbed a stool and threw it on his head, causing him to fall unconscious on the floor.
"He needs rest," I yelled at him.
At midnight they played the Campa and Frank said he wanted to set the alarm.
"Yes, it must be clean from dirt and germs."
The ritual lasted until the sunrise and when the women moved away from the circle of stones, Frank and I approached to see them more closely. Soon after that we decided to go back to the city.
Sherlock at those points approached me slowly. His eyes were getting sick and when he was close enough, he began to move his arms around me. With the wet cloth he began to clean the wounds with extreme care. A little 'for the cold a bit' for the discomfort I began to tremble. Sherlock, having noticed my trembling, took my clothes and dressed me carefully.
"In the twentieth century it did not seem changed much. Last night I heard the bartender in the pub turn to us calling Saxons "I remarked to the reverend that he answered immediately chuckling under his mustache.
"Are you ready John, are you ready for me?!" and so it happened after so many years and a long time apart, Frank was back with me in my arms. At first it seemed that he was afraid to hurt me, but soon after his thrusts sped up, as well as our breath and the squeaking of the bed.
"Go, I do not want to hold you back. There are women waiting for you. Take the wine and share it with your friends. "
"I know you're awake, Saxon," he said with a half-laugh.
"You said enough, you bastard." He grabbed my arm vigorously and yanked me to where Dougal's men were. Then he gently kicked me on his side, making me fall to the ground at Dougal's feet.
"I'm afraid so!", At that moment Larye appeared and waited behind a corner.
"Then who the hell are you?"
"Wait here." I went back to the clinic to get an ampoule of horse dung, harmless except for the smell. Sherlock would not have noticed. I took my belongings and went back to Leary.
At those points Dougal had obviously misunderstood. It did not take long before I felt a punch in the face, then the kicks also came. Even if bent over myself I managed to grab his leg and tug it, until he fell back on the ground. I also began to fill it with punches, but without realizing behind me someone hit me violently at the head making me fall to the floor unconscious.
"And now I know it too. Why did you tell me? "
"Mrs. Hudson told me I would find you below. I hope I did not disturb you."
"The Beaton clans are famous throughout Scotland for being excellent healers. We had one some time ago. Until a bad fever has taken him away. David Beaton was his name and this was his surgery, as he called him".
"I have to go Frank. You know as much as I did that it was only a matter of time before I decided to leave, "I looked him in the eye with a thread of sadness.
I leaned over him, disengaging the belt he had around his shoulder and kicking his shirt I saw a gunshot wound.
"I come from you as a consanguineous and ally. But I will not give you any votes. Because I have already solemnly sworn on the name I carry. I give you my obedience, as my kinsman and my lord. I consider myself bound by your will, until my feet rest on the territory of Clan MacKenzie. "
“Ahem.”
John pulled Sherlock back in and kissed him again. Sherlock wrapped his lanky arms around the other man and pulled him in close. John’s hips jostled against Sherlock’s and Sherlock groaned. “I thought- Shut up,” John interrupted, kissing him again.
A voice greeted Rosie with much warmth. It made Sherlock smile and John growl.
"Sherlock," John said. Usually, when Sherlock was focused, everything else was blurry and out of focus but John was always clear. Even before they... started dating. Every time he thought of John as his boyfriend, he smiled. It made him so happy to finally be with John, the love of his life.
over the past few months but he still wore it. Therefore, he still had feelings for Lucy but was coming to terms about his divorce. "Five years," Mike said. "When we found out she was pregnant, well, that was kind of the push we needed," he said.
“Think about it. The children want to go with one parent but the other parent wins. They’re upset and decide to get revenge,” he said.
John rubbed his thumb over Sherlock's knuckles. "I do," he muttered. That was the first time he'd said that to Sherlock. But it was in the worst possible way. Sherlock wished John could've worded it differently so images of the wedding wouldn't come rushing back but he didn't and they came. God, why couldn't he have had a case and not been able to go? Wouldn't it hurt less then? Or would it hurt more because he wouldn't get to see John for one last time?
"Saul is four, and Adam is three," he said, counting his sons' ages off on his fingers.
Sherlock set a hand on Mike's arm. "It's okay. Just tell me what you know," he said.
“He’s a nice boy. Not the brightest,” Mycroft observed.
Sherlock sighed and looked at the kitchen clock. “An hour. Just like I said thirty seconds ago,” he muttered.
John's hand traveled to Sherlock's other testicle. "Alright," he said casually. "Can we fill it out here?" he asked.
“Oh yes,” Sherlock whined and began to whine as John pushed a second finger in.
John smirked. He stroked Sherlock’s pulsing cock and pulled at his bollocks. John decided to make Sherlock come. He smacked Sherlock’s thighs. “How does it feel when I hit you?” He asked.
Sherlock thrusted again and John forgot all about his lip. He moaned and clawed at the desk. He felt his orgasm curl up in his stomach and moaned. “Sher... Sherlock...” He warned. Sherlock pressed hot kisses all the way down John’s neck and rolled his hips into John again. He thrusted with an unmeasured power and John nearly exploded.
“Papa, when will Lily be here?” Hamish asked.
I'll be at the police station, Lestrade texted, along with the address.
Tim nodded, thanked John again, wished him a Merry Christmas, and raced home.
Sherlock moaned as John’s hips ground into his. He loved when John was dominant; it reminded Sherlock of how his very own boyfriend used to be in the army.
”Yes, oh yes. John, YES! GO, PLEASE, OH,” Sherlock moaned.
Rosie and Tim went to fetch Hamish and Lily. “Hanish, Lily, dinner is ready,” Rosie said as she opened the door. As she entered the bedroom, she was nearly hit with a flying toy soldier. She squealed and hid in Tim’s arms. Tim held her. “What was it?” he asked.
"You'll have to come see," Lestrade said with a grin. He used to grin at Sherlock like that. Sherlock quickly shook that thought away and grabbed his coat.
Sherlock smirked. He leaned down and kissed John’s ear. “I’m going to fuck you until the only thoughts you have are of me and my delicious cock,” He growled, thrusting again.
John nodded. He closed his book and zipped up his coat. "Sherlock? Will you come?" he asked.
Sherlock examined the sides of John’s head. He’d crashed into the wall and Sherlo k had landed on top of him. “Are you okay?” He asked worriedly.
Sherlock nodded. “I know. It’s just a bit tiresome.”
Everton Hostel was a nice building. Maybe less than The Shankly Hotel or Hope Street Hotel but it was still nice. Sherlock and John waited in a cafe across the street, watching and listening for anyone going or going out that matched their killer and accomplice.
She’d gotten Greg a silver ring with the bisexual flag on the underside, so he could wear it to work but still show his pride. The man had no pride wear whatsoever and Rosie had been determined to change that.
John opened his eyes and smirked. “Don’t start.”
John’s hand rubbed Sherlock’s arse until a warm feeling sprouted in Sherlock's erection, as if it knew he was going to be pleased in a few moments. Sherlock inhaled and waited for John’s spanks.
The cab ride was both heaven and hell. Sherlock felt so at peace with John beside him but then again, he felt anxious because of the kiss and if that meant John still had feelings for him. It was all too confusing. Finally, they made it back to London and John insisted they stop at Baker Street first.
John began to protest but Sherlock stuck out his lip and John gave in to defeat. “Fine,” he said.
Sherlock groaned and shook with pleasure. “Yes...” Sherlock moaned. He reached up to bite John’s lip and collapsed back into the pillows.
Sherlock’s moan caught in his throat and he pinned John back onto the ground. He kissed him and entered him slowly. John’s eyes popped open and he gasped. “
A moment later, they were each asleep, naked and both very satisfied.
John glanced over at Sherlock. He was standing over his microscope replacing one of the slides. He looked up and caught John’s eye. Sherlock smirked and placed the slide on the table. He advanced towards John. John made no attempt to move; Sherlock guided him. Sherlock backed John up into the table. He bit his lip and pouted. “I don’t feel good, Doctor,” Sherlock said.
“Is that your answer?
It came down on his left cheek, hard. The hot flash of pain made Sherlock yelp. The next hit landed on Sherlock’s left cheek again, nearly the exact spot the first spank had landed. Sherlock bit his lip as the third spank came. John gave him one whip for every second he was too slow.
John started when he felt Sherlock enter him. He was fully inside him and he moaned. John had never felt so full.
Lestrade was looking down at his notes as Sherlock and John shared their moment. John took this opportunity to do the thing that his head had been nagging him to do since he and Sherlock had sit down. His hand slipped from Sherlock’s and traveled over his thigh to his zipper.
“For a divorce case?” John asked.
Sherlock smirked and bit his lip. “Oh yeah? And why do you think that?” He teased.
"So, where exactly in Liverpool is she?" John asked.
,” He moaned.
John grinned and began to slowly, teasingly, pull his hips away from Sherlock’s. When he was just barely inside Sherlock, he slammed forwards. Sherlock cried out and scratched his nails along the table. “John, yes,” he moaned.
His purple shirt confirmed it, what with its near to bursting buttons and tight sleeves. Sherlock’s posture also confirmed it. He kept walking around, tossing his head back to stare at John, resting his hands on his hips, and pursing his lips.
John kicked them off and took care of his shirt.
Sherlock shot up and grabbed John’s wrist. “John, you can’t tell her he can’t come over now,” Sherlock said.
John smirked and slammed into Sherlock. The impact was surely going to leave marks on both of their skin but neither man cared. All they cared about was whatever was happening at the moment.
"Okay," Sherlock said and sealed the deal with a kiss. John smiled against his lips.
John bit Sherlock’s ear and tugged gently. “Tell me how you feel,” he ordered.
“I’ll follow,” he said. Lestrade nodded and left.
John turned and nearly collapsed. His arse hurt like hell and his legs were made of jelly. He fell into Sherlock and panted. Sherlock looked down at him. “Told you,” He heaved.
John rolled his hips against Sherlock’s and smirked when the man moaned and begged for him. “
"Please call me Mike," he said, hoping a bit of friendliness would ease the tension.
Sherlock moaned and his body shook. Sweat trailed down the back of his neck. He bit his lip and squeezed his legs around John’s.
“Okay. Can you come in with me? I don’t want to go in alone,” they said.
John smirked and thrusted. His erection made contact with Sherlock’s and the detective moaned. “
John recognized Sherlock’s mood and did nothing to acknowledge it. Sooner or later, Sherlock would bring it to attention and then the both of them would most likely end up tangled up together, either on the floor, or in Sherlock’s bed.
John smirked. He caged Sherlock’s legs with his thighs, pinning Sherlock to the bed. “Brilliant idea, Soldier,” he growled. He licked just below Sherlock’s ear.
Sherlock tugged at John’s trousers. “Both,” He cheated.
When he was slippery with lube, John readjusted the younger man on top of him and grabbed his waist. He let his hands trail down Sherlock’s back, down to his arse. He took a good squeeze and Sherlock gasped. “John,” He groaned, his voice thick with lust and passion.
Sherlock tried to sit up but was shoved back down by John.
"Mike," Lestrade said. "You were one of Mrs. Wayne's clients, yes?" The man nodded. "And you were fighting for custody of your two children, yes?"
Sherlock and John broke apart to see their daughter standing in the doorway. She was wearing a pretty white jumper and black leggings.
John smirked. He threw Sherlock’s leg over his head. It didn’t take that much effort, as Sherlock was extremely flexible. He kissed the inside of Sherlock’s thighs, biting gently. His tongue glided across Sherlock’s skin.
Sherlock pulled his pants off and stood. His erection stood and screamed for attention.
“Sherlock. I...” John stopped talking when Sherlock kissed him. His lips were soft and wet. They were so kissable and John
“I love you too,” Sherlock said, feeling his heart- and cock- swell.
Sherlock hadn't exactly been expecting so many studies. Sure, fecal bacteria was a controversial thing in Sherlock's small web circle, but still, there were a lot of studies. It had taken him quite a bit of time to read all of them and process them. Some of them were so drastically impossible that it hurt Sherlock to read them.
Mycroft nodded stiffly, and Greg smiled. “Hi,” was all Tim said. He turned back to Rosie’s parents. “Mr. Holmes,” Tim began. “Rosie’s told me all about you,” he said to Sherlock. “And Mr. Holmes,” Tim said, looking over at John. “It’s a pleasure to meet a true hero.”
He got Mike to talk. Maybe it'll work on her too," Lestrade said.
Sherlock stared, eyes staying locked with Mike's. "Mike. Tell me everything," he said softly, leaning forward.
Sherlock was biting his lip and he thrusted into John. John loved the way Sherlock looked at him. He looked at John like he was a god. He thought Sherlock looked just like a Greek God with his slender frame and dark hair. Sherlock thrusted again and John moaned. He rested his head on the wall and let Sherlock do his work.
John kissed his neck. “I love you too. Now, hush and get some sleep,” He replied.
John turned to Tim. The boy started to apologize. “Ah, shh,” John said. Tim shut his mouth. “It’s okay,” John said. “You make her happy. I approve,” John said.
Tim grinned. “Thank you sir.”
He pulled Sherlock’s pants and down and saw his erection. It was long and wet with precum. Sherlock bit his lip as John trailed his finger down Sherlock’s hard shaft. “
"Who won custody?" Lestrade asked.
"Yes," John defended. "You were spending a lot of time on it and not with me," he said.
Sherlock leaned his head back so John had more room to play with his skin. John smirked against his skin and continued to kiss Sherlock’s neck. He sucked just below Sherlock’s Adam’s Apple, making the man whimper.
Sherlock smiled over at John. “That was bloody brilliant, Doctor,” He said.
John smiled back. “Now get on home before you catch a cold too,” John said.
“Yes, Dr. Watson!” Sherlock exclaimed.
John said. “I do hope I didn’t hurt you,” he said. Sherlock shook his head. “Good. Because we have a little problem,” John said. Sherlock cocked his head but understood when John shifted his hips. His erection pushed through his trousers, grazing Sherlock’s thigh.
Sherlock nodded. “In your drawers,” He said. He crawled over to John’s nights and and rummaged around until he found the lube. He grabbed it and thrusted it into John’s hands.
Rosie had even gotten John a book on his favorite band, Queen. John held the book close and Rosie closer as he thanked her, giving her forehead a kiss.
“I still have my pants on.”
“Yes, Doctor,” Sherlock said.
The pair had been called in to talk about their witnessing of a carjacker. Neither of them thought it was extremely necessary, as they hadn’t even gotten a clear view of his face, but Lestrade figured Sherlock had a few ideas about him.
Sherlock smiled. “You look so beautiful,” he said.
Lestrade chuckled. "I could've told you that," he said.
John took his other hand and grabbed Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock’s eyes widened and he bit his lip. “How do you feel?” John asked. His smirk was cruel as he twisted Sherlock’s nipple.
Sherlock smiled. "I want to help," he said, trying to sound innocent.
Sherlock nodded. “I can prove it, if you’d like.”
“Why not?” John demanded.
- gorgeous.
Sherlock pulled away and set the riding crop on John’s chest. He drew it up to his neck. He slapped John’s cheek and then smacked the other.
John ripped off his red shirt and threw it to the ground. He clambered onto the bed and climbed up to Sherlock. He took his pants into his mouth and pulled. The black elastic was easily pulled and they came straight down. Sherlock’s erection stood up and John grinned. “Hello there,” He said. He set one hand on Sherlock’s thigh and let his touch tickle Sherlock. He twitched and reached down to grab his cock. John grabbed his wrist and pinned it to the bed. Sherlock wasn’t getting off that easily. He smirked up at Sherlock and advanced.
Sherlock nodded, then saw the look in John's eyes. "Why?"
The barrage of spanks came down in a matter of seconds. Sherlock kicked and squirmed, trying to wrench from John’s iron tight grip but everything proved to be unsuccessful. He laid there, moaning and trembling. Sweat dripped down his brow as he shook. “
Sherlock hesitated to answer, which only made John angrier. He pinched Sherlock’s skin, right where his thigh met his arse. “Answer me!” he demanded.
John looked up at Sherlock. "Thank you?" he repeated. "Sherlock?" John looked his boyfriend over and noticed the signs. Well, the signs and the tent in his dark trousers.
John pulled out and laid against Sherlock’s back. The detective was hot and sweaty and not at all comfortable. John petted Sherlock’s curls as the man recovered from his orgasm. “You alright?” he asked.
Sherlock turned away so John couldn't see the little smile that he had. God, how badly he wished he could tell the cabbie to drive to Baker Street and push John inside.
“Please?”
“My wife," he clarified. "She was a good mother and an even better friend so when she asked for a divorce I was a bit shocked but eventually understood."
Sherlock nodded. "What was she stabbed with?" he asked.
John’s eyes widened. “Really?” he asked.
John raised an eyebrow. “Do you like the feel of my hand on your cock?” He growled.
Sherlock was standing in his doorway. His black shirt and pants blended into the darkness of the office. “Sherlock?” John asked. Sherlock advanced and swung John’s seat around. He pinned his hands to the arm rests of his chair and licked his lips. “Sherlock...” John repeated, his breath uneven.
Sherlock nodded.
“Are you... Clean?” John asked, not meaning to insult Sherlock.
“Sherlock. I swear if you kick that ball one more time, I’m going to lock you in your room and guard the door,” John threatened.
Sherlock cried out as John thrusted into him. It felt so good to have the man inside him. John was so powerful and
John teased Sherlock. He acted as if he was thinking and shook his head.
John pulled his phone out. "I've got to call Mary," he said. He put his phone up to his ear and waited for the sound of his wife's voice. Sherlock listened to John's answers and statements. "Yeah, yeah, Mary. I'm going to be out late. Yes, it's for a case. I shouldn't be back until tomorrow." There was a break in his speaking. And, with the next thing he said, Sherlock felt his eyes sting. "I love you too."
naughty,” John said, kissing Sherlock’s ear. “But don’t worry. I’ll straighten you out.”
“Think you’re loose enough now?” John asked. Sherlock shook his head eagerly but John clicked his tongue as he crooked his fingers in Sherlock’s arse. “I don’t think so. But don’t worry, I’ll loosen you up in no time.”
Sherlock smirked and closed John’s door. He twisted the riding crop in his hands. “It’s me, John. Do you like my outfit?” He asked.
John took hold of Sherlock by his hair and turned them around, so Sherlock was up against the table. “Like this?” John asked.
Sherlock turned and smiled. “You’re cleaned up now,” he said to John, motioning to his husband’s creamless face.
John's answer went straight to Sherlock's heart. "Because I love you," he said.
Mycroft nodded. He looked at his brother and cocked an eyebrow. Sherlock nodded. Mycroft settled down then.
,” Sherlock moaned.
“And happy new year,” Greg said.
Sherlock huffed. Surely this would be simple. He attempted to pull from John’s grasp but he was unsuccessful. “Fine, John, you win,” Sherlock said.
name,” He growled.
By the eighth spank, Sherlock was certain his arse was red. He tried to squirm away as the ninth spank made contact with his skin but John’s arm wrapped around his neck. “No, no, you asked for this,” he growled. “You wanted this,” John reminded him. Sherlock bit his lip as John’s hand grazed his erection. He prepared himself for the last slap, both dreading and wishing for it. John’s belt whipped Sherlock one final time, making Sherlock yelp and moan.
“I'm sorry, Sherlock," John said. His eyes were hurt and sorrowful. His heart was broken too. Sherlock wished he could up the pieces and put it back together, just so he wouldn't be sad. So he'd be happy with Mary.
John chuckled and let Sherlock go. Sherlock pivoted and went to grab John but the older man was too prepared. He grabbed Sherlock and shoved him against the wall with incredible force. His left hand pinned Sherlock’s hand to the wall and his other hand was over Sherlock’s throat. He was careful not to choke the man though.
Sherlock moaned and looked down at John’s trousers. They were bulging and Sherlock noticed how they seemed near to bursting. He fingered John’s trousers until he managed to find the zipper. He unzipped them.
"My laptop?"
,” He moaned.
“Sherlock.”
“So, Tim,” John said.
John shook his head playfully. "She doesn't make my decisions, you know," he said.
“Her sister is the murderer," he said.
Sherlock nodded. He looked at Lestrade, telling him he was finished.
John’s hands trailed down Sherlock’s back. They squeezed his arse, making the man on top of him moan.
“So, Mr. Holland," Lestrade began.
Sherlock shifted his hips and John moaned. His bare stomach was up against the wood and his skin was covered in goosebumps. Sherlock’s warm fingers tickled John’s neck.
Sherlock nodded. “Lots. I need treatment,” He said.
”I told you last night I was going to get you back for that little stunt you did on Valentine’s Day. I guess I did,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock pushed up. His erection slid farther in John’s mouth. John’s tongue lapped at it, sending an intoxicating feeling of desire through Sherlock. It spread through his body, all the way up to his chest.
"Most likely one or two hours. Depends on how crowded the plane station is," Sherlock said.
Sherlock shook his head but John was already in too deep. He twisted Sherlock’s sensitive nub and watched as his erection leaked more precum. John gave his erection a soft squeeze and Sherlock moaned. “
"What, have you got something?" John asked.
John ran his hands up Sherlock’s back, up to his dark curls. He took a handful and yanked back.
John was now standing with his hands on the table, head hanging low. Sherlock shook his head and inhaled, expelling all the thoughts from his head. He stood behind John and wrapped his arms around him. John sighed in his arms and relaxed. Sherlock smiled. "Are you okay?" he asked.
!” He arched up and clawed at the wall.
John turned to look at her over his seat.
Sherlock smiled for the first time in weeks. Finally, he had something to think about other than... him. Sherlock closed his computer and stepped over the table, crushing the newest paper. He looked out the window, taking in the clouds and sunbeams. He looked down, watching all the meaningless people stroll by. He wondered who they all were. He walked away before he began deducing.
John glanced down at his watch again. "Yes. God, it's nerve-racking," he said.
Tim grinned. “I’d like to join Scotland Yard, like Mr. Lestrade,” he said.
None of the other questions were deal breakers. In fact, Mike hadn't revealed anything negative about Lucy or Mrs. Wayne. Sherlock still felt off and asked to talk to Lestrade and John in private. The three men left the room, shutting the door behind them so that Mike could not hear.
"Foster Street, Lestrade said.
John’s cock tingled and he shivered. Sherlock smirked and pulled John’s chair closer to him. “I missed you,” He growled. John’s penis hardened as Sherlock spoke. “Did you forget about me?” He asked, whispering in John’s ear.
The secretary opened a binder. "On business," she read and closed the binder.
“Oh, they’re fine. My mom is just worried I’ve picked something dangerous,” Tim explained.
Sherlock unzipped his trousers and pulled them down a bit, just enough to leave room for his erection to slip through. He pulled down his pants, pulled his shirt up to his shoulders, and shifted behind John’s arse, deducing the best way to enter him.
Sherlock knelt down and pulled at the elastic surrounding John’s bulge. John moaned as Sherlock fingered his erection through his pants. Sherlock stood and let John grasp onto him.
John wrapped his hands around Sherlock’s neck as he continued kissing him. Sherlock pulled John right out of his seat and he had to stand on his toes in order to reach Sherlock’s lips. He rolled his hips into John’s and he moaned. The detective’s large erection made John’s own cock harden until he was bulging through his trousers. “Sherl...” His breath caught in his throat when Sherlock pushed him backwards into his desk.
“So, Tim,” John said. “How’d you meet Rosie?”
Lestrade nodded and explained the details of the case. "She was stabbed multiple times in the chest. Her assailant is believed to be her husband, Christopher Wayne," Lestrade said.
,“ He begged. John smirked again and thrusted. Sherlock’s moan made his cock twitch again.
Sherlock moaned and his back arched as John slid in. John was fully inside him, wet and ready. Sherlock moaned again and begged for John to hurry. “
Anderson looked taken aback for a moment before shutting his mouth and glaring at Lestrade. He gave a stiff nod and stalked off.
“Excited to start are we?” He teased. John shivered as Sherlock stood back up and kissed his neck. “Don’t worry, we’ll get started soon,” He whispered.
“So, your punishment,” John began. “A spanking, perhaps?” he said. His voice was deep and thick.
John chuckled. “Oh, yeah.
Sherlock smirked and stepped away from John. He quickly unbuttoned his shirt and dropped it on the ground. He pulled his belt from his trousers and slipped out of them. He went to pull his trousers down when he looked up at John. He wasn’t sure if he was supposed to take his pants off as well.
Sassonach
"Then he is not a gentman, after all!" chuckled one of the men.
The next day I went looking for Sherlock, to make a new dressing to his arm and after hearing from Mrs. Hudson that I would find him in the stables, I started in the direction indicated to me, outside the castle.
"Of course, when you get angry you become very charming." Yes, definitely he was making fun of me.
"Yeah baby".
"N-no, would not I say why?"
"I-I suppose if the bandage really was unbearable, you could have snatched it at any time," I added with a smile as I looked at the tall, magnificent figure of Holmes, at the reflection of the fire in the large fireplace.
"You will come with us on a journey," he announced casually, while I still could not understand what he was saying.
He pulled out a small ceramic jar. Inside was a thick cream that looked like honey, but if you sniffed carefully it released a scent of wild herbs and whiskey.
When the woman did as I told her, the child began to eat eagerly. I smiled confidently at the woman, who continued to thank me repeatedly with tears streaming down her face.
"The bone came out you can't ride in these conditions."
"John Watson" I answered convinced.
"I'm well indeed. I don't need any blanket "I announced in my teeth.
"You must put hot gauzes on it every day. Well how do you feel? "I asked for the shoulder.
"How much appetite," I exclaimed, watching him.
"I did not do much, I would have sincerely aimed to have done more."
"Now I have to go," Holmes broke the silence.
When I got to the living room, I stood by the big fireplace, on the side lines. I did not want to be seen, I just wanted the evening to end quickly. When Sherlock entered the hall, a deep silence resounded, and then I glimpsed Dougal walking past his brother. Sherlock knelt at the feet of the Uncle.
"I am captain Jim Moriarty commander of His Majesty's Dragoons Battalion, at your service!" in front of me was Frank's ancestor and this was literally impossible. The panic made me start running again and the soldier was right behind me. He grabbed my arm and threw me on a rock pointing my sword to my throat.
"It's my interest in effect!" I found myself looking around, amidst ampoules, books and herbs.
The men behind him, blocking my way, staggered away from the banquet downstairs.
"N-no, what are you saying? It's just that I do not want to go back and forth from the kitchen every time. "
"Thank you, then I'll boil it in the future. Well ... I would still like to talk to you about Victor, but I still have to finish preparing some things for the hunt. "
"I apologize, Mr. Watson"
Chapters 2
"No instead!" I turned a worried look at Mrs. Hudson. "They shot him! I wrapped the wound but I could not clean it properly, I have to treat it before it gets infected ", the lady looked at me puzzled, to which I hastened to correct myself.
"You should not be here, Saxon!" he said, looking at me, perplexed.
"But this is not Rhine wine ?!"
"You're too charming John Watson. If you do not stop, I risk losing myself in your deep blue eyes. "
"He can leave when he wants the punishment is over. But he has not yet found the courage to tear his ear from the nail, "he said as he adjusted the saddle.
"I think someone wants to talk to you ?!" I smiled and waved to him to talk.
"First Lord you must tell me how you call and what you do around here."
The old man turned a suspicious look at me and squared me.
"From what I understand the castle of Liocke was the ancestral abode of the MacKenzie clan until the mid-nineteenth century" Frank was reading about some of his notes he had taken in the library.
This trip was turning out to be more boring than any other trip I had ever done before.
Sherlock had approached me with a bowl of hare stew, I accepted it even though I did not even eat a bite.
"Lily of the valley, ah," Holmes repeated with a half-smile. "Never heard before".
"That child is dying because of the poison not of the devil and if you do not allow me to care, he will not make it."
"You look good, so now you've torn your muscles too"
"At the village" admitted hesitating. It was the first thing that occurred to me.
(See the end of the chapter for
The meeting
"All night and I imagine even that after," he answered by grasping the reins of the horse and starting to ride.
"I hope it was not a problem".
Leary nodded.
"No really, I would not say. I told you what happened to me in Fort William. Well you have to know that I could not stand up from the pain and I had a fever for the wounds. So, some friends have found a way to get me out, since I had not done anything. Going away there was a bit of confusion, and a red jacket died. "
The first wounded arrived shortly, the boar had pierced a young man's leg. I wrapped it up and had it brought back to the castle as soon as possible. Another harrowing scream echoed through the woods and I ran to meet him without thinking twice. When I found the Man lying on the ground in Dougal's arms, I bent down to see the wounds. The gash in the leg had not severed the femoral artery there was a good chance it could survive, but when I looked closer, I saw that it had a deep cut in the abdomen and with that I was sure it would not survive so I looked into Dougal's eyes he knew immediately that he would not make it. We waited there until the man breathed his last breath.
"Yes sir, give my thanks to my brother for having me, so kindly escorted", make the fake smile I could do.
When we dismounted, an old lady came to meet us, and she began to hug and greet all the men.
"How come you can never do what you're told without making a fuss?" He asked with a smile on his face.
"Mr. Holmes his fingers are strong enough I suppose ?!"
"So why?" I insisted.
It was a popular legend madness to interpret it as a reality. Yet half of what told the story to me really happened. Why could not the part in which the woman returned home also come true? I remembered Victor's words: "As I told you there are many things in this world that we cannot explain".
"I do not know if you are or not. I just say it would be better to leave Sherlock quiet during the rally. "
Hello everyone. I wanted to thank all those who have and are reading this story. But I'd like to know what you think about it for now. Let me know and see the next chapter.
"Sherlock did you hear what he said?! You need treatment. " So saying, she dragged me by the arm towards the castle. Mrs. Hudson helped me to boil some herbs to be able to heal Sherlock's wound, and after thanking her, we stayed alone in the rooms.
"I suppose it's every gesture against the arrogance of the English," he declared with a veil of arrogance in his voice. I knew he wanted to say more, so I waited for him to continue talking while I continued my work.
"There is a great quiet here, it is not at all as I expected it", I admitted aloud admiring the ivy-covered ruins.
(> - <)
That evening I decided to stay in my room, I did not want the looks mixed with amazement and suspicion, which now seems to follow me everywhere. It only fueled my sense of discomfort with the situation in which I was finished. I was tasked with what was called "a miracle" and instead of granting me freedom, it had made me even more a prisoner. Even if I could get back to the stone circle, I could not be sure it worked. I could have gone further back in time. What persuaded me to leave my room was the oblivion promised by Colum's Rhine wine.
"The blanket will keep us warm, but I can't keep her. You keep it. " I then grabbed a flap of the blanket to wrap it around my shoulders.
"My men told me they had found you in a state of apparent confusion"
"Why did you escape the first time?" Even to my ears sounded a pretty stupid question.
"L-the ceremony? P-I thought a foreigner was not welcome to such an important event. "
"Can you make me the bathroom no?" I felt that my face was blushing but with the low light that enveloped us, I hoped that Frank would not notice it.
"Thank you!" I said sincerely. So, I took my leave and wandered around the castle, thoughtful. Arriving on the walls that led towards the inner courtyard.
"They do not trust, that's why they exclude you. Dougal definitely hates you, but he hates everyone. "
"It is said that Satan is clever, he would not attach many naive souls if he would tend his traps in swamps and caves."
Before I could do anything, I felt someone grab me vigorously and push me against the castle wall. It was Dougal, from the smell of alcohol I knew that he too must be drunk.
"T-you're not Frank"
I thought the intrusion of Mrs. Hudson would have ruined my plans, but then I realized that with her by my side as an escort, my shadows would have been less attentive to my movements in the castle. I had to let them relax and enjoy their festivities, since I would have to distract them later. We took a seat on the balcony on the first floor overlooking the hall, when they began to play the bagpipes at Colum's appearance at the main door.
"Watch out for what you say English you could regret it."
Sherlock gave a half smile.
"Mmm?"
"You can't use it for two or three days, you don't have to move it. When you resume using it, move it slowly at the beginning "As I spoke I was tying him around his arm and shoulder the belt so he could stop him better.
I looked around and saw Mr. Holmes kiss Miss Leary, Mr. Holmes noticed my gaze and I hastened to turn it off. When my escort reappeared, he took me to the surgery.
John looked at Greg's door. The man would be coming back any moment now. "Let's make a deal," he said. "I take it easy on you, and you don't come?" John offered.
Sherlock swallowed a gasp and coughed. "Are you okay?" Greg asked, a bit startled by Sherlock's coughing.
Sherlock pushed John’s chair away and trailed his hands down his lover’s back. He reached his arse and tugged at John’s trousers. He pulled his trousers down low enough to reveal his gray pants and he smirked. “I like your pants,” He flirted.
He exited Sherlock and collapsed onto the mattress beside him. Sherlock panted and John went to go get a towel. He cleaned himself up and handed it to Sherlock. He wiped up the cum on his stomach and cock. He tossed the towel away and pulled John close. They kissed and Sherlock smiled. “Goodnight John,” He said, his voice strangled from moaning and swearing.
John looked back at the body. "The wounds are different sizes," he said.
Sweat dropped down Sherlock’s body as he gripped John’s neck. He‘d pulled himself up and was now sitting on John. Sherlock threw his head back as John thrusted up into him. “
”Mine,” Sherlock said. Sherlock had a bigger bed anyways.
Feeling John come sent Sherlock over the edge he was already teetering on. He quickly pulled out and came. His orgasm covered the floor and John’s hips. Sherlock panted and collapsed onto the floor beside John. He looked over at the other man and smiled. “Carry me,” He ordered.
Rosie giggled. “Your mom is very overprotective,” she said.
John moaned as Sherlock pushed his erection on his own again. Sherlock pulled away and pursed his lips together. He let his eyes glide down John’s strong body. He landed on his erection and saw it was bulging through his pants. He licked his lips again and looked up at John. The man was breathing heavily and was obviously craving Sherlock’s touch.
“I- I have a question,” she said.
Unconsciously, he bucked against it. John’s hands stilled him. “Not yet, sweetheart. Not yet. First, we’re going to have a little fun,” John said.
“What?” Sherlock asked.
“Yes, of course,” John said.
John glanced down at his boyfriend’s length. “I can’t wait to fuck you,” he growled and Sherlock’s cock dripped.
“I love it,” Tim said.
But the one thing that took him an eternity to process was what happened when he looked up.
Sherlock hid in his bedroom, plopping into the bed and relaxing. Hamish has been pestering him for the past 48 hours asking when his cousin would be there for their Christmas party. He’d barely gotten a word in. He understood what John had suffered through now.
John licked the head of Sherlock’s erection. The detective shuddered. He moaned, making John’s erection twitch in pleasure.
John licked at the hardened nub and sucked harder. “Like that?” He asked Sherlock. “Ooh, like that?”
”I like this hair,” John said. He looked up at Sherlock and gave a long, slow lick.
“You asked to be cured both the slow way
Sherlock blushed and kissed John again. John swept his tongue across Sherlock’s lower lip. Sherlock let John’s tongue in and felt him caress every inch of his mouth.
John and Sherlock began to serve food, finally serving themselves and sitting down. There was no conversation at first, as everyone was digging in but John finally made his way to interrogating Tim.
John cocked his head but, instead of asking anything, shrugged instead. "Do you think they'll be long then?" he asked, searching the street for the women.
John, wanting to be inside Sherlock, decided to speed him up by tugging his own pants down. Sherlock moaned as he saw John’s large erection. It was above average and he knew exactly what to do with it. He pressed it against Sherlock’s pants and felt the other man’s moans cause his cock to twitch. John thrusted and Sherlock moaned. His cock tried to escape from his pants and John decided to help it.
“Yes please,” Sherlock murmured.
“Yes, two months,” Rosie stated clearly.
Sherlock trembled and twitched. His head fell but sprang back up as John’s hand slapped him. He felt another rush of blood flow through him, down to his throbbing cock. His member was begging for release. “Captain, I’m- I’m- Yes!” Sherlock moaned as John’s hand slapped his thigh. The overpowering pain made Sherlock cry out as he came. His orgasm covered the sheets and John’s legs. Sherlock’s body went limp and collapsed over John’s knee.
“I don’t feel so good, Doctor. Will you examine me?” Sherlock asked seductively.
John’s orgasm filled his cock and he waited to release. When Sherlock pounded into him, he moaned and waited. When Sherlock pulled at his hair, he still waited. But, when Sherlock raked his hands down John’s thighs, he released, covering Sherlock’s stomach and legs.
John's hand slipped under Sherlock's waistband. He didn't directly for Sherlock's cock though. He wanted to tease Sherlock just a little longer, test him just a bit more. He felt for Sherlock's balls. He rolled one in his palm, best he could anyway in the position he was in. Sherlock's legs squirmed at this. John smirked and squeezed Sherlock in his palm.
He pulled out his phone and opened a new message.
Finally, Rosie came down, hair curled in the front. The shine of lipgloss could be seen upon her lips.
"Was it the children?" John asked.
If only he knew exactly how much they weren't pretending.
John leaned into Sherlock. “Because I already have,” He said.
,” Sherlock moaned. His entire body was practically dripping in sweat. Sherlock’s erection bobbed up and down as John thrusted.
Sherlock looked down at his erection. It was standing and leaking precum. He observed the rest of his body. His nipples were hard and his lips were wet from his licks. He rolled his eyes. John was right. “Damn you John Watson,” He said.
Sherlock landed and he grunted as John collapsed on him. His erection twitched as John shifted and Sherlock cooed when John rotated his hips.
“Any kind you want,” John said. He leaned forwards, trapping Sherlock between his back and the table. He licked the shell of the detective’s ear. “Does that sound good?” he asked.
Sherlock nodded and continued eating. He gave John a reassuring look. His husband was a bit overprotective.
“Merry Christmas, Uncle Greg And Uncle Mycroft,” she said.
John was dragged back to reality when he felt Sherlock’s arms wrap around his neck. “John,” He said. He pulled John close. “Fuck me,” He moaned into John’s ear.
He practically leaped over the back of his chair and dashed over to John. He'd already started cleaning up some of the tubes Sherlock had spread over the table. He sniffed one and recoiled, right back into Sherlock's chest. He tensed up and turned. He looked up at Sherlock. "What?" he demanded.
John rolled the top of Sherlock’s pants down. The newly exposed skin was vulnerable and John rolled his thumbs around Sherlock’s waist. He grabbed the top of Sherlock’s pants and yanked them down. Sherlock’s erection stood, hard as a rock.
John stared at him and shifted his jaw. He went to grab Sherlock but Sherlock ducked, dropping the riding crop. John fell on him and smirked. He rolled the two of them over and pushed Sherlock back on his legs until his erection was nearly underneath Sherlock.
Sherlock shook his head. “No, Doctor.”
"Can- can we leave now?" Sherlock asked, finally have gained his breath back. He looked up at Lestrade, waiting for an answer.
“Will you feel better if you come? Will you be cured?” John asked.
Sherlock nodded. "How old are your children?" he asked.
John smiled and pulled Sherlock in for another kiss. "Thank you."
Tim and Rosie finished next. Rosie wanted to show Tim her room but John said they should stay downstairs so Tim could get to know the family.
!” Sherlock shouted as John pounded into him.
"This isn't the weapon," Sherlock said.
...” He begged. John nipped at Sherlock’s neck. He thrusted into Sherlock and smirked when Sherlock yelped. “
John moaned and bucked. “Sherlock,” He moaned, breathless. Sherlock thrusted again and John moaned. “
John ground his erection on Sherlock’s. Sherlock moaned and clung onto the headboard as if it were a life preserver. “Please, Captain. I
,” He moaned. John ran his thumb over the head and trailed his finger back up Sherkock’s shaft. He ran his thumb over the head again and Sherlock groaned. “
Michael Holland was a short man with a dark beard that ran all the way up to his ears. He wore a plain, black shirt with jeans. He looked very young to already have divorced someone. He sat at Lestrade's desk, intimidated by the three men staring at him.
"But you love her," Sherlock said, tears falling again. "You really love her."
John smirked. He pulled Sherlock closer. “Maybe you do need to be punished. Wanking over the thought of your best friend
Sherlock smiled and let his eyes close. He slowly fell asleep, safe and secure in John’s arms.
John squeezed particularly rough, and Sherlock gasped. "John, please, not here," he begged.
Sherlock noticed John’s trousers rise as his erection grew. He smirked and set the riding crop on John’s chest. He pushed him backwards and crawled onto the bed. He pushed John’s legs together and sat on top of them. He dragged the riding crop down John’s chest to his thighs. He slowly drew it back up to John’s chest, watching his erection the entire time.
“Of course,” Rosie giggled- giggled, much to John’s hatred, and then led someone into the living room. “Papa, Daddy, this is Tim.”
It made Sherlock giddy all over again.
John smirked. “Fine. Come here,” He said, standing up. Sherlock walked over to him and, with surprising skill, John twisted his arm behind his back. “Go ahead. Prove yourself,” He said.
John looked down. He looked back up after a moment, his puppy eyes not helping the swell in Sherlock's chest. "I have too," he said. "I think of you everyday." Oh, was this it? The holy moment he'd been praying for? The moment where John would finally come back to him? Please, let it be.
Sherlock shook his head. “No sir.”
Sherlock took in a breath before diving back into John. His tongue darted in and out of his mouth and he licked John’s lower lip. He bit it and groped at John’s ever growing bulge in his pants. John moaned and grabbed Sherlock’s hand. “No teasing for you today. You lost, which means I’m in control,” John growled. His voice was a deep rumble and it went straight to Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock moaned and did nothing to prevent John from pinning his other hand to the wall.
John growled and pulled Sherlock’s hips back onto his cock as he threw his hips into Sherlock. “Are you close yet, Love?”
. His mutters were filthy and inappropriate but that just added to all of the sexiness. His thrusts were hard and his cock jabbed at Sherlock’s prostate.
John knew this, of course, and used it to his advantage. He brought his other hand up and pinched Sherlock’s sensitive nub between his fingers.
Rosie smiled at him then gasped. “I have presents,” she said, then ran upstairs, quick as a flash.
The words were out before Sherlock could register them. “Perhaps you should punish me.”
Sherlock scoffed. “You? I’d be able to wriggle out of your grasp before you could get me in my room,” He said arrogantly.
Sherlock nodded. “Oh yes, Doctor. I’ll feel much better,” He said.
"Yeah," John said. He turned to face Sherlock. "I was just getting jealous," he said.
He heard the door to his office open and he spun around. Nobody else was supposed to be there.
Sherlock and John glanced at each other. They turned back to Rosie. She looked up at her father’s hopefully. “Yes,” they both said.
John’s erection stood and Sherlock’s eyes widened at the sight of it. It was long and wet, much like Sherlock had imagined it in his dreams. He let out a quiet moan.
“Oh, in his room with our cousin,” she said. She led Tim down the hall.
Sherlock let go of John’s bulge. John whimpered. “Oh! Did you like my touch?” Sherlock growled.
”Goodnight John,” Sherlock murmured, half asleep.
Sherlock looked at him. “Yes?”
"That must've been a very goo day for you," Lestrade continued.
flat mate for nearly two weeks. That’s naughty, Sherlock.
John stood. “Of course,” He said. He quickly cleaned up Sherlock’s orgasm and tossed the towel away. He followed, sort of helped, Sherlock into his bed and covered him up with his covers. He kissed the back of his neck and Sherlock shivered.
"I'll explain in the cab," Sherlock said and pushed John through the door.
Sherlock tried to ignore his aeipathy for John. Only, things began getting problematic when Sherlock began having dreams about John. Dreams about John in his bed,
Crying everyday since the wedding. Staying inside to avoid social interaction. Not drinking or eating. "Nothing," Sherlock said. "What about you?" he asked, wanting to hear about John.
“The friend she’s invited is actually her boyfriend,” Sherlock said.
John nodded. He gently stroked his hand down Sherlock’s back. “Does it hurt when I do this?” He asked.
John felt Sherlock’s semen cover his stomach. The sticky sensation sent a spark down his spine and John felt his orgasm build up in his stomach. He pounded into Sherlock once more and came. He panted and pulled out. He collapsed onto the bed next to Sherlock and panted again. He admired the man sitting next to him, hair messy, cheeks pink, and mouth contorted into the shape of an O.
John smirked. He gave Sherlock a gentle kiss before releasing him to get dressed.
John crawled over to Sherlock’s drawers and rummaged around until he found a condom. He slipped it over his cock and adjusted it so that it felt comfortable. When he was sure it was on safely, he crawled back over to Sherlock and felt the tight ring of muscle. It was red and very compacted. John lubed up his fingers before slowly sticking one in.
Sherlock arched up but calmed down when John pulled his finger out. John entered two fingers and Sherlock moaned. The feel of John’s fingers inside him made him squirm.
John turned and said, "I know I'm with Mary, but, don't think I won't come around. All right?"
Sherlock laughed and kissed John. Their lips smacked as they kissed, and they laughed into each other’s mouths at the silliness of all of it.
John looked up at Sherlock and caught his eye. Sherlock’s smirk played on his lips and John’s erection twitched when he subtly bit his lower lip. John’s eyes ventured down Sherlock’s body, admiring all of his features. His lanky arms, his pale skin, his delicious lips, his tight arse, his fuckable... everything. John let his mind undress Sherlock and he imagined his long cock, his loud moans, his lips on John’s.
“Could I have a friend come over for the party?” she asked.
Sherlock groaned and pulled John’s pants down. His large erection flopped out and Sherlock moaned. He threw his head back. He bit his lip and looked back up. He traced a finger up John’s erection, admiring its length.
Sherlock bit John’s lower lip. He loved the taste of John’s lips. They tasted so delicious. Sherlock could kiss and nibble them all day.
Sherlock turned his head and smiled. “Little hot.”
he wrote. He glanced over at his boyfriend, whose cheeks had gone a strawberry pink from his yelp. He slowed down his strokes, not wanting to overstimulate Sherlock too quickly. He watched Sherlock bite back a moan. This gave John an idea.
“It's-" Sherlock tried to say but broke off as tears filled his eyes. He hid his face in his hands as tears fell down his face in wet streaks. He shook and attempted to silent the choked sob that threatened to escape him.
The feel of John’s erection entering him at such a pace made Sherlock want to scream and thrust. However, John was holding him still. Since he couldn’t anything, he tried to make John’s rocks faster by shaking but that only made John go slower. He went slow until Sherlock begged and begged. He thrusted and felt his erection pound into Sherlock’s prostate. Sherlock moaned and shuddered.
“Coming?" John said.
Sherlock, satisfied with his deductions, turned. John locked the door. The sound of the tumbling lock made a shiver run down Sherlock’s spine. John’s confident smirk didn’t help. As he turned, his dark eyes pierced Sherlock. He inhaled sharply as John set his hand on Sherlock’s chest. He shoved Sherlock backwards, not caring if his sudden weight messed up his neat sheets.
Sherlock shrugged. "Most of them, at least," he said.
“Where is everybody?” the voice asked.
Sherlock turned to look up at John properly. “You could... Come inside me,” he suggested.
“So much. So much. Just keep going,” He said. “Just please, keep going. Doing that,” He said as Sherlock pounded into him. “
“Lucy?”
John ground into Sherlock again and Sherlock moaned through pursed lips. “Mmm, John. You’re so bad,” He said.
John smirked. “You have one minute to get undressed,” he explained. He glanced down at his watch. “Go.”
"Fuck," Sherlock gasped as John kissed down his neck. He sucked on the skin occasionally. He liked spreading out the hickeys he gave Sherlock. Made for a much more fun game of "hide the evidence".
, please,” he begged.
Sherlock moaned. “So much,” He said.
Sherlock slipped out of John and collapsed into the chair behind him. He took in a shaky breath and exhaled. He caught his breath and zipped up his trousers. He looked over John’s body and smiled. The small man was heaving and his arse was red from the smack of Sherlock’s body.
Sherlock felt his balls grow heavy with seed and warned John. “Fuck, John, I’m, I’m gonna- I’m gonna, OH!” Sherlock cried out as John thrusted as hard as he could.
John looked at Sherlock. This stupid man. This stupid, arrogant, pain in the arse was the man he’d chosen to love. But he didn’t regret it. As John looked at Sherlock, he saw awe and arousal. Sherlock had discussed his military kink with John a few times but he’d never actually done anything to trigger it. Now, he’d pinned Sherlock to a wall and subconsciously looked at his lips.
Mike stared at him. "I don't know anything!" he said.
He took hold of John’s trousers and pulled them down to his ankles. His pants came down along with them and his erection stood up. Sherlock sat on his knees in front of John and he noticed the other man bit his lip in order to surpress a moan. He smirked and took hold of John’s cock. John moaned and threw his head back. “God, Sherlock,” He moaned. Sherlock smirked and squeezed his hand. John moaned and Sherlock felt his hand get wet from John’s precum.
“Then explain why her ring is clean on the outside. She makes an effort to show it. She wants people to know she has it. If it was an unhappy marriage, than she wouldn’t want attention drawn to it,” Sherlock sneered.
Lestrade nodded. "Take Sherlock," he said.
John gulped and fidgeted. His erection was pushing against his pants and it was beginning to get uncomfortable.
Sherlock felt John laugh beside him. He wanted to snap something at him but whatever he was going to say died in his throat as John stroked at a maddening pace. Sherlock slumped over in his seat, biting down onto his knuckles as John's hand pumped him, faster and faster, bringing him closer and closer, dangerously close to the edge. Sherlock whimpered and closed his eyes. His teeth were clenching onto his knuckle, muffling his gasps. He looked over at John who was biting his tongue. He looked away from his phone. His eyes met Sherlock's. John muttered, "Don't" and then Sherlock was spilling, spilling, all over John's hand and on his pants, biting down onto his knuckles, hard enough to leave a mark, trying desperately to cover his moans.
“No?” John asked.
She had bought Sherlock a magnifying glass with his initials, WSSWH- William Sherlock Scott Watson-Holmes-, engraved  into it. Sherlock hugged her and thanked her immensely.
John cocked his head. "How could you possibly know that?" he demanded.
He pulled away, staring up at Sherlock with that smirk. “Oh, love,” He teased. "I can already see the bruises forming."
John looked up at him. "Both," he replied with that smile that made Sherlock's dopamine levels go all silly. And, just possibly, they went too high.
Sherlock nodded and clawed John’s back. “The fast way is
“Don’t,” was all he could manage.
Lestrade smiled and responded with something Sherlock didn't hear. He was too focused on John. He was wearing a jumper underneath his signature jacket with patches on the shoulders. His shoes were old. Sherlock remembered them from running across London streets and sprinting after suspects. God, he wanted nothing more than to grab him by the collar and kiss him. But that was foolish. John was married. And not to Sherlock.
Sherlock avoided John’s gaze. He was too embarrassed. John’s hand lifted Sherlock’s head. He kissed him softly. “Don’t worry. I take it as a compliment,” John said.
Sherlock cried out as he was shoved down against the table. Sherlock could feel John pressing himself against his arse, and God was it a good feeling. He could feel every inch John’s thick, long cock. He wanted it so badly.
“John, you haven’t come home,” Sherlock said. His voice was deep and seductive. He did it on purpose, John just knew. But it still worked.
John ran a hand through Sherlock’s curls. “Captain, that was,
Sherlock noticed. “What’s wrong, sweetheart?” he asked.
Sherlock stared, cold, before he cracked a smile. “Merry Christmas.”
Sherlock nodded. “
Sherlock gulped as John grabbed the lube. He heard it being squirted out and then the delicious squeak of John’s gloves as he rubbed the lube in his hands.
John nodded and gulped.
Sherlock unzipped John’s trousers and pulled them down to his knees. John kicked them off and tugged Sherlock’s own trousers down.
John rolled his eyes and set the computer on the table next to him. “Sherlock, if you have nothing to do, then why don’t you try and clean up this flat?” He suggested. “Here, I’ll help you.” John picked up one of Sherlock’s notebooks and laid it next to his microscope.
Lestrade rubbed his face. “I still have to interview you. You understand don’t you?” he asked, hoping this interview would last that much longer. It had been a long day.
“Yes! Yes!” Sherlock cried. The pressure on his thigh vanished. He sighed and looked back at John. He was licking his lips. Sherlock felt his prick perk up as John kissed his neck. John’s tongue made a trail up to his chin. “John, I- Shh. You will refer to me as Captain Watson. Understand?” Sherlock nodded. “Good. Now, my room,
Sherlock collapsed into the pillows and panted. He was sure he looked disheveled and sweaty. He admired the man above him. John’s hair was sticking up in different directions and his cheeks were flushed.
“Maybe it was the children of two divorced parents.”
“I did not!” Hamish defended.
John scissored his way into Sherlock’s body. His other hand ran up Sherlock’s back to his curls, which he began to twirl around his fingers.
There was a knock at the door and Hamish ripped it open. A girl tackled him to the ground, exclaiming his name happily. “Hamish!”
John thrusted, penetrating Sherlock’s prostate. “Wouldn’t dream of it, Soldier,” he said. He sucked on Sherlock’s neck while heightening himself into Sherlock. His erection grew heavy with his orgasm and he licked Sherlock’s cheekbone. “Nearly there,” he whispered. “Nearly there.”
“I know you want to join Scotland Yard, so I bought you that,” she said.
John clapped his hands together. “Well, I have your diagnosis,” He said.
The secret couple returned and the men broke apart. “Dad,” Rosie asked.
Sherlock was persistent. He leaned his head on the back of John's and let his warm breath move down John's neck. The man shivered, and Sherlock smirked.
When John’s chest was bare, Sherlock bent down. He started at John’s stomach. He licked up to his neck and bit his skin. He kissed John and nibbled on his lower lip.
Sherlock let out a shaky breath. His heart was racing and his mind was running wild at the thought of John dominating him, controlling him, ordering him around... The possibilities were endless. Sherlock gazed into John’s eyes. He saw that they were filled with the same want that his were. He decided to please both of them and kiss him.
John stared at him in amazement. “Are you sure you can?” he asked.
The slap of their connecting bodies echoed in John’s ear and he bit his lip in order to hold in a moan.
Sherlock smiled as John climbed into the cab. He waved as John disappeared. Was he still allowed to call John his? At least privately? Yes, Sherlock finally decided. John had said he loved Sherlock. And that was a reassurance. That meant that every night spent thinking about his clever, soldier boy weren't one sided. Sherlock smiled. Maybe his thoughts would be happier tonight.
Sherlock’s cock hardened at the sound of John’s intense voice. He nodded, eager to feel the man on him and inside him.
Sherlock gripped the headboard as the tip of John’s member entered him. With a brash push, John was fully inside Sherlock. Sherlock’s hips lifted off the mattress as he cried out. “Captain, please,” he begged. John thrusted and Sherlock arched his back. “Ah, Captain,
Sherlock was in a particularly odd mood. It was a mood he was rarely in: a sexy mood.
John flipped the paper in the packet. Sara had packed him with work and he had to finish that night. He groaned and rubbed his temples. He was still going to be working at 11.
Sherlock thought. “What did she do?” he asked.
John slowly took Sherlock into his mouth.
Sherlock scrambled to obey John. He felt John’s strong hand on his back. It steadied Sherlock and disappeared. Sherlock tried to deduce what was going on behind him. He could hear the the clink of John’s belt buckle as he pulled it from his jeans. He heard a snap and inhaled, waiting for the impending smack.
His black curls were hanging over his pale face and his beautiful eyes were stationed on John’s arse. His lips were wet and he was biting his bottom lip as he pounded into John.
He was right over Sherlock, shirtless and impossibly hard. John sat on his knees, straddling Sherlock, and pulled his belt from its loops. He tossed it to the ground and slipped off his trousers with ease. He stretched the elastic of his pants for a moment- just to tease Sherlock- but then pulled them down, exposing his large cock. It flicked up and Sherlock moaned at the sight of it. John bent down and kissed Sherlock. He gripped his hips and flipped them around.
!” He cried. Sherlock quickly pulled out and John heaved. “Sherlock, yes,” He moaned. Sherlock entered him again, a bit farther this time, and smirked when John arched up and moaned. He exited but then, for the final time, entered John.
“No,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock moaned. “Oh so, so much John.”
Sherlock dashed down the sidewalk, keeping an eye on the woman in front of him. John was behind him, footsteps echoing into the night. The suspect tried to cross the street but was nearly hit by a motorbike. She fell to the ground and Sherlock, along with John, stood above her. "You're under arrest," Sherlock said, pulling Lestrade's badge from his pocket.
John smiled and kissed his forehead. “I love you.”
"I got bits and pieces," he said.
, they echoed.
With that, John dropped to his knees and jabbed his tongue into Sherlock’s desperate arsehole. Sherlock cried out and jumped as John’s warm tongue lapped and licked at his arse. “Oh God, John, Dr. Watson, yes, yes,” Sherlock moaned.
Tim smiled and turned to Rosie. “Where’s Hamish?” he asked.
,” Sherlock swore. He bucked and rested his forehead against John’s. “Please,” He begged.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Of course I don’t relax. There’s no capacity in my brain for that,” He said. He kicked the ball again and John set his book down.
John smirked. “Do you want me to tell you what I’m going to do?” He growled. Sherlock nodded violently and moaned as John rolled his hips again. “I’m going to make you beg. Make you purple with how hard you are for me. You’ll be craving me and needing me. And, when you beg and moan, I’ll fuck you. Fuck you until you can’t see straight. Until your mind is blurred and your legs don’t work. You’ll be all mine,” He growled.
Sherlock gulped. “I want you to...”
Sherlock shook his head. "I've laid off the wall," he said.
Sherlock gasped and shuddered as the cool air hit his exposed skin. John didn’t touch him for a long while. “John?” Sherlock asked nervously. He looked back and saw John was taking in the sight of him.
Sherlock sucked on his lower lip for a second before nodding and getting in the cab.
John thrusted and moaned as well. He loved the feel of Sherlock’s muscles contracting around his large erection as he threw his hips against Sherlock’s arse. He growled into Sherlock’s ear. “How much do you want to cum?”
John smiled. “Very good. Now, turn so I can examine the rest of you,” He said.
John nodded. Tim obviously had a good plan for his future. “What do your parents say about that?” he asked.
“Oh,” Sherlock said, concealing his moan.
John slapped Sherlock’s arse and relished in his loud moans. He slapped Sherlock’s thighs, his arse, and finally his bollocks.
John lubed himself up. He bit back his moan as his hands rubbed his erection. He exhaled heavily and turned back to Sherlock. He had the riding crop again. John felt his erection twitch as Sherlock but the riding crop. He was teasing John. John kissed him and caressed Sherlock’s cheek.
"Tonight?" John asked.
John gripped Sherlock’s hips with such force that Sherlock cried out in pain. “Oh, shut up,” John ordered. “You’ve been a stupid, selfish arsehole. I think it’s time I taught you a lesson. What do you think?” he asked, eyebrow arched.
