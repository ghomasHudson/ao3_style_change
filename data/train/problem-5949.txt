"Hey. Hey hey hey, what's wrong Pep? What happened? Talk to me."
There was no way Tony would ever consider raising a family, raising Peter, where danger lurked in every corner and would require Tony Stark as IronMan more often than Tony Stark was allowed to be a parent. So Tony was happy here, happy to live in a farm complete with a barn and livestock on 70 acres of land, far away from his former life.
Sam watches Steve's face drop into a pained expression, his jaw tightening.
"Barton's."
He hugs his baby boy closer as he moves from the window to the kitchen aisle. He glances over at the fire engine - makes a mental note to repaint the bonnet in red white and blue- and opens the fridge with one hand, while cradling his son on the other.
There was a pregnant two second pause before Tony could form a sentence. "Okay this conversation is
He tries not to sigh, so he inhales the roses in the bouquet pressed to his chest. He didn't come for a fight, not with Steve and certainly not with Steve's best friend with whom he shared a love-hate relationship with. They've always been indifferent to each other, but right now Tony was at a disadvantage. By now Barnes would have gotten the whole low down of Steve and Tony's recent fallout, so Tony braces himself.
“That's getting old, Tony,” Steve deadpans.
Bucky pauses just outside the door. "Just take it with you on your way outta there, pal."
Communication, or the lack of, had always been the pitfall of their relationship. They talked to each other a lot, in fact they spent a healthy amount of time dancing around one other to the frustration of everyone. Most of their conversations unfortunately were of them trading barbs and disagreeing, yelling on top of their lungs until one of them storms away or breaks something (RIP log of wood). On better days, Steve and Tony would steal glances across the room and seemed to read the other person’s mind in a disgustingly cute way.
Peter just nods, knowing he wasn't really
Wakanda.
"Steve.."
"Congratulations, soldier. So how did it go?"
Tony looks at her adoringly. "Who's gonna pilot Veronica?"
Tony tries hard not to smile. They adopted the world’s cutest kid, for sure. “Well neither do I, Spud, but I eat them anyway because Pops tells me to. Trust me you don’t want to argue with your Papa on these sorts of things. Take it from me - it never ends well,” Tony says, stealing a glance at Steve, who frowns and widens his eyes in silent protest. Tony suppresses a smile as he continues with his Dad voice, “Besides, broccoli is ...
"I didn't realise how much you mean to me until you walked away. Watching you leave felt like a tank had hit me in the chest, and believe me Tony, the tank hurts a lot less. I thought I was brave, but losing you scares the life out of me. I've never, ever felt this way. Not with anyone but you."
Finally.
Pepper slaps his arm. "TONY I meant you actually planned to literally go down on one knee? You romantic little shit!"
The genius never felt stupider, and he sobered up immediately to apologize to both Peter and Happy before breaking down in a puddle of tears. Peter saw a vulnerable side of Tony Stark that afternoon, a very human side that newspapers rarely wrote about. He stood by the door, watching Happy crouch next to the broken man as he hugged his knees and sobbed, apologising over and over again for Siberia, for letting things go that far.
"Cap's PSA was on safe sex today during gym class," Peter explains, stifling a giggle.
?" Tony asks, pressing the palm of his hand against one eye to help him focus.
Wrapping his waist with the towel, Tony heads to the toilet before he joins Bucky at the kitchen. The soldier hands him a mug of coffee with his metal hand. Tony couldn't help but marvel at the sight of the shiny steel, his brain already thinking of ways to take it apart, reassemble it, maybe weaponise it, put it back together. He was such a inventor he sees possibilities in everything.
, j-just don't stop baby please. Fuckmefuckmefuckme," Tony begs to the rhythm of Steve's hips thrusting into him. Steve dutifully complies, jabbing Tony's prostate over and over again in an increasingly rapid motion. Soon the rattling sound of the phone was drowned by Tony's moans and Steve was quickly inching closer to his 5th? 6th orgasm? Didn't matter. His balls were tightening and he knew he was going to blow his load anytime now.
Above all, he was so, so tired of not being able to admit that he painfully missed a certain brunette.
Steve emerges from it, ushering their son out and closing the door behind him. Peter hops back to the living room dragging a new set of pajamas with him, leaving his parents to talk. “Yeah I thought about it but I was put off when Jim told me they’d publicised my appearance even before I got the invitation.”
"What's that?" Steve curiously asks.
Steve presses his larger, muscular body against Tony's sweaty back once they were both on their sides, and he tilts Tony's face towards him to kiss him sweetly. Tony sighs into his lips, leaning eagerly with an open mouth and twinning his tongue to Steve's. As their mouths seal in a passionate erotic kiss, Steve lifts Tony's leg to nestle his steel hard erection under his husband's balls, rutting against his perineum and cock.
Of course that remark completely flew over Steve's head, so as soon as Bucky was down the stairs and out of sight, Steve awkwardly invites the billionaire in. He offers to take Tony's coat but without pause, reaches for Tony's shoulders to peel it off. They really shouldn't be this domesticated around each other, but that was exactly what this visit was about.
Steve Rogers was something else.
“And it’s only seven,” Tony adds.
"You did?" His voice was a pitch higher, unable to contain his interest.
Steve cheeks turns hot against Tony's skin within seconds and he could only muster a small "Yes", as words in his head didn't seem to want to cooperate to form a proper sentence.
...to be continued
“Oh God,” Steve groans, covering his face in embarrassment. His breath hitches when he sees through the gaps of his fingers Tony suddenly kneeling over him. The smaller man casually pushes his legs together to straddle his thighs.
," Tony breathes out.
Peter pouts, contemplating. "Just casual sex then?"
“God baby. You know I love it when you eat me up."
“Alright,” Steve says in earnest as though bracing himself for words of wisdom.
A portal was conjured right by their bedside and they were face to face with Bucky Barnes palming his eyes with both his flesh and metal hands, Dr Stephen Strange standing next to him with the most unimpressed expression on his face and Wong chuckling in the background, hands tucked across his chest, unperturbed by the sight.

"Frankly, neither do I. I swear Natasha I am still traumatised by that one time I walked in----"
t-today. I honestly forgot about you coming over and right now, I'm actually trying really hard not to freak out and have a heart attack.” He runs out of breathe, his voice was quaking, eyes watery and his lips quivered. He still tries to smile but a sob escapes him. He forces a breathy laugh, shaking his head.
walls” she corrects, and flops her palm towards the moving view, “and the open field."
Steve was conscious of the fact Tony was going to notice the steadily rising thumps in his chest if the smaller man continues to lay against Steve. He tries to pry Tony off of him, but the tipsy brunette playfully struggled against his grip and it quickly turns into a sporting event. The friendly altercation between the two super heroes ends with Tony regaining his spot sprawled over Steve’s chest (Steve barely resisted, come on) but he was now in between the soldier's legs.
“Oh, you ingrate. I'll have you know I was a total babe back then,” he says in mock-offense, rising to his feet. "Nerd yes, but totally bang-worthy."
It manages to stretch Tony's lips into a smile.
They never spoke about that day, not that Peter expected the billionaire ever needing to explain himself.
"Good morning Sir, Captain Rogers," JARVIS suddenly speaks, halting any further movement from the two men. Mid-way with their tongues shoved down their throats, they blink at each other momentarily before bursting into a laugh and drawing apart.
Steve's mouth remains open. “Let me understand this right. I have a reputation for being a terrible kisser?”
Tony blinks. He zones out of his head and refocuses to see Bucky staring into the living room, his back against Tony. Slow turning around with a horrified expression across his face, Bucky stares at him.
Sam’s words made Steve clasp the device with both his hands and rests his head against them, elbows on his knees.
"Yeah kinda. What's up guys? It's actually," - Tony glances at the hologram watch on the wall - "legitimately
If Sokovia turned out to be one of those before-you-die kind of moments like New York, Tony was determined to go down on Steve one last time.

Steve was on his stomach, his usual sleeping position, tangled under silk sheets and buried under soft pillows. As he blinked his eyes open, he could hear Tony's steady breathing, fingers twirling the tip of his blonde hair. The smell of sex, sweat and coffee filled the room as Steve took a long deep breathe, stirring awake. As he drew out the air from his lungs, he was slightly jolted by the cool wet trail that seeped down his thighs.
"You were building a new team for the Avengers so you can retire peacefully," she finishes, reading his mind. "Tony ... does Steve realises that while he could probably live until 200,

It was only after her comment that he realized he was continously tearing off a new sheet of writing paper with only the words
"FRIDAY?"
The remnants of Tony's spill from last night.
"Perfect would involved a bed," Steve says, unearthing some sass from buried under his staggered breaths. "And lube," he adds.
"You listen to me Anthony Edward Stark," Pepper warns. "You are one of the greatest minds of this generation. You are beyond smart, you are very handsome and you happen to be my ex-boyfriend too, so stop selling yourself short with all this self-loathing. You understand?"
"Like literally?" Pepper asks, looking pained.
It threw a wrench in the process, as Steve and Tony were forced to reunite under terrible circumstances. Their last conversation at the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre in Berlin drew no conclusion, even when Tony admitted that he missed Steve and begged him to sign the Accords. Steve held his ground firm, refusing to cave into the arms of the man he loved with every fibre of his soul.
"Thank you," Tony says, quickly taking a gulp of the piping hot beverage. He's always enjoyed the burn down his throat. Thinking of
"Thank you JARVIS," Steve says, looking to the ceiling out of habit. "I'll uh," Steve begins again, trying to compose himself. He looks at Tony and loses his train of thought. He apologises silently through his blue eyes.
"Boss, we're approaching the Tower in 2 minutes."
Tony starts to tremble above him, losing rhythm a little as Steve spreads precome leaking from the slit of their cocks. He starts to pump them slowly then grows faster, in time with Tony's thrusts. Amongst all of Steve's fantasies with Tony, most of them sexual of course, Steve has frequently fantasised about getting Tony off with his mouth. Handjobs occasionally. But this? This was definitely something Steve had never imagined.
It was mid autumn, the air was cool and the sun rose later that morning than it did yesterday.
sorry for what I did."
Bucky straightens up and puts three pieces of bacon on a plate. He slides it to Tony. "Maybe I am."
Tony says nothing at first, considering in his head that they could be talking about the Black Panther’s sidekick, who knows. But curiosity got the best of him and his heart starts to pump at the possibility that...
He has never been happier to be proven wrong.
He was relieved that the supersoldier did not shove him away. That would result in many broken bones and a lot of explaining to do.
Peter makes a face. "Nah, I've always been more of an Iron Man kind of person. Ok I'm bit of both actually. The Red and The blue does make a pretty good combination."
"What the fuck?! WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING HERE?!" Tony screams.
But the damage was done and Steve continues to glare at Sam, pleading for the man to end his misery.
So Tony takes the chance to internally scream.
"What are you
But it does look like Steve may have just redeemed his reputation after all.

Tony giggled softly, bumping his nose against Steve’s.
getting juvenile. Steve shifts in his seat uncomfortably, unsure where the conversation was heading to.
“Bucky let’s go, let’s gooooo!” Peter exclaims, patting the ex-assassin on the top of his head as he pointed at the next ride on his mental list. It’s a good thing Bucky sports a shorter hair cut now; Peter really loved shoulder rides – he would climb over Steve whenever he could, and would do the same with Bucky. Right now Peter was literally bouncing in excitement, his tiny feet kicking into Bucky's chest as clammy hands draped along Bucky’s face.
, bemused the few people around him that he had left.
"I can't come home."
“What are you
Sam was also feeling light that night, despite having just been through heavy gunfire, the purpling bruises and cuts still fresh on his arms.
He shakes his head lightly.
“Uh, okay,” was all Steve could muster as blood steadily travels south on the fast track to sin. Choo choo.
"Boss?"
. But Rogers made it specific.
The four year old ignores him.
This wasn’t New York. This wasn’t Malibu. There were no bad guys attacking their family home, or, god forbid, his son. Tony no longer walked around with nanites in his chest reactor nor did he need Friday guarding the perimeters of his property for incoming missiles.
“Yes!” Steve blurted, louder than he intended.
Throat as dry as the Sahara.
He leans in.
Tony feels stupid. He feels weak. He feels betrayed by himself for easily caving in on Steve's request without a moments' hesitation. It was a case of his head and his heart being on opposite sides of the same pole. How could he still obsessively crave for a man who bludgeoned him into the ground after being caught lying to him about the murder of his parents, for the sake of the protecting the murderer? And this man was possibly Steve's new flame?
"Sure," Steve curtly bows his head once.
"This, better be an emergency Strange, or so help me God," Steve threatens low and dangerously, almost growling without finishing his sentence.
Peter dragged Bucky from ride to ride - from the spinning cups to the merry-go-round to a walk across the house of mirrors. He cheered loudly and clapped as Bucky sharply tossed rings over bottles, shot moving ducks off the wall with precision and he never seemed to miss, no matter how lazily he played. Peter was extremely happily that afternoon, hugging all the stuffed animals Bucky won for him from these games, only to off-load them to his Daddy to continue his adventures with his new best friend.
"Nobody -
"No."
Clint watches Tony's back as he steps out into the field, guessing that Tony was about to call the suit to leave. It suddenly hit him.
"Well I did promise you dinner," Tony hummed low as he licked Steve's lips, and sucked Steve's tongue like hard candy when he gained entrance. His hands meanwhile began unravelling Steve's naked waist as they kissed, and soon the towel was discarded haphazardly.
Steve nods again, but he has a frown now.
" Sam says, picking up a strand of hay and tossing it to Steve's face, making him flinch.
As he panics, he pushes himself up, forgetting that Steve was 2 seconds away from coming into his ass. The movement was enough to tip the soldier over and he comes like a geyser halfway into Tony's ass and all over the man's thighs as he pulls out. He tries so hard not to make a sound, given how the moment went from erotically passionate to downright embarrassing but he lets out a silent groan. Using the blankets that were kicked to the edge of the bed to hastily wipe off the traces of semen, he then conceals his husband's nakedness that was directly exposed to three other men, one of whom Steve made no effort of concealing his utter dislike against.
"I was trying to tell you that I care about you, kid. You're not ... unimportant. I care. About you. Like, I don't want you to think I'm only having you around because you're a marketing tool for the New Avengers or an experiment to me, but when I've got better things to do, you drop to the bottom of the list. It's not like that at all."
meet him? Is he insane?" Pepper spouts in disbelief. "Where?" She asks, despite genuinely annoyed at the stupidity of the request.
Tony Stark had just asked him to dinner.
He remembers now.
talking feelings.
To this, the two former lovers laugh, finally inching into a better mood. More so for Tony.
With this awareness came the Phone Call.
At this point, Tony just kisses Steve softly on the lips.
"He told me in his exact words,
"Before Siberia, before things got shitty, Cap and I
“This isn’t an AirB&B Stark. You’re more than welcomed to pack your bags and check into proper accommodation where you and your lovely spouse can stain the walls for someone else to clean.”
“Steve?”
He prays silently.
It was not exactly a mystery that there was nothing professional or platonic about the relationship that broke down between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. The amount of brooding Steve was doing and the facial hair he was allowing to grow to a point he was barely recognisable screamed volumes that the whole fight affected Steve only in a way it would hurt a lover mourning the loss of a sweetheart.
Not wanting to go into battle without at least making nice, Tony made plans to ask Steve to have dinner with him after the final mission briefing, with the purest of intentions. Never mind that Steve never seemed to stay angry at Tony for longer than an hour.
Wanda didn't speak to him for a week after that, and Sam congratulated his Captain for successfully pissing off potentially the most powerful Avenger in the team.
Thing is, it was also obvious to everyone that Tony tragically pined for Steve in the exact same way. He goes over and beyond for Steve on a godlike level but refuses to admit that he was head over heels for the super soldier.
"Do I need to fix him in any way?"
Not even Pepper and Rhodey knew they were ever involved, so whilst it was apparent that Tony came back from Siberia a worse-off, broken man, none of them had any idea that there was also a tragic love story behind it all.
The kid's presence did help. A lot.
“Uh, Honey?" he calls out. "Are you supposed to be somewhere this weekend?”
Steve stared at him with unforgiving eyes.
"OH YOU HAD TO GO THERE, TONES," Rhodey yells out of nowhere. A hearty, booming laugh follows suit, and Tony could tell it was Thor. He got even more confused as he makes out Nat's voice in the background and a few other people having a conversation - Bruce? Clint? Tony maps out the background and recognises that they were in the Sanctum. Tony finally sits up, paying more attention to the situation.
Just words.
Tony takes a deep breathe because he rarely ever addresses the tragedy without a neat glass in hand.
Steve hesitates, but props himself up anyway to a seated position next to Tony.
“You can’t Dare me if we weren’t even playing Truth or Dare to begin with,” Steve points out, feeling clever.
"And Steve Rogers, so help me god, is fucking
"...you want
It wasn't Tony's greatest hour, by far.
Pepper raises her eyebrows, unimpressed. "Was that before or after you asked him to marry you?"
Tony thinks, amused. His dick was still recovering from Steve's aggresive rodeo two hours ago. Not to mention they broke the headboard this time.
Steve swallows, the words hitting him like a ton of bricks. After dramatically chucking his belt aside, Steve fights the urge to look everywhere but downwards. Even without looking, he knows that Tony has
Natasha kicks him with her other boot, startling him awake.
"A'right a'right a'right, you can quit bustin' my chops. Let's - where
Steve nods, his cheeks bunching into a smile Tony truly, truly ached to see for the past three weeks. "I'm really happy you're here Tony. There was nothing tough or manly about the way I've been spending my time since we last spoke. Ask Bucky - I've been a mess. But I've also had the chance to really think about what you said."

Not gonna be able to back you up next time,” Tony coerces then waits, allowing Peter to decide on his next move.

He looks up mid-sentence and notices Tony's unimpressed, confused expression.
"I'm gonna scream your name as you ram that steel dick of yours into my ass until sunrise," Tony says, low and husky. "How's that sound?"

“Are you Tony Stank?”
"So we can -"
"Fuck," escapes Tony's mouth as he tilts his head back to the pressure of Steve's hardening length, like a man whose thirst has been quenched. "Fucking
Bucky leans against the island and looks Tony dead in the eyes.
"Are you two decent yet? Steve?" Bucky desperately calls over his shoulders.
“They are,” Steve says. “Bucky didn’t really say much over the phone. He said they were still okay, were scheduled to be in Switzerland actually, but some jackass wrote a stupid article about the Winter Soldier and that garbage gained a lot of buzz. People behind tall chairs have now politely 'encouraged' Bucky sit this service out to avoid further bad press. Bullshit politics if you ask me, Bucky's mad as hell. That, the busted proposal and Nat taking the jet to the UN without him... he just needs some time off I guess. Hence the couch.”
The boy was genuinely trying to help in a delicate situation in the best way he knew how -
Bucky's eyes were wide; he slowly motions his head to the left, then to the right, then a proper head shake.
"Not since he rammed his shield to my chest, no. Why, does Captain America sends his love?" Tony mock-laughs.
"He feels bad -"

And the bastard actually
“Where’s your husband?” Strange volleys without thinking.
Tony loved it when he begged, praising him every time he gasped and whimpered, encouraging him that Steve's moans was music to his ears. Before long, Tony had guided Steve to the sofa and led him to sit, kneeing Steve’s legs to spread open. Finally,
Tony lets go of his grip against the side of the hood and hooks a hand behind his head, scratching his brown locks before dragging his fingernails harshly down his neck. His other hand digs deep into his jeans pocket, a sad attempt to remain casual while trying to hide the tremor of his limbs. Every word he wanted to say to deny what was really going on, got stuck in his throat.
They reach the truck and Bucky tosses the bag over into the cargo area.
Pepper frowns sadly, knowing without asking who the term of endearment was meant for.
Despite the fall of the mighty Thanos, a lot remained lost. Many carried wounds that bled for a lifetime.
Tony, to his own credit, knew exactly how that app works. Peter had been trying to set an account up for him.
“You okay there, Mr. Stark?” Peter asks in the tiniest voice, almost mouse-like. "Anything I can do?" The young man smiles weakly with his teeth, a knee-jerk attempt to cheer up his mentor.
"Anyway, you shaved," Steve says, noticing the absence of the messy stubble his husband sported lately as opposed to his signature goatee. He lifts Tony's smooth chin with a finger, rotating his face from left to right, inspecting the handsome man who was just playing along. "And you're wearing spectacles. New look?"
That, didn't go very well.
part now? We can do that," Tony said, suddenly pulling back, faking confusion. All while his hands continued to massaged Steve's firm ass, gliding one finger between the cheeks and over Steve's entrance.
….” Peter says defensively, recalling his white lie a couple of months ago that ended with a ferry full of passengers splitting in half over the Hudson river. He doesn't finish his sentence and the room fell into uncomfortable silence.
Tony instinctively rubs his chest over his shirt, feeling the dip of the scar. "Now he wants to talk. After Barnes decided to hop into the freezer again."
It happened at the Tower after they had retrieved Loki's sceptre from Sokovia.
Of course, Tony had to take things too far and personal once again, his criticism of the "element of surprise" approach being as dated as Steve seemed to hit a raw nerve. His final jibe caused the usually level-headed captain to clam up and storm out of the gym without taking his shield with him.
"Why are you like this?" Tony demanded, following and cornering Steve in between the elevator doors after the Captain stormed out of their meeting. "There is a bigger picture here, Steve." Tony said, and it came out as a warning.

“Sure,” Steve smiles as he gets up. “You’re so much better at this Tony. I think I coddle him too much.”
with the teasing. Sam wanted those days back desperately.
The irony of that short telephonic conversation was not lost, given at present day Tony actually had a full blown panic attack when Steve finally learned to use a cellphone.
"Tony? Can I uh, can I see you?"
“Oh he’s
Steve half turns and smiles at the old man.
Steve smiles sadly to his husband. "We'll deal with it together," he whispers, as he cups Tony's chin in his hand affectionately. "This portal plan of yours? I hope you're part of that arrangement, assuming the worst happens. You don't mean any lesser to me than our son does, Tony. I will need the two of you safe."
Tony nodded purposelessly.
"JARVIS."
Steve kisses him deeply, savouring the taste of his lips.
As for Steve Rogers, Tony still loved the man with every fibre of his soul, despite the Lie and every punch that Steve hit him with to protect his buddy. Of course if he was being dramatic about the entire thing, Tony could whinge on the fact that Steve trashed his suit with his bare hands for another man. Then again, Tony left Steve pretty bloodied himself. He even shot Steve at the ribs with a repulser.

The larger man coils one strong arm over Tony's shoulder across his chest, tangling his fingers between the dog tags that Tony wears, once belonging to him, and he rubs the cold steel against the bud of Tony's nipples. As they kiss slowly, wetly, he fingers Tony a few more times to make sure he was ready before he moves to line his hardened cock with more lubricant. When Steve draws back, he smiles to see Tony chasing his lips, wanting more.
"Tony I understand if you don't want to see me at all. I know that we've created a problem bigger than our own but right now I need,
He hooks one arm back to caress his husband's hair.
“”S comfortable, youdon'tknowwhatyou'retalkingbout,” Tony mumbles with his face pressed against Steve's abs. He suddenly turns to look the man in the eye, resting his chin on Steve. “Okay fine.
"Yeah?"
"You two made up?"
The air was thick and unusually misty today.
Natasha allows herself one last half-smirk. Her mind travels far after that, Steve could guess why, and the boxcar fell silent again with only the sound of the locomotive engine and screeching metal filling the air.
“Please Stephen," Tony pleads his case. "You’d bend time and reality to fix cum stains but you won’t set us back a little bit? It's a small party trick on the grand scheme of things," he bargains, his voice strained to a whisper.
, but he didn't want to get chided) and Steve's concerns about hurting Tony if they ever switch roles, given his super strength and ahem, size. It didn't necessarily translate that he didn't want Tony that way, evident by his body language and the way he licks his lips whenever he spoke about Tony in any non-professional context.
"That doesn't sound very private, Nat."
Tony raises an eyebrow behind his tinted glasses and tugs the container closer to his being with one finger. "Come again?"
"Enjoying the ride?" Steve asks daringly. The friction against his dick was good. Oh so good. It was like the floodgates have opened and Steve was helpless against the countless fantasies he's had of Tony flashing their way into his mind and down to his ready and leaking cock. Steve imagines how good it would feel having Tony bouncing off his dick like this and nearly comes in his pants at the thought.

take advantage of the situation, regardless of how tempting it was.
- "how are you?"
Tony lays on him, cum be damned, and they kiss languidly to calm themselves from the high. When they break for air, Steve has a loopy grin on his face.
They needed to talk.
Stephen snorts, refusing to allow melancholy to overcome his thoughts. While he survived the initial dusting, he's lost Christine forever.
"It is known," Natasha quips, and Sam seems to understand that reference.
"Fill me up, sunshine. Come in my ass baby, come on."
Late afternoon of the day of the party, Tony unexpectedly paid a visit to Steve at his apartment just as the Captain finished showering. As soon as he heard Tony's
Tony watches over his shoulder in horror as he sees Steve's death stare under his long blond lashes. Even though the icy blue eyes weren't directed at him, Tony gulps as he pulls the blanket closer to his chest, calculating in his head how fast Steve could leap over and him and strangle the Sorcerer Supreme for interrupting their lovemaking.
“Ah, ah, none of that. We're in this together. I’m just better at making things up as I go along,” Tony says, laying a chaste kiss on Steve before settling on the dinner table to go back to his tablet. Tony flicks the inbox open and goes through the last three Stark Industries-related emails before he notes a particular unread email.
With little choice, Tony forces a hard breath through tight pressed lips, his chest bursting in pain and relief as he blinks back into the present, sweat trickling down his eye. Tony felt on display, as though he was caught mid-way through a stage performance struggling with his words to an eager audience anticipating the next great line. Always a showman who didn't like to disappoint, Tony gives one curt nod to signal that he was okay.
The cheeky man rolls his eyes. “I ate a shiton of Barton’s masala sausage rolls and my pants are killing me. You can stop clutching your pearls now, Cap.”
Tony thinks of that one conversation they had, a random one that Tony decided to slip in a hot topic, and grimaces at the thought of Steve's reaction.
Tony grins inwards as he fills his lungs with air whilst sucking on the hard nipple, enjoying this side of the good captain that he has never seen before. It occurred to Tony that Steve may have taken issue with Tony whenever he reminded the captain that he was archaic,
"WHAT?"
"I'll get it. But hurry up in there," Steve says, throwing his voice as he gets the door without peeking to see who it was. For all he cares, this was a cause for further delay.
Tony only allowed himself to believe that Steve was dutifully responding to his bait out of sheer politeness and responsibility, and not because the other man was equally attracted to him. He pushed away any thought or idea that Steve Rogers would ever feel the same way, convincing himself amongst other reasons that Steve was as straight as Clint's arrow.
"Hi," Tony says shakily, with a half-smile framed by his neatly trimmed goatee. Judging from the specks of snowflakes peppering his perfectly coiffed hair, shoulders and parts of his cashmere pea coat, Tony had walked over here under the snow. The combination of his striking good looks and downlight shining from above made him look like an angel with a soft halo.
“This reminds me of Bucky actually,” Steve speaks again. “He called me this morning asking if he could crash on our couch this weekend. I told him he’s more than welcomed to.”
" call, whether intentional or not, Steve strolled out of his room to greet his man in only a white towel and nothing else.
Steve doesn't answer but he obediently reaches for the bottle of lube, generously slicks himself up before lining himself against Tony's hole. He carefully hooks an arm under Tony's knees and rests it on his thigh as he eased the tip of his cock past his tight ring of muscle. Steve became thankful that the topic of their wizard friend came up; it helped kill the mood a little, because Tony cries out so dirtily when he slides in his big cock that he would have came right there and then, even before properly bottoming out. Focusing on his mission of giving Tony a real treat, Steve takes the loud whimpers as encouragement.
as confirmed by last night's romp - and he may have realised, without needing to look, that Tony was already awake and making stupid faces from the other side of the bed.
"I'm a very understanding person," Steve said, looping a cheeky grin on his face. "You finally decided to leave your cave, Stark?" Steve tried hard to channel his Captain America voice but failed after each word as Tony started to approach him.
If anything, Steve was more than prepared to grovel for forgiveness.
A heavy tear flows over Tony's left lower lash, and the hurting man quickly wiped the drop away, hiding his pain from the shadows of the night.
Pepper envelops herself over Tony this time, calming him down. "You deserve the world, you hear me? If Steve Rogers can't fit you in his, you're better off without him."
A genuine laugh escapes Tony. Bucky presses his lips to contain his smile.
Tony puts down the mug. "Oh boy. Is this you giving me the shovel talk, Barnes?"
“Your turn,” Steve says, resigning.
idea? What are we wanna call her?"
The grinding against Tony's ass that started off slow and lazy began to intensify as Tony starts to recognise a familiar length hardening behind him. His neck, initially peppered with soft hot kisses was now receiving long, wet licks from a tongue Tony was very well acquainted to. The licks alternated between light nibbling and suction, evidence of Steve's growing arousal. Through his peripheral vision, Tony watches as Steve deposits a travel-sized bottle of lube on the kitchen counter, while his other hand creeps down Tony's pants.
Laura's stance did not discourage Tony from visiting the downsized family in his free time.
"Don't worry, sweetheart. Nobody's home," he whispers as he licks into Tony's ear, sending a shiver down Tony's spine.
“I’m always up for a good meal. You cooking?”
"Yup," Bucky confirms. "Think you know by now he's not all that innocent. Don't let that blush fool you, the piece of shit."
"I neither deny nor confirm."
Shuri hesitates for a moment, and takes a glance at T'Challa who was in a conversation with Okoye a few feet away. She looks back at Tony, her cheeky smile disappearing. The princess' words were careful and soft. "The procedure was a success. Sergeant Barnes is no longer responding to the trigger words and poses no threat to anyone. In fact, I'm going to have to leave you right now."
"Oh. Is he .. is he in trouble?"
He was still impressed with himself nonetheless, allowing the proverbially pat on the back, but things could easily turn ugly within the next few seconds.
"Work from there," Sam adds. "Break ups are tough on anyone, Steve. You'll figure it out."
Steve kisses Tony again, quicker than the last before turning to the old man in a FedEx cap and sunglasses. “What do we have here?” Steve asks, more to Peter than to the man holding the package.
"And Tony?"
"He threw it all away Clint. The long and short of it all, is Steve Rogers had tunnel vision the moment he knew Barnes was alive. Everything we stood for, the peace we fought to protect didn't deserve a second thought or a fucking table discussion. It started and ended with Bucky
In the beginning, Steve would blush and squirm and tried his darnest best to avoid the topic altogether whenever Sam teased him on it, preferring to forget the scene of Sam walking in on Tony in all his naked glory folding Steve in half, thrusting his hips hard to the rhythm of Steve whimpering and begging for
Nobody spoke of that night ever again probably because none of them can properly recall what happened, but Sam remembers very well how he had to elbow his dork of a friend multiple times (it was like hurling your arm against a stone wall, painfully) to stop Steve from self-combusting with jealousy.
Whenever he visited, he spent a good amount of time within the household. Tony got some elbow grease in, fixing whatever mechanics that needed repairing or improvement. The kitchen, the barn. He did some wood work, but could never seem to bring himself to finish his pile. It was an inner struggle, rather than a physical one. Tony would rather admit it was his physical injuries, even his
"It’s really okay, Mr. Stark, there’s nothing to be ashamed of. I mean just look at him. He's literally the pinnacle of human perfection, he's a war hero, he's handsome and so ripped -”
"He's everything you've read in the history books about, basically. The internet's crazy though, don't go there," Tony adds.
Tony finally breathes properly, slapping his forehead in relief.

Tony Stark, not so much.
Peter immediately found strength and made grabby hands when he realizes who was coming from behind his Daddy. “Papa Papa! Daddy’s got a present!”
and given up his Avenging, bow and arrows and life on the run under heavy gunfire, to instead wield a kitchen knife and occasionally suffer the wrath of a malfunctioning power tool. Laura's biggest regret, she told Tony, was that Clint needed to be the father their kids would grow up knowing.
One of the many enhancements the super soldier serum had brought onto Steve was eiditic memory.
He glares at Strange but out of courtesy to his host, Steve stretches his cheeks into something that resembled a smirk of a dying cat. When he turns to Tony, he smiles with his eyes. He kisses Tony sweetly. “Ready to go?” he asks his partner, and shoots another look to the Dr.
arm-twisted.
"Hm. You know, I haven't even had my breakfast."
himself. How about that. Yet he had the galls to -"
Steve could see Bruce watching them, but since Tony and Steve had always had a thing the rest of the team called "bromance", Steve was not too concerned. He ended up supplying the two scientists with hot beverages and plates of sandwiches as they worked, just to be near Tony even for the briefest of moments.
It pleased Tony.
Tony grins and heavily nods into Steve's belly.
“No no no stay please,” Tony blurts, reaching out to grab Steve’s bicep. “I was just. It’s not you, god, please don’t go. It’s just early - for me - and I haven’t had coffee. And you're you. You’re in my bed. Naked. My uh brain just needs to catch up.”
Sam picks up the box and opens it as he speaks. He regrets it immediately, noticing that the sex toy was definitely made for Steve's eyes only. It was made of glass, in Tony's trademark colours of shiny red and gold with the finger loop that engraved the words
Steve nods. "Could we have some privacy please before we comm you fellas back in to get us?"
"Michelle told us," Peter quips.
because of it," Sam says, measuring two scenarios in his head. "On the other hand, Tony thought -

"It's an

Sam leans foward, leaning an elbow on a folded knee. "How does he fit in all of that?"
way,” Tony considers, trying to hide the guilt in his tone. "What can I say, I married a young one. He has needs,” Tony says casually, tossing a blueberry into his mouth before clasping the container shut. "Besides you keep giving us that crap-ass room at the very top of this fun house, it hurts my knees."
"Team Stark huh? God I love you. Will that be all, Ms. Potts?"
Aside from disagreeing over everything micro and macro, it was impossible for Tony to imagine Steve to ever purposely hurting him. Steve orbited him like the sun and treated him like a fragile flower petal, mostly so due to his super strength. Even though sex between them was explosive; because Steve had an insatiable appetite for pleasure, Tony had to constantly find creative ways to keep his lover satisfied. Dating an enhanced human who bottomed meant Tony had to always keep up, literally,  or find alternative measures because Steve could go a few rounds in one night and would still want more in the morning.

Two days later, General Okoye arrives at the Stark mansion to personally collect the billionaire. After a brief chat indoors, they finally move to leave the estate with Pepper accompanying them to an unmarked car driven by the Wakandan herself. The redhead-turned-blonde looks on worriedly as Tony walks towards the opened passenger door leaving with nothing but a casual jacket on his back, white t-shirt and dark jeans, and a pair of red-tinted aviators. At least FRIDAY was online with Tony and would be able to send the CEO live feeds of Tony's vital signs, so that offered some form of comfort.
He grips them hard, still counting in his head, and remembers the day Steve gave them to him.
"By the way Doc, can you portal me to Wakanda after this? I might need Shuri to give me another brain wipe to get that image-"
. He would never reveal it was painful memories breaking his heart.
"He knows," Sam sing-songs.
“It gets hot out here this time of the year, you might want to come ins---"
"I've been reading about anxiety and ways to deal with it and I came across this really cool calming gif the other day. I wanted to send it to you because it's a cat gif and you like cats and all you gotta do is match your breathing with the cat swaying when it feels like too much," Peter cooly rolls his shoulders and swings from side to side, describing. "But then Aunt May barges in and started screaming about my room and threatened to burn the Spider-Man suit if I didn't clean the mess so I totally forgot about this -"
Check, check, and check.
"That's not an answer, Tony. Just remember what I told you, alright? We're here. I swear it Tony I'll put on the Rescue suit if you so much as break a nail. You hear me? Jim and I will take our suits to Wakanda, AND we'll bring Veronica."
. I wasn't."
“No, no they’ve been doing these services before. To, you know, remember the soldiers who were identified and fought in the 2nd Titan wave - the ones who came back, the ones who never did. Jim goes to most of them, he will be in this one as well. I'm know this one has a special mention for Sam, honouring his service in the Army and with the Avengers and I would really like to be there. But the the whole 'the First Avenger making a rare appearance' news makes me uncomfortable - it's not about me at all. What if someone tracks me back here?"
As though his brain was actually thinking out loud, the national icon stirs. Tony’s breathe hitches and he held it in, as the solid back muscles twitched and moved, a sign that his bed partner was rousing from sleep.
Tony chuckles, and he falls flat on his back onto the bed. Pepper follows suit, and they stare at the ceiling together like teenagers hopefully dreaming of a far away future.
Tony shivers at the memories and steps out of the armour, piece by piece, and takes a long, deep breathe of fresh air. His mind fought to be at ease, but he was feeling much better with his limbs free from the encasing metal. Yet at the back of his throat, Tony desperately needs to vomit. As soon as Tony steps through the entrance of his penthouse, he was ready to lift his shirt over his head and get into the shower but his halts as his eye caught sight of a familiar redhead.
I kicked everyone off the corner to make room for you. Point Break only came by because he felt sorry for me that you didn't turn up!"
As if their brutal fall out was not punishment enough, his mind appears to be hardwired to project image after image, memory after memory of the genius engineer even at the slightest mind drift. It was a reoccurring theme; every smile, every fight, every chance he had
didn't go down so well," Tony says, jogging through the words. "You already know about that."
Steve could never break the phone. He held the clamshell like a lifeline. It was his only material connection to Tony.
“But I do have some leftover takeout in my suite that could feed a whole village. Or a hungry supersoldier. It’s Chinese, and don’t worry there are tons of those springrolls that you love, those little dumplings that burst in your mouth, there’s the noodles you can’t pronounce…”
to serve my country, to protect those in need. I was given the ability to do what most people can't, so unlike Tony I wasn't born with this," Steve says, displaying himself - physically perfect and deadly. "When I signed up for Rebirth, I made a conscious choice. This is my purpose, this is what I'm meant to do."
“'S your unlucky night, Tony. Don’t have one,” Steve says, shrugging Tony off. He takes another gulp of his beverage to play it cool.
, as Clint would term it - even though the countless drafts and unsent copies that laid waste on the floor of their base camps told a different story.
Tony whistled, crossing his arms and leaning against the large couch as his eyes scanned the half naked perfect specimen from top to bottom.
"On your side, sweetheart," Steve murmurs with a curl on his lips as he easily manhandles Tony.
"No, hang on a minute – I’m not, I’m not kicking you out. You don't have to go. I just, I just don't feel so good right now.”
The patch of grass had regrown beautifully, leaving no evidence or trail of the trauma it once endured from scorching repulser burns.
he first thing he asked me was whether I did pilates as a workout and in the same sentence he mocked me for being old. I didn't know what pilates was but I knew he was being an ass and it was infuriating."

"What if I dont Pep? What if it all goes to shit again?"
"STEVE!"

"Why does it feel like you're planning on going on the run again?"
Tony grins.
Stephen narrows his eyes suspiciously. “I thought you said he
"What
"Steve please, don't."
When he tries to pry his shoulder from leather of the couch to at least prop himself up, Tony feels sticky, sore all over. He wonders how Steve was going to react when he wakes up. Was he going to freak out? Will he regret the things he let Tony do to him? Would he want more?
Tony couldn’t help but wave back. His eyes were warming up now.
From memory.
All those years displaying himself like a peacock for Steve's attention.
"I know. I know I left," he whispered, begged. "I know I have no right to, to do this. I can't help it."
"Sounds like someone else I know very well. I think
Tony lowers the half-drank coffee mug and places it on the table next to him. Only then did he notice the mug was red, white and blue with a
Alas, crickets.
The day Steve turned up at the Tower three weeks after SHIELD had fallen, with a duffel bag over his broad shoulder, a stupidly handsome smile and with an acceptance (finally!) of Tony's offer to move into the apartment Tony had built for him couple of years prior, Tony was smitten. Newly singled at the time, he wasn't even sure what that whirl in his belly was when he saw Steve that day. He dated women only in the past. He'd notice men too, but not like this.
"Maybe. Yes? I mean you know what - we don't have to talk about that now. Sorry. Massive amount of blood just travelled south because, damn.
"where?" calmly.
Never mind that he was the Team Leader of Earth's Mightiest Heroes - when it came to Tony and sex, Steve
Tony's hands flashed yellow, before the device began to ring.
"Thanks, Fry" Tony manages, as his AI continues to update him on his vital signs. He feels bad for tuning her out, but he was unable to register her words for longer than a few seconds. His attention was glued to the high-rise before him.
“Let me put Peter to bed,” Steve says, breaking the mini makeout session. “And then, Mr. Stark, you and I have got some unfinished business to attend to.”
Tony couldn’t help but smile into the soft kiss that lands on his lips, melting as he sucks the air out of the blond's lungs. “Good morning beloved” he whisperes.
It was only far into their relationship that Steve finally agreed to penetrate Tony, after the older man assured and assured and
Shuri laughs and takes one glance at her brother, the King, who pretended to be affronted by the idea of his baby sister dating. "Why, do you have a son, Mr. Stark?"
"You're his family, Barnes, like it or not-"
Наталья, остановись.
The serum transformed Steve Rogers into a super soldier and a true master tactician.
Peter has a hard frown on his face now, his lips pressed to a thin line. He opens his mouth, and shut its. He tries again. "You just said that Cap and you..." Tony nods his head firmly. "But you weren't...?" The genius shakes his head, a smile forming in his face now as he licks his lower lip.
So Steve's main issue was the safety and privacy of his family. Unsurprising, since Tony and Steve became America's, possibly the world's highest profiled couple when the news broke that the two of them had married.
"Say, uh. How's it going with Barnes? You managed to figure out a way to rejig his brain yet?"
But Tony would never tell.
The nurses and doctors were visibly nervous - they were dealing with one of the most powerful persons in the world in his most delicate, vulnerable mental state and for a moment they merely stood by and watched as Tony sobbed in the corner of his private ward in a blood-stained hospital garb. Eventually all it took for Tony to calm down was Pepper Potts kneeling in front of him and carefully handing him what he was desperately looking for.
"Uh huh," Tony replies, almost whiny, childlike. "Want you to fuck me hard baby."
when we have Peter with us. I won't, I can't risk it. Anything happens,
” Tony begins to read but stops midway. He clears his throat and decides against vocalizing the rest of the invitation, careful not to trigger his anxiety. “This is a big, huge deal, babe. You have to go,” Tony says, as he approaches the bathroom.
Later that same day, Sam caught Steve balancing a laptop on his knees and venturing onto the internet all by himself looking up for gifts for his boyfriend, one tab even said Customized Coffee Mugs (Romantic). Of course Steve comedically shut the screen of the computer like a teenager caught watching porn the second his super senses picked up Sam watching him.
seconds ago. Damn it Stevie, if you keep cleaning up this place every goddamn minute,
"Gosh the two of you as a couple? Yeeesh that gives me the heeby-jeebies. I always joked about the two of you being Mom and Dad. I guess Nat owes me money."
Tony’s smile drops instantly, the news hitting too close to home for them, more so for him. “You’re kidding,” Tony says in disbelief. Steve winces as he makes eye contact and shakes his head sadly, a strand of his blond locks falling over his forehead. “ You’re
Steve was still unmoved, though Tony can feel him shaking.
"I'm 16."
"Where were you?" Peter redirects, fully embarrassed now.
“Let me,” Tony said, kissing the tip of Steve’s nose. “Think.” Then below Steve’s left eye. “About it.” Tony’s chastely pressed his lips against Steve’s and it quickly became open-mouthed. They kissed hungrily, devouring each other's tongues like a main course. After a while, Tony pushed at Steve's chest to communicate, breaking the kiss.
Tony takes in a deep breath. "Are you happy with ...
"Tony, the Accords and Barnes are two--"
"Steve I didn't kill him"
"I wanna come Steve, please please let me come," Tony starts to beg, the first time he's letting go of control since he brought them down this path and crossing the rubicon forever. "Touch me baby, please."
The words shot up into his head, sending him to subspace.
"Don't suppose you've got lube stashed somewhere in that fancy coat of yours," Bucky says with a straight face, rolling his shoulder and flexing his cybernetic limb.
Poor behaviour such as confessing your feelings to the love of your life, and being able to back-pedal if you don't receive the desired reaction.
Tony bit his quivering lower lip and continued to scream internally as his hands began to tremor. To keep the phone from sliding off, he pushed the receiver close to his temple with just two fingers and held the phone far away as possible from his face as though the device would burn right through his skin on contact.
Steve apologised for losing his cool earlier that evening, for violently displaying his super strength at the wake of it.
"Besides, I may have found a way to keep Mr. Hyde away for good."
"I'm sorry I made you feel that way," he coos. "Well, technically, sorry not sorry."
“Steve. Baby. Stop it. Don’t go Alpha male on him,” Tony warns, an edge to his voice that instantly deflates his husband. "I'm actually impressed by what a terribly jealous man you are, Cap. Who would have thought. Any other mean streaks I need to know about that should have been in the pre-nup?”
He bit his tongue instead.
Steve quickly checks the invitation card he had slotted into his jacket, glances at the grandfather's clock at the corner and tells Tony that they were supposed to be at the church
"How, though?" Natasha asks, still grinning, still in shock. "That's impossible, wouldn't JARVIS-"
Peter laughs, rubs his nose a little. "That's so weird. You're old enough to be my dad. Can't. Won't do it."
Steve was on the other side of the door, waiting.
, you do that again and I'll float a red balloon across your face every time you have sex."
"Can we skip to your other promise please?" Steve breathed, before he returned the kiss, filthy and desperate.

Tony shakes his head. "Nope. Absolutely not. No.
“I wanna talk to you about something. About why I've been cancelling out on you a lot these days, why I've been disappearing without so much as a phone call. And uh, mainly about
The one and only secret that Steve has that mattered was one he couldn't share with Tony.
He taps Toy’s leg to motion him to move, but Tony was relentless. He keeps Steve in position, planting a hand over Steve’s broad chest. Truthfully Steve could easily overpower him, but the captain was not really putting up a fight here. He becomes boneless when Tony starts to grind into him, rolling his hips against Steve's crotch seductively.
Tony remembers a Patek Phillipe pocket watch, his Starkphone, maybe couple of hundred Euros but he says nothing. He had bigger concerns. He needed to get 220lbs of muscle off of him because he was slowly losing the feel of his legs.
- I took yours, Tony. These hands - they did it. You can't pretend that doesn't bother you at all."
Eighty – “Are you…”
Tony, at that moment, swam in the thought about his decision of giving up Avenging once they had finally won the battle with Thanos. At the very end, despite their best efforts to set things right, the dusting was not completely reversible - the half of humanity that vanished did not all return. It was a devastating outcome all the same for the Avengers who naively expected a clean victory.
Steve hesitates for a split second.
“You guys talk though, right? About stuff you’re comfortable doing, stuff he likes, or doesn’t like. Talk to him, talk about boundaries and all that jazz. He gave you a butt plug for your birthday – which was a week ago – and you haven’t talked to him about it since?” Sam queries.
Tony composed himself and shook his head. The stubborn man needed to have his way, as usual. "Ross said.."
Under the moonlight, Steve could see a smirk growing across the Black Widow's full lips.
Their mouths meet again, and Tony kisses him heavily, roughly.
Steve’s eyes pop. “
"Take the suit with you when you go to him. Don't let him sweet-talk you into anything. Don't beat the crap out of each other again either. You will be okay Tony, you'll figure it out and come on top of this like you always do."
"He’d asked me to marry him. And I said no.”
This kiss was a full of promise.

Outside the bedroom, Steve was less casual with pet-names, even after all the years in between them. During their lovemaking though, Steve was anything but reserved - he was a dirty talker.
that mouth.
"He's waiting for me in my lab downstairs. Good luck with your meeting, Mr. Stark. I know the Captain is very eager to see you."
"We have gay people in Queens, Mr Stark," Peter suddenly says, very assuringly. “It’s okay, there’s nothing wrong with being in love with another man. I think it’s pretty cool, I mean – Captain America and Iron man. Wow. There are tons of people out there who's been shipping you guys for years.”
Steve quickly read that Tony didn’t come by to listen to an extension of his earlier speech.
Tony kicks his heel in the dirt.
"Then they're not for you."
"Rogers," Natasha warns playfully, breaking the stillness of the night.
couldn't agree on what we wanted out of the uh relationship."

Steve brings his hand between them and finally takes them both.

"Tony, Ross wants you locked up because of him. Sneaking around the globe for a secret rendezvous is .... a tad romantic I guess. I mean," Pepper says, considering their options in her brain. "It's not
Sam also remembers watching Steve fidget in his seat when Thor got a little handsy with Tony the night before he left to travel the Nine realms. It was a full house event; even Clint made an appearance that evening so it quickly became some sort of a going-away party for both Hawkeye and Thor. The God of Thunder ended up on the karaoke machine most of the night, getting all the words wrong but handling the mic like a champ no less. Tony was the next mic hogger unsurprisingly, but unlike Thor, Tony could actually sing very,
"He told me I can
This makes Steve laugh into his beer as he tilts the bottle for a drink. It was the way Tony had said it, with his fingers dancing in front of Steve’s face accompanied by a deep, mysterious tone to his voice. It reminds Steve of a character from Sesame Street, the Count, and the lengthy conversation he's had with Tony over breakfast one morning as to why Sesame Street and the Muppets are not one and the same.
And yet the device he held in his hand, the obsolete piece of technology much like his being, kept close to his person at all times, remained silent. The countless moments he thought the phone had been switched off, under-charged,
This turn of events was, to say the least, confusing.
Clint smirks.

were the cause of it? That was something else entirely."
Within seconds, his lungs feels better already. He lets out a chuckle.
In any case, the way they behaved and orbited hardly counts as a healthy relationship.
Tony leans a shoulder against the wall. “You think this is a trap?”
Pepper nudges for more.
So it wasn't particularly vengeance or jealousy that fuelled Tony at that moment, yet he couldn't place a finger on why he felt so apprehensive. Perhaps arranging their reunion so close by to where Barnes physical was, was a move that came too soon. Now, 11 months after Siberia, they were finally due to reunite and talk about the hows, the whys, and the what nows.
Tony stilled.
think about it, she didn’t exactly say no. She just doesn’t see a point of it all, getting hitched. Given our lifestyle. What we do. She says she’s happy, she loves me, she’ll consider us adopting one day if that’s what we both want but marriage is-“
