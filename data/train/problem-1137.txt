John braced both elbows on his parted knees and looked down at the rug beneath his feet.
Leaning up against a nearby tree John had tried to fight back the tears he could feel building; knowing that if he gave in now he would likely not stop. He had to get out of the park before Sherlock discovered him. He couldn’t possibly survive having Sherlock deduce the fact that he’d been spying on him and he definitely couldn’t bear to have Sherlock realize what his spying had wrought.
It was only the memory of that last day and the shame he still felt about what he’d done to his friend that stopped him.
Then of course Mary had shot Sherlock and John’s world had abruptly folded, scattering and falling apart like the precarious house of cards that it was.
He jerks out of that particular train of thought as the bus pulls up to the next stop.
Do your fucking job and don’t think about it.
Ironically enough it was his sister that had tracked him down.  How she’d found him he’d never know and he hadn’t bothered to ask. She’d cleaned him up and listened to the whole sorry tale and then she’d sat him down and given him a dose of tough love that John could barely credit coming from his usually dysfunctional sister.
Johns brow furrowed at Sherlocks’ words; not really understanding his reference to Moriarty.
And please... reviews are the only currency that a fanfic author gets, so any that you leave is often the only encouragement or acknowledgment we get to let us know that there are readers out there.
Carefully shielding his relief at her words, John reached down and helped her up from the chair she’d occupied while waiting for him. Kissing her lightly on the cheek, he guided her towards the clinic doors.
He swallowed hard and licked his lips.
As devastating as all that had been, it had been Sherlock’s final parting shot that had put the last nail in the friendship.
“Fuck!”
Except apparently he had, he’d just been too nearsighted to see it.
“You don’t get to just assault me and storm out anymore. I’m not your bleeding flatmate or even your friend any longer, so you can go sit the fuck down in the lounge and explain to me what the hell you are thinking with that big brain of yours.”
And now he was imagining all the things he’d never dared to think about when he’d lived with Sherlock. And the absolute worst part; to help said imagination John now had a very vivid memory of just how Sherlock looked kissing the blond he had seen in the park.
His statement was met by two eerily similar raised eyebrows, and John found himself once again trying to control his temper.
“Thanks for that by the way... don’t know what that total load of utter bollocks was all about but tah. So anyway I went home and pretty much from the first night I knew it wasn’t gonna work. Then the cafe thing with you happened and all I could think about was what a complete arsehole I’d been not see how much I’d been hurting you all along....”
He knew he would have to talk to Sherlock at some point as well, but at the moment he didn’t think he could face the other man without either breaking down, or punching the bloody fuck out of him.
He’d had everything he wanted right in front of him and he’d fucked it all up because he was so set on being everything his sister wasn’t.
Apparently as far as Sherlock was concerned John Watson didn’t care about Sherlock Holmes. John Watson saw him as a friend and no more because John Watson wasn’t capable of seeing beyond his own narrow view of the world.  And in that world Sherlock Holmes was an asexual creature that lived only for his next case and the praise of his one and only friend. And the worst part of the whole thing; was that according to Sherlock it was apparently the way John wanted it.
Sherlock beamed down at him and swooped in again to take John’s mouth, in if it was possible, an even more enthusiastic kiss.
Sherlock had said right from the start that he was Married to his work and the relationships were not his area, so John had no one else but himself to blame if he’d gotten his hopes up.
Sherlock hesitated and for a moment John thought he wasn’t going to answer.
“God, you are insufferable.” Sherlock huffed.  “Listen to me brother mine, James Moriarty is dead. Molly herself did the autopsy and substituted his body for mine. He is not coming back and I find your unnecessary paranoia tiresome in the extreme. Yes I will admit that on the surface, this seems without a doubt to be Moriarty, but what you seem unable to grasp is that whoever orchestrated this is not playing the same game at all.”
“Look Sherlock, it doesn’t matter what Mycroft said or didn’t say... that was ages ago.” He offered, trying to seem unbothered while giving his former friend an out.
John knew he looked terrible, he didn’t need the others barely concealed shock to tell him that. He’d lost way too much weight over the last nine months and the tired lines and bags under his eyes made him look and feel like the old man he was rapidly becoming.
He glanced up and met Sherlock’s aloof gaze.
“Just tell me that he’s really happy... that he’s doing all right and I promise I’ll leave it at that, okay?”
Opening the door to the flat he called out Mary’s name on the oft chance she hadn’t left for her appointment. When she didn’t answer he found himself once again wondering why she’d failed to answer her phone when she was so quick to always insist that he make sure his phone was charged and on him in at all times.
“Why are you not more upset that Mary has been taken into custody?”
“Hold that thought” he ordered. “Back in a tick”.
John stared at the phone in his hands for a good ten minutes.
Grabbing Julia’s bottle from the sideboard he scooped her into his arms and gave it to her. All the while keeping a wary eye on Sherlock; knowing that he’d still be likely to bolt at the first opportunity.
He wrapped both arms around himself; his body language along with his one word entirely defensive, and John felt something in his heart strain as if to break.
“No... ah yes oh God... Sherlock what the hell? What about your boyfriend?”
“I stopped loving Mary the night she put a bullet in your chest... Actually that’s not quite accurate... I stopped thinking I was in love with her that night, if I ever really was.” He looked down at the child in his arms and smiled wistfully.
“Sherlock, just so there are no more misunderstandings here... I have to tell you that I am not only very much in love with you, but I rather urgently want to say fuck it all and take you to bed.”
“Going back to Mary was the hardest thing I’d ever done, but I kept telling myself that it was the right thing to do for the baby’s sake. I knew that I didn’t love her, not like I was supposed to, but you kept saying that she was what I wanted and that eventually I’d forgive her.” He shot Sherlock a glare.
And with those words he turned and left both the cafe and John’s life.
“Yes the tape and the taunting were designed to keep me from the mission; that much is obvious.  But you were not on Bart’s roof that last day brother dear.  James Moriarty, while undoubtedly brilliant was also quite possibly clinically insane, and consequentially quite easily bored. He would not have the patience for such a long game. Especially not one that involved the destruction of the bulk of his criminal network.”
Watching Sherlock’s hands creep up into the other mans hair was the single most painful thing he had ever experienced and it finally hit him; that the reason he felt this way was because regardless of his own self delusion, he was very much in love with Sherlock Holmes and he probably always had been.
Sherlock had been beautiful and sensual without even realizing it and it was only natural that John would notice; there was nothing wrong with admiring Sherlocks looks, it didn’t mean he wanted him in that way, it was just that Sherlock was so extraordinary that even with as straight as John was he could still appreciate him; in much the same way as he would a piece of art or a magnificent animal. Finding someone attractive didn’t mean you wanted to sleep with them.
Maybe all that stuff she told the papers about him was true. Maybe it wasn’t a coincidence that Mary shot him the same night John had told her that Janine and Sherlock were seeing each other?
When John tried to argue the fact that it wasn’t Mycroft’s place to decide that for Sherlock, Mycroft had stilled and given John the first glimpse he’d truly seen of the real Mycroft Holmes and the true reason he practically ran the country.
He said it was then that he’d realized how stupid he’d been to believe that John cared in any way that was comparable to the way Sherlock had cared for him. And that he no longer wished to be any part of John’s life. That in fact; being in John’s life could and had only proved to be ultimately toxic to his own.
Sherlock’s expression was rueful as his gaze rose to meet John’s; before once again dropping to hide his expression.
“I love you John Watson and the thought of you not being in the world somewhere is simply unthinkable.” His mouth turned down in a grimace, his expression apologetic as he continued.
“I had for most of my life believed I could live without sentiment; so it wasn’t until Moriarty threatened your life on the roof of Bart’s that I understood that what I felt for you was far past my control” he admitted looking down; his expression hidden behind the veil of his lashes.
So now he was stuck in a marriage that he resented with a woman he no longer trusted and about to become a father to a child he wasn’t even sure he wanted.
Thirty minutes later John finally made it into the clinic.
marriage should b terminated by now
“Your room or mine?”
He admitted that he’d actively encouraged John to go back to her, because he’d loved John so much that the only thing he’d wanted for him was for John to be happy; that John’s happiness was more important to Sherlock than his own, because he’d believed deep down that John would only have done the same for him.
John had been both infuriated and devastated by his friend’s harsh words and nearly speechless with rage at his insinuation that John’s willingness to share a flat with Sherlock; was only because he secretly wanted to bed the man.
He loved this man more than his own life, now it was time for him to prove it.
Early on a Friday morning, barely two weeks after his Christmas day reconciliation with his pregnant wife; John Watson’s life unexpectedly changes again.
“God Sherlock...”he sighed.  “We are both equally guilty of being clueless... and we are definitely going to have to talk about both your decision making and communication skills at some point; at which time I am very possibly going to yell quite a bit... but all that can wait.”
Sherlock was sitting on the bench as just as John had guessed, what he hadn’t guessed was that he was not alone.
It doesn’t matter how many times he’s gone over it in his head; he still can’t understand why Sherlock has gone to so much trouble to make sure that John and Mary stay together. And yes, he knows Sherlock loves him in his own way; he’d more or less confessed that very thing at John’s wedding.
All this time later and even after everything Sherlock had done for him, John still couldn’t bring himself to think about the expression he thought he’d seen on Sherlock’s face the night of Johns wedding.
“By the time I realized what a cold bitch she was I knew I couldn’t just walk out. I couldn’t leave Julia with her and she’d made it crystal clear that all it would take was a DNA test to make sure I had no right to access. She might not be my baby but I couldn’t just leave her with Mary. And really what did it matter... you were gone and my fucked up situation was my own fault. So I decided to just get on with it yeah.”
“Sherlock, we need to talk.”
“As you know I have often decried the sentiment inherent in most relationships, but it seems where you are concerned I find myself just as pathetic as any other lovesick fool.  I now appreciate what it is to love someone to the extent that the others happiness becomes more important than your own”.
“So what... you decided staying with a woman you no longer love and raising someone else’s child was the thing to do?” cut in Sherlock sarcastically.
And John could see it now. Sherlock Holmes was really very upset. He was also on the verge of tears and barely holding his own anger and hurt in check.
Three hours later John was jerked awake from a very uncomfortable doze in his armchair to someone pounding on his front door.
John wishes he could stop thinking this way. He wants to put his suspicion and distrust of his wife away. He needs to find a way to love her again; or at the very least be able to tolerate this marriage that he chose.
Sherlocks’ eyes widened again at Johns’ words but the blaze of joy that lit his features was unmistakable.
Opening the door with his key his only thought was of the drink he badly wants and the five minutes of downtime that he’s unlikely to get.
He was going to be a father and his wife was a lying former assassin who he didn’t trust. And to top it off, he was pretty sure he was in love with his best friend; the friend that had done everything in his power; up to and including murder, to ensure his marriage to said lying assassin could continue.
It was Sherlocks’ continued intent to forgive and forget and his encouragement for John to do the same that had finally made John admit what he hadn’t wanted to.
And at the time he’d thought he’d managed it. He thought he’d got it all under control. But of course all that was before he found out that it was Mary who had pulled the trigger.
Cursing himself as seven kinds of stupid, John edged into the bushes and made his way around to the far side of the open space where he knew Sherlock was sitting.
He shook his head and tried reign in his temper. There was no use going off at Mrs Hudson, it wasn’t her fault Sherlock was being an arse.
Tonight though... well tonight he was going to have a conversation with a certain consulting detective. And if he didn’t like the answers... well he’d just have to see, he supposed.
Shaking his head to clear his troubled thoughts, John rubbed at his eyes and tried to focus on the world outside the windows of the bus and the distance he’d left to travel.
When Julia Watson woke up for her bottle four hours later it was to a very very tired and extremely happy John. Fortunately she was much too young to wonder why her daddy was being accompanied by a man wearing a sheet and little else.
“Yeah I was getting to that part” he sighed.
“Oh do calm down Mycroft. I have told you more than once, that I confirmed it myself.  Moriarty is very much a corpse, and whoever has set up the latest game, it is most definitely not James Moriarty.
Sherlocks eyes darkened with some emotion that John couldn’t begin to interpret, though the slight stiffening of his body told John that whatever it was that the other man was remembering, it wasn’t pleasant.
There was no way he was letting Sherlock leave the flat until he found out just what the hell was going on.
There had been a moment at his wedding just after Sherlock had played the violin piece he’d written, where for a brief instant he’d thought he’d seen something in Sherlocks expression. A sadness and longing, which had made John’s heart, leap in his chest. But when Sherlock had urged him and Mary to take to the dance floor only moments later, John told himself he was imagining things. And when Sherlock had grinned at his joke, John deliberately pushed the incident out of his mind, all the while berating himself for clearly drinking far too much champagne.
Had Sherlocks’ hunting down and the destruction of Moriarty’s web remade him into a different person? One that was far closer to the sociopath that he’d always claimed to be.
As far as Mycroft Holmes was concerned, John had done all the damage he was ever going to do to Sherlock and he added that if he had any residual respect and compassion for the man, then he would leave Sherlock to get on with his life.
“Why should my brothers’ happiness concern you? More to the point why would you care?” Mycroft asked his tone sharp.
When Sherlocks lips met his something inside John let out a victorious whoop, even as all thoughts beside the feel of Sherlock’s mouth on his fled.
What about Irene Adler? He seemed pretty interested in her. And then there was that whole thing with Janine?
“You are the only person that I have ever wanted in that way and you are still the only one I want”. He confessed shyly.
So aside from his one lonely emotional outburst at Sherlocks’ grave, John did the only thing he could do to get through his loss. He took a leaf out of Sherlocks’ book and tried to delete everything that wasn’t about his respect and friendship for the other man.
“I really couldn’t say” Mycroft offered in his haughtiest tone.
Sherlock’s hand withdrew and John actually whimpered.
“Fuck”.
“First up, I’m not a bloody visitor, I’m his best friend, and secondly Mrs Hudson, if his lordship wants’ me to bugger off he can come down here and tell me himself, the great git.”
“Anyway he was right to threaten me with Mary’s arrest, not that it was the reason I stayed away. He’d said a few things that I happened to agree with when I’d had time to think about them and that’s all you need to know as far as that goes. Now... why are you here? Did you just come by to ask me about Mary’s arrest? Or was there something else you wanted?”
Loving you may have been the single most painful experience of my life John Watson, but at least now I can be relatively sure that I can love... and regardless of what my brother believes, for that alone I must thank you. I wish you and Mary joy of each other. Goodbye.
“Okay... I’m going to speak now and I need you to not say a word until I finish... Okay?”
“Well considering that I arranged for it to happen in the first place it’d be a bit daft if I was upset now, wouldn’t it.
Johns head was spinning with the knowledge that he was about to experience something that he been sure he’d never have the privilege of knowing. He was going to have sex with Sherlock Holmes, something he never would have dreamt of before today. Sure he’d had fantasies; truth be told he’s had some fairly intense wanks to said fantasies. But hot sweaty sex after the adrenalin of a case, was a far cry from declarations of love and the promise of actual real lovemaking.  And yet even that familiar term doesn’t seem to really encompass what they are about to do.
Sherlock frowned.
“John Watson you are an idiot”
“But something changed... it must have. Lestrade arrested her tonight and you said you were the one who organized it. So why... what changed your mind?
Stunned at that revelation John had reeled under Sherlock’s next admission, that that it was only after he had shot Magnussen and been about to leave for his ‘trip ‘ to Serbia that he had finally seen what Mycroft had been trying to tell him ever since he’d returned home after the fall.
He watched her face carefully as he spoke, wondering if she’d slip and give a hint of the truth, if there might be a flicker of guilt brought about by his words.
That of course led to the realization that if what he’d felt for Mary was obviously not unconditional, then he’d clearly married her for all the wrong reasons.
“Really? You mean that?”
Crossing the road to catch another back to his and Mary’s flat, John tries very hard to keep his thoughts from wandering to places he doesn’t want them to go.
John had sat stunned at the table for a good half an hour. He still didn’t completely understand what the hell had just happened and he sure as hell didn’t know what to do about it. He was also rather shocked that he’d sat through everything Sherlock had said, without saying a word to refute the other mans accusations.
He sniffed disdainfully.
“Well in this particular instant I can honestly say you are most welcome. I will be sure to keep you updated on Mrs Watson’s progress, but I rather think you have seen the last of her. Now I think that concludes our business, so I’ll be off. I have a somewhat pressing situation in China that needs my attention.”
“I am deeply sorry that I have upset you John, but I did not intend for it to happen...”
“Snipers John: three of them to be precise. One for each of the people that Moriarty deemed important to me.” He offered bluntly.
The only part of the plan that he hadn’t liked was the part that involved Mycroft Holmes and Greg Lestrade. Unfortunately, for the plan to work he’d needed the information that only Mycroft would have and he’d needed Lestrade to be the one to finalize it.
“Well if certain people bothered to let other people know what the actual hell is going on, then there wouldn’t have been a need for lurking  snooping  or any other form of covert spying, now would there”.
“Are you sure you want me to stop?” asked Sherlock with a pointed and knowing glance in the direction of John’s pants.
John sighed wearily at the other mans snide tone and reminded himself that it was only due to Mycroft that he was finally free.
John had loved Sherlock for such a very long time; including the wanting part of that love; but he’d always been so sure that Sherlock didn’t feel that way about anybody, let alone him. Now that this was happening it seemed somehow larger than just lovemaking. Like everything else with this impossibly brilliant man, this seemed better and more intense than anything he had ever experienced with anyone else.
“But why would you even do this John? It’s obvious that you loved her enough to stay with her even after you found out the child wasn’t yours. Why have her arrested at this late stage?”
John scowled.
John ran a hand through his hair and scrubbed wildly at his face in an effort to shake himself loose from his thoughts.
Unfortunately for John, Mary had beaten him there.
“I’ll text you if I get held up, but I should be home by nine at the latest. And don’t forget to take the phone with you this time.” He added in a teasing manner.
Laying alongside the man he loved John marvelled at the emotion he could see in the detectives eyes. Never in his life could he remember anyone looking at him the way Sherlock was.
With Moriarty’s supposed return he’d hardly seen Sherlock since that day, but it still hadn’t stopped Mary from making several careless and offhand remarks about cats with nine lives and Sherlock having the luck of the devil.
Fact; John Watson had always believed in Sherlock Holmes. So if faking his death and disappearing for three years hadn’t shaken that belief, then he refused to let one text from his lying wife’s dodgy ex do it.
“No matter what you believe, my reasons for returning and staying in the marriage had everything to do with Julia and nothing to do with my wife. Whether you choose to believe that is up to you.”
John moved to the Kitchen and extracted a bottle from the fridge. He placed it in the warmer to heat and then headed for the bedroom.
He’d known that whatever Sherlock had seen on his face that day on the tarmac it was not, no matter what Sherlock might have thought, because John had known of Sherlocks feelings and hadn’t wanted to acknowledge them. Yes he’d known Sherlock was most likely going to say something of importance that day and yes John had flinched from that, but in actual fact he’d just wanted to avoid breaking down in front of Mary and Mycroft.
“There was also the fact that if I did not see... then I would also be less inclined to sabotage the relationship for my own selfish desire to have you return to Baker Street” he admitted somewhat sheepishly.
For nearly nine long months John had lived with the knowledge that he’d broken his best friends’ heart, but the sight of Sherlock in another man’s arms kissing in a way that John had seldom ever been kissed, obliterated every careful barrier he’d put up around his heart and mind.
He scowled before doing an abrupt about face and heading for the front door.
Sometimes he felt just like the mice Sherlock used in his experiments. It was like he was trapped in a maze and every time he thought he’d found a clear path, it suddenly closed, leaving him breathless claustrophobic and unable to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
“What the hell was that for?” John snarled rubbing at his abused jaw.
“Anyway none of that mattered because there was still the baby to think of and I’d already fucked up and lost you, so it didn’t seem like it really mattered if I stayed or not at that point.”
“I also said sex did not alarm me John... I may have not been interested in Victor but I still do know how seduction works.  As a matter of fact I had known Victor since University and it made it quite easy to convince him I was interested in pursuing a more carnal relationship.”
with ur handling of Sherlock’s pet
He smiled apologetically; relaxing internally as he made his very real excuses. The last thing he wanted to do was spend time in his wife’s presence. Especially not after what he’d just found out.
“Because no matter what Sherlock or you may believe; I do want him to be happy. I may have fucked up my own life, but I never wanted to hurt him.”
He’d just slid the draw shut and was in the process of pocketing the keys, when the distinctive chime of Mary’s phone rang out indicating that she had a text.
John stared into Sherlocks’ eyes and waited for Sherlock to answer his unasked question. Knowing that the next few minutes were potentially going to be the some of the most life changing that he’d ever experience, John held the other mans gaze and waited expectantly.
Sherlock’s glare didn’t leave his brothers back as he left the flat, and John winced internally at the expression on the detectives face when he slammed the door behind his brother.
So far she had seemed mollified by his words, but it didn’t stop him wondering if she’d gone home for her phone first; that perhaps all her casual questions had been an attempt to catch him out in a lie.
John chuckled and squeezed her hand, while inside his stomach was roiling with a combination of nerves and revulsion.
“Pardon” Mycroft pinned him with a look.
His expression softened as he met John’s gaze.
“You see but do not observe John. If you had stayed a little longer that day you would have seen Lestrade arrive and arrest the man you had seen me so ardently kissing. The kiss was a ruse to pick his pocket, nothing more. It was a case John not a love affair.”
Pulling it out of his pocket and looking down at the caller id he saw a vaguely familiar number come up on the screen.  Still shaken by his thought’s, it took him a moment to recognize that the number displayed on his phone was that of the clinic where he worked.
John swallowed hard at his question but he refused to flinch as he met the other man’s scornful gaze.
The moan turned into a groan; when encouraged by Sherlock’s verbal clues, John slid a hand down to brush over the now obvious bulge in the detectives’ trousers.
He couldn’t stand to look at her and barely ever touched her. And even the fact that he knew she was most likely having an affair was more of a relief than anything else. At least if she was getting it from somebody not him, he was off the hook. The few times he had managed to fuck her; back when they were both still pretending that everything would be fine, it had made him physically sick afterwards and no amount of hot water could scrub the away the soiled feeling touching her left behind.
It had been barely two days after they had gotten back together before he realized he was pretty damn sure that whatever she might have been, it wasn’t her past leaking through that he’d found attractive. Just the thought of her being capable of pulling a gun on Sherlock had had his skin crawling and even with his decision, he still hadn’t known how he was going to bring himself to touch her intimately. He couldn’t even kiss her on Christmas day when he’d taken her back; all he could think about every time she came near him, was how many other times had she shot someone for her own purposes and whether she’d felt any remorse at all.
Every time he’d admired Sherlock’s looks or caught himself staring longer than he should of, he’d told himself it was because Sherlock was the sort of person that you couldn’t help but look at. He’d convinced himself that his feeling of possessiveness and jealousy with Irene and later with Janine were all about how innocent Sherlock was when it came to the carnal nature of desire. He’d told himself that his protectiveness was because Sherlock didn’t have those types of feelings. That it was like he’d said that first night at Angelo’s, that it wasn’t his area.
Now normally this would not be an issue; he would just borrow one of his colleague’s set of keys. Unfortunately for John, both of the other regular clinic doctors have called in sick and this is in fact the very reason he has agreed to a double shift in the first place.
When John had asked why he was doing this, Mycroft’s expression had been both scathing and colder than any he’d ever seen on the other man’s face and John had actively flinched at the others explanation.
“I suppose I must admit that... well... I have wanted this for what seems like forever John, but I had no hope that you could ever feel the same. And because of that I did my utmost best to hide how I felt” He confessed hesitantly, his expression pained.
It’s been not quite nine months since he made the decision to forgive Mary and take her back; nine long months of raging arguments and tension and the intermittent boredom of his ordinary life.
“Thank you for organizing all of this. I couldn’t have done it without your cooperation and I know I’m the last person you would have wanted to help, so I really do appreciate everything you’ve done for me and Julia.”
“Sherlock? He’s happy isn’t he? I know I’ve no right to ask, but I saw him in the park a couple of weeks ago and he seemed to be happy”.
get a move on and end ur marriage
And above all else, he had to decide what to do next.
Sherlock then informed him that he might as well know, since he was too much of an emotional coward to ever see it himself, that not only had Sherlock jumped off a building to save John’s life, but he had also done everything in his power to give John what he thought he wanted by protecting the woman that had not only shot Sherlock, but had in fact been the actual sniper responsible for Sherlock’s jump in the first place.
He couldn’t be sure that she would head straight for the clinic after her appointment, but he was damn sure that if she did notice the phone’s absence he really didn’t want to be at the flat.
Apparently; Mycroft had been as mistaken in that belief as Sherlock had been in John’s love for him.
He’d read until he got sleepy and hopefully when he went to bed he could actually fall asleep for a couple of hours before Julia woke up to be fed. He had a busy day ahead of him tomorrow and a fair amount of stuff to pack for his move to Harry’s , the last thing he should be doing is torturing himself with what if’s and might have beens.
“Yours is closer.”
He sighed inwardly.
And yes; John has to admit that Sherlock has changed. He seems more thoughtful and quieter than the man who jumped from Bart’s. More prone to stop and think before speaking his mind. Well, at least when it came to the people closest to him.
“Sherlock what happened at Bart’s? What did Moriarty do to make you jump that day? I know you said you did it to protect us and I’m sorry I never asked you for the details, but I’m asking now?”
John licked his lips nervously, and when Sherlocks gaze zeroed in on his mouth, he felt his own face flush as his heart leapt in his chest with a sudden unexpected rush of hopeful understanding.
All in all, he thought he’d done a pretty good job at appearing clueless. And considering that Mary must think that it was his default setting anyway, he thought he might be in the clear.
John’s mind immediately went where he very much didn’t need it going. Just the mental imagery of his wife and Sherlock locked in anything even resembling passion, was enough to make his stomach turn over in disgust.
“Yes please John... Let’s do that.” gasped Sherlock.
“Will do sweetie.” She agreed, blowing him a playful kiss.
He didn’t hold out much hope that Sherlock wouldn’t read him like a bloody newspaper, but he didn’t want to face him without at least some element of calm on his side.
“Oh my God... It’s true... isn’t it”? John gasped.
Well according to her best friend Kerry Matheson all parents were weird like that. It was just part of being an icky adult or so her friend said. And well truthfully, she thought with a very Sherlock type shrug, she was pretty used to having the weirdest ones on the block anyway.
Raised brow aside, Mycroft had never the less been extremely straight forward with his own words.
Sherlock didn’t say a thing as John left the room and John found himself torn between the desire to have Sherlock stay and his fear that if he did stay it could only hurt worse in the long run.
“Right then... you want the truth... the whole sordid nasty story. Okay then”.
“Well, best be off then. I was supposed to meet some of the girls for afternoon tea later, so I expect I’ll be a bit late tonight. You know how we girls do love to gossip.” She offered with a grin.
“Right then... I’m good.” He agreed pulling the taller man closer.
His lips quirked in a derisive but fleeting smile as his eyes rose to meet Johns.
Long minutes seemed to pass before John finally remembered that as wonderful as kissing Sherlock was; it would perhaps be even better if they talked about things before they got too carried away.
He sighed again and settled down to find his place in his book.
Sherlock Holmes was not a sentimental man and even though he had once proclaimed that sex did not alarm him, John had often wondered if Sherlock had ever had an encounter that involved anything more than casual flirting for a case.
“So lunch today?”
John could hear the snarl of frustration in Sherlock’s voice, and he found himself grinning as he pictured the expression he must be directing towards his brother.
Unfortunately it did.
“John I...”
Something in Mary’s eyes flickered at the mention of Sherlock’s name, and just for a split second John found himself hard pressed to keep up his casual cheerfulness in the face of his wife’s perfidy.
John flinched and ran one hand through his hair before sighing heavily.
“So he’s happy then?”
He’d calmly explained to John, that should he continue to pursue any sort of relationship with his brother that Mary Watson would be brought up on charges for the shooting of Sherlock Holmes and John would find himself in the position of single parent quicker than Sherlock could solve a case.
Mycroft had gone on to say that he had never understood what Sherlock saw in such an ordinary little man and he’d long been sure that it could only end badly for his brother, but he’d thought at the very least that John had valued his friendship with Sherlock.
John gaped.
“It really was quite stupid of her to keep the gun she used to shoot Sherlock and a rather lucky happenstance that you knew just where to find it. If I may ask, what made you decide to finally turn the charming Mrs Watson in? Marital bliss not what you thought it would be hmmm?”
According to Sherlock, the best liars often got away with their deceptions because the really good ones stuck to as close to the truth as possible.
His life might be shit, but he was damned if he’d leave Julia to be brought up by a psychopath.
Sherlock blinked, his mouth opening as if he was about to speak before snapping closed.
Sherlock was his friend, and John was going to choose to believe that the man he’d lived with and saved more than once, was not capable of hurting him in that way. And until he heard differently, he was going to keep calm and carry on in true British form.
Well fuck that. No more stupidity or missed chances for John Watson.
“After I left the cafe that day I did quite a lot of thinking. I’d already known as I said that the marriage wasn’t going to work, but after everything you and Mycroft said to me that day I found myself looking at a lot of stuff about my life that I hadn’t wanted to see before. First thing I admitted to was that nothing I had was worth losing your friendship, but also that you were right; I was toxic to you and you would be far better off without me hanging around. Second thing was that I should have never married Mary in the first place. That I’d convinced myself that I was in love with her rather than face the fact that the life I’d had with you was the only thing I’d ever really wanted. I realized that I’d used Mary as a shield against being hurt by you again and I only had myself to blame for the entire damn mess.” He snuck a quick glance at Sherlock’s expression before looking away again.
She’d obviously been in a rush to get to her appointment and somehow managed to miss the fact that her phone had been left behind.
Sherlock sat forward on his chair.
However, even John’s ability for self recrimination and loathing was apparently finite and is (hopefully) now rapidly nearing its end.  If everything goes to plan this might actually be his last week in this wretched marriage.  Still, that doesn’t stop the memories of exactly why he’s in this position from coming. Or the pain that he constantly lives with because of them.
John’s hopes were quickly dashed however, when Sherlock continually encouraged John to forgive Mary, even going so far as to tell John, that once John was back with her he would remember how much he loved her and be able to put everything else behind them.
Tightening his grip on the other man, John deliberately sought out his friends gaze and did what was possibly the bravest thing he’d ever done... he beared his heart.
“He bloody What!”
It was only as he felt Sherlock’s hand at the zip on his trousers that John came back to his senses.
John’s teeth were gritted with anger as he spat his questions at Sherlock and his fists curled so tightly that his nails were cutting into his own palms.
There was a yearning sort of desperation in the way he was breathing into John’s mouth and a hesitance in the way he opened his own mouth against John’s.
He’d tried to be excited about becoming a father; something he’d never given much thought to before his wedding. But the shameful truth was that his daughter hadn’t even been born yet and he was already worried that she was the only thing that was keeping him in his marriage. Along with that came the fear that he would end up like his own father; resenting her because of that very same fact.
John felt his cock twitch at the expression on Sherlock’s face.
“I love you Sherlock Holmes in every way there is, and if that makes me gay then I’m absolutely fine with it. Now I think you should take me to bed and let me show you every single fantasy I’ve ever had about that rather spectacular mouth of yours, yeah?”
Sherlock looked puzzled and a little worried but that light bulb expression that John had half expected to see was not there.
John had known somewhere deep down inside, that what he’d felt for Sherlock Holmes far exceeded the emotions that one felt for a flatmate, or even a best friend. But after Sherlock jumped, John had deliberately shut away all the what if’s and might have beens. His grief over Sherlocks’ loss was already overwhelming. How much worse would it have become, if he’d dragged out all the confused desires and regrets that he’d kept hidden from both himself and Sherlock.
And in his more honest moments he knew he had no one but himself to blame.
When he got up to answer it the last person he’d expected to see on his door step was Mycroft Holmes and for a moment John had actually been speechless with shock.
But the thoughts refused to leave him, as did his doubts.
And of course, by then it was far too late.
I have however decided that I am going to do my best to complete this story and the mystery of Mary's child.
Happy with the new positioning, John let his hands slide from Sherlock’s hair as he gathered the lanky detectives form closer to his own. His hands swept down the long back, tightening, even as he felt Sherlock relax into the kiss.
“Bloody Mycroft and his tedious theories.” He muttered. Sherlock turned back to face John, his mouth turning up in a derisive smirk.
“By the time the baby was born she’d made it clear that if I tried to leave she’d make sure to finish what she started with you and when the baby arrived and I realized she wasn’t even mine... well by then I knew full well just what she was capable of. Julia might not be my child but I couldn’t leave Mary; not with her threats against you and the way she was with Julia.”
“I was so angry with you when you came back that I was very determined I would never be in the position of letting you be the most important thing in my life again. I’d met Mary when I was still grieving and I suppose I rushed the relationship a little because at least when she was around I could forget about your death for a while.”
John shook his head wearily and sank down on the couch with Julia still in his arms.
He sighed and went to lock the door for the night.
“Bloody weird coming from Harry of all people but yeah... I listened and then called your brother and asked him if the threat he’d made was still doable.”
“Yeah suppose I am a bit late. I got nearly the whole way here, and realized I’d forgotten the bloody keys to the drug cabinet. Had to turn around and go home to get them, and then got caught in rush hour of course.” He shook his head and tried to look annoyed rather than panicked.
He’d deliberately ignored all calls to his phone on the way in, worried about what he’d say if it was her on the other end.
Sherlock’s hand stilled on the kettle and John felt his heart lurch in his chest as Sherlock raised his eyes to meet his John’s.
He’d stood up from the table, straightened his coat adjusted his scarf and taken one last hard look at John’s furious face and thanked him.
“Oh dear, he’s been in such a mood lately John, but I suppose It won’t hurt if you pop up for a quick visit. Just mind that I did warn you and come by before you leave, I’ve some lovely scones that are just about done and some of that blackberry jam that you like.” She patted his hand absentmindedly and with a last glance towards the upstairs flat she disappeared into her own.
He’s scoffed at himself when he said the words and there were actual tears in his eyes as he met John’s. But he acknowledged that he had finally realized just how wrong he’d been, when John had very obviously shied away from his attempt to tell John the truth about his feelings on the tarmac. That he’d seen the look of relief in John’s eyes, when Sherlock had changed his mind and turned his final admittance into a joke; rather than admit to the feelings that he now belatedly realized John didn’t want to acknowledge.  That it wasn’t that John didn’t realize that the tension between them had always been due to their deeper feelings, it was that John didn’t want them to exist at all.
It was only after seeing Sherlock in the park with the man that he undoubtedly loved that John finally admitted that he’d had enough. He’d lost Sherlock for good and no amount of self imposed penance in the form of his wife, could make up for the monumental cock up he’d made.
Even back then when he’d first returned he’d thought it was all a load of complete bullshit, no matter what Sherlock may have said in her defense.
John ran his hands over his face and tried to get his thoughts in order. He wasn’t sure if he should tell Sherlock what had been said that day... at least not the part about Sherlock having been in love with John. He’d already hurt the younger man more than enough and though his feelings had been implied in his speech to John, he rather thought Sherlock would be horrified to know that his brother had so effectively outed him.
So he’d only felt intense relief going to meet Sherlock that day. Relief to finally find out what was going on and even more to get away from the oppressive atmosphere of his and Mary’s flat. He’d also been looking forward to spending time with his best friend, who he’d been rather worried about ever since the whole Magnussen ordeal.
After deciding that and tucking his own phone away, he wrenched the back off Mary’s and removed the sim card just to be safe.
“I hope for your sake Doctor Watson that you never realize just what you’ve lost. My brother may be many things, but I do know him well enough to say this much.  Being loved by Sherlock was a gift and a privilege, one that you threw away because you were too unintelligent to know better. In this life we seldom find someone who has the capacity to love the way Sherlock does and I truly pity that you will never know what that might have been like. Enjoy your life John Watson... I pray it will be worth what you have lost this day.”
“I deluded myself for quite a long time with that excuse, but the incident at Bart’s and the confrontation with Moriarty changed all that.”
Cheers David
What the actual fuck?
So John decided in that instant to finally do what his sister had suggested all those weeks ago.
“Wait... Ah... Oh God.” He gasped “Sherlock stop.”
“As far as he lets on he seems to be content, but Sherlock is hardly likely to fill me in on every aspect of his life. He is working and not using and that is sufficient as far as I’m concerned. Now I really must go... farewell Doctor Watson, I’ll let myself out”.
“If it makes you feel better, I was thinking of you the whole time John Watson.” he blushed as he met John’s annoyed gaze.
Looking back as he sat on the bus, he remembered how grateful he’d felt for her undemanding company; how lovely it had been to be with someone who didn’t pry or ask questions about the famous detective.
“Well actually first I left the park and got shit faced for three days and then Harry came and found me. After that I sobered up and you know the rest”. He finished reaching for the bottle.
He’d understood on some level; that from the moment he stood up from the chair in Lannister Gardens that the rage he felt, far outweighed the upset and betrayal that he should have been feeling. It just hadn’t occurred to him to ask himself why at the time.
But when it really came down to it the thing that John really couldn’t deal with; was the absolute cloying sense of sadness and disappointment that he experienced every time he thought of how easy it had been for Sherlock to just walk away from their life.
The Sherlock of old had delighted in ruining John’s relationships. Demanding and petulant at the best of times, Sherlock had hated it when John was not available to him at the drop of a text; having a girlfriend (as far as Sherlock was concerned) was just another distraction from the all important Work.
Sherlock Holmes loved John Watson and that when it came down to it; it was quite possibly the best piece of news he’d ever received.
He’d obviously missed something pretty damn important by being such a coward. Because it was now obvious that Sherlocks’ feelings were far more involved that he could have guessed.
“No I do not want bloody tea”.
(See the end of the chapter for
He then allowed that John would probably have once done the same for him, but that was back when Sherlock had been the only thing that had kept him interested in living. He added; that he should have seen that John no longer needed Sherlock as an emotional crutch when he’d chosen to return to his lying assassin of a wife.
“She was a bloody awful mother Sherlock. She never even held her right from the start and barely paid her any attention unless she was crying so much that it annoyed her. Don’t get me wrong, she would feed her and change her if she had to, but she really had no mothering instinct at all. She even admitted to me that the pregnancy was an accident and she’d only kept the kid because she thought it would keep me tied to her. I don’t know how many blokes she slept with before we got married, but she was pretty annoyed when she realized that Julia’s colouring was a dead giveaway that she couldn’t possibly be mine. Didn’t even need a DNA test, she admitted it straight up, but she said that she’d thought at the time that it was probably David’s, her ex from the wedding, so she’d thought she could pass her off as mine.”
Sherlocks mouth tightened.
“I’ll just be it did.” John growled frowning at the taller man.
And it also didn’t hurt, that her irreverent and often slightly off sense of humour had kept John amused in a way he hadn’t felt since giggling at crime scenes with Sherlock.
He folded his arms and gave the other man his best I am a soldier and a doctor with infinite patience stare, and waited for Sherlock to answer.
“John what the hell is going on? Frankly you look bloody terrible; you’ve lost at least three stone since I last saw you and the child you are holding is quite obviously not related to you. So perhaps you could do me the honour of explaining what you’ve been doing these last nine months that has got you looking so haggard?”
All these months later, John still remembered how those words had cut. Something in the region of his chest had actually clenched as Mycroft left the cafe and it still ached all these months later.
Sherlocks eyes lowered and his voice hitched slightly as he continued.
On the one hand; he hated Sherlock for letting him grieve and lying to him for all the time he’d been absent. But on the other he was fiercely joyful that his friend had returned. Then there was the agonizing knowledge, that Sherlock hadn’t cared enough for him to realize what his death might do to the only friend he had. And then there was his rage at the blithe and thoughtless way he’d reappeared; just when John had finally got his life to a point where moving on didn’t feel like a betrayal.
Instead; he’d pushed Sherlock away and married a woman that he’d thought was safe. Denied feeling anything for Sherlock; diving head first into a marriage that he knew in his heart wasn’t what he’d wanted; not since the night of Sherlock’s return.
A horrible thought popped into his head.
And now he’d circled back around to the beginning.
“Oh you know... that day in the cafe when he told me to stay away or he’d have her jailed for shooting you.”
He reached for Sherlock’s arm, but before he had a chance to make contact Sherlock slid away and backed up against the kitchen cupboards.
He’d managed to live with Sherlock for eighteen months; successfully lying to himself and everyone in his life about his feelings. Now with one look, that was most likely deeply buried wishful thinking on John’s part, he couldn’t hold back everything he’d managed to suppress for well over four years.
boss might let you live
Okay they were obviously not talking about Sherlock sleeping with John’s wife... so what the hell had Sherlock so upset?
“Right I can do this” he muttered.
Sherlock had looked at John in a way he’d never looked at him before and John had been shocked to recognize it as disgust.
“Don’t”.  Sherlock ordered.
Sherlock grinned and practically dragged John through his bedroom doorway.
“I have seldom been a frightened as I was that day watching you from that rooftop... and that is when I fully realized just how important you had become to me” he admitted; expression pained as his hand moved to cover the one still cupping his face.
Sherlock’s expression was wondering and slightly bewildered as he continued to meet John’s gaze. It was as if he was expecting John to be taken from him and couldn’t understand how he was still holding him.
John sat on the couch and watched him warily. Not understanding why the other man seemed so angry at John’s explanation.
“There there my little love. Hush now dinners on the way.”
Sherlock had been absent from John’s life for a very long time, and since coming back some of his actions at times were those of someone John nearly didn’t recognize. Case in point; he’d shot Magnusson. The Sherlock he’d known before his fall from Barts would have never taken a life; not for something that wasn’t a matter of life or death at the very least.
“Fuck! You and Mary must have been laughing behind my back this whole time. Poor clueless John and his tiny brain will never work it out, yeah. Well fuck you both Sherlock Holmes... I know now, so you better explain to me how the hell it happened before I knock your teeth down your throat.” He barked out.
In truth; John was actually a lot calmer than he’d been earlier after reading the text on his wife’s phone.
Julia is six months old and John can’t honestly remember the last time he got a full night’s sleep.
He smiled and tried to seem happy to see her, while at the same time attempting to gauge if she had any idea that he knew the truth about their marriage, and the baby she was carrying.
Sherlock Holmes was pounding on his door at one twenty three am and he looked absolutely furious.
Sherlock cut him off with the brush of his thumb across John’s mouth.
He parted his own lips and gently sucked at Sherlock’s lower one until the man in his arms got the message and opened his mouth again, tentatively meeting Johns questing tongue with his own.
Yeah... Okay.
Even worse than that he didn’t think he could live with the scorn he might see in the other’s eyes, now that John had finally realized his true feelings for the detective.
“God Sherlock...I”
Picking up her phone he couldn’t help glancing at the text alert icon.
“Seems about right to me... don’t you agree?” Sherlock offered, his mouth moving to John’s throat.
John shrugged.
John had gotten what he wanted when he married Mary and as far as Mycroft Holmes was concerned, it was exactly what he deserved.
He wondered what Sherlock was doing right now. Was he curled up on the couch at Baker Street or submerged in some fantastical case that Lestrade had given him, or maybe playing his violin as he gazed out the window of the flat.
Trying not to grind his teeth in resentment, John did his best not to think about how angry she would have been if it was him that had forgotten his phone.
Unfortunately the best is utter shite and has been since Sherlock got off the plane from his aborted trip to Serbia.
The nagging pain in John’s chest that he’d lived with all these months ceased as he immediately when numb with shock. Seconds later it returned with a vengeance, when the man holding Sherlocks hand pulled him into his arms and kissed him.
“I didn’t think even you would be that much of a prick. But it doesn’t really matter whether you intended it, does it? It still bloody happened.”
There would be no more chases through the London streets and no more laughter over Chinese. He’d never get to giggle with his best friend at a crime scene while making fun of Anderson’s new haircut, or the current state of Sally Donovan’s knees. He’d never again fight Sherlock for the last of Mrs Hudson’s biscuits, or patch Sherlock up because he hadn’t seen the barbed wire until it was too late.
The John Watson that had married Mary Morstan would never have dreamed of violating his wife’s privacy.
Sherlock immediately stiffened in his arms and moved as if to pull away, but John was having none of that. There had been far too many stupid misunderstandings for one day; there was no way he was going to let Sherlock think that what they had just done was anything but right.
He’s on his way to the clinic where he works, when he realizes that he’s forgotten the keys to the drug cabinet.
Sherlocks pupils were huge with arousal and they seemed to devour John as if he might disappear at any moment. But it was the emotion that blazed from them that had John’s throat tightening with the threat of tears.
“Sherlock... What did you mean when you said that I might find your feelings abhorrent? What feelings are we talking about?”
Of course, that would last as long as it took for her to get a new phone, and for David to send another text. After that, all bets were off.
John paused; deciding that a bit of eavesdropping might just be in order.  After all, anything that had Mycroft Holmes angry enough to drop his ice man facade was bound to be of interest.
John swallowed hard before putting his gun in the hall stand and carefully unlatching the door.
He took another gulp of his drink and drained the glass.
Sherlock seem to take his silence as some sort of confirmation of whatever else he’d been thinking, because the next thing John knew he was seeing a side of Sherlock Holmes that he’d only ever seen directed at others.
“And whose child is that? I was told that you and Mary had a daughter. This child cannot possibly be her?”
Now as his eyes met hers, he had to forcibly remind himself not to check on the location of her phone in the pocket of his coat.
The baby never seems to stop crying when he’s home and Mary seems to blame him for that as well.
As Mycroft’s eyes ran over him he couldn’t help cringing at the expression on the others face.
Had Mary and Sherlock really had some tawdry affair, and inadvertently conceived a child?
“Can’t you just leave it alone please? I knew Mary had kept the gun so I brought a duplicate and then I swapped it out and gave the gun to Mycroft. I just wanted to get both Julia and I out of it. I hated that bloody bitch so much that if Harry hadn’t picked up on the threat Mycroft made when I spilled my guts to her, I probably would have ended up snapping and shooting her myself one of these days. I wish I’d never met her... never mind marrying her... she’s cost me fucking everything.”
Like I said, I'm not used to writing in the Sherlock fandom so please understand that since I have other stories in other fandoms that I've been invested with, this may go slower than I would like. I will admit that I have several more chapters written but as I have no beta they won't get posted until I've proofread them and edited until I'm satisfied that they are the best I can get them without a beta's help.
John barely had a chance to absorb that distressing piece of information before   he’d then gone on to ask if John really was that stupid.  If it had even occurred to John that killing someone in plain view of half a dozen witnesses might incur more than a slap on the wrist; a slap in the form of a mission that any of the more qualified MI5 agents could have taken.  Of course he hadn’t been coming back; that was the whole point. He’d spat derisively.
What a lying cheating cow he’d married. And a far better actress than he’d given her credit for.
Her comments at the time had sent a fission of something very like dread up his spine, but she’d quickly laughed it off when John asked her what she meant. Then she’d changed the subject and John had been left with the feeling that somehow he’d missed something important, but he couldn’t for the life of him work out what.
He’d been honest with Mary when He’d thrown the usb into the fire that day at Sherlock’s parents, but that was before Sherlock had shot Magnusson to protect Mary. Before he’d realized that the woman he’d married, didn’t have one ounce of gratitude in her for all the things Sherlock had done to preserve her marriage and quite possibly her freedom.
He stared down at the text on the small screen and tried very hard not to throw it at the nearest wall.
“I thought you knew... he came in not long after you left.”
He’d never guessed that Sherlock was in love with him; no matter what anyone thought.
In the month that led up to his proposal to Mary, John found himself feeling lighter than he had in years.
He nodded.
He’d only just settled in his chair with his book when the front door bell rang.
Rewinding Sherlock’s part of the conversation in his head, John zeroed in on the other mans statement about John’s reactions to his feelings and he frowned with concerned realization.
Sherlock frowned at his words but he nodded his acquiescence.
Still, he’d made vows and there was the baby to think of, so John had done what he’d resolved to do and made the best of it.
“Yeah, well you made it pretty clear what you thought of me the last time we spoke, so I think I’ll survive.” He replied in his mildest tone.
Now he just had to get through the rest of his day and work out what he was going to say to Sherlock.
Sherlock frowned at his words before speaking.
No. He refused to believe it. Sherlock was his friend, he wouldn’t, he couldn’t do something as cold as what John was thinking.
Sherlock shot to hit feet and started to pace.
He paused, seemingly lost in his memory of those times; the timbre of his voice deepening with his next words.
There was a huff and an exaggerated sigh.
Two and a half weeks ago he’d put Harrys’ plan in motion and now he just had to sit back and wait for it to all fall in to place.
The end.
“You were always so quick to counter any misunderstanding about the nature of our relationship and quite openly stated you were not gay, so of course, I chose to hide my true feelings rather than lose your friendship.”
For long moments Sherlock didn’t speak. His gaze sweeping over John as he did what Sherlock did best.
Because even though Sherlock undoubtedly loved John Watson, John knew that the love he felt for Sherlock Holmes was decidedly not the platonic love that Sherlock felt for him.
Jesus! He must have been blind to have missed this. Maybe he really was as dim as Sherlock sometimes accused him of being.
John didn’t know what to say; he was still stuck on the fact that if it wasn’t for Mycroft, Sherlock would have flown off and John would have never seen him again.
Pulling the kettle off the hob John reached for the scotch in the top cupboard and poured himself a hefty shot.
“I don’t suppose you saw my phone when you popped home, I can’t think how I managed to forget it, really.”
“What the hell do you think you are playing at John?” demanded Sherlock his expression angrier than John could ever recall.
Sherlock’s defence of her and hurt by his accusation that John had seen something in her that called to his need for danger.
Cursing under his breath he pushed his worry aside and deliberately ignored the call.
John ran a hand over his face and shook his head again.
My God... It wasn’t possible... was it?
“Indeed you are John... indeed you are.”
If it wasn’t for Julia’s existence and Mary’s continuing threats he’d be long gone; marriage vows or not. Threats aside; Mary had also made it more than clear that if he left, it would be the last time he ever saw Julia and no matter how much he might have hated his wife, he couldn’t do that to her.
Mycroft had ripped the veils away from his eyes and suddenly John had seen every one of Sherlock’s actions in a whole new light.
“But John... She’s not even yours and you still stayed?” said Sherlock his tone bewildered.
Jolted from his thoughts by the sound of Julia’s crying John entered the flat and prepared to face his wife for what would hopefully be one of the last few times.
Though it was par for the course that with his total lack of hindsight, that he wasn’t to learn exactly why that was until he’d taken a walk through Regents Park three weeks ago.
“Right here goes...” he swallowed a gulp of his drink.
Sherlock glared at him and just as he was sure the taller man was about to let rip yet again, he was upstaged by Julia and her sudden demand to be fed.
complete and utter git.  He really did hope his friend was happy, but he supposed he’d lost even the right to worry.
“Really John, I expected better of you than to be caught snooping by Mycroft of all people.”
“Um... well first up hello to you too.  Secondly, if you mean the little domestic dispute that involved my wife being jailed earlier tonight... well I thought that would be quite obvious... and lastly I have no fucking idea why Mycroft told you that. He was barely here ten minutes.”
His, what the fuck are you doing here, had elicited little more than a brow lift and John had found himself doing his very best not to reach across the table and punch the other man.
He scowled
He was scathing and contemptuous as he proceeded to tell John that he felt quite justified in ending their association and their friendship forthwith.
He turned to go and John did the one thing he’d promised himself he wouldn’t do.
“Fine!” Sherlock spat.
John felt a guilty sense of sorrow wash through him.
“Yes well maybe you should have thought about that before you broke his heart” snapped Mycroft.
“But as much as I want you, which by the way is rather a lot, we really do need to talk” he offered apologetically “because I’ve had these feelings for a very long time Sherlock... but up until about two minutes ago I had no idea that you even thought of me in that way?”
“Sorry Love, afraid I can’t today. Part of the reason I went home for the keys actually. Both Patel and Clarke are out sick, so it’s just me on. Raincheck though? Next week? We could try that new place that’s just opened up on the high street; make a real date of it?”  He studied her expression; keeping his own carefully pleasant, he did his best to keep what he felt from surfacing and giving away just how ‘not happy’ he really was.
Feeling like the voyeur he was and filled with the type of pain that he couldn’t begin to process, John caught back a sob and slowly backed away from his hiding spot.
He contented himself with the knowledge that his freedom could happen any day now. All he had to do was be calm and make sure that she didn’t suspect. Fortunately he’d become rather adept at lying to his wife in the last nine months. He’d had to.
He’s seen how vindictive Mary could be now that the mask was off, he couldn’t risk leaving a child to be brought up alone by her; especially not one that she already used as a bargaining chip whenever she wanted John’s cooperation.
“Regardless of what I may have indicated earlier to Mrs Hudson, I must at least thank you for driving Mycroft off, even if it’s only for an hour or two. He’s been absolutely obsessed with the idea that... well you know, you heard him. “
And as John has learned over the last nine months; Mary’s lack of conscience when it comes to Sherlocks shooting, was only the tip of a much darker and larger iceberg.
John was rudely shaken from his thoughts when his own mobile phone started to ring.
He was gonna man up and come clean.
Mycroft’s eyes flitted the length of John’s body, and a brief frown crossed his face. And though whatever he deduced from his inspection wasn’t readily apparent; at least not to John, he did rise from his perch on John’s chair to give a brief nod, before turning to face his brother.
John leaned closer to the door; straining to hear more as Mycroft’s tone dropped back to normal levels, becoming more like the reasonable man that he worked so hard to project to the world.
In the end he had quietly slipped away and then knowing he couldn’t possibly go back his and Mary’s flat, he had booked himself into the nearest hotel and gone on a bender that lasted three days.
Sighing heavily, John picked up his book and attempted to distract himself from his circular thoughts.
Less than a minute later John had her clean and dry in a new nappy and was headed back to the kitchen with a considerably quieter baby.
God! He really really wanted to take Sherlock to bed.
When he did finally start to speak it was with a question rather than the explanation that John wanted.
He gently pulled the younger man’s head down until their eyes were level.
“Would you like tea or coffee Mycroft?” he enquired politely.
His arms tightened around John.
It was John’s turn to frown.
He stood up from the couch. Suddenly deciding that he couldn’t deal with the agony of being close to Sherlock when he knew that Sherlock no longer cared in that way, he moved towards the kitchen.
Shit.
John just hoped that he knew how lucky he was. Unlike the ungrateful bastard that John had been. Sherlock deserved to have someone that would treat him like the amazing man that he was; someone that would be there for him even when he was being a
When Sherlock whirled to face him John was alarmed to see the look of confused pain on the others face.
Rather than reassure John, Sherlock’s state only alarmed him further.
“Moriarty was a master at what he did, and we cannot simply rule out the possibility that he too faked his demise. You, who had the bare minimum of resources and very little time to plan, managed to do it; and to continue the farce for a considerable amount of time thereafter. Why is it so hard to conceive that a man with Moriarty’s skills and backing could do the same?”
He understood the words he’d just read; it was the context that his brain seemed to be having the problem with.
Nearly nine months later John still couldn’t believe he’d been so fucking blind.
“Oh John dear, I’m afraid this isn’t a good time.” She cut in apologetically.  “Mycroft is here and they seem frightfully busy. I was told to inform you that he’s not taking visitors at the moment, no exceptions.”
“That would be lovely John, assuming our daughter doesn’t decide to make an early entrance. The doc did say everything looks fine, but he seemed to think she might turn up any day now.”
Wrenching his mouth away from Sherlock’s took every bit of the last of his willpower and the plaintive noise of disagreement that Sherlock made didn’t help his resolve to talk.
“How could you do this to me Sherlock? I thought we were friends. Why would you keep something like this from me? Were you afraid to tell me or did you just get off on the thought of fooling me yet again?”
She’d told him it was time to man the fuck up and do something for Julia that didn’t involve him staying with, quote: That fucking bitch that ruins everything she touches.
Mycroft made it very clear that that would not be allowed to happen.
His hands; that up till now had been hanging uselessly by his side, slid up and into Sherlock’s glossy hair; John carefully but firmly manoeuvring the much taller man, until his mouth was better aligned with his own.
John tilted his head into the kiss and considered.
“That day on the roof I had planned for every eventuality, except the one thing I could not anticipate. Moriarty killing himself ensured that there was no other way to be positive that the sniper trained on you could be neutralized. Even knowing that Mycroft had pinpointed the snipers, I still couldn’t risk tripping Moriarty’s kill switch.”
For eight months he’d convinced himself that he had no right to want anything more; that he’d made his bed and the only thing he could do was to lie in it.
“Look... I hurt you and I didn’t mean to, but there was no way you would have believed anything I said back then and by the time I’d thought it all through I realized that you and Mycroft were right about one thing... I didn’t deserve to have your love... let alone you friendship.” He looked back up into Sherlock’s startled features.
He laughed again.
It wasn’t until he’d said he was glad that it hadn’t been Moriarty after all, that he’d finally realized that there was something amiss with Sherlock; that he’d somehow overlooked something important somewhere along the line.
When he fails to get through to her he scowls at his phone and grits his teeth.
John gasped and quickly turned from his former friend.
“Sherlock wait”
Six o’clock that evening saw John Watson alighting from a cab at his former address; Two twenty one b Baker Street. Pausing outside the door to the flat, John took a deep breath and tried to calm his nerves.
Seconds later John found himself sitting dazedly on the edge of his bed with no memory of walking from bath to bedroom.
Shrugging off his useless pondering, John moved to the bedroom and retrieved the forgotten keys.
John stood shell-shocked as the taller man started to pace. His obvious agitation clear in every movement and expression.
“God Sherlock! What the fuck does it matter. You told me yourself that you didn’t want me around. I believe the word you used was toxic. I just thought it was better to leave it. I’d obviously done enough damage with my friendship. And you should know me well enough to know that Mycroft Holmes doesn’t scare me.” He huffed looking away from the other man.
John felt his stomach churn, as he remembered the way Mary had seemed so accepting of Sherlock when they first met, and yet when she and John had come back from their honeymoon, she’d suddenly turned mocking and more than a bit contemptuous, practically overnight.
They were married in name only these days and that was more than fine with him.
John’s eyes dropped and he looked away. He rubbed the back of his neck and cleared his throat.
The last was the part was the thing that troubled him the most, if he was being honest. After all, it wasn’t the child’s fault; she had no say in her conception and the fact that her parents’ marriage was less than ideal, was in no way her responsibility.
His last look at John had been one of true pity, his final words chilling.
Sherlock cleared his throat before answering; the obvious expression of nerves on his usually calm features going a long way to reassure John about his own worries.
Firstly, the fact that his wife had been the one to shoot Sherlock had made him more coldly furious than he’d ever been. And it was also the final nail in the coffin of his denial. That had been a real eye opener.
Well what had he expected really? Mycroft wasn’t likely to piss on him if he was on fire. The only reason he’d even helped with the whole Mary thing was because of her having shot Sherlock.
By the time the baby was born he’d known his marriage to Mary was more than just a mistake, it was a trap and one he couldn’t see a way out of.
“Of course I’d known since the pool incident that you were important to me,” He swallowed nervously.  “But I managed to convince myself that it was your worth to me as part of the work that made me fear your loss.”
He also realized that if he told Sherlock the truth, then at least Sherlock would know that John had actually loved him and had really just been as thick as Sherlock had always accused him of being.
“Give us a ring or a text when you find your phone. I might pop round to Baker Street after work if you’re going to be late. Bit concerned, Sherlock hasn’t been in touch about the M situation.” He offered with a deliberately concerned frown.
He looked back up and met Mycroft’s intense gaze.
So John had sat down and taken a good long hard look at himself and asked what had attracted him to Mary Morstan in the first place. Had he subconsciously seen something beyond what was on the surface? Was Sherlock right?
And by the time she was old enough to care....
The wariness in his friends’ expression immediately sets off alarm bells in John’s head, and he had to fight very hard to remain calm as he watched the normally unflappable Sherlock Holmes swallow heavily, before deliberately averting his gaze.
“Look Mycroft, no matter what you or Sherlock thought back then, I really had no idea that he had those sort of feelings for me... and if it makes you feel any better, I didn’t even realize I felt the same way until very recently. He might have been right about a lot of things he said to me that day, but that was the one thing he did get wrong. I loved Sherlock then and I love him now and I’ll have to live with it for the rest of my life... but I guarantee I honestly never knew he felt that way about me. And now I’ll never know if it might have changed anything if I had.” He sighed again.
before the time is right
He really wasn’t sure he could give a believable performance of the loving husband, not when his blood was still boiling over the text on her phone.
Three long hours later John finally got his drink and a chance to sit down.
Apparently that didn’t change the fact that seeing Sherlock in a stranger’s arms felt like someone was tearing his heart from his chest.
“Well...I don’t recall seeing it in the bedroom, but I was in a bit of a hurry.” He offered.  “Don’t worry love; I’m sure it will turn up. You probably had one of those moments that I’m not allowed to mention... seems to be the day for being a bit absentminded.” He grinned, hoping his comment would annoy her just enough to derail any suspicion.
Seconds later a second text came in.
What on earth could Sherlock be hiding that would cause such a reaction?
John shook his head.
“I’ve spent the last eight months cursing myself for being such an emotional fool that day in the cafe. I let sentiment rule my better sense and my brothers’ words colour my decisions. But by the time I had cooled down and come to my senses I realized that I had most likely burnt my bridges, so to speak.  When you failed to contact me I was of course devastated, but after my behaviour I felt it was only just. I attacked your integrity and your friendship for me and I embarrassed both of us with my unwanted feelings... or so I believed at the time. I resolved to finally let you have peace in your life so I stayed away.”
Sherlock looked furious and John was taken aback by it.
Five seconds after that John Watson got the shock of his life when Sherlock Holmes stepped forward and kissed him like he’d never been kissed in before his life.
Watson outlived usefulness
Moving as stealthily as he’d ever moved out on manoeuvres in his long gone army days, John moved to the edge of the clearing and carefully peered through the foliage that concealed him.
He might have lost his chance to be truly happy, but punishing himself and Julia by proxy wasn’t going to change anything.  It was time to except his mistakes and to move on.
If he’d just been a better friend and less of a coward, both he and Sherlock would not be in the situation they were now in. If he’d put his hurt and pride aside sooner and actually talked to Sherlock about his actions on the roof of Bart’s, there would have been no marriage and no Mary to shoot Sherlock.
“But you... well you looked well into it. I well... I thought you didn’t do that sort of stuff... not your area and all that?”
John trudged up the stairs to his flat; his body weary from another seemingly endless day at the surgery and yet another week of sleepless nights.
Right then... he had to get out of here before Mary noticed that her phone was missing.
Then there was the whole pregnancy brain thing that he was not allowed to bring up; under pain of sleeping on the couch. She’d really gone off the one time he’d mentioned it just after they’d confirmed the pregnancy and he’d been wary ever since. Though these days, sleeping on the couch seemed a lot more attractive than it should have been.
The jolt of shocked joy when he’d recognized the voice as Sherlock’s had him stopping in his tracks and the ache of longing he felt staggered him enough that his first impulse was to rush towards the man that he’d missed so much.
“Be just like a Watson to be early to the party yeah. Both Harry and I came early, according to mum. Bloody embarrassing for mum the way she told it. Harry decided to make her appearance in the middle of Bainbridges on a Saturday arvo. Caused quite a fuss.”
He paused before answering, as he would have if he really was trying to remember whether he’d seen her phone when he’d gone back to the flat.
He had to laugh. Just this morning, he’d been torn with guilt because he couldn’t stop thinking about his feelings for Sherlock.  And now it seemed that guilt was the last thing he should be feeling, for either of them.
Deliberately avoiding the other man’s intent gaze, John removed the nearly empty bottle from Julia’s slack mouth and placed it on the floor beside the couch. Levering her up onto his shoulder he rose from the couch. Still carefully avoiding Sherlock’s eye he patted Julia’s back gently to wind her and then turned to the bedroom to put her down.
“Get out of my way John, I’m leaving.”
When he’d asked Sherlock what was wrong, he’d gotten his third shock of the day, though it wasn’t to be his last.
Julia was crying like her heart was breaking and John very briefly felt a moment of guilt over the fact that thanks to him she was now essentially motherless.
Gesturing for the other man to enter John moved to the kitchen and waited patiently to hear why Mycroft had come. Though he had a pretty good idea he knew what his visit was all about.
When he re-entered the room barely two minutes later Sherlock was still seated in John’s chair, though he seemed even more on edge than he had been before John had left to put Julia to bed.
He’d traded the life he truly loved, for a life of duty and boredom; the friendship of the best man he knew, for the love of a woman that didn’t exist.
Unfortunately Sherlock hadn’t just left it at that. Oh no.
Sherlock sighed.
“No you are bloody not... you are going to explain to me why after nine months you have barged into my flat at arse o’clock in the morning only to yell at me and then punch me in the face.”
He’d said that he understood that at the moment Sherlock was hurt and reeling from his recent realization that John was not the person he’d thought him to be, but he knew his brother well enough to know that he could well relent at a later stage and allow John back into his life.
“Dunno really.... I’d just reached a really low point in my life and I went on this really bad bender” he offered evasively.  “Then Harry tracked me down and sobered me up and told me I had to get out. She’s the one who told me I should just go ahead and have Mary arrested; That I wasn’t helping Julia or myself staying in such an emotionally abusive relationship.” He snorted.
He hadn’t questioned why Sherlock had asked to meet him in a cafe rather than at Baker Street. Hadn’t even wondered why Sherlock looked so grim when he’d sat down at the table across from his friend. So it had come as a rather large shock when Sherlock had informed him that Moriarty’s return was all a ruse to get Sherlock out of the Serbian mission and that Mycroft had set it all up.
“Sorry...Bleeding cheek, sending you down, the lazy cock. And Mycroft can go sod himself, if you’ll pardon the language. It’s not like I don’t know what they are up to, the pair of nobs.” He smiled his own apology.
She huffed out a laugh and gave him a fond smile.
“Sherlock you are not listening to me. The broadcast may not prove that Moriarty survived, but it does suggest there is a deeper level of play involved than we first suspected. Your mission to Serbia was not common knowledge, and I think that even you would admit that the timing of it was highly suspect.”
Johns’ vision blurred and a lump formed in his throat at Sherlock’s words.
Ultimately what started out as gratitude had slowly blossomed into a warm and comfortable love. And John found himself thinking less about the grief of Sherlocks loss and more about the good times that he had spent with the other man.
“How dare you involve Mycroft and Lestrade in your little domestic dispute? And why on earth does my brother think we need to talk?”
“Hello Mrs Hudson, is his nibs in? I was...”
Well he was sure he’d find out, one way or the other.
Sherlock’s eyes widened and much to John’s complete consternation he was then treated to seeing Sherlock pale before blushing a shade of red that John hadn’t known he was capable of.
boss will make ur skin=shoes
He moved towards Sherlock hesitantly. Part of him wanted to tell the other man that he’d changed his mind; that they could talk later, that he’d love a cuppa and maybe some Thai from around the corner. The other part was a hard pulsing knot of emotion that just wanted to have it out and done with.
“Three weeks ago I was in Regents Park and I saw you...well I saw you kissing some bloke and I fucking near died. It took seeing you in some other tossers arms for me to actually finally get it... but boy did I get it. I’m in love with you Sherlock and it’s only fair that you know that you were perfectly right with what you said that day.  Well except for the part about me rejecting you because I knew how you felt” he added “that part was a load of old bollocks. I had no bloody idea about myself let alone you. I know that I fucked everything up and I can’t change what happened, but I just wanted you to know how I feel. I only stayed with Mary because I didn’t know what else to do... not with all her threats, but after seeing you that day I finally decided I’d had enough of punishing myself. I guess I figured having lost you completely was the final straw.” His mouth twisted derisively.
When he looked through the peep hole he couldn’t believe his eyes.
“Course, I was much less trouble... it was the pub for me and fortunately, unlike Harry, I actually waited to arrive until she got to the hospital.”
He had barely spoken to Sherlock at the airport before Mycroft had swooped in and whisked the younger man away and it had been half a dozen extremely tense days before he’d gotten a reply to his numerous texts asking Sherlock what the hell was going on.
“Okay, no use pretending I didn’t hear some of that, so what the bloody hell is going on? Is Moriarty dead or not?”
“So anyway... we got married because that’s what you do when you buy someone a ring and you’re doing your best to ignore the fact that you’d rather be with your best friend who faked his death for two years. Of course the whole thing went to hell the night she shot you. After that I could barely even stomach the thought of being in the same room as her let alone anything else.”
According to Mycroft the man who had once described himself as a high functioning sociopath, had been tortured and beaten to within an inch of his life to protect the people he cared about and the one he cared the most for had, on his triumphant return home, attacked and punched him, even as he was still healing from that same ordeal.
“He claims I am the dramatic one in the family, but his obsession with this most recent business, rather effectively decries that particular claim. He’s done nothing but witter on about Moriarty ever since we left the tarmac.” He offered disgustedly.
Encouraged by the somewhat confused look on the detective’s face John took a deep breath and continued.
Sherlock yelling at his brother was not entirely without precedence, however Mycroft’s raised voice was not something John had ever experienced and with a brother as trying as Sherlock, that was no small feat of control.
It was the same feeling he got after a particularly brilliant case; one that usually ended in a frantic chase, the two of them giggling like mad as they made their way up the seventeen steps to their flat.
John folded his arms and waited.
He was still trying to get his head around it all, when Mycroft Holmes slipped into the seat that his brother had so recently vacated.
And he certainly never would have married Mary if he’d known just what Sherlock felt for him. It might have taken him some time to forgive Sherlock, but he would have got there a bloody lot sooner than he did if he’d known the true reason why Sherlock jumped.
“No thank you Doctor Watson. I am merely here to let you know that as of seven o’clock this evening Mary Watson was taken into custody by detective Lestrade and charged with the attempted murder of my brother. She will undoubtedly be extradited to face charges in the US and several other countries as well, but for the moment we have a very solid case due to the evidence you so kindly collected for us. More than enough to be going on with I should think”.
For several minutes that felt like hours to John he was lost in the sheer delightful feeling of having a very aroused and passionate Sherlock plastered to every inch of his body.
Eventually she’d convinced him that he had to go home and she’d even come up with a plan to help him with the whole Mary situation.
Why it had taken Harry to point out the obvious he still didn’t know; he was just glad she had.
But even knowing all that, John had also been absolutely one hundred percent sure that he was straight and that the love he felt for Sherlock was platonic. Yes he’d loved him, possibly more than anyone else, at that point in his life. But he was not and had never been interested in anything more than their friendship. Because he was (as he’d repeatedly stated) not Gay.
John felt jittery and knew it was his body’s reaction to shock, but he also knew he didn’t have time for any more wallowing. He had to get out of the flat before she got back, and as much as he hated it, he’d have to go to work and act completely normal.
Cursing under his breath, he quickly dials Mary’s phone to ask if she can drop them off on her way to her appointment with her obstetrician.
God. He’d really cocked up his life. And now all he could think about was Mycroft’s expression as he’d asked about Sherlock.
As he waited with baited breath to hear Mycroft’s reply, John could practically hear the eye roll accompanying Sherlock’s words.
What John doesn’t understand, is why Sherlock hasn’t taken everything that has happened and used it to convince John to come back to Baker Street permanently.
“Look Mycroft, if you two can’t even agree on something as simple as the pricks death; then maybe it’s time you were off. I need to speak to Sherlock, and frankly I don’t feel like standing around watching you two stubborn arses argue all night. So how about you go and do your super spy thing, and maybe make absolutely sure that all your ducks are in a row, and then you and Sherlock can continue yelling at each other tomorrow.”
John needed for them to be on the same page; he needed to understand what Sherlock wanted from him, to make him understand that the kiss they were now sharing was everything to John. That if they took this further and Sherlock changed his mind it would be the end for John. He had to know without any doubt where he stood with the man in his arms.
He smirked at John’s deliberately exaggerated eye roll before stepping back to let him pass.
He obviously wanted to kiss John, he just didn’t seem very confident in doing it. So John did the only thing he could, he took control.
His first thought was that Mary had somehow escaped custody and had made her way back to the flat. Even as unlikely as that was John still made sure to grab his gun before moving to answer the door.
“I knew she wanted to get married and I knew that if I didn’t take that step then it was possible she’d find someone else that wanted those things, so I thought why not. It wasn’t like you were around to drag me on wild adventures; all that was over. So I brought a ring and nerved myself up to do it. Of course you came back before I had the chance and as angry as I still was with you, when Mary asked about the ring later I just went along with it.”
Sherlock’s tone and demeanor was not what one would expect to find in a man that had just been confronted with cuckolding one’s best friend.  The language was formal and stilted, but there was a layer of hurt acceptance that was very much out of context for the conversation that they were having.
He was surprised to see that he was only a stop away from the flat that he and Mary shared and at the same time, troubled by the thought that even now he still didn’t think of the flat as home.
He shook his head as though to clear it, then he deliberately took a good hard look at his friend.
Well something was obviously up. It wasn’t like Mrs Hudson to seem so cowed and there had been genuine concern in her eyes, though John wasn’t sure who it was for.
He thinks back to the day; that last day before his life truly went to total shit and like a thousand other times he fails to understand how he could have gotten everything so badly and completely wrong.
She smiled up at him, and John felt a shiver of expectation as he waited for her response.
She hadn’t even thanked him that day at the airfield and had instead seemed rather annoyed when he was recalled barely minutes into his flight. A flight that would have led to what Mycroft termed as a lengthy and difficult mission.
He went on to say that it was now apparent that he had fallen prey to his own bout of sentiment in ever thinking that John had cared even half as much for Sherlock as he had for him. That it was obvious that John’s deeply repressed feelings of inadequacy and his latent bisexuality had been the only reason John had been so eager to follow along in his wake. That his supposed friendship was more about John’s need to feel like he still had some sort of purpose after being invalided home from Afghanistan, rather than any actual respect for Sherlock. And that Sherlock was disgusted with himself that he had been so ready to believe that John actually cared about Sherlock as a person.
He’d spent a very tense two days waiting to see if Mycroft would even agree to enacting Harrys’ plan. It wouldn’t have surprised him one bit if Mycroft had refused. It was after all only what he deserved.
“Yes John I mean it. Why else do you think I rushed over here when I heard about Mary?  Imagine my surprise when I got here and discovered it was you that had had her locked away.”
He’d then gone on to compare John to Sherlocks former drug addiction and had informed John that just like with that addiction, he would not allow his brother to continue along what had obviously become a self destructive path.
John steeled his nerves and turned back to face Sherlock.
It had taken him some heavy soul searching and repeated combing over his memories of his and Mary’s every interaction, but in the end John was relieved to find that for once in his life, it seemed that Sherlock Holmes had got something wrong.
My darling Mary
The only thing he could think about was Sherlock; which was really nothing new, it was just seeing Mycroft had brought it all home to him again.
She smiled at him.
All these thoughts had been whirling in his head as he’d passed through the entrance to the park and he hadn’t been paying much attention to anything other than his own anger as he’d turned on to the path that he’d walked so often when he lived at Baker street.
So yeah, maybe he’d been too quick to dismiss who’d she’d been. Too quick to destroy the only real truth that she had ever offered willingly.
Sherlock moaned, his breath hitching as John deliberately brushed his rapidly hardening erection against the others thigh.
“Because we both know how little you like to hear home truths, don’t we John.”
Mary and he had had one of their usual fights: John didn’t even remember what had started it this time; he just knew that he needed to get out of the flat and as far away from her as possible.
While temporarily back at Baker Street in the months after Sherlock was released from hospital, he’d had time to go over everything that had occurred to him that horrible night; from every possible angle. More than enough time to turn over and examine his thoughts and reactions and to admit (at least to himself) that he really had rather managed to muck up his life.
“I was having a drink myself but I can put the kettle on if you like.”
“Just so Doctor Watson, then I will leave you to try and talk some sense into my brother. He is treating this far too lightly in my opinion. Perhaps you will have better luck in persuading him than I. Good day John, Sherlock.”
He was even more startled when he noted how much time had gone by since first entering the flat.
Eventually opening up and telling Mary about Sherlock, had seemed to be the last missing piece in his long process of grieving. He’d thought that he’d finally reached the stage of acceptance; that his grief, if not completely gone, was at last becoming bearable.
Sherlock was cradling his hand and glaring at John as if he’d deliberately meant to damage Sherlocks hand with his face.
Then again, he’d been rather adamant about not wanting to know the details of Sherlocks’ fake suicide; or the reasons behind it. In truth, he hadn’t wanted to know the reasons that Sherlock had chosen to leave him behind so casually; hadn’t wanted definitive proof that Sherlock hadn’t cared enough to even think about how his actions might affect John.
Carefully testing the bottles temperature on the inside of his wrist, he couldn’t help tensing as he felt Sherlock enter the kitchen behind him.
Sherlocks kid important
It also didn’t help that Sherlocks mystery man was tall and nearly as attractive as Sherlock. He was everything John could never be and quite obviously not ashamed to kiss Sherlock Holmes in a public park.
When would this even have happened? And more to the point; why would a man who had never seemed even remotely interested in any sort of sexual relationship, suddenly decide that sleeping with his best friends fiancé was the thing to do.
What was his life?
No. It was very clear to John that as much as Sherlock valued his friendship and enjoyed his company, he was very not interested in John being more than that.
The simultaneous yes and no that he received was rather comical, but the obvious tension between the two brothers was far from amusing.
When she’d told him about the apparent loss of her phone, he’d been sympathetic with just the right amount of annoyed at the expense that she’d expect. And then suitably apologetic when she in turn reminded him of the two times his phone had been destroyed; both while on cases with Sherlock.
He looked down.
“I suppose it was only a matter of time, but I had hoped that you would leave well enough alone.” The words were a low rasp that John barely caught, but John felt his stomach drop down to his shoes all the same.
“Sherlock! For Christ sake hang on a minute will you.”
Regardless of her once purported love and her supposed willingness to make things work, she never did let go of the fact that John had chosen to stay with Sherlock as long as he did. And no matter how many times they argued back then, she was still unapologetic about shooting his former best friend.
“That day in the cafe you could have knocked me over with a feather. I had no idea you felt that way about me and the thing at the plane that you think you saw... well it was because I was doing my best not to break down in front of your brother and my bloody wife, not for the reason you thought.”
And if his earlier thought’s hadn’t been torment enough, just the fact that it was Sherlock he was more torn up about, rather than his wife and her poisonous actions...well that really said it all, didn’t it.
Picking her up he shushed her gently as he laid her on the change table.
His mouth twisted in a self depreciating smile, as he looked back down to the baby he held in his arms.
Then in one fell swoop, it had all came apart with the return of Sherlock Holmes.
As far as Mycroft Holmes was concerned John had lost any right to ask about Sherlock the day he’d left John sitting in that horrible little cafe.
At least this time he had only himself to blame for his grief and he had the comfort of knowing that Sherlock was alive and out there living his life; rather than dead like he’d believed for those nightmare two years that he’d been gone.
“Now please kindly explain what this is all about.” John ordered.
“I refuse to discuss this with you, now will you kindly get out of my way so I can go. “Sherlock snarled.
He was still frozen, when Sherlock moved forward sans any of his usual customary grace and without hesitation, dipped his head down and took John’s mouth in a somewhat clumsy but passionate kiss.
Instead of being devastated by her betrayal; John found himself aggravated that even with a bullet in him, Sherlock was acting like he and Mary were the best of friends. That everything that had just gone to shit in John’s life was merely an inconvenience. A misunderstanding; easily sorted with a chat and a nice warm cuppa. And it burned him to admit it, but part of that was his jealousy of the way that Sherlock had treated her right from the start.
Giving John a wide berth he strode back to the living room and lowered himself to the armchair that John had so recently vacated.
Still not looking at Sherlock he paused in the doorway.
John is abruptly hit with two very separate and opposing emotions. One is a wave of homesickness that makes the back of his eyes burn with strain, and the other is a renewed rush of anger at the man in front of him.
Were they even having the same conversation?
“Tea?” he inquired, reaching for the kettle.
Now speechless for different reasons altogether, John had been devastated by the sheer vitriol in Sherlocks next words.
Mycroft’s gaze narrowed with John’s words but whatever might have been going on in that convoluted brain of his he chose to keep it too himself.”
He wasn’t sure what the phrase ‘terminate the marriage’ meant, but he sincerely doubted that David was talking about divorce.
“God John. Perish the bloody thought.” She huffed scoldingly. She swatted his hand lightly as she edged forward in her seat in preparation of rising.
He’d been walking towards the bench that overlooked his favourite spot, when he’d heard a very familiar laugh.
But of course, as soon as he finds himself sitting down to gaze out the window on the homeward bound bus, his mind does exactly that.
He scratched the back of his head and did his best to look sheepish.
“That last day in the cafe... well it was an eye opener in more ways than one.” He admitted.
His physical need to hurt Sherlock had shocked even himself and the fact that the urge was still there weeks later had troubled John, more than he cared to admit.
“Doctor Watson, perhaps you would like to join us and give your opinion on the matter. I rather thought lurking was more Sherlock’s raison’de entre, but it appears that as with most things, he has managed to corrupt even you.”
“Fuck!” he rubbed one hand across his face and took another drink.
Fuck it. Just get through the day. You were a soldier and a doctor on the front lines, how hard can it be to get through one day.
If he was to believe Mycroft, Sherlock had been in love with John and everything he’d done since jumping from Bart’s right up to shooting Magnussen, had been because he loved John more that he valued his own life. Even his apparent drug lapse for the case had more to do with his devastation over John’s marriage, than his need to give Magnussen leverage.
Well Fuck.
Mindful of the role that he was playing, he waited for her to answer; doing his best to seem like the contented husband and expectant father.
He was doomed to disappointment, when instead of yet another attempt to reason with Sherlock, Mycroft’s voice was raised for an entirely different reason.
John reached out and grabbed Sherlock’s arm; Sherlock reacted by turning sharply and punching John in the face.
Bitcheesquared
after the kid is born.
Approaching the door of his old flat, John was startled to hear raised voices.
“And you think I’m forgetful you great duffer.  Well I suppose we make quite the pair really, what with me forgetting my phone and you the keys.” She frowned and looked thoughtful.
There was no way he could stand to see Sherlock so happy with his lover when John felt like his heart was breaking and the thought of Sherlock finding him and possibly introducing the other man had John verging on panic.
John quickly lay Julia down on her blanket on the lounge room floor and hurried after his former friend.
“So then you love me and I love you and that’s it... all is forgiven?”
Sherlock was making the most delicious sounds and his body was hard and urgent against John’s equally needy form. But John knew that as much as he wanted to drag Sherlock off to his room and live out all his fantasy’s of what he’d like to do to the younger man, now was not really the time to get distracted. Not with everything he’d learned today.
past time u came in.
Resolve firmly in place, John rang the buzzer and waited.
Sherlock would never be more than the brilliant best friend that John could get his adrenalin rush from; the man that would always have his back even if it meant destroying his life and health to do it, because to admit that Sherlock actually had real emotions would be unthinkable .
Mrs Hudson shot a worried look towards the stairs, but she did step back and allow John entrance.
He has a child coming, he reminds himself. He’s going to be a father and no matter what he feels or who he feels it for, that fact is something he cannot ever forget.
Sherlock was flushed and his body language was defensive. Not the type of defensive that came from guilt, but the type that came from embarrassment and hurt.
When Sherlock opened his mouth as though to speak; John shushed him before he could ask whatever question it was that he could see in Sherlocks eyes. He needed to get this out without interruptions or he was going to bottle out of the whole bloody thing.
Swallowing heavily, John let Sherlock lead him to his bed and when the taller man pulled him down he couldn’t help but shake his head at the wonder of it.
Mycrofts’ eyebrows rose at Johns’ congenial tone, but his expression was closed off as he met Johns’ eyes.
Oh she’d said she’s sorry in the beginning, but it always seemed to come with a disclaimer; as though it was Sherlock’s fault that he got shot, or that it was John’s for choosing not to see who she really was. She had made it more than clear that even though John didn’t want to know about her past; it didn’t change the fact that she had one. Nor did it change the fact that she felt like she had no other option that night.
Ps Dnt think of running.
It would also have the added advantage of releasing some of the guilt he’d felt over hurting his friend if Sherlock was the one that got to tell him that he was sorry but he had moved on.
If u r a good girl
Of course he’d tried to bury said epiphany under his panicked worry for Sherlock’s life. Telling himself later that it was only because he was so afraid he was going to lose him for a second time. He tried to convince himself that the attraction that he’d felt for Sherlock nearly right from the start, had been put aside years ago and that he wasn’t gay anyway; that he loved his wife. He reasoned that he loved Sherlock like nobody else he’d ever known; simply because he was like no one else he had ever known.
John shook his head and blinked.
Cheers
Sherlock directed a smirk at his brother.  It was his... that’s telling you grin, and John couldn’t help the snort of amusement at the air of smugness that was radiating from the detective.
“Hmmm most likely.” Sherlock purred nuzzling John’s ear.
The life changing epiphany had followed shortly thereafter.
Sherlock kissed like a man that very much wanted to kiss someone, but was not really sure how to go about it. It wasn’t bad by any means, but it was hesitant and unpractised and John knew instinctively that the kiss that they were sharing was quite likely the first kiss that Sherlock had ever actively participated in; that wasn’t case related.
