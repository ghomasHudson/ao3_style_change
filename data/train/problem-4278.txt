“I know we still have much to talk about,” Castiel says. “I have a lot of questions, and I’m still upset that you kept this from me.”
He was about to leave to room when he remembered his little treat for him and Cas.
Dean was a little annoyed that Sam hadn’t been this dedicated of a wingman when Dean was in his 20s and had spent every other night at a bar looking to score. Then, Sam had mostly ignored what Dean was doing, occasionally pulling him out of a situation if it turned sour. But he never went out of his way to give Dean more opportunities. Now, he would have to throw a box of condoms at Dean’s head to be any more obvious.
Castiel hugs him to his chest, rubbing his back in familiar, soothing circles and planting soft kisses in his hair. Dean feels the lump in his throat threatening to turn into full-on crying.
Dean throws the blankets off, shivering when the cold air of the bunker rushes to meet him. Castiel is normally a little space heater in bed, but without him, Dean is perpetually cold. He grabs his robe and pulls on some socks before padding across the hall. Quietly, he opens Castiel’s door and steps inside.
It had been a standard salt and burn hunt. The ghost of some old janitor had been scaring kids at a local high school. He hadn't even hurt anyone really, he just hadn't moved on when he died. It was an easy job, his spirit hadn't even put up a fight when they torched his bones.
There’s entirely too much concern in that tone, so Dean tries to play it casual. He turns his head just enough to show he’s paying attention, but not for Castiel to see his face.
The group of guys laughed. Baldy spoke up, only a couple feet away from Dean now.
"Thank you, Dean."
“Just today,” Cas whined. “This morning.”
Matthew continued.
“Hey, what happened to you two?” Sam asked when he saw the blood on Cas' face and Dean's dishevelled look.
“... what?”
Dean shook his head.
“Worse.”
“What do you need from me right now?” Dean asked.
“Maybe. I dunno,” Dean said. “I hope not, but...” He shrugged.
He paid careful attention to Castiel’s reaction as his hands slowly mapped the omega’s back and shoulders. When all he could smell and hear was happy, relax omega, he let his fingertips trail to Cas’s stomach and up his chest, feeling the expanse of hot, smooth skin that he’d been dying to get his hands on.
Cas whined, but relented when Dean promised he would take his turn to be pampered after Cas was through his heat. For now, he allowed Dean to dry him off and fetch him a pair of heat briefs, along with clean sweats and a t-shirt.
"What are you and Sam doing with the map?"
Deciding he wasn't going to get the fight he wanted, he raised the blade above his head, ready to strike.
Dean considered it. Cas initiated about half their make-outs, but maybe he didn’t know how to take it further. This was all very new to him. Maybe this really was all in Dean’s head, and if he’d just tried for more, he would have gotten it.
The playful banter continued for a while longer. Sam finally ended it when he got up to go back to the bar for more beers.
Dean just stood there, mouth opening and closing dumbly.
when Dean regularly made him orgasm so hard his legs felt like water for an hour after. That was
Dean stood awkwardly by the bed, fiddling with his hands when he noticed the smell returning. Castiel’s shower must be wearing off faster than he’d expected. Dean couldn’t imagine feeling painfully horny for a week with no outlet. Even if there wasn’t a willing girl or guy around, at least he had his hand, or-
“Why would you think that?”
Sam spun around at the new voice. Emanuel was standing just inside the door, wide eyed and... He almost looked scared.
“I... yeah, that. Would it help?”
“Whoa, whoa, hold up. That’s what you think this is about? Cas, babe, I love everything about you, including the fact that you’re a guy.”
” in cursive written above it. Cas loved it, and no one else could use it.
After he ate, his stomach seemed unsure of whether or not it was going to reject the food. Dean had booked it to the bathroom on one particularly worrying bout of nausea, but thankfully, it had been a false alarm. He didn't think he could take throwing up one more time today.
Castiel shakes his head.
“No, Dean. Look, I'm your brother, you can talk to me about anything, okay? What is so bad that you can't tell me? Does this have something to do with me? Did I piss you off or something?”
“Yeah, you like that, Cas?”
"Good. I'm glad. Hey, it's quicker if we cut through the park. The Impala is around the block."
“I’ll wash that too, if you want,” Dean said. “I’m sure some clean clothes will help.”
The younger Winchester took off at a sprint towards their car. The Impala was parked a good hundred yards away at least, sitting on the same road the van was barrelling down. Sam's long legs carried him quickly over the dusty, uneven desert ground. As soon as he reached the sleek black car, he jumped in and sped towards the van, the tires slipping momentarily on the loose gravel.
They had only been watching for a few minutes when Cas’s hand inched its way over. Dean watched as Cas tentatively grabbed his wrist and pulled his arm until it settled over his ribs, effectively moving Dean until they were cuddling.
“Cas... come on, you don’t have to do that.” Dean knows he sounds like he’s begging. Maybe he is.
“... I would enjoy some clean sheets,” Cas admitted shyly.
"I don't want to be a vegetable, Dean." Castiel rasped. "When I make that final transition, I want it to be on my own terms."
"Whoa! Whoa! Dude, I don't want any trouble. Please, take whatever you want, don't hurt me."
He came in to see Cas untying the woman in the living room. He had never seen the angel that scared or genuinely afraid for someone else, other than maybe Dean.
Castiel's wounds healed themselves on the ride back. By the time they arrived at the cabin, both the angel and his hunter were passed out, sleeping peacefully against each other. Cas with his head resting on Dean's shoulder, and Dean with his head against the angel's. Sam smiled at the two. He didn't want to ruin the moment, but he needed to get them inside. Briefly, his sibling side kicked in and he thought about taking a picture, but quickly decided against it. He gently woke up his brother and helped him carry Castiel inside and to the couch on the main level. Both the Winchesters were too tired to try getting him up the stairs, and Cas really didn't care either way.
Okay, he can do this. For Cas, he can figure it out. He
Emanuel seemed unfazed by Sam telling him that his brother had been with a guy, though why should he be? Technically, Emanuel/Castiel was the man Dean had loved and been loved by.
“Yes, and not just because of my heat. Dean, I have never had a problem with your hands on me. I just didn’t want to lead you on. Now that I’ve told you I don’t want this to progress to sex, I have no hesitations about you touching me.”
There was a pause and some shuffling on the other end of the line. Sam heard a squeaky door open and slam shut, he guessed Bobby had stepped outside.
Dean still hadn't opened his eyes, but he had at least raised his head enough that it was resting against the pillar behind him. His hand was clenched around the mandible blade in his hand, and he took in great shuddering breaths. Suddenly, as if being startled awake, his eyes flew open.
“You're Emanuel?”
“So, you don't remember anything before Amelia found you?”
“Dean,” Sam said, only just keeping his voice out of an alpha tone.
“Yes, Dean?”
Cas waved off the idea and took a sip of his tea.
That got his attention real fast. He spun on the shifter, facing him now.
Cas didn't.
“I'm gonna go talk to him, see if I can figure something out.”
Dean was getting worse. He usually just stretched out on the couch upstairs, sometimes he asked for another beer, most of the time he just asked to be left alone. He only ate when Bobby practically sat with him and watched to make sure he did.
Castiel looked like he was about to cry, but his smell was pure joy. He surged forward, practically crashing into Dean to kiss him. It was deep and desperate, but there was no heat to it. Only relief and happiness. Cas was smiling so hard he could barely move his lips along with Dean’s, but those kisses were Dean’s favourite.
Dean doesn’t think he could ever get over how Castiel could ask Dean to share his trauma and sound honoured to hear it.
God, he’s really not suited to these kinds of conversations. He nearly had a panic attack the first time he said
“So, what can I get you two?”
He dries his hands on the dishtowel and says, “Yeah, uh, alright.” He lets Cas take his hand and lead him down the hall to their bedroom. The hollow feeling in his gut and the fuzzy feeling in his mind growing with each step.
“I think I could wipe the parking lot with your ass.”
"Something wrong with all them fudge packers!"
Dean was practically transfixed at that point. He barely registered Sam screaming his name as he ran towards him, right now the pit in his stomach had all his focus on the shifter. It had gone to see Cas. More so than that, it had tried to touch Cas. His Castiel. But the angel hadn't called him or Sam to tell them about the shifter's visit...
“Well, you found him.”
Secretly, Dean is relieved. Part of him has been holding its breath, waiting for Cas to leave. Only, he knew that wouldn’t happen. Not because he was filled with confidence in their relationship, but because he knew Castiel was too much like him.
“Yeah, yeah please.”
But there really wasn't anything left to say. Him and Cas had both already said everything that need to be said after Castiel was first injured.
Sam nodded.
Cas nodded. He really wanted to see Dean now so he could help him and try to explain himself, but if Bobby thought it best to leave him alone for the night, then that's what the angel would do. He also knew that it was partially for Bobby's benefit as well. The older hunter was observing him, deciding whether or not to trust him again, and Cas knew it was best to tread carefully for the next few weeks, if Dean even let him stay that long.
“Oh, Dean...”
Sam looks at the burners, then all around the kitchen.
that you and Cas finally got together? I thought we were bros!”
The drive back to the bunker was silent for the most part. Once or twice Sam had tried to say something, but when he'd hinted at what Cas had said, Dean immediately turned up the radio and ignored his brother. He couldn't think about that right now. He couldn't dare to hope that Cas had meant what he said, or that he had even heard him correctly in the state they were both in. Later, with a bottle of whisky, while Cas was resting, he would let his mind wander. But right now, it was still too fresh. Too raw.
“What do you mean?”
"I'm....sorry for....for what I said."
Castiel lets out a jaw-popping yawn and scoots up so he can lean against the headboard.
“I am very sorry that has been your experience in the past. You deserved people who saw who you are and loved you for that, not for who they were pretending you could be. But I am not them. And, if you would let me, I would be honoured to show you how I see you.”
"Yeah, Dean?"
"I visited your motel room this morning. After you left. I was disguised as you. I tried to play boyfriends. I tried to taste the life of a hunter.”
“Balls!” Bobby groaned when Sam didn't answer for the third time. It was never a good sign when a hunter didn't answer their phone, and knowing Sam, it was unlikely he had simply lost it. Bobby wasn't sure what was going on, but whatever it was, it made him nervous. He didn't like being out of the know, and it wasn't like he could leave Dean and go look for Sam himself. Right now, the oldest of the Winchester brothers needed him most.
"Listen, uh... There's something I...that I..."
Most of the sigils were Anasazi symbols, meant to ward against wendigos. Thankfully, despite how far north they were, Dean hadn't heard of any wendigos in Montana for years. That didn't necessarily mean there weren't any though, so he did his best to stay vigilant. Besides, if he focused on paying attention to his surroundings, he could at least lie to himself and say he wasn't thinking about Cas.
“I don’t know what you’re getting at here, Cas.”
Cas had tears in his eyes, and his voice was shaking with emotion. He didn't know what he would do if he lost Dean.
The worst part is, Dean doesn’t know how to convince him. He’s spent months lying. How can he expect Cas to believe he’s telling the truth now? How can Cas ever trust that his touch is wanted and not just tolerated?
“Can we just go to sleep, please? I’m exhausted,” Dean says, even though the anxiety running through his system is definitely going to keep him awake for hours.
“It will go down on its own in a minute with you here.”
Cas nodded, hugging Dean tighter to his frame. Cas was big for an omega, and strong too. Dean appreciated the steady strength he could feel in those arms.
Bobby was pacing the room, trying to calm down. Sam had taken off a while ago, heading to town for a supply run.
“And?” Dean asked, still feeling Castiel’s warm nose against his neck.
**********
Dean rolled his eyes and leaned back against the couch. Sam ignored him and continued.
“Easy, alpha,” Sam said, still backing down the hall until he was at the next bedroom door. “I’m leaving.”
“You and Bobby played Scrabble?”
The last 15 years had given him plenty of new material for his nightmares, and it was rare he went a week without at least one. Dreams of Hell, or of losing Sam or Cas or Bobby, played through his mind easily. After all, they had all come true before. Sometimes dreams of losing himself and becoming a demon again woke him up shaking so hard his teeth chattered, and he struggled to remember what was real.
“Bobby, I'm gonna have to call you back.” Sam said, hanging up the phone without waiting for a reply. He stood frozen in place, uncertain of what to do now.
"Sam-"
. Especially not when it was with Dean, the man he’d been mooning over for longer than he cared to admit. And not when it was so much better than anything he had dared to hope for when he hadn’t really known what sex could be like. So really, he shouldn’t complain, but there was something that was on his mind a lot.
“Nothing. I'm fine Sam.” he said halfheartedly, getting into the car and closing the door quickly, effectively stopping the conversation. Sam huffed.
Dean thought about spending the next couple of days like this. Looking after Cas, holding him, reassuring him, making him feel wanted and cared for. It made warmth bloom in his chest. And then he thought about it ending. Castiel thanking him and then asking Dean to return to his own room. Spending the nights with a hallway between them, going back to just being friends and hunting partners.
Dean feels a lump in his throat, and the backs of his eyes sting with sudden tears. The fear of losing Cas had been building ever since that first kiss. The knowledge of how important this was, and how devastating it would be to lose, weighed heavily on Dean and grew heavier each day. He hated to admit that it had tainted many memories he and Cas shared.
"'I was sleeping with my peepers open'. Dude, you can say whatever you want, but that old lady scared the crap out of you." Sam laughed out.
Dean knew exactly how he liked to be touched. When he wanted it rough, and when he needed it gentle. When he wanted to draw it out, and when he just wanted a quick release. Dean was attentive, focused, and dedicated to bringing Castiel pleasure, doing everything in his power to regularly make him reach heights he’d thought were only attainable with wings. So Castiel really couldn’t call it a
“I know,” Dean said. “I tried to be quick. Sam went to the store to get supplies so I could stay with you.”
this talk, remember? Listen, I’ll explain later. For now, we do really need the other stuff on that list, though.”
Dean seemed flighty and anxious, Sam knew he wasn't going to get answers from his brother anytime soon. He sighed and looked towards the stairs, glad Cas had returned already nearly half an hour ago.
“Are you... you’re in
Dean smiled back.
He now folded that blue sweater neatly and set it on the bed, deciding he would return to thank Emilia for all she had done for him, and to give her the sweater back when he said goodbye. He then grabbed the trench coat and shrugging it on. It felt familiar, and more suiting for his vessel. Castiel wasn't sure what to do next. He wanted to go see Dean, but he knew the hunter needed time to process everything on his own before he could face Cas. Going to see him now might only push him away more, and at the very least it would make this a lot harder for everyone involved. The angel decided now was as good a time as any to go see Emilia as he'd said he would. Before he left, he made Sam swear to pray if Dean came back before Castiel returned. Cas didn't want him thinking he'd left again.
Dean’s mind blanks. He’d expected to be the one making all the apologies today.
Leaning against the wall were three bags of supplies. One held the heat sheets and briefs. The sheets were plain white, easy to clean, and bleach. The briefs were plain grey, dark and thick to absorb slick and hide any dampness.
"Do you ever leave?"
Castiel shrugged.
“Have I told you how much I love you lately?” Dean asks.
Any lightness in Dean's features was gone in an instant. He remembered hearing Sam describe Cas over the phone to the doctor, 'cause Dean was too shaken up himself to do it. He hadn't heard what had been said on the other line, but the worried look on Sam's face when his head shot up to look at his brother had been more than enough to tell Dean it was bad.
Whatever explanation Cas was going to give, Dean didn’t think he could bear to hear it. Being rejected was painful enough. He didn’t need an itemized list of the reasons he wasn’t good enough.
“What supplies?” he asked through a mouthful of jam and peanut butter.
As if sensing he was being watched, Cas slowly opened his eyes and looked at Dean. The hunter stared back in opened mouthed, wide eyed shock. His brain just simply stopped working. He didn't even have the wherewithal to jump off the bed, to immediately assume this was a shifter or maybe a siren. He was frozen in place, staring into eyes he never thought he'd see again.
Cas had only been meditating for a few minutes, he'd only just evened out his breathing and relax his vessel, as well as his true from within his vessel, when his expanded mind had picked up on Dean. In this state, he could feel the hunter's pain, his restless sleep, the beginnings of what would soon become a horrible hangover. Despite what Bobby had said about leaving Dean until morning, every fibre in the angel had told him to go to the hunter. Withing seconds, his choice had been made, and he carefully made his way up the creaking steps of the old cabin, following the pull of Dean's anguish.
Cas wished he’d thought this through more before bringing it up. If he had more concrete desires beyond
“Cas, Cas...” Dean moaned in a tone Cas hadn’t heard from him before. It was higher, verging on desperate, but also relaxed in a way. Unabashed, genuine. He found he wanted to hear that tone more.
There was a pause over the phone before Charlie answered.
“You... you don’t...?”
“I’m so sorry, Dean.”
Dean cried out wordlessly, going taut as a bowstring as he shuddered through his orgasm. The sounds he made were too much, and Cas ground forward against the mattress, his own peak following shortly behind Dean’s. Somehow he had the presence of mind to keep working Dean through his pleasure, gradually reducing the pressure from his mouth and fingers before Dean could become over-sensitive.
“Like I said, I was going blind. Now? My vision has never been better. This guy, well, he's worth checking out. I can give you the address.”
He tried to say something, but just ended up opening and closing his mouth dumbly. He finally found his voice.
. You know, it’s normal.”
Dean forced himself to take a deep breath before his overactive, protective alpha could get too worked up. He would never let that happen to Cas.
/“My heart it like an open highway! Like Frankie said, I did it my way! I just want to live while I'm alive. It's my life!”/
a problem.
An impatient whine from Dean made Castiel realize he’d stopped moving, too distracted by trying to learn and memorize the parts of Dean that were new to him. When Dean’s hands came down to tug at his hair, becoming desperate, Castiel grinned and moved again.
“Relax, I got it under control now,” Dean reassured Sam. “Thanks for pulling out the steaks.”
“And you want that to continue?”
“About what?” came the gruff reply, before the older hunter took a swig from his beer.
“Why didn’t you call?” Dean asked, running his fingers through Castiel’s sweaty hair. His temperature was a little high, and Dean was sure he was feeling his heat by now. “You know I would’ve come straight home.”
. They never stayed in one place long. They gripped the sheets, ran through Castiel’s hair, clutched at his shoulders, all only for seconds before starting somewhere else again. In fact, it seemed no part of Dean could stay still. His stomach jumped and clenched, his legs shook, toes curled... Castiel wasn’t one to brag, but he was fairly confident he wasn’t doing too badly for his first time.
Slowly, so slowly, Dean leaned in until his lips gently brushed against Castiel’s. He pulled back and waited a beat, eyes scanning Cas’s. What he saw there was surprise and wonder. But also worry.
"Thank you." Castiel whispered, his eyes falling shut.
“No, Dean,” Cas chuckled. “I mean, it’s
Dean suppressed a growl at the thought of Cas’s scent attracting others. Especially while he was homeless and vulnerable. It was no secret how much danger omegas living on the street faced. Castiel could have wound up in a really dangerous situation. It was no wonder he’d hidden his omega status.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel said, and Dean could hear the smile in his voice.
“It's very complicated.”
“No, I do!” Cas said quickly. “I love it.”
Cas moved back to his place between Dean’s legs, resting on his belly, hard cock pressed into the mattress, Dean spread out before him. He kissed his way forward, inching up the inside of Dean’s thigh. His breath barely brushed where Dean was most sensitive when the legs under his hands trembled. Castiel paused, looking up at where Dean was watching him.
Something deep in Dean clung to those words. His chest tightened and his own heart spend up for an entirely different reason.
“I will give him time.”
The bartender, Sam thought he had heard someone call him Doug, leaned further over the counter and looked Gary in the eye. His next words were almost a whisper.
Castiel hummed like he was mulling it over, but the smile on his face and the bright look in his eye told Dean everything he needed to know.
“I have sexier ideas for later, but you’re tense and I want you relaxed first.”
Yeah, Dean remembered that. He remembered using that to gross Sam out when he was younger. Until Sam also presented alpha and could do it back.
He trailed kisses along Cas’s jaw, down his throat towards where the smell was strongest. Even fresh out of the shower, Castiel’s mating gland was still pouring out a delicious scent. Dean laid a gentle kiss there, feeling goosebumps form under his lips.
Once he was close enough, he hammered on the brakes and cranked the wheel to the side, effectively sliding the car sideways and blocking the road. He opened his door and got out, aiming his 9 mm at the front window of the van.
Dean's mind was racing, trying to figure out if he was dealing with monsters, and if so, what kind, or just people.
"Dean? You wanna drop the head and give me a hand?"
“Hold yourself more accountable than others. Something happens, and you decide you have to deal with it and the consequences alone.”
“What is that exactly?”
"If all monsters of the same breed are generally the same and work the same, we thought perhaps all shape-shifters have a system of sorts. If they do and we can figure it out, they would be much easier to track and find."
Dean didn't say anything, but he made a point of not letting go of Cas' hand. His glare and clenched fist was his only response. The hunters and angel all knew this guy wasn't sorry for what he said, he was just sorry he'd pissed off the wrong people.
Dean woke up to silence. He was surprised he had managed to sleep at all, though looking at the time on his phone, it hadn't been for long. Maybe a half hour max. He sat up and groaned, glancing around the dingy cabin room. They wouldn't be staying here if those damn leviathans hadn't burnt down Bobby's house in the first place.
Cas smiled and calmed himself down, wiping his face as his hunter did the same.
“Of course I will go to him, if you can drive me there.”
“No, but Cas was technically genderless, he was an angel.”
“And, I want... I want to show you how much I love you. Every day. ’Cause you should know.”
“Cas? Hey, Cas, you okay?”
“Your boss said you guys are meant to leave us alone.”
As much as he wanted to grasp Dean's hand again, he didn't. Slowly, he turned to start walking out of the park, the hunter at his side. He thought he'd heard Dean sigh, but he wasn't sure.
"No, I...I meant it, Dean."
Dean leans in and kisses Castiel. It’s slow and gentle and fills the spaces between his ribs with warmth when Castiel kisses back. After a moment, Dean pulls away so he can look Castiel in the eye.
Dean drops his hips to the mattress and turns his head on the pillow until he can see Castiel’s concerned eyes watching him.
The angel nodded in acceptance.
Dean heard a gentle knocking on the door.
He hated apologizing. He did it when he knew he needed to, but he didn't like it, he didn't like admitting how wrong he had been, even if Sam was being a little pouty bitch about the whole thing. He hadn't talked to Dean since his brother snapped and yelled at him earlier that day for making a joke about him and Cas.
“I don't know how I'm alive, Dean. As for what happened and why I'm here, Sam found me.”
Sam made his way downstairs, the smile never leaving his face. He was happy that Dean had his angel back. That in their hard, crazy lives, something was going right. Dean had someone who really understood him and could be there for him.
Cas shook his head.
it would be much easier to explain to Dean. He would never disclose details of their sex life, or Dean’s trans status, but part of him wished there was someone he could talk to about all this. A second opinion outside of his own would help him figure out how to broach Dean’s apparent aversion.
Dean was looking down at where they were joined too. He smiled and gave Cas' hand a little squeeze. Reluctantly, Castiel pulled his hand away.
“No! No!”
Sam could hear the disdain in his brother's voice, which he found odd considering they hadn't had a cut and dry case for a long time, and that's what Dean had said he wanted. Simple hunts. The hunter hung up his phone and turned to Sam.
“Comfort sex. But... I still couldn’t enjoy it. I asked him if we could just hang out instead and he said he just wanted sex.”
In one shaky but determined motion, Dean stood, aimed his gun and shot. The shifter dropped next to Sam. Dean then proceeded to empty his clip into the thing's body, even though his first bullet had been a clean head shot. Sam made no motion to stop him, the damage was already done. The only hope they'd had of finding the hostages, had just had a clip of silver bullets emptied into his head and chest.
The younger hunter shook his head.
Outside the door, Dean paused. He couldn’t hear anything, but the smell was definitely coming from his room. Maybe they were just taking a nap between-
“Yeah, I know you do. I have a few ideas about what I wanna do with you. I’m just not sure where to start.”
Still, no hands touch him.
Dean had helped an omega with a heat once or twice, and it was pretty common for them to feel like that between sex. They must have caught Cas post-jerk-off.
“I saw at the demons and it was almost instinctual, I knew I could kill them. When I smote them, my memories came back.” he explained, as if reading from a text book. As if this was the sorta thing that happened all the time, and he was merely explaining it, rather than just figuring it out himself. His hard gaze softened a bit before he spoke again. “Sam, I am so sorry for what I did to you, I should never have broken your wall. I will try to fix you.”
“That bad, huh?” The older hunter asked, handing Sam a beer as he did. Bobby opened his own and sat down next to one of his adopted sons.
"You're still a smart ass."
"No, not yet anyways. It seems random."
“I don’t...” Dean started, but his voice cracked and he had to clear his throat before continuing. “Don’t really have much feeling there.”
The healer nodded, taking in this information.
“I know I shoulda told you the truth upfront, but I’m glad we’re talking now.”
Castiel was still trying to see through the trees, but it was too dark. He hated the dark. Cas nodded at Dean's words.
“Up until they showed up this morning, I thought they had been dead for months.”
“Dean,” Castiel said, sitting up to catch Dean’s nervous eyes. “I’m not interested in what makes sense, I’m interested in what you want. Do you want this?”
“Cas, I was the one who lied. I’ve had a lot of practice, I’m pretty good at it. It’s not your fault for not knowing. You shouldn’t have to spend time figuring out if I’m being honest with you.”
/“I'm tired of pretending, but I'm terrified of it ending. I know if not for you, there's nothing I could do to ever let it end.”/
“Did you pay your check first? 'Cause you won't be able to after.”
territory to defend.
Once after him and Sam had been fighting, Dean couldn't remember about what, he had been upset and left to drive around in the Impala. He had only been gone a few minutes when he started to smell something delicious coming from the back seat. He'd looked in the rear-view mirror just in time to see the angel's mysterious smile before he vanished, leaving behind a pie sitting in a box on the seat.
Sam gave him an unimpressed look. Yeah, yeah, who was Dean to bitch about someone avoiding a conversation? Castiel had probably learned it from him.
Hesitation.
“Yes, I heard.”
“For your heat,” Dean said, pulling out his phone to text Sam as he explained it to Cas. “There’s special underwear and heat sheets that will help contain any, uh, mess we make, and keep you cooler. Snack food so we don’t have to cook is important. Um, a heating pad and ginger tea to help with cramps-”
“What are you talking about?”
They stay like that, Castiel sitting with his face buried in Dean’s chest, Dean standing and holding Cas close for longer than either knows. Two minutes or ten, it doesn’t matter. When Cas finally pulls back, his eyes are red-rimmed, but he looks more relaxed and happy than Dean’s seen all week.
“Cas...” Dean moaned, already sounding breathless.
That got a snort out of Cas, and Dean grinned back. He never wanted Cas to feel self-conscious about any of this. Heats happened. Ruts happened. It was just a part of life.
Bobby groaned, stretched and leaned back into the chair he was sitting in. It wasn't even noon yet and he was already exhausted after spending hours on the phone and computer.
Dean's tone bordered on pleading and desperate. Sam could see that the denial was slowly slipping from his brother's mind, and it wouldn't be long before he did something drastic. Sam knew he had to get the gun away from him soon. The hostages couldn't afford rash decisions right now.
/	The bar was packed that night. And loud. People were dancing and singing and shouting over the noise, making it louder.
“You have a fight with Cas?”
Dean stared for a moment longer, mouth dropped in shock.
Castiel’s face falls, and Dean knows instantly he was misunderstood.
“I’ve wanted to bathe with you long before my heat started. I just didn’t want my intentions misconstrued.”
"Please, Dean." the angel pleaded. "Please."
He wasn’t entirely sure how it worked, but he’d heard several omegas say that the cold made their heat cramps worse. Especially if their feet got cold. That’s why he’d also brought Cas a pair of wool socks normally reserved for winter hunts, and the thickest pair of sweats Cas had.
“Are you doing that because
Dean didn’t want Castiel to feel bad for ruining a mattress, so he quickly pulled it off the box spring and dragged it across the hall into an unused room. He could throw it away later when no one would see. For now, he leaned it against the wall and pulled the clean mattress from the other bed to Castiel’s room.
Sam was silent for so long Dean pulled the phone away from his ear to make sure he hadn’t accidentally hung up. But his screen said he was still connected, the little timer counting the seconds as the call went on.
Finally, the hunter crouched down near the wall. He looked over to Cas, who was watching him from the bed. The angle nodded slowly. Taking in a deep breath, Dean pulled the plug.
“It’s how alphas stay anchored to an omega during mating. When the alpha orgasms, the base of their penis swells into a knot, keeping them locked inside the omega to increase the chance of a successful breeding.”
“He won't talk to me Bobby. Something is really bugging him, he just gets quiet and annoyed then ignores me or tries to leave whenever I try to bring it up. You had to have noticed he's been different since the day Cas died.”
The Impala purred as Dean pulled into the parking lot. Even though he hadn't said anything, Dean could tell Cas was at least curious, if not excited about the game. He had never really watched sports before, certainly never been to a game.
Castiel nods. He’d been through the wringer two these past few days, and he looks it. It’s still strange to Dean to see something like fatigue affecting Castiel. Sometimes he forgets Cas is human now and needs more than the four hours a night Dean used to get by on.
Mike didn't hesitate to take the chance to leave. He jumped back in his van, slammed it into reverse so hard Sam could hear the transmission groan in protest, and did the fasted three point turn the hunter had ever seen. Soon the beige van was speeding back the way it had come.
“May I?” he asked. He
“Yes, it did. You were right, being clean feels much better. Dean, how did you know to do all this?”
“Oh. So that’s why there’s leftovers,” Dean teases. Castiel tries to give him a disapproving look, but his serious facade cracks almost instantly.
Castiel didn’t look convinced, so Dean went on.
Dean hummed happily into it, letting his hands glide into damp curls. Cas smelled like happy omega, but the underlying smell of Dean’s soap thrilled his alpha.
No such luck. Five minutes later, not only had Dean not stopped, but he was now cupping Cas' face and kissing him. It was sweet, in a way that Sam didn't really want to see. The younger brother knew this was something meant to be private, and if Dean hadn't tipsy and on a hunting high, he wouldn't be doing this in front of anyone, let alone the whole bar.
“Look, you don't have to tell me what he did. Hell, you didn't have to tell me anything, I still would've poured you a drink, but let me ask you this; Why did he do whatever it is he did?”
your heats either. And if you aren’t
“You should be proud.”
Dean wondered how to explain this to Charlie when he wasn’t sure he understood it himself. He didn’t want to make an ass out of himself or embarrass Cas. But he also didn’t want to without too much and make it harder to get answers.
“Whoa! No one is trying for pups,” Dean said, only just remembering to keep his voice down so Cas didn’t hear.
He knew both he and Cas knew the answer to that. They could never tell anyone about this. Ever. Not even their families. Especially not their families. Dean could still remember what had happened to Eddie Geller and Patrick Green when they got caught. Eddie's body was found miles out of town, so beaten and bloody that for a while the sheriff hadn't even been sure it was him at first. His face had been beaten in with a tire iron, both is arms and one of his legs had been shattered. If the beating with the tire iron hadn't killed him, everyone was pretty sure his broken ribs stabbing his lungs had ended it. No one knew who'd done it, but after they found out about him and Patrick, no one had cared. The sheriff hadn't even pretended to try and find out who had been involved. Patrick ran away the day after Eddie was found, and no one had heard from him since. His family didn't seem to care.
“Do I give off any... pheromones or whatever?”
“How...but...how are you...?”
“Really. Cas, I love you. You’re... you’re it for me.”
"Dean?" Sam cautiously asked.
The Harvelles were family friends, apparently Mr. Harvelle used to work with John, so when Dean needed a job, they happily gave him one. Dean suspected they payed him more than the work was worth, still, he wasn't gonna complain.
The kettle whistled, and Dean moved it off the burner. He could smell Sam getting impatient as he ignored the question in favour of getting out Cas’s favourite mug. It was something cheesy Dean had seen at the store and bought for him on a whim. It was white, with a green aloe plant on one side, and the words “
Cas blushed, looking down at the pile of blankets he was sitting in. Nesting was very normal, but this was the first time Castiel had done it. He probably didn’t fully understand the urge yet.
Castiel frowned, tilting his head to the side in a way Dean would not admit he found cute.
“Yes,” Cas answered quickly. “More than anything.”
"Great."
When he got back inside, he was about to go check on Dean, when the heavy flap of wings announced the arrival of the angel and Sam. Bobby turned and saw Cas, not quite sure he believed the guy was really here.
Dean grimaced.
“Possibly a lot,” Dean added. Castiel snorted, and a moment later Dean’s laughter joined his own.
It would embarrass them both, but if Dean didn't stop soon, Sam was gonna tell him and Cas it was time to go. He was gearing up to do just that, when a loud, booming voice surprised him.
“I want this to work, Cas,” Dean says, the most sincere thing he’s said all night. “You have to know that.”
“After that, when she tried to suggest we should do it again, I’d brush her off. Finally, she got fed up and asked if there was someone else. I tried to explain the sex thing, and she just laughed. Said all men want sex, so I must either be lying, or I wasn’t a real man.”
“That angel sure did a number on him.” Bobby thought as he headed upstairs to force feed the depressed hunter a burger and some soda. He knew it wasn't the healthiest thing, but it was better than Dean living off beer and whatever was in that flask.
The unassuming, beige van stirred up dust as it sped down the gravel road. It was too far away yet to see a driver, but the van was going so fast the Winchesters could only assume whoever was controlling the vehicle was in a rush. It didn't look to be slowing down, and being so far from town, the brothers couldn't help but worry that the monster who'd led them here was planning an ambush.
“I’ve never experienced it. Other omegas have told me it feels wonderful, but I never had the desire to find out.”
Sam didn’t look convinced.
Dean chuckled.
Dean produced two tickets from his pocket, beaming at Cas when he handed him one.
Dean once again thought this didn’t look like the flu. Despite Cas’s fever-bright eyes and flushed face, something in Dean wasn’t convinced.
“Sam, you've seen Dean around women. Have you ever seen him look at a guy that way?”
generous. Which was great in a lot of ways, since it meant he often took control, allowing Cas to surrender and enjoy the sensations he had been unfamiliar with. It was nice to be taken care of, especially by someone who took the time to learn what he liked and worked so hard to make every experience special.
mode. He had left his own needs out of the equation. Mistakenly, he’d thought Cas needed anything more than his company. That if he couldn’t give him his body too, then Castiel would realize there was nothing worth staying for.
"Please say something."
Castiel sits up then, but he doesn’t get off the bed or say anything. He just sits cross-legged on the mattress, watching Dean like he’s waiting for something. It takes a moment, but Dean finally realizes Cas is waiting for him to sit up too.
Cas laid out in the middle of their bed, sweaty and flush. There was absolutely no smell of sex in the room, and no sign of anyone else in there. But the smell was coming from this room, so that must mean-
It was just past noon, and Sam and Bobby decided to check around outside the house and make sure all the angel/demon proofing was still good. It might not stop the leviathans, but it gave the hunters a few less things to worry about. Bobby was looking over the symbols painted on the house and nearby trees while Sam stood guard with a sawed off shotgun, watching surrounding woods. The youngest Winchester decided to bring up what he'd noticed about Dean, to see if Bobby had notice the same thing.
“I talked to some friends, left messages with the rest to call me back. So far, nothing.”
“Yeah, I’m good. Just a little out of it.”
Dean thanked Sam before saying goodnight. The younger brother nodded went to lay down in the other room, while Dean squeezed in between Cas and the back of the couch. It was a tight squeeze, but well worth it. He wrapped one of his arms around the angel's waist and snuggled in closer, enjoying the warmth. Dean sighed. He had Cas, and even though tonight had ended badly, there were still leviathans on the loose, and him and the angel still had some issues to sort out, he was happier than he'd been in a long time.
Dean wouldn’t bother saying anything normally, but money was tight right now, and heat-strength k-condoms were pretty expensive. No sense in Sam buying them if they were just gonna sit in a box until they expired.
The hunt had been easy, Bobby was right about the vamps. There had only been five of them in the nest, and they'd all been asleep. The brothers had managed to kill three before the last two had woken up. Simple. An easy hunt, for once.
“You know,” Dean said. “Would it help if you… got yourself off?”
"They were good, hey?" Dean asked, grinning happily.
Silence. Dean strained to hear anything. He could tell someone was shuffling around in there, but he still wasn't getting an answer.
But this time, Cas doesn’t blush and smile and duck his head. He tenses.
Dean grins and leans in for another kiss, greedy after being denied so long. Castiel obliges happily.
Dean let out a shaky breath. He hadn’t realized he’d been holding it, maybe for years, until he heard those four words. But they made something click into place, like he’d been walking around with a piece of himself rattling around. Now he felt settled. As much as he pretended not to be a sap, he knew what it was. It was Cas finally fitting into his life the way he was always meant to. Dean had never felt like this about anyone else. Not Cassie, not even Lisa. They never felt like they were part of him, had never wormed their way in that deep.
So far, it seemed pretty quiet. No weird deaths in the obituary, no missing persons, nothing. He was about to fold the paper back up when something caught his eye. There was gonna be a band playing at one of the bars in town. Dean didn't recognize their name, he guessed it was probably a garage band. They were pretty good sometimes, usually they just played songs by other bands. Quickly, an idea formed in his head.
The angel mumbled something in Enochian that neither Sam nor Dean understood, before his legs gave out and he fell against the car. Sam rushed around to help his brother load the drunk angel into the back seat, both of them grumbling at how heavy he was. Dean climbed in after, saying he would ride with him. Sam smirked and returned to the driver's seat.
The older hunter had been as vague as possible, for Dean's sake. He was well respected, or at least feared, in the hunting community. He would lose a lot of his credibility if a word of this got out. Even hunters who had dealt with the Winchester before wouldn't take him seriously if they heard about Cas or the depression. Sadly, many of them shared John's old mentality.
"Yes! Finally! I have been trying to find Cain for years to complete my collection, but now I have something better. The new Father of Murder himself."
“Wear scent blockers or not, that’s your choice. Don’t do anything for me you wouldn’t want to do for yourself, okay?”
Cas gestured to his sweaty, disheveled self. Yeah, clearly he wasn’t done with... whatever this was. Dean kept silent, afraid if he said the wrong thing, Cas would stop talking.
Screw it. Dean hadn’t been one for making people learn the hard way since Sam broke his arm when they were kids. He knew how to make this better, and damn it, Cas was going to let him.
"You don't think you deserve to be loved."
“Thanks, Charlie.”
Beth hadn't notice Dean yet, she was busy serving the guys at the other end of the bar. Once she was done, she made her way towards them, not really paying attention.
Castiel, who had been calm and observant this whole time, was very concerned. He knew Dean must have been in bad shape for Sam to seek out a healer, but the realization fully hit him now. Dean hadn't been getting on with his life. He had tried to, but when all that pain he had been trying to ignore was revealed and become inescapable, he couldn't cope.
Dean blushed, but stood when Cas did to make things easier. His stomach jumped when Castiel’s knuckles grazed the skin to undo Dean’s belt. Now Cas was more glad than ever that he’d chosen to begin with a massage. Dean’s body was one solid line of nervous tension.
Sam went to sleep soon, but Bobby stayed up. He needed to talk to Castiel. Leaning back against the table and crossing his arms, he fixed Cas with a cold glare.
The angel looked up at Dean and smiled.
Dean can tell in an instant that was the exact right thing to say. Like a balloon deflating, he sees tension drain out of Castiel in one large exhale. He crumbles forward, a single sob escaping his throat, but it’s all relief.
Dean froze, hands resting on Cas’s hips.
, then you aren’t gonna give off ‘please stick a knot in me now’ pheromones.”
The angel interrupted the two brothers, turning his soft gaze towards Dean, his voice even softer.
"Do you think we can ever tell them?" Castiel asked quietly, running the tips of his fingers over Dean's bare stomach.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Don’t say the knot thing again.”
“Really, Cas? That’s the sexiest thing your mind went to?”
Sam rolled his eyes.
The grip on his hand tightens. Not painfully, just enough that he knows Cas is still holding him on purpose. He also knows he could pull away if he wanted to, and Castiel would let go. Dean doesn’t pull away.
after that. Come on, I want to.”
Dean sighed.
After his talk with Sam, Dean was feeling pretty good about things. They finished out the hunt easily, and Dean was singing and drumming on the steering wheel on the way home. He was always excited to see Cas, but this time there wasn’t so much lingering doubt bogging him down. He just wanted to get home, scoop Cas up into his arms, and test out Sam’s theory.
Castiel turns them both and guides Dean until the backs of his knees hit the bed. There is a light shove against his chest and he flops back onto the mattress where he can see Cas smiling down at him. Dean tries to return the smile, but he thinks it feels forced. Castiel tilts his head, but before he can ask if something is wrong, Dean sits up and grabs him by the waist of his pants, pulling him onto the bed. It works and that soft, happy smile returns as Cas crawls up Dean’s body to kiss him again. When Cas grinds down onto him, Dean angles his hips so Cas isn’t rubbing directly against his uninterested dick.
“Think about it Bobby. Cas was a lot closer to Dean than he was to me or you. The way Dean acted around him, the way they would stare at each other...”
Bobby shook his head and stormed off. Dean sighed, if they would just let him deal with this on his own...
Still no response. That was definitely not like Sam.
Cas frowned in confusion, before looking down at his shirt and pants.
The smile that lit up Castiel’s face made Dean feel warm, distracted him enough that he was completely useless to help remove his shirt. It took a grumble from Cas, complaining about how many layers he always wore, to make Dean realize the omega was trying to push his flannel off his shoulders.
“Well, your brother did have the small matter of the Apocalypses to deal with.”
Dean can tell that answer doesn’t satisfy Castiel. He’s still tense and looking at Dean like he’s waiting for some sign that he’s telling the truth.
Dean turned and practically ran up the stairs.
Castiel nods slowly.
The Winchester parked the Impala as close as he could get to the main doors, and lead Castiel inside.
“Yeah, well, I would have stocked up if I had any idea this was coming,” Dean said.
“I was shocked when I saw him.” the hunter went on. “This morning, I mean. I was glad I guess. Hell, I haven't been happier in months. But at the same time...I don't know, I was pissed. He did something that was...I just don't know if I can forgive him.”
The angel looked up from methodically wiping down the door. He could see Sam was standing now, leaning on the roof of the truck. There was anger in the hunter's eyes, and with good reason. Cas stood up as well and turned his full attention to Sam.
An hour later, the game has long since been abandoned. After Dean had found a way to turn Scabble into a drinking game, nobody had been able to keep score. Dean was pretty sure at one point someone had put 'et' down, claiming it was the past tense of 'eat', and no one had challenged. That was pretty much the end of that. Neither brother would ever admit it, but they were bother pretty sure Cas had won. He was nearly impossible to get drunk, and he spoke every language ever, so it was pretty damn likely the game had been easy for him. Especially after Sam had passed out of the table.
“Can I come in?”
Castiel faltered a bit, swaying in his seat and nearly falling onto the hunter before he caught himself.
Sam paused. He had an idea, but he wasn't sure if it was a good one. Or even a possible one. He'd certainly never heard of it working on that kind of level, but maybe...
“So then you admit it is a word.” Cas stated.
Mostly, Dean was so happy he didn’t even mind the waiting. But he was concerned. He knew Castiel was new to being human, new to being in a relationship, new to intimacy, that was a lot of new all at once. It would overwhelm anyone. Adding sex into the mix might just be too much right now. If Cas wanted to wait, that was fine.
“Well, yeah. The guy broke my brother.”
“I did,” Cas said. He wanted to lean forward and kiss Dean, but he felt so heavy and tired he settled for kissing the shoulder that was only an inch away instead. “Very much.”
Sam's eyes widened and he gaped at his brother for a moment, before his gaze briefly flicked to the staircase, and then over to the empty living room. Where Cas had been when they'd all gone to sleep but was now obviously absent from.
“Well, he touched me, and my eye healed.”
Dean smiled when the music started. He had to give them credit for opening with Van Halen's "Panama". They were doing a good job of it too. The musicians didn't butcher it, and the singer could hit most of the notes, even doing the talking bit in the middle.
“You want something on Netflix?”
"Oh! Right," He fished around in his inside pocket, feeling for the paper. "You've been human for a year now, and you've been on earth a lot longer than that. It's time you became more cultured."
“Where is Dean?” Cas asked as he looked around. Due to his shame and guilt, he hadn't realized exactly how much he wanted to see the hunter until he was so close. From here, he could sense Dean's presence, but couldn't pinpoint exactly where he was.
It still hurts, but it hurts less with Cas’s hand in his, anchoring him with the knowledge that Cas isn’t going anywhere.
"Who are you two? And what in the name of God were you talking about?" he asked, looking directly at Dean. "Demons and Hell, and what was all that about some guy?"
Sam paused.
"I'm glad."
"Dean, I can't move my own body. The doctor said the build up of spinal fluid in my back is getting worse. The seizures are more frequent and getting stronger. We both know we're waiting for the one that will make me a vegetable."
"Yeah, I know. Just...thanks anyways."
“Then what is this about? I might not be an angel anymore, Dean, but I know you. I know something is wrong. What aren’t you telling me?”
Dean felt the urge to reach out and run his fingers through Cas’s sweat-damp hair, rub his shoulder, something to comfort him. But he kept his hands firmly on his knees.
“It's not too late. Damn it Cas, we can fix this!” His voice cracked as he broke down. Tears streamed down his face as he stared at the angel, his angel.
Dean sputtered, nearly choking on his beer. “You did what?”
For the first couple weeks after his brother told him what was going on between him and Cas, Sam had been surprised and a little uncomfortable with it. Not that Dean was with a guy, he hadn't cared about that, it was just odd thinking of him and Cas and him /and/ Cas. Thankfully, the couple had been discreet at first, mostly because they were still getting used to each other. Now though, they weren't subtle at all. Sam saw the exchanged smiles, the touching of hands here and there, even a few quick kisses that were meant to be mostly private. Never in public though, Dean wasn't /that/ open about it.
The ex-angel turned towards Dean, his own smile growing.
“After Jill, I was scared to try anything like that again for a long time. But then I met Maggie, and she was just so nice, you know? Soft-spoken, gentle. I thought maybe with her I could...”
Another two days passed before Bobby informed Sam that everyone he'd called had phoned back. None of them had any information that the two hunters were looking for. Sam had to leave the cabin and go for a drive to calm down. He wasn't angry at Bobby, it wasn't his fault that none of his friends could help them, Sam was just scared for his brother.
“No.”
Sam tossed the dirty rag into the trunk before he climbed into the car. Dean joined him soon, after he set the barn on fire. They had to get rid of the evidence, and with the vamps and the bodies of all the victims, burning everything was the easiest way to cover all this up. No need to cause suspicion and confusion in the local police station when the morgue attendant noticed fangs.
“No, I mean-” Sam said, still sounding baffled. “Whenever you would hook up after a hunt, you stank. I couldn’t even be in the car with you until you showered.”
Hearing that Cas got it, that he could empathize with Dean’s reasoning, helped Dean relax. It gave him hope Castiel would forgive him for lying and causing them both so much pain.
Dean ducked his head to rest between Cas’s shoulder blades. Cas did indeed feel a little less warm already.
Dean frowned.
“No, no, Cas, I’m not trying to guilt you. I’m saying it’s my fault. And... I want to tell you what’s been going on with me.”
“Okay, yeah, but Jimmy was a vessel for over a decade, not just a week or a month. And it’s not like Cas left his body, he became human in it. He might not have regular vessel issues. What if something went wrong during that ritual?”
"What about Sam?"
Dean was vaguely aware of a group of four guys watching him and Cas from a corner booth, but he shook it off and tried to ignore them. It had been a tough hunt, and he decided he deserved a relaxing drink or two.
Castiel shook his head, pulling his face out of his pillow enough to talk.
Dean had forced himself to eat and drink, for Bobby's sake, but he was still drunk, and he hadn't slept well in weeks. It was a wonder he had made it this far without just passing out already.
Dean glanced out the window again at the two cops leaning against their car, an open box of doughnuts sitting on the hood between them. Each officer held one of the glazed treats in their hands.
Dean sighed. Part of him wished he could leave for an hour to clear his head, but a much bigger part of him absolutely refused to leave his omega right now. Unless-
“I loved you long before we had sex. I’ll continue loving you even if we never have sex again.”
“This nameless, anonymous omega,” Charlie added dryly.
Dean’s frown deepened.
“What if...I mean...what if-”
,” Dean panted. “Fuckfuckfuck, there. Keep doing that,” Dean babbled, hips fucking down on Cas’s fingers and mouth. He was so enthusiastic he nearly dislodged Cas a few times, but Cas wouldn’t have it any other way. He’d never seen Dean like this before, and he couldn’t get enough of it.
Cas flopped back onto the mattress, a heavy sigh escaping him.
Castiel hasn’t let go of his hand or looked away from his eyes once. But it doesn’t make Dean feel scrutinized or trapped, it makes him feel seen and heard.
“You've made quite a life for yourself, Dean. Despite everything.” the monster droned. The hunter barely hmm'd in acknowledgement. Just enough so that the damned thing wouldn't repeat it's self, as it seemed so found of doing.
When Dean and Sam got into the bunker properly, Dean’s heart fell so fast it hurt. Someone else was here. An omega. Not just an omega, though. This one was in heat. And their smell was so intertwined with Cas, no way those two weren’t all over each other.
"Okay."
“Oh, it's a strange story, you may not like it.”
When Castiel kissed him, Dean had forgotten that. He’d gone back into
“I just want you to know, I forgive you. We're good.”
“Look, I know what you two were to each other, Dean told me. He also told me you loved him. I need to know, did you?”
"They, uh...They said it doesn't look good."
“I find it comforting,” Castiel said. “It makes me feel safe.”
“Can’t believe you’re making me cook fruit
Dean had had plenty of time over the years to think about exactly what else he wanted. Like a floodgate opening, all those thoughts and desires rushed out.
“Yeah, it was. But she’s okay now, so don’t go getting all alpha huffy, okay?”
But then Castiel came along and all he wanted was
Before he could finish, Dean had a hand around the back of his neck and the base of his head, pulling him forward into an enthusiastic kiss. It took the ex-angel a moment to process what was happening, then he was eagerly responding and kissing back, his own hand carding through Dean's hair. After a few long moments, they both pulled away, breathless. Dean rested his forehead against Castiel's, breathing heavily.
Dean continued making the list while Castiel ate.
“-Oh, Sam is gonna want some of that Neutru spray. We probably will too, honestly. The smell of another alpha might be uncomfortable for you, and I’m sure Sam won’t wanna smell us.”
But this wasn’t about him right now. And as much as it tempted him to sneak a hand down between his legs, he wanted to focus on Dean more. So when Dean raised his hips, Castiel gratefully pulled his boxers off, grinning once he had Dean fully naked. It wasn’t a rare occurrence, but it was a treat every time. Especially now when he could see how wet and flushed Dean was.
“Nothing?” Bobby asked, his voice just a tad higher than normal, and full of surprise.
a flu then he just needs rest, and if it
“Yes, it would,” Castiel answers quickly.
“You think you can take me?” he laughed out.
Sam blushed, looking away in embarrassment. He focused on his tiles as if they were suddenly the most interesting things in the room. “It was a way to meet girls.” he finally muttered. His cheeks had turned a nice shade of red as he tried to play it off. Cas either didn't notice or didn't care about being the cause of Sam's embarrassment.
Now Bobby sounded pissed.
“Look, um... you didn’t do anything wrong, okay?” Dean starts, hoping Castiel will listen and will believe him. “You asked permission for everything, you checked in, you stopped when you thought something was wrong... Cas, you did everything you’re supposed to. It’s not your fault I lied when I answered.”
Dean took a deep breath.
"See? Guy with the munchies. Nothing to worry about."
“I don’t want an alpha.”
can’t be normal. Maybe he’s cursed, or sick, or something is up with his hormones, but you should get him to a doctor-”
Sometimes they liked to fantasize about telling their families about this, and having everyone accept them. Dean liked to think that if Sam found out, he wouldn't be disgusted. That his dad wouldn't beat him and disown him, if not kill him. Cas liked to think that Michael wouldn't go after Dean, that Gabriel wouldn't stop hanging out with him and looking out for him.
“Did you clean in here?”
He’s here because he wants to be.
“You know, I'm not sure why I'm telling you any of this.”
Sam replied with a little defensiveness in his voice. He raised his head a little and stood up straighter.
Sam shook his head.
“Alright, you need to sum everything up. Now. What was the going on between you and Cas?”
Sam knew that if they didn't figure out something soon, his brother wouldn't be around much longer. No human being could treat their body like this and last very long.
The angel watched the road as he answered.
Dean kept his gun, loaded with silver bullets, aimed at the kneeling shifter's head, as he shot Sam a questioning look. Sam looked to the shifter, who only watched the van with detached interest, occasionally glancing at Dean before looking away again.
“And you can’t go,” Sam said. No bitching, just stating a fact. An alpha leaving an omega during their heat was not advisable. “Don’t worry, I’ll head into town. It’s been a while since I had to do a supply run for this kinda thing. Text me a list and I’ll be quick as I can.”
**********
“What’s wrong, Dean?”
Dean swung both legs over the side of the couch and sat up, leaning against the backrest, frowning at his brother.
There was a quiet knock at the door, but it was followed by footsteps retreating down the hall. Sam knew better than to actually
“Dean, don't try to tell me you're okay.” Sam started, catching his brother's attention. In retrospect, it probably wasn't the best way to start the conversation, but he needed Dean to be honest with him. He needed to know what was wrong. “I mean, you kept zoning out on that last case, the drinking, you clearly aren't sleeping. What's going on with you, man? This isn't how someone who doesn't feel guilty acts.”
“Dean? Are you alright?”
Cas shook his head.
Dean was laying on his side, facing Cas, wrapped up in his arms and tucked against his chest. Dean smiled happily, the booze in his system lowing his defences enough that he didn't try to hide the fact that he loved this. Castiel watched him as Dean zoned in and out, drifting in that hazy, relaxed state of not-quiet-asleep-but-not-awake-either. As the hunter closed his eyes, finally about to sink into unconsciousness, he heard Cas murmur three words into his hair.
“As long as you’re sure it’s not just because of your heat,” Dean said. “I can just stay outside the stall, too. You’d still be able to smell me there.”
Ever since Hell, Dean has tried. He tried for months with random hookups, women and men, until he realized it wasn’t getting any better. He tried for a year with Lisa, but it was still the same. Then more time went on, and he realized he was head-over-heels, madly in love with Castiel. He’d been so sure it would be different this time. That sex with someone he loved and who loved him would reignite his desire.
“I... Yeah. It’s not like I’ve never done this before. And it’s you, so... it makes sense that we do this, right?”
“Okay, so...? What made you think this?”
Dean nodded and moved his hands out of the way. Cas leaned in to kiss him, just once. Short and fairly chaste, but it made Dean smile.
“Could you maybe be in less clothes? Feels weird being the only one naked.”
“Normal? Dean, an omega not wanting to have sex
“Hell if I know! The ideal thing to do would be to bring that feathery bastard back, but we have no way to do that. I don't know what to do, but we can't just sit here with our thumbs up our asses waiting for Dean to snap. There has to be something we can do, or someone that can help.”
“So that was the end of that. I was ready to give up after that until...”
"Of course I'm gonna stick up for you two, man."
"Listen, I'm sorry, okay? It's just...you know it's been weird for me, being with Cas. I'm not really used to the idea yet, and you just...I don't know, man. It just made me feel weird. I'm sorry I yelled at you. I overreacted, okay?"
Dean had laughed, either with amusement or relief, maybe both, and had eagerly leaned in to give Cas that kiss he wanted so badly.
“You already...? When?” he sputtered.
Beth nodded. Dean continued.
“There were others, you know, here and there.”
“It’s nearly time for lunch, I’ll make myself something soon.”
Dean nodded, still drunk on Cas’s smell. It took serious effort to pull away, but knowing he was doing it to help Cas made it slightly easier.
Sam said nothing while Dean puttered around the kitchen. He set the teakettle to boil while he tossed a heat pack in the microwave, relieved Sam had indeed grabbed both and thought to leave them in the kitchen. As he was passing by to grab honey for the tea, he heard his brother subtly try to scent him. But his subtle sniff turned into several deep inhales as he leaned into Dean’s space.
“Cas... Your heat can make you ask for things you might not normally want-”
He shakes his head and tosses them into the basket along with everything else. Last night was awful, but he’s not pathetic enough yet to leave dirty pants lying around because they remind him of Cas.
“Dean?” Castiel asked, sounding so small and so tired. “Alpha, I think I’m in heat.”
Cas shook his head, still flushed red from his neck to his ears.
Without really talking, they all finished their beers, then decided it was time to leave. People gave them a wide birth as they left the bar, but the brothers and the angel didn't really care.
Cas wouldn’t have had the heart to leave. Part of him would have clung to whatever he could get, even if it made him miserable. The distance between them would have grown until they were practically strangers. Yet Castiel’s love and blind loyalty to Dean would have kept him here.
“Sam, just leave it.” Dean sounded exasperated. He had blown off some steam during the hunt, chopping heads was great therapy, and he didn't want to get back into this now.
He’s pulling the burners and elements off the stove and putting them in the sink when Sam gets up. He stumbles into the kitchen in only his boxers and an open robe, which he quickly ties shut when he sees Dean.
, he let it go. He figured Cas had a lot on his mind. If anyone was entitled to some bad days while they adjusted, it was Cas.
"Get out of the van!" Sam commanded, pulling back the safety on his weapon the show that he wasn't joking. The driver did as he was instructed, getting out and putting his hands up in surrender.
The hunter opened the door more and stepped into the room, briefly glancing around. He noticed that it was brighter now, the angel had taken down the towel. It didn't stink as much either, and Dean quickly realized that was because Cas had cleared out the bottles and take out food, plus the small window was open, letting in a light breeze. The place almost had a welcoming comfort to it now.
/“Panama! Panama-ah! Panama! Panama-ah-oh-oh-oh-oh! Panama!”/
He doesn’t look like he slept any better than Dean. There are dark circles under his eyes, his hair is messy like he’s been pulling on it, and he shuffles toward the coffee maker like a desperate man.
Sam could tell his brother was about to cry, he could hear it in his voice, see it in his face. He didn't want to, but he decided to leave Dean alone for a bit, and go talk to Bobby.
“I love you.”
“Uh, from the nipple to the scar I can feel pressure, but that’s about it.”
“Dean,” Castiel begun, unsure of what he was going to say, but hoping he would find his way as he went. “When we are intimate, you always put so much focus on me. All your energy, all your passion-”
Sam pointed behind him to where he knew Dean and Castiel were. They stood side by side, now grasping each others' hands in defiance of anyone who dared insult them. Sam never broke eye contact with Gary, even when the guy looked past him at the couple. Dean was fuming, and Cas didn't look ready to back down anytime either. Sam waited until he had the asshole's full attention back.
“May I remove your pants?” Castiel asked.
Dean started to fish around in his wallet, but Beth stopped him, holding up a hand in refusal.
Dean turned to look at Cas, his gaze immediately softening. Anger left Sam's face, replaced by worry and morbid curiosity as he looked to his brother, needing to know the answer.
"Cas..."
“Is that him?!” Dean demanded again, his voice a mixture of angry and pleading.
The healer nodded.
He watched Dean’s eyes dart away, and a blush colour his cheeks. Rather than push the issue by complimenting Dean again, Cas decided to distract him.
Dean nodded.
“What I did? What did I do to Dean?”
“I’ve never wanted an alpha to help me through a heat because I’ve never wanted to have sex. But... sometimes I would hear about how, after mating, alphas would hold and comfort the omegas. I... I didn’t think I could have that.”
And now, here Cas was, watching the man he loved in the throes of a nightmare, already twitching and shifting, his face scrunched up in what looked like pain and a cold sweat breaking out on his forehead and neck. After all the grief he'd caused him, all the worrying, all the anger and tears and hurt, all the times he hadn't gotten there in time, Castiel was back. He hadn't been able to save Dean from the horrors of Hell before they affected him permanently, he hadn't been able to help prevent Sam from releasing Lucifer and jumping in the Cage, leaving Dean alone, he hadn't been able to keep Dean out of hunting and living a relatively normal life on his own, but this, he could do something about this.
Once they were safely at a bus stop a few blocks away, Dean phoned Sam. He asked for a ride, giving his brother directions to where they were now. Sam sighed but said he was on his way.
“You knew he was at risk the second he became important to us. To you.”
“I... you didn’t have to do all this.”
That's when Sam got a good look at the man's face. Castiel. It was Castiel! He looked a little different, especially without his trademark over-coat, instead wearing a blue sweater and beige slacks, but it was him! He was alive and here! Sam didn't know if he should hug him or beat the shit out of him. Yeah, like the hunter could beat up an angel.
Dean shrugs and starts scrubbing the coiled element in his hand.
“I wouldn’t do that to the squirrels,” he answers, delighting in the mirrored smile that grows on Castiel’s face. He’d missed that smile as much as anything else, and it settled something in his chest to see it again.
Sam couldn't finish his sentence, shocked into silence by the sight before him. Tucked under the sheets were Dean and Cas, in a very intimate position. Dean was mostly on his back, his one arm flopped on his stomach, the other wrapped around Cas. The angel in question was tucked up against the hunter's side, his head on Sam's brother's chest, one arm wrapped around Dean's waist, his hand curled into a light fist, bunching the material of Dean's grey t-shirt. Dean's head rested against the angel's as he snored softly. Both were sound asleep. Sam's barely there smirk grew to a full on grin before he knew it.
Castiel’s expression softens further, and he holds his arms out, beckoning Dean into a hug. After the last few days, Dean can’t help but collapse into him. His arms wrap around Castiel’s middle tightly, and he buries his face in the former angel’s shoulder. It takes him a moment to realize he’s shaking, and when he does, he isn’t sure if it’s from relief, or residual fear.
Dean's voice went quiet and soft on that last sentence. Sam frowned before realization dawned on him.
"Look uh, back at the bar....When that guy said...what he said, and you-" Dean sighed. "Just uh, thanks. For sticking up for me and Cas like that. It means a lot."
Castiel laughed, the rumble of it harmonizing with Dean’s low snarl.
“It’s difficult to explain. I feel better when you’re near, even without alpha pheromones. Your presence comforts the omega side of me.”
Bobby paused and looked Castiel over, though he wasn't sure for what. He finally replied, his tone still cautious. After all, the last time he had seen Castiel, the angel had threatened to kill them all.
Sam held up his hands in surrender, surprise written all over his face. It was only then Dean realized he was baring his teeth, something Sam never saw directed at him. Dean scrubbed a hand over his face and took a deep breath.
“Yeah, Cas, there’s a whole lot wrong. Starting with the fact that you’re in here, and I’m in our room alone.”
Dean finally looks up at Castiel and sees tears shining in his eyes. Cas reaches gently cups Dean’s face, holding his gaze steadily.
“It is,” Castiel reassured him. “Thank you.”
Dean picked up his phone and sent a text to Charlie.
Dean sighed. He didn't want to talk about the angel, it was too painful.
"Oomph!...Cas! Come on man. Sit up."
If the circumstances had been different, if Dean hadn’t been aggressively searching for Cas the whole time, maybe something would have happened between them. Benny was good-looking, trustworthy, and he had a southern charm that Dean secretly enjoyed. But with all Dean’s heart focused on Castiel, Benny never stood a chance.
Dean realized he’d just been standing in the door, saying nothing, staring off into space vaguely near Castiel. He came to the side of the bed where he set down the plate of sandwiches and settled himself on the edge of the mattress.
Dean was still tense, waiting for Castiel’s request, and suddenly Cas knew what he wanted first.
Castiel smiles, wide and gummy, and Dean relaxes for the first time all morning.
In response, Dean shuffled in closer until he was pressed firmly against Castiel’s back. The arm Cas had moved wrapped around the former angel’s chest, pulling him closer. Dean felt Castiel relax against him, letting out a deep sigh into the pillows.
Sam steeled his nerves. Even after growing up around death and decay, sometimes something seriously gross could still trigger his gag reflex. Slowly, the Winchester opened the box the rest of the way. What he saw inside made him scream and jump back against the Impala. His shoulder hit the bumper hard, but he was numb to any pain at this point, his mind reeling.
“Cas, I missed you so much.”
Cas yawned, unconcerned by Dean’s confused tone.
Cas took another bite of his sandwich. “Is it that bad?”
“What about a faith healer?”
Sam waited until the older hunter was gone, the deep rumble of his truck clearly heard pulling down the dirt road that acted as a type of driveway, before he walked over to the TV and turned it off.
Dean walked up to the bar and sat down on a stool near Beth. She passed him the shot glass, filled to the brim with a golden liquid. Dean smelled it, but couldn't place what was in it.
Once they arrived back at the cabin, Dean went strait upstairs without so much as a glancing nod to Bobby. Sam flopped on the couch and ran his fingers through his hair.
"I'm sorry," He mumbled, looking down at the ground. "You don't feel the s-"
Power walking back to their room, Dean could smell Cas’s heat, but there was something off about it that hadn’t he hadn’t noticed before. He’d been too busy processing everything, but now he’d had a moment to calm down and prepare it was unmistakable.
“Bobby, stuff like that never stopped him. When he knew he was going to Hell, if anything he brought more girls over. But after Cas showed up, it seemed like he was more interested in being around him than hooking up.”
“Please,” Castiel answered, and that was enough for Dean.
Amelia looked like she was about to cry, but she shook her head. Castiel helped her stand, when he spoke, Sam wasn't sure who was being addressed.
“Bobby?”
Bobby leaned back into the seat, pondering all this knew information. Sam had made some good points, and now that he had mentioned a few things, Bobby realized that they were true. It was really starting to sound like the angel had been more to Dean than just a friend.
“Hey, Bobby?”
It was all just habit, really. The cabin was surrounded for miles in every direction but acres of thick pine, spruce and evergreens. Sure, the house itself might be safe from most monsters, but they couldn't be sure about the nearby forest. Some of the closer trees had sigils carved in them from other hunters who'd used the cabin before. It belonged to Rufus last, but not even Bobby was sure who'd been staying here before them.
Bobby was getting anxious waiting for Sam to call and let him know what was happening. Dean was not improving. It was like he'd had a lid on his emotions, and now that it was open, it couldn't be shut. Dean was just sinking deeper and deeper, withdrawing more and more. That was probably what concerned Bobby the most. When the eldest of the Winchester boys had problems before, he'd become violent, short tempered and sarcastic. He went out and started fights to work off some steam, things like that. He didn't sit around feeling sorry for himself.
His hands never passed the beltline, but they dragged gentle paths up and down the former angel’s back, through his hair, along his stubbled jaw. Places Dean had
Dean walked out the door and headed to the car, Sam followed a few moments later.
“Just doing a check, Sam, relax.” Dean mumbled, not meeting his brother's concerned gaze as he closed the door. “I can take care of myself.”
“Shut up!”
Dean smiled and nodded. He was at the door when Beth spoke up again.
Dean grinned. Okay, maybe he also should have told Sam to take it easy on the food. He and Cas weren’t exactly expending a lot of calories cuddling and napping. But heats were draining and uncomfortable, and if Cas wanted to spend his heat holed up in here with Dean, then snacks were perfect.
Cas barely had the juice to poof himself and the two Winchesters out of Magnus' weird, invisible, door-less mansion. The second they appeared next to the Impala, he'd collapsed against Dean with no warning. The hunter held up the unconscious angel as best he could, refusing Sam's help as he gently eased Cas into the backseat.
“Oh, really?” Sam mocked, still not quite sure he believe either of the other two men. “What's it mean then?”
Dean took the shot. He wasn't sure what to say, he didn't even know if he should tell Beth anything. He wasn't the type of guy to vent, especially not to strangers, but he got the feeling he could trust her and that she would listen.
The driver of the van locked up his own brakes, skidding to a halt less that ten yards from the hunter.
Dean just shrugged, moving around the kitchen and grabbing what he would need to make a couple of peanut butter and jam sandwiches. Cas would need sugar, protein, and carbs.
Eventually they fell silent, both just staring up at the beautiful night sky illuminated by a full moon. Dean smiled at the ex-angel on his right. Reaching over, the hunter wrapped his arm around him and squeezed in a one armed hug. He felt Cas lean into it, and he let his arm rest on the guy's shoulder after, both content to watch the stars with each other in comfortable silence.
Castiel seemed to be able to focus for a second, his eyes meeting Dean's in a moment of clarity before he swayed again and fell against the hunter.
“I’ll be fine,” Cas said, though he sounded like he wasn’t sure about that.
“Do you think Sam would notice if we put the leftover pancakes outside for the squirrels?”
Sam wasn't sure how to respond to Emanuel's directness, even though it was a typical Castiel thing. He was left sputtering for an answer.
“I said okay. You're right. So what? There is nothing that you can say that will make him being gone or what he did hurt less, so what do you want to do? Ask me how I ended up with a dude? Sit here and tell me how sorry you feel for me? Tell me it gets better?”
So they went about their lives. Until Cas got used to the basics of being human, he’d elected to stay behind on hunts. Dean, secretly, was relieved. Angel Castiel was a badass who could take care of himself. Human Cas was still learning the limits of his body and regularly burnt his tongue on coffee or tripped over his own feet. He needed to relearn how to fight without his powers and get comfortable with a gun before he’d be any good on a hunt.
“They showed up this morning.”
to touch for years, finally under his fingertips.
Sam didn't recognize the name, but his still paid attention to every word.
“I realize this is a conversation for tomorrow, but for tonight I only have one question.”
“What are you doing?”
Definitely people, monsters would know who he was and call him by his name. Amazing how your relation to someone changes what's important.
Dean could feel tears threatening at the corners of his eyes, but refused to cry. Beth poured him another shot which he downed quickly. The blond bartender wanted to help, but she wasn't sure how.
Castiel nods, hugging Dean tighter.
“I like it, Cas,” Dean says, ignoring the burning in his cheeks. Somehow, this feels more intimate, more vulnerable, than any time they’ve had sex. “I wanted to do it, okay?”
When he'd seen the hunter again for the first time him months, curled up under his old trench coat, he'd wanted to run to him, to wrap him up in his arms and wings and never let go. He watched the hunter frown in his sleep, curling in on himself a little as his stomach began to hurt and clench, preparing to try and expel what little food was in it, floating around in copious amounts of whiskey, beer, and brandy. Without thinking about it, Castiel reached out and gently ran his fingers over the hunter's forehead, trailing them down his cheek in a gesture Dean would have called sappy. As the angel ran his fingers down the hunter's face, he pushed a small amount of his grace down his arm and through his hand, concentrating on letting it seep into the hunter's body. It curled around his stomach, ridding it of what alcohol was still in it. He then directed it to Dean's overworked liver, clearing it of the booze it was trying to digest. Finally, as he pulled his grace back out, he trailed it over the hunter's temples, stopping his headache before it could even start.
“Just hold me.”
“Charlie!” Dean sputtered. He heard her laughing over the phone. “God, I did
“It wasn't the hunt Bobby, Dean's just...can I talk to you outside for a second?”
“It’s about both of us,” Dean says quickly. “This hurt you too.”
“Dean-” Sam said, but Dean was already taking off, following the scent trail. Tears burned his eyes, but he blinked them away angrily. Is this what Cas did when he was gone? Invite over omegas to fuck silly until his stupid boyfriend came home? God, how long had this been going on? Was this why Cas had never tried to join Dean and Sam on a hunt? Because he had weekends of fun planned for when they went away? Dean felt like the biggest idiot in the world. The one time he comes home without telling Cas to surprise him, and this is what he comes home to?
Cas wanted to tell Dean all this, to praise him and call him beautiful, but he knew that would be too much just yet. Later, maybe Dean could accept how Castiel saw him. But for now, he would have to settle for showing Dean.
Dean smiled at the still laughing Castiel.
Sam finally gave up and dumbly gestured to the bodies on the floor. Cas looked to the two dead humans on the floor, and the hunter watched as the angel's eyes followed a streak of blood that lead around the back of the counter. Quite clearly a drag line. His eyes widened marginally, anyone other than one of the brother's wouldn't have seen it. Cas seemed to get over the third death quickly, turning back instead to the hunter.
“Castiel.” the shifter added, as if proving how much he knew about Dean and his life outside of hunting. He almost said it with pride.
“Hey, hey,” Dean said gently. “It’s okay. You don’t have to be sorry.”
“He isn't...ah... He wasn't well enough to make the trip. I was kinda hoping you would come to him. It's a bit of a drive, but he really needs your help.”
Dean snorts. Was he meant to keep track? They’ve forgiven and moved on since then, but in all the years they’ve known each other, they’ve fucked each other over with secrets and lies plenty.
“What do you mean?” Castiel asks. He’s still speaking low, but Dean can hear the edge of fear there.
“Cas, no, that’s not what- It’s not your responsibility to...” Dean sighs. “I’m a big boy, alright? I can handle a few bad dreams.”
Cas stood up. For a few long moments neither of them were quite sure what to do, they both just stood there and stared awkwardly at each other. Castiel wanted to say something, but he wasn't sure what. He also didn't know what conclusion Dean had come to while he was gone, and he didn't want to make things worse than they already were. If Dean had decided that he never wanted to see Castiel again, the angel didn't want to make it harder for him by telling how much he loved him. Likewise, he did not want to jump the conclusion that Dean had decided to call time of death on their relationship, and say something that might make the hunter feel unwanted or rejected.
Sam wanted desperately to help as he watched Dean beat Cas around the room, the angel telling him all the while to fight the mark, to take back control.
“Yeah Sammy, come on in.”
“Nothing, Cas. I’m fine.
Sam and Bobby came back in a few minutes later. Bobby said something about going on a supply run to the nearest town, before grabbing his keys and heading out. He'd been half expecting Dean to make a request for more booze or pie, and when none came, he frowned, but said nothing as he left.
"I'm sorry." He mumble, staring at the ground.
"I had fun." The ex-angel said, making his way beside the hunter as they walked back to the Impala.
Sam’s jaw dropped before he could stop it.
caught Sam’s attention. He set down his cards; the game forgotten as he frowned at Dean.
Ouch. That he’s right hurts even more. Dean doesn’t have the chance to respond before Castiel gathers up the clean sheets and heads for the door.
Once they reached Dean's room, the hunter helped Cas lay down on the bed, shifting him until he was more or less comfortable. Before Cas could stop him, Dean undid the laces on his dress shoes, and slipped them off.
"And I'm not the one who smelt like a toilet after jumping into a river." Sam retorted.
Cas wishing he knew the right words to soothe Dean’s anxiety. It wasn’t the first time Dean’s insecurities had come up, and each time Castiel felt like he was flailing as he tried to find the right thing to say. But he knew he had to try something. “I have no expectations here. All I want is to make you feel good, and if this is a way I can do that, then I want to try. If it doesn’t work, that’s okay too. We can do something else, or stop entirely. But no matter what happens, I will not be disappointed. Alright?”
