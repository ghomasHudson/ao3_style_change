"Sam got a note from when he was in that alternate universe. He told Balthazar what the note said and he relayed everything to me." Cas said.
"If the half-Angel translates for the Stupid one's Widow's dog, I conjured a creature so destructive it would have destroyed Nowhere if Muriel did not sound." Shirley said.
"Mmm, peanut butter banana cream piecake vs Red velvet. I am TORN." Dean said as he took another bite of the remaining narrowed down two.
"He brought us back from Heaven and the Empty and he reunited us with help from Amara." Adam said. "We're not addressing whose body he's using as a vessel, but we're making it work." They both blushed and Dean and Sam just gulped as the two began to make out.
"The look. It's no coincidence he got that look. The pie is a bit of an aphrodisiac. Cinnamon sugar crust with a dusting of powdered sugar, plus cherries themselves are an aphrodisiac. The point is, your uncle just white peed his pants at the first bite. Plus he imagined himself in a field of giant cherries. That's what always happens, it's that good a pie." Emma explained. "We had a patron come in a few times, she studies Mayan culture and sometimes sacrifices insects and rats to the Mayan God of corn, Cacao. She says that pie is better than sex and sacrificing to Cacao combined." Emma said. Claire laughed. Once Cas cleaned up, he finished his pie and drank his coffee like someone chugging chocolate milk. Dean patted him on the back when the older man started choking on said coffee.
"The remains of a stuffed animal my mother made me before she died when I was 4. His name was Impi. Short for Impala, because the black horse this used to be looked like the first horse I rode, who was as spry as an African Impala." Dean explained. "The first time I met the Queen, she shredded him. This is all that's left." Dean snuggled it. Cas growled.
"Chuck fried him, Amara gave Jack a new body untouched by Demons and let Belphegor keep the old body." Cas explained.
"Comes to you on it's own? A likely story." Michael said with great exasperation. "Go train your Garrison, Castiel. And leave my stuff alone." Castiel fell defeated and went to do as he was told. Gabriel came in shortly after.
"No, no. I understand. I gotta move on. Dean needs to too, even if he is a Knight of Hell now. We both know that." Sam nodded and went to working on research.
The house was amazing. Everything Dean had wanted, a back yard for Miracle and Cas loved the peanut grinder and apiary Dean had set up for him. Especially with the tap so as not to disturb the bees.
When Cas woke, he and Dean were in the same position as before, but Dean was humming "Blackbird" to him, not off-key like he had described before. Cas smiled and kissed Dean's chest.
"I'm sure they'll let me visit on occasion, Sammy. In the meantime, you've seen me take care of Adam. You can take care of him just as well." Dean said as he kissed Sammy's forehead. "Alphas take as much care of their children as Omegas. Follow Father's example. I did when we were living on next to nothing."
"HAVE A NICE NIGHT!" Emma called as he drove away and Jacob gave her the "Okay" sign as he drove off. "So, Cas has never seen Fear? You should get on that." Emma said as she got in the back seat. "The poor thing's as pop culture starved as Jack's occasionally nougat starved."
"Nonsense, I'm happy to help." Dean said. "Besides, life's kinda quiet lately since I retired from hunting."
"Take him back topside, I got what I needed." Dean said as they went to take Metatron back to where he was taken by Dean and Crowley. Then he went to the address for where Metatron was storing Cas's grace.

"I see you met Dean, he's an eager Omega, don't you think?" Charles asked. Castiel nibbled his lower lip and sighed. Dean was someone he hoped he could get to know better during this visit. In the meantime, he heard footsteps coming from behind him and he turned to pick up his younger brother, Samandriel.
A few weeks would go by when Dean would be used to being treated like an untouchable in the East Indies. He was cleaning, doing laundry, not fed very well though. However, they trusted him enough to allow him one thing he loved to do for his family: He was allowed to cook.
"Apparently, you met in season 4, which was the year I came back from Hell. You fell in love with her on set and married February 2010, 2 years after you met. Jensen married Danneel three months later in May. Right after you went to Hell with Lucifer."
"No need, I got your fledgling right here." Rowena said. "Newbie named Dale. Now he's new to being a Demon."
Once they had met with Amara, she heard pounding from the Empty. “The Empty should be sleeping. Funny, who’s keeping them awake?” Amara asked.
"I'm not allowed to eat what I cook despite my being the chef. Can't even test taste it or I'm a thief, and I'm gonna be sent off to marry Prince Azazel." Dean sighed. "Otherwise, I'm given lobsters."
"I'd say so." Dean agreed. Jack playfully shook his head and continued on eating his cake slice. Cas also ate a slice and smiled. Amara giving him the gift of taste as an Angel has always been the best thing. But then he remembered he wanted to give something to Dean.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Yessir, I'll ask Samandriel for help." Lucifer said as he walked over to collect the family. Right then, Dean and Cas made it to the throne room.
“Shut up, I didn’t complain when you used to kiss Eileen.” Dean said as he went back to kissing Cas.
"No, not really. Sam and I, we just discovered we have some family in a town called Nowhere. Sam's looking that place up right now." Dean explained. "How's Godwork?"
"Meg, Crowley, me obviously, a few of us that actually liked you. The other demons are actually either in the Empty or being reeducated in Hell." Ruby said.
"I made a kidney pie with the kidneys of the lamb, and then I took the brain of the lamb and added it to the pie." Dean said. "I am a believer of using every edible part of the body." Dean walked away. Castiel dug in and he thoroughly enjoyed it. Lucifer, though hesitant, was pleased with his pie and so was Samandriel and Anna. Queen Naomi and King Charles, though disgusted that Dean had used lamb brain, didn't bring it up.
Dean pushed Cas onto his bed once the door was locked. Then he went to cut a couple pats of butter and covered Cas's dick with it, making the older man gasp. "Butter?" Cas asked.
"There was no rational thought when my fiancee's toy was shredded by your wife, Father." Castiel scolded.
“Yeah, when you die in one form, you tend to come back in that form afterwards. Like Nick before I possessed Vince Vincente and later Castiel. Sorry about your loss, by the way. But I think I have an idea. Our Aunt Amara has a bit of history with the Empty, yeah? They may be able to make a deal with her if I offer myself.” Lucifer said. Jack was surprised.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I certainly can do that." The jeweler said exasperatedly. "I guess I won't need to worry about paying for the materials."
"I heard about you in the papers, the Amazon daughter of a Winchester." Jacob said as his claws elongated further, his fangs coming in. "So Jack resurrected you too?"
Dean got a knock on the door. "Jensen, get ready. We're about to shoot a scene for this new episode." The set director called as Dean jolted from his couch, waking Misha.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"You and Father stopped being my family long ago when you killed Mary of Campbell. And all because Father felt cheated when she ran away and later married Lord John." She opened the door. "If you please, Prince Thomas."
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I want to believe you, but you're a demon." Cas said. Dean sunk, but he soon had to leave. Cas sighed as Dean disappeared just before Hannah knocked on the door.
"He snuck into my room while we were talking. He told me how much he's loved me. We made love and when I woke up after napping post-coital, he was humming "Blackbird" by the Beatles to me." Cas said. "He explained that Mary used to sing Beatles songs to him when he got sick." He smiled.
"Thanks. It's actually my recipe for the filling. Dad makes the puff pastry for it and I fill it after also including a mushroom pate to make it earthier. Like a beef wellington with chicken and spinach as the replacement. And mushroom is rather fleshy in and of itself, so yeah." Emma said.
"He won't mind. We kinda need the time apart right now anyway. C'mon, we can get a job together and rent out a space. It'll be fun." Dean said.
"Not now, Mother." Crowley said. "How do we close this thing?" Suddenly though, the rift sucked Dean in, then immediately closed.
"Thanks, sweetie. Could you check on the turnovers? See if they've overcooked?" Dean asked. She nodded and checked them out.
"I'm sure you are." Sam said. "The worst part is when we were together, I was starting to fall in love with you."
"You're back." Sam said. "Dean, I know you said you don't want to become Human again, but-" Dean cut Sam off.
"I see, and that's where you think you can get it?" Crowley asked. "And you plan to get it back for your loverboy?" Crowley provoked. He couldn't help but do so, it was ridiculous. Dean damn near pulled out the first blade and pointed it at Crowley's chin.
"I have no interest in taking your position by killing you, Crowley. So if I were you? I'd shut my cakehole before mistakes are made." Dean said and Crowley snapped his mouth shut. Dean gave a light smile and found where Metatron was supposedly hiding.
"Servants don't deserve comforts like us." Queen Naomi guffawed, Charles lightly smiling. This didn't sit well with the crowned Prince. Nor did it Lucifer for that matter.
"Same. Ash and I have a LOT in common and also, my eyesight's back. So all in all? Life's good again." Pamela said.
"The last wish made from the first tree was from Eustace. He wished Muriel would have a bigger head to see sense that the tree was not good for them. It was really out of jealousy." Courage said.
"He only presented three days ago. I didn't want to sell him off, but after losing everything when our farmland was attacked years ago and my beloved Mary had died in the attack, Dean took over taking care of his little brother who recently presented early as Alpha. My youngest son, Adam. He needs to eat. His mother had died in childbirth a couple years ago. He's two now." the King nodded sympathetically. "As soon as Dean presented Omega, I bought him a special toy to help him through it. Other than that, he's still untouched by human appendages." Lord John said as he went to check on his oldest son.
"Part of why I started the bakery with Dad." Emma said. Dean smiled, beaming with pride at his little girl.
"And ACTION!" The director called out once Misha and Dean's make-up were touched up on. The scene was a fight between Cas and Dean. Dean was able to tell Cas truths he'd never even been able to tell John or Sam. Misha's eyes widened. "CUT!" The director said. "Jensen, you were great. But that's not in the script."
"Michael and I had become attached to each other over the thousand years we were in Hell." Adam said. "Lucifer was torturing Sam's soul quite a lot. Though Michael had partaken in it." Adam bowed his head down slowly.
An army of horses led by a family came up at Thunderlief early the next morning. Dean and Castiel walked over to the family in trepidation. Dean stoically watched as Castiel approached the lead horse. The man on the big horse crawled off the horse and walked towards the future King of Shurley Castle. The standoff lasted for about five minutes as the two walked around each other, and then a bunch of yowls and woohoos as the two began to hug tightly. Cas and the man then turned to Dean and the two of them walked over to him. It was then that the visitor took off his mask to reveal an exact replica of Castiel.
"Me too." Michael said. The waitress obliged the four of them and went to give the orders. The four then proceeded to talk amongst themselves.
"Too bad it was just a dream. I don't think you were carrying enough money to buy protection." Dean said.
"Have you forgotten I'm here?" Metatron asked. Dean took the blunt end of the first blade and smacked Metatron.
"Yes. I bumped into Dean and Sam Winchester while I was having some fun at a university. And I had recently put Sam in a time loop where Dean keeps dying. He was going to Hell because of the grand design." Gabriel said.
"Oh?" Cas asked. Dean told him everything. Cas held his hand as he listened to Dean tell Cas how Jacob had heard of Mary's spirit's sacrifice from Eve's temporary revival. Dean began to cry and Cas held him close as the younger man tucked his face into the crook of Cas's neck.
"Of course. Now, if you excuse me, I've earworms and...Jefferson Starships..." She dramatized at Dean, who blushed at the name he gave that last batch of monsters she made before he ganked her. "Have a good rest of your day." She said as she walked away.
“NO!” Dean roared out as he ran to Cas. “Don’t do this, not without me. You changed me just as much as I did you, Cas. I need you. I want nothing more than to be with you. You leave me, I have NOTHING, Cas.” Dean touched his forehead as tears streamed harder down his face. “I love you.” Dean then kissed Cas deeply, Cas struggling to push Dean away, but Dean was too strong as he held onto his trenchcoat, the Empty coating the both of them in its goo as both men were sucked into the Empty together, Dean never letting go. As they disappeared in tar-like ooze, the only sound in the dungeon was Sam calling Dean’s phone.
18 months later, back in the world where the boys' lives are a TV show, Jensen and Misha were making discoveries of their own.
"I thought it'd work for the sandwiches I'm making. I also made brioche rolls to put the sausage on and I'm making over easy eggs to go on top of the cheese." Emma said. Dean and Miracle's mouths both cartoonishly watered. Suddenly, Cas came in.
"It's a time portal, much different from alternate world portals. Interesting, I haven't seen one of these since the night your father left me. I tried to figure out what I did wrong. Turns out, the man was just a pig. I'm so sorry, Fergus." Rowena said.
"Ah, the royal Servant. I wish to thank you for clearing me for the thefts. Two hundred millennia and I feel free to be rectified of crimes I did not commit. I award you my extensive baking recipes." The baker offered as he went off into the world.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
He was immediately taken to the scullery the second he was inside the castle. He quickly unpacked his stuff onto his bed and underneath it and didn't give himself time to settle. He started his work immediately by scrubbing the floors. Halfway through, he mud was tracked through the already shined up floors.
"Been there, but I've gotten used to it since I got those feelings back. Tasting is the best part." Cas said. "Peanut butter's my favorite."
"And Cut!" The director said and Dean knew exactly what to do then. "Excellent work, boys. That's lunch. Go over.
"Why yes. I use vinegar in all of my recipes. My great-aunt Gertrude recommended the idea to me when we were contacting Eustace's dead brother Horst from beyond the grave. I wanted Eustace to resolve his issues with Horst." Muriel said. "Oh well, just no fixing that man's stubborn behavior."
"Hey, babe?" Dean called out to Cas as he was cleaning the attic. "Ash Harvelle just reached out to me. I'm gonna go help rebuild his and his family's roadhouse." Dean finished.
"A couple hours ago, Miracle sniffed out this adorable, delicate furball while I was walking him. Miracle licked her and lied down, as if he was keeping her warm. I told him to leave her alone because I was allergic. But I want to adopt her because you said once you always wanted a cat. Castiel, meet Celestial." Dean said as he handed the little kitten to his now fiancee. Cas happy cried as he held the beautiful little kitten in his arms and looked up at Dean.
"Sam told me. But Michael fought to keep me safe." Adam said. "Michael overpowered Lucifer quite a few times. His strength, his true form, it was all beautiful. No one had ever fought for my life."
"Thomas!" She gasped and grabbed her sword. "Get out or I will stab you." She growled as she pointed it at her brother.
"As did Lilith's personal chef. Believe me, I didn't want to drain her meatsuit. She was pregnant. But I had to follow orders. Get you to drain all the demons associated with Lilith and get your powers to full battery life so you could kill Lilith." Ruby said.
"You're gorgeous, Castiel. The first time you came to me in that barn? There was something powerfully beautiful as you entered, intimidating and badass. And the way you introduced yourself to me, your words to describe how you pulled me out of Hell. I felt in awe. But then I had to ruin it by stabbing you." Dean said as he stretched Cas out. "I regret always being angry when you do stuff you shouldn't. The reason I do though is because I view you as this perfect being that can do no wrong. Sure you've lied to me in the past, but it doesn't stop me from feeling all of that." He put his unused hand on Cas's right cheek and started stroking it. "I love you. I love you so much, Cas." Dean then began to kiss Cas again and held him close to his chest.
"Means a lot coming from you, Sunshine." Dean said. "Mom used to hum Beatles songs to me whenever I got sick. She wanted me to know more than Led Zepplin. So she'd teach me Beatles songs. "Hey Jude" is a song that she would sing the most." Dean explained as he kissed Cas's hand.
“Sure. Hey, I was able to save a dog for Deano, heard ol’ Cassie went into the Empty. Or if Dean went in with him, Jack needs a pet.” Lucifer said. “Really is a miracle. Just found her outside a gas station. It's a girl, I checked. Keeping her safe from Dad, but I’ll be sure to ask Aunt Amara when I see her IF he finds us and snuffs the pupper out, to let me take away his grace.”
"Please, call me Cas." Cas purred, throwing back what Dean had said to him when Dean was blowing Cas.
"Yeah, I'm-I'm just so glad you're here." Dean said as he hugged Misha tighter than he'd ever even hugged Cas. But then the moment was ruined when Sam started berating Misha and then Dean had to cover Sam's mouth. "Sorry, we're rehearsing and he got too into it." Dean said.
"And this is Michael's area. He's just about done with his rut." Lucifer explained. "Meg, I didn't know you were taking on rutcare. Dean, Meg of Azazel. Meg, this is Dean of Winchester." Lucifer introduced.
"She's a tough girl, my Joanna. Prince Castiel promises to make her a Knight when he becomes King." Ellen said as she gave Dean some porridge. "Here, love. Have some porridge. It'll give you back some energy." Ellen offered. Dean took the bowl and started eating it slowly, but then started happy crying at how good it tastes. Kali started comforting Dean.
"You left me with a succubus." Sam whispered in case Gen was still hearing. Dean just slightly giggled and he got a text from Misha.
Gabriel had kept tabs. His screwing with Dean and Sam? He'd known someone had put Lucifer's sword into Sam. It was probably that prick Zachariah. Always doing Michael's bidding. Also, anything to jump start Sunday Dinner. He knew the moment he had met Dean and Sam during the case of the psychology professor who fell from his office. He knew he had found Castiel's bondmate. Soulful green eyes the same shade, the same hue of green as Michael's sword. Gentle giantlike and ever the fighter. His soul was even unique. So he sent a heads up to Castiel.
"Hello, Dean. Castiel. Did you like that I turned Mary's spirit's destruction story into a legend for Monsters about a mother's love?" Eve asked. "Because word down in Purgatory says you forgot about the poltergeist." Dean lowered his head. "But that's not why I'm here. I wanna congratulate you."
"If you didn't, I wouldn't have met Michael. Speaking of, we should probably bring you back to your place." Adam said as he and Michael took Dean and Cas back to the house, then parted ways for the night.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Always, baby." Cas answered back by leaning back into bed to stroke Dean's cheek and kiss him. "So lucky to have you." Cas said.
"Cas, I promise it's me." Dean said. "You want me to prove it's me?" He started to think about how he could prove to Cas he was real and he was alive, just on the opposite side of him. "The tape. The mixtape I made you. My top 13 favorite Led Zepplin songs. You have that tape, right?" Dean asked. Cas nodded.
"I think I've finished my whole pie. And now, I'm gonna go thank the chef for a gorgeous meal." Cas said as he got up from his spot at the table when he bumped into Dean. "Oh, sorry." Cas said as Dean dropped the cutlery collection tub.
"I'm your new God." Cas said. "I'm not gonna ask you or Dean or Bobby to bow down to me. You are my friends, I will bow to you." Cas said as he then knelt down and bowed to Sam, Dean and Bobby walking to where Cas was kneeling. "You're my friends, my family. And Dean, my love." Dean smiled with a happy tear and pulled Cas up to him as they kissed once more, bewildering Sam.
“Not at all. I know an expert jeweler in town, he was able to get the materials together for the occasion.” Both men began to cry. “Will you marry me, Castiel?” Dean asked.
“I missed cuddling with you this morning.” Dean said. “I bought you more pectin for your next batch of Blackberry jam you like to make so much.”
Sam hurriedly searched through his jacket pockets, pulling out the little folded square of delicate paper and rushing over to Rowena to hand it over. Rowena took the paper with careful hands, long nails unfolding the old paper before taking in the written spell.
Before Castiel could say anything in response to this revelation, Jimmy was patting him on the back with a sympathetic smile. “Look, I know this is all… a
Sam miraculously managed to crouch down next to his brother without his legs giving away, placing his hand atop his brother’s back. “Yeah… yeah, we can uh… I'll go and see what we have to wrap him up in. Maybe… maybe the sheets from his bed? Or we could-"
He was always kind of awkward with stuff like that, but with Dean… they somehow managed to talk to each other entirely with looks.
The only time Sam had ever really gone on hunts without him by his side was during that whole ‘soulless Sammy’ fiasco, and
Above her, the light on the ceiling flickers. One single flicker, a split second where the bulb dims before returning to its full brightness. Eileen pulls herself out of bed with a tired sigh and a grumble of: “Damn old bunker…” The bulb flickers again, and again, and Eileen reaches up on her tiptoes to tap at the old glass bulb. The flickering stops the second her fingers come into contact with it, and she remains there for a few moments, waiting to see if it would flicker once more.
For a while, it's nothing but silence. Neither of them have moved all that much, Dean still stood in the doorway to the room, eyes boring deep into Castiels own, both unable to tear there gaze away, unsure where to go from here.
get them back to the portal in time. It took him damn near an entire year to find Cas the last time. 29 minutes just wasn’t enough, and it wasn’t
“I…” Dean began. “I’m not important. I didn’t care if I was athletic. If I did well enough to be considered ‘smart’. The
Dean had been expecting for Sam to sit back down after his speech, or perhaps even walk over to wrap them both up in hugs. To his surprise, Sam remained standing, shooting him much too of a mischievous grin for Dean’s liking.
Eileen? He so wants to give in to the hope that something good has happened for once, to just take the lucky break he’s been given in the middle of this nightmare… but that just doesn’t happen for him. For
true – but that I was given a bill of clean health and the all-clear to return to work, so… he asked if I still wanted it, and I took it.”
“I thought God knew everything...” Dean mumbled discreetly under his breath as if the powerful being stood next to him wouldn't be able to pick up even the quietest of whispers.
Eileen was the first to jump to her feet, having shifted into a ball of nerves as they awaited Sergei’s arrival. Sam stood from his chair beside her, easing her nerves ever slightly with a comforting but knowing touch to her shoulder.
“Sorry for ruining your plans,” Dean delivers the line as deadpan as he possibly can. It gets a weird mix of a sigh and dry chuckle from Cas, so he guesses it’s
call it whatever. It didn’t matter if they personally knew the demon in question (which was something he never thought he’d say in his life), there was still something so…
Eileen couldn’t help but laugh awkwardly at that. Or was it more of a nervous laughter? She couldn’t quite tell… “I know that we don’t
“Right… well, um… you should probably come in…” Jody says, glancing back to the front door. “I’m guessing you’re not just here to catch up?”
still in the ocean. He was, in fact, right on Dean’s heels alongside the wave he had sent his way. Dean only had around five seconds to absorb this fact before Castiel was wrapping him up in a tackle impressive enough to be signed by an NFL team, sending the two of them careening into the sand. Dean grunted roughly upon impact, the air crushed out of him as a result of the five feet, nine inches tall
Jack releases the twig from between his fingers, finally lifting his gaze back up to meet Castiel’s. “The Empty is… not happy. I
“You know what? I’m beat,” Sam announced to what felt like an empty room, might as well been… And considering the fact that Dean knows full well that getting an angel cleansing feels like an energy boost that no coffee, energy drinks, or vitamins will ever achieve, he knows that his little brother is full of shit right now.
Dean spluttered, straightening up from his slanted position. “Cas, what the hell are you talking about?”
"Cas... This isn't you. This isn't you." Dean's voice is broken, the intense pain beginning to overtake him. Castiel strikes again, face showing no sign of what he was doing.
Dean isn't too sure who exactly moved first, but it doesn't seem like it mattered. The next song is playing on the radio, but he can't really bring himself to care, not when he can feel the warm and soft pressure of Castiels lips against his own.
“I hope it doesn’t make you see me any different,” Castiel admitted, eyes trained on the bottle in his hands.
“Oh, it’ll be one to tell the grandkids, that’s for sure,” Dean joked. To Dean’s delight, Castiel at least seemed to find him funny, shaking his head as he laughed. “It actually all started because me and Sam ordered the same thing.”
“Apparently…” Sam sighed, glancing around the bunker’s interior, a concerned frown etched on his features. “Huh, usually she’s-,”
Dean had practically disappeared to his bedroom shortly after the red-haired witch had left. Not that she can blame him. She knew how much both her and Sam liked to tease Dean about his whole thing with Cas and – truth be told – she’s not
Dean Winchester was a lot of things, but a liar wasn’t one of them. And he’d be lying if he said he was jumping at the chance to go on a date with this guy. The feeling he was getting off the guy, it just wasn’t the connection he had been expecting. It certainly wasn’t anything near the spark he had felt talking to him face to face earlier that day. If anything, the vibe he got from Cas was more of the annoying friend that you can't help but find kind of funny. At the end of the day, Cas made him laugh, over message even.
Dean couldn’t only weakly shake his head side to side, not trusting his voice to keep steady right now. He followed the doctor’s movement as he straightened back up, taking a step forward and placing a hand over Dean’s lower leg, giving his calf a gentle squeeze. “How about this?”
“Dean, there’s a reason everyone’s been hounding at me to go to this place. I trust my friend’s coffee opinions.”
It was Castiel, sat by himself on a vinyl wooden table for two. He was dressed up in a pale blue button-down shirt and dark dress pants, maybe too fancy for a casual burger place, but it suited him. Even from here, Dean could see how nervous the poor guy was; hunched over the table and playing with the bottle of beer in front of him, picking absentmindedly at the label as he looked around the restaurant. Every now and then Castiel’s head would swivel towards the entrance to the restaurant, no doubt waiting for Dean’s arrival that, if it hadn’t been for Gabriel's suggestion, would never have happened.
“Never liked getting blood tests taken…” Claire mumbled, rolling her eyes at the brightly colored care-bears band-aid that Kaia stuck over her arm.
“Maybe one day you’ll solve the last problem,” Eileen suggested. “Well, the last ‘loved one at risk of death or worse’ kind of problem.”
“I did want to tell you first, but Dean decided he wanted to be an asshole about it,” Sam offers, giving Jody an awkward wave. “Oh, and… this is Eileen.’
“Yeah, well… That wasn’t gonna stop Dad,” Dean replied dryly. “We didn’t have any relatives. No grandparents, no uncles or aunts, nothin’. But Dad did have one friend from back in the marines. Uncle Bobby.”
Dean stared down at his legs lying motionless on the hospital bed, certain he had never concentrated on a part of his body so hard in order to get it to move. But… no matter how hard he tries to get his legs to move… they don’t. Nothing happens, not even a twitch of his muscles. They just… lay there.
“Memory Foam.” Dean answered proudly. “I got the only one in the bunker. I didn’t think the quality of a mattress bothered you anymore with your grace back?”
“Even in your last moments… you were looking out for me,” Dean smiles weakly at Cas. “Guess mom was right, huh? I did have an angel watching over me.”
“I’m still not completely up to date with human etiquette, but I’m fairly certain that most couples do not wish to scar their significant others?”
“So, what about you?” Eileen asked Dean, crossing her arms and leaning against them atop the table. “Get anywhere with the research?”
“Oh…” Dean squeaked out, the remaining few bites of pancake left on his plate no longer looking as appetizing as they did a few seconds ago.
thought it was funny,” Cas drops into the bed next to him, turning his head to face Dean and gifting him with one of those gummy smiles he so rarely sees from Cas. “And I got most of my sense of humor from
that Dean would have a few choice words for him over the phone. Texting those words just doesn’t have the same seething tone his voice can convey, so he instead decided to respond with ‘Cool, here if you need help. Let me know when you two are headed home,” and that was that.
“Cas said he agrees with you…” Dean mumbled dejectedly, passing on Cas’s message.  Sam embarrassingly signed the message to Eileen who couldn’t make out Dean’s mumbles, cracking into laughter at the two brother’s shame at being called out.
Ellen’s eyes glance over to someone behind him, and Castiel glances over his shoulder to see Jimmy approaching the bar from his table. Although, instead of sitting down on an empty stool, he stands next to Castiel, placing a hand on his shoulder. “Sorry to interrupt the reunion, but… it’s time.”
I bet now's about the time y'all are frantically searching for that 'Angst with a Happy Ending' tag, huh?
“Sam, he’s not breathing,” Dean got out in a panic, framing the sides of Cas's face with his hands. “Cas? Cas, can you hear me? C'mon man, I need you to
The two watched as Sam approached the service counter by the door. Sam wasn’t quite as dressed up as Castiel was; in his red and black chequered flannel shirt and a pair of blue jeans. To Dean’s delight, he most definitely
“I can still feel physical touches on my body, Dean. I may not need to sleep or eat, or the other often tedious human requirement, but I still enjoy some of them and are plenty capable.” Castiel said.
, that Dean couldn't risk it, couldn't risk the possibility of Jack losing control. So, he didn't tell Dean. Didn't tell them that he had made a deal, his own life for Jack's. Didn't tell them that while yes, Jack was back, his soul had been reduced to nothing. Didn't tell them the worrying signs he had begun to see.
“It’s fine, Sammy,” Dean snapped, holding out an arm to stop Sam from getting any closer. “Seriously. You two can watch each other’s backs, so I’m not worried there. You guys need any help, then – y’know – don’t know there’s much I can do but, guess you can call me; be whatever FBI director or whoever you need to call if the local badges start asking questions.”
residing in my body right now?” Dean interrupted Sam. “Do you really think Cas would just leave me to die?”
“Alright…” Dean clears his throat, suddenly finding it difficult to look Castiel directly in the face. “Uh… I guess, without my legs, I’d have to give up the physical part of hunting. Also pretty sure you cant be an FBI agent, or wildlife and game, or whatever else when you can't walk, so… that would rule out the whole investigating and talking to witnesses part, but uh…”
“You’re trying to push me away,” Castiel says it like a statement of fact, not a guess. “You’re trying to distance yourself, so it won’t hurt as much when I die.”
Dean’s eyes narrowed in suspicion at the hesitancy in Castiel’s voice echoing around his head, the shift in his expression garnering interest from both Sam and Eileen.
“If you had what? Burnt through all your grace and died? Again?” Dean finished his sentence for him, voice growing in irritation.
Burning. That was the first thing he noticed. The unbearable heat that surrounded them, no way of escaping from it. Everything was coated in a haze of red, and screams filled with agony echoed from every direction.
"Sammy, take a listen" Dean whispers into his phone with a growing smile, before holding his phone out slightly towards the room.
“Hmmm,’ Dean hummed in content. “Can you perhaps picture a little cozy cabin out in the woods? Maybe a yappy dog that won’t shut up and is constantly shedding all over the damn place, but you love anyway?”
“-Who’s being stubborn about his need to keep helping people,” Castiel softens the blow of Dean’s own insult at himself.
Miracle, ever loyal, trudged on after him, slipping into his room before he slammed the door. Turns out that slamming the door is more difficult when in a wheelchair, having to grab hold of the edge of the door behind him and force it backward. It didn’t quite make the echoing slam the heavy wooden doors usually do, which only pissed him off more. What’s the point of slamming a door if the person you’re mad at can’t feel it shaking through their bones?
life, Dean!” This was one of the rare times Castiel raised his voice at him, and it never failed to shut him up the second he heard it. “I accepted my end the day I took the Empty’s deal! Knowing that in my death, I was able to save
“We don’t know that. And we won’t go all the way, Cas,” Sam assured him before turning desperate eyes back to Claire. “We
right now. Coming out here, I only toyed with the idea of staying here longer. I was fully prepared to leave after a few weeks. Now… Now I’ve met you, and… and now the part of me that always screams at me to ‘
Then, Castiel decided to turn. Barely stepping to the side to glance at Dean over his shoulder, eyes landing on Dean before delivering his final verdict. “To Chuck, you are likely his greatest failure. That in itself, along with an exhausting list of reasons that would take up your entire dream to lay out in front of you, is the reason I consider you to be God’s greatest creation.”
Castiel senses the dead body off to the side, and for a moment his heart seems to stutter in his chest, thinking that it may have been Dean. To his relief, this proves not to be the case, recognizing the slowly fading magical traces of a Djinn in the room.
love with Cas may always be a huge ordeal in his mind. But deep down, he knows it’s all the little things that make up their love.
. The Empty is a powerful being. It can tear into your mind, to know all that makes you suffer. But a soul? It doesn’t know how to approach that. It doesn’t know how to make it
Dean doesn’t say anything at first. He swings the driver’s door open, stepping out and closing it gently behind him. When he gets to Baby’s trunk, the sight - or lack thereof - of no weapons is jarring. Instead, there's a cooler staring back at him. Perfect. He pulls two beers out from the cooler, holding both by the neck between his fingers as he closes the trunk with his free hand. He can still make out Cas's form sat in the back seat of the Impala as he walks back around her, hopping up on her hood and settling down.
to take in the smell of gunpowder ingrained into his skin after years of wielding firearms, of the cheap multi-pack of soap from the local grocery store and the fancy conditioner he secretly steals from Sam on occasion because he likes the way it makes his hair all soft.
“Nope, just…” Dean straightens himself from the sink, giving himself another look over in the mirror before turning to Sam. “Just trying to shake my nerves.”
Castiel glanced up from his book as something caught his eye, captivated by the flashes of light that were cast around the room. He turned his head to Dean, eyes landing on the wedding ring on his finger. He watched Dean twist the ring around his finger for some time, gently closing his book atop his thumb to keep his place when he returns to it. “Dean?”
It was easy. Just like that. One concussion, an awkward car ride, and a beer later, Dean knew Cas loved him and Cas knew Dean loved him.
too seriously tickling the childish side of him. It didn’t escape his notice that the wave was clearly shrinking in size the closer it got to Dean whenever he glanced back at it over his shoulder –
That’s not to say that Dean isn’t grateful for his brother’s update. Truth be told, he had been expecting his little brother to be so wrapped up in the case – especially with Eileen as his hunting partner – that it would have slipped his mind to keep Dean in the loop. Y’know, the usual “Hey, just passing on the message to let you know I wasn’t violently torn apart by an angry spirit.”
This bar was… nice. Homey feeling. Soft rock music floated around the room from the old jukebox tucked away in the corner of the bar, sat upon wooden paneled floors which were spotless, matching the overall wooden appearance of the building. Neon signs advertising the bar's drinks adorned the frosted glass windows which hid the world outside – though Castiel guessed there wasn’t even an outside anyway. The barstools were cushioned and comfortable looking, their red cushions somehow without a single scratch or split on them. And there, behind the beautifully carved wooden bar with a pleased smile on his face and a glass of whiskey in hand, was Dean.
"Actually, I was hoping they had leftover chicken spinach and mushroom pasties. Those are SOOOOOOO good. My friend Kaia let me try hers and that's where I heard of the Slice of Life Cafe." Claire said. "Thanks again for taking me, Uncle."
"It was Jack. He's been bringing all kinds of people back to Earth lately. Charlie Bradbury, the Harvelles, all four of them, John and Mary, Bobby, I guess he heard that the Earthly Marital union of the Angel Castiel and the Former Michael Sword, Dean Winchester is to be held and he wanted everyone you ever befriended to be in attendance. I'm Michael by the way." Michael said as he shook hands with Jess. "I feel your baby is going to do great things. He is a Winchester, afterall." Michael said.
"Steve. And this..." He began as Dean came in to pay for gas. "...is my friend Dean. We're looking for a place for a while." Cas said.
"You and Michael's sword soulbonded. It's like Michael's sword and you mated out of body." Gabriel said.
"Without breakfast with my favorite God? Never." Dean said as he pecked Cas on the lips before they got back in bed together and ate.
"30,000 pounds. As we agreed. He is still pure, Lord Winchester?" King Charles said as he looked into Dean's bedroom.
"You didn't do a lot of research about me." Misha said as Dean blushed. "I was in a movie called Karla with Laura Prepon in 2005. Three years before I worked on the show. I played Paul Bernardo, the Scarsbourough Rapist and later the hands-on half of the Ken and Barbie killers. Together they killed three women. The only vic to escape actually called me thinking she'd have some sort of cathartic epiphany if we talked on the phone. Pretty humbling experience. Also, it was Adrenaline-pumping just to play a serial rapist and murderer who would film his escapades with his wife by his side. They've since divorced and she got out some time later." Misha explained.
"Misha, what the Hell? What happened, and why are we in this section of the set all of a sudden?" Jensen asked as Misha grabbed and kissed Jensen tightly.
"So I looked up Nowhere and turns out Nowhere is here in Kansas. Not too far from Lawrence either." Sam said.
"Nuh uh. I'm not leaving you. You two have inspired me, you've inspired me to fight. I didn't start Random Acts to be a coward." Misha said.
"Dean, what would you consider to be the best meal to serve the Crown prince and one of our brothers?" Anna asked one morning when she was serving herself some rice porridge that Dean had cooked up fresh.
"I did." Sam said. They all cut into a slice and Jack and Belphegor soon came in, shocked that Belphegor kinda looked like if Jack was charred to death.
"That's it, you're gonna go see Raphael." Michael growled and took the sword away from Castiel and sent the Angel to get beat up by Raphael.
"Great. Any word on where Dean is?" Sam asked. Cas reached into his pocket and stroked his obsidian blackbird. "No, not really." Cas lied. Sam briefly detected that Cas was lying but he let it go for a second. Hannah came in with Metatron, but then Dean and Crowley came in at the same time.
"Well, I had to protect Jack. Lucifer was planning to take him away." Dean said. "Lucifer had lost his Grace after being a terrible attempt at replacing Chuck and also we were using him to keep open a portal."
"I was serving as a triple agent the whole time. I worked with Lilith and and you guys, but I reported to Crowley. Didn't know though that he was sleeping with Lilith on the side though until I had to pretend to be loyal to her." Ruby explained.
"I thought you'd like the present. Michael taught me how to make the metal used to make Angel blades and I didn't want to destroy yours just for this. Sure it would be sentimental, but what if you need to fight something fast and you couldn't find it?" Dean asked.
"I'd like a cat, but sadly, Dean's allergic." Cas said. Dean nuzzled Cas's neck and the Angel gave him a small smile in return.
"I know. Wanna get some pizza? I'll call Pizza Hut and order a Pizza Lover's, a Pepperoni Mushroom and two large traditional wings with Honey barbecue dipping sauce. Then I bought some vanilla ice cream, want a milkshake to go with all that?" Dean asked.
"I found the receipt for my ring while I was cleaning upstairs and I decided I should do something for you to celebrate our union." Cas said as he kissed Dean's nose, then took the necklace out of the case to put it back around Dean's neck. "The blue eyes represent bloodstone, which is one of the two birthstones of the guy they thought you were in that alternate world where your life was a TV show, Jensen Ackles, Sam said his name was?" Cas asked as Dean nodded in confirmation. "And then the mouth has been colored with your birthstone, Garnet." Dean chuckled and then swooned.
"So I'll have black coffee with 4 sugars, a cinnamon stick and a shake of Nutmeg and I'll try your cherry pie." Castiel ordered and Dean was more than happy to give that to him.
"So what're you guys talking about?" Dean asked. Cas startled and pulled his blanket up over himself.
"Let's not lose anymore time." Cas said as they began to shed their clothes off in the back seat of the Impala. Dean held Cas's face as they kissed and smiled when he found the zipper in Cas's slacks. He unzipped his Angel and slowly dragged his hand over Cas's dick, making the older man groan. "Dean, God." Cas purred as he threw his head back, giving Dean access to his neck. Dean growled and suckled Cas's shoulder and kissed up his neck. Dean slowly stretched Cas before entering him.
"I wouldn't really say he looks like Michael Buble, but yeah. That's him. Big dopey smile and beautiful green eyes. 6'1"." Cas said.
"It's not exactly unrewarding, you got Cas and Miracle out of it." Emma said and Dean smiled thinking about that. Just then, a honking noise came up from the front of the house.
"I saw no such thing, your dog and Miracle were doing nothing, I paid attention the whole time. And besides, they're both girls." Emma reiterated.
of those guesses right from the limited knowledge of angels he’s got from Cas, but there was no guarantee on any of the info. What if they find something that
He swung the door closed, racing around to the front of the Impala and throwing himself into the driving seat. The keys were shoved into the ignition, twisting them harshly until the Impala’s engine roared to life. Sam quickly threw the gear into drive, releasing the handbrake and slamming his foot down on the gas pedal. The Impalas wheels screeched against the dirt, throwing up rocks and other debris behind them as she lurched forward.
The cassette clicked and whirred as the tape began to spin inside the player. Dean held out the left earbud for Cas to take, waiting for Cas to pinch the small bud between his fingers before he popped the right earbud into his ear. The wire was a bit too short, meaning one jerk of the head and the earbud would probably pop out. Castiel solved the problem by scooching closer to Dean until his leg brushed up against Dean’s, the warmth from Dean’s skin tangible even through the thick layer of jeans covering him.
“You mean that’s why random credit card companies buy it for him.” Sam leaned back on the crickety wooden chair, stretching his arms behind his back until it made a satisfying ‘pop’.
"I know you can hear me, Cas." Dean's voice breaks slightly, whether from the pain or the emotion of it all, Sam doesn't know. "It's
The dam breaks. One quiet sniffle, the squeeze of his throat, the burning in his eyes. The phone keeps buzzing, a shocking loudness in the quiet of the room, only broken by his quiet sobs.
The pain of being so utterly in love with you, and knowing I could never have you in that way. Being the ‘friend’ you took to bars, having to watch you walk out with yet another partner on your arm… No matter what, I wanted to be a part of your life – but at least being an angel helped take away some of the pain of knowing you would never love me that same way.
“You plannin’ on flashing me or something?” Dean joked, gesturing to the trench coat with his hand which wasn’t occupied holding Cas’s door open. “Isn’t a little too hot to be wearing that thing, anyway?”
“Cas?” Dean breathes out his name in dumbfoundment, his fingers scrunching into the soft collar of Cas’s trench coat.
And really, it wasn’t the time to react to that, either. Coz Cas had just walked out of the room with Sammy out cold in his arms, and the spinning in his vision and the fact that he had just told Cas he loved him could only mean he was suffering from one hell of a concussion, so he filed it all away for later. Now, the only thing on his mind was ‘protect Sammy’ on a loop, so he stumbled to his feet and clumsily chased after them, nearly falling into the doorframe on his way out.
“Good luck, boys,” Rowena drawls out, the comforting touch on Dean’s shoulder slipping away. Her eyes drift over to meet Eileen’s, the smallest of a smile twitching at her lips. “
“Don’t worry about it.” Cas said to Jack, shooting him a wink. “Teasing is one of the only ways Dean knows how to show affection.”
Dean tore his eyes away from Sam’s barely contained glee, turning to Cas with eyebrows raised in anticipation. He watched as Cas began meticulously rolling up the sleeve of his left arm, pushing the shirt up further and further until Dean could see-
The Styrofoam cup of bland coffee in his hands and long since gone cold. He had only managed to force down a few sips, his nerves twisting his stomach and making the drink unbearable to choke down.
why, Dean thinks. That’s the reason he’s as angry as he is on Cas’s behalf. He’s not just angry at God, at the universe, of whatever it is that’s decided that Cas doesn’t get to live. He’s angry because all those things Cas wants to cherish in his last few hours are things Cas should have been able to experience years ago. They’re things that Cas thought he wasn’t allowed to have, things that he thought Dean would
"Was that... A memory version of Dean?" Sam asks, referring to the little boy that had run past them moments before.
Dean flipped around Cas’s hand that was still wrapped around his, silently muttering a prayer in his mind that the ring would fit as he slid it onto Castiel’s ring finger (he didn’t think there would ever be a more nerve-wracking time in his life than when he was wrapping that damn measuring tape around Castiel’s finger as he slept, just waiting for him to startle awake and either punch the strange dark figure messing with his hand at two o’clock in the morning, or have the proposal spoiled months earlier).
“Guess that makes it official,” Dean said. “Guess I can’t call you ‘husband’ just yet, but… ‘fiancée’ sounds good for the time being, right?”
“I hope you don’t mind, but I ‘took a page from your book’, so to speak. This ring, like the one you made for me, is made of a metal that once belonged to a weapon. My weapon, to be specific.”
Dean already knew his face was burning a bright red. Sam and Eileen’s questioning looks were enough evidence of that
“You can try,” Castiel replied, gazing up at the night sky. “And that’s already more than I can ask of you.”
The only thing in Dean’s mind were his own thoughts. He could barely feel Cas’s presence, the only indicator that he was still here with him being that almost undetectable hum of something otherworldly settled in every cell of his body.
“I had to hot-wire a car that had been left parked in a desolate road near a field in Illinois. In my defense, it seemed rather neglected, so I doubt it’ll be missed. It was quite difficult finding you actually, your number no longer worked and I had to visit many,
He was on his back, he realized; the cold dampness of the leaves under his back quickly soaking into his jacket. Dean pulls himself up into a sitting position with a groan, twisting his body to get a good look at his surroundings.
“G ol page, ol as dluga a el qaa ol knew ol trian ge blans; ol blans Dean Winchester’s boaluahe,”(In my dreams, I was given the one thing I knew I couldn't have; I had Dean Winchester’s love) Castiel spoke his native tongue in a whisper, something about the words being spoken in the language he knows best making him feel vulnerable under Dean’s scrutinizing gaze.
"You say that like you yourself weren't stood there with that gun ready to kill him moments before" Castiel spat, digging his fingernails into the palm of his hands as they curl into fists at his side.
love that I have for you, because now I know I get to share that love with you. I get to spend the rest of my life, however short or long it might be, with
Clearly not hearing the sarcasm in Dean's tone, Castiel nods in response to Dean's 'thanks', a slight smile on his face.
“What are you doing here, Rowena?” Sam asks her, sensing the need to defuse the situation before Jody starts shooting.
It was as Dean pulled himself out from that comfortable nothingness of sleep that he wondered whether the feeling brewing inside him upon awakening from his dream was one of relief, or of the same disappointment he saw from Cas...
“Alright…” Dean said tiredly, trying to massage away a throbbing headache he could feel building, rubbing across the pressure underneath his forehead.
“You stupid son of a-,” Castiel growls out before grabbing Dean by the collar of his shirt – who thought for a split second that Castiel was going to take a swing at him. Instead, he’s met with Cas’s lips on his own; an insisting and demanding pressure that took him by surprise. Cas’s hand shifts from his collar, resting atop the scar on his shoulder, where that spark of electricity has him gasping into Cas’s mouth. Dean’s hands find themselves grasping onto the sleeve of Cas’s trench-coat, the other resting on the side of Cas’s face; the sharp scratchiness of Castiel’s stubble against the palm of his hand being a sensation he isn’t used to - but welcomes.
“Uh… He’s mentioned you but, not that much?” Dean couldn’t help but feel bad at the way Gabriel seemed to deflate upon hearing that. “But Sammy doesn’t really talk about that kind of stuff with me. He, uh… He likes you though. It’s all in his face, I can tell.”
The corner of Cas’s lips curled up, huffing out a small laugh. “It’s not something I had to ‘hold onto’, more… it was what drove me. No matter how dark or pointless everything seemed… I had to keep trying. Not just because it's the right thing, but because… because
A look of what could only be described as “Oh” passed briefly over Castiel’s face as his eyes darted between Dean and the spot he was gesturing to. Castiel stood awkwardly from the chair, gingerly making his way across the room and lowering himself down onto Dean’s bed.
minutes, Sam could only stand shocked still where he was, watching as his brother cradles Cas in his laps, calling for him to come back.
“I can hardly believe it myself,” Dean responded, pretty much stepping into the hug that Donna initiated the second he was within arms-reach.
Sam didn’t even bother replying to the message. His feet were carrying him down the hallway in mere seconds, hurriedly shoving his phone back into his pocket as he sprinted towards the hospital's entrance. The rain had yet to let up, soaking into his jacket the second he stepped foot outside. He stared desperately into the darkness of the parking lot, pushing his drenched hair out from his face as his head whipped back and forth.
"Dean, I need you to listen to me," Castiel instructed sternly, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. "This is going to be difficult for you to hear, but you
“Then I look forward to eternity with you, Castiel Winchester,” Dean places his hand over Cas’s, intertwining their fingers and giving it a tender squeeze. “Now come on - Sammy’s gonna be pissed if I’m not there for his welcoming party.”
“He’ll be thankful to be alive,” Eileen asserted. “Everything else, all the bad that comes from this, we’ll deal with it
Dean snorts at the sass from Cas – the one trait that followed over from his few dickish years of ‘loyal solider of the lord’ Cas – letting Cas fold his hand around Dean’s finger, sliding their hands together in the small space between them. “We
“Are you sure?” Castiel asks, flicking on the indicator and switching to the right-hand lane. “I can keep driving-,”
“It was this big friggen’ rusty rebar or something, okay!” Dean threw up his hands as he answered. “One of the vamps got the upper hand on me and shoved me onto the damn thing; pipe went straight through my back and pinned me there.”
“Experiment Number two-zero-seven for the Men of Letters Archive. This experiment is led by me, Mr. Cuthbert Sinclair. And my assistant behind the camera is one of our new initiates of The Men of Letters, Mr. Henry Winchester.”
Sam shuffled towards him almost cautiously, shooting Dean a look close to denial as he placed his hand on Dean’s back. Dean inhaled shakily as the pain blossomed from the contact, barely resisting the urge to shove his little brother’s hand away. If he had the strength left to do that, that is…
Dean looked down at himself, offended at such criticisms. He could see nothing wrong with his attire: his best looking- i.e. clean and free from holes- pair of jeans, a simple black cotton tee-shirt, his dad’s worn leather jacket, and his comfortable tan hiking boots. “I’m not like you Sammy; I don’t like playing dress-up before I go on a date.”
To put it simply… the hope is palpable. They’re celebrating like they’ve already got Cas back. Like they’ve already won.
Dean froze with one arm stuck part-way in his jacket, turning to his brother with a puzzled look. “What do you mean? Why shouldn’t I be?”
The interior of the Roadhouse is bathed with warm light, and filled with people milling about the bar, chatting happily to one another with drinks in hands. Who exactly these people are, Castiel does not know, for he only has a few seconds to take everything in before-
Something in Dean’s gut twisted uncomfortably. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to know of Sam’s state, knowing full well how much his brother would be grieving after his death.
"The hell is that?" Sam asks Castiel, looking fearfully between the banging roof and the closed doors.
“Don’t sugar coat it for me,” Dean insisted, his voice coming out weaker than he intended. “We need to know the risks.”
of me. It had tortured me with it once, with what I feared and… of who I loved. And Dean, it was almost funny when I realized, when I
“Lucifer was… He didn’t agree with how our parents were raising us. He thought they were controlling, and that they weren’t letting us live the lives we deserved. Back then, I still blindly followed my parent's orders and… I couldn’t agree with him. Gabriel was always a little
“I suppose that’s true,” Cas conceded, still sipping on his first drink of the night. “If you can have free reign of the drinks you have in your sleep, does that mean you’ll reduce the amount you drink when you’re awake?”
“Which isn’t connected to his vessel,” Rowena continues off Dean’s words. “If we tried messing around with his grace… who
“That… was a surprise,” Castiel agreed. “After you kicked me out of the bunker without giving me a reason, I assumed my role in Metatron’s plan and causing the angels to fall had irreparably ruined our friendship and would be unlikely to see you again.”
thing. After all, Castiel never thought he’d see the day that Dean Winchester has a healthy sleep schedule. But he also never thought he’d see the day that Dean Winchester takes
did not have his arms outstretched to open it. It had thrown him off. He knew what wasn’t in front of him wasn’t a human, but… had it not displayed its power to them, he would never have guessed it wasn’t. He looked… normal: long tan trenchcoat billowing behind him as he advanced, shiny polished black shoes that looked well cared for, unkempt brown hair which stuck out in every direction; so dark it almost looked black, and the bluest eyes Dean thinks he’s ever seen.
Dean lowered himself down into the seat, scooching himself closer to the table until he was properly tucked in, clearing the way for the waiters and waitresses that needed to walk behind him.
“For a health nut, he sure does love stealing my beers…” Dean muttered into the cold air of the open refrigerator, bent down and peering into its fluorescent-lit interior. “Won’t eat
A thought crossed Dean’s mind, though it’s one that he had frequently thought of recently. He had been about to take another sip, the glass of whiskey raised to his lips as the thought passed over his mind. He placed the whiskey back down as he asked Castiel what was on his mind. “How are you okay with all this, Cas? I mean me, I… I’ll admit, I haven’t always treated the kid right. Even knowing what he did to… to mom, everything else, even what
Infected, dying hands pounding on the door. The only thing separating him and Cas from the end. It was almost like she was knocking for permission, asking to come in. Funny, in a way. As if Death had to be permitted to reap them. If Billy was going to go down, she was going to take them with her. She was savoring it.
“Yeah. We were en route. I waited until I… saw this,” Cas reached into his trench-coat pocket, pulling out a sad-looking excuse for a flower that looked about as beat up as the person holding it. “It… got a little smushed.”
“Okay…” Dr. Sullivan mumbled under his breath as he scribbled away at his clipboard. “Your IV drip is attached to a steady supply of morphine right now; It should help to dull some of the more intense pain, but the effects may begin to wear off after some time. If the pain gets worse, let us know and we’ll up the dose for you.”
“Got it,” The waitress said, scribbling away at the pad in her hands. “I’ll get your food out as soon as possible.”
talking,” Eileen noted as she dropped back down into her chair. “Last we heard you talking to Cas, you uh… you didn’t seem on good terms.”
“When I regained my grace once more, it was… I thought it’d be a relief, I suppose. No longer having to feel the full brunt of my emotions. But a part of me missed that human aspect. Even when all I could do was stand by your side as nothing more than a friend… it was a privilege to feel the way I did for you. Still, it did make it easier. I was able to focus more, an extra sense of logic I felt I had lost as a human driven mostly by emotions. Sometimes… I’d think about what it would like to become human again. To give up my grace and just… live my own life, as Metatron once suggested I do.
It was both relieving and frustrating when they finally made it down to the bottom of the stairs, the concrete floor under his feet never seeming quite as safe as in that moment. Sam and Eileen looked rather proud of themselves for getting him down there, and Dean knew he should be feeling that way, too. Except… he hated everything about all that just happened. The fact that he wouldn’t have been able to go down some goddamn stairs if it weren’t for two other people helping him. The fact that
Dean’s expletive is enough to snap Castiel out of his rage-filled trance. His face softens as soon as his eyes land on Dean’s awed expression, ducking his head and sinking in on himself, seeming almost… ashamed?
“Know’s what?” Jack asked inquisitively, nearly having to jog to keep up with the brother's long strides.
“You could ring a bell and that angel of yours will crawl out of any dark crevice to get to you, Dean Winchester. He’s stubbornly loyal, and a damn fool for it.”
“It’s a rare occasion…” Sam mumbles. “I made the mistake of asking him what actually happened to Cas. He told me and Jack that Cas died to save him, but that was it. I know it’s painful for Dean, but… I miss Cas too… He’s one of my oldest friends, and I don’t even know
“I had hoped that Jack might step in to intervene. I could sense his power the second I pulled myself free from the Empty. Jack is… he’s more powerful than any being that has ever existed now. The combined power of two Gods, along with his own? I just… I don’t understand why he wouldn’t help you.”
Understanding flooded through Castiel, the worry on his face quickly changing to a look Dean knew to be pity. “Dean… this isn’t a dream. Not anymore, at least.”
Dean’s panicked eyes fixated on Dr. Sullivan, giving a quick nod of his head at the doctor's question.
“If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you sound jealous,” Eileen teased him, giving his shoulder a light squeeze with a playful smile.
“I’m going to touch your upper body now, okay Mr. Winchester? We just need to get an idea of where the paralysis starts.”
It was deathly quiet. In some sort of typical drama movie, they’d hear the irritating ticking of a clock from somewhere within the bunker. There wasn’t even that. Well, if Dean strained his hearing enough, he
A choked sob left Dean’s lips, lifting a hand to his face as his body is wracked with more sobs. His lungs heave with every breath, shoulders jumping with every sharp inhale. There’s a mess of words whirling around in his mind, and he can’t sort through any of them to say what he wants, no,
what I needed you to see, Cas. We don’t love you for your powers. Me, Sam, Dean, Eileen, and everyone that knows you loves you because you’re
Worried, Memory Dean cautiously approaches Memory Castiel, placing a hand on his shoulder. This proves to be a mistake, as Castiel immediately strikes Dean across the face at the touch, sending Dean sprawling backward.
Dean was expecting for Cas to panic a little at that. He had never actually seen Cas interact with children before – unless you counted Jack, though it’s safe to say Jack was just a tad bit more mature than the children in front of him. To his surprise though, Cas immediately bent down and scooped the young child up into his arms, responding to the kid’s high-pitched giggle of delight with a toothy smile of his own.
“Fantastic,” Dr. Sullivan commented with an encouraging smile. “And we’ve already gathered that you know your brother and what his name is, so I guess we can skip that one. Do you remember what happened to you?”
Sam’s talking to him. Going through the next steps of action to get the civvies out of here. ‘He doesn’t realize’, Dean thinks to himself. He didn’t see it, did he? Sam thinks he’s standing by this post of his own volition.
better than Dean had. Sure, hunting keeps you physically fit, but all those fights, and being thrown against walls, tend to take their toll on the human body. Perhaps the drink would catch up to him - all those years drowning his liver in toxins. Hell, maybe he'd even clog an artery after countless takeouts and greasy diner foods.
The room was empty of occupants, but evidently lived in. The ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign still hung from the outside of the door, and so there had been no housekeeping staff to clean out the boxes of Chinese take-out cartons from the night before that had been hastily shoved into the trash, or the few bottles of beer still sat atop the mini-kitchen counter in the corner of the room. The double bed sat in the middle of the room was made, but clearly in a rush and
you will think that from time to time, as much as it pains me for you to think that – I want you to take a look at this ring on your finger and remember that ‘Castiel, angel of the Lord’ is who I
Dean shook his head. “I’m gonna book another room for the night. Thought it’d be best we go have a look around their room, see if there’s any clues to where they went. Besides, there’s always the chance that they’re just chilling in there and Sam just broke his charger or something right?”
cheaper may he add, but if it got Sam to shut up about the wonders of modern-day coffee… “Wait a minute, I thought you said you hadn’t gone before?”
Claire leans away from Castiel to try and get a better look at the witch that was currently sitting in her favorite chair.
Dean watched as Castiel's eyes focused in on the keys. To Cas’s credit, he didn’t seem in the least bit embarrassed by what he had done. He simply swept the keys out of Dean’s palms and pocketed them in his trench-coat with a soft smile. “I assumed you would pass them over once we were in the car, but thank you.” And then, to add insult to injury, Castiel leaned up and planted a kiss on Dean’s cheek like it was no big deal. He had done it so casually - as if it had been a part of their routine for
“I have no idea. But I think I know who can.” Sam said, already standing up from the table. “We need to talk to the person who made the spells. Think we’re gonna have to summon the new Queen of Hell.”
“Guess we both got too much respect for our dads, huh?” Dean tried to joke, but it fell flat. “You gotta admit that God was more of a disappointment than my dad though, right?”
It’s a door Castiel has been stood in front of many times. The dreary grey concrete walls seem to focus his vision in towards the warm, soft colors of the door’s wooden material. Castiel’s hand wraps around the door handle, stepping forward to push it open. The door doesn’t budge under his grip, keeping him locked out from the room’s interior.
“I was quite certain from our conversation on the phone that it was not possible,” Sergei replied with a shrug of his shoulders.
Dean wheeled himself further into Cas’s room, pushing the door closed behind him as he made his way to the middle of the room. He hadn’t actually been in Cas’s room all that often… mostly it was Cas who would come to visit him in
“I figured that out, thank you,” Castiel replied, catching Dean’s cheerful smile out of the corner of his eye. “Which raises the question: why were you tempted to put me into a ‘banana hammock’ in the first place?”
the one he had found the day Castiel brought him out of Hell. The one they used to discover Castiel’s name. The one that had, slowly after time, faded away.
“They’ve accepted it surprisingly well,” Rowena said. “Then again, those that began speaking out were reduced to ashes, so… it’s not
“They are, yes. All except me. My parents never said it, but I think I wasn’t exactly ‘planned’. I believe they wanted the four children to name after the Archangels, and then I came along… They wanted to stick with the theme, of course. I was born on a Thursday, and so… There was my name. Castiel, the angel of Thursday.”
Castiel pushed himself into the front of Dean’s mind, waiting for his grace to settle into full possession. He pulled himself closer to the table, reaching out with Dean’s hand and placing it down on the carvings. As gently as possible, he traced the letters of his name with his finger, ignoring the sharp bite of the rugged edges.
“Me?” Cas asked, his brows pinched together as if he couldn’t fathom why Dean would ever want for him to tag along.
“Yes… It’s… it’s very rare for an angel to be killed, but have the vessel survive. And it’s even rarer to have the surviving vessel
Though all of that, Dean could see the confusion fighting for dominance on Cas's expression. He wasn't sure what exactly Cas had been expecting to happen if he had even caught him singing, but apparently, Dean joining in hadn't been it.
California… Doesn’t do that. California is complicated. California is progressive, and that ain't a bad thing! America sure as hell needs a bit of that. Hell, a
“Hey, don’t do that,” Eileen snapped curtly, making Sam startle. “Don’t start blaming yourself for this. It’s not like you forced Dean into this hunt. It went wrong – it happens.”
Jack didn’t even get to finish his sentence before his still waving hand was grabbed by Dean, tugging him forward into a hug that enveloped the young boy until he almost disappeared under the layers of Dean’s jacket and dress shirt. He then barely had a moment to breathe before Sam jumped in on the hug, to which Jack actually
And he had genuinely believed that. Every day waking up in the hunter's life, he had wondered if it would be his last. Could you blame him? Too many risks, too many opportunities for something to go wrong.
Then, the eyes flashed once more. Dean was back in control, teeth gritted in determination as he tried pushing himself
The booming, heavy knocks on the bunker’s metal door resounded around the bunker, its presence immediately heightening the tension that hung in the air ever since Sam had hung up the phone. Quite frankly, Castiel was surprised Sergei even bothered to pick up the phone – especially considering the fact that Sam's number would have shown up as ‘unknown caller’.
Dean tried to laugh, but what came out was more of a sob than anything. “I wish you’d told me, man. I wish you’d-,” He stops himself, lifting his head back up with a sluggish shake, wiping at the tears that had beaten his control.
The phonebooth he steps isn’t much warmer than the outside, but it does at least provide him with a brief respite from the pouring rain. Sam brings the receiver to his ear, sliding a few quarters into the coin slot and jamming his large fingers into the buttons, dialing for 911. His eyes slide shut as the dull tones of the phone ringing fill his ear, waiting to hear a voice on the other end.
“Yeah, but that’s… kind of the point,” Sam replied with somewhat of a wince. “Those witches? Back when I was working on the spell? That woman warned me, said that Billie would catch onto what we had done and close the loophole. And yeah, I know Billie’s dead now, but… the new Death - whoever they are - isn’t exactly going to let it slide, either. She made it sound like a one-time thing. And… we used it.”
“I like peanut butter and grape jelly sandwiches…” Castiel sounded so genuinely disheartened by Dean’s opinion of his flavor choice that Dean couldn’t even find it within himself to keep making fun of the poor guy.
“You said you heard screaming? I need you to try and check if anyone's still alive, okay? See if they're breathing, check for a pulse if you can.”
Dean’s eyes shoot up to Cas as his voice trailed off, the small content smile playing on his face slipping away. He didn’t need to finish the rest of the sentence. It was the issue they had been skirting around ever since they had stepped into his dream.
Dean could see the moment it clicked in Cas’s head. His eyes were wide like a deer caught in the headlights, looking to Dean as if to try and figure out what weird and cruel joke Dean was trying to play on him. There was no joke. There was no ulterior motive. Hell, not even
“No! No, please don’t do that.” Castiel hurried to shut down that idea. “I’d really rather you stick to my name.”
Castiel rolled his eyes at the teasing in Dean’s tone; humor was a typical fallback for Dean when in an emotional situation he didn’t know how to deal with, and Castiel was used to rolling with it at this point. “Are you saying you want it removed?”
“Dean,” Dean answered, knowing there was no point in giving a fake name seeing as the Doctor already knew his last time. “My name is Dean Winchester.”
Castiel sighed softly, wandering over to a table that had been pushed up against the wall, its wood rotting and weak from the torrential downpours of rain that had slipped through the panels of the barns room. Castiel gently traces a hand across its surface, pushing down firmly to check its weight before hoisting himself up and taking a seat.
“Uh-huh. You guys better get going then. Don’t let me stop you,” Dean rolled away from the two of them before they could say anything, forcing himself back up the ramp and down the bunkers hallway, which never seemed as long as it does now.
been around,” Castiel begins to say. “Normal schooling was forbidden, as they would fill our heads with
interesting, Cas would somehow find a way to make it seem so. Perhaps it was his enthusiasm in finding new material to teach his class at Stanford. Or maybe Dean got that warm, fuzzy feeling in his chest whenever Cas shared something he loved with Dean. One of the two. Probably both. Okay, maybe the latter more so, but definitely both.
"Please don't fight this," Memory Castiel asks of him. "It is my mission to recover your soul and place it back in your body. You will need to find your brother, Samuel Winchester–"
“Yeah, well… a high-school dropout who has barely any prior job experience and next to no references doesn’t exactly get many calls for interviews.”
Dean laughed smugly at his brother’s annoyed grumbles, though he quickly pulled himself back together. “Seriously though Sammy, I… I hope you know I’m proud of you for this. I know it’s not exactly what we – what
The candles formed a walkway, leading to an old table that had been left untouched inside the barn for thirteen years. There, sat upon the table, having what looked like a pleasant conversation with their legs swinging underneath the table was…
“Back at the bunker,” Sam answered with a jab of his thumb over his shoulder. “She’s looking after Miracle while we’re here.”
different from everyone else and – yep, there it was. There was no hovering like he did with Sam. Cas’s hand had oh so softly brushed against the bruised and split skin on his head, taking care not to put too much pressure that it would hurt, but enough so that he could feel the comforting touch. His touch lingered, seconds that seemed to tick by slowly before he felt that odd rush of simultaneous heat and cold of Cas’s grace, feel his blood vessels and skin stitch themselves back together under Cas’s hand.
His heart stops. Pauses, for just a moment. When it kicks back into gear, it's with a hard, resounding
"Wait, where's James?" Dean suddenly seemed to realize his son was not with them, looking panicked and worried by the realization. "Wasn't he with you?"
Castiel freezes immediately. Dean isn’t even looking at Cas straight on, yet he can still sense Cas’s frame tensing up out of the corner of his eye. If he were more of an asshole, he’d probably laugh. Except, the conversation they’re about to have probably won’t be funny.
"Not like that. I refused to see it at first, wanted to hold onto that anger. Because if I didn't have someone to blame for your death, then it would just fall to me.
For the first time this whole conversation, Dean had no answer. No retort, no argument to Cas' optimism on the shitty situation they were in. His brain had come to a standstill, refusing to make up any more arguments because Goddammit, if Cas' hope wasn't infectious, wanting nothing more than to give in to what Cas was implying.
“Damn right,” Dean said with pride, softly patting the dash of his Baby. “She’s carried us across the country more times than I can count. Never complains.”
Cas. I’m gonna-” Is all the warning Dean could get out, giving one last forceful thrust until he was burrowed deep inside. His balls tightened as he was pushed over the edge, shooting deep inside, coating Cas’s walls with his cum. Dean rested his forehead against Cas’s sweaty back, his dick giving the last of its feeble twitches.

If someone told me those thirteen years ago that I’d become best friends with that being? I’d assume they were drunk off their ass. If they then told me that thirteen years later, I’d be
But Jack wasn’t looking at Sam. His glassy eyes were fixed on Dean, fixed on the emptiness he saw behind Dean’s. “I’m sorry…”
Cas shuffled back over to his side of the hood, and Dean found he immediately missed the warmth of Cas wrapped around him. “I’ve never been complimented on my wings before…”
But what else was he supposed to do? Jack's death had been crushing in of its own rights, even when comforted by the fact that his human soul had granted him entry into heaven. Then, finding out that the Empty
“I thought it would be a kindness to hide it from you. Maybe it would make it easier… Now, I’m not too sure.”
would be it, Billie would take both of us and that was our end, together. And then you… you were saying all this stuff about me, this… well, they were things I refused to believe about myself, until you made them some of your last words and then… it felt disrespectful to disagree after that…”
Sam dropped his head back into the graffiti-covered plexiglass of the booth, the exhaustion of the evening beginning to take its toll now the adrenaline was wearing off. He knew he should be rushing back into the hospital now, pacing up and down the corridor as he waited for the doctor’s news. But his legs weren’t listening to his head. He felt glued in place. He didn’t want to go back into the hospital.
“Dean?” Sam’s voice is hesitant, unsure. Dean can barely hear it. Sam had, eventually, managed to get his feet under him. He had walked over to Dean, but wasn’t stood by his side. There was a few awkward meters of space between them, an invisible line that Sam couldn’t bring himself to cross.
Castiel’s eyes briefly flicker to the closed door of the Roadhouse at the man’s jab of a thumb behind himself, his new ears picking up the sound of soft music, chatter, and laughter emitting from within. “This… this
know the other reason. Maybe he’d been keeping it buried down, pretending that it had never happened. That Cas had never told him those things… Because even now, months after he had said them, after Cas had made them his final words to him, even with Cas
There’s nothing he can do but stare down at his phone as the shock took over. It… it was a joke, right? It had to be. Eileen was gone, he knew that… they had been there to discover her discarded belongings on the pavement, the keyboard still open on her phone just as Chuck had snapped her away, just as he had everyone else.
“Sam...” Jody takes a step back from Rowena, instinctively moving closer to where Claire and Kaia were – nearly bumping into Castiel in the process.
"It wasn't me..." The real Cas mutters mostly to himself, eyes scrunched closed, refusing to watch the horror he knows is about to occur.
Cas’s smile turned sad. “You, Dean Winchester. I wanted to know the touch of your lips, of the feel of your skin under my hands… I wanted to know what it would be like to wake up next to you, to be something that brought you some sense of happiness… I wanted to know what it was like to be seen as something more than family, a friend, a brother… I wanted what angels aren’t
“There was this plant… in the silo…” Jack briefly tore his gaze from his hands to look at the two brothers. “I hadn’t even touched it, I was just…
“Well, personally, I’d recommend you stay at the hospital for a few more days. But… from a medical standpoint, I’m not
“Yes,” Castiel answered, a bit more clarity coming into his eyes. “Apologies, but Dean is getting rather uncomfortable being ‘forced into the passenger’s seat’.” Castiel raised his hands to place quotation marks over the words.
Sam walked behind Dean’s wheelchair, leaning down to switch off the brakes before grabbing hold of the handles at the back of the chair.
Dean grins at Cas, raising his free hand to give him a friendly slap on the shoulder. “Ya see? One in the same mind…”
“Plain black coffee,” Dean answered. “Actually it was Cas - who I’m gonna guess is your brother?” Gabriel nodded at him. “Yeah, well, Cas kinda ordered it for me. I think it was called the, uh… ‘I Don’t Care?’ Weird name like that.”
“Oh,” Sam blanched, mostly moving on autopilot as he picks the knife back up and dunks it into the jar of jam. “You don’t want to come with me to bring him home?”
"Wait, Wait, before you start. Can I throw out a guess and say that 1) I was right, as I said I was before I left and 2) I'm going to be seeing you here in the bunker in roughly 12 hours, slightly pissed, and
how it was supposed to play out. He needed to see who was behind him, what had – quite literally- taken the bullet for him.
Now, freshly clean and with a new set of clothes, Sam felt at least somewhat more prepared to take on the rest of the day. He plucked the bag of Dean’s clothes and laptop back up from outside his room, making his way to the bunker's kitchen to find Eileen already sat at the table, chewing on a slice of buttered toast. Miracle was sat patiently next to Eileen, her head in her lap, best begging eyes on full display as she watched every movement of the toast in Eileen’s hand.
“He went back?” Castiel asked, the grip on Dean’s hand tightening for a moment. “How? I thought single parents couldn’t enlist?”
“My grace was changed, Dean. An angel’s grace, it’s a source of power, a piece of God himself; just like a soul. I’m not
Dean hissed out, the outburst of anger catching both Sam and Eileen off guard. “Was that Russian dickhead telling the truth? Is your grace running out?”
“I’ve got nothing,” Dean answered as Castiel expected him too, though with a light smile on his face that seemed to hint he was, strangely enough, enjoying having no idea what Cas was saying to him. “How about some Spanish? I know a little bit – maybe I’ll pick something up.”
The face Jack pulled at that could only be described as a ‘kicked puppy’ look. “Do you not want me here?”
“Then that’s what we’ll do,” Dean said with a tone of finality. “We’ll find a way, Cas. I promise you. All I’ve gotta do is… wake up.”
Claire was so frozen in place that Kaia, who had been following just behind, nearly ran into the back of her. Kaia’s eyes widened upon seeing them, partly hidden by Claire with a hand hanging onto Claire’s sleeve as what could ever be a comforting gesture for Claire, or an attempt to ground herself.
story, or Gabriel’s definition of a funny story?” Castiel asked Dean once he was seated comfortably. “It seems like you’ve got a good understanding of my brother's personality already.”
It was getting harder to talk now. His mind felt fuzzy and his body felt heavy. He wanted to sink into that darkness, let himself be taken by the tidal wave of drowsiness washing over him, and just… rest. He didn’t do that, though. Instead, he fought.
The scream that rips through him as he pulls himself off that rebar almost doesn’t sound human. How Dean had coped with this pain, he has no clue. There’s no relief as the last of the metal exits Dean’s body, only a disgusting squelch of muscle and flesh. To Cas’s surprise, Dean’s legs do not hold him when he stands. He crumples to the floor in a heap, knocking the wind out of him completely. It seemed the rebar itself was the only thing keeping Dean upright…
Sergei takes Dean’s silence as ‘not a no’, stepping up to his side and placing his hand atop the hand-shaped scar on Dean’s arm. His hand doesn’t quite
Dean’s eye’s snapped open, a frantic and uncontrollable response to the sound of his brother yelling his name, expecting for there to be trouble. His body jerks up – or at least tries to – nothing more than a flailing of his arms and a jerk of his shoulders.
is different from the first time. That car ride home was nothing less than awkward, of stale silences and anxious side glances from his brother.
Sam was still diligently focused on their research, only giving her a small shake of his head when she had asked him if he wanted to take a break, focused solely on the book in front of him. She

“I…” Cas paused, looking almost pained as he concentrated. “I… I suppose towards the end when Jack was restraining me, and when I… well, I suppose it’s possible I could no longer hear you through my… screams…”
“Huh… well I’ll be damned,” Dean mumbled under his breath. “All this time, huh? He was helping us the whole time?”
“It's okay...” Castiel whispered to the two boys in his arms, lowering himself down into the damp November dew-covered grass and watching as the roof of the house collapses in on itself. “You're okay, now. I have you.”
"My name is Castiel," Memory Cas dutifully answers. "I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition."
“And I love you,” Castiel confirms, the words sending Dean's heart into overdrive every time he hears Cas speak them.  “Even in our future, when you send me to sleep on the couch for things that are likely your fault.”
Dean blocks off what’s likely to be a multitude of questions from Cas on his little musical secret, coming to a stop in front of Castiel’s room. If it can even be called that… it was a rarity for Castiel to use the room. Which, to be fair, is understandable when Dean considers the fact that Cas is an angel and, as such, does not require sleep. Still… it always hurt to walk past the room when the door was left open, seeing the bed bare and the room empty of any…
The things he did to you… the responsibilities he forced you to bare… I’m sorry, Dean. I know you have a lot of respect for your father, but that is not a respect I can share.
Immediately, the burning sensation running through his veins cooled. He could still sense it’s presence, the power humming just below the surface. It was trippy when he thought about it for too long. It wasn’t
“That’s what your grace smells likes,” Dean tells him with a lazy grin, brushing his thumb leisurely across Castiel’s hand. “You smell like home.”
“Oh, not much,” Claire says with a grin much too sly for Dean’s liking. “Me and Kaia just had a bet going on which one of you would confess to the other first. I bet Cas would do it first. Kaia bet you’d do it first, but I said you were way too emotionally constipated to manage something like that.”
Sam pulls the phone away from his ear, the operator's words fading away and cutting off completely once he places the phone back onto the hook. It was better this way, he reasoned with himself. The police would take care of the situation, would make sure the children got to where they needed to be. There wasn’t much help he could provide that the police wouldn’t be able to.
Castiel wasn't sure if he had even wanted to see what Dean's dream life would be. He could guess, of course. Such guesses usually consisted of Dean and Sam out on the road, stuck in a constant loop of driving, investigating, and ganking the monster they'd been tracking. It was what Dean was good at, and it was clear it made him happy.
"Yes, I do know. Just as we both know that your parents were destined to be together. We already know that your parents were an assigned couple in heaven, brought together by a cupid.
Castiel he had first met; eyes lit up with burning grace and bursting with a golden light that illuminated the two
Dean’s heart freezes in his chest at the words. Tears spring into his eyes faster than he ever thought possible, the watery smile Cas was giving him only forcing the tears out faster.
“If you say so, Cas. What do I owe you?” Dean replied, pulling out his wallet from the back of his jeans, already wincing in preparation for a hefty bill.
“Nah, you deserve a break,” Dean cut him off. “Besides, I think I need the distraction right now. Can’t stop
Charlie grinned at his unsure-sounding apology, shaking her head at him. “You got nothing to be sorry for, Cas; Wouldn’t exactly expect an angel to be the most skilled in the art of seduction – and Dean was as blind as a bat to miss all the obvious signal you were sending his way. But seems like he got there eventually, right?”
to find a way to make it work. In that moment when I told them? It was then I realized- This whole time I had feared it was Gabriel following Lucifer’s path, but there I stood telling my family how I felt, my brothers looking at me in disdain and I knew… It was me. I was the one copying Lucifer. I had become rebel of the family.”
it. Pounded on the poor guy. I was there listening when Bobby got the phone call… Dude’s face was smashed in so bad you could barely recognize him. Next thing we know, Dads being discharged, for obvious reasons.”
“I thought angels weren’t supposed to use God’s name in vain?” Dean joked, grinning at the spectacular glare he got in return.
Then, Castiel stands from the table. It’s agonizingly slow, the stool screeching as it’s pushed back against the concrete floor of the kitchen. Dean’s heart is in his throat as Castiel picks up the glasses and the whiskey bottle, wandering over to the kitchen sink and delicately placing the glasses inside. Dean didn’t think his mouth could get any drier, watching Cas as he cleans up and places the bottle back inside the cabinet Dean had got it from. He doesn’t know what to expect once Castiel is finished with these chores that, quite frankly, seem like they can wait.
“Ambushed,” Dean replies. “Course, I don’t see much of it. At first, I don’t understand why I’m on the floor. Just felt like I got punched damn hard in the side. Benny’s pulling me by my armor, trying to get me behind cover. My units returning fire and I’m trying to get up but they’re screaming at me to keep my ass down. Course that’s when I feel what feels like warm water being poured on me and I have this weird, delirious moment where I’m wondering if it’s started raining or something. I look down and there’s just this big puddle of
A grainy mess of greys and whites sparked to life on the screen, frames flickering past until the image of a man in a sharply dressed man came into view. Ah, seemed it was their favorite Men of Letters, Sinclair… Dean could recognize the room as their dungeon room, the sigils painted on the ground looking freshly painted. Behind Sinclair, just out of view, sat a battered-looking man in a chair. His hands were bound in a familiar-looking pair of silver cuffs, head slumped down in apparent unconsciousness. Next to the chair was a wheeled table, a silver tray sat atop bearing tools that Dean couldn’t quite identify yet.
Sammy on the other hand? Well, he would fit right in. So, of course he would choose Stanford for college.
for being such an interesting patient. I may just have to write a paper on the man who defied all odds, then continued to amaze with his healing abilities.”
He’s perched on what Dean knows from experience is an incredibly uncomfortable bar stool at the end of the kitchen counter, the beer Dean had offered him pressed against his split lip from their, um… reunion. Dean tapped his fingers against the cool glass of whisky he held, watching Cas as his eyes scanned curiously around the apartment, and Dean starts to feel guilty for not keeping on top of the cleaning as much as he should. In his defense, he wasn’t exactly expecting company.
“I can’t believe it…” Sam says, turning wide, stunned eyes over to Eileen, his face breaking out into an ecstatic grin – one that she happily returns. “Eileen, you – you did it!”
Castiel’s subtle smile had turned all soft and warm, which is kind of odd considering Dean was talking about stabbing him; but then when Dean remembered the way they met, it’s not all that weird.

Dean grunted at his brother’s stubbornness. “What if I have to come save you if this Gabriel guy turns out to be a murderer or something?”
. No flash of teeth, barely a curved movement of his lips. He doesn't need to, because it's all in the eyes. The happy gleam that shines through them, seemingly accentuating the sharp brightness of his blue eyes, well-worn laughter lines crinkling at the corner of his eyes.
The hinges to Baby’s doors creak as they’re pushed open, followed by the dull thud of it being closed much softer (and with more respect, if Dean’s being honest with himself) than he had. Dean hears the soft, padded footsteps of shoes against the asphalt, then the feeling of the hood dipping as an extra weight is added. He can feel the warmth of Cas’s body bleeding into the cold air next to him, only mere inches away. Of course he would… That was his thing. Plenty of space to stand or sit, and Cas always chose to get as close to Dean as humanly possible.
Dean’s thankful smile comes out more strained than he intended, the effort of forcing his face into one dampened by his crushed spirit. “Well… thanks for showing up, anyway. At least now we know, y’know… you can’t help; so that’s crossed off the list…”
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean swore, pulling his fingers out of Cas and quickly wiping the remaining lube off against his boxers. He yanked the offending material off in a flash, letting his straining cock spring free from its confines. He squeezed some more lube out into his hands, stroking his dick quickly with one hand until his length was coated with the thick, slippery gel. Dean lowered himself down, one hand bracing himself on the back seat of the Impala whilst the other gripped tight around his cock, guiding himself towards Castiel’s entrance. He teased Castiel’s rim with the tip of his cock before easing himself in, pushing forward until the head of his dick popped inside. Both their breaths quickened, nearly matching in speed as Dean gradually pushed forward. Dean moaned as he bottomed out, his entire length enveloped in the velvet heat of Castiel’s walls.
grin, leaning back with a belly laugh so out of nowhere that it nearly had Sam reaching for his pistol.
“You better tell me the truth here, Cas,” Dean said out loud, voice calm and steady in that detached way where your anger has passed new limits. “Were you hiding shit from us?
“I'm sure Cas will tell you about what we discussed in Heaven when he wants to. As for you Dean, well… I needed you to see the real you.”
No doubt about it, he recognized the golden-haired barista that had apparently managed to swoon his brother over. Gabriel was staring down at his phone which he held in one hand, the other hand busy holding a lollipop to his mouth. It seemed that Gabriel was so absorbed in his phone that Dean worried for a second that Gabriel was going to walk straight into him, but once he was a few feet away, Gabriel came to a stop. Putting the phone into his pocket, he pulled the lollipop out of his mouth with a wet ‘pop’, finally looking up at Dean. The cocky flirtatious smirk he had been planning promptly melted away to one of immense confusion- that of which Dean was sure he was mirroring right back at him.
When that’s not what happens. His eyes are immediately drawn to the faded, black sigils that were painted around the interior walls of the barn, sigils that would keep out nearly every supernatural creature known to humanity, all apart from….
He didn’t bring up the idea to Cas until about a year after they were married. Mostly due to one huge piece of news from Sam that Eileen was pregnant.
It was only once the breeze blew through the trees and into their little clearing that Cas could feel the wetness on his face, a few stray tears having escaped his eyes and slipped down his cheeks without him even noticing.
Miracle was more than happy to have the rest of her little family back together, periodically racing between their legs at the library table for some well-deserved pets (which, let’s be honest, was as great for them as it was for her).
“It’s-“ Dean pulled his phone out of his pocket, tapping on his contacts icon and carefully transferring over the number on his cup under the name:
“So, how often did you do that?” Dean asked, shifting one foot to rest on the bottom of the bar stool, the other hanging off the edge of the stool. “I didn’t get hurt
It gets louder as he gets closer to the bedrooms of the bunker but, once there, it becomes clear its not coming from their anyway. He can make out the sound a little better now though, and it almost sounds like it's... Music?
“But… you didn’t come to me…” Dean said. “I would remember that. You went with Crowley instead… you ripped open Purgatory for its souls…”
" 'S good to see you smile, Cas" Dean tells hims honestly, hand still tightly clamped around Castiels
Cas, looking a little worse for wear sat at the base of a tree. He looked every bit as dirty, bloodied, and miserable as anyone would after nearly twenty-four hours in Purgatory, but it didn’t matter, as it was the best sight Dean had ever seen.
long to realize?” Castiel asks in amusement. He quickly clamps his mouth shut in embarrassment when he realizes he was finding a horrific moment in Dean’s life funny.
The soothing hot water did it’s trick, scrubbing away all the grime, sweat, and stress built up from the past two nights. Sam savored the feeling of the warm water pounding atop his head, bracing himself against the tile walls as the drops cascade down his body and soak into his hair. He couldn’t stay in there forever though, eventually gathering enough energy to flick the switch off and cut off the water, the instant chill of the air pushing him out of the cubicle to grab a towel.
“I left my number for the guy you came in with. You know, the tall guy? Looks like he could probably crush me, not that that’s a bad thing,” Dean pulled a face at Gabriel’s description of who he can only assume is Sam. “Wait a minute - - Are
A flash of blue pulls Claire’s gaze away from Sam, glancing over to see the last second of Castiel before being greeted by eyes she knows belongs to Dean Winchester. She can only grunt in surprise when Dean’s arms are wrapping around her back, yanking her towards in a rather clumsy and awkward hug.
“I think you knew you had me the second you placed your order,” Cas said, playing with his own ring now with an affectionate smile
“About sixteen,” Castiel answered, eyes lowering to the table. “It was the last time I ever saw him. Much too young to be kicked out of his home like that.”
the Men of Letter did…” Eileen says softly, gently sliding the file out of Sam’s hands. “I suppose a lot of the knowledge we have today came from similarly cruel experiments… as sickening as that is to think of.”
"Cas, fight this! This is not you! Fight it!" Dean yells in desperation, hoping to get through to Cas.
Sam corrected for him with a world-class bitch-face. “Sign says it’s a macchiato, but with an extra kick of caffeine to it. Hence the macho at the beginning.”
“Me and Dean still do that,” Sam admitted with a small laugh, leaning his hip against the kitchen isle as he spoke. “She’s
“No,” Doctor Sullivan said, crossing his arms and giving Dean a stern look. “But I can imagine you might try to do things you used to do and over-exerting yourself.”
“SAM!” He yelled out into the chaos, unable to see his brother in the swarm of bodies. There’s no response from Sam, only the cruel laughter of the Vamp’s mocking his cry for help.
“Maybe one day,” Dean repeated softly. “I just… I don’t think I’ll ever be able to quit cold turkey, Sam. I just… I need to do
"I'm hoping to power through and get a normal sized chapter up next week!" she said. You know - like a liar.
when Bobby told me Dad was coming back for us,” Dean snorted before lifting the bottle in his free hand to his lips. “I couldn’t understand why Bobby was mad with Dad… All I cared about was that I had my dad back. I didn’t know the dad I was missing died the same night mom did.”
“It’s Sammy,” Dean answers, frantic eyes flickering between Cas and the hallway. “I think he’s in trouble.”
"This is when I rescued him from Hell," Castiel finally finishes, watching his memory self stood in the doorway.
"Twelve years I've known you. Twelve years since you walked into my life, and I had no fucking clue the impact it would have."
“I’m stuck between a constant cycle of wanting to kill you, and doing everything in my power to keep you alive,” Castiel delivered his line completely dead-pan. “It’s a rather exhausting existence.”
“No,” Castiel interrupts him, slowly rising back up with his duffel in hand. “You think you’re trying, Dean. You really do. But when it comes down to it, you’re not entirely ready to apologize to me. Not yet.” Dean couldn’t even get a word out as Cas reached into his trench-coat pocket before firmly planting something into his hand – something familiarly rectangular and thin in shape. “And even if you are… I’m certainly not ready to forgive.”
Sam gives him one last stare, one last moment where his gaze seems stuck to Dean before it drops back down to the table in front of him. He clears his throat as he finishes grinding down the last of the ingredients in the bowl, taking a deep and trembling breath to steady himself as his eyes drift over the words to the spell one last time.
“And this-,” Is as far as Garth got before the other twin – who had been staring up at Cas with wide eyes – peeled himself off of his mother and shuffled over to Cas, reaching out with his hands and a high-pitched command of “Up!”
