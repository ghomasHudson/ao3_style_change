"What?" he asked, surprise loosening his stubborn posture.
"Oh, yes, absolutely. Yes! Ha! I know what that's like. It's hard to commit when you might die any moment. Me being a battlefield surgeon and all that, I definitely understand."
weird to live with or something? This was like right after school started and I had only met John once. I did not know him well enough to decide if I liked him or not. I adore him now of course because he is so cool. He talks about things with me that make Dad's face red though that is not the ONLY reason I adore him :)
their presents to each other AFTER
"Well?" Sherlock asked, impatiently.
Thus, the boxes in the attic of my mind palace burst open, and the equilibrium in my life was overthrown. Now I was in torment. I had no sense of self-preservation when it came to my life, but when my heart was on the line? Was the possibility of love with John worth losing what we already had even if it would never truly be enough?
In late October I find a buyer for the land—five hundred and twenty-three acres of land that's been in my family in this exact configuration, more or less, since the tail end of the eighteenth century. I don't think my forefathers would understand my motivation for selling, even if they wouldn't have found the idea of me with a man distasteful. Then again, they're dead, which is what I keep telling myself when guilt overwhelms me. There are only myself, my sister, Harry, and distant cousins left in my family. None of them have the slightest interest in carrying on the family work.
, a mean, shrewish voice said to him,
"You did," John says. "But the reality doesn't measure up to your ominous warning."
, these stupid, insipid women he continues to date.
"What do you mean?" John asked. It was his turn to turn to the side so he could face Sherlock, his head propped on his hand.
John's face burned, and he knew he was red. He couldn't bear to look at anyone, especially not Sherlock, and he had never in his entire life felt so humiliated and ridiculous. He said nothing, and forced his body to unfreeze, skated around the edge of the knot of Holmeses, and made for the front door, his eyes lifted only enough so that he wouldn't trip over something, because that was a mortification he didn't think he could live through.
that living had seemed insurmountable. That was generally the apathetic phase of his depressions, and yes—they were depressions. He'd called them
"Oh, maybe—I think he was twenty-seven," she says, squinting in thought. "So, I guess about six years?"
"If you are worried I don't love you back," he says softly, looking down at my face, which he takes in his hands, "Then you're an idiot. Move in with me. I could use your expertise."
feel a little guilty, even now.
Sherlock points an accusing finger at Mycroft and says, "I thought you'd given up trying to drive John away from me, but you still insist on playing this childish game. If you haven't frightened him off by now, I hardly think it can be done."
Sherlock grimaced and turned his face away, cheeks flaming red with shame. "I'm sorry," he said quietly.
I cut off a wild, hysterical laugh before it could escape. "When have I
Sherlock growls, "John and I can turn around and walk back out if you're going to behave in such juvenile fashion."
"Well, it
"Wait," he said frowning. "How did you know about the body parts?"
"Men," he says, and I lift my head up above the bar and say, "Excuse me?" only it comes out more of a croak. He smiles, sultry as fuck, and says, "My preference is men. You, on the other hand, are bisexual, but I don't think you have much experience with men." He takes a deep breath and claps his hands together. "As for wine, I prefer dry."
"John, stop apologizing. You haven't offended me. And you're right about my genius siblings. They get it all from Mum. She's a world-renowned mathematician and Eurus takes after her, though her field of study is computer science. Mycroft is a genius at strategy and observation. Charysa is an artist of multiple talents, all of which she has the ability to perform at a professional level. Dad and I? We're the normal ones. I'm just a headmistress at a girls' boarding school and Dad's never claimed to be anything other than what he is—a country squire."
"Do you have a girlfriend?"
John might not come at all. Or, he might come, but—disgusted at Sherlock's lack of personal hygiene—leave again immediately after. Or maybe he would come and stay, even though he was disgusted, feeling obligated to help Sherlock because they'd once been lovers.
. You, on the other hand—you are one brilliant bastard, and I want your number."
"Two-two-one-bee Baker Street," Sherlock reads dutifully, his voice turning up in delight when he says
about what I meant to you? Because you didn't want me to think I was anything more than just a flatmate and convenient errand boy?"
"Wow, you're a stand-up husband, aren't you?" John sneered.
Then John hears, "Oh my God, cover your eyes, Charysa! Don't look, seriously, turn around! Go, go, go!" It's Eurus's voice.
? Probably the latter. "Can we talk in the morning, then? I hate to push, but I'm sure you agree it must be talked about."
Sherlock clenched his jaw, feeling his back molars grind against each other. His nostrils flared and he tilted his head back to stare at the ceiling. "Fine," he said tightly, stalking towards John as he did so. "I couldn't keep my hands off of you, okay? You were like a drug—I kept telling myself
"I talked to Sherlock," she says, then takes a sip of her tea.
"What, me?" John asked, face still glowing with amusement. "I'm your basic middle class Englishman."

and snapped his mouth shut. He found his eyes sliding away from John's while he waited for John to speak. Finally, in a menacing voice so far removed from his everyday affableness that he seemed a different person right then, John said, "If you think for one moment that loving someone means giving them blanket forgiveness, then you don't know the first thing about love."
Most of my sheep are absorbed into the herds of wool farmers in the area. Seventy-three are left over and I'm forced to send them for slaughter, almost triple the amount I normally send off.
"Oh, Sherlock," John whispered, trying not to succumb to tears of his own, knowing it would only damage the fragile control Sherlock had on his emotions right now. "Of course I'll hold your hand."
Before John could reply, Sherlock was clutching his arms in a punishing grip, his face buried in John's neck and he was

"So I've been told."
"Okay. Okay, that's…" Sherlock says to himself. "Yes, that's right. Good."
been best friends who just happened to have a relationship more complicated than friends with benefits.
I'm on my way into Inveraray to watch the footie when I see him. This road is private and the only place it leads is to my house or to the Darrow's place. A gate cuts it off from the old military road that emerges from the trees and runs parallel to the River Shira. So there shouldn't be anyone out here that I don't know, and certainly not anyone who'd be idiot enough to get himself stuck down the bottom of a burn. There's dozens of them everywhere and over time they erode away the earth, creating steep sides. This is where he is. I wouldn't have seen him if it weren't for the flapping up of his coat as he falls down the five foot, thirty degree gradient berm he's trying to climb.
"Uh," is what John says instead, hovering on the threshold. He tries to catch Sherlock's eye, but Sherlock is too busy glaring at his brother, his upper lip curled in a sneer. "Okay," agrees John finally, creeping into the sitting room, keeping a careful eye on both brothers. He sits on the edge of the couch, puts his elbows on his knees and leans forward. "So, what's up?"
"Nonsense! I find you endlessly fascinating."
"You're right. I'm sorry. And for the record, you aren't a selfish, unforgiving arsehole. I think our time together has shown you are, in fact, the complete opposite. You have put up with me—well, there's no excuse for the ways I've treated you, but it was my cowardly way of hoping you'd get fed up, and leave and thus divest me of the responsibility of coming clean."
"Yeah." I nod my head rapidly. He stares at me, his head cocked to the side, eyes narrowed like I've presented him with something too complicated and confusing to understand. My veins fill with ice. "I don't know what I was thinking. I'll go," I say and begin to turn just as the kettle stars to boil. Before I can escape, Sherlock grabs me by the bicep to stop me and then presses me up against the fridge.
"John?" Mycroft says as though from far away.
After about ten seconds, to Sherlock's astonishment, Toby ducked his head with one sorrowful, longing look at Sherlock, and then got off the sofa. John said, "Thank you," to Toby, who lay down on the floor next to the sofa, chin on paws, and let out a deep, meaningful sigh.

that they're already in the car and crossing over the Thames on Hammersmith Bridge before John even thinks to ask where they're going.

John fidgeted with his mug, his eyes on his hands. "Are you still involved with someone?" he asked looking at me from underneath his eyebrows.
"Exactly," Sherlock said and bowed his head once towards Louisa. He clapped his hands together. "So—I thought I might go stay with Nana and Grandad for a week or so. Would you like to come with me next weekend?"
"Oh. Right. Um. Boyfriend, then?" John asked, then felt a sudden and sharp desire to suck the question back into his mouth. He didn't want to know whether there was someone who kissed Sherlock Holmes, who made him breathe faster, who drew hoarse moans in that deep voice from that long throat.
The other thing Sherlock could do, as an adult, was tell Dr. Llewellyn that he wasn't allowed to tell Sherlock's parents anything about Sherlock leaving his care. He just wanted to move on with his life, to leave behind the weak boy who'd fallen apart when his brother left for school, who'd had to be taken out of boarding school himself because he was

"Now, Toby, Sherlock and I are going to sit on that sofa and I'm going to snog him senseless and I expect you to give us our privacy. No jumping up on the couch with us. Do you think you can do that, you sweet boy? I know you're happy he's home and I'm delighted to meet you, but come here—no, not for a kiss, I just want you to listen to me—" John's voice fell to a quiet murmur. "I've got a huge crush on your Sherlock, and if you and I are on our best behavior, I might get to have a bit more than a snog on the sofa, you know what I mean?"
"Sh, it's okay, settle," John says, and me over onto my back. I'm breathing shallowly and quickly, and white fairy lights dance in my peripheral vision. He soothes me, stroking sticky hands down my sides, and then he fits my feet flat against the mattress, pulling me back and up onto his thighs while also scooting forward. He fits his arms underneath my legs, the backs of my knees resting in the cradles of his elbows and bends forward over my body. He's looking down between us and I'm gripping the sheets and babbling while he puts one hand on himself and
"Hello," he says, and when I continue to stare, my brow furrowed, he raises his eyebrows and gives me a sly smile. "Thought I'd run off, did you?" When I don't respond, he points his glass towards my chair, and says, "Sit down."
too? Unbelievable!" John cried.
of the separation."
," Louisa groaned, tilting her head back.
"Why'd he suggest that?" John asked.
"You're only saying that because it's my turn!"
"I expected animosity, broken crockery, and small European countries being invaded in a fit of pique."
"Out!" Sherlock growls again and gets behind Mycroft to push him out the door faster then slams it hard enough to shake the walls.
"So gorgeous," John, murmurs, cupping my cheek reverently. "I’m going to my bedroom to grab lube. There are quite a few things that I have fantasized about doing to you, and when I come back, you’re going to be naked and waiting on your bed for me. Okay?"

They both stilled at the sound of the upstairs floorboards creaking. John looked at Sherlock and hissed, "What is going

like I've known him more than seven hours), but there's something about orgasm that makes people look either stupid or otherworldly and Sherlock's reaction is otherworldly. It's like I've captured some exotic fey creature who masquerades as human, but turns into leaves if anyone speaks or something like that.
"Why don't
Sherlock's voice. John stops, turns around, and watches the figure approach. A blanket of calm abruptly descends over him. This is what it feels like to be battle ready, such a familiar feeling for John, one he feels all the time around Sherlock. It's just that normally it's not Sherlock he's expecting to do battle with.
With that in mind, he took a shower, shaved carefully, and dressed in trousers and a dark blue shirt that John always said brought out the blue in his eyes. He even put shoes on and dried his hair with a blow dryer, styling it as he went, maximizing the curl factor. (John had always said that Sherlock was worse than a girl when it came to primping, to which Sherlock had replied that they couldn't all be scruffy, sexy, big-dicked army doctors who seduced men left and right with nothing more than just a cheeky smile. John had preened like a girl being told she was beautiful, which Sherlock gleefully pointed out).

Audrey had released the belt on his dressing gown, and it fell to the ground in a billow of dark and heavy silk. As always, the light in Sherlock's room was dim. Audrey had toed off her shoes at some point and when she let down her hair, Sherlock found himself burying his face in her neck, breathing in the light perfume of her skin, a combination of lavender and lime soap. He bent down, cupped both hands behind her knees and slid his hands up her bare thighs, thumbs pressing in between her legs. Her skirt bunched around her waist as he went.
As the minutes ticked by, he began to feel less confident that he'd correctly interpreted the looks Dr. Watson had given him. He dithered as long as he could, trying to look busy while standing awkwardly, but when his watch showed it was going on half eight, he began to put on his winter things—first his coat, then his scarf, then his gloves, everything drawn out twice as long as it normally took for him to put them on. He gathered up the rest of his things and started for the door. Before he walked through it, he cast one last, longing look towards the front of the room and found that Dr. Watson was waving him up to the front, setting his laptop bag back down on the desk and, abruptly, telling the woman something that Sherlock couldn't hear but he didn't need to. The woman's face fell, but then she nodded and they smiled at each other. Dr. Watson put his hand on her shoulder and gave her a gentle push and then waved Sherlock up to the front of the room again. When the woman lifted her hand in goodbye, Dr. Watson gave her an absent wave and a tight smile. When he saw Sherlock begin to walk to the front, his smile brightened and Sherlock's breath caught.
Sherlock murmurs things John can't identify as words, his large hands smoothing up and down John's back, soothing John's fevered body, cooling his overwrought mind.
"Can I keep going?" John tried to ask softly, but it came out a croak from his parched throat. He cleared it, and tried again.
"Watch your language at the

"Right, right. That's—good. So, why all—" he gestures around us, then looks back at me with both brows raised.

He nodded his head and I stroked my fingers through his hair before leaning forward for a soft kiss. John brought his hands up, but I grabbed his wrists before he could put his arms around me. "Don't touch me without permission."

John strangles a quiet tight sound almost like a whimper that wants to escape his throat. Sherlock, of course, notices it, and his eyes begin to gleam dangerously. John asks, "What, um, what was the question again?"

John tears into the paper, revealing a picture frame collage with photos of he and Sherlock. Mouth falling open, John stares at each picture, amazed. There are five in total. There's two from crime scenes and in one of them, John and Sherlock are laughing together, their gazes caught on each other.
Before he can answer, Mycroft is on his feet and moving towards John. "Can I get you something to drink, John? Scotch? Wine?" He moves behind the bar and waits.

"Sherlock?" John asked, looking back and forth between the woman and his lover. "Tell me what's going on. Who is this woman?" John turned to her, angry, worried over Sherlock's erratic and desperate behavior. "Who are you and what do you want?"
"It's not a joke?" John asks with a half grin.
"Does he know that you and I were separated for the last six months? That, you know—we were already pretty much—" she waved her hand in the air in a wordless gesture of grim humor.

"C'mon, then, up," John said, and wrapped both hands around one of Sherlock's biceps, and heaved him up. John herded him into the bathroom, turned the shower on, waited for it to warm up, and then—much to Sherlock's shock—efficiently stripped them both naked. "Oh, don't stare at me like that," John said at the look on Sherlock's face. "I'm not planning on having a grope."
"Sent them away," Sherlock muttered, focused on trying to stand. John reached for him as he staggered.
"Don't care," John said, shaking his head side to side in a slow, almost lazy way.
"Fucking hell," I mutter and turn off the winch. I go over to the burn and lean over the side. "Stop trying to use your feet against the side of the berm! Lean back in the harness, cross your legs at the knee, and draw them up against your bum. Just let the winch do its job, yeah? Stop trying to climb the damn berm yourself." I wait for him to nod. His face is deathly white, and I'm struck with sympathy even as I shake my head.
"Don't be nervous. I promise I won't be gentle," John says with a saucy smirk.
Reaching up, I smoothed his hair with one hand and whispered, "Which do you want me to do?"
Inside is a snowglobe. Sherlock looks at John questioningly and John, smiling shyly, says, "Let the, um—the snow, let the snow settle. But if you look at the little plaque, see here?" he says and points at a small brass plaque on the polished ebony wood base of the snowglobe. "Read what it says."
John's hand circles my wrist, and he pulls my hand away gently but firmly, and says softly, "I didn't mean I'm not—obviously, I'm attracted to you, I mean you've—clearly you've deduced it." He lets go of my wrist, and crosses his arms over his chest, defensive, closed off, and there's a swell of nausea in my gut, and a painful tightness in my chest, and he says, "It would be—it wouldn't work, Sherlock. I can't just have sex with you, and then—I know you'd push me aside during cases, and—it's tempting, but you'd be able to live without it and I—no. I can't."
"Mycroft learned to read when he was three," Sherlock said with a sulky face. John laughed louder than Sherlock thought his revelation warranted, and when Sherlock frowned even more, John said, "It's just—I mean, I get why you two are so competitive."
," he ground out.
"But I do it anyway," John says with a grin, though the statement illuminates a truth inside him that he knows cannot be uprooted.
At that moment, as though conjured by magic, Sherlock appears. John wills his face not to give anything away. Sherlock frowns. "What are you two doing in here?"
"Lunch?" she asked. "We can map out what to tell Louisa. She's been asking if she can stay with you. At least I know now why you haven't let her. I'm guessing you didn't want her bringing home tales of John."
"You told me that what's-his-name—that little
John laughs and when Mycroft frowns at him, clearly offended, John looks to Sherlock for guidance. Sherlock's face has gone ashen and his eyes are wide with horror. John's heart rate kicks up a notch and his laughter cuts out. He looks back at Mycroft who's pointedly ignoring Sherlock and waiting with an arched eyebrow for John's answer.
By contrast, "In the Mid-Midwinter" claims "the light comes back/the light always comes back." It's a retort, of sorts, to Donne's poem. No matter how bleak the darkest night, light is on the horizon. In the "meanwhile, there will be the winter moon for us to love the longest."
Sherlock's already turned back to the window but he smiles, a secret fleeting thing John would have missed had he not been watching for Sherlock's reaction. "That you do, my friend."
Everyone looks up when they walk in and John automatically blushes, then purses his lips in displeasure.
Eventually, that turned into
And then I stopped abruptly, breathing heavily, and took a few seconds to catch my breath before groping the now hot, nearly magenta skin of John's arse. For the last few minutes, he'd been moaning regularly, his voice hoarse. I reached between his legs and wrapped my hand around his erection. John thrust into my hand. Feeling the copious amount of pre-ejaculate he had produced set something inside me even further ablaze.
I choke off a shout of disappointment (never good to let John think I'm not overjoyed to orgasm in his presence) but he must see the distress on my face because he's murmuring to me words of praise and love and telling me I'm a
"I'm fine," John said with a knowing grin that made Sherlock scowl. John's grin turned filthy and he continued, "Although, you might want to grab a large glass of water. You'll need it when I'm through with you."
Mycroft keeps his eyes on John as he says, "My family would like to extend an invitation to spend Christmas—"
"I'm sorry to hear that," she said quietly. "What will you do?"
Sherlock froze, a grey haze tearing through his mind, leaving him momentarily dumb.
"Uh—" John's thoughts trip over each other. His face starts to burn as a knowing look comes into both girls' eyes. They glance at each other and then back at John with mirror expressions, blazing with purpose.

John rubbed his hands briskly over his face, and when he put them back down in his lap, Sherlock reached out and took his hand again. John looked up at him in surprise, but he could see the gratitude in John's eyes. John squeezed his hand, and Sherlock squeezed back. They kept their hands clasped together.
There was plenty of open space in which Sherlock paced, thinking out loud, while John mostly tuned him out as he focused on the task at hand. Suddenly, Sherlock had come to a stop, muttered
"Why did you and Victor break up?"
"Why not?" John asks.
. There was a helpful arrow and everything.
You know how the English take joy in butchering foreign languages."
She lifts her eyes heavenward. "For God's sake, John, you work with a detective, so this should be an easy exercise for you. Think about it—what reasons do people have for keeping secrets?"
"Not enough specific memories that are happy," John clarified. "Like what you just told me about your mother. You know, memories that happened on a specific day, with all the details you described—the time of year, the way you felt, colors and sounds."
"That's what I have you for," Sherlock said sweetly, and then immediately realized his mistake. He tried a sheepish smile.
, Sherlock wailed. John had gotten down on the ground with him, and said,
"My expertise? Expertise in what—sheep farming? And I can't live with you. I, uh, already rented a flat."
By now, he should've known better than to make assumptions where John was concerned. John often acted completely out of character. So when John wrapped his arms around Sherlock and kissed him, he was stunned into stillness.
The Red Hand was a BDSM club. I'd purchased a membership two years ago immediately after I'd learned there was such a place. I was thirty-two and had been aware of my inclinations since my late twenties. Up until I learned of The Red Hand, I'd had to scrounge through internet rubbish heaps in the hopes of finding partners. Within the world of BDSM, my tastes are quite common, but being a gay male Dominant in search of a gay male submissive had always been difficult. Even at The Red Hand, I'd had difficulty finding a regular sub, and even more difficulty finding a regular sub I actually wanted to have sex with. I spent what felt like an entire year when I first joined the club wanking in the bathrooms after watching countless scenes—and participating in a few—without having a sub of my own and an outlet for the arousal such scenes inspired.
Sherlock opened his mouth, closed it. He was wringing his hands and he forced himself to stop. "I didn't have a plan B."
later, they lay side by side on their backs. Like they had when removing their shoes, they occasionally shared a diffident smile, but this time those smiles were laced with smug satisfaction. Sherlock felt like they were two boys who'd been up to no good and gotten away with it.
John thinks, but he says, stiffly, "I'm not his boyfriend."
He has gone and he has taken all the light in my life with him.

"This is
. Once in my room, however, I become abruptly aware of what is about to transpire between us. One of us (presumably John) will be preparing the other (me, in this iteration) for anal sex. At least one—probably two, though no more than three (or four?)—fantasies I've had about my flatmate and object of my adoration will occur.
"Okay, okay, this isn't couples therapy here," Oasis said, waving her hands at us. "But look. Sherlock. If you're gonna go for John, you have to
"John, you need to turn around and walk back out the door and don't come back until I call. Will you do that for me, please?"

John opened it to see Angelo standing there with his cane. John smiled, accepted it, and then shut the door. He turned around to find the hallway empty. He walked up the stairs slowly, unsure—were they going to continue to kiss? And might the kiss, perhaps, lead to other things? Like, removing pesky clothing? Sliding their naked bodies together? Orgasms?
"Back to your Mum," John said.

unhappy to hear it. He wouldn't explain what he meant so maybe you can."
Sherlock and Audrey looked over Louisa's head and shared a smile.
A sultry smile lazily makes its way across John's mouth until he's looking at me with such blistering hunger that I have to lower my eyes so I’m not seared blind.
"You, too," Sherlock said, the corner of his mouth tilting up.
"Get down," Sherlock hissed, trying to get Toby under control before John could witness too much of his undisciplined behavior.

"John, I'm so glad you came," Mrs. Hudson said, pushing him relentlessly to the middle of the pew, while managing to look both tearful and weak. Reluctantly, John scooted to the middle to allow Mrs. Hudson to sit next to him and Mrs. Hudson's sister to sit on the aisle side. John couldn't help but glower. Mrs. Hudson patted his knee. "Agnes, this is Dr. John Watson. I told you about him." The sisters exchanged a look that made John turn a furious shade of red.
"John!" I cry as I feel the heated coil of orgasm starting again deep in my arse and balls and thighs and John momentarily stills with what I know is surprise before he rasps out, "Oh, fuck, Sherlock, your arse is squeezing my cock. Are you gonna come again? Fucking amazing, baby. You're gonna come again, aren't you? Touch yourself, c'mon, that's right, baby, let me hear it, let me hear how fucking hot I make you, so hot you come twice. You ever come twice before? Huh? I bet nobody else has made you fucking come twice, only me, right?"

Once I had the requisite flannel, I wasted no time climbing up behind John who was kneeling as requested. I spread his cheeks, grinning at the sharp inhalation he made when I handled his bruised skin too roughly. I cleaned down the crack of his arse and over his hole with the wet flannel, then tossed it behind me, heedless where it landed.
"Right," John says, pushing against Sherlock who's apparently turned into a marble statue during this very brief exchange because John finds him an immovable wall. "C'mon, let me down."
"Yes?" he asks, opening it a crack.
"What am I to you, Sherlock?" he asks in a low, furious voice. "Why did you tell your mother you shouldn't have brought me here? Is it because you didn't want me getting
"I'm Sherlock Holmes and you're not a serial killer," he says as casual as can be, while drying his hair with a towel and showing off his hairy ankles and freakishly long toes in my too short trackie bottoms.

Mrs. Hudson says something, but I don't hear because Sherlock has already maneuvered us into the room and kicked the door shut. His eyes are so alive and full of joy. Then he's kissing me and I'm pushing that silk dressing gown off his shoulders and we're falling on the bed.
echoes through his mind and his imagination takes it and spins it into a fantasy:
"I didn't think the answer would require a history of your sexual escapades. Oh, and let's not forget the proof that you're completely untrustworthy and an absolutely heartless bastard."
John crouched in front of Toby, with a blinding grin on his face and chucked Toby gently under the chin. Toby leaned forward to lick his face and John said, "Only one," and offered up his cheek and Sherlock thought
"Fine, fine," Sherlock says, not entirely serious in his protestations. "Let's go open gifts. But later, after we've put in the minimum time requirement for
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes. "Do you have a boyfriend?"
"Let me explain, please," Sherlock murmurs mournfully, crossing the few feet between them before John can react. John tries to take a step back, but Sherlock gets a hand around the back of John's neck and pulls him in. John has less than a second to think

After running through the rain-polished streets, they collapsed against the wall of the downstairs entryway. They laughed and sucked in deep breaths and laughed some more. Their heads turned towards each other and, with that same joyful recognition as before, their faces drew closer. They were still laughing when their lips touched.
He's just standing there in the open doorway in my biggest tracksuit bottoms which don't reach his ankles and the extra large hoodie Georgie or someone had thrown in the back of my Wagon once after rounding up stray sheep. I open my mouth to say something, but then don't. Instinctively I know to be silent. So instead of asking him if he needs anything, I just flip back the duvet on the other side of the bed. He makes his way over without hesitation.

Still bent slightly, he stroked the inside of her thighs with his thumbs, just under the swell of her vulva, her cotton underwear the only barrier between them. They watched each other. Then, she drew in a quiet breath and said his name on a whisper of a sigh, and he staggered with an intense flash of desire. He dropped to his knees, yanking Audrey's knickers down with impatience. She gasped, shocked, and her hands gripped Sherlock's hair painfully as she struggled to keep her balance. He wrapped his arms around her thighs, pressing his face into the dark hair between her legs.
"You've been fidgeting and running in stops and starts for the last two days. So, what is it that you're worried about."
. I notice he's wearing his dressing gown and it's very loosely belted.
"I don't know," John said, doing that slow casual head shake again and still staring at the journals.
"Jenny put the two of you in the Apple Suite," Violet says quickly, stepping into John's space, and the slender woman standing behind Violet waves at John and then hugs Sherlock tightly. "Why don't you take John up there now so he can get settled in and then the two of you can come down and join us in the sitting room?"
he says. Why does he stay here, then? Why does he continue to do my bidding, no matter how outrageous? Why does he care so much about my health, if he doesn't care about me?
"Einstein didn't talk until he was five," Sherlock snapped.
Sherlock looks at John in confusion. "You never asked."
"Breakfast is at nine sharp," Eurus says.
"I will not!" Violet cries, making a shooing motion towards Eurus who's cackling.

"Oh, right here is good," John said, touching a fingertip to his thin pink lips.
Now that voice was silent, and in the silence, a new voice spoke.
"I met Victor when we started secondary school at age eleven and we became best friends. We kissed for the first time when we were thirteen and it progressed from there. We were barely fourteen when we had sex for the first time, and then we
They exchanged numbers and John left him at the flat he shared with two other blokes. Back in his bedsit, John stepped into the shower, where a sudden fit of sorrow overtook him. What the hell was he doing fucking kids in alleys? John had a few one night stands under his belt, but those were handjobs or sucking cock, not full on anal sex in a fucking alley.
John waited until Saturday evening to text Sherlock.
—with that same imploring look and he wanted to turn around and go back to work and finish his shift. After that, he would come home and have makeup sex with Sherlock and it would be fantastic. They would eat and watch TV and Sherlock would make him laugh. When he went to bed, Sherlock would come with him, even if he wasn't going to sleep.
I fall asleep, or at least I must have, because my bladder wakes me, but it feels like it's only been a minute since I lay down. I wish, for the thousandth time, that I wasn't beholden to my body's needs, especially since a dreary lassitude has stolen over me, and I hate the idea of getting up. After a while, though, I have to get up, and standing seems to make it all the more urgent, so I speed walk into the loo, and my body relaxes as I empty my bladder. I wash my hands, and then try to go back to bed, but I can't sleep, and I'm bored, and I refuse to hide in my room any longer.
"I'm sorry," Sherlock said miserably, shaking his head.
"John, this reproduction is incredible. There's even a little tiny hunting knife stabbed into the mantle!" Sherlock says gleefully, sounding almost like one of his sisters. He looks at John then, his eyes brimming with emotion and says softly, "Thank you. I love it." Then he bends forward quickly and kisses John on the lips, pressing just a second before sitting back again.
John snorts a laugh and then descends greedily on his sandwiches.
John's face goes dark and cold, the way it does when he's aiming his gun at someone. His nostrils flare. He says, "I should move out because you're jealous I met someone?"
I hadn't meant for this to be so angsty. It was supposed to be just fun toppy Sherlock seducing John, buuuuut...John and Sherlock said, "No," and then fucked off somewhere else until I agreed to leave in the angst.
"John," he says with an amused half smile. "How did crying in your neighbor's sheep shed lead you to my kitchen?"
"Up your arse?"
John frowns, and says slowly, "Do you mean, like—"
," Sherlock says, cutting him off. "I don't wish to be with someone who's ashamed to be with me."
"What? You're just what?"
"I'm taking off your blindfold so close your eyes," I said, and then took it off, careful not to snag any hair on the elasticized strap. I cupped his face in my hands and bent further over him so that I blocked out the overhead light. "You can open your eyes now."
"Normal," John huffs in laughter. "No offense, but I thought for sure you were all mad and that's why Sherlock didn't want me here. But you lot are totally normal, other than Mycroft and Sherlock. Though I suppose that's genius for you."
Because it was a Tuesday night, the club was quiet, with hardly any people around. This made it easier for Oasis to find me and corner me. She glared up at me. "Where's your victim?"

This story takes place in 2018. I've kept their ages the same as when the show aired so Sherlock has just turned 34, and John is 38, turning 39 in June.
The time stamp was three minutes ago. Sherlock hadn't felt the vibration because he was too busy pretending to look for it.
More silence ensues. Without looking at Will, John can sense that he wants to say something else.
"Good," I say slowly, nodding my head twice. "And just for the record—I need you, too. And I—I wouldn't have just walked away—but I understand why you might—" I struggle with the rest of the sentence while John watches me curiously. Finally, I spit out, "—want to see
Jenn, Katie, and Tia are
That had been almost two months ago. John had not heard from anyone in that time, except for Mrs. Hudson who rang him shortly after the funeral. She confessed to getting his number from Sherlock, and apologized to him for having tried to push the issue of his and Sherlock's relationship. John forgave her, his voice rather stiff. He'd never been particularly close to her and hadn't much liked the way she fussed over Sherlock as though he weren't a grown man perfectly capable of caring for himself. That, of course, was before he knew what Sherlock was like when it came to caring for himself.
to be his boyfriend?" Charysa asks with the kind of beseeching look that makes John want to give her whatever she's asking for.
"Are you suggesting that—" Sherlock began, drawing himself up indignantly, before John shushed him, pressed a finger against Sherlock's lips.
How could John, a doctor and soldier, argue with that?
Sherlock snorted and Audrey glared at him again. "I told you she wouldn't be upset," Sherlock said with a pointed look. "And she's hardly one to mince words if she were."
Something almost imperceptible passes between the two brothers. If John wasn't looking right at them, he would've missed it. It's nothing more than an arched eyebrow on Mycroft's part before Sherlock growls—actually
Oxygen—O
"You can wrap up the crime scene," I threw over my shoulder. "I need to look into something before I can give you any answers!"
Teasing laughter and jeers accompany them as they gather up their gifts and set them aside to be brought upstairs later. Sherlock grabs his snowglobe, but John leaves the laptop so that Eurus won't feel tempted to interrupt them in order to set it up.
"It's you," Sherlock says, staring at me in a combination of awe and bafflement.
Sherlock turns to pace. "This is intolerable!" he says.
I changed the title of chapter 6 to "Run From Each Other" because it didn't make sense to call it "Forgive Each Other" anymore. I didn't call this chapter "Forgive Each Other" either because I did a major rewrite of this chapter and the theme of forgiveness is more subtly threaded through the remaining chapters.
Coated in mud to his knees with more spattered up his clothes as far as his face, I can still see he's gorgeous. Despite the bedraggled appearance, the skin so white it glows, and lips tinted almost purple from hypothermia, he's beautiful enough that I'm momentarily distracted and have to push myself to refocus on my job.
of shoes—
"I'll tell you about it some other time," Sherlock said, with a sad, wry smile.
"Shut up. Kiss me."
When I finally get him up out of the burn and out of the harness, I help him limp over to the Wagon and set him down on the open hatch. Doing some quick triage, I diagnose a sprained right ankle and hypothermia. He's shaking so hard he can't speak and now that he's out of the burn, all of his hostility has fled leaving behind a man who looks as though he can't quite believe he's going to live after all.
"Anything else, Mr. Holmes?" Jenny asks after she parks the cart next to the low table flanked by two leather club chairs.
"John!" Eurus and Violet call joyfully. Violet adds, "Do you like putting puzzles together?"
"John!" Sherlock said, shocked out of his tears.
Meanwhile
John sees a flash of something dark in Sherlock's eyes before he closes them. He takes a deep breath and turns to John with open eyes and a closed expression. "I'm not unhappy about seeing them. I'm not altogether happy

and then I'd see you across the room or crouching over a corpse with me or coming downstairs all rumpled and warm from sleep, and I would lose all control. Do you know how hard it is for me to lose control, John? You're well aware of my disregard for the needs of my transport, especially during a case. I won't eat or sleep, but I can only hold out, maybe a day at most, when it comes to touching you, and even the most casual of touches makes me want to touch you

. Every few seconds, he taps his lips with his fingers.
John tries to cover his gaffe but ends up babbling. "Not that, you know, being normal isn't, uh—doesn't mean you're not a genius. Are you a—?" The amusement in Sherrinford's eyes makes his discomfiture worse. "Ah, hell, I feel an utter git. I'm sorry."
And then,
John groaned and tried to shift himself up onto his knees, but I draped myself across his back, holding him down. I thrust myself against him so that he would feel my hardness then put my lips at his ear.
John's overflowing with joy, feeling as though he's gained so much more than he ever allowed himself in any of his fantasies where he and Sherlock got together. He never expected a family in the bargain, or to be cared about so much by people he's only known a few days, simply by dint of loving Sherlock.

"I just cleaned this table yesterday," she says, shaking her head in exasperation, then she lifts her head again and hollers, "Sherlock!" loud enough to startle me. There's no answer and Mrs. Hudson looks at me. "He should be here. Would you like a cup of tea, Dr. Watson?"
"Fuck," he muttered to himself.

talked to anyone, but at the time Mycroft was in France, working for the Home Office, and I was finishing up my teacher training. Sherlock declared he had no interest in sixth form and went straight to Cambridge from school, against Mum and Dad's advice.
"Greg asked me for my opinion. As a
"I don't want you to think it means we're getting back together again," John said, and then turned his head away.
"John is sitting in the front next to me," Sherlock said without further explanation.
Sherlock was late for the class, though not late enough to miss anything important. The seven other people in the hall were each standing up to give their names, their job description, and the name and breed of the dog who would help them fulfill that job. It was the kind of socializing that Sherlock hated most—stilted, embarrassing, and completely lacking in information that was actually helpful. Having gathered everything he wanted to know about his classmates, which was almost nothing, Sherlock turned his attention to the instructor.
"Now I want you to undress completely, and then kneel right here." I pointed between my feet. I could see him start to work himself up to objecting and I rushed to stop him in his tracks. "Don't think about
Sherlock grimaced and began to open his mouth, but John surged forward and managed to wrestle the both of them onto the bed so that he was straddling Sherlock's thighs, both of them clad only in their trousers.

Sherlock had said, his brow furrowed, and mouth turned down,
John doesn't mention my disastrous seduction attempt, but it hangs between us. There had been casual touches between us sometimes, nothing lingering or particularly inviting, but I had no idea how much we had grown comfortable with it, until it stopped. If I was in the kitchen, and John needed to get by, he went around the table. If I tried reaching over him to get something, he'd scurry out of my way. He didn't sit on the couch with me when he was watching telly. He didn't lean his hip against the table, and chatter about inconsequential things while I stared through my microscope. When evening fell, he didn't linger in the sitting room, but retired to his bedroom with a falsely cheerful
"Mycroft and I are seven and five years older, respectively, than Sherlock. He was our baby brother, and we denied him nothing, including our constant attention. Then he started school at five and Mum went back to work. When he was seven, Mycroft went away to boarding school and I followed two years later. Mum had long hours and Dad's always been busy with the estate, which isn't a job with office hours and a five day workweek. When all four of us were around, Sherlock had plenty of attention and affection, but with Mum back at work and not home until supper time most evenings, then Mycroft and I gone, Sherlock was...well—we abandoned him. Whether we meant to or not, he was completely unprepared for coping with the solitude."
"Yes, I—" John stops there, nothing coming immediately to mind. Then he decides to take a page from the Holmes handbook and be blunt. "I would say it's good to see you again, too, but quite frankly I'm feeling a bit blindsided."
"Because John is my friend," Sherlock supplied, "and it helps to hold a friend's hand when you're sad."
Dr. John Watson, veterinarian and canine behaviorist, was supposedly the best multi-agency dog trainer in England, but Sherlock didn’t see how you could learn to train your dog if you left the dog at home. But Greg had made it clear—rather, Superintendent
"Hello," said a woman's voice. John's eyes flew towards the source. A beautiful woman with glossy dark hair was standing on the landing, hand resting on the newel post, her head framed by the stained glass window behind her. She was tall—taller than John—and wearing a summer dress made out of some light material that lent her an air of sophisticated whimsy, a navy coat thrown over her arm. Her accent was as posh as Sherlock's and the way she held herself had

Whether he couldn't or wouldn't, I don't know, but he was kicked out at the beginning of his second year for drugs. He was angry and depressed and refused to explain what happened. Mum and Dad sent him to rehab—" She closes her eyes, her face pinched and sorrowful, then opens them and continues. "My darling little brother—he was barely eighteen years old!

John, grinning madly, unable to stop even though it feels like his face is about to be stretched beyond endurance, looks at Sherlock who grins back.

John silently reassures himself it's okay that the Browning is upstairs in his bedroom where it won't do him any good if there's someone in the flat who he needs to shoot. Taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly, he steals upstairs to the kitchen entrance and peeks around the open door.

"Ah, yes, experiment about saliva—not important. What are you

The man on the other end of the phone sighed, but John was not so stunned that he didn't notice this sigh was different from all the other sighs John had heard Mycroft make. It wasn't cynical or condescending. No, this was the sigh of a weary man. Had he heard a hitch in that sigh?

Even if he was in his mind palace, Sherlock would never be able to ignore three knocks and multiple calls of his name. In fact, he would've shouted something like
an arrogant arsehole. But Greg had known him a long time, and he could see the unhappiness in Sherlock’s eyes, and said, only half serious,
Even though I was waiting for him, I was still startled when John walked into the kitchen. His steps were slow, deliberate. He stopped near the table and pulled out a chair. I gave him his tea and sat down in the opposite chair, moving a pile of newspapers out of my way.
Mrs. Hudson leads me up to the first floor where there's another black door, this less glossy than the door to the building. It's opened a crack.
"With my life," John said without hesitation.
John scoffed. "No trust fund to draw on?"
"Hey, what's this?," he says gently, in the type of voice generally reserved for distraught children. I would be embarrassed, if I hadn't already reached the maximum allowable for that emotion. "C'mon, you. Talk to me. Whatever it is, we'll work it out together, yeah?"
John stood and turned to Sherlock, who was still standing in his coat, one glove on, keys in hand and grinned at the stunned look on Sherlock's face.

repeat that to anyone, Sherrinford, especially not your mother."
"Afghanistan," John said, tilting his head to squint at the ceiling as though he was about to undergo an uncomfortable procedure and was trying to squelch his unease. Sherlock allowed his fingers to trace the edges of the scar. It was small, but raised with white, ropy, healed-over skin.
John took an Uber from his rented room on Chiswick High Street to Our Lady Queen of Peace Catholic Church in Richmond. When Mycroft sent him a text with the details for the funeral, John had been gleefully surprised to discover the Holmes family were Catholic. Mycroft and Sherlock were both so strident about logic and evidence they could gather with their senses, that the idea that they might have grown up going to Sunday Mass every week was a glimpse into Sherlock's life that was more intimate than lying in bed while they were both naked.

, John continued to do what I said and go where I pointed him, no matter how inconvenient my requests, even when I dragged him out of work, out of restaurants, cinemas, pubs, and—on one memorable occasion—out of bed with a woman when they were both half naked. In fact, I couldn't remember a single time John refused to do something for me. I'd always thought it boredom on his part, and that he justified the indignity of it by telling himself he was helping with my work. After all, my work put criminals away and saved lives, and John was all about justice. Plus, there was that need to protect others.
John strokes his cheekbones and matches the intensity of Sherlock's gaze. "Yours," he promises again, voice gentle. "Always."

"I suppose I could withhold making him tea," John muttered, and got the side-eye from the middle-aged woman sitting next to him.

"You have kept every facet of your life a secret from me since the day we met but have never respected my right to privacy. You can't even stand near me without looking over my shoulder. Do you know what that's like, always being laid bare like that? Not even my porn preferences are sacred to you!"
"Sherlock doesn't do—boyfriends and—that sort of thing," John mutters, his face ablaze.
"Where's Louisa?" Sherlock asked, picking his blue dressing gown off the floor and shrugging back into it. He belted it tightly, feeling strangely vulnerable.
"This one looks good," he murmurs in my ear, then the hand on my hip disappears. "Corkscrew?"
. He waited a bit, knocked again, and called Sherlock's name. Silence. John knocked a third time, called Sherlock's name, and said, "I'm coming in!" and opened the door.
"I know, I know," John said, looking contrite. "I'll be quiet from now on."
as I'm stroking myself to a second orgasm, and John says, "That's it, let me hear you, god, Sherlock,
"Excellent!" Sherlock says. Then his eyes grow hooded and he purrs, "Now. I've a year's worth of fantasies about you stored in my wank bank and I'd like to see how many we can get through before Christmas dinner." His hand reaches out and cups John's head proprietarily. "At the very least, I'd like to kiss you again."
"I talked to Jeremy yesterday," Audrey said. Jeremy was their solicitor. She took a sip of her coffee. The steam curled up over her lip before dissipating into the air. "He said if we're serious about getting a divorce, he can recommend someone for each of us, but that he's too close to both of us to feel he'd fairly represent us, no matter how amicable the divorce may be. He already gave me a few names, and said he would call you later, as well."
John can't help but smile. "But that's a good thing. Right?"
"Says the man at the door," Sherlock said, still catching his breath. A few seconds later, the doorbell buzzed.
But when he gets three fingers in me, I realize with frustration that I won't even last through his preparation. "Shit, fuck, John, hurry
, not because Sherlock was embarrassed about being gay, but because he was embarrassed by people who acted silly in public. He liked men who enjoyed dancing in nightclubs and kissing in the shadows of buildings, who laughed at Sherlock’s jokes, watched him wide-eyed when he was brilliant, who didn’t take it personally when he was distracted by an experiment, who knew not to call or text him when he was working on a case, who knew not to show up uninvited either, but who were fine with Sherlock breaking into their own flat or house to use them as a sounding board. He liked men who were idealistic about love and didn’t hold grudges.
. Maybe he'd even bring Audrey up, let Sherlock know that she had seemed worried about Sherlock. If Sherlock looked like his normal self, he'd definitely bring Audrey up. If he didn’t, then he'd say the other, about not hearing back from him Saturday night. Yes—that's exactly how he would play it.
"Mm," he agrees, eyes closing as the orange, sugar soaked flesh disappears into his mouth.
"Where is he now?"
"There you are!" Sherrinford announces from the mouth of the hallway. All three of them whirl to face her as she marches towards them. She's scowls at the girls and says, "Mum and Dad are waiting for you two in the entry hall. It's time for Mass. Besides, John didn't come here to be attacked by two nosy brats."
John's lips are trail wetly along my jaw, his top lip catching on my stubble, and when he gets to my chin, he plows the fingers of his left hand through my hair, around to the back, and uses a handful to
John has barely returned with his whiskey when Will says, "I know you said you and Sherlock weren't romantically involved, but I can't help but wonder—and stop me if I'm overstepping, here—whether that might change at any point."
"I would say
Sherlock sighed, sounding much like Toby when he was forced into behaving, and flopped back down on his back. "I was being an arrogant arsehole, which—according to Greg—was a symptom of loneliness."
job to guide him where he needs to go, even at home."
voice saying
Sherlock sneers smugly. "John will allow himself to get excited, and pack, and at nine o'clock tomorrow morning, there'll be no car arriving and he'll feel a fool."
The light begins to turn gloomy and John checks his phone one more time. "I think I'll ring Sherlock and just see—" he says, rising up from his chair, but the front door opens, closes and the sound of girlish voices over the occasional monosyllabic rumble from Sherlock sifts in from the entryway.
, you know what I mean? You can't have Geoff here on the side just in case. It's not fair to anyone. So. I laid the groundwork.
"Two," John says immediately.
"I suppose we may as well," Will says, and gives John a mournful smile. "We're near as close to the house as we are to the pub. Lord knows where the rest have got off to. I reckon we can head home if you don't mind."
"No. Sex. And certainly not with my
"Finally, she said
John unlocked the street door and leaned on it in relief, accidentally slamming it shut in the process. He winced. He hoped Mrs. Hudson didn't come out to fuss at him about slamming the door. He didn't fancy making small talk with her. In fact, he didn't fancy talking to anyone. He considered going straight up to the second floor bedroom, thus altogether bypassing Sherlock and the problem that had been occupying his mind all day. They still paid rent on it, though mostly used it for storage—John hadn't slept in it since the first week he moved in.
As he did all that, he felt numb. He didn't think about anything beyond what he was doing. Step one, pull off the pillowcases. Step two, pull off the sheets. The duvet had, thankfully, been kicked onto the floor by his feet as he'd crawled on the bed towards his wife only, what—maybe twenty minutes ago?
I fall asleep without realizing it because I wake to an empty bed. In the living room, Sherlock is already dressed in his own clothes.
"Of course," Mycroft said softly, almost sadly, and then he was through the door, and John was shutting it and locking it, and sliding down into a crouch where he put his head in his hands and cried.
With no other direction for how to proceed from this point, Sherlock did what he'd already planned to do after Audrey left, but before John got home—change the sheets, shower, and take everything that smelled like her down to the utility room across from 221C, where the washer and dryer were.
. So, yes, he takes a much more passive role when he's with a man.
A beta reader (at least mine) must be - patient, discerning, educated, available at odd times and for odd reasons, confident, well-read, and practical. They must also be willing to sooth their writer's nerves, encourage her when she's down, guide her when she's lost (and not just in the manuscript either), be firm when she's whining, and gentle when she's not.
"But don't you
"Look at Sherlock's hair!"
John gives a half-hearted greeting to Mycroft then turns to go up to his room, knowing better than to be drawn into one of the Holmes' brothers' maddeningly silent contests of will.
Since Sherlock, though, I can't stop wanting to
He could pack his bag and leave now, sneak out while everyone else is still asleep, but he won't. He might be a coward when it comes to opening up his heart, but he would never show that kind of disrespect to Will and Violet.

than flatmates.
The horror on John's face brought Sherlock to see his condition from an outside perspective. He was ashamed, and suddenly wanted John anywhere but here, where Sherlock was pale, and cold, and too thin, and ugly, and lost, and his once-brilliant mind dulled with anguish.
I cringe at the tone in his voice. The thing is—I never lock the door when I'm in the loo. The disapproval I have for anyone but John, corpses—and, occasionally, Mrs. Hudson—to be in my personal space is well known to everyone, and especially John, so it's never been an issue. He's walked in on me in various stages of undress or, ironically, performing bodily functions one can only perform in the loo.

"Were they your fingers or someone else's?"
I held my forearms together above my head to show him how I wanted his arms placed. He raised his arms up, wrists together, and I buckled on the leather cuffs. I folded a length of rope in half around the chain between the cuffs, then guided the free ends through the loop made by the folded edge. Before I tied the rope to the headboard, I guided him carefully down onto his elbows. The position forced John to keep his knees up in the middle of the bed or risk losing the leverage his elbows provided.

That didn't change the fact that Sherlock had committed infidelity. He'd lied. He'd destroyed John's life, not to mention the lives of his wife and daughter!

months since he left. The ache had loosened some of its hold. Like the depression, though, there were little memories that could knock him out with a punch that came out of nowhere. Every once in a while he did what he was doing then—he let himself feel every fucking miserable bit of his heartache as a way to check how far (or how little) he'd come. It was like opening a steam valve. He could function like a normal, well-adjusted, not heartbroken man the rest of the time, if he allowed himself a day to let all his pain and rage out. At first, he had many of these days, and he'd spent them wailing into his pillows and failing to eat or drink until his eyeballs felt like they'd been rolled in sand, and his mouth tasted disgusting from mild dehydration. He'd eat a few biscuits, gulp down three glasses of water, one after the other, and then sleep like the dead. When he woke up, he'd put on his game face and soldier on until the next time he needed to open the valve.

, piped up another unhelpful voice in his head.
"When we got inside, she held me close and alternated between scolding me and—and—" Sherlock's voice broke and he put his face in his hands. He felt John's fingers brush through his hair. "She called me her sweet boy, told me how much she loved me, how precious—" The last few words were whispered, that pain in his gut rising up and shaking him enough for tears to drip onto his black trousers, where they disappeared into the fabric. John peeled both hands away from Sherlock's face, and held them in his. Sherlock raised his wet face to John, who let go of one of Sherlock's hands to reach up and flick away the tears with his thumb. He did one cheek and then the other. John's eyes slid to Sherlock's and they held each other's gazes.
John stares at me for a minute, and, finally, he turns on his heel and flees to his room. I feel entirely too vulnerable in this moment—my skin can't contain the multitude of feelings inside me—passion, fear, anger, longing, hurt—I'm completely undone by the knowledge that I have fallen painfully in love with John Watson.
"Sherlock," John breathed, staring at his former lover, reduced from the powerful, magnetic man he had fallen in love with to a shivering, emaciated wreck. John rushed towards him immediately, reaching for Sherlock's wrist to take his pulse before he'd even thought about it.

I'm up at midnight and since technically it's the 23rd, I'm posting early for all the night owls and/or early morning risers.
, and if my unsuccessful search for an impromptu enema hadn't ruined my arousal, my embarrassment right now would. I open my mouth to say something, anything, that will get John out of the bathroom so that I can think of a way to get out of this situation with my pride and mine and John's tentative love affair intact, but, of course, my great intellect fails me, and my jaw snaps shut. I slump against the wall and cover my face with my hands, shaking my head a few times.
"Contained? So you've felt this way about me for a while?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hello?" Sherlock called out. He shrugged out of his coat and hung it in the closet of the narrow hallway in which he stood, then started up the stairs. Audrey met him on the first floor, coming out of her office. She was barefoot, dressed in tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt, her hair pulled back into a haphazard ponytail. She wore no makeup, and her eyes were red and swollen. In the mirror that morning, Sherlock's had looked much the same.
John lifted his eyebrows in a question. "Really. That's what you think?" he asked, smirking.
After that momentary brightness, listlessness settled over Sherlock again, and he found himself dropping into one of the table chairs, crossing his arms on the table top, and laying his head on them. He allowed his eyes to drift shut, the puttering sound of John in the kitchen at 221B again, a solacing background noise. He must have dozed off because the next thing he knew, John's fingers were browsing through his greasy hair.
fucking cute! I've never seen you do that before!"
John wants me desperately, but he would never allow himself to acknowledge it, much less attempt to satisfy his desire. He's not
"No," Sherlock said, shaking his head earnestly. "I mean I'm in love with you. I want you to move in with me. Me and Toby. Now that I've found you, I can't—"
"Exactly," Sherlock said, nodding his head. His eyes caught on John's smile. John's smiles were always kind of sardonic, but every once in a while he turned a beaming grin Sherlock's way, leaving Sherlock dazzled and stunned, wondering what he'd done to deserve it.
"I know it's fine," John said defensively. The edge of Sherlock's mouth tilted up in amusement and John felt all his insecurities—which he usually managed to hide from himself—float up briefly to the surface before he pushed them back down.
about this first?"
"Let's wait for Mycroft and Evelyn to get here, Charysa. I'm sure Evelyn would enjoy going with us."
Instead, I kissed his right arse cheek, leaving my lips pressed to the spanking-warmed skin for a few seconds, then straightened back up. Without thinking, I reared back and hit his arse with my open hand and all my strength. This time, John's forward momentum was caused by the force of my blow.
"Okay, okay, let's not get worked up," Will says, putting a calming hand on his wife's knee. Then he turns to his son and says, "Sherlock, what your mother's trying to say is that you ruined the surprise and that was important

I can't sleep. The hours drag by. All I can think is that tomorrow he'll be gone and I'm lying here alone when I could be with him, even if all we did was sit in companionable silence.

I'm wearing a long-sleeve t-shirt and thick flannel pajamas, but even with that on, I still feel a shiver when the duvet drops to my waist.

yes," John replied and climbed off of Sherlock. The two of them meandered through the flat towards Sherlock's bedroom, Toby following mournfully in their wake.
"Indeed. I think I'll need several kisses—lots of kisses—
I fry up some sausage and eggs for breakfast and we eat and drink tea in silence. We are distinctly uncomfortable with each other. I could argue that the deep contentment we shared last night before and after dinner was a result of the alcohol but it wasn't.
(From now on, I'm just going to copy and paste this at the end of all my stories if that's okay with y'all?)
. I've had a very long time for this story to marinate in my brain shack so writing it has been easier and taken much less time than other stories I've written. But because it's been sitting with me for so long, I feel a little sad and letdown that it's over now. That's pretty much how I feel when Christmas is over, too!
! Thank you so much. I, I—it's marvelous, I love it. It's perfect."
Dr. Watson had seated himself back on the desk, his hands gripping the edge and one foot swinging in a short, lazy curve in and out and in again. He grinned at Sherlock.
"You're unhappy about going to see your family. Why? Did Mycroft invite me just to irritate you? Please tell me that's not why he invited me."
"Oh, yes, you're Sherlock's John," Mr. Holmes said with an air of sincere, if muted, delight. "It's so lovely to finally meet you. I'm Will."
"If you don't want to say—"
"Keep going," she says, making a circling motion with her finger. "What are some more mundane reasons people keep secrets? Those of us who don't commit murder."

Without looking at John, she left.
"Your office is fine," he said, stuffing his hands into the pockets of his jeans. He felt ridiculously nervous, as though this was a first date, rather than the end of their marriage.
"So, you
John nodded his head, his mouth drawn, and eyes down, as though he'd been expecting Sherlock to ask, but hoped he wouldn't.
I made for the curb with even more haste than normal, trying to outrun Greg's questions before John had the chance to dig in his heels and demand I give Greg some answers. As I rushed out the lobby door of the block of flats, and waved my arm frantically for a taxi, I told myself

"I think you should talk about her. You haven't said anything since we went to the cemetery."
John looks down at his hands, feeling both flattered and chastised. They're quiet for a moment and John tries to come up with a clever way to keep her talking about Sherlock, but opts for straightforwardness.
John pressed his forehead against the tile wall in his shower and allowed the warm water to wash away his tears.
Suddenly John's clarity allowed him to recognize three inviolable truths: that he loved Sherlock; Sherlock loved him; and today Sherlock
"Sher—"
And then, out of the blue, Sherlock realized he was in love, with no idea how it had happened!
why John was so worried. A witness or new evidence wouldn't have required the whole team, and John had learned within days of meeting Sherlock that he couldn't count on him staying with Greg's lot. In fact, Sherlock habitually ran off without them in the hopes of getting there before they did. Once the police showed up, Sherlock had told him, the perpetrators would clam up, and then Sherlock was denied the very thing he was chasing—the

was I this time around?"
"I don't know," Sherlock snapped, then stood up, anxiety a weight in his stomach and a lump in his throat.
John stares at Sherlock, wide-eyed. His erection, which had begun to wilt, starts to plump back up again. When spoken in Sherlock's devastatingly sexy voice, the words
"Oh, ha ha," Sherlock deadpanned. "Are you going to keep making little snarky comments or do you want to hear this story? After all, you're the one who asked for it."
The woman who was last to speak sat down and although Sherlock stood up automatically, he found that everything he'd planned to say had disappeared and the sudden silence flustered him. His face turned red and he tried again, but what came out of his mouth when he opened it was—
