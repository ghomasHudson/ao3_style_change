He looked at her, but didn’t say anything, cut off by the sound of the computer beeping its result, and he turned to that instead of the truth in her words, and the meaning they held for Molly
“On the contrary, it wasn’t into recently that marriages shifted from convenience to sentiment.”
“What’s got you all worked up, then? A bit jealous?” Sally smirked, as if her accusation was well founded, the hand she had playfully rested on John’s shoulder twisted possessively
“While she hides hers away, you wear your heart on your sleeve”
“Well” Molly sighed, tucking a loose strand behind her ear, her eyes moving back to the now long closed doors of the morgue with a pining kind of awe, as if she could still see Sherlock, “Her work is very lucky”

Only five more chapters to go...
“Checking muscle mass?” he asked playfully
Then, came in Mike, oh Mike, an old friend he knew before he even enlisted, the once fit man was now round and jolly, a smile plastered on his face when he greeted John too enthusiastically, reminding the doctor of the kind of man he’d once been
“You call being hogtied and nearly chocked to death in control?!”
Consciously, Sherlock made a move to appear to be adjusting her scarf, and one pale finger pressed to the purple mark hidden there beneath, where John’s mouth had been the night before, grounding herself in that little piece of data, proof that John was completely satisfied
And with this, ends my longest (and most well received) fic I've ever written
“Oh, good, you’re awake. What’s your current weight and how often do you perform physical activities outside of the work and coitus?”
“Irene Adler. It’s been weighing on your mind for quite some time, but you never asked in fear of crossing some nonexistent line” she said, before raising an eyebrow “Or perhaps you’re hesitant because I’m a woman”
(See the end of the chapter for
It was half mumbled under her breath, and he wasn’t even sure he’d heard her correctly
“Don’t try to analyze things, John, you’re lacking the proper skill level” Sherlock said after a pause, turning slightly so she laid on her side, back to the cushions and one arm draping off the sofa, hanging near his shoulder
But then some guy, someone who didn’t matter at all to the case, went on the hunt, his vision tunneling in on Sherlock from where she was, and he approached, without any shame, his pasty fingers gripping her hips like he had every right to, and brought his crotch to grind against her back
It all began a few short weeks after her and John started their relationship, when he came home particularly flustered, cheeks slightly flushed, hair disarrayed from constant fingers through it, eyes darting off everywhere to avoid looking at her, embarrassed
Soon she was rolling into him, soft circle movements with her hips as she tightened her hold on his hair, pulling until it almost felt painful, but he couldn’t careless, his own hips rutting into the mattress to relieve some of the pressure building inside his shaft, something that didn’t escape her notice, even with her eyes closed, and the noise of his mouth working
The way the two women interacted, he sometimes wondered if he should look away from the sparks in their gazes and the obvious tension so thick he could cut it
“Stop it! You’ve been hovering over me for the past few weeks and it’s insufferable!” She yelled, her fingers slipping and smearing important blood samples together, effectively ruining her experiment
I don't know the English or how they treat abortion, but in America it's still pretty controversial, so if this doesn't make sense to those overseas, my bad, ig
“John” she repeated, ducking her head to meet his downcast eyes and there it was again, his blinding fury coming up and swallowing him whole as she looked at him like he was the one being completely insane, like he was the one with no sense

He walked over to her, and instantly she moved her legs, allowing him to sit at the end of the couch
“Isn’t that what you’re using to keep Mycroft out of the flat?” John asked with a quirk of his brow
She cracked one eye open to read her brother’s expression, surprised to find concern there, not forced or faked, nor placed there for appearances, but pure, plain, and simple
He didn’t dare hide it
He kissed her again, effectively silencing her as his right hand yanked at her nightshirt, causing two buttons to pop and roll onto the floor, his left hand running down the length of her shoulder to her arm, wrist, then digging his thumb into the pulse point there, feeling it drum wildly under his touch
“She does you…” Molly paused, worrying her bottom lip between her teeth as if debating whether or not to continue. “…And that woman, the one with the smashed up face?” she finished after a pause
Look at me, actually doing my update, if a lil late, but still technically the second Saturday (it's 11:25pm where I am), so yay
John nodded his head towards the door when Sherlock squeezed her eyes shut at the next contraction, a subtle gesture, but firm in it’s own way, a request that wasn’t to be ignored
He ran his hands through his hair, frustrated in more ways than one, his erection half flagged and his anatomy feeling particularly heavy
Strong hands swept beneath her knees, pulling them up and apart so her back hit the wall behind her, knocking the breath from her lungs as she wrapped her seemingly endless legs around him, his arousal pressed directly against her own, and with a subtle thrust, the friction had them both let out a startled moan
“Sherlock, you’re fine, you’ll be fine” John whispered sweet nothings over and over as the time between the contractions decreased at a steady pace
Finally, his tongue traced her bottom lip, dipping in to play with hers in a way that felt sweeter than anything, and of all the lovers of the past, she never felt something quite like it

“John”
He was so damn close! So close to a climax that didn’t involve his own hand, but it never seemed to be enough
“John!” Lestrade said when he finally reached him, gripping his wrist roughly to keep him from raining down yet another punch, the man’s forearms covering his face in a pathetic attempt to stop the attack “Enough! Christ!”
She laughed, LAUGHED, and he was struck with both the desire to kick her out of his bed, and lay her down and unwrap her on it
Anyways, comment if you like the story thus far, I love reading what you have to say
“It doesn’t make it any less true. The very thought of my brother raises my blood pressure” Sherlock said, and John laughed his hand remaining where it was for the better part of the evening
“Sally’ll take care of it, get back into position” He heard Lestrade say, and John realized he had walked a few feet forward in their direction
Gradually, it became more frequent, and whenever his hands weren’t occupied, he’d twirl the piece of jewelry, over and over and over. It was distracting, and, God help her, worrying
“You’re heterosexual, but once your sister came out you became curious, along with being at war with almost strictly men, you experimented only to not find it to your liking. You prefer to be in a relationship before engaging others in intercourse but you’re no stranger to one-night stands. Your experience with pregnancy scares, along with being a doctor, makes you a fan of condoms, and as a result you have no current STD’s and plan to keep it that way, I assume?” she spoke with her usual rush “Should I continue or would you like to ask your questions now?”
And after that first night, it seemed like the focus that once was left to rot away with boredom between cases was instead switched to John with a fiery intensity
He supposed he shouldn’t be surprised with the kind of self-preservation she’d shown in the past but he still couldn’t believe her complete lack of care, her indifference towards her own safety
It was obvious his excuse was half assed at best, the only reason he cleared the hospital floor and flooded it with the best maternity doctors in all of England was because he was worried about Sherlock, afraid of anything and everything that could possibly go wrong
He couldn’t argue with that, it was obvious by her family’s reaction they were expecting someone vastly different
“Just…why?”
“Obviously” she rolled her eyes
“Sherlock…” He breathed, slipping his hands into hers, intertwining their fingers. Her legs wrapped around his body, heels digging into his lower back but he kept the same agonizingly slow pace, moving so slowly, teasingly, until she was writhing underneath him, panting and on the verge of begging
“Married to her work,” he said simply
Mycroft came in last, almost hesitantly, the drama of delivery seeming to shake his confidence just a bit, as it should, seeing as how Sherlock nearly hit him with a glass vase
“Hardly” she rolled her eyes “your door was unlocked and it is well passed noon”
He had to choose, that was obvious. The work, or his love life
She looked his way from where she was straddling the man’s back and smiled, and in that moment he felt such hot white fury built in him because how DARE she grin? How dare she do that to him? Risk her life for the sake of closing a case.
Mycroft really was the smarter Holmes
“I thought you said 221b Baker Street.”
Sherlock cleared his throat, the red in his face reaching down to the bit of skin exposed on his chest. “Cab, then? I'm sure Lestrade would let it slip if the police came, but we already agreed to not end another night drinking in jail, I believe.”
“Anyway- he's making his way back now, he's a very lucky man.” the stranger said with a wink as he turned to walk away.
“Out?”
“Do not fuck with my friend- I will kill you and he will hide your body where no one can find it.”
He stared a few more seconds before responding, “Jealous?”
Sherlock took a sip of the wine and turned to survey the pub. It was averagely loud, with a dance floor and a small area to the side with tall tables set with three chairs to each. Only one table of the six seemed to be in use, there were at least 11 people on the dance floor, and 7 at the bar.
He handed john a mug of hot tea with an awkward smile and handed Rosie her bottle, which she took with a satisfied coo.
Sherlock stood from the couch, his belt and top button of his trousers undone and shirt left behind. “Right, then, formula.”
“Had sex? Were gay? Yes to both, obvious. Anyway, formula.” he started towards the kitchen.
“No, I’m sor-” John was abruptly cut off by an ice cube hitting him in the back of the head.
“He threw a peanut at you!” he announced incredulously to John as John returned, drinks in hand. “being kids, Sherlock, it's fine. I've had worse things thrown at me when I'm on cases with you.” he laughed.
“Form- wait, no, what were you doing?”
Sherlock waited until John was out of site before turning to the cabbie.
Sherlock stared at John, his icy eyes piercing and unreadable.
“It’s only 7:30, I've got to get her home for a bath, and I work in the morning.”
“Well, yes, I suppose we might as well, then…”
“‘course.”
“it is a nice camera.” he said with a sly smile.
One of those Sherlock-less nights he woke up from a particularly bad nightmare, tangled in blankets and sweating. After twenty minutes of tossing and turning he decided to go down to the all too quiet kitchen and make himself some tea. He took the cuppa over to his chair and took out his phone to check his blog, but ended up scrolling through his old pictures instead.
“I'm Collin, I'm visiting from out of town- you guys have some great pubs, and,” he deliberately looked Sherlock up and down, “some great sites.”
“No, Sherlock. It's not that either…” Sherlock tries to read John's face but was unable to figure out what was wrong. “I don’t know.”
“Don’t worry, John, she's an angel.” Ms. Hudson responded lovingly.
“Tea is on the counter.”
“You're right, John.” he responded, his voice raspy and barely above a whisper. “You could never be more… because I know I'll never be enough. I know I'm a ridiculous man, I am rude and hurtful and never tell you what I'm doing…”
“I get it, I'm fine, Sherlock.”
“As a substitute for feeling sad, I know.”
“I've always loved you, John.” Sherlock took a step forward and wrapped his arms around John, burying his face in the shorter man's shoulder. “Since you first walked in at Bart’s.”
“Sherlock? You said your name was William…”
-----------
Sherlock didn’t leave Baker street a lot but when he did John could swear his nightmares were worse. Without his madman of a flatmate home he didn't get the fix he needed to keep the nightmares at bay.
Sherlock's hands gracefully slipped from John's shoulders and down his chest to wrap around the small of his back and pulled him closer.
Sherlock was his fourth… fifth, drink in? He had this all planned out to not get too drunk, but he was having trouble keeping the data straight in his head, and it was far too loud and idiot filled of a bar to really concentrate on his mind palace. He took comfort in John's smiling face. He was up at the bar again, laughing with the bartender as he got another round for them. He watched him grab the drinks and start walking back towards Sherlock when a young kid, maybe 20, threw a peanut at John. It was innocent enough, a group of 20 somethings just messing around, but Sherlock suddenly felt enraged.
………..
“Up early, when you're fine you sleep late, sometimes too late, you saw your therapist yesterday, third week in a row-”
John frowned.
Must be his last night in town.  Sherlock thought, but he didn’t mind. He rather enjoyed the eager ones, they hated small talk almost as much as he did.
That night he couldn’t sleep, so after Mary dozed off he took out his phone and took a deep breath before opening the gallery. He was surprised to see the latest picture. It was him and Sherlock walking side by side. Mary must have taken in between the two restaurants.
Sherlock didn’t say a word, he just stared at John, who had now, regrettably, taken a step back.
“What, you didn’t deduce that?”
“Awe, your boyfriend here to save you?” Brian taunted, but was immediately shut up by John, who grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back.
“Drunken one night stand.” Sherlock suggested.
Sherlock kissed back, pulling him close once again and revelling in John's warmth.
They ran about a block and a half and turned into an alley, before stopping to breath between hysterical laughter.
“Normal is boring.” Sherlock responded with a wide smile.
John sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Right, I don't want to keep Rosie up any longer, I suppose I'll stay.”
“of the man you were with…”
“I had Molly do the chemistry that time, I will do it myself this time, however tedious, I am sure I'll get better results.”
Mary occasionally joked about how his phone was filled with pictures of Sherlock and not her, but she also secretly found it endearing. After he found out she was an assassin it was a relief that his phone was filled with Sherlock and murders and not her, but the night she died he looked back in his phone to distract himself and try and sleep, but found only those selfies from when they were dating, some photos Sherlock’s mother insisted on taking on Christmas, and one picture of them and Rosie, which resulted in him feeling even worse, and terribly guilty.
“Well, it is, technically-”
He knew he was in a dangerous business, but John had thought of Sherlock as indestructible. He seemed so above it all. He drove John insane, but without his madman his life was so empty. Sherlock had been his life and his best friend.
“I thought it was fairly obvious.”
Sherlock couldn't resist- didn't want to resist, he wanted this for so long. His soldier's hands in his hair, lips pressed together, bodies so close. He moaned as John slid his leg between his thighs.
“John…”
John pulled Sherlock into a kiss, he had been waiting so long, he was not going to wait a moment longer.
“Experiment, I needed the cabinet- tea was in the way.”
“Lestrade?” John asked, clearing his throat.
“2...1…” Sherlock slurred.
“Fuck” he mumbled soft enough that she wouldn't hear. “I meant to get more today but got distracted by the case.”
“You…”
Sherlock smiled, “It would have been, but I brought the most attractive soldier with me.”
“Fuck, Sherlock. Not as a doctor, let me see as a friend, or….” he trailed off. What was he? Friends seemed like the wrong term considering they're current position.
“No, no, I'm not- I.” John stopped for a moment to collect himself, straightening his shoulders and clenching the fist that wasn't momentarily holding Rosie, “I just came to see if you had extra formula for Rosie, Sherlock, it seems I ran out.”
“I would know if you were trying to poison me.” Sherlock responded expressionlessly.
“No cases?”
“I know 11 completely untraceable poisons and 127 places within a 100 mile radius that no one will ever find you.” Sherlock’s voice was low and serious.
“No, I don't mean in a bad way- it's just a joke Sherlock, I like getting things thrown at me-” John paused. That didn't come out as he had meant.
“Oh, right, you are a doctor, I understand your concern, but I did have the proper materials for safe-”
Sherlock picked up his shirt and coat and headed to his room. He hadn't meant for John to catch him in such a compromising position,  but he was mostly just relieved that it didn't scare him away. He needed John more than he wanted to admit.
The cab pulled into the street and John lay his head on Sherlock's shoulder. It felt so natural to be so close to him. He reached over and set his hand softly atop his detective’s long pale fingers, and they sat like that in a comfortable drunken silence for the rest if the ride home.
“Oh, shit. I didn't know he was taken, I swear.” Collin said nervously clambering off of Sherlock.
Sherlock just started, blinking.
Nothing.
Sherlock had only finished his one glass of wine before Collin asked if he wanted to go somewhere less public.
“Of course I love you, John, I killed a man for you, I would kill myself for you, and nearly have. I feel like that much is obvious. I've told you before that it's always you, that you keep me right, because it is always you.”
Sherlock simply hummed in response, pulling him towards the couch.
The shorter man didn’t stop. He tugged slightly at Sherlock's curls, exposing that beautiful pale neck flushed with red.
“Exactly, you're a doctor. So you should understand that it's nothing.”
the door.
John turned around to say something, but Sherlock was already out of his chair and making his way over to the table of 20-somethings, all grace and curls and eyes like daggers. John felt a shiver go through him and settle low in his belly.
He started looking back at the other pictures and realized that Sherlock didn’t make that expression in any pictures except the ones of them at Angelo’s. His heart sped up at the thought that Sherlock saved that expression solely for him, and it dissipated his anger a bit.
The man took off around a street corner, but when Sherlock and John reached him he was already on the ground, tackled by Lestrade.
John sighed, looking away to try and conceal his smirk. Sherlock smiled in return.
“Joh-” John cut him off with a kiss, biting Sherlock's soft lower lip, begging to be let in for more.
“Obviously.”
“Nothing important.” Sherlock responded in an attempt to change the subject.
“It's not, I have a thing for soldiers.”
“You're upset. Why? We were still mostly clothed when you walked in-”
“No, no- Sherlock- I know you tried to get yourself killed by that serial killer because you were trying to save me, and I know shooting yourself was the only way out of that death maze… and you know I am not good at this- this stuff, these talks. And I did do wrong, I have literally punched you multiple times. I still really hate that you had to pretend to die and leave me broken hearted and alone, but I know Moriarty threatened me, Molly told me. And I hate that you overdosed after Magnussen-”
“Cab will be here in thirty minutes, Rosie is already with Ms. Hudson.” Sherlock announced, eyes still closed.
………...
“Old viking tradition. The harder you hit the glass against the other the better. It was a sign of trust- your drink would spill into theirs and vice versa, that way you know it's not poisoned.”
“No, Sherlock, we are not doing this again.”
“I don’t always get the things you do, but… I- fuck, for some reason- I love you, Sherlock. I fucking love you, you bloody git. I told you once that you should text the woman back because that chance would be gone before you know it, but I was hoping you'd choose me- I was hoping you'd say something then. Of course you deserve me. I am the same as you, I'm just as lost and friendless… and I feel less lost with you, okay?”
Surely Sherlock wouldn't mind them stopping by.
“Leave him alone, Brian, he seems serious.” Another boy said to no avail.
“221B” John corrected, excited he had remembered what had slipped Sherlock's mind.
They just stood like that for a few seconds, John's hand still in the air and Sherlock's face turned away, eyes covered by his now messy curls.
“At least try and get some sleep and eat something before we go out tonight, Sherlock, I know you're a lightweight and I don't want to wake up to Greg screaming again.” John smirked as he went to tend to his daughter.
“Ms. Hudson already agreed.”
John leaned up and kissed Sherlock softly, cherishing it now that he was feeling more sober.
“Right, then- cheers,” John held up his glass, and Sherlock returned the gesture, clinking the glasses together.
“Didn't sleep?” John asked, although he already knew the answer.
Sherlock fumbled to unbutton Collin's shirt as Collin moved up to nibble his earlobe, but Sherlock's fingers froze halfway down. Collin looked at him, confused as to why he stopped and followed his gaze to look behind him.
“Yeah.” John responded, clearing his throat awkwardly as he reached to pick up the mobile from the floor.
◇◇◇◇◇
“The scars then, will you tell me what they're from?”
“Right, of course.”
Sherlock cleared his throat, “Hello, John.”
“Yes.”
So that's what he did. He didn’t have Sherlock's retentive memory or Mind Palace, but he had this camera, and he felt like he was getting quite good at taking pictures as he continued.
The first time John took a picture of Sherlock was mostly by accident. It happened while he was figuring out  the new smartphone Sherlock had bought him. Sherlock insisted he needed one because he texted too slow with his “terrible outdated piece of crap”. John protested that he was fine with the one he had, but gave up convincing Sherlock to take it back after Sherlock told him he had bought it on Mycroft's card and not his own
John made his way to his room to change and get ready, and returned ten minutes later wearing a pair of dark blue-black jeans and a grey button down shirt.
John lay in his bed after getting Rosie to sleep, but he wasn't tired yet.
John stood up and walked over to where Sherlock was looking into his microscope at the kitchen table. His detective looked up at him, a questioning look on his face. John smiled and leaned in, kissing him softly on the lips. Sherlock seemed shocked for a moment, but then started to kiss back, wrapping his arms around his favorite soldier’s waist.
“Right, then…”
“Yes, but they deserved it.” John laughed.
Sherlock’s smile faded to a cold empty look.
“But you always say you're not gay.”
“Fuck, Sherlock- I'm sorry, I'm still a little drunk… I just get pissed off-”
“Thanks for watching her, if she gives you any trouble just call.” John said, placing a soft kiss on her forehead before putting his coat on as well.
“Right, then, how'd that go?”
John bit his ear, knotting his fingers into those soft, dark curls.
John scoffed and brought Rosie to where Sherlock was making them both some tea and preparing her bottle, bouncing her on his hip to try and calm her down. Sherlock's pants were now buttoned and belt fastened, but he was still shirtless, John had to try hard not to stare, distracting himself with Rosie instead. Once he managed to calm Rosie enough he put her down in her chair. It was past her bedtime and she was going to be even more cranky soon.
He changed into his pajamas and threw on a robe. He thought he might as well distract himself with an experiment, otherwise he would keep thinking about John and that's what had gotten him into this mess in the first place.
Sherlock looked at John with a questioning I-thought-that-was-obvious face.
“Right, yeah, I'm bisexual, like I mentioned after the bar. But I never tried anything because you're you, you're ‘married to your work’, ‘high functioning sociopath’, and you told me you ‘sometime texted the woman’ whatever that means.”
………….
The man followed Sherlock’s gaze to John.
Sherlock watched him leave for a moment before looking down at the table where he had slyly left his number on a napkin. He quickly pocketed the napkin as John set the drinks down.
John pulled away breathlessly, “So, I hope you don’t mind sharing a bedroom, Rosie will need her own.”
◇◇◇◇◇
“No, John, no need to apologize. I understand that I have hurt you. It is only fair.”
Sherlock looked curiously at him.
“Told you they were fucking gay.” a voice called from the street at the end of the alley. Without a beat John pulled away from Sherlock's kiss, took his gun from his coat and pointed it at the group of boys.
Sherlock pressed his hands on John's lower back, bringing him closer. He couldn’t get close enough. He needed all of him.
John broke the silence, “I suppose I'm not much better… You have hurt me, a lot,” Sherlock flinched again, “but I guess I haven't been much better. I know I blamed you for Mary, and I hurt you time and time again…”
“You look lonely over here, want some company?”
“Home so early, again?” they heard from Ms. Hudson's door.
------------
It wasn’t until after Sherrinford that John he started up again. He had realized that he couldn’t afford his flat alone, and asked Sherlock if it could be possible to move back in to his old room.
“Your jaw- did he hurt you?” John asked once he could breathe again. He reached up to touch the red spot forming on Sherlock's chin.
Sherlock just stared, uncomprehending.
John sat in his chair one night after putting Rosie to bed and decided to check out the pictures Ms. Hudson had insisted on taking of himself, Sherlock, and Rosie. He chuckled at the first picture in which John was holding Rosie and Rosie was throwing a toy at Sherlock. The next one Sherlock was holding Rosie and looking over at John, who was smiling at the camera. Sherlock was making that same soft expression he had seen in the other pictures of them together.
“What was that about?” John asked looking in the direction of attractive grey haired man, a hint of jealousy well disguised in his voice.
“You… love me, too?”
He refused to get rid of the pictures, but it would be another year and 4 months before he would use the camera again.
“It’s fine,” John breathed out, “it’s fine if you don’t feel the same way.”
“I'm afraid I've caught all the fun criminals, that or they've all gone on holiday. London is nauseatingly quiet.”
“Hm, yes, I suppose. Why do you ask.”
John was a bit surprised at how receptive Sherlock was. They had never really talked about their respective sex lives, and John assumed Sherlock didn’t really have one. He was obviously wrong, this was no virgin kiss. It was taking a lot of effort to resist ripping off his clothes and taking him right now. He took one hand from Sherlock's neck and slid it down his chest to his waist band. He slipped his fingers under the detective’s shirt and onto his hip bone.
“Right, yes- I know what you were doing, but… I didn’t think you…”
-------------
“Not alone, waiting.” Sherlock replied, glancing over at the man. He was definitely not unattractive, only an inch or so shorter than Sherlock, grey and black hair styled to perfection, strong jawline, and impeccably dressed. The two top buttons on his shirt were undone, showing a hint of what Sherlock deduced was an impressive physique.
“Let him go, now.” John nearly screamed, his gun pointing at a bulky man with an arm around Sherlock's neck.
Brian took another drunken swing at Sherlock, this time just grazing his jaw. John took that moment to push the young man back.
Sherlock glanced at John as he walked in, holding his gaze for a moment. John was used to the way Sherlock looked at him- so intense with those oceanic eyes. Sherlock's gaze was only broken by the ding of his phone. Once, then again, then again.
“Important? We can go out another night.”
“John threatened some university student with a gun.” Sherlock slurred.
“I'm fine, I'm quite aware that you enjoy things being thrown at you,” Sherlock replied.  He could hear the slur in his own words, his machine of a brain was running slow.
“I made sure you didn't. I caused you so much pain those years, I let you mourn for me… I didn't want to worry you more than I had. I know I am good at keeping sentiment out of my work, but Magnussen was right, you are my weakness, you always are.”
“I had to solve that old case for Mor-”
“So, you do this often then? Invite strangers over for a shag? You have a tinder or something?”
Sherlock found a table while John ordered drinks. John talked him out of the beakers this time- but he had redone the data around 16 oz servings while John was at work.
“One night… that’s what this is?”
John looked up at the scars on Sherlock’s back. He had seen them before, but they were still quite a shocking sight. Sherlock twirled around and caught John staring at him.
John saw the swing and decided that he should probably stop this before it got worse.
Sherlock glanced at his phone, humming in response.
There were quite a few pictures from the wedding. His favorites were one terrible selfie he insisted on taking with Sherlock and one of Sherlock playing the violin for his and Mary’s first dance that Archie had taken. John had given Archie the task of taking some pictures of the reception on John’s own phone. But because Archie is a just a kid John found that aside from three pictures of the actual reception he had to go through and get rid of at least 30 random ridiculous selfies of Archie himself after thoughtfully sending some of the better ones to Archie’s mother.
“Never important. Five, no three. They can handle it. Anyway- cab is here.”
John chuckled, pulling away from the hug to look at Sherlock's face.
“Look at the way he holds himself- that's no civilian stance.” the man chuckled at the slight hint of intrigue on Sherlock's face.
“Evening.” Sherlock responded nonchalantly handing him his debit card.
“It's not that, Sherlock-”
Sherlock didn’t mind the change of plans at all, tea could wait.
“Yeah… well there's something I wanted to talk to you about…”
“Nice timing, Greg.” John said, trying to catch his breath.
John planned on using the camera the night of his engagement, but of course that was interrupted by Sherlock’s untimely return. He almost left his phone at the restaurant after nearly killing his idiot detective, but thankfully Mary had grabbed it and his coat before they headed out
John hummed in response, taking his laptop off the table next to him and setting it in his lap. As much as he craved excitement, he could do without one of Sherlock’s tantrums, he had a real baby to take care of.
“Well, it would be pointless for you to leave now. There is an extra crib up in your old room, stay the night, I can watch Rosie while you're at work.”
“Time to go.” John said, grabbing a dazed Sherlock's arm before running towards the back exit.
“Not for him.” he laughed as he handcuffed the man on the ground, “you two look exhausted, I'll call you in the next few days for a report, get yourselves home.”
Sherlock stood in a one fluid motion and headed towards the door, John followed behind him.
“Sherlock!”
“They could have hurt you, John.”
He fell asleep mentally thanking Mary for taking a picture to remind him how much he loved and had missed his best friend.
“Obviously, experiment, like I said.” Sherlock replied nonchalantly, a bored look on his face.
Sherlock listened. He didn't want John to leave again.
He checked Rosie's crib to find her still sleeping softly before heading down the stairs.
He moaned in return, storing those words in his mind palace for later.
Sherlock suggested his flat, and they were making out in the back of a cab within 5 minutes of leaving the bar.
“I was supposed to, what? Take that as a confession?”
Office worker, single, from out of town, here on holiday, has one cat.
“God, Sherlock, you're so beautiful.”
Sherlock leaned down and kissed rosie on the head, “Behave, Watson, although according to the behavioral patterns of your parents, I doubt you will.”
The man obliged, but took off running. Sherlock took a second to recover before bolting after him, John following close behind.
“Can't seem to stay out of fights when I'm with you.”
“I changed my mind.”
“You have done nothing wrong, John-”
“Right. I could have guessed, I suppose that was “obvious”.”
They made their way towards the street, Sherlock's usually graceful gait was tinged with a drunkenness that made John smile.
The group ran as fast as they could down the street.
-----------
“Boring. Didn't work.”
Sherlock blinked rapidly.
Sherlock had barely had time to shut the door behind them before John had him pushed against the wall, planting soft kisses on his pale neck.
“Bloody hell, I could fuck you all night.” Collin breathed as he nibbled at Sherlock's neck and started to unbutton his shirt.
“I know what they are, I am a doctor, so let me see.” John was almost yelling, suddenly feeling quite a bit more sober.
“You do remember what happened on my stag night, don't you? Or did you delete that?”
He pulled away from Sherlock's neck and looked up in shock at his face.
John smiled. Sherlock continued to surprise him with his treatment of Rosie. He could see he loved her as much as John.
He had nothing to hide from the older Holmes, though, like the man said, he wore his heart on his sleeve, his emotions left bare for the world to see, his intentions as clear as day.
With no constant texts from Sherlock, the night seemed to be headed in that direction, and having already explained the living situation, a little fib of Sherlock being a cousin thrown in, he saw no reason why tonight wouldn’t be the end to his too long dry spell
From across the room, the sound of a beep made itself known, and Sherlock held out her hand, expectantly
He puffed out his cheeks, something he always did when he was biting back a retort he knew would be frowned upon, a habit that reminded John so much of his sister when she was younger. Bubbled mouths could gather no foots, his mother used to say. But it was obvious Junior wasn’t exactly fond of being ‘different’, though both his parents and uncle had tried to repeatedly tell him it was a good thing to be special
His baby’s healthy cry
He just needed a reminder, a slap in the face to say that no matter how beautiful, how within arms reach she was, she was still thousands of miles away, in a different world all together, the self proclaimed sociopath seemed more like a lion among domestic cats than any normal human in the basic population

Sherlock didn’t reply to his last comment, and breathing out a shaky sigh, he contemplated just dropping the subject, it would certainly be easier
“I also have a husband” Sherlock pointed out, smirking just slightly at John’s blush. They’d done just a bout everything in the bedroom imaginable, had a child, and been parents together, yet the title still seemed to fluster him
“You’re really okay with this?” Sally asked, in disbelief, looking at John like she expected him to object
She hated it, but agreed it was better than nothing
How long has she been here?
John looked up at that, giving him a confused look
He smiled, shoving his keys, mobile, and wallet into his pocket before happily padding down the stairs
Birth control was never something she regularly practiced, and the pullout method was hardly scientific; combined with her high fertility inherited from her grandmother, who had 12 kids of her own.

He may not be a genius like her, but this was something in which he had experience. He didn’t get the nickname 3 content Watson by being shy, and with a quick dart of his tongue he lapped all coherent thoughts right out of her mind, leaving her trembling, and moaning, and pressing fingers into his scalp, half massaging, half holding
“In all likelihood I will not be sleeping tonight” she said “if you’re that against the idea of us sharing a bed then I’ll take the couch”
His eyes snapped open in alarm, only to find his flatmate, fully clothed in one of her usual suits, straddling his waist, her arse only a few inches from his morning wood, looking as calm as ever as her eyes followed her fingers down his frame
Darting her silver eyes over her figure, Sherlock would be lying to say she wasn’t surprised
“We?”
Even though being physical with Sherlock was mind blowing, amazing, the most fantastic sex he’d ever had, something he loved so very much, he knew deep down that if she didn’t want it, if she was only interested in what they were doing, soft cuddling, light kisses, sharing stories of pasts and running around London catching bad guys, he’d be okay with that. Because he was lucky enough to call this mad, crazed, unbelievable genius his, his wife, his partner, his whole damn world
“He touched Sherlock!”
Yet, would it get in the way of work? Certainly John wouldn’t want her to stay at home to raise it, she’d go mad with boredom. Was it possible for him to stay behind? He seemed like the man that would want at least one parent home to look after the child’s welfare.
“Your relationship with Sherlock has had…an interesting development” He paced evenly, back and forth with two even steps each time, umbrella taping the dirtied floor of the abandoned warehouse
“It’s not just you anymore, Sherlock!” John replied harshly, crossing his arms with a look that spoke his refusal to back down
She blamed herself
Loose-leaf tea is best -SH
“When I took it…the world was quite, and every damn little detail about a person didn’t scream for attention”
“Mycroft assigned a tutor to me as a child” she started after a rather long pause, as if debating whether or not to tell him, and he shifted a bit forward in his seat. It was rare of her to discuss her past at all, and he’d be damned if he would miss a single word she uttered. “He had said a proper lady needed fine skills in at least one classical instrument”
It wasn’t as if this was something he wasn’t used to, of course, it happened before. More often than not did he and Sherlock pose as a couple to more easily blend into a crowd.
John gave a weak smile; his hand hesitantly hovering near, as if he still felt he needed to ask for permission to feel the child’s kicks even after all the places those hands had been on her before her pregnancy.
“So you asked me because I’m not married?”
Until now, it seemed
It wasn’t anything new, of course, he dealt with the same behavior before, only now she had a reason to make him drop everything and come to her. Taking full control of his time, his social life, and just his life in general, becoming the sun in which he revolved around
It was bad enough that he was sharing a flat with a woman, or that half of London already thought they were shagging by ‘reading in between the lines’ of his blog updates, but if she texted, phoned, or just outright walked in on his dates when she felt like it, hell, he was never going to get laid
“Height isn’t the size that matters, love”
Maybe one day, the work would lose it’s appeal, and running around London with Sherlock wouldn’t seem so grand, then he could settle down with a nice girl, have a child, or two or three, and live a comfortable, peaceful existence, but that day wasn’t today, nor did it seem to be in the immediate future
“Hmm, and what would you recommend for a speedy recovery, Doctor?” she asked, sitting up a bit more and resting her chin to her palm
Ms. Hudson picked up on it immediately, and carefully hurried to his side, offering Junior up with a slight extending of her arms
John, against his better judgment, fetched the mobile and returned it to Sherlock’s slender fingers, watching her with a half smile as she plucked away at the keys quickly, a smile breaking out across her face, and she launched off the couch to run into her room
“Lestrade?” Junior asked, his tiny fist gripping the end of her coat
for updates on what's up with my life or my
“Oh, hush, dear, you only get married once!” Ms. Hudson shook her head, her hands smoothing out the wrinkles in Sherlock’s veil
When it was all over, John closed the door to their flat, sighing and leaning against it
“That’s good, seeing as you’re here, and not there. At least John car-”
“Hmm…yes…John is perfect”
“Don’t make me wait” she demanded, and any logical thought fled his mind
Anger, or disappointment, perhaps an even mix of the two
The only people presenting for her were her parents, and Mycroft.
He didn’t bother asking how she knew that that was the only place he could imagine
John didn’t move, giving her completely control, deciding how hard, how fast, and if she chose to stop, he wouldn’t protest.
I'm ignoring NaNoWriMo cause it's been to days and I got 1k written barely, but y'all can read what I have so far if you're interested, message me on my
Obviously the hard flooring wasn’t the best place for a nap, especially not with his shoulder
She was vaguely aware of John finally moving, thrusting up into her, his movements at first even and quick, before becoming hectic as his climax built in the base of his spine
“It’s fine” John grinned “I’ve got all day, after all”
She paused, her eyes taking on a far away look she got whenever she was thinking, going through different responses and their possible outcomes
And here's a drawing of Sherlock Holmes in John's boxers drawn by yours truly:
“You prevented a scene,” Sherlock said as she left the restroom, in her button up silk shirt and bottoms, towel drying her wet hair as the waves gradually became curlier
Sherlock was just surprised John himself didn’t realize
The bells rung just then
John, after hours of temper tantrums and daylong sulks, finally managed to convince her of continuing the work from the comfort of their flat. He’d video chat, send photos, and write down detailed descriptions of the crime scene for Sherlock to inspect without lifting a finger
“Will you tell me how the case goes during dinner, Mother?”
The first challenge he received, and he didn’t know how to handle it, so he stumbled over his words for a bit, opening and closing his mouth a few times before finally settling on telling Irene what mattered most, that she needed to let Sherlock know
John woke up from a familiar feeling; feminine fingers running their way down his chest and stomach, the lazy caresses of the after sex morning, sometimes leading to more, sometimes just a good snogging session
The restaurant in question was bright, full and surprisingly quiet for such a crowded business. The air was full of class and judgment found in those with well-lined wallets. High-class silverware lined expensive tableclothes, and a scan of the place revealed their intended target and John.
“Oh, sod off” he replied, and they both giggled

In reality, I get busy with doctors and shit, and my daughter's birthday is in less than a month so planning her party is also stressful..
“What?” They all asked in union, even Anderson turned to join the conversation, all puzzled expressions that reminded Sherlock why she was putting off telling anyone in the first place. If they only observed they would’ve noticed sooner. She’d been eating regularly, gone up a cup size, and put on at least 10 pounds in the past 2 months
Sherlock lied down, propping herself on her elbow, her head in her hand “During family dinners, I’m to observe but not give voice. Every one of my family’s supposed ‘secrets’, Mycroft and I know them all, but pretending we don’t is part of playing the role” she sighed, rolling onto her back “It was much worse than I imagined. Had I known, I would have simply come alone again this year.”
“You’re hardly a difficult man to read”
(See the end of the chapter for
She’d go on cases, John stubbornly refusing to join her, taking time off the surgery to spend every waking moment with his son within arms reach, even going as far as placing a baby monitor in a plastic bag to hang in the shower
“You have found yourself in quiet the predicament, dear sister” he started, the handle of his umbrella gripped tighter than usual in his hand, the only tell sign of his emotions
It was her way of saying it, he knew for sure, and he couldn’t care less if in the next 30 years she still couldn’t speak them out loud, because those three little words hung at the end of sentences like these, were felt in every clinging grip and soft touch, heard in every breathy moan and half mumbled praises. The way she talked around it, but never actually said it, that was his proof, and it was all he truly needed. If she was never able to actually utter the simple phrase, he would be just fine with that, because he already knew what she was unable to say
“Perhaps they should make heels for men” she suggested, her eyes moving up and down his figure
“You were welcome to begin without me,” she answered, heading towards an area where two seats were free, across another empty as Mycroft moved to occupy it
He sighed, clearly relieved, but annoyed “then what are you on about?”
But at least this was something he was capable of
“She’s impatient.” John replied, shoving his mobile back into his trouser pocket “As always”
“No…I…I don’t want to know what you did when you were high” he said slowly, and Sherlock could see he was choosing his words carefully “I just wanted to know…to understand…why you started…”
“I’ve learned to ignore what wasn’t important, take in what was, and focus my attention on cases and further development of my mind palace. You have also proven to be a rather effective distraction” she gave a half smirk, and he laughed softly, muttering “Thanks” under his breath
Finally, he withdrew, trying not to shiver at the friction on his overly sensitive cock as she slowly ran her hands up his chest, before resting them on the start of his neck, a satisfied smile on her lips
If you wanna read what I've got done so far for NaNoWriMo, hmu on
“No” He replied sternly, folding his paper and setting it to the side, his arms crossing defiantly.
“I was already on my way home, there was no need” Sherlock replied, and bloody hell, was she blushing?
He didn’t say anything, and she took his silence as an invitation to continue
A shaking of her head allowed her hair to whip around, adding even more volume to it after an hour of vigorous sex, she knew her hair was as wild and suggestive as ever, giving her the effect she was going for
“Idiots” Junior mumbled, crossing his short arms over his chest
She leaned back in her chair, but her eyes didn’t come to meet his as they normally would, instead, she stayed quite, long enough that he shifted from foot to foot in uncomfortable silence
Even in her late 40’s, she still worked at the Yard, wore her favorite coat and her perfectly tailored suits. She’d be cruel to anyone she found annoying and she’d still dismiss clients with a flick of her wrist and a single muttered ‘dull’, but yet, she was still so very different than the woman he moved in with 13 years ago, from the woman that got pregnant 11 years ago, to the woman he married 10 years ago.
“Like hell you didn’t!”
He hung his jacket, and she shrugged off hers, the steady raise and fall of her chest slowly slowing, along with the burning itch that seemed to rise every time they were in a particularly dangerous case
The thought was cut short by the opening of the restroom door, and Sherlock smoothly slipped the test into the wrapping of a tampon, disposing of it in a nearby bin just in time to see Donovan coming in, looking flustered the second she saw Sherlock.
“It will help keep the liquid from pooling under your skin, and stop the swelling” he said calmly, his fingers working soft circles from her heels up “You’re lucky the blisters aren’t actually on the soles of your feet, but I can clean and wrap them when I’m done”
The words were harder to say than he imagined, even with practice, the speech where he told her she wasn’t tied down, where she could leave him behind like she always did, only this time he wouldn’t follow, if that’s what she wanted
“Did you…did you just compliment me?” Sally asked, one eyebrow raised
They stood; face-to-face, cramped into the tight confides of the dusty old wardrobe, hiding out from god knows what as Sherlock’s slender fingers covered his lips, effectively silencing his question before it was asked
The loud ‘Thud!’ of the ‘murder’ weapon hitting the floor made him flinch slightly, which Sherlock didn’t seem to notice
“Of course I know, but I can’t prove it just yet, I don’t want to leave this in the hands of Scotland Yard, too likely to be screwed up, and we cannot allow this man to walk free”
“J-John…” He cleared his throat, attempting to keep it from the squeak it was turning into “John is fine…”
The mother in her, no doubt
Sometimes he wished that Sherlock would actually express interest in men, women, anyone (other than fugitives of the British government or madmen with bombs) so that she could finally find someone, as irrational as that was, then he could easy and squash the little glimmer of unlabeled emotions that bubbled up whenever someone would mention what a cute couple they were
I'm also writing other Non Sherlock fics since I decided to pick up some abandoned fics
This time it was her that raised a questioning brow
She reached into his jeans pocket with ease, pulling out his mobile, pressing a few buttons before showing him the sent messages, the top of which was to Mycroft
With his lids getting heavy and the clock striking down way past the actual date, he gave a smile, stood and stretched, before making his way towards the stairs to his more
Of course he’d always been aware of her beauty, but, it seemed, this night, Sherlock was taking full advantage of her looks, bringing out each of her best features and emboldening them to the point it seemed unfair to every other woman on the planet that she even existed, having that appearance while never putting any effort in before, and the good doctor wondered how they were going to get through this ‘date’
She could never offer him normal, she could never become a homemaker, cooking, cleaning, and raising a child while John worked at the surgery and came home tired and blissful.
Her hand dropped
“Sherlock!” John repeated louder, through clenched teeth “Not good!” and she paused, glancing his way before blinking a few times, as if she hadn’t noticed she was about to start deducing her family’s lives in front of them
“Sherlock” John sighed, pushing on one of her socked feet, to which she let out an annoyed sound and pushed back, kicking the palm of his hand
“No, thank you, Ms. Hudson” He looked extremely uncomfortable, and John held back a laugh
“Would you prefer if I make the title of lovers official by offering intimacy?”
Filed away for further analysis
So he approached, heading towards the end of the couch were her feet reached to the other arm, noting that if it were he sprawled out about it, his legs wouldn’t take up the whole thing
It was one thing to think about it, but hearing Sherlock say it so casually, and quite loudly, caused a blush to creep up his neck and cover his face
"Do shut up, Olivia," Ichabod spat. Whipping his head to Irving, he said, "Fifty thousand and not a pound more!"
, he thought to himself.
"Really? You had someone hold my folks at gunpoint, Mycroft! You know, all I wanted was your help in getting me on the right path to pursue my career. I never thought that a simple visit to your house would result in my murdering Pontius Watson or being forced to reallocate myself and my parents to the home of a fucking nutcase! Mum is terrified of him, and so am I."
John watched his semi full lips move. Was he chewing gum? "Yes, I am."
with you people?"
John never should have pushed his father. If he'd pretended to be an obedient little Omega, Ichabod wouldn't have felt the need to punish his son by moving the wedding date forward. Now what was once an amusing, yet alarming situation has turned into a full on tragedy. He didn't know what he was supposed to do, but he knew that he couldn't go through with it. This whole marriage thing . . . it would destroy him. But how do you get out of something like this? What in the world could he possibly do to ensure that he remained single, regardless of the contract both families have put in place?
"Where does that leave me?"
How do you get an Alpha and an Omega who don't want love to mate?
"And just how much do you think he's worth?" Barnabas asked loudly, craning his head to better watch the Watson's.
Everyone in the room tensed at the sound of such a smooth and reptilian voice. With great reluctance, they all acknowledged the threatening presence of such an intimidating character as one would a snake: with caution.
despised to this day.
, John thought to himself. Out loud, he said, "Sure."
Except there wasn't one. Not the one John was expecting anyway. No, this one didn't involve physical violence. It was rather passive aggressive in nature, a rare thing for an Alpha, though Sherlock and his brother tended to fight that way. A silent battle was being waged in this room, challenged by Moriarty and accepted by John. The boy whose name John didn't know stood beside him. He could feel the kid's body tense, John's peripherals picking up on the slight tinge of weariness plaguing the poor Omega's features. Yes, the boy was definitely an Omega. John could sniff out his kind like nobody else. It was a shame that he allowed an Alpha to bully him in such a way. John and Greg really were alone with this Omegist thing, weren't they?
John couldn't begin to formulate the questions running through his mind following everything he'd just seen and heard. He wasn't sure who was on the phone with his father, or what exactly it was that this mystery man wanted with him, but one thing was for certain: he was dying to find out.
Wait, what? Of course he'll be involved in someone else's love life. He'll have a hand up every couple's skirt that features in this story. He's the main character, for God's sake. He's everywhere! Now, if you are quite done interrupting the narrator, we can now continue with the explanations . . .
Somehow, Greg doubted that.
As Mr. Holmes comforted his wife, the burly man from earlier was about to voice his displeasure with the couple when someone from behind him said, "Oh, for God's sake. Can we cut the dramatics and focus on the matter at hand, please? I'm missing my bridge game!"
"There's still hope," he heard from behind him. "I know it doesn't seem like it now, but maybe we're doing the best thing for everyone and we just don't know it yet. There's no need to worry your pretty little head over it just yet, hon. Everything will be just fine."
John walked inside with trepidation, something about the boy rubbing him the wrong way. This entire scene reeked of something sinister, leaving him to wonder if he'd knowingly walked right into the lion's den. He felt no comfort from the fact that Sherlock was somewhere close by. Alphas were of no use to an Omega when they were in peril. They were of no use to anyone at all, really. Not unless you were an Omega in heat who needed their knot.
At the blank faces staring back at him, Mycroft sighed as if he were patiently suffering fools. "Am I the only one around here with a brain? Nevermind. Do what you will, but when this whole thing blows up in your face, don't say I didn't warn you. And if you think you're going to come knocking on my door thinking Mycroft is gonna make everything all better then I strongly suggest you put that notion to bed this very instant. I've never been a shoulder to cry on and I don't intend to start now. Well, then. If you'll excuse me, I have some important matters to attend to."
"Ah, John! So lovely to have you in our home."
Barnabas turned to smile at his beautiful wife, feeling more optimistic by the second. "Yes. Yes, I'm sure it will, dear."
Refusing to voice his concern, Mycroft plastered a fake smile on his face and walked away, wiping it off the moment he stepped foot outside and noticed a boy leaving the Holmes residence, a boy with a face that displayed all of the man's problems on every surface of his skin.
This should have been the moment when John left his house and never looked back. Seeing this day from a future point in time, he knew that if he had stormed out the door right then and there, he'd have lived a different life than the one in his current possession. He would have lived with Greg until he was able to find his own place, finish school, and possibly become one of the most brilliant doctors this world has ever known.
As your trusty narrator stands in the middle of Ichabod's study, she-
John gulped. "W-why not?"
"Oh, I believe I do," Barnabas replied excitedly. "I finally do."
The Alpha in question, having realized he was probably showing something he desperately wanted to conceal, put a lid on whatever it was his Omega was observing and extinguished the fires of something remarkably akin to gentleness with one drop of icy liquid, leaving behind that familiar coldness John was becoming used to, much to the boy's chagrin.
Sherlock's mouth twitched in barely concealed amusement. "Yes."
Before going any further into the complexity of our prized couple, we must first take note of the events surrounding them at this particular time. While you may be shouting at your storyteller through whatever electronic device you are using to observe the brilliant narration put forth before your very eyes, it is highly recommended that you tap into whatever patience you possess and focus on the relationships outside of our Alpha and Omega. For you see, there comes a time in certain stories where the perspective of the narrator is needed so that you can process information necessary to understanding the bigger picture, a picture which, believe it or not, involves more than our main protagonist. Observe:
"Well, that's not gonna happen. On your dead grandfather's name, I swear to all that is holy, I will die before I allow you to corrupt this family with your Omegist view of life. I've had just about all I can take from you. I'm going to call our lawyer and set up the wedding for next weekend."
When the barrier between John and the inside of the house was removed, it took him a moment to realize he was staring into the face of a boy who couldn't be any older than sixteen, with hair the color of chestnut, the bangs of which fell down one side of his face in loose strands that he pushed back with his well manicured hands. His glossy hazel eyes carried a hint of gold surrounding the pupils, oval shapes framed by long, thick eyelashes that fluttered from the caress of the cold Autumn air. He was of medium build, skinny, but strong, with small ripples of muscles that twitched from the boy's obvious agitation at being interrupted from whatever he was doing before John came to the door. His attire consisted of torn up blue jeans, light brown boots and a tight white t-shirt that accentuated every bit of lean muscle he possessed, leaving John to wonder if his clothing carried an immoral purpose.
Sherlock stared at John for a long time. His face displayed no emotion that the Omega could see, but he kept on waiting for that other shoe to drop. It was only a matter of time now. John just wished he'd get it over with.
Mycroft smiled. "I have."
Sherlock stared at John, making his insides turn to jelly. "Whatever helps you sleep at night, brother mine."
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "You're enjoying this, aren't you?"
Murder. There was a murder in the family. John couldn't seem to wrap his brain around the bizarre scene before him. He didn't move. He didn't panic. He didn't scream to the heavens for help. All he did was stand there and-whether or not this made him a bad man, he had no idea-wonder just why in the hell he hadn't thought of doing that to the dumb bastard when he'd had the chance..
"My thoughts exactly."
"I do," Barnabas said sadly. "I know that, despite finding a mate, both parties need to allow it to happen for the bond to mean anything. An Alpha and an Omega can be destined for each other all they want, but if one doesn't acknowledge the pull they feel toward the other, they're both doomed. I wanted you two to grow up together, but certain circumstances prevented that from happening. I didn't want you or my boy to get hurt, so I was forced to keep you two apart until you were both old enough to fend for yourselves. Now I'm paying the price for it."
"Famished," the older man replied happily. "Will the Omega be joining us?"
"That's none of your concern," Mycroft replied tiredly. "Just . . . make sure he's safe. If you care about your friend, it has to be this way. Now, are you going to help me convince Ichabod or not?"
John frowned. ABO University was a school that allowed students of any dynamic to attend, be it Alpha, Omega, or Beta. Coincidentally, they had the best classes in criminology, psychology, and sociology, leading to the brightest and the most ambitious of students leaving school to become the best detectives in the country. Greg's father, Monty, had graduated from that school, and was one of the most revered-and retired-detective inspectors to ever grace London. He saw things, not in the same way Sherlock did, but close enough that everybody respected him almost to the same extent they obviously respected John's infuriating Alpha, who'd made a name for himself with the help of his brilliant mind and brilliant sibling. Not that John had done his research on the other boy or anything. That, of course, would have implied that he cared.
"Then how can you be so sure?"
"Oh my god," Ingrid screamed. "What in the wo-Pontius? Pontius?!"
"John?"
you and
Angry tones started to fill the Watson household. John sat and listened without saying a word, sipping from his wine glass without a care in the world. It wasn't that he didn't care about his family . . . he just didn't care about his family. They could scream and yell all they wanted. In the end, everyone in that room had a hand in the ridiculous marriage that he was being forced into, and as far as he was concerned, they could all rip each other to shreds until the cows came home. The only thing he wanted in return was a promise from the Almighty himself that memories of their existence would never come back to darken his days again.
"I am getting sick and tired of all this noise," he whispered, looking around the room with what must have been a frightening expression, considering the terror present on everyone's faces."I have been hearing this incoherent babbling since the day I was born. Between the two of you, it's like I have stupid in stereo and my poor ears need a fucking break."
The fact that such an event took place on the very day that the adult version of their "play date" was about to . . . take place, could be seen as either fate, or a practical joke done by the most comedic of gods. No matter the reason, this day would always be an important one for both the boys and the reader, as this marks the beginning of the "Johnlock" relationship; in the past, as well as the present.
Regretfully, the narrator is now going to have to withdraw from the storytelling and allow John's thoughts to explain what is currently happening in the story for you, as her ego and bum are hurting too much to go on. We shall meet again, reader. Until then, enjoy the show, and may you be blessed with better coördination than that of . . . well, you get the picture.
, John thought disdainfully.
Seriously, I'm wonderful. Why am I not famous?
Rush of adrenaline and testosterone didn’t mix too well, and he saw Sherlock’s eyes widen in surprise as a look of pure horror etched his own features
John was taking her apart more ways than one, and she didn’t know how to handle it
Only two more chapters after this
Sally’s hands immediately went to where his were moments before, tightening and pulling Sherlock a fraction of a step closer to her, laying claim, which John was grateful for in ways he couldn’t put into words
“So” Sherlock replied, clearly annoyed
“Nonsense, there is no such thing. Only obsession and the need to control those closest to you”
When he opened the door he was greeted with the usual sight, Sherlock lying across the sofa, reading over a file and not bothering to look up to acknowledge him
This was just one of the prices to pay for being near her
Sherlock dreaded every minute of it as she waited patiently for the damned priest to just hurry up!
And John lost it
Glad y'all haven't gotten too upset with me about updating slowly
And that was the end of that
After all, they cut back the more dangerous jobs when Junior was born, made sure Mycroft kept a good eye on Baker St and they didn’t make any high profile enemies again
She pulled the earpiece out of her ear, holding it out to Lestrade and dropping it in his hand, before turning and heading towards the exit, her heels clacking rather loudly with the dead silence that filled the air at the commotion
Everyone had been affected, Sally turning around and burying her tear filling eyes in Lestrade’s shoulder, whose face had pulled into a mask of anger and remorse.
His musing ended, though, when he crossed the path of the hallway into his room, and on his bed, rather neatly folded, was a cardigan, a deep and rich blue, matching almost the color of his eyes, and his hands wandering over the fabric showed it’s high quality, something that must have cost a fortune
“Dr. Watson? You’re ready to be discharged, please sign out at the front desk” Amy came in, giving a bright smile
He would never hurt her
(See the end of the chapter for
She also wasn’t a fan of social events, anyone who had ever met her would know that much, it was rather obvious by her heavy sighs, her dramatics whenever a case made them attend any sort of gathering, avoiding other people like the plague when it came down to it, because people weren’t worth her time unless they had something to offer, the humans around her were dull, stupid creatures that she couldn’t be bothered with if not for some kind of reward, information, a case, a limb or two from the morgue.
“Anderson seemed to think so…” She smirked, and John snorted in response
John turned towards her with an apologetic smile “Sorry, we were just going up…”
The second he came into the flat, stumbling just a bit with the alcohol fogging the edges of his brain, she was on him, pupils completely blown, her lips latching to his neck as her hand palmed at his soft cock through the denim of his jeans, trying to spring it to life on her post case high, needing to channel it into their usual rough and blissful sex, where he would whisper ‘you’re brilliant’ and she’d rattle off poetic nonsense of him being her beam of light in a darkening world
“To anyone’s eye, you’re ordinary.” She explained, her fingers connecting and doing there usual pose under her chin “You blend into the crowd, average intelligence, moderately attractive, neither tall nor too short, dirty blonde hair and dark blue eyes. People don’t notice you, even I, who could deduce your return to London and how you’d spent your years away, was still taken aback at the depths of your complexity. Even now you still manage to surprise me, something so very few can do.” She sighed again “My family is incapable of thinking beyond what they see” she gestured one hand towards him without turning to face him “Ordinary John Watson. The man Sherlock Holmes ‘settles’ for”
Of course everything with and about Sherlock could never be measured by normal standards, it was new and surreal and -Jesus fucking Christ- BRILLANT
“I hear you have a son together.”
He was startled at the sound of her voice
“Wait, where are you going? Sherlock? Sherlock!” John called after her, turning to see her rescinding figure as those seemingly endless legs carried her quickly through the hall, she kept going, ignoring him in favor of whatever was going on in that head of hers
“Had what, exactly?” she asked, her head resting on his good shoulder, feeling his heartbeat against her ear and drumming it softly against the curve of his neck with the hand that wasn’t in his
The sentiment, while any other time would have put her off, seemed perfectly lovely in her bliss
“Yeah?”
He grinned, taking her hand in his and guiding her to their hotel bed, running his thumb over the stone on her finger
“This is a king sized mattress”
“I wasn’t jealous! God, is that what you think?!” He yelled, removing his jacket and flinging it onto the ground no where near the hook “I’m not jealous of some arsehole that hit on you, that doesn’t matter, but he TOUCHED you”
Nothing too graphic but just to be safe
So no, Sherlock will remain as is, the height difference is adorable regardless of the sex of either party, you gotta admit it, besides, John doesn't seem like the type to be put off by a girls height, afterall, only really insecure guys don't like women taller than them, John is hardly insecure about his masculinity right?
“Charles!” his grip was crushing, much too enthusiastic  “Mike’s been going on and on about you! Turning our Sheryl into a decent woman, aye?”
He couldn’t correct him, tell him he loved her, every piece, every flaw and mistake and scar on her arms, that he would never be swayed, because, though an unfounded fear, he was afraid Sherlock would somehow find out, deduce that those words were uttered, that what appeared to be casual sex was so much more to him, that each time he held her to him, against him, possessing her the way others couldn’t, the warmth that spread throughout his body had nothing to do with what they were doing
“I have no reason to be jealous. Your advances are hardly sincere, a pitiful attempt to gain Anderson’s attention. He left about a minute ago to phone his wife.”
“God, yes”
“Earlier. I got frustrated. I almost deduced an affair happening between one of my cousin’s and the other’s husband” she turned off the light, leaving the room in total darkness expect for the little rays of moonlight peeking in from behind the thick curtains
Once again, she looked down at the little stick in her hand, reading it’s plus sign over and over again, it wasn’t that she didn’t believe it, of course she was pregnant, that much was so obvious she may as well be wearing a neon sign. What she didn’t understand was the fluttering in her stomach that had nothing to do with the baby currently forming, or the racing of her heart, the sweat building in her palms, and the restless energy she never felt during a case as interesting as the current one Lestrade had presented her with
This one is at most a 6 –SH
“Shit” John mumbled his curse, furrowing his brow before resting it against her chin, and she bent down slightly to meet his lips, kissing him for all she was worth as the telltale signs of his climax began to show, his slight tremble, his quickening breath, his tightening fingers
His smile didn’t falter “Will do” He said cheerfully
“Sorry?” They asked in union
for fanfics I don't publish on AO3
“Shut up” he replied, handing the address to the taxi driver looking at them oddly from within the review mirror before they were off
Also, be sure to check out my
“Wife returned?”
“Yes, and the conditions were that I was to not work while pregnant, but seeing as I no longer am, I fully intend to continue my work at Scotland Yard”
“Exactly where are we going?”  Sherlock asked, her legs crossed and her foot impatiently bouncing, “and why is it necessary for me to wear this thing?” she pulled lightly on the tie John had tied loosely around her eyes, an attempt at a surprise when they climbed into the back of the taxi
He sighed and sunk back into the mattress after a minute ticked by, not expecting a response
The child held so carefully in his arms had his name, his blood, but he looked almost exactly like Sherlock, from the tuffs of curling thin brown black hair to the piercing gray of his eyes, pale and beautiful and not a trace of his father on him
“And here I was under the impression bringing John would keep you lot from hounding me on my personal life. ‘When will you settle’, ‘when will you wed’, ‘how much longer do you plan to stay single’” the frustrated detective punctured her words with a fork stabbing at the steak in front of her, glaring down at it like it was the source of all the stupidity in the world before looking back up “If we need a new focus there are plenty here, for example, its obvious by Christina’s-”
He backtracked, blinking a bit at the sudden shift of her mood, from content to wary in a heartbeat
She supposed it was to be expected. After all, condoms weren’t always available during some of their heated moments and it hardly slowed either down, John too caught up in the moment and the thrill of going unprotected sending chills up her spine, giving it an extra edge that always brought her off sooner, a danger they both seemed attracted to
Reading her intention, he planted one last kiss to her inner thigh and followed up her body, licking her navel and in between her breasts as he went
Not that he really minded
(See the end of the chapter for
I'm at 2k for NaNoWriMo so I'm short about 2k... but I'm getting there?
“She’s separated…” John offered with a furrow of his brows, turning back towards April with a questioning look
But he wouldn’t trade the original for any of the faked copies. His favorite Sherlock was the ‘Crazed Genius Brat Detective Chasing Down Criminals at Midnight and Blowing Up Half the Flat by 2am as She Stayed Up For A Week Straight and Had To Be Forced Fed Tiny Amounts of Toast with Jam to Keep Her Alive Because She Couldn’t Manage That Herself Even Though She was Just So Bloody Brilliant’ Sherlock
Looking in the mirror, he was surprised by how well the color complimented his skin, his eyes, his hair, his whole person, something in that shade was hardly anything he would have bought from himself, but he could hardly expect his fashion sense to compare to a girl who treated London like her own personal catwalk
The next thing he knew, he had the man, who had almost a foot on him, pinned under his weight, sitting on his stomach as his fist connected to his face for who knew how many time, a crowd forming around the fighting and Lestrade’s “Police, coming through” cut the air as he weaved through the audience
“The only course of action now would be a divorce”
The command, like any other she tossed his way, was immediately obeyed, and he pulled a fraction out, his hands gripping her waist trying to center himself to the world around him, to not lose control and finish right then and there like a bloody teenager
“Seems appropriate, considering the circumstances.”
“Not on me…but…”
John took a hesitant step forward, but when she didn’t move to acknowledge it, he crossed the room, taking a seat at the corner of the table near her microscope, careful not to sit on anything
“I would imagine the case with the mail man who dressed as various cartoon characters to commit murder would come out on top…” Sherlock replied, a smile on her lips while she turned to meet his eyes “Pet Mail, was it?”
This case, of a sex slave ring which sold almost exclusively children, was already making it’s way under his skin when Sherlock first took a look, and after a week, she managed to nearly take the whole thing apart. But, it would seem, not fast enough, for by the time they and Lestrade’s team brought down the doors to the main warehouse, the operators had decided to dispose of their ‘merchandise’ to keep them from identifying the locations of the other houses and cliental, leaving Scotland Yard to find a room full of corpses with matching bullet holes in their foreheads.
She moved her fingers to stop him, and he looked up, watching in fascination at the expression on his flatmate’s face, all flushed with fever and desire
“Alright” John said, not bothering to complain when his muscles were hissing at the discomfort offered by the small loveseat, and having felt just how damn soft the bed was, he was more than happy to take her up on the offer, rare as it was for Sherlock to be considerate
Of course, now John chose to be observant, by her side in a matter of seconds with a steady hand on her elbow
Anyways, comment if you like the story thus far, I love reading what you have to say
Words were being screamed out by the suspect, important no doubt, but for the life of him John couldn’t bring himself to pay attention, only focused on the immediate danger at hand, and Sherlock’s body pressed to his chest
Attempting to mend family ties, but unable to do so because of her addiction
The good doctor took a few seconds to regain basic bodily functions such as breathing, sucking air greedily into his lungs, before following after her tall figure dumbly without sparing the surrounding shock so much as a passing glance
“Dinner is ready” Mycroft actually knocked before entering the room, something surprising to John, and the older Holmes eyes darted between Sherlock and John as if expecting to see them in a more compromising position than the one they were in
The next picture he took was of Rosie sleeping on Sherlock’s chest on the couch at 221b after a hard day of moving.
They arrived at 221b and stumbled up the stairs. Ms. Hudson would be distracted by her herbal soother now, so Sherlock didn't have to worry about that, but he turned on the stereo to make it sound like he was playing his violin anyway.
John smirked, sleep could wait. He leaned up to kiss his detective before fumbling down the hall and into Sherlock's bedroom.
“Share a cab? I can pick up Rosie from Molly's on the way.”
John clenched his fist,  “not about what you did, Sherlock, about how I reacted…” he met Sherlock's eyes, “I… well I was jealous.”
“Well,” John cleared his throat, “well, it's about what happened earlier.”
He leaned down cautiously at first, but at no sign of hesitation he closed the gap between himself and John, their lips meeting in a shy, soft kiss.
Sherlock made his way up the steps to the door of 221, but stumbled as he opened the door to enter. John reached out and caught his arm to stop him from falling and they both started to laugh while they took off their coats and clumsily hung them up.
………..
“Right. Not obvious, then.”
“No promises.” Sherlock said with a sly smirk.
“Look at this fag- you think you can scare us?!” the tallest of the boys said standing up from the table so he was eye to eye with Sherlock.
“Please.” Sherlock said with a smirk, motioning to the chair across from him.
“Right. I, uh, I- I'll just go then.” Collin stammered, grabbing his coat from the floor before hastily dodging around John and out the door.
“Tea?” Sherlock asked, standing up from the table and turning to the electric kettle on the counter, but John caught the sleeve of his dressing gown before he made it too far.
Sherlock rolled his eyes dramatically, “I thought we were done with that. I already said I am gay and sexually active, what else do you want me to say?”
John startled a bit, he hadn't noticed Sherlock sitting on his chair- still as a statue.
Mary must have sensed his sadness because she locked the phone and suggested they go out to dinner. She loved him and hated to see the way he still mourned for Sherlock, so she didn’t dare bring up the pain of the past again by asking about all those pictures.
Sherlock's eyes flicked over the man.
“No, John, it's not that. I do. I do love you back.”
He headed to the kitchen and sat in his usual spot by his microscope. There were two compounds found in the dirt in Hyde Park that he wanted to better familiarize himself with, that would keep those pesky feelings down for tonight.
“Good.” Collin slid Sherlock's shirt off the rest of the way and continued to trail kisses along his neck and collarbone. He reached one hand back and took a fistful of Sherlock's dark curls, earning a soft moan, while the other hand found its way to Sherlock's belt.
“Right, Baker Street, 221B Baker Street.”
“Fuck.” John mumbled.
He watched John as he leaned against the bar, gray-blond hair shining in the dim light of the bar. A woman next to him turned and smiled- he smiled politely in return, and they started chatting.
John continued to take pictures of cases as time went on. It was what he did before and seemed only natural now.
He made himself and Sherlock a cuppa, setting Sherlock’s next to his chair before sitting down on his own chair.
◇◇◇◇◇
John nodded appreciatively and turned to Sherlock, who was just catching his breath as well.
Sherlock said nothing.
Ms. Hudson was already standing at her door, a sleepy Rosie in her arms.
Sherlock reached up and cupped his hand on John's cheek. “John…” he could feel his brain swimming in leftover adrenaline and alcohol.
Sherlock smirked and did the same.
“Right, and only you’re allowed to do that.”
“I was otherwise occupied.”
He shook his head and opened the gallery app to delete the picture, but stopped before he could. It was a good picture, Sherlock's long limbs and curly hair seemed to almost glow in the light of the setting sun. Those hands that John had watched him use to fight criminals and examine dead bodies seemed so soft and innocent caressing his beloved violin, and the arch in his back and muscles in his neck seemed so elegant and in tune with his posh clothes.  He decided to keep it, telling himself he might be able to use it for the blog at some point.
“No, its fine.” Sherlock answered, his voice betraying him and shaking slightly at John's touch. “could have been a lot worse if you hadn't intervened.”
He thought it would be odd being back at 221B, but it had been a month now since he moved back in and it had taken little to no adjusting. Sherlock had surprised him by baby proofing everything before he had even brought it up to move back in.
“Those were my thoughts exactly. In fact, I thought we could go make sure the bed is comfortable enough now.” Sherlock near growled.
“Of course. Your flat is another 20 minutes, you and Rosie could stay at 221b if you'd like.”
“Right, I wouldn't… well, cheers to that.” John lifted his glass and drank.
“Bollocks.” John said, laughing a bit as he wrapped his arms around the taller man.
Sherlock gasped at the skin contact, pulling away to breathe.
“It's nothing, John, just healing flesh. Nothing to see, really.”
John could swear he saw disappointment on Sherlock's face, but it was gone as fast as it came.
So he got up from bed and headed downstairs with the reckless bravery of a soldier going into battle.
John returned from the surgery to find Sherlock in the same position in his chair as he had been this morning, but with a tight fitting purple shirt and his usual black jacket and trousers on as opposed to the pajamas and dressing gown he was wearing when John left for work. His eyes lingered momentarily on Sherlock's long fingers, tented and softly touching his lips. Sherlock's eyes were closed, but he didn't dare look for longer.
John let go of Brian's arm and pushed him into the table his friends were at as the bouncer started to run towards them.
“Right, thanks,” he paused, “why?”
“You hate going out. Why would we do that?”
“The military type, huh?”
John took a drink from his glass, “no, not really interested.”
“So Baskerville, and that case with Bainbridge must have been fun for you.”
John glared at him, but then his expression softened a bit. He reached up to wipe a tear from Sherlock's face, but Sherlock flinched and looked away.
John slid his hand around Sherlock's back to pull him closer, but then he stopped. Even tipsy he couldn't mistake the feeling of… scars?
“‘night” Sherlock responded as he went the couch to get his coat and shirt.
Sherlock was feverishly focused on some dirt or something when John entered the kitchen.
John's face blushed red as he turned to drag Sherlock up the stairs to their flat.
“William! Good to see you!” the bartender said, pulling out a wine glass.
“Are you flirting with me, Sherlock Holmes?”
“John… that isn't-”
“William,” Sherlock said, offering his hand with a smirk.
“Because according to a few different television programs it seems to be what people do when they are… not fine.”
“They're really fine, John, they're from years ago, when I was gone.”
◇◇◇◇◇
He was messing with all the apps and trying to organize it to his liking when he came across the camera. He lifted it to check out the supposedly “crystal clear quality” it was advertised to have and pressed the button, capturing a picture of Sherlock who was playing violin in his usual spot by the window. The camera clicked loudly, making John jump and drop the phone.
“Right-”
John could see a flash of hurt in Sherlock's eyes, but it came as fast as it went.
The bartender poured the glass, putting a little extra with a wink.
“Yes… Sherlock, you fucking git, I know what you're like, and I know you're ‘married to your work’, but I love you, and I have for a while now.”
John smiled awkwardly, that lopsided smile that never failed to make Sherlock melt.
“House red?”
“I, uhm…” he cocked his head to the side, searching for the right words.
………..
Sherlock stopped and turned around.
He looked up for just a moment, “Ah, John, couldn't sleep?”
“Bisexual, actually, and still willing to kill you.”
There were five pictures from the stag night that he didn’t remember taking. Two selfies of him and Sherlock together at some bar, one picture of Sherlock leaning against a table at another bar, one selfie that Sherlock must have taken of himself back at the flat, and one of John that Sherlock must have taken. He loved all five of those pictures. There was something about the way that Sherlock made him smile that emanated in those five pictures more than most. Even though the night didn’t end up being the most fun, he still thought it was worth it for the memories.
Sherlock turned gracefully and headed out the door. John kissed Rosie one more time and followed him out.
John looked quizzically at Sherlock. Maybe he had already known John would say yes, he probably did, but there was no point in arguing. It was probably some ridiculous experiment but, he could use a night out anyway, and he was off of the surgery tomorrow, so why not?
“I was trying to… warn you. You had me a bit distracted.”
Sherlock watched them, impatiently waiting for the bartender to hand John the drinks so he could walk back to the table. His attention was so set on John he almost didn't notice a man lean up against the table he sat at.
The next time he used the camera was after he met Mary. She mentioned that they didn’t have many pictures together, so she suggested they take some. He handed her his phone and they took a few silly pictures before going to the gallery to view them. His heart skipped a beat seeing the pictures of Sherlock on the screen again.
