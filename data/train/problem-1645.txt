!” The rebel felt his heart beat so loud that he was sure he heard it inside his ears, behind his eyes, in the splatter of the waterfall at the end of the lake.
He couldn’t stop. No matter how much he wanted to, the effects had been set in motion and he was powerless to stop them. Falling deeper and deeper into an unknown, scary territory of which he failed to determine whether he actually wanted to get out in the first place. Every plan of attack he could be thinking would be useless, no one could help him, nobody would be able to tell him why he suddenly felt as if every decision he had taken had been lived by a different person. Someone that he had never been. The blood pumping quickly through his veins felt like liquid fire under his skin, he wondered how could he be such an idiot as to allow this to happen?
I hope this makes up for the horror in which I left you last chapter.
to have it that way in the future. Everything else aside —compared to her previous atrocity— Sherlock believed he inadvertently did the world a favour.

decapitated his mother, after all.
“At least I don’t see a picture of me with horns and missing teeth.” The king said, and Sherlock jumped and turned around so fast he almost tripped off the platform on which he was standing. John was not in the mood to enjoy the fact of finally having startled him.
Inside the room, Sherlock was grinning again, and the other two looked on in anticipation. Every time he looked determined like that, everyone knew he was brewing trouble. “Irene,” He said, prancing across the room and stopping at his desk once more.
clouded over by the trepidation inside his chest. His fingers clutched the edge of the picture so tightly he was half afraid he would later have to explain the wrinkles to Archie. His silver eyes fixed on John’s handsome face; unable to tear his gaze away even when he felt Irene’s assessing sight trained on him.
laughed. “You are a cheeky one, aren’t you?” She asked but the silver eyes of the boy then moved to look at him, sparkling in the summer sun, not really paying any attention to the princess at all anymore.

“I tried,” Mycroft responded, a dangerous edge to his voice, and if daring the other to imply he hadn’t tried hard enough. “However a magical dome is beyond even my mortal capacity.” His hands shifted over the handle of his umbrella, and his shoulders were back as in defiance. Holmes’ never took too well at admitting personal shortcomings; Mycroft being a mortal with no magic, clearly believed he had many of those. Sherlock could see the sincerity in his eyes, and in turn nodded in acceptance, letting go of things which he couldn’t change.

Mary seemed to regard him for a moment, pushing her soft blonde hair behind her ear as if she were preparing for making business. “Who else have you told?” She asked, her stance not as defensive when she could recognise he had no real intentions of ratting her out.
“Sherlock Holmes doesn’t know something?” Lestrade replied, the amused tone was entirely not appreciated by the violet-haired boy. Greg chuckled along John and Irene, as Sherlock turned his accusatory gaze to the king: wasn’t he supposed to be on his side? “This really

a date; you’re easy, honey.” She smiled and watched as Janine’s hopeful expression turned excited. The rebel sighed slightly, “Besides, I was lucky enough to be given a chance, and I have to make the most of it.” Sherlock, and Archie, and all of the kids trapped in the Island very present in the front of her mind.
The older brother sighed, but his back straightened even more at the other’s verbal onslaught. “I didn’t think you’d be running off back to the Isle first chance you got.”
The silver-gazed took a step back and lightly bowed to her in gratitude for her loyalty. To which she responded in rushing to him and crushing him in a big hug. All of his others friends didn’t do this, but Sherlock supposed he could tolerate it from her for a few moments, he
“Auradon?” He asked sarcastically; he had had quite enough of the realm and its philosophy for the day. Turning back to his Spell Book and letting Irene deal with their unwanted guest.
He sat on the floor, reaching his two shaking hands forwards. The brunette sighed and closed his eyes; and pretended to ignore the image of the carcass of a person ingrained inside his mind; and the real reason why he had to do this, and how stupid he felt doing it. He ignored everything and let himself drift. He twirled the words over in his mind, until the intention started to define and make itself clearer. As the spell ate away at his mind, a surge of a picture became apparent; and before he knew it, he had left the stinky torture and was sitting crosslegged on the smooth floor of a different room. Around him, there were no more padded paneling, no crazy asylum of horrors, but the clichéd villainous decoration of quite a familiar office.
Apart from the jest, Sherlock could deduce he truly considered the day to have been exceptional, and in a way the boy agreed with that, down to his bones, so he said: “Oh, piss off.” There was no need to let Greg be aware of that and suddenly believe he could start acting like he had an idea all on his own which the rebel actually regarded as true. His friend grimaced and shoved his shoulder in retaliation, stepping aside and throwing his arms up in exasperation.
Once they were both alone, Sherlock let out an exasperated breath and rolled his eyes, as John chuckled with him and softly smiled. “Don’t pay attention to them.” He told him, his eyes kind and filled with concern as he glanced up at him. Sherlock was unsure in whether he found the king’s sentiment reassuring or even more frustrating. He shrugged in indifference, anxious to stop wasting their time on the lot of them. “They’re idiots, right?” The blonde joked, clearly attempting to appeal to the rebel’s predilection for insult, as he often did when he wanted to ease the tension.
me.” Irene replied. “If I was able to find
Janine seemed to be sold on his mischievous nature as well. At least not everything was doomed to be boring here, if anything else failed, Auradon looked like it could be a perfect place to stir up trouble. “Mr. Holmes.” She started. “You’re going to be incredibly useful.” Janine swore and smiled.
Let me know what you think.
“But your date!” Irene yelled after him as he walked carelessly out of the door and into the hallway. Strutting down the corridor and paying no attention to his surroundings in favour of staring at the fateful mobile phone.
“But you know him better than I do.” He said as he stuffed his hands inside his coat, no longer in need of being intimidating once that he had obtained what he wanted. And that was the only reason he had backed down, not because the truth of the fact made him oddly sick to his stomach.
“You spelled me with love cookies and conspired to steal the wand to overthrow me from the throne.” The blonde offered, with no real animosity contained in his words. However, to Sherlock they fell on his chest like an elephant’s weight, caging him into the leather.
There was no point in denying it, or pretending it wasn’t exactly accurate. “I’m not coming back.” The silver-eyed boy responded. The sentence dropping like a bomb inside his ears. A true finality of thoughts when they are voiced out loud.
“A pleasure doing business with you.” She said; her blood-red lips smirked up and she turned away from sight of the fencing team.
Sherlock’s previous devastation taking a back seat as he looked at the back of John’s head. The sliver of suspicion that had been there from the start growing bigger as he compared that posture with the undeniable one at the far end of the ship. He looked at the string quartet on the corner and to the dessert table, decked with a chocolate fountain and strawberries. His gaze narrowed at the conclusion. It was definitely him, but
, nothing in his life was sure anymore. He stood on the ledge of the deck, climbing unto the first bar of the railing and supporting himself in one of the remaining light poles. He screamed Eurus’ name to entice her to come out and face him.
“No!” The violet-haired boy exclaimed, rushing to his side, Irene and Lestrade closely behind him. Sherlock bent down and checked the older man over, worried lines appearing on his young face when he realised he had no way of knowing wether it would be possible to bring him back. Rage surged through his system at the pain, the terrifying sadness he felt at losing him so soon after finding him.
“I said: no.” Sherlock started. “The exam is almost over and she clearly didn’t have it with her, so she can’t have been cheating, now could she?” The boy stated, his tone dripping condescendence; he crossed his arms over his chest and arched an eyebrow in defiance. Irene looked on bewildered, her friend had always been ruthless, but lately he did things like this with a new passion that she had never seen before. “Is this the height of intellect the school is used to when its teachers are concerned?” Sherlock asked, his vicious smile cutting through the air quickly.
I know this has been a long time coming, but it is worth the wait.
our parents.” John heard himself answer. Perhaps more ominously than he had intended, but the truth was that he wasn’t entirely certain what he was about to do would work, and this wasn’t the time for empty platitudes. With
“You can’t touch it, remember?” The rebel reminded, gesturing to his very human, very
“So this is me, doing whatever it takes to win.” He said as he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He let the spell’s demons grow in his head, let them eat away and consume everything in their path. He clenched his fists tightly, and opened the door to their unadulterated magic, all the while reciting the words he had learned. A searing pain rushed through him and the only thing he could see were angry green eyes before everything turned pitch white.
He stuttered. “To- uh- her,” The lines were breaking. Sherlock turned to watch Irene and Greg, their shocked expressions staring back at him as the former king and queen took several steps backwards. Eurus encouragingly nodded her head and clutched the blonde’s hand in a tight grip. “I’m bringing down the barrier once and for all.” John concluded, sending the royal party into panic. His father looked furious and the warriors of light exchanged affronted stares. “Lady Hudson,” The blonde said, turning to address his godmother, opening and closing one of his fist in what seemed more like nervousness than brutality. “Break down the dome.” He ordered.

“I hate to keep bothering you,” She said, as she anxiously fidgeted with the pen and smiled apologetically. “But the decorating committee needs more answers, and I know you must be very busy, but this will only take a bit and as much as I-” She babbled. Causing the boy to have flashbacks on that afternoon where she had talked for thirty seven minutes straight, with no prompting on his part, and him only managing to hear
by complete submersion in, and
The blonde stood from the bench, now really hurt by the implications. “And what is that?” He asked, yet his voice was not entirely audible in the dead of the night. Even if the royal gardens were quite private, he did not wish for someone to overhear such a delicate conversation, no matter how strained their relationship had become, the regard he felt for Mary prevented him from letting her be exposed like that.
“Perfect.” She beamed and turned to exit his chambers. However, she seemed to change her mind and stopped just as she was about to leave, she turned around and her expression was suddenly cautious and nervous, as if she were not really sure she should do what she was about to. “John, can I ask you something?” She asked, threading her fingers through the keychains attached to her bag.
His eyes took on a mixture of enraged with an edge of confusion. No matter whether he understood it or not, this is how his mother used to be and how he was going to grow up to be; the usual satisfying taste he got at such a thought turned just slightly sour at the scene in front of his eyes, as if the task seemed daunting all of a sudden.
Greg waited a few seconds, unsure on how to break the tense atmosphere lingering over both their forms. “What happens if it doesn’t work and she gets the wand?” He asked in an impulse. Pressing his lips immediately after as if to keep any other treacherous words trapped inside his mouth.
Tell me what you think.
Hudson stood next to them, apparently to offer her support should they need it, fact that was not to go unnoticed by the villains. “Lady Hudson!” Jim exclaimed, turning away his attention from Sherlock for a moment. “What a pleasure! Long time no see.” The voice booming through the speakers seemed to suck the air out of the whole room; Sherlock wondered what it said about him the fact that that which he admired once, now he found slightly disconcerting. He chose not to dwell on how far he had fallen.
Mycroft twisted the umbrella and stared straight ahead, a detached tone as he answered. “Auradon gets run down by villains and the royal family most likely gets executed.” Lestrade was completely aware that there was no way in which the ginger would be indifferent if that were to happen. He turned to watch the older man, feeling despair crush the tiny hopes they had of actually winning.
“Hello, Moriarty.” Sherlock acknowledged; he stood up and placed his shaking hands inside the pockets of the coat that he was now wearing. He failed to know whether what he was doing was a good idea or a grave mistake, but he had run out of other options.
Thank you for everyone that read and invested their time in this story.
“You came here to remind yourself of who you are.” The other broke him off before he could retreat. Stating what he must have recollected from the glimpse at Sherlock’s mind he was granted when the silver-gazed boy had asked for admittance in his. “The
“Thank you, but no, thank you.” The blonde was quick to reply. “The last girl you set up ended up with that pervert from the Enchanted Meadows.” The boy recalled that perfectly, it had been a rare source of amusement for him for hours.
, but because he truly couldn’t fathom the idea why she wanted it, and what she hoped he would find.
“A crown doesn’t make you a king.” The blue-eyed was quick to disagree. Running a hand through his hair to mess up some strands. Giving him an air of nonchalance that Sherlock just found pleasing. After living between snobby royals for weeks long, the break was much appreciated.
“You know already.” The other interrupted, staring at him as if he were just a foolish child, lost in the ways of the world. “
We're at the middle of this story.
Sherlock looked at her and walked closer. “Oh, there’s no question about that.” He said. “The real question is what are you going to do to get back at them?” He ended and smiled a misbehaving grin.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sure every kid in Auradon knows that.” Sherlock continued, while he fidgeted with the bag. John needed to find a way to fix this, the last thing he wanted was to make him think he was scared of him, because that couldn’t be further from the truth.
“I know that silence.” Sherlock shook his head and tilted his head sideways. “What?” He said, his mercurial eyes squinting as he scanned Mycroft’s stance.
? How could he pretend to know what was best for all of them?
The girl smiled, causing a grin to form on Lestrade’s face as well. “Like hold hands, and dates, and texting?” She asked, the words almost jumbled together in their haste, already the hopeful expression breaking out over all her face.
“I don’t care.” Sherlock sighed. “And put that away, you’re not going to scare anybody with that stupid hammer,” He directed at Sebastian, whose smug grin fell from his face when he realised the rebel wasn’t impressed. “Or is it stupid Friday again, already?” Perhaps it was foolish of him to believe they all could be smart about the situation, the task apparently too great for some of them to perform.
As soon as they arrived to their destination —which to Sherlock looked exactly like any other of the hundreds of trees they had encountered the last half-hour— they walked into the thick of the forest. Crossing a wooden, yet sturdy-looking bridge over a stream, as the colour of green on the leaves grew more intense the closer to the middle they got.
Irene regarded him, getting that strange look she had been giving him since they arrived at Auradon so many moon-cycles ago. “Why would I?” She queried, even if he couldn’t be sure whether it had been rhetorical or if she actually expected him to
“And never, ever smile.” Lestrade added at his apologetic expression. “Unless you’re torturing something.”
“Are you using again?” Greg went straight to the punch; they had all lately faced scarier things than Sherlock in one of his
“I know, Jim.” The curly-haired boy responded, noticing the disappointed expressions the two of his companions were trying to mask. Sherlock never really had any delusions about his role on Moriarty’s life, yet this was actually family for Irene and Greg and it must sting to realise their only true concern was in the wand and their impending power —not that his mother had been better when she was alive, she was definitely worse.
The boy with the violet hair and grey eyes lazily sprayed the locker doors with bright green paint and laughed when some random citizen snatched the bottle of paint from his pale hand and proceeded to do the honours himself. He alternated between watching a gang of young students tie their teacher to the fountain in the garden and casting spells to sprinkle some magical mischief to the already insane situation. The rebel flipped his leather-coat collar up and gave a condescending smile to any frowning bystanders that had yet to try a bite of the delicious freedom they were offering.
He pondered, as they moved through people’s legs. Suddenly, the rebel bumped into a pair of very familiar shoes, an atrocity that could not be hidden no matter how long the hem of the wearer’s dress was. Perhaps he had helped Molly with her hair but her fashion sense still needed a lot of work. And ironically, it was at that moment when the answer came to him, stemmed by that mundane notion. He ran his hands through his bright purple hair and gasped in the revelation it provided, smirking when he saw the resolution staining his left hand.
This time he wasn’t able to even try to fight off feeling like a terrible fraud or ignore the growing disease he felt inside him. His own guts chocking and leaving him gasping for air as he silently sobbed, with only half a mind to let none of the stray tears fall into the mix. Well, none but one.
The responding expression was predatory, completely aware of how unwanted their presence was. There was not much to be said about Irene and Lestrade’s parents, well
adjusted his moonshine grey suit. “I just-”
John smirked at him in respect, and the moment the other’s posture relaxed back he reached out, wrapped one arm around the other’s waist and yanked him forward for a startling kiss.
“There’s fuel on the engines,” Lestrade shook his head and crossed his strong arms in frustration. “That would blow up the ship.” He explained, and John immediately searched for another alternative, one that didn’t include any of them turning into confetti. Irene sighed and jumped back as a puff of smoke stretched and tried to grab her leg.
Lestrade sighed but still brought forward all that he had stolen through the morning, giving it up for inspection by his greedy progenitor; Sherlock just slouched more in his seat and anxiously waited for them to be over with their tedious affairs so he could retire to his room and finish his experiment in the rate of deathly poisons.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That we’re
“Oh, for God’s sake!” Anderson bemoaned loudly, causing the others to stare at him with even more alarm than that of the fact they now had a female captain. The team clapped, hesitantly at first but then gained volume and some enthusiasm. They presented swords, —as was accustomed to do for their commander, and Greg soon joined in the gesture.
“Maybe if we turned around?” Lestrade said, “Let you focus?” His face portrayed a calm he certainly didn’t feel, but Molly looked at him gratefully for the suggestion, and Greg counted that as positive.
John laughed as the violet-haired tried to lick clean the skin surrounding his mouth. “You just got a-” The blonde said as he reached his hand towards the other’s face, only for the other to flinch back and avoid any sort of contact. John retreated his arm, yet he didn’t seem confused or angry, just accepting, and Sherlock thought it would have been less frustrating if he had yelled at him. “Do this.” John demonstrated, licking and smacking his lips, then smiling.
I can't believe we're approaching the end, I hope you like it.
her.”
“Emotional context.” Eurus jumped in, grinning in encouragement as her ocean eyes pierced through his form. “It was like love, Sherlock.” She explained, making the other take a slight step back, distancing himself from the horror. “Can you believe it?” The crowd around them was deadly quiet as she conveyed her improbable enthusiasm. “I finally feel
“You sure I can’t see you before that?” The other asked, making a harmless face and acting for all the world as a parent missing his kid, the three teenagers fought the urge to spit at them. “I don’t know what I will do if I don’t get my hands on that mag-” He stopped himself, realising mid-sentence that letting greed hinder the slim chances they had was not a good risk to take; no matter how impatient he was for it to be true. “On you,” He corrected swiftly, acting as if the mishap had never happened. “You whom I love like a son.”
you.” His insistence was completely justified, the royal often spent far too much time worrying on whether he could one day be a good and empathic king, yet Sherlock refused to sympathise with someone who had meant to harm him just to gain leverage.
“Christ,” John exclaimed in a very royal way. “That’s almost worse.” It was the violet-haired boy’s time to feign offense.

foolish,” The king opened his mouth to retort, but no sound came from his lips as his ocean blue eyes opened wide and he questioned the veracity of them. “I left because I thought it the only logical conclusion.” The rebel explained, a soft smile of fondness forming at the gesture. “That it was only a matter of time before you found out yourself.”
“And John?” She asked, staring directly at him now.
“I just pick the one that doesn’t sound like any fun.” He answered, to which Lestrade threw a loud and interrupting belly laugh that cut off the voice asking yet another situational interrogation. Mrs. Hudson —who had appointed herself, as main Defender of Light, to impart as much knowledge of virtuousness to the three additions to the school’s alumni— cleared her throat impatiently, clearly not at all amused that they seemed to be taking the class so indifferently.
The royal stared at him in what could only be described as
“I do.” Lestrade pitched in, smiling brightly and reaching a hand to mess up the purple curls on top of Sherlock head.
Irene, although more graceful, was also nibbling on a blue transparent ball with equal enthusiasm; it amazed the genius how easily distracted they could become when there were far more important things than some strange
The kid was his age, yet as he spoke that, he seemed several sun-cycles older, —the fact the he towered over John, just like almost everyone else did, didn’t help either— John stayed seated on that bench long after his new teammate had gone off to shower and most of the other kids had left the building. He vowed he would make sure things were different for them there.
“I told John this wasn’t going to be easy.” The King commented, as his wife grabbed him by the arm and joined in on the brief exchange. The boy in the purple suit and dragon collar nodded in agreement but pursed his lips in pursuit of what to say to acknowledge them.

“Maybe.” She said, looking at her rings glinting in the light sneaking in from the tiny window on the back of the room. Giving him a sliver of respite from her challenging gaze. “But don’t you think there’s a reason why you didn’t even think it could be anyone else in the kingdom but you?” Irene asked, returning her knowing eyes at him in a stare down that he definitely didn’t win. She sighed, recognising he was not going to reply, possibly ever; but her surprised eyebrows didn’t hide the fact that his answer was probably written all over his face anyway.
“We’re with you, Sherlock.” Janine’s voice broke through the miasma of horrible white noise inside his mind, making the violet-haired startle away from the vision at last. He shifted his gaze to look around to the others present. Anything to avoid looking at the sea-foam green of her dress floating as she was twirled. His brother’s face was the most striking among the discombobulated and affronted. Twisted into a deep scowl, and making him look several cycles older than he was.

“Come on!” Sally said clapping in time, placing a trainer over Philip’s back and applying downward pressure. “Pick it up, Anderson!” She commented, to the delight of the other’s present. Anderson grumbled something unintelligent but kept going through the entire set. Lestrade thought that perhaps Sally’s addition to the team will come with unforeseen upsides.
“Oh, no. This is
The ginger man stepped closer and arched an eyebrow. “How lovely to see you.” He commented.
“Sorry?” Janine asked in half-mock, her smile showing her true feelings about the situation. At the other end of the room, Molly watched on with blatant fascination, the violet haired boy was not sure why she was still there, but he supposed making her go away now that she was of no use to him would be considered ‘rude’ and he had to thread lightly until he could blow his cover. The only way he could stand this monotony was thinking of what he would gain once he got the wand in his grasp.
Looking around, the violet-haired found most of the attendees backing away, huddled next to the great mosaic at the bow of the ship; unable to cross towards the bridge. The royal party stood behind him, John just a few paces away, drenched to the bone, as he waited for Eurus to deliver her demands. She was ready to strike when the violet-haired boy closed a fist and caused fire-like bursts of magic to knock her down several feet away.
Who is your favourite character so far? Do you what they will try to do next to get the wand?
“Wonderful.” Lady Hudson beamed and placed an oblivious hand over her arm, covered with a sparkly soft jumper in white which matched the big ribbon bow covering most of her head and hiding her pink roots.
.” The rebel finally said, because there was no denying it, the resemblance was uncanny. Even more accurate than Sherlock’s own vision of himself.
The padded walls transformed into a cavernous space, grey stone walls shrouding them as if they resided on the dungeons inside an ancient castle. The setting was a tad dull and unglamorous for Moriarty’s usual taste, yet he made up for it with the big glass box at the centre of it. More than two meters tall, and encasing a lavish red and gold throne inside. Jim was perched on it, laying sideways nonchalantly in an impeccable grey suit topped with a king’s thick cape. The bejewelled crown sat on his head casually, as if its weight had been perfectly balanced to rest on top of his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
He said, and the violet-haired boy physically reeled back at the comment, his silver eyes quickly shifting away from John’s after seeking his reaction at his brother’s words. “I calculated it to be unnecessary.” The ginger continued through the boy’s distress.
and can evoke feelings of animosity
After three —illegally-scored— hits by his team, and ninety five minutes of game, Lestrade was beaming with victory and some of the players were sporting a few new bruises. But all in all, it was a successful practice and the expression Adam —the coach— was giving them proved he believed it too.
That statement puzzled the villain. “I am?” He asked, leaving his spell book on the bed and crossing his arms in confusion.
of you.” The breaking point evident in the crack of his voice when he lashed out. The tears in the brunette’s eyes weren’t exactly doing anything to improve the situation. “I can’t be like those princes and princesses that inhabit this kingdom.” He said. “I’m a big fake, alright? A facade. Hair? Fake.” He said, “Clothes? Fake.” He gestured said offending brown curls and the horrible plain jumper he wore. “Manners. Cooking. All
The glowing dragon laid struggling on the grown, as if restrained to the floor by invisible chains into the hastily-drawn red circle on the marble. The curse in the boy’s blood was eating away at the other’s incantation like a disease, trying to bind it in the darkness of oblivion for eternity. It would not be able to, obviously, —it wouldn’t even contain it for long— but at least like this he had more time to devise what to do next without being cursed into the next century.
The end is here!
“Oh, I’m counting on it.” She responded, the tone flat once more; gone was the bashful lover or the queen of wrath; just Eurus Holmes as everyone knew her. “And I have a vivid imagination.” The words sent a chill down the blonde’s spine. “First,” She said. “No magic.”
“Look at me!” She screamed, yanking his royal blue-clad shoulder around and securing a frantic hand over his shoulder. “You love me, remember?” Her tone left no space for argument. Conveying a false sweetness as she covered his hand with hers and eyed him sternly. As if John were just a dazed kid speaking nonsense.
“Um, you know,”
Sherlock thought. “Fancy giving it a go?” He said as he arched an eyebrow, Greg swallowed audibly and raised his hands in surrender.
His eyes kept shifting between his imminent demise before him, and the blonde boy behind the looming figure. His kind and worried gaze was stripping him of every other thought he possessed. The expression he found in the other was almost enough to soften his resolve, but he was not allowed to falter now. He needed the monster, and monsters were not allowed that which he wanted. Muttering a silent goodbye, Sherlock felt cold run through his limbs, colder than he had felt in cycles, but he shrugged it off, not having time to dwell on it. Moriarty was ready to attack, and the boy could recognise this time there would be no dancing around the issue. If he didn’t act now, he would never get the chance again. He had to do it: this atrocity he was born to do.
Let me know in the comments.
John thought with a chuckle.
A few seconds passed in relative silence —with the other royals still distressed by the events and rushing about to get the cursed people on stretchers and out to get magical aid. All of this, coordinated by the former King and Queen, of course. The rebel wondered why John was not there helping, since his first instinct would have characteristically been to make sure his people were safe, but perhaps now that his parents had taken care of that, he was left staring down in apprehension at Jim, as if making sure there was no way for him to bounce back to life and destroy them.
“Yeah, I’m good.” She said, he words coming out strained as she was placed on the backseat of the car. Sally Donovan looked on in what appeared to be concern as she hauled up the strap of the quiver filled with the swords to rest comfortably on her shoulder. Her both feet shuffled next to the passenger’s door, displaying an anxiety that had never before been on her smooth brow. The rebel had often found her easy to deduce, —an open book, really— yet this was an emotion he believed was more tightly bound to her core than all others. The first encounter with real fear could bring that out of someone. But still she looked as if that concern angered her more than anything else.
“I know,” Janine replied, an uncomfortable smile on her expression. “I just, I thought
“Oh, your words have nothing to do with that.” The other replied, a smirk painting across his face as he looked down from almost a head above. The prince giggled helplessly, losing all sense of property for the second time that morning. He didn’t really know how tired he was of everyone treating him like a royal glass figurine until these three foreigners provided a respite.
Sherlock’s frame shook in his arms, “We need to get you out of the water,” The blonde whispered, not stopping one second as he looked around for a way to get back up. Eurus’ pull on the tides under them was still perceivable and it worried him, even if John had no actual visual of her. To him, having her out of sight was worse.
“What’s the harm?” He asked, yet he knew he would be met with quiet derision. And true to form, his girlfriend was giving him such an intense glance of pity for his perceived naivety.
“I’ll first pluck my own eyelashes.” He dead-panned, and Molly finally let out a nervous laugh from between the fingers over her mouth. The rebel glanced at her and arched an eyebrow in approval
Wilkes face grew red from anger, and his uncovered arms flexed into battle stance. However, he stayed put, not wanting to act out against his leader’s orders. E. payed him no mind and observed Sherlock; said boy just leaned back and arched an eyebrow at her staring. “Look at me.” She said, tilting her head as her teal eyes made sure he did as she asked.
but at the very least they weren’t as cynical about their true interests as Moriarty was. Greg shared a glance with him, a quick look of apprehension in turn to display the dread they all felt. It was clear that none of the kids wanted to be reminded of the fact that their
give an account on the multiple reasons it was a legitimate question. “Look at where we are, what more could you ask for? I’ve got everything I ever wanted here.” She explained, as she twirled the deerstalker on her finger. “Don’t you?”
The little boy seemed to notice the silence that had befell Sherlock, and in turn just stared at another article from the box. Irene sighed and reached for a random piece to present to Archie. “And what about this one?” She said, turning the boy’s attention away from the tension and focusing him on retelling the story of how he had acquired that particular note. Irene smile and listened, ignoring the grateful expression over Sherlock’s face, as his eyes weren’t able to leave the photograph.
“He must never come back here.” Sherlock said, although the rebel knew it was more an order than a suggestion. “He can’t keep dealing with all the idiots I’ve slighted or humiliated in the past,” The violet haired was sure he could deal with them on his own, as he always had. But having John in danger not only proved highly disadvantageous but he also refused to put the blonde in any harm’s way if he could help it. “Which is a lot of them.” He said.
“God!” Greg exclaimed, running an exasperated hand over his face. He figured that perhaps the direct route would be the best option in his situation, no matter how much he wished to avoid saying the words out loud. “I’m asking you to be my date for Cotillion.” He quickly worded, only to watch hesitant understanding dawn over the other’s face, the conversation on her phone forgotten as her hand gripped the device
“Yes, dear.” She responded while the other frantically turned the pages of the Spell Book, but in an opposite manner than earlier. This time it was with an objective in mind.
“Sherlock,” He commented, making most of the other’s anger drain almost instantly; leaving only the wounded expression of his mercurial eyes under the purple fringe at being disregarded by his brother in such a way.
“Ah, smart!” Mary commented, pleasantly. The curly-haired boy was still unsure on his take on her character. She had been a lot more accepting of them since what had happened in John’s coronation, and frankly her dark humour often came as a grateful change from her boring, Auradon peers, —mainly prissy princes and princesses. But Sherlock couldn’t quite shake the feeling that there was something about her that he still didn’t quite know. And he hated not knowing.
“Don’t worry,” Archie assured the girl, as she turned her gaze to stare at Sherlock. The twin worried expression made him know she probably agreed with him. “I’m happy for you.” The fact that he didn’t even seemed to be sort-of lying when he said it was actually worse than if he hadn’t meant it at all. The Woman smiled sadly at him.
“Yes, we-” He started, ready to explain in length what had happened, but he halted once Sherlock’s door came into view and he saw light filtering out from the room. “Why is Sherlock’s door open?” Greg asked, as he watched Mike frown and walk faster towards it. Greg pushed the door all the way, only to be greeted by Anderson’s back. “You’ve got to be kidding me.” He exclaimed, crossing his muscular arms.
“Donovan, what are you doing here?” He growled, his pale cheeks turning red from what The Woman could only assume was pure rage that she dared to involve herself in matters that were exclusively his and John’s —without, of course, counting E. and her pirate crew, and his own allies, and the threat to the whole realm.— But in his eyes, all of that seemed to be inconsequential.
He made sure his collar was up and took some steps to stand right where the ginger had vacated, looking out to the festivities. Perhaps he should worry about ambiance and decorations —he was sure Molly would have found a way to sneak in a few of her very cheesy ideas— but the thought never even crossed his mind as he stared at some of the people with expectant faces. He could see Irene’s proud face, and Greg smiling at the left with Molly practically hanging off his arm in excitement. He hesitated in the next step, until his brother leaned in and whispered, “Time to
something of value in exchange for some kind
expense when the truth is worthless.
Molly chose that moment to finally step forward and break the tension, impatiently running to the king and wrapping him between thin arms as she hugged him with relief in her expression. “John!” She exclaimed. “I’m so glad you’re okay.” Her hair in the high ponytail too perfect for the situation, only making her appear younger as she beamed at him.

A stab through the heart would have been less painful, the boy figured as he tried to ignore the sole truth. Because she was right, he was about to lose John, before he even sincerely had him —a love-spell was cheating at best— and despite knowing it from the very beginning, hearing the affirmation come from such an honest individual made it all the more tangible, more
However, the king didn’t seem dissuaded yet, if anything his resolve appeared more decided, like the answer for which he had searched was forming up clearly for him to recognise. “Like you don’t, actually.” He said, leaving behind his alerted pose and dropping both his defensive arms to his sides, as if confident he was not going to be made a target of anything he didn’t desire. As if daring him to take a shot at him. This threw the rebel off for various reasons, what could possibly be written in his face that John still wholly trusted he would never intend to hurt him? The boy didn’t really want to find out.
When I started this project I never really believed it was going to end up being so long or different, but I had a lot of fun writing it.
Greg supposed there was nothing more to do than to go down with it. “Yes.” He replied, even if he knew how absurd it sounded even to his own ears. The boy smiled encouragingly, hoping she would buy it. He struggled to not draw attention to the backpack, and risk her asking questions about that too. If anybody else caught wind of this, John’s life could be in serious danger.
“They’re here!” Sebastian exclaimed, climbing down from the mast where he was perched up. The rest of the pirates cheered, excited cries raining down as the four of them approached the platform to the deck.
At only seconds left of the game, Greg managed to cover John and the ball by picking up another player by the shirt and using him as a shield, Sherlock laughed at such display. Perhaps Lestrade
—although perhaps not by much.
“Listen, I know we were shocked at first, but you-” His mother sighed, a pleased expression breaking out over her features as she regarded him with something akin to gratitude. “You’re

evil.” The joke was not even that funny, yet John let out a roaring laugh as if he were something special. The violet-haired found not even that was able to draw the smile off his face completely, if anything the ridiculousness of the situation just managed to heighten his mood.
The statement made a spark ignite inside of him, “He’s
and the violet-haired’s cheeks warmed at the thought of the other regarding him in that way, when he, in no sense of the truth, deserved it. “No,” John assured, taking the ring he had recovered earlier on deck and sliding it on the rebel’s slender finger. “You weren’t.” He said.

Behind him, a couple of distinctive steps were heard approaching the scene quickly. Appearing as if out of thin air as was her wont since she had given up magic as the majority of the kingdom. “Leave it like you found it.” She said, to which the three teens stopped and regarded her in varying amounts of amusement. “And by that, I mean

“Okay.” She said brushing a strand of blue hair back over her ear. Archie waved them goodbye, as he retreated and sat at the desk once more, eagerly organising his collection again. The sunny grin not leaving his face as he stared at the newspaper articles with daydreaming-eyes.
With Sherlock’s prompting gaze, Molly shook off the bewilderment and said. “Yeah?” She asked, and gave no time for him to answer before she was already eagerly assured, all prior thoughts and doubts forgotten. “You won’t regret it.”
“Very well,” The man relented, not seemingly fazed at the continued rejection. He adjusted his glasses and took a moment to scratch his blonde beard. “Moriarty requires your presence at the castle immediately.” He declared, to which the younger man could only frown in confusion, that usually meant he was going to have to spend the afternoon doing some sort of special errand. Well, at least it would certainly occupy his intellect for an hour or two. “He said to bring your gang of punks.”
“Oh, I know.” He said, ignoring the previous statement as he dropped the recently deceased fish over the counter, making a nasty squelching sound as they hit the surface. “I brought you a gift.” He rang the bell on the wall-opening signing for the cook as a shameless smirk appeared over his lips.

The violet-haired boy gaped, “John,” He said, “Eurus
“I think you should find the missing part of your dress, Irene.” He commented, gesturing to the exposed part of her legs with a smirk. The girl just rolled her eyes at him in annoyance and the boy chuckled.

John raised a hand in innocence, slowly withdrawing his own blade away from the girl on the floor. His blue eyes stared with hatred at Victor, but darted further back behind him, feeling himself smile at what he saw. “You were wrong, you know?” The royal commented, revelling in the confused brows under the other’s black hat. “I told you you were wasting your time.”
Come back next week to know what happens.
And sometimes he didn’t. “Piss off!” Was the yell that traveled back into their ears. Making the both of them stand back in defeat.
The silver artefact in Jim’s hand grew heavy, and for a moment nothing happened. But after a few seconds the wand started pulling at him the tiniest bit; trembling with the force between the both of them. Sherlock was clearly burning himself out, desperate to make the spell work, and James laughed delighted at the feeble attempt to take something from him. Then, something shifted, and the rebel opened his eyes as if in revelation, and in that exact moment, Moriarty’s fingers tried unsuccessfully to secure it; but the wand had already gone flying out of his grasp, and landed in the possession of a very surprised Sherlock.

an extraordinary day.” The amazement was painted all over his face.
“It’s okay.” The girl muttered, and struggled to gather the papers she had dropped in nervousness. Anxiously attempting to get out of the room before she could embarrass herself further. “Don’t mind me.”
“I believe you underestimate his character.” Sherlock commented, once the intruders were out of hearing range. The whole point of this conversation was to be discreet and a known secret would do good to none of them.
The blonde turned to look at her with wide eyes, blinking at her as he studied her expression. “Are you sure?” He asked.
“And that’s Thursday.” Sherlock commented, breaking him out of his pondering. John turned with a questioning frown at his boyfriend’s dismissal.
“Because I’m not like them, John!” He exclaimed, and if John had looked surprised before, he now looked truly shocked for the first time of the evening. “I’m not like
it.” He ended, with his characteristic level of sass as he sat back down on the blanket.
“Let’s get out of here.” Lestrade said, matching Irene’s expression as the rebel felt his feet move on their own volition. When they all crossed the deck, Sherlock dully flicked his wrist and made a faint green mist gather around his body as his great black coat was summoned; figuring there was no point in hiding now. The familiar warmth and heaviness over his shoulders while he walked acting like a shield from the garish reality.
Let me know what you think about it.
“No, he doesn’t.” Sherlock assured. “Oh, John,” He continued, slowly taking a small step closer to him. “The bravest, wisest, most loyal man I’ve ever known:” The raw emotion was impossible to tear away from Sherlock’s words, so he let it play out instead. “You can be
“You know,” He starts, motioning to the inside of the boy’s locker. Sherlock’s grey eyes pierced through his in intensity, as if he were trying to figure something out. “The labs are open from 7 in the morning to 11 pm, you should really think about returning those beakers where they belong and just experiment there,” John commented. “What do you say?”
like you.” He snarled, wondering if perhaps he should feel confused at his remaining readiness to defend the character of the royal who was doing this to him. A small sliver of him furious at himself for being exactly what he had always despised.
“Excuse me?” Asked the girl with indigo hair, red lips curling down in opposition to the order. Clearly in no way not pleased with the rebel’s intrusion.
of influence or action in return, that the recipient
“You never came back.” The violet-haired boy commented, not reproachfully any more; in some way, he understood what it was like to make choices which were not even under your control. The limitation of options when someone in the world is the way they are. His opal eyes searched the other’s expression, changing between questioning and contemplating, as he believed his brother would be doing with him as well.
“Heroes don’t exist.” He stated, finding comfort in something he found familiar. “And if they did, I wouldn’t be one of them.” The face the other made at this statement could have been framed, gaping like a fish as he shook his head incredulous.
Just as she was about to berate them once more to pay attention, a petite figure entered the classroom quickly and as quietly as was possible for any human to walk. She was of small stature, brown eyes and walked with her brunette-topped head down, as if trying to draw the least amount of attention to herself that she could. Walking with short, yet swift steps towards Lady Hudson and shuffling her frankly atrociously clad feet as she waited for the older woman to notice her.

breathe for several seconds.
He and the two of his other trouble-makers acquaintances made their way through the various empty rooms of the place. Past several torture chambers —which were now resolutely out of use, except for the resident’s experiments— and all other rooms with weapons and coffins; just another of the stereotypical fairytale haunted castle. It may have worked on the past to frighten any old fool who could wander off and end up there by chance, and it could have been useful to maintain an air of rightful menace towards dubious or questioning subjects. Now, it was terribly old-fashioned and there were times when the young man hated the caricature of it all. From the half-life they were all living trapped in that dump, right up to the sleek figure standing at the middle of his sitting room.
Next to him, Irene was scrawling something on her notebook but completely ignoring the lesson and the teacher; the boy didn’t blame her, he was clearly not qualified to give this course. The fact that they had to share the lesson with Philip Anderson didn’t seem to help either.
Let me know what you think of John in this chapter. Also, what do you think will happen next?
“Mate,” He said using the term he had heard John apply with the function of familiarity, Sherlock, even if always gloomy, could say he was mildly impressed with the uncharacteristic insightful observation. “We don’t want any trouble.” Greg said, and hands came down to be stuffed inside the pockets of his leather jacket.
“Skip the whole thing?” Molly said, unknowingly crashing all his plans. The expression on her face growing more agitated by the second. “I can’t, my family is counting on me,” Was her motive. “Specially my Gran, after last time-” She trailed off, none of them really knowing how to breach the subject of them —mainly Sherlock— manipulating her and resulting in her trying to steal the wand for herself. It was a grey area, to say the least. “You know…”
Let me know what you think!
“He’s not the king,” He said, faint clouds of purple smoke forming beneath his feet now that he stepped over the wood’s deck once more. His nose turned up at her animosity. “I admit it might have taken me a while,” The tone turned ironic, an expecting eyebrow arched at them. “I’m afraid I was a bit compromised,” The bitter chuckle bounced off the crisp air as he stared at the crowd. Irene frowned at him while he rounded around the couple and they turned to keep him in sight. Lestrade somehow managed to hide his own laughter behind his fist. “But I know John when I see him, trust me.” This was solely directed to his half sister, because knowing the king was a privilege that no Holmes would ever deserve but somehow had landed in his lap; and he would be even worse than Anderson if he didn’t cherish it. “I mean, he went to all that trouble to prove it, I might as well return the favour,” The violet haired boy flapped his hands around excitedly, gesturing to the beautiful mosaic as his purple curls glowed brighter under the fairy lights above their heads. “Because now I’m certain.”
We're almost at the end, I hope you enjoyed it. Let me know what you think.
Despite the frankly horrific decoration and the annoyingly idiotic inhabitants, Sherlock could admit Auradon did have its noticeable upsides; even if only to make doing evil a lot easier. Because for every soft pastel blue with mint green bed sheets and fake, cheery smiles, there was the easiest-to-hack data base about every magical relic guarded on the kingdom, conveniently mentioning each artifact’s location along with the estimated time of arrival to said destination from the user’s standing point. The rebel found he liked the place solely because of the fact of how desperately it seemed to be begging to be brought down by someone else.
At the sound of his laugh, Greg turned and smiled mischievously at him, as if he approved of the other’s humour; John hoped that could mean he could actually befriend one —if not all— of the three teenagers. The other boys present looked at them with animosity, specially Philip Anderson, who was sporting a nasty grimace at the fact of having to spend his afternoon around
“No, but-” Irene tried to interject, but the rushing speech of the other trampled over her words as she continued with not a care or sign of having heard her.
Suddenly excited, Molly turned around and looked at him with eyes full of expectation and new found regard. “Can you make it turn brunette?” She asked.
The silver-eyed boy turned his head to John, whose pleading gaze conveyed a million layers of meaning. The royal struggled against his bonds as two pirates made sure he couldn’t move closer to the deck, confining him on a wooden board with sure death down below to one side and them on the other. “Alright.” Sherlock said, twisting his body around and coming face to face with Irene and Greg, both of whom wore similar expressions. Lestrade’s hands clenched into fists while the indigo-haired girl crossed her slender arms over her chest. They stood terrified but with matching resigned frowns. Ready to advance once E. got what she wished. Sherlock payed no mind to their faces and sighed. “Always so dreadful.”
horror.” She paused, a broken sigh escaping her lips as if disappointed “You shouldn’t have let me into the water.” With that, she dived into the tide once more, leaving all on deck desperately awaiting for her deliverance.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course I will!” They younger man accepted into the mic, only to fear for his hearing abilities for the second time that afternoon after the uproar it caused.
Sherlock could barely register John was a bit outraged at his accusation, showing that nerve the rebel had always liked about him. “I may be an idiot, but I know a lot more about this than you do.” The blonde demanded, not ready to be dismissed as Sherlock intended. “I was five when the war started, remember?” He asked. “I’ve seen bad people. I know what that hatred looks like,” Revealing the fact of which the genius had been previously unaware. Of course he could do the simple math, but he had never stopped to think about John actually witnessing anything like he did. “And you may have her eyes but you are
“What!?” The trio of teens exclaimed in unison. Incredulity painted across their expressions; one of them —Greg— even took a step back in rejection. Sherlock’s fists curled up inwards, knowing exactly where this business was headed. “No.” He said in finality, refusing to play to the other’s machinations. “I’m not going to some tedious boarding school filled to the brim with annoying morons and prissy pink princesses.”
He tried not to panic, but the situation was not exactly inducing a lot of calming thoughts into his mind. A sudden splash propelled water rushing towards him, colliding with them and sending them both underwater, the royal barely able to keep the rebel in his hold as they were jostled and twirled inside the wave. A feeling of pause rushed inside of him as they both were suspended in the water’s domain, allowing him to catch a glimpse at the bottom of the ship, covered in darkness as thick as ink but with no sight of any form of body around it as he had previously thought; the limbs seeming to spring from the depths of the ocean itself. John swam to the surface, breaking and inhaling a great burst of air as it rushed inside his lungs when he realised what had caused the angry tides: one fallen tentacle was dissipating in the water as dust, while an opening in between the ones gripping the ship appeared. The winged beast surprisingly appeared to be making progress.
John cleared his throat and said, “So, a brief tour of the grounds.” He gestured and started walking towards the very front of the building, motioning to the group to follow. “Auradon Prep: built over three hundred cycles ago, and converted into an educational institute by my father when he was elected King.” He said as an introduction to the impressive-looking piece of architecture on the grounds, sturdy light brown bricks encompassing the structure and the tall towers were decorated with Auradon banners in gold and blue. They also passed the royal gardens, green and colourful. The prince could notice how dazzled the three kids seemed, staring at buoyant nature the likes of which are so seldom seen in The Isle, —or so he had read on the books—. Arrangements of yellow dahlias and bright indigo forget-me-nots growing wildly surrounded by the most vibrant shades of green and tangling their way up over the rock. At the centre of it, stood a statue of a man that John knew very well —as did everyone in the realm— his father’s figure standing proud and authoritative.
“Sherlock!” John said. Sherlock’s words of rage turned to sand inside his mouth, as he recognised the alarmed expressions on the people in front of him. He turned around and encountered the king’s kind and genuine grin beaming back at him. “Hi, I-” The blonde said as he placed a quick kiss over his forehead. The other fussed with his curls, but was otherwise unreactive. The information that had just been dumped on him was keeping him inert, nailed in place by its severity. John adjusted the strap of his bag, arranging his official blazer; but his eyes not leaving his boyfriend.
Irene was eyeing him expectantly, clearly anticipating Sherlock to bristle at that; everyone knew he hated when people somehow implied his heritage meant he had not really gained his machiavellian reputation on his own, when, in reality, those who witnessed him closely knew that if anything, the fact that his mother had been the The Mistress of Evil seemed to hinder his villainous carrier more than help it. But the boy —true to form— did the unexpected and laughed. That half-hearted chuckle of amusement he sometimes made when something had clearly went exactly the way he wanted.
“You were always a bit clever.” Was the answer the girl gave him. “But Sherlock…” She replied to the oldest sibling, but her gaze never left the boy. “He’s slow, but
in this situation. “You’ll be eaten alive.” She said. Another fact that John had no evidence to deny. He had no idea how the island worked, the inner system known only to those who were native. It was no giant leap to predict he would probably be robbed, beaten and completely helpless within two minutes of his arrival. This thought was not enough to deter him though. Seeing his determination, the girl sighed. “I’ll come with you.” She declared.
Stay weird and remember: imagination is the most dangerous weapon. -Impossible Element
at noon.” The tone she used left no argument on Victor’s side, but John still grabbed the opportunity to stare at him with a smirk. Silently amused that such a scary man was quickly subdued by a girl whose age was probably closer to his own than that of her pirate crew.
“It sort of does.” He counters, moving his head in a cocky expression. John pursed his lips, yet looked at him as if he were a challenge to be faced.
Lestrade appeared behind John.“Shit.” He said, and the violet-haired boy was bound to agree completely. Even if distress at the scene was inevitable, Eurus was best to be kept in sight.
He and his group had already turned their backs to walk away and take the longer way to the abandoned castle at the edge of the forest, when the man’s voice was heard again. “Sherlock.” He called, which made said teen turn around only to see him still standing there as an unmoving rod. “Yes?” The boy said when no further question came forward. Magnussen roamed his gaze all over his frame lewdly only to return to his face and smiled wickedly. “That’s enough, you can retire.”
The girl’s face —who could only be what Mycroft described as E.— remained impassive, her eyes not leaving John as she answered. “
Lestrade outright laughed at Anderson’s face, reveling in someone actually putting the royal in his place publicly. “Alright,” He said. “Practice’s over. Let’s go.” The other teammates grabbed their equipment, and arranged their blunt swords on their designated place. Anderson’s quick, embarrassed escape was the first good thing to happen in Greg’s day, so far. Founding a girl sitting on the side benches, excitedly talking over the phone, was the second.
