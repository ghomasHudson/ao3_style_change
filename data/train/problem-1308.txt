Sherlock continues his studies. When he notices Nyx becoming listless and bored he digs up as much information as he can on a cold case and does his best to solve it. It turns out that his best is really quite good. But soon there aren’t enough accessible cold cases to keep the rush going. He briefly considers a job in the police force and immediately dismisses it. Nearing the end of university, he is fast becoming aware that any normal job will not be able to feature Nyx, and he refuses to repeat the pain of boarding school. But they do need more of that rush.
Sherlock's expression says that he’s not sure he agrees.
Sherlock nods. Control is important to him. Even with cocaine, he was the one administering it. He had found the perfect 7% solution that only sharpened and enhanced his mind. But when he’d slipped into an overdose and lost control that had been… not good.
Mycroft doesn’t know about this place. He bolts the door. No one knows about this place except Sherlock. An empty back-alley-entrance flat, dingy and shabby, but perfect as a hideout. He has a few disguises stashed here, an untraceable pay-as-you-go phone. He used to keep drugs here, but that was before John.
(It isn’t.)
John considers getting out the bottle of whisky they have in the cupboard. But maybe not. The current situation — Sherlock’s horrible migraine earlier, the relaxed and happy atmosphere now — will make him want to tell Sherlock things he’s not sure he wants Sherlock to know. Of course, it’s Sherlock; he’ll find out eventually. But John’s made it this far. He’ll leave the whisky in the cupboard and delay the inevitable. Watching a Bond film is a safer option and, with Sherlock, a funnier one.
It’s a shot in the dark, but John’s face tells him that he’s hit the mark.
“All dull. And Lestrade won’t treat me the same way now. I saw his face when we gave our statements.” John probably thinks he didn’t notice.
The doctor explains John’s injuries and how they've treated him and Sherlock vaguely listens, but doesn't really. Lestrade is there to listen to the important parts for him. All he wants to know is when John will wake up, but when he asks the doctor’s answer is maddeningly vague: he doesn't know how long it will take John’s body to recover from the surgery. Sherlock gets a faint urge to break everything in the room (except John of course, John needs to be fixed) but it soon passes.
“Why would I tell you if that were the case?”
He opens the door, turns off the main light, pulls off his clothes. Sherlock follows his lead. He motions for Sherlock to change first. He doesn’t turn his back this time, just closes his eyes and tries to find his wolf. John doesn’t allow himself to look anywhere below Sherlock’s waist because they’re mates, and even when you’re standing naked in front of each other, some things should stay as private as possible. That’s what he tells himself. Really, he knows it’s because his dreams don’t need any more fuel. Sherlock is already drop dead gorgeous in them.
Then, as if someone’s flicked a switch, John’s energy vanishes. He flops down onto the bed. His body is rudely reminding him that he’s not slept for too many hours, and he’s not been eating enough, and the stressful situation is over, so it’s time to rest now, thank you very much. Vaguely he registers the shower turning off, and the sounds of Sherlock brushing his teeth and shaving. Damn it, he doesn’t want to disappoint him, but…
But even so, he’s at a loss. He’ll have to ask.
John is crouching down. He has a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. The wolf takes a step forward to sniff at him. John: safe, friend, packmate. The wolf calms. Sherlock calms.
Mycroft hesitates for the minutest of seconds before replying. Surprised (and he’s so rarely surprised). “Very perceptive of you, Doctor.”
“We’re home,” John prompts.
“In the best possible way.”
“Sherlock! I’ve got you, it’s okay, you’re safe now.”
Oh, damn it.
“Like that,” Sherlock says, breathless.
Confused exclamations from the path. John leads, leaping out onto the path into the beam of their torch. He’s puffed up, intimidating. Sherlock jumps out after him.
“No.” Should he offer tea?
“You know what, Sherlock? Just shut up.”
! I can’t see it.”
John turns sharply and paces in the opposite direction. He can almost feel time slipping away from them, from Sherlock. He knows how kidnapping cases work. Every minute, the chance of Sherlock being found decreases.
“How do you know so much, John? You knew what the bite meant. You knew to take off my coat and my belt. You knew when it would hurt. Most people hardly even know about the existence of Weres.”
The story is hard to tell. It’s hurting John. Sherlock wants to pull him up into his arms, but he knows that if he interrupts now, John might not be able to continue. He forces himself to stay still and silent. Just listen.
“I’m making tea now.”
John is bandaged up and still looks pale against the white of the hospital sheets. His eyes are closed. The regular beep of the heart monitor fills the silence. Sherlock sits in the chair next to his bed and takes his hand again, the cuts now treated and his knuckles no longer bloody. A tiny part of him is aware of Lestrade standing to one side and watching him but Lestrade is far from the centre of his focus.
“So do I. And what’s best for anyone going through their first change is the smallest amount of stress possible. Sherlock would never be happy in a specialist centre. He’d be out of his mind with boredom.”
He can almost feel Sherlock descending into the darkness of his black moods. He’s glad there are no cigarettes or drugs in the cottage. But he feels helpless. He decides to deal with this the Watson way, however flawed that might be.
“And now?”
Then John is out of his arms, blinking rapidly as water sprays into his eyes. The wild glint is gone.
Sherlock goes to his room to change, then leaves quickly, barely bidding goodbye to John. His wolf is perking up at the idea of activity before Sherlock even starts running.
Sherlock keeps trying. He can feel his wolf’s desperation to change, tries to link up with that. Minutes pass by. The wolf side of his mind is getting harder and harder to snatch at. John is silent. Suddenly something catches; he can feel his wolf. He scrambles to hold onto it, and keeps it for a second, but just as quickly it slips away.
“No,” John replies shortly. They’re silent for a while. “Yours will be better.”
“Just put some clothes on first!” John calls after him.
The wolf to the right of the leader leaps for him first, catching him unawares. He fights back, takes a few scratches, but then he’s knocked down by another. He scrambles up.
“Okay. I suppose not.” John relaxes a little.
. He wants to play. Sherlock wants to clean his paws.
John has a plan...
It’s working well so far. He can feel that his wolf is a little tense from the constant observation, but it’s not miserable. John has noticed the difference too. He’s happier, less worried than last night. He was right, too; the rain isn’t bothering them in wolf form at all. Even so, they naturally gravitate to the trees and the cover they provide. Scents are muted in the rain and it’s frustrating his wolf. It wants to smell as well as it could before. They can’t hunt and track like this.
He makes his way upstairs. He settles into bed and gets comfy enough to doze, but his rest is fitful. After a while, a noise wakes him completely. What was it? The back door opening downstairs. He keeps listening. He doesn’t hear it close.
......and the readers can't wait until the next chapter :)
John stands in the doorway looking at Sherlock, amused. Sherlock’s tail wags slowly against the floor.
John is making himself busy in the kitchen when Sherlock comes to collect his things downstairs. He actually feels the atmosphere solidify when John realises he’s there. His wolf feels it too. Should he say something? That they can forget it and carry on as normal? Is that what John wants?
“Not important,” Sherlock says, dismissive. “Mycroft is downstairs. I can hear him talking to Mrs. Hudson.”
“Mmm.”
John shrugs. “You need to accept your wolf for your own good. You know I think that.”
“Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I’ve always liked storms. I take it you don’t.”
Next update Thursday or Friday!
Sherlock nods against John’s shoulder, then winces. John squeezes Sherlock’s arm. The cabbie is looking at them funnily but cabbies tend to do that anyway. The whole way home Sherlock is making noises of discomfort. John wonders how he managed to ignore and cover up the pain for so long. Once they’re back, he guides Sherlock out of the cab and into the flat.
“Shall we go up to the beehives?” he suggests.
Then there is a wolf in front of him, smaller than Sherlock, its fur a soft grey with sandy overtones. Sherlock yips in happy recognition and bounds forward. He trips and ends up with his muzzle to the floor. Why aren’t his legs working properly?
"Yes," Sherlock replies eventually. "Yes, we have."
His anger is thick and barely leaves the room when he does. Sherlock stares after him.
His hands are in Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock looks at him, decides whether he wants it fast or slow today. He starts stroking John’s cock. Slow it is.
“Why don’t we just change?” Sherlock asks once they’re outside. “We’ll have better vision and surer footing in our wolf forms.”
John didn’t have anyone to help him. John is just trying to help. He’s grateful that he has someone and that it’s John. The problem is that John’s help is so woefully
“I want to change. I’m looking forward to it.”
John nudges Sherlock’s head with his muzzle.
He sucks on John’s sensitive spot and wraps a hand around his cock. John gasps and pushes into his hand.
“Yes,” Sherlock says, but broken-sounding, in the best way. “Like that.”
Sherlock wants to protest, but it’s true that he’s feeling fuzzy. Whatever unfamiliar presence is haunting the periphery of his mind palace is draining his energy. Sherlock rolls onto his side, facing John.
, they could have done anything. Stayed up for hours talking and slowly winding down with a bad film? John would fall asleep and Sherlock would wake him and send him stumbling sleepily to bed so he wasn’t uncomfortable in the morning. Or they would fall into the flat, and John would praise him, and Sherlock would swallow up the praise with greedy lips on John’s, and—
Sherlock’s voice is quiet. “Only for you, John.”
Sherlock leans over him to dig in a bedside drawer. John licks the chest presented to him.
“Oh, you will
John sips his tea while glaring daggers over the edge of his mug at Mycroft.
“Dinner’s ready when you are,” John says.
Mycroft chooses to turn up just as John falls asleep again. Sherlock ignores him. John is still his centre of attention. Mycroft goes away after a bit and Sherlock stays until he falls asleep as well, still holding on to John’s hand.
He’d love to stay, but he really does need to eat. He shifts away from Sherlock, who tightens his arm again with a noise of protest and wakes a bit. John gets out of bed and pulls on his dressing gown. When he turns back to the bed Sherlock is watching him, sleepy-eyed.
An old man with age-related insomnia out for a walk. Nothing unusual there. The slow, dragging pace he has to go at frustrates him, but he can’t break character. It takes him half an hour to make his way to Baker Street. He doesn’t enter the street itself. A few streets away is a rusted fire escape. At the top of that, he strips off the disguise so he’s in all black; then it’s a leap across to a ledge on the building opposite and a scramble up to the roof, and he has a clear shot, a simple run with a few jumps to reach 221 Baker Street.
“Oh, thank God,” Sherlock breathes, then flops on the bed next to John.
Sherlock nods. He gets up and goes to his violin. Obviously today will be a musical day.
“No. Don’t stop. It was just too much— I mean. I was too close.”
Staying away from the main roads, full of humans and vehicles, takes them on a long and winding route. They sprint across another road, and then they’re standing in the shadows of a park wall. John leads them along, sticking close to the wall, until he reaches a spot where they can leap up and squeeze through a gap in the railings.
, it means. Right, yes. Because he has to let his instincts guide him more in the city. Sherlock carefully takes a (metaphorical) step backwards and allows his wolf more control. He can feel its excitement at being let loose.

Sherlock couldn’t help but giggle to himself deliriously, which caused John to look over at him over his shoulder and beam a toothy grin. Sherlock’s stomach did a small somersault as he stupidly held up his phone, showing John what he was doing. John nodded and resumed the pose and held it, cheeky grin still present on his face.
It over-complicates an already ridiculously complicated plot that is on its way to becoming UNcomplicated.

Now let’s see the diner from Sherlock’s point-of-view: we know it is actually so much more than Sherlock not trusting John, OH NO. In fact, it’s Sherlock’s COMPLETE AND UTTER FAITH IN JOHN’S LOYALTY that worries Sherlock and thinks it will ultimately be John’s undoing. Sherlock is and always was concerned about John’s association with Sherlock puts him in danger. This makes John Sherlock’s ‘marker’
“– face again, Sherlock,” Sherlock caught John saying, clearly having tuned John out while he was silently brooding. “I know you don’t like it when I go to work, Love, but I need to do it for me.” John stopped in front of Sherlock and put his hand on Sherlock’s head, which sent an immediate jolt to his stomach, the butterflies immediately making Sherlock forget about his brooding. He sat up taller to push his head into John’s palm. He looked up, and saw John’s sympathetic smile directed at him. “It doesn’t mean I want to be away from you, Love. I just like helping people. Just like you do.”

at Sherlock with his stupid puppy eyes and cheeky grin and probably-so-soft hair fluffing in the breeze, and Sherlock just absolutely caved. Anything for John, always; it embarrassed Sherlock how easily John could get Sherlock to acquiesce to his whims. He didn't mind, though, if he was honest with himself. After all, more time spent with a happy John meant more pleasure and chances for “accidental” touches for Sherlock.
The point I’m trying to make is that John tells half-truths rather than full out lying – white lies, if you will. Sherlock

, therefore John must be bored and lonely and he’s going to be delighted when Sherlock returns!
But as I am wont to do, I overthink everything. I really sat down and thought about John’s apparent inability to lie. Which then spawned this meta.

Sherlock’s eyes look off to the side, as if he’s choosing his words carefully. He sighs heavily, then looks up at John again. “Because it’s true.” Sherlock gestures to his broken foot. “This happened because I’m a stubborn fool who does things without thinking it through…” Sherlock gulps heavily, “and because I want to impress you.” Sherlock’s cheeks colour a bit, trying to hide it by sitting up a bit so he can sip his tea. “The only reason I even went to cast it is because you told me to.” Sherlock picks an invisible fluff off of his own shirt sleeve. “Left to my own devices…” Heavy breath from his nose. “I’m lost without you, John.”
’s sequence, ALL of these characters are watching Sherlock’s thought train. HOW? John is the ONLY one who is the closest to knowing how Sherlock thinks and is able to follow his process. Mary, well, don’t get me started on that, and Lestrade just knows Sherlock does amazing things and that’s that. So how can they all be witness to this scene?
. Imagine this if you will: John gets stabbed / shot, shit hits the fan, Sherlock goes to John and presses their heads together muttering how much he cares for John. That for me is the start of canon Johnlock. It’s fanfiction fodder, but hey, we all have our headcanons.

His confidence started to rise as Mrs Hudson showed him all the measuring devices and how to prep each item that would go into the pie. He did have to concede that she was right – the preciseness of the recipe calmed his mind, enough that he even braved adding extra wine to the sauce, as well as some spice to the pie that he knew both he and John would like, which caused Mrs Hudson to praise him.
That sounded like a very agreeable plan. Plus, it would give Sherlock plenty of time to run to the flower shop, the bakery to pick up a cheesecake, and the candle shop to pick up the mood lighting.

The 3G scene will be a solo John-and-Sherlock moment: no Mary in the middle, no Mycroft meddling…  just the two of them proving SOMEHOW that they need each other in their lives. To me that would be even closer than the tarmac was: It’s Sherlock revealing to John that he does have a heart, that he just really cannot function to his best without John in his life. This will be John realizing that Sherlock actually

, I can’t believe I forgot about the Irene MP sequence, considering how important she is to the Johnlock arc. But yes, you are correct, the MP in the trailer is very reminiscent of that as well, and is probably the more likely sequence it is meant to be similar to. It actually probably proves much better that Mind Palace characters can interact with other mind palace characters, much like Irene did in Sherlock’s mind palace in

John is angry about the accusation of his inability to lie, don’t get me wrong, but I believe that, at this moment in time with his own emotions clouding his thoughts, John possibly thinks that Sherlock may have actually been following him around for the past two years,
shortly before John’s arrival. The beauty of Sherlock and John’s story is that they have both come into each other’s lives when they each needed each other the most; suddenly, along comes this strange little discharged army doctor with a limp who

“Oh, Sherlock, the mess you’ve made!” John said as he bent down to pick up Sherlock’s discarded dog, which gave Sherlock a nice view of John’s tight arse in those shouldn’t-be-fucking-sexy-but-they-are trousers.
“I don’t need children,” John replies. “I’ve already got you to look after.”
“It was never on,” John replies.
“I was not pout–ngh!”
“And did he say anything?”
Aware that he’s sticking out like a sore thumb, John swipes a hi-vis jacket and hard hat from the back of a pick-up truck. It will have to do for a disguise.
A left, a left, a right, a leap through a gaping hole in a fence. Sherlock hasn’t tested the limits of his newly-gained stamina, and the bite on his side is burning.
They move in sync through their normal bedtime routines. Laptop off, TV off. Windows closed and doors locked. Teeth brushed standing side by side in the bathroom. They undress but neither bothers with pyjamas. They both know where tonight will lead.
It sounds so simple and insignificant, put like that. Without John, he would still have managed, would have found out the necessary information on his own, escaped Mycroft’s meddling on his own. But with John, everything has been smoother. Easier to accept. John has soothed his headaches and explained everything to him and simply

It’s mid-afternoon. His sleeping pattern is fucked. Stomach rumbling, he wanders through to the kitchen. Bacon. He needs bacon. He’s cooking a second round of bacon when Sherlock appears in the kitchen looking sleep-rumpled, hair fluffy and messy. Adorable.
“Dr. Watson, do sit down,” Mycroft says smoothly when John enters his office.
“What will calm it down?”
“John,” Sherlock says, disapproving, but can’t work up enough energy for more speech.
John grins. “You may surprise yourself.”
Sherlock comes through to the kitchen messily dressed. He looks not entirely there. He must be processing last night. There’ll be a lot for his brain to figure out. John puts a cup of tea and a plate of food in front of him, sits opposite with his own and tucks in.
P.S. You made the right decision :)
“I… You… I didn’t…”
The first phone beeps. Connected to the network.
Sherlock twines both arms around John’s back and tugs him close against him. He wants them flush together, no space between them. He holds on tight.
“John,” Sherlock gasps.
It’s late (or early) and Sherlock is sleepy, sated. Tomorrow they’ll go back to London and… carry on like normal? Or tiptoe around each other awkwardly?
John looks grim. “Yeah, you’ll get that.”
They change and head out to the park again. Inside there are no signs of anyone, just the acrid scent of alcohol spilt in darkened corners, and the detritus of other, more unpleasant addictions. John leads Sherlock away from there quickly. They go to their patch of open grass. It’s much the same as last night. Play, run, fight. Having the space to be in wolf form and run is a heady, liberating feeling. He allows his wolf just a touch more control.
He pulls up, focuses his attentions on the head of John’s cock, his hand sliding around to work the rest of his shaft. John will be getting closer and closer with each passing second, so he takes it slowly. His hand slides smoothly up, slowly back down. His tongue laps, soft, gentle sweeps. The sharp taste of precum on his tongue and the sound of John’s moans are his reward, his praise. He
he feels. His hands find their way to John’s arse and he tries to pull him even closer. He can feel John’s firm muscles flexing under his hands, he can feel their ribs expanding and pushing together, he can feel John’s want in the way he bites at Sherlock’s lips and sucks on his tongue. Their mouths break apart when the pleasure builds too high. Sherlock stares hazily from under hooded eyelids at John, flushed, aroused, hair a mess. He loves him so much.
John leads them out of the yard and cautiously down the alley. London is so much noisier than Sussex. Traffic, roaring engines, sirens. There aren’t a lot more smells, but they’re different. Food, spices, dogs. No salt in the air, no sea. When they reach the opening of the alley, Sherlock has to pause as the sensory flood assaults his senses. John is waiting, anyway. They need to cross Baker Street. It’s late (or early), so there aren’t as many humans around, but there are still a fair number, and in cars too. John is poised, all attention focused on the road. He sees a gap, looks over his shoulder to check Sherlock is still with him and paying attention, then sprints across the road. Sherlock follows on his heels.
“To… to… I don’t know, manipulate me somehow! If this is real, what have you been doing to find him?
“Another time,” Sherlock pants in reply, distractedly.
He’s stronger and faster as a wolf, but as a human, he can use his gun. Changing is a vulnerable process, but he’ll have to do it at some point; Sherlock is probably tied up, and John will need his fingers to release him. Right. He changes back, dresses, and quickly sends a text to Mycroft describing the location and situation.
Sherlock whines in protest.
“If he tries to abduct you again this month I’ll break his bloody pompous nose.”
John undoes his shirt and shrugs it off, then pulls off the t-shirt he’s wearing underneath.
“It’s not… There’s no—” John sighs and searches for a way to explain it. “You pay no attention to your feet, normally. But if you stay very still and focus on them, you can suddenly feel the soles in a way you didn’t before.”
(He would wait until night, because the nurses on the night shift are incompetent and lazy. He would wait until the worst of his withdrawal was over, if he could, because then they’d check on him less often. If not, he’d wait until those still, nothingy hours around 4am or 5am. Swiping a key card would be child’s play. And from there it would be simple, only a matter of avoiding Mycroft once he was out.)
It goes like that. John manages to coax his packmate out for seconds, sometimes minutes, at a time and they have fun. Then he’s gone again, his humanity stubbornly in control. John is getting frustrated. He’ll fight Sherlock for real in a minute. Then his human side prompts him that it’s time to change back. Human John has been paying close attention to the progress of the moon through the sky. He’s ready to take control if his wolf won’t go back inside.
“I love it when you call me a genius,” he says. “Now get back here and kiss me again.”
tongue move back to him, but no wonder it drove all the girls crazy. It’s certainly driving him crazy now. He can’t help thrusting a little faster, a little harder, a little deeper. Sherlock's nails trace down John's back. John pulls Sherlock's legs up, around his waist, using that newly-discovered flexibility while also getting in a grope of his thighs. He slides in deeper with the new angle and they moan in chorus. Sherlock tangles a hand in John's hair, tugs, sucks a sharp mark on the corner of his jaw.
“I swear to God, Mycroft, if you’ve taken him like you tried to before, and this is some kind of scheme to—”
There. He hears the creaky step on the staircase. Not Mrs. Hudson with the tea; she’s much lighter. He wriggles out from under the duvet and listens carefully.
“No, just bruised.”
“Was,” says John.
“I have a
Sherlock slides his hands down John’s back to his arse and pulls him flush against him. Wet, naked John Watson never fails to make him
John rolls over and peers through the darkness. Another flash of lightning.
John settles down on his side and pulls the covers up over him. He’s exhausted. He won’t be able to resist the lull of sleep now that he’s lying down. Sherlock burrows under the covers and curls up in a tight, warm ball, pressed against John’s chest and stomach. Perfect. John’s hand slides into his fur and strokes him slowly, sleepily, and that’s more perfect still.
“You too,” John says, breathy, sounding how he sounds after they chase criminals.
“Yes.”
As the kettle boils, and Mycroft comes up the stairs, Sherlock starts up a racket on his violin. As much as he hates torturing his beautiful instrument like this, he knows that Mycroft hates it even more. John is clattering about in the kitchen. Sherlock grins from his chair as John selects the mug Sherlock likes least for Mycroft’s tea — a mug which has had several noxious experiments in it.
John is struck by that. He imagines that not too long ago Sherlock didn’t consider his future important enough to warrant making plans, much like John. And yet here he is, stating his plans, including John in them, like it’s the most natural thing.
Mycroft produces a tablet from his briefcase and pulls up the grainy video for John to watch. It’s over in perhaps ten seconds. Sherlock is walking when three men leap out of an alley and drag him in. More than a few punches are thrown, but Sherlock’s attackers had the element of surprise and a punch to his stomach knocks the fight out of him visibly. John rewatches the video three times over. The timestamp says 4:53. He had been sleeping fitfully at that point. He presses play again. The men are hooded, as Lestrade said, and cast in shadow by the streetlights overhead, but there’s something about them…
“You will be pleased to hear,” John says, after a few quiet moments, “that moonrise is quite early tonight. Late afternoon really. But we’ll wait until it’s fully dark. We have some things we can do until then.”
John packs away the first aid box. “Fine. But you have to let me stay with you. That way I can wake you up if you can’t change back unconsciously.”
After a few minutes Sherlock raises his concerns, never known to be one to willingly make himself uncomfortable.
“Maybe because you were pouting so much.”
A cup of water is placed against his lips.
“What did I just tell you?” John asks. “You have no choice.”
“Do you not agree, John?” Mycroft asks.
John’s finger rests over Sherlock’s lips, silencing him. Sherlock freezes. Too much?
He’s been keeping his thoughts steadily away from anything related to Sherlock’s beauty, or his attractiveness, or his sex appeal for ages. John can keep it in his pants when he needs to. He might not have admitted it to himself, but he’s been avoiding thoughts like that. He knows they’re really good mates. Best friends.
. WE see that, but JOHN
Mary as the ‘ghost’; oh yes. Mary has been the ‘ghost’ of heterosexuality that has haunted the Holmesian world since Doyle freaked out and inserted her into the story as a fiancé. Her ghost of ‘wife’ had many manifestations and was not always present, she just occasionally appeared as required to keep the story within the bounds of a straight culture. So ephemeral that she lost all identity as a strong character once she went from client to wife. Clearly in

We the audience know, however, that Sherlock’s intentions are a lot more deeper than trust, BUT JOHN DOESN’T KNOW THAT.
So why bring this up? Because it’s not only an interesting tidbit, but for me, it makes the initial interactions of John and Mrs. Hudson in
John gulps, inhales heavily, ogles Sherlock’s lithe form up, down, up again and stops his leering on Sherlock’s face. “I’ll say. Actual food, or you?” John jokes as he closes the door behind himself. He starts slowly towards Sherlock, his tongue licking at his lips.
Sherlock thought, flushing so red that he was pretty sure his clothes would catch fire. If that wasn’t one of Sherlock’s many fantasy lines coming from John’s mouth brought to life in unexpected ways, he wasn’t sure what was. He sat down on a nearby bench, wincing a bit as he realised he was now uncomfortably hard. He sat the bee plush on his lap to cover himself up and bit into his own corn dog delicately, nipping the top of the cornbread and dog off.
“Well, son, I must say that was impressive,” said the vendor as he reached up for the giant bumble bee plush. “Never seen anyone get perfect shots on all TEN. You would-a got this one with just 5.”
Sherlock squeezes John tighter still. “No.”

But in
“Oh, well, we wouldn’t want that, now would we?” John pets Sherlock’s arm as the other settles over his shoulder.
The outburst didn’t phase their not-their-housekeeper in the least as she stepped into the flat, her other hand holding a shopping bag. “Well of course you do, Dear, anyone with eyes can see that!” Mrs Hudson chirped as she placed the bag on the kitchen counter and started emptying its contents.
“Oh God,” John exclaims through a mouthful of pie. “That’s it, you’re doing the cooking from now on, Love.”
Now, I’m not sure if it’s ACD canon or fanon headcanons that John is incapable of telling lies and / or is a terrible actor, but
, right up until the final scenes of
They’d been here. But where had they taken Sherlock after? John spends over a quarter of an hour trying to find any trace of Sherlock that he can. There’s nothing in the depot. At last he lets out a frustrated growl. His human side forces him to make a note of the exact location of the depot as he slinks out and down the dark alleys towards home.
Sherlock crosses the room then, to the bed, to John. He proceeds to ignore all spare space on the bed and lies down almost directly on top of John, head resting on his shoulder. (John does nothing to stop him.) Sherlock breathes out a sigh against his neck. John feels an instant concern (panic) that certain parts of his body will start getting interested. He shifts a little.
Right, think. If he had kidnapped someone and brought them here, where would he hide? He wouldn’t choose one of the buildings still under construction. Too many people coming in and out; too much chance of being found. A completed building, then, unoccupied until the rest of the site is completed. Sticking to the shadows, he moves towards the small cluster of finished buildings. There are four. One has signs in the ground floor windows indicating it’s a show office, so he discards that one. He carefully studies the others. Would it make more sense to hide downstairs, with easy access but a higher risk of discovery, or upstairs, unlikely to be spotted by prying eyes? Getting Sherlock up all those stairs would have been difficult, whether he was conscious or unconscious. A basement would have been ideal. Hidden, but accessible. Do these buildings have basements?
Sherlock looks unsure, like he does when he knows he’s overstepped some unspoken social boundary and needs John’s help finding it. John decides to shift the topic of conversation.
As he always is when it comes to Sherlock’s health, John is right. His headache is so quiet now he’d forgotten to notice it.
Here are some things he knows for sure: it’s October, although he doesn’t know the exact date, but it hasn’t been so many days that they’re in November yet. He is in Serbia. Where exactly he doesn’t know, but they didn’t transport him so far that they crossed a border. His name is Sherlock Holmes. He will not tell them any of the secrets he knows. He is doing all this for his brother. He’s really doing all this to get back to London. He loves John Watson.
“No,” Sherlock says. He can tell something not good is coming.
“John, I—” he chokes out.
John pulls away to snuggle up, and Sherlock makes a noise of protest.
John sighs and rubs at his eyes. “I’m knackered. But you should change back before we go back to bed.”
“Don’t let me sleep too long,” Sherlock says.
“I know.” John reaches up and strokes his cheek gently and in a confusing wave of emotion Sherlock realises this might be a whole lot more than he thought before.
He considers it. “It won’t be impossible.”
“We can stay for longer if you want to, uh, hide out from Mycroft.”
Following the man’s trail takes him on a very circular route, through crowded Central London streets, then looping back and away from the city centre. Twice, Mycroft loses sight of the man’s trail, but picks him up again a few minutes later. They’re heading for an area full of office blocks under construction. CCTV coverage is more patchy there. Mycroft guides him towards the rough area where the man disappears from all cameras.
“How do you exist?” Sherlock ponders. Foolish question, but he’s lost any filter in the afterglow. It would be embarrassing with anyone but John. John just smiles. “I never thought I’d ever have a true friend, but you’re that and more. I couldn’t do this without you, none of it. I want to live the rest of my life with you. When we’re too old to chase criminals we’ll buy this cottage and retire to it, and I’ll look after the bees, and you can look after the flowers, and grow vegetables that I won’t eat, and write stories about us, and—”
Sherlock spits. That was what John smelt last night. He’s bundled into another vehicle, a family car, incongruous in the depot full of vans, but commonplace on the streets of Greater London. John pauses the video and scribbles down the digits of the number plate that he can make out. Then the car leaves the depot and the limits of the surveillance.
“Clean, uninfected and healing well. Let me know if it gets sore.”
“Christ, I should’ve known you’d be a nightmare in the bedroom.”
“So you connect to your wolf, like before, but you stay connected this time. There’s the urge to change. You hold onto that. Forget your human body, stay focused on your wolf’s desire to change, and you’ll just… change.”
John’s stomach clenches. He’s only just
“Mmnnghh thleepy,” repeats Sherlock.
There is nowhere else he would rather be, John thinks, as he sends a thought of thanks to the splinter that started it all.
“Lestrade won’t let you back on it until I tell him to, and I’m not telling him to until you’ve sat down, eaten a full meal, and rested.”
John takes it. It’s unlabelled. “What is it?” he asks.
The man moaning above him is shoving his penis too far down Sherlock’s throat. That’s normal. The fact it happens every time doesn’t make it easier to deal with. Sherlock forces a moan of his own; if he’s lucky it’ll earn him a little extra. He’s an expert at it now, has done it enough times. All his dealers know his supplies of money have been cut off, but everyone knows that there’s more than one way to pay. When one dealer takes things too far, Sherlock simply breaks away and finds a new one. He’s good at disappearing.
“I had a girlfriend in uni who used to get these terrible headaches,” John whispers. “This would soothe them a bit. Darkening the room helped too.”
“Fuck,” John says.
Lestrade to come around at all hours with cases. At this point he’d take a simple jewellery robbery if it would stop his skin from crawling. And then when he’s proved just how invaluable he is, when he’s built himself a reputation, he’ll have the luxury of being selective, only picking the best cases, the best brain-teasers. With a reputation like that, it won’t be long until he attracts the notice of London’s criminal underworld, and then things will
Sherlock changes something with a very decisive flick of his pencil. “Plenty of orchestras tried to recruit me. I wasn’t interested.”
Sherlock slips from the dirty alley checking the time on his phone. A little after midnight. He shoves his hands into his pockets, one wrapped around his phone and the other curled protectively around the flimsy plastic bag that he worked for tonight. Once he’s back in his flat he’ll be able to forget all of this; he’ll wash the taste away with a swill of mouthwash and the memories away with a chemical high.
. Wind in his ears. Rustles of night creatures.
“Sherlock, look at me. Good. Listen, this isn’t going to be easy. It’s going to really fucking hurt, but you’ll get through it. Understand?”
“That’s good,” John replies. “That means your Were and your human side are starting to accept each other.”
“Get it
They walk on in silence. Sherlock is considering what all of this will mean for his life now. Heightened senses, good. Headaches for weeks, not good. John doesn’t know what will happen to his mind. And his body? Being in wolf form doesn’t sound appealing, especially after the unbalanced, painful first time.
“I assume you’re here about yesterday’s fiasco.”
“I— Not very much.”
“Much,” Sherlock replies, pressing his lips to John’s.
Your patience will be well rewarded with this chapter I hope :)
Sherlock wraps his hands tight around his whisky glass. It doesn’t hide the fact that they’re shaking. John finishes off the last of the knots.
Sherlock takes a sip of the whisky. It’s good, slips down his throat with ease, burns pleasantly afterwards.
Sherlock pockets his own phone. “Let’s go,” he says.
“No,” they both say at once.
“Do you want to know how else I’m going to distract you?” Sherlock asks, looming over John. “I’m going to ride you slowly until you’re going insane with the need to come.”
“Listen carefully,” John says. “This is how you’ll change.”
Sherlock lies on the sofa later, hands steepled, eyes closed, processing. He’s already decided that he likes kissing a lot. He’s decided that he likes wet, naked kissing in the shower even more. As long as it’s with John, that is. He knows a lot of people, but he can’t think of anyone he’d want to do this with except John. And sex with John feels so much better than when he gets off by himself; the pleasure so much more sharp and focused, everything more electric. His fantasies didn’t even come close. He wants more of this every day, multiple times a day, even. Given John’s reputation, Sherlock thinks he’ll be willing.
“What’s happening?” Sherlock groans.
When they break apart for breath, he traces his fingers along John’s jaw. John turns turns his head to nip playfully at them.
“You’re welcome,” John says, because, as always, he is the one person who understands Sherlock best in this world.
“Something else?” John asks.
. When Sherlock reaches him, he drops to his knees and grabs Sherlock's hips, pressing his mouth open and wet against the bulge in his trousers.
Sherlock becomes withdrawn, sullen. His teachers tell the headmaster that he’s too clever, but the headmaster doesn’t know what to do about it. He allows Sherlock extra hours in the laboratory, turning a blind eye to most of the explosions, because it seems to keep Sherlock under more control than a classroom does. He tells the chemistry technicians to limit what substances Sherlock can get his hands on, but Sherlock is more inventive than they expected and the explosions aren’t averted. Sherlock has his own seat facing the windows at the back of the lab, ignoring whatever class is behind him. The happiest he gets now is a small quirk of his mouth when Nyx pokes her head up at the lab windows when no one’s looking, or the nights when he can sneak Nyx into his bedroom.
John slides a finger down Sherlock's cheek, smiling to himself. Sherlock cracks open one eye, does one of his quick-take-up-and-down observations.
“What?” John raises a hand to his face. Oh. The cuts. They’re hardly there anymore, just three pale red lines. “No. No, that was… It wasn’t Sherlock. He wouldn’t.”
Several hours later he’s finally approaching the time that Sherlock was kidnapped. He has a dreadfully stiff back, and has eaten most of a packet of biscuits.

Mycroft hangs up, telling John to wait for the specialised team and to call if there are any developments before then. John moves to the middle of a group of buildings, stepping silently, listening carefully. Almost all of the workers have gone home for the afternoon now. He hears the tinny notes of a radio floating towards him. Slowly he moves in the direction of the noise, pulling his gun out as he enters the skeleton of the building it’s in.
“I’m knackered,” John says as they leave, the staff locking up behind them. “Will you be cooking tonight?”
John swats him on the thigh, a light slap to reprimand him, and Sherlock freezes, eyes wide and body tense. Then he starts riding John again with renewed zest.
It’s an experiment, he’s decided. A constant experiment. Last night he took almost total control of his wolf, and it made him miserable, a human consciousness stuck in a wolf body that it was never meant to take complete control of. It made his wolf miserable too, able to run but trapped by the human mind that had taken over. Last night had been miserable all round (until he was allowed to touch John, and then John wanted him to stay, in his bed, and lay on Sherlock, and then his change — fascinating).
“I’m sure.” He is. John will make it so.
The walk back to the cottage along the coast path takes longer in the dark. Sherlock has to keep putting a hand out to steady himself on John’s shoulder, the bags he’s carrying tipping him off balance. John is always there to right him.
, John is going to lose his mind. He has seen Sherlock’s penis. He has touched Sherlock’s cock.
Dating hasn’t been that successful lately, and when Sherlock states things like that and John finds himself looking forward to them, he can see why. Nor has he missed dating. He has plenty of fun and excitement in his life with Sherlock; the rest he can take care of himself. Nor does he miss romance. He knows why, but he doesn’t think about that. His therapist might have something to say to that. But it’s fine. It’s all fine.
“All mine,” John repeats. “And I’m all yours. I love you.”
“But don’t you see, John? This is perfect. You know so much more than you’ve been telling me.”
. He looks like a statue or a work of art in one of the many museums that John was dragged around as a kid, that was he allowed to look at but not touch. But now, finally, he
“John,” Sherlock says. He seems almost nervous. “Will you kiss me again?”
Sherlock stares outside for a long moment, clearly debating whether to play along. Then he points out a man in a suit.
Sherlock pulls a face. “He doesn’t need to. I’m not on anything, and I’m fine.”
“What?”
Sherlock's hand, warm and slick with lube, wraps around John's cock. John's head thumps back into the pillow as he groans. One slow, agonising stroke later John is lubed up, and Sherlock is sliding down onto him in a smooth, endless movement. John swears, a long stream of every swear word he knows, including the ones he picked up in the army. Sherlock's eyebrows are slightly pinched as he adjusts to the fullness of John inside him.
Sherlock smiles and opens his eyes.
with Sherlock, because honestly nothing could be harder. So he lets him go. And ignores the pain in his chest as he watches Sherlock walk away.
“I need to return the torch to the pub, too,” John continues. “I’ll buy a couple for us in town while I’m there.”
He could flip them now, pin Sherlock to the mattress and take control. But he’s enjoying this so much. A part of him wants to see just how long Sherlock could drag this out for, how long he could tease John. At the rate they’re going now, it wouldn’t be very long.
It isn’t. In his mind palace Sherlock’s wolf is circling round and round his legs.
He turns to go back up to his bedroom.
, John,” Sherlock replies, spitting out the word ‘splinter’ with more venom than he usually affords the word ‘Mycroft’.
He goes back downstairs to announce that he’ll take the back bedroom. John will like the sea side bedroom. It has a desk he can write at and a large bay window with a window seat and a view along the coast.
Sherlock swoops down and steals his words with a kiss, hot and deep. “I know,” he says, when he breaks away again.
. Oh sure, he knows they’re friends, and knows John cares a great deal about him. But
they go to the Tarmac
I always wondered, why Sherlock is not with John and Mary at the cemetery. One explanation could be, that he hit his head while getting up in the plane. He could be unconscious and
The blush rises quickly onto Sherlock’s cheeks, no pinching required. “You like my lips.”

I wholeheartedly believe Sherlock has been pining for John since day one – and if not day one, then
The heaviness moves at John’s risen chest, snuffling and tickling his chin, a pressure squeezing his rib cage tighter in protest of John even daring to move. The weight settles again and hums contentedly, a rumble into John’s ribcage.

and marched to the stall, tugging the dazed Sherlock along behind him. Sherlock could only blink helplessly as he was pulled along like a limp noodle on a string.
Wait!
John just gives him that look, the one that occasionally makes him believe that John can read him just as well as Sherlock can read everyone else. Sherlock huffs at him.
“I was tracking vehicles most of the night. But there’s not much progress. We ruled out some of the possibilities, but we have no definite answers yet.”
They decide to start at the top of the hill and work their way down. They climb up to the trees at the top. After walking through the trees for a few minutes, Sherlock suddenly gasps and dashes ahead. John wonders what could have him so excited. There’s not a dead body up here, is there?
John grins and does so, sinks into the kiss and sinks into Sherlock. It’s hot, sticky, heady. He wants to suspend this moment forever. Sherlock is picking up John's best kissing tricks now, and John's never had anyone do
“Of course.” She rushes to open the door for him. “Just be careful.”
“I didn’t know you could lay a fire,” John says.
John opens his eyes. His pupils are dilated, eyes lidded. Sherlock has made him like this.
“Did you two have a lovers’ tiff?” she asks.
“I… don’t think I will,” he answers slowly.
“Christ, I didn’t…” Whatever John was going to say is bitten off by a soft moan.
Why must John cling to the belief that his life follows a normal path? It doesn’t, and hasn’t for a long time. That’s part of the reason he’s so intriguing to Sherlock.
“Especially for smugglers.”
“And packmates? Have you ever lost a packmate? Do you know how that feels?”
Sherlock drags John up, tugs him in by his belt loops. “I need you out of these right this second.”
“What is it?”
“Greg.” John needs tea. He goes into the kitchen to make it. “Talk to me.”
He didn’t want John to leave, to take himself away to bed alone. He wanted  John to stay with him, to bask in this post-case glow with him, to call him amazing and a genius and brilliant. His energy was
“For the last time, Mycroft, go away!”
“What?”
A few moments later Sherlock’s head drops down and jerks back up. John turns away to hide a smile.
. They play-fight. Sherlock tackles him back, gets back to his feet. He leaps at John. John puts up half a fight but lets him win. Pinned to the ground, Sherlock’s teeth at his upturned throat, he’s satisfied. He wants to make him happy.
“Here’s what’s going to happen next, Sherlock. Your body is confused. Soon it’ll force the change back to your human form. That’s gonna be painful. You may pass out. But we’ll get you to hospital, and I’ll be there for you the whole time, I promise.”
If anyone is interested in getting a tag on tumblr when I post a new chapter, let me know!
“I’m going out for a walk,” he tells Sherlock. “Text Lestrade and see if he’s got anything for you to do.”
“I didn’t say— I don’t— I—” John stutters and then thinks,
. He turns and walks to the door and Sherlock follows, stumbling. But by the time he reaches John, his legs are working properly. John noses the door open. Outside! Sherlock craves open space.
The sharp lights of the clinic’s corridors hurt Sherlock’s eyes, but outside it’s dusk and much more acceptable.
“I’ll let you know when. Your wolf will tire, and we’ll come back here. You just need to take over from your wolf again. Picture yourself in your human body. It’ll be easier because that’s what you’re used to.”
Sherlock doesn’t know why, but the wolf is thinking about Mycroft. It’s true that he’s been very quiet since he picked John up from work. Unusual for him.
“Not for anal, you numpty.”
He bites his lip to keep his moan from escaping. Never before has this felt so good. He tightens his hand around his cock, imagines John’s mouth on him. His hips jerk. Oh, God. John sucking him until he comes down his throat. Sherlock dragging him back up, spinning them so John is pinned against the tiles, wrapping his hand around John’s dick and stroking him, just like this, hand tight around him, with a little twist at the top of each stroke,
Being the only ones is hard when they’re growing up.
They walk along the coast path to the cottage, pausing to pick up some food in town. They don’t have much luggage, just a few changes of clothes each (they plan to spend a lot of their time naked or in wolf form) and Sherlock’s violin. The owner is pleased to see them back, says something about how they must’ve sorted out their little tiff from last time. Sherlock ignores her and takes their things upstairs. John joins him once the owner has left, slides his arms around Sherlock’s waist from behind, stretches up to kiss his neck.
John grins. “Okay. Play me Bach’s Partita No. 2. Please.”
“Fuck,” John echoes, apparently the only word in his vocabulary now.
He shuffles closer and presses up behind John, chest glued to back, knees tucked into the gap behind knees, feet pressed tops to bottoms. He wraps an arm around John's middle. John instantly relaxes with a happy sigh and leans back a little against him. It's almost perfect.
"So you don't like spooning," John says, and a back burner of Sherlock's brain starts wondering who invented the term. "That's okay. We've got plenty more nights to figure this out, right?" He finishes by shifting closer, his head tucked under Sherlock's chin, and closing his eyes.
“If you want to have an argument with Mycroft then you’ll need all your faculties. It’s late. Get some sleep.”
John’s planning today must be for tomorrow. He’s promised they’ll go out, and Sherlock is sure that he means more than just a stroll around London. They eat and Sherlock goes to bed much earlier than usual to soothe his wolf, wondering what tomorrow will bring.
Harry’s in a good patch at the moment, although John almost wishes she weren’t because it would give him something to focus on and deal with other than Sherlock. She’s back with Clara and they’re both fine with John crashing on their sofa for a couple of days. Sober Harry is far too inquisitive.
“Do you think Mycroft’s CCTV jurisdiction extends this far?” John asks, as they exit the station. “I hoped this would be far enough.”
“Bees, John!”
. A thought crosses John’s mind and develops horribly.
John’s eyes open. He shouldn’t be surprised — he knows Sherlock — but he is.
The piece runs chronologically. It begins with the first cottage section, the one that John heard before, long, low, and comforting. Then comes the first change. Gradually the cottage theme morphs, becoming something more complex, and then suddenly it’s completely different. This is Sherlock’s music at its most violently emotional, confused, uncontrolled, lost…
“Your bed will be cold. Your bedroom will be cold too; no one’s been in it for almost twenty-four hours. You dislike being cold when you’re trying to sleep.”
John sniffs carefully around the area. Yes, the vehicle had definitely stopped here. The scent of the oil is stronger; there’s a small puddle of it where the vehicle had been stationary. He tries to find Sherlock’s scent, or the scent of the other person whose blood was spilt. The wind changes direction, and John catches a whiff of Sherlock’s scent. He sprints across the depot. Somewhere around here… Yes, here. Sherlock’s blood, mixed with spittle. He’d been punched in the mouth, and spat out blood.
His joints aren’t meant to make that sound. Sherlock drops to his hands and knees and opens his eyes, and his hands are paws. His mind is slipping back, submerging into the wolf mind. He’s panicking. John told him about this, it’s normal, but it feels awful.
Sherlock can’t hold back his grin as he slides back up John’s torso, smudging kisses as he goes. John’s hand cupped around his neck drags him in for a bruising kiss, one where Sherlock can feel the electricity of lust and the coppery tinge of desperation. A quick shuffle of limbs and a second later Sherlock is flipped onto his back, John above him.
about them.
They’ve been at the scene of the double murder for about half an hour when John notices that something isn’t quite right with Sherlock. He isn’t insulting the forensics department with half as much vitriol. His deductions are about half their usual speed. Every time he glances at one of the floodlights lighting the scene he has to blink hard. He seems to be having trouble focusing on his thoughts.
John chuckles, and presses his lips onto Sherlock, caressing them, sucking on them, and finishing with a couple soft pecks. He pulls back, looks into Sherlock’s eyes. “You taste like cherry lip gloss.”

But, as Sherlock observed John's eyes light up, it seemed that John
A pillow hits John in the head. Apparently not; Sherlock sees John perfectly fine enough to aim directly for his head and have the pillow land on top of the newspaper he was reading so that it crunches out of his hands.

, and a brilliant one at that.

“Bah,” Sherlock replied, moving his hand to squeeze John’s that was in his hair. “Words are boring. People that aren’t you are boring.” Sherlock huffed. “Best be off, or I may have to keep you here forever.”
Sherlock lingers for a moment to be sure that John is staying put, then goes to the kitchen. Making tea isn’t hard, it’s just that John does it so well, without even being asked. The kettle clicks off and Sherlock pours out the water. He briefly considers ‘accidentally’ scalding himself to give John’s doctor side something to do — it will calm him and focus him — but no, the long-term discomfort wouldn’t be worth it.
“That’s bribery,” Sherlock complains. He still appears to be in a sulky mood. “I could just leave by myself and go to Scotland Yard.”
John comes to full alertness instantly. He sits up, and they both hear the inner door to the flat open and close.
“Idiotic,” Sherlock mutters. “I should have known where I went.”
“Alright?” John asks. He stays crouched for a moment more, then stands up and closes his eyes. His change is quick, unlike Sherlock’s. The wolf watches disinterestedly, but within it, Sherlock stares. Did his change happen like that? It looks monstrous.
“How was that?” asks John.
He rounds the next corner just in time to see a huge grey wolf leap out of the shadows into Sherlock’s path and sink its tremendous teeth into his side. Sherlock’s hoarse cry of pain is covered by John’s gunshot. The wolf falls, a seeping dark hole punched between its eyes.
“Are you trying to say I’m a drama queen, John?”
The flannel lands with a squelch near the door, and John settles over Sherlock and lets himself be kissed lazily but thoroughly.
Sherlock shuts up. That’s never worked before. John can practically feel the cold radiating from Sherlock’s feet. He shuffles down in the bed a bit (Sherlock is a lanky git) and puts his own warm feet over Sherlock’s icy ones.
Sherlock smiles and turns around in John’s arms to kiss him properly before pulling away.
Sherlock promptly starts up the cliff face, climbing around over toward the sea. John can see his goal: there’s a cave hollowed out of the rock which is probably much more easily accessible at low tide than it is now, with the sea halfway up the beach. John makes sure their picnic bag is secure on his back, then climbs after him, hoping he won’t do anything as stupid as falling off onto the rocks below.
“It was in Afghanistan,” Sherlock replies. “Around the time you were shot, possibly at the same time. Your first proper change was difficult. I assume you were still recovering. You implied that your body forced the first change.”
Sherlock nods slowly. “You are the expert in this case.”
“You may find this of use,” he says.
John's wince brings him back and he glances up at John who looks far too pale, and his eyes are dimming and closing. He thinks he begs John to stay awake, to stay alive, to wait for the ambulance. John just about stays conscious, but he hasn't said anything, which Sherlock takes as a very bad sign. Somewhere, his brain is pulling up facts and figures and calculating long-term injury chances and survival rates, but he ignores it. Then his hands are being pushed aside by the paramedics he hadn't even heard arrive and he's told he's done all that he can for John as he watches them tend to John's injuries as best they can and then peel,
and it’s no wonder he ends up beating the shit out of a CIA guy who threatened his not-housekeeper-but-might-as-well-be-his-mother because

However, after 3 seasons, nine episodes, and countless evidence on screen to the contrary,
Sherlock must have seen something that pleased him, because his eyes twinkle, and the eye corners crinkle in that way that they do when Sherlock is genuinely, truly happy. He pulls John’s head to himself again, and touches their foreheads together, closing his eyes and breathing through his nose. Sherlock’s arms come up around John’s neck and plays with the hair at the base of his head tentatively. It sends a shiver down John’s spine, which Sherlock must feel, because Sherlock continues to do it a little more confidently.
“Really?” John’s voice intonates as he feigns incredulity, which for some reason always flies right over Sherlock’s head. “And what would make you not bored?” John starts to get up out of his chair and heads to the kitchen to make some tea.

filled his space again as John leaned over to kiss his forehead. “Thank you, Sherlock,” John replied, caressing Sherlock’s cheekbone as his hand brushed down to Sherlock’s shoulder, where John squeezed gently. He wandered over to the spot Sherlock had directed him and bent over, his trousers pulling tightly around John’s beautiful, muscular arse, and bunched up suggestively near John’s groin, from the angle he could see.

after adding this little scene to my repository of “Mrs. Hudson is more perceptive than the boys give her credit for”, it just adds THAT LITTLE EXTRA to John’s façade of “I’m moving on” when he’s clearly not.

, shields up. Sherlock shakes his head, blue light is hidden from view, but Sherlock’s cylinder is still glowing. And John’s cylinder is… conveniently placed. I don’t know. What am I supposed to make of that? John’s reaction here is why I think he may have had an internal monologue going while in the loo.
“John, I’m serious!”

He sets about to light the candles around the flat, closes the curtains – it would be dark in an hour or so anyway – and starts a fire. He pushes their chairs closer together, setting them at perfect 45˚ angles to the fireplace. He walks back to the table to realign the utensils, then pops the cork on the wine to let it breathe.
