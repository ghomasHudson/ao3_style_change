And so they did, managing to teeter through the flood and up the stairs. At least it was stairs they had to climb and not a ladder, although the detective's overactive imagination provided several suggested images of that averted disaster. Combined will and determination supplanted missing balance and strength, and together they worked their way up the narrow steps.
As I was about to take a step back to look him in the eye and better read him, he at once wrapped his willowy arms around me and pulled me into his embrace.
"Yes, I know, I should not be out of bed, and certainly not down here," he said as he slowly retreated to his chair, waving off my offer of assistance. "I could easily have fainted coming down the stairs, and you are far too tired to be scooping me up out of a broken heap on the landing."
At last, the engine destroyed itself by launching all three of its exotic pistons out at once with a dense boom so low and so loud that Holmes flinched under the sound as much as the great burst of force. One of the rocketing pistons shot straight up into the air, all the way through the top deck of the ship, leaving the black of the night above just visible in the hole remaining. The other two pistons burst out at both sides, piercing the hull simultaneously as thin, cylindrical cannon balls.
The second kiss that followed was at Watson's initiation, and was cut all too short by Holmes' embarrassingly amateur mistake of forgetting to breathe. It was different than the first: rougher, wetter, with more weight and force behind it; a quicksilver amalgam of heat and release and, above all things, belonging.
"Would you continue moving your shoulder, Watson? Small to medium range motions only, please. Slow and easy."
"To be honest, there is not much to tell you, Holmes. My arm is somewhat limited now in its range of motion and my shoulder aches with overuse or humid weather. The fever mercifully took any memory I had of the event itself, but I can show you the scar if that is what you are after. It's not pretty, but I doubt you will find it grotesque enough to be interesting either. It is a gunshot wound, nothing more or less. Do you wish to see it?"
Watson caught his open eyes over the pages of his book. The doctor tucked his marker into the yellow-backed sea melodrama he was reading by the light of the small bedside candle.
"You're wrong, you know," he said. "I did stop. For years I have had not a single drop. That abstinence was not initially of my own volition, I will admit. A clean and reliable supply of my vice became impossible to source while changing cities and faces every few days. I gave it up all at once in one long week at a remote country inn outside Bratislava."
I was meant to understand something from this small device he'd given to and taken from me, perhaps a good many things. If the object of a crime belonged to anyone else, Holmes would be eager to tell me about it at length, following the relentless cascade of detail and logic down to its inevitable source. But this evidence was mine, the theft his, and the meaning behind any of it confused to missing, at least to me.
"Take my arm. Keep your head low. We have to get up on deck," he said. If they were going to wobble, they would likely be more stable if they wobbled together.
"It matters not at all what remains the same about the object from when last you possessed it. All value lies in what has been altered in the interim."
"I remembered serious stimulants are often as terrifying as they are invigorating. I remembered how much I once loved that intoxicating sensation of dancing on the fine edge of the blade, never quite certain on which side I'd fall. That dark pleasure may well be lost to me forever. All I felt tonight was fraught."
Holmes said nothing else and instead stood to fill his pipe again. This was a thinking problem for him, as all were. He struck a match and blew out a long thin line of fresh smoke.
Shock and horror probably would have been the correct responses to viewing Thorne's grotesque demise, but Sherlock Holmes had no time for such indulgences. He was far too busy tangling with the awe induced by the still-raging murderer itself. The prototype engine screamed with a violent metallic roar and threw off its brushed steel cover in pieces, the first of which careened barely a foot above Holmes' head and bounced off the back wall. Another splash of sparks erupted and the spilled hydraulic fluid finally caught in a spectacular blue flame that spread quickly to the machinery. Black smoke poured from every crevice.
A violent hand tore the heavy gunny sack off of Holmes' head. Light flooded everywhere around him instead of existing only as what little managed to flicker through a jagged nail hole in sackcloth. Holmes' readjusting eyes stung as he winced against the glow, barely able to see. At least there was fresh air for his deprived lungs now instead of naught but his own hot breath cycled back to him. His temples pounded while he blinked and fought to regain his bearings.
"That does not make those symptoms any less hazardous. What are you feeling? Here, take this thermometer."
I watched the hands snapping forward. Four hours, nineteen minutes. Eighteen. Seventeen. I used to love sitting in silence beside him like this. Now I found it intolerable, and I broke it with more anger than I realized I'd been holding.
There were so many things I should have liked to tell him at that moment. But I was well beyond the ability to speak by then.
If John Watson did still breathe, it was so shallowly as to be imperceptible under the mahogany tweed of his coat, at least to Holmes' bleary eyes. He lay unmoving on the ground on his side. His clothing was damp and a dark halo of blood and broken glass spread about at his head. Holmes' attempts to wake him garbled to gibberish behind the gag down his throat.
Before he could notice, the footsteps were loud and directly beside him. The tiny flame of Watson's reading candle blew out. From the forbidding dark that remained, a voice came, empty and cruel.
The man slapping him with all eagerness was one Evander Thorne, brilliant Charleston engineer and perennial hard luck case. That the credit and possession of his prized creation, the prototype engine of the Friesland – a technological marvel by all reports – was swindled away from him was pitiable. His reaction to this duplicity was decidedly not. Two shipwrights and an innocent sailor laid dead already, sprawled across the Southwick docks. Left to his devices, Thorne's plans were to make Holmes number four.
"One of the places. I had a number, as you are aware. The morocco case, the spare needle in the desk drawer, your medicinal supply in your bag upstairs. Somehow it was easier to ignore those in plain sight and effortless accessibility. But tonight there it was, my hidden cache preserved. I was compelled by the idea that once I valued that bottle so highly that I stored it among my few most personal artefacts, yet now I had forgotten about that choice entirely. How could that be? What else had I allowed to fall through my grasp? I had to try to remember."
"Holmes? No, don't fight," he said as the detective sputtered and struggled to keep his face out of the depths. For his part, Watson seemed somewhat invigorated by the brisk sea, perhaps benefiting from his rugged Northern blood. "Let's roll you onto your back. There, that should be better."
"Perhaps you were saving it for tonight. If you are amenable, Watson, I propose that you open it, and if you are feeling so generous, I propose that we share it. Lieutenant Durand gave you this gift as an honour to you. I should like to share in that honour if I can. And, if his French surname is any indication, the lieutenant's choice of cognac has hope of being quite decent. If I can, I should like to share in such quality liquor as well."
Holmes, determined to prove his capability, rose to his feet in the now shin-deep water and shook out numb leg muscles uncomfortably reluctant to support his weight. Unable to prevent it despite every effort, he stumbled back into the chair. Holmes knew his legs, prickling from a thousand invisible bee stings, needed only to get blood back into them to function, but they seemed to take it from his brain. The world had a curious slow spin to it. When he moved his head, reality took a moment to snap back into position.
He waited, listening. After a time, the sound of footsteps returned to the hallway. But these steps were wrong in their details.
"A good partner should have a reliable timepiece to arrive promptly when he is needed," he said as he handed it to me a week later with no pomp but a wry spark in his eye. I told him I was honoured, and I was.
But if that was the intent, why didn't he follow through with it? A week we trekked through the Rhone valley and the Swiss mountains after that day, with Holmes as filled with energy as he could possibly be and I filled with trepidation. He could have abandoned me easily as I watched behind for our pursuer and not ahead at him. As clever as he is, he could have tricked me and left me behind a dozen times over.
"But why would you steal my watch? I would have simply given it to you if I'd only known you had use for it."
"I genuinely thought you would find your way to it, or at least the more salient points. But I let myself forget that too, the guidance you require for even such basic deductive reasoning. Careless of me. So much carelessness."
Faint, at best. Watson gave no response to his name repeated in increasingly frantic rasped tones. At his side at long last, Holmes dropped hard to his knees, his broken arm dangling useless at his side. The detective pressed his still viable fingers to the side of Watson's throat to discern a pulse, slow but strong, and Holmes exhaled a breath he had not realized he'd been holding. The doctor's eyelids flickered open.
<< As I always do, John >> Sherlock replies, reading a message just received. << This is the difference between you and me: I can control my emotions, you don't >> Sherlock says and the look of superiority that he dedicates to him does not like the ex-soldier at all.
<< Sherlock brought him here to get him used to the people >> says the waitress. << Can I give him a piece of bread? >> whispers to him the girl, as if it were a state secret. John looks at the puppy, that tilts his head to the side curiously.
<< I lost my good boots to save you and you, cursed, lied to me! >> she says throwing the trolley on him. Sherlock promptly grabs it, miraculously saving his leg from suffering the consequences.
<< Do not make me come to get you. You may not like it >> she says and a note of anger dirty the fake sweetness. Furious, Sharon opens the closet doors and Morgan leaps to her face .
<< Of course my novel are more violent, but I wonder know if she read her novel to you. Those scenes of sex and those of violence have not disturbed your soul, nor that of the members of the club, evidently >> she says, hitting a vase by the baseball bat, sending it into a thousand pieces. William, holds Morgan tight.
<< The chief commissioner wanted me here, Anderson. If you want to feed the wrath of Lestrade, go ahead >> Sherlock replies by opening the door of Margaret Ford's studio.
<< I ask you to forgive me for what I said. I have not been informed that you are not kidnapped with your parents. I am happy that you are safe. I will do my best so that everyone will give their best to bring your parents home, I want this to be clear to you >>.
<< Taking care of our Morgan. We are entrusting you with an important piece of our life together >> says Sherlock, taking John's hand.
<< Tell your dog to end it! >> shout out the man, trying to get closer to his wife, but Morgan growls even more, causing him to back away.
'I saved her'. This short sentence pronounced by George's immature voice has the power to take John's breath away. Disconnected images of a distant past come overbearing to him. John tries to chase them away, but he can't. His gaze fixed on George, who dried the embarrassed tears that streaked his face. This kid experienced something very similar to what he experienced at his own age. John is very sorry for this. He coughs to swallow the lump that has formed in his throat and tries to ignore Sherlock's gaze on him.
<< Call Lestrade and get it over with >> John says to Sherlock, looking disgusted at his hands skinned by his fists.
<< Aren't you going to be a damn pervert? >> the woman thunders furiously, rising in all her greatness.
<< Thanks, Mary >> he whispers to her and she with a smile applies the vial to the IV. Slowly the drops descend along the tube. Sherlock watches them enter his body through the needle planted in the hollow of his arm. It only takes a few minutes to feel the pain subside. The leg no longer exists and the abdomen relaxes satisfied.
<< We had a… pretty heated discussion before my departure >> he says embarrassed. << I just haven't seen him before leaving, actually. You know what him is like when he decides to go crazy >>.
John doesn't know what to argue. It is a delicate situation that should be handled delicately. But just looking around to understand that there is no room for delicacy within those walls. The staff of this medical prison will stuff Mary with drugs and let her die slowly. John realizes that, even by setting in motion all the knowledge that both he and Sherlock can have and by paying the best lawyers, the situation will not be different from that. Even if they'll managed to make Mary accuse of the only murders of family members.
She doesn't have a lawyer, for example, nor did she obviously ask for it. The one assigned ex officio will only arrive in three days, God only knows why. On balance, anything could really happen to her amid the general indifference of those around her.
<< Rosaline has always shown us of her creations, proudly. Every evening before dinner it is a real parade of sheets of paper >> the father smiles.
<< Oh, you are one of those idiots who teaches idiots to jump down from the mountains with toothpicks on their feet. It takes a lot of courage to call them skis! >>.
"If those desperate people can have you ... why can't I have you too?" he thinks, staring too insistently, he realizes it, those beautiful lips that from the first moment hit his attention.
The cell phone warns him that he has received a text. Sherlock reads it and carefully observes the video that Lestrade sent him
<< Your children defend you, and a parent defended so heartily can only be a good parent. Not only. Your children want to protect you. They acknowledge that you have been able to endure so much and that you are tired. As Dr. Watson said, however, they are young and still inclined to take upon themselves faults and responsibilities that do not belong to them. This also shows how well you have educated them to respect and a sense of duty. I therefore believe that you are blaming yourself that for a blame that isn't yours. I think you have already received too many, absurd blame and that therefore you can exempt yourself from doing the same. My brother >>, Mycroft says, pointing at Sherlock, strangely silent and too still, << acted in an attempt to save the salvable and do justice to everyone. Fulfill the desire of your children to keep you out of further worries and resolve a situation, which turned out to be too complex without the right means, trying not to cause you trouble but only bring you good news. It is not the first time that I tell you how I think Sherlock consider you an older brother much better than me >> Mycroft says, taking a look at Sherlock who just shifts his gaze to his feet. << And it is not even the first time that I thank you for what you have done for him in the past and for what you are still doing. So allow me to do you the favor: you saved my brother, let me do everything I can to resolve the unpleasant situation in which your daughter found herself stuck >>.
<< You risk being late in the clinic, John >> says Sherlock, typing frantically on his cell phone. John looks at the clock on the clock and mutters a curse. He should already be washed, dressed and on the street by this time. He finds out that he doesn't give a damn.
<< Do you really want me to stop? >> John asks him, with a tension in his voice equal only to that which he feels in the pants of both.
<< Fortunately, the intelligence is inherited through the mother >> Sherlock winks and the boy smiles. << Did she tell you to lock yourself in the closet? >>. William nods.
<< I do not hide you, gentlemen, that the conditions of Mr. Holmes are not the best >> the colleague who has Sherlock under treatment told them. << We found morphine residues in the blood and from the coloration of the sclera of the eye and nails it seems that it has been given too much and for too long. Also for this reason the heart rate has still slowed down, despite the body's homeostasis being brought back to normal. This difficulty in waking up is yet another confirmation and that is what worries me most of all. Then, another element not to be underestimated, is the right leg. A fairly simple fracture, in truth, which, however, has been treated very badly. The bone was welded in the worst way, given the incorrect traction to which it was subjected. There are several broken ligaments and muscle tone has significantly decreased. Mr Holmes should be operated to avoid a permanent limp which would compromise the quality of his life. From what you writes on your blog, Dr. Watson, Mr Holmes is athletic, agile, used to running and fighting if necessary. With a leg reduced in that way, he won't be able to do any of this anymore and, unfortunately, until he wakes up and his heart will beat again properly, I can't do anything for him >>.
<< Thank you, Mr. Holmes. This is an advance on his compensation >> he says, taking away a check that he offers him. John intercepts the check and his breath breaks as soon as he reads the amount. << And I will reserve you a suite here in the hotel >>.
<< Well ... it may happen that an artist has a block or that she work on something so intimate that she still do not want to show it before she have given it shape >> says the father, passing his hand embarrassed on the neck. The mother cries silently, her eyes downcast and her hand, pressed to a handkerchief, pressed to her lips.
<< Even his nose may not work >> retorts John, acid and tired. << It is not even clear which is his front and which is his back >>.
<< How dare you laugh at me? >> shouts the woman, raising her big hand over her head ready to vibrate the blow.
constantly and he is aggressive not only with words >> Sherlock says, looking at the women that quickly lower their gaze. << Obviously >> notes Sherlock. << Madame, you said you peeked. What did you see? >> asks Sherlock to the cook.
<< If tomorrow there will still be blood in your urine I will have to find a solution, Edward >> She says, going away with great heavy steps.
"Dying is what people do!" he shouts in his crazy voice and then chuckles satisfied. "A quick blow and you will get rid of her presence forever" entices him and the hand increases its grip around the handle.
Sherlock quickly reaches the Sharon Milton's home, an attic studio apartment located in a poorly maintained building in the White Chapel neighborhood in eastern London. Sherlock climbs the five floors of stairs that lead him to the attics and finds John waiting for him on the threshold of the apartment in the company of Greg and the forensic department's men. Anderson's men do not even wait for the order and, as soon as they see him, they leave the small room to stop and chat on the stairs.
<< Of course >> the old man says, going to the cash desk, where a huge woman is about to deposit the contents of the overflowing basket on the counter.
<< Listen to me! >> asks him, shaking his hands. << Before meeting you at the Bart's, that afternoon six months ago, I sat every night with the gun in my hand on the miserable bed of the shabby apartment of the pension where I lived. I looked at the gun, felt its weight, the cold iron that never heats up completely in contact with the skin and I tried to give the order to my left hand to bring it to the temple and shoot. I had lost everything, Sherlock. Everything I had fought for. The brilliant militar career that opened before me, a satisfying job, the large family of fellow soldiers and superiors of which I now felt part of. All lost, due to a rifle shot fired by I don't even know who during a war that didn't belong to me. This was enough. I was no longer able to serve, so they discarded me with a medal, many beautiful words and a poor pension. I couldn't stand it. Not because of the effort of getting used to civil life again, as Ella says, but because I felt rejected, abandoned, thrown away like a broken piece that can no longer be used. You picked me up, Sherlock. You gave me a place to stay, the chance to still feel useful and to continue fighting a war that I feel most mine, this time. For you I'm not a broken piece. You also healed my psychosomatic lameness within an evening simply by giving me confidence. You went beyond the pitiful lame that everyone saw, the war veteran who, poor man, must reintegrate into society, even if I was a criminal who came out after years in prison. I owe you my life, Sherlock, because if I hadn't met you, one of those evenings my left hand would have obeyed the order and I ... now I wouldn't be here >>.
Sherlock sits on the bed and looks around, disoriented. The broken leg sends him a painful tingling muffled by morphine, but still capable of blocking it there.
<< You no longer demand anything! >> shout out the woman, in a tone capable to silencing Morgan. << I have had enough, Albert, and this story made me realize that I wast too much time. Whatever you want to tell me you can communicate it to my lawyer >>.
<< You saw you too, Captain. That woman is big and strange, but she has the soul of a child just six years old. If she had rescued someone would have told me >>.
John arrives at 221B with the mood under his heels and that pain in the abdomen more insistent than ever. He will have to take a gastric protector, otherwise he risks an ulcer, which is not a welcome prospect. He takes a long shower feeling the need for hot water to relax his neck, his shoulders contracted and to wash away his thoughts. When he comes out the bathroom, John finds the consultant sitting in his armchair. John nods and puts the kettle on.
<< Try once again to do one of your games as a seducer with my daughter and I will forget that you saved her, did you understand Fox? >> he says, hitting him on his chest with the accusing finger.
<< I ... I do not think that the car ended immediately in the precipice >> says John, his eyes fixed on the trunk of the tree against which the car impacted. << The car remained in the balance, Greg >> he says running to the trunk. << It remained in the balance and must then be collapsed down, driven by the storm >>.
John enters the bathroom and closes the door behind him.Sherlock remains for a moment staring at the opaque glass wondering what the hell a Sylvan elf is. He then shrugs and retrieves one of his suits from his closet. He sits on the bed and, armed with needle and thread, prepares to modify it for John.
<< I agree with you, Fox >> says Greg peremptorily. << You have been exceptional, but it can become dangerous and I don't want to worry about you, ok? >>. George snorts, but nods, agreeing to return to his mother in the company of his sister.
"Oh, Sherlock, would that be so reprehensible?" Moriarty asked him, with that perennial laugh in his voice. "The best are crazy
John's throat dries instantly and the stomach draws all the blood from the body. He turns his gaze to Sherlock standing still, his arms crossed over his chest and his serious eyes fixed on him. John realizes only now that he is wearing a dressing gown. The dressing gown and ... nothing else.
<< Because when something circulates on the web it expands quickly and even if you weaken it, it creates emulators with impressive speed >> he says, calling his hand back to himself. John lets it go with regret and gets up immediately after him, following him to the living room desk.
<< Instead, I have to go back, damn it! >> Greg snort, by returning the communication to the colleague. << That damned case. Apparently something new has happened and they need me on the field. Jesus, Mycroft, you can't imagine how much I miss your brother's help right now >> he says, bringing a cigarette to his lips. He starts to light it, but the lighter does not cooperate and before a nervous breakdown catches him, Mycroft intervenes to help him. He triggers the fuse of his golden lighter right under Greg's nose.
Sherlock’s silence transformed into gasping, shocked breaths, and finally, moans that made John’s blood run hot. All at once, Sherlock’s hips lost their tight movements, now pushing up into John’s mouth, and back against the finger lightly circling his entrance. Sherlock thrust back,
Sherlock must have grabbed the bot just as it had undocked for its route, causing the alarm system to believe the bot had been disabled while out in the field.
He’d scoff appropriately at John’s lackluster writing skills, but, if he were being honest, he rather enjoyed John’s embellishments. Quite a lot, actually.
“Right on both accounts,” Sherlock said a minute later. “And you would know a lot about cornering people, wouldn’t you?”
Shaking her head, “I’m afraid I’m not in that business. Besides, that spell is far too strong for the likes of me.”
The man nodded with enthusiasm. Good, Sherlock thought, getting right back into the swing of things then -
“Fine! Fine,” Sherlock relented. Closing his eyes, he breathed in deeply, lifting his chin. John pulling up his sleeves made his scent stronger, somehow. It was everywhere. “Sit down, in case you get lightheaded. And take your jumper off.”
He turned away, so as to hide any expression that might give himself away. He idly fussed with his hair in the mirror. “He seemed …interesting.”
Watson eyed him with ever growing curiosity. “And,” Sherlock continued, feeling brave, “just ‘Holmes’ will do.”
As he was now very familiar with John, he could see even before the usual tells that John found this all rather painful. Wilkes was speaking to John now, pumping his hand enthusiastically while gripping his forearm with the other hand. Wilkes began to usher him about the room, showing him off to the others. John smiled tightly and inclined his head with each introduction. John hated it, he hated this – and yet, he had come. Why had John come?
It was only a boat store. Here were the ropes and blocks he had originally anticipated, and with luck, he found a ball of twine.
Pleased with herself, the Witch walked over, and stood on the tops of his feet. And, with a mouthful of dog hair, John held her by the arms, and took a step.
“Lovely motive, still considered breaking and entering - however, there won’t be any trouble, I just want to ask you some questions,” he said, holding his hands out in what he hoped was a placating gesture.
“Well, that’s one way to do it,” John said with a laugh. He also preferred a book to a projected screen, but wasn’t sure if there was any actual reading getting done at that rate.
John!” Sherlock exclaimed, hands raising in the air, their earlier agitation returning swiftly. “That’s not important right now!”
Once the job had been done, Watson smirked at him. “I can see why you might have been picked by thieves. I mean, aside from being in the wrong spot at the wrong time.”
He had made John angry clearly, but John was making him angry, so as far as he was concerned they were even.
Sherlock knocked on the door, which was answered shortly after by Doctor Murray himself. A very unremarkable looking man (army medic in the past, struggled when he first returned to English soil, now happily married with one child, a boy of seven, etc.), and yet all signs suggested Murray held the key to confirming or disproving the current life-saving verdict.
were. Things he himself had put into John’s mind again. He might as well have dug up the woman’s grave and forced John to look at her painted corpse.
“What do you mean?” John asked. “You don’t even know what the spell does until you solve it? God, you really must be a genius to get anything done like that.”
“That would be me.” Sherlock stood up from the table and walked over to take the note from Archie. “To have multiple addresses, one needs multiple names. Tiresome, really.”
It was sweet, in a way, that SH believed with their entire seemingly logical mind that vulnerability would need to be taken into consideration. Naive, even, though John doubted SH would like to be described that way. SH was clearly experienced, and not innocent in that regard.
But the scarecrow insisted, and Archie was happy to have more company. He tied the scarecrow’s stick to his waist with his jacket, and John accepted that his fate for the day was to serve others.
Sherlock opened his mouth slightly, and pulled back his lips till his sharp teeth could press in. Sherlock, embarrassingly, gnawed for a moment without effect, before gathering himself and pushing through.
“Sebastian,” he said, and he was impressed with himself that his voice did not waver. If he wanted it enough, he could be the image of coolness and apathy. “Thank you for input.” He pulled the door open, and planned to hold it that way till he could close it behind the other man.
Sherlock decided that if any other fragments came up to the surface, he would take them all out of John. He would remove all the leftover remnants of Mary, and the nightmare John had lived, till there was nothing of it left still inside of him.
He cast a glance towards John. What had John told his family about him? And what aspect of the description was he not matching up to? He should have paid more attention to John’s outgoing correspondence.
Sherlock was beaming when he replied, “Yes, it was my Uncle Rudy’s. He was a wizard as well, and gave me the place to study magic independently when I was younger.”
Wanting to confirm if it really was the same room reproduced, John walked towards it, but was stopped by Sherlock’s hand reaching out to snag at his sleeve. “John, look.”
But he had still not found John. He doubted John would remain in the cottage at the time of a shipwreck, though he checked the windows just in case. Finding it empty, he began the slow climb of the cliff face. Someone atop would know, he had a feeling.
“Of course he longs for a party in his honour! What young man wouldn’t? And you’d look exquisite in a black mask,” Lady Norton raved, leaning further into his personal space.
“The garden’s on the other side of the house, if we’re going to watch for anyone snooping in it, shouldn’t we be over there?” John suggests, wanting to get away from the turned down photos, and back to feeling like they were doing something within his grasp.
John crossed the room in three strides, his unaided walking something Sherlock was still becoming used to. John grabbed hold of both his arms, turning Sherlock the way he needed him, before kissing him firmly, and then, repeatedly. At the prospect of that night being their last, John kissed him as if it was their first. The only sound in the room for quite some time was that of their laboured breathing, and the neglected phone ringing off its hook. John eventually pulled away and smiled, a touch wicked, and Sherlock felt his heart kick in his chest. If John never looked at him that way again, he thought he might just burn the world to the ground.
“It doesn’t make sense,” Sherlock said, leading John off the stoop and away from the door. “Meaning there’s something missing, more to the story.”
Eventually the diver resurfaced, and was returned to shore in one of the grey motor boats. There seemed to be a commotion amongst the several circling boats, and discussion occurring between them in the cove. Some of the sailors from the ship had returned to the shore to hear of the news, and there appeared to be animated talk. The moment he recognized a blond head with a cane walking into the group, he immediately pushed the binoculars back to their owner, and climbed back down to the shore.
“Gracing me with your presence at long last! And pray tell, what have you been doing all this time?” Wilkes asked, propped up against pillows and prepared to be irritable.
“I still don’t understand,” John said. Magnussen glanced at Sherlock briefly, as if to ask what he saw in such an idiot. The look grated on him almost as much as the outrageous suggestion.
“No,” said the ball of sheets on the sofa. The only indication of it being Sherlock was the black tuft of hair, just visible over the top of the off-white bundle. “I will not,
Moriarty motioned with his hand in silence towards the stairs. “After you,” he said, demurely. His speech had a strange lilt, a change in tone that added a whimsical quality to it.
“Someone has to make the first move,” Watson suggested. “Perhaps the person who has rebuffed the other many times in the past. The one who has made the other think he no longer stands a chance. I believe you might have recently learned the importance of communication in a relationship?”
He was returning to the West corridor, where he had not been in quite some time. Not since he’d had that odd run-in with Moriarty, which he hadn’t really wished to repeat.
As he made his return to his expectant audience, he caught sight of one of the fiddlers on the landing and motioned at him towards the stairs. The fiddler understood immediately, smiling and bowing, and headed down to tell the band to announce him. He felt his pulse in his throat, unusually rapid, and his face felt hot. It must have been from the warm costume and having just raced down the East corridor.
John laughed, and Sherlock grinned back. They fell into step with one another, even with John’s clunky walking, and returned to the Hudson in a comfortable silence.
Once he was out in the corridor, John was already at the lifts. “John!” he called. John turned slightly, but did not enough to face him.
Sherlock’s only response had been to squirm, his coy smile slipping into an open mouthed gasp as John began grinding against his arse. Sherlock frotted against the bed, stimulated but frustratingly covered up, with John whispering very bad things in his ear throughout -- until John finally did follow through on rucking his shirt up.
When John awoke one night after a fight to the feeling of Sherlock's groin pressed flush against his leg, his husband seeking his pleasure out against him in small unconscious movements, John realized that his restraint was truly to be tested. When Sherlock woke shortly after, and immediately withdrew to the other side of the bed in understandable self consciousness, John was no longer able to hold back. He had felt Sherlock's interest against him after all, and it hadn't seemed like the kind that went away on its own. John had reached for him, testing the waters, and Sherlock had been unresisting. He'd asked permission, and Sherlock had given it.
literally just sliding in to make my Sunday deadline, with the Manderley fancy dress ball, at last, : )))))))
“I only mind it all because of you,” John murmured. “This has changed you. Maybe for the better, but maybe for the worse. You used to be so brash and careless, in your own funny way, and now -”
“An incredible turn of events,” Watson commented. “And if they had only communicated with one another in private—her about her imagined jealousy, and him of his relationship with the owner—nothing would have ever needed to come of it.”
“Okay, okay, that’s rather enough, it’s ridiculous, you think I don’t know that? Obviously there’s no bloody ghost – “
He wanted to already be back at Manderley. He was walking on air, arm in arm with his husband, who now had no issue keeping up with his stride. They were going back home, and they’d be able to put everything behind them.
All John was able to articulate was a sound not unlike a growl before he was hurtling forward, intending to the knock the man to the ground—but before he could even get close, he was pulled back by metallic restraints.
Sherlock was aware his cheeks were flushing, but thankfully his face was hidden from John’s view. The water was barely more than lukewarm, but he felt hot all over.
, listen. Backing up, I am a sign interpreter. I have a caller on the line who uses sign language, and I’ll be interpreting the call for both of you tonight. So if you can keep it fairly straightforward, it’d be appreciated.”
“Perfect,” John said, picking up one of the now broken off pieces. “Guess I’ll just have to improvise.”
The pain was always present, but night was when the wound just below his shoulder felt flayed open, the experience akin to prying fingers digging into a sore. Even if he did sleep, he was sure to wake in a cold sweat during the night. His chest would ache, and from there, the pain traveled down the left side of his body, till his hand and leg shook with it.
“I wasn’t thinking of anything,” he lied, and in an attempt to lighten the mood, smiled slyly. “Maybe I was thinking of how you’ll have the surprise of your life when you see my fancy dress.”
He dreaded John’s going for the rest of the day, and the night. And when the morning came, he watched the car disappear round the curve in the drive from his bedroom window. He didn’t like to say goodbye to John properly in front of all the servants. He didn’t trust his own impulse control. He couldn’t be sure he wouldn’t make a fuss and beg John not to go.
“You know more about human nature than you let on,” John said, smiling softly, in spite of it all.  “And you’re right, of course, you always are. I didn’t mean to kill her,” John affirmed. “I can explain it, though it’s a long story.”
Moriarty kept moving forward, and him backward, till he felt the draft from the open window at his back. He turned away from that devil’s face, and looked down to see only white fog, covering the terrace.
cut through his internal flagellation. His eyes drifted, moving from place to place before settling on the fixed point provided by John’s open, worried eyes.
At the top of a precipice, two rams fight. Their horns crash and grip, evenly matched in battle, but one is more determined than the other, more ferocious, and pushes the other ram back toward the hill’s edge. This ram thinks himself brave. Or, so he did, till the other ram catches him unaware, slipping out from his hold and hitting him hard in his side, sending him tumbling down the mountain. Along his descent, the defeated ram scrabbles against the unforgiving rock to no avail, and is only saved when he lands on a small outcropping along the mountain’s side. There is some grass to eat and a puddle of water to lap, but not enough to last him for very long. There is ground to stand on, but not enough for him to have true freedom. He is injured, and limps about his small ledge in misery. When he runs out of grass and rainwater, even though his life has just been spared, he knows he will have to walk off the edge, and dash himself to bits on the rocks below.
Which wasn’t right – why was John a painting while he was flesh and blood? They wouldn’t be able to go out in the car together this way. How were they going to have dinner, with him like this?
No stars fell from the sky, and John doubted any would. At least he’d gotten himself some fresh air, what little good it did him. His shoulder still ached sometimes, but it had lessened in the past month, and he could now walk without issue. It was hard to tell what that all meant. He wondered if he would ever be fully cured, or if living with a curse could become just a fact of life.
“Sir, if you can’t even prove the motive of jealousy,” the Colonel began, “you really do not have a case to present.”
That settled it. “I’m going to fetch him,” he said, and continued his ascent over the boulders ahead despite John’s protests. They were slippery and he almost stumbled several times, but he was more than capable of climbing them. Which begged the question, why on Earth had John pleaded with him not to go?
“You don’t know anything,” Moriarty snarled, moving towards him, and then pausing, thinking better of it. “Mary and I
“How can you not know what I mean?” she asked, voice raising. “It’s a woman’s brooch, with a lover’s inscription, which you were keeping as if it were a prized possession!”
“I’ll lie down with you,” he interrupted, and John almost dropped the phone, recovering enough at the last minute to fumble it into its cradle.
“Mr Watson, you should come have a look at my car,” Magnussen suggested, his lips tilted upwards at the sides, almost smiling.
There were several conclusions he had drawn in the course of this morning that were sure to alter the next stages of his life. Firstly, that he wanted John, physically. Secondly, that he was in love with John, romantically. And lastly, that while John knew these things and was willing to accept him in this way, the attachment on John’s end was wholly dependent not on who he was, but what he was: a method of self-medication, a dose of youthful excitement intended to dull the ache of a life left empty in the wake of tragedy.
Impulsively, he tried to articulate this desire out loud. Telling Watson things usually made them better.
“I might ask,” the Colonel began, annoyance now apparent, “why you didn’t mention this evidence while you were present at the inquiry yesterday. Why would you not show the letter in court if you were so certain?”
He walked towards him, and boldly, sat on the arm of the chair not occupied by the paper. He leaned over, and tucked his head into John’s shoulder.
“I’m meant to call you turnip head rather than vegetable head, according to Sherlock,” John told it, though it seemed to not care either way.
Sherlock falls into the obsessive habit of checking John’s blog daily. This is largely unfulfilling as John rarely writes anything beyond sarcastic, meaningless posts directed at his therapist which his friends respond to with obvious concern.
Lestrade looked between them with a soft smile. “You’ll also have to choose a costume. Once you decide, we can order it from London.”
The owner of the cheekbones in question was currently flapping his hands. When John focussed on him again, he began to signal,
. Watson was about to head towards the yelling – however, also audible was the rapid pounding of feet across hard floor.
“Will you stay, John?” He hadn’t wanted to say that, but he couldn’t remember why. He couldn’t even imagine why. It felt wonderful to say. “Stay here with me?”
He assumed the man had returned to his own little world, but the fisherman had turned to stare at him.
“Believe me, I want that, more than anything,” John whispered back to him, his voice nearly breaking. “But there’s no time now. We only have maybe another few hours, perhaps a few days at most. They’ve found the boat, and Mary. Mary’s actual body. It’s all over.”
“I imagine arriving in regimentals will do much more for your dance card, Captain,” he hazarded, attempting to continue the light, teasing quality of their conversation.
John follows closely behind. Once aboveground, he can see Sherlock in full view and is overwhelmed by the sight of him. He pulls Sherlock to him tightly, breathing him in. Sherlock leans into the hug as best he can with his restraints, but soon cries out, “John! Behind – “
Sherlock was still adrift. He remembered the other-other John, dressed as John was now, leaving him in a graveyard when Sherlock needed him the most. Even when Sherlock had begged him not to go.
Sherlock swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing. John watched as the redness of his cheeks seemed to spread down to his chest, just visible at the opening of his collar.
“Yes, Mrs Hudson,” they repeated. Sherlock stood, straightening his suit jacket, as John pulled his own back on. “Send them up,” Sherlock said. “They will find us at our leisure!”
John was still holding the towel in his right hand, (the left hand wreaking havoc along Sherlock’s sides and back), which Sherlock decided would be very useful for protecting their sheets. Sherlock eased it from his grip, and threw it behind him, and then followed it by falling backward onto the bed, taking John down with him.
Hope you all had a good time with this lil John & Sherlock investigate a spooky house fic and enjoy your Halloween month ~
Pressing his fist to his lips as he chuckled, John thought a bit of inconvenience served them right, assuming no harm would come of it.
“Just a few weeks,” Greg rushed to say, aware he was breaking bad news. “We need to keep an eye on the bots. Maybe even figure out what keeps happening out there.”
There was a furrow starting to form between Sherlock’s brows, which John realized he’d wanted to kiss for years. He breathed in once, and took the plunge.
Sherlock made dismissive hand gestures for each item. “All nonsense fabricated by humans, or who knows, maybe by our own people so we had easy ways to throw humans off the scent. Perhaps a combination of both. People who are different have to protect themselves.”
“John, listen to me,” he said, grasping John’s upper arms with both hands and bending himself so as to be directly at face level. “You have to say that was a mistake, an honest mistake. A body was found in the water, hardly recognizable, and a body for Mary hadn’t turned up yet - of course you were biased into thinking it was your late wife.”
Sherlock turned and reached for him, begging John to escape, but before his very eyes his own hands turned to twine, his arms to thick rope, and Sherlock could do nothing but watch as John received him, and consequently placed his neck into the noose of his hempen embrace.
Sherlock’s head rolled back again, and slowly, his three-pronged toes turned back to feet, and his scales receded and returned to hair.
A single “Ready?” and Sherlock flipped onto his stomach in one smooth, unquestioning motion. John was left with a view of Sherlock’s back and five different kinds of edible lube, which John had to assume was a subtle suggestion.
John turns up his nose at the question, that rings in his head with the voice of his sister. In this too long day spent in the company of too many words of that woman, the thought of what happend in Trafalgar Square went several times to his minde.
<< Ford's many partners are in fibrillation for his fate, given the large number of companies he holds. I think it's normal not to have thought about someone else >>.
<< Contacts are not allowed! >> exclaims the guard. John look at her in anger. However, he does not want to put Mary in trouble, who looks frightened at the severe woman who is depriving her of this simple gesture of consolation.
<< No, she would never have done it! >> Sherlock exclaims and the heart rate monitor rings again. << I was the first person who rescued after she eliminated the family. It is impossible to think that Mary has not introjected part of the behaviors that she has seen implemented throughout their lives. These took shape in this cruel personality, made of prejudices and violent behavior, the same that she suffered. Mary is constantly struggling with this part. We spent long days together, she and I, without the evil-Mary showing up. We had found a sort of balance and I am sure that if there hadn't been a storm to prevent it, Mary would have brought me to Hataway >>.
There are only three folders on the desktop: the trush, the internet connection and one named 'My books'. Sherlock opens it and finds two subfolders. He opens the first, named 'Concluded', and scrolls through a significant amount of subfolders named with the titles of the Sharon Milton's stories and novels . Sherlock closes it and opens the second one, named the 'Laboratory'.
Three hours have passed since Sherlock's stormy awakening. Hours during which the doctor summoned Mycroft, which allowed John to attend the interview to talk about the possible presence of this syndrome.
<< Exactly. You wrote to me that the coroner found no sexual violence. This means that the man you are looking for may prefer harassment. Do not underestimate it, it could be a choice that derives from a thousand reasons and nothing can give the certainty that this man would not be able to commit a complete sexual relationship >>.
"No! I would not have brought them for the simple fact that I would not have liked to see them running away horrified by the corpses in the fridge, by the experiments he carries out on organs and cells of human or animal origin or in front of his offensive deductions! " John retorts acid.
<< Sherlock must not be altered at all, Myc. I don't want the nurse to inject to him other sedative into his veins. Not now that he has finally woken up >> John says, smiling at him.
<< No, John. I can be smarter than Sherlock, it's true, but I have no method. He gives importance to things that elude me because I don't consider them. Most of the time because I find them superfluous >>.
<< Yes. So there will be no problems. If will be possible, you will help me as you did today. Otherwise I'll somehow get by >>.
<< In order not to deteriorate the relationship between Sherlock and his pusher of investigation >> Fox replies with a smile.
John, Mycroft, Hataway and his men broke into Mary's house at just past midnight. They found her wrapped in an old shawl, confused by their presence. John let Hataway do his work by arresting her and he rushed into the house, followed by Mycroft, looking for Sherlock.
<< He remained at your side from the moment he rescued you until yesterday >> Mycroft informs him. << After you woke up and invoked the name of your jailer, citing the will to run to her aid, John left this room, saying he had to conclude the investigation that you had opened concerning the pit. He kept saying that if you said you wanted to help her there must be a more than valid reason >>.
<< If you tell it, it will go >> Mary- child encourages him with a smile << I always do it >>. Sherlock looks at her for a long time. Mary untied her hair, which she usually holds tied in a tight bun, and now it falls around her face. In the twilight of the light of the snow that vibrates against the window, that rough face, which becomes mulled when the Mary-child moves the massive body, takes on tones that should be terrible but that Sherlock, now, finds to be even sweeter.
<< Do you play the violin? >> exclaims Mary with a big smile on her lips. Sherlock nods. << Wait here >> she says, abruptly removing her hands from Sherlock's face. The attempt to hold her back is worthless. Mary gets rid of him easily despite his grip was strong.
<< He is Morgan. He found you >> Sherlock says and the dog barks satisfied. The boy smiles and Sherlock, with a gesture of his head, authorizes the puppy to go to the boy. Morgan immediately jumps on the child, licking his happy face. The boy laughs cheerfully opposing a mild defense.
<< Yes >> he admits. << Evil-Mary is a convinced homophobic and very aggressive. I think I should thank Molly. It is only thanks to her that I won the attentions of Mary-child >>.
<< My brother puts so much sugar to make it undrinkable. I see that you, on the other hand, appreciate its natural aroma, like me >> he says, taking a seat in the free chair beside him. << You didn't kill him, John >>.
Sherlock cannot reply to Moriarty stark truth. His stomach contracts, leaving an acidic taste in his mouth. Taste that reminds Sherlock of how he vomited, and quite a lot, that Sunday morning. He had closed himself in the bathroom, opened the shower of the tub and he let himself be overwhelmed by the retching. Maybe he would have ended up throwing up his soul anyway, even if John had behaved differently. He had drunk far too much and he was not used to. It had been, however, even more humiliating to embrace the toilet to vomit after those words.
<< Do you realize that the manager gave us this suite, this one and not others? He gave us a double room, Sherlock, do you realize what that means? >>.
<< Lawyer? But what the hell are you talking about? >> the man chuckles. << Do you really think you can stay without me? >>.
<< That's right, John >> replies Mycroft, continuing to examine the sheets. << There were three other Paddington's phone call during the day and two more the following day. Thursday, however, there are significant telephone exchanges with the local police district. The last of these occurred in the late afternoon, then nothing more >> Mycroft says and his forehead stretched so far frowns imperceptibly. << Sherlock no longer made calls, nor sent messages and he was not even contacted anymore >>.
<< This, my dear detective, is the place where the incident occurred and this >>, indicates the speck, << is the blood of your heart attacked victim. Send someone for the relief, at least I think your men are capable of doing it >> Sherlock says, taking the jacket from John's hands. << As you can see, this is the most secluded corner of the dressing room. You were not immediately surprised by any other patrons and it is far enough away from the door to make any kind of noise inaudible. Nice or unpleasant they are >> he adds, waving his hand in an attempt to create some wind. << The fact that it was a man and not a woman is clarified not only by the dynamic that emerges from the position of the bruises. I am not an expert, but I think the most natural action is to push the woman against the wall and not the other way round. I think a woman would not place her hands like that on the man who supports her. If this is not enough to convince you, as you can see there are two types of footprints >>, Sherlock continues pointing at the floor immediately under the red mark left on the wall, << both very large. If there was a woman, well, I think we should have found a single footprint instead of both and not positioned in this way >>.
<< You barely remember to look after yourself, Sherlock, of course I think so! >> John says, closing the door of the apartment behind him. He doesn't take a shower, but at the moment it is not a serious problem like being able to put one foot in front of everyone without falling. John undressing while he go up to his room. Throws his clothes on the ground and lay on the bed, falling asleep even before touching the pillow.
<< Why? >> asks Sherlock and John notes that in fact it is the first time they find themselves listening to a minor. He even fears that they are already doing something contrary to the law, since the boy is there without parental consent.
<< I am Dr. Watson, I have been authorized by Inspector Hataway to meet the detainee Mary Abbott >> John introduce himself, showing the sheet handed to him by the skeptical detective. The guard checks the document meticulously and then activating the intercom summons Mary to room number 5.
<< Morgan, come here! We are at the crime scene. You must not leave traces >> Sherlock reprove him and the dog immediately jumps to his side keeping up. << Call your men and give me five minutes, Lestrade >> Sherlock orders to the tired detective.
<< You, a London's doctor who as a hobby helps a private investigator, want to come here, in the north west, to teach us how to deal with the rigors of our winters? >>.
<< You are not a ski teacher. You are a policeman, one of those who takes people away >> she accuses him angry.
John's gaze flies to Sherlock, who standing next to Fox, sitting in front of Lizzy's laptop. The tense face, the attentive gaze, the hands folded behind the back in that pose of apparent and peaceful expectation.
<< But it was you who put him on her >> Greg continues, moving away from him, while still keeping his hands on his shoulders. << I don't know what I would have done if Lizzy had made that crazy gesture. She is now destroyed and it will take time for she to recover, for everyone to find a bit of balance. But she's alive and that's what counts >> Greg says, smiling while his eyes get wet.
<< Dad has always been very sweet to you. Of course there was for few time here, but when you married him you knew he was a detective and he wanted to make a career. George and I could not choose. We arrived later and we found the situation as it is. Instead, you could have chosen to not marry him.
<< Yes, there is something they call 'Evening relaxation: a magnificent bath of sound waves produced by our splendid Tibetan bells capable of giving relaxation and lightening the spirit'. It starts at 10 pm >>.
<< If this is how you like it, I will give you so many punch to make you pass out >> the man roars, bringing another punch that Sherlock dodges.
There isn't that saturday night  urgency, which was mostly John's and not his. There is no intention to invite John to take him, putting himself entirely at his mercy. Sherlock doesn't even seem to want to direct the game: he just dictates the timing.
Sherlock finally turns to John. He holds his gaze and John has the annoying sensation of feeling him far away. A lot has changed in the past month. John thought that the adventure lived because of Moriarty, would allow them to come closer. Instead the consultant became colder and more reserved. They are practically elbow to elbow, yet many kilometers seem to separate them.
<< Well, O'Hara didn't reject her works. On the contrary, she also made herself available to help her >>.
<< She was transferred to a prison psychiatric clinic and will stay there until the end of the trial >>.
Sherlock reflects on these words. He reflects on how much pride and honor have laid down the law between him and John. The long silences following the quarrels. They do not want to bow their heads, seeking a dialogue, a closeness. It wasn't his 'I love you' that ruined everything and not even John's crazy talk. It was the obstinate silence that followed. Sherlock decided to closing himself in the bathroom and John decided to leaving the apartment. They could have talked about it, although it seemed silly and useless to do it and, instead, they both preferred that passive aggression, the refuge of the cowards.
John remembers well the detailed explanation Sherlock gave him one evening, while changing the strings on the violin. After a while John got lost and started nodding without following him much. John also behaved like everyone else, bored with Sherlock's too many words. However, he could not keep up with him. He would never be able to keep up with him.
I shuffled it again in my grasp, back and forth in my hands as if my left somehow had more to tell me than my right.
"You truly are not understanding me, are you? No, of course you're not. You are going to make me say it."
"Perhaps. I fear I am discovering I am not entirely the same person I was when I left. I know that you are not. We are both of us similar, yes, but we are not the same."
"No, the key, Watson. We need the key. Grateful to see you breathing as well, but this reunion will be less poignant underwater. Please, Thorne lies dead along the bulkhead. The key to my handcuffs sits in his right breast pocket. Go, Watson, hurry."
This was mine, my old pocket watch, a gift Holmes had given me after our first extraordinarily lucrative case resolved so long ago, the delicate recovery of the McCarver pearls. I almost missed his grand resolution with the baroness and the barber's scissors by missing a train in Hertfordshire.
Sherlock Holmes finally stopped listlessly staring at our waning fire and turned to me, all seriousness in his eyes.
Holmes stepped back and refocused his eyes on the present and on me. He sat down and breathed deeply as he sank into his chair. It was a long moment before he spoke again.
When he returned, Watson had the lock open quicker than anticipated but the process of being freed from the chair was more of an ordeal. Sleep five hours with an arm lying in an awkward position in bed and one may well wake up sore. Spend some fifty hours or more bound to a chair with a fractured arm cuffed in an awkward position, and one may find oneself in a state approaching agony upon returning the limb to its proper orientation.
His eyes were distant. In his mind he was still there, alone. We had both been so alone. My heart ached for him, for us.
Holmes laughed then, crouched there holding Watson's cheek, both of them drenched in saltwater and relief, but the mirth caught inside his chest.
and you continue to do so despite all rational sense. For that profound and unfailing absence of judgement, I am forever grateful."
"I don't know what it is that you want me to say. It is a pocket watch. A timepiece. A gift. A memory. What is it you are digging for?"
I, however, had moved my life out to other, less painful digs after I returned from the Continent and he did not. There was no John Watson museum to find now on my return. My heavy old desk I had left, so it was waiting for me with fresh paper and even my preferred brand of ink. But every book was missing, every letter gone from its slot. A comfortable new bed stood proudly next to an empty wardrobe. Mrs. Hudson's fresh handmade soap sat waiting and fragrant by the basin along with plenty of towels and water, but my razor was waiting for me uselessly on the other side of the city.
Holmes did everything he could think of to get me to leave him and return to London the morning after Professor Moriarty slipped his noose. He called himself
Holmes shifted under his blankets but their texture now scratched at his skin. It felt as if he were wrapped not in linen and cotton but rough hessian and sisal. The mattress pressing hard at his back was every bit as cozy as a wooden plank. His nerves jangled with intermittent sparks of pain that began everywhere in his body but inevitably ended in his left arm. Holmes' breath came ever faster in the stagnant and smothering atmosphere.
, at least – faked names, histories, voices, personalities. I thought of all the temporary homes he must have lived in, all the temporary people he must have come to know in each new city. Fourteen separate sets of acquaintances and neighbours, colleagues and friends.
"The hinge is tight and the release is in excellent condition. It has not been frequently used despite other appearances."
"No. One or the both of us would be dead. You said it yourself. We both know what sacrifices can be required to stop great evil. Sherlock, look at what our sacrifices have brought. It is a safer, kinder world for what we went through. And you and I survive to enjoy it together."
I turned to find Holmes leaning in the doorway, looking weary with my own robe dangling limply from his bony shoulders. He was as thin as I'd ever seen him but as adept at interpreting my thoughts as ever.
At that moment, I should have liked to tell him how I missed him too. How I missed my dear friend's voice, his presence, his brilliance, his respect.
He breathed deep and nodded at the undeniable truth. The only sound in the room was the crackle of the waning fire we watched together, orange embers still yet lit among the ashes. At last Holmes spoke, but so softly.
He was right of course, but knowing his methods and applying them to any fruition were always two distinctly different things. I tried to decide what it was he meant for me to see. The condition of the watch? The wear? Upon inspection, it appeared someone had mutilated it with a straight file or some such, haphazardly repolished it, then left it to rattle around freely with coins and keys for a year or maybe three. From the outside, it looked cheap and long used but the actual functioning machinery inside seemed relatively pristine. The crystal had been damaged, yes, but less, and the movements beneath ticked forward crisply.
I was not used to that piercing gaze only a few weeks yet removed from the Jefferson Hope affair. I regarded Holmes as a form of weather then, fickle and wild. This was a roll of thunder from him, and there is a peculiar excitement one feels when lightning is in the air.
"It is not a matter of want, Watson. I will obtain this information one way or another. It cannot be prevented by you or by me. What I am attempting to do is acquire what I will in the most respectful method possible."
Outside, amazed eyes everywhere we went shattered the illusion. Sherlock Holmes was a walking miracle. It is not everyday that one sees the resurrected striding through the city in full casual nonchalance. A bit of his magic even rubbed off onto me, as if I had somehow been the medium that returned him to our living reality. In those first days, a strange disbelieving reverence followed the two of us about. News of Holmes was on the front page of every newspaper in the nation. Passers-by whispered to each other on the street, trying not to get caught pointing as I walked to the tobacconist and back.
"Perhaps you have spent enough time on the edge of the blade now in life you no longer need to recreate it in chemicals."
That was all before, of course. It had been years since I rested that easily. Now I often felt as if I was conducting a séance every night in my bedroom. Rituals were orchestrated, all the scene set just as the spirits demanded. I took my place and held out for a sign. More often than not, the result was the same as any attempt to contact a ghost, a long stretch of time waiting expectantly in the dark for something fleeting and miraculous, never to arrive.
"I am virtually assured of seeing it eventually. We will go to the Turkish baths one day after a chase resolves, perhaps. Or we will hurriedly change clothes in an alleyway as we discard one set of disguises for another on the fly. At some point, I am certain we will have to address some minor or more than minor upper bodily injury. Usually those should be mine and I do hope we can keep yours to a bare minimum, but if you continue in this line of work with me, expecting none is unrealistic. In any case, I will see your shoulder at some point, Watson, so I do not propose now to simply look at it. I propose to observe it. I gather data by utilising a variety of senses, and I can most efficiently learn what I will if I am allowed to employ them. Do you consent?"
"You could have made the effort but you did not, which means you must have... chosen not to repair it? You wanted it to look this way. You wanted..."
"But you said Sigerson was one of the first of your aliases. I don't even know how many identities you had after that. Surely they couldn't have all made sense with a mountain climber's worn pocket watch."
I took a steadying breath he must have listened to and did as he asked. Every internal pop and creak he catalogued along with its corresponding arm motion and position. When he was at last satisfied with his findings, Holmes stood up straight to return his focus to my surface scars.
A jolt woke him from a fainting spell he had not even noticed. Startled, he flailed, kicking out with his functioning limbs and hitting something unexpected, something mostly solid.
That moment I had run through in my mind a thousand times since the day as though I could change the past through sheer force of imagination. As if I could see the moment he chose to send me from the fray and this time find some way to prevent it.
If we did not exit those old sitting room walls, I could almost pretend no time had passed as long as I ignored his new grey hairs as well as my own. Holmes never pursued Moriarty. He never allowed me to be lured away from him. He never left me a hastily scrawled letter and a weight in my heart I had borne since that day.
Need or not, there were no more moments left to spare. The water was now lapping upward at Holmes' knees. Black smoke clouded above them as flames climbed the far bare wall, stretching toward the ceiling. Holmes took an unsteady breath and struggled back to his feet.
Or at least he feigned defeat. Is that why he took my watch? To find another way to win? To make me lose track of time, miss another train perhaps, and allow him the space to slip away from me unnoticed?
The cork vest turned out to be immensely useful to him in those first seconds when the shock of cold water made every joint and muscle in his body seize involuntarily.
He said he had taken it from me as we left Strasburg. Many of the various localities we passed through on our flight were unmemorable. Strasburg was impossible to forget.
Instead, Holmes poured his concentration into kicking and gazing up at the night sky arching wide above him. The distant suns were neutral onlookers to his drama, peering down at him through the clouds of his hot breath in the cold moist air. Too weak to give himself much propulsion through the waves, he attempted to steer with one cooperating arm and hope the current would do most of the work in carrying him ashore.
, as if he had ever been anything but, not least to himself. He appealed to my reason, and when that failed, he attempted to insult me away instead. On realizing even his worst was nothing to me, he brought out his best.
I picked the thing up and it swung in the air, shining in the light, this message I had no ability to decipher. I longed for a translator, not only for him but for me. When I put it down I slammed it on the table harder than I meant to, or perhaps exactly as hard as I meant to.
His self-diagnosis seemed correct by all observations. Heightened blood pressure, a fine tremor, pupils wide and black. A mild overdose of cocaine it was.
I thought of my home then filled with Mary's touches, the drawings she'd made in bed during her illness, the clothes she'd worn hanging with mine in our closet, the sweet perfume I'd bought her for our anniversary sitting on her dresser.
"What? Why did you not simply tell me that?" I asked as I dragged him back toward my medical bag and the nearest bed, my own.
"Certainty of your safety I kept with me always. I trusted your love's companionship would keep you. After Mary's passing, you were left with nothing of either of us."
"No, please wait," Holmes tried to respond, but his throat was too dry by then for even those small words, and the doctor disappeared from the room.
At the entry scar at the top of my shoulder, close to the crook of my neck, he paused his movement. He worked his fingers there for a minute or more, testing depth and density. I breathed and watched him and waited.
"You deserve better, my dear Watson," he said, sighing into my hair. "We both know you always do. For whatever fool reason, you chose this life with me anyway. You
Again, he leaned in close, but this time he gripped my shoulder itself, holding the joint steady to keep me still. He touched at my twisted skin delicately, measuring it, stretching it, watching it react to his pressure. Long, dexterous fingers crept slowly along the length of my clavicle, hesitating at intervals for closer analysis of mended bone.
"Do you wish to hear my complaints, Doctor, or would you prefer to ascertain my temperature? I do not believe both are simultaneously possible in the physical sense. I suppose if you were willing to sacrifice some precision in measurement and also able to accurately interpret my racing words from behind pursed lips and clenched teeth, you might–"
A tear I'd not intended rolling down my cheek startled me back into the present. I wiped it away with the heel of my hand, grateful to find my patient by now truly asleep and no longer able to bear witness.
"Broken, isn't it?" Although it was phrased as a question, it was not. "And you've been beaten. Have you had any food? Any water?"
The hollow roar of the fire moving up through the hull was now loud enough to hear over the waves. It would be out onto the deck soon and from there would burn free in the open air. Holmes braced himself for one last moment. With the list of the ship, it was a relatively short drop from the stern, but the roiling water still would require a sheer free fall to reach. Watson watched him, waiting for him to go first. He took a long deep breath to hold and Holmes relinquished his grip on the railing.
"Watson, there isn't time for this," Holmes snarled through gritted teeth. "We have to find a way off the ship. If you have not noticed, we are sinking."
"You wish to know what I saw when I examined your healed shoulder. That is simple. I saw you, Watson. I saw your history. I saw your life.
"You weren't meant to be napping, Mr. Holmes. Shame. I was hoping you might have heard the good news. Are you listening now? Snap to it, man!"
<< Thank you, Mr. Holmes >> he says, holding out his hand visibly more serene. Sherlock squeezes it and dismisses him with a pat on the back.
John is therefore preparing. Because those men could extract from the car a corps that does not resemble Sherlock at all. Only when John would have found the corps in front of him would he have been able to say otherwise. A shiver runs through him and the doctor tucks his scarf and hat in an attempt to overcome the freezing cold of these mountains. Greg, standing behind him, observes the recovery operations. The license plate of the vehicle has blown because of the impact and for the moment the only correspondence is the car's model rented by Sherlock.
<< Who do you tell about your nightmares to? >> Sherlock asks in amazement, since he has never felt any other living soul present in the house.
<< Sherlock is there, Mycroft, I hear him >> John says now to his unusual roommate. Mycroft, standing behind him, observes the pattern, as attentive as he is.
<< You are not a bad father. Believe me, I know how is a bad father >> says Sherlock, turning his gaze slightly to his brother, standing by the door of his study. Taking Greg by surprise, the consultant takes the pack of cigarettes from his jacket pocket. << You stopped with this stuff, remember? >> he says, winking at him.
<< How the fuck does it! >> exclaims one of the technicians, who must have slammed his heads against it for a long time.
Sherlock observes the mass grave from its edge. The cobalt blue scarf protects his throat from the cutting wind. He pulled up the collar of his coat and barely feels his fingers getting cold inside the deer leather gloves.
William would like to close his eyes but he can't. He sees Sharon bend her legs, ready to pounce on him, and he is breathless. Suddenly, Sharon screams and the knife slips from her hands.
<< No! She will suffer. Molly will suffer a lot, instead >> she replies desperately bringing her hands to her hair.
John also has no memory how he got to West Cumberland Hospital. Just remember that from the moment the aircraft left, Mycroft's hand never lifted off his shoulder.
<< No? >> the manager asks in amazement. << I thought to be important for you  Investigate here in the hotel >>.
<< Apparently not >> Sherlock agrees, putting the folder back in place. << If only Ford had been kidnapped, I wouldn't accept the case. But one of my man's favorite authors was pulled in the middle of this story with her son, so ... >>.
<< But if you just said you didn't have anyone waiting for you in London, except this flatmate! >> she says, saying the last word with disgust.
<< Yes, I wanted to know when you could come for the deposition, but I got no answer. I thought you were in a coma, as always happens after the end of a case >>.
<< The investigation is not over. Will you leave with me? >> Sherlock asks him, just separating from his lips.
<< And is it possible, therefore, to go from the massage room to the staff changing rooms without being filmed by the camera? >>.
<< It is since Silver died that things have gone wrong >> the child whispers, so slowly that Greg is forced to kneel next to John and Sherlock to hear him.
The master feels cornered. One of his assistants led out by two agents and he nervously passes his hand through his thick black hair.
<< You have the voice of someone who has just come out of the right side of a really interesting person's bed >> she says mischievously.
<< My brother died in that desert shit >> Hataway adds, twisting his nose. << Missing. So they said. If he had been at your command, perhaps now he would be alive or, at least, we would have a body to cry on >> he says, looking away. << Umbridge, Southlow, form a team of five volunteers each and beat the area around here. We are looking for the corps of a man between thirty and forty years of age. MacAllister, you put another one together and go around all the districts, let's see if someone rescued a man and took him home. The roads to the hospital are impractical when it snows like this. Once upon a time, those who were sick went to Dr. Liland Abbott. Does Mary still go down to Jo's shop for shopping, Mac? >>.
<< I had a nightmare, Mary. I'm sorry >> says promptly. The last thing Sherlock wants now is activate her violent part. He wouldn't be able to stand it after the nightmare he had just had. It would be an insane continuation in the world of reality and Sherlock feels he would go completely mad if it happened.
<< I really like you too >> reply Sherlock sleepy slurred. John blinks several times and looks at Sherlock, fallen again into the arms of Morpheus. One of his hand outstretched towards the puppy, standing next to him, the other hand abandoned on the pale belly, moving at the slow rhythm of his breathing. John has never seen before Sherlock's face so relaxed,
<< Hey, what's going on? >> he asks, moving close to Sherlock. John looks at the heart rate monitor and takes Sherlock's pulse.
As Sherlock expected, nobody are there. Sherlock's stomach closes when he arrive at the wall against which  Martin abused of him . The white wall opens and McNeel enters the retractable door. Sherlock must admit that he does not like to find himself alone with this big man, a little younger than him. Martin looks at Sherlock with an ugly smile full of desire.
<< Why, what have I done? >> asks Sherlock pulling up the zipper. John hurries out of the lift followed by him still fastening his belt. The two girls chuckle talking to each other and Sherlock turns to look at them without understanding what happened.
Sherlock tries again to open his eyes to that unwanted contact and notices a large and dark spot that the man has on his left wrist. That hand feels too insistent, annoying.
>> Sherlock mumbles, rubbing his eyes. The puppy falls silent and sits down. John looks at him in amazement.
"Sure. What else have you accepted out of courtesy? " but this is better keep it to himself. Remember: do not loosing the beneficial effects of the shower!
It was exhilarating and, for the first time since being cursed, the wound in John’s chest felt healed.
Sherlock’s skin was no longer the pale imitation of John’s, the blue seemingly traveling through their veins, and peeking out at the edges of their coveralls. “I—” Sherlock began, but never finished.
“He played the violin, though not well," he responded, haltingly. "I took after him in that I suppose. He was generally not a very bright man. He dressed a lot like you.”
Despite returning to his human form, Sherlock’s visible shock at finding a man in his living room did not recede. He remained at the top of the stoop, mouth agape, staring at John sitting in front of his fire.
He decided it didn’t matter. He would protect the memories regardless of what Watson thought. And he would never tell anyone about these drives, ever, so that they could never be tarnished. Especially not by Wilkes.
“They’ll be able to correctly identify her body based on whatever clothes or jewelry remains,” he commented, inferring what John meant.
If he had been told months ago he would soon spend days on end sitting in a room with another person, and that rather than finding this hateful he would just be glad of the other’s presence, he would have likely raised his brow with doubtful scorn. But months ago, he had not yet met the right man.
John couldn’t write that. Mostly because it would just make Sherlock more interested, the wanker. Besides it wasn’t exactly ethical to tell the only person who could catch the killer not to do so. More people would die if Sherlock Holmes didn’t step in. John just didn’t want him to be included in that number.
“I can see you’re on the right trail,” John said, with a wry smile, at odds with the tone of the conversation.
,” Moriarty said, his contempt seeping through. “She doesn’t even need to be here to beat you. But then, no one could ever get the better of her, you know.”
“If you’re inside of it,” John said, eyes shining in the dark orange light of Manderley, “not a chance.” This time, Sherlock ducked down and kissed him instead.
“Watch it! Are you trying to say I dress like an old man?" Watson asked, but was clearly not offended in the slightest. "Anyway, I think you’re lying. Not about me being an old man – I suppose I am compared to you – but about the violin. I suspect you play beautifully.”
John described their first meeting in the same way he might dip a single toe into bubble-surfaced bathwater. He wasn’t daring enough to step in all the way just yet, not till he knew how warm his welcome would be. The blog post was complimentary enough to hint at his interest, while ambiguous enough to get away with it. John thought he knew when he was flirting with someone, but Sherlock wasn’t like other someones. Besides, it was possible that after meeting him, Sherlock was only interested in friendship, or a doctor to assist in his work. Or, rather, muscle to help out on cases, given the assistance John had provided.
“Now or never. After you,” John gestured, and the three of them made their way back into the house, and dove right into organizing.
In a recent attempt at documenting one of their cases, John had let what Sherlock would likely have classified as his ‘romanticism’ run away with him. Limited only by his piss-poor typing, John had gone so far as to describe Sherlock in detail at the moment of an epiphany, including all of the physical attributes that John’s imagination often fixated on. (John felt that the frankly orgasmic appearance of these epiphanies as they played out over Sherlock's face should really have taken at least some part of the blame.)
Sherlock’s expression must have given away his fear, for John looked alarmed as he stroked his cheek. “Hey, hey, look at me.”
“What did they say?” Sherlock prodded. “Did they ask you who the body could have been? What did you say?”
He at once became aware of John’s approach, signaled by the sound his shoes and the clack of his cane on every other step. He wondered if Moriarty had heard John first, and left before he arrived. Moriarty would need to be very observant for that to be the case.
He shares another quick glance with Sherlock, and at last they are on the same page, both clearly wondering
“And since when do you check in on people?” John asked, incredulous. “I assume you didn’t find anything, seeing as there hasn’t been any news on him recently. I think I’d remember if there had been.”
“For John,” Moriarty repeated, “to bring him peace. If he can never love you, not like her, what’s the point of living? Staying alive is just that.... staying. There’s an easy solution.”
“You needn’t go now. In fact, I’d prefer you didn’t, as I would at least like to explain my actions, though you will likely think me even more foolish for them.”
Lestrade was uncharacteristically dour. He assumed there was an issue with one of the staff, which Lestrade would hate to bring to the master’s attention.
John attempted to compose a message. He attempted it seven times. John typed out “Hi,” then backspaced. He typed out “Thanks… for all of that,” then highlighted it all with his mouse, and pressed delete. John started and stopped the message another five times over the next five minutes, until his therapist’s advice came to him in his hour of need.
“I’m absolutely positive, he was fast asleep on the rug when I turned in,” she says, nodding towards a rug on the floor near what looks to be a closet and the door to a bedroom at the other end of the living room.
When the court case decided a verdict of suicide, and David’s letter turned out to be a dead end, John was almost afraid to believe it could all be that easy.
They came to Manderley in early May. John said this was meant to be the best time, or at least it was according to everyone else. John seemed to lack a full appreciation for that sort of thing, but he apparently had many flowers in bloom to look forward to.
John couldn’t take his eyes away from them, which was when another realization took hold. “The bots,” John said, half-way through completing his thought.
Dumbly, he shook his head. “I haven’t had the pleasure,” he replied, his voice scratchy from disuse.
Sherlock, embarrassed, could only mutter “nonsense” beneath his breath. A beat passed, Sherlock too affected by Watson’s words to further comment.
His hand brushed against the outside of his pocket, and he felt an edge of lace from the handkerchief Lestrade had returned to him. He pulled it out, and found that it wasn’t his at all, but something old and worn from the coat he’d had on. He turned it over to see a monogram in the corner, ‘M.W.’, with the ‘M’ so large it practically eclipsed the other letter.
“Is there anyone missing?” Sherlock thought to ask when they broke apart, gripping John’s shoulder while looking over it towards the crowd gathered closer to the woods. “Gladstone? Where is Gladstone?”
Sherlock had turned from an unusual creature John had found in a crater into a very human-like person, all in a matter of hours. John hadn’t actually offered, but Sherlock had even begun wearing a pair of John’s navy coveralls.
John made to pull away from him, the hold on his hand loosening. John wanted to stride away through the trees faster than before, leaving this all behind. It was so like John to finally voice his dark thoughts, and then to turn away from the words as if they wouldn’t catch him.
A check in the mirror confirmed he’d been sloppy. Sherlock wiped at his mouth, and in the process smeared the mess across his left cheek.
And there was the rub, the reason why it seemed undeniable that this fling was over before it had even gotten off the ground—she honestly might have. His being a doctor might have just slipped her mind, given the nature of their superficial, no strings attached relationship—as dictated by her, not him. Not that it was anyone’s fault. She had made it clear from the outset that she didn’t want anything serious, or monogamous. They were adults, John had thought, and a friends with benefits arrangement was technically “doing something,” though John imagined that was not what his therapist had envisioned when she suggested it.
“It leaves us here." He motioned to the disarray of the living room around them. “Where are you from? Where do you currently live?”
He’d have to find another stick, and soon. His good leg couldn’t support all his weight for long, and especially not uphill. It was growing dark, the mist was thicker the higher he climbed, and there was still no sign of Wizard Holmes’ moving castle.
“I’m not questioning you, or your commitment,” John said, stroking the top of his cheekbone with his thumb. “I’m just afraid I’m not giving you enough. You like a bit of drama. Not much of that here. It must be… difficult.”
He watched as John called Lestrade, instructing him briefly in the preparations to be made for the impromptu visit. It wasn’t hard to see why John had left at the crack of dawn - the bags beneath John’s eyes told a story of their own. John hadn’t slept well last night (perhaps from needing to be his personable self for the entire evening?), and would need rest before more hosting.
The alien stared at him with eyes unsettlingly keen as a wrinkle formed between their brows, but otherwise did not respond. It seemed they’d given up on the robotic sounds from earlier.
“Don’t be sorry for me, when you’re the one who - who has to go through this all,” Sherlock finished lamely, also overly aware they were out in plain sight.
“While I do enjoy a tricky curse,” Sherlock evaded, “I can’t make bricks without clay. I don’t have enough information at present.”
“Oh, but this is the big one, the final act,” Moriarty said, crossing his legs at the ankles. “You already know what’s on the table, dear heart. I think you even know what the question is.”
John rubbed his brow with one hand, and leaned on his cane with the other. John’s face seemed concerned, though he couldn’t imagine why.
“You say that now John,” Sherlock said shakily, in a way that made John’s heart squeeze in his chest, “but your reaction to the reality of it may be very different.”
Unlike Watson, the states he himself swung between were manic with energy to practically catatonic, with the only constant being his sour mood.
John supposed that Sherlock, with his quick wits, had been more prepared to learn that he was to John what John was to him. Both of them literary characters in reality, somehow.
“I’m thinking that the overnight trip to this public dinner couldn’t be coming at a worse time,” John replied. “Though, you could still come with me?”
“Are you solving something over there?” John asked, a small smile already beginning to form. “Are you keeping a diverting murder mystery from me? Like the Chinese acrobats or the ginger dwarf?”
He was fond of this particular attention-seeking ploy of Sebastian’s, as it meant he would be relieved of spending the day with him. He took his leave of Wilkes with a skip in his step, heading to the dining room for an early luncheon. It was his ideal mealtime – in between breakfast and lunch, when he could eat in peace without being distracted by the other hotel guests surrounding him. He was so enamoured with the prospect of being alone that he didn’t realize till he was halfway across the room that the dining area was not completely empty.
Edgecoombe? He had been there once, when he was seven. It was a big place, with a pier, and donkeys. He made a flicking gesture with his wrist. The donkeys weren’t important.
Harry losing interest in solving mysteries was the start of something far more exciting—solving them with Sherlock Holmes himself. John thought of this as a fantastic upgrade, and was inspired to de-age his favourite character by a particular recollection of Holmes from the novels. As a young boy Sherlock had been dismissed by the police when he tried to convince them a simple murder was far more nefarious than it appeared. This injustice irked John greatly, and he enjoyed thinking that if he had been present things might have gone differently. As a result, his fantasies involved setting up a detective agency with Sherlock, which became the foundation of many daydreams.
“Good evening,” he said, teasingly. He raised a brow at John. Why was the man so dumbfounded? Why did he look like that?
They were starting to remind John of the henchmen that had chased them, and the ones he’d seen as a soldier.
“Do you think he made it out?” Sherlock wondered. If John was surprised that Sherlock wasn’t able to tell, he didn’t show it.
“John,” Sherlock interrupted, strong and sure. It was inconceivable that John didn’t know this, but his John did sometimes need help with these things. “I am wildly, madly, and incomparably in love with you. I love you, with my entire heart and soul.”
Sherlock quickly swings his gaze to John with his usual ‘we both know what’s going on’ look, which John parries with his ‘don’t do that, I have no bloody clue’ look.
John advanced on them, sliding his shorter leg between Sherlock’s, and pressing Sherlock back against the wall next to the sofa. Slowly, John wrapped his hands around the wrists of Sherlock’s newly grown arms, and slid them up along the wall till they were pinned gently above Sherlock’s head, crooked at the elbows. Sherlock’s other two hands came up to rest lightly on John’s chest, knowing that they could push or pull John away if needed. Sherlock peered down at him, their faces close enough to touch if one of them moved an inch.
"You know, it just wasn't sporting, Mr. Holmes. Not sporting at all, but you English never did believe in fair play. Look at your fox hunts. A bunch of you mincing ninnies dress up in your Sunday finest, prance around on horses, and have a pack of over-bred hounds corner a helpless animal so you can shoot it and feel proud of yourselves for your accomplishment. Well, I'd like to see you worthless fops try your hand against a real opponent, say an American gray wolf, all muscle and teeth. You believe you're a valiant man? You think you can hunt? I want to see you try it when your prey hunts you right back. Your little dogs won't be much good to you when the wolf gets a hold of their throats. This one certainly wasn't."
"I came upon an old kit of mine here tonight," he said at last. "My emergency supply, long ago secreted away and more recently forgotten about entirely. It was hidden in my best acorn hole after all this time, the hollow space I created in the leg of my headboard. I suppose you and Mrs. Hudson never found it."
That arm he moved experimentally in the air, extending it and straightening it, raising and lowering. His fingers tucked into his shirt danced and tested at the joint as it moved. Finally, a position suited him, but he seemed more sombre than pleased to discover it. His arm hung in midair, his hand outstretched, reaching to touch something in his imagination I could not see.
"That was part of it, yes. The timepiece an explorer carries on expedition is unlikely to be in pristine condition."
"No, I changed my mind at your door in the middle of the night. There, I arrived at the proper realization that your professional efforts were entirely unnecessary as my anxiety about my various symptoms was merely one of the symptoms itself."
"But I am alive to bear it. As are you," I said, my voice unsteady. "Do you believe we would be sitting here in this moment had you not pulled the trigger?"
Holmes tried to stay logical. He tried to focus on the plan for their survival solidifying in his mind. But he found himself leaning into the warm and bristled give of Watson's several days unshaven neck with his weary head anyway, even as he shook it in vehement disagreement over the delay. His voice scratched badly when he could muster it.
My grip on him did not slip as he tried to pull away. Holmes relented, but he did not quite meet my eyes.
Abruptly, he pivoted Holmes about on one chair leg, and dropped him with a leaden jolt. While the ensuing flash of pain passed, Thorne took Holmes' head in one meat claw and jerked it toward the port side wall. Vision focused and the pain returned anew.
He took his time. He leaned in. His breath flickered off of my skin. I tried not to watch him watching me, but found the effort entirely impossible. His attention was a physical sensation.
"It seems that things have gone sooo bad for you, my dear consultant," Moriarty chuckles in Sherlock's head. He ignore him. Sherlock look for a more comfortable position and a handle to hang the IV bags.
<< Me, yes >> concludes John. << Obviously she did not know that I was, in reality, the shrew who used you only for sex. I think if she had found out that I am Jahanna...I would not have come out alive from that asylum >> John says.
<< The apple pie? Sherlock, you ate it yesterday morning to celebrate the ending of our last criminal investigation >>.
<< Now the vegetables >> insists her, by pinching a piece of carrot which she puts in his mouth without much compliments.
<< What should I think about, huh? >> scout Sherlock. << His hands? His breath on my neck? The splash that wet my skin? To his tongue in my mouth? Should I be thinking about this? >>.
<< Congratulations daddy. I would like to offer you a cigarette but you don't smoke and I stopped >>.
<< I'm sorry, Edward >> sobbing, stroking Sherlock's damp hair with her hand. << I never wanted anyone to be hurt. I always trembled when my father or brothers brought an injured stranger home. I knew he wasn't going home, whether there was snow or not. They cleaned them of everything and then, when they took them to the pit, they left them there to die >>.
<< Take him away >> Greg orders two of his men who approach the master. << What happened, Sherlock, what did that bastard do to you? >> Greg asks approaching him.
He discovers, John, by kissing the man who loves, how curative the truth is. Once the weight of fears, of the sense of duty, of the memories has been removed, he lives this beautiful moment with serenity, touching Sherlock's long and slim body with his hands, holding him in an embrace perhaps too possessive, but which he now needs.
<< In a way too. The third phase is the worst and it comes after a very careful selection. Prepared by the promises filled in the second phase, the young are eager to be invited to private seminars, led by people of dubious professionalism who call themselves Masters. They come to quarrel with each other by committing real acts of cyberbullying. The tutors and the Masters instigate cyber bullying, leading the young to real media fights with devaluation and public humor to the detriment of those who want to leave the group or who have spoken to dangerous people for the safety of the portal or who do not satisfy to Master's requests. It is a sort of natural selection. Those who survive pass to the third phase, those who do not hold commit suicide. Suicide is encouraged not only by peers vying to enter the coveted third phase, but also by those who manage the portal >>.
<< Oh, no, Mary >> Hataway chuckles, apologizing to John with his eyes. << Captain Watson is no longer on duty and is here looking for a friend of his who is disappeared >> he says, pointing to the poster.
"Bingo!" James exclaims amused. "And, look a little bit, now you are naked too. You also have this thing in common with them, ”he says, invading Sherlock's personal space. "Was it Johnny-boy who undressed you, Sherlock? He ripped your shirt off you, blew the buttons all over the place, that naughty boy, and you laughed. Oh, if you laughed. I still have your laugh in my head. You were excited. So excited that your penis hurt you the way he pressed against the flap of his pants, admit it" Moriarty says with a mischievous wink. "When John pulled your pants off you, it was a sweet relief, as well as the beginning of the best part."
He walks away ready to respond with a kick, but, moving with unexpected agility, Martin grabs him by the hair and violently slams his healthy cheek against the wall.
<< She could not, even she want it >> John mumbles, who still watches at the woman while she jovial talk with the old man.
He eventually reached the top of the upcropping of rocks. Once he was beside the largest boulder obstructing his view, he could finally see down into another cove. The bay beyond it formed a tiny natural harbour, with a buoy anchored there. A buoy with no boat.
Lestrade reminding him of his responsibility to John, and subsequently Manderley, was a bit heavy-handed, but then of course Lestrade was right. He had been selfish to bring his own insecurities down on the other man, but it was tiring attempting to be the saviour. Could he really be the hero of the hour everyone wanted him to be?
Sherlock had already come to learn their new home better than any other place preceding it, a relief after traveling from hotel to hotel (and, for one memorable evening, imposing on his brother). They had previously lived like vagabonds, with nothing in the world beyond a good coat and a good dog. Which had suited him just fine.
“Are you feeling better?” John asked, with more urgency than Sherlock thought was warranted. “Well enough to have a chat, I mean?”
In Sherlock’s clutches, John was catapulted up past the top of the highest building, nearly losing his cane and wits in the process. The henchmen chasing them were crushed by hard stone in the ensuing meeting of the walls, which John could only assume was Sherlock’s doing.
“I can’t lie to you Mr Watson, there is something that I’ve been wanting to ask you about for ages. Is there any chance of you reviving the Manderley fancy dress ball?”
He was beginning to understand Watson handled discomfort with humour, and his humour ran rather sardonic.
Everyone’s attention returned to the doctor, John and the Colonel both exhaling in relief, though for somewhat differing reasons. Meanwhile, Sherlock’s gaze narrowed in on the Doctor’s notes, reading the writing upside down.
Sherlock waved his left hand dismissively, taking hold of John’s arm in his other as he ushered him out. “I only cared about questioning you when the outcome had been unclear, you can tell me everything in the car.”
Sherlock ignored him completely, electing instead to continue their work on Anderson. Sherlock’s face was splotchy, in some places partially blue-purple, and glowing gold in others. Their antennae were no longer hidden beneath their hair, and they twitched as Sherlock’s hands moved inside the bot.
Sherlock tugged at one of the sleeves hanging loosely at their sides. “Let’s go back. You’ve seen all you would wish to, I assume.”
“Sherlock,” Watson said, and the surprise of hearing his Christian name caused Sherlock to lose his grip on the chair arm. So as to not fall forward, he overcorrected, sliding backward.
John then reported back to Greg’s grim hologram projection that the broken unit he had come to fix was fine, and that the bot that had needed repairs after two days was also handled.
Sherlock’s hands moved as he spoke, before settling on tugging at his hair. John gripped his shoulder, presumably to calm him. “I admit it’s strange, but it’s all fine now,” John said, speaking gently. “Sherlock, you can’t solve everything.”
