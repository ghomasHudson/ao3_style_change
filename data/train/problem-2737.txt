“Dean, don't be a dick, okay? Even family members can have secrets. Cas has his reasons for keeping his secrets. I don't understand why you're so angry. If you still think of Cas as your friend, why don’t you talk to him?” Eddie lost his patience for facing up to unreasonable Dean. He closed the locker door and turned away.
“Dean, just talk to Cas. Okay? He has listened to you for many years, could you just listen to him for once?” Dean’s temper is not good, and even they are brothers, Sam couldn't stand Dean sometimes. Dean seems to have many friends but Castiel is the only one who could tolerate him for so many years. Besides, Castiel and Sam are also good friends, Sam didn’t want his elder brother have a trouble with his good friend.
“Is he okay?” When the paramedics lifted Henry on a stretcher, Buck asked one of the paramedic stood beside them.
Eddie and Castiel have been a couple for a month, and Dean knew it’s time to give them a blessing. After helping to prepare some party snacks, he looked for Eddie and Castiel in the crowd. He didn’t see Castiel, but he did see Eddie and Buck walking towards the changing room. He wondered what they were doing, and after thinking about it for a while, he decided to go to the changing room.
“Painting class, the after school program.” Eddie walked from the kitchen back to the living room after putting the ice-cream into the freezer. He didn’t sit down, just stood and responded to Buck.
Thank you very much for reading this story and hope you could enjoy it. It's not an easy task for me to write in English, but it's a very wonderful experience for me! Love you and especially thanks to the people who left me a kudos!!
“He... I...” Dean looked up at his brother, who was half a head taller than him, and he lost his words. He then realized he was still in uniform, and his 24-hour shift work would not end until noon tomorrow. Dean had no idea what he should or wanted to do, except that the thought of meeting Castiel was lingering in his mind.
“Come on, you know that I’m always gonna be here for you. Alright, I can tell you’re obsessing over this already... I’ll make you a deal. If ten years we’re both still single and neither of us have found anybody, we’ll be boyfriends, a couple, together forever.” It was a banter for Buck, who just wanted to comfort his best friend.
“Yeah, that was a really good time, and that’s the day we met.” Buck looked at Eddie's touching face, and that warmed him up too. “I made two of them, one for you and one for me. You know I just wanted to do something you would like.” Buck raised the soda in his hand, “Here's to the girls... and the boys. Fuck them!”
Eddie laughed at the awkward smile of his adorable son. Eddie stroked Christopher’s hair, recalling when Castiel had offered to arrange speech therapy for Christopher, and he had refused at first, but finally agreed to Castiel’s suggestion. Eddie and Castiel had been dating for nearly a month, and they had only dated twice alone. They spent most of time in Eddie’s home with Christopher. Castiel not only accompanied Christopher to do some pronunciation exercises, but also guided him in his homework. Castiel is really more like a teacher, as Christopher said.
Dean kissed Castiel all along his chest and almost every inch of Castiel’s body. He then gave Castiel a hand job. Dean felt a sense of success in watching Castiel release from his hands and body, turning pink and making those delightful moaning sounds, making his penis get a little harder. Kissing and touching were no longer enough for Dean, so he decided to get out of bed, find his jeans on the floor and get a condom and disposable lube from the pocket of it.
“I’m your best friend, who is more qualified than me to plan a date and find a partner for you? Buck was exciting and looking straight at Eddie. “He is a language therapist, and he loved children. You and Christopher will like him very much.”
“Really? Wow, that’s great!” Eddie hugged Buck with excitement. “Then I'll be able to help you with your trainings next.”
“I wanna let everyone know that you’re mine.” Dean said while moving his hand around Castiel’s waist down to Castiel’s cock, and then gave it a gentle squeeze. Castiel rolled his eyes at Dean, shuddered and moaned.
“Shall we continue with what we were doing before that?” Buck’s face flushed, and he looked down at the ground with embarrassment.
“They’re over there.” Dean told Castiel. Eddie waved at Dean, and Buck also turned and waved to them. This was Dean’s second visit to this restaurant, and he had a feeling he would be eating a lot of strawberry pies this time.
“What?” Dean was stunned and looked at Eddie with eyes wide open.” Didn’t you guys just be together for a month? What the hell is going on?”
Buck recalled Castiel said Dean didn't know about his sexual interest and he didn't want Castiel to be embarrassed, so he tried to make up an excuse. “well… I just got a text from that guy, he couldn’t make it suddenly, so I asked Cas to come over to join us dinner…”
“Yeah, Eddie is bi, not gay. At least both of you like chicks.” Sam put down the dish in his hand and looked at Dean.
“Here, it will cheer you up. It’s a… birthday present. But don't get too excited, it’s not too much, you know I'm a poor student who just graduated…” Buck handed Eddie a paper bag.
“Do you remember you asked me what I want the most before? I said I didn’t know, but in fact I did. And I knew that no matter how hard I tried, I would never get what I wanted, because what I wanted was you --Dean Winchester! I fell in love with you the first year we met...” Tears welled in Castiel's eyes, but he really didn’t want to shed tears in front of Dean.
“Hey, Maddie!” Buck yelled and wanted to get back the paper napkin. But Maddie had stood up and turned around.
“Is this a proposal?” Buck didn’t think much about it before he blurted out. But when he saw Eddie’s complicated look, he immediately regretted it. Did he misunderstand something? What did Eddie mean by that statement? He hung his head and didn’t dare to look at Eddie.
“Really?” Maddie gave an ambiguous smile. “Huh? The Valentine’s Day after ten years? Isn’t that just less than four months? You’re both single right now, soon it will be time for you and Eddie to be a couple, how sweet!” She said and looked very happy.
“Eddie, are you okay?” Buck helped Eddie up and checked Eddie’s face for injuries. The punch mark on Eddie’s face made Buck feel a heartache.
Castiel was shocked and stunned, his eyes were as big as saucers. Dean’s lips were so soft. Then all of a sudden Dean started biting Castiel lower lip. A little painful made Castiel opened his mouth slightly, and he felt Dean’s tongue is touching his teeth. It seemed that Dean want to put his tongue into Castiel’s mouth, so he closed his eyes and let Dean to do what he wanted.
“Cas and Eddie broke up.” Although he still felt very confused, he spilled the beans to Sam. When Sam started to ask him for more information, the alarm at the fire station suddenly went off, and Dean took the opportunity to escape on the excuse of going on field duty.
“Well, he is playing both teams, but I guess he prefers chicks. He will surely get his hands on if he sees someone good, why would he introduce to me then?” Eddie opened the door of the restaurant. “Also, he works at a gay bar, and the guy he wants to hook me up with is one of the regulars who they’ve known each other for few years... guess that guy is not his cup of tea.”
“Dean, I didn’t mean to hide anything from you, and I’m really sorry. I just came here to tell you that Eddie and I are together... and I don’t want you to hear about it from him.” Castiel turned around and prepared to leave after saying his words.
“Time has gone by so quickly. It will soon be a new year. We even didn’t know each other last year.” Dean sipped his beer.
Castiel looked at the back of the person who he had been loving for so long, he also tried to stop him, but he got nothing to say. He stretched out his right hand as if he were trying to catch something, but he knew he couldn't catch anything, and he had just lost his best friend.
“Well, but it doesn't mean I’m 'homophobic. I… prefer my partners not to have the same equipment as me. I just can't understand gay men.” Dean lowered his eyes and whispered.
Buck didn't have any date at all tonight. He knew that Eddie and Castiel would welcome him if he wanted to stay. But he didn't want to stay. Buck made up his mind to hook up Eddie and Castiel because he knew they would get along well. But ever since the night Eddie met Castiel, Buck has felt like his heart was being emptied.
“If there’s no disasters in the world, and we don’t need firefighters anymore… You will lose your job, Dean.” Castiel cocked his head to the side.
Castiel showed the painful look. Whenever Dean’s name was mentioned, Castiel would show that look. Although it only lasted very briefly, Eddie could still catch it clearly.
“Dean, Cas probably has some reasons. Why don’t you talk to him?” Sam stood next to Dean with a cloth in his hand.
“No, I didn’t tell you his name or his job neither, so you didn’t figure out it was him. But thanks for introducing Eddie to me, he’s really nice, just like you said.” Castiel looked up with a smile on his face.
“Oh, fuck… me too.” Dean thrusted in ever deeper and harder, and then both of them gasped and shot at the same time.
“Eddie, I’m sorry... about all of this... I’m sorry anyway.” After that Dean left the changing room like he was running away. The thought of meeting Castiel filled Dean’s mind. He didn’t know what he was going to say to Castiel, but he knew he had to meet him.
“Oh, Eddie, I'm sorry. I can't believe she picked the Valentine's Day to dump you.” The waiter brought Buck a soda.
“Why? Is he busy with something?” It was a holiday, and Buck wondered why Castiel hadn’t shown up here.
After listening to Eddie’s explanation of how he “accidentally” slammed into the locker door and got a facial injury, Bobby didn’t say anything, he just kept scanning between Dean and Eddie.
“Cas, you know how dangerous my job is, right? I’m afraid I will die before the day of Sam’s college graduation sometimes. You know I’m his only family member, and if I wasn’t there, I can’t imagine what he’d be like.” After having a couple of beers, Dean started to order something stronger. He had a lot of drinking this evening, and seemed a little drunk. Castiel knew that Dean had lost a colleague from another fire station in a fire which had broken out on the day before Christmas Eve. Dean was still upset for it.
“I drove for nearly twenty hours. I’m still exhausted though I’ve taken a nap.” Dean took the seat next to Castiel without any hesitation. He looked like a mess.
“It’s Cas’s first time coming over tonight. You know, meeting Christopher. I want to do something special.”
“Uh, I don't have a problem with this... you know, about the same-sex relationship thing, but don't you think it's better to find Christopher a mother instead of another father?” Dean frowned slightly.
“I think I deserve a kiss before that...” Eddie cupped Buck’s face in both hands and slowly leaned into him.
“We got a pulse!” A paramedic was so exciting to say it after using the AED to shock Henry twice. All of the people inside the bar applauded when they heard the great news and Buck felt relieved finally.
“You two should have been together a long time ago. It’s disgusting to see you guys eye-fucking each other every time you’re around.” Sam said with a bitchy look on his face. Surprisingly to Dean, Sam not only did not disagree, but actually supported them. He only complained about Dean’s stupidity and made Castiel wait for ten years. After three months of dating, Castiel moved into Dean’s apartment and they started living together.
Buck is not only Eddie’s best friend, but also a very special and unique person for Eddie. Eddie was so happy when Buck offered him “The ten-year plan”. Although he knew it was just a joke to comfort him, he had imagined that he and Buck would be a couple in ten years and how happy they will. He decided to keep this fantasy in his heart forever after he met Shannon. After Shannon had passed away, Eddie was too busy taking care of Christopher and working. Also, Buck was always around, so he didn’t bring up their plan. It wasn’t until Buck offered to introduce Castiel to him that he realized Buck remembered the plan.
“Aren’t you angry? Cas has been cheating us for so long...” Dean glanced at Sam. “Wait, you... did you know all along?” Dean threw the sponge to the sink hard and stared at Sam.
When Dean decided to make the long trip to Lawrence to meet Castiel, he really just wanted to tell him how much he missed him and how much he wanted to be with him. Dean didn’t intend to sleep with Castiel as soon as he met him. But now he was glad he was prepared. He had never done it with a guy before, but he had tried anal with Lisa several years ago, and he had only entered a little before she stopped because it was so hurt.
“I don’t have much of a life, so unfortunately I don’t need much help in the babysitting department,” Castiel says, sounding genuinely regretful. “But I appreciate the offer.”
Now, more than anything else, he appreciates the fact that it’s coolest at this time of day. The temperatures climb high enough during the heat of the day that he’s learned to appreciate the opportunity to work in peace without sweat trying its best to roll into his eyes when it comes.
The man kindly doesn’t mention the length of time it took him to string together a basic sentence. “First time here?” he asks, clearly recognizing how overwhelmed he feels.
He leaves before long, intent on starting his route for the day. The heat finally does catch up to Dean while he’s in the eastern orchard surveying how the year’s fruit trees are coming along. Fortunately, his location means he has an abundance of shade, and it turns out the apples are, in fact, nearly ripe enough for picking. With no one around to judge him for doing so, Dean sprawls among the roots of one particularly shady tree and crunches into a tart apple. Some of the juice runs down the side of his hand, but he lets it be while he chases the rest of the fruit down to the core.
By the time all the detritus of the afternoon’s tree decorating is packed away, it’s nearly time to get ready for dinner. Dean doesn’t usually have much occasion to wear a suit, but he takes extra time to make sure everything looks neat, finishing it all off with a few dabs of the nice cologne Cas got him last Christmas. He inspects himself in the mirror before heading out to meet the rest of them. Definitely good enough for dinner at a swanky restaurant. He cleans up good, if he’s allowed to say that.
Dean scoffs. “C’mon, you can’t really think a car like this deserves anything less than premium. Not really filling me with confidence, here, dude.”
“We’re not allowed to use the top-secret gas pumps if the customer is out of the car,” Castiel explains, perfectly straight-faced. “Looks like your car survived someone going within ten feet of her.”
A stick cracks underfoot in the distance, and Dean scrambles to get to his feet, dropping his apple to the ground in the process. He relaxes slightly once he sees a familiar figure heading across the grass towards him, and casts a regretful glance down at his abandoned snack, now smudged with dirt.
Dean stands outside for another minute after he hangs up and tucks his phone back into his pocket, watching his breath plume into the air and listening to the muffled sounds of conversation inside. The scuff of shoes on brick brings him back to himself, looking to the side to see someone step out from the shadow of one of the columns, glass in hand.
The clerk doesn’t look offended, but he does stay exactly where he is, almost as if he’s waiting for something.
Michael waves him off. “It will come with time, Raphael. Perhaps he simply lacks the proper motivation to take an interest in these things. Marriage, for a start. Taking pride in the estate one’s family will inherit does not come naturally to the unwed.”
special I wouldn’t be trying this hard to keep up with the latest obsession, but it’s just me and her, so it’s the least I can do. I’m just glad she still tells me what the latest thing is, you know? She’s only fourteen, so she hasn’t gone full-blown teenage angst yet where it’s uncool to talk to her dad, but I know it’s coming.”
Too anxious to respond properly, Dean instead ushers Charlie into the store and gives his name to the clerk behind the counter. He drums his fingers against the glass display before he realizes he probably shouldn’t, and tries to casually swipe his shirtsleeve across the glass to wipe away any fingerprints he might’ve left. Charlie just keeps watching him with a knowing look as the clerk makes her way back, a small velvet box in hand.
Castiel looks away. “A surprising number of people asked about my name on a daily basis. Steve is easier.”
could’ve handled this better, but if there’s one thing he knows about Cas, it’s that he’s the master of good intentions. Besides, it’s not like Dean isn’t familiar with having a complicated relationship with family.
Dean only realizes he’s rambling when it clicks that the man in front of him has that look of polite interest that makes it hard to tell whether he’s actually listening or if he’s zoning out. “Sorry, get me talking about Emma and I’ll go for hours. You don’t even work here, do you?”
Dean begins sketching out the fantastical elements of the plot that have kept him so entertained while Castiel settles in behind him, content to just listen. Even with countless moments like this ahead of them, he cherishes each one as much as when their time together was rare as the roses Dean brought him.
He copies Cas’s carelessly scrawled number into his contacts list in the parking lot of a rest area just outside Pittsburgh and sends him a picture of his hand on the nozzle as he fills up the gas tank while he’s at it.
Fortunately, his phone buzzes after a few minutes of bland conversation about how the merger will affect their departments, saving him from the possibility of having to make conversation with any of them.
Only a short moment after he realizes his luck in avoiding most of the household through his route, he turns a corner and sees his brother, looking as brightly alert as ever, heading down the hall towards him. He mutters a curse and turns on his heel, heading the way he came.
“You know, I think I’m starting to get why people like it here,” Dean says meditatively. He’s started feeling much less aggravated by everything about the whole state lately. “The weather sucks, and there’s way too many damn people on the road, but this is worth at least a little bit of the hassle.”
As they trail behind her up the stairs, Anna says, “Cas, you’re in your old room. Dean, we’ve got you next door in the guest room Jack usually stays in - don’t worry, we cleaned out all the kid stuff. No risk of stuffed toys starting to talk to you in the middle of the night.”
Dean waves him off. “You’re busy enough on your own without worrying about me. Even busier, I’m sure, with the visitors arriving. My tasks will stay the same, guests or no guests.”
“I might have actually enjoyed it were you able to accompany me.” Castiel looks thoughtful as he traces along the edges of Dean’s shirt, made of a much nicer material than his usual wear while working the grounds. He wonders if it looks as false to Castiel as it feels to wear it. “Especially with this on.”
The kid lifts his hand in greeting but apparently forgets to wave it. It’s maybe more endearing than it should be. “Hello!”
Dean winces, just as much for accidentally stumbling onto a difficult topic as the memory of parenting a kid that age without any backup. “Hard to get a break?”
“Dean.” One of Cas’s hands reaches across the bench, palm turned upwards, waiting. “You know I’m not the closest with my family. Spending Christmas together is the only real interaction I usually have with them outside of the occasional text. But Michael’s heading up a merger of the family business that’ll expand things nationwide, and
The few seconds it takes to turn the engine off and pocket his keys feels like forever, but as soon as he’s out of the car Cas’s arms go around him in a tight hug, and he thinks it was worth every second of waiting.
Dean nods and smiles in all the right places as Cas introduces Hester, Rachel, and Inias, all connected to the company in some way. But he can’t help the way his smile tightens as Hannah says, “Can I talk to you for a second?” and leads Cas away with a hand inside his elbow.
“Back home,” Dean says. He isn’t prepared for the way his stomach drops when Cas’s face falls at his words, but he soldiers on anyway. “Sam and Eileen just broke the news I’m gonna be an uncle in another five months. I had this extended vacation lined up to fix up their house, but I’m gonna need to be a hell of a lot closer if I want to see my niece or nephew more than once in a blue moon once they’re born. Makes more sense to cut this visit short so I can get that ball rolling.”
“Well, I think you’re very generous to keep trying. It must be for someone special if you’re giving it another shot.”
Sounding somewhat hoarse, Cas says, “It appears I have wronged you in two ways above all others, for which I need to apologize before anything else. First, that I may have given any appearance of desiring anything related to spending the season in town, or anything else that would require taking my leave of you. And second, regardless of whether I did have any level of interest in these other pursuits, that there is anything else I would assign a higher priority than you. I only wish to make you as happy as you have made me from the very day we met.”
He’s had this conversation a million times - mostly Bobby and Ellen giving him shit for it, not as his bosses, but as the closest thing he has to parents anymore - but Castiel doesn’t sound judgmental, just curious. “Hey, you can take my baby’s keys away from me when I’m dead. Until then, ain’t nothing that can keep me away from her.”
Out of habit, Dean almost denies it, then thinks again. If things are done with Castiel, he may not need to bother with continuing to keep it a secret, not from his brother. “It’s not a something. It’s a someone.”
“Yeah, like I’m gonna make you take the bus instead of letting you get properly acquainted with my baby.” Dean climbs into the driver’s seat, and Cas follows his lead, tucking himself into the passenger side.
Dean does remember that season, though not for reasons anyone would expect. With no need for a gardener to accompany them to the townhouse in the city, the long stretches of a lonely summer stand out in his mind more than any other detail about that time. “I’ll hope for your sake that they prefer to stay indoors, then, so you and I don’t have to stand their presence for long.”
His mother just appears amused by the entire proceedings, and resumes greeting her brother with fondness. Though Castiel bears great affection for his siblings, he still cannot fathom wanting so badly to see them only weeks after returning from town, where he’s told Lord Charles dined nearly nightly with his mother. She returned only a little more than a month ago — surely she cannot have truly begun to miss their company. Yet Lady Amara doesn’t look anything other than glad to see the entire family, welcoming them into their home with no apparent sign of the apprehension Castiel feels at having his space invaded.
Castiel’s fingers drift across the soft surface of the alpaca yarn in his own basket. Dean isn’t quite sure why he’s so invested in his response until Castiel says, “Actually, that does sound nice,” and Dean lets out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding.
Castiel’s momentum carries Dean backwards until he’s pressed against the tree behind him. A smart remark dies on his lips as they’re captured by Castiel’s, and he clutches at the fine fabric of his jacket with a fervor matching the hands in his hair.
He’s resigned himself to being alone this year. And he told Cas he didn’t mind, really, Cas will be back for New Year’s Eve anyway, but-
“Educated-” Dean cuts himself off before he stick his foot in his mouth any further, and hands over his rewards card so Steve can run it. “Well, Steve, here’s the thing-”
“A problem for next year, at least. And my cousins will be gone soon enough, regardless. Only another week to survive.”
“Well, if she’s just starting out, that one’s probably a little difficult for a beginner to work with,” the man says helpfully, lifting the tail end of one of the yarns in Dean’s hands. “See how thin it is? Probably better to stick with something a bit more robust for now.”
Dean snorts as he turns over the engine. “You have any idea how much driving I had to do to keep finding excuses to come see you? I don’t normally waste that much gas, Cas. Learned my lesson last time and filled up at Valley Forge, so I’m ready to get out of here if you are.”
Dean steps away in one smooth motion, putting distance between them as if nothing ever happened. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Castiel tug his riding gloves over his hands in quick, precise motions, until the pale skin of his hands disappears beneath black leather.
“You good?” Dean looks Cas up and down, taking in the slightly frantic look in his eyes and the creases in the cuffs of his jacket where he’s been clutching at the fabric.
The question seems to put him back in the kid’s good graces, enough to let him turn off the engine and wait right next to the pump for Cas to arrive. He’s busy texting Sam, fielding questions on how long, exactly, it takes a guy to run out and pick up paint, when he hears footsteps approaching behind him. “I think Alfie’s worried I might have a stalker,” comes Cas’s amused rumble from the open window next to him.
Dean is fortunate enough that his position places him far from any likelihood of dealing with their guests. Occasionally he spots them riding by on horseback, trampling the carefully-groomed lawn as they go, but on the whole he counts himself lucky not to suffer their whims on a daily basis. Lady Amara rarely hosts guests — occasionally one or two at a time and typically for a short period, so hosting her brother’s entire family puts more than the typical strain on her staff. He supposes they should all be grateful it happens so infrequently.
“Of course, my lady,” Benny says easily. He gestures for her to move forward and leads the horse away so she can mount up, doing so in a single smooth motion. She nudges the stallion forward, eager as ever to get moving, waiting for her children to catch up.
“You remembered the everything bagel,” Cas says around a mouthful of his pork roll egg and cheese sandwich as Dean sets up next to him, leaning against the trunk of the Impala, the nozzle chugging away in the space between them.
Dean manages to catch his laugh and turn it into a cough, thinking of one of their masters in particular. “Sensible. As you say.”
He manages to survive until after luncheon on the second day with his mother serving as a buffer for conversation. Unfortunately, with the departure of his mother and sister to their upstairs parlor with his aunt, his protection comes to an end.
Took a little longer to finish than expected since this was the part where I strayed the furthest from the movie plotline! This was already a loose adaptation, but here's where I really needed to tone down the angst.
Dean winces and holds him a little tighter. “Yeah, I didn’t mean to go so long between replies today, but, you know. Driving. I wanted it to be a surprise.”
Before he can think too hard about it, Dean jerks the steering wheel to the right and brings the Impala to a rolling stop on the side of the road. Cas reluctantly meets his eyes when Dean turns to look at him, equal parts ashamed and anxious, framed by the desolate snow-covered cornfield out the window behind him.
“Dean,” he says, and returns the skeins to the shelf so he has a free hand to offer. He realizes too late what he’s done, but Castiel’s already shaking his hand with a faintly amused smile, so he figures he isn’t being judged too hard. “So if you’re the expert, which one of these do you think would be the best?”
The problem, of course, is that their guests are planning to remain for at least another fortnight. Possibly longer, if they find the country to their liking.
Dean can scarcely believe his ears. “You have, Cas,” he says, voice breaking. He cannot imagine how Castiel could possibly think otherwise.
at a dark-haired woman approaching their table, and Dean’s so thrown by seeing more expression on his face than he’s seen since they arrived that he nearly misses the way Cas goes tense at his side.
“Nah, thanks for dealing with the helicopter parent routine. It’s just not what I’m used to, you know?”
Cracking the door open, Dean only has to see a familiar rumpled coat before he swings the door wider. “What’s up?”
, it reads. Curious clerk on a smoke break, he guesses. His baby attracts her fair share of attention wherever she goes.
Dean only hears Cas’s thoughtful hum above the hiss of gas because they’re standing so close. “Wouldn’t dream of it,” he echoes.
It’s almost creepy, how Cas knows what he’s thinking sometimes. “I don’t mind. Really. Besides, you’re gonna be gone almost all of next week.”
“Some. Most people are at least from the tri-state area, so they’re not as surprised as you are. I don’t see Kansas plates very often.”
“I suppose that’s what I mean, yes.” Castiel keeps his voice carefully smooth to avoid betraying how weary he is of this line of conversation.
He’s well aware he shouldn’t be anywhere near here. It’s a sight he’s well familiar with, given his frequent need to leave the day’s arrangement in full view for Castiel to enjoy. He rarely enters for any other reason, well aware there’s too much risk that an errant maidservant might pass by while tidying. But in the aftermath of the ball, only just now winding down with precious few hours left until dawn, the entire house will be abed, the staff’s schedule shifted to accommodate the late hour. No one should be anywhere near here for hours to come.
At least he’s seated next to Jack, so he has the option of tuning in to the little guy’s thoughts on his gourmet kiddie burger and asking him to catch up on the latest developments in children’s television since the last time he had occasion to turn it on for Sam. It doesn’t entirely block out the sounds of all the others bonding over how cute Cas and Hannah looked at prom, or the time she went on the family skiing trip, or any number of fondly-remembered stories, though, and Dean spends most of dinner trying to look like absolutely none of this is bothering him. The only comfort he has is that Cas looks like he’s fighting the same battle.
mean that that luxury is afforded to the eldest. Castiel will have much the same responsibilities as I do, once he marries. With it will come more of the estate management.”
“How can you possibly be comfortable in this?” Dean asks, running a finger underneath the fine linen of the cravat. The light pressure of his finger against his neck, even through the doubled layers of fabric protecting his neck, sends a noticeable shiver through Castiel. He doesn’t seem to notice the way Dean’s finger slips with intent under the knot of the cravat.
“Oh, so now I’m the sad roommate with no family to speak of, huh?” Dean huffs out an annoyed breath and looks away. He takes a minute to compose himself before he speaks again. “I wish you’d told me. Or told them, either one would’ve worked.”
Michael’s speech starts with the usual platitudes. A new era for the company, expansion into other sectors allowing a new level of innovation, a lot of big buzzwords that ultimately mean nothing. Dean’s too busy scanning the crowd to fully listen until his eyes finally catch on Cas at the far side of the room.
Damn traffic. Bad enough that Dean should’ve been at Sam’s new place a few hours ago if not for being unlucky enough to hit the tail end of rush hour, but he also blew through most of his last quarter tank of gas in just a few short miles. There’s a reason he’s only been up to visit Sam a few times since he landed a cushy job at one of the law firms in the city, and it’s not just because Philly’s so far from Kansas.
Cas makes a thoughtful noise as he starts the nozzle. “How much closer are you thinking?” he says, face inscrutable.
It takes all of Dean’s effort to suppress his reaction to Raphael’s words. That’s certainly one way to say it. Even as a child Castiel exasperated more than one minder by leaving the house to wander the gardens, following a stray bird or insect until he was thoroughly lost within the maze of pathways. The habit only worsened the last few years as he gained more free reign of the property, though it was partially the chance of bumping into Dean along the way that kept him so thoroughly engaged along with the gardens themselves.
Michael tuts. He must think Castiel is brushing off his uncle’s question. “I should think you’d be aware of any recent additions, cousin. Do you mean to say that my aunt has not yet introduced you to at least a few duties of financial management?”
Castiel’s smile dims slightly. “I wound up as his legal guardian when his mom passed last year. But it was a relief to have some familiar things to make the transition easier on Jack. He’s got a honeycomb blanket at home to match, too. Now he can’t go to sleep without it, so I may have made things more difficult for myself in the long run.”
“Several years now, for both knitting and crochet. It came in handy when my godson was born.” Castiel digs his phone out of his pocket and navigates around the screen until he lands on a picture of a grinning infant wearing a striped knit bee hat, complete with little black antennae. The mittens and booties he’s wearing are similarly striped black and yellow. Dean’s not surprised the woman holding the baby in the photo looks as charmed by the entire getup as she does.
He’s not entirely sure why he thought he should talk to Sam about this, now of all times — perhaps later, once he’s had time to come to terms with it himself, but for right now Sam’s attempts at rationally discussing it do nothing but make him feel worse. Dean abruptly disengages between one platitude and the next, citing a need for privacy, and Sam backs off with a wounded look that only makes Dean feel even worse.
The most significant difference is that most of his various daily tasks around the estate are solitary, or near enough — sometimes working alongside a partner, such as Benny, whose company he enjoys, or Mr. Singer, who knows that quiet can have its own place. Recently he’s also had the newcomers to deal with, making the small staff quarters feel even more cramped in comparison.
After Dean introduces himself, he and Kelly stand off to the side making small talk about the weather and the holiday traffic while Jack talks Cas’s ear off about the snowmen and snow angels he made earlier in the day. The kid
“You say that now, but wait until Lord Charles hears about your gardens. You’ve not met them before, have you?” Dean shakes his head, and Benny laughs, clapping him soundly on the back. “You’re in for a treat, brother.”
He knows that Dean’s duties have only picked up in the past year since Mr. Singer singled him out to train as his replacement, and to see him finally getting to rest in the way he deserves stirs a tender feeling in his chest. Although he can imagine the complaints Dean would make if he were awake, he still allows himself to linger over the sight for a few moments longer. He’s quite certain he would give up rather a lot more than Dean realizes if he were allowed to have this daily.
After enough people decide to head up to bed, Dean lingers at the base of the stairs and then splits off to the kitchen on a hunch. He’s right - he did see Cas disappear into the kitchen.
Just as Castiel feared when he first heard of the visit, the arrival of his aunt, uncle, and cousins brings nothing but noise and chaos to the otherwise quiet estate. From the very moment of their arrival, before Lord Charles can even get a word out after exiting their carriage, Lady Naomi casts an appraising glance across the modest front of the estate and, evidently, finds it wanting. She sniffs, makes a perfunctory greeting to the lady of the house, and then loudly begins discussing the latest modifications to their own home as the remainder of her offspring begin unloading from the second carriage in the procession.
Anna heads over to them after Jack’s safely upstairs. “I’m sure after a drive like that you want to get settled. Here, I can show you your rooms. ”
Still, it’s only thanks to Lady Amara’s generosity that he had the chance to develop his natural intelligence into something useful. Not every gentlewoman would allow the children of the estate’s workers any access to her own private tutors, let alone pay attention to reports of his bright mind and personally finance an advanced education for him. Sam could’ve gone into law, if he’d so chosen — he certainly was intelligent enough for it — but instead he chose to repay his loyalty, taking on more of an active role in managing the estate’s finances to keep it sound, adding more responsibilities for himself year after year. There’s no one Lady Amara trusts more, and Dean’s damn proud of him for it.
“You know, there are other things you could be enjoying instead,” Dean says, tracing his finger up the stiffly starched line of Castiel’s collar.
“Oh, by all means,” Castiel says, all serious as if it’s the most reasonable thing in the world, and Dean only has a fleeting moment to realize he might be in trouble before he’s following Castiel back to the trunk.
“You know how nice Sam’s fancy lawyer McMansion is. Me and the mutt are living it up. How are things there? Figured out the right moment to pop the question yet?”
“Well, I had to make sure you weren’t enjoying yourself too much without me,” Dean says, keeping his voice intentionally light. If he cannot have Castiel for much longer, he refuses to allow any of their remaining time together to be marred by his own fears.
Turns out he wouldn’t, but Dean knew that already. The first bite is nothing short of heavenly, all the flavors bursting across his tongue, and the warm wrapper in his hands is a nice bonus against the chill morning air.
If he must be expected to give up Castiel to the whims of courtship and marriage, he’s aware he damn well better take advantage of any remaining time he has left.
You rolled your eyes at him and stood. You took a parting drink of your tea before walking over to the bed.
“I think, maybe, this plant is messing with the local werewolf population. But the thing is, it’s not supposed to
“Alright.” You instructed, slamming the car door shut. “Let’s get in, get out, and stay quiet. It looks like the neighbors are home, and I don’t feel like jumping out of a locked window to avoid police. Again.” You darted your eyes, checking for witnesses before speed-walking up the driveway to the front door.
“Yeah, I’m fine. I’m more worried about dinner,” He gestured to the mess around them, “Damn! That’s my favorite pizza place, too.” He huffed.
He slipped the device into his pocket, making his way to the desk and taking a seat on top of it, facing you.
It didn’t take long to fish out the bigger imbedded branches, as he had managed to shake most of them out onto your recently cleaned floor. After the sticks, you picked out the few leaves that were stuck and had been too stubborn to fall out. The worst part was the little pebbles and thorns that had wedged themselves, stubbornly, between his feathers. The chalky dust matched the color of his dirty wings, camouflaging them quite well.
“Hey, guys. What’s up?” Jack asked, walking towards the couch and sitting a few spots away from Cas. He crossed his legs on the couch, pulling and pushing his knees with his hands, rocking and burning off some of the excess energy he still somehow had.
“The thing is, soulmates rarely connect, in a way that allows cross sight, when they first meet. There has to be a trigger. Or multiple triggers, in stubborn cases.” He side-eyed you. You rolled your eyes and ignored his slight.
, what did he do to that guy from the house? Cas where-“ Words poured out, you frantically looked around the room to no avail.
“Stop being nasty.” You scolded, reaching out and beginning to pick out the bigger twigs and thorns that were imbedded in his wings.
“[Y/N], this is going to require a bit of extra information, so please bear with me.” He furrowed his brow, sympathetically. Like he could possibly know the anxiety you were feeling.
“As opposed to indirectly harmful? Harmful is harmful Cas, what in the hell does that mean?” You breathed, exasperated. You weren’t in the mood for his weird, vague language. He saw your frustration, and began to talk faster.
. It’s described as akin to ‘spoiled goats’ milk and fermented tea.’” You quoted, still amused at the vibrant description. “No one would use this unless they knew what it does.”
“So, anyways, I was thinking: ‘Who would know the most about soulmates?’ And I called up Rowena, and she said she’d dig around and find a summoning spell for a cupid for me!” You exclaimed, “and they’ll tell me I’m right!”
You stole a glance at Lucifer, who was wearing a smile. He followed the man’s orders, however, letting the lighter drop to the floor.
“Sorry, I’ve been very busy lately. Did Cas not play with you?” Buck hadn’t seen Christopher recently because he wanted to avoid Eddie, and he truly felt sorry for him.
“You may not have much of an appetite, but people say desserts can cheer us up, and the strawberry pies here are super good. Well, it's Dean's loss. I think you should try them.” Eddie smiled at Castiel and extended his hands, “I'm Edmundo Diaz, you can call me Eddie. You are Cas, right?”
Castiel opened the closet and unconsciously picked out the blue tie. He looked into the mirror and knotted the blue tie slowly. He thought about Dean, who had always said that the blue tie matched the color of his eyes. A feeling of heartache made Castiel close his eyes, but then he saw a familiar face with those unforgettable green eyes. He recalled the first time they had met.
Castiel was cleaning up and washing the dishes after dinner. He told Eddie that because Eddie did cooking, he would do cleaning up. He insisted on sharing the works with Eddie. Eddie took the time to give Christopher a bath. And then Eddie put Christopher to bed and told him a bedside story. When he was sure Christopher was sleeping, he left the room and closed the door gently.
“Birthday? what are you talking about? My birthday is few months later. Buck!” Eddie took out a gift box from the paper bag, opened it, and there was a photo frame with a picture of them.
Castiel nodded with a smile. It was the next day after the Boxing day. Sam had a dinner with his high school friends and he promised to have a drink with Dean and Castiel, but it he didn’t show up finally.
“I told you we’d be late.” Castiel has been nagging since the moment he got on the Impala. It was because the twenty minutes Dean said he would spend, turned into almost an hour, leaving Castiel with no time to fix his hair, making it look messy.
Castiel didn’t have many friends, only Meg visited him in the hospital besides his family. Balthazar had also been there, but he was immediately driven away by Meg. In the second week of staying in the hospital, an unexpected person showed up.
It is rare for Dean to wear a suit, but he wore a black suit with a blue tie today. He just caught up with a wedding which was held in a beautiful garden. He took an empty seat, listened to the opening words recited by the priest, and looked at the grooms. It’s a wedding of Castiel.
Buck travelled from North America to South America, working and wandering. He hanged out with different girls and boys, living a free and debauched life, and even after he returned to the America and became a bartender, his life pattern didn't change much.
“Cas had dinner with you guys?” Eddie’s words startled Dean. Dean didn’t expect Castiel in the mood for dinner with someone else as Castiel had a bad time with him.
“Wow, should I say thank you for his announcement at this time?” Dean smiled coldly on hearing Eddie’s words.
Today is weekend. The bar is busier than usual. There were couples dating, and some gathering of friends. But most of the customers came to the bar alone and looked for a one-night stand. Buck has just finished mixing a Manhattan, and then another customer ordered a martini. Buck distracted by the sound of a glass shattering when he picked up an olive and wanted to put in the glass. The olive fell onto the table. Then Buck heard noise over somewhere and he realized something was happening.
“It's... No way! You printed it out? That football game... it's really good.” Eddie looked at the photo and smiled, as if recalling the football game. He looked rather happy.
They moved closer and sealing their lips together. Castiel could feel Eddie’s breath on his face. It wasn’t an intense kiss, their tongues were intertwined, exploring each other slowly. Eddie was on top of Castiel, one of his hands was sliding into Castiel’s sweater and caressing him. Castiel knew what was going to happen next: they would kiss a little while, and then make love in Eddie’s room, sometimes he would spend the night with Eddie. He thought may be few months later, he would move to Eddie’s home and live with Eddie and Christopher.
“Uh, I was distracted, what did you just say?" Eddie and Castiel seemed to have a good time during dinner. Castiel is a regular guest at Buck's bar, they've known each other for over three years, and it’s the first time he had seen Castiel laughed so much, Eddie seemed to be entertaining Castiel with his incredible rescue stories. Eddie also seemed to like Castiel very much.
“A new deal?” Buck frowned. He was confused by Eddie’s series of actions. He couldn’t figure out what Eddie was trying to do.
“What?! We’ve known each other for ten years, and you said he told you a few years ago? So when did he tell you? Dean viciously stuffed the dish into Sam's hands.
“Cas, you’re so fucking hot, how could I have never noticed?” Dean knelt on the edge of the bed and looked at Castiel naked.
“Henry, he… I don’t know… We were talking and… he just fell down.” The guy seemed nervous and chaotic.
Dean sat forward on his knees, and let Castiel put his legs around him.  Dean held and slid up and down over his painfully hard penis for a moment and then pushed slowly into the Castiel little hole.
“Why... why are you here?” It’s so surprised for Castiel to see Dean. He didn’t think about he would meet Dean in Lawrence.
“Hello, uh… you probably don’t remember me. I’m Dean Winchester, and I was one of the firefighters who were there on the day of your accident.”
Finally she gets the hint and her smile loses its hint of interest. “Still was nice of you to come along. Let any of us know if you need anything, alright?”
The tip of Castiel’s boot nudges against the apple, and he looks down. “Enjoying the fruits of your labor, are you?” he murmurs, placing another kiss to the palm of his hand where the juice pooled only moments ago.
Castiel lets himself be directed, settling back against the pillows stacked high against the headboard only a moment before Dean climbs into his lap, strong thighs bracketing his own before his mouth finds Castiel’s. Though Castiel can’t find it in himself to complain, there’s a desperate edge to Dean’s kisses that isn’t usually present.
Castiel lets out a laugh at that, the corners of his eyes crinkling in a way that only makes him appear more appealing. “Trust me when I say there is nothing lacking. But I know you’ve been working all night and that you get little enough rest as is. Let me take care of you for once.”
The door opens silently to reveal the study. Neat as it always is, with its trim chairs that hardly ever see use and the desk carefully positioned in front of the window overlooking the gardens. Dean glances over and confirms the main door leading to the hallway is closed, then makes his way silently to the entrance to Castiel’s bedchamber.
“Yeah, you could say that. I didn’t even know they had entire stores for yarn, if I’m being honest - last trip I made was to one of the chain craft stores, and all I heard about afterwards was how quickly their beginner needles broke. Picked up a sturdier pair last week, but apparently I still haven’t earned any slack.”
So Castiel set the flowers on the table beside his bed instead of on the windowsill facing the gardens as he wished. Occupying his rare moments alone at his writing desk in front of the window afforded him as much of a view as he could hope for, looking out over the gardens and the staff who occasionally passed through them.
They rarely have to go quite this long between seeing each other. In passing around the estate, of course, but that always makes it worse rather than better. Tucked away at the edge of their little meadow — a place Dean found, when they agreed on their intention to need use of such a place in order to see each other as regularly as they might be able — they can meet as often as either of them can get away. It’s hardly enough for either of their preference, but given the circumstances, it’s more than they would otherwise have.
Dean swallows thickly. When he speaks, he manages to keep his voice carefully cool.“Would you care for an arrangement to be delivered to your rooms today, my lord? The roses are in excellent bloom.”
“What can I say, you can’t beat the rewards program. Kind of important when you go through as much gas in a year as I do.”
So that’s what Gabriel meant. Safely off to the side, Dean tries to hide a wince as he watches the siblings stretching as high as they can go, delicate glass ornaments in hand. Even Cas looks caught up in it, reaching over top of Anna to place a snowman on one of the highest branches and laughing when she playfully shoves him.
on it. Dean thumbs at it with a faint laugh, and it’s only when Cas follows the motion of his hand and then looks back up at him that Dean realizes how close he’s gotten to him. “See you soon, Cas.”
Although he has no particular complaints about his position, he’s glad that Sam, for one, managed to rise to a far more esteemed station than their background could have ever afforded them. His sharp mind did more for securing his future than their father ever did.
He always knew it would come to this. Perhaps not in so spectacular a fashion, but he never had any misunderstanding that he would be able to keep Castiel so selfishly for himself. He’s avoided facing that truth for a long time, too caught up in the simple daily game of finding the time to gather enough flowers to make Castiel smile, but here it is, caught up with him at last.
Michael and Anna exchange a glance that Dean can’t quite parse, while Gabriel only lifts an eyebrow before resuming their path out of the restaurant. The car ride home is quiet, but then Kelly suggests on her way up to put Jack to bed that they have those drinks anyway, and the good cheer returns as Dean takes charge of doling out drinks.
After all of Cas’s comments about his siblings being a generally awkward bunch that aren’t particularly close, Dean isn’t expecting the greeting that comes once the front door to the swanky brick mansion swings open.
“Truly, I don’t understand how you could miss out on all the entertainment,” Raphael says airily. “Your brother and sister were wonderful company at all the events we attended. One can enjoy the country at any time of year, but now you’ll have to wait several more months before you have any hope of attending anything of any cultural significance whatsoever.”
“I’m starting to get that impression.” Castiel looks down the length of the Impala and says, “So, are you going to let me fill your car up without a fight this time, or do you still need to supervise?”
That’s enough to startle a laugh out of Dean. “No, I’m gonna be glad to be back in the normal world for a little while, even if I’m just packing up to head back here.” He pauses for a second, then admits, “Gotten used to seeing you around, though.”
True to form, Emma’s knitting obsession only lasts about eight months total. Her needles get tucked away in the back of the hall closet, and some of the nicer yarn gets absorbed into Castiel’s collection.
Castiel recognizes the token protest for what it is. “Then I’ll grow more,” he says, as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world. “One each day shouldn’t be enough to deplete the hedges, but even if it did, they’re all for you, regardless. I have quite a number of years worth of flowers to catch up on before I’ve gifted as many as you have.”
Castiel sends a grateful look his way for taking some of the attention onto himself, and curses his mother and sister for abandoning them so carelessly to their fates.
She shakes her head and flashes Cas probably the most genuine smile that Dean’s seen since he got here. “Don’t worry about it. Glad you got in alright.”
“I’m told I have quite the reputation for being cold and unapproachable. Surely it must come with a few benefits when it comes to warm weather.”
The first knitted gift she gives away outside of the dishcloths Dean insists they use in their kitchen is a slightly uneven scarf for Castiel in the same navy yarn he helped pick out. By the time their weekly meetings for some much-needed adult conversation turn into a series of dates that move at a frankly glacial pace given the fact that they both have kids, they’ve both built up quite the collection of scarves and hats. Not to mention that between Castiel and Emma, Jack’s got enough handmade clothing and small toys that it’s hard to find space in his drawers anymore.
Dean might be convinced it was an entirely innocent slip, if he didn’t know any better. He takes a minute to cast an eye around the remainder of the yard as he bends down to pick up the glove. Lady Amara is already setting off at a leisurely walk with Alfred, and Benny and Anna have their heads bent close together, inspecting one of the shoes on her gelding.
Benny flashes a grin at him from where he’s handling the ladies’ horses. “Isn’t my fault keeping up with the stables requires my full attention, or that your junior gardeners are useless. I do appreciate the assistance, if that helps.”
The smirk Gabriel levels at him is far too knowing for comfort. “Needed a snack before bed? You didn’t eat much at dinner.”
“So you didn’t stay behind to begin taking over management of part of the estate’s workings?” Lord Charles frowns, as if unable to imagine why else Castiel might not enjoy taking up occupancy in a townhome in the middle of the dirtiest, most crowded place he’s ever had the misfortune of visiting.
But Crowley’s watching him with a knowing smirk. “Just that - as someone who’s been there before - I hope
“Well, if you want something blue, either of these should do the trick.” Castiel points out a couple of options at about eye level on the shelf in front of him. One’s more teal than a true blue, while the other is a deep navy color. Neither of them look as soft as the stuff he’s currently holding, but Castiel seems trustworthy enough, so there must be a reason for his choices.
Even with the rough bark digging into his back through the thin fabric of the shirt he wears, it’s the best he’s felt all day. The itch that appears between his shoulders every time he has to interact with Castiel in front of others vanishes entirely. They might be all too accustomed to acting a certain way around each other in public, after years of keeping their relationship in the strictest of confidence, but it doesn’t mean Dean’s grown any happier with its necessity over the years.
Steve’s still got that confused squint, and Dean has a brief bewildered moment where he wonders if he’s read this all wrong, if the guy didn’t get lost coming back from having a smoke and instead might actually be hitting on him, when he suddenly remembers.
Castiel sighs. “They keep asking me my opinions on various arrangements for the ball, and no matter how many times I tell them I have no particular opinion to give, they seem incapable of taking me at my word. What do I care for the musical selection, or the refreshments? They know I have never had any particular enjoyment of balls, or any social event, for that manner.”
“Hey, don’t say it like that. There’s some big fuss with the family business right now that’s nearly wrapped up, and he’s gonna break the news after that. Shouldn’t be too long after the holidays.”
They’re swinging north not long after crossing into Indiana when Cas squeezes Dean’s hand where it sits on the seat between them. “I need to tell you something else about my family.”
The corners of Castiel’s eyes crinkle when he smiles, enough that Dean doesn’t mind that he can see right through his bullshit. “And what is it that makes you go through so much gas in a year, Dean?”
Only to drop in an aborted motion as someone behind them says “Cas!” too close for comfort. They both turn and see Hannah and three others Dean doesn’t recognize.
“Raphael made it down for the party. He won’t stop asking me why I’m still not doing my part working for the company while also hinting that I would do a really bad job at it.”
“My mother thinks no such thing. Neither do I.” Suddenly shy, Castiel’s eyes dart away from Dean’s for a moment before returning, steady and sure. This time, Dean expects the next words out of Castiel’s mouth, though they don’t sound any less surreal than the last time a few hours ago. “Dean. Will you marry me?”
As soon as the clerk opens the box to reveal his mom’s ring, perfectly resized, nestled into the silk lining, Charlie socks him in the arm with a delighted squeal. “I can’t believe you didn’t tell me you were gonna ask him! At least you picked a good one without me!”
Her mouth clicks shut when Dean opens the door to a tastefully understated storefront with only a few pieces of jewelry on display in the window. She slants an assessing look at him. “So, not buttering me up to invest in your paranormal investigations startup, huh?”
It seems his poor mood is more than obvious to those who know him. Mr. Singer takes one look at him as he enters and narrows his eyes in his direction. “What’s got you in such a foul mood?”
Dean watches as Cas cuts through the crowd as unobtrusively as possible in a gathering this size, heading his way.
“I don’t want you to give up anything for my sake,” Dean says quickly, though Castiel shakes his head.
“I’d better-” Dean waves his phone to illustrate his point before realizing that nobody’s paying attention. His escape route leads him out to a wide brick patio lined with white columns on either side, and he casts a quick glance around before answering the phone.
The halls of the downstairs’ servants areas are blissfully quiet when he exits the passage. It keeps the maids that normally crowd the hallway busy elsewhere, and leaves him with no one around to remark on his appearance. He’s sure he’ll be called on later to clean the disaster the guests have surely made of the front paths, but Mr. Singer prefers to walk the grounds and see the damage for himself first, so he has a moment to breathe.
It takes another minute of Cas squinting at him before a small smile breaks out on his face. “You’ve just gotten used to having your gas pumped for you, haven’t you.”
Dean’s throat is tight as he accepts the box from the clerk. He hung onto every piece of his mom’s jewelry that survived the fire, once he’d found them while cleaning out Dad’s storage unit after his death. The same delicately tooled gold surface glints up at him from among the silk like it has since he first sat down and cleaned away years of neglect upon finding it.
Dean spends another few minutes outside after Crowley leaves, gathering his shaken nerves before heading back inside. Looks like he’s just in time - Michael’s rapidly approaching the podium set up at one side of the ballroom, flanked by two of his soon-to-be partners.
The basket on the man’s arm seems to answer the question of whether he just accosted someone trying to do his own shopping for him, but the man waves off the apology. “No, just a frequent customer. Happy to help a beginner out, even if it’s by proxy. I’m Castiel.”
Dean’s glad he took the time once he sees the inside of the restaurant. Not his usual scene by any stretch of the imagination, but he doesn’t feel too out of place as they’re escorted to their table, confident that he at least
“Well, I wasn’t gonna tell you this just yet, but-” Dean drops his voice to a whisper. “I really, really like you too, Cas.”
Waking up beside Dean has long featured in his dearest fantasies, and the truth of it does not disappoint in the least. The midmorning sun shines brightly through the hazy curtain as Castiel blinks back to consciousness, far too soon after falling asleep given just how late they retired. The sight of Dean’s lean, freckled back sprawled carelessly atop the crisp white linen sheets, lashes dark against his cheek, resting as comfortably as Castiel has ever seen him is something his imagination could not have come even close to conjuring.
“Missed me, have you?” Dean asks when they finally part. The cocky grin on his face belies the flicker of nervousness in his eyes, the one that appears every time he points out Castiel’s eagerness to see him. As if he’s presuming something by pointing out the obvious. Castiel can’t wait to see it disappear for good, someday.
“If this is the extent of the entertainments here, Castiel, I wonder why you did not join us in town this season,” Lucien remarks, kicking at the loose pebbles and sending them even farther over the edge of the path for Dean to correct later.
Crowley - and that’s gotta be who Dean thinks it is, there can’t be more than one person walking around town with that name - gives Cas an unimpressed once-over. “Castiel.” He drags out the syllables on Cas’s name, then fails to follow it up with any actual greeting, instead swanning towards a table on the other side of the room.
“There were all sorts of things that might have captured your interest.” Not likely, Castiel thinks, even as Michael drones on. “The theater put on an excellent production of...what was it, Raphael? One of the tragedies?”
The text on the page is awfully small and close together, though, so Dean caves to the sour look on Sam’s face after only a few moments and returns it to its place at the top of the stack. It’s been years since he last attended any schooling session and had the occasion to read more than a line or two at a time; if Mr. Singer does hand over the title as expected, Dean will have to get back into the habit of reading longer texts. A problem for another time.
Benny hums his agreement and knocks their shoulders companionably together as they finish the walk back to the stables. “I suppose we should be grateful that their behavior seems so loathsome to us. Shows that we’re unusually lucky to have such sensible masters out here. As long as the unbearable ones are only here for a short visit we should survive it.”
Michael hums. Somehow it manages to sound disapproving. “His mother didn’t mention he was visiting. He certainly hasn’t been back the last several years.”
To make matters worse, Sam’s promotion means he and Eileen decided to move out of their apartment and into the suburbs - on the Jersey side of the city. The
“Um.” The kid visibly deflates. Surely Dean isn’t the only person the chipper routine doesn’t work on. “He’s on break right now.”
Castiel is fully prepared to endure Michael’s speeches about duty and inheritance. He has no need for them, not when he has Dean. Even if small moments away from prying eyes are all they can have, it’s more than he would want with anyone else.
“Yeah?” Dean’s been bugging Cas about everyone since he agreed to come along. If he’s going to meet four out of Cas’s five siblings, he wants to make the best impression he can, and that means learning stuff about them all beforehand. He’s pretty sure they’ve been over most of the basics, but he’s game for whatever else Cas thinks he needs to know beforehand.
“We’ll be needing one more chair,” Anna tells the hostess when he sees their table. Dean pauses as he draws even with one of the chairs, casting a quick, confused glance over their group.
“He’ll love it,” Charlie says softly. She waits until the ring is safely packaged away again and they’re on their way out of the shop, heading back towards the lot they parked in. “When are you planning on asking him?”
The best thing about his current assignment is that it offers him ample escape from the ball itself. He presses the heels of his hands to his eyes, desperately in need of some quiet. There’s none to be found, and his closed eyelids provide no relief from the glimpses he’s caught of the activities inside through the windows.
“Michael’s business partners wanted the best to iron out all the details on their new merger. That means me.” Crowley shrugs and downs the rest of his whiskey. “I’m sure it was a nasty surprise for Michael to find out they’d flown me in for it, but I wasn’t exactly looking forward to heading home for the holidays, either. Even if it’s only on business.”
“Could be. In the meantime, I suggest you learn to ignore them. If they decide to burn the gardens down,
Most of the tension drops from his shoulders when he hears the voice on the other end of the line. He doesn’t want to dump his crap on Sam when he’s having a perfectly nice time with Eileen’s family, and there’s only one other person who knows the details of the situation. “Why are you calling so soon? Is everything okay?”
He sighs and pulls Castiel closer as they settle in for sleep, utterly sated and content, intent on enjoying every last minute with the man he loves while he still can.
Dean swallows. “Been looking pretty much everywhere between here and the shore. Seems like there’s a couple areas around here with room on the market for someone with my background, and I know Jo’s been angling to step into a leadership role back at work. Bobby and Ellen might not like me moving away, but they’ll manage just fine without me.”
“I’d like to request that I’m left out of this,” Lucien says dryly. “My plan is to continue avoiding any such responsibilities for as long as I can.”
“Yes, because there absolutely must be enough trout in the lake available at all times for me to kill in the interest of my leisure.”
“Well, you live with your hot boyfriend in Kansas, so that kind of puts a damper on working in Detroit,” Dean says, tipping his glass in Cas’s direction in a silent offer. Cas shakes his head at the question, but his hand moves toward Dean’s -
Cas slips inside and shuts the door quietly behind him. Before he can properly register the movement, Dean finds himself pressed firmly against a wall and being kissed within an inch of his life.
Normally he wouldn’t hit the sack so early, but he doesn’t exactly bounce right back from long drives as easily as he used to. Dean ferries his bag of toiletries over to the guest bathroom, washes up for bed, and then figures he’ll thank himself later if he unpacks his bag tonight instead of waiting until tomorrow when there’s actually stuff to do.
Dean stands at the ready as he draws close, leaning up against the solid width of the large willow that grows along the edge of the brook to catch more shade. He doesn’t bother to hide himself in case of someone else appearing; Castiel is the only other person who even knows this spot exists, far at the edge of the wilderness at the estate’s boundaries.
The trimmed stem in his hand can barely support the weight of the blooming rose perched at its end. It wobbles dangerously as Castiel pulls it out from behind his back, and Dean leans forward to support it and take a deep sniff. He rolls it between his fingers as he lazily watches Castiel strip his soiled outer layers off, down to his underclothes, and rinse his hands in the washbasin before slipping in behind him. As enamored as Dean always seems of the feathers stuffing their bed and pillows, he always says he prefers Castiel as a pillow to anything else.
The dorky smile Cas gives him is nearly too much for Dean to handle, let alone eventually let go of him and allow him to slip next door. He carries it to bed with him, to the mattress that’s slightly too soft and the blankets that are just a shade scratchier than his own, even without the glaring absence that’s the biggest difference of all.
As expected, Raphael’s expression turns pinched, and he turns away abruptly, opening the book in his lap to resume his reading.
Dean swings back into the gardeners’ shed after another hour spent in the sun attempting to salvage as many of the poor violets as he could. More than he expected might wind up surviving Lucien’s carelessness, after all, but he can’t even comfort himself with that silver lining. It’s one thing to know that his time with Castiel can only ever consist of stolen moments away from prying eyes, and quite another to face the reality that this may have been their last summer together. In all likelihood, by this time next year, the social season may bring an advantageous betrothal for Castiel.
He thought he would only be required to help with the preparations — he wouldn’t trust anyone other than himself or Mr. Singer to select the floral arrangements littering the room, after all — but he volunteered gamely enough to manage the influx of carriages that would arrive with more guests than the estate typically saw in six months or more when it became apparent that even additional staff couldn’t handle the additional work. As it turned out, Mr. Singer had a similar idea of preferring to deal with the horses and coachmen rather than the guests, so at least his misery has company.
Lady Amara may have kept the estate so financially healthy through careful management and relatively few indulgences, but on the rare occasions that she does decide to host an event, she spares no expense.
“I see we’ve had to enlist some help this morning, hm?” Benny ducks his head, beginning to stutter out an apology, before she cuts him off with a laugh. “Not at all. It was rather late notice, wasn’t it? But I saw Castiel dressed for his morning ride and thought it would be such a nice morning to get away from everything together before my brother’s family arrives. Are we all ready?”
“Nothing to worry about.” Most of it involves pointed comments about their own marriages and feigned surprise over the fact that Castiel remains a bachelor at his age. None of his cousins have gone so far as to outright recommend that Castiel follow their example as of yet, but he knows it’s only a matter of time before the tone shifts. He fully expects that Michael, with his rigid sense of duty, will be the first to broach the subject, even though Gabriel is the most recently married and therefore the most wrapped up in marital bliss.
Dean huffs out a laugh as he stands from the trunk, twirling his keys around his finger. “I’ll keep that in mind.”
“You made it!” Dean only gets a brief glimpse of a short blond man before he’s reeling Cas into an exuberant hug.
It’s almost easy to forget that isn’t the case, this far away from the rest of the estate, just the two of them among the greenery with nothing other than easy affection between them. That despite the fact that they both find respite in each other’s company, their association would seriously jeopardize Castiel’s reputation were it ever known. Castiel could do far better than him, find someone of equal social standing — will have to, before too much time passes, if he intends to ever marry.
Impulsively, he opens his sense of time and barely shuts it back down before the migraine starts, but not before dropping to the floor with a strangled gasp.
Concentrating, he tries to figure out how much of today he actually remembers, but it's a crapshoot at best.  Vera checks his memory and reflexes every morning and evening, innocuous questions interspersed with explanations of what she's doing and why, but Dean's never been too tired not to feel a start of fear when he hears them, when he has to grope for answers and hope that they're right.  That's her job, and he gets that, but he's glad Cas doesn't think it's supposed to be his, too.
Micah sits back, cocking his head in genuine surprise. "You think I would have signed that contract without a gun to my head?" he asks.  "I didn't want to be part of Erica's crusade, and I sure as hell wasn't interested in helping kill two people I barely knew, but it was them or me.  Erica and the others were going after them whether I said yes or no; 'yes' meant I got to live."
Cas's balance is off, but Dean was ready for that, steadying him with an arm around his waist and fighting back a (again, not the time but who cares) grin.  "Where are we going?"
"You could use a little spoiling," Dean decides, eyes falling closed despite himself. "We're gonna work on that."
"Sarah, it is not your responsibility to be Kat's full-time guardian," Castiel says.  "You're her team leader, not her mother or her keeper."
"I bet you can."  Alicia stops short in the middle of the road and unexpectedly laughs. "You never took me to the Crossroads," she explains.  "Gotta admit, I was a little curious what it was like.  Less lights, more guns to the head, am I right?"
"Cas, you're about to snap that pencil," Dean points out, and Castiel looks down to see the pencil beginning to crack.  "You're pissed, so let's talk about it."  He pauses, looking pained.  "Jesus, I’m quoting Sam now."
death.  She continues with me now at a truly ridiculous salary, but what can one do?  One must pay fair wage for a Roman citizen of her education and skill, and I certainly could not hope to find better."
"I already did," he answers, removing all the snow in a thirty mile radius as well; the coming days will replace it, of course, but for at least a little while it will be a much easier walk.  Excellent idea: unnumbered people will more easily arrive at Ichabod and among them others who may be under some compulsion and on seeing him might desire his death.
"If we could only be so lucky," Cas murmurs, smiling slowly, and Dean feels himself smile back. "Power is less than useless without understanding its limitations.  I doubt the Cage has improved his ability to general, and Hell isn't nothing like it was when he was locked away.  Two, three dozen millennia from now, he might even remember earth between the bouts of fighting."
Stepping past her, Alicia looks down at Micah's body, and following her gaze, Castiel remembers that blur after Alicia was shot.  One of her throwing knives is buried in his throat to the hilt, breaching the trachea and embedding itself in the spine; slowly, alone and unnoticed, he choked to death on his own blood.
"That can be easily corrected; she must know you and all that requires is your presence," he answers, resting his arms on Dean's shoulders and peering down at him.  "Assisting in her education will speed the process considerably."
, everyone starts wrapping everything up and heading back out to the front of the restaurant. Hannah gracefully turns down an invitation from Michael for drinks back at the house and splits off, heading out in front of all the rest of them.
Dean grabs both off the shelf for good measure. “Thanks, man. Sounds like you’ve been doing this a while.”
“I can tell that by the fact that you’ve been reading it every spare minute you’ve had all week.” Castiel presses a kiss to the soft space under Dean’s ear and hooks his chin over Dean’s shoulder to peer at the novel. “I’m glad you’re enjoying it. Tell me what it’s about?”
After a coolly polite breakfast - more brunch than anything, given the time of morning - where Dean utterly fails at engaging Michael in a friendly conversation, everyone gets packed into two cars. Dean tries to get a word in edgewise for allowing him to drive one of the groups, but Cas’s siblings take one look at the Impala and immediately nix that based on a lack of modern safety features. Instead, Dean finds himself bundled into the backseat of a minivan despite his protests.
“Anyone with eyes can see the young lord appreciates just about anything that comes from that garden of yours.”
Dean’s barely unzipped his duffel when he looks towards the door, wondering if he imagined hearing someone in the hall. He turns back to his pile of clothes - mostly suits and sweaters, some of which he shamelessly stole out of Sam’s dresser when he found out he was going to be meeting the in-laws and needed something nicer than his usual plaid - but then he hears it again. Definitely a knock.
To his dismay, Anna’s expression doesn’t change. Hastily, Dean continues, “I’m pretty broken up about getting dumped. Gonna take a while to get over it.”
“Well, it worked,” Cas says. He finally draws back far enough for Dean to get a good look at him, fingers a firm pressure against the back of Dean’s neck, and Dean can’t even be upset that their first kiss is going to be next to a gas pump because Cas is leaning in, lips chapped from the chill air but soft against his own, his scent crowded out by the heavy smell of gasoline lingering on the concrete around them.
Loud hoots and raucous laughter from a passing group of drunken college students jerk them rudely from their warm bubble, and Dean’s elbow bangs into the steering wheel and deafens them briefly with the horn. Both of them freeze for a half-second before collapsing into laughter, and somehow Dean winds up leaning into Cas again. The only thing better than the light displays shining through the windows onto Cas’s face while he’s smiling might be while he’s breathless with laughter, shaking with the force of it.
cannot deny this season was the happiest I have been to date, and when I told her of your role in my happiness, she gave her blessing. I cannot offer you quite as comfortable a life as I might have as her heir, but she has consented to provide a generous enough living that I will remain a gentleman of means, if giving up my title would be enough to assure you of the sincerity of my intentions when I ask for your hand.”
“Well, Michael’s hoping that making a good impression will help him be able to move the merger along faster. I’m hoping so, too.”
As it always does, a great sense of belonging comes over Castiel when he crosses the threshold into the entryway. He never felt quite comfortable in the main house of the estate, too hemmed in by the expectations of his role. The smaller cottage suits him far better, though most of it is due to its other occupant. A paradise of their own making, just like the meadow was for so many years.
It’s so far from anything Castiel could have imagined him saying that his mind briefly stutters over an adequate response. “Pardon?”
“Well, nothing against her. Or Michael or Anna, even if their accidental run-in charade was painfully obvious. But I can deal with one dinner.”
In the meantime, they will both have to suffer through the ball. He can imagine how the experience would be improved with Dean by his side: instead of lurking in the corner, studiously avoiding every attempt to entice him to dance and attracting attention for maintaining a distance from those who viewed him only as an appealing would-be suitor, he could share his honest opinion of the ball and those attending. He’s certain he would enjoy hearing Dean’s insights into the peculiar behavior of the other guests. He might even be persuaded to join in some of the dancing, if he had someone as tempting as Dean on his arm.
“How is it that you find yourself in need of my assistance at least once a fortnight, but you’re nowhere to be found when I need an extra set of hands?” Dean asks as he secures the second girth into place.
His primary responsibilities used to encompass the vast outer portions of the property, until Mr. Singer got it into his head that Dean should take on the role of head groundskeeper upon his upcoming retirement. While Mr. Singer retains the planning of the herb and vegetable gardens — something Dean has long suspected has to do more with having an excuse to speak with the head cook, Mrs. Harvelle, than anything else — taking over the care of some of the ornamental gardens fell to Dean. Where Mr. Singer got the idea that Dean has anywhere near the head for details involved in taking over the position of head groundskeeper, he has no idea, but he strives to live up to the task.
Dean shrugs. “I was originally thinking New Year’s Eve - start the year off right, you know? But Christmas is such a big deal in his family, so if meeting them all goes okay, I might ask him on Christmas. We’ll see.”
Well. Dean isn’t one to pass up a good opportunity, especially when he doesn’t know how many of them he’ll get until they’re back at home. He drops his hands to Cas’s hips and pulls Cas flush to him, already feeling some of the stress associated with their little charade ebb away. If Cas could only do that after every conversation with his family, he thinks the whole family holiday thing might actually be fun.
Cas’s hand hesitates over the nozzle, but the time it takes him to pluck it out of its cradle and turn back to Dean isn’t enough to erase the dismayed furrow between his brows. “Where are you headed?”
With one more muttered “excuse me,” Cas is back at Dean’s side, standing just slightly closer than appropriate.
Dean’s eyes drag across his hands, turned upwards in supplication on the bedspread, before finally landing on his. Even with the unfamiliar sheen in Dean’s eyes he cannot tear himself away. For all that he knows Dean’s life has not been an easy one in many regards, he’s so unaccustomed to seeing tears in Dean’s eyes that he’s struck speechless.
Meanwhile, Dean alternates between watching with amusement as Cas gets good-naturedly bossed around by Gabriel and entertaining Jack when he becomes bored by the cookie-cutting process and decides to skip the oven in favor of shoveling cookie dough directly into his mouth. Not that Dean can blame him - he steals a couple spoonfuls’ worth on his way back to timeout in the breakfast nook with Jack, and they make a game out of sneaking bites when everyone’s backs are turned before they’re caught and their nearly-empty spoons are confiscated.
Despite Alfred’s attempt to shift the topic towards something more generally pleasing, apparently Castiel’s luck isn’t meant to hold. “Tell me, Castiel, what responsibilities regarding the estate have you taken on since we last spoke?” Lord Charles asks.
“He’s already said she’s too young for him to consider her a match in any serious manner. Never mind that it’s always one excuse or the other: too young, too old, rumors of an upcoming engagement that he couldn’t possibly interfere with. I know our cousin does not care for social engagements, but if he has any intention of ever securing an advantageous partner for marriage, he should take care how he behaves at the rare events he
“I do, but I think everyone would be happier if I showered and changed first. If you give me a ride back to my place I can be ready faster than I would be waiting for the bus.”
“Sure, thanks.” She shuts the door behind her, and Dean lets out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding.
Castiel snaps his gaze to those restless wings within their protective cages, shoulderblades itching, burning as Dean's hand skims down his back in reminder of what he lost and never thought to have again; that's why they're undamaged.
"Barely exercise.  More like rolling over.  Except not in bed, and with my feet.  Walking, Cas.  I want to take a walk.  A nice, slow, fresh air walk.  Nothing wrong with that.  I do one of those every day.  Sometimes two.  I missed it today, and it's a nice night so why not?"
The long silence is abruptly broken as Gaius steps forward, hand resting on his shoulder, fingers startlingly warm and strong.  His voice is gentle as he says, "It doesn't matter, Castiel.  We do not expect this of you."
"Mater took me to her tomb when I was eight years old," a voice says, and Dean turns to see a woman standing beside him.  Despite the light brown hair and smaller build, the dark olive complexion and dark, black-lashed eyes are Cornelia's.  Almost as if in deliberate contrast, however, her hair is elaborately arranged, diamond drops hanging from her ears and decorate the heavy gold necklace, bracelets, and rings that sparkle on her fingers.  Even the floor-length gown is a more elaborate version of Cornelia's, the long sleeves split from shoulder to wrist and held together with a series of tiny diamond clasps, but the color is like a photo negative in blinding white.  "Cornelians aren't burned; alone among Rome's families, their bodies are left intact after death."
"Or they came here following that rumor," Dean says, slowing to search the darkness outside for the turn-off.  "Church would be enough to tell them it was true, but not enough to actually do it.  Question is, how the hell did they get the symbol if the kids' memories were wiped?  Everyone else was dead."
To his surprise, the lobby's clear of everyone but Jeremy and Joelle, both standing near Joe by the door and looking hopeful.  Pausing on the first floor balcony, he calls down, "Cas back yet?"
He wraps his arms around Cas's waist just in case he tries to do something stupid like move.  "Dude, that's crazy talk.  What if we...run out of chairs?  Sitting on the floor, that shit's unprofessional as hell."
"I'm going to assist Teresa in adding several sigils to the wards tonight," Castiel answers.  "That should at very minimum delay them and buy some time."
"Yeah, two," she says with relish.  "Of four gates. Six doors--doorways, I guess?  Wait--" She consults the paper, and craning his neck, Dean realizes it's not just a drawing, it has
"Nothing," he answers shortly. "He's been a dick pretty much since I got here.  End subject."  Chuck nods quickly, looking straight ahead with a bad attempt at casual, and Dean sighs. "What the hell happened to him anyway?"
His thoughts circle restlessly; even after all this time, he's not satisfied with the answer, possibly because he never asked himself the question. "Amanda--all of them--I wanted to teach them.  It was the first time I understood the reason I was willing to learn to do this, and it was the last time I'd ever do it.  I'm not sure that class noticed any benefit from it, but I enjoyed it very much, and Amanda's supplementary and surreptitious instruction helped far more than I expected.  That wasn't in the model," he adds thoughtfully.  "We never had time for experimentation once we had it working, and we found out very quickly that choosing someone with the ability to instruct was as important as the model."
"A shitty idea," Dean finishes for him, remembering Pamela with a wince.  "But you don't have Grace now."
"In case she wishes to remain for a few hours or--" He thinks of Dean's misery in their cabin after the fever: illness and boredom were issues, yes, but so was loneliness, even if Dean didn't want to admit it.  "She could spend the day at Headquarters and visit with those she doesn't hate.  Which are few, yes, but they exist, or so I assume. If the room could be made comfortable for her, with anything she might need....is there any reason she has to stay
"So are you," he answers, ignoring Dean's unconvincing show of innocence.  "Who do you think taught me to play?"  That was a mistake; the green eyes narrow dangerously, and he files away another example of the times that Dean
"Alison is very powerful in potential and unpracticed in what power she has in fact," he explains; it's far easier to discuss what Alison can do than explain what she can't and why.  "Alison hasn't--as far as Teresa and Wendy can ascertain--been affected by the geas despite the fact she is probably the most exposed person in Ichabod."
"Also, a cake, which she looked for after she woke up and was unhappy when she couldn't find it.  Yours were..." Well, none involved fucking the Master of the Pit in front of one of his Brothers, which he assumes Dean is grateful for and he is as well.  "Not like that." He looks at Dean in bewilderment.  "A
"Can't risk demons getting above themselves, yeah."  Dean studies him thoughtfully.  "That's not the part that's bothering you, though."
"I suppose."  He gingerly picks it up, taking the time to smooth it out against his knees and study the clasps for wear, aware of Alicia's glare and failing to understand what inspired it.  "Or I could do it myself, if you could--"
"No, I was seven when he died."  Sappho looks at Publius helplessly while Dean tries to imagine being seven and given a list of potential husbands to check out.  And know what that
"Cas." Ignoring him, Castiel starts to take another drink before the bottle is abruptly jerked out of his hand.  "
"You have the advantage of me," he says, watching Dean set up the board.  "I've watched humans play this game for millennia in its various forms, but this will be the first time I've actually played it with anyone.  I've always been curious as to why humanity seems to enjoy it so much."
"As they don't know she's clairvoyant, no; I assume it was more deliberate ignorance," Cas answers, adding at Dean's surprise, "Dean, Gloria was born nearly twenty years before the Civil Rights movement in the Deep South and attended the University of Georgia one year after it desegregated.  She was one of the first Black women to receive a PhD in Georgia as well as achieve tenure as a professor."
