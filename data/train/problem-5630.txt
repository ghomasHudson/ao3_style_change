Tony whimpered with regret. Laura called Clint’s name and left the table under the guise of going to help him with the difficult task of carrying a homemade pumpkin pie.
“How could I disagree with that?” Steve muttered, then swept his thumb over the back of Tony’s hand gently. “Go on, then. Where’s that farmer’s market?”
What Tony wouldn’t give to have lived in Metropolis when Superman lived among them on a daily basis. If he’d only been born one generation earlier! He might have even met Lois Lane, had the chance to shake hands with her, the reporter who’d first planted the seeds of investigative journalism in his dreams, and how any journalist worth her salt wouldn’t take shit from anyone. Lois Lane inspired more of his life choices than Howard ever had, because not only did she tear down the bullshit year after year, but she landed the sexiest, most heroic man to walk this planet. Except, of course, Superman was an alien. Most of Tony’s teenage years were spent debating whether Superman
“Steve? Are you okay?”
“He is my friend! I’d do the same for you,” Steve snarled. “You’re either with me or against me, what’s it going to be?”
“Hi everyone! My name is Steve Rogers,” Steve announced in a loud but cheerful tone of voice. “You might know me as Captain America. I want to clear something up real quick: I’m a proud Hufflepuff,” he said more loudly to be heard over Tony’s distracting giggling and attempts to shut him up. “And Trelawny is my favorite character. She’s underrated and brilliant. And your city is great, thank you for—”
It was close enough to the truth that he suddenly couldn’t breathe without crying, the relief of saying the words he’d dreaded for so long overwhelming him to the point of tears. “I miss you so much,” he kept rambling even as Steve pulled him against his chest and held him close, gently cupping the back of his head so Tony felt held and supported in every way. “I’ve never been so happy, Steve, I’m so fucking scared. I don’t know—I don’t like this, I don’t like—”
was on the run in Prospect Park.
“Two seconds ago I was going out of my way to make sure you got the best trainer I’ve known,” Steve observed ruefully.
“I didn’t order this,” Steve said with a tired sigh. “I said
,” Maria told him in a flinty, clipped tone that had both Tony and Clint shuddering in their chairs.
Try as he might, Steve couldn’t resist rolling his eyes. He let Tony push his shirt off his shoulders, then grabbed Tony by the belt to pull him into his lap.
“That sounds like a great party,” Jimmy said with an impressed nod, “will the other Avengers be there?”
Distantly, he heard Marple bark in distress. He called her name, but it was no more than a croak after having the wind punched out of him by gravity. Wherever he looked, his dog was nowhere to be found. Swallowing and clearing his throat in a rush, he finally managed a decent shout.
Clint rolled his eyes. “Of course you’d remember that—Tony, everyone’s weird in middle school!”
The first touch of his tongue had Tony squirming and squeaking, but before he managed to shove Steve away from his newly-discovered treasure, Steve kissed his way up the column of Tony’s neck. With his wicked teeth and hungry lips, he soon turned Tony squirming, giggling protests into a slow, instinctive rocking of his hips, and soft, drawn-out moans of encouragement.
Tony’s quiet suggestions almost went unheard, and still Steve could feel them.
Tony must have come six or seven times before he was finally given a break and allowed to rest. True to his word, Steve sat on the platform beside him and drew his pet closer so Tony could rest his head in Steve’s lap. Steve had already fed him as much of his come as he could that day, but the way Tony softly whispered and begged, Steve caved easily. He pulled the blankets high over Tony’s body to keep him warm, and assured of his comfort, he freed his own cock and guided it to Tony’s lips. It was soft and dry of come, but the rich scent of his musk and the weight of his cock on Tony’s tongue soothed Tony’s nerves like a gentle salve.
Color rose in Tony’s cheeks at the praise, and he preened under Steve’s watchful eyes. “Yesterday,” he whispered, watching Steve pick up a new sleeve to roll over his cock. “Did that… that thing want me?”
“You know, I’m staying in a hotel suite,” Tony whispered while he watched Steve pick his way through the debris moving boxes here and there to open up the floor. “It overlooks Central Park. King bed. Turn down service, breakfast—”
Tony was on hold and humming along to the pleasant melodies on the phone later that morning when Bruce rushed into their office.
“I’d rather stay out of your precious New Yorselyvania, Stark. You can handle Rumlow yourselves, can’t you?”
It was only then that Steve realized Tony’s townhouse was unusually silent. He’d assumed Tony was in the bathroom, or downstairs in the kitchen, but there was no sound coming from anywhere in the brownstone. He hadn’t even noticed Tony get out of bed.
“I lived in the East,” he explained while he gnawed on a raw turnip. Tony couldn’t stop staring at his teeth. “I thought I was safe in the mountains, but one night it was cold, and I had to build a fire. Women found me by morning. Their chief is old, and she has not yet had a daughter. I was in her bed for a week before I escaped.”
Tony’s food was untouched on the kitchen table, and Tony was at the stove, filling Steve’s plate with scrambled eggs to bring to the table so they could eat together. He waited for Steve to take a seat before putting the plate down for him.
“Not as memorable, but they’re interested in second dates. We count them as wins,” she summarized. It sounded simple, but Natasha fell quiet then, mulling something over with care. Tony didn’t push, giving her the time and space to find her words.
“Then you can do whatever you want with the tickets,” Steve said without so much as asking about their cost. “Make it happen, Carter. In the meantime, I’ll be… asking Tony Stark out on a date.”
The CompuKiosk was a computer terminal in an open booth that was operated by a series of buttons organized in four rows. There were the expected access points, like an Atlas, Banking, Mail, and Telephone Directory. But the second row of buttons read, Ego Boost, Citizen Confessional, Public Psychiatrist, and Serenity Sayings. Rumlow couldn’t resist.
There was a brief silence, but even though the contempt was clear in Steve’s eyes, he inclined his head just enough for Tony to understand. Relief washed over him, and Tony quietly instructed Steve to step back and stand with him against the wall as the meeting resumed.
“I’m so sorry, I was working and lost track of time,” Tony said with big, sad eyes, batting his eyelashes in a way that somehow made Steve even angrier. “Please, forgive me, Sparky?”
“But,” Clint protested, and helplessly he tried to gesture at the peacefully napping dragon. “Are you kidding me? You have a dragon! Nobody would dare harm us; she is terrifying.”
That was usually when she would march back out of the office, but this time, she stood where she was, watching him expectantly. Tony could probably have continued sitting in his chair for some time just to piss her off, but he was pretty sure that if there was anyone more stubborn on the planet than he, it was
“Tony, this is Steve’s turn to share,” Dr. Odinson said in a stern tone of voice. “Please, show him the same courtesy he showed you. Steve, what were successful methods of communicating what you needed when you were growing up?”
Sarah laughed at the memory. “He really did, with the pears. But that took time; this always takes time.”
“Come on, champ,” he said with a big grin, “how about you sit down before you pass out?”
It took him too long to realize that the vice grip Steve had on him was not to randomly humiliate him in the crowd, but to present him to Tony’s first customer, with his legs held wide apart so his hard, dripping cock curved up defiantly under his robe, inches from the creature’s face.
Just not right for it
Stark glared up at him and opened his mouth to bite back when Steve put a hand out to shut Bucky up before it all got worse. “—your latest novel,” Steve corrected diplomatically. “But as my partner said, seeing as you don’t employ a ghostwriter, we must ask you to come with us to the station.”
All he got at first was a grunt of displeasure, but with enough persistence and shaking, Tony slowly turned to give him a withering look.
And just like that, something more pressing than sleeping stirred in Steve’s body. Before Tony noticed, he pulled away and promised to be back soon. He straddled the rim of the cold, porcelain tub and counted backwards from fifty while he brushed his teeth, but neither attempt did much to cool him off.
was a mess. Diving had ended weeks before graduation, and between finals and being miserably lonely, Steve hadn’t groomed from the neck down for almost two months. Even if Tony understood that he was less than perfectly hairless now, he probably wouldn’t expect the amount of body hair hiding under Steve’s clothes now. After all, his chest hair didn’t end at his pecs, it dusted over his torso and abdomen, and
“It never became relevant,” Steve eventually said with a shrug. It was the most direct and honest answer Tony had ever gotten, and he was at a loss for what to say. When he turned back around, Steve looked caught between a rock and a hard place.
“Even if that was true,” Clint said quietly, because yeah, no. He’d believe that miracle when he saw it. “I’ve seen the way Tony looks at you, Stephanie. He stood by my side when he didn’t need to, and I will stand by him. My answer is no.”
What, what was this—were they pranking him? Was he being punked? Goddamnit, this better not be Punk’d, he was too naked to be on camera.
” Steve growled through gritted teeth where he sucked a bruise into the tender skin of Tony’s throat, punctuating the claim over and over again with brutal snaps of his hips. Steve was losing his control, losing himself to his desire, and he bore into Tony with a hunger that quickly pushed Tony over the edge, breathless and out of his mind with the pleasure of his second orgasm.
Steve stopped dead in his tracks. He’d recognize that body anywhere. Could the world really be so small?
“Don’t you dare, Tony,” Steve said immediately. His husband frowned then pouted in reply. “I’m scheduled to work seventy days this year, you work over three hundred days. I can stand to work more. Please don’t argue,” Steve finished more quietly, “It is important to me that I do this well.”
“To be honest, I don’t know what love is,” he confided in Tony. The silence on Tony’s end was deafening, and he wasn’t even sure Tony hadn’t hung up on him in his embarrassment, except that was so unlike Tony that Steve braved the rest of his confession. “I thought I did, but nothing I knew holds a candle to how I feel for you. I care about you, Tony, a lot,” he finished more quietly, suddenly aware of the fact that he was standing in the middle of rush hour foot traffic. Steve shuffled to the side and cleared his throat before to speak before he lost his nerve. “I miss you all the time. I think about you all the time. And if that’s how you feel, I, I want to earn your love.”
“Steve?” Tony called into the apartment in a quiet voice. “You awake?”
Tony took one look at him and grew pale. He urged Steve into his apartment and told him to have a seat, and soon Steve was bundled in a large, plush blanket big enough to drown in.
Alright. Fine. How did it go, Steven?
“Nope, no: it’s too late to ask forgiveness, you have officially mortified me beyond repair.”
“You went back and got another one the next day,” Tony filled in with a knowing but curious smile. “I don’t remember the last time you felt nervous about telling me something.”
Translation for Steve's Spanish line: “Just a guess.”
Steve took Tony’s hand gently in his, but before leading the way to his place, he made sure to pay the driver and include the fare for driving Tony home. Tony had been around Steve long enough not to be surprised, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t touched. Not to mention he had no idea where Steve had been hiding his wallet in that skin-tight Superman suit. He wasn’t sure he wanted to know.
,” a woman purred directly into the microphone, or directly into Bond’s ear. “What magic can your hands perform for me now that we are alone?”
“You sent me videos of him, remember? I have some of them—I took some of them,” Steve reminded him. “We’ll figure out the charts. What else?”
What was Steve and what was Steve’s belt buckle was increasingly obvious, and Tony reached down between them to cup and squeeze Steve’s erection through his dress pants.
“I’m good, my meetings are in the afternoon today,” Tony assured him with a smile, and he moved to the armchair he’d somehow squeezed into his tiny office. “It’s good to hear your voice, sugar, how’s your morning been?”
Tony rushed back to his place where he washed up and strapped into his uniform in record time. On the way out, he instructed Steve on how to navigate the building - operating the elevator by spoken commands, exiting the building with a retinal scan, and finding the space where private conveyances were returned.
“Tony… I owe you big time,” Steve murmured as he finished up his scan and ejected the thumb drive. “I meant what I said. Give your business card.”
Still, Tony looked forward to every one of them. After all, if he was going to hear the details about how their time on this beautiful, blue planet was limited, there was no better place to hear it than in Steve’s strong arms. Tony had spent the better part of three years held by those arms, protected, safe, and loved. And not that he’d ever admit it to Steve, who genuinely looked forward to their documentary watching nights, but Tony had yet to make it more than twenty minutes through one before getting distracted by his Steve. First Tony would get lost in how his long, graceful fingers held Tony’s hands, or held his glass of wine or even held the remote. Then, little by little, Tony’s gaze would drift up over his hands to his firm forearms that rested so gently around him even though Tony knew they could so easily flex to boast powerful, corded muscles others only dream of. From there it would be so easy to drift and stare at his biceps, the breadth of his shoulders, and even now, in the middle of some truly stunning scenes from Blue Planet II narrated by the inspiring, uplifting voice of Sir David Attenborough, Tony was just staring at Steve’s profile in vibrant blue light streaming off the screen. His proud nose, his soft lips, his heart-stopping, glorious jaw. His long, blond lashes that barely flickered shut as he lost himself to the wonder on the screen.
“You want me to fuck you, Tony? Fill you with my come and send you back to the party, filthy with it? Come spilling down your thighs? If only I could sit you on my cock all night, sweetheart,” he moaned directly into Tony’s ear, “fuck you full of my come in front of them all… keep it all plugged up inside you, make you mine…”
Try not to think about how now more than ever there was a very real possibility that his closest friendship in this crazy new world could be irrevocably damaged if he said (or did) the wrong thing.
“You give any thought to a cake?” she wondered, entirely oblivious to Steve’s panic. “Red velvet is one of Tony’s favorites, and I need a good reason to make another Lane cake. Do you have a preference, honey?”
The question stumped Steve at first. “Because of the hydrangeas?” Tony hummed in the affirmative. “It’s a long story, but no, not a funeral. I wanted to plant them. With you.”
“Boy, that’s brisk—did you press the button? No? God, what good are you, girl?” he chided her playfully as they jaywalked like all self-respecting New Yorkers. His rotten little cotton-ball of perfection happily pranced ahead of him, so proud to lead the way with her toy lifted high. She was so pleased with herself, greeting the morning regulars like old friends she’d known since her days as a waddling pup bouncing along the trail chasing Tony’s shoe-laces.
it was.
Then let me take it to dinner. I’ve wanted to go to a place
Later, when they eventually get Steve to the hospital he desperately needs to go to, Tony would pace outside his operating room while Steve was down for the surgery and Tony can only remember how it was his fault in the end, because he's the manager, not Steve, he's supposed to be Steve's objective oversight and he failed Steve.
“Does he lean toward private or public schooling? Would he consider starting a college fund—”
“It is intended as rehabilitation, Steve Rogers, not a punishment,” Tony tried to explain, but Pierce spoke up before he could continue.
“He doesn’t have many friends, you know,” Rhodes said before Steve had a chance to acknowledge Bucky’s point. “I just wanted to talk to you before you forget the good stuff you had, and ask that, you know. Wait, don’t wait, that’s none of my business. But when Tony calls, be a friend to him and pick up? He doesn’t have enough friends to lose you, too.”
“T’Challa was clearly alive in that movie, right, Steve?”
I auditioned for big bad, haven’t heard back yet
Clint must have seen how badly he was fooling himself. “Tony built the pantry,” he added, leaning in as if sharing a secret. “I bet he’d—shit,” he said all of a sudden, grabbing Steve’s forearm to get a better look at his watch. “Is that the time?”
But now, none of it was clear anymore. Steve’s hopes and dreams weren’t the tidy list of opportunities it had always been, and as he stared at the incriminating ring boxes, they warred in his mind with his shame and his self-contempt.
“If that’s a problem,” Steve whispered, his words warm and buoyant with his happiness. “I’ll put the next ones where he’ll never notice them.”
That following Tuesday, Tony was the first to arrive at the Bronx Zoo. Between Steve, his student teachers, Tony, and parent volunteers, the kids were separated into six groups for the excursion.
A moment of silence passed between them. Clint’s easy smile faded until it was nearly a frown. Instead of answering Steve, he grabbed a large serving platter to start piling on the groceries for the grill. Steve watched Clint balance the tray, and if it wasn’t for his earlier question, he would’ve been astounded by how Clint was managing to stuff everything on a single platter without dropping anything.
“Are you talking to that boy Tony again, Steve?” she wondered with impish curiosity.
Note: NSFW image included near end of chapter.
“It does.”
Steve was sure his heart had stopped beating and dropped to somewhere in the vicinity of the asthenosphere, and unable to think of anything to say, he helplessly watched Tony and Bucky lock into the staring contest of the century.
a serious person who could become a lawyer just like any old Vanderbilt or Kensington, then everything would fall into place.
Came here to say tihs the friend that was setting them up said she theyy had a date and everything for when he got back from promo tour
“Does it really bother you, Tony?”
THERE ISN’T
One foot in front of the other, one step at a time. All first-years had the same classes, and Steve was bound to find Brock then. Soon the worst part of this new life would be over, and these few unhappy interactions would be a sore memory long forgotten.
Like Steve, she didn’t seem to have a herd of friends, but maybe that was how she liked it. That’s what Steve told himself anyway as he shouldered past the hurt and moved on.
“A great deal is an understatement,” Steve huffed, more rueful than amused. “We have only one university in Terrini; we will be lucky if all children in the coming generation receive a secondary education.”
Steve made it through the rest of the day listening to information sessions about campus programs, amenities, and clubs, until they were finally released to return to their dorms. He had two days before classes commenced, and as the door to his suite closed behind him, Steve reminded himself that two days was plenty of time for Brock to arrive and for Steve to find him.
But what else could it be??
“If it’s on my hand,” Tony said slowly, “what about you?”
The redhead didn’t last ten seconds.
“Shit, it’s going to be one of those 80s classics or something, isn’t it?” Tony said half to himself, and half to Steve. “Is it…
But long before his anthropology classes at NYU helped Steve understand the complicated history of social inequality, class, and ‘race’, his mom had sat him down and explained it in words he could understand as a child. Those who judge and react with hate are not inherently evil, they are simply afraid. Whether they understand it or not, their anger belies their fears and insecurities. The typical person was never after conflict or pain, even if that was how they responded to the world.
“Thanks, Rachel. Cold water and hot, black coffee, please,” Steve replied with a pleasant smile, as if the woman hadn’t just offered to spend the weekend naked on a beach licking butter off his body at her own place of work. Did a country founded by convicts even
Eisenturm was the largest city in the kingdom, with nearly half a million citizens living in the city proper, and twice as many people commuting daily into the city. For Steve who grew up on a remote farm and rarely saw gatherings larger than a few hundred, the adjustment to life in Eisenturm had been difficult. Before their marriage, Steve lived in a two bedroom apartment he had shared with his mother in Fiorera, the capital of Terrini. He cooked his own breakfasts, he vacuumed his own floors, and more often than not, he did his own laundry. Moving from such comfortable independence to the gilded marble halls decorated with priceless artwork of centuries past took its toll on Steve.
“Fifteen year olds in the south drive legally: I have faith in you,” Tony assured him, then without waiting for an answer, tossed Steve the keys. “Shotgun!”
“Yeah, just—” Steve held up his phone again, “Tony, laundry; I’ll be right there.”
It already felt like all eyes at 1PP were collectively turned on him. Steve could all but feel them breathing down his neck for breaks in the case and viable suspects. The last thing he needed was Bucky perched on his desk smelling like bacon rolls he hadn’t brought to share and grumbling about Tony Stark’s late night call.
“I watch our videos two, three times a day. I’ve memorized every sound you make,” Steve murmured, sweeping his big palms up and down Tony’s back before taking him more firmly around the waist. “Every look into the camera. The memory of you looking up at me… but, this isn’t just sex, is it?”
Steve thanked her and instinctively reached for his pocket to offer her a tip for her help, only to realize he didn’t have a pocket, and he had no cash. He floundered for a minute before thanking her again and hurrying away through the well-dressed, mingling crowd.
“Oh,” Tony said after a brief pause of absolute silence. “You really liked them, huh?”
Tony couldn’t stop staring, either at Steve or the house. He needed a minute to regroup.
For one last time, a golden light shone from deep within Stephanie’s chest like a bright, white star, cascading over her skin and her clothes until it consumed her body entirely, even as Tony held her tightly to his heart. It all happened so fast that Tony was still lost in kissing Stephanie that he barely noticed her transforming, until she grew nearly a hundred pounds heavier in his arms. He pulled his head away from the kiss as he stumbled backward, struggling to stay upright with all 240 pounds of Steve clutched possessively in his arms.
“…you do realize you’ve only been dating him three months, right?”
“A little?” Maria gawked in clear disbelief. “Honey, I had one of those cinnamon rolls you made. Two of them,” she admitted, probably in case God was listening in. “We’ll teach you how to make a red velvet that’ll put some meat on that boy’s bones.”
“You treat me like you’re embarrassed by me, Steve,” Tony insisted, closing the opportunities for Steve to weasel his way out of the argument. “You can’t care about me and also be embarrassed by me on the sly. Life doesn’t work like that.”
“I can smell the pies,” Steve interrupted them both to say. “Or I am getting really hungry; either way, I want to eat pie.”
Even half asleep Tony wasn’t falling for Steve’s promise so easily. He tilted his head back far enough to give him a long-suffering look. “Don’t you mean, you’ll come with me
Despite the grip Steve had of him, Tony adjusted his position to leave Steve’s throbbing cock untouched.
“You know,” Clint said quietly to Tony, as if there’d be hell to pay if someone somehow caught them making such terrible, uncouth life choices. “If Steve cleans the house while we’re out, I bet I could get back here in time to get the grill going for lunch.”
The man looked up from whatever he was doing on his computer to stare at them. At Steve.
“What, because PDA makes people uncomfortable?”
He looked like he was falling in love with the stars.
From across the kitchen, Steve stopped mid-way through separating an egg and turned to look at Tony over his shoulder. Sure enough, he was back in the armchair he’d pulled up to the kitchen table where Steve had abandoned some offers the previous night. Steve preferred a regular kitchen chair to read in for work since it kept him from getting too comfortable, but Tony leaned hard in the opposite direction - especially if he was reading scripts for Steve. He cozied up with a script like a new thriller by a favorite author, and if he was quiet for more than thirty minutes, Steve knew it was a winner.
“Son, when are you bringing that man of yours over for dinner?”
“Steve, reconsider,” were the first words out of Tony’s mouth, but all Steve could give him was a bittersweet smile.
There was a rolling tray with a champagne bottle chilling in a bucket of ice waiting outside his room.
“And when you’re family,” she continued, just as seriously, “if anybody hurts you, you tell me. I don’t care if they’re in New York, California, or fucking Mexico. You’re my son, my boy. Howard doesn’t always let me handle it my way,” she conceded with a wry smile, “but honey, nobody hurts my family.”
“Brock told me all about you,” Sharon told him with a smirk that barely concealed her haughty disdain. “You and your pictures are famous at our club, but he didn’t tell me you’d be here. I guess your pictures aren’t the only things going around.”
“Don’t follow me closely, alright? If something happens to me—”
“Good morning to you, too,” Tony grinned up at him, and as Steve made his way to the couch, he tossed his phone aside and shifted his position to make space for Steve beside him. Steve didn’t need to be told twice. He sat down on the couch, sprawled comfortably between the large, plush cushions and the firm lines of Tony’s body.
When Tony only shook his head and tried to brush it off, Steve pushed back a little and gently asked, “What’ve you got to lose?”
“Two breaks: one in his ankle, one in his foot,” Steve confirmed grimly, and Tony could only shake his head in dismay. “He wants to stay, but, there isn’t much we can do about it.”
In the short time he had been with Steve, Steve only allowed him to nurse on his cock in the mornings for the harvest. What traces of contentment lingered in his body from his morning feeding were enough to keep him to the next day. To have two feedings in one day was a unusual, and only when Steve felt particularly generous or proud.
The woman was hanging on to the back-end of the saddle, undulating her hips with every toss and turn of the bull. Steve couldn’t bring himself to look away; it was an inevitable disaster.
“You feed me, you do the laundry,” Tony started listing while Steve peeled back the two sides of Tony’s shirt to expose his sleep-warm chest. With a quick flash of impish delight, Steve pressed an adoring kiss over Tony’s heart.
“Dear god,” Tony whispered, powerless to resist as Steve reeled him in by his tie for a slow, tender kiss. When they naturally eased apart, Tony sighed against Steve’s wet, kiss-swollen lips, tired but content. “You… look like a dream.”
It turned out that Maria kept her promises. Gossip surrounding first-year law students at Harvard weren’t usually this juicy and unproblematic: people were either caught in terrible acts of entitlement, or they were making headlines for remarkable contributions to public policy. Controversial romance between two men on opposite sides of a case was just enough low-stakes excitement that nobody thought twice about having an opinion.
Steve popped the M&Ms bag open on the kitchen counter. Bucky’d made decent progress, so he filled the top half of the bag with Ben & Jerry’s Schweddy Balls (vanilla & rum ice cream loaded with fudge covered rum and malt balls) and poured on some of Aunt May’s homemade caramel sauce. He zipped the bag shut, shook it up, then opened it to fill it past capacity with whipped cream straight out of the can.
“Pick up his Polycom and put it in my conference room,” he was telling her, “then call his authors and explain what happened. And I need you around this weekend to help review his files and manuscripts—”
you’re heaven, you feel, feel so—”
Steve smiled back brightly, feeling himself sit up taller in his seat. While it seemed the other first-years were less hostile in this environment, he was deeply grateful to have a friend on the team.
On the Marchesa’s eighteenth birthday the King again extended an offer of marriage. Within a week, Maria ended the courtship of a Danish prince and ran to the young King of Machtberg. Together they saw the dawn of a new kingdom. They weathered World War II better than most European countries, safe in the shelter of the mountain and profiting wildly from the weapons Howard contributed to world history.
“It’s open,” he called from his desk, finishing his sentence before turning to see who it was.
“Didn’t take you for a lightweight, Barton.”
, you’re such an asshole.”
was not a kiss,” he whispered, and he leaned in closer until Tony could feel Steve’s breath against his lips. “Would you like to know what a kiss is, Tony?”
Tony glanced in the direction of the sitting room. It hadn’t occurred to him before that he didn’t know what kind of wedding Steve might want. They hadn’t planned on a wedding for a wedding’s sake, so it hadn’t seemed important at the time, but this wasn’t exactly something they’d do together twice.
“Could I have four black bean tacos with roasted sweet potatoes and poblano peppers, six grilled shrimp on slaw, six roasted corn and chickpea, and, uh. A second agua fresca.”
Steve sniffed to himself, but didn’t say anything as he opened up a new tab to look through the lacy bottoms. He scrolled through slowly, trying not to look as overwhelmed as he felt by all the different designs - so many of them looked the same! - and the variety of colors, but when he next glanced at Sharon, she was smiling down at her fingers.
I think it’s charming
And it didn’t hurt that Steve couldn’t stop smiling. He leaned in close and kissed Tony’s cheek before cupping his face gently in his hands and kissing his lips. Tony melted into him and (much too soon) decided to forgive Steve for his underhanded bargaining.
“Beautiful,” Tony murmured, his voice deep and hoarse in a way Steve had never heard from him. He needed to hear it again; he couldn’t bear it if this was the last time he made Tony sound this way.
,” Tony snarled. “‘All men’ couldn’t care less about me. All I care about is me and my swamp. My life is good in my swamp, it’s peaceful; quiet. Or it was, until
, and a kiss that had Tony moaning in a way Steve had never heard before.
The touch of his skin was the first physical contact Tony had experienced since his parents had passed away. It was nauseating, revolting, and Tony squeezed his eyes shut to steady himself, to silence any cry and restrain himself from jerking his hand away in disgust.
“I want it,” he mumbled, slurring most of the words into his pillow, but he really couldn’t find the energy to make his tongue move yet. “Tony, please,” he whined, clumsily pressing back with his hips to better articulate what he needed. “Fuck me, Tony. Sweetheart, please.”
“Sorry mate, that’s false,” Karl said, though he still sounded pretty cheerful. “It’s some character called… Galvarino?”
“...I could use some good news,” Steve admitted, albeit cautiously. Everyone knew you started with the bad news, but if Steve got thirty seconds to pretend everything was fine and Tony only had good news to share, why deny himself? He had the rest of his life for bad news.
“Do you remember what we did for my birthday this year?” Steve asked Tony instead, apropos of nothing.
“I asked her to help me find boots,” Steve confessed. “I didn’t—I thought, if everyone—”
“You think I can eat anything in this?” Tony muttered to himself as he made his way to the kitchen. Steve didn’t need heightened senses to know he was being ogled behind his back, and if it wasn’t impossible, Tony’s blatant admiration made Steve feel like he could fly.
“Well, alright, sure, but there’s nothing I can do about that right now,” Tony eventually said, then urged Steve on to the nearest chaise lounger. Distantly, Steve heard the a door open and close, and the voices of two chuckling men filtered from the way they came. The dogs whined quietly around them before three of them trotted back towards the front door, compelled to go greet their master.
He paused long enough to greet the big wigs at the door in passing, but then he cut a direct path to their designated tables. Steve had said he’d wait for Tony there, and with any luck, Tony might convince his man to join him on the candle-lit mezzanine for an intimate intermission and some cock...tails.
Before millions of their people and their officiating marriage counselor, Steve and Tony had sworn to stand at each other’s sides in sickness and in health, until death do them part. And Steve had every intention of keeping his promise.
Never in his wildest dreams had Steve thought of divorce as something equal to marriage, but now he wouldn’t breathe for fear of missing a second of this new perspective Tony shared. He felt like a man who’d walked through life with blinders only to now have them taken off so he could see even more of the beauty in the world around him.
Fuck, I’m sorry—”
“Was—is someone using my books?” he choked out, presumably addressing his questions to the detectives even if he couldn’t stop looking at the horror put in front of him. “Were they killed like this? Were they—did, oh god,” he gasped with a sudden whimper, scrubbing a hand over his eyes and covering his mouth as the shock turned to overwhelming distress.
His king! If this was my grandfather’s time, they would all be in the dungeon for their blatant disrespect. Were it not an act of treason, Rhodey would have fed me breakfast by force this morning, I am sure of it. As it happens, he was called away before breakfast, so to spite him I requested his favorite order.”
“Your clothing will have to be tailor made because our clothing is not made for your, uh,” she frowned a little as she tried to think of a polite way to explain herself. “Your volume, Captain. Your dimensions are unusual; you are not overweight, simply excessively… muscular,” she finished diplomatically.
In the momentary pause when Tony turned the page, the silence was filled with a quiet huff of a snore. Surprised, Tony looked down to find Seamus had closed his eyes, and was snoring shamelessly.
Tony scoffed and turned to Steve for back-up, but ever the strategist, Steve had furtively started a quiet conversation with Laura and was not available for throwing himself in front of the freight train that was life-long family arguments.
“Steve, I think it was her,” he whispered urgently. Distantly he knew it could be the bloodloss talking, but in that moment this delirious epiphany felt more real than his own bones. He needed someone to tell Q or Bond; he needed someone to
“At least you got one good thing out of it,” Paulette said with a bittersweet smile. “But was that good enough to hold on to?”
“Unbelievable. He broke the internet that day, I’m pretty sure,” Josh chuckled happily, but at a cue from Steve’s agent, Josh started pouting. “You’re kidding me, that’s our time? Are you sure? But I don’t want to go,” he complained with an exaggerated whine that had Steve laughing. “Steve, this has been really great, thank you for making the time to chat with us today! Congratulations again on both yours and Tony’s movies. And hey, maybe next time you’re in the City, we can follow up on some of this? Maybe with three of us at the table?”
“Hydrangeas are for apologies?” Steve echoed under his breath in disbelief, and a faint blush of embarrassment rose in his cheeks. “Christ, I didn’t—Tony, I was trying to propose!” he all but croaked, a breath away from laughing at his damn misjudgment. “I thought I’d hide the key in the flowers, give you the flower pot, and let you find the key. I thought it’d be ...romantic, I’d bring you here, we’d plant the flower in the garden so we’d always see it - except I never knew what to say. So, I brought you here instead. It was simpler,” he admitted with a sheepish smile that Tony couldn’t resist comforting with another kiss.
“Tony,” Steve leaned in to whisper at a polite volume against Tony’s cheek. “If you want to talk, we don’t have to stay, but other people are trying to watch the movie.”
“I need to tell you something about my… my life, before,” Steve told him. “It occurred to me yesterday, and I think… I mean, it meant a lot, to me.”
Tony fingers curled into fists around Steve’s hair, pulling and pushing in turn, torn between wanting to make it last and make it good for Steve, too, and his rapidly mounting need to come. His resistance only lasted minutes, and all too soon, he was pushing Steve’s face down on his cock as his hips thrust up without abandon, pounding his cock into Steve’s hot, willing mouth until his hips snapped off the mattress with the force of his orgasm, filling Steve with his come.
Tony rolled his eyes, though he couldn’t resist a big grin. “I’ll drink to that,” he mumbled into his drink, then downed the rest of it.
“You’re already talking to her, just tell her I’m busy. We’re eating, she can wait,” Steve explained, but Tony’s momentary disbelief started to look more like irritation.
A glimmer of excitement returned to Tony's expression as he remembered his new discovery over the weekend. “Thank you for recalling my joy-joy feelings, my friend. In fact, I received a most thoughtful gift from my dear friend Virginia Potts containing the cinematic archive discs from the 21st. This gift has helped reverse the profound sadness from when I regrettably finished my collection featuring the incomparable actor, Jackie Chan. I now continue my tutelage under the delightfully reckless and invigorating Jason Statham.”
For the first time, Steve realized Tony stood in front of him without his armor—unguarded and wildly hopeful.
Maria Hill
“Thank you,” Steve answered the second year with a genuine smile and walked to where a group of his peers were settling in.
money, Tony did exactly what Steve wanted him to do: he took the damn money.
But Steve wasn’t done with him yet; a young gem like this was good for more than one orgasm. If Steve had his way, Tony would be good for another two, minimum.
She handed him a drink, then sat down in the swing with one for herself, and settled a big photo album in her lap.
With his legs spread and his hips elevated, Torin made room for one more candle on the altar between Ean’s thighs. The gentle flame cast golden light on the most vulnerable and intimate anatomy, illuminating his exposed cock and trembling thighs to their audience. Slim shadows danced over his smooth skin, and finally Torin allowed himself to begin.
“And I’m not half as worried about my career as I was about how today would end,” Tony admitted before his pride interfered. The least Tony could do was to put himself out there after Steve took a chance and proposed. “Steve, I thought you were breaking up with me.”
“You go,” Steve coughed, trying to wave him off. “Leave me, I’m a lost cause.”
“Absolutely.”
For one monumental second, Tony’s whole world was put on pause.
“Steve mentioned that your wife’s birthday was coming up, and that she likes scented candles,” he said casually.
“Next Monday,” he rasped once he’d pulled Steve away from his lips. “Take me somewhere nice.”
“What is he, twelve?” Natasha drawled, then turned to Steve with her own genius suggestion. “Take him to the shooting range. Guys are horny for compliments.”
Tony led the way into the stairwell and tried not to cry. Wayne’s office was on the 72nd floor.
Steve sprayed his mouthful of beer across the counter and very nearly caught the bartender. Tony erupted in fits of wheezing laughter and only managed to stay on his stool with Bucky’s help. Steve thought he caught them fist-bumping on the sly, but it was hard to see anything past the rush of embarrassment over his awful mess—he dabbed furiously at the model lake he’d just single-handedly made out of beer, until the bartender who’d been clear of it all by mere inches took mercy on him and mopped it all up. With a warning to take it more slowly, Steve was served another pint.
it lacked personal touches?
But he was supposed to be a Stark. The next Howard Stark, the next CEO. He could disagree with his parents, but stocks would plummet if he didn’t get up there to take the reins after Howard. People would lose their jobs, families their income. He’d heard it hundreds of times before; he owed it to them. Stark Industries was what he was meant to do.
Tony gave him a long-suffering look that spoke volumes of how little he worried about Steve’s promises. “Steve, we’ve been over this: I know you’re good for it. It’s just money, we’ll figure it out.”
They strolled side by side through the pleasant morning crowd, stopping here for a spinach and feta croissant, there for a lime and pistachio cake. One industrious soul had set up shop for fresh, hot coffee, and Tony drank his first cup so quickly Steve handed his own over to him and ordered himself another.
“‘s okay, Tony,” Steve continued with even less clarity. “Bost’n, there’s always a party somewhere.”
“And you’re sure he’s a good dude?” Rhodey asked even as he scrolled through his contacts for Carol’s number. “We can trust him?”
Tony stared at the plate of eggs he had been given. When he looked up at Stephanie again, he looked at her with confusion and wonder. “You… you made this? For us?”
Steve howled with laughter, holding on to the door frame for support.
“The Fast and the Furious guy? That’s how you pictured me?”
“So what’s the part you’re reading for? What are we working with?” Tony wondered with a smile that surely gave away how relieved he was to see Steve genuinely smiling again. He bit down on his cheeks as soon as the thought occurred to him, doing what he could to keep a straight face until he had himself under enough control to do it himself.
Tony made the mistake of opening his eyes and seeing the crowd. Every creature was openly staring at him; some were even bold enough to touch themselves openly, taking full advantage of the show Steve was putting on for his own benefit.
“And you’re fucking gorgeous,” Tony whispered when he opened his eyes again, licking into Steve’s mouth with a playful flick of his tongue.
Tony sat down on the coffee table in front of Steve and offered him an unopened box of Sno Balls. “You’ll feel better,” he promised.
“And here we thought we were being quite clever,” Bucky admitted with a sarcastic, feigned ignorance. “If you do use a ghostwriter, you can stick around and finish your signing, and probably sell hundreds of your latest bodice ripper—”
“You… you,” Tony gasped, words failing him at every turn. Steve grinned down at him then, and leaning in, he brushed a kiss over Tony’s floundering, parted lips.
“Just skimming for the sexy parts… that last one had you jumping naked into a vat of milk,” Tony reported, though as the sound of turning pages started up again, he became a little more distracted. “I’d pay good money to see that, que rico.”
Tony waggled his eyebrows, but it was gone as quickly as it happened, hidden behind a small but sincere smile. “Any chance you’re wrapping up soon?”
The fact that Tony kept up with them and even offered advancements of his own didn’t seem to affect how they looked down their noses at him. In that first week, they sent him out like a common messenger boy to retrieve a component for a design that some bigwig in Harvard had created.
Tony gaped in surprise before he dissolved into a delighted peal of giggles, practically folding in on himself on the couch beside Steve. He might have tried to say something—he thought maybe Tony was trying to say his name, but there was no way to tell what were squeaks of amusement and what were recognized words in the English language.
“Alright, the last question,” Karl said as he glanced back at his cards, “Tony, it’s your chance to tie this up. What movie first inspired Steve to become an actor?”
“Hawley’s firm is representing a major divorce case worth millions and her caseload is so heavy she’s taking on first-year interns.”
The privilege was overwhelming, and not for the first time, Steve could feel the emotions welling up behind his eyes, unbidden.
But unlike the other people who haunted Steve’s past, Steve needed Tony. Steve had already invested too much time and too much effort to turn his attention elsewhere. By the end of the day, he would only have nine days left to get married and save his career.
He came hard, and he remembered no more.
He grabbed an extra bottle of orange juice for Sam who was by all accounts allergic to drinking out of glasses, and with a basket full of Nutter Butters and Korean barbecue kettle chips, he made his way to the check out. The self check-outs were closed for maintenance and only one cashier was doomed to work at the asscrack of dawn, so Bucky hung back from the only other customer in line and looked over the typical impulse purchase options half-heartedly until it was his turn.
“No,” Tony interrupted Steve before he said any more. “Don’t. Don’t ‘oh, Tony’ me, like I’m some wayward child. Like I’m a victim. I lost everything that was important then. They all look at me here, they see I’m different. I’m not as strong. I’ll never go on a drive with my brother again, I’ll never feel the rush of the cage. The only horse I can ride anymore is Dummy, because I broke him in, he’s only ever been mine, and he’s so familiar I could ride him in my sleep. But my life now,” Tony said with a small, but genuine smile, “Steve, I’m enjoying my life. I apply myself in other ways, not just physical strength. It’s a second chance; how many people can say they had that?”
, or something like that.”
“I used to be like you, too: the science always came first, publications and figuring out - well, everything, but Thor isn’t getting in the way of that, it’s just different now. I promise, it only gets better when you have someone to share it with.”
“Uh,” Tony stalled for a moment before excusing himself from something Steve couldn’t hear. Tony’s attention was back to Steve in the next moment. “It could be really bad, Steve. Do you have the packages?”
Steve’s hard rhythm abruptly became a series of aggressive, desperate thrusts as he lost himself to the hot, greedy pulsing clutch of Tony’s body.
“We have a meeting with Hawley tonight. She wants to see you there early,” she told him. “Maria said you had second thoughts about Hansen.”
Except, Steve was too impatient to wait for their new equipment to arrive: he wanted to take Tony out into the world at first opportunity.
“A stallion in his prime, no less. And raring to go,” she added with a smirk, eyeing the noticeable bulge in his jeans. “Boy, you did good—”
Of all the people, Steve had never expected to see Sharon barging in when he needed a rescue.
He left Tony with a quick peck on the cheek and made his way to the kitchen to see what he could scrounge out of the fridge. They’d gone through a pizza-baking phase recently that had quickly become a calzone-making phase, and Steve hung in the open fridge door trying to decide between a mushroom, feta, and olive, and a ham and extra cheese.
“Tony, I’ve missed spending time with you, too,” he said softly. “Benedita showed me this place a month ago and, I’ve… Tony, I’ve wanted to come back here with you ever since.”
He rushed out of the living room and out of sight. Steve blinked at the space around him, wondering if he was meant to follow, or if Tony wanted to have sex in the living room. Somehow, Steve doubted the man was wild enough to have sex outside of a bed. But Tony hadn’t asked him to follow, so Steve tried to get more comfortable in his armchair and wait. Instead, he cupped his hands in front of his mouth to check his breath and lifted his arms to sniff at his armpits. The shower at the prison had been a rinse at best, and he hoped the stale smell of his body was only in his imagination.
Tony startled and looked up from the page he hadn’t been reading. While he was lost in his thoughts, Steve had come into his office and perched on his desk. He wore a blue terry cloth robe and, as far as Tony could tell, little else. Tony put his papers aside and smiled back at his impish husband.
The picture Steve painted pulled Tony out of whatever thoughts weighing on his mind, and he snickered giddily at this new depiction of Captain America. “Captain America, house spouse?” he teased. “That’s a big career change, Steven, you think you can handle it?”
Good point.
“On your timeline, you’ll have to,” she agreed. “And if you don’t lock down a third date at the end of this one, cut him out. Move on.”
“Aw, come on,” Clint sighed, rubbing the dragon’s nose gently in an effort to soothe her. How something so scaly and so frightening looked heartbroken and miserable was beyond him, but somehow it explained Stephanie’s hesitation to bring the dragon into a fight. “Can’t you see she’s sad? She’s sad, Tony.”
But instead of smiling again or relaxing at their very near destination, Tony felt Mr. Perfect body grow stiff against his side.
Steve rolled his eyes, but he reached down to undo his jeans. “You sure know how to make this all feel special.”
“I—ma’am, wait!” Steve called after her, but it was no good; Maria didn’t listen, and before Steve got to his feet, she had disappeared into the house, out of sight.
“Pierce is not the first person in history that wanted a homogenous, pacified herd of people following him,” Bucky told Tony on their short walk. “He’s not the first person who wanted to control his people’s education and genetic makeup. Steve and I went to war against one in our time,” he added, “he didn’t succeed. Another one got close in the 21st. But this time, Pierce has almost succeeded.”
The climb started out well, but quickly turned into a crawl. Somewhere around the thirtieth floor Tony had to sit down to catch his breath, and poor Steve laid out on his back to soak up the cool comfort of the polished floor. Tony almost felt bad, except he meant what he said. It didn’t matter how many floors they had to climb; this was their best chance, and he wasn’t going to let it slip away.
“I don’t need them to love me. They don’t even have to like me,” Steve muttered. “I just don’t want them to be disappointed if… if you’re with me.”
“Don’t even joke about that,” Steve grunted between panting breaths, and he could feel Tony’s answering laugh vibrating against his chest. He moaned plaintively, pressing sloppy, lingering kisses across Tony’s chest as he nosed his way to the elegant, unblemished column of Tony’s neck.
Without thinking, Tony snatched up a wrench and threw it after his retreating friend, who had enough sense to duck even when giggling like a wayward child.
Tony shrugged one shoulder, but it took him a while to answer. “Same reason I moved up north,” he admitted, as objectively as he could. “I had a series of bad injuries. Horse ran over my arm, bull threw me into a wall. Fell on my neck. Add to that lifelong—whatever, you get it,” he sighed, before he thought too much about it. “It’s not the safest sport.”
“Do you require a rescue?”
. The tackiest form of communication, and yet Tony felt it all through his body, fluttering in his poor heart and curling his toes.
“I mean, I feel like there’s nothing left for me to say. I’m pretty sure you’ve made it when Trump personally tweets mean things about you,” Josh observed casually, and to Steve's endless joy. “That’s a standard universal law now, right?”
He plucked the ticket off the machine printer, and considered the softened recycled paper between his fingers.
“Not in tick tocks?” Steve wondered without looking up from his loops and his needles. “What a shame.”
Finally, they had a lead.
“Uh, okay. Alright,” he sighed eventually. “I’m from Oklahoma, outside Tulsa. I moved up for college, been here ever since. Eight years now.”
A folded paper was thrown at his chest. “Is it true?”
Bucky frowned down at the papers put in front of him, clicking his pen impatiently as he read. His lips twisted in a wry grimace as he compared the different excerpts, and Steve inwardly sighed at the sight. Bucky didn’t read these books, he couldn’t be expected to find the finer details in Tony’s writing so quickly.
“Does that read my whole hand?” Steve wondered, looking down at his dry hand with surprise.
“Keep talking like that and I will drag you to bed with my bare hands,” Tony whispered against Steve’s jaw, but rather than worrying or delighting in Tony’s very genuine threat, Steve chuckled cheerfully and slipped his hands into Tony’s back pockets to squeeze him closer.
Steve shook his head and only tried to hold him closer. He pressed a loving kiss to Tony’s temple and his hair, unbothered by the clusters of dust and dirt clumped into his greasy hair. “You protected our people,” Steve told him softly, almost in apology. “I should have been here with you, Tony. It should have been me.”
The fellowship for trauma counseling had been their first priority, but if he was honest, Tony suspected it was a more urgent concern for him than Steve. Howard had taught him to be a strong king, a respected and admired king. Sarah had showed him by example the importance of communication, of actively listening so that the source of a problem cannot be concealed. But Steve is the one who taught Tony patience and kindness. In the end, both Sarah and Howard had in their own ways tried to be effective, successful leaders. Steve was the one who had seen the devastation of war, who had seen first hand the unspeakable price of freedom. His priority was to protect his people, to care for them. He was not a king who desired leadership and respect, he was a king who foremost was a public servant, and the first line of defense for his people, whether they feared starvation or oppression. Tony had never imagined his power so humbled, yet Steve made it seem natural, so obvious, that with every passing day Tony started to wonder how it had never occurred to him before.
They walked through the streets of Eisenturm hand in hand, and with Bucky and Natasha beside them, they looked like any two friendly couples making their way to the Christmas market.
“Tony, why don’t you stay with me tonight?”
With a wet, gurgling cry, Tony’s body seized with the sudden force of his orgasm. His hips stuttered against the counter helplessly as his trapped cock painted his bare chest with his own come. Steve’s filthy tongue silenced with a heavy groan of pleasure, and he bore down on Tony, fucking Tony through his orgasm for the pleasure of thrusting against the tight clutch of his convulsing muscles, until he buried himself deep in Tony’s ass and came hard. He continued fucking Tony’s ass through his own orgasm, until he was powerless to do anything but let Tony’s recovering body milk his softening cock.
“He needs to know,” Pepper said before Rhodey had to slur through a monologue of ‘what is right and true in the  Red, White, and Brew!’ “I mean, this is serious: you’re dating, and it’s—a week, wow, Steve, I mean, with this one it’s like dog years, you have to be committed—”
Tony murmured something in the affirmative, drawing his knees together and curling into a content cuddle. Steve eased up on the heat and humidity he was projecting into the room, and soon the Boston winter air seeped in, encouraging Tony to crawl under the covers again for warmth.
Tony sat up in the tub, careful not to move too quickly to either startle Steve or have the warm water sloshing over the rim. Without dislodging the ring boxes, he reached for Steve’s hand and brought it up to kiss the palm of his hand. “Steve? It’s not that complicated... it’s kind of what you call a ‘no-brainer’? Cause if that's what it takes to date you proper,” Tony said with an adoring smile, “then watch me marry you, darling.”
“Boss?” she whispered even in the privacy of his office. “What’s wrong? How did the date go?”
He didn’t need to be popular; he didn’t even need lots of friends! If he could only find Brock and show him that he
Later that day, it went without question that Tony would help Steve home from set. Some of the crewmen helped Tony pack his limping co-star into his Jeep, strap him in, then stood on the curb and waved goodbye as Tony drove them off into the sunset without a clue.
A hammering on the bedroom door suddenly cut through the comforting silence, and Tony groaned at the pain of being startled awake.
“But, their legs are so long. Can’t they run faster?”
“Suit yourselves,” Thor pouted, curling his hands more protectively around his stein of tequila. “What do you know anyway? Too kinky for your Christian ears.”
By the time they made it to the Tower of London, saw the remains of London’s original city wall, and took the tube back to Steve’s place, Steve was at the end of his rope. He tried to keep it together, but either he was losing his touch, or Tony simply knew him too well. They went back and left the groceries for another day.
“Christ—Steve, thank god,” Tony croaked out into Steve’s happy-tingling shoulder, and when he lifted his head again Steve could see the tears wet on his cheeks.
Some people dreamed of sleeping in a bed with stacks of Benjamins, and others would covet the chance to tumble into bed with their favorite models or Hollywood A-lister. Then there was Tony, who could sit in his personal rooftop jacuzzi overlooking the Manhattan skyline and comfort himself with the idea that Steve was only running late from his lecture. Tony’s phone was an arm’s length away, and any moment it would buzz to life with an apologetic text from Steve, who would apologize endlessly for not being there to personally undress Tony for their bath at the end of the work day, and promise Tony a kiss for every second he was late.
“No, I’m driving,” Tony replied, and Steve could feel his hackles rising at yet another occasion where he was told rather than asked what to do. “Steve,” he continued, before Steve could think of the right words to say. “We’re not going to a big city, we’re going to a ranch in the middle of nowhere. It’s dark already, and there are a lot of unlit, unmarked dirt roads GPS doesn’t know about. You can drive when there’s sunlight,” he finished, gentling his tone as he did.
“Associate Bob Sitwell, we have an appointment with our esteemed Governor this morning,” Tony said before Steve said anything inappropriate. “Please take us to his office.”
company, your Majesty?”
“First of all,
“Anything you need to know?” Tony echoed as he considered Steve’s question, then with a smile he couldn’t quite feel, he said, “I mean, this is it. This is your last chance. The south is ...you know,” he tried to explain with a little shrug, but when he noticed Steve taking a breath to say something, he rushed to say, “so, you might have heard, they’re not the nicest to gay—or bi—people, they think God said so, whatever. And just cause my parents know I’m not straight doesn’t mean everyone’s cool with it. Doesn’t even mean they’re cool with it, so that’ll be fun—but, you know. They know. And open—”
“I will return with you,” she said. “We will try it your way. If this does not work, you will help me find a tribe and a bride to lift the curse. Do you agree?”
“I can help,” he offered, without knowing anything about fences. It was almost worth it to see Tony blinking wildly in surprise.
“Last time we were at the Commonwealth, it’s,” Steve cleared his throat took another glance around his room to be sure his roommate was gone and not hiding somewhere in their room to eavesdrop for no good reason. “You were face down, I was, I was holding onto the headboard and, and fucking you. God, it was so good, baby, you were so good, the sounds you were making, I was going out of my mind—”
“Exactly, you know what’s going to happen.”
Steve got to his feet before he lost his mind, settling into his favorite place behind Tony bare, ready ass. He pulled his clothes off in a matter of seconds, then with a firm grip of each of Tony’s full cheeks, Steve spread him open to indulge in the mouth-watering sight of Tony’s stretched hole and his puffy, furrowed rim all shiny with lube. Despite the thorough fingering and stretching, Tony still keened like a wounded animal when Steve stretched him too far, and every time he did, Steve eased up his grip and soothed him with his thumb, rubbing at his sore rim and fucking him slowly, gently, until Tony’s voice lifted in deep, throaty moans for more.
, when there’s a picture of Martin Luther King, Jr. hanging over the bed. It’s like he’s judging me or something.”
“Will it hurt?”
Spreading those ass cheeks again, Steve swept a lazy but insistent circle around Tony’s hole, painting his target wet and warm with the lube from his gloves. Cautiously, he slipped his middle finger in to the first knuckle, and he was met with minimal resistance. Perhaps Steve had misjudged his ass on first inspection; maybe Tony had practiced enough on his own fingers or toys in the past. If he did so regularly, he’d only have made Steve’s jobs easier.
“There isn’t much to tell,” Steve said with a shrug. “I don’t have any parents. I was a ward of the state until I turned 18. I moved to New York for my education, and I’ve never wanted to leave.”
Steve kept his thoughts to himself and drank his water slowly. Tony sat on the bed with him at a respectful distance. His robe was barely tied on, and his hair swept around his head in a mess of curls Steve could never have imagined in this world of highly manicured and impeccably groomed people. It was a strange relief to learn that bedhead still existed in the future.
Tony wanted to reach out to touch him, or at least repeat his question. Somehow, he resisted. Long minutes passed before Steve dared to let his hands fall away, and he opened his eyes again.
“Mom, I don’t know what to do,” he confided in her one afternoon while the kids were at recess. “What am I supposed to do? I care about him, but I can’t get the day started when he’s there. And my routine is good, it works.”
At ten past seven, there was a knock on his front door. Steve startled, staring at his door in shock, then immediately looked around his apartment to make a plan. He rushed to the remote, turned the TV on in the kitchen and set it to mute, then changed the channel to the Discovery channel. As a final touch, he ran to the kitchen and grabbed up a mug to pour himself some old, cold coffee into so he wouldn’t open the door empty handed.
“NYPD, police business,” Steve said quietly and flashed her his badge. “As you were.”
“Witnesses who lived on the same floor as Michael Dunn say he had a male nurse who visited twice a week for years,” Steve repeated, speaking slower this time in an effort to hide his irritation. “Yet there is no evidence Dunn had home visits from a nurse or any other medical professional in all the years he lived in the city. His insurance says nothing about any prolonged medical problems, except that he visited a chiropractor semi-regularly in 2005, but that’s—”
“I deserve that,” Sharon admitted ruefully. “There’s no excuse, really. I apologize for how I treated you, Steve. You can say I had a bad source of information about you, someone I shouldn’t have trusted as much as I did. But anyone who’s spent time with you only has good things to say—especially Phil. I don’t know what magic you worked there, but he’s probably your biggest fan, bar none.”
“Pepper, she sent me a picture of the boxes she left with you. I’m a fast reader,” Tony explained. “I thought I could help.”
“It will be an educational display, a show and tell,” Steve explained, stroking Tony’s cock leisurely, as if it was just an absent habit. “These are people working on becoming harvesters for your planet. There are few opportunities to observe a living human as part of the training, and females are more common than males. They will pay me a lot to learn how you come.”
“Mom!” Clint shouted over the noise, “it’s over—mom!”
To Tony’s delight, Steve recovered from his surprise first. “You do have incredible skies here,” he agreed. “Everything is so clear.”
“Maybe I wanted someone to get into my pants, did you think of that?” Steve countered, though he posed the question more out of curiosity than anger. “I’m tired and sore and in pain, maybe an hour with someone in my pants would, uh, cheer me up. Did you think of that, genius?”
Before Steve had a chance to insist that he didn’t need more pleasing or teasing, that he just needed four minutes to fuck Tony into spiraling ecstasy, Tony guided Steve’s long fingers to his tongue and into his mouth.
“Tony, I was getting worried,” Steve said with a broad smile, greeting Tony with a sweet kiss. “Everything okay?”
“I could use a break,” she said innocently enough. She looked like she was on a mission, and Steve knew better than to get in the way. While she dug around in her bag, he carefully placed the protective sheet over his charcoal drawing and tugged it into the center of the table.
Forgetting his earlier soreness and any concern about his nudity, Tony leapt out of bed and ran out of the bedroom without so much as looking at Steve.
get out of my fucking swamp!”
Tony sucked Steve’s bottom lip into his mouth through his teeth, and as predictable as gravity, Steve’s moaned and surged against him. What minor resistance Steve tried to put up faded into history. With newfound vigor, he spun them around, pressing Tony up against door, and pinned him there with his weight without losing the connection of their lips.
“You’re a regular Disney prince.”
“Not…
The next time consciousness intruded on Tony’s sleep, it was with a soft touch of his hair, lapping through it in a gentle rhythm. He smiled to himself and moaned quietly under his breath in appreciation.
“Hey, Steve?”
If you’re single + interested in men… maybe consider it a date?
“Uh, look, Tony, I hate to be the bearer of bad news—”
“That’s right, isn’t it?” Steve whispered to Violet, rubbing her back gently.
“Because you think I’m lying about being hurt?”
Sometimes, on the hazy cusp between lucidity and his dreams, Tony believed he could smell Steve in the thick fabric of his sweatshirt. Not the spicy, clean scent of Steve’s cologne, but the natural musk of his body, the memory of his sweat. Maybe to others it would not be so adored, and most would roll their eyes at his childish hope. Steve had not worn the sweater in over seven months, and while Tony refused to wash the hoodie, nothing could last forever.
But Steve wasn’t the only one there.
There was recognition in Steve’s eyes this time, and the knot in Tony’s chest eased a little. “No-one can hurt you here, Steve,” he whispered, “not a person, not an animal, not a soul. You’re safe here, I promise you.”
The masters paid Steve a handsome stud fee for all the ejaculate collected from Tony that day, and Steve waited until it was only the two of them left before lifting Tony’s limp, exhausted body from the harvesting machine.
“Says the busiest First Spouse of our generation.”
But Steve wouldn’t be Steve if he turned to a life of manicures and bon-bons. He loved what he did, working with people one on one and being a part of helping them regain their physical independence.
Tony had tried to be quiet, to tangle his hands into the bed sheets instead of clawing at Steve’s back, to bite down on the deep moans of satisfaction Steve’s wrung out of him, anything that might interrupt what Steve had planned for him, but it was so easy to forget that Steve read his body like it was his native language. With a knowing smirk and a mischievous wink, Steve pulled away for a third time, leaving Tony on the verge of release, almost sobbing in his frustration. Lube, lube, and more lube - Steve poured it all out over his fingers and rubbed it warm in one hand while Tony measured the pros and cons of trying to suck his own dick again.
There was nothing Tony wouldn’t do for him.
Unbidden, Tony found himself remembering happy Harold Hogan’s smug chuckling from their recent conversation. He was a good man, and here Tony was, watching his friend fail in his last attempt to crawl to safety in a room full of law enforcement officers who could do nothing to help him. A number of officers collapsed from shock, and others wept openly; the stronger souls only doubled over as they were sick over the pristine marble floors from the revolting and unimaginable brutality.
“Onto a floor full of BU swimmers and divers—”
But of the human fluids that had not been tested for practical use, saliva and sweat topped the list. Despite the risk, and knowing he would lose both his job and his license to harvest if he came back haunted with symptoms, Steve couldn’t resist the temptation. The risk was negligible compared to the overwhelming desire to receive what Tony seemed so desperate to give. He parted his lips as Tony pushed up enough to move past his chin and reach Steve’s mouth, and with lazy, sloppy imprecision, Tony’s lips slotted over Steve’s, spit, tongue, and all.
“Mr. Tony, Mr. Tony, do they have dinosaurs here?”
That didn’t mean their blatant exclusion didn’t hurt.
Since Steve had been expected to be in court on Tuesday, he’d already been excused from his classes in advance. But rather than doze the morning away, he got up when Tony did. He offered what help he could - about Hansen’s past in biochemistry and showed him the money trail Romanov would be using to proove Bucky’s payment for the two hired sex workers.
Tony didn’t have to look to know what it was. The way his day was going, he didn’t feel the need to look away from well-formed pecs (and the hard nipples that were so clearly visible through the sweaty shirt in this chilly weather) to know Marple had yet again tried to make a peace offering by returning the toy she’d stolen.
Steve wanted to see the Sleeping Lion and the old church, and apart from that he was happy to eat anything and walk anywhere. Tony wanted to eat his weight in fresh chocolate - the good shit, where the expiration date was measured by hours, not weeks. They sketched out a loose plan for the rest of their day in the city, and Tony had started furtively comparing the Vacheron Constantin catalogs in Lucerne and Geneva when the food arrived.
“That’s for Belova,” he whispered with a quiet sniff. He couldn’t catch his breath, his whole chest burned, and now his eyes were burning, but he’d be damned if he’d cry over this lying bastard. “Can’t—can’t believe you were dicking someone else—and I gave you pointers,
if they see my face!”
“Howard Stark,” Tony’s dad replied, shaking Steve’s hand with a firm grip that bordered on painful. “Ever been out in the country, boy?”
“Because people were
(Finally, they agreed on something.)
Paulette scoffed again, this time in agreement of Erin’s assumption. “Either way,” she said, “he’s just like any other man following his prick to greener pastures.”
“That, we’ve got,” the woman said with a relieved smile. “Will you be a secondary driver for the vehicle?”
“I like that blue,” Clint said when they met up in the hallway, grinning at his brother. “I was afraid you’d go for white.”
Tony's voice caught for a moment, and he glanced up at his anxious friend before recovering the strength to continue. “Your RMSP, Dr. Moses da Garça reports troubling findings in the potential genetic contribution of your most recent gamete deposit. Of particular concern to Dr. Moses da Garça are Lieutenant Robert B. Banner's hereditary predisposition for rageful and irrational reactivity. His concluding recommendations are to seek joint support from professional therapists who can provide medication, enroll in regular calming activities, and to avoid repetitive tasks. A list of service provides endorsed by Dr. Moses da Garça are enclosed for your convenience. Following a period of six months that demonstrate a consistent change in behavior, Dr. Moses da Garça will welcome Lieutenant Robert B. Banner to make a fourth attempt at his earliest convenience. Healthful wishes, Anastasia Wynmer.”
“Someone’s excited,” Tony teased, picking up the pace a little to catch her for a good pat, but she kept speeding up to stay a yard or so ahead of him.
Steve had the energy to help manage volunteers, but Tony stayed with the recovering survivors. Those with serious injuries were flown to hospitals in nearby cities, while those who had lost their homes in the attack were offered long-term accommodation in the nearest royal palace. Patients with minor injuries were kept overnight for observation. The emergency medical camp built around the needs of their patients was impermanent and unsuited to serious medical procedures, but it was enough for most, and rather than flooding neighboring city hospitals, the doctors of Lumine advised those who could to stay and, more importantly, spend time with their family and friends.
Steve kept his eyes on what he was doing. Slice a potato; stack the slices; cut lengthwise. He avoided the onions for now.
Steve ended the call with a happy ‘see you soon,’ and sent Tony a message with Shield’s address.
“That was your role way before getting the call for Iron Man, wasn’t it?” Karl asked Tony, who was mostly occupied with getting in on the puppy love. “How long were you on that show?”
, you’re doing real well,” Tony purred in a teasing sing-song. “When and where do I meet you?”
Tree roots never crossed his mind.
Did he burn through his week’s booze quota and read every relevant post on ONTD? Yes.
Eventually, he pulled his fingers free. Tony knew better than to whine or wriggle, so he lay still, allowing Steve to look his fill.
might have a blue tongue, but theirs has evolved to be purple. Evolution happens over many, many generations because it helps them live better in their environment. So our job is to think about how blue tongues could be helpful to giraffes. Where should we start?” he wondered, crouching down to help them conspire. “What do we know about giraffes?”
“Uh, sure,” Steve eventually managed. It had been a hundred and forty seven years, did he really want to question his luck? “But could you call me Steve?”
On that night after their visit to the Christmas market, Tony woke without realizing why. There was no knock at the door, no ringing phone. He lay still and concentrated, and soon enough, he felt it. A spasm in Steve’s hands, his fingers pressing into the meat of Tony’s ass. Even in the early stages of his dream, Tony could tell Steve wasn’t enjoying some salacious fantasy, or reliving their wedding night. There was no gentleness, no love; his fingers twitched with a nervous energy, and Tony could feel the tell-tale chills of Steve’s nightmares against his back.
Tony pursed his lips in distaste, giving Thor and Bruce both unimpressed looks. “Seriously. You, too?” he asked, dryly. “You realize this is for a job, right? I’m not trying to get laid; in fact, I’m trying to do the opposite! There was no sex.”
“Happy, stop the car.”
Tony frowned and waited, waited and frowned, but Bruce wasn’t about to change his mind. Finally, Tony let out a long, heavy breath, then turned to Thor.
Bruce slid into the seat across from Tony.
Steve chuckled, bowing his head to nuzzle at the crown of Tony’s head. “You can undress me all you like, as—”
Tony blinked at him, blindsided but determined to keep his comments to himself.
“Nobody cares more about me than you,” Tony promised him, “not even me. We’ve been sleeping together from the start, we haven’t used condoms in months. You think I worry you’d mistreat me in my sleep?” he asked in a deliberate misunderstanding he hoped would be enough to derail Steve’s concern. “You know how hot that makes me? The thought of waking up to you fingering me? Fucking me? Using my mouth?”
“Bullshit. For a candle?”
At four in the morning, Steve woke to the sound of an incoming message on his phone. Neither he nor Tony had any business being up at that time, and adrenaline coursed through Steve’s veins like ice. He jolted upright and grabbed for his phone with another hand automatically on the hotel phone to call Bucky in.
Tan, muscular, yet surprisingly well-rounded and supple.
“The whole state isn’t Malibu,” Steve drawled, then in a firmer tone, he said, “and unless you want a clean shave, Tony, stop moving.”
“No can do, I’m on call until 007 is de-briefed by H tonight,” Tony said with a helpless little shrug. “Just in case shit hits the fan.”
“Come
“Tony, don’t be ridiculous, you’re right across the river,” Steve tried to say, but Tony wasn’t having it.
Steve brought his hands up to cradle Tony’s face ever so gently. Even when all he wanted was to watch Tony with his dopey smile, Steve continued to brush his fingers softly Tony’s hair.
“Right, of course... why didn’t I think of that? I’m sure single Mr. Gay U-S-A is just waiting outside the office, dying to commit a federal offense!”
“That’s my seat,” he told her with a careful air of defiance. She smirked back, but she removed her bag so he could take the seat. His face warmed with a victorious grin and he wasted no time getting comfortable.
He punched in Steve’s number. His thumb hovered over the taunting green circle. It would be so easy.
. It sounded suspiciously like Bucky, and it reminded him that Tony had the slim average build of the figure in the hoodie, and a lead detective meeting suspects alone in private was a definite no-no. The letters Tony identified had only led to dead ends that, in retrospect, had wasted a lot of man hours. If Bucky was right and Tony was a suspect, integrating himself into the investigation at this level would be indescribably advantageous. Even without his intellect, a man like Tony Stark could already have enough insight to get away with his crimes. The last thing Steve should do was meet with him alone at a location where Tony had every advantage.
So while Steve labored over languages and customs by hiding away in reading rooms and libraries where nobody would bother him, Tony oversaw the unification. Steve helped where he could, but language limited him severely, and Tony had saved up enough patented designs to open to the global market so he could devote his full attention to the politics without interrupting their cash flow. Their countries were opposites in almost every way, from the material and technical backgrounds, to the services they needed. Machtberg had a highly skilled, highly paid population, while Terrini farmers and craftsmen were still recovering from decades of Stane’s dictatorship and years of war. If the unification was to work, they would have to walk the fine line between providing Terrini too much help and angering the wealthy with high taxes, and doing so little that their initial inequalities turned into a salient class divide.
Steve laughed and told him to eat slower, that there was plenty more if he wanted thirds or fourths. Then he told Tony about his day, about Pamela, the Marine who Steve was helping regain dexterity and control of her right hand, and Trey, the music teacher who was recovering from recent back surgery. Steve worked with the same clients on a weekly basis, and he often learned about their lives and families in the process. Tony had never met these people, but through Steve, they felt like good friends.
“Tony?”
“Yeah, alright. Sure,” Tony said with a smile, and without thinking, he reached over to give Steve a friendly clap on the arm. “I got nowhere else to be.”
“Heroism isn’t what you do when you know how things will turn out. You could’ve run away when you saw how big he was,” Tony pointed out, smiling up at him. “You didn’t run away. You don’t even know how much that meant to me.”
“Idiot?” he guessed. “I know.”
Steve nodded in the affirmative to Josh’s first question. “For those reasons I mentioned earlier, of how it brings us to these characters and stories where life feels hopeless and, we have these individuals who try to carve something out of their own aching circumstances. Especially against the backdrop of how we view the American experience and that American post-war zeitgeist, this is an important and compelling narrative of life we rarely talk about. It’s so easy to adhere to the spirit Eisenstaedt captured in the ‘V-J Day’ kiss, to imagine that the relief and exuberance was the lived experience for everyone everywhere in our country. But this was… there are projects you jump on because they are exciting, or they’re with great people, but we felt this was all of that in addition to a chance to highlight a part of US history that has been pushed aside. And Pollock’s story brings these elements to the fore through a compelling story characterized by people whose journeys we felt were somehow both familiar and unthinkable.”
Since Tony spent so much of his time in front of computer screens or working on tablets, they both made an effort to reduce screen time when they were together. On weekends they tried to get out of the house as much as they could - wandering through farmer’s markets, taking in a new museum exhibit, or stopping by for Shakespeare in the Park in the summertime. During the weekday when Tony got home late from work and didn’t have the energy to move a finger, they typically stayed in to play board games, solve crossword puzzles, or read together to wind down the night.
“Pardon?”
“Text me when you're home safe,” Thor replied, making Tony almost feel bad about his most recent thoughts.
Steve had noticed the smallest signs of fatigue on Tony’s face, but somehow he’d forgotten to give himself a second look. Had he really become so pale?
“You thought of everything, didn’t you?” Tony teased, leaning in to steal a chaste kiss from Steve’s lips. He still couldn’t believe he could, and he couldn’t get enough.
“Oh! I do,” he said and reached into his satchel where he pulled his resume out of a ready folder. “Here you go.”
“I thought it was something like that,” Steve admitted, and Tony could have basked in his twinkling smile and irrepressible amusement for hours. “I’ve never seen color drain from someone’s face so quickly before in my life.”
“At the time of his disappearance, he was a current member of Gay Arrangement dot com. According to his account history, he described himself as a sugar baby looking for a sugar daddy to, and I quote: ‘guide his professional development, fund his tasteful lifestyle, and help him refine and control his unbridled passion.’”
“Yeah, sure. Thanks,” Tony said with a little sniff, but he still gave Steve a friendly smile. “Hey, sleep well, Steve. I’ll see you for breakfast.”
“This feels like something I should’ve said before you ever saw my butt plug,” Tony said wryly as they made quick work to the nearest chairs at his small dining table. “But, Hi, I’m Tony.”
“Remind me, why am I in this position again?”
“Right now, Steve,” Bucky hissed, and Steve looked up at him immediately. His friend’s face was ashen and set in grim determination. It had been a lifetime since Steve had seen that expression on any man’s face, let alone Bucky’s. Steve got to his feet at once, smoothly buttoning his suit jacket and leading the way to the nearest exit with Bucky at his back.
Tony hadn’t packed much with him, and Steve found his travel size tube of water based lube easily. He tried to wait another two, three minutes, but it may have been closer to forty seconds before he rejoined Tony in the sitting room. The contrast of Tony, kneeling in offering in such an opulent, stately room that came with a price tag rivaling a typical mortgage moved Steve in ways he hadn’t expected. There was no doubt he had severely overestimated himself. In what world had he thought himself strong enough to resist Tony for any period of time?
“Maybe you can explain it better, babe,” Tony said, looping his arm around Steve’s and pulling him closer to literally draw him into their discussion. “Your adult, reasonably educated friend seems to be unclear on the difference between life and death.”
Jane rolled her eyes and gave him a look. “No, you’re not.”
“They say the Great Chief of Old cast the Last Chief out into the Far East,” Clint continued as if Tony hadn’t spoken. “If you help me find her and return her as the rightful Great Chief, I’ll leave the swamp never to return.”
“Son, I’d sooner tell you how we had you,” Howard told him dryly. Steve took a sip of his coffee before Tony’s responding pout and huff had him grinning like a fool, but then Howard cleared his throat, and everyone at the table turned to hear him. “So, what is it that you do, Steve? Tony says you write books?”
“No clothes in bed,
, he showed Steve everything. “It’s, uh,” he stammered while his brain reconnected to the server. “That’s, that’s the worst of it, I can, I think I can recreate the rest, maybe. But it—I have to send it to the printer tomorrow by noon, I—”
“Oh, no,” Bruce breathed just as Tony found it, too.
Tony was still giggling to himself when he took Mr. Perfect’s offered hand and slowly, careful not to put any weight on his right foot, pushed himself up. Or, more accurately, assisted Mr. Perfect in lifting him back to his feet.
Sarah had a sixth sense about movement or light in her apartment, so Steve lit their way with the flashlight from his phone. They grabbed two bottles of water out of the fridge, then made their way to Steve’s room on their tiptoes.
“The Notorious RBG,” Tony read off the cover with a pleasantly surprised smile. “Seriously? You come here for people to read to your dog?”
“We were thinking of you today, I wanted to say hello,” she explained absently, moderately distracted by the lives playing out in the apartment windows across from them. Eventually she grew disinterested and joined Tony on the couches where an opened bottle already waited for her.
“Again, squeeze,” Steve said in a dark tone, and Tony didn’t hesitate. He squeezed down on the hollow void Steve had left in his body. A good amount of Steve’s come gushed out of his body and over his ass, leaving a wide, sticky trail down to his lower back.
Steve refused to look at him, hunched in on himself and staring directly ahead over the steering wheel. Then, with a sudden jerk of the wheel, he swerved away from Tony and sped up, but Tony had had enough practice with steer not to be thrown. Dummy was tiring, but Tony urged him on, and god, just another two inches and he could reach the truck bed.
“But you caught me. Red-handed and too dumb to know better,” Clint added with an ironic but blatant pride. “I came back with Tony and dad after that. The rest is history.”
“No more than a prop,” Steve murmured to her as she stepped around to hold Sitwell’s door open for him.
From behind the cover of a falling body, one lone figured rushed at Steve in attack. Every punch landed with unwavering confidence, every kick devastating. In his surprise, Steve fell back on the defensive. For one, surreal moment, blow after blow forced him down on his knees. As he protected his face and his torso, he could see out of the corner of his eyes as the black-clad figures dashed off into the shadows with food and water clutched to their bodies.
Steve took a steadying breath. He wanted to move on with the investigation—he
Whether he was genuinely chastised or not, Howard knew better than to talk back.  He reached for another biscuit and the butter dish as if nothing had happened.
“Rough day?” he asked before taking his first bite.
“As you are,” Natasha said, and all the warriors rushing to the defense of their Chief froze where they stood. The Elder, who has turned in surprise to see what was happening behind her, was frozen as such, and even the Chief, with her own formidable reserves of magical power, could do nothing but kneel on the green and watch her betrothed climb to her feet.
Tony’s phone rang a little before 10am the next morning. The ringtone was new and distinctive, and loud enough that Bruce and Thor could hear it from their respective offices.
Life could only get worse for her.
Then again, nothing looked like it might break if he sat in it either, and for that he was grateful.
“One more wouldn’t be that difficult—”
“If it doesn’t involve math, eh…” Bruce trailed off with a wishy-washy gesture, doing his best to avoid comparing his friend to the common pigeon. “Just make sure he’s not holding anything sharp when you say it. Or a blowtorch. Or, you know, a bomb.”
The chief priest’s attendants did as they were told. Some held Ean by the ankles to extend his legs until his straining muscles of his thighs could stretch no farther. Others grasped his calves and his thighs as space allowed, immobilizing him until their pulling and stretching lifted Ean’s hips off the altar by their collective strength.
“He—he broke,” she stuttered hoarsely, her voice breaking and croaking around the syllables as if she hadn’t used her voice in many, many years. “He broke the curse. Clint did. I’m—I’m the one you’re looking for,” she said, repeating Stephanie’s words from earlier. “I am the Last Chief.”
“Wha—wait, is it only the first answer that gets the point?” Tony said with a little frown.
With almost no distance left between then, though, Tony didn’t look as suave and collected as he did from a distance. Up close Steve saw everything, how his eyes were wide and bright and so very focused; how whatever answers he found in Steve lifted his lips in a goofy smile despite obvious attempt to resist.
“Is this not too fast for you?” Tony wondered, searching Steve’s eyes for an explanation. “You won’t get tired of me three days in a row?”
A direct call came in for Tony from Q, but when Tony connected the call, it was Bond on the other line.
Tony eyed him dubiously, struggling to make up his mind. “...alright, you never heard this from me,” he finally conceded, “but maybe I am, a little.”
Steve took the pen, and with a last glance at Howard, he followed Tony’s lead, signing and initialling the document with care.
“Yes, sir. Yes, of course,” Steve agreed and started to retreat at once. “Thank you, sir—I’ll get it done immediately; today, in fact.”
She dangled the keys he wanted along with a pretty little pout. “Turned to ash in Brazil. But I have the keys?”
Steve stared at him for a moment, at a loss for words. “You’re… welcome?”
For Rumlow, the museum’s Hall of Violence was a home away from home. The exhibit began with the crudest weapons, tracing mankind’s violent history from barbaric clubs, stone axes, pitchforks, arrowheads, to the Western Colt revolver and the old reliable Thompson made iconic in the days of Al Capone.
Bucky glared up at the ceiling, presumably to stop from strangling Hammer. Steve stared back at Hammer straight on, wishing he could shut the schmuck up with the power of his mind. Inwardly, he wished Carter had been in the room to give the Special Agent a smackdown for such blatant disrespect.
“I know what needs to be done. I’ll be ready.”
The night of March 14th approached, and Tony still didn’t have a plan. No amount of bribery had worked, and while Annelise was open to selling it for five times the property’s value, but she wouldn’t sell before May after fulfilling all her current reservations. It wasn’t ideal, but Tony paid her a lump sum to stop anyone from making new reservations while he thought it over.
,” Steve growled as he lunged to catch up with his friend, dragging him to a halt so he could hide behind Bucky’s bulk. “Bucky, that’s him. That
“Tony, I’m tired,” Steve said quietly, a touch apologetic. “Between the junket this morning and the flight, I’m just done.”
When the bull bucked, Tony led with his thighs and rolled his hips forward, absorbing the shock like a rolling wave. The highest power setting had the bull twisting and throwing Tony so quickly it was all nearly a blur, but Tony rode out the bull with a natural grace to the wild cheering and applause of the crowd.
But instead of reaching to give Tony a hand, Tony watched through the mirror as Steve only repositioned his hand around Tony’s ankle to push his legs further apart until Tony whimpered and sobbed at the stinging tension. Through the mirror, Tony could see how this new position exposed his cock and balls only to better highlight their intentional neglect. Shame burned through him to see the lewd bounce of his hard, leaking cock and his drawn up balls, but he still couldn’t bring himself to look away.
“You’re fine, double-oh’s are temperamental. They’ve never killed an analyst before.”
“It’s so good to talk to you,” Steve admitted softly, gazing at him through his lashes and watching the interest in Brock’s eyes turn into lustful hunger. “We’ve barely spent any time together since we got here.”
The door creaked open, and both of them looked up. Finally, it was Tony who came in. It took him a moment to spot Steve and Bucky at the bar, but when he did, his face warmed with a smile and he made his way to them easily.
“Is that alright, or is it too cold?”
“You should have seen his apartment, he lives in the fucking penthouse! His custom island counter probably costs more than my car, but he doesn’t even cook. How much do book editors make?”
Tony couldn’t breathe. His eyes had rolled back and his back arched deeply to push his ass up for Steve, presenting it to him like a gift. Steve kept his ass spread and his hole exposed, but it felt like an eternity before Tony felt Steve lifting his kilt to free his cock.
“What’s the plan, after the movie?” Sharon asked in a blatant change of topic. “Are you finally inviting him over for the night?”
“I like kissing you,” Steve murmured, chasing Tony’s lips with a mischievous grin. Tony laughed quietly, pushing back against Steve gently, and continued to push until Steve gave in and rolled onto his back again. But when Tony didn’t follow through and slot his lips over Steve’s to resume the kiss, Steve whined before he could stop himself.
His look failed to make Natasha do anything but smirk. “Don’t give me that look, Stark. If you wanted it to be a secret you shouldn’t gawk at him in the middle of the newsroom.”
They took the tube to Blackfriars, and walked to what had once been the heart of the capital. London was once protected by city walls, and Ludgate street survived from a time when it had been the westernmost gate into the city. Food was the center of social life in those days, it was a part of the weekly routine that brought people out of the house to see familiar faces and good friends.
Tony must have looked as articulate as a guppy fish the way his mouth opened and closed without uttering a rotten syllable. Opened and closed, opened and closed, until Steve only snickered and rolled away to grab his phone off the nightstand.
“And Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson! Who is possibly the nicest man alive.”
Casual as he’d been with his wandering hands, the man seemed to realize he’d made an error and quickly held his hands up in apology. Still, Steve got to his feet to loom over him, and with a dangerous snarl, spat out, “Touch me again and I’ll break your wrist.”
“Is it your first time?” Steve wondered after a hesitant pause. “We come here so anyone struggling with reading can practice. Seamus listens, and he doesn’t judge. He won’t get impatient or upset if you need to go slow. Usually it’s twenty or thirty minutes at a time, but we can finish the hour if you like, I don’t think anyone else is waiting.”
so that the storks could have homes without interfering with the power lines.
Tony called his name, and still Steve climbed back into the truck.
“Paleontology?” Tony asked rhetorically, then shook his head. “I’m not looking, if that’s what you’re asking. I’m not interested in moving. Nothing beats this city.”
“Not alone you’re not,” Tony told him, and before Clint or Steve could get a word in, he brought two fingers to his mouth and whistled twice, two long, high-pitched notes. Dummy never seemed to be more than a few yards away, and the big grey horse came cantering from the side of the house with Tony’s bedroom windows.
When a kiss wasn’t forthcoming, Tony took a further step back. “Are you hungry? I’m about to have dinner, there’s enough for two,” he explained as he led the way to his kitchen. “Baked chicken, mac and cheese, some greens.”
On the screen, Steve watched as Tony clapped his hands over his face in an instinctive reaction to a sudden, genuine fit of laughter.
Tony pressed a hand over his heart in a caricature of scandalized virtue. “What look! I don’t have a look.”
“I would like that,” Tony murmured, only ever thinking about being coy long enough to dismiss the thought. “Especially if that jacuzzi of yours still works.”
Those casual days were Tony’s favorite, and today was no exception. There was simply nothing he enjoyed more than starting his morning in a hot bath, cradled by Steve’s body, while Steve doted on him. Unlike the (admittedly excellent) barber on staff, this time with Steve was a chance to catch up or prepare for the day, to steal kisses, and to indulge in a meditative, intimate start to their day together.
Tony tugged the neglected comforter closer to cover Steve as well as he could while still straddling Steve’s thighs. Some treasures he wasn’t willing to give up that easily.
“You know, that’s a great question. They do, in a way. The male giraffes use them to fight each other to impress the females.”
Tony frowned to himself and glanced at his watch. “It’s past 5pm, wasn’t school over hours ago?”
“Yeah, of course,” Tony agreed quietly, however uncomfortably. He was going to have some serious words with his mother. “That makes sense.”
“That’s not how this works,” Steve told him, then pursed his lips as he reconsidered. On second thought, he said, “That’s not how
A sudden tremor shook Steve’s body, and on instinct Tony quickly lifted his uniform jacket again for fear that such a coarse material had hurt the recently thawed skin of the Captain. But once he had a chance to listen, he realized the sounds the Captain made were not sounds of pain, but attempts to form a proper noun. If Tony didn’t know better, he would have thought he heard his name on Captain America’s lips.
“Cancel the call,” he told her as he took his seat, looking through the small stacks of papers and mail Sharon had sorted for him. “Move the meeting to eight. My attorney can wait. Did you call the—what’s her name? The one with the overbite?”
Steve huffed in amusement, and he couldn’t help but roll his eyes. “Yes, Tony: the rolls are happening. I already promised.”
“How much more serious could it get?” Tony asked, and try as he might, he couldn’t stop himself from chuckling nervously. “It’s, what? Our fifth day together, and you’re visiting my family. Steve, this is… insanely fast. You should be running for the hills.”
“Got my wallet, and my phone,” Tony said as he sipped down some needed coffee between his pancakes. “There’s enough stuff back at the ranch.”
“How novel. It can think,” he mused to himself. “Fine. Get in the truck.”
Tony blinked at Carl slowly, because something wasn’t adding up. Either his brain was short circuiting so late in the day, or Carl was not listening. Experience told him the latter was far more likely. Sure, the late afternoon interviews were a little worse after the compounded casual lunch-time and after-lunch drinking, but this was only their first day of promotions. It was only downhill from here.
to know more about Antonovich. But Tony was close to tears. He looked as miserable as Steve had feared he was on their first phone call. As urgent as his work was, Steve couldn’t leave Tony in such a state.
The rest of the day passed quickly and without added obstacles. As people noticed he wasn’t doing anything out of the ordinary, they started to lose interest in pointing and staring after him. By the time Steve and Maria finished their last class and grabbed dinner, they only had the six o’clock meeting with Hawley left for the night. Maria offered to skip her bi-monthly Feminists Against Capitalism meet-up to keep him company, but since it had all quieted down, Steve assured her that he’d be fine. He would just head over to Hawley’s offices early and get some reading done in a conference room before their meeting.
Tony’s lips curled in a wry smile and he opened his mouth to say something, but Steve got a hand up to gently keep his lips closed to quiet whatever self-deprecating or sarcastic comment he wanted to make. “Yes, you, Tony. Your brilliance, your kind heart. So, if you’re interested and free sometime, I would really like to take you on a date and get to know you better—a real date, without the team,” Steve amended before Tony inevitably teased him, then took the risk of removing his hand. “Just you and me.”
Brock hadn’t said a word in his defense, not a single word. Steve couldn’t believe it; the guy who’d been there for him through thick and thin for years, driving through hours of traffic in the rain just to get Steve his favorite soup when he was sick or staying up with Steve through the night when Steve felt too anxious about an upcoming shoot. What was it about this place that had turned him into such an unreliable asshole?
“And you’ll report back,” Sam finished for him.
Steve sipped his drink without saying a word, but he draped his arm over the back of Tony’s chair just to close the distance between them. Tony didn’t stop pawing at his arm, and soon his chest, and across the table, Bucky scoffed.
If Steve had a sentimental heart, it would have melted. “You mean you’re not sick of me?” he half-joked, earning himself a smack on the knee.
much better than that!”
“Good morning, Steve, congratulations on the film! Thank you for making time for our Award Season Mashup today. I know you’re heading out soon, so. Let’s get to it. It’s been a minute since we’ve seen you on the big screen, it feels like,” Josh started with a smile as he started the recording. “And then of all movies, you step into
“The same month you broke up with me, I was going to propose,” Steve explained sheepishly. “I had a whole plan, I was going to propose and give you that ring and ask for my dog tags back. But, it didn’t happen, and then I couldn’t part with it. I thought I’d keep it until I got over you then sell it, but that never seemed to happen, so I kept it.”
Sharon’s mouth dropped open at first sight of his costume.
“Here, take this,” Tony returned with a bag of frozen broccoli wrapped in a hand towel, and he gently pressed it against Steve’s face until Steve understood and brought his hand up to cooperate.
With a quiet rumble of laughter, Tony squeezed his thighs around Steve’s hips. “You always ride this slow?”
anymore,” he said through gritted teeth. “You’re the one who moved to Virginia.”
“That’s… great, that’s… that’s really great,” Steve muttered to himself. He put his cup on the nightstand and started to get back under the covers. He was definitely done with this conversation. “Good night, Tony.”
With a patient smile, he turned to the boy and asked, “What can I do for you, sir?”
Tony may have mumbled something like, ‘looks can be deceiving’ in reply, but Carol couldn’t tell because down below, the track suits started to come off. The soft string of curses that spilled out of him next were unintelligible but universally understood, and Carol pursed her lips to keep from grinning.
Tony rolled his eyes to himself at the thought of wasting another hour of his life in a meeting that decided who wrote about new car engines and who wrote about the most exciting upcoming hair transplant procedure. It was Bruce who looked out through the little window and glanced around the office.
“That was well articulated, Steve. Tony, how does that make you feel?”
Steve gravitated to him before Tony got very far. He was still talking to someone over the phone, but Tony could see him smiling at the tray, then at him, as if somehow Tony’s gesture had been priceless. Before Tony had a chance to leave, Steve muted the phone and reeled Tony in for a grateful, lingering kiss.
There were buttons for everything - for pushing his seat back, lowering the seat, and Tony talked him through adjusting the side and rear view mirrors. Even the ignition was a push start.
Rachel spoke so quickly that Tony barely caught on to what she was saying. He wasn’t sure if it was the sleep deprivation or if she was on something, but in a brief moment of lucidity, he wondered if maybe he should have taken Steve up on the offer to do this solo. Between the plane ride, his night with his handsome English lothario the night before, and the long days in New York before that, Tony wasn’t really firing on all cylinders anymore. Maybe it wasn’t too late to say yes—
Steve looked from the paper to the woman he considered his first friend on campus. For the life of him, he didn’t know what to say.
Steve blinked back at him, then glanced around himself to see just how many people with them on the tube had overheard the scandalous accusations. Luckily, only half the population of London was in attendance to throw unsavory looks of disapproval Steve’s way that morning.
“You have to admit, it would be a pretty smooth pick-up move,” Steve said with an impish grin. “It’s not every day the sexiest man in the bar randomly picks me out of a sea of people to be fake dating.”
He didn’t look angry. He looked miserable, and very guilty.
“Stark, your fans are the kinkiest, horniest, most lonely people I’ve ever known.”
He’d expected Tony to be asleep when he got back, but instead found him lounging in the tub. He stood there in the doorway without saying a word, watching Tony in this brief moment of peace. It didn't take long to realize that by the way Tony’s head was rested comfortably over a rolled-up towel, and the unusual stillness of his fingers draped over the side, Steve’s first assumption hadn’t been so far off.
Steve opened and closed his mouth, but no sound came out. He cleared his throat, but there was still a little tremor in his voice that told Tony he was on to something. “You can’t consent if you’re asleep,” Steve said, but somehow his statement of fact sounded an awful lot like a question.
Bucky leaned around Steve without breaking his stride. “That’s touching, but did you really just say ‘a cornucopia of fisting?’”
“As if that’s a threat, Rogers,” Tony said with a roll of his eyes. “How long can you hold this position anyway, two minute? Ten?”
“Can you blame me? Watching you work—you know how hard it is to jerk off in jeans and with cut-up hands?”
“Don’t objectify my best friend,” he complained indignantly on Steve’s behalf, to which Sam added, “At least not in front of us.”
“The practice of viewing films while driving a vehicle. Our self-driving conveyances are a relatively recent modification on the standard automobile, the technology is not thirty years old,” Tony explained as he led the way further into his apartment and offered Steve a place to get comfortable. “Would you like some water, Steve Rogers? I can also make ginger tea, or warm almond milk with honey and cinnamon. That was my mother’s favorite at the end of a long day.”
Tony swallowed hard, nodding uncomfortably in an effort to convince himself that Steve was right. “Yeah,” he agreed, though he clearly didn’t believe it for a second. “Yeah, right. You’re right. You will be fine, I will be fine. I will go there and do what we’ve rehearsed—”
Tony only managed to flutter his eyelashes before his heavy eyelids closed again. “‘m tired,” Tony mumbled on a weak breath. “You ‘kay, Steve?”
There was no way Steve would be able to merge his group with Tony’s. The way Tony interacted with his students was already making Steve hot under the collar, and distantly he could feel an abstract realization cementing into something very real and tangible.
Even with his eyes open the blindfold blocked out everything around him. Tony didn’t have a chance to question it before Steve even slipped something snug over his ears to block out all sound. Tony reminded himself that the students were gone and that Steve had promised the masters wouldn’t touch him again. So long as Steve was there, Tony knew he had no reason to panic - Steve would keep him safe, just as he’d promised. And now that his senses were limited to smell, taste, and touch, Steve made a point to exude more of his warmth so that Tony could feel his presence even from a short distance.
Tony pulled away from under Steve’s arm so he could sit facing Steve on the couch. As Steve straightened to return his attention, Tony took Steve’s hands in his and brought them to his lips, kissing the back of his hands one after another. “May we have this a little longer, Steve? We have the rest of our lives to give to duty and to our people. Can we have this year for ourselves?”
Tony rolled his eyes, but he finally gave in. “I think somebody needs a nap,” he cooed in a playful sing-song, kneeling up on the bed and straddling Steve’s hips to lean over him and tug on his zip-up. “Wanna take this off, gorgeous? You’ll sleep better.”
“One hour, tops,” Tony reiterated and slid his hand further up Steve’s thigh for a firmer squeeze. “Promise.”
Bruce wrote into their collective chat box.
“Bed, Tony,” Steve growled impatiently. “Now.”
Tony sat up straight in bed. Sleep had abandoned him entirely and he stared down at the dark phone in his hands.
“That was fast,” Steve said after a beat. “Where’d you get all that from?”
Tony was too good for him, and he knew it. If he stayed, Tony would be stuck with him, a man who had lied to him for so long. A man who was too scared, too insecure to ever be entirely honest.
and type out five little words: he’ll call you back later!’ But the bigger part of him remembered what week ten of a crash diet felt like, and that was the voice Steve tried to hang on to before he acted defensively.
“I might.”
“It’s kinda like bootcamp, but for the team. I can’t skip it, and I can’t bring you. It’s only four days, Tony,” he promised, not that it made any more sense now than the other times he had explained it.
Rhodey looked up from cutting the second rope of dough, presumably to ask about the ornament Natasha mentioned, but he was distracted by a sudden waft of whatever Steve was making on the stove.
When they returned to the tailor’s shop, they were greeted warmly and Steve was shown to the dressing rooms. Steve had expected anything from a tuxedo or a three-piece suit to a simple dinner jacket and trousers. Never in a thousand years had he imagined a kimono.
“But, he’s not normal,” Tony insisted. “He—he can talk about art and history and science, but he can’t talk about his family for ten seconds?”
“Told you.”
Tony perked up at Steve’s elbow, and Steve momentarily forgot about Howard to see what that meant. When Tony noticed Steve looking at him, he just grinned and said, “I’m pretty sure they own
His last order of business had been ‘accidentally’ ordering a mattress on Tony’s phone. Steve had been
“That wasn’t our stop, it was just the best stop cause you’re such an asshole,” Tony muttered to himself as he pulled out his phone to check how far Charing Cross was from Cecil Court. “Oh, we’re close. Five minutes.”
“I’m nervous of asking you this,” Graham said to Miriam through quiet laughter. “But don’t you have a similar story where you met an American man in Cambridge?”
DAMN AUTOCORRECT
“Turnips! My favorite,” the voice said, and Tony turned and stared. Stared, because there was a short, fat donkey licking eagerly at his plate.
“Steve?” he grunted softly with a frown on his face.
She gave his hand a withering look and only answered in one word.
“All the couples here match,” Sharon pointed out while eyeing Steve and Tony innocently. “So, what happened with you two? You used to be good with communication.”
“You look so happy in it, mein Schafes,” Steve admitted softly, and he watched Tony like his whole world was right there in Tony’s smile. “How could I not love it?”
,” Josh agreed immediately, and Steve sat up straighter in his excitement to hear more. “The way they tied Nellie Bly’s work in with today’s political climate, forced family separations—that’s not the movie we’re supposed to talk about,” Josh quickly acknowledged, and Steve burst out in delighted laughter. “But, the timing, and the writing, the performances, it was all so terrible and so good.”
“My mom liked Paris,” Tony said quietly, and while that seemed to make sense to Carol, Rhodey loudly cleared his throat.
“If that’s—whatever,” Tony said, all but throwing his hands up in defeat. “I wouldn’t say it like that, but sure.”
“I liked what you said,” Tony admitted in a whisper. “I wanted it to be true.”
As Stark turned to see Steve approaching, a glimmer of horrified realization flickered across his face before he could school his expression into an easy, confident smile.
He groaned inwardly at the terrible wordplay he’d subjected himself to, however true it was. Screw Superman, Tony wanted Steve, even if it meant abstaining from sex.
“Nope,” Steve said with a laugh, leaning in closer still to press a chaste kiss to Tony’s grinning lips. “Jealousy, envy, possessiveness, they’re all ugly.”
With his head still pillowed on Steve’s chest, Tony could hear his heart racing. He took one deep, slow breath, then leaned up on his elbow so he could look Steve in the eyes. The shock and grave concern in Steve’s expression were expected, but it hurt to see guilt so obviously shaking him.
Steve was going to be one of
His friend was nowhere to be seen when he turned around to find her, and it wasn’t until he was out in the hallway that he turned around and caught her handing Professor Hawley a file and accepting Steve’s resume in return for a curious sniff.
Thor downed the last of his stout and turned to order another. In the time it took to catch the bartender’s attention, he spotted a small group of young women at the other side of the bar.
Steve wasn’t getting away from him, not like this—not without an explanation.
Tony’s mouth twisted in what wasn’t quite a smile or a grimace. Steve’s words left a bad taste in his mouth, and he wasn’t sure what to do about it. As a crown prince and an only child, he had been groomed for his inevitable role as king, but there had never been a question about whose kingdom it would be, or whose style he would follow. Yet even Tony freely admitted that what he had learned from Queen Sarah’s example had made him a better man.
Bucky heaved an exaggerated sigh. “Since the dawn of man, when everyone
Tony blinked in surprise at the question. That was such a basic fact, and yet he wasn’t sure of the answer. Without thinking, he looked at Steve, and two important thoughts occurred to him. One, for all intents and purposes, Steve was the last person to save him on this one. Two, did he always look at Steve when he didn’t have the answer to something?
“Google it, dude. Turns out your loverboy’s down with the swirl.”
Tony’s face lit up with a sudden realization. “All the time!” he said in a rush, “for decades, now; you wouldn’t believe how many dirty come-ons people—I mean,” he interrupted himself quickly by clearing his throat. “Pepper, my agent, she’s been with me from the start, she has copies of everything. You’ll have them by tomorrow.”
From somewhere deep in his mortified soul, Steve whined, loud and plaintive, and face-planted in the crook of Tony’s neck, seeking comfort in his warmth. Privately, he indulged in the buoyant affection in Tony’s laugh, and the way Tony wound both arms around Steve’s neck and held him close.
“You just sit here, I’ll gear up, you’ll see, super safe. All good,” he promised, taking Steve’s free hand in his to press a kiss to the palm of his hand. He got up then, promised his brother it’d only be fine minutes, and led Dummy away to the stables.
Tony had changed since they’d arrived from the airport, and Steve couldn’t help but stare. After the mild fall in LA, Steve had enjoyed the endearing sight of Tony bundling up in multiple layers of thin sweaters and doubling up on scarves for the New York fall weather. But the Tony on the other side of his door didn’t look like the shivering little caterpillar in tortoiseshell glasses he had warmed to in Manhattan. He had blossomed into a handsome, devilish rogue in a black leather jacket, denim jacket, heather grey t-shirt, and dark blue jeans.
“Great!” Steve interrupted him with an air of exaggerated relief, then sat up to give Tony an impish grin. “So, Stark, was it? What’s your name?”
“That’s a great guess, Sumeet! That’s maybe why
“So long as you know I’m marrying you for you,” he said quietly, in the end. “That’s a lot of pressure you put on yourself, Steve. You didn’t have to buy us a house, my answer would’ve been the same if you’d asked me empty-handed.”
floor, unlocked the door to
“We could just let him get away with it,” Steve offered while peering up at the endless criss-cross of stairs climbing into nowhere.
“Thank you, Sparky,” he murmured against Steve’s lips, and when he leaned back, he was smiling up at Steve with a contagious, buoyant affection. “You know, I’m gonna miss you today. The lake was fun yesterday, with you. Can’t believe you’re letting me go alone today… think you can make it up to me when I get back?”
A slow, shaky inhale interrupted them for a beat before Tony composed himself. “Are you experiencing pain in your chest, Steve Rogers? Can you breathe without pain?”
Before them all, Ean and his twelve attendants made their way to the sacred stone where the newly elected Mayor of Marham, Torin Greaves, anxiously waited. Unlike the chief priest, this was the Mayor’s first ritual mating. As the elected leader of the town, the Mayor represented the people and their goodwill, and therefore had the most to prove to their patron goddess. His leadership affected the livelihood and satisfaction of every family in their peaceful township, and in the sacred rite of Imbolg, Brigid judged Marham’s Mayor before all her followers. If the Mayor’s sacrifice failed to impress their patron goddess, a new Mayor would be elected whose virility could satisfy Brigid and ensure her continued blessing upon Marham’s people and climate.
