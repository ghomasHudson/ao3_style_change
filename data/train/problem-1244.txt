"True, I don't want any misunderstandings anymore. I said 'no more songs'—I give you that—but…" Here John looked intensely directly into Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock could almost physically feel that look. "... I also said that they're great, yeah? They
,” he fixed Sherlock with his eyes, trying to convey everything he meant to say, and carefully pushed Sherlock’s shirt off his shoulders and let it slither to the ground.
The lump forming in his throat and the churning stomach contradicted the calm settling deep within his bones.
He had to do something. But what? He also had to be careful. Sherlock had made it unmistakably clear that he wouldn't appreciate any kind of physical meeting. He hadn't refused John's suggestion of staying in contact though. He hadn't exactly confirmed it either, but it was at least a tiny hole in the black curtain enclosing them. Now he had to try to shine some light through it.
“Because he isn’t. He could never be, Sherlock!” John took hold of Sherlock’s shoulder in lieu of his forearm and made him turn slightly to be able to properly look at him. “Greg is a friend. A good friend, true. But nothing more. A mate. He offered me his sofa, I took over his place and he somehow endured it.” When his deliberately light tone didn’t have the desired effect he added, “and just for your information, I kipped on his sofa for nearly three fucking weeks.”
What case could possibly include punctuation faces? Mysteriously murdered by wicked winky-face? Yep, that sounded exactly like one of John's ridiculous blog titles. Of course John would think it would be about a case. And actually it was about a case. John's case.
He gripped her hips hard. He was afraid that it would leave bruises even through the fabric of her skirt.
Sherlock instructed the cabby to drop them in a shady back alley somewhere in Soho John had never been before. There was only one door to be seen and Sherlock nodded faintly in its direction.
"I want to know you again, Sherlock. I lost you somewhere along the road." There was a silence, then a whisper, "I want you back, Sherlock." A little whimper escaped his tightly shut lips. He tried to muffle it immediately but wasn't sure if he had succeeded. He heard John swallow.
, thought John not without a certain degree of smugness. Out of the corner of his eye he saw that Sherlock’s cock had taken some interest as well. Even though Sherlock tried to stand still, he kept squirming under John’s hands. John suspected it was due to decidedly different reasons now though.
, John thought, trying to convince himself that he had regained some composure, but actually he couldn’t stand it anymore. He was, once again, fleeing from it. Shutting it down, burying this part of his past deep down in his soul, shut away in a gold-shot treasure chest. ‘
“Exactly that. And if he’s claiming to be the government he should care more for the wellbeing of his country and its citizens. Furthermore, he wouldn’t want a member of the royal family to get infected during her next visit to one or another dominatrix.” He flopped on his chair on top of his phone, dressing gown falling open, baring the entire enticing artwork that was Sherlock’s body.
“Uhm… Sherlock… you alright?” John asked hesitantly. “If this smells weird or something, I can go stand elsewhere to eat or… dunno…” He trailed of because actually he had no idea what was wrong. He would definitely NOT bin it now that he had finally gathered something at least likely nourishing just because Mr. Fancy-Food disliked it.
“Not so sure anymore.” John muttered quietly so that Greg could hardly understand what he was saying.
When the waiter called him “Here you go, mate!” he turned around and expected something of a hot dog like snack. Instead the waiter pushed a paper cup in his waiting hand, as if this was the most common thing to do, when sausage with bread was ordered. John looked confused, but he had no time to waist and at least – as he hoped – it was something edible in that weird mug he now owned. One quick look and he had confirmed pieces of something looking like sausage in a don’t-know-but probably-edible sauce and some kind of bread-roll sticking out of the mug. Very well then, this had to do! Throwing some coins on the counter he dashed out of the snack bar, hurrying after Sherlock, who had stopped at a corner, hiding and cautiously gleaming across the street.
Sherlock could feel that John had come closer. The fierce sound of his violin had muffled all other noise, but he could sense a shift in the air around him. As if the consistency had changed, like the charged air before a thunderstorm, like the smell of snow before it started to fall, like the warmth of home before one had even opened the door.
He wanted to get there, to be there. somehow it seemed vital. So he resumed walking and John didn’t resist.
“Who’d want me for a flatmate anyway?” John really couldn’t imagine anyone who’d be able to stand him for longer than a day.
There was nothing left. There just wasn’t. He was no soldier anymore, no surgeon. He had no family left, no real friends. Most of all, he'd lost the one person who mattered, his best friend, his partner. His love.
In this flood of memories others seemed to slide in from the side lines. One strand of thoughts plaiting together with another. Lacing, getting entangled, locking into each other. A whole chain of memories forming a path. A red thread.
"I love you." he said, plain and sure and unwavering, sealing it with a kiss on Sherlock's forehead.
Sherlock let go of John and took a couple of steps backwards. He crouched down and untied his shoes and threw them, together with his socks, carelessly to the side. He rolled up his trouser legs to just under his knees before standing again. He unbuttoned his cuffs and rolled the sleeves up as well. John watched, enraptured. There was a particular appeal to Sherlock’s forearms laid bare by rolled up sleeves of one of his otherwise impeccable shirts.
"Am I allowed to breathe? Or are you afraid I'd inhale him?" She had glanced at him, mocking him. Exactly the reason why he didn't want her around. How was this funny when he was nearly dying. She really was a cruel woman. And she didn't stop.
Sherlock started to make his way to the exit, nearly knocking his cup of tea over. "If you insist on wasting my time, I have no intention to…"
Nothing in his life had ever felt this right, like the way it felt to kiss John Watson. The first gentle press of John's normally unrestrained mouth, silenced by Sherlock's kiss, felt like a warm welcome; a 'there you are'; a 'finally'. It felt like coming home.
John felt heady, floating. Giddy like a smitten schoolgirl. His grin reached from ear to ear. Or even further, he wasn't sure.
He made a show from pressing the button with more force than necessary while still holding Sherlock's gaze.
"No. Not really." Greg shook his head before grinning. "Except for sleeping in and having breakfast till noon? Nope, no plans!"
The first thing John noticed when he arrived there was the chilly silence surrounding the club. The atypical emptiness of the street and the blatant lack of people were downright frightening. Where there had been busy bustling not long ago, now there was not a single person to be seen.
“Fuck! Sherlock…” John grunted, squeezing his eyes shut, holding even tighter on to the soft flesh under his hands.
“Yeah… and what it is, is shit.” Greg grunted firmly, aggressively gulping down the liquid in his glass.
” Jesus Christ, he had to get this back under control. He hunched over, pulled his curls. It was not okay. He was not okay.
John only whimpered and went back to preparing tea. He tried to keep breathing as normal, tried to avoid a fit of hysteria. He succeeded, close call.
He felt the weight lift from his lap, feeling the loss of their weight and warmth painfully and the cold empty air taking its place felt like a punch in his gut.
John was almost crushed to mush by an all engulfing Vampire Pirate Detective; or in this case rather a sleepy cuddly warmth-seeking Sherlock. The man shuffled and snuggled closer and closer in a way John didn't think was possible without melting into each other.
is the reason you can’t stay. But… you never considered that there might be a choice. A real choice.” Mycroft tried to take a step towards Sherlock, but Sherlock tensed up immediately and Mycroft shied away again. “Sherlock, when it comes to John Watson you might not have to choose
When Sherlock lifted his foot and the pressure on his cock eased, he sighed in relief. However it didn’t last long—big hands with slender fingers splayed and slid underneath the waistband of the denims. John watched enraptured when they glided over the curves of arse cheeks, over hips and strong thighs; as they revealed the expected suspenders, the straps holding the stockings in place; as they effortlessly guided down the trousers on their way.
“You didn’t disappoint me,” Sherlock said, almost as if to reassure him, but John knew it was actually to continue his story. “Even though you weren't an expert in the field, to put it mildly…” John thumped him goodnaturedly and Sherlock chuckled. “Still, you never judged me for what I did, even less deplored me. I think that’s also why I might not have told you about the full extent of my experience. Well, before this case started. And then… the more you learned, the more the way you looked at me changed.”
In the end he had totally lost it the moment Sherlock had spread his arms, letting himself fall, falling forwards.
that door still open, though? Didn't they slam it shut a thousand times? A long time ago? What was he waiting for? For the universe to stop being lazy. For the stars to align. For just one more miracle. Because John Watson loving him, wasn't merely improbable, it was impossible, so it could never be the truth. It wasn't just fear he was afraid of. It was dread. It was horror. He would never survive watching John Watson inevitably move on again.
Sherlock roamed his face with his eyes full of disbelief, as if he was seeing John for the first time. The big hands released the back of his shirt and moved trembling to his front. Hands open, fingers splayed, he laid his palms flat on John’s chest, watching with eyes wide of wonder, as if he was touching John for the first time. Hesitant as if he didn’t know if he was allowed to.
“Yeah…” An awkward silence followed and after a moment John silently continued. “Will you say hello, for me?” But he seemed to overthink it. “No. Actually… don’t. Just… bring him… that. Make sure he’s eating.” John’s voice sounded defeated, a bit breathless.
He waited. Shifting. Fidgeting. Growing impatient. Jittery. Feeling the time running through his fingers like the fine ivory sand from the memories of his youth... of the beach during campfires, lying on towels in the shadows, enjoying the view of the ocean in the distance and dark hair and blue eyes close by. Of tempting lips curled around a cigarette.
The cursor of John’s mouse hovered over the highlighted rows of letters and signs and numbers before Dutch courage took over and John clicked on it before he had even made a conscious decision of doing so. Still too drunk to care about the time of day or spend one thought on the volume, John leaned his head heavily on his hand palms, digging with the balls of the thumbs into his eye sockets until he saw stars. When he heard the first sounds emerge the little laptop speakers he grunted. Of course, what else.
Growling, Sherlock slipped back into reality. Still music, still same song! Sherlock suppressed the urge to cry out in frustration.
"Don't be ridiculous, John. But you could pay attention to basic metrical knowledge to not insult my ears."
“John, you have to know, no matter how this will go, because,” he looked up, met John’s gaze which held the warmth and comfort of an afternoon wrapped in blankets on the sofa, “I can’t promise anything, John. And not because I don’t want to, it’s just… I have absolutely no expertise or resources on how to do this. I’m not good at it. I don’t know what I’m doing and I don’t know if I’m doing it right and…” John held his hand a bit firmer, still gentle, still careful, but grounding. Sherlock took a deep breath and with the air leaving his lungs the words left his mouth, “It’s so very important to me. Will you keep that in mind? Please? Because the importance of something never determined the damage I might inflict…”
"And I told you I want to give us a chance. To move on. Together. We've both made mistakes. We're both flawed, God knows we are. But… that was then. This is now. Let us at least try."
"Shhhh…" he said again and Sherlock's inner turmoil calmed down, quieted, until he was able to relax into John's loving hands again. Would this ever stop? The anxiety? The dread? The guilt? Even in moments as happy as this?
“Colour?” He asked, retreating into safe territory. No need to prod and reawaken the rude prick Scott could be. Although, there was sure as hell
The music faded, the room surrounding him  felt quiet and John's mouth closed with a last fading syllable on his lips. He realised in horror that he had been muttering the entire time while listening. Apparently he had said things out loud. How much of it? Which parts of it? All of it? No, can't be.
Mycroft just nodded silently, because of course he was aware of that. He wouldn’t leave his little brother unobserved at any moment after everything that he’d gone through.
"I can't what?" John knew it was a bit not good, playing games with an unaware Scott. But he enjoyed every second of it.
Sherlock didn't realise the soft smile spreading on his lips. The corners of his eyes crinkled in affectionate amusement and his heartbeat accelerated smoothly as if lifted by a warm summer breeze.
He tried to breath regularly. He tried to calm his mind. He tried to rewind and replay and store the words in case John would change his mind again.
It looked as if this was important to Sherlock, and this was definitely not an one-time occurrence, John could tell. It seemed that Sherlock was used to going there and that this was where Sherlock retreated to for some sort of processing. Apparently John was not worth sharing this with. Sherlock didn’t want him there, that much was obvious!
His body was screaming, begging. His mind, too. Begging for food, begging for water, begging for rest, for sleep, for unconsciousness, for death. But he couldn't stop, could he? Nobody could ask that of him. None of this would provide a solution anyway.
bisexual.” John searched Sherlock’s gaze, who had started stroking John’s shoulders with his thumbs. Sherlock leaned forward, pressed a kiss against John’s forehead. The tenderness of the gesture flooded John with warmth from head to toe, helping to melt the icy guilt that had made its home in his heart since that time. John was certain that Sherlock did deduce what was going on; he was holding John in his arms nonetheless. Apparently he didn’t care. Or didn’t mind. Or was at peace with it.
He thought back to everything he had witnessed inside that building, out of reach now, deep dark waters flowing steadily and infinitely between them. He wished he could go back there, to those moments, turn back time! He would change so many things. Uncountable things. All the way back to their very first encounter. That though, was the only thing he wouldn't want to change for the world… meeting Sherlock. Meeting Sherlock had been the best thing that could have possibly happened to him. And he had kicked it with his feet over and over again. He had hurt Sherlock in so many ways he only now realised. 'I can't stand it anymore' Sherlock had said. John could see why. But Sherlock had also said 'It isn't your fault. It's all me'. Why did he think that? Just then it sunk in, that that too was John's fault. How often had he blamed Sherlock, for everything actually. Most of all the fall. Again and again the fall. This had to stop. They had to move on. Just not the way Sherlock was implying. Because… just look at them. They couldn't do it, not now. Not alone.
“Sherlock. Shhhh… don’t!” It should have been annoying to be shushed. John Watson though managed to make it sound soothing and actually reassuring. So he stopped. Waited. He felt his heartbeat slow down, the tightness in his throat ease. He understood. There was no need to defend himself, John already knew. He took this risk willingly. The only important thing right now was to explain. Because ‘knowing’ didn’t necessarily mean ‘understanding’.
After a long pandemic-induced hiatus, I'm finally back on track writing these Drama Queens. They'll take seamlessly off right where the last chapter ended. I'm sorry for torturing them, but rest assured all blue-ball-syndroms will be resolved.
His fingertips tingled when they touched the smooth wood his violin was made of. He let them linger for a moment, brushing lightly over the curves of the corpus. He hadn’t played in a very long time. Too dangerous, for exactly the same reason he had to play now. All his emotions were poured into it, he wasn’t able to hide anything when he was playing. He was one with the music. It was a give and take between him and the violin. When his hand was curled around the neck and the wood was warming under his skin; when the strings were tight and rough underneath his fingertips in contrast to the satiny ebony surface of the fingerboard; when the vibrations of the corpus were merging into the quiver of his own body. The taughtly tightened hairs of the bow brushing, stroking, guided by his unconsciousness, evoking a variety of sounds he wasn’t aware existed. It had been no help when John had been sitting in his chair, silently listening. Sherlock had been able to feel John’s gaze on his back
Most of all, did it make sense to be slightly happy about this call anyway and cling to a small "for now" as to a lifeline. No, it didn't make sense. Not at all. But here he was. In a life that didn't make sense anymore. And wasn't that the most terrifying thing?
Now though his fingertips seemed to search for a trace of warmth to banish the cold, not only from the bed. The palm and fingers of his left hand now rested calmly on the surface. What would it feel like to reach out and feel warmth where his own body couldn’t reach? To be able to feel the presence of someone else without seeing, without touching. What would it be like if the fingertips accidentally bumped against warm skin, able and allowed to stay there, to feel, to touch, to explore? Would his always cold hands be welcome or would he be sleepily grumpily scolded? He wouldn’t mind, he really wouldn't. That would be a very John thing to do. Sherlock smiled a small secret smile, for no-one to witness. What would it be he’d touch? A back? A chest? He had often tried to imagine John’s sleeping position. He probably was a side-sleeper, too vulnerable on his back, too immobile hence defenceless on his belly. His shoulder would bother him after a while though. He’d mostly sleep on his right side then, which meant he’d face Sherlock. Eyes closed Sherlock rolled onto his left side. He’d be able to watch John in his sleep until he began stirring in the morning. He’d be able to trace his features with a fingertip to wake him. He’d be able to examine the scar, just by look, because the sheet would slide from John’s shoulder in his sleep. Most likely he’d want his arm free from covers for action if needed. There’d be a whole territory for him to discover and explore and it would be all his.
Sort of caging Sherlock's arms in, John put his own arms in a similar position around Sherlock and inevitably brought their bodies flush against each other.
He tore his eyes from little John's happy face and let his gaze roam the room again. Drawers left open, missing books left gaping holes on the bookshelves only to lie on the coffee table still, even the RAMC cup John loved so much was still standing on the table next to his chair.
“You know, my days don’t revolve solely around calling a phone se…” He caught himself just in time, glancing around if any of the other passengers had noticed, but apparently he wasn’t interesting enough to eavesdrop on. A bit less shouty he continued, “I
He had to make John understand that Sherlock was a danger to him. He had to make John see him for who he really was. What he did. How could John possibly love and live with a selfish, self-destructive, John-destructive, spineless addict? He had nothing to give. All he ever did was take. He was a vile taker... He didn't want to be the vampire that sucked all life out of John.
“John…” Scott said again, stretching the single letters to their snapping point. “John…” in a different intonation as if trying the name out.
When he was able to breath again, he let himself sag against their bathroom cupboard, pulling Sherlock against his chest. The detective let go of John’s softening cock and wiped his hand on John’s trousers.
help us in some way. Without them I don't know where we would be right now. Although I'm certain it wouldn't be a good place." John swallowed. "I pretty much like the place I'm in." The corner of his mouth twitched into the smallest of smiles. "Although I'd like moving on from here even more. With you. Yeah?" he asked. Sherlock gave a short answering jerk with his chin.
himself. It hadn’t always worked, he had lost, got scarred, multiple times. He had always returned to the battlefield though, which choice had he had really, and had tried harder, fought better.
“What’s it to you?” John was a bit irritated now. However, if he was honest, he was actually rather out of his depth and confused; mostly about himself. Somehow he felt stripped bare by this man — and not in the way intended by this call. And somehow — for a reason unknown — he didn’t mind.
“No, actually not, I think...” he therefore said to not expose his oddly lovable Mister What-even-is-dirty-talk any longer, only realising too late that that comment might have the exact opposite effect. So he hasted to add, “... but not for that reason! Not because of...you. It’s just — I guess for now I got what I was looking for.”
The corset was decorated with metal buttons and refined embroidery and hung with solid chains. According to the theme of the arrangement a small sabre was hanging from a thin leather belt slung around that fragile waist, directing John's gaze to the perfectly pronounced backside by bouncing slightly against it. John began sweating the moment he discovered even a pair of ancient looking handcuffs fixed to a ring at the hip.
!!! They pull me through, they believed in me and this story. They are my greatest cheerleaders and my muses. Thank you, darlings! I wouldn't know what to do without you.
“You know what is childish, Sherlock? Using up all our shaving foam to marinade human lungs with it!”
it resonated in John’s mind like an annoying echo. Pictures of Sherlock running, rushing, turning like storm and thunder flashed through John’s memories. Sherlock a pained expression on his face, looking pale despite being obviously strained by this exercise and covered in sweat. Sherlock panting, out of breath.
“Yeah… yeah. You’re right. It wasn't a walk in the park recently. I’m glad that we’re finally talking about it though… became a bit an… elephant in the room, ha...” John tried his best to make it more bearable, most of all for himself. Reign in the beast of pain that threatened to break free. To be honest without telling the truth.
Suddenly, he was shoved back forcefully, painfully parted from the grounding and soothing warmth of Sherlock's embrace. His shirt fell to the floor. His blurry gaze was met by Sherlock's stern stare, eyebrows drawn together, brow wrinkled.
He took a breath, gently pushing Sherlock back; on the way pressing reassuring kisses on his cheek, his still closed eyelids, his forehead, his mouth.
"I know, sweetheart. Come on, I have an idea what to do about it." John grinned and took Sherlock's hand.
With that he steered an even more confused Greg back out on the streets again. In his coat pocket the folded piece of paper Molly had handed him earlier. He tried to hide his mixed feelings behind a mask of indifference while going back to trudging next to Greg without actually feeling like it.
“Don't see much begging going on here. Besides, no serious damage will come from waxing and my medical knowledge will not spare you the pain. I prefer to have some much needed tea." John countered.
When he had heard no answer from Sherlock, not even any movement or noise, he had looked up. He had lifted his gaze to Sherlock’s face and had been shocked at what he had seen there. Sherlock had looked bewildered, angry even, as if John had slapped him in the face, eyes narrowed. A desperation John had never seen on him before.
After he had stuffed the blanket into one of the big carriers they used for shopping, he had crammed the yesterday's sheets in, too, he sat on the sofa, warming his hands by hiding the mug of much too hot coffee. He looked at his phone and tried to hypnotise it into skipping time, into telling him what would be wise, into coming up with the perfect text. In the end, he had to accept that nobody would take this burden from him and picked up the phone. Approaching and reaching Sherlock had always been easiest by text, so that'd be the first course of action.
And that was that. It was the last time Greg had asked and John hadn't mentioned it either. He had called off the shifts at the surgery and at his tone Sarah hadn't even asked why. She only told him to take his time and that they'll cover his shifts. He hadn't worked much anyway since... since... he didn't want to remember the one day years ago when everything in his life had started to go downwards.
Sherlock could feel the warmth of the sun seep into his body and add to the burning inside. He tried to convince himself, this was how contentment and confidence felt like. Looking forward with certainty to a future he couldn’t see. But underneath he could sense a kind of yearning and desperation which he didn’t want to be there, which he tried to force away. But it lingered, smouldered under the surface, threatened to burn him. All over again. He wanted to douse it, to drown it, to blow it out and away. But he had to be careful. If it broke free into the open it could turn into a roaring fire.
“You don’t recognise it? Am I that bad?” John asked lightly, grasping for the chance to save what was left of the easiness he had felt before.
“Okay," he nodded, more forcefully than necessary even though it wasn't necessary at all. Because Scott couldn't see. Probably, it was more to convince himself that all this was really happening anyway. "We have a date then. You better up your game!”
"If you say so," he laughed. "Go on then, spill it. What do you want to know?" Prepared to give this stranger, handsome or not, every piece of information he'd ask for, he wondered what might be so interesting about his dreary little life. And was once again taken by surprise.
Still wondering why his senses played cruel games with him, Sherlock entered the kitchen and found it deserted. Even when this was what he had expected, his shoulders sagged a bit and he felt the stab of loss with a force that made him stumble the last steps into the kitchen.
Flashes of intangible non-memories. A very young self running through a forest, calling for something, someone, yelling, screaming until his throat was sore. A bit older version of him in back alleys, beaten up, sore for other reasons, in other areas of his body. A fairly recent Sherlock somewhere foreign, languages he faintly remembered, faces he couldn't place, different kinds of pain on body and soul.
Sherlock lifted his eyes from the warm amber liquor to the pale grayish-green eyes of his brother. Complimentary, Sherlock thought. Warm oblivion. Cold confrontation.
“So, give me your impossible foot then. Place it on my thigh here.” John patted his leg and Sherlock followed suit.
He couldn’t make out anything throughout this chaos of data let alone find a safe place for his new impressions.
He was lost in his thoughts, moving in circles, until the morning finally settled, brightening the sky with difficulty through the thick layer of clouds. He went back inside, made himself a cup of coffee.
a doctor - as are you by the way - and this is exactly why it was even more insane. But you know that I was afraid of the…,” nervously he glanced over at where Greg was still standing near the door. He looked a bit bewildered but obviously tried very hard not to overhear them.
was the only way Sherlock could express his maleness underneath all the other components and accessories screaming “woman”. As he had said, he liked the sensation of the fabrics on his skin, he liked the process and transformation of applying make-up, he liked the shape and aesthetics of the costume, he liked to dance… but nonetheless it had nothing to do with feeling like a woman. He didn’t want to lose himself while being Miss Pirate. And John wondered if Sherlock had gifted him with that lapdance back then to reveal himself to John, to make sure he wouldn’t miss it.
“Don’t know exactly,” John murmured, taking hold of Sherlock’s cock, pressing the pad of his thumb against the frenulum, rubbing miniscule circles that made Sherlock’s eyelids flutter. “Something about lace panties…”
Sherlock took the new mobile without comment. When he checked his address book there was only one contact listed—Mycroft. Of course. Sherlock weighed the phone in his hand for a while, eyed it as if it were a new nemesis, before he buried it deep in the chest of drawers underneath bed linens and towels.
John wanted to lean in, to taste, to devour that mysterious creature in front of him, but they kept their distance, always just out of reach but close enough to feel - breaths, the body warmth, the scent, the tension.
John’s confused gaze fixed on him up on the roof indelible, committed to memory, reflecting his own pain, his own desperation. Tears running down his cheeks. John trusting him, hoping and then disbelievingly realising the extent of the situation.
Reaching the end of his path, he braced himself for what he’d find. He had mentally prepared himself, he thought he’d know now. But when Sherlock finally came into sight, he felt his breath catch. He had thought about a lot of possibilities, he had thought he knew what to expect after the last experience that had left him shaken. But sure as hell he hadn’t expected this. He had to lean against the wall closest to him for support.
John needed a moment to let it sink in and nonetheless the only thing he could bring himself to say was: “Huh?” Looking confused at the disinterested woman in front of him he only grew more irritated.
John tilted his head; he had noticed it himself. Of course, he had. Still, he didn’t fully understand—neither his emotions and behaviour nor what it had to do with whatever Sherlock wanted to say.
I don't know how to thank my betas enough for their enthusiasm and support, for everything they do for me despite the awful times we're in and that are affecting our lives! They're going beyond the borders of what's humanly possible. My very own superheroes!
“Stop that farce, Mycroft!” Sherlock snapped. “This is absurd!! What would that even mean in this case?”
His foot picked up the rhythm, his heel tapped the dust, his fingers snapped accordingly. His shoulders, his abs, his whole upper body began to work to match his movement, forcing his spine into rocking motion. The muscles in his back contracting and bulging on either side of his spine, sliding underneath his skin, making it stretch and reminding him pleasantly of the boundaries of his own body, his transport.
" John sighed. "That's the required and obligatory protection gear during a fucking pandemic!  Most of all in cases of unknown cause of death. And
At first Sherlock didn’t move much and John  wondered if he maybe had changed his mind. But then he started tapping his heel in time with the beat and leaned slightly forwards over his bent knee towards John. His body minisculely rocking, absorbing the music, the little nods and shakes of his head indicating that he was sinking deeper into the pool of his emotions; that he was entering an area reserved solely for occasions like this. All the while he held John’s gaze, his eyes telling him
John got sick at the thought. He leaned forward, dropped his fork and took both Sherlock’s hands in his and held them tight.
Sighing, Sherlock dropped his gaze from the letter and his eyes fell on the thing, which had been wrapped in John’s letter, currently lying in his lap.
Despite everything Sherlock had hoped for which he knew had been nothing more than wishful thinking, he had never expected that it would be quite this dreadful. John had been so uninterested in all of Sherlock’s efforts - he had never asked, had never wanted to know - really know - about the why’s and how’s. He only ever wanted to go back in time. As if that were even possible.
As if on cue Mrs Hudson had said, “He is visiting me regularly. It’s never long though, I keep telling him that he doesn’t bother me, but he doesn’t want to hear about it. I’m still not sure where he’s staying.” She had raised her eyes, full of hope. “Do you…” But Sherlock had shaken his head without a word before she had even been able to finish her question. He had seen the disappointment clouding her gaze. “Will he…” she had tried, but again Sherlock had shaken 'no' as quickly as possible to stop her from continuing. He couldn’t stand to hear his own failures voiced out loud, mixed with unspoken accusations, followed by inevitable disappointment. He was already fretting enough about that all by himself, thank you very much. No need to add fuel to the fire.
There was a pause after the last text. Sherlock checked if he had written anything inappropriate, but couldn’t detect any faux pas. It was the truth. Were there any knowledge in the world less worthy of retaining than the mysteries of the universe, it would be that of the language of  punctuation faces.
"So," he cleared his throat, "let's try that again, shall we?" He waited until he was sure Sherlock was one hundred percent with him. Then said with emphasis, "Thank you, Sherlock Holmes!"
Her hips began swaying slightly, turning little frustrating circles, just not enough to mean anything, when she then lifted one leg and placed her foot high heel and all on the barrel next to her. It looked as if she had defeated and captured the barrel and John would have been happy to change places.
... in which a case comes up, important equipment is procured, various uses for hair trimmers are discovered and John Watson tries to support his partner as best he can.
Shifting on the sofa under a couple of blankets, sheets and covers to keep the night chills away, John tried to find a comfortable position. As grateful as he was for Greg's hospitality, he had to look for somewhere else to stay soon. Something permanent. And affordable. Probably not in London then.
Sherlock had to steady himself on the wall. He pulled his left hand free, he now realised was still trapped between the wall and John's arse, and all but collapsed against the wall; catching himself just in time, bumping his hand on eye-level on the wall next to John's head.
“Maybe not exactly ‘don’t want to’, but…,” John was searching for words, which made him falter in his approach.
“No, never!” He rushed to say, forcefully, desperately. “Why would you think that?” He knew his eyes were wide in horror. He drew his brows together; tried to make sense of any of that. “Only when Mycroft told me you’d…"
“This song though,” John said, still a bit out of breath, “well, it means something to me. At least, here. Now. Because...
John bawled and hiccuped and tried to breathe and wiped the tears from his cheeks which already started to cramp from the non-stop laughter. And all the while Sherlock stood motionless and wondered if he had woken in a parallel universe.
John tried to swallow but couldn’t; his accelerated breathing had left his mouth dry and his racing heart made it impossible to just breathe through his nose; as if he had just run a marathon.
The trimmer, which had finished its task on Sherlock’s scrotum at this point, went ignored and stilled in its progress the moment John leaned in and took Sherlock in his mouth. There was no room left in his mind for elaborated technique or a slow build up; he swallowed him entirely in one go until he felt the bristly stubble of the remains of Sherlock’s pubic hair against his nose. The head of Sherlock’s cock pressed tightly against John’s throat, restricting his airways and
But despite these thoughts John’s feet carried him inside, forced by the will to set some things straight, by curiosity and by something he couldn’t quite identify. The thought of Sherlock dancing hadn’t left him for the whole timespan of the last… god, it hadn’t even been a whole day. Felt like an eternity.
When he had returned in the early morning hours she had already been up. The moment he had opened the front door, the door to her flat had flown open and the woman herself had stared at him in disbelief. Her mood had shifted that fast between anger and relief that it almost gave Sherlock whiplash. She had stalked up to him, slapped him forcefully on his chest only to hug him immediately afterwards. She had stared daggers at him while pulling him along into her flat, holding him by his hand.
from here on needed to be different, better. But that was exactly the problem. Yesterday, after their talk on the phone, he had been hopeful that they’d figure something out to still be in each other’s orbit without coming too close, without losing their path, without losing each other. He had honestly tried to keep the promise to think this through and make a plan how this might look like in reality, how it could work without unnecessary damage. He’d have to rearrange his mind palace. It would take some time. He had mentally prepared himself for a long night of sorting and moving boxes and shelves and building rooms and wings. And then… the texts. The song. It had made all his plans collapse like a card house. Not that it had been built on very solid ground anyway, but now it was washed away like a sand castle after the flood. The mind palace wing which was filled with heavy and overflowing boxes of
“Really, Mycroft?” John gave a short and unamused laugh, briefly looking up at the roof, shaking his head in disbelief, then looking back at Mycroft. “I thought we both discussed that one already. A pretty long time ago actually What are you up to?” John turned in his seat to face Mycroft, frowning.
However, now there was no longer the need to hold on to this farce. There was no-one else whose reaction he had any interest in. Greg would be relieved though to be finally called by his real name. Although, it didn't matter because he'd never know because it would never be necessary again to call him anything.
“And when you’re dancing… gosh, I can’t even express that. In one way it’s so unrestrained and rough, the next moment it’s graceful, fluent of sorts and then again it’s… it’s composed somehow? The exact opposite? There’re so many layers to your dancing, Sherlock, I can’t even start to unravel that on my own.”
"Yeah, that's how it started. After that, we made use of every opportunity we got to see it as often as our time and our money allowed us. I would never have admitted it though, found excuses to avoid telling my mates, complained to my parents, sat in the seat next to Harry and sulked. But I went, you know? I went with her, every single time." He sighed. Thinking back, how utterly ridiculous it had been. And how much hurt it had caused.
He leaned against a pillar and settled lasciviously to enjoy the show. Since he had to spend his night here anyway, he could make the best of it, right? As much effort as the ladies on stage made to bewitch their audience, John’s thoughts kept wandering to one particular long limbed, dark haired, in velvet leather and lace clad Purple Pirate. He surprised himself in how little he was affected by the display of most seductive and saucy moves and dresses and undresses on that stage. They were enjoyable enough, but they all had one shortcoming—they were not Sherlock.
, John thought. He had survived Afghanistan to meet Sherlock after all. And then, there was the miracle of Sherlock coming back from the dead. So, he had been lucky at least twice…
Suddenly the rug beneath his knees turned into sandy coloured dust before his inner eye and he could literally feel the heavy boots on his feet and the steady fabric of his fatigues clinging to his legs. A long forgotten pain shot through his thigh, his legs buckled even though he was sitting steady and safe on the sitting room floor.
you desire?” Sherlock whispered and ran the tip of one finger over the lace along the length of his quickly hardening cock; his other big hand caressed his own inner thigh, long fingers brushing the bulge formed by his bollocks, reaching further backwards, tracing the seam that ran along his crease.
was the person who had put a bullet right through the big and precious heart of the most important person in John’s life.
” he yelled, internally cursing himself, but not able to act any other way. The smallest trace of a jolt on John’s features, but against all odds he took another, even if miniscule, step closer.
this happen! But what could he do? Get off the tube and go hide in some horrifyingly disgusting public toilet? Wouldn’t be exactly decent to go sit somewhere else, yeah? Cosy pub on the corner? “One beer and some nibbles, please. Oh yes, and some napkins to clean up the spunk after I get off with my phone sex date right here. Thanks so much.” Not a chance!
Was he flirting? He was flirting, right? It wasn't just a figment of John's imagination, was it? No wishful thinking… John swallowed. When he spoke his voice was a bit croaky.
he turned the term over in his head. When had he and Sherlock ever cooperated. The word tasted foul on his tongue.
“You know, I wouldn’t even put it beyond you.” And why for fuck’s sake did he find it even the slightest bit funny?
"Sentiment." Sherlock rolled his eyes, but the effect was ruined by the fond smirk playing around his lips.
“What do you mean ‘what do I mean’?” John lifted his head and frowned. Were they still talking about the same thing? A short silence followed until Scott took in a breath.
He ought to be packing right now. He ought to be preparing. At least, he ought to attend some boring meeting for a briefing he didn't care about. Because tomorrow was
He was almost sure he hadn't imagined the hitch in Miss Pirate's breath. He opened the door that led to the heart of the club and just before they entered the room to be engulfed by the other people Miss Pirate gave him a look that was a heady mix of excitement, adoration, trust, heat and love.
He smirked and knew he had won. He had melted the ice. And oh, wasn't that the most uplifting feeling he had ever experienced?
While wishing his mind to pretend, to lead him to the place of no sentiment, he glimpsed a dark spot out of the corner of the eye. That hadn't been here before. Definitely his imagination going wild then.
first of all: thank you for being here! For reading, commenting, kudos, bookmarks, whatever. Thank you!!
context it certainly meant friend in the worst way! Sherlock knew well enough what damage people could do, who pretended to be
Groaning internally he took out his phone and even if it was only 4.30am he dialed Mycroft's number and waited. He didn't care what Mycroft was doing; sleeping, eating, sitting in a meeting, or about to start a war. This couldn't wait any longer.  He hadn't to wait long until Mycroft picked up the phone. “John.” he greeted him as if he had awaited his call. Rolling his eyes John accepted that of course Mycroft would know. And therefore he didn't even have to mention his request before Mycroft continued: “I think it best you would come over here.”, and the serious and concerned tone in his voice stifled any of John's impulses to oppose. And he knew precisely where “over here” was: Mycroft's office at the Diogenes Club.
to gain more information to be able to deduce, therefore coming to a conclusion. John, I know you don't indulge in it yourself, but I would have thought you'd know my methods by now."
"Hi," Sherlock answered, smiling softly down at John; his own voice low and softened by an heretofore unimaginable amount of love he felt.
Groaning he opened his eyes again but didn’t even look at Mrs Hudson who peered through a slowly opening door.
But John couldn't help it; the corners of his mouth lifted in amusement and the chuckle turned into an affectionate laughter which he tried to muffle in Sherlock's chaotic curls.
John raised his head, looked at Sherlock, showed everything, saw everything. Deep regret. On both ends, equally.
Sherlock’s voice resonated in his skull like the whispered voices in a church. He felt pulled into a multiverse of madness. No end and no beginning, everything counts and nothing matters.
The brothers stood facing each other. Unspoken conversation bouncing back and forth, a trial of strength, a showdown. Neither of them wanting to give in, neither of them desiring to win the game. Just peace, Sherlock thought. That's all he wanted. Peace.
“Apparently, I am for this one.” Sherlock grinned. “Seems, none of the Yarders wants to go undercover for this one and there really is no-one as suited as I am. For once, the Yarders are more than willing to let me take center stage.”
John hadn't time to mentally prepare for Sherlock taking John's not yet fully erect penis in his mouth and sucking him to full hardness in no time. Sherlock didn't wait to move his lips, tightly wrapped around John's cock, up and down in an unrelenting rhythm. Hollowing his checks to increase the suction, pressing his tongue firmly against the underside, rubbing it over the precome oozing slit with every upwards move.
“Wait — No, not in a kinky way...” The words tumbled out when the implication of what he had said dawned on him. Quietly groaning to himself he wondered why he was embarrassed towards an employee of a kinky phone sex hotline. Why would he even care?
The next morning John awoke with a groan. He remembered a thing his father had always said… that sleeping with shoes still on would cause a terrible morning after. The shoes themselves probably weren’t to blame for the bad outcome of such nights but more the circumstances disabling him to take them off in the first place. He had an inkling what was the cause of his father's headaches in the morning though. Shoes still on his feet meant bottle still in his hands… The causality of the shoe phenomenon would probably animate Sherlock to do further studies to be sure of the cause-effect relationship.
“That’s what I thought... So, people truly come back for your glorious sex talk anyway?” John chuckled, somehow convinced the man wouldn’t be hurt by it.
Still, Sherlock would be able to decipher it under any circumstances. Hadn’t he studied this handwriting a thousand times and had a whole folder storing all it’s details secured in his mind palace. The notes in there may be a bit rumpled now, he mused, remembering the state of his John room.
was the only thing resonating in his mind over and over again, round and round like a turning wheel.
John groaned. Sherlock wasn't sure if from pleasure or pain until the grip on his curls tightened delightfully and one of John's arms circled his waist to pull him closer.
John felt vulnerable and small like this, left to wait what Sherlock would do next. Which was, to John's surprise, run his nose up John's neck from collarbone to hairline and inhale deeply. A full-body shudder took hold of John; he couldn't help it.
As if alarmed Sherlock suddenly threw himself fully into the music. It made his curls bounce with every agitated strike of his bow, with every high-pitched note, chased by the relentless beat. It was as passionate as his dancing and John could now see that it was and had always been the same thing. Sherlock bursting from emotions with no other way to express them.
“What? I thoroughly thought ahead and ordered everything we’ll need for the upcoming period. All our needs will be satisfied.”
They strolled through the club; John never leaving Miss Pirate's side, never letting her out of reach—quite literally. They talked to a variety of different people all of which John didn’t know. It was also difficult for him to estimate to which category each one belonged—mere visitor, an interested party aka a potential… client, but then not their usual kind of client, or a… colleague? What were they even called in this line of work? Work? That sounded so decent.
In high spirits and with high hopes, he set out for the start of the rest of his life. He had decided to take the bus to Victoria station and walk the rest of the way. He took his time, to calm his mind, to clear his head. He came through St.James Park. He loved to watch the ducks there and to sit on one of the benches, thinking back to the moment when he had tried to tell Sherlock that he was one of the two people who had turned his life around. That he had done the same for him as Mary had when Sherlock couldn’t. But then… Sherlock had been the first! Sherlock was the first, his first, so many times and in so many ways. Only, the git hadn’t even waited for John to finish his sentence and had vanished into thin air. So typical, always avoiding the emotional bits, but not today. Today he’d have to listen. John leisurely walked past Covent Garden, enjoyed the sun on his face, the relaxed early summer buzz in the city. It was morning still, not holiday season yet, London was enlivened by Londoners. John let his gaze and mind roam, seeing Sherlock and himself at every corner, past cases passing his memory. The swelling noise of traffic and the chatter of people, footfalls of slendering or hurrying passers-by, an occasional dog, a lost seagull, the bell of a bike rushing past him. The smell of the first cafés opening, serving breakfast and coffee, the inevitable car exhaust, the underlying London typical mix of nearby water and millions of multicultural lives lived. All of it caused a feeling of safeness within John, a feeling of comfort. Of being home.
The moment John stepped outside, blinded by the sun the first few seconds and hit by a wall of not yet to be expected warmth, there were two things happening at the same time. From the one side a very typical three-tap-footfall made its way up the pier. On his other side he heard Greg appearing from behind the boat.
Confronted with Sherlock on his hands and knees, wiggling his back side in front of his face, he gave up all hope of this to be any easier. He took a deep breath and succumbed to his fate. The same ordeal of skin on skin combined with the slick and slide, the heat and shivers was as much a torture and challenge to their restraint as before. The sizzling tension sparking in their touch heightened by the not yet removed hairs prickling the over-sensitive soft skin of John's palms.
When their lips met, John's knees got wobbly for completely non-alcoholic reasons and his mind blanked out caused by a totally different kind of drunkenness. One more difference: he'd absolutely never forget this.
Sherlock moaned, turning his head desperately from side to side on his pillow, his cock oozing precome and pulsing in its abandonment.
The inspiration for Greg's boat comes from Rupert's hilarious movie "Swimming With Men", in which his character lives on a houseboat, too.
John had admitted that he only had that blog because of Sherlock in the first place, right? So it wasn’t actually just Sherlock who had been caught secretly pining for his flatmate… Sherlock smirked.
John, with the reaction period of a stone, or rather an entire mountain, was still glued to the spot, Mrs Hudson tried to get a response after all, "John? What happened?"
Bending down full of relish she reached for it, the lace of her shirt hindering a glance at her decoleté just so. She leaned so deep that her backside was revealed to the back of the stage, teasingly out of sight for everyone, reminder of her lace panties. Raising again, propping the hat back onto the silky curls, she cast a seductive little glance at John from under her long lashes. She snapped her hips to get her skirt back in place and with just two steps backwards she grabbed behind to get hold of the dancing pole.
“It’s just… I hoped that there'd be no need to make this more complicated than necessary.” Sherlock said while he measured his steps to John’s shorter ones. Both watching the ground beneath their feet. “I… I just…” He stopped again, mere metres away from the bench. He looked at John and scanned his face. They stood close enough that John could see every line on Sherlock’s face. They had become more and deeper. His face told the whole story of a whirlwind of a life. He looked tired, drained. He looked the way John felt. They both were a mess.
“No, you're right. I didn't." Sherlock confirmed a bit more earnestly, even though the boyish glimmer never left his eyes. "Not when you inherited that role and you seriously meant it." He watched John for a moment, roamed John's face with his eyes.
Passing Sherlock, John suddenly addressed him. Sherlock hadn’t been sure he had even been aware of his presence.
Relishing the moment, cherishing every single button and every bit of newly revealed skin, John felt the warmth and excitement and giddy happiness from earlier return and he automatically resumed humming what had come to him out of nowhere but now seemed more fitting than anything else.
John was in no way surprised that Sherlock had fallen back to relying on someone else's words. Sherlock was even worse with words than John himself. What John heard though was only confirming what he had suspected.
It didn’t matter. Not anymore. Sherlock was back and nothing had changed the way he had planned. And now there was this. A cryptic question which meant nothing according to John and was important nonetheless…
Barely able to hold himself back the man in front of him asked: “Wanna see some more?” John could feel him nearly bouncing on the balls of his feet. It was endearing.
Bare arsed, hair in disarray but clutching his clothes in front of his crotch he remembered his phone, still mute and screen black, lying on the coffee table. He had to charge it, at least a bit, otherwise he had no connection to anyone at all and he sensed that he might need that.
"No, you're right. That isn't all of it. It's actually about what came after." John sighed defeated. Sherlock still held him close, brushed his nose through John's hair, let one of his hands wander over John's back.
He didn't yet dare to love John with everything he had to give. He'd never forgive himself, would never be able to live with it, if he'd ruin it, if he'd break John Watson.
Feeling the sting of pain on his scalp some of the fog in his mind started to clear up. He tried to assemble all the loose flittery snippets of his impressions to form a bigger picture. Then, suddenly, he wondered... where had Sherlock even come from? He had been well dressed, well groomed, well nourished… at least for his standards… so he had to live somewhere equipped enough to make that possible. No bolthole, no homeless network, no Wiggins would be able to achieve that. As realisation dawned he could barely contain his fury. An angry outcry and a fist hurt from punching a wall later he fumbled for his phone. Mustering all his patience he tried to calm his thoughts and come up with a plan for how to proceed.
“Don’t be afraid to say whatever it is. It can’t be worse than not saying it.” John kept up his slow caressing of Sherlock's neck, sometimes brushing his fingertips into the curls with an upwards stroke.
“Well, yeah.” John huffed. Really, only Scott would be able to make a shift from temptation to toddler in a nanosecond.
His memories drifted back to the first time he had been here. A totally different occasion; but causing similar confusion. He had followed hot on John’s heels, who had back then left in probably the same mood as he himself had been in today. In the end, John was taken here to meet up with someone who technically should have been dead, too. What a very fitting choice Sherlock had made to make this location his place to be, back from the dead.
“Very good.” John purred and was surprised by a quiet, apparently held back whimper on the other end of the line. Hmmmm, now
John hadn’t expected the laugh the woman huffed out. She quickly caught herself though and cleared her throat.
Oh, fucking hell!! Watson! Who said anything about him being attracted to you? He’s a fucking sex line operator!! And you’re one of a million, goddammit. And considering the whole thing had been a one off experiment anyway, he had no intention whatsoever to get in contact with that Scott guy ever again. There was really no use to keep thinking about him. This was futile and laughable and not Watson-worthy! He was a soldier, for fucks sake. And a doctor. He didn’t do this sort of thing. This had to stop. Now!
, he made his way to the door they had come through earlier that night intending to get out of the cursed club.
“Git.” he countered affectionately, as was their habit. It felt good to have things being ‘theirs’ again. Not long ago John had thought he had lost that for good. Sherlock grinned at him as if trying to erase that memory.
And yes, Sherlock had needed to hear all that, too. However, it had only scratched the surface. Sherlock seemed to accept or even have never doubted John's loyalty, John's support, probably not even John's feelings towards him. The real problem seemed to lie much deeper.
"John…" he leaned slightly backwards, sitting on his heels. He wanted to say something but was cut short by the intensity with which John held his gaze. The silence stretched and for a long time they were only watching each other, studying each other, absorbing each other's sight. Connected by their gazes alone but bound with everything they were.
Sherlock’s hands stilled, his shoulders sagged. He was silent for a moment before turning his head slightly and glancing back over his shoulder at John.
Sherlock sat up properly now and studied John's face. John could see a defensiveness coil in those stormy eyes he didn't really understand. Hadn't he just confirmed how much he valued Sherlock? To his surprise Sherlock's voice was more restrained and intent than before when he spoke again.
It didn't make sense and at the same time it did. Searching for the source of the music John discovered the device lying on the ground, blaring, a pair of headphones not far from it, torn as if ripped off with force.
Of course, he had known that there were much more emotions – a soft core so to speak - under that hard shell Sherlock had shown. More than the man himself would ever like to confess.
He could remember dark clammy back alleys, he could remember gaunt faces with paper like crumpled skin. He could remember sore feet from walking miles on end, he could remember unfamiliar corners and streets. He could remember thirst and pain and violins.
After a while, John had to lower his heels back to the floor, which broke the kiss and gave them the opportunity to get some dearly needed air. Both panting, their gazes locked, John could feel the mutual agreement; they were in this together. No need for caution, no need for anxious mood swings. No need for doubts the other would change his mind. Together meant… well… together. As one. Sharing their lives, not hiding.
"Look, it's the middle of the night, yeah?" Greg shifted his position, hands on his hips. He licked his lips. "Just past midnight which means technically tomorrow." He nodded in John's direction. "Do it John, what are you waiting for?"
“Yeah… yeah… of course!” John hurried to defend himself. “That was not what I… No. No, I didn't mean…” he huffed. Shaking his head a bit he chuckled and looked up at the man.
She took a side glance at Greg who was poking his finger in some undefined tissue on Molly's section table.
have a particular kink for fish, neither the  smell nor the looks. Although, he would have liked to meet the make-up carp… No, but honestly… oyster? Freed from their rough shell, fresh, pure, extravagant, luxury and… naked. Hmmm, that didn't sound too bad…
He stared up until his eyes began to water… from the chilly night air. He shivered a bit, went inside to pick up his coat and scarf and settled back in his former spot, wrapped both, coat and scarf, tightly around himself and leaned his head back. He retreated into his mind palace, entered the planning office of the mission and tried to review all the available facts. Because he didn’t want to know, but… he wanted to know. He couldn’t prepare himself like this. Although, he didn’t even know what to prepare for. Prepare… his eyes popped open and he scratched the back of his head on the cracked bark of the tree when he hastily sat up. He looked around and was surprised to see the first wisp of dusty pink along the horizon. The star constellations were hardly visible anymore and he felt a strange kind of melancholie spread through his chest at that realisation. His legs and back felt stiff, his bum was numb, cold and damp from the morning dew slowly creeping in. He stood up, straightened and stretched his limbs and back and cracked his neck.
But after the disappointment he had seen on John’s face when he had found him in that drug den a month after the wedding… John was never supposed to see him like that. Why had he even been there? Why hadn't he stayed in his boring suburb home with his boring mid-range car with his boring pregnant wife (who turned out to be not so boring and not so pregnant after all) … in his boring without-Sherlock life?
Not much later a fuming Sherlock threw open the door of 221b and glared daggers at John as if he was the cause of all the misery.
Blown away, although not literally, by the sheer amount of options John scrolled the seemingly never-ending list of phone numbers. He read about horny housewives and greedy grannies and his motivation as well as some for the intended activities crucially needed body parts were shrinking more and more the longer it took. He was about to abandon the idea all together, when he spotted a small ad squeezed into the lowest corner of the currently opened website.
He heard some noise from upstairs. Carefully climbing the seventeen steps up to 221B he realised that it was music, from John’s upstairs room. It sounded familiar, but he was too exhausted to try to identify it. Would this become a habit now. Being greeted by roaring music, making any conversation impossible? Was this John’s new tactic to avoid him?
Now though he understood. Ballet. That had been what had fascinated Sherlock. Ballet, rebelliousness, drama... he was a drama queen after all. John smiled fondly at that thought. But at the end - and John shivered at the memory - the main character, the dancer, had committed suicide. Torn between the love of her life and passion for her profession. Dancing, which she was brilliant in and which she felt being made for. She couldn't stop, not even for her loved one, not even although she knew it would ruin their life.
Not that he wasn't familiar with stress relief wanks, hot fantasy wanks, too long without date wanks, boredom wanks, all sort of wanks… everything but! Sherlock probably had a whole spreadsheet about his wanking habits… John grimaced… no, not going there now, not good, bit not good, very much not good… too late.
As John didn't see Greg anywhere inside the boat, it would be really hard to miss him in this little space though, John suspected the man to be on the terrace lazily sunbathing. He was surprised to find it empty and curiously made his way outside. No plans, Greg had said. Surely he wouldn't waste his day off on errands? Maybe meeting Molly? Or a friend? Or out with his kids? But mostly, in that case, he let John know. Just so John wouldn’t wonder.
It was heaven, to feel the weight of Sherlock pinning him down and in place, where he belonged, their bodies still connected. The wetness between them was quickly cooling, but neither of them cared, caught in the warm slide and caress of their lips and tongues.
Cold, emotionless, determined. Only now John dared to look at Sherlock’s face and what he saw there, shook him to the core. Absolute aloofness, isolation, indifference.
“We’ve done this before, remember. I didn't handle it well back then either. You know why I was that furious when you came back? That was the reason. I was so hurt that you had left, I was so happy to have you back, I was so torn between the past and the time ahead, I felt so much, I couldn’t place it or understand it.” The tumult of emotions seemed to untangle a bit, the eyes observing him were a bit more scrutinising. “I lashed out, too. I was afraid, too. I’ve almost lost you back then. I’m not letting that happen again!”
In all the hurry he had forgotten, that the last time he’d been here he had left this place still dressed in his sweaty shirt. And he didn’t bring a new one. The other one being forgotten and still thrown over the chair in his bedroom.
"Sherlock," it was only a whisper, barely audible above the background noise. But it was more effective than any yell could have been.
“But… why?” John was still puzzled. They had both seemed so… blown away by each other. John had to confess though
Sherlock’s arms dropped to John’s shoulders, his hazy gaze now rested on John’s face. He snatched his own shampoo, copied John’s actions and… God knows, John had taken countless showers with no idea how many people before, but… it had never felt this good.
“Well in that case, they definitely should have.” John had sighed and hoped that they were done with nonsensical discussions — at least for now, until the next one came up.
,” the man purred, lasciviously. Christ, that fucking title really hit its mark every single time. And apparently, Scott damn well knew that. Of course he did, as evident in the clearly audible smirk blending into the heady temptation that was his voice. “You just deprived me of my last piece of clothing,” he poutily complained now. “And if I recall correctly,
