Oh, Lucifer turned him that way. Got mad or something. I’m thinking that’s why this little peeper’s out of the Empty, huh bud?
Would give you all the information you wanted if you were actual feds. There’s no way that Dean Winchester, self-proclaimed monster hunter and definite psycho is in any law enforcement.
Uh, you gonna wash that jacket or what? Why’re you still wearing it?
Sam’s hunched over some books reading through them, his laptop opened behind them. Dean walks over and leans over Sam’s shoulder.
We’ve been in this situation before. A goodbye.
INT. MEN OF LETTERS - WAR ROOM - DAY
Well apparently, it’s not.
Remember to let him under your skin,
For me, yes.
Sam looks between them, confused. He had no idea. Dean just looks away guiltily. He really didn’t want this memory, not ever. Especially after what happened with- C-
Cas was surprised at the huge wedge of disappointment that stabbed through him. But Sam had said Dean was single?
“A bit sore, but this is how I always sound.”
“Was that my car?” Cas guided Crowley into the seat with a hand on the top of his head.
“Well, it doesn’t hurt.” Dean shrugged.
Dean’s lawyer piped up. “Assuming we accept this arrangement for Sam Winchester, there’s still the matter of an agreement regarding my client.”
“I was at the airport dealing with another target, when I saw him by accident. I’d vaguely heard there was a contract on him, but he didn’t have protection. Lucky for me. Him, not so much. Doubled my money on that corrupt Asian motherfucker. The single most awesome shot I’ve ever made in my entire hitman career. 300 metres through a window barely the size of a little ass cheek. Pow. Hey, I thought you knew I was the one who popped him. Although, now that I think about it,
Dean threw his arms up with a huff. “Bitch please!” Hands on his hips, he turned to face Gabriel, who tossed him some handcuffs. “Put these on.”
“Bust a cap? Who are you? Samuel L. Jackson?”
Cas nodded again, still looking a bit shell shocked, but turned to his tray. He took a sip of the steaming tea, humming as it soothed his throat.
Cas made a boy scout salute with his hand against his leg, which was his full range of movement. Rasputin glanced at it.
“So, you knew they were out there and yet you still felt it was important to deliver whatever the fuck that was to your brother?”
Dean bent over with laughter as he got in. Cas slammed his door, disgusted. It didn’t help his mood when all the glass shards showered over him. “Jesus fucking Christ.” He brushed off what he could.
“Dean, please. Need you. Want you so much.”
“We post in there, A LOT. You’re free to scroll back up along if you want, but there’s YEARS worth of stuff there. Up to you. And now you’ll have everyone's numbers too. Easy peasy. You’ll meet the other chat members tomorrow night at Dean and Sam’s.”
Cas undid the ribbon, already knowing it was a hard backed book through the wrapping paper. He ripped it open, turned it to the front, placed it on the table and just stared at it.
Dean blushed furiously. “So you did hear that. C’mon, you already know how much of a creepy stalker I am, Cas. This cannot surprise you.” He looked to Cas, hoping that little revelation hadn’t fucked everything up even more, revealing how much of a sap he was in private.
“What? Fuck off.” Cas stared at Dean, absolutely not believing him.
Zach snapped back at him, throwing the folder to the table. “I’ve come for my money. I delivered as promised. I gave you Dean Winchester as exposed as you’ll ever get him. Small security detail. Practically a rookie leading them. I can’t do more than that. Let’s be fair here.” He held out a pen to Chuck meaningfully. Metatron turned his gaze to Chuck, a slight smirk on his lips.
“Oh no no, these aren’t bumps, no no. No bumps. Just one dead Japanese arms dealer.”
“Nope. Dean Winchester.” Dean stepped back to allow Cas into the house. “Well, there are no words. I am amazing.”
“So, is Gabriel the only photograph worthy person in your life? No significant others or anything?”
“Cas, hey, stop, it’s me, you’re safe.”
He ran his fingers through his hair and heaved a big sigh. He was here already, and the time entry slot would soon close. He should just go into the haunted house alone to try and get into the Halloween spirit. There were kids here, it couldn’t be that bad. And it was Friday night after all, with Halloween itself tomorrow. His usual Friday night in front of Netflix suddenly didn’t feel so appealing.
Alastair spotted Cas in the rearview mirror, his face twisting in hate. He barked another order. The driver immediately hit the brakes. Having anticipated this, Cas smoothly turned the bike, and made his way along a narrow pedestrian bridge. An Interpol car wasn’t so lucky, quickly smashing into the back of Alastair’s vehicle. All the other vehicles in the convoy hit the next in turn like dominoes. Dean heard the commotion, turning back to see Cas glide over the bridge. Dean grinned widely.
Dean squeaked, then bucked with a loud whimper. Cas could feel Dean’s cock twitching between them at the comment. Cas licked and sucked down Dean’s neck, taking his time. Dean fumbled with the top of the lube cap so much that Cas took it from him, coating his fingers to work himself open while he attacked Dean’s nipples with his mouth.
“Jesus Christ! This is who you want me to protect? Just look at my shirt!”
“….the depreciation is so much…”
They could see Cas in the passenger seat through the windscreen hole. He held up his hands in surrender. He opened the passenger door which abruptly fell off its hinges. “Shit!”
“And the…? Beautiful.”
“You know, people don’t like to be forgiven for shit when that implies they did some shit to begin with.”
Charlie smiled knowingly and leaned in to him conspiratorially. "Listen closely my young Padawan..."
All the fight was immediately gone from Cas, as he could see the depth of hurt and pain in Gabriel’s eyes. Gabriel snapped out of it first, fuming, pointing to a hallway door. “The transport is in there.”
Dean almost managed to keep a straight face. Almost. But he just couldn’t help himself. After a few seconds, he broke into a massive bout of laughter. He doubled over, clutching his stomach. He wiped his eyes, drawing in a breath before he could speak.
He dashed outside the room to answer it without looking at it.
Dean crouched behind a car, returning fire. The Interpol agents joined in with the shooting.
She quickly grabbed Cas around the shoulders, pulling him down to her level, coming next to him. “Say cheese!”
“In the alley, there’s two gentlemen who may require some counselling.” These two guys were thrown unceremoniously into a dumpster, cable tied, one on top of the other, top to tail. Cas had closed the lid with satisfaction on their screams.
“Yes, a bit.”
“You think it’s fair to want something for nothing. In my country, we would skin you like a cat.” He really twisted in the pen, bringing Zach to his knees. “Would that be fair?” He slowly pulled out the pen. As soon as he was free, Zach cowered back against the wall, cradling his hand, whimpering. Chuck walked right into his space as he continued speaking.
Dean kept unblinking eye contact, slowly getting up with a serious face, making for Cas with grabby hands. Cas yelped, darting into the bathroom, locking the door behind him.
Dean chuckled, removed both trays, frowning at the small amount Cas had managed to eat. He’d have to feed him properly tomorrow. Dean locked the door and stripped to his boxers. Since the room didn’t have any windows, he left on the dim light, and set an alarm on Cas’ phone. Dean frowned at Cas, who was still sitting up. He reached under the blankets and pulled on his legs until Cas was lying flat. The dude didn’t even flinch. Rowena made some good shit.

“Fine! Geez! This is almost as boring as the time you were protecting Patrick Buckley in Berlin.” Dean crossed his arms and sat back with a huff. There was a moment of expectant silence.
“I won’t, sir.”
Dean grinned widely, gently turning Cas on the spot so Dean could grab his hips from the front instead, pulling Cas in close to him. Dean looked at him with an ‘Is This Okay?’ look. Cas nodded, biting his lip, as Dean began moving Cas’ hips against his. Cas was already wide eyed with a dry mouth, allowing Dean to guide his movements. Dean pulled Cas’ arms around his broad shoulders, which Cas couldn’t resist rubbing along, staring into his eyes. He wasn’t able to see the colour in the dim light, but they were laser focused on Cas, accompanying a soft smile. Dean was slightly taller than him, and leaned down to rest their foreheads together, deepening the eye sex as they swayed together.
Cas stared at him hard for a second, face crumbling into a soft smile. “You know, he’s gonna be right back with those cuffs, then that’s it. Last chance to run.”
“Thank you!” Cas deadpanned sarcastically. “They’ll be expecting us to take a direct route to the ferry. And we have the time to do this instead.”
Zach had his hands on his hips, eyes closed as he looked heavenward.
Cas rolled out of bed with a smile on his face, sun streaming in the window. He showered and dressed in smart navy suit pants with a crisp white shirt and red tie. He buttoned up his waistcoat and shrugged on his holsters. The coffee machine beeped softly. Cas picked up his full cup, looking through the floor length windows to his nearby Japanese pond and cherry blossoms in full bloom. It was a beautiful spring day. Cas headed to the living room. He stepped over the party debris, batting floating birthday balloons out of his way, finding his brother who had passed out spreadeagled on the floor, hugging an empty bottle to his face with one hand, a soft birthday teddy clutched in the other.
Cas met Gabriel’s eyes, nodding to him as he tucked in his shirt and dusted himself off. Meg, the prosecutor, smirked at Metatron with glee as she stood.
Dean watched the two cars in the rear view mirror, pulling a sharp right turn to try and lose them.
Cas indicated his head towards Dean’s flask. “Use that. Timeline’s not built for another break.”
“It’s inefficient, and I don’t kill people. I protect them.” Cas got into the driver’s seat.
Cas had come in through the back door of a hardware shop. He looked wildly around for a moment, selecting an axe from the wall display. He twirled it a few times, getting in position by the door, with wide eyes, panting harshly. Alastair burst in, getting a strongly swung axe into the abdomen for his trouble. Cas kneed the butt of the axe, trying to drive it in deeper, which broke off the handle. He slammed Alastair’s wrist with the wood, causing him to drop his gun. Cas swung for his face, but Alastair ducked, getting his shoulder into Cas’ abdomen, lifting him up and slamming him into the ground through a glass display. Some customers fled.
Cas knocked back another shot, reaching for the bottle. “I hope they kill him, I really do.”
One block away from the courthouse, a large Arctic truck turned onto the courthouse street, oblivious to the correct driving lanes.
“Go with God!” Cas waved after them, watching them go down the road. He pointed to Dean. “This man’s killed over 150 people.”
“What happened to Cas?”
“Fuck that. Interpol’s compromised, you know that.” Gabriel didn’t move a muscle. “Gabe! Either you shoot me or watch me bleed out.”
"Dean....!" Cas squeaked and turned back to look at him with such joy in his blue eyes that it took his breath away. He was forced to drop his cargo when Cas grabbed his arm and dragged him down the stairs. Human or not, that dude was still very strong. Sam leaned against the railing watching them. The place did look quite nice by candlelight. Even the low glow from the electric lights helped to create a lovely atmosphere. Cas ran around, looked at each pumpkin, delighted at the light strings, marveled at the spread of food. His face was flushed and his eyes twinkled. Dean looked around with a goofy face.
Cas pulled the bike around and stopped at the edge of the bridge, lifting his visor to watch Dean as he zipped home free down the canal. Dean looked over his shoulder, blowing Cas a kiss. Cas huffed a little laugh as he smiled after him, forgetting to be mad at him.
"Yeah, thanks Charlie. I have to go now. Thanks for that. When is the gift due?"
“Saucy minx. The audacity! This is all mine.” Dean pulled the plate close into him, one arm protectively around it, grabbing a spoon.
“Wales knows what it’s about, hot damn!”
to be in that court before the deadline. I’ll follow your lead. Scout’s honour. So can you lay off the restraints please?”
Dean chuckled. “You’re like Rambo.” Cas closed his eyes, wondering if anything was broken as Dean sped off.
Gabriel nodded, squeezing his hand. “We have gotta get some morphine into you more often, baby bro, you haven’t been this chatty and giggly in—“ Gabriel was interrupted by Dean, knocking into him unceremoniously in his haste. “Sorry, Gabe. Cas! You okay? You mustn’t have lost that much blood, huh? Bleeding is inefficient, wasn’t that what you said?” He checked Cas over critically, peeking at the gunshot wound, accidentally poking the forehead nail wound too hard.
Dean hobbled closer, ignoring his writhing. “Get up on the ledge, Dookie-man.”
Another one of Dean’s favourite videos was of Cas full on belly laughing. The hard, not being able to breath laugh. Dean didn’t know what the hell Cards Against Humanity was, he just loved that it amused Cas so much. His face was all scrunched up and adorable, as he wiped his eyes, fighting to breathe, before collapsing into giggles again, clutching his pained side. Gabriel turned the camera back to himself. “He also gets like this when he’s tickled, Dean-o. Just so’s you know.” Dean smiled when he could hear Cas out of frame. “Oh, he knows!” Gabriel wiggled his eyebrows and stopped recording.
“You look wiped, Cas. Sure you won’t let me drive? Please?” Dean leaned in, placing one hand on Cas’ to emphasise his plea. Cas didn’t move his hand, looking up to Dean. “I can’t.” Dean nodded sadly, sitting back, taking his hand with him. Cas sat back heavily too.
He punched Alastair in the crotch, who staggered back, harshly ripping the shovel out of Cas’ leg as he went. Cas cursed loudly, looking about for anything else within reach. His eyes fell on the rolls of chain on the near wall. He grabbed a good sized one, stood straight with effort, lined up with Alastair who was advancing on him again, and tossed the chain. It wrapped neatly around Alastair’s neck twice, catching together. Alastair’s eyes went wide with disbelief, grabbing at the chain to loosen it. Cas pulled harder, holding tight so Alastair couldn’t loosen it with any movement. Cas saw that Alastair had managed to get a finger in under the chain, which would never do.
Cas moved his hand down along Dean’s neck, pulling him in gently, beginning to press soft kisses along Dean’s cheek. Dean closed his eyes with a pleasant shudder as Cas worked his way along both eyelids, skirting along an ear, ghosting along Dean’s other cheek and along to his other ear, breathing hotly within. Cas licked softly along the sensitive area, drawing a loud gasp from Dean when he bit his earlobe just right. Dean was so lost to sensation that he almost didn’t notice Cas’ hot breath along his lips. As his mouth was already slack jawed from pleasure, Cas dove forward with a probing tongue, kissing Dean deeply, who moaned loudly in surprise.
“And you’re bleeding again.” Cas opened the door wide.
The clerk hummed again.
Two more thrusts was all it took until Cas locked up, spurting between their heaving bodies. He threw his head back and moaned loud and long through his orgasm, arms helplessly wrapped around Dean’s shoulders, still scrawling his back. Dean kept a hard rhythm going for Cas throughout his release, wanting to make it good for him, but he was soon sobbing for breath as he himself was almost overcome with Cas spasming around his cock. Dean buried his face into Cas’ neck, licking at that magic spot below his ear, groaning against his skin as his own orgasm crested. Dean quickly leaned up, catching Cas’ panting lips in his own, moaning his own pleasured gasps into Cas’ mouth. Dean’s hips moved erratically as he pistoned harder into Cas, filling him up to the brim with pulse after pulse of his warm come, already feeling it spilling out of him past his cock.
“Huh. And you grew up wanting to be a cop until you realised there wasn’t any money in that shit. So you joined the CIA to sharpen your skills then you decided to open your own shop. Pimp yourself out to the fat cats. And I didn’t even have to do any research to know that shit. It’s written all over your punk ass.”
With his right hand now free, Dean wrapped it around Cas’ upturned shoulder gently, spreading his fingers between Cas’ shoulder blades, moving his left hand up to card through Cas’ hair as he pressed a soft kiss to Cas’ forehead. Cas moved slightly, then settled down again with a deep happy sigh. His head burrowed deeper into Dean’s chest before stilling. His breath evened out as Dean’s chest swelled. He tightened both arms to hug Cas protectively close. Fuck, this was so nice. Dean was still smiling when sleep took him once more.
Cas pulled Dean flush against him, feeling up under his t-shirt to play with his nipples. Dean rested his head back against Cas’ shoulder, looking at him with such an expression of need that Cas couldn’t deny him anything. Dean’s fingers white knuckled like claws on the door as Cas began fucking into him with a brutal pace. Dean used the door as leverage to push back against Cas as hard as he could. Cas thrust into him with such power, that Dean was forced up on one foot. “Fuck, Cas. You’re so big!” He turned his head to kiss Cas thoroughly, pressing his tongue into his lips as deep as he could. He curled his arm around Cas’ head, grabbing his hair for dear life. Cas growled, changing the angle by lifting Dean’s aloft knee up further, holding it in place. Dean bucked as the new angle caused him to get Dean’s prostate full on. Dean had to break away, unable to keep from gasping and moaning, but still looking at Cas like the snack he was, urging Cas to go harder with a whimper. Dean keened to himself, enjoying one of the most satisfying fucks of his life.
Gabriel ran to his brother’s side, as Cas sat back, flopping his head against the wood. He looked up at Gabriel with a sad smile, eyes not really seeing him.
Cas woke a while later, frowning. He could see the daylight still peeking around the curtain, happy it wasn’t yet time to get up. He suddenly became aware of his situation, how closely he was pressed against a sleeping Dean who had his cheek pressed into Cas’ hair. They were facing each other side by side. It was then that he noticed Dean was holding him with both arms, with Cas’ own wrapped around Dean. Cas raised his head to look at the dangling handcuff. He smiled. He should have known it wouldn’t hold Dean, the guy was too good.
“Okay, what do you want me to do?”
“Fine.” Says Dean without a single hesitation.
“I have found a way to bring him back. But it involves you going into the empty.”
As they left the bunker, Sam sees Dean’s face and asks, “Are you crying?” “What? No.”, says Dean trying to cover up his feelings. Sam notices that Dean is wearing Castiel’s tie. ‘Probably as a remembrance’, Sam thinks to himself. Adam decides to go with them as an exercise since he has never hunted monsters before and Dean has been training him ever since he joined them. They get into the 67’ Chewy Impala and go the house where the murder happened. They find out the father was dead, the mother’s tongue was cut off and their two children have been taken. They see the sketch the mother drew. Dean realizes quickly that they’ve tried hunting these things before with their father in 1986. He jokingly names them ‘Vamp-Mimes’. Adam discovers a pattern in the victims and finds out which house will become the next victim. They go and stand by that house until the monsters arrive in a Car. Dean kills one of the two Vamp-Mimes and ties up the other as Sam uncovers the mask it is wearing. It is a teen boy vampire. The Winchesters tries to get the information out of him as they threaten him. The Vamp tells them where his nest is before Dean kills him. Realizing they might need backup, Sam calls Eileen and tells her to meet at this barn that is supposed to be the nest for these Vamp-Mimes.
Eileen takes Sam back into the barn as Sam is still saying, “I knew it!” and pointing at Dean & Cas. “Thank you all for bringing me back and reuniting me with the only one I can call my family.” says Michael. “How the hell did you do that, Jack?” asks Dean. “I was able to sneak him out through another rift as the Empty was busy fighting you.” said Jack. “Well, thank you. And I am sorry the betrayal. I am always that hopeless when I am without Adam. Now we must go.” said Michael. “Where will you go?” asked Sam. “Our original plan. Travel throughout the World. See the wonders of the Universe. Besides, he & I have a lot of catching up to do.”, said Michael before flying away.
Days after that morning, Dean & Cas are holding hands and dancing to a song in the bunker. “You know, after this we should go the bedroom and get to the fifth base.” says Dean with smile on his face. “What’s a fifth base?” asks Cas with a confused head tilt. “Never mind, just keep dancing.” says Dean hopelessly looking at Cas as they continue dancing.
“Well, I guess I have no other choice left but to accept.” Says Cas as Dean leans towards him and kisses him.
Dean tells Castiel to come with him but Castiel hesitates. “What’s wrong?” asks dean.
“Are you proposing to me?” asks Cas with a little smile doing a head tilt.
As they are kissing, Sam walks in the barn and sees them. Dean stops and yells, “Damnit Sam, Every time!”
Days after Jack defeated God and brought back all people, Sam & Dean found their half-brother Adam & invited him to live with them in the Bunker. Adam happily accepted the offer as he now had no one (not even Michael) but his half-brothers as his family. The Winchesters still kept hunting monsters sometimes accompanied by Sam’s girlfriend Eileen.
“Get those kids back to their home and take Adam & Eileen with you. If everything goes right, we’ll be done before you are back.”
Oh god, oh god, I’m gonna die. I’m going to hell.

Sam plates the food, and turns off the burner, before shifting to face Eileen and sign:

“Son.” John nods, as his only acknowledgement as he pulls away.
Glenn opens his mouth in a silent “o.” He looks at Dean sympathetically.

Dean’s still in firm denial. He wasn’t mistreated, he wasn’t hurt, he’s fine. See? He’s tearing up and on the edge of a breakdown. Totally fine.
You were made to go out and get him.
But, Dean, you do know-
Castiel, I know. Quite frankly I don’t know why you bother. He’s dead, he’s alive, he’s crazy, he’s God... he’ll be back anyhow one way or another.
But, uh, no. He died before I ever figured it out. I’m not... gay, by the way.
Jack pauses to breathe and nod. Dean lets out a sharp breathe through his nose. Like he needed more reasons to hate Chuck.

INT. MEN OF LETTERS - BATHROOM - MORNING
The Impala pulls into the dirt next to the barn. It’s worn past when we last saw it, a few sheets of the roof have gone. Dean gets out of the car first, and we have a solitary shot of Dean standing there, looking out at the barn.

A beat of silence. Eileen puts a hand on Sam’s shoulder to comfort him. Jack looks at Dean, bittersweet. He cares.
Cas faces Sam to address him with that serious energy he’s always carrying around him. If Dean was a weaker man, he’d totally think it’s hot (Dean is oh so weak). “Good morning, Sam. Welcome to heaven. What’s wrong with Dean?”
Uh, hospital across town. I can give you directions-

“The Empty.” Jack explained, too knowingly, to Sam. “It would come when he was truly happy… and- and it must’ve been able to kill Billie.” Jack was solemn. They were reserved, repressing, not crying just yet. It seemed they weren’t really present. Taken like a true Winchester.
GLENN
Shut up, Cas. I was busy.
"All of you! OUT!" the Empty shouted, the shrill voice echoing through the void. The figures started shambling toward the portal, and Dean quickened his steps, trying not to be caught in the path of any of them.
DEAN (CONT’D)
So, what, I’m your replacement cuddle? Just ‘cause you know I’m gay doesn’t mean-
Dean kisses the fuck out of him, and doesn't say it, he can't. He hopes Cas will hear it when he hugs him tight- I-can't-breathe-Dean-tight. And he does. Castiel hears, "I love you," so loudly as it rings through Dean's head. He hears, "never do that again, I love you, please stay," and finally he believes he's truly, truly wanted. Loved.
“Hey, sweetheart. Mind helping me plate stuff?”
Eileen tilts her head and puts her hand on her chin in a half-mocking contemplation.
“Jo!” Dean startles and glares at her.

At around 80 BPM, we get a series of slicing shots. A hand comes into frame to chop off an old guy’s head, one to pull off someone’s arm gruesomely, a person’s neck snapped, heart stabbed, neck stabbed, and knife twisted. With each of these, a scream of pain coming from the corresponding victim.
Castiel stops and stares into space.
CASTIEL
Cas, can we-
Look, uh, I texted Eileen. She’s back, making her way to the bunker as we speak. I’m gonna make a few more calls to Jody, the girls, probably Garth too. You, uh. You have fun playing Baby Mama on Jack.
Eileen can’t hear them, and is still on lookout when another Djinn knocks her out with a baseball bat. Then FLASH CUTS to Sam and Dean, struggling against their respective Djinn. Sam manages to flip his around once, but is immediately thrown onto the ground and knocked out. Dean gets on top of his Djinn for a few seconds struggling, before it overpowers him and clocks him in the face. He falls unconscious.
Queen Valeria’s creepy caring shit turns sour.

That’s not what I’m worried about.
Dean looks up and to his right, and there Castiel - in his old, season 8 trench coat - stands above a kneeling, praying FAKE DEAN with a knife held to his throat. Castiel looks desperate and afraid.
Fuck, is this real?
Dean, Sam, and Eileen are swinging on their chains in silence, each glaring at the two Djinn sitting on the other end of the room. Dean’s trying to struggle to break his chains, but it’s really not working. Djinn One and Two start setting up a game of cards on the window sill.

Alright guys-
It’s your turn!
They keep walking. Meg looks surprisingly unemotional, while Dean’s trying desperately to stay out of his. On his empty, tired, and broken expression-
Dean doesn’t call for Cas right away, it just doesn’t feel right. Instead, he sits down cross-legged in the grass and smiles up at the sunshine. The grass is a dry yellow that shouldn’t bring as much warmth as it does to his heart. Running his fingers through it, he finds a flower.

Dark goo- all too familiar- started forming behind Chuck. Dean kicked him in, leaving no time for Chuck to react, and jumped after, hearing shouts of protest echo away. It was Chuck, Dean, and this newly formed dark figure, slowly turning into Meg’s last meatsuit.
Dean runs his hand over his face and through his hair before it rests on his eyes again. He cries into his hand. Sam forcefully pulls him into an awkward, but consoling hug. Slow ZOOM OUT from the backseat, sobs and hiccups echoing.

We could convince Dean to come, you know. Could use the help. 12 disappearances, who knows how many unreported...

Castiel has nothing to say in his defense. Dean looks at him longingly. Add a little spicy

Sam sighs and sits back in his seat.
"Yeah well why does that something always seem to be you."
Dean grabs a tall candle holder and works his way over to a section of stone labeled “HERE LIES PASTOR JOHN WILLIAMS.” He jams the candle holder into the side of it.
The bunker then sat in silence for a bit, no one quite knowing what to do or say. Dean had just killed death, and lost- he lost- an important person. The most, besides Sam. Of course Dean fucked the Chuck situation up too, and killed- him because of it. Not only is- he- not only is he dead but the whole world would surely collapse all because of a stupid, angry, thoughtless decision Dean made because that’s all he knows how to do! Tears were welling up Dean’s eyes before Jack interjected.
SAM (CONT’D)
Dean lifts up the sleeve of his shirt to line his hand up with the handprint scar, and he sniffles, determined not to cry. He flops back first onto the bed and stares at the ceiling. He’s lost, empty, blank.

Uh, sometimes?

John clears his throat. “And who might you two be?” John asks, gesturing between Eileen and Cas.

They stand staring at each other for a little longer, before Dean breaks the silence by clearing his throat and pushing through the door to-

Sam and Dean pull out their badges and flip them open to show Mre Brown. She nods quickly.
The priest won't divulge that fact in his homily

What led up to Jenny’s disappearance? Anything out of the ordinary, cold spots, strange smells, was she maybe acting suddenly different?
The third mass murder of this nature, and police are no closer to catching the culprits. Despite their faces readily available, even advertised, on the security tapes, detectives still can’t seem to find these killers. Stay tuned for more information.
We’re right where we left off before the (totally made up) commercial break, with Dean, Sam, and Castiel standing in Jack’s room, the brothers in shock.
Awwh.

You’re brother’s right. The Empty is vast, dark, and confusing. I can’t help you there, and you can’t bring Jack.
“We belong here, not in harmony, and not destroying an Earth you built so beautifully. I’m sorry.” Amara seemed at least a little apologetic, but not very. She seemed happy with what she was doing. She was brought into the black goo in peace.
Dean’s voice breaks, especially on that word. Shit, now he’s really crying.
Dean gave Cas a once over as soon as he had entered, biting his lip and checking out- ew, admiring? - Cas' hickeys.
More flashing and spinning cuts, now Dean’s laying on the ground, holding on to the bloody handprint on his jacket.

Jack smiles, then starts tucking himself and his teddy bear in under the covers. Dean helps, even fluffs his pillow a little bit, then sits down beside Jack on the bed. Oh, how far he has fallen. No chick flick moments.
Um, look. You asked why I was acting different, but I know you are too. I just- what changed?
I couldn’t fucking think! I died, a vamp nest I could’ve easily taken care of, and I died and I didn’t fucking care, Cas!
“YES!” Sam puts up both of his hands then brings them down in a

You seem like a good guy. Always saying hi to your little brother in the halls. And you’re talking to me. Not trying to avoid me like the plague or beat me up. Fair warning, though, you keep it up they’ll start calling you things.
Glenn puts a hand up to silence Dean. He shakes his head, the anger gone, leaving regret.
One for me too, please.
Jack doesn’t know the song, so he doesn’t notice the pronoun change. He just sits back, enjoys, and droopily closes his eyes. Dean didn’t notice either, a subconscious thing.
I want you to promise to never go after Sam, Dean, or Jack again. Do not let Lucifer go after him. Protect him. and...
After that, we took her to the old abandoned church. Thought some time alone with prayer would do her good, that maybe god would forgive her for her sins.
Woah, since when is that back?
Sam stares in stunned silence. Dean sighs guiltily, trying not to look at Sam for his reaction.
It wasn’t a long drive. Heaven likes to do that, where it knows exactly how long you want your commute to be, to wherever you want to go, which it knows too. He wants to congratulate Jack on his good work but- later. Or never. Jack clearly doesn’t want to talk to him. Cas probably doesn’t either, but this time, Dean decides, the bastard doesn’t have a choice. Dean arrives in a meadow, good place as any to scream into the heavens- or- sky, or whatever.
QUEEN VALERIA

Castiel smiles softly, and presses a kiss to HIS- and isn't that wonderful- his hunter's head.
So frustration, and bridezillla Cas (and maybe a little feistiness came out in Dean, too), and flowers and food aside, they’re here.

Turns out after those nuns died, one of the pastors there started preaching how it was god’s work. Pastor John. He actually ran a sort of... conversion therapy thing there. Then, as soon as he died, the disappearances started.
Djinn One is cut off by Sam stabbing him through the heart with a stake. Each hunter is left breathless, huffing and trying to catch their breath. Jack is beaming. He picks up Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy, now stained with Djinn Blood.
Dean opens his eyes to look back up at the ceiling for a beat. He scoffs and stares at the floor instead.
Oh, okay. But when we play again Megator, the train conductor, and Marvelous Marvin need to make a big decision!

I was nothing but a soldier, a medium to conduct orders before I pulled Dean from hell. I felt nothing until this reckless, disobedient, infuriating man began to question me and my orders. Then I began to feel...
As his vows come to an end Dean sniffles a little bit and resists wiping away the tears. Writing his vows, he thought, what a horrible way to end it, with myself, but Sam insisted. And Sam was right, because that final line chokes a sob from Cas’ throat, as he retracts one of his hands to cover his mouth.

Dean drinks more, some spilling down his chin and onto his shirt.
I’ll... I’ll tell you what I know.
It’s cold and hard and petrified
Well that’s a respectful way to treat a son.
Sam gets up from the couch and walks up the stairs, sending Dean a clear look of “don’t piss them off, please.” Dean and the Browns look at each other with a whole bucket of tension.
Jack nods and continues playing with Eileen. Dean sighs.

Let’s pick up your soul
“Woah there cowboy!” Dean says, startled by the intense volume Sam’s projecting.
Oh, these are federal agents, uh-
Wow. He’s never seen Cas that wide-eyed, not even in the brothel he took him to. Cas is in disbelief. It’s kinda (

He’s awake, Dean thought, relieved. He searched the surprisingly (and by that he means totally unsurprisingly) empty landscape for Cas, who suddenly appeared laying down a few feet (whatever that meant here) away.

Go on, Cas.

Pastor John slowly takes his nasty hands off of Robert. He stalks over to Jenny’s open confessional booth.

He thinks, "you need me? You need me for what? Why are we family? Why won't you leave without me?" Human emotions were strange, and confusing, and new. He couldn't get it when Dean expressed them in such a convoluted way. Dean didn't get it when he did, either.

Dean’s back in bed, awake suddenly. He sits up again to look at the spot where Cas had been sitting. Dean sniffles, shaking his head.

Oh, you think.

The point is, it took
Oh, I know.

“Well, some of us got to wing it, you prepared bastard.” Cas smiles a small, sweet smile. It feels like sunshine- and
Dean pulls back, but holds on to Cas’ shoulder.
DEAN (V.O.)
There’s always a fuckin’ timer on this shit. What do we do when we’re in there?
Dean walks over and joins Jack and Castiel on the floor cross-legged. Castiel averts his eyes.
Uhh, okay, what else?
Jack looks contemplative. Then he drags Dean down to his level by the arm and pulls up his shirt to reveal the handprint. Next dialogue: rapid fire, interrupting each other.
Ow. Shit.
Dean starts running with Cas hooked over his shoulders. Cas hobbled a bit, slowing Dean down. Cas looks back at Meg, who smiles and continues singing Mamma Mia. What a relationship.
“Dean, about the things I said before I was taken. I ju…”, Cas hasn’t finished his sentence before Dean holds him and kisses him on the lips making Cas realize that his feelings for Dean are completely reciprocated. Dean holds Cas’s hands and takes him to the rift. Just as they are about to get out, the Empty tries to telekinetically hold Castiel inside. As Dean realizes this, he holds Cas from behind and tries to pull Cas outside. Eventually, Dean succeeds to get Cas out but the Empty manages to take all of Cas’s grace out of him before he is outside and the rift closes behind them. The Empty cries in anger and pain before it falls back to its sleep and all the other entities with it.
“And how is he supposed to put the Empty to sleep?” asks Sam. Jack creates an eight sided pointy blade into thin air and gives it to dean. “You’ll have to stab this blade right into the chest of the body it is wearing. This will put it right back to sleep.”
One day, as Sam & Dean were about to leave for a job, jack showed up in the Bunker. Dean ran towards him & asked for some news. Jack said, “Nothing. The Empty still isn’t doesn’t agree to give Cas. ‘A deal is a deal’, it said.” Dean looked sad but he wasn’t ready to give up hope just yet. After hearing Jack’s voice in the Bunker, Adam goes to him and asks about some news on Michael. Jack says, “The Empty wouldn’t let go of him either. It’s all chaos in the Empty as all entities there have woken up. In his time as God, Chuck made a lot of mess and I am still not done fixing it all. I will come to you if there anything changes.” Jack vanished as he uttered these words.
Cas settled up quickly, sitting in silence while Dean recounted a funny story as he finished his pie. Eventually, Dean patted his full belly with a sigh.
“That doesn’t help, huh? What will?”
Dean stepped out onto the square. Alastair spotted him immediately, speaking rapidly into his microphone. His goons started shooting at Dean from all sides. He crouched down and ran to the street opposite.
Dean winked back at him, smirking.
“You heard me bitch! Up on the ledge!” Dean pointed the gun into his face.
“Setting up operation at Coventry police HQ. You got nothing from Chuck?”
“What the fuck is that you’re eating?”
“Oh, fuck yes!”
Cas pondered this for a moment as he chewed. It would be a hell of a lot easier than having to worry about Dean every damn minute. He swallowed. “Fine, but the second it looks like you’re gonna run, never mind the cuffs, I’ll restrain you myself.”
Rowena looked at him closely. “No surprise there. Those facial tremors will pass. And your throat?”
“I’ll make it real simple for you. If I stay near him, they’ll find him.” Gabriel began to gather up his jacket and things.
“Lucky for who? Awh shit.” Dean had righted the extendable armchair, sitting up properly, getting a jolt of pain through his leg.
“Dean?” Cas went to the ditch on Dean’s side of the car. “Hey asshole! Fuckit! God dammit! That’s not mud!” Cas had fallen into the ditch in the dark. From the bushes near the driver’s door, Dean emerged, zipping up his pants. He sat into Cas’ seat, sparking the two wires together to try and get the car started. He managed two sparked tries before he felt the cold gun barrel against his temple, and hot breath in his ear.
As he spoke, Cas got up from the table, grabbed him by the cheeks with both hands and pulled him into a kiss. That shut Dean up. He was so startled and so delighted that it took him a second to kiss him back and wrap his arms around Cas. It was the culmination of the last several weeks of thinking about doing this with Cas since the first moment he had laid eyes on him. It was everything he had thought it would be, and better. He didn't want this to end, Cas tasted amazing.
He sighed, looking back to Dean. “Bad everything. I should just go home.”
Gabriel followed closely. “There’s a safe house near here.”
Cas spoke over him. “I got it, you’re going to be that inmate that all the other inmates come to for advice. They’re very lucky.”
Around 5pm, there was a tentative knock on his door. Without even looking up from his laptop, Dean bellowed "Come in Charlie! What's up?"
“My brother and I aren’t any of your concern.”
Cas looked around briefly in disbelief before flopping back in pain again. That son of a bitch, not even letting him speak. They’d have words later, but for now, Cas’ top priority was his brother.
“Cas!” Dean grasped Cas’ face, shaking him slightly. “CAS?!” There wasn’t any response. Cas’ hand fell off of Dean’s wrist, his arm hanging limply.
The UN peacekeeper commander outside kept a watchful eye on the crowd as his second touched his earpiece. “Suspicious vehicle approaching, Commander.”
“Stay alert.” He spoke into the microphone at his wrist. Several people around the square touched their ears, and spoke into their own microphones. “Copy that.”
Dean perked up immediately, sitting bolt upright, light no longer bothering him. “Whatcha got?”
Rasputin watched him catch his breath impassively. “Where is Dean Winchester?”
Outside in a nearby square, a man spoke into his phone. He had an earpiece in the other ear. “Yeah, we’ve got the whole area covered. If Winchester shows up, he’s ours.” He hung up the phone and nodded across the way to a woman leaning against a car bonnet. She nodded back.
“Yeah.”
Cas flopped back, exposing the long line of his neck as he stared up at Dean. “For what?”
Dean sat up, noticing the red blood stain along the side of his shirt. “What the fuck?!” He poked at himself, but the blood wasn’t his. His face paled as he turned to Cas with an awful realisation. Cas clutched his side, his shirt growing redder by the second.
Dean yelled “Fuck!” and tossed the now empty gun. Dean had a look at his leg and couldn’t see an exit wound. He hobbled unsteadily to his feet, making his way to the footpath. It was eerily quiet along the street. Gabriel peeked his head around the van, and watched as Dean disarmed a dead bad guy, and hopped up a nearby arched alley. Gabriel figured it was pretty safe now, and ran to follow Dean. He caught up with him a short way up the alley, pointing his gun at Dean’s back.
Dean stood a little behind him, taking guns from the boot, checking their magazines, then stashing them about his person. He looked to Cas, tucking the latest one into the belt at the small of his back. “Yeah, I know I would be.”
Outside, the police were going insane, running around in a tizzy. Several were shouting into radios, “Shots fired!” Heavily armed SWAT spilled out of vans, heading for the building. Cas and Dean ran up the flights of stairs, able to see the swarm of SWAT below them. They could hear helicopters overhead. Dean was almost a full flight behind Cas.
His attention was grabbed by Rasputin on the other side, who had dragged up a machine that looked like a doctored hospital defibrillator. Cas could hear the ominous hum as it was turned on. Rasputin cranked the dial all the way up. The awful hum grew louder. Cas began to feel nervous.
“Always.”
“Repeat, Bravo One down!”
Dean pulled them off the highway, racing along quiet streets towards the centre of the city. Alastair’s guys were placed along all routes heading downtown. One team was parked nearby and spotted them driving past. There was a flurry of activity as they raced to catch up, speaking into radios to give the position to the whole team.
Having missed the entire conversation, Sam, Jess and Charlie smiled to themselves. “I think we’re not needed here after all, guys. Stand down.” They all nodded, hurrying after Dean and Cas.
The phone could just about download videos, but didn’t allow Dean to upload his own. The first one that came through was so simple, so normal, Dean knew he’d treasure it forever. It was just another game night, with Cas concentrating on trying to pull out a wooden Jenga piece. The camera was right up close to Cas as he stared at the block in concentration, tongue between his teeth, hand unwavering as he gently pulled it out and placed it on top of the swaying stack. He winked to the camera, saying, “That’s how winners do it.” He grinned his gummy grin, eyes twinkling as everyone else roared at his skill, a hand tussling his hair. Dean couldn’t remember how many times he played the video that night, just to hear the sound of Cas’ voice. He texted Sam to make sure they sent a lot more videos of everyone.
“Cas, come on. You didn’t do it to yourself. That’s life. Life happens.”
About 7pm, Charlie knocked on his door. He waved her in. There was concern in her eyes. "Haven't seen you much over the day, Boss. All ok?"
Gabriel stopped in his tracks, turning back to Cas with a closed off expression. “Why?” He stepped right back into Cas’ face. “Because I’ve never lied to you, Cas. Not once. You know, you’re terrible at almost everything.” Cas nodded with tears in his eyes. “But you’re good at keeping people alive. Keep him alive. Please. And you get your dream life back. And as a bonus, you’ll never hear from me again. I’ll lose your number, all right?”
“Rude.” But Sam obliged, crouching down to normal head height level. Jess and Charlie flanked him, with Dean and Cas pushed in close behind. It was a lovely photo of everyone. Charlie sighed happily as she took her phone back, eyeing up Cas. “What’s your number, babe?”
“I’m doing very well, thank you. How are you?” Already losing interest, he held up an air freshener to the clerk, mouthing whether he should try it or not.
Cas stepped carefully along the corridor, coming to the fire escape doors at the end. Staying hidden, he peered through and saw several Belarusian soldiers through the glass, armed with semi-automatics, making game plans.
“Promise me, Cas.”
“Sit down! Order!” The banging gavel had no effect.
Chuck patted Garth on the head. “As I said, there is nothing more important than a good education.” Garth continued to sob.
Zach had managed to get Gabriel into another headlock, tightly crushing his airway with his forearm, pulling him back to knock Gabriel off his feet. Zach used the few inches height difference to his advantage, crushing Gabriel.
“Don’t even think about answering that fucking phone. The only way Dukhovich could have known our route was if he had somebody on the inside. Now, I need medical supplies, and you need help. So if you’re going to call somebody, they have to be totally out of the loop.”
Sam recovered from his squeal, laughing it off. Cas was still looking at the now silent mannequin with wild-eyed distrust. Dean squeezed his hand reassuringly. “You good?” Cas swallowed and nodded. “I’m sorry about that Dean, I don’t even know you.” Cas motioned to their hands. Dean smiled, and gestured to Cas to carry on. Cas was thrilled as Dean didn’t let his hand go, but instead intertwined their fingers more firmly together.
Cas stared at himself critically in the bathroom mirror, checking his clean shaven face and untameable hair. Why would it never cooperate? He didn’t have time for this shit, so he simply scrubbed through his locks, letting them do their own thing. He finished buttoning up his shirt, marvelling at his now clear head. Whatever the hell Rowena had done, he felt miles better.
Cas stared off into space, wondering how he could get out of this one. Maybe slipping away while Gabe was otherwise occupied….? That might work. Or maybe he could pay someone to distract him.
Gabriel nodded hopelessly. The door was loudly whipped off its hinges. Nothing happened for a moment with all the smoke from the cutting machine hanging in the air. Suddenly, Dean burst out with a flurry of bullets. He dropped everyone within range, and viciously attacked anyone he could get his hands on. Gabriel followed, taking out a few that were trying to sneak up behind Dean. He stayed low behind the overturned van, providing back-up.
“Get out of the fucking car, Cas.”
The second pursuer further back shot into the air. Cas instinctively crouched before deciding there wasn’t enough cover here, and there were far too many civilians. He couldn’t risk a shoot-out. Left with only one option, he ran like a gazelle for the escalators on the far end, horribly exposed the whole way. Everyone on the platform screamed and bolted. The pursuer soon had a clean shot, and fired multiple rounds at Cas, who pelted up the escalator, dodging people and bullets until he was out of sight.
“No, no, you keep that gun and you use it to shoot me.” He didn’t turn around to look at Dean, but he was deadly serious.
Cas couldn’t contain his mocking voice. “That’s really beautiful, man. Do you ever just write stuff down, like maybe a haiku or two?”
“I trust your planning, Cas.” Dean began drumming on the back of the seat with his fingers.
[[[[[The sweet kisses soon turned heated, as ]]]]]
“PLEASE CAS!”
“Normally I would too, but I got a hot tip. There’s a couple of ringers in the game.” Dean smirked at Cas, hitting their shoulders together gently. Cas flushed before looking back to the cars they had stopped in front of, sizing them up.
He patted his gun on the table and stalked out of the interrogation room.
Cole had the good sense to look away with a guilty expression.
“Shaddup moose. Gimme my jacket.” Dean whipped off his glasses.
Cas answered with a grin of his own, until suddenly, Gabriel came crashing back into his side, knocking back a drink. Cas had to catch him around the shoulders to keep him upright. Cas rolled his eyes with a frown, glaring at his brother. Gabriel blinked blearily up at him, hiccupped, and then announced, “Dancing, Cassie. Now!”
Dean stood by the table in front of the judges. “Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?”
“You need me to like you, ok?” Cas’ eyes were pleading to Rasputin as the goon wrapped the towel fully around his head and face from the other side, holding it tightly in place. Cas shouted out again. “You need me to like you!”
Singer nodded and indicated he should continue.
Dean helped Cas down the steps, aimed and fired at another goon who had been running down the street at them with a roar. Dean turned them and went the opposite way along the street, ignoring the screaming women running around.
Dean calmly walked up the centre of the deserted road, shooting any bad guy that happened to reveal themselves. He spun around, shooting with the accuracy of an angel of death. Without warning, a stray bullet came from the side, hitting the front of his right leg just below the knee. Dean dropped with a yell, rolled on the ground, and killed the shooter with a bullet between the eyes.
He made his way slowly out the door, ducking under a dangling web, peering down a long dark hallway. Well fuck. He gingerly stepped quietly along the passage, flinching when he heard screams and laughter from another part of the house. His chest heaved, but Cas tried to will himself to be as silent as possible. Continuing his shuffling steps, he had just about got to the end of the passage when a staff member in full Leather Face gear leapt out at him.
Dean burrowed under the covers, opting for the side nearest the bathroom, leaving Cas by the window. He turned on Cas’ bedside light, and flicked off the main lights overhead. He settled on his right side, facing the wall, hugging a pillow, his back to where Cas would be, listening to the shower starting up. Shortly, when he was well on the way towards sleep, he became vaguely aware of Cas moving about the room. Dean shakily remembered thinking how nice it was to have someone in bed with him when Cas sat on his own side. He didn’t remember any more as sleep pulled him under.
“That’s not bullshit. Ok.” Cas pointed to his shoulder. “This was only a little flesh wound, you kinda zinged it right there. Didn’t even require a band aid. Got lucky.”
“Oh no, no, no. Not much more than earlier anyway. My body’s been through some trauma of late, but I’m fine.” Cas huffed a little laugh, waving him off, looking back to Gabriel with tears in his eyes, joke fading. He held out a shaky hand, which Gabriel took immediately. “I’m really sorry, Gabriel.” His tears spilled over.
A black car pulled up, Alastair got out, speaking to his own people through a microphone. They acknowledged him. They also spaced out around the square.
Cas turned his head slightly to steal a glance at Dean’s handsome profile while he could. Even with the jacket, he looked ripped, and just his type. Wait, what had Dean said? To watch where Sam was stepping?
The machine beeped loudly as Dean walked through. “Can you empty your pockets please, sir?”
“I’ve had the black diamond service four times now, do you understand? Four times. And the car still smells like a cemetery.” Cas glared at the valet service guy, trying to make him see some sense. He was still dressed in the grey Henley and black overcoat from earlier in the day.
This. This is what heaven feels like.
“I hope we’re not disturbing your family.”
“For months, I have been sitting here, nodding along to this ludicrous charade.”
“Where are we?” Dean wiped the drool from his face.
Gabriel and Zach held their heads a moment, getting steady again after being rocked by the blast. Gabriel recovered first, landing a firm kick square into Zach’s chest. Once Zach surfaced, Gabriel headbutted him, causing Zach to surge backwards. Gabriel pulled him by the wrist, yanking him to the side so Zach fell onto a knee, allowing Gabriel to deliver a hard punch to the face.
Gabriel killed the engine and news report with a sigh. This day was going to suck balls. He made his way upstairs.
There were heavy demonstrations taking place outside the courthouse. A journalist recorded his news piece nearby.
Cas nodded. “And Tiny?”
“Plethora?”
Dean smiled to himself. “When I testify, Dukhovich goes down and Sammy goes free with a full pardon. That’s the deal. I’ll still be in jail, but come on. An English jail? Bitch please.”
“Go do your job, Gabriel.” Zach growled at him. Gabriel kept following him.
“Yeah, yeah. Even you couldn’t pull that out of your ass. Still gonna testify?”
“I back-tracked west. We crossed into Wales a little while ago.”
Cas smirked at the remaining spoon. “You like pie then?”
Sam agreed, following them.
“Why?”
Dean frowned as he saw a car come up behind Cas and knock him clean off his motorbike. Cas was lifted onto the bonnet of the car with the force of the impact, and then slid unceremoniously off the car as it stopped dead. Cas landed heavily on top of his overturned bike. “Fuck!” He rolled over briefly before several hands hauled him up, bundling him into their vehicle.
Dean noticed her name tag. “Pig in a poke, please, Diane. With all the fixin’s. Black coffee. And then whatever pie you have.”
Dean swallowed, trying to focus. “For reconciling you with your brother. That was all me.”
“Delicious.” Rowena gently ruffled his hair. “You are one handsome Angel, aren’t you, Tweetie Pie? And I must say, it’s an absolute pleasure to meet you at last, after hearing Dean speak about you for all these years. I never thought the day would come where he actually brought you and those heavenly blue eyes home. Always so lovely to have guests.”
Cas was thrown into a makeshift dentist’s chair, with his helmet still on his head. Two guys held him down as they strapped him in, securing his arms, legs and torso with thick tight straps. They began to rapidly talk to each other in Russian, trying to figure out how to remove his helmet as they poked and prodded at it.
“Anything. He’s the only family I have. I loved him. Trusted him. But he sold me out. Case closed.”
Cas grunted before looking back to the screen. He looked up again when Dean cleared his throat loudly. He was still standing in place, although somewhat more awkward than before. Cas tilted his head and squinted in confusion.
“Well, we’ll find out then, won’t we? You’re three hours away, I’ll see you in two and a half.” He hung up the phone.
“And you, Cas? You’re bleeding!” Gabriel pulled back his suit jacket to see the large red stain on his shirt. Cas closed his eyes.
“How come you’re this tired, Cas?”
“That I’m a stupid man. And that I’m sorry. For everything.” Cas turned to Dean. “Hey, what if I told you I couldn’t protect you?”
Nobody cared but Dean kept singing anyway. Cas had his back turned, arms outstretched with Sam making small adjustments to the costume. On hearing Dean, Cas turned around. Dean both stopped breathing and singing, his voice petered off in a gurgling squeak. Cas looked DAMN good in an Eastwood get up. Although Cas had been clean shaven, Sam had applied a bit of dark make up around his face to give the illusion of face scruff. Dean barely registered Cas' eyes widening as they both took in the full views on offer, oblivious to anything else. Thank god for that blessed satchel as Dean had an instant boner. Cas was having similar difficulty himself. Dean looked very very well as Indiana Jones. He even had a whip! At least the loose blanket was helping with his own erection. Neither noticed that Sam had to turn around to keep his shit eating grin to himself.
In response, the goon pulled the towel over his head again, and Rasputin resumed the torture. Because the towel had not been soaked again, big orange sparks darted across it this time. Rasputin stared at Cas with a deranged look in his eyes as he followed the squirming and twitching of Cas’ head. He held on a lot longer this time, until the towel began to smoke alarmingly. Cas yelled in agony, bucking against the straps. When the towel was finally pulled away, Cas gasped and choked in pain, unable to speak for several seconds.
Cas looked crestfallen. "Oh. Well, that's ok. I'll just take these away."
“That’s weak, Dean. Even for you.” Benny shook his head with mirth. “Ok, enough time’s passed by now, in you go. Hope you make it out alive……!”
Cas looked at Dean incredulously. “I didn’t jump out of the— I went through the fucking windshield.”
“The only way for the country to progress is by eradicating the scourge of genocide blackening our country and our livelihood.” Chuck’s voice cracked in amusement towards the end. “I appreciate your modesty.”
“SUCK IT!” A door banged loudly. Dean looked after him with a sudden sad face, still holding his mouth. “Well shit.”
“No, nope. You forget, Cas, Dukhovich is going down.”
He thought a second before doing a classic vampire hiss, hands outstretched like claws. He hoped Charlie had already taken the photo as the teeth chose that moment to slide from his mouth, to much laughter. But he managed to catch them, so he felt like a ninja.
“Utter perfection. Thanks.” Dean flashed her a charming smile.
“Mr. Winchester, this is Interpol’s offer. In return for your testimony against former President Dukhovich, your brother will receive a full pardon from all jurisdictions.”
Dean whistled. “Well, we got our choice of wheels.”
———————————————
“Nothing for miles, Chief. Almost boring.”
“Fine!” Cas got out of the car.
“Not a fan! You know they call them swinging dicks for a reason.”
He turned back in time to see another guy dance up behind his beau. Cas frowned at the blatant audacity. His nostrils flared as the hot guy turned to the newcomer. Cas was surprised at the strong surge of jealousy he felt, until he saw his potential love interest gently push the newcomer away with a shaking head. He then turned back to Cas with a grin, wiggling his eyebrows, holding out an inviting hand as he swayed with a beckoning finger.
Sam couldn't quite remember when he had first noticed the change in Dean and Cas, but once seen, it could not be unseen: lingering glances, barely-there flirting, random acts of kindness and thoughtfulness, the whole 9. At first he thought it was his sick-addled brain playing tricks on him. He just wanted his brother to be happy, and despite his concern about Sam, Dean looked happy whenever Cas was around being his usual clueless self.
Later, a knock on the door had Dean standing before he was any way conscious. One-eyed, he patted around under the pillow for the gun that wasn’t there, cursing softly. Cas rolled out of bed, watching him. “There’s nothing to fear Dean. That’s just the owner.”
They were driving for a while before Dean took a look out of each side window, seeing all the tall buildings near them.
"Unless, are you sure you're going to be okay on your own Sam?" Cas inquired with narrowed eyes and a trademarked head tilt. These were the times that Sam missed the trench coat. He noticed Dean smiling fondly at Cas before coming back to himself, cleared his throat and gruffly asked, "Yeah, Sammy?"
“Did you drive here?” Cas shook his head.
Chuck had gotten into full flow in the courtroom.
Crowley stopped his kissing with a disgusted look on his face, clutching the dog bag to his chest. “Smells like arse in here.”
Behind the goon, the silhouette of a lone figure slowly darkened the plastic. He moved to the slight break in the hanging, picking up Cas’ discarded helmet without the two goons noticing. He threw a flash grenade into the room, startling and blinding them.
Dean ignored him. “You take eleven o’clock, I’ll take one, and we’ll see who gets to twelve first.” Dean loaded the magazine. Cas shook his head briefly before agreeing. “Why not? Fuck it.”
The quickest Belarusian rushed through the first open door, running up the train, looking for Cas as he went. The other two stayed on the platform, running alongside the train a bit further back. Cas risked another quick look up, and saw the Belarusian already beelining for him, not even half a carriage away. Cas got up and dashed along the train, pulling anything he could reach to throw in his pursuer’s way. Another Belarusian ran onto the train, giving chase. The third Belarusian had begun to run faster alongside the train when he saw Cas moving.
“On the roof, you’re going to find another who’s gonna need some dental work.” Cas had taken advantage of the sniper’s distraction while he lined up his scope, savagely kicking him into the back of his knee from behind. He then picked up the dropped rifle and smashed him into the mouth, cable tying his hands to finish.
He was giddy with excitement. It was getting dark and those idiots should be back any time now. He set up his i-pod while he was waiting, playing the cheesiest Halloween playlist he had been able to find. Monster Mash was starting when he heard the familiar rumble in the garage. This was gonna be sweet!
Cas looked off to the distance, thoughtful. “I should just forget about Kurasawa.”
“Hello? Hello? Cas?”
“Now now, it’s taking longer than expected as I’m gonna get you out the right way, Sammy. A full pardon, so you can go back to your life a free man. How’s that sound?”
Dean knew when he succeeded in finding that magic spot when Cas locked up with a loud gasp, his teeth grabbing his lower lip with a low growl. A thin sheen of sweat broke out across his brow as Dean worked a third finger in, Cas pushing back on them to get them all in deeper. Dean’s free hand rubbed along Cas’ runner thighs, grazing his balls, grasping at Cas’ throbbing erection.
Cas arrived at the Coventry address, opening the boot, retrieving the necessary items. He checked and pocketed his gun, picking up the cooler and bag. He slammed the boot down again, quietly making his way through the darkness to the door.
“However it happened…” Dean cut him off with a smile. “..I got my own reasons. Chuck’s going down, you can count on that. I
Cas held up a shaky hand in a bloody boy scout salute. Dean laughed again, closing his eyes and bringing their foreheads together gently with a relieved sigh. “I love you, Castiel Novak. So fucking much.” Dean whispered. He then pressed a kiss to Cas’ forehead, pulled the gun from the oblivious guard’s belt, and was gone.
Dean had risen when she entered, so she pressed the tray into his startled hands. Rowena sat on the bed by Cas and gave him a critical once over, moving his face by holding his chin, checking his eyes in particular. “Tricky business, electricity and the brain. But nothing we can’t fix. Does your head hurt?” Her hands prodded around the back of his skull. She pulled a jar of ointment from somewhere, rubbing it into his temple burns. The eyebrow twitched again in response.
“Buckle up. If we get into a high speed chase, I want you strapped in.”
“Stop moving, Cas. Just relax. We’re safe.”
They made it to the car without incident, thankfully. Cas poured Dean into the passenger seat, resuming his own. He buckled up and quickly drove off.
“Cas. Cas? Do you hear me?” Gabriel shook him slightly.
“Dean…?” Cas’ voice sounded hoarse and filled with pain. Dean leaned down for a brief hug of relief, then pulled back to look at Cas properly.
“I’ve been busy working.” Cas called from inside the room.
“Well, they did, and now they’re dead. Must have been traffic cameras again? Or CCTV? We did stop at another more modern gas station.”
“Cas! You should have been here by now.”
"Perfect. Come anytime. Can I keep these for now?"
“Good evening! Can I help you…?” He stared at the strange men uncertainly.
Dean sat on the bed, gently rubbing Cas’ hair. “Cas? Cas, honey? Time to get up. Time for court.” Dean saw the head shake a firm no. “Yes, yes, wakey wakey Cas.” Dean laughed as his attempt to pull down the blankets was stopped by a firm hold on them from underneath. Dean pulled them off from the side instead, revealing a very grumpy Castiel, glaring at him through one eye. Dean smiled back.
“This is what happens when you mess with a perfectly laid plan!” Cas pulled his gun out, waiting for his opportunity.
Cas snapped himself out of it, eyes locking on Gabriel’s. “Are you okay?”
Dean made brief eye contact before looking down at his hands in his lap. “I, might have, sorta, looked in on you during some of your jobs over the last few years. Maybe. Just to make sure you were all right. Even saved your ass a time or… five—“ Dean’s voice tapered off as embarrassment took over. Even his neck was red now.
Chuck scrambled behind him to lean his back against the low wall instead. He heaved a huge sigh of pain.
“Give me a goddamn gun!”
“Yes, my one and only.” Dean nodded happily to himself, as they followed Sam, Jess and Charlie to the car park.
Dean wagged his finger in Cas’ face. “You’re an annoying motherfucker, with all your rules and shit. I mean, if he can put up with that, he must really be an exceptional big brother.”
“How come you’re so afraid of them, if you don’t mind my asking? I know Sam’s fear is from watching the movie IT when he was too young. But you don’t seem the type to scare easy.”
“Mr Winchester is a contract killer facing two dozen counts of murder in ten countries. Absent a legitimate deal, he will never breathe free air again. Under no-“
“My turn to go first, Dean. And Cas can follow me?” Dean shrugged, motioning him to go.
“Patrick’s still alive, I saw him last month, which means you didn’t have a contract to kill him in Berlin. So what gives?”
A parked vehicle exploded beside them, flipping their van onto its side. It slid a good distance down the street. The other vehicles were unscathed, but were soon blocked in by cars at the front and rear, which unleashed a hail of bullets into both vehicles, killing many agents instantly. Gun men rained bullets down on the scene from balconies above while the Interpol vehicles desperately tried to escape. The street erupted into a firefight, with heavy casualties on both sides.
A tech tried to get Jody’s attention. “Ma’am, there’s activity at our safe house in town.”
Cas’ jaw dropped. They stared at each other for several long seconds. “What the fuck.”
“This isn’t a request! I am either taking you with me or I’ll stay here with you for eternity!”
“You shouldn’t be here. I made a deal and I must hold my end of it.”
“Then come with me.” As jack says this, he opens a rift that connects directly to the Empty. “You need to put the Empty back to sleep. That’s all it ever wanted. And all the other entities there will go back to sleep immediately. But make sure you have gotten Cas back here by then, otherwise he will go to sleep as well and I will have no power over the Empty after it has gone to sleep.”
“Are you sure you’ll be able to do this?” asks Sam. “I have to do this.” Says Dean.
“What am I doing here? I am here to take you back! That’s what I am doing here!”
Outside in the barn, Dean Notices Jack isn’t there. Cas falls on the ground and Dean shakes him to keep him conscious. “I am fine.” says Castiel, “The Empty took all my grace and now there is no way to recover it since it must’ve already gone back to sleep. I will be fine in a while.” “Does that mean what I think it means?” asks Dean. “Yes. I am now a human. I will live and die like a human.” “Well, if that’s the case…” says Dean, “Would you like to spend the rest of your life with me?” asks Dean with little smile on his face.
