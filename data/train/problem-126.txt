John sat on the middle of the sofa and fed Alfie while he watched Freya and Hamish play with a new science kit they’d been given.
“Yeah! And papa fell in the snow and you and me tickled him! Maybe this year Lottie can play too!” Hamish smiled.
“No. No, I know she will be thrilled – she’s mentioned Harry’s divorce three times and asked you if you’ve been dating twice. I know she wants you to settle down and be loved. I mean… do you think she likes me?”
“I’m sure. Just needed a minute here to recoup. Thanks for all that though. Getting her out. Being on my side.” John turned around and pressed a gentle kiss to his lips.
Hamish was just like John, very protective and caring – and he had seen a few of John’s nightmares in his time and always worried about him when they happened.
“Nonsense, you three have been very good this year. He won’t miss our house. Now, come along Hamish, let’s leave Ava and Amelia to get to sleep.” He reached over and picked up his eldest. Hamish wrapped his legs around Sherlock’s waist and tiredly snuggled into his shoulder.
“Thank you for coming with me, Sherlock.” John gripped his hand in the back of a cab as they pulled away from his mother’s home with a wave.
John, reigning in his fuming as much as humanly possibly in hopes that his son would calm down, went to find his husband and daughter and hoped the term ‘busy’ meant tackling a house fire or an army of rats or something equally, justifiably, busy.
“I’m not sure, we will see.” Sometimes John needed a day or so to get back to himself after a nightmare and a panic attach. And the worry of that tugged at Sherlock’s stomach, knowing that his children were so excited for Christmas and perhaps wouldn’t get to spend it with him in the same way they wanted to.
John cleared his throat a tad awkwardly “Well… you forget to eat otherwise.” He shuffled around to get comfortable and sighed gratefully when he found the right position “Night, Sherlock.”
“You’re very sexy when you take control, John. Captain John.” Sherlock said loudly and with a tone of delight.
“Mmm… Disguising the bald patch wasn’t as hard as we thought.” Sherlock smirked and pressed a kiss to John’s temple.
Harry’s head swung around to look at Sherlock “And you’re the detective guy! With the stupid hat. On the telly. You live with my brother? What’s that like? It’s been years since I had to, I always found him annoying.”
– and you went and became a Doctor. Then I didn’t want you to fuck off halfway across the world and get shot. And you did. And teen-you wanted to settle down with a wife and 2.5 kids. And here you are. Saying fuck you to your initial ideology and hunkering down with a dude and a life of criminal investigations. To be honest, John, it suits you much better.” She smiled and took his hand across the table “And I’m proud of you.”
Sherlock sighed “Fine. But you better fuck me now, so I’ll have the memory to keep me going during this farce.”
“No, it’s not alright. It’s your favourite celebration. And I didn’t even get you a gift.” Sherlock sighed.
“Oh. Thank you.” John flattened the woollen jumper he wore with a pleased smile. It was red and had white decorative patterns around the neck and wrist holes “I got it from Sainsburys.”
How Sherlock had got them the jobs at such short notice he’ll never know, but it was a great position to investigate from; they had the whole day to watch their client’s son, who seemed to check his phone at least once every few minutes. He was doing the photography for the event today.
“Careful now, Sherlock. That used to be my job.” John crossed his arms and leant against the arm of the sofa opposite the pair.
“Mmm.. Sher…” John sighed and reached his hand down to twine with Sherlock’s that pressed against his stomach.
“Quite right.” John raised his eyebrows, and Sherlock felt something in his chest ease at seeing John relax back into himself so quickly.
Classic Christmas tunes blared through the tinny speakers in 221b Baker Street and their annual Christmas Eve Party was in full swing. It was the place to be for lonely hearts and misfits alike, and residents Sherlock and John were for once in agreeance that it was a fun idea. Sherlock enjoyed watching the intricacies of social interactions and showing off his skills of deductions amongst colleagues –
“Yeah, yeah; it was right when I was feeling less overwhelmed. He’s uncannily good at reading people.”
Bo, short for Boudicca, was what John called “Sherlock’s shadow”. She loved watching and copying her Papa. They spent hours every day together, and for it her language skills and intelligence was through the roof. Her manners were… lacking. Despite John’s best attempts. But anyway, he didn’t like to nag her too much – he did find it adorable that the pair were like two peas in a pod.
“Sounds great, mum.” John smiled and took the tray of teas from her and placed it on his legs as he sat against the headboard beside Sherlock.
“That’s impressive, did you get tested to see if you were a genius?” she pondered and did the same curious head tilt that John sometimes did.
, I go mad at Harry’s behaviour… my mum and her friends all read my blog, and she really wants to meet you.” A flutter of butterflies flew through John’s belly. The thought of his mother wanting to meet his flatmate made him giddy in a way he didn’t want to over-analyse. Especially considering Sherlock didn’t seem to
“Come now, Tim, don’t you want some lovely presents this year? You have to be a good boy for Santa!” his mother tried to reason with him.
“But I was hoping, now the work is done, me and you might be able to finish what we started earlier? I’ve wanted to get my hands in this beard all day.” John raised an eyebrow and leaned down to kiss Sherlock, tangling a hand in the long white hair under his chin. Running his tongue gently across Sherlock’s cupid bow and then nipping his bottom lip and drawing a deep groan from the man beneath him, John knew his method of temptation was working. Sherlock wrapped his arms around him and pulled him closer.
Sherlock positively growled in excitement and pulled the back of John’s head down for a rougher kiss “A gift for us both.”
John sent an apologetic smile to Sherlock, who was looking particularly vague considering only a minute ago he’d been gasping into John’s mouth.
of December, Sherlock and John arrived at John’s mother’s small bungalow. She lived on a fairly quiet street and was stood at the door as the cab pulled up on the pavement.
What a sight to behold – Sherlock and his mum were sat at the coffee table in the living room. Both with a cup of tea, Sherlock was helping her wrap her presents.
After picking and paying for the best tree there (according to Hamish - Sherlock and John bit their tongues when they saw a lack of branches on one side because their son was so taken with it), one of the assistants put it through the netting tube and carried it to the jeep for them.
“For giving me this life. This family. You are the greatest gift to ever walk into my life.” Sherlock’s heart was all over his face, in his expressions and the eyes that bore into John’s own.
Sherlock sighed into his phone “Yes, Mrs Boyce. I’m quite sure your son has been using the money to indulge in his gambling habits. I know this is a shock. Yes, as I said, quite sure. Now, I believe my work is done. Enjoy your evening.” he hung up.
“Sorry, daddy.” Hamish jutted his bottom lip out which earned him a hair ruffle from Sherlock before the man shut the door and got into the driver seat.
Harry was a mess. Sobbing into John’s jumper two hours later, bags of her stuff scattered in the doorway. She didn’t even acknowledge Sherlock, just fell into John’s arms crying. John dragged her to the sofa and held her tight.
Sherlock strapped Alfie into his baby carrier on his chest and hoped he didn’t get too much drool on his purple shirt.
They spent a few minutes stood in John’s mum’s kitchen. John’s wet hands had left marks on Sherlock’s back but neither cared, just enjoyed finally giving in to their desires.
“Fine, but can we do it together?” John asked, resting an arm on the back of Sherlock’s kitchen chair.
“Mmm?” John asked, slightly distracted as he played with Sherlock’s left nipple as it hardened under his fingers.
“You’re such a smart young man I bet you were playing chess when you were little.” She smiled and moved her pawn forward two spaces.
Hamish watched in wonder as his parents lifted the tree into the stand, removed the netting, and turned it to an angle where the bare back was facing the wall.
The day went off without a hitch, which was shocking to all. Harry was blessedly sober and only sent a few harmless jokes John’s way. Nothing he couldn’t roll his eyes at. They ate dinner together and watched a few Christmas specials on TV. When the four retired to bed later on they were quite exhausted.
“We’ll be there soon.” Sherlock stroked a hand through her hair. He knew it was a lot to ask for a five-year-old to wait for her gifts on Christmas morning.
“I think we did a good job.” John said as he looked at the glow of the tree, basking in the warmth it gave the room.
“So did you at his age.” Sherlock said, gently bouncing the boy in his lap and stroking a hand through his short blonde tufts in hopes to sooth him.
Sherlock tore his eyes from his current scientific project and gave Arthur a curious frown “Oh no, did Daddy forget nap time is at two o’clock sharp?” he sympathised with his little boy, checking his watch that read 2:30, and pouted at the little one who was still crying pitifully into John’s shoulder.
“Alright, I’m coming.” John kissed Bo on the forehead and passed her to Mrs Hudson with a grateful smile.
“And I have six inches on you. So let me know if you require my assistance.” The smug look on Sherlock’s face only elicited a middle-fingered response from John before he left.
At the five mile mark John looped back around and headed for home. He felt good. The crisp winter air felt nice against his hot skin, cooling him down with the sweat that dripped off his brow. His feet pounded the floor as he pushed further on, breath coming out in a fog.
John blinked a few times “Yeah… yeah, needed to be done. Thanks, Sherlock.” He gripped Sherlock’s hand then looked to Mrs Hudson and Mycroft “I hope you don’t mind, I just need a few minutes.” He disappeared down the hall to his and Sherlock’s bedroom, the door shutting gently behind him.
“Huh?” John asked as he passed her the plate. Sherlock poured himself a coffee and sat opposite her and beside John.
“Finish that sentence and I’ll have you in rehab faster than you can finish that wine.” Mycroft interrupted.
“I know a lot of things. Because I observe. Also, it does help that John and I are intimately aware of one another; therefore, we talk about certain things.” Sherlock was well aware of the nastiness Harry Watson had projected onto her brother over their lifetime. The pair notoriously never got along and every time John had bailed her out she never learnt her lesson or extended a thanks.
“Absolutely not, we paid ten pounds for this – you can wait a few minutes for my son to stop crying.”
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s waist and watched him in the mirror “When you wear your nicer… people-mingling… clothes, I can never tell if I want to burrow into your arms and bask in your cosiness… or  rip them off of you and have my way…”
“Hmmm… watching now. Used to be doing.” Sherlock unbuckled his large belt and sat down on the sofa with a contented hum as the cushions enveloped him in their comforting warmth.
He couldn’t help the small smile that tugged at the corner of his own lips “Well… John is exceptional. Don’t tell him that though, his head will get so big I might not be able to get him through the doorway at home.”
Sherlock saw the frustrated look that fell over John’s face at mention of his sister’s ‘free spirit’ and gave Mrs Watson a fake smile to distract her from it “What’s the age difference between John and Harry?”
“Oh, don’t look so perturbed, John. I like your nose.” Sherlock said and strode towards the waving seventy-two-year-old woman.
John began walking Sherlock backwards to the other side of the kitchen doorframe and gating him in as they kissed.
“I know after what just happened you want the place to ourselves. But hey, we’ve got all day tomorrow for it.” He folded Sherlock’s collar down and did his second-to-top button up.
“No. I’ll just stay here a few hours…” Sherlock was already drifting off from the comfort of John’s presence and they both fell into a deep slumber.
“We’ve seen worse. And smelled worse.” Sherlock quirked an eyebrow at John before pulling out his magnifying glass and crouching beside the first body.
“It’s alright, Hamish, Daddy’s just having a nightmare. Go back to bed.” Sherlock said, trying not to let his worry about John’s harsh breathing show by sending a soft smile to the young boy.
John woke up earlier than his alarm on Christmas Eve. And it was to a warmth wrapped around him from behind, a soft breath on his neck, legs tangled with his own. And the feeling of something distinctive pressed against his back. John tiredly registered that his own cock was straining against his pyjama bottoms and, half-asleep, wiggled a little so the cock behind him moved to press against the cleft of his arse.
Sherlock put his and John’s plates in the oven and turned to the other two in the room “I imagine we will be back in a few minutes. Don’t let your food go cold.” And he followed his boyfriend.
John felt a shiver run through his spine and looked up at his boyfriend “Hmm… always ready for a gift from you.”
“Two years. She’s the older one. And just loves to boss our little John around.” Mrs Watson rolled her eyes fondly.
Donovan was first to find Sherlock in the backstreets of London. The Yarders, and John, had been searching for him for half an hour at this point. He’d rushed off after the serial killer they’d been investigating and been MIA ever since. She found him slouched in an alley muttering to himself and clearly trying to get the strength to stand.
Dressed for the day, Sherlock and John went to the living room to find Harry and Mrs Watson on the sofa waiting for them.
A spark of shock ran through John that quickly ignited his confidence, a confidence he hadn’t had around Sherlock yet – too worried that he would step over an invisible line between them. Too worried that he’d be rejected. It vanished in that moment and a smirk appeared on his face.
“Well, you’re single. Tracy is single and new to the area. I asked you to show her round, take her for dinner.” Mrs Hudson frowned, sending a confused frown to the three others.
“Papa? What’s that noise? Is Santa here?” Seven year old Hamish, their eldest, swung around the bathroom door, he had a smile on his little face that fell once he saw his Dad.
"Oh, darling! If you keep tying these in knots we'll never get this done." John sighed as he picked her up and watched Sherlock tackle the job of untangling.
Muffled loves were returned as Sherlock reached down with one free hand and stroked both of their hair.
“Yes. She’s quite taken with you. I think she’s really enjoying all your questions about my childhood. She loves reminiscing.” He finally answered.
“I know.” John’s eyes seemed to get caught in the memory of himself, naked but for the kilt, bent over a desk in their hotel room, being royally fucked into oblivion by the Detective. He cleared his throat to pull himself from the memory, readjusted himself in his underwear, and said “Keep looking.”
Sherlock shut the door in her face and hopped back upstairs. He was met with silence and the sight of John looking weary.
John pulled out a spare duvet and his pillow from his and Sherlock’s room and arranged himself on the sofa to drift off to sleep, Harry stayed up in his armchair watching an old sitcom into the early hours until finally going up to the spare room to sleep.
“No, we have been queueing for half an hour. I’m not letting some other kid ahead of us.” He turned to his son “Now Tim, stop this nonsense. You’re going to sit on Santa’s lap and tell him what you want.”
She rounded on him sharply “Your this one's brother, not John's, waistcoat boy, so keep your nose out.”
“Not at all. I thought the case held more intrigue than a simple gambling addiction. Perhaps the real curiosity is more in the mother and her well-hidden porn addiction.”
“To know what you want.” Sherlock stepped closer, if that was even possible, his chest now pressed against John’s side.
"Your son, Mr No-pudding-unless-the-broccoli-is-eaten." Sherlock exclaimed, referencing last night's dinner argument between John and Hamish.
“Yeah. I’m a bit exhausted after today. Not used to socialising this much. Want to just… cuddle?” John felt embarrassed just saying the word.
“But Daddy, we need to see if Santa has come.” Hamish’s little face was panic-stricken at the thought of his Daddy not being able to do Christmas morning with him.
John put his bag down on the table and came up behind him, wrapped his arms around his waist and rested his head on the back of his neck “What’s wrong?”
“Wow, those sound like fun presents. If you’re a good boy perhaps my elves will help me make some of them.”
“Coo-ee! Oh boys! Look at you both! Let me get my camera.” Mrs Hudson appeared in the doorway and disappeared just as quickly. She came back and photographed them together.
“This is nice.” John looped an arm through Sherlock’s as they walked past the pond in their local park.
“Why thank you, Gavin. Boudicca painted them this afternoon. She said the shade matched my eyes because of all the blues and greens.”
Sherlock had been reluctant to leave his husband’s bedside yesterday evening, but John blearily promised he’d be fine and that he wanted their children to have at least one parent to wake up to on Christmas morning. Sherlock agreed with that, at least, and had returned home and relieved Mrs Hudson of her babysitting duties. Not that she minded – she loved being ‘Nana Hudson’.
“Fascinating. Well, Harper, D.S Harper,” Sherlock was being sarcastic now – bitingly so “I do apologise for ignoring you in
After dinner, with lights and baubles and tinsel covering most surfaces of the home as well as the tree, Sherlock and John lay on the sofa with Hamish and Lottie in their arms. The two children were sleeping on their chests, exhausted from the day.
Mrs Hudson disappeared back to her own apartment for a video call with her sister and Sherlock and John plated up their Christmas Dinner. As John laid out some drinks for them and lit a candle, Sherlock disappeared.
They used their shirts to clean up the mess and as quietly as possible stepped across the hallway to the bathroom. They made quick work of cleaning themselves in the shower and brushed their teeth. With towels wrapped around their waists they snuck across the hallway once more.
“I’m sorry to startle you, boys.” Mrs Watson said from the doorway, looking a little shocked and worried.
Sherlock was awoken with a start by his husband beside him yelling out a muffled, strained sound. He looked to his right and saw a familiar but always upsetting sight. John lay on his back, face scrunched up in pain, fists clenched in the sheets, and breath laboriously exiting through gritted teeth. Sherlock reached out and placed a hand on his shoulder gently.
Both men’s eyes met in a comically wide look of shared shock. And just as the door was being pushed open they rolled apart.
They returned to the kitchen and found Mrs Hudson detailing Mycroft with a disturbing amount of detail on an old exploit of hers from the eighties. Sherlock smirked at his brother’s bamboozled expression and returned the food to the table from the oven.
From behind him Sherlock commented “How your mother thinks you are the most useful person to reach things up high in this house, I’ll never know.”
“Ah! You’re back! And with… a guest.” Sherlock looked up and put his tongs down on the fireproof mat John had insisted he use to save the kitchen table from any more marks.
“Sherlock! Thank God, we’ve been looking all over for you. You can’t just run off – you don’t even have a radio or anything.” Donovan crouched down to check on the man. She found him with unfocussed eyes and a lack of co-ordination “Sherlock? It’s me – Donovan. Are you alright?”
“Of course! Me and papa will have final say though – it needs to be the right size for the living room.” John reached back and tickled Hamish’s knee.
“Oi, don’t you know it’s rude to ignore someone talking to you.” The man stepped forward “Especially seeing as you're our guest.”
“No, I thought it’d be a nice surprise.” Sherlock smiled, then went to pick up his youngest child – a three month old baby boy named Alfie, who was fast asleep in his elf onesie. They weren’t sure whose genes Alfie had yet – he hadn’t grown into his features enough. With each surrogacy Sherlock and John had combined their sperm so it was chance who would biologically parent each child. With Hamish and Freya it had been immediately evident, but Alfie seemed to have a ginger hue to his soft straight hair, brown eyes, and soft features that hadn’t filled out yet to reveal many hints that weren’t more than speculation.
“Of course. We don’t want another trip to A&E now, do we? These will be great fun, I’m sure.” Sherlock grinned, already excited to experiment with them.
“Not this week, but we expect a few cases to come along very soon – Christmas and the New Year invites a lot of interesting domestic arguments and murders. Occasionally even interesting ones.” Sherlock bit a potato.
John smiled and tucked a curl behind Sherlock’s ear “I’m lucky to have him. And I’m glad he’s happier now than how he used to feel. People don’t really get him – he’s awkward and smart and a bit rude. But really he’s quite a sweet person. Don’t tell him I told you that. But yeah… I’m so lucky I get to be the one to give him the love he deserved all along.”
“On Christmas Day? Uhh… probably around eight o’clock. We usually do presents then breakfast, then a walk, then Christmas dinner prep and eating. And then lounging around in front of the telly. We keep it quite lowkey.”
“Better. Bit of a headache, bit tired, Doc says give it a few hours, one more check and I’ll be free to go. Which is all I really want. To be home with you guys today.”
When Mrs Hudson came upstairs they welcomed her with a drink and Sherlock kept her company while John watched over the dinner. Mycroft arrived just as John was plating up the dishes – his timing was both impeccable and creepy, as usual.
Sherlock heard a huff of a laugh from behind him and John stroked an arm down Sherlock’s side “That’s not what I want.”
“Hush now.” He whispered and looked over to the lump on the bed that was his husband. Still curled in on himself. Not a brilliant sign.
“Can’t believe it took you two so long!” Mike called from his spot by the fireplace, and quite a few other guests seemed to agree.
“For being so nice to my mum. I know you sometimes struggle to find the patience with ordinary people but-“
Molly made a hasty retreat to the lady’s toilet, sat down on the lid, and took a moment to have a little cry. She really liked Sherlock and thought that recently the detective had begun to warm to her. Now though, she realised that he was in such an improved mood because of his personal life. She liked John, he was kind and friendly, and they always had lovely chats when he visited the mortuary. But it still stung that the guy she was head over heels with was completely besotted with another.
“Seriously, it was bound to happen one year or another – I know you don’t care for these types of things.” John shrugged, looking down at his own hands which lay against Sherlock’s bare chest.
A sad smile swept over John’s face – he was well aware that many people didn’t take to Sherlock upon first meeting him. The man had a very small circle of friends, most of whom he had gotten to know and be liked by after a period of time. John knew Sherlock could be standoffish and blunt, and a arrogant with his intelligence. But John had quickly found that beneath it all the man had a quiet kindness to him. And the sort of soul that deserved to be loved. It was a shame not everyone saw it, but John felt quite lucky and special to be one of the few that could be there for Sherlock. And one of the few that Sherlock let see behind all his bravado.
“Thank you. Johnbo.” Sherlock smirked and John retaliated by sitting on his lap “Oh please, John, my legs can’t take it since that near-teenager, far too old to be at a Santa meet-and-greet if you ask me, sat on me.” Sherlock whined and wiggled his legs.
“I’ve called a cab; they’ll be outside in a moment. Come on.” Sherlock picked up the presents and led his children out of 221b and into the awaiting cab.
A groan reverberated from John and he lifted his chin to give Sherlock more access to his neck “I like everything you do.” He sighed contentedly.
“Is Daddy feeling better, Papa?” Hamish asked quietly as he was carried across the hall into his room, which was a dinosaur haven – dinosaur wall art, dinosaur toys, dinosaur bedding (Sherlock secretly wondered if his son would grow up to be an archaeologist).
“It’s fine – it’s rather romantic, I suppose.” Molly sent him what she hoped was an assuring smile before pointing at the door “Anyway, I’ve just got to go… print off a file. Sorry.”
“I got you this.” He handed over a neatly wrapped box to him “Well come on! Open it!” he smiled that dazzling mega-watt Watson smile, and Sherlock had to try and school his features away from shock and into happiness.
The room fell silent and Sherlock just held him for a few minutes. He rubbed his thumb back and forth on John’s waist in time with the ticking clock from John's bedside table.
“Our son is growing up, John.” Sherlock gripped the man’s coat in his fists and sniffled against his shoulder.
John looked up to find his flatmate just beside him, a glass of mulled wine in his hand to match his own one, and the slender gentleman was wearing a delicious red shirt that just looked devastating. His pale skin glowed under all the Christmas lights and John’s throat was dry.
They spent the day catching up, eating, watching crap telly, and Harry even managed to go to a meeting in the late afternoon. After dinner, Harry’s favourite – Spaghetti Bolognese – and a few more hours of rubbish television, Sherlock bowed out of any more socialising and retreated to the bedroom. The siblings could hear him playing his violin from behind the closed door and it was soothing to them both.
“Sounds good to me.” John pulled Sherlock fully on top of him and kissed him. Their tongues found each other, and hands languidly brushed up and down each other’s bodies. Shirts were hiked up as their abdomens pressed flush together.
“Yes, well perhaps next Christmas we will go to your parent’s. I’ll get a my own back.” John grinned.
“I know you’re trying to make up for the whole forgetting Christmas thing, Sherlock… but do you really think this is a good idea?” John bit his lip as he watched his boyfriend attempting to prepare the vegetables for their Christmas dinner.
“Yeah – speaking of – why are these randoms here? And you don’t even bother inviting your own sister to Christmas? What kind of lousy brother are you? After all I did for you when you got back from that war place.” She sauntered over to the table and sat in John’s seat, grabbing a potato and biting into it “Seriously, who wears waistcoats anymore? Who are you?” Harry scowled at Mycroft.
John raised his eyebrows “Well fine, I’ll wear the damn elf costume.” He grabbed the costume from Sherlock’s hands and marched to their bedroom to change.
Waking up with Sherlock in his arms was a level of bliss John hadn’t known existed. It was warm and comforting. And the smell of home that exuded from Sherlock made him feel relaxed.
Sherlock held him at arm’s length and said “Now remember, some children in your class may not have sussed it out yet – so don’t give it away. Your dad said that can be upsetting. Okay?”
They began their walk to the house, Harry’s arm looped through John’s “Yeah, his name is Sherlock. I’ve told you about him before.” He didn’t mention that most times he’d called her in the last year or so she’d been drunk. They didn’t need to start fighting already.
Sherlock pulled back and gave John an almost admonishing look “I used to struggle to contain myself when you came back from a run at home. But now I know I can have you…” he dove down and kissed along John’s neck.
“Sherlock!” John reached over and looked down to see the man he’d just been kissing in a heap on the floor “You alright?”
It was particularly joyous to see the look on Harper’s face outside when Lestrade said “Nice nails, Sherlock!” with sincerity and interest.
“I’ll have you know, statistically speaking, the majority of my fake flirting has resulted in acquisition of the required information. Not so rubbish now.”
When John was finally done with the shopping and had refreshed himself somewhat he returned to the kitchen to find his family much calmer than a few minutes ago. Arthur was asleep in Sherlock’s arms, his head lolled a little but cushioned carefully in Sherlock’s elbow.
“Sherlock Holmes.” The man beside her confirmed, watching Sherlock with a frown as he moved around the bodies. A snort came through the man’s nose and a funny look on his face.
“What if he saw you and daddy awake so he didn’t come in and he’s missed our house?” Hamish worried.
around the night before, family dinners, day trips to festive venues. But… ah yes, the Mitchell case had rather enraptured them both for the last few weeks – and John had spent yesterday sleeping off the many nights of disturbed sleep. So that’s how Sherlock forgot. There hadn’t been the usual lead-up forewarning him.
“Molly!” John exclaimed, exiting the cupboard while buckling his belt closed. He looked messy, his greying hair spiked this way and that, his shirt unbuttoned at the top and collar askew.
“Tracy here is staying for a coffee.” John smiled, then leaned in and pressed a brief kiss to Sherlock’s lips as he passed to the kettle.
“Sherlock?” he found the man stood at the stove in the kitchen stirring a pan. This was particularly concerning because he almost never cooked.
to be his bedroom. Now it was more of a guestroom slash storage room. But he’d taken a trip upstairs that morning to give it a quick tidy and change the bedding.
John felt something inside him lift and simultaneously break at that. Maybe it was the Christmas spirit, maybe it was the mulled wine from last night giving him a moment of impulsivity. But he stood up, marched to Sherlock in the armchair, pulled him up to stand and guided him into a kiss.
“Papa!” He was interrupted from his thoughts as his daughter burst into the room and jumped up onto his bed.
The couple in the cupboard could be heard scrabbling around and before Molly made it to the door to leave the mortuary the cupboard opened again.
“You are already on the side of the bed I’d prefer you to be.” Sherlock explained, resting his head into the big pillow.
Just as Sherlock came to terms with the fact that Christmas Day was, in fact, today, John came flying back into the room with a tray in his hands.
A deep hum sounded from behind him and a face pressed further into his neck. Lips pressed softly against his pulse point.
“Nah, nah, I’ll have some of this.” She grabbed the bottle of wine from the middle of the table, topped up John’s glass and took a swig “Ohh, this is lovely – you’re doing well for yourself John!”
Pulling open the door to the storage room in the mortuary, Molly was certainly not expecting the vision she was met with.
Sherlock stood and with a flourish pocketed his magnifying glass and pulled out his phone, tapping away “See if Molly is working…” he said absently to John while he crouched to have a look too, a grimace firmly in place at the painful injuries these victims had endured.
Sherlock was certain that picture would not be making the family Christmas card this year – judging by the faces of his parents as the camera flashed.
“Don’t think, John. Do.” Sherlock wrapped his arms around him and squeezed John’s pert arse in his hands.
“What else did you expect?” Sherlock called back from his spot in front of the bathroom mirror as he applied some make up to age his face.
“Well, I’m sure he didn’t mind – being dead and all.” Sherlock dismissed, almost drawing a bewildered chuckle from John.
“Well well well…” Harry Watson’s voice broke through their sneaking. The pair turned to the kitchen doorway to see her stood sipping a mug of tea and smirking “Have fun in there?”
“Donovan. You’re too good for Anderson.” Sherlock suddenly blurted and opened his eyes to look at her knowingly.
John rolled his eyes “Yes. But not to everybody. He’s a bit… standoffish, shall we say. Him and mum are getting along well, though.”
“Yeah, all good, mum.” He smiled and felt butterflies in his stomach at realising just how good he felt.
“Please, Sherlock. My closing argument is that Mrs Hudson is visiting her sister over Christmas and I don’t want to come back to a pile of rubble.”
“Okay, Papa. And don’t worry, Charlie isn’t awake.” Hamish said. Sherlock felt relief at that at least – if their new-born baby was awake he certainly wouldn’t be able to give John as much attention and comfort that he needed.
“Oh is this a relationship already?” the corner of Sherlock’s mouth came up in a smirk and John stammered.
“It was nice to meet you, Brie.” Sherlock said after the camera flashed “I hope you have a Merry Christmas!”
“That was on your behalf, Sherlock.” John said “You may not see eye to eye, but you care for one another – and he’s got you out of a few messes this year. It’s only right you give him a gift on Christmas.”
He thought he might be hearing some indistinct cheers and hoots but to be honest all John really heard was Sherlock’s lips and his breathing and his soft hums.
“Oh yeah. From the papers. Nice to meet you.” She looked around then at her brother “I’ll… I don’t want to inconvenience you. I’ll take the sofa.”
“Yet here you are.” Sherlock took a piece of John’s meat and winked as he took a bite. The detective felt pleased and smug at the joyous laugh that burst from John.
It was relatively busy this year, after the first Christmas Party last year had been a hit a few more people had the confidence to come to the event this year. Mike had turned up along with his wife, Molly and her new boyfriend of 2 weeks that she’d met online were there giggling giddily on the sofa, Lestrade had come alone, and John managed to interrupt his and Sherlock’s greetings before the consulting detective tried to discuss the man’s failing marriage to him. Mrs Hudson was the life of the party as usual – flitting about and chatting to everyone with enthusiasm. Mycroft had arrived an hour after everyone else, looking slightly like he was sucking on a lemon, but had taken up a stool by the window and was currently having what seemed to be a pleasant enough conversation with one of John’s colleagues from the clinic. Other than the usual gang, a few colleagues both from Scotland Yard and John’s part time GP job were in attendance, including Sarah, Anderson and Donavon.
“Why? It’s perfectly natural, John. You’re a Doctor, after all.” Sherlock frowned, leaning against the kitchen doorway and looking at his flatmate fondly.
The group mingled, drank, and were merry. A small handful of them even managed a game of charades, which Sherlock and John won (Lestrade had an unproven theory that the pair could read one another’s minds. That, or they were cheating. Lestrade favoured the former).
“Hear that, Sherlock? He’ll be here soon.” The alleyway fell silent but for Sherlock’s heavy breathing “So…” Sally said awkwardly “John Watson, huh?”
Harry and John offered to, and when they made their way to the kitchen she said “You still owe me an extra Christmas present.”
“Indeed. I’d agree it was a good lie. I was sceptical at first but once I saw how much you enjoyed the fantasy of it I let it carry on.”
“I’ve only got a minute – your mum thinks I’m in the bathroom.” Sherlock walked forward with his long-legged strides and pulled John into a kiss “Do you know how good you look after a run?”
“I’m teasing you. That’s what we do? And what couples do, right? But it’s kind of you to ask. As you may be aware – I am not greatly experienced in that area of things. Or relationships generally. I’ve done things, of course. But as I grew older I realised I don’t fancy it unless it means something… on an emotional level.” Sherlock explained awkwardly.
“Nah, there wasn’t a proposal, nor a proper wedding, so just never bothered with them.” John shrugged “Comes in useful in our line of work – the amount of times Sherlock has faked flirting with someone for information…” he chuckled.
John laughed “You’re mad.” He ran a hand over Sherlock’s curls only for the man to scowl at their sure disarray and correct them to their perfect place.
“Gave him a phone that you purposefully didn’t want because your wife inscribed it and at the time you hated her.” Sherlock ground out.
“Oh, it’s quite alright Mrs Watson – my brother once kidnapped John and asked him for money to spy on me. So he’s allowed such a well-informed opinion.” Sherlock raised a peace-keeping hand.
John huffed a laugh and got up to stand in front of the man. He pulled him down for another kiss, short and sweet and not going anywhere other than a place of comfort this time.
John grinned “Thanks.” He squeezed Sherlock’s shoulder as he walked past him, out of the kitchen to take a seat in the living room.
“True, and though she doesn’t know about just how much we are coming to mean to one another. She does know you’re my friend, and I’m yours. So I’d say your interrogations are more questions than prying in her eyes.”
“Harry, why don’t I get you some water?” John suggested, sharing a slightly worried look with Mrs Hudson as his sister picked up his wine glass and inspected it.
“This must be that guy Dan was talking about… the consultant…” John heard one of them, a tall woman, whisper to her colleague.
“But Papa, Ava and Amelia are awake too.” Hamish worried his bottom lip, referring to his four year old twin sisters.
“It has been! I don’t get to sight-see all that much, what with work and cases. So it’s been great to get out. Would you like to come in for a coffee?” John asked, gesturing to the door as they arrived.
“I’ve always wondered how good Three-Continents-Watson is under the mistletoe.” Sherlock’s eyes flickered down to his lips.
“Mmm… be careful, you’ve opened up a potential space for my bishop to move. And yes, I was playing chess with my brother from age four.”
“Harry’s alcoholism. Mum doesn’t like to acknowledge it and Dad was always a bit of a bulldozer when it came to things like that – he liked to tackle things head on. And Dad’s a big family man, so he never really understood me wanting to fly off to Afghanistan, or spend years living far away at uni training to be a Doctor when I could’ve done it close to home. Mum’s a bit of a secret adventurer though, so she fought my corner.” John smiled fondly.
“Oh wow! That’s a surprise… what’s the anniversary?” Molly forced a smile, though her heart was constricting at the news that the guy she liked was already taken.
“Busy? I’ll show you busy…” he whispered under his breath as he made it to the top, dumped the buggy, bag, and satchel in the doorway and then readjusted Arthur to stop his crying “It’s alright, darling, we’re all home now.”
“Thank God – I was worried he wouldn’t nap.” John breathed a sigh of relief then peered down at his husband’s hand “Oh wow, lovely job Bo! I like the colour.” He bent down and pressed a kiss to his daughter’s dark waves. She smiled up at him proudly as her Daddy praised her skill. She had been practicing nail painting for a while now, had a little stash of different colours in her room, and though she started off just painting her own nails she had quickly moved on to requesting to paint others, and Sherlock was always first inline to indulge her as usual.
“No, no, we’re sorry!” John raised his hands in surrender, his cheeks pink. Sherlock exited the cupboard to stand beside him, his trousers thankfully back up over his hips, but his shirt was untucked and there was a fresh red mark on his neck.
“He wanted to know why my marital status had changed. Apparently, he thinks society calls for a marriage to involve a big song and dance where we invite people such as himself.” Sherlock sighed into John’s neck.
This caught Sherlock’s attention and he looked up at the fresh faced officer, clearly unimpressed with what he saw.
“Because. Harry’s coming – so I need a buffer. If she gets drunk and ruins another Christmas I might just about explode. My mum is getting old now, and she hates it when we fight. I just want her to have a nice Christmas.”
They walked blindly back towards the hallway and disappeared into Sherlock’s bedroom with a slam of the door.
“Are you all on your own this evening, John?” she announced herself as she leaned against the kitchen doorway.
“Well, I’ll leave you two to it, let me know when you finish and I can see the full set.” John picked Arthur up gently to take him to sleep in his cot.
“That may be so. But okay. You’re an exception, John.” Sherlock snuggled up to John’s side, tucked his head into the man’s shoulder and enjoyed the feeling of the Doctor wrapping his arms around him.
“Indeed. My… my parents had to chuck me out about five Christmases ago. I visited, but I was high as a kite. Didn’t take them long to work it out.”
John huffed a laugh “Well, I’m not. I’m bisexual. And yes, I’m sure. Are you sure? Mr Relationships-Aren’t-Really-My-Area Holmes?” he raised an eyebrow.
“Oh! Oh dear, I am so sorry for this mix-up! And excuse me, but when were you two love birds going to tell me you were dating?! I’ve been feeling very sorry for Sherlock here, thinking he was besotted with you and it was unrequited! Little did I know!”
After many raised eyebrows and cheeky suggestions aimed at her 221b residents, Mrs Hudson had come to accept that John “not gay” Watson wasn’t in a relationship with Sherlock Holmes, and that her suspicions about the pair were unfounded. John frequently rejected her questions regarding his sexuality with “I’m not gay”, and besides that the pair were fairly independent, she heard them argue many times but over the time they’d lived above her she’d never even seen them kiss.
“Fine. But you owe me and extra Christmas present next year.” She smiled and turned back to the kitchen.
Sherlock cleared his throat and took a moment to think before he spoke, just like John often suggested he should. “Well, who do you think delivers your gifts?”
“All good, little brother!” she pulled away and ruffled his hair “Mum said your flatmate is staying with us?”
“I believe my legs might be too long for the sofa, John.” Sherlock interrupted “But I am amenable to sharing with you.”
Hamish disappeared and Sherlock sat down beside John, wrapped an arm around his back as he caught his breath. Sherlock had learned over time to let John work through it and just be there as he did.
“Thanks, Mrs H. And just so you know, you didn’t miss out on any big wedding. We went to a registry office and got it done quietly.”
“Ah, marvellous.” Sherlock announced as he swung into bed. They both wore soft pyjamas to keep them warm from the winter weather.
“I like your jumper.” Sherlock said, slightly awkwardly, before taking a sip of his drink and looking everywhere but at John.
As the day drew to a close, after what felt like a line of hundreds of children, Santa Claus and his elf finally climbed the stairs up to 221b.
Hamish pulled away with a curious look at the bed, which he climbed up onto. Kneeling beside John he poked his head slightly under the duvet to look.
He rounded the corner to the kitchen and what he found made his inner rage dampen instantly. Sherlock and Bo were sat opposite one another at the table, Sherlock had his head glued to his microscope, one hand adjusting the lens, while the other was splayed out across the table and in the careful hold of his daughter as she painted his nails.
After a day of chatting, hearty food, and photo albums - in which Sherlock actually took a few pictures of his favourite photographs of John on his camera phone to keep for his own amusement – much to John’s dismay, they retired for the night.
John groaned “I can’t let Mrs Hudson down, nor this niece of hers. I hated moving to London when I came back from Afghanistan. It’s overpopulated but lonely. It will be nice to show her a friendly face. Now,” He pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s lips then pulled away and sat up, straddling the man below him “I would invite you but I can already tell that would be a hard no. So why don’t you enjoy some peace and quiet with your Bunsen burner and that bag of teeth Molly has given you while I’m out. And eat dinner, I’ll be taking her… Tracy, I think it is… to that nice Italian-“
“Don’t be ridiculous, John. Christmas isn’t for ages.” But there was a pit in Sherlock’s stomach that said otherwise.
The three men kept their ears perked but couldn’t hear much, only about a minute of muffled discussion before two sets of footsteps came upstairs.
“Oh! No, no, we’ve been together ages. Usually, he’s very particular about not being distracted during a case. But… well, today is our anniversary.” John smiled up at Sherlock.
“There’s not much to say. I was a junkie. Now I’m not.” Sherlock dismissed the conversation and John knew not to pry more. They’d have time to talk about that another day, in the comfort of their own home.
“Not foolish at all.” John wiped a tear away and kissed his lips softly “You know, watching you become a father and embrace it with such heart has made me fall in love with you even more. Back before we had that little rascal, I was in love with you. A lot. Now, well, I’m in so deep there’s no hope for me at all. I’m a hopeless case.”
He unwrapped the box and inside found a few items. A framed photo of the two of them from their most exciting case of the year – they had gone all the way to Scotland for it. Sherlock’s lips quirked up at seeing John in the kilt, and in a photograph he could keep forever – what a treat! His boyfriend was incredibly sexy in a kilt, those gorgeous legs and such an ease of access...
“Yes, I plan to shower you with nice things all day. As you are aware, gifts do not need to be materialistic or have monetary value.” Sherlock pressed a kiss to John’s nose then grabbed his tea for him and pushed it into his hands.
“Your mate is coming, remember. I already said.” She held in a sigh, she hated talking to people when they were high or drunk.
Eventually it was done, but to say that Hamish was impatient to bauble up the tree was an understatement. The boy left the kitchen table three times during lunch, and three times Sherlock carried him back to his chair.
“And-and then I opened the calendar! And it was a picture of a snowman!” Hamish, 4 years old, stood beside John in the kitchen. The Doctor was at the sink washing up after breakfast while Sherlock was in the shower. Hamish’s little hand was gripped on John’s jeans.
Arriving at the pop up Christmas Tree Shop, Hamish had his face glued to the window. The venue was outdoors and there were row upon row of trees of all sorts of styles and sizes.
Sherlock huffed a soft laugh and pulled him in for a hug “Don’t be silly. Your Dad is King of Christmas. And he knows Santa isn’t real. We will still have lots of fun, eat good food, bake gingerbread men, put up decorations and get a tree, watch the movies you like. And you’ll still get nice gifts that you can open, but now you’ll just know it was from me and dad.”
“Of course they are, it’s barely ten o’clock.” John shrugged as he sat on the edge of the rumpled bed tying his shoe laces.
“Can you be a good boy for me and sit with them? I’ll come up in a little while. Daddy needs me for a bit, okay?”
“Right, Harry. I think you should go.” John said, already predicting the inevitable shouting match and thrown objects as was her usual reaction when she was this drunk. And he really didn’t have the patience for it.
“Good to know. I can think of other ways to get hot and sweaty.” John pushed Sherlock down on the bed and straddled his hips. Realising where this was going, they stopped for a moment and looked at each other a little breathlessly.
Sherlock stood aside with one child on each hip and watched as John and the man tied it to the roof.
They spent the morning opening gifts, John had got Sherlock some science kit pieces that he didn’t have at home, which Sherlock was particularly excited by. And Sherlock had got John a soft blue jumper that was surely worth about 4 times any other item in John’s wardrobe, and a book on blogging.
The image of John dragging Sherlock’s slack body out of the River Thames was imprinted on the back of Greg Lestrade’s eyelids as he walked up the stairs of Baker Street. Seeing the tall, snarky, intelligent man lying pale and cold to touch on the rocky shore of the river had twisted his stomach into knots. Thank goodness for John’s medical skill and strength, not only was he quickly retrieved from the water in which their murderer of the week had pushed him, but he was roused and cared for. Greg remembered running down the steps to get to them and seeing John with Sherlock’s head in his lap, talking quietly to him and the barely conscious man looking back with an expression of pure gratitude. It was late in the day, but he had promised to drop by again. Earlier he’d helped John get Sherlock to Baker Street (the man had refused A&E and John felt like he was fine to look after him himself) but had to go back to the station to write up some reports after. Once it was all done and Greg had clocked out for the evening, he sped across town to check in with them.
“You’re going to stay here a few days, recuperate. I’ll look after you. And we’ll find you an apartment close to your work. And Sherlock’s brother has some contacts, we’ll get you a good lawyer. Harry… you should also go to a meeting.”
“You guys are the best!” John gave them each an affectionate smile and pulled Hamish up onto the bed too.
“Indeed we do.” John smiled, wrapping an arm around Sherlock’s waist before pulling him towards the cab they’d called to go to Bart’s in.
John sighed softly “Well, if you’re so interested I’m sure she will crack open the family photo albums for you to have a look at my genetic line.”
Eventually John’s breath calmed and he unfurled from his curled up position and rested against Sherlock’s side, his head against his chest.
John sat in his armchair, texting a few responses to festive wishes from friends, when a long note was played by Sherlock on his violin. John looked up, and in front of the window frame stood his partner in everything. He was facing away, looking down to the street; back straight, posture perfect, a silhouette of beauty.
“An explanation of what exactly you two are. Certainly not just flatmates; I don’t think flatmates cuddle. Lovers? Fuck-buddies? Boyfriends?”
John laughed good-naturedly “Well,” he wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s waist “We got there in the end.”
Sherlock looked down and met his eyes which sparkled in joy. They met in a short kiss again before Sherlock squeezed his shoulder and announced “Perhaps some violin music to calm you all down from such an exciting evening.” He sent Molly a knowing look and she blushed with a grin and a thumbs up and a point to John.
“Well look at you, stood there having emotions for me. I’m flattered.” John pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s lips and stood back a step to give them both a little breathing room “So. Just for the next two days let’s keep this private. But I tell you what – I think my mum really likes you. And she’s always hoped to see me with a serious partner. So when we do tell her she’ll be thrilled.” John turned back to the washing up and finished the last plate.
A little smile broke out on her face, she watched them a moment longer and couldn’t bring herself to feel annoyed that John had lied. Or upset that she didn’t have that kind of love anymore. She just felt happy for him. The last time she’d seen her brother he’d been pale, absent and grieving for the life in battle he was snatched from too soon. Seeing him today had been a real gift, he was the John she’d grown up with. Happy, comforting, funny, annoying. He was John again. And she had a sneaky suspicion now that she had a lanky detective to thank for that.
John’s eyes flickered down to his bleary-eyed husband and mouthed the word “Harry”, he received a nod, then Sherlock pressed his face into John’s bare thigh and went back to sleep.
A few hours later John was cleared to go home by his doctor. When they arrived he received fuss from Mrs Hudson followed by stern instructions to rest this year while she got on with the Christmas dinner.
“Fuck.” Sally grabbed her radio and transmitted to the team “This is DS Donovan. I’ve found him. Back alley behind Wormwood Street. He’s been dosed with heroin. He’s conscious and talking but very lethargic. Over.”
“I know it was kind of like a lie, pretending Santa was real. But it’s like a good lie. Like when you pretend to be someone else to get information for a case to catch bad guys.”
John led her upstairs and opened the door, they found Sherlock in the kitchen leaning over a Bunsen burner, still in the pyjamas and dressing gown he was in earlier.
John’s heart clenched at the milestone that their son just took. He took a breath, then used his hand to untangle Sherlock’s from the wooden spoon and guided him to turn around and face him “It was bound to happen sooner or later.”
Pushing the door open Greg stepped into their living room and found the fireplace aglow and it’s warmth filling the room. The first thing he saw was John sat on the sofa in loungewear, and the second thing he saw made his eyebrows rise. Sherlock lay across the sofa, with his head resting in John’s lap. The taller man was wrapped in a duvet up to his chin and had John’s fingers tangled in his messy curls. He was fast asleep and thankfully had much more colour in his face than when Greg had last seen him.
After a few minutes he pulled away and tucked a stray piece of hair behind John’s ear “You are insatiable. Go and take a headache tablet, we’ll finish our tea, and then you can tell me what you want for Christmas.”
“Oh, of course not.” John assured her “I’m a very proud bisexual man, married to this handsome hunk of genius. Very proud indeed. We’ve never been secretive about it. To be honest, you tease us about it enough I thought you knew.” Sherlock smiled happily down at him at those words.
“Good boy. So helpful.” Sherlock ran a hand through Hamish’s curls then pressed a kiss to John’s cheek “Nearly ready to go?”
After breakfast and lots of looking around the tree at all the presents, Sherlock sat on the sofa with Charlie curled up on his chest, Amelia and Ava on either side of him, and Hamish sat in Sherlock’s old armchair, which was his favourite spot for movies. They chose Polar Express, a firm favourite amongst the children, and settled in for a quiet morning.
“They did at the beginning. But the worse I got, as the years went by, I think they felt like every time they picked up the pieces or let me get away with it they were ‘giving a drunk a drink’, as it were. So they were trying to pull away in hopes I realised how much it upset them that I was abusing myself in such a way.” Sherlock explained “And maybe without their help I’d hit a kind of rock bottom that would turn me away from the path I was on.”
“Boundaries? John, it was simply an experiment over the course of a week on sleeping patterns. And –“
“Yes, I know that - but add in the context of my own mother birthing me and it gets too much.” John rolled his eyes.
Their kiss deepened as they woke up. Hands searched over bodies and tongues reached out to play with one another. They were tangled together under the large duvet, feeling hotter and more urgent as time passed.
“You are beautiful like this.” Sherlock lay down against John’s side, rested his head on the man’s chest, and playfully sucked on his nipple. John lazily attempted to push him away, too over-sensitised to handle any more.
Mrs Hudson had been a massive blessing to Sherlock and John since having children; she loved being the honorary “Nana Hudders” and was always happy to look after the kids at short notice while their fathers ran off on a case. So that evening when a call came in from Lestrade about a mysterious house fire, Sherlock wasted little time in asking for her help.
“John dear!” Mrs Watson returned to the kitchen, freshly showered and wearing a lovely pink cardigan John had got her a few years ago.
Sherlock put a few gift bags under the tree, ones John hadn’t even seen in his hands until that very moment. He had put his own gifts under there last night.
“We’re well past the dating phase, Mrs Hudson. John and I are married.” Sherlock placed his hand over the one John had on his arm and smiled fondly down at him.
“Yes, but I mean to say – I completely forgot. I didn’t think about it prior to this morning. I… I didn’t get you a gift.” Sherlock said quietly, feeling his heart sink a little as John stopped flicking his perky nipple and looked up to properly catch his eye.
“You are a lovely boyfriend, Sherlock.” She went about making a pot of tea for the three of them “You both are of course! Much nicer than Mrs Turner’s married ones next door. All they do is argue with one another she says – she bets they won’t make it much longer and is already putting feelers out for new tenants.” She gossiped and they all settled into a comforting rhythm of chatter.
“I know, I’m sorry – I was looking forward to that too. But how about tomorrow I read you two stories?”
“I know, I know.” John waved his look away “Aside from being able to assist in defusing me when, and track record shows it’ll be
Sherlock took the chair beside the bed and got Alfie out of his carrier to perch on his knee and watch the present opening with those big eyes.
“Newly appointed Sergeant.” Sherlock commented to John quietly, making John roll his eyes. This was clearly an over-zealous and recently promoted officer who was a little too big for his boots.
John lay on his back on the bed, and what a sight he made for Sherlock. His lean muscular frame was completely relaxed into the mattress, his belly rising and falling as he caught his breath. With the distant euphoric look on his face, Sherlock was sure he’d made good on his promise and delivered the Doctor his very best blowjob of all time. Sherlock leaned over him and pressed some soft kisses around his face “Merry Christmas, John.”
“Jam on your toast, Harry?” John asked over the kitchen table. He and Sherlock had woken up before her this morning and were still keeping a platonic distance between themselves.
“And obviously I want him to grow up. It’s my life’s joy. And I wouldn’t have it any other way. But it’s just…”
“Six years clean…” Sherlock had a worried frown marring his usually calm and collected features “Want John.” He repeated.
John was sat in his armchair reading an old book and looked up in both surprise and excitement “Really? Where to?”
“John. I must tell you something.” Sherlock pulled back only slightly, enough to look into his eyes.
“Yep. First the chip and pin machine row, then the tag incident. If I’m not careful they’ll ban me from that shop.”
The note paused and Sherlock said “I’ve been writing this in my head all day, so it’s short. But this, Doctor Watson, is my gift to you.”
They were all in the twins’ room, all three of them in one bed excitedly whispering about Christmas. They looked so sweet Sherlock couldn’t help but smile – all in their matching elf pyjamas, Ava and Amelia’s dark waves slightly messy from sleep, Hamish’s blonde hair mussed up and cheeks pink with excitement. It was quite something to see, especially when he’d never imagined getting to have children in the first place.
December. He checked John’s phone. The same. But surely… it hadn’t come so soon. He thought he had a while before he had to partake in the slightly ridiculous celebration. He knew from the last few years that if there was one time of year that John Watson loved – it was Christmas. But where had the fuss been? Usually there were festivities –
The following day they made an appointment and went to the registry office to get married. It was quick and the only traditional thing they did was kiss after.
In the car, Sherlock leaned over to John and whispered "You looked so sexy lifting the tree onto the roof."
John twirled his fingers through Sherlock’s hair gently as the man slumbered beside him, his head on his shoulder. Their legs were tangled under the sheets and the morning light was creeping through the curtains.
“1 year married.” John grinned, wrapping an arm around Sherlock’s back. The taller man had a boyish, pleased smile on his face.
She left in a flourish and the room was plunged into silence as the door shut. Sherlock and John both sat beside one another in an awkward quiet.
“It’s quite alright, Mrs Watson.” Sherlock climbed back into bed, both men grateful their erections had made a quick retreat the second the kiss ended.
John pressed his lips to Sherlock’s softly before saying “Thank you too.” They rested their foreheads together and stayed like that for a while longer. Basking in the glow of the tree and their cosy little family too.
“You… hot and sweaty… wearing that tight shirt. I can see your muscles.” Sherlock stroked his hands down John’s chest appreciatively.
The day trip was lovely, John got to enjoy visiting the Victoria & Albert Museum. The Science Museum was just across the road but he was saving that idea for a date with Sherlock. They went to the Italian restaurant and ordered dinner, dessert, and got through two bottles of the house red.
“Me too.” John rested his head against Sherlock’s shoulder and watched their children chatter and play while smells of roasted vegetables drifted through their home.
“Your shoes are on the wrong feet, sweetheart.” Sherlock sat her on the sofa and knelt before her to help her swap them over.
“I know. I know, I will. Thanks, Johnny. This is real nice of you. And your flatmate… sorry, what’s your name?”
Lottie sat at John’s hip and touched some of the branches curiously. “Snow is falling… All around us…” John sang quietly into her ear as she touched the tinsel, mesmerised.
“Would you like to smile for your picture?” their suspect elf / resident photographer held up his camera.
“Hey, Tim, is it?” John crouched before the boy who met his eyes and sniffled furiously but nodded “I’m Johnbo. Santa’s head elf! And if you’re a very good boy we have a little goodie bag waiting for you after you’ve talked to Santa! Would you like that?” he smiled.
Harry tip-toed downstairs in the darkest hours of the night to get a glass of water, slipping through the living room to the kitchen and grabbing a cup, she quietly filled it from the tap then walked back towards her room. A shuffle came from the sofa and she looked over to see if her brother was awake only to see him tangled together in a mess of limbs, fast asleep, beside who she thought was his flatmate.
Hamish helped everyone find a present with their name on while John sat beside Sherlock and took Charlie into his arms for a cuddle. The three older ones opened up the wrapping and John watched with fond eyes, resting his head on Sherlock’s shoulder and taking a breath through his nose and inhaling that comforting scent “Thanks for letting me rest this morning.”
The question of what he was doing was soon answered as a classical Christmassy melody flowed from their speakers.
John snapped out of his daze and cleared his throat “Yeah – yes! It’s really good. Even better than last year.” He smiled.
“Okay, new Christmas plan then! How about we go and see if Santa has been, then we can have breakfast and watch a movie and maybe
John could see Sherlock tensing, so he approached the three “Hello there. I see your young man isn’t feeling in a very festive spirit right now. If you keep hold of your tickets, we’re open until 5 this afternoon and you can come back another time when he’s feeling a little merrier?”
John barked a laugh “Please, they just tell you what you want to hear because you’re attractive. Not necessarily because your flirting skills actually worked.”
Bo spun around from where she sat on his knees and grinned “Actually two!? Long stories – not little ones!”
“Oh. Well, we don’t really have that much excess food going, considering you weren’t invited.” John frowned.
“Uhh… well, it’s the twenty fifth of December. I don’t know what calendar you’ve got up in your mind palace, but I think it might be wrong.” John chuckled awkwardly “But anyway, you wait here. Don’t move.” He bounded up, pulled on a pair of boxer briefs, ones with little reindeers printed on them, and left the room in a flash.
“You two are maddening! I would have loved to see you both up at an altar. But if it’s what you wanted.” She pulled away, patted their cheeks fondly, then turned to her niece “I got my wires crossed here, sorry darling.”
They watched John’s favourite Christmas film, Home Alone, and Sherlock found it more amusing than he'd expected. On the sofa they leaned further into each other as the evening drew to a close.
“That’s a tremendous idea.” Mycroft cleared his throat “I’ve called for a car to pick me up, but I’d enjoy a piece before I go.”
“Off and on. Not as good as yours, I was surprised at how lovely your parents are together when I met them. But yeah… mine were fine. A few rough patches. But he looked after mum well, and she adored him. They mostly argued about me and Harry.”
“Well, you, Sherlock Holmes, are the gift that keeps on giving.” John sighed breathlessly as Sherlock breathed hard against his chest as they came down from their climaxes.
“Well, whether I move in my sleep is out of my control – but when I attempt to sleep, which you know I can struggle with – my preferred side is the right one.” Sherlock smiled and picked up his phone from the side table.
“Want to dry some plates for me?” John put a tea towel and a plastic peppa pig plate into his son’s hands.
“You fucking nob – John, dump him he’s an arsehole – I’m your fucking sister!” she shouted all the way down the stairs.
“He’s just up here.” Mrs Hudson said as she was followed into the kitchen by a woman with dyed blonde hair with dark roots. She wore relaxed trousers and a denim jacket – a christmas hat sat skewed atop of her head.
“But Daddy you were going to read me my bedtime story!” Bo pouted as John finished brushing through her hair after bath time.
“Yes. Your nose. It’s her nose. It’s very distinctive.” Sherlock opened the taxi door and stepped out gracefully, luggage in hand.
“Well we couldn’t very well do Christmas without you now, John, could we?” Sherlock rolled his eyes and put a bag of presents at the end of the bed.
Sherlock put him out of his misery “John Watson, I wouldn’t be so foolish as to kiss you for a second time if I wasn’t serious. Your friendship means too much to me to risk it for anything less than a relationship.”
“I didn’t know you were coming! Merry Christmas! I’m so happy you’re here.” John grinned, feeling his headache lessen just at the joyous sight of his family.
“That you star-fished in the middle, probably. Just as selfish unconscious as conscious.” John shrugged.
“And I’m also very excited to take you to your first pride parade!” she laughed at his expression “I’m just kidding – you’re so not cool enough to party with me.”
“Let’s eat breakfast. And then I’m going to give you the best blowjob you’ve ever had.” Sherlock said assuredly.
Pushed against the back wall, above a stack of latex glove boxes, all she could see was Sherlock Holmes’ bare backside. His trousers had fallen to his knees, his shirt was on and there were a pair of strong hands gripping the back of it. John’s recognisable shoes were digging into Sherlock’s thighs as he was in a lift above the floor.
“Not as far as I can tell. Will keep you updated though. Over.” She tucked her radio into her pocket and gripped Sherlock’s shoulder under her hand “Sherlock, can you get up?”
“Mmm. John Watson… John Holmes doesn’t suit him. Sherlock Watson doesn’t suit me. Double barrel… could be. But… no. My John Watson is perfect as he is.” Sherlock sighed without opening his eyes “Smart. And good with people. I’m rubbish at people. He’s good at everything. So good in bed.”
“I beg to differ – you’re always trying to feed me.” John could hear the smirk in the man’s voice and suddenly felt the realisation dawn on him just how intimate this situation was. He could feel Sherlock’s warmth, could almost feel his breath in the air. Just a few inches that way and he could touch him.
“Dunno, mum’s pretty relaxed – I don’t imagine she’ll mind if we have a bit of a lie in. But let’s be up by 9 in case she’s making breakfast. She’s a feeder.” John said as he switched his lamp off and plunged the room into darkness.
“It’s Christmas!” John sang softly into Sherlock’s ear, making the man shiver and then gasp and flip over onto his back to look at the blonde (not grey, John was adamant he was still predominantly blonde…).
“I got stuck at the self check-out again. And then we missed the bus.” John sighed “Can you take him for a bit while I unload the shopping and sort myself out?”
“I know. But remember,” he pulled away to look into Sherlock’s eyes “He could be forty years old. But he will still need us. Just like when I was out in Afghanistan and I had an awful day, a bomb destroyed a small village… it was just awful. And you know what? Soon as I could, I rang my mum. I still needed her, Sherlock. And I was a thirty year old Captain in the army.”
“Thought I’d come visit my little brother for Crimbo!” she pulled back, put an arm over his shoulder and looked down at the Holmes Brothers who sat quietly scrutinising her.
Mrs Hudson dove into some of the more interesting neighbourhood gossip which did a lovely job at stopping the brothers from arguing.
“I know. But he got a concussion yesterday when we were chasing down a bad man and the doctors want to keep him under observation for twenty-four hours.”
“I… uhh.. it’s fine. Umm. Sorry, I didn’t know you two were…” Molly gestured between the couple “Is this new?”
“Of course. I didn’t experiment on five turkeys over the course of a week only for the perfect Christmas day one to be ruined by a chill.” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Sherlock, in his usual whirlwind manner, left the room and John couldn’t contain his smile at hearing the great detective doting on their daughter as he dressed her in the reindeer fleece onesie Molly had bought for her last week.
“-and then Mrs Turner tells me her married ones are both cheating on one another behind the other’s back! I told her don’t you go getting involved in their private lives, they’ll figure it ou-“
“What the-who is that? Today of all days.” John frowned, put his knife and fork down, and stood to investigate.
Sherlock turned fully in his chair to face his son and took his small hands in his “Thank you for being so grown up about it.”
At six-thirty sharp on Christmas morning the house was awoken by a cry from the crib. Charlie was punctual, as always, and Sherlock pulled himself out of bed and shuffled over to him. The cries lessened to a slight mewling after he was picked up and soothed with gentle rocking.
John was scrubbing oil out of the frying pan when he felt a tall, warm presence appear stealthily at his side “You need a bell.”
“Alright, alright, enough of that.” John calmed them with waving hands as Sherlock stood slightly behind him looking rather vague as if not wanting to commit to an emotion in front of such a large group.
“-you only said ‘Nice nails’. I am aware. However, the tone in which you chose was not appreciated and your intention was clear. It is certainly something I could bring up to your senior officer. Now, that wouldn’t be very good for your reputation as a budding new Sergeant, would it?” Sherlock was towering over the man now.
“When is Harry due to get here?” John asked as he collected the dishes, briefly brushing hands with Sherlock as he took his plate. The brush of fingers sent a tingle up John’s arm and the two locked eyes.
A laugh echoed around the bedroom that was soon joined with a chuckle that devolved into the sound of kisses and whispered “I love you”s.
“Harry called. She says she just woke up. Will hopefully be here around 4. She’s getting the train – mind meeting her at the station for me later?”
“Alright. Alright, text me your address. I’ll let you know an ETA.” She rung off and John sent her a text with the details.
“Many reasons. You’re kind but stern. You are a Doctor who went to war. You’re homely but you’re an adventurer. You have so many brilliant attributes. You suit me and my life so well. When we met I felt comfortable with you incredibly quickly. I don’t… I don’t often get along with people that quickly.” Sherlock explained “Also I like your face. And your body.”
“She’ll have to bunk in with me.” Mrs Watson smiled “Which will be nice, a girl’s sleepover!” she grinned “Let me go put the kettle on and make us some tea. You boys settle in.” she left the room in a flourish of merriment.
“Perhaps not that big, sweetheart – we need to put the star on top.” John smiled fondly and shut the door. He got into the passenger seat, Sherlock was the driver of the two.
“Definitely – nice and neat, love.” John ruffled her hair fondly “Have you been having a nice afternoon?”
That stemmed the flow of tears and Sherlock pulled John in for another kiss then a tight embrace “Thank you, John.”
The day Sherlock and John got married was a fairly uneventful one. They had decided, after a rather frustrating night in hospital when Sherlock had been knocked out on a chase and John hadn’t been allowed to see him because “family only”, that it was the logical route for their relationship.
“Daddy, it’s Christmas. Are you feeling better?” Hamish asked gently, and Sherlock’s heart squeezed at the sight.
“Of course not. I had that secret rumbled by the time I was five. So yes, it rather lost the magic once I knew he wasn’t real.” The man climbed into bed and scooted over close to John “Is this… is this alright?” he put his hand across John’s waist.
“God, no. When I woke up and you weren’t there I did consider that marriage would make things easier. For a long time I’ve viewed you as my long-term partner, romantically speaking, sexually speaking, emotionally speaking. And a partner in our work too. I don’t see marriage changing things for us except for in a legal aspect.” Sherlock followed John upstairs and into the familiar warmth of their flat.
John heaved a breath and knelt down beside his husband “Let me have a look at you.” He began expecting Sherlock’s vitals and Sally got up to stand beside Greg. As she watched the couple lean into each other she queried “Did you know?” to her boss.
“So, what story tonight…?” Mrs Hudson asked as she led the little lady towards the staircase that led to her room. Arthur was already asleep thankfully.
“Despite my own belief system in these festive events, John, it may surprise you to know that I don’t wish to spoil it for young minds.” Sherlock said.
“John. This is… this is all so wonderful. Thank you.” Sherlock said sincerely, put the box of gifts aside, as well as the plate of slowly cooling food and drinks, and pulled the man into his lap and down for a kiss. It was languid and loving, and in the early morning quiet of Christmas day the only sounds were their gentle breathing and hands sliding across skin.
“It is indeed. I doubt you’ll have much trouble though, you’re incredibly adept in all other areas, John.” Sherlock said.
“Good afternoon. Tim, is it?” Sherlock asked, not feeling particularly jolly but trying to prove John wrong and maintain his ‘nice’ character perfectly.
“Listen, I’ll cut to the chase. I know I wasn’t invited. I know last time we had words. I said some things. You said some things. I get it. But Clara’s kicked me out again. Mind putting me up for a day or two?”
John struggled his way up the stairs towards his flat, a crying one year old in one arm, a satchel bag across his shoulders, three plastic bags hanging painfully from just two fingers, and a collapsed buggy under his other arm.
“Ah, was that the item you had to take back because the tag was left on?” Sherlock smirked fondly at the memory of John’s face when he unpacked that shopping bag.
“Very Christmassy.” Sherlock said and pulled his eight-year-old into his side, an arm wrapped around his shoulders. Hamish was the spitting image of his papa – blonde hair, dark blue eyes, upturned nose.
“Don’t be silly, John. You’ll always be my boy.” Mrs Watson stood, patted his cheek as she passed, and left to have a morning shower.
“But I care for you.” Sherlock said “And I always want you to enjoy the things you enjoy. To the very maximum.”
They were investigating a man who worked as an “elf” at a “Santa’s workshop”. His mother had come to Sherlock and John for their help – she was worried he was in some sort of trouble – having borrowed large sums of money from both parents and a sibling and now having gone silent on them.
“Yes, well, he’s my best friend. And he didn’t have any Christmas plans. Also, he has a habit of doing more dangerous experiments in our kitchen when I’m not there. So I dragged him along.”
“It is indeed. Father Christmas is a very busy man. I have to make sure he eats a mince pie and drinks his milk every day – otherwise he’s too busy planning for Christmas Day and he forgets!” John chuckled.
“Yeah! But daddy, I don’t want to watch telly! I want to be with you!” Hamish gave him those big wide eyes that John couldn’t say no to.
Sherlock smiled at the boy sat pulling out lego pieces from his new set “He gets it from you.” Which drew a smile from John.
Sherlock sighed, a little too dramatically for John’s liking, but nodded “At the least it’ll get Mycroft off my back, he always badgers me to visit Mummy and Daddy – it’s his turn this year.”
“Okay.” Hamish nodded, leaned over John to give the duvet lump a hug then climbed off the bed to lead the family to the living room.
Hamish was quiet for a moment, just looking across the table at his father’s many experiments “Pa, is Christmas not going to be as fun now I know?” he worried.
“I told you the other day. Mrs Hudson has asked me to befriend her niece, show her the more… youthful sides of London. Make her feel at home here.”
“It should be – Sherlock’s been experimenting all week on how to make the perfect turkey.” John chuckled, fondly looking at the man beside him which earned him a pleased smile.
“Exactly!” John was smiling now; glad they were on the same page “I don’t need to marry you to know we love each other. Or that you’re it for me. But it may just make a few things easier.” He went to the kitchen and flicked the kettle on.
“Fair enough. I suppose the quicker we go out there the quicker we can direct this party to it’s end. In a polite manner, of course.” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Ahh, a mission of ample importance.” John nodded seriously, leant down and pressed a kiss to his mouth. As their arousal dissipated they both settled into more of a cuddle.
“I think mid-afternoon. You know her though, she’s a bit of a free spirit! So we’ll have to wait and see!”
“That you have.” John chuckled, running a hand through Sherlock’s curls fondly “Totally blew my box of gifts out of the water!”
John left Sherlock and his mother back at the house and took a short walk to the station, he was only waiting around for ten minutes before the train pulled in. Harry Watson hopped onto the platform, spotted John immediately, she scanned her ticket before running over to him.
“Merry Christmas, John.” Sherlock stepped into the room with Hamish by his side and Alfie on his front.
They spent the morning unwrapping gifts, the children playing with them as they did, and as the room filled with their chatter and laughter John felt ten times better than he had earlier that day when the room had been silent and cold without them all.
“It’s alright though, statistically your flirting skills work on me 100% of the time.” John grinned and leaned down to press a kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
“My pleasure.” Sherlock grinned “I do think I’ve quite made up for not knowing it was Christmas when I woke up this morning.”
“No…” sniffle “I… We had a huge fight last night, I fell asleep on the sofa. And she just woke me up and told me to go. She’s getting the papers as we speak. I can hear her on the phone. Fuck. Johnny, what do I do?”
“Well… sad because I like Santa. And it’s sad that he’s not real. But… it kind of means you and Dad are like Santa. And it’s really nice that you get me all those presents.” The boy reasoned.
“Well, I don’t think they had to worry. From what John tells me you and he were fast friends the day you met.” She smiled.
“Yes! Yes!” Hamish wiggled excitedly and John made a beeline for the 6ft tree section, bouncing his little girl as he walked which made her giggle.
“Today was alright. Are you looking forward to tomorrow?” John asked from under the duvet as Sherlock pulled on his pyjamas.
“Mhmm. Husband. We’re going to be together. When we’re old. I’m going to keep bees.” A frankly delirious smile graced Sherlock’s face.
“Nice nails.” The man finally spoke up in a teasing tone, a critical eye attached to Sherlock's turquoise nails.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and tried to bite his tongue, wanting to just tell this child’s parents to take their distressed child away from him and his sensitive ears.
“Well, magic isn’t real. And I can’t find any scientific evidence that would allow him to get to all the children’s houses in one night. Even with time zones. And also sometimes children are really good, and they love Christmas, but they don’t get presents because they don’t have money. But that doesn’t make sense because it’s Santa – he shouldn’t care if they have money or not. Also people say elves build the toys, but last year I got lego, that’s a toy you buy in shops.” Hamish listed his reasons with a little frown between his brows.
The pair took turns in the bathroom preparing for bed and Sherlock was last out. John was lying in bed, on the left side, snuggled under the duvet and leafing through his most recent novella (he gave up reading anything longer than 1 or 200 pages a while ago).
“Well… I suppose.” John ruffled the hair at the back of his head as he inserted the key into the lock “I just don’t see us as the demonstrative, big wedding, kind of couple. Unless… do you want that?”
– and John enjoyed spending time with people other than just Sherlock (though he did enjoy spending time with just Sherlock a lot too, not that he thought about that too much… or every day…).
“Oh Santa, I’ve been ever so good this year. Can I have a ride on your sleigh?” he sauntered over to the man sat in his armchair and sat across his lap.
Sherlock came to sit at the edge of the bed “Yes, Daddy had a nightmare. Santa hasn’t been yet so you have to go back to sleep.”
“Isn’t this supposed to be romantic?” Sherlock mused as they climbed out of the cab, John had just suggested they become husbands.
“Brilliant. Mum and dad would’ve had a field day if they were alive. Their perfect Doctor soldier Johnny a-“
Once they’d parked up and got out the car, Lottie in John’s arms and Hamish on Sherlock’s shoulders (it was apparently the best viewpoint, according to the young boy), the family of four went through the entrance and wondered around.
Sherlock looked down at his daughters who looked equally concerned that they’d be opening their stockings without John there.
“Merry Christmas, mum!” Harry wrapped her up tightly back and Sherlock stood on the other side of them watching curiously.
“Yeah, maybe! Why don’t you go and watch telly with her while I finish up here? And we are going to go and get our Christmas Tree soon! Won’t that be fun?”
territory. But let me clear something up for you. I am a guest here, yes, but a welcome one. I am called when the police are out of their depth. My friendship with the Inspector has little to do with why he requests me and more to do with a quick resolution on troubling and tragic cases. Additionally,” this new sergeant was looking more chagrined by the second “you may want to keep in mind that part of your requirements as a police officer is to not make nasty, bullyish comments regarding a person’s preferences, such as gender expression, fashion, what have you. Quite the opposite, in fact.“
“Ohh, yes.” John sighed happily and climbed off of him to go to the medicine cabinet “What about the ears?”
Without much thought, simply moving with the moment, John turned around in Sherlock’s arms and was met with an equally semi-conscious but contented gaze. Their lips met and a breath left both men, a sigh of relief mixed with desperation.
Freya ran into the room, a sparkly red dress on and matching pumps. She was Sherlock’s biologically – and it shined through in her grey eyes and dark curls that fell around her face.
“Both of us? I can sleep on the sofa, mum.” John said as Sherlock put his suitcase down at the end of the bed, which was adorned with a duck egg blue duvet that looked so cosy all John wanted to do was face-plant into the thing.
“Managed to persuade Lestrade to dig around for some good cold cases for you. For when you get bored.” John smiled.
“John-o!” she cried jovially “How you doing mate!?” she surged forward and enveloped him in a big hug which he slowly returned.
“Anyway, this barbie… I’ll relay your requests to my elves and see if they can make one for you. But you have to be good for your parents. Can you do that?” Sherlock smiled.
John tucked his phone away and watched as Sherlock turned to face him and began playing a beautiful peace, filled with those trademark Christmas stylings that John loved in music, and underpinned by the most romantic sway he’d heard in a long time. And it was all for him.
“Hey, Mishy, come show me your new lego.” The kid scrambled up and stood in front of John to show him the pictures on the box and all the bits he needed to build.
The trio shared breakfast in the small kitchen, Mrs Watson excitedly asking them about cases. John and Sherlock spent the meal mostly distracted by her questions and the food. As their plates cleared John said “I’ll wash up, mum. Thanks for breakfast.”
“What?!” he snapped into the speaker as he answered, and John tried to hide his grin at Sherlock’s befuddled and half-asleep expression “Mycroft, what do you want?... Yes, what of it?... Why would I need to inform you?... I’d suggest you keep your nose out of my business and get back to work.” Sherlock hung up and put his phone back.
They both seemed to move at the same time, mouths smashed together, hands pulled desperately at t-shirts.
Arriving back at Baker Street was a bit of a mission. They had to take the children in and have Mrs Hudson mind them while they returned to the car to attempt to get the tree down and upstairs.
“You’re meant to be asleep.” Sherlock used his pretend stern voice and three pairs of eyes snapped to him.
“Baubles, Hamish. And you can, but after lunch. The tree isn’t going anywhere.” He assured him and gestured at the plate for Hamish to return to.
Christmas day was turning out to be rather a success. John had woken up with Sherlock wrapped around him like the sleeping limpet he always was, they’d had breakfast and exchanged gifts. After a shared shower (that left both men relaxed and sharing smirks for a good hour after) Sherlock pottered around the kitchen experimenting while John read a book in his armchair under the twinkling lights of the Christmas tree beside him. By mid-afternoon Sherlock’s experiments had been packed away to make room for cooking Christmas Dinner. Joining them for the celebratory feast was Mrs Hudson and Mycroft; Mr and Mrs Holmes had gone away for Christmas and John had felt bad for the elder Holmes brother and invited him to dinner at 221b, much to the exasperation but eventual acceptance of Sherlock. The detective agreed deep down. He just liked to be contrary when it came to his brother.
“We aren’t arguing about this again, Sherlock. But thank you, I’ll room with you.” He dumped the duffel on the bed and sat on the springy mattress “Where’s Harry gonna sleep tomorrow?”
Greg laughed at that “Fair enough.” He watched the pair for a few moments before saying “Well, I’m happy for you. I remember when I first met Sherlock – fresh out of rehab and gasping for a hit or a puzzle. He’s changed a lot over the years. But since he’s had you, I’ve never seen him so happy. And settled.”
“This gathering is going quite well.” Sherlock said into John’s ear as the shorter man leant against the kitchen doorframe and watched his friends having fun.
“I just assumed as he is so upset you may want to take a breather. Perhaps you’d like to wait to the side and let another child or two meet Santa while he calms down?” John smiled, while inside he just wanted to swing at the man. The day had been long and loud and this boy was surely the loudest wailer in the shopping centre.
Greg nodded. After a few minutes watching the crackling fire he turned back to the couple and queried “You don’t wear rings?”
“Brilliant!” Sherlock practically jumped for joy, much more on board with visiting John’s mother for Christmas than he was five minutes ago.
“Oh. Uhh… Well, she knows I’m bi. And I don’t think this would come as a shock. But maybe… yeah, maybe we should keep it between us just for a little bit? Not because I’m ashamed. Hell no, as soon as we have had some time to ourselves to get used to this new thing between us, well – I’ll be proud to call you my partner in more than crime. I just… I just want to get comfortable with us first. I don’t fancy my mum asking me twenty questions about it when we’ve not even slept together.”
After a brief tour of the home, mostly for Sherlock’s benefit, she showed them into the guest room “You’ll be here, if that’s alright.”
“Indeed. So. Let this be a valuable lesson. Stay out of my way, and keep that over-inflated head of yours attached to your shoulders.” Sherlock stared the man down for another moment before waltzing out in search of Lestrade to update him on his findings.
“Is this your father?” Sherlock held up a picture of a young man with John’s more sterner features, such as his eyes.
“These are a rare poisonous plant from Afghanistan. Got a mate to bring some over when he visited on leave so you can experiment with it. Though, nowhere near food, please.”
“A snowman? That’s cool! Do you remember when me, you, and papa made a snowman last year?” John smiled fondly down at his and Sherlock’s little firecracker of a son. His curly blonde hair was constantly messy recently, the child ‘too busy for a hairbrush, daddy’, and it shook as he nodded excitedly.
“You like…?” there was the flutter of butterflies again as John stared after the man. He briefly raised a hand to touch his nose, then shook his head and followed the detective to hopefully stop him talking to his mother about noses and genetics before she even invited him over the threshold.
John pulled him into a hug “It’s normal to feel this way. We’ve had so much fun at Christmas, it’s one of his favourite events. And it may feel a bit differently from now on. But hey, it’ll still be special and warm and homely and festive. Just like it always was.”
Sherlock pulled his face out of his microscope lens and looked to his left to see his 9 year old son stood beside him nervously. He was the spitting image of John, blonde hair, stormy blue eyes, that upturned nose. But he had the curiosity in his face that reminded Sherlock very much of himself.
Molly finally managed to snap out of her shock and quickly retreated, shutting the door behind herself.
Sherlock nodded and continued to kiss him as John pushed Sherlock’s, and his own, bottoms down to free their leaking cocks. He wrapped his hands around them both and used their pre-cum to slick them up as he jacked them off.
“That was wonderful, my love.” He took Sherlock’s violin, placed it down on the living room table gently, then pulled Sherlock towards him and held him in his arms.
John felt as if Sherlock had reached into his chest and squeezed his heart just at the sheer sincerity and beauty of those words “Wow… Sherlock… That means a lot. And agreed. I mean… I’ve had feelings for a while. Didn’t want to act on them because I didn’t think you’d want to… but you do. Clearly. So…”
John tried to talk back but only mumbled some unintelligible words before giving up and shutting his eyes.
Twirling lights around the tree took about twice as long as it should have because Lottie kept stealing them and tangling them up.
“Good. I’m glad. I… I’ve never had to get anyone presents before, so…” Sherlock trailed off and looked down at the science kit in his hands awkwardly.
“Was my cock against your back this morning not enough of a clue?” Sherlock whispered in his low rumble that sent blood straight towards John’s cock.
Sherlock didn’t notice Hamish leave the room (the boy had definitely mastered the art of sneak, and Papa was proud). Spotting the empty seat, he placed Charlie into his bouncy chair and went to investigate. Pushing his bedroom door open, he found a sight for sore eyes. Hamish was lying under the duvet with John. The Doctor had uncurled himself and lay on his side facing his son, who held a big storybook in his hands and was reading aloud to him.
A few of the forensic team were pottering about attaining evidence, and two uniformed officers stood in the corner of the room. They were new, clearly, fresh faced and a little keen.
“Take me to bed?” John whispered, and Sherlock needed no more instruction. He hauled John up and helped him limp back to their bedroom. He guided the man into the bedsheets tucked him in before bringing him a glass of water which John took with shaky hands. After a few sips, John pushed the glass into Sherlock’s hands and curled onto his side, burying his face under the covers.
