“Some people don’t get here by wisdom or by accident,” Remiel said softly. “Most of the people here, they come to Wonderland through a door. Some are dying. Some are in comas. Others drop by according to the rhythms of their illnesses.”
This was a longer speech than Sam had expected. "So you think our situation is better, where people are constantly telling us how we were born to be these vessels and play this predestined role? We hate that. We complain about this fate business all the time."
"Deliver this to Balthazar, please, but not until I have my two new playthings ensconced in their boudoirs, He's going to move Heaven and Earth to get his true love back." He paused thoughtfully. “Or will he?"
The boys surveyed their attackers dumbly.
“No, no that happened,” John clarified, “Ellen called while I was in LA, said she had an issue at the bar and I offered to help. Flew in after straightening things out and we…ended up spending the weekend together.”
The music faded and reopened. The lights dimmed and brightened again in the exact center of the stage, a soft white-blue. Castiel stepped up to the mic and opened his mouth to sing.
Dean shrugged and looped an arm around him, drawing Cas toward the next bin in line.
Dean just grinned at him.
“You really got a lot of useless crap up in that noggin of yours now, don’t you?” Dean says.
They go to the bar for more drinks halfway through the final game. They’re losing again, but Castiel honestly doesn’t care because he’s content to be here with Dean despite everything, drinking and laughing carefree like old friends. He wishes it could last.
“Oh…that feels wonderful,” Castiel murmured sleepily. He shifted under Dean, finding a more comfortable position and then sighed again as Dean’s hands slid from his shoulders to his lower back.
?” he read aloud, looking up at Dean’s father.
The two turned to him and stared like the thought had never occurred to them. Then Ed raised his gun and said, “Where do you think you’re going!?”
He stopped in front of her and held out the drink.
! What have I said about sneaking up on people?” Dean reprimanded. He leaned back in the chair and fought to keep a straight face, fought to calm the heat that was rushing to his cheeks for being caught thinking about
A surge of desire shot through him. He pressed his body firmly up against Castiel, gripping him a little tighter.
Cas followed him moments later, slamming the hand with the ring against the headboard and swooping in low to murmur in Dean’s ear.
“And what reason do I have to take you at your word,” he asked, his voice rising in anger, “when you lie so easily?”
A/N: I'm super excited to introduce Charlie into this fic! Whoo~
you!”
was why Dean wanted him to be its first guest. He didn’t say he wanted Cas to be his
As far as Dean knew Zachariah had never made any advances toward his little brother, but that may have been out of self-preservation rather than disinterest or lack of opportunity.
Dean sat at his desk in his office nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee. He stared blankly at the report in front of him—the projected figures for the end of the quarter—and tried once again to make sense of them. He took another slurping sip of the dark bitter brew. The numbers on the page swirled in front of him, blurring into one large, jumbled mess. He had absolutely no idea what the fuck he was doing.
“Ahh…” Castiel replied eloquently a beat later, “Yes, good… Good idea. Thank you.”
And Claire.
Dean chuckled lightly.
“It’s fine, Dean,” he said. He turned to Samuel, who kept glancing over at the place where their hands were touching. Castiel felt his cheeks burn under the scrutiny, but refused to move it away. “I don’t believe in established gender roles,” Castiel told him, “I feel they are unhelpful for a person’s development. I am far more interested in being true to myself than I am attempting to fit into society’s misconstrued concept of who I should be.”
John pushed up from the table.
“Claire. It’s nice to meet you,” Jack said brightly, sticking out his hand.
“I—I come here every day,” Castiel blurts out. He turns on his heels so that he is facing Dean still as he heads for the door.
“I’m not upset with you, Dean,” Cas replied. “Merely…disappointed.”
your God,” Brian said angrily, shrugging off Dean’s hand and stepping up to get right in Cas’s face. “Why didn’t anyone show up when
Castiel thought about it for a moment.
That isn’t possible… is it?
“If I wake up, come find me,” he said.
“B-bobby,” Dean stuttered helplessly, “Come on.” Bobby just shot him a steely look and raised an eyebrow. Dean sighed and gave up the gig. “Ok, fine. You got me. Since when have you known anyway?” Dean asked him.
Dean had his head back and his eyes closed. One long, oscillating moan streamed from his mouth, wide open and gaping. His voice pitched higher the closer he got to orgasm, and it had Castiel’s cresting with him, riding a tidal wave of ecstasy that left them shipwrecked and trembling together on a billowy beach of Egyptian cotton made damp by their sweat.
“Anyway, I’m getting this one,” he said again. He didn’t explain why. He had plans for that bag of candy.
“Nicknames or cruddy t-shirts?” Dean asked, because he needed the clarification. “But I mean I guess either way I wouldn’t have a clue.”
Dean grinned shamelessly to himself. Oh, there was
Dean met the eyes of Castiel’s father with a fierce glare, his jaw working as he did his best to keep his anger in check.  William seethed silently back at him, his eyes narrow slits. He looked as though he might launch himself at Dean from across the room at any moment. Dean kind of wanted to see him try, but then he remembered what Sam had said about not punching the guy.
Castiel nodded and seemed to ponder that.
“Go ahead,” Dean dared him, “Prove me right. But don’t expect me to come crawling back looking for your forgiveness because it won’t fucking happen.”
The wiry Asian man was also a shrewd businessman who spoke in short, clipped, direct sentences. Growing up in Hong Kong and learning English as a second language hadn’t set him back at all. It was simply another tool for him to use. If he didn’t like what he was hearing, he pretended not to understand the conversation until the tune changed.
!” Harry said in a bad Tony Montana impression. He held up his gun with a dramatic flair. It was attached to him via a blocky cardboard backpack that was designed to look like some kind of technology and a cut-off extension cord. Both he and Ed wore matching tan jumpsuits.
Castiel shot him a questioning look but did as he requested. Dean dug around in it for a moment. He came out with the Chinese finger trap, then leaned over and lowered the bag back to the floor.
“He’s telling the truth, Sam,” Castiel assured him.
“Thank you, Jack. Come, let’s clean up and then perhaps I can show you the
“Uh…opera?” Dean answered. There was a surprised bark of laughter at the other end of the phone, and Dean rolled his eyes. “Shut up, Sammy.”
“I—what should I call it?” Castiel asks, confused.
“How do you think?” Castiel replied.
Dean snorted. “What a dick,” he said, “I mean, what we do is none of his business.”
“He’s still a bit shy,” Em explained. He turned to Justin. “So, Justin, how’s your hand feel this morning?”
Dean trailed his fingers down the side of his face and called out to him softly.
It surprised Dean how much he knew about running his father’s business from the few months trailing him around to meetings. He actually felt like he could do this, for real.
“I’m…sorry,” the angel returned.
“Anna, get out of my way,” he said. He seemed calm, but there was a line of anger in his voice.
Sam patted him on the shoulder and walked back to the room, leaving him alone out in the parking lot.
sexy. In a rough, half-unshaven, hair-mussed sort of way. Tie askew, shirt ruffled and partially un-tucked. Zipper accidentally fallen open. Or tugged down.
Dean drew a breath and tried his damnedest to hit the mark gently.
“Thank you, Dean, that is… sweet of you to say.”
“He cares about you,” Sam said quietly. “You’d have to be blind not to notice it.”
“Not what I meant and you know it,” Sam said. “I mean, since when do you bring someone back to your place and not try and get in their pants?”
besides—a bright green planting, bursting with the desire to grow into the Redwood he was always meant to be—and place the entire fragile thing in Dean’s hands. He wasn’t conditioned for that level of trust, not when he had been burned so badly before.
Dean slipped his hands inside of it and pulled him closer, pulled him off the bench and onto the bottom of the boat. Cas made a small muffled
On her second trip back with an empty tray everyone was all of a sudden shouting. Charlie looked back and saw the ball starting to drop on-screen Dean’s bigass television. She glanced back to Jo and joined in the fray.
“Casual Tuesday,” he replied, holding up the badge for her.
The next few hours were pretty much torture for Dean. He passed the time playing
“Because,” Dean said, “Castiel—”
Castiel returned it with an affectionate, “Sam, it is good to see you.”
Castiel was silent for a long moment, chewing thoughtfully.
They were silent for a long minute. Dean chewed quietly on another sample of mango.
Castiel leaned in to him as if to tell him a secret. Jack leaned in as well.
It no longer serves a purpose, but Castiel can’t find it in himself to throw the necklace away. Though Dean disposed of its brother in that motel waste bin all those years ago, Castiel still thinks of it as Dean’s property. The amulet is a way to communicate to God, yes, but it will always be a symbol of Sam and Dean’s brotherly love for one another no matter its original purpose. Castiel means to give the amulet to Dean when he returns to the bunker to replace the one the hunter has lost, but in the whirlwind of events that follow, he forgets all about it.
hopes Dean has his boxers on underneath but does his best to avert his eyes just in case he doesn’t.
shoulder, which would mean his
“Do I—? Ah…n-no,” Castiel stuttered, turning a little red. He hesitated and glanced up at Dean, then shifted uncomfortably and added, “I am in a relationship, however.” He looked down into his cup and let the implication of his comment sink in.
Long minutes passed in the small, enclosed space. Long enough that Castiel began to worry that someone might notice one of the elevators wasn’t working. He reluctantly pulled away from Dean and hit the button to restart it.
“So?” Dean said. He tried his best to keep the edge of panic out of his voice, but part of it slipped through.
Just then Dean caught sight of a large, plaid-wearing figure across the room.
“You didn’t have to, darlin’,” Missouri replied. She glanced over her shoulder at him as they followed the line of people up the ramp, “Don’t worry, I won’t go blabbing to the papers, though Lord knows all the
“It was for you,” John corrected, “But yes, I was following her dying wish. Didn’t have much choice, did I? You don’t break promises with the dead.”
Dean gestured down at himself. His costume was a hot dog sans the dog. He was wearing a white tee he had painted with large blotches of olive green and his typical ratty jeans.
“What?” Dean echoed back at her, thrown by the strange answer.
It was an easy job to roll him over and start on his back…
“So, door number two, I guess,” she said when Jo pulled back.
“Yeah, about that…”
Dean felt his heart stutter to a halt when Cas mentioned the ‘
“You guessed right. Two hours ago I would have bought this entire store,” Dean said. He turned back to the case. “Hell, I might do that anyway.”
Dean smiled and pressed his lips into Cas’s hair.
Then suddenly there’s the sound of wind and rumpled clothing.
She didn’t get an answer, because at that moment Dean raised his voice over the small gathering.
Then suddenly Dean’s strong arms were under his armpits and he thought he was saved but then Dean was falling too and Castiel was falling into him, but not in the way he’d imagined.
They arrived at Cas’s apartment a few minutes later. Dean bounded up the stairs, feeling energized for some unknown reason. Cas followed slowly, seeming amused by his enthusiasm.
The two had plans to decorate cookies after dinner, and Cas wanted him to join, but Dean made up some excuse about the quarterly figures and retreated to his office on the premise that he was going to get a leg up on some of his workload for tomorrow. In truth what he was doing was sitting in his swivel chair swinging back and forth with his head hung back to stare at the ceiling while he nursed a generous glass of whiskey.
“Go ahead, Jack,” Dean said, nodding to the stocking in the boy’s lap, “Kids go first, am I right?”
“Carmen and I were never a thing,” Dean confessed. He swallowed hard. “Look, I’m sorry about that. You asked for a name and…what can I say? I panicked.”
Castiel contemplates his answer.
“I knew you would,” he murmured.
He pulled back and smiled down at Cas. The man’s blue eyes were bright and crinkled at the edges, the smile on his face genuinely happy. The nervousness had drained away in him so that he was now completely relaxed under Dean.
Jo he was into guys…was it really that obvious?
to try it.”
“I dunno, man, am I supposed to feel something?” Dean asks, “Because I just got a whole lotta nada going on here.”
“Gran, would you stop—” Dean broke off at the curious look Castiel was giving him, the nerves jittering under his skin. “Look, you can’t just decide that,” he finished weakly.
“Don’t worry,” Dean said with a wink, “I gave him a
An amused grin stretches across Dean’s face.
Dean’s face hardened in an instant.
Not by a long shot. Dean licked his lips and prepared himself for the lie about to roll off of them. “Place isn’t ready for...uh, company.”
so that they could move on to better and more enjoyable activities.
“Sleeping pill. Like I said, not even the dead can wake me tonight,” Dean said with a grin.
“I missed my flight!” Dean snapped at her. He immediately realized how loud he was being and glanced around. A woman sitting nearby nursing her mochaccino tutted at him and shook her head, muttering an inaudible complaint into her cup. Dean lowered his voice and did his best to calm down.
“I…yes,” Castiel replied. Dean snorted.
Castiel rolled his eyes in exaggeration.
“And the best part of mine is being here to greet you,” he said in return, running light fingers through Dean’s hair. He seemed to sense that Dean needed this—needed to be held, to be comforted after the trying day he’d had. Dean buried his nose in Castiel’s neck and let him, breathing in the spicy, woodsy scent of the man he loved. Castiel was silent for a couple minutes, simply repeating the feather-light touch and holding Dean close to his heart. Then, quietly, he asked, “How did it go today?”
“Yes, alright,” Castiel said. “An omelet sounds delicious.”
“I am trying to change,” Dean told him softly.
“Stop calling me that!” Claire snapped at him.
Castiel shook his head again and smiled that secret smile of his.
he wasn’t tripping, unless Dean had slipped something into his drink and he really didn’t seem the type.
a foot away from where they’re standing, and Dean breaks the kiss just in time to see the last vamp’s head roll lazily across the floor and come to a stop next to his boot. It’s bloody and disgusting, but what else is new, right? Sam is standing there heaving and taking long gulps of air to recover from the fight, the bloody machete dripping from his hand.
, however, Dean’s mouth dropped open.
“I…” Castiel just looked at him, speechless. What Dean was implying, it was…it
“That’s enough time to play Battleship!” Jack exclaimed, shooting to his feet, “I’ll go get it.”
a sea here in heaven, Dean thought. He wasn’t sure how far this road actually went. Perhaps he was driving in circles.
When he pulled away, there was something uncanny about the way Cas was looking at him.
Dean bit off his incessant rambling before it could continue further, the nerves jittering under his skin. His heart was thumping so hard against his chest, he wondered if Cas could feel it too.
“Yeah, alright,” he says, still smiling, “Was gonna ask if you maybe wanted to take a break anyways.”
“I do not require your car to travel,” Cas reminded him.
“Pretty dick move, flapping away in the middle of a conversation, Cas,” Dean chides him. Like he’s five and not…millennia old.
Dean stopped suddenly and pulled back, breathing heavily. He could feel Castiel’s hard-on pressing into his thigh.
, his tongue.
He let out a mumbled complaint it went off again and sighed into his pillow. Finding the willpower to pull himself up and turn it off took a lot more out of him than he was willing to admit. A large part of him wanted to just say screw it and take their chances, and if it had been his life on the line, Dean probably would have done just that.
“Would you like to hear it?”
She must have smiled or something, because Jo was suddenly looking at her curiously.
“Come on,
“Well,” he says, looking down between them rather than meet Dean’s eyes, “It sounds like you’ve done well for yourself.” He finally looks up at Dean and takes a breath. “I’m glad you’re happy, son,” he says, “I can’t say I understand it, but... Well, it’s not about me, now is it?”
“You and your…
“Sorry.” Sam climbed off Dean’s bed and sat back on his own. To his brother’s credit, Sam waited a beat before ridiculing him.
,” Dean shot back automatically, but Sam’s attention seemed diverted by the task in front of him.
“Can’t say I’m crazy about having some random kid here but…it’s only one night, right?” Dean shrugged. “I mean, it’s not like I’m gonna shove him back out onto the streets when it’s this cold out,” Dean said. He gave Cas a goofy grin in an attempt to lighten the mood. “I guess at this point I’m just really hoping you didn’t bring some lunatic home with you.”
There’s a stunned beat of silence, and then they’re both laughing. Castiel holds onto Dean’s shoulder and Dean does the same with the one opposite so that they mirror one another as they fall together in hysterics. How they ever made it this far in their friendship—which they are both just
Castiel grunted and looked away again.
“The appearance of the vessel is not important,” Castiel tells him, “Dean, it is in your blood.” His head is tilted up at Dean as he does when he’s saying something really important and he’s trying to look ‘authoritative’ or some bullshit. Instead it just makes him look like he’s compensating for that one inch Dean has on him.
Behind her, Chuck was softly singing
Dean couldn’t help it. He burst out laughing, large heaving whoops that left him breathless and his sides burning. He buried his face in Cas’s shoulder and cackled so hard his eyes teared up.

“Come on, Dee, stay a while,” Jody spoke up.
Short minutes later Dean was burying his face in Castiel’s hair, hand gripping the soft strands as he groaned and came undone in his grasp. Castiel followed seconds later, forced over the edge by Dean’s enthusiastic response and the frantic tug of his hair as Dean pulled his head back and mapped open-mouthed kisses down his neck.
The rest of the gang was there when they arrived at Woody’s—Justin, Michael and Ben, Emmett and Ted. Debbie was missing, probably on a hetero date on some boring hetero street downtown with
the reverend answered.
“Naw, they can muddle through without me,” he said, “Besides, you need me more.”
“Nailed it,” Dean replied with a large grin. “I’m off to celebrate. Join me?”
Castiel broke off suddenly and looked at the floor, an ashamed look on his face. He rang his hands together.
fault that real life was so goddamn boring.
Castiel was gone when Dean woke up in the morning, having an early shift at the hotel. There was coffee waiting for him in the carafe when he shuffled into the kitchen, though, and that set a smile to Dean’s face and a spring in his step as he started his day.
“You’re, ah…” Dean broke off, laughing a little uneasily. “You’re something else, you know that?”
“You’re seriously not going to fuck until they catch this guy?” Ted said, doubtful.
“Men of your type never change,” Castiel bit back.
Dean started back to the elevators.
“No.” The word was almost a growl, and Dean felt a thrum of excitement rush through him. Then Cas’s other hand was in his hair and lips were hungrily grabbing at his, dragging them open again. A tongue slipped past Dean’s open mouth and he groaned, opening it further and pressing his tongue against the explorative one inside. Castiel pressed closer, caught his bottom lip between his teeth and pulled it back, teasing. His hand in Dean’s pants moved down, then up again against his length.
Anna gave Dean a little smile.
Sam blushed into his menu, hiding his face behind it.
“You may not believe, Dean, but I do.” Castiel stared out over the water, his eyes squinted against the wind which had picked up around them. He glanced up at the storm clouds rolling overhead. It looked like it would start pouring any second. “I think it is time we return to the real world.”
Dean let out a huff and shook his head.
He craned his neck over his shoulder, following his father through the crowd. He glanced back at the businessman and gave him a quick once-over, attempting to figure out what he was supposed to be. There was a large poster board hung around his neck by a string with the heading,
“Yes, I believe you ‘owe me’ for this,” he said. There was a layer of cynicism in his voice. “I will have to think of an appropriate way you can make it up to me.”
Later, when the song became stuck in Dean’s head, the other man wouldn’t know what caused it, but Castiel would know why he went to bed well-fucked because of the lyrics Dean whispered in his ear while he came.
Dean laughed again and shook his head.
Castiel seemed alarmed by the unusually serious tone of his voice.
“I help to ring the bells sometimes,” Castiel replied, “And before I worked for the opera house I worked here, cleaning out the belfry.”
“Hello, Dean,” the angel says, just the same as he always does, but today it feels extra special.
, and something about that sat in his stomach a little sour.
“Oh hell yes,” Dean replied firmly.
“What can I say? I’m a lost cause,” Dean answered him flirtatiously.
“Well, I’m going to go grab a bite to eat,” John said a moment later. He seemed eager to leave them be. “I’ll let you two enjoy the party.” John gave Dean one last clap on the shoulder and turned back to Cas. “It was nice to meet you, son,” John said.
The sound of Dean’s heartbeat in his ears deepens and blurs into the background until he can no longer hear it, and then Castiel feels a surge of
“Hey. You get a break later, right?” Dean asked. At Cas’s nod, he continued. “Come up to my room. Not to—you know. I just…want to see you.”
,” Dean said, emerging from the kitchen with a covered platter in his hands. He grinned crookedly at Cas and said, “I think she just sunk your battleship, Ducky,” he teased.
, but I
“Anytime, Ducky, you know that,” Dean told him.
“I don’t know, I always had a thing for Dr. Sexy…” Castiel teased.
He had two daughters and a tiny little wife, which he spent showing off on his phone for a number of minutes in the beginning of the meeting like they were the fucking princesses of the world. Kind of cute, Dean thought, but also more than a little annoying.
“Sorry, I’m a…a little nervous,” Dean said, slipping his hand back into Castiel’s waiting one.
“I was lucky,” Castiel said. His brow pinched together. “If you hadn’t pulled me back when you did—”
It was concealed expertly, but Dean could still detect the subtle edge of anger in Cas’s voice.
“I don’t know…it’s not something you think about until…after, you know?” the girl was saying. “B-but I think—there was this…man. A couple days before Alan went missing. He looked pretty normal but he had these…tattoos. I know I shouldn’t judge, but there was something about him that just kinda…”
Castiel nodded.
for it?” He made a whining, groaning noise into Castiel’s ear. “Please, Cas?”
After a beat of silence, Castiel spoke.
Then he looked back up to find Samuel watching him closely, and felt his cheeks prickle under his patronizing gaze.
So he’s surprised, certainly, when John tells him again how proud he is. Of course he says it to the both Sam and him, but when he looks at Dean he
“Cas, what—” he breathed, then felt the thing brush down the length of his cock. It felt…feathery soft, and in an instant Dean realized what it was.
They headed across the bridge back to the car, Dean grabbing what was left of the beer.
“Together,” Dean added when he moved back.
—and fuck, that’s hot as
He didn’t have to wait long.
“You know,” he says, “The kind where we could both be dead tomorrow.”
Castiel’s eyes were a dark, stormy blue when he pulled back.
“Sam went out,” Cas said simply. He reached for the edge of the towel.
“Look, lady, it doesn’t matter who we are. What
Dean answered him with the chorus.
“You’re cold, right?” he asks.
“I was thinking about Halloween,” Dean continued, setting the plates down and then scooting onto the bar stool next to Cas. “The party is this Saturday. Any idea what you’re doing for a costume?”
He received a grunt and then Castiel took the glass from him, forcing down a few large gulps.
“Castiel. Thank you,” he said.
“I have definitely put on a couple pounds since we started going out,” Castiel commented.
“Huh,” Dean said intelligently, setting the case back down. “Who knew the opera could be so
“I have tried them all before,” he said, offering more of an explanation this time.
“Cas!” Dean called, rushing through the front door. A blast of cold air hit him as soon as it swung open. He could just see the outline of Castiel’s rigid form standing in the middle of the walkway. Castiel started down it as soon as he realized he wasn’t alone. “Cas
Dean took a deep breath.
William was the first to speak. The older man cleared his throat, a long, grating thing that told Dean all he needed to know about what was coming before he said a single word.
“And what kind of night is that?” Dean asks him slowly.
“What the hell is that?” he asked.
“I’m fine, Cas, really,” Dean told him. He gave a halfhearted shrug. “I dunno. It sucks, but…guess now I know where everyone in my family stands about you and me. Honestly, I’d rather have my dad and Bobby and Sam over my granddad any day. So really…I’m okay.”
“You want to…” he echoed, trailing off. He seemed surprised, but intrigued.
“Naming,” Castiel replied, then reconsidered. “Though…yes, I suppose the giving of sentimental gifts is also…” He trailed off. “I’m sorry. I did not mean to insinuate that it was wrong of you to suggest it.”
a man, not someone who was responsible for everything bad in the world.
Dean’s senses were filled with the faint smell of manure, hay and livestock feed mixed with dirt. Dean shivered but it had nothing to do with the temperature inside the barn but everything to do with the man lying on a sofa, bloodied and in pain. He could hear Cas’s gravelly voice, strained with pain while talking with Mary. Cas was slumped on the couch in a positing Dean had never seen him in. Cas was always upright and he never slumped. There was blood all over his face and hands and shirt. Dean hated that his clothes were bloody.
“Like Azazel.” Well that was a name he didn’t want to hear. Azazel was the reason their family was firmly in the
little to the imagination. The costume was a small onesie, covering his ass, groin area and half of his thighs. The front was a v-neck that ended under his bellybutton, showing a small trail of dark hair leading under the PVC and to the bulge between his legs. Dean felt faint and hot all together.
The bastard was smiling and trying to hold in the laughter, Dean was sure. He could hear it in his voice.
₰ ₰ ₰
No, it was easier to let him lie on his lap and nuzzle to his abdomen and try to think unsexual thoughts like Roz from Monsters Inc and Donald Trump and — Holyfuckingshithellohmygod! Cas started purring and his whole body vibrated and he was currently lying on his back over Dean’s lap and his dick was right there and there was vibrations and —
“And the markings?”
“How long are you going to keep this up?” Sam had his bitch face no.7 on his face, the one where he put it on just out of habit and knowing it would have no effect on Dean whatsoever.
A quick glance towards Sam convinced Dean that he hadn’t heard what was said because he was busy giving the waitress their order. “One chicken burger with extra pickle, one bacon cheese burger and I’ll have a chicken burger as well but can I have salad instead of fries?” Dean tried not to look like he had been caught saying his best friend was sexy as he finally turned to look at Cas but he was sure he looked like a deer caught in headlights. He had to gulp as he was met with piercing blue eyes staring at him without even blinking. Shit, even after all this time he should be immune to Cas’ staring at him like that but each and every time he found himself mesmerized by the unwavering gaze. It was like he could learn all the secrets of the world if he looked long and hard enough in those eyes.
Dean had been nearly shitting himself with dread!
Cas was back to himself and Dean should feel good about it. He really should. On one hand he was extremely elated that things had gone back to normal but the normal for Dean didn’t feel enough.
A drop of water fell to the back of Simon’s neck and down under the shirt. A shiver ran through Simon’s body but it wasn’t because of the freakishly cold drop of water. The hairs on his arms rose up as he looked around the eerily quiet park. It felt like someone was looking at him but there was no one around at this time of night. A street lamp’s light fluttered before going black all together.
"Damn thing, still doesn't work right," Dean grumbled, making to get up.
Josie had pointed out to Dean from the beginning that warrior spirits tended to like their meat, and anyone hosting a spirit had to make accommodations.
Time stopped in the apartment. Etienne was all eyes but, as usual, slightly to the side, suggesting, admonishing, encouraging.
"No, that's not true. I was only useless in the last few minutes," Dean sobbed.
"We'd only gotten up to the pilgrims at my last school, all right? But you give me an anatomy quiz, and I'll show you 20 places on the human body where I can take you down with maximum pain."
One thing he did know was that his experiences with Cas and Adonis were not things to be put in a checkbox of perversion. They were sacred, so much so that he had forbidden himself to think of the two men he hurt. In some part of his mind his ex-hunter's instincts were trying to reassert themselves. He didn't feel angry and defensive like he normally would at this extravagantly dressed crowd smiling encouragingly at what they thought they understood him to do in bed.
Remiel did a good pantomime of reluctance and ﬁnally shooed Castiel out the door with his agreement to parlay with Hell. He hated making concessions so early in the new order, but the longtime diplomat recognized a good strategy when he saw one.
"You don't have to put me down," he whispered when they were in the interdimensional room.
Suddenly Dean's anguish was wiped clean. He felt nothing because he expected nothing. Remiel nudged the ray of dryness in the direction of Darius.
They'd been on the road for two days. Dean had driven for most of it and refused to stop to get some sleep. Increasingly, his brother had two speeds: full throttle or off. Their next gig was a good old-fashioned haunting, nothing on as big of a scale as the job they left behind in the mountains, but Dean was in his silent, one-with-the-road persona much of the time.
"Most magazines don't go for this sort of thing, so I do fashion as my day job," Barry yelled in his ear over the music. "What are you drinking?"
His emotions in a riot from the different reactions Bobby and Sam were having to his relationship, Dean downed his drink in one gulp.
People were dancing their frantic agreement. Dean started to get concerned. His experience at concerts was a little different; at Metallica gigs he'd never seen people move like this, as if their feet were wearing away at the ground.
The two angels looked even blanker.
When it was over, Gabrielle slept, and he watched her. This was the moment he loved. When his consciousness, that was never granted any respite, could let another's rest. Balthazar couldn't stop himself from thinking back to Paris in 1880.
They drove a long ways in silence except for Sam complaining about the radio. "It's not on the station," he complained.
"Sorry Dean, plan B is a no-go," he heard Sam say.
After Etienne had only begun to describe Dean's weakened and battered state, Castiel was a knot of rage and even Balthazar couldn't wish another soul to be turned to dust.
"Ya think?" Bobby replied, downing his fast. "We've been in it, son."
Dean took off running again before he blurted out that it was more like an everything cramp. He was going to feel like that forever—drawing people into his orbit, a useless minor sun that lit people up only because they needed some kind of warmth so badly.
Over the crest of the empty horizon a cloud was barely visible. At ﬁrst it was only an overhang of dust that gradually brought the scent of horse dung and unwashed men and-
The times when he happened upon a girl in a bar and went back to her place to ﬁnd her really kinky in the bedroom, he'd been all for it. It was a game, some new edge to push. But what he'd been doing with Etienne and the other Limbo-dwellers, that had been seeking an edge and deliberately cutting himself on it.
But there was a sort of geometry in it. Like a polygon approaching a sphere, suffering was a multifaceted thing that could scrape you on all sides with the additional torture of knowing it would never end.
"Dammit, Khan, aren't you supposed to keep me from making an ass of myself here?" he demanded of the version of Genghis Khan's features he saw in the mirror.
"I still can't hear him," Cas said, trying to cover his relief.
“As soon as they stop the moratorium, which they'll have to do eventually, there will be the next step. Let's drink to one thing working out before we take on the rest of the universe, okay?"
Balthazar's Temperance virtue was stretched so tight he feared it might rip.
Why his actions seemed weighted down somehow, as he barely nudged Castiel into the desired actions.
Castiel uttered many psalms of contrition for the danger he had exposed his beloved to. He should have known that there was no such thing as privacy in Heaven. He did his best to push all the desires and worries from his mind. It was surprisingly difﬁcult for a seasoned soldier like himself.
And here Dean always thought his brother preferred brunettes. "Yeah, that's really interesting, Encylopedia Brown, but I don't see what's it has to do with our downsizing demon."
"That this is like Moses parting the Red Sea, except I guess it would be the tie-dye sea. We've got to ditch the suits or people are gonna keep avoiding us," Dean observed.
Dean immediately felt on more familiar territory and sent a glance Sam's way asking him-"One of the usual culprits—any one of several varieties of possession? Demonic, ghost or otherwise?"
"Something looks different about you," the hunter was scrutinizing his face,.
Cas took a deep breath. He was trying to ﬁght this new irritability that was so easy for him to fall into these days. "And then an absence took over. I don't know how to explain it. A terrible absence that is not death."
"I bet you're going to go over big with the girls now. You should keep your hair like this all the time, Dean. The red brings out your eyes," Sam teased.
The Khan liked women, booze and meat, just like the old Dean, which helped distract from the new Dean, who didn't really do any of that.
In a moment they were in Dean's New York apartment.
It was the best panic room Bobby Singer had ever been inside of.
"Angels have long felt alone at the pinnacles of power. There have always been places like this where they could let someone else be in control for a little while," Valac said.
The angel already detested the creature for being of the same cloth as the spiritualist that led Etienne astray, but he forced himself to be polite.
This version of the Star-Spangled Banner touched him in a place he didn't even know he had. It was personal and alien at the same time, and the dingy setting melted away. Though it was a sticky hot summer day, he felt cold, refreshed, as if he were breathing air much purer than his lungs were used to.
For once, Balthazar had no ready lie. "About what?" he asked, biding for time.
True enough, Dean's mind and body did not agree about what was happening, so he fell back on the sort of rationalization that had allowed him to put many a drunken hook up behind him.
Making love while being held in the air by Cas' arms was pretty great too.
Randy did have nice eyelashes. He looked vaguely Italian and his olive complexion looked much healthier now that he was emitting a friendly glow. "You don't seem very New York to me. New in town?"
Dean retreated to a part of his brain while Cas assumed his earnest note-taking posture before Sam and Bobby's stories of Dean-wrangling. It was weird how easy it was for them to ﬂow in and out of each other's thoughts, but it was so right. When he ﬁrst was fused into Cas' vessel back in Hell, he was so far gone he felt more like a rapidly scattering mist than a person.
"Maybe he's not possessed. It could be another kind of spirit activity," Sam suggested. "We should just take a look. That level of rage and violence alternating with complete clarity like that? It doesn't sound like your average psychotic break."
"So very Spanish!" "Look at those dark eyes ﬂash!"
He zoomed in closer, and where they could see other people beating their spouses and pilfering from the till and otherwise scoring one for the team, Dean's apartment registered as a big nothing.
It very nearly could be otherwise. One of the best laughs Etienne had had so far was watching the devils scratching their heads over his immunity to that racket they had piped into his cell as a sure-ﬁre way to undo him.
"Who are immune to holy water," Sam pointed out. "There's something there. Maybe Bobby can help."
"Such as?" Zophiel asked earnestly.
He and Castiel exchanged a look on the angelic plane. Ever since Sam had attained his well-deserved respect in the tribes, and then had taken over the lead role in the apocalypse, they knew Dean might be feeling a little unnecessary. They were unsure of how to remedy that, however.
"They say he looked slightly troubled, but that could be a typical angelic understatement or merely a reﬂection of Dean's nervous temperament," Balthazar replied.
The doctor walked out into the hallway, and they followed.
"They say I don't understand human nature, that I am made of stone, but you, my brother, you roll around with these creatures but are touched by them not at all. If it has to do with the vessels, as I originally assumed with Castiel, you would be the last one to see it, poor Balthazar."
"No, just now. You were—searching—for something."
All this was Cas's fault, Dean thought bitterly as he felt his brother's eyes scrutinizing him from the passenger seat. It was bad enough that Sam thought it more likely that Dean had his own voodoo control master than that he could be a good human being occasionally. But Sam was probably right.
"From now on, you are Naayééʼ Neizghání or Bil Najno'ltliji," the medicine man said to Dean. "And you are Naʼídígishí, or Tóbájíshchín," he said to Sam. "Nothing else. Understood?"
It was very confusing, and not entirely unprecedented. What he was discovering he could do by putting the radio between stations, and what he heard while are walking on a clear night, was pick up glimpses of voices that sounded like nothing but static to his brother.
"Can you believe these guys all share DNA from the Khan?" Dean said excitedly about the family that ran the restaurant. If this is how was brother wanted to play it—compartmentalizing the hell out of things-Sam didn't think he was the one to judge.
Here Zachariah did a little earnest-clumsy-smoldering mime of Castiel, and Dean realized that it wasn't just that his friend wore his human vessel badly-he was a kind of joke in heaven, too. He felt a stab of sympathy, and then returned to Zachariah’s taunts.
Sam pushed his brother out the door and into the car.
In the meantime, Dean was the undisputed navigator. He drove without thinking about it, and they ended up in towns where there was usually the perfect triad: some wrong-side-of-the-tracks witch for Sam, a monster for him to practice his growing spell repertoire on, and an expert for Dean to consult.
"Let me just wash off—I stink like a linebacker," he said to the man who settled on the bed.
He stopped to consider. "Actually, he just might, it sounds so cruel."
The words came rushing out from where Sam had been afraid to voice them before. "Etienne, you seem pretty cool. And like, freakishly strong. Nobody can tell you how to be. You're determined to ﬁnd your own way through this transformation thing. And my family has always thought highly of Balthazar."
But now Dean was pissed. Leave it to him to fall in love and have an entire universe use him as an object lesson! He pulled into the parking lot of a dive bar.
They smiled and tasted salt on their lips.
October 9
The angel healed the burns that the man obviously didn't feel from the explosion of energy and sent him to sleep in his home, the dimension bordering on collapse.
"Evidently that is one route," Grace replied. "Perhaps there is someone who can explain better than I."
Dean had so much ﬁrst-hand knowledge of this phenomenon from his crash-course with Cas, that he wasn't sure he was expressing himself well. He gave his brother an appealing look.
Rafael poked him a few times with some sharp instruments. Balthazar made as if he would tighten the rack again.
"Thanks, man," Dean said, adding a little extra juice to his smile to make up for the fact that he intended to never visit that street again. The barman's sharp intake of breath betrayed the irresistible draw of the angelic.
Grace made a little bow where it ﬂoated in front of him. "It really was a rather apt simile Dean Winchester came up with for me when he called me Tinkerbell. I rather like him. It would have been too bad for his being to be dashed to pieces in between temporal dimensions just because Castiel forced me to keep throwing him there."
"No, but if I told you what I did for a living, you'd get a knock on the door all the same, so let's leave it at that," he said. "Where are we going?"
"Let's go," Dean prompted, and in a moment they were back in their room. "Are you sure you didn't want to go somewhere else?" Cas asked.
Their partners came back bearing glasses of chilled gazpacho, exactly the sort of liquid nutrition their bodies preferred. "Try this, Cas, it's amazing."
"I've been coming here for some time, until recently, without knowing what I was doing," Remiel said, enveloping Dean in his attention as he had once before. "If you look, there are people ﬂitting in and out of here all the time, but for most it's too fast to even remember."
A parishioner reported going into the church ofﬁce and ﬁnding some books on homosexuality. "They must be thinking of starting a ministry," the person said, but the boys knew the woman's motivation must have been quite the opposite.
There was no guarantee that Grace would supply another miracle on the level of what was done for the vanished Etienne so that he could be put back together.
"I don't even know where the Khan is. He gets antsy, anyway, so I'm sure he'll show up when the ﬁghting starts."
"Thanks for that," Balthazar said with the ease that had become habitual to him since everything lost its meaning.
"A couple?" Dean parked the car. "You must have had more fun in college than you let on. Who were the lucky ladies?"
The fury he felt at Dean wanting to be less than he was, it was pulsing through his angelic body and vibrating through his vessel. In a daze, he saw what he’d seen the first time they had touched.
"A stiff whisky for my friend, and another glass of wine for me," Paulette said, getting up from her chair. "I'm going to go powder my nose," she said signiﬁcantly.
Even Cas burst out laughing. "Men have always had their ways," Castiel said with a formal understatement that suddenly reminded Dean of when they were ﬁrst getting together.
He felt for his shirt under the direct angel's gaze from Cas.
"Miss Harriet gave me some good ideas already, thank you, but don't be surprised if I call you up some day asking for more help."
Step up. "Please don't go." Step back. Repeat.
"Dean Winchester, how the hell are ya?"
"Romeo and Romeo had their brief affair, and now they have to choose death together or life in exile from each other," Balthazar said gently.
"Don't worry. You needn't make any decisions for yourself, and he'll bring you right back when you're done. Make Daddy proud."
Which was apparently a bleeding-heart liberal. Who was possibly into dudes.
"You know that we have our eyes on the bigger picture."
"You must care deeply about the vessel, sir," Ambriel ventured.
Etienne looked stricken. "How soon I forgot a century of torment, some of which I spent mingling my own dust with these souls."
"I like our other games better," Dean said with an edge in his voice. "Don't you worry about what they're up to on this secret assignment? We both know Heaven is if anything more devious than Hell." His face brightened. "So give me a dose, quick."
"So speaking of the Cause," Dean got up to open a can of juice from the case he carried with him so he could add it to his drink. "I really am trying to get my nutrition, Bobby.
"It looks like the plan is beginning to work, but there are sympathizers in places you would never imagine.”
The angel discovered that there was something worse than watching someone he cared about go to pieces because he committed the sin of caring.
Too phallic. He tried again.
The boys were loaded up and on the road in no time, and the patter on the windshield had never sounded so friendly.
Despite himself, his beaten mind would inevitably pick itself up and begin to wander at the pace of a crawl.
Castiel smoldered brieﬂy at the thought that Dean was once there, and there were horrible pictures all around the universe to prove it. The snapshots of Dean wearing little more than ﬂecks of blood, along with the most contented expression he'd ever seen on his lover, made Castiel want to destroy something The club would do.
The angel would never have considered this particular position. Most of his fantasies degenerated into a tangle of limbs and longing without stopping at particulars. All he knew was he wanted to please his lover in the way his simple, angelic being was being pleased—it was practically speaking in tongues he was so happy to be soul-to-soul with his beloved.
"Are you ill?" Castiel was there in a moment, accompanied by Balthazar.
They took a few photographs of the marks on the bodies and scoured every surface for signs of an opening, but the place was like a layer cake of anti- supernatural materials.
Tonight, Sam had taken the car to some place where he could have a beer and listen to the sort of music Dean was already sick of from that folk festival.
Rafael turned to the rest of the group. "We'll ﬁnd all of your vessels and make them poster children for collaboration with Heaven among that petty little uprising they have going. But until then, there are many things you can do for me."
There was that look again. It enveloped Castiel and he let it. "You'll be ﬁne. You've survived worse," was all he could think of to say.
“Who’s Callum?” As the question came out of Dean’s mouth Sam started laughing at the other end of the line.
place. And what the hell was up with that? You didn’t dress that way and talk like that to a dude without following through with it. Shit, what a cocktease!
“You have any idea who we are?” Dean asked, anger boiling inside of him. He refused to accept that there was no cure.
“Dean, for the hundredth time: he’s fine with it.” Dean could hear the roll of Sammy’s eyes as they hid in the bushes and watched Cas sashaying down the street.
.” Dean tried to explain but that just caused Cas’ eyebrows furrow even more. Sometimes the dude looked like the husky puppy in the video Charlie had sent him one time, turning its head this way and that way, trying to understand what the silly human was saying to it. Dean faintly wondered if that’s how Cas saw them, as silly humans.
Dean’s right hand flew without a conscious thought to his crotch to relieve the sudden tightness inside his jeans. He could feel the tip of Cas’ tongue wiping, swirling around at the pad of his thumb and doing a
“I did n—“
Dean had needs. If he was being honest with himself and he liked to avoid those gutwrenchingly honest thoughts, deep down inside he needed for someone to touch him; someone to love him, even if it was for his looks or his abilities in the sack. He needed it like he needed air to breathe. For years he thought that the random hook-ups would be enough and that he was content with his way of life for the rest of his life. That he didn’t deep, deep, deep, way deep down wish for the ‘
Dean looked up when the chopping sound stopped to see his boyfriend craning his neck to see through to the dining room. He chuckled.
He was talking about something a hell of a lot bigger than that.
” She opened her eyes and smiled gently at Dean. “I used to quote
“Dean, show me how to pleasure you,” Castiel murmured in a low gravel against his skin.
“You ready?” Dean asked. At Cas’s nod, he gestured toward the park. “I uh, made reservations,” he said, rubbing at the back of his neck. “Place is about twenty minutes from here so I figured… we could walk? Unless…uh, I mean, if you want. Or we can take a cab.”
“Here we go,” Sam says, stopping in front of a door and gesturing, “The showers are down the hall to the left. Kitchen is back the other way to the right. Come find me when you’re done. I’m gonna work on getting some lunch together. Dean?”
He honestly didn’t know what the hell Cas saw in him, couldn’t understand why he’d agreed to be more than ‘just friends’ and go out with him.
They headed toward the pavilion in back. Though the structure was the largest part of the park it seemed to be for the most part ignored by its inhabitants. Dean saw fliers taped to the thick concrete pillars that announced
Happy 2021 everybody!! :D
ever a loaded question.
ready to do.
Check out Dean and Cas's Chinatown date
Castiel trails off and chances a look at Dean. The hunter’s forehead is pulled together in thought and there is a slight frown on his face, but without the pendant, Castiel has no idea what he is feeling. He takes a stab at it anyways.
“Yeah, okay,” Dean said. He felt his heart speed up a little, excited by the thought of Cas romancing him. “What’ve you got in mind?”
Dean gulped and felt the blood rush into his face. That wasn’t the only place it flooded to. He gripped himself through the thin fabric of his sweatpants and grunted in sudden arousal.

pie,” Cas complained at him.
or you’re gonna lose your balance and leave yourself open.” He hops on his feet, gesturing for Castiel to come at him.
One of Castiel’s eyebrows raised in challenge. A pile of ammo sat on the plate in his lap, the lo mein barely touched because he’d been saving it for last. Its sacrifice would not go unrewarded. Castiel held out a hand and gestured Dean to ‘bring it’ as the Kung Fu master had in the film.
cool orcs are, this job is
Castiel shook his head.
He was thinking so hard he barely paid attention to where they were going until Cas nudged him to let him know they’d arrived. Dean’s head snapped up to the store they’d stopped in front of.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I didn’t think you’d come,” Dean greeted. The relief was evident in his voice.
This time Bella looked at him like he was

?” he asked. One more nod from Cas, and Dean pushed the door open.
Castiel grunted and accepted the offering, taking a long drink before lowering the mug. He seemed slightly more awake when he did but still sported a bit of a grumpy frown.
“You should not say things like that here,” Cas said in a hushed voice, glancing around briefly. His blue eyes shifted to the manager standing stiffly at the front desk. Dean glanced over as well.
“I am good, thank you.” Castiel held up his hand. “Since I am, ahh… quite literally all hands on deck now, I would say that speaks for itself.”
“Dad, hey, wait up!”
“Who says we can’t do both?” he replied. He pressed a warm kiss just under his ear and then leaned back with a sigh. “Don’t really have the time to do what I have in mind though,” he said regretfully. Castiel turned around in his arms and slid his hands up his sides.
“Uh…” Dean swallowed, at a loss as to what to say to that. “Th-thanks.”
“What do you want, Dean?” Castiel asked.
bits, shouting alongside of him. The final chords faded, and Castiel sat back from the piano with a heaving gasp and a satisfied slump of his shoulders. He’d thrown all his anger and frustration into the song and it had been…rather cathartic.
Castiel grunted.
“Yes, you do seem the type,” he said.
“Hmm,” John hummed suspiciously. “Dean, I know it isn’t any of my business but…does Carmen know you’re seeing other women?”
Anna reached into the bottom drawer and placed two nips of whiskey next to him on the counter. Dean grabbed one, unscrewed it, and downed it in one go.
“What’d you buy the whole donut store?” Dean joked, grin plastered across his face at the luxurious amount of sugar left in the bag. He silently placed dibs on the bear claw.
The bar where Jo worked was packed to capacity when they arrived, and Dean had to bribe the doorman just to get them in. He got a text from Sam saying him and Jess had decided to call it a night just as the bouncer was letting them through.
“Does this mean you’re still leaving?” Dean asks him hesitantly after a minute.
The Empty growls and goes quiet. It seems to be concentrating. A patch of black goo gurgles in the space on the ‘ground’ next to the being’s ‘feet’. The goo bubbles up in the shape of a man, roughly his height, if Jacob had to guess. The goo continues to gurgle and fold back on itself to reveal a face that’s undeniably his own. Damn. It’s like looking in a mirror.
He slumped and hit the pavement like a limp sack, all the energy sapped from his limbs. A heavy weight crashed over him and he stared bleary-eyes into the bright light pollution that was the Pittsburg sky.
” Dean cried as the man bucked his hips, hitting the spot just right. He shuddered and rolled forward again, groaning as the hard line of flesh slid against his prostate.
“No. What kind of name is that anyway?”
,” Dean whined, sucking in a breath as he felt his balls shrink up in the cold.
Until then... stay AWESOME ;D
Suddenly there was a high-pitched shout and the sound of a loud
Dean looked back at Pam and laughed. “
“Yeah, ‘m right here,” Dean answered him, a little hoarsely.
“What do you want me to say?” Dean asked, frowning slightly, “I
“I am not
“Shaddup,” Dean blurted. His face was burning. He ran a hand over it nervously. “I uh…the reason I called. I have a… a d-date.” He swallowed hard, and hoped it wasn’t audible over the receiver. “Tonight. And I’m…I’m kinda freaking out about it.”
“It was
a good distraction from thinking about the one thing he
Castiel smiled and reached up to cradle Dean’s face in his hands. He pressed a slow kiss at Dean’s lips. When he pulled back he rested his forehead against Dean’s.
Sam stared at him, lost for words.
Paul said over the line. Dean could practically hear him frowning.
It was Sam’s turn to roll his eyes.
Castiel’s eyebrows raised, as though it were an odd thing to say about volunteer work and he seemed impressed. He said nothing, though, and merely unlocked the door. They went in, and Castiel made a beeline for the closet. Dean took a seat at the small kitchen table opposite the bed.

“It’s a
Castiel hummed and moved his attention to Dean’s neck.
“Yup, kid took on
“Oh yeah, and Mr. Peterson accused me of taking his Camaro out for a joy ride,” Dean said. He turned back to Cas. “Course, he was right,” he confessed, “But apparently I was a convincing enough liar that I got away with it.”
“Sammy, it’s good to see you,” Dean said, stepping out of his brother’s embrace and clapping him on the shoulder. He looked down at Sam’s outfit. “What, you didn’t like the clown costume I sent you?” he teased.
“Why Cas, that sounded almost presumptuous of you,” Dean said. He leaned over the counter and grinned playfully at the man.
method of travel.
Castiel leans into his touch feeling warmth bloom in his chest and thinks…it’s enough. He doesn’t require any more than what they have together, right here. A friendship. It’s more than that, of course—what they have is a bond that goes soul-deep. Castiel’s handprint forever blazed in every facet of every molecule of Dean’s DNA and the untethered glory of Dean’s soul seared into the backs of Castiel’s optic nerves from when he pulled Dean from hell. He’s not sure any ‘girl’ Dean could meet and fall in love with could ever come
Dean listened to her voice telling emergency services what had happened, ears buzzing with static to where it all sounded garbled like a bad cell connection. He cradled Castiel’s face in his hands.
“Okay, boys. Twenty questions is over. Castiel, dear? Congratulations, you pass.” Ellen shot him a grin that could scare the devil. Castiel gulped, wondering what would have befallen him had he failed her test. “Now then,
Castiel tugged at his coat sleeve.
“Dean!” Sam flashed him a big smile as Dean strode up to him, opening his arms for a hug. Dean walked into them and gripped his brother tightly around the shoulders. He had to stand on his tip-toes to do so.
“Good,” Sam said. He sounded relieved. “Okay well, I’ll let you go. I just wanted to see how you two were doing. I’m glad you’re alright, man.”
“Sam, this is Cas. Cas, this is my brother, Sammy,” Dean introduced.
It didn’t take long. A final punching thrust that hit his prostate just right and then Dean was crying out and spilling all over Cas’s hand, throwing his head back and just trying to remember how to breathe as his whole body trembled from the release and the wash of ecstasy flooding through him.
“Cas?” the hunter calls worriedly, his voice an octave higher than normal, “What the hell was that?”
Dean dragged on a pair of long underwear and jeans, then added an extra layer of shirts to his typical ensemble. He’d grabbed his dad’s old coat from the house in Lawrence and shrugged that on too. He was glad he had thought to bring it and the one Cas had worn back with them.
Most of the usual crowd was already seated when Emmett and Sam arrived together, minus Michael and Ben. Cas and Dean had their own table, his brother with a ridiculous amount of food spread out before him. He was feeding the angel cherry pie off his own fork and wearing a grin to rival the devil.
“For six years?” Claire scoffed at him.
“This is the strangest date I have ever been on,” he declared, staring down at his plate. He gathered the tip of the pie up on his fork between two delicate dollops of cream.
“I’m fine,” Dean grumbled, slumping back into his seat. He swallowed hard, turning away. He figured he’d made enough of a fool of himself for one day. A second later he turned back to the woman. “It’s just… they don’t know about me. They don’t know I’m coming. I’ve never done this before and…
Sorry everyone, but this one character insisted on being a complete and total asshole. There is much fluffy Destiel sweetness to make up for it as always, I promise. :3
question at the tip of his tongue.
Castiel peered over his shoulder into the pan to find a circular shape with two small nubs at the top for ears.
He looks between the two and their blank looks say everything.
“No, Missouri is my name,” the woman replied. She placed her hand on Dean’s arm as he dropped back down with a relieved sigh. “My, you
“Nothing,” Castiel said, grinning wider. Dean shot him a strange look at his sudden suspicious behavior. “You look very good in that apron,” Castiel admitted.
“Shit, sorry,” Dean said quickly, looking down. “That was a dumb thing to say. It’s not like I’m—I mean we haven’t even—” He broke off, feeling restless and let a breath out through his nose.
“You wanna weigh in here, bud?” he asks.
“It is not the only one,” the angel said.
Dean covered Castiel’s hand with his and spoke slowly.
Castiel’s hand came up to rest over his, putting an end to his fidgeting so that Dean had no choice but to look up at him.
“Clearly there is no stopping you,” Castiel replied dryly. Dean just kept smiling at him and rolled out of bed.
Castiel nodded vigorously, his tears spilling over. He pressed wet lips to Dean’s a little desperately, if he were being honest.
“Still in pre-law,” John replied proudly. “I’m looking forward to the day when I can finally put him on the payroll.”
Jess’s smile wavered. She looked back to Sam.
There was a long-suffering sigh from under the covers.
“No, I suppose not,” the man replied. The corners of his lips tugged upward. “But it certainly makes for a good show.”
Dean drew in a long breath and then let it out, raising his eyes to the heavens.
“Cas, why
“It—okay, look, it was the only way—” Dean starts to say, holding up his hands in defense.
Dean opened his mouth to protest. So much had happened in the past few days that he hadn’t had the chance to ask again. He meant to say as much, but Marcin continued before he could.
Castiel laughed a little at that and Dean grinned, glad to have finally gotten some sort of reaction out of him that wasn’t just a variation of his ever-present
“Yes, please,” Castiel said.
He started by looking for apartments. His father’s company was the obvious choice, but nothing was available that met with his tastes so he opened up his search.
Castiel shook his head.
“Well, no,” Dean told him. He passed a hand along the back of his neck, sheepish. “Truth is, that kind of blatant display of wealth always made me uneasy. My dad’s kinda the same way. We have a house back in California. Nothing too big, but it’s comfortable. And we still own the farmhouse where we grew up.”
Marcin clapped his hands together.
“Everyone ready to get this party started?” he asked, picking up the two trays of snacks in his hands. A wave of nods went around the room. Dean gestured for them to follow him with a tilt of his head and so they all grabbed their glasses and plates of food and wandered after him, holding the platters in his hands high with a dramatic flair.
“I thought I should at least drop this off,” she said by way of greeting.
Jess’s brow pinched together in concern.
He ended the call and looked up at Ed and Harry, who had been following his every word.
“It’s not—it’s the way it is, Cas, there’s a difference,” Dean argued, “You said you didn’t expect anything from me, well—now you’re expecting too much.”
Dean sighs and clips the cap off his beer with his pocket knife, slouching down in the chair.
“Yeah, Gran, there’s plenty of food,” Sam said. He pulled out the empty chair next to him.
“It is a…costume party?” he asked. His brow pinched together in sudden concern. “I…ah, hadn’t realized…”
“Can’t tell you how often I’ve dreamed of doing that,” Dean said, a satisfied smirk spread easily across his face. It dropped abruptly as he turned to the manager. “And you,
Dean spotted Jo manning the bar like a pro, dashing back and forth behind the long counter as she served up drinks to every monster, celebrity, and Halloween classic. She herself was sporting a lavender jumpsuit—the top of which was stripped down and tied around her waist—a black tube top, and yellow work gloves. There was a red bandana around her head and a large wrench on the bar where she was serving drinks.
he thought, suddenly realizing he didn’t own a single one.
They split up into teams, as Jack had suggested, with the adults on one team and the teenagers on another.
weird. You know?”
“May I have your hand?” Castiel asked. “Your drawing hand,” he amended.
“Go ahead without me,” she said, “I’ll catch up.” She turned back to the kid and took his hand in hers. “Come on, Neil Armstrong, let’s go find your mom.”
“W-what?” Dean blurted, his mouth dropping open. “Uh…w-wh—not that long,” he lied.
Things got very heated, very quickly—lips and hands and tongues and teeth—and somewhere in the back of his mind, Dean noted the irony that he was making out with a man
was hitting the town—singular. Sam was still holed up doing research, leaving the legwork to Dean. Dean suspected that was just a bad excuse to get out of barhopping on Liberty Ave. Sam might not be into this job, but it was quickly turning into one of Dean’s favorites.
But the thought that he had helped put that smile on Cas’s face. Well now, that was…that was entirely worth losing the damn pool table or the pinball machines or hell, perhaps even his porn collection. He wondered briefly about what Cas would think about that last one before it hit him.
“I know you did, buddy,” he murmured. He didn’t look up, but kept staring at the table, eyes tracing the map laid out across it. Tracing the borders of Africa, Indonesia, Ecuador…
“Why not? It is the truth,” Castiel replies defensively, drawing his shoulders in tighter around him as though he still had use of his wings. Now that he has said it, he feels he must stand his ground or otherwise admit to the weirdness of his comment.
Dean snorts because there’s irony to the fact that Cas had to
“Yeah, we’ve got uh…plans of our own so…” Dean said.
It is only fair, after all.
Brian ended the kiss almost as quickly as he had started it, detaching from Dean’s lips with a loud smack. Dean breathed heavily and stared at him with smoky green eyes, noting how dilated Brian’s own were.
Claire waved her phone around in front of Castiel’s face, where the music video she forced him to watch was still paused at the end.
“I don’t exactly have flowing golden locks like in all the pictures,” Dean points out, “So maybe you guys got it wrong? Maybe I’m not Michael’s vessel.”
Really looking forward to next chapter's trip away to Rufus's cabin!! Gonna try my best to get through most the chapter this weekend so that I can be on time to post for next week. Please kudos and comment! I love hearing what y'all have to say. :D
“Well, it looks like you’re in good hands,” John said. He patted Castiel on the arm, and Dean gulped down the sudden urge to laugh hysterically at his choice of words. “I’ll leave you to it.”
Anna winked at him.
In actuality, he was going to go wash his hands and find Jess, but that was neither here nor there.
” Cas froze, eyes going wide as the bright flavors of strawberries mixed with cream hit his tongue. Then his mouth opened a little and he gave a little sigh, his whole body drooping with ecstasy. His eyes glanced down to his pie with new respect. “That is very good pie,” he said.
“I am so not getting involved,” the youngest Winchester declared.
“Cas, no,” he said quickly. “I’ve got it. Save your cash for school, man.”
Dean pulled back from the kiss, knowing it wasn’t going any further than that and suddenly needing to get as far away from this place as possible.
“Because they’re all fucking clueless,” Claire interrupted venomously. “Like they know what I’m going through.”
was now the expert in safe sex—which was extremely fucking annoying considering a minute ago he hadn’t known what condoms even
Dean winced and nodded, knowing how stupid it sounded, knowing it wasn’t true, because Cas was just
“So,” Charlie began, “You and dopey soup boy, huh?”
“The nurse mentioned you might want to try baths,” Dean told him, “Easier to keep the cast dry that way. And she said it would help with the bruising.” He looked down, slightly embarrassed by all his mother-henning. Really, he hadn’t taken care of anyone other than himself since Sammy was in middle school. “I had Kevin pick up some bath salts. They’re supposed to help.”
“Cas,” Dean said, not knowing what to say to that.
“Oh God—
“Right?” Dean grinned at him with a child-like twinkle in his eye. “Okay, I’m calling it. Waiter! Two pies to go. One blueberry, one strawberry cream.”
“Yes, I know.” Castiel shifted and threw the phone down on the bed, grunting at the pain. “I need a shower. I feel disgusting,” he declared.
Of course, he’d always been lousy at letting things go. He had a bad habit of poking at the beast until it reared its ugly head and lashed out at him, and here was no different.
Dean flinched a little at that, the proverbial elephant stepping quite emphatically into the small room.
“Joanna Beth, I do not need to explain myself to you, of all people,” Ellen snapped at her daughter.
“So it
The room was silent as Alex sang, her voice soft and hesitant at first.
“You are, but you still have a long way to go before you are ready to take on Dick Roman,” Castiel told him.
“Brian, what—?” Justin started to say.
With a jolt he realizes that he is gripping the amulet in his pocket and has been for Jack-knows-how-long. He can feel Dean’s buzz-induced euphoria through the pendant swirling with his own.
Kevin was waiting for him in the lobby of the office when he arrived, visibly nervous and sweating through the collar of his shirt. Dean glanced at his watch. He was early. Figured. Dean waved him into his office and closed the door.
“Try tedious and infuriating,” Charlie remarked. She pulled away from the hug and bounced a little on her feet. “But, that’s why he’s paying me the big bucks,” she said excitedly. “I’ve got a swanky new apartment super close to the office. View of the park and everything. It’s amazing!”
There was the sound of someone clearing their throat behind them. Dean leaned around Castiel to find his brother standing in the parking lot with his hands on his hips.
Charlie took a breath.
” because none of that made a lick of sense to him. Also, Dean holding him like this is
Charlie peered up at him with a crooked grin.
Dean was about to shoot back a cheeky remark when Castiel flipped the cover the rest of the way off and he blinked, recognizing the item at the very top.
He grabbed the bag and nodded at Cas, giving the angel the go-ahead to transport them. Castiel gripped his shoulder a little tighter and Dean grimaced, anticipating what was coming.
day, and the routine of the past few hours was starting to blur together in a confused muddle of time broken only by the sound of Dean’s phone alarm.
too. How could he have forgotten about the pie? He had
“Is it okay if I bring this to him?” he asked, turning to Helen.
“I’m afraid I don’t have anything that will fit you,” Castiel apologized as he slipped his sweater over his head.
Brian went down with a cry, the knife lodged just above his knee. He held his leg, wincing in pain as he attempted to stand but couldn’t. Dean watched utterly helpless as his date for the night fell to his knees in the dark alleyway, unable to flee.
Dean shrugs and looks a little guilty.
The sun rose gay and shining upon Liberty Avenue the following morning. The twang of a bell rang out as the door to the Liberty diner opened and closed.
Castiel smiled gently at her.
“Yes, I am feeling a lot better now.”
before leaving. Dean answered with a stuttered, “T-th-thanks,” and practically tripped out the door.
A gentle hand rested on his shoulder.
“Nachos ‘n Netflix,” Dean says, grinning down at him, “What’dya say?”
“Pretty sure she doesn’t,” Claire told him, “Why else would she leave?”
“Dean?” Castiel croaks out.
The corners of Castiel’s lips suddenly turned upward in that secret smile of his. He fidgeted with the edge of the flyer, bending the corner of it one way, then the other. The smile grew, slowly, the longer he went without saying anything. Dean held his breath, his heart pounding against his chest as he waited impatiently for Cas to respond.
“Know what you’re doing for Halloween yet?” she asked.
Dean presses the necklace back into his palm and the warmth of contact between it and Dean’s large hand covering his own sends shivers of joy from his fingers all the way down to his toes.
“It’s good to see you—jerk!”
The worry had vanished from Helen’s face by the time Dean had finished his report. Her clear blue eyes sparkled as she replied.
“Oh,” Castiel said, blinking away the moisture that rose suddenly to his eyes and saying breathily, “Yes, that sounds wonderful.”
“We have no way of knowing until we can track him down,” Sam told her, “Do you think you can describe him for me?”
to acknowledge what he’d just revealed.
Castiel let out a breathy laugh. A wicked gleam flitted across his eyes.
“You can tell him that we will be unable to attend,” William said dismissively. His words crackled against the pristine blue walls of the sitting room.
” Castiel blurted, face beet red. He raised his other shoe above his head and made to throw that one too.
“You know I’ll take care of you,” Dean said, pulling Cas in tightly against his chest, “And the kid. Hell, at this point we should just start a charity.” He grinned down at the man in his arms. “Cas and his lost kids,” he teased.
Cas nodded.
That and he was still trying to win back some points for what happened at the Mash.
There was one sure-fire way John would do that. Dean had to prove he was capable of running the company. That meant getting results.
“Cas…” Dean’s hand was suddenly at the side of his face, cupping his cheek and rubbing his thumb across the bristles of his five o’clock shadow. “It won’t be like this forever, I promise,” he said softly.
of the bottles hitting one another in the cooler by the garage door. Then he heard the door shut. Silence lingered in the hallway.
the reverend said chidingly.
“Dean, stop being a little bitch and just tell me already,” Sam said, “Is it a guy or a girl?”
’.” He put the mug down long enough to give Dean air quotes, then promptly picked it back up to his lips again.
For the second time that day, Castiel looked at him with blue eyes that swam with regret.
“It’s perfect,” Castiel said, voice thick and husky with emotion. He was clearly moved by the gesture. “Thank you, Dean. This is…this is more than I ever—” he broke off, blushed, started again. “It is lovely. Thank you.”
Dean finally separated from Cas long enough to turn on the shower heads and (in Cas’s personal opinion) spent an infuriatingly long time adjusting them to where they would both benefit from the warmth of the spray. The rainfall showerhead overhead sprinkled in a gentle cascade down Dean’s back as he returned to the bench and climbed back onto it, straddling Castiel’s lap.
Castiel shared a meaningful look with Dean, who raised his eyebrows as if to say,
Dean catches up to his father as he’s making his way down the hall to the room they assigned him earlier that day. It hurts to know he won’t even get the chance to use it once. Dean suspects John probably needs a moment to collect himself after everything Dean told him about the time paradox, but Dean—who after hearing the words
Dean grabbed Castiel around his length and ducked under the blanket, giving Castiel one quick, smug smirk before diving down between his legs.
Dean didn’t say anything for a long minute. He let Sam’s words soak in, trying to get a grip on his frayed nerves.
She bit back a groan. ‘
“Good, good. Michael, you and Ben get the scoop and report back to us,” Ted was saying.
“I’m a model. Beer ads mostly,” the girl replied.
Castiel pulled him into a strong embrace, one hand cradling the back of Dean’s head, the other pressed into the middle of his back, behind his heart.
“Please be a king, please be a king,” Dean muttered under his breath, making a bee-line for the mystery door and pushing it open. In the middle of the room was the largest bed Dean had ever seen. “Now that’s what I’m talking about,” he said with a wide grin.
“How’re you feeling?”
“I suppose it is,” Cas agreed.
“Yeah? What’s your first favorite kind?” Jo asked.
He handed the envelope to Dean, who took it from him with a curious quirk of the eyebrow before tearing into it and shaking out the contents. Inside was a single piece of paper. There was a logo of some kind in the upper left corner for a property management company. Dean read the title across the top of the page.
“Thanks,” Dean said. He declined the milk and sugar that she offered him and took the cup and saucer from her with genuine appreciation.
“And you’re seriously going to become a shrink?” Dean asked, “Seems to me like this is your passion, Cas, not Humpty Dumpty-ing people back together again.”
Cas was silent as they made their way to the car—Cas practically carrying him—and Dean was glad he wasn’t taking the opportunity to say
was taking care of things?” he reprimanded. Dean winced a little.
They must keep it in the kitchen.”
Dean let out a nervous laugh.
He took a pull from the bottle in his hand as he considered his answer.
Cas let him go and he swayed again. Damn.
“Try Valium,” Em suggested.
“Oh. N-no. I was speaking for myself,” Castiel said, stuttering in his embarrassment. “I have grown accustomed to our…intimate time together,” he said shyly.
“We’re very happy you’re here, Jack,” Castiel said.
by that kiss—in ways he’d never realized were possible.
Dean walked Castiel into work like he used to do for Sammy when it was his first day of school, the only difference being the hand he had pressed into the small of Cas’s back. Castiel was nervous and jittery once they were inside, and fidgeted with the strap to his new messenger bag. It was stuffed full of sheet music that Castiel had collected over the years, including a few new additions that Dean had gotten him over Christmas for this very occasion. They stopped outside of Marlene’s office, Castiel eyeing the doorknob as though it might bite off his newly un-casted hand.
“No. Uh…b-blindfold me?” Dean requested shyly.
” The angel’s voice grew quiet, more subdued as he continued. “And then, after I Fell, I kept falling. I continued to fall every day, deeper and deeper until I was so far gone I forgot what the world was like before the moment I gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.”
“Hey, shush, they’re saying something,” Emmett whispered.
Castiel’s shoulders drooped, his voice along with them. When he next spoke it was so low that it sounded like a gate swinging open over the entrance to a gravel-line garden path.
“I’m sorry. I’ve never experienced a relationship like yours before.” At the way Dean’s eyebrows lowered dangerously, Jack suddenly realized how that sounded. He held up his hands in defense. “I don’t mean because you are both men. I meant because you are happy. And affectionate. I’ve never seen another couple who kissed so much, except maybe some of the kids on my old school bus, but I was told by one of the girls—Lily was her name—that it was just to practice for the real thing.”
“Uh, yeah, no emergency. Sorry about that. I keep forgetting about the time difference,” Dean said, trying to sound apologetic. He fidgeted with the tail-end of his tie and swallowed again, unsure of how to continue.
“The restaurant said they’d take care of it,” Dean answered. He threaded his fingers through Cas’s and gripped his hand tight. They started to walk away when Castiel gave a light gasp.
The reply was fast to come.
“D-doing just fine there, Ducky,” he said in a shuddering breath.
Harry huffed and shouldered his gun, turning his full attention to Ed.
Castiel hummed and smiled at the nickname. He brought the coffee to his lips and took a large sip.
The grin on his face was barely noticeable, but it was there. Dean beamed at him and watched as he turned to leave. He lingered in the doorway as Cas walked back to the elevators, head titled in admiration of that fine ass in those pressed black pants.
“Nothing a little Alka-Seltzer can’t fix,” Dean said, “But he’s not gonna make it today. Hoping you have someone who can cover for him.”
“Yeah, sounds good,” Dean replied. He grinned, trying not to show his relief, or the fact that he was more than a little pleased by his father’s approval of him.
Brian came awake with a gasp, clutching at the first thing available, which happened to be Cas’s hand.
“Dean, why does your father think we’re dating?” Carmen asked, tilting her head to the side and looking up at him expectantly.
“Yeah, and I also know you don’t give a crap about that,” Dean shot back at her. He tried and failed to keep the blush off his cheeks at her nickname for him.
Sam shot Dean a look that said something like,
A lot in his life was changing too. New, brighter colors—rainbows upon rainbows of them.
Castiel wiggles a finger down lower and hooks it just right—
It was
It was John’s turn this time to allow the silence to stretch between them. Dean licked his lips and tried to stir up some sort of response from his old man.
Dean sucked his fingers into his mouth to wet them and then slipped them one by one into Cas, stretching him open.
“So what the hell was that all about?” Emmett was asking, taking a sip of his drink. His big blue eyes looked up at Sam, wide and expecting a response.
“I’m not,” Dean rushed to say, “You just…you deserve better than that, Cas. You deserve—hell, I dunno…a hell of a lot more than what you got in life.” He shrugged. “It just doesn’t seem fair.”
Jack shot to his feet, eager to help.
One was on her way to becoming a medical researcher—testing infectious diseases and constructing cures for them. The other was a philanthropist and worked with autistic children.
“By all means, come in,” she said with a heavy line of sarcasm, “It’s not like my privacy is important or anything.”
Castiel didn’t give him pause, just wrapped himself full-bodied around Dean, pressing their chests together—pressing their everything together—and kissed him with both his hands (well, one hand and one hard plaster cast) buried in Dean’s hair. Which was hard to do considering how short it was, but Cas still managed to somehow get his fingers sunk into it regardless.
The first impression that Dean got when he stepped into the room was that if someone were to take a photograph and show it to someone from a hundred years ago, most of the room’s contents would be recognizable to that person. Of course there were modern differences in things such as book titles and light fixtures, but besides the digital alarm clock by the bed, the small radio on his desk, and the single poster on the wall next to this, there wasn’t much that would look out of place to a person from the 19
“We’re good,” Castiel replied, eyes flickering to Dean, who smiled back at him.
smart,” the older woman piped in, “Top of his class. And his SAT scores were nearly perfect!” Her voice had changed and her accent completely disappeared. Her English was suddenly smooth and grammatically flawless. Clearly she’d been conning them up until now.
Dean grinned into his skin.
candy store?”
“I assumed… the tabloids, and the other night— You seem…well-traveled,” Castiel struggled. Dean gave a little snort of amusement at his polite way of calling him a slut.
“No, Dean. You cannot understand because you have never felt what it is like to go without,” Castiel said. He hesitated as though he was about to explain, then thought better of it and gave his head a little shake. “It does not matter. I allowed my fear to get the better of me and would have done something regrettable had you not stepped in. I owe you my gratitude for that.”
“I think I want to experience some more right now,” Dean said in a low, gravelly tone as he lowered his lips down...
. He would never have guessed Castiel had such a troubled past, especially considering his positive outlook on life and easy way with people. He made his relationship to his parents sound almost benign, but clearly it was more complicated than that if there was no financial support coming from them.
He stowed the canister in the cupboard next to his own snack supply and returned to his forgotten pan.
Dean felt his own cheeks grow hot. “Uh…I mean—
“Dude, you ok?”
, she’s coming over.” Dean glanced to Chuck. “What do I do?”
attracted to his breakfast? The thought is ridiculous.
He thought Cas was going to argue with him further but all he did was take three deep breaths and then rasp, “It’s in my phone.” He grimaced and swallowed with some difficulty. “I…don’t know where it ended up.”
Dean frowned at him.
“No, I…I’ve never missed a service,” Castiel said. He groaned as another wave of nausea hit and pressed a hand to his forehead.
“It’s quite alright, Jack,” Castiel reassured him, “Believe me, I understand. I’m impressed you were able to work that out on your own.”
noise low in his throat. Then he grabs at the scruff of hair at the back of Cas’s head and thrusts his tongue into Castiel’s mouth. Castiel’s hand comes up to grip the back of his neck, keeping them pressed together. He stretches his mouth wider, pants slightly as Dean pulls briefly away and then dives back in. All the way in.
Dean extracted himself from under the sink and looked at him, standing in the middle of his apartment in an inch of water, absolutely drenched from head to toe.
“And yet my flight is on time,” he grumbled. He couldn’t decide if that was a good or a bad thing.
“It does not feel like it has been two days,” Castiel replied, “After today it feels like it has been…I don’t know. A week, maybe more.”
“Well no shit—”
Castiel straightened and turned to face him.
“Right, and we’re all just supposed to be okay with that,” Jo grumbled into her meal, “Typical.”
“That is disgusting,” Castiel said, scrunching up his nose.
The kid gave him a long-suffering sigh and rolled his eyes.
“Whatever, man, this stopped being fun like…ten minutes ago. I’m gonna go get some Funyuns.”
“So? So are a lot of things. Doesn’t stop people from doing them. Only difference here is that what we’re doing isn’t
, and that is what mattered. Castiel felt a warm bloom rush from the center of his heart and down to the tips of his fingers and toes.
First, being human
“I would…call it love,” he says, the words falling from his lips in time to the slow beat of Dean’s heart.
“I’ll get it,” he said.
“Fuck it,” Dean muttered to himself, kicking at the sand.  He downed the rest of his beer to bolster his courage and then said, “Cas? Castiel, who thou art I
“Nobody cares,” Claire shot back at him.
“You know, if I knew where we were going, we could take the car,” he grumbled, accepting the ticket Castiel handed him.
“Castiel, my favorite customer,” he greeted in a heavy Polish accent.
“Dean…” Castiel said in a low voice. There was a layer of thick emotion under the rumbling gravel, as though someone had spilled tar all over it.
“Cas was it?” Samuel asked. He made no move to take the hand Castiel held out for him and instead glanced at him and then back to Dean. “So what, you’re a fairy now?”
“Perhaps for Easter,” William said quietly from his chair, touching his wife’s arm in gentle reassurance.
“Gran this is Cas,” Dean said. He pulled Castiel closer to introduce him. “He’s my…um, my boyfriend. Cas, this is my Grandmother on my mother’s side, Deanna,” Dean introduced.
“Cas, that’s my brother, Sammy,” Dean said, slapping him on the arm and grinning brightly. He tugged excitedly on Cas’s sleeve. “Come on, I want you to meet him.”
“How the fuck am I supposed to calm down!?” Michael practically shrieked.
“Who said I was talking about you?” he replied, grabbing at Castiel’s sides.
The point was that Dean felt decidedly out of place in the general conversation. He didn’t fit into the cookie-cutter life, much as his Dad was trying to shove it down his throat. He couldn’t relate to wives and grown children making their mark on the world—
to get that it was uncool of him to be
That’s not the answer he expects by a long shot.
along with a sleek black credit card...with
“We should go downstairs,” Castiel said when he moved back, “We still haven’t said hello to everyone and I don’t want your family’s first impression of me to be wondering over whether we are ‘doing it’”—these he air-quoted—“in your old room.”
“I do.” Cas let out a little sigh and let go of him, but did not move away. “I want more, Dean,” he admitted in a low voice. “I thought I could be satisfied with these dreams we have been sharing, but it is not enough. I want you. The real you.”
Nothing came to mind, however—he was dealing with a whole new show here. Dean could hear Brian breathing heavily behind him.
everything was.
,” John says.
, Dean thought, rolling his eyes. He glanced away, back to Cas who was still watching them, and then turned back to his father. He gave his old man a tight smile.
Castiel’s hands were on his waist, long, elegant fingers gripping the dark fabric of Dean’s shirt. They shifted every now and then and crawled up his ribs, or fell lower to his hips, as if he couldn’t quite make up his mind where to put them.
Castiel hummed in agreement.
“Darn,” he replied. He couldn’t help the line of disappointment that slipped into his voice. “Another time then.”
“Yeah,
Jody sighed.
“No. Teleportation, as you would call it is much more immediate and far less detailed.”

A piece of Castiel’s carefully constructed wall broke a little at that. He blinked up at Dean.

“It is called
“So, how long have you been a bar wench?” Charlie asked her, grinning into her drink.
“Paul Bunion,” Sam replied. “Jess is around somewhere. She’s dressed as the Blue Buffalo.”
Castiel chuckled.
“It’s just a tree, Cas,” he said. His face felt warm. Hell, his
“I mean, don’t you think it’s kind of weird that you haven’t found any of my battleships?” Claire asked, waving her hands over her board. Jack thought about that for a moment, then nodded almost imperceptibly.
He might have imagined it, but he thought the bellboy’s eyes widened, just a little.
Castiel looked up at him and nodded.
He struggled harder, giving it all he had. The thing was going to kill him.
“Not since Mom died,” Dean supplied. He looked to Cas as he added, “Didn’t think I’d have a reason to play it again until now.”
“What? You got embarrassing stuff in there or something?” Dean pressed.
Castiel grinned wickedly and took advantage of his distraction to toss the noodles in his hand at Dean.
“I believe there is some substance to the theory,” he replied seriously, “There is a very well-known psychologist who swears by it. I have read his work, and I must say much of what he describes does ring true. However…”
“I see Anna,” he said, pressing a hand to Dean’s arm. “I will meet back with you later.”
“Yeah, well, good for you. I’m not,” Dean replied.
Dean grabbed some food and then returned to work himself, Cas’s words swirling around in his head.
piece around in his fingers and staring at it intently.
, not because he’d wanted to surprise Dean with homemade baked goods hit him a little unexpectedly. Not that Dean needed Cas to do that kind of thing, he had just automatically assumed that was the case when he walked through the door because it was usually always just the two of them and plus Cas was just generally awesome like that. But seeing him and Jack together as they were, still unaware that he was even in the room, Dean felt something unpleasant stir in his gut.
.’ Sam wasn’t impressed, but Dean loved it.
He hung his head back with a love-struck sigh just thinking about the Impala.
“Oh yeah, that’ll be fun,” she said with a heavy line of sarcasm. She shoveled some sweet potato casserole into her mouth and rolled her eyes.
—” He broke off, catching himself on the implication that had slipped out without his meaning to. What the hell was he saying? “I’d tell him,” Dean finished. He took a breath, reconsidering his words a second time. “I’d want to tell him.”
“Can’t knock a man for tryin’,” he said.
Because now he is tucked into Dean’s chest with Dean’s arm around him and… and the hunter is warm and he smells
Dean flashed him one last smile, then turned and ran after Cas.
“Relax, it’s a compliment,” he said. “You were friggin’ adorable out there.”
“Mr. Chen just asked you a question,” John said.
Dean scoffed, and Cas shot him a look.
Dean let out a breathy laugh.
“Oh, okay.
“Damn straight it is,” Dean said. “It’ll have to wait, though.  Big meeting tomorrow and…well, let’s just say if I fuck it up my perky ass will be on the first flight back to California.” His eyes dropped to the floor as his lips wavered from the smile he forced onto his face.
The meeting was grueling and it took all of Dean’s skill and tact to close the deal, but finally after two hours and a few rounds of whiskey, Dean got him to sign. And for two percent less than the guy had originally been willing to go. Dean relayed the good news via voicemail to John, then hopped back into the company car feeling lighter than air.

Cas flopped a hand over the one Dean had resting on the side of the bed and gave it an exaggerated pat.
“My safe word is ‘lemon drops,’” he said huskily.
“Yes, I realize that,” Castiel said. “Believe it or not, I

He realized what he said as soon as it slipped out.

“Dean, I want to decorate this place for Christmas,” he blurted.

Carmen grinned. If she had heard the line before, she apparently found Dean charming enough not to care.
Dean heard the sound of the lube bottle snapping open and waited for the feeling of oil over his skin—something, but there was nothing.
over Revelations.” Castiel’s voice lowered and he looked away. “Though, I’ll admit I didn’t see the appeal of such a thing until I met you.”
Dean hadn’t been kidding when he told Cas business wasn’t his thing. After a short workout and a quick shower, Dean and his dad had hopped into the company car and hightailed it downtown to meet with one Mr. Chen about the possibility of buying up one of his properties—which is how Dean found himself seated ramrod straight in an uncomfortable conference room chair in a suit and tie, sweating through the collar of his button-up shirt.
Castiel pushes these thoughts from his mind and focuses in on the emotions coming from the necklace so that he can answer Dean’s question.
Charlie nudged him with the bottle of Warniks.
“Dude.
The woman threw back her head and laughed generously, her large bosom shaking in her mirth as she touched a hand to the large onyx stone that she wore around her neck.
“Oh, and um…you might want to give your doctor a call in the morning,” he added, addressing Ben.
John nodded.
Dean finished with his shave and as he was drying his face he decided to do something about it. First though, he was going to catch them some breakfast.
“We’ve been…meeting up in my dreams,” Dean replied.
Dean whistled
“You mean it was a
Castiel raises his eyes to the ceiling, feigning ignorance. Dean rolls his with a light scoff and nudges him with his shoulder.
Behind him, Dean laughed and threw an arm around Cas, pulling the angel in close to him.

I wanna see you come in that shirt.”
what it is,
“Wait.”
Castiel shook his head, eyes dropping to the floor.
Dean searched his deep blue eyes for a moment longer and then stepped back and closed the door.
Castiel shot him a look that was equal parts grateful and relieved. He understood that Dean offering to drive Claire back meant that he would get a chance to talk to her.
“Ready?” she whispered to him.
Dean laughed out loud at that.
apologizing?” Dean asks him. He blinks at Castiel in surprise.
Dean hums against his skin and pulls him forward away from the door. He’s about to turn them and shove Cas to the bed when he finds himself falling back to the mattress instead. Castiel straddles him and crawls up on his knees, hands under Dean’s shirt. He pulls it up and over his head.
Jack smiled and reached for the OJ and glass Castiel had set down on the counter for him.
—c-c—” The words got lost in a gurgle in his throat as the orgasm overtook him, flushing white-hot euphoria through his entire system. Dean arched off the bed with a cry, thighs trembling as each nerve was cranked into overdrive.
Dean takes a deep breath and smirks at him a little.
“Hey,” Dean said, instantly annoyed. “You’re the one who said to stay away, so you’ve got no right being a jealous little bitch.”
“Hey, hey I don’t know. You gotta calm
for the first time and ask for his hand in marriage,” he said with an audible squeak to his voice, “Nothing to it.”
“It was certainly…invigorating.”
“Dean, no,” Castiel says, and automatically tries to give him the necklace, but Dean pushes his hand away.
That caused a flare of anger in Castiel. Next to him he felt Dean go rigid and Castiel felt a surge of protective energy rush through him.
“Thank god,” Sam breathed in relief.
noise.
shower,” Dean complained.
Cas stepped up behind him and placed his chin on Dean’s shoulder.
“I know, I know,” Dean said, annoyed. “God, this is such a fucking chick-flick.”
“I’m not,” Castiel murmured, interrupting Dean’s unsavory thoughts. The soft smile in his voice was audible and floated in the backdrop of his words as he continued. “I want you through the good
Castiel’s eyes flickered to Dean. His face was carefully arranged, but Castiel was used to his micro-expressions by now. The tightness around the edges of his mouth told Castiel that he was disappointed by his father’s refusal.
to feel wanted like that.
When Cas’s hands slipped under his shirt, he leaned back just enough to help pull it over his head and then hurried to shove Cas’s coat off his shoulders.
“Awesome,” Dean said, and kissed him.
“Dude. Do you
“Why is it always so sad when the dog dies?” Cas asks Dean with the tears still wet on his cheeks. He throws up an irritated hand toward the TV, which is now rolling the credits. “We knew the dog was going to die, and it’s still sad. Tell me, why is that?”
Cas pulled back from him, turning his head away so that Dean almost got a mouthful of his hair. He stopped short, just in time.
“Would it make much of a difference if I took them now?” he asked, referring to the painkillers.
“I am sure your car is fine, Dean,” he said. He paused. “I can check for you if you like,” he offered.
And School.
Cas slipped an arm around his torso and pulled him back against his chest.
So, Castiel huffs and puts up with it, allows Dean to show him how to rotate his wrist as he extends his arm so that his fist hits at a slight angle. The hunter draws his hand along the inside of his forearm while one hand holds his fist out, pointing out how the bones in his arm align so that it can safely absorb the impact of his punch.
Cas, in this unguarded moment, had unfurled his wings in the small expanse of the bar. Though invisible, anyone paying an ounce of attention would be able to sense them.
Then he froze as a thought occurred to him.
“I will. And uh…sorry about this,” Dean hesitated before continuing. “It…may have been partly my fault.”
“You will, once you eat all that,” Castiel pointed out.
Dean moved on to the dishes then, hauling them back over from the bin on the table where he’d placed them temporarily while he fixed the sink.
“Cuz I felt like it,” Dean replied, dropping easily into the smart-ass attitude that he knew drove Sammy nuts, “What, you don’t want me seein’ your stupid, moose-like forehead? Move the screen back, bitch!”
with Mr. Chen!? This isn’t the way we do business, Dean.”
The eye-fucking went on for a good five Mississippis that time, and Sam snorted as he flipped through the photos.
, and not in a good way. Did’ja know you can get sand burns? Cuz I sure as hell didn’t.” Castiel paused in his administrations and laughed into Dean’s navel. Dean squirmed under him and grumbled, “Hey, that tickles. I was being serious.”
Dean ran his hands up both of Cas’s arms. From his short huff and the way Cas’s shoulders sagged in defeat, he guessed the man’s answer before it left his mouth.
Yep, he was hard again. He stroked Cas slowly, watching as his cock twitched and heard the hitch in his breath.
“And your tongue is broken now?” Marcin said. He was giving Dean that same hard, expectant look from before.
“What!?” Dean blurted, “Jody, is that true? You and Bobby?”
you,” Dean said, gesturing toward her, “What she said.” Dean squinted at the girl, noticing the skulking teenager leaning up against the kitchen wall for the first time. She had long, dark hair and a lingering frown on her face that looked like it had been there far too long. “Wait. Who the hell are you?” Dean demanded. He turned, confused, to Jody and Ellen. “Who’s that?”
On the page, one of the characters was commenting about watching people in their cars as they commuted to work on a mundane, Monday morning.
. Like people do? You know,
“So, Cas,” Sam said, changing the subject, “You’re into opera?”
Dean crying, and then Jessica had her hands over her mouth and was nodding furiously sobbing, “
Claire bounced up after her victory at Battleship to see if dinner was any closer to being done. She wasn’t surprised to find that things hadn’t progressed very far since the last time she had checked, unless she counted the fact that Castiel was now sitting
“Count-a—th-th—
“Is that what you had in mind?” he asked, not at all innocently.
“Naw,” Dean said, grinning at him, “You can be my Superman, Cas.”
“Yeah,” he agreed.
“Dean, I ahh…wanted to make sure you were alright after the—after what happened in the barn,” Castiel said hesitantly.
“Ain’t you a sight for sore eyes,” Dean teased lightly. He kept his voice pitched low, but Castiel still groaned.
The Winchester man. It would have been impolitic to start a war, so soon after the apocalypse and right after his ascending to power, over one man.
The oddness of it brought one last surge and Dean collapsed into the nothing that was somehow holding him up.
"Would you take him back?"
The angel nodded.
"We owe you more than that after keeping our brain from exploding."
"Don't listen to him. They all lie," Dean's mind told the rest of him.
Only Dean, Cas, and the angel that knew them both well, Balthazar, knew that a genuine love and desire to merge was essential to the process—not something that could be forced or controlled at all. The leading angels would not have understood if they'd tried to explain.
"I don't know, Dean. Did you know that the angels have a saying: 'Humans invented the word why and they've not stopped bothering us with it since'?"
"Sorry, man," Dean said, and Sam caught his look that communicated their mutual confusion over Balthazar's motivation for leading the Cause. Still waters ran deep with that one, Sam knew.
"Thank the Lord."
Dean just scowled at the suggestion and then he ﬂinched away from the angel's raised ﬁngers reaching for his forehead.
Dean listened to her tell a dizzying number of myths that had probably been told during the very period when Cas and his buddies were watching people try to be better than animals.
"Alcohol is a drug," Sam pointed out. He, for one, remembered last night. "Maybe you should have some compassion."
"This isn't good, precisely."
Further evidence of Grace's scheming aroused only the tiniest of snorts from the leader. Keeping that extra bit of insurance behind enemy lines must have been Grace's plan all along. Lucky for them, Dean provided an opportunity for the lost souls to prove their usefulness.
The story had stuck with Sam because he'd long seen his brother undergo a similar transformation on their long road trips. Going into or coming out of a job, Dean was cranky and pushy and cocky-but at some point when they were far from any responsibilities, when they were two pirates on the high seas of the highways, Dean was actually a pretty cool guy.
"What about you, Dean? Would you go back and change anything?" Sam asked reproachfully. "Like maybe, not lying to your brother left and right?"
"And mine is Zophiel," Rosa said. "And I could hear him up until two days ago. He was telling me it was going to be all right."
They gathered up their trash and got back on the road, with Sam driving. Dean was dozing when he heard his brother's question. "Why did you want to eat outside?"
"No, my brother, but we couldn't tell you he would be interrogating you, or your performance would have been unsatisfactory," Castiel said gently, laying a hand on his companion's head.
The minion quivered. "I only keep the books, sir, follow the market, I don't—"
"All right ﬁne, I'll choose the scenario," Dean huffed. "You're at the top of the Empire State Building. There are demons blocking the elevators and stairs. You've got some school kids and a really pretty teacher and a werewolf holding them hostage. Your only weapons are from the next three things we pass on your side of the road. Winner gets to choose where we eat tonight."
"Do tell," the demon prompted. "Ah, I wouldn't sit there. That chair's last inhabitant might still be in it, in part. But you're used to all that, I suppose."
"I'll go after him," Dean said to the others' surprise. "He doesn't have any reason to be mad at me yet."
Sam slammed himself into the bathroom and Bobby continued in a lower voice,
The sharp in take of breath happened despite himself, and Dean wished he could yank it back.
Soon the moment was over, but Dean struggled to understand why it felt so wrong being at the council.
Dean had been changed enough by his—time—with that human, Adonis, that their bond had not yet reestablished itself with the old clarity. But every day Castiel felt he could feel and hear his lover a little better. Now that Dean was lost in another realm, however, Cas had only his faith:
"Brother, may I come in?"
"So you –" the man nodded towards the other's groin.
There was no way to know for sure. But who was Sam, after all, to deny his brother this one small plank of happiness that Dean clung to in the face of the rising waters of doom?
"I've had enough of your conspiracy theories, Balthazar," Raphael cut him off. "You are totally missing the point. Hell may very well be behind this, but regardless, we have the technology in our control."
"So this is quality control—the least scrupulous angel around observing you? I'm intrigued."
That tangle of a boy was his ﬁrst sign that angry, ruined people like his dad weren't born that way. Davin proved that simply seeing too much could ruin a person.
"Hope you have better luck with that than some," she smiled. "Here you go, room 413. Enjoy your stay."
Balthazar sighed. "Even if he's heard Etienne's lovely Enochian message blasting through the ether, Dean's not in a place to really get it. At this point, I'm not sure if he would be receptive to anything you have to say, Cas."
At this point, orientation was not his strong suit, let's say. He simply drove until they came upon a town where the shadows looked nice and thick.
"I'm sorry, I should have known," Cas apologized automatically.
"This is not as good, but it's pretty darn good," Dean thought to Cas as they undressed each other slowly.
Suddenly they all became aware of another group visible in the garden, which immediately looked, as one, at Dean's group. Though they wore diverse forms, there was some unifying characteristic that made them identiﬁable as a manifestation of Grace.
"Not so fast, I have that beat by a mile." Dean kept his eyes carefully on the road. "Most of the Indians around here are Cherokee. I think they have a lot of mythology about spirit animals, so I think someone there could help me ﬁgure out how to summon—"
It was a Saturday night so there was a line of hopeful humans trying to get in. Dean liked to think that he and Etienne got to the front of the line on their own power, but it was also true that Cas was pushing them through with the force of a battering ram, so anxious was he to complete their mission and bring Dean back to safety.
“Yes,” Castiel answered with bittersweet inﬂection. “Yes, I did.”
“Cas? Cas? Cas!”
“Oh,” Jack said. Then he looked at Sam and tried to mimic his posture, sticking his ass against the wall and splaying out his arms and legs. He held it for longer than Sam expected. “So.” Jack said. “Is this some kind of human thing? Cause I gotta tell you. It kind of hurts.”
Cas looked Dean straight in the eyes. “John is here because Jack knows you loved your father. Not because of any action your father has taken to deserve it.”
“Shut it,” Dean told him. “I’m a great frigging lay, okay?”
“What?” Everyone turned away from John and Dean to stare at Cas.
Sam opened his mouth. “But I thought -- you’re homophobic,” he said and then stopped and closed his eyes. “I mean -- that’s not -- you’re my -- door, lock -- I love -- Dean,” he shoved out, sounding strangled. “I had a speech, I swear.”
Sam turned pale. “Mom,” he said, “take it from someone who had to share a computer with him for thirty-three years. There
“Four times.”
“You didn’t deserve that --”
“I think Sammy should answer,” Dean said. “Considering this is his stupid fault.”
Dean nodded once. “Okay.”
She looked over at her adult sons in front of her and tried to reconstruct how it all happened. She can't get passed the first night. She can't picture John's first hunt, or Sam's first steps or Dean's first girlfriend. She looked at them and she saw nothing.
Dean smiled at Cas so fondly that Mary wondered if she should maybe just throw the plan right now. “You heard him,” Dean told Jack. “Get your father some coffee.”
Dean stuck his finger threateningly in her face. “Don’t you get any ideas.” He turned back to Sammy. “You either, okay? Jack’s got special privileges.”
Cas didn’t bother hiding his smile. If he was a more expressive man shaped being, Dean was sure he’d be laughing at him. “Goodbye, Dean. We’ll be back at -- six?”
“Yes. No. No?” Sam wasn’t sure what he was trying to do, let alone what he was actually doing.
“You some kind of faggot also?” Was John’s contribution to the conversation.
She tried to bring it up again on the road. “So.” She started. “Married?”
“Yes,” Cas agreed and bit Dean’s nipple.
And the thing is? The insane thing is? John really sounded like he was sorry. He sounded torn up and pained and regretful and he was really apologizing to Dean, saying everything Dean hadn’t even known he wanted to hear and it was all so stupid, so dizzyingly wrong.
Dean blinked. “Apparently not.”
“It doesn’t change anything,” Sam said. He’d heard people say that on tv and he was pretty sure it was one of those important things you were supposed to say.
“Hey, cocksucker,” Jack announced brightly to Dean as he sauntered in with a wide innocent grin, effectively halting all conversation in the room.
Mary closed her eyes. How could she protect her children from herself? How could Mary leave without running away? How could she talk to her own children when she barely even recognized herself?
“Yeah,” she said, tentatively. Even Sam seemed to be watching, speculatively. Mary grabbed the first tape on the top of the pile and put it in the cassette player. “It’s nice you still have this,” Mary said and it was. Something familiar in the midst of everything different.
“Hey!” Dean called back, “at least set the table or something.”
“Yes,” Cas agreed, intensely. Sam’s hand twitched. Mary felt deeply uncomfortable. Was this homophobia? She wasn’t sure. She didn’t mention the discomfort, in case it was.
Dean’s eyes flew open. “What?” he asked, rapidly paling. “What are you saying?”
“You -- what?” Even Sam looked flabbergasted by this one.
“Okay, okay,” Dean pulled Cas off laughing again. “Even in paradise, you’re going to need to give me more than thirty seconds and a depressing conversation about my father before I’m ready to go again.”
Mary wasn’t sure that was true. She wasn’t sure if she wanted it to be true or not. She didn’t respond to Cas.
“Dean, your reticence around certain aspects of sexual intercourse can be incredibly inconvenient.”
She pushed into Dean’s room around noon. Everything was arranged very neatly. There was no dust. There was a computer in the center of the desk which Mary -- didn’t touch. Instead, after making a quick glance around outside Dean’s room to make sure no one could see her, she went right for the desk drawers.
Mary wordlessly turned the movies around so that Sam could clearly read the spines.
“Oh, hey, mom.” Sam perked up.
“Dad and, uh, Mom should be getting here closer to six thirty but Sam’ll be here around then,” Dean confirmed and watched them leave. Apparently, to go look at some cool rocks Jack had found.
“What’s this kid talking about?” his dad asked, while Mary started subtly toing off her shoes.
This was the moment of truth. The explanation was right on the tip of Mary’s tongue. She could ask Sam and he would probably tell her and then she’d finally know. “Nothing,” she said instead.
Castiel really did seem nervous at breakfast. He fidgeted with his coffee mug and barely touched the omelet that Dean made for him, no matter how tasty it was.
something on your mind,” Dean points out, “You’d have to be some kind of moron not to notice. So? What’s up?”
feeling so powerless.”
“My head’s a little…” Dean shook his head, trying to stave off the feeling of cotton in his ears.
Now the pair looked down at him, impassive but for the lines of worry on Sam’s brow and the clenching and unclenching of Bobby’s jaw. Dean struggled against the ropes binding him to no avail—when Bobby Singer tied a knot, it was for keeps.
but he peers down at the necklace seriously and considers his answer. After a moment the hunter shakes his head.
“Sure, go ahead. Get me thrown out of here. At least I won’t have to sit through any more of these dumb lessons,” she grumbled.
“Ellen!”
Come on, man, lend a hand here. It’s your future too!” Dean called out to him. His brother’s hand was pressed into his cheek, turning his head away as Dean gripped Sam’s sides and dug in his fingers.
“What!?” Jo blurted on the other side of him. She immediately put down her fork and stared at her mother from across the table. “Mom, is that true?”
? “You brought me to a pie palace?”
(See the end of the chapter for
His father gave him a disapproving look, and again Dean cursed his habit of sleeping around.
“Yeah, sure y’are,” Dean said. He couldn’t help the bitter note that bled into the words. He bit back any further sarcastic remarks, knowing Cas wouldn’t want him to leave on bad terms, and continued awkwardly. “I’ll uh…let you know when we set a date for the wedding, just in case you change your mind.” Dean dropped his voice and stared into his coffee. “I know Cas would want you both there.”
“Hey,” he said, smiling as Cas sat down next to him and immediately gripped his hand tightly. Definitely nerves then. “How ya holding up?”
“Fine,” Dean replied. He chanced a look up into Castiel’s bottomless blue eyes. They were dark and intense with desire.
“I think that would be best for all parties involved,” Castiel agreed.
“Dean, I did not mean that as a rejection,” Castiel said gently.
“Yup.”
“No, I don’t,” Castiel replied softly.
the room cheered as one, throwing up hands and confetti, clinking glasses of champagne, or twirling noisemakers around and honking their blowouts.
“Pizza sounds good to me,” Dean replied.
He couldn’t do anything but stare down at the ring for a long minute. He felt like he should say something to mark this momentous event, but nothing came to mind.
