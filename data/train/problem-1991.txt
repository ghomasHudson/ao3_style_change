"No. No, it has nothing to do with a bloody floral jumper and you know it! Someone. Namely you! Told her that, now I want to know what other Lies have you been telling about me right this instance!" John came marching up pushing the television aside to slide in his chair. His hands flex and grip the armrests.
Despite her lies as well as nearly killing him, Sherlock wanted his blogger to be happy and he felt like his chance to do that had passed. He wasn't what John wanted or needed, he wasn't what anyone needed. It all came crashing down around him, caring was not an advantage.
Greg wasn't surprised it was coming to this; he had been watching his marriage fall about for years now. Honestly he was beyond caring, he hadn't really loved Caroline since there last child was born. He had tried to tell himself the sweet little baby girl would solve the wedge between them but it didn't. Now four years later he could see that things were not worth salvaging with his soon to be ex-wife
The look on Sherlock’s face was priceless. Like a wall in his precious mind palace had just crumbled to dust. “But, you… John that’s….”
As he spoke Mycroft left his umbrella from the door handle holing it horizontal eying the length as he paced leisurely left and right in front of the captive. " Fear, being linked positively with something intelligence. When all the signals it sends us lead us to believe if anything it should inhibit our adaptation." The was a soft click from the handle of the umbrella.
Watson trampled those thoughts, as he pushed the door open. He felt like all the air had been knocked out of him as he stared at Sherlock's hunched over shaking form.
Summary: Mycroft dose some soul searching after the loss of the DI, Turns out the Iceman isn’t so cold.
Mycroft entered his home in a foul mood, Sherlock being difficult per-usual. He stormed over to the collection of fine crystal decanters of Brandy pouring himself a glass. Had he been a man of less decorum he might have put his fist through the wall. Thankfully for the state of his drywall he had enough self control to simply flex his fingers as the amber liquor washed away the edge in his ire.
Suddenly the bed shifted and Sherlock found him self pulled over onto his back. John was now very very close to him.
John shot up in bed the sweat making the sheet cling to his chest, he had the nightmare again. He wouldn't find sleep again tonight, not with that horrible memory playing on loop every time he closed his eyes.
"Stop laughing and help me! She will not stop I have tried everything! She hates me, and formula...and whatever these things are!"  he gestured to the pile of soft toys scattered on the desk.
He had shouted in a fit of anger and told Mycroft directly, “I’m done! Loss my number forget my face! You might be the bloody British Government and you might have some say over the Yard but don’t you stand there and Lord over me you posh bastard, I may not be as smart as you Myc but I’m not stupid.”
Mycroft however found himself unable to be so bold as to say the words. “Tomorrow, perhaps the holiday. Over drinks or a nice dinner.” All excuses.
“I have a date tonight. I’ll be back tonight, less then things go well then. You know” John said with a cheeky little wink as he walked through the living room.
So Sherlock did not shy away from his wondering what was going on with DI Lestrade. Maybe he should have … because some things, you can never delete.
His wife was a murderer.. no ex wife, there was no way he could trust her now. In truth this was the first time he had thought of her in days. Johns entire world had become these four walls and this man laying before him.
The army was an escape; it was a chance to do something meaningful with his life. John would patch up fellow servicemen as best he could so they could be sent back to their loved ones. Not all of them made it; it was days like that when he held a young soldier had that he couldn't save. Looking into frightened eyes some times, they would give him letters and ask him to be sure they were sent. Other times the Youngman would be to far gone to be lucid and call out the names of friends, family, or lovers.
He had been captured by some thugs some where in eastern Russia, he had been sloppy. The great Sherlock Holmes made a mistake that cost him dearly. Now he was chained up in this hell hole being tortured day after day. He would zone out during the beatings and cower in his mind palace cherished rooms that were all John. It would be worth it if he died here protecting John, Mrs. Hudson, Di Lestrade even that irksome Mycroft who was more than capable of taking care of himself. I would all be worth what Sherlock had learned his past year since his supposed death, he wasn't a sociopath after all. Because he loved them all, because he gave up everything for them.
He looked back at the door they creaked and the metal began to glow and melt. There was not much time.
Overtime, Mycroft to begin to see the DI differently. Even for a goldfish; Greg was interesting. He was funny, honest. Dare he admit the man was handsome?
Greg turned rising up on his elbow, "Moving kind of fast aren't you Mister Holmes?" he said with a smirk.
After Sherlock had gone unresponsive Mycroft opened a 3way call and requested the line be traced by satellite and...Discretely. He already had a general idea but that was not enough not now, not when his brother could very well be dying.  He knew the police or emergency services would not make it there any sooner than he could, not when he could easily alter the flow of traffic if need be.
That’s when John took the detectives too cool, too thin hand in his. They had all been right, the woman, Donavan, all the women John ever tried to date. Even Mary.
Taking the elevator of the government facility down to the basement floor everyone working on the lower levels seemed to freeze at the tell-tail sound of footsteps and accompanied tap of an umbrella tip. The Iceman, most dangerous man most would ever meet, and he did not looked pleased.
"From this moment on you will address me as Mistress. This session will last for two hours, I have noted your few limits and will abide by them.  During this session you will reach new heights of pleasure and be pushed beyond what you felt you where ever capable of feeling. Do you understand?"
Mycroft could read the signs, the shift in the air. An east wind was coming; Sherlock was becoming more agitated with Moriarty on the lamb. Something had to give somewhere and looked as if the comfort of old habits might rear their ugly head.
His hand closed around the device spiriting it off the table and up to his ear as the call picked up. “Yes Brother mine.”  He said having seen the Caller ID.
The second hit is always more heavy handed but that has to be expected. The first was a warm up, to be acclimated to the waters as they say. This one will last longer and I can float farther out to sea.
“I love him, and I’m going to tell him as much. I’ve been a ghost for far too long, I’d like to live for once. Maybe you should as well. I think you’ll find the DI isn’t all he seems. I’m really surprised you haven’t deduced that, are you slipping in your old age brother mine?”
Mycroft steepled his fingers and took a breath, " There's something I must tell you doctor Watson and it is of the up most Importance that it not leave this room. It will be difficult to understand but please know it was never meant to turn out like this."
Even when he thought Sherlock was dead, he couldn’t forget him, couldn’t wash his mind free of wild dark hair and long limbs smooth as porcelain. That grin when the man knew the answer to a problem, the way he would hold it because it was the best part of the game to know something no one else did. John missed it all.
He remembered making it up the drive and staff running out to his car unloading an unconscious Sherlock homes from the back seat.  Anthea was there, her gentle hand falling on his shoulder leading him into the sitting room murmuring gently “Your brother will be taken care of sir.”
“Mycroft, what is it.” This time his voice was softer more serious, the irritation at being pulled away from his slides now forgotten.
It took hours before John exited the room the team had disappeared into. He looked ragged as he slid down the wall pulling off the solid rubber gloves and tossing them in a near by bin. " He's alive."
The older man leaned in nipping at the government operatives neck playfully; "I think you liked it a bit rough Myc. So how about we do it again in our new bed at your place yeah"
John didn't question the plan, he was a soldier and now he had his marching orders. It had to be him, the elder Holmes would trust no one else with the safety of his little brother. Even if it started a war, John finally understood the love that the supposed ice man had for Sherlock.
I look forward to your comments and follows depending how this fandom experiment goes I may consider doing a multi chapter sherlock fic in the future.
Accepting Sherlock back after that little stunt had been nearly impossible, but who was John kidding. He would always follow Sherlock Holmes.
Molly stretched her self out on the floor shivered at the cold tile, it some how soothed the heat of her own skin. It was good, everything was so good. She jolted feeling a heel hook the hem of her slip,Irenes' shoe gliding along her back raising the garment up high until it lay about her shoulder blades pooled at the back of her neck.
It is simple really, a chemical compound, something I can understand. C21H23NO5; with a molecular mass of 369.41 g/mol. Child’s play, a fluid ticket to euphoria.
"Sherlock of all the things we have been through I think you should already know I won't leave." John smiled sitting down on the side of the bed, his eyes lingering perhaps longer than he would like to admit.
Resigned to leave; maybe just send Sherlock a text or come back next week, John turned and started down. However he was meet at the bottom of the stairs by his former Landlady ‘not housekeeper’ Ms. Hudson.
That's when the tears finally came, he had never cried for all the force and pain that had been inflected on him but this, realizing he had lost. He would never see his John again... it wrecked him to the core. A bitter sob ripped from his throat, the sound a horse screaming wail that turned the stomach. " I don't want to die... please.. I'm not finished yet! "
It was a quarter after one and Mycroft Holmes lay alone on his big expensive bed in the master suite of is Camden home. It felt cold and lonely; he never thought he would be so affected by such things. When he started this relationship with the Detective inspector, he honestly believed that the inevitable end would come and he would graciously accept it. That it might be somewhat uncomfortable as the loss of anything that one had grown accustom to might be. However, this, he had not expected to feel completely paralyzed. The first day was numb and his day continued like it always had, the first night had been.
Sherlock couldn't help it that one wasn't one of his better lies but really; if she was that much of an idiot to believe it then yes it was hilarious. His lips quirked at the corner, "Perhaps it has something to do with that floral jumper you wore on your last date?"
Irene Adler steeped behind her newest client, she smiled running her glossy red nails down the young womans arms, watching the flex of her hands gripping the tables edge at the touch.
Mycroft could be seen shouting in the rear-view mirror holding Rosie's carrier in one hand and his signature umbrella in the other.
When John opened his eyes everything felt blurry, what time was it? If the hazy cool blue light of the room was any indication it was dusk or perhaps dawn?Oh but he was in a room, a hospital then.
When John Watson was a little boy, he always knew that one day he would bond. He would find a kind, smart omega or maybe a beta and have a lovely little family. They would be happy, like his parents had been before his father died. He would be a good alpha and work hard for his mate and pups. Maybe have a house on a nice street in the city. It was a picture perfect dream just like every child dreams.
"Any way, point is...your a disaster unto yourself but in the most beautiful sense of the world. You turned my world upside down and there was no walking away from the chaos whole, because I lost half of my heart that day out side Barts. I lost it ...because it belonged to you. "Johns hand gripped his and placed a light kiss over his knuckles.
His through clenched looking at the simple request. He had to take it; he needed Gregory Lestrade to much to let him go.
John had a lot to do today. With Christmas coming up, his blog, moving back in with Sherlock ( That last one seemed to take up loads of his time. Some times in a good way thank you very much.) Still there was so much to do and so little time.
He stumbled through the flames shielding his face as they flared in his path. Through the flat, the halls of the university, the morgue, breaking through a set of doors that looked mysteriously like those of New Scotland yard.
Fortunately for John he would get to keep his mobile, unfortunately for Sherlock – he was going to lose his lunch – and respect for Lestrade.
When it was over, Molly sat wrapped in a warm blanket. An Associate of Miss Adlers came  in at the end of the session. She poured them both tea and they now sat on the sofa in Mollys office. She was surprised with the tenderness Irene expressed. Checking her over with a kind smile, telling her how well she had done. The praise made her blush, she had expected the woman to leave but instead she remained allowing molly to rest her head on her leg, carding those brilliant red nails through her hair. " You know dear, I don't think paid appointments suit you. Your far to precious of a little gem to let go, i think instead a more ..permanent arrangement. "
Was Sherlock blushing…god yes he was. John wanted to end this whole charade now but he needed to know, just one more observation to support and then he could come clean. Then he could tell the infuriatingly brilliant man that it was just a farce. That there was only one man for John Hamish Watson and that was William Sherlock Scott Holmes.  His Best friend!
John sat with his head in his hands. Sherlock had been placed into an induced coma until the drugs could work out of his system. The overdose had been a close call, if John had not found him…
the sight of his little brother laying a pool of his own sick twitching violently under a flickering security light was…Shattering.
He pushed it open slowly and the wave hit him in the face. God who ever Sherlock had in here really should have gone to an omega hostel or a family member because really this was dangerous. “Sherlock?”
"Gregory... I have a proposition, if you're open to it." Holmes began as he fell back against the pillows.
Once inside two men sitting at a folding card table were surprised by the former soldier as he came around the corner putting matching slugs through their brains before they could even draw a weapon. However, a third man had been in an adjacent corridor and saw the blonde haired assassin. Thus the firefight began, After returning fire John quickly reloaded. rolling from behind the small half wall where he had managed to take cover. His bad shoulder protested but it didn't matter. It felt like an eternity when in reality the gun battle that only lasted a few minutes. Once silence fell John cautiously emerged weapon at the ready, one man was still alive clutching at a neck wound that spurted blood. He started up at the stocky man above him, John glared back placing a boot n the center of the mans chest and pointing the muzzle between the villains eyes. " Captain John Hamish Watson, you took something very precious to me, I've come to take it back."
With a swift flick of the wrist the blade swept down ward. Steel glinting in the florescent light as it relived three fingers from the terrorists hand. The man began to scream bloody murder as blood squirted from the stumps of his former digits. "Your MAD! "
Mycroft paused, his brother’s sound of not just surprise but lingering disappointment in the question threw him off. “Yes you are, you came very close Sherlock. To close.”
Caroline dropped her gaze seeming to lose her indignation. "Greg, look we just. Don't work, we haven't for..."
Sherlock whirled around pulling that face that said ' I cant believe you just suggested something so horribly boring'  "John...lets leave the plan making to the genius, when I would like tips on how to remove shrapnel I will consult you."
The perked the elder Holmes up to smirk. " How fortunate I was not making it a choice. Your victim is a Scot, the stagnant ring on her left hand. This is future confirmed by the mud on in the tread of her walking boots as the slight greenish hue is common for algae found in mud around lochs in Scotland. Given the freshness I would say your looking for one in close relation to the British boarder as she obviously arrived by car, yet she did not drive herself as she lacks the  mild scent of petrol a woman her high and build would tend to dribbled the gasoline on there shoes when reengaging the pump handle. There for someone else was with her and that is your murdered, i suggest checking her front pocket for a receipt and checking with the refuel station on there security cameras." A rather satisfied smile crossed Mycrofts face.
Never will I tell him of these...Damnable feelings that consume me. Just as I will never see my reflection in those deep blue eyes so filled with care. Not like how he looks at those women.
Irene smiled dropping the coat she had worn to the floor, her corset and stockings still unseen by her submissive; sure to be a feast for the eye. "Hmm, good girl I think for tonight  the safe word will be..Vatican Cameos." Her lips quirking at the little private joke only known to her.
The warm euphoria that sprints through my femoral vein in a lovely 17 seconds. There is no pain here, no tension, and no anxiety. That initial rise to the mountaintop as the belt hits the floor, the lovely embrace of the plateau. The ceiling becomes a haze and the walls melt into the floor.
"I left a message with the appropriate persons. He is always whinging about how I never ask for his help, this is me doing precisely that."
"I'll always want you Sherlock, so the next time you go off taking on criminal mastermind's. I'd like to get the invite as-well, so someone will be there to patch you up when you do something daft."
He needed a change, so the next logical thing he could think of was to find a roommate, which would hopefully solve two of his problems. One being he paid too much for the shotty little room he was living in, and two having someone to talk to. Oh but there in lay the problem - who would want him for a flat mate?
Sherlock was standing in the lab of St. Barthelme's when he first met John.  The first time he deduced them man he waited to be told off immediately, but that didn't happen.
John made it half way up when something warm and cloying teased his nostrils, it beckoned him in like a siren of the deep threatening to drown him. In an instant, the alpha fought away the instinct to hunt down the owner of that erotic aroma and griped the banister to ground him.
. Defined as a mental uneasiness from suspicion or fear of rivalry, unfaithfulness, etc., as in love or aims. A vigilance in maintaining or guarding something.
Chaos had erupted around him and john was scrambling to tug the younger men out from under the over turned Humvee.
Therefore, Mycroft did what he did best, he watched and monitored and tried his damnedest to stay one-step ahead of his brothers free fall. He watched as a brilliant mind became broken and weary. He watched Sherlock skulk off into drug dens chasing what Mycroft did not know.
"John, come we have clues to follow the game is on!" Sherlock Called out heading off to follow a lead based on his deductions, however he scowled spotting his elder brother standing sentry at the police tape line.
" he's alive isn't he, damn it Mycroft!' John's barely contained rage caused his nails to cut into his palms. " A year and a half Mycroft.. Eighteen bloody months of pure hell ! one word that's all I needed! Where the hell is he I'm gunna punch that prat right in his nose!"
“Tell me.” He said placing his pen down and clasping his hands. Assuming his brother had gone and done something again or some national crisis had started. However if it was the latter he would have seen it coming.
Now however looking at the photos scattered on the floor of his flat, (the photo-album had fallen victim to an adult equivalent of a temper tantrum), and he could see he was wrong.
The younger man rolled his eyes, “Lestrade, you like him but you haven’t told him because you find him painfully heterosexual.”
Sherlock looked at him along moments those bright beautiful eyes narrowing a fraction. “There is no Anthony is there.”
Emotions are messy and unpredictable, they serve little purpose other than to cloud ones judgment. Yet I find myself craving one particular emotion like oxygen, it's all Johns fault.
The torture, the fear, all the things Sherlock quietly carried because he thought he wasn't 'human' and he wasn't 'normal' enough. That things would be better for john better for everyone if he hadn't come back. All these dark echos that choked out a brilliant mind and drove it to this.
Nightmares, those where the worst. John knew the horror that could lurk in the dreaming mind, but this.. this was more. In those days since returning to 221b, John learned more about Sherlock through the haze of withdrawal babbled terrors that he had since the mans return.
The silence between them felt like it stretched on for ages. Sherlock looked away seeing the tears of frustration gathering in his brothers eyes. He had not seen Mycroft cry not since they were children.
This would be their first Christmas as a  couple. As strange as that title seemed but it was true. Maybe it had taken him a bit long to see it but now there was no denying it...he loved Sherlock Holmes. Sure, the detective could try his last nerve but the thought of being without the man was far worse.
I would never ask that of him, he has made it clear that his feeling toward me is platonic, brotherly even. I am certain that if I were to ever under those three words that John would leave. He would realize how broken I was and apologize for leading me to believe that what we have is more than cohabitation. He might even say he cares for me but, not in that way.
"I'm so flattered." He spoke just above a whisper leaning down to capture her lips in a chaste kiss.
The elder Holmes spoke carefully minding his tone and volume. After all he did worry constantly for his little brother and this, this was going to be hard. “Sherlock. It’s John, he’s been shot.”
The detective dashed back from the window and curled up in his seat to pretend he had been innocently watching crap telly this whole time and not busy sabotaging yet another one of Watson's relationships.
Sherlock felt so warm opening his eyes in one of his mind palaces many rooms, this one looked like the garden at his grandmothers home. He was laying in the lush grass watching as the clouds floated past each one flashing images.
Mycroft would always remember the young woman next to him grabbing his hand when the words came from the surgeon’s lips.
That sealed it, that quivering in the detectives tone that shattered Johns resolve. The alpha moved forward and carefully wrapped his arms around the taller man. Feeling how much thinner Sherlock was and how he shook in Johns arms. “I could never hate you, I… I love you Sherlock. I always have.”
Greg's eyes snapped open as he looked over at Mycroft whom was still in bed now half hiding in the duvet.
Mycroft knew Sherlock did it on purpose this time. That was terrifying.  “Yes, thank you for your time doctor. I trust my brother is stable enough now for you to leave.”  It wasn’t a question it was a command.
“There has been a shooting outside of Scotland yard. DI Lestrade was one of those injured, he’s been transported to St.Barts.”
Molly had made the call, she had heard Sherlock talk about.. The Woman. She knew what she was doing the moment she got her hands on Irene Adlers contact information. Something in her hummed with approval as her fingers skimmed over the numbers and made the appointment. Curiosity ..or no, it was deeper than that. She wanted this she always wanted this the problem was finding someone who could give her what she needed..what she craved.
The man was difficult, stubborn, confusing, yet… he was also brilliant and kind in his own way. As much as the proclaimed A-social detective liked to pretend that he did not have feelings, he did. John had seen them; he had watched that beautiful maniac break to pieces inside all while holding his head high. John could see it in Sherlock’s eyes, eyes that could reflect the sunshine and drink in the darkness. Eyes that could look right through you and pierce your heart with the coldest of glares. Eyes that could also beg you not to leave, they reminded him of the Tenerife Sea.
"Mr. Abrin, you where arrested and taken into custody under a mater of national security. The construction of dirty bombs as it were. There is reason to believe that several of these explosives have already been placed and British intelligence would like to know where. So, let us make this simple for everyone and you tell me where they are."
Mycroft was up and slipping out of his night clothes switching the phone to speaker smoothly. “Where are you, look around you and tell me what you see Sherlock.”  He had to keep calm.
"As always my dear your timing is impeccable." He said with a smile as his faithful assistant untied his hands.
"Please please! Come back to me Sherlock, please I forgive you just open your eyes!" John pulled off his jacket wrapping it around Sherlocks broken and frame form. He could hardly recognize the man under all the filth and dried blood. Johns' only comfort found in the sluggish but still measurable pulse. " I just got you back and I will not lose you again you hear me Sherlock Holmes! I will not watch you die again."
Mycroft looked up from his desk as his Pa entered. For once not staring into her phone, she looked him in the eye with an almost apologetic quality in her dark eyes.
"Sherlock..." why must John say his name with such a tone, he should say it nicely like when he is praising his brilliance at a crime scene.
So annoyed in fact he hadn't heard the patter of stocking clad feet until he heard the sweet voice of their owner.
John walked over to the side of the bed his brow furrowed as he began to check the detective over, Dr. Watson of course. Pulse, heart rate, pupils,temperature. It wasn't until Sherlock grabbed his wrists and looked him in the eyes that John paused.
They had fallen victims again to the longing. However, closed doors provided safety. The four walls of their beloved Baker St. flat became a cocoon for the love they had to hide.
Preparation is done with well-practiced measurements, the movements as smooth as the bow across the strings of a violin. Because I know this dance I know it so well, let us see them do something about it now.
John let out a sigh smiling sadly as he took one of Sherlock's hands in his own. "I told you, you don't have to keep apologizing. And I was never really taken away from you, if anything I almost lost you because of Mary and you still wanted me to forgive her. Your a good man Sherlock Holmes even if you don't realize it."
"Yeah I know...," the Di said with a shrug and turned his back, he couldn't watch her leave. He didn't want her to get the satisfaction of seeing him break.
The tone was God Save the Queen so he ignored it. Just Mycroft being… Mycroft, Sherlock was more than happy to let his brother leave the customary message of “ answer your mobile Sherlock I know your there” Of course the British government knew that he was home. Mycroft probably had cameras all over the flat, Sherlock snickered at that idea. He should take to walking around completely starkers. That would teach the fat git.
He knows, he knows and for all the British government and its posturing, he is too weak to stop me. On the other hand, maybe he just does not care anymore. Maybe he never really did, he abandoned me. John abandoned me.
"Eyes forward." The Woman..her voice sent chills along Mollys spine. It was everything she had hoped for.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, " Yes John, have you figured it out now. I love you, I've loved you for such a long time. At first even I didn't realize how fully or how deeply and then ..all at once I came to the horrifying reality that you John Watson are my entire world. I even died for you."
A shiver down his spine as that sensual voice purred into his ear, even if that was all she said for the duration between glances clacking away on her mobile preparing the days schedule.
As his vision slowly started to clear his hearing followed, he could head something off to the side. Soft murmuring, and he could feel something on his hand. John turned his head and saw something he never thought he would.
"Yeah, that's all you'll ever be Greg! Just some run down old copper!" Caroline shouted back as she packed up her belonging into her new boyfriends Audi.  "You're gunna hear from my barrister." she snapped, slamming the trunk closed.
John ran through the compound finding a set of locked doors, he used the keys he'd lifted from one of the dead men. The sight that he was met with stole away whatever composure he had in him"
That was enough to do it; his older brother flushed and got up headed for the door. “Perhaps once you stop this childish nonsense I will be back with your beloved suppressants. Until then I would suggest you stay indoors brother mine. Wouldn’t want you to be caught in an undesirable situation now would we?”  Mycroft cast one last glance over his shoulder. A clear challenge that he knew he had Sherlock under thumb for now.
It was the middle of the night and Sherlock Homles was busy not sleeping, sleep was boring. He had a collection of mold spores he was looking at under the microscope when the phone rang.
How much longer would John awaken in the morning and swear he could hear the melodic notes of a violin floating through the apartment. Only to dash down the hall with unyielding hope, hope to find this was all a bad dream and see his detective swaying before the window in the morning sun. Gliding effortlessly with the instrument he had so cherished in life. How many times that hope was crushed, the name of a dead man falling from his lips in an empty room.
On the other hand, how the man caught a slight blush when John slipped into that commanding tone of Captain Watson.
His vision blurred with tears and darkness crept in at the edges, he didn't hear the sounds of gunfire just beyond the confines of his prison.
Molly sat in the morgue alone, the lights were off save for the soft glow of a single exam light over a steel table. Those were her orders, her skin prickled in goose flesh when the Letter was dropped off that morning. It was sealed in a black envelop, inside a high quality piece of parchment with finely hand pen script detail what would be expected of her.
Maybe it was just a reflex that fatherhood had yet to take away, but John jumped back into the drivers seat as Sherlock leapt through the back window. When did he roll down that window???
It was always high walls and carefully worded statements with Mycroft. The few times he truly smiled or showed an ounce of his own personality was brief at best. Greg counted himself lucky to see the bit of humanity in the British Government.
“It was an overdose Sir, the substance is known as a speed ball, it’s a mixture of heroine and cocaine that is injected. Unfortunately, combining the two is often done with little or no accuracy for quantity of each and this happens. “
"No. no I don't want to hear it Carry you know why? Out of all the things, you have on this bloody tally book of our life for the past 13 years I do not see two every important things. So if you don't care, I'll just keep the kids yeah?"
Sherlock looked down if it was possible he was trying to make his frame smaller with little success, damning these hormones for making his tremble before John. Damn them for making his voice waver and his throat thick with emotions, horrible tedious emotions that made his eyes blur. “You … don’t hate me?”
"If you want something done right, you do it your self." Mycroft Holmes said as he walked back to the long black car that awaited him. On the way the man known to many as the 'British government' slipped a pocket watch from his waist coat eying the ticking hands. A dangerous little smirk tugging at his lips as Holmes opened his trademark Umbrella. Not a moment latter the building behind him exploded with a ball of fire and hail of shattered debris.
It’s different seeing someone you care for, someone you love laying limp with a needle in their arm.
"John, there's something ..I have wanted to say... I never could because I didn't want you to leave."
It was no surprise then upon the younger Holmes return he noticed his elder brothers newest obsession.
"Hey you, you've been out for a few days I was starting to wonder if you'd ever wake up."John reached up with a gentle touch threading his fingers through Sherlocks hair.  "Listen, Mycroft told me everything, I wont lie I am cross with you for faking your death mind, I'm not going to let you off the hook for that one. But I know why you did it, the fact that you almost really did..." John choked up some looking away to compose himself a moment.  " I can't carry on properly with out haveing you living and breathing do you know that? I was a wreak and I realized everything I missed, your silly moods, your distaste for the deerstalker."
The soldier squared up his shoulders and fished that well-worn key from his jacket. He was going to climb those stairs just as he had done for years, only this time he was going to go in that flat and tell Sherlock the truth. Even if the detective couldn’t give him back the feelings, he was looking for it didn’t matter. That could be enough for John. Just being there, just staying by Sherlock’s side.
Mercurial eyes closed as he buried his face against a familiar scared shoulder. "I'm sorry.. I'm so sorry"
Her stops stalled, she didn't like to talk about Sherlock.. for a number of reasons. It was always in the back of her mind though if Jim would ask her to betray her Friend. It wouldn't be far fetched would it? Then again she also wondered if what Sherlock said about Jim was true and maybe the mans fascination with the consulting detective was similar to her own. That hurt to.
Maybe that was always true, Sherlock had been his life for so long. Even after the fall, after the pain that came with it. After feeling betrayed by a lie... it was always Sherlock Holmes.
“no.” the younger man stopped him reaching out a hand. Mycroft had beautiful hands, long slender fingers, and piano hands. “No, I should apologize. It was never my intention to make you feel undervalued in our relationship. I am simply so used to doing things my way and this is all very new to me. This, caring about someone else. However, I would like the chance to try again, because...because I do immensely care for you Gregory. So much so that it’s consumed me these past few days.”
Jim smirked licking at the traces of shimmery lip gloss left from her kiss. "Parting is such sweet sorrow. " He  flourished a bow kissing her hand. "Until next time ."
Turning around the politician nearly dropped his drink. Standing there leaning in the door frame clad in one of his dress shirts, and a pair of  thigh high nylons holding a plate of chocolate cake stood the one woman that could render him speechless.
When morning came it was cold in the apartment as it always was and yet... he was warm, a blanket had been draped over him. Mrs Hudson no doubt. John got up to make tea noticing the time, 6am, that was very early for his aged landlady to be up and about. He paid this no mind, his mind too fogged to hear the soft click of the front door closing or tentative footsteps descending the stairs, had John bothered to look out of the window he would have seen a lanky hooded figure ducking into a waiting car. However doctor Watson did none of those things, he just padded back down the hall to dress for work, pausing only when his nose caught a breeze of cologne. He would smile sadly and shake his head blaming the occurrence as his own mind trying to comfort him. Because Sherlock was gone, and miracles... well.. they just didn't happen.
That's what his brother had told him, that's what logic told him...but then there was that pesky little thing called sentiment. What troublesome thing Caring was, Mycroft had always warned him against it and now he knew why. Because he was different, he shouldn't have expected things would be just like they were before. Shouldn't have assumed John was going to wait for him. The world kept turning after the Fall, maybe it wobbled in spots but it didn't stop. Sherlock had missed his chance and the eleventh hour had passed. Knowing all this didn't take away the sting.
Sherlock grimaced."You call interested I call it stalking, was there no Korean elections to keep you busy or perhaps you where out looking for a pastry shop and got lost."
The entire world seemed to lose its color when Sherlock first heard those words. He needed to know more, Was john alive? Was the injury a serious one? Did he sustain any other wounds? Was it friendly fire or had there been a scrimmage? When did it happen? Where was he?
Gregory smiled to himself leaning over to wrap his arms around the younger man who momentarily froze in surprise. “Myc, you don’t have to be what you are to the world with me. You just have to be you, which is all I have ever wanted. For once, I want you not to have to worry so much, let me all right. Let me take care of you, let me love you.”
Sherlock looked up from his microscope wrinkling his nose. “Do be careful John, by my calculations the amount of venereal disease has increased in the last decade. In-fact you might want to stay home all together”
His nostrils are flaring and his lips are pressed in a firm line. So...angry, no scratch that - enraged would be a more appropriate term now.
John burst into the flat and immediately noticed the stench, poor Mrs. Hudson. She never could handle seeing Sherlock so ill. She would stay away out of respect or maybe it was fear. John had that fear now as he charged toward the bedroom calling out the detective’s name.
That is when it happened , or when John actually took notice of the little things. Like how annoyed or Jealous Sherlock was when pretty girls flirted with the army doctor.
"Your bluffing." The man in the chair tried to school his features as a cold sweat broke on the back of his neck.
Greg just threw his arms wild with a dry laugh, "Take the house, sell it burn it I don't care, here ya know what take the keys to both the cars. I can drive the panda," He fished the yes from his pocket and tossed them at her feet. "Should I take the pictures when I go? Clear you don't want those, that's just proof I ever lived here at all."
The muffled sound of shouting from the sofa was worth it. Maybe know Sherlock would learn to let well enough alone.
Sherlock considered he might have gone over board seeing this new girlfriend of Johns slap the Doctor rather hard.
That's when Sherlock knew, standing there on the ledge at St. Barthelme's. The person he had been searching for, his one had been right there all along.  He had to protect John, even if this was the only way to love the man, he would protect him.
If he was not so calm and so patient with me, if he was not to genuine and loyal; I wouldn't have these nonsensical feelings muddling up my daily life.
a wife, the elder Holmes found himself analyzing the DI, deducing everything about him to try and figure him out down to cellular level if possible? It became a hobby of sorts during the time Sherlock was away.
Molly pushed open the old steel door  revealing a massive empty room and like filtering in through the block glass windows. There was one other thing tho, the person she came her to see the request she should have denied and yet here she was.
Greg sat down on the love seat next to his…what where they now? Ex’s? Lovers? In some weird in between limbo, that was sucking the life out of both of them. That last one was about right.  “You never get drunk.”
They wouldn't get out now, he knew it as he climbed into the small bed next the one man who meant so much. The one man he never wanted to hurt. His friend- only friend, best friend, best... everything.
Now regret was heavy and Lestrade hoped he had not thrown everything away. He reached for the phone typing out a text, he knew Mycroft did not favor them but it was better this way. He did not think he could muster this conversation over the phone.
John hadn't announced himself when he came in as he usually did. Truthfully he wasn't sure what to say.
She felt slightly stupid now.. that was all she could say? Standing in a room with a Criminal genius could do that to you though.
“Maybe  ...A friend or... No Sherlock doesn’t have friends other than me...” John said to himself as he slowly crept back up the stairwell. Sherlock wouldn’t keep a client here, he might be a sociopath but he’s still an alpha and wouldn’t stand a chance against temptation. Even John was having a hard time calming down his heart rate as he reached to door.
The next few hours where a mad dash and swarms of doctors, John all the while trying to detach that part of his mind screaming for that lifeless form to just be ok. Sherlock needed him calm, needed him focused.
Mycroft gathered up the gaunt filthy form of the sibling he used to know, looking into blown glassy eyes that belonged to their mother. He saw nothing but surrender.
“It’s not as if you have an Alpha underfoot to worry about brother mine.” Yes Mycroft liked to rub it in that John no longer lived in 221b, in fact Sherlock’s Doctor Watson was dating some beta woman and had punched Sherlock in the nose upon laying eyes on him.
Greg stepped a side to allow the younger man in, he expected a kind word maybe the offer to have Caroline deported. What he hadn't expected was when the door shut being pounced upon by the elder Holmes.
Moriarty lifted her chin with a cold gentle touch, "Tell me something, when your elbow deep in corpses..do you ever think of me? "
Sherlock groans a bit scooting over patting the side of the bed. "Well come on then Captain Watson, seeing as I require a body guard you better start now. "
An answering coo and giggle was sufficient conversation for the British government. "Is that so? How thrilling."
Then I looked at the flash drive, I said I wouldn’t but the damn thing was practically shouting at me that I had to know. I had to know whom she really was and if she ever really loved me or was I, just part of the plan that she had grown fond of over time.
Pale red rimmed eyes shot back over a angular shoulder staring at him with such shame and fright.  Sherlock made a grab for the bedclothes to cover him self, choking on the strangled pleas of  "Get out!"
The supplemental methadone did little to take the edge off and to a point Mycroft did not think it was going to work. This was just another step toward his brother inevitable fall.
Suddenly he was alone but he could hear something, it was far away but even so he knew his Doctors voice anywhere. It kept him right and warm in those bitter nights in Serbia.
However, of all the things he had seen his flatmate still seemed disconnected. Maybe even more since Holmes's return, there was something heavy hanging on the taller mans shoulders. Something unspoken that clung to him like a second skin.
All in all the trip hadn't been so bad, they wouldn't be starving to death anytime soon. Not that Mrs. Hudson or Sherlock's Mum would allow that anyway. Speaking of the later he really hoped Sherlock remembered to wrap the gift he'd picked out to be from the both of them before they had to leave in the morning.
Sherlock Holmes looked..almost as if he was praying but not quite. His eyes where closed and his head bowed. However instead of clasped hands he held one of Johns.  Whispering against the weather and war torn tan skin.
John still didn't like it, sure he was excited about having some time for just he and Sherlock and with Mrs Hudson away and Molly busy with her new boyfriend  it didn't seem like they would get it. Even so, the idea of leaving his first born child with Mycroft Holmes seemed....."Are you sure?"
"That was...Brilliant." Lestrade gawked before ordering Anderson to check for the receipt which was of course found.
Mycroft Holmes had never been an easy man to get to know, yet somehow Gregory Lestrade had broken down the Iceman’s defenses. It had started as a joint effort to keep the younger Holmes brother out of trouble, after-all Mycroft constantly worried for Sherlock even if he wasn’t prone to brotherly affection.
From that moment on, they became inseparable, that first night John had shot a man to save Sherlock. He knew, people don't just kill people for just anyone. Even when they would fight with each other, they always made up. That's what friends do, Sherlock told himself. He even looked it up because he never really had friends.
Watson crossed the distance faster than he intended to and corned the omega in the kitchen. “You idiot! You absolute idiot!”  He sounded so angry yet he was smiling and that put Sherlock off.
Mycroft smirked spitting out a line of blood, he was surprisingly calm for a man who had been kidnapped by terrorists and beaten with an inch of his life. However, he'd never give them what they wanted. "Should I be worried? Somehow I do not believe that I'm the one in danger here."
Mycrofts eyes narrowed . "I see," he spoke softly hanging his umbrella on the door handle as he  removed his jacket and waist coat, laying them each carefully over a stool before rolling up his sleeves. It would be awful to soil them after all. "You have clearly been miss informed then, because if you truly knew who I was. I assure you that would indeed be afraid, however, it has been shown that there is a link between worry and fear to those with higher IQ's. One might consider this a juxtaposition of something that by evolutionary standards is supposedly disabling."
Once the younger Holmes began his final year at Uni, he just withdrew from everyone. Alternatively, was it before that?
Especially when it came to telling off Donavan and Anderson.  Maybe the self-proclaimed sociopath was not as devoid of sentiment as he would like everyone to think.
John Hamish Watson had survived war. He had been shot, had been captured by mafia assassins, followed after a man everyone said would get him killed one day. But this... losing Sherlock, he wasn't sure he could survive this.
The good doctor just nodded along taking his coat from the hook. "Well lets not have a repeat shall we?" Before Sherlock could disagree he was out the door.
What he did remember were the faces of Gregory Lestrades children, he had met the eldest girl a few times before. She was bright not like her mother who was absent even now. The young woman came in with her younger brother and sister, she sat next to him and didn’t say a word.  It was just comfortable silence as they waited.
By hour 3 Rosie was now hungry and not nearly as thrilled with her Uncle  Mycroft.  Thankfully reinforcements on the way.
The young Holmes had bucked at every effort at salvation. He could not fathom why the other was going to such lengths.
It was a snap decision, Greg knew that. He was just so tired of feeling like another of Mycroft’s puppets, Holmes seem to always have an agenda. Even in their relationship, it felt like everything was on the younger man’s terms. Not to say that Greg felt the need to be the chest beating masculine type. He just wanted the chance to take the lead. To not feel like he was just ‘along for the ride’.
"Of course my dear, how thoughtless of me." He stood beside her next to the double doors that could very well lead to their death. He wordlessly offered his hand his weapon ready in the other.
“I won’t let this happen, you’re going to get better lock, and you hear me. You’re going to live much longer than any of us just out of spite I know it. Now I need you to know it, this is your choice. Please, please Sherlock. Please live.”
"Don't..just don't John..." Sherlock said, he felt ashamed enough for having john see him like this. Plus he could already feel the sensation ebbing from his limbs they felt heavy and his mind felt slow.
An: inspired by this song and the Pic of these cosplayers from Russia, they are ...amazing ..I loved this so yeah here we go.
Gregg laughed scrubbing his hands over his face. "I think I'm open to just about anything right now."
How long had he been here? Mycroft knew he was alive they would check in every few months perhaps if the date passed the British government might take notice.
The man had that slender body and those long legs, John had often fantasized about how much easier it would all be if Sherlock were a woman. He could just turn on that Watson charm and sweep the posh git off his feet.
“Why, tell me why. You are the one who said we had no room for sentiment. That was you! So why Mycroft why prey-tell wont you let me out of this prison to do as I please!” he shouted when his brother came down to bring him dinner.
OK so this will be a collection of one shots based on music, you guys know me for that lol. What can you expect? well I ship a lot of pairings in this series though there will be a large portion of Johnlock. You can also expect both cannon and Au, or alternate views on post fall / return. Also don't be afraid to request a song or pairing I'm open tho anything creatively even if its not my otp I will give it my best shot.
How could he say no to John Watson? After all the adventure, the pain, the friendship... he could never deny John because with out his jumper wearing little army doctor Sherlock Holmes would be completely and utterly alone. Then again, John wasn't his anymore was he? Maybe he never really was his to keep, at the very least Sherlock had done a poor job at keeping him. He wasn't good at that sort of thing though, he didn't have friends... just one.
His captors scoffed, stepping forward to jerk the blindfold away from his eyes. "Don't be so cocky Mr. Holmes; you are in no position to make threats!"
The anger shattered, like being hit with a wrecking ball. "what.." to find out Sherlock was alive but then... sure he wanted to hit him but he also wanted to kiss the breath out of that brilliant sociopath. It had taken losing Sherlock to realize that he loved him more than anyone or anything, it broke John to pieces.
It was coming from.. No, that couldn't be right. John thought as he approached the door to Sherlock bedroom.
After all the mourners had left a single black car was left dealing on the cemetery as a stately man in a 3 piece suit stood before a freshly lay grave marker.
He wanted to scream to cry, but since that day it was just a dull horrible ache that wouldn't give an inch. When he was able to shed tears it did nothing to ease the grief that stabbed through his very soul. Nothing helped because nothing would bring Sherlock back. " Just one more miracle that's all I ask, just stop.. stop this, stop being dead." how many times had he made that wish?
He had studied probabilities, the divorce rates and the marriage rates along with birth rates and murder by spouse. If one factored in all the pros and cons of that annoying thing, called love the answer was clear.
It made something turn cold in me when I thought about the danger nights, the few times I had helped Sherlock off a mild withdrawal.
The DI was drawn out of his morose thinking by the doorbell, he half hoped it was Carlines new beau having the idiocy to come back and ask for directions so he could sock the prat in the jaw. However when Greg opened the door he saw a familiar face in a three-piece suit.
The thought caused him to pause, hand loosely wrapped around the doorknob. No. He couldn’t think that. The door slid open and here the smell was worse, John knew why. He had treated enough junkies in the clinic. Sherlock wasn’t just any junkie thought.
John curled his fingers around Sherlock's and the detectives head shot up. His light eyes rimed in red and glistening tears.
John found himself wandering around in daze after the reality of his feelings really sunk in. Sherlock was not what you would call
Silence.. His brother was never just silent, he always had some little quip or snarky remark. They where Holmes’ its what they do.
Not that he would eat it. In the last few days Sherlock’s new tactic was refusing food. Saying he would eat when they let him go.
Shouting brought the consulting detective out of his thoughts only to be meet with a bucket of ice water bing thrown on his already frail form. They thought he was a spy, an mi6 operative. It was better that way, it was better because he knew no national secrets, none of much Import. Unless they wanted to know how he had deduced that 11 male members of Parliament were currently cheating on their wives,4 of those with other men. Or that several more were frequent drug users and 2 who had a fondness for wearing ladies knickers . Doubtful that's what they wanted to know. However anything Sherlock deemed as dull he deleted, he had a tendency to only retain the interesting and embarrassing bits, none of which would save his life at the moment.
That one hurt, that one cut right to the quick. Johns' look of complete and utter disappointment. He was right. Looking back now Sherlock was glad that wasn't the last conversation they had, as selfish as it was.
The politicians face scrunched up. “No, I should thank you to drop this matter as I have no idea as to whom you are referring.”
Taking up the needle again and loading the chamber, I think about that game the Russians play, one bullet in the chamber. It is like that isn’t it?
The rapid fire demands were fielded as much as Mycroft had information for. Unfortunately he had only just been alerted an hour before and had been given the run around as to fining out the Doctors status.
The detective's cheeks went red and he crossed his arms. "It wouldn't have worked out with them; you're too good for them."
There had been a convoy ambush and there where many wounded including Captain Watson. As far as the information Mycroft could gather the man was alive.
There is clarity in pain, when the adrenalin subsides and your mind slips into a low hum. When all those simple things become clear.
Taking out a plum button down he pressed his nose into the collar taking in the warm scent that was complexly blended and yet perfectly suited to its owner. How pathetic this was seeking comfort in un-laundered garments, how shameful that only now John realized that he missed this smell. Only now when the tears came and his knees betrayed him crumpling his form and bowing to the remnants of a life to short. "Please... just one more miracle ..Sherlock ..just one just for me."
"why am I here Mycroft." John Watson said tersely sitting down across form the elder Holmes whom had of course abducted him from the Tesco.
"Shall we Sir?" She asked, excitement glittering in her warm dark eyes. She always did love the fray.
John laughed, how hard he had worked to fight what everyone said about them. Yet here he sat, reaching out to card his fingers through dark erodent curls. "Wake up Sherlock, I need to tell you something and I know you don't like repetitiveness. So wake up cause I'm only gunna say it once."
After that I couldn’t stay, but I couldn’t go back either, that would have been like admitting I was wrong. I’m just as stubborn as that lunatic.
John signed and chuckled to himself. “I'm not getting you Valium. You'll be fine, I will put the kettle on. Ya know...I didn't Mycroft would be that flexible.”
John grabbed him by the labels and hauled him inside slamming the door behind them before shoving Sherlock up against the closed entrance. Holmes flinched waiting to be struck again; he would have deserved it to. However, he felt lips pressed to his own and a stout sturdy body pressing him into the door. The detective moaned into the heated kiss.
Captain Watson couldn’t give up though, he had to trudge over bodies and creep along the walls of the ramshackle building with his gun at the ready. He had to calm his heart and train his mind because above all... he had to survive.
He didn't expect Sherlock's lashes to flutter when they did. Lids slowly peeling back with a glassy almost drunk look in those usually bright clever eyes. The Doctor jumped to his feet immediately looking the detective over and pressing the call button.
Four guards at the door, the silencer made it almost too easy taking each in rapid secession. John dropped those men with out batting an eye. He wasn't concerned with surveillance, the place was little more than an abandoned bunker running off a generator. All the power was concentrated on the few lights and likely a single set of rooms for heat and water.
John looked up to see Sherlock in nothing but his bathrobe his hair wet and curled at the ends, drops of water turning the powder blue dressing gown dark at his shoulders where the water dappled the fabric.
Sherlock Holmes always thought feelings were over rated and messy. Love was among the worst of those human expressions. Perhaps the most telling thing about the self-proclaimed sociopath's disdain for the emotion was that deep down; he didn't believe anyone could love him.
Sherlock sat up against the dingy cell wall remembering Johns' words, " you always believed in me.. my Doctor Watson, you believed even when I didn't. I understand now John... there is an advantage in caring, my caring will keep you safe."
Friends were not jealous though when other friends had dates and friends did not typically offer them selves up to be blown to bits by a bomb at the hands of a crazed maniac. However, not everyone was like them.
John Watson was always the nice guy, the guy that women dated because he was well. Just so nice. However, nice didn't always equal staying power. Nice guys often did finish last in their youth because it was the bad boys who were interesting.
There was only one-way to be sure, it was underhanded yes. However, this was an experiment and Sherlock would have commended his cleverness once John told the man everything was fine.
He wasted no time crossing the room to her, brushing a hand over her cheek with a sincere smile. "I'm not sure there not sweeter things my dear."
Going over in his mind the things the older man had said, he had no idea Gregory felt that way. He knew Lestrade could become annoyed but he hid all this resentment masterfully well. It hurt to know that Greg felt so under-appreciated, like little more than another of Mycroft’s employees did.
There was so much smoke, it was black and swirled high charring everything. The flames licked up the walls, the paper curled and flecked away under the onslaught. He watched the happy face shot into the wall scorch into an evil grimace.
This was wrong, sinful and wrong... And they couldn't stop. They fell so fast that by the time either man realized what was happening it was to late . John loved Sherlock and Sherlock loved him.
"Oh about I do you one better yeah? We can settle all this right here right now; all you want is everything yeah?" He said waving the 11 page print out of the house and inventory off all their belongs the woman had handed him this morning before she started packing.
"Alright, alright...hand her here." Lestrade took the little on in one arm and fished deep into the baby bag for a moment with his free hand before pulling up a pacifier. Upon popping the little nipple in the babes mouth Rosie when silent and snuggled against the mans shoulder. She knew her uncle Lestrade from all the fun crime scenes daddy and papa took her to.
The light was so bright here, looking up he had to squint at the spiral staircase. This had been in his grandmother's house in France.
"Sherlock did you even ask him first." John looks a bit skeptical as Sherlock takes little Rosie out of the back seat in her carrier.
When they broke apart, Sherlock stared dumbly at his blogger, lost in a haze of what had just happened.
This would take hours to delete... and lots of take away to comfort the mental scars he now had. Because there was Mycroft Holmes with pants down around his knees and his Assistant with her skirt bunched around her ribs sprawled across his desk.
"Perhaps, honesty John if she was that slow then I was doing you a favor, you shouldn't lower your self to someone who has a far below average IQ. If that's what you're after I'm sure you could call after Anderson and inquire if he has a sister... that gene pool is shallow enough."
He flexed his fingers to test mobility, Left hand..good..Right hand..oh there's something..no..there's..Shifting his eyes to the right he saw a head of scruffy blond hair resting on the bed next to his hip, he felt a hand holding his.
The thing Sherlock had feared most, his eyes glistened feeling the cracks forming in his carefully constructed walls. He pulled his hand away and rolled onto this side away from John, expecting the man to leave the room immediately.  he murmured into the pillow "don't worry, you have made it perfectly clear you are in fact very heterosexual. I do not intend to impose anything on you, I simply thought you should know."
That's why Sherlock didn't stop, he climbed those stairs and grabbed at the red hot doorknob that seared the flesh on his hands and brought tears to his eyes. "John.."
Not that a certain bathrobe clad detective had been very helpful. 'Can you go to the shops John, Have you seen the Skull John, We're out of tea John.' Honestly, the man would lose his head if it wasn't firmly attached.
"Out first Christmas...blimey." John muttered making his way up the stairs of 221b. He entered the flat and found it quiet. The source of the uncharacteristic peace was laying on the sofa. John couldn't help but snap a photo. "A happy Christmas indeed."
Mycroft felt everything in him screech to a halt as his foot pressed firmer on the gas. “Sherlock…” nothing.
It would seem cellular liaisons was all the rage for middle-aged-men in London. The Git would glance at his phone then pocket it, or be typing away with one hand, the other gingerly swinging that blasted umbrella.
“I’m taking a risk even letting you in here, I won’t have a junkie tampering with evidence as well, so you sober up then I’ll give you a case.”
Sherlock backed himself into the corner, his shoulders rolled forward and arms tighten around his middle. “You wouldn’t? What about Mary, what about …John you shaved your mustache. Why would you…I said I didn’t like it and now it’s gone. You’re here and you’re smiling, your eyes are dilated and your posture is open considering I have been lying to you about my nature since we meet and yet…you’re not angry.”
"I see now why mother hired nannys to deal with Sherlocks nappies....this is ...well it's ...lord.." He looked away gagging before snatching away the offending material and chucking it in the rubbish bin. Rosie meanwhile just giggle and waved her arms and legs.
The heat was bad enough leaving his body sticky and sweltering, but the grit of dust now coating his skin made it that much worse.
It was no small task insuring that the British government was prepared to start his day, and for Mycroft Holmes' PA Anthea, it was a job she did gladly.
Mycroft wracked his brain to pinpoint the moment when the little boy who used to follow him around playing deductions and pirates turned into the brooding angry youth before him.  Mycroft had been working so hard to secure his ‘minor position in the British government’ too busy to see the signs until he was receiving a call that his little brother had been found passed out in the dormitories.
John crushed their lips together dominating the detectives mouth with such hunger and desperation. He needed this, he wanted this, just like Sherlock had described... it hit him with such force that all this time. He loved Sherlock Holmes.
When he got Sherlock back, John wasn’t going to let him go. Not for anything. Even if he thought the world’s only consulting detective was an Alpha at the time. Even if they could never be anything more than friends could, it would be enough.
The first hour was....well it wasn't that bad he mostly stared at the sleeping bundle and tried to convince Anthea that it was her job to help him. This was met with laughter and his assistant leaving him alone.  Well, at lest Sherlock left supplies.
She flitted her eyes to the clock on the wall, it was time. On que the tap of high heels approached down the corridor outside. Closer and closer increasing her breath with anticipation.
"Yes I should think that would be much better now. Now little Miss, i do believe you need to be cleaned and re-attired yes?"
It was 3:30 am when Mycroft’s mobile chimed on his nightstand. He hadn’t been in bed long having just concluded some late night international calls. This however was not the ring associated with his work; this urgent little chirping was specific to a very short list of numbers.
Sherlock melted in those warm deceptively strong arms, resting his head on Johns shoulder. "I didn't want to, I never wanted to. I ...I needed you every day."
As Sherlock rested his head on Johns chest just listening to the older mans steady heart beat he said " You can't go back you know, and even if you could I wouldn't allow it. You will just have to occupy yourself here in London me. I assure you it won't be dull.  "
Sherlock was alone in the room they had converted for him, what was once a small recreational room in the basement had been converted to a bedroom and bath. Safety precautions taken of course, no sharp implements of dangerous wears.  It was clear in the first few days the over dose was not accidental. Mycroft wasn’t taking any chances.
“Shhh, it’s alright brother mine, it’s alright now. Do relax, nothing is going to hurt you just breathe and relax.” the elder Holmes spoke calmly and evenly still stroking back Sherlock’s hair.
"I mean exactly as I have said, Sherlock faked his death to take down Moriartys' crime ring. I aided him in doing so and have been keeping track in his movements over Europe and the Middle East. Unfortunately, I believe he has been compromised. Our last contact was during his infiltration of a cell in Russia. Despite my influence it appears someone with in her Majesties government is blocking my every attempts to send in a retrieval team. That, John Watson is where you come in."
He went home alone to Baker street and trudged up those stairs, just like a million times before. Taking off that horrid tux and atrocious yellow tie. Tossing aside like the fabric like it burned, he found himself sulking in his chair alone staring at the empty one across. Molly was right, he did look sad when john wasn't around.
“John I...I couldn’t tell you I couldn’t tell anyone. You know how things are; even if it’s not as bad as it used be I still could not have done the Work if anyone knew. You wouldn’t have stayed if you knew why are you even here now? For god sakes John say something!” Sherlock was half shouting half pleading.
The DI could tell though that behind that aristocratic poise was a kind man with a lot of fear. Fear to lose, fear to give, and fear to be seen as weak by those who might use familial sentiments against him.
So John hadn't hesitated to plop his little girl down in the brunettes lap before announcing his trip out. "I'll be back soon, and Sherlock when you have to change her do redress her...we can't just let her run around starkers."
"Mycroft..aren't you even going to be hear when he wakes up?" John looked at the politician as the man turned to leave.
“Doubtful John, all information is useful and if it isn't I can always delete it.” yes because that was so easily done wasn't it? After all he had deleted the entire solar system, John didn't think that was possible and yet he had.
For so long she had hoped it would be the consulting detective that would take her with those elegant hands ..she had envisioned it hundreds of times. Long nimble fingers tight around her throat, that silken baritone speaking into her ear. Ordering her onto her knees.
John came into Sherlock's bedroom, John had been sleeping on there on and off to keep an eye on his flatmate, he walked in to find Sherlock shirtless laying atop the duvet staring at the ceiling.
By the 2nd hour, Rosie was  awake and needed attention. It wasn't hard to tell what she needed based on the smell.
Gregory Lestrade stood at the door way watching a frazzled Mycroft with spit up on his vest and his hair mussed from agitated fingers.
John would wonder what that was like to love someone so much to call his or her name with your last breath.
Over the last couple of years since the incident they got closer, Greg's kids knew Mycroft even liked him. Moreover, right now that was why Greg didn't pull away.
I am just a machine, which is what John said. Machines require maintenance when they are damaged; their only value is in their function. My function is my intelligence, I need that utility to properly complete The Work and thus I need maintenance. I need to clear away the debris left in the wake of this pitiable longing. Sweep out the halls of my mind palace and delete all the useless information.
This thing they had was quiet and steady, it happened all by accident and yet in those moments of sweet out of control emotion  Mycroft would later deny, had been the most thrilling of his life. To have the attentions of a beautiful creature such as she? Considering how difficult he could be?
Before John could even stop her or ask what the devil she was, talking about the small woman had scurried off into her own flat. The Doctor looked down into the box, bottle water, cup noodles, protein bars, Alpha body spray and a narrow black box with a white font printed ‘Little Helper’. John blushed to the tip of his ears, he was aware of what that last one was. He had dated omegas before and knew a heat aid when he saw one. Why was Ms. Hudson the one to go and get these things, if Sherlock had some omega in there he should have been the one to get the supplies for them.
Although he doubted very much his frigid brother had much of a personal life...do cave trolls mate? Who knew, the point was Sherlock had had enough of this weird teenage girl texting with the people around him. He swore to himself that if he caught John engaged in such antics he was going to throw the Doctors phone into the Tames.
"Myc..." His voice stuttered a bit. There it was, he couldn't hold it not in front of Mycroft Holmes.
Sherlock wasn't listening of course, as was par -for-course with him. Already up the steps and inside the Diogenes club.  Before John could follow the consulting detective came running out Sans-baby  yelling - "DRIVE"
She could feel his gaze and allowed it, swaying her hips in step down the hall. "There are easily a hundred men out there; perhaps you should concentrate on that."
Molly found her self panting after only a 15  minuets in, bent over the exam table with her slip pulled lewdly over her bare backside. Irene was breath taking, powerful and poised. "P-Please Mistress! I..I can take more!" She moaned feeling a hand caressing and squeezing her already ruddy red buttock.
It was too often that this train of thought entered Mycroft Holmes’s mind. Especially when the topic of his little brother Sherlock came to mind. Sherlock seemed to falling off the path quite frequently these days.
“Hello Gregory. My, isn’t this sentimental of me. Surely a man of my intelligence should know speaking to marble and dirt is meaningless. I don’t care though, I put this off far too long you see. I...I really must apologize for not being honest with you. For not telling you how I cared for you and now you’re gone. I never thought anyone could ever slip into my heart and somehow you became that exception. Your smile, your understanding, even your irritation it all kept me alive. You made me more Gregory, I wish I had had the courage to express that to you before now.” Mycroft took a breath to clear away the thick lump in his throat. It had been there all day taunting him.
"John....ah..John please " breathless words in deep registry broke the silence in 221b. The bedroom was to hot and air to thick around them.
Still It didn't take much convincing before the good doctor had a consulting detective curled up on his hospital bed. All legs and and arms cling with a unexpected gentility.
Sherlock had to laugh, for someone who owned several finely tailored Bespoke suited he'd ended up in nothing but a bed sheet in Buckingham palace. They had such good times together, it was sad to think it was all over now .
The next time Sherlock opened his eyes everything hurt. Why?  Looking around the world began to gain definition and color, this was a hospital? No ..to nice and no horrid watercolor on the wall. No this was private ah of course ..Mycroft. Seemed he wasn't dead after all so that was a bonus, but then how did that happen? Sherlock sifted quickly through his catalogs of memories but for the life of him couldn't find data on the escape. This was troubling, he never liked not knowing things.
The posh agent stood tall adjusting his shirt cuffs before lifting his suit jacket from a nearby table. Taking a moment to push away any dust before slipping it on. Anthea standing to his right pulled a handgun from her belt holding it at the ready.
It had happened by accident, Sherlock had not been back long and Mycroft in all his careful planning had ‘forgotten’ Sherlock’s medication. The Suppressants and scent stabilizers were pivotal if he was to continue The Work. Of course, his brother told him that he should be fine, after all, he had been through quite an ordeal with traipsing all over the world unraveling Moriarty’s network. It might do him some good to go off the chemicals for a while.
But it was, the broken sound of a man whose heart was breaking into pieces. The sounds of the worlds only consulting detective letting out the emotions he worked so hard to pretend that he didn't have.
“My hello John dear have you come home to us then? I’m sure Sherlock will be please considering.” She winked and handed John a box of grocery. “Off you go dear, careful though the poor thing is a bit not good, you should have known better than to keep him waiting. You know I adore you both but I’m not your House keeper.”
"No, I'm very busy and your wasting my time. Now I have exactly 5 minutes and 45 seconds before my patience will indeed run out. You will not wish to be here for that I can assure you, so where are the bombs?"
John crossed the room quickly grinning like the Cheshire cat, placing his hands on the table and leaned closer to Sherlock. The action effectively cutting off the man’s nervously worded sentence.  “About not being gay? Yes I have however; I never said I wasn’t bisexual now did I?”
The more the thought about it however, the worse it got. He did care a great deal about the detective, more than he had any other friend he ever had. Not just that; Sherlock was beautiful.
“You better live, you hear me? Because I’m going to throttle you when you wake up. Then I’m going to kiss you. So you stay with me Sherlock. You stay and I promise I will never leave you again. I will do whatever I can to make this right.”
"But things are not always as they seem Mr. Abrin." A smile predatory in nature crossed Holmes' lips as the slide of metal revealed the true nature of his prized accessory. A sword, " Fear as it turns out, is very adaptive."
John could see it and he didn't care, let them here. He wrapped his arms around his detective's lithe body and whispered, "I love you."
Slowly large hands slid around Johns back and griped his coat. He felt Sherlock relax and his head find the crook of John’s neck, fluttering warm uneven breaths over the sliver of skin about the collar of his shirt. “John…”
The guard paced back and forth in front of his cell, when suddenly the man stopped. The henchmen looked around listening to a distant sound somewhere in the warehouse.
“I …I can’t find my way…Myc…” The younger man’s tone seemed sullen and far away, something lingering in the timber. Of course, he was high.
"Don't you ever do that again, you promise me! I swear to god Sherlock if you ever leave me again I will find you and kill you myself."
The younger Holmes brother, intended on simply storming in and pretending to be in stroppy mood, Mycroft was usually keen to blame others for that and that's where his lovely little Doctor Watson came in...as cannon fodder. It would be perfect! ...well it was perfect until Sherlock through open the doors to his brothers office and stopped dead in his tracks.
"Oh Sherly, I told you didn't I? I told you I'd burn the heart out of you." Moriarty.... No he was ..he was dead .
They were sitting in the DI's office waiting for some files when a little chime went up from the discarded coat hanging on the back of Lestrade's desk chair.
Unlocking the cell door she smiled, such a welcome sight that mischievous little grin. "Hello Sir, Miss me?"
Greg sat on the sofa tempted to drown his sorrows with whiskey, unfortunately his two children asleep upstairs prevented that plan from taking off. He looked over the papers again with distaste: His fathers old Gibson Guitar, his Grandmothers diamond ring. Grand'Mere Lestrade wore that band for over fifty years, Carline didn't even like her she just wrote it out of spite.
It was coming from the flat but…unless Sherlock had an omega in there. No, John truly doubted that. Still, people can change after two years. In addition, if that scent was any indication then the omega was in preheated already and John’s presence would not be welcomed at all.
Sherlock tested his shackles, he mildly considered all of the blood on his arms and wrists might work as a effective lubricant and he could slip his hand out. That proved false, such a disappointment that was. "I'm sorry John it looks like I'm not coming back." he murmured into the darkness. " I have been running for my life all over the globe, I've killed...so many people for you and you will never know."
She stood quietly feeling vulnerable under those dark eyes. Even so she shiver along her spine urged her steps closer. "Curiosity killed the cat didn't it?"
it crooned. That voice would always stop him and he never knew why. " I can't, I can't keep going with out you. I don't know how... I was so lonely and you gave me so much.. I just wish I could have told you,that I could have saved you. " John sobbed collapsing into his chair.
