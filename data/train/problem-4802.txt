The soil is soft and muddy under his boots, his heels sinking in with each step. His way toward the river is accompanied by the drone and bites of mosquitos, who are out in numbers to rival the stars above.
He dozes in and out of sleep, dreaming of Tony touching him. Thirst and soreness keep him from losing consciousness entirely. In a moment of wakefulness, he knows he can’t go through this again. He can’t bear to see San Francisco again. It’s supposed to be a mirror of Tony, bold and brilliant and beautiful, but it feels like a reflection of Steve, instead: desperate, eating its own tail, needing Tony to save the day. He cries again, dry, choking sobs, until he wears himself out and his thoughts slip from his grasp once more.
“You seriously stayed up the rest of the night?” Sam asks, though he sounds more incredulous than concerned. “You’re lucky you don’t need sleep like the rest of us.”
“Oh.” Tony stares, his eyebrows starting to knit together before he seems to remember himself and breaks into a grin. “I knew it would work,” he says smugly. “Bruce is the best science bro ever.”
“Mm-hm.” Stark doesn’t look like he believes that for a second, but he fiddles at the casing with some tools until it pops open. “How’s the wild goose chase, then?” he asks, peering at the wires inside.
Cap knows he’s fighting for freedom against an oppressive law. His certainty and clarity fortify his power and strength.
Steve looks incensed at himself for saying—not only saying, but believing—that compromise is possible. He still said it. He’s not taking it back.
It's nigh unto sundown and Tony's just about pertend up when Red Wolf, Luke Cage, Missus Barnes, and Wong ride up, Apple cantering alongside them.
Before he can fire again, a crowd of women comes between Tony and Lester. Missus Danvers, Missus Knight, Missus Wilson, Missus Williams, Missus Storm. The town widows.
Steve can read Tony in a fight. The years they spent working side-by-side translates—as Steve knows all too well—into facing him as an opponent. And he knows his own moves, the way he’ll lift his shield like
“I don’t know, Shellhead! Looks like those damn Skrulls are pulling another trick out of their sleeves!”
Loki’s gift is a framed photo collage of herself, portraying at least two of her genders and a variety of elaborate costumes. Other than that, the remaining presents are blocks of cheese or bottles of alcohol, and Steve starts to feel self-conscious that so many people got Tony cheese-related presents, too.
He opens the panel for the security system locking the door. Without specialized tools, there’s no good way to make the door open without setting off alarms. And the last thing he needs is for Steve to know he’s sneaking around behind his back, looking for answers Steve doesn’t want to give.
The sun is out when Steve arrives in San Francisco. The taxi driver, who insists on carrying and stowing Steve’s luggage for him, can’t stop talking about how unseasonably hot it is. The dashboard thermostat reads 72F.
This time when the doors finally open, it’s James Rhodes blocking the doorway, looking unimpressed. It doesn’t help that Steve’s never sure how to address him. They don’t really have classes together, and while they’d spent some time together when Rhodes first joined the Academy, it hadn’t been long before the Civil War business interrupted everything. They haven’t spent much time together socially since then, mostly just nodding at each other across the bar at Club A when both their groups of friends are there at the same time. It’s fine in combat situations, when they both have the task to focus on, and Steve can just call him War Machine. But he’s not wearing the armor at all now, not even the black gauntlet that matches Tony’s red one.
“There are awesome,” Tony breathes, running his fingers over the contents. The knives have a bright vermeil finish. They nestle into velvet-lined niches cut to fit each one exactly.
“Just carried it out here ‘cause of molasses, huh,” Stark says, barely looking as he reassembles the contraption's innards. “That a fact?”
“Tell me, Steve! Tell me what I can do!” He’s begging. He doesn’t care. “What can I do to make it stop?”
James and Natasha’s departure from the Forbidden Zone had led them into the frozen forests along the Ob River in Siberia. The trunks of the pine trees were dusted with snow like Christmas tea cakes rolled in confectioners sugar. The branches were caked with frozen snow and dangled icicles like the faceted festoons of a chandelier. It was beautiful.
“It’s weird, isn’t it? I’m sorry, I wasn’t trying to be pushy, I just, I know we haven’t been together that long—”
Time accelerates, like a bullet, then stops short just as abruptly. Steve’s dressed for court and the letter is in his hands, the creases in the paper showing the wear of how many times it's been folded and unfolded.
“Okay, that’s not what I thought at first. I’m happy to admit that.” Tony made a face. “I don’t think this spell is interfering with my ability to censor myself.”
"Yer wastin’ yer time,” Tony tells him as he slides a coin into Tony’s fortune-telling machine. “It’s busted."
. Except that one entire wall is clear—it looks like glass but it’s probably another one of those forcefields. On the other side is a larger room, about the size of the Avengers’ gymnasium, an assemblage of computers and metal arms in the center. The time machine, then.
“I—I’d like you to hold onto these for me,” Steve says. “And—know that I’m thinking about you. I know I’m—I know you don’t think about me the same way, but—”
Steve carries Tony to a suite of rooms in another part of the helicarrier. These are large and imposing, on a grander scale than where Steve brought him before, and richly decorated in Hydra green.
He’s shaking when they free his ankles. He stays quiet while they hold him down and the one with the dagger slices lines into his skin, but he jerks away when it nicks his nipple. The men laugh. When he bleeds through his shirt, they cut it off. Each break in his skin tugs at his attention like a pull from a fishhook lodged in his cheek, but the agony in his feet overwhelms his capacity for pain, and when he starts sobbing, the stinging in his feet are the reason.
Yeah I spent a lot of it flying sweeps over the Archives trying to figure out where y’all had gotten your asses to
The fella in white stands and turns to face him, not bothering to hide that he’s tossing the room. “Are you a friend of Mister Tillard's?”
“Well, you didn’t have to cancel Star Trek night in person,” Tony says, shifting from one foot to the other. “I know you know how to use a phone now, old man.”
Steve ducks his head. His jaw works. He always says what he sets out to say, no matter what it costs him. “No. I wish I hadn’t said that in front of everyone.”
“The mayor told you that Eva had a repair job for you on the edge of town,” Steve says, scraping the onions into a cast iron skillet. Hot oil hisses under them as he pushes them around with a wooden spoon.
Steve handed his helmet to Tony; his safety was Steve's responsibility and he'd never let anything happen to Tony, nope not in his watch.
"No, I'm fine. His hands are bleeding not mine." Tony gently moved his suit. It was drenched in blood.
"Obviously you're handsome and cute. I know you're small and skinny, but trust me when I say puberty is gonna hit you hard. You're gonna turn even more handsome and very manly with so much muscle. Girls are gonna go crazy for you, Steve. " Tony explained, he gave a slight pat on Steve's shoulder, as reassured him with a sweet smile.
"NAT! I can't believe you betrayed me!" Bucky growled. His face was beaming red, he was so embarrassed.
Bucky heard that loud and clear. He observed the guy, his forehead indeed was red, that must've hurt a lot. "I'm so-" But before Bucky could even apologize, Natasha abruptly cut him off.
that from the sound of Steve’s voice?). “But I know we weren’t here, that we were somewhere on the ground in Europe. It might have been Germany – probably was. We were looking for something.”
"Oh god," Steve said, hastily propping one arm against the bed as he buckled.  Tony laughed, low and intoxicated, in response.  "Tony, c'mon—"
“They’re frozen in ice.” Even as Tony said it, he couldn’t help but think Rhodey was right. The person couldn’t be dead. Not in circumstances as unusual as this.
. He cleared his throat, refocusing on Steve. “But you don’t want to spend all your time protecting me, do you? Don’t you have your team to find?”
He paused, and it took Steve a second to realize he was waiting for a reply.  Took even longer to muster the breath for it:  Steve was panting and close, iron around the cock stopper and flat against his own stomach, smearing precome against his own skin.  He pinched and then twisted one nipple savagely and used the pain of it to clear his head enough to answer.  “Yes.  I started with one, yes.  Just the...”
The pain was—it was pain.  Gwen had had worse, but it wasn’t fun, and she struggled to keep her eyes closed, her breathing steady.
They hadn’t gotten that much information from the locals. They didn’t speak English and the local dialect wasn’t one that Tony or Rhodey were familiar with. What they did manage to cribble together from pantomiming and showing pictures of the guy that had gone “crazy” in the mountains was vague and didn’t tell them what they were looking for.
Yet…Tony trusted that it didn’t matter. Besides, Steve pressed into the contact between their shoulders, arms wrapped around his knees. If he had any issues about this, he wouldn’t do that.
Tony didn’t move as the man brushed a thumb over his chin, feeling caught in the man’s blue eyes (were they azure?). “Can’t say we’ve met before,” he managed to reply flippantly. “I’m Tony Stark. This is Rhodey.”
Steve’s eyes flickered down to the repulsor plate protecting the glass covering Tony’s heart. He must have seen Tony’s heart if he’d been involved in recharging the apparatus, yet he didn’t look repulsed or horrified. He just seemed terribly sympathetic and rather sad. One hand dropped to cover the plate, the touch gentle.
The possessiveness, which had been banked in Stark’s eyes, flared hard.  So did that thin edge of cruelty.  Stark swallowed and nodded.  “Show up three hours early,” she ordered.  “I want to make sure the tailoring is correct.”
“Magic, man,” Rhodey said with a sigh, looking down at his half-eaten ration with a vaguely disgusted expression that somehow still suggested he was determined to finish it. “I don’t know why I’m surprised. At this point, anything that’ll fix your heart is going to be magic and not science.”
“You sure act like it,” Rhodey said, sounding perturbed. “And so does he. I just…we don’t know his history. We don’t know where he came from, how he ended up in that cave. His story doesn’t match up with what we know of the war. Can we trust him?”
The conversation shifted to more neutral lines, focusing on some of the (heavily edited) missions Steve had run and the adventures Tony had gotten into (also edited but only slightly; Steve was getting more of the truth than Tony’s readers did). None of Steve’s missions seemed remotely familiar to Tony or Rhodey, and it seemed incredibly unlikely that he would have been such a secret that neither of them would have heard of him.
When they eventually reached the exit, Steve climbed up like an actual monkey and didn’t even seem breathless for it. He also started shivering the moment he was out of the cave, the cold night air cutting through his uniform like a knife.
“Just the tip?  Oh, Steve.”  Tony gave himself a squeeze.  “If I told you to come for me, how long would it take?”
These were unforgiving peaks, covered with white snow, with a geography that wasn’t yet entirely charted. Villages dotted the foothills of the mountain range, but it wasn’t like the locals knew the ins and outs of the Himalayas either.
Tony didn’t say anything beyond humming slightly in acknowledgement. The back of his neck prickled uncomfortably, but there was nothing unusual here. Even if he did sometimes feel like there were eyes in the shadows.
“Yeeeeah,” Tony said, softer now.  His words were a fond caress.  “Yeah.  You’d look just like that.  You’re so beautiful, Steve, I wouldn’t be able to resist.  So I’d put my mouth on you again, but this time, I’d sink one finger in, first—do it—”
Gwen snorted.  “SHIELD doesn’t appear to have noticed this, but Iron Man isn’t actually all that bad.  I read the reports—did you know they gave me almost unlimited access to reports on you and him?  I think they were trying to prejudice me against you, but it had the opposite effect.  Iron Man—what is he, anyway?  A robot?”
“Unless an ambitious mountain goat decides to make off with them, I think it’ll be fine,” Rhodey told Tony once he made it up. “What’re we looking at?”
Tony’s breath fogged in the air as he took an unconscious step forward, his face prickling at the abrupt change of temperature.
… Yet Tony pressed two fingers to the pulse point in his neck and waited, scarcely daring to breathe.
being worked by an obvious expert like Tasha.  Tasha’s hands were in the mix, too, although Gwen was having trouble tracking them; it seemed like they would both be there, and then neither, and then one or the other, and in some dim corner of Gwen’s mind she thought that was strange, but when the person being strange was doing
Tasha surged back against Gwen, running a hand down her back, curving it around her rear and pulling in until Gwen groaned into her mouth.  “Yes,” Gwen bit out.  She nuzzled her way up Tasha’s neck to her ear, running the tip of her tongue around the shell and making Tasha shudder.
Tony remembered the feel of Steve’s hand on his face, the way he had stroked at Tony’s chin with his thumb. A far more intimate gesture than most of his bed partners had ever given him.
Miss Stark was tall for a woman but shorter than Gwen.  (Most people were shorter than Gwen.)  She wore her dark hair short and combed away from her face, although one thick lock was trying to straggle into her eyes. Her makeup was both minimal and expert. Her suit—three-piece with boot-cut trousers, charcoal colored and pin-striped with lilac, with a mauve blouse, matching waistcoat, and tie beneath—was cut on long and lean lines, a masculine sort of style even compared to what Gwen had seen of modern dress.  She wore it shockingly well; she gave the impression, instant and strong, that this form was the only possible form she could ever have, the only version of herself to exist in the entire multiverse.  Gwen knew for a fact that this was a lie—she had seen pictures in her briefing packets—and she
“Yeah?” Steve shifts minutely closer, barely a step forward. He doesn’t touch Tony, doesn’t quite crowd him, but it’s still too intimate. It’s not the way you stand across from someone you can’t trust. It’s not the way you face someone who’s wronged you. “Because, I was. Thinking of us.” Abruptly, he adds, “You don’t remember.”
Steve laughs, the vapor of his breath highlighted by the gold beam of a streetlamp. “Remember the first time we met?”
Tony’s eyes dart away—Steve’s caught him staring across the table. Tony swallows and tries to focus his attention on Sam. Sam, who is Captain America now, and team leader, and will notice if Tony's not paying attention to the team meeting.
—“I paid attention to what you said, and what you did, and it reminded me all of the reasons to put my faith in you,” Steve says. “You proved yourself a hundred times over.”
Steve learns several things in quick succession. One: that Tony, Reed, Xavier, Namor, Black Bolt, and Strange have been meeting in secret for years. Two: that there’s a dead Skrull in the room with them, and before it died, its presence was undetectable to Wolverine’s mutant power, Strange’s magic, and Spider-Man’s senses. Even now, Reed’s tech can’t recognize it as a Skrull.
Carol says, “I can’t. I can’t talk about him. Not yet. I know you cared about him, but you weren’t there. You didn’t see him. You hurt him, and I can’t forgive you yet.”
Natasha thought of claiming that she’d known since the second day and was waiting for Steve and Tony to catch on themselves, but decided she couldn’t pull off a lie like that.
“How was the job with the sheriff?” Steve asks when Tony, fresh from the shower, joins him in the kitchen.
but he can't bring himself to make Steve say it. It should be self-evident that Steve wanted him back. Steve's here, Steve's the only one here, and Tony doesn't want to dwell too much on why there's no one else, but he's getting the idea that Steve oversaw whatever it was that woke Tony up.
“Yeah, way to respect boundaries,” Parker teases. Her tone shifts abruptly as she says, “Great. Good talk, next check-in is on the schedule. Bye.”
They play a game involving translucent puzzle-piece chunks of holographic architecture—flying buttresses, mansard roofs, crenellated towers, drawbridges, gabled dormers, air bridges, spires, pinnacles—and stacking them into the tallest, most structurally sound tower of the two before the pieces run out. Steve assumes that Tony will have a huge advantage in this, except it’s not just about engineering. There’s strategy, too: a whole ecosystem of plants, animals, flying construction robots, mining, and manufacturing, all affected by the weather and the size of the tower and what it’s made out of and where plants grow and how animals nest and how well the robots are treated. It’s beautiful and wild and addictive.
“They haven’t said,” Urich replies with a shrug. “So long as they keep sending money, I can’t say it troubles me overmuch.”
And Tony is smiling like he’s being shown the secrets to eternal bliss. And maybe he is, Steve thinks. Lieutenant Gonzales will mention some amazing breakthrough that happened in the 23rd century, or explain how the windows are really forcefields, or let Tony look at the circuitry for the artificial gravity array, and Tony will grin and grin, sometimes even laugh out loud with delight, and then—as if just noticing that Steve is in the room—glance back at him as if to say,
Steve—who was standing closer to Tony than was strictly necessary given the size of the lounge where the party was being held and the number of people attending it—shrugged. “Tony, I didn’t know what your costume was going to be.”
“Oh,” Tony says dumbly. “And here I thought you were here to kick me off the team,” he says, not quite exaggerating. The way Steve’s talking about it, around it, well, it’s hard not to imagine—
“You know, he just doesn’t want you to think poorly of him,” Rhodes says, straightening and starting to turn to head back inside. “Or to scratch him from combat,” he adds, as an afterthought.
Right. Of course. Why else would Tony be here. “Can’t you do that from the Tower? I already gave a ton of blood samples at the infirmary.”
Tony sits up and opens his eyes. His skin looks lit from within. He smirks, nastily, his eyes narrowed. “Now I do. And it looks like I was right. Cheer up, you’re young and strong again.”
The injury to his feet is painful and vast. The hurt of it doesn’t so much swallow him whole as slurp him down its gullet. It’s part of him now, and while it grows more excruciating each time he wobbles and stumbles on the balls of his feet, trying to keep the weight off his arms, it doesn’t ebb and flow like the pain in his side. The welts and bruises on his back and thighs sit on him like insects with needles for legs, but they’re a kind of hurt so familiar they become inconsequential.
Tony looks chagrined rubs at the back of his neck and looks over at the wall. “Close enough,” he says at last.
Steve doesn't point out that Stark's not wearing one. “We’ll figure out who really done it, Stark. Just a matter of time.”
“I can’t,” Steve says, sounding more miserable and terrified than Tony’s ever seen him. “Not again, don’t—”
The shuttlebay is huge and impressive and dazzling, and yesterday Steve might have taken the time to be awed or overwhelmed, but now he just thinks how this is the last time he’ll see Tony. Ever.
None of this is meant to imply that the Avengers didn’t spend time together, which would have meant few opportunities to observe the change in their teammates and a plausible excuse for failing to notice it. In fact, in addition to team meetings, there were weekly team movie nights, frequent impromptu hang-outs in common areas of the compound, sub-meetings regarding the team’s PR and news appearances, meetings with government liaisons, and regular training regimens in flight, hand-to-hand combat, agility, and marksmanship.
Tony shakes himself, smiling ruefully. “Making it all about me again. Not really what I meant to do.”
When he’d first gotten out of the ice, SHIELD/Hydra gave him a computer loaded up with e-books and videos about things he needed, according to them, be up-to-date on. Since learning about the infiltration, Steve’s spent a lot of time thinking about who chose the contents and why. How much was intended to be misinformation or misdirection? How much was well-intentioned, or even just an effort to ensure he didn’t embarrass them?
“C’mon Steve,” Tony says, wriggling under Steve’s weight, answering Steve’s smirk with one of his own. “What’re you waiting for?”
Steve’s kiss is no surprise this time, and no less delicious for it. He takes both their cocks in hand and tugs them to completion, his mouth still on Tony’s when they come. Steve’s still hard after that, and begs Tony to take him in his mouth again. He comes twice more like that, clutching Tony’s biceps nearly hard enough to bruise, whispering about all the things he’s imagined them doing.
“This is actually a great strategy though, good plan. Getting someone to do you a favor makes them more inclined to like you.”
Steve thinks about the year they’ve had. Losing Wanda, Clint, Jack, Scott. The destruction of the mansion. The mutants nearly destroyed. Atlantis evacuated. Nick Fury in hiding.
“Me too,” Steve says, whispering so as not to shatter this fragile moment. “I feel the same way,” he says, then realizes this isn’t entirely true. Steve feels that, and plenty more he’ll never have the chance to tell Tony.
Steve falls asleep reading reports in his small room, tucked into a remote corner of the helicarrier. He wakes up, his eyes burning with tears, an ugly, gnarled grief strangling him from the inside. There have to be hidden security cameras and bugs all over, placed there by Maria, Fury, and any number of government agencies from any number of countries—but there’s no hiding this. So he cries. He curls in on himself and sobs until he falls asleep.
Steve’s showered and shaved and changed into sweatpants and a t-shirt the computer provided via NMAT. He’s lying on a wide bed in what feels like a big, curved hotel room, swiping through a holographic screen in hopes of finding something compelling enough to distract him from his thoughts. Just when he’s about to give it up as a lost cause and simply lie in bed and brood, there’s a knock on his door.
Don’t worry, Jan. I’ve seen Young Frankenstein. I think Tony and I can handle a creepy German lady and ominous violin playing.
Tony’s eyelashes flutter as the world reorients and he comes back to himself. He stretches, relishing the movement. His wounds are gone, his breath comes easier, his mind moves faster. Steve is watching him.
He gets back to his feet and nods toward Steve and Tony. "Farewell. I haven't forgotten Stark's betrayal. I am interested to see how he might make it up to me."
The floor of the bowling alley is a black and white checkerboard. Tony watches the people in line to rent shoes or waiting for their turn to play and assigns them all to chess pieces. He thinks of the white reflector lines separating lanes on a highway, the way they flash by in his peripheral vision on long drives, caught in a road trance, black, white, off, on, one, zero.
He snatches it off the bed and slides it down the flat of his tongue until it hits the back of his mouth. He closes his eyes and groans around the dildo. Swallows around it. Around a piece of Tony.
The word of a handful of detained Hydra and AIM members isn’t sufficient evidence to arrest the CEO of a megacorporation like Kronas, but their testimonies also include the location of the base where Red Skull, Zola, and Faustus have been working.
Steve may be a member of the Illuminati now, but that doesn’t mean he’s forgotten everything that’s happened: that Tony kept that secret from him in the first place; that he promised Tony he’d be held accountable for his sins; that Tony wielded the Infinity Gauntlet; that Tony claimed to have destroyed the Gems, only to keep them secret again.
Steve hadn’t had his hopes up, exactly—it hadn’t sounded like a date, he was pretty sure he’d know it if Tony Stark asked him out on a date, he’d heard him ask Natasha and Pepper and Eric and Claire and Peter Quill and once even Jan on dates, and, well,
He’s gotten Tony’s face all muddy, though tracks of tears have washed it off in crooked lines, like the lines of riverbeds on a map. “Been wantin’ to do that.”
Tony keeps surprising him. It’s not the apology Steve might’ve wished for ten minutes ago, but he means it. “Stop. Damnit Tony, just stop.”
sorry sorry i’m here now i just spilled coffee on my phone and then i had to change my clothes and then i went to get a new coffee but they ran out of everything except decaf
“No,” Steve says. “Don’t.” He tries to roll to one side and knock Tony off him—but of course he doesn’t have the strength.
“Nah, hold up a sec—how’d you even hear that comment?” Hardison says. “You been on our comm lines, Stark?”
Tony’s on his feet now, eye level with Steve. For a moment, Tony looks blank, thoughtful, almost bored. Then he laughs, a bright, uncanny sound. Steve’s not sure the last time he heard Tony laugh so fully and loosely, free of bitterness. “That’s what you came here for.”
Too late. The door to his room crashes open, the outside doorknob and lock melted and mangled. Tony stands there, looking frustrated and determined and beautiful, his hair flattened on one side, his lips bitten dark and swollen.
Tony manages an entire luncheon with Missus Danvers without mentioning the Book of Sins, though it remains a presence in his mind as sure as it’s tucked into his waistcoat. It’s lodged there, in his thoughts, like a splinter of iron burrowed too deep in the skin to extract.
The time before that, though—the image is seared into Steve’s memory. Tony’s armor, sparking and scratched, disabled on Steve’s orders. Steve told Tony that he’d lost when he sold his principles, but it was Steve who lost when he’d cracked open Tony’s faceplate with his shield.
This puzzles the gatekeeper to the point that he twists his waist like he’s wringing dry a wet rag, his head rolling so far to one wasted shoulder it should mean a broken neck. A single human eye surfaces onto the smooth expanse of his head like oil floating to the top of a bowl of batter. The eye is pointed at Tony, perhaps looking for clues or signs of deception on his person.
And then Tony’s arms are around his neck, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder and Steve wraps his arms around Tony before he’s fully processed the situation. Tony’s in his arms. They’ve slept side by side, in this bed, and now they’re holding each other. Steve’s had dreams like this.
“Generally acknowledged” is a phrase which here means “believed to be true by people who have never been, and never will be, Avengers.”
After he changes into his uniform and downing breakfast from the NMAT, the computer directs Steve toward the shuttlebay and informs him that Tony’s gotten permission to fly the shuttle himself, having mastered it through the simulation games they’d played the night before. Of course he has. God, Steve’s going to miss him so much.
He has the run of the place, from the grand ballroom with the stone-carved fountains to the stables where Apple is happily being kept, but there's little to do but sit and tinker and fuss in his rooms. His host is somewhere about as well, and they sit together for suppers at a table long enough for Jesus and all his disciples to sit along one side and still have plenty of room for their elbows. The few times Tony steps outside, it's to visit Apple. They share bites of her namesake and he brushes her down like a show horse.
People screamed when Steve stepped onstage. He filled Radio City Music Hall, the Hammerstein Ballroom, the Metropolitan Opera House. Hell, he filled Madison Square Garden. The crowds pulsed like a fresh injury. Moved in an eerie unity, like a vast school of fish.
“And I know it sounds crazy,” Steve goes on, his voice firm, “but when I try to remember, it’s always stuff from a World War II movie—”
Tony accepts the change of subject with a beautiful grin. His face is still so close to Steve’s, close enough to see the short bristles of stubble that have grown over the day and long night. “Aren’t they? C’mon, have another one.”
Jan overhears T’Challa talking about biochemistry, and excuses herself to join in, leaving Steve alone on the couch with Tony.
I mean assuming they don’t interfere with the nature of causality because then the concepts of before and after will become moot and the multiverse could unravel
“You made it!” Tony had beamed. He’d taken off his jacket, so he was just in a black tee and dark, snug jeans. His hair was mussed, his feet bare, and the arc reactor blazed bright under the thin fabric of his shirt.
—Steve stands in Tony’s workshop, now, in the present, still speaking, but what is time to Infinity—surely nothing that follows one moment after the last, first in/first out—
“I love you,” Steve says. He hasn’t said it yet. He hopes he’s saying it right, hopes he doesn’t sound like this is something he hates about himself.
Tony lets go first. He turns away and gets to his feet, his face flushed. It’s adorable, and Steve doesn’t think he’s ever seen Tony embarrassed before. “I’m gonna go get dressed. I guess I’ll see you in the shuttlebay in a bit?” It’s a question, but Tony walks to the door without waiting for an answer.
Steve kisses Tony’s forehead. He kisses the edges of his eyelids, the tear track down his face, the corners of his lips. “Let’s get out of here.”
Steve visits Tony at the garage. Tony recognizes his booted footsteps and the smell of Chinese takeout and emerges from under the car he’s working on, wiping his hands on a rag.
When at last Tony’s body is singular again, he eases the gag out of Steve’s mouth and rubs his back while he gasps and cries. Once Steve catches his breath, Tony replaces the gag and fucks him again. Tony still hasn’t undressed completely, his wrinkled clothes hiding the lithe lines of his body, and with each thrust the zipper of his fly rasps against Steve’s skin. If his attention is elsewhere, if he’s operating armor or meeting shareholders or designing bombs in his brain, he gives no sign of it. He fills Steve up and lets him imagine that he has Tony to himself.
The first night after Steve was arrested, he raged. It was easy to scream at Tony’s impassive faceplate. Tony sold his principles. Tony made this war. Tony would do anything to grab power.
It’s his job to announce and introduce them. He refused and was informed that this duty was not optional.
Before Tony can reply, a man with an overloaded shopping cart plows by, jostling Steve’s shoulder as he does. Steve drops the shopping basket, grabs the man by the shoulders and shoves him against the glass door of the dairy section.
“Everything’s just like it’s supposed to be. If you see any children around town without their guardians, though, give the sheriff a call, would you?”
At the funeral Tony was a body, silent and absent. Now he’s right here, letting Steve speak on his behalf, and Steve’s voice splinters when he reads, “‘And you, Steve. Whether you believe it or not, I always trusted you. Even during the darkest days—during the war—I  never stopped believing in you.’”
“I like observing milestones,” Steve says. “It’s the town’s bicentennial coming up soon, too, right?”
Tony’s starting to regret his choice of song, but there’s no gentleman’s guide for how to act once you’ve told your friend and local law enforcement you’re a sodomite. Before he can get to
Tony’s inside the suit and nearly has all the parts locked in when the distant commotion becomes much closer.
It’s been years since Steve’s looked so happy. He’s so willing to be misled. How pathetic. Tony’s smile widens.
It’s huge. There are windows that are two storeys high, looking out on stars dotting a black sky like captured fireflies. It’s beautiful, too, the breadth of it wrought in sweeping Art Nouveau curves. Even the hum of the ship’s engines is pleasant, a low thrum like the lapping of ocean waves. Panels, sconces, moldings, and what Steve first takes for framed paintings and photographs turn out to be fixtures, screens, and projectors for computer interfaces, appliances, and holograms. It’s overwhelming in its scale, intimidating in its beauty,  and uncanny in its almost-familiarity.
“There you go,” Tony says, his hands gripping Steve’s hips with bruising strength. He punctuates each word with a thrust that rocks the bed.
The gatekeeper makes a wet, back-of-the-throat sort of growl. “I’ve heard of sumthin’, growin’ in its nook, swellin’ and risin’, pushin’ up its covering. Upon that boneless thing a cocky-minded young maid took a grip with her hands, an’ with her apron a lord’s daughter covered the tumescent thing.”
Missions and cases and meetings tangle together. Steve’s recall is perfect, but right now, he can keep track of the days only if he concentrates, if he grasps and presses until they’re in reach.
He’s right. Tony’s bombarded with so many sensations—the hurt all over his body, varied in intensity and form, the chill air against his bare skin, the sound of Steve’s heavy breath and furtive thrusts into his own fist—that the hot tears escaping his eyes barely register.
Deals 1480 damage, plus 105 for each Team Cap Escalation tile, 120 per tile if target is Team Iron Man, or 135 per tile if target is Iron Man.
Tony crossed his arms. “So it’s just when you’re talking to me? I would’ve pegged you as the type to make my parents’ murder all about yourself.” He frowned. “I mean, I would’ve pegged you as the type to make it all about yourself.”
“I can,” Steve says, fervently. He knows, with great clarity, what Tony’s done. But Tony is brilliant, bright like a star, and the brightest lights cast the longest shadows. Steve’s been living under the one in his own mind since Tony’s death. Now that he’s back in the sun, he needs Tony there with him. “Please. Tony. I knew what I was saying.”
Steve and Tony, the only others left in the room, were bickering about the film, and didn’t notice James and Natasha’s conversation in the slightest. Tony, who secretly loved the earnestness and drama of musicals, claimed to hate it. Steve, who was secretly bored by the songs, underwhelmed by the set, and taking only the occasional interest when there was a particularly good dance routine, claimed that Tony was just being negative because it didn’t have any robots or explosions in it.
Tony takes Steve’s nipple between his teeth and bites. He grabs Steve’s wrist and sets his hand down so it’s cupping Tony’s cock. Obediently, Steve starts to stroke Tony’s length with the pads of his fingers; he knows what Tony likes, now.
Nat’s face twists sourly. “I’m not sure,” she admits. “But I think it’s something to do with his arc reactor.”
Steve bundles Tony closer to his chest. The movement jostles Tony’s limbs, making him whimper as his shoulder protests. “Shh,” Steve says. He presses a delicate kiss to Tony’s forehead. “I’ve got you, Tony. They’re not going to hurt you any more.”
Steve hasn’t seen Reed since his trial. He doesn’t know the last time he saw Black Bolt.  And there’s a body bag on the floor in front of them. “What is this?” Steve says.
“I barely got a turn with him,” another voice says. It might be the man with bare hands; Tony’s eyes are too heavy to open.
In the morning, Tony pulls the gag down and tips a glass of water into Steve’s mouth. It’s hard to drink without controlling the cup himself, and half of the contents sloshes down his face. The smile Tony gives him makes him shiver.
There’s mud in Steve’s lungs. There’s mud in his nose and ears and soaked into his clothes and all over his skin. He’s crouched over, mud underneath him, knees sinking further with each mud-filled breath. He coughs, and what comes out is mud, too.
“Yeah, of course,” Steve says, slinging the bag over his shoulder. “But you’re not wearing your armor, so.” He shrugs.
Steve does touch him, but not in the way he expects. He gets an arm under Tony’s knees and scoops him into his arms. It hurts, of course it does, because Tony’s back and thighs are still covered in welts, and the moment Steve takes the weight off Tony’s arms, every nerve ending in his body erupts in pain. All Tony can do is curl in on himself and bite back a scream. A wrenched, cut-off moan escapes him instead.
He’ll let Steve think he has the upper hand for now. That Tony’s weak and human and ready to be led. There’s certainly no need to mention Extremis. Steve’s shown his hand: he wants Tony on his side. Tony can play at that, for now.
“I didn’t give any money to the GoFundMe for her wife’s cancer treatment.” Tony turned his tablet off and closed his eyes. “We don’t pay our staff very well, but healthcare is reasonably priced. It was a small donation. I put it under my name. She’s probably as far away from her wife as possible. They didn’t make their fundraising goal.”
They pass a sleeping three-headed dog, which Tony tells him is the last landmark before they’re due to climb back up to the silver mines. They wind the rest of their way up, until there’s sunlight spilling out around the next bend.
Steve’s mouth is dry. He’s never let that sort of thing stop him from yelling, though. “Tony,” he says, furious and desperate. “What is this?”
Steve’s back on the Raft now, hunched over, numb, exhausted. And he misses not so much the certainty of his anger and pride but the intensity and confidence of it. Emotions are distant. They don’t sit properly in his mind or his heart. They manifest instead in his body, in his eye sockets, under his ribs, in frost forming over his skin.
“What?” Steve surveyed the faces of his teammates, as if expecting one of them to know what Tony was referring to.
“I understand there’s a book you’re interested in, and it so happens that I know where you can find it.”
The little girl is there, the night sky dark around her, her pale pigtails the same color as the snow. She’s holding something in her hands, a toy—a snowglobe—and something inside it glitters, tiny golden dots of light like lit windows, sparks of neon curling and refracting along the surface of the glass—
and the orangutan could only say “ook ook” and seemed to be really frustrated we didn’t know what he was saying
“Fun,” Tony repeats, quirking an eyebrow. It’s the one with the dandelion plume stuck in it and Steve wants to lean over and make it fly off with his own breath and his own wish.
Each piercing strike radiates through his entire body. A man with a heavy dagger crouches behind him, holding him up by the shoulders. The hilt digs into Tony’s flesh, the blade large in Tony’s vision. The hits don’t falter, but neither do they fall into a rhythm, never giving him time to brace himself, striking again when his body starts to sag.
“Honey bees makin’ a hive in the carcass of a lion,” Tony replies after a moment. At the gatekeeper’s nod, he goes on, “What type of bird would be reckoned to lift the heaviest weight?”
It’s several minutes more before Tony stirs. His eyes dart around the room, skittering over Steve’s face and where his hand rests in Steve’s own.
“Nonstop punning,” Parker crows. “Hammer and nail: ViaStone & Hammertech CEOs reveal conspiracy to commit homicide, fraud, & more.’ ‘Hammered ViaStone CEO incriminates self, Hammer, in rant promising to “nail ‘em all.’’”
The men have been gone for hours, though Tony can’t be sure how many; his vision will swim, then go dark, hurting too much to stay conscious, only for the pain to wake him again an indeterminate amount of time later. But he doesn’t think it could be much more than five or six. Usually what wakes him is the pulsing ache in the side with the dislocated shoulder, throbbing with every breath.
No it's true, he wasn't exaggerating at all. His heart was killing him slowly, it hurt so fucking much.
He hated the darkness, he hated being alone. He tried screaming, but his mouth was completely sealed shut.
"Is that so." Steve replied with a chuckle. Oh well, that was pretty much expected. Steve main focus was to have a conversation with Tony that his comfortable with.
They both suddenly burst into laughter. "Stark, your ship name sounds delicious, you know." Bucky stated while laughing his ass off.
He wanted to escape from the castle for a while. No one knew how the prince of Americ Kingdom looked in person, there seemed be a secret behind that; even Steve wasn't aware of it. They'd only seen him when he was a child. Steve headed out to the city with his red Ferrari, without having to worry about his identity.
Steve felt euphoric, it was the first someone had asked him about his wellbeing, other then his mom.
As he entered the mansion, he saw his father sitting down on a couch, while reading a newspaper. Steve walked toward his father and stood in front of him.
Ever since Steve was a child, he was never good at understanding feelings or emotions. He watched his close friends get girlfriends and fall in love. Steve envied them, envied that they're able to feel and be loved.
"J.A.R.V.I.S- urg! Fuck." He growled, trying his best to get up. Tony had realized that he hadn't programmed J.A.R.V.I.S in this house.
"Thanks for the offer, Steve. But I really can't. I'm an outsider, I don't belong here. This palace is only meant for the royal family. I'd rather stay in my mansion. "
Steve had finally seen the man that he wanted to see for the past five years. Now, he knew who the man truly was. Steve was on cloud nine, he knew the man's name.
I hope we don't ever cross path with each other again. After all, you were just a one-night stand and nothing more or less, isn't that right Steve Rogers? Or should I say Captain America, well that was what everyone thought you were, even me.
Steve was left dumbfounded. He screwed big times, it was so obvious that Tony didn't want anyone to hear his conversation.
Somehow, that name triggered a panic attack. The sudden drowsiness nearly caused Steve to lose balance. Luckily he was already leaning against the car for support.
It had been a month, since Steve had last seen Tony. It felt like a year, who knew time would be this slow. Every seconds constantly reminded Steve about Tony. It was simply torture. He wanted to see Tony so badly.
At that moment, the help had arrived with a small boat. They carefully pulled Bucky up into the boat and laid him there. "Mr Stark, are you okay?" One of the crew member asked, while pulling him up. Great! just great! This guy had to ask such a fucked up question in a situation like this.
His sharp jawline was in contrast with flawless skin. He's expression remained cold as ice, it was as if his features were molded from granite.
Soon, he couldn't bear the pain. His eyes began to close. That was it, he was going to die. Steve was daunted at the thought of that.
One day Steve was walking home from late at work. His body was body exhausted, all he wanted to do was go home and sleep. He walked with his face was down, looking at the ground instead of looking where he was going.
Tony's lips trembled and his shoulders heaved with emotions, unwilling to back down. His dark lashes brimmed heavy with tears; his hands clenched into shaking fists, in a desperate battle against the grief.
He'd missed Tony so much. If only Tony had missed him as much as he did. Steve hated to admit, but he was afraid that Tony won't even remember his name. Not that he blames Tony or anything.
"W-what! I most certainly don't" Tony said, he raised his voice. It was almost as if he was offended by the comment or maybe it was because they were dead right about that.
The guard had found Steve lying unconscious on the rooftop floor, he carried Steve back to his chamber and placed him on his bed.
Steve gripped his shoulders. His hands were shaking. "Tony, tell me you're joking?" It had to be, Tony must've be playing a prank on him.
"Stevie, listen to me. Falling in love is the most beautiful thing you can experience in life. But don't think just cause it's one sided love, you won't have a chance. You've found your special someone, don't let them go that easily."
Steve was a called a freak and a monster. Those names had left a deep scar in him, soon Steve began to stop going to school.
"May I have this dance?" Steve held out his legt hand. He knew that much, this was the least Steve had been taught.
"Hey Kid, I've got you. It's going to be alright." Tony reassured Steve. He felt safe, he was alive.
"Anyway, dad. See you later." Peter kissed Steve on the cheek and exited the room, leaving Steve alone.
He wiped the blood off his hand. "I'm sorry but this is gonna sting a little, actually No. The wound is very deep, so it's gonna hurt a lot" Tony gave him a warning.
Rhodey put the coffee and doughnuts on an empty table. Tony immediately ran toward him and hugged him tight. "My hero! What would I do without you!"
Bucky approached near Steve. "Shit, no way. Stark actually did that. If I knew Stark would've done this, I would happily have got injured too." Bucky pouted.
Why was it that everytime he met Tony Stark, Steve was the one having a panic attack and Tony was the one saving him?
"Have you met Mr Stark, dad? You normally paint based on what you see with your eyes in real life." Peter pointed out.
"Awwww, Steve. That's bare cute. It's hard to find people like you, now a days. I hope you find that special someone, Steve." Tony encouraged him and wished him the best of luck.
Bucky burst into laughter. No one even dared to call Nick Fury by his first name and Tony Stark, even gave him a nickname.
Rhodey was always there for Tony since day one, Tony was lucky to have these special people in his life. The truth was that Tony could never cope without them, he needed them as much they needed him. But Tony doesn't believe that, he always thought he doesn't deserve such loyal friends like them, especially for someone who was so broken. No! He refused to believe that, he could never, he was just too selfish, arrogant, egoistic, cold-hearted person. A person like him could never have people like them in his life and yet somehow, he does.
"How about we get started, you can fuck me all night long, but I have one condition. The bathrobe stays on during the whole time."
Is this how lust felt? Until now he had never once touched anyone sexually. He had waited for years, thinking someone was also there waiting for him, so he wanted to cherish and be fully devoted them only.
"Oh My God! You are. My best friend fell in love with Tony Stark." Bucky covered his mouth in shock. "Why didn't you tell me before?"
He heard a familiar voice, Steve knew that voice, that was the voice that kept him awake at night. The voice he wanted to hear for years. No doubt, that it was him. Steve tilted his head up. The moment he'd laid eyes on the man in front, he felt breathless. Tony Stark was there right in front if him.
Steve had a mixture of feelings. He felt ecstatic, yet despondent. Deep down inside, Steve knew Tony would never love him, he could never be his. The thought of that killed him.
"I-I'm fine, Bucky." No, Steve was not fine at all. He couldn't even describe how he was feeling. All he knew was that he hated this feeling.
"No, you're safety comes first, Stark." Steve argued back, while putting the helmet on Tony's head, ensuring that he wore it perfectly.
"Well, how about next time you pick up your phone." Rhodey had deadpan expression, his voice drips sarcasm.
"Steve, are you telling me, Tony Fucking Stark breathed for you. As in actually mouth to mouth?" Bucky asked as stood up and walked near Steve.
Steve blushed at the thought of Tony being his boyfriend. For some reason, he hadn't felt disgusted. Instead, he felt a sense of happiness because he didn’t mind being in a relationship with Tony.
The doctor was right, his son was too precious. He would anything to keep his safe. King Joseph sat beside Steve and held his hand.
"You think I'm hot?" Steve asked, he literally had no idea on how to respond to Tony without freaking out.
Steve felt euphoric knowing that the man actually cared about him. "I'm okay, thank you for helping me."
Why was this man different from all the others? Why did he care about Steve? Even though he barely had known Steve for an hour.
As far as Tony could tell, the person he just slept with was indeed his enemy. But, he only slept with Steve because he owed him and he had to pay back, even if it had meant he had to use his body, he'd do it.
There was not even a single day, where Steve could forget about that day. It was that day, when he felt so much alive, maybe that because he was at the edge of dying. Tony saved him, yet again.
Fuck it, he couldn't stop himself anymore. He was way passed the line, all Steve knew that he needed to have the man, now or never.
Tony got out of the car with a gift on his hands. He handed it to Steve. "Here is your birthday, gift. Open it now, so I could your reaction."
Sarah stroked his hair, gently. "Good morning, sweetheart. I'm so happy you’re okay, I'm so sorry, I should've known you were sick." Sarah said softly, she leaned and kissed his cheek.
Even though, it killed him when she broke up with him. But, now he finally understood that Pepper's decision were indeed the best for them.
Bucky's heart was beating fast; this was a sign that he was indeed alive. Bucky felt euphoric, but he didn't know why? Was it because of what Tony had said or was it 'cause he was still alive?
"Well, what I can say. It's my second love after all." Steve admitted, he loves riding his motorcycle.
The door clicked open, he heard the footsteps getting closer. Steve slowly tilted his head forward. He saw a figure harshly opening the fridge door and then slamming it closed. The man walked out of the kitchen into the living room.
Bucky sighed. "See, you're spacing out again and you're smiling so much that it's scaring me" Bucky gave him a playful smirk.
In response, Steve nibbled the man's ear and whispered. "I'll make you scream my name and you'll be begging me not to stop."
Luck was on his side today, now all he needed to do was getting out of here without being caught. Steve was too busy in his thoughts, already planning of ways to escape from here.
Every day he would pray for Steve to remember Tony, so they could reunite. Only then he would be able to see his son truly happy once again.
Tony noticed how Pepper and Rhodey were in a deep conversation. He walked there and sat on the couch. "So, what are you love birds talking about?" Tony asked.
Tony knew the man wasn't aware of who he truly was. So there was no point in telling him his stage name. It would just ruin the mood.
Ever since that night, Steve had locked himself in his room. He didn't want to see anyone, he needed time alone with just himself. There no way in hell he could get over his break with Tony. He loved Tony far too much. He couldn't bare the thought of losing Tony. Everyone one knew Tony Stark was solely his weakness.
Steve got up and refreshed himself. As he was eating breakfast, he noticed a card, with some beautiful banquet of flowers and something else in the bag.
It'd been two days since, Tony locked himself in the lab. That was the only way he could distract himself from these emotions and feelings.
Steve brought his lips closer to the man's ear and slowly whispered. "Even so, I doubt you'll do me any harm , Boo. I could take you down in a heartbeat." Steve's hands were glued to his waist, not wanting to let go of the man. Well, not just yet. After all, his night had gotten hell of a lot more interesting and he couldn't just let that come to an end, now could he?
and because of the magical and tech protections on campus and the archives in particular, it made the whole building kinda lock out of the reality that the rest of campus is in
Steve tries to notice when Tony slips him something or injects him. Instead, he wakes up naked on his bedroom floor, just like the month before and the one before that, this time with something shoved in his ass. There’s come in his hair and on his chest and thighs. The place Tony bit has healed, but the specks of blood are still there. He rises to his feet, finds the flared end of the plug sticking out of him, and pulls it out all at once. What lube there’d been is long since dried, and the toy drags roughly across his passage.
Rhodey didn’t look any happier, and Jarvis looked the least happy of all of them, eyeing Tony’s chest worriedly. Considering Jarvis, this meant he was scowling heavily while double-checking their supplies.
Rhodey whistled lowly under his breath, then proceeded to shift his weight from foot to foot, keeping his flashlight trained on the man Tony was crouched by.
“So,” Tony said once Steve was almost finished scarfing his food down. It was impressive, if not a little terrifying. Steve had eaten more than he and Rhodey combined within the last two days and Tony would really like to know where he put it. “I’ve got a question for you.”
Okay, well, one could say that about all mountain ranges (and the Earth in general if one were to get technical), but these were different. There was something mystical about them, a kind of gravitas and presence that other mountain ranges didn’t seem to possess.
It didn’t take long; Gwen was just starting to think that maybe she should get a hand involved instead of using them both to hold Tasha in place when Tasha bucked against her mouth, screaming at the ceiling and thrashing.  A gush of clear, sea-tasting fluid came out of her, soaking Gwen’s throat, her dress, and her still-exposed breasts.
Gwen wanted to think her voice came out breathy with desire, but when Tasha’s face hardened she knew she had blown it.  “Nothing you need to worry about,” Tasha said harshly.  She pushed lightly at Gwen, getting just a little room, then turned them both around like dancers so that Gwen was standing in the doorway, Tasha on the outside of her.
Steve closed his eyes and shortened his strokes, digging in with his left hand for purchase and for the feeling of powerlessness it gave him.  He shifted his weight to the side just to feel the plug in his ass press into him again, and that did it:  he felt the pressure shift from his balls to his cock, mounting up behind the plug before slowly dropping in long, slow, waves, as his come oozed out around the plug.
Much of the rest of the day was spent doing actual work:  finishing up the paperwork from "Paste-Pot Pete" took most of the morning, and drills with the Avengers were an afternoon well-spent.  Steve had taken a QuinJet from the Tower out to the compound at noon; by seven, he was back, and had to hustle to the shower.  Tony would be home soon.
It felt a little more exceptional when he got the whole finger in; it wasn’t quite a stretch, but it
Steve tries to return his attention to his notes for the essay he has to write for their class on 20th Century Germany and the Unification of Europe, but his eyes keeps finding their way back to Tony.
Steve wonders if Brickenn really thought he’d see Earth again. He’d spent years living with the reality of its absence, visiting it only in his mind—long enough to inextricably entwine memory with imagination.
we got to the next floor and it seemed normal. there were bookshelves and windows and signs pointing to the stairs and the library reception desk and it said we were in biographies
“Don't rightly know,” Steve replies, rage simmering in the back of his mind and near fit to boiling over. “But we'll find out.”
He squeezes his eyes shut, biting his lip to keep his mouth shut. He tries to focus on breathing, on every point of his body that screams out in pain, but all it does is force his breath out in harsh pants. Steve finds a bead of dried blood on Tony’s back. His finger follows it up to the still-raw stripe it bled from, and this time it’s his blunt fingernail that drags languidly across the mark. Tony groans before he can stop himself. He can’t shake the feeling that he’s giving Steve exactly what he wants.
“I’m sorry I let my personal feelings take over. I don’t like being kept in the dark.” Steve looks at Tony from under his eyelashes, a small smile unfurling from his features like a butterfly emerging still damp and delicate, fresh from its chrysalis. “Especially when it’s you.”
Ten days after the Avengers’ encounter with the Asgardian sorceress, James Buchanan “Bucky” Barnes was dropped off at the edge of Avengers Compound’s security perimeter by a long-haul truck driver, who was never relieved of the misapprehension that his passenger had been an ordinary hitchhiker. This was considered, by team consensus, better than the truth.
“Simple. You took down not just Hammer but also Ty—altogether hilarious, by the way, excellent work—you got Steve to out himself on national TV, and the press on all of this has been almost uncannily
“Wake up, old man,” Tony says, and his smile lights his eyes so bright and blue that Steve forgets for a moment to hate himself and everything that’s about to happen.
“You thinkin’ about conductivity?” Tony wonders, a bundle of wires already in his fist. He crouches until the ends meet the puddle of water, which lights up with a buzz that knocks the man flat on his face.
So Tony replaces the panel and returns to the analog novel Steve him with. Steve comes back for lunch, like he said he would. He talks about his morning in vague terms, enough to chat about, but not enough to reveal what he’s doing or where they are.
For all that one wall is nothing but windows from edge to edge, Steve hasn’t noticed the view. In the absence of curtains and furniture, it’s the most prominent part of the room.
He enters the code into the keypad and steps out into the empty hallway. His footsteps will be quiet this way. He’ll be careful. Whatever’s happening, he won’t end up in a fight. He’s going to learn what’s happening, and get back to Steve’s room before anyone knows he’s gone.
gesture. Like he isn’t standing, unarmored, with his back to a wall, only the water-damaged table separating them. “This is what your overrides are
Tony, of course, calls him Rhodey, but that feels too familiar for Steve. And James isn’t much better, considering there are already two James Buchanan Barneses on campus, and while Steve still thinks of them both as Bucky in his own mind, they’re also who he pictures when he hears the name
The air goes dry and staticky, like lighting has struck. Electric-blue ribbons of light swirl around Wormseed’s forearms. Victor mutters in the infernal language of the Darkhold, and before Wormseed can lift a finger, Victor is in motion and a fireball wide as a sequoia erupts from his metal palms. It swoops at his three opponents in a gust, enveloping them in flame, spewing slate-colored smoke as if from a coal furnace.
Tony didn’t cry at his own father’s funeral, but now his eyes are hot and damp and it doesn’t fucking matter anymore. If there’s the smallest chance for Steve to forgive him—to see what Tony’s aiming for, what he’s accomplishing, what he’s staving off—even if all Steve can offer him is
the autumn he turned eighteen. He found it at the back of a junk shop and paid a nickel for it, along with three other yellowing science-fiction novels, and read it in stolen moments on the weedy lawns of Central Park. He found it unremarkable at the time: it was only one of several space operas he read that summer featuring stoic men, accompanied by scantily-clad alien women, who traveled from one exotic planet to another.
Deals 1190 damage, plus 78 for each Team Iron Man Escalation tile, 105 per tile if target is Team Cap, or 115 per tile if target is Cap.
Stark smiles, turning one half of his mustache up like the hand of a clock. “Is that what we’re doing?”
“People hurtin’ other people 'cause they can. 'Cause they think it's fun. That it means they're powerful.”
. Maybe Steve wants Tony at full strength before punching him in the face; Steve has funny ideas about fairness like that. "Of course." He catches himself chewing on his lip and tries to smooth out any expression on his face. "Were we, are you and I" —he tries not to hesitate, but he falters— "together?"
A short little G-rated bonus (well, G-rated other than some swearing), in which Tony attempts to prepare for his date.
yeah I asked him why he has a british accent then and he was like “for all you know british people have gallifreyan accents”
When Tony comes out from the shower, there’s a plate of croissants and a carafe of steaming coffee on a small table, and Steve’s dressed, sitting on the bed and poring through a pile of paper copies. Tony doesn’t have anything to do but eat, and after that to linger over his coffee and watch Steve. He used to think about being with Steve like this, though when he pictured it, Tony was working and Steve was his audience. In Tony’s imagination, Steve was drawing Tony—his attention focused entirely on Tony, even when Tony was distracted.
The arc reactor presses gently against Steve’s chest; he’d expected it to feel warm, or for it to vibrate, maybe, but it just feels like metal through two layers of cloth. The novelty of it serves as a forceful reminder that they’ve never hugged before.
, a lavender-skinned woman from the Crystalline Moon of Urlak named Klithua Aniig, spends her travels with Brickenn Jamith trying and failing to learn more about him.
“And the other scene we caused?” Tony asks—though, judging by the email he just got from the Avengers’ marketing team, it’s probably pretty good. Unless, of course, people are buying the merch to burn it.
"I was going to be on your side," Tony says. On the back of his hand, a line runs through the center of a series of diamonds, arcs, and triangles. The shape in the middle is smudged. "I can't fight you again." It sounds less like a statement and more like he's trying to convince himself.
Tony clears his throat. It’s overloud in the hush they’ve created for themselves, the feeling of breath held before a plunge. The breadth of the room gapes around them with an agoraphobia earned in lowered voices. “Can I ask you something?”
“It’s happening again,” Steve breathes, tugging Tony in closer. “I hear voices, sometimes. Voices I’m supposed to know. Then the ground shakes and there’s snow everywhere—always snow—like back on the front.”
“And plenty of guests with smartphones,” Hardison agrees proudly. “There’s no way he and Hammer can say any of
The fella in the white suit is still in town a fortnight later. He has two other strangers with. One's got bone-white hair and a bottle-green suit with alligator hide boots. The other should look the most usual, in his black suit and bowler hat, but he catches the light wrong. He sits not quite right in the world, like turpentine trying to mix with water. The three of them take up a whole poker table on their own. They each have more cards in their hands than Steve’s ever seen allowed in a game of poker. He wonders what game they're playing.
Tony checks his fuel canisters and packs his bag. He fills his flask with water, as well another he’d found in the kitchens. Fire and water, both tucked away in his pack. He snags some fresh apples and fluffy, white bread from the pantry on his way to the front gate.
Flutters of light reflect off the fountain in the center of Avengers Park and onto Tony’s gauntlet as he skims it over the surface of the water. It ripples with reflections the color of candied apples. Tony turns at Steve’s approach, turning a sunlight-bright grin his way. Steve tries not to shuffle self-consciously at the sight of his own tense reflection in Tony’s sunglasses.
trusting—Steve to wield this power over him. For standing there and telling Steve to kill him. How dare he demand this? How dare he goad Steve to do this?
have—jumped at a chance to stop Tony for good. He’d be doing it right now, if he didn’t know this, this fact that would make it so goddamn easy. He’d expend more effort snapping a wooden support beam.
. That’s how Steve’s always thought of it. Maybe it was getting his start in a singing and dancing show.
"And I'm awake because of" —Tony points at a Fibonacci spiral near his elbow— "magic?" The IVs are gone, their insertion points blotted with cotton balls and sealed with medical tape.
“Oh, I dunno.” After a pause so long Tony thinks Steve’s fallen asleep, he says, “I didn’t like how she looked at you.”
Tony reaches solid ground after near an hourly of clambering down rows of teeth like rungs of a ladder. Well, solid it might be, but ground it is not; the surface under his feet, and in fact the walls of the cavern where he stands, are pink and wet and heave with the rhythm of a great, breathing beast. The undulation under his feet is not unlike the rocking of a boat, and this is what Tony imagines he is walking upon.
Dozens of figures emerge from the ship. Steve recognizes every one of them. Most have been Avengers. Captain America is among them. So is Iron Man.
“Fine,” Tony grouses. He takes his phone from his coat pocket and pulls up the app for the only pizza place in town that delivers. “But I’m buying.”
“Jealous?” Tony whispers, pinning Steve’s wrists above his head. He nuzzles Steve’s shoulder, then bites it. He grinds his teeth against Steve’s skin until he draws blood. “You know what you mean to me, Steve.”
Tony, fully armored, sits on an intact chair at a mostly-intact table. Steve hopes it’s Tony, anyway; no doubt Extremis allows Tony to operate any number of unmanned armors and to speak different words from each one without ever opening his mouth.
“Does that mean we’re eventually going to court your supposedly nonexistent death wish?” Rhodey asked.
“I haven’t done anything of the sort,” Tony called out, trying to ignore Steve’s almost silent snickering. “We’re being good, Rhodey.”
“Or both,” Tony said softly.  His eyes hadn’t left Steve’s face.  “Both is doable; I can definitely work with that.”  His jaw ticked sideways, a thinking gesture.  “I love the lace, baby, but it’s time to get it out of the way.  Put your hands right here.”  He raised both fists in front of his chest like Clark Kent about to turn into Superman, and Steve realized immediately what he wanted.  “Yeah, just like that.  You know what I want you to do.”
But that point was moot since he was fine and among friendlies (there was always a possibility that he
"Yeah," Tony agreed.  He slipped off the bed and started pushing.  Steve turned where Tony steered him, so that Steve was sitting on the edge of the bed with both feet flat on the floor, knees spread.  Steve pulled his jacket off entirely, sending it sailing across the room, but when he went to do the same with his t-shirt Tony stopped him.  "Leave it on," he smirked.  "You'll like the textures."
Refocusing, he hastened to reassure Steve. “Not that long. It’s May now. Nineteen forty-six. You’re missing a little over a year.”
Tony panted, lying still where he was, eyes shut.  Small shivers occasionally wracked him, and after a second, he pulled his right hand free, drawing it up to brace him against the bed.
“They were the best,” Steve said wistfully. “I don’t want them to think I’m dead.” Left unspoken was the silent
When she pulled back, it was only far enough to let their noses rub together, breathing in deeply and reveling in the moment.  Tasha smelled like expensive perfume and cheap wine, iron and synthetic oil.  Intoxicating.  Delicious.  A terribly tempting bad idea—but then, Gwen had always been good at running with bad ideas.  She leaned in again bit Tasha’s lush lower lip, not hard, but firmly.  It seemed to wake Tasha up, to send her gasping, groping for Gwen’s hips and hauling the two of them in tightly together.
War was many things, but it definitely wasn’t pretty. Once upon a time Tony’s heart would’ve kept him out of the danger but as Iron Man he hadn’t the luxury. Or at least Fury hadn’t cared about small details like that.
so good, and all the aches that had spread throughout her body were gathering in, now, coiling around in her center, and she was so close,
Tony didn’t answer immediately, letting his hand drop. Steve didn’t pull his hand away, so now they were touching hands on top of Tony’s lap. (Not for the first time Tony was glad it was just Jarvis and Rhodey outside.) “I didn’t want the way you looked at me to change,” he admitted quietly.
The bed dipped as Tony climbed in.  “So then.”  A hand fisted in Steve’s hair and pulled his head off the blanket, shaking it back and forth.  “Do you know?  What I would do?”
“Wait!” Steve’s grip was unshakable, just on the verge of too tight. “We don’t know what’s out there!”
His breath still fogged the air as he continued forward, but the skin on his face wasn’t stinging as badly. Neither did his lungs as he kept breathing. It was almost as if the air was warming up…
Tony didn’t answer immediately, taking a moment to pause and look back to where they had come from. The village was out of sight, and they were surrounded by mostly rocks and the occasional scraggly tree that was just that determined to survive.
Rather confused at the easy acceptance, Tony shot Rhodey one last look before returning his attention to where he should place his feet. They needed to get higher still, and he wasn’t sure he could do it with a heavy backpack strapped on.
This wasn’t a first for Tony, but normally he had a little more to go on when it came to what he was looking for. Here he was literally navigating blind, with only an eerie feeling that kept prodding him to look over his shoulder for the ghost saying hi.
“I already do,” Tony said just a tinge sharply. A second later he exhaled, shaking his head. “I’m sorry. Yes, Rhodey,” he continued in a gentler tone. “I can’t explain it, but I do. I trust him. If you don’t trust him, can you at least trust me?”
The kiss lingered and drew out, becoming an exchange of teases, each one chasing the other’s mouth when they went to withdraw, coaxing them in again, on and on.  Gwen felt the tension slowly leaving Tasha’s body, felt her relaxing into one of the first genuinely nice moments she had had in... a while, Gwen was guessing; impossible to know for sure how long.
Tony was coming.  He pulled Steve in by the arm he had wrapped around Steve’s neck, dragging his head down so that the come splashed into Steve’s mouth, across his cheeks, down his neck and his chest.  One stream and then another, and Steve stuck out his tongue, trying to catch the last of it just there as he finally let go a shuddered his way into an orgasm, loosing his own seed into the warm, willing cavity of Tony’s body.
The negligee was soft and light, barely weighing anything.  It hung from straps that were essentially just ribbons, and the neckline was almost straight—there was a mere hint of curve—before falling off diagonally to pass under his arms.  It would almost have been demure if it weren't transparent from the lace.
Steve nodded once, eyes closing. “I think I knew,” he said quietly. “I think I knew that I wasn’t going to find my team…that I wasn’t home. But you were there, and I kept thinking that it couldn’t be true. How could I not be home if it felt like I was?”
actually stagger a step, going sideways until he caught himself on the wood veneer of the conference table and brought himself back upright.  His momentum was gone, his ire burned away by shock. His blood, already pumping fast from fury, heated even hotter and charged in a new direction.
She breathed in as Cole lit the cig for her, then took it out, breathed out a stream of smoke, and sat back on the vanity pouf.
His hands tried to work at his shirt, but he’d lost feeling to his fingers the moment he’d hit the ground. He couldn’t tell if he was touching cloth or skin or repulsor pump and the encroaching blackness wasn’t helping matters.
“Of course,” Steve said. “That was before I led my unit. They, uh…didn’t quite think I had it in me. So I supported the war effort in other ways.”
He opened the clasps, dragged them down the same way his own pants were.  The red g-string was nothing more than a scrap of fabric, egregiously distorted around the hard, dark erection Stark was sporting.  Steve snapped the strings with two quick tugs of his fingers and took it, pulling it up to his nose and breathing deep.
She dropped the bra—Gwen automatically caught it, so a point there to Stark—and then leaned back against the door of the changing room, making no move to leave.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve from behind and rubbed his face against Steve’s back.  Possibly that was affection; also possibly, Tony had dried come on his face and it was itching.
Tony set the shield aside, touching the man’s neck again just to confirm that he really did have a pulse. It didn’t take as long this time, and his pulse wasn’t as faint as before. It was also beating faster.
to sleep in the bed which would hopefully be warm and full of snuggly Tony by that point, so he had talked Clint into flying the back even though they were all exhausted.
Tony dropped his eyes, hands fisting in his blanket. “Yes,” he admitted, throat thick. “There was… Too much didn’t add up. Not that you were lying, but nothing of what you said matched up with what we knew of the war, and we were in it pretty deep.”
Tony’s stuff was still outside and rather poorly hidden. His enemies were the persistent sort, especially since they knew he found interesting artifacts. And while Steve wasn’t an artifact, he was interesting.
“Well, that’s not surprising,” Steve said. “You’re clever. You’d probably revamp their entire weapons system in a week.”
“Right.  Remind me, of the two of us, which one of us is currently crushing their erection into kevlar?”
Tony had pulled up the video, Steve thought.  He wasn't really sure what that meant.  Had Tony just been frustrated by the day, looking to get off?  Was this Tony’s normal routine?  Steve had a flash of memory of the way his mother had always come home—in the early morning, since she had worked the night shift—and put the kettle on to boil before collapsing into a chair and dozing for the few minutes before the whistle.  The doze always helped her fall asleep, she said, and since their curtains were thinner than even their shirts, Steve had figured she would need all the help she could get once the sun was up.  Was this just Tony’s version of dozing while the kettle boiled?
Nepal wasn’t a country he’d been in before, but then Tony hadn’t been to every place on Earth yet. He’d seen a lot, but he hadn’t seen
“We don’t know that.” Tony reached out to touch him, beginning to shift his legs so he could sit more on his knees—
Tony’s “holy shit” was soft and amazed.  He shook his head and then said louder, “Yeah, please do—Jesus, Steve...”
“Oh, but you were the one who set the rules of this little adventure, remember?  I’m just doing what you said!”  The dark delight carrying Tony’s words sent happy shivers down Steve’s spine.
to have equivalent imperfections, the human equivalent of a pigeon’s nest on the roof, but whenever Steve went looking for them, he missed the flaws in his entrancement over the movement.
“I suppose it’s a good thing she couldn’t come this time,” Rhodey said, sighing. “She’d have both our heads by now.”
Tony ordered FRIDAY to switch to their last “session” in the lab, the one Steve had been restrained for.  In the hallway, Steve shuddered, a wave of heat crashing over him.  He could still remember clearly the length of red elasticized cable wrapping around his wrists.
“And you are?” Tony asked when the man didn’t respond. The man was still touching his face. It was getting a little strange at this point, although Tony wasn’t sure if he wanted to point it out (it wasn’t every day he was touched like this by a gorgeous man who seemed really freaking familiar).
He was focused, Tony was, his gaze fixed on something Steve couldn’t quite see.  Steve would have been able to catch a glimpse of it if he were to move forward just two feet, but he chose not to.  It was worth it for the opportunity to watch Tony in peace for a while.
Gwen twisted her hips over and over again, pressing into Tasha’s knee, even as Tasha blew cool air over her aching nipple and moved to the other breast.  Tasha’s hands were hard against her shoulders, holding her down just right, and then Tasha’s teeth closed over her tit and Gwen threw her head back, knocking it against the floor.  “Good!  Yes!”  She grabbed Tasha’s head by the hair, pulling and holding her in place, and ground herself down against Tasha’s thigh, loving the pressure of it, the feralness of rutting.
But once Tony was gone, Steve got moving.  The first order of the day was talking to FRIDAY, getting Tony's schedule for the day laid out and arranging that certain portions of that schedule would remain fixed in time, no matter what distractions and shenanigans Tony got up to in Cleveland.
hit a little too close to home.  Steve flashed back to half a dozen entitled assholes who had tried their damnedest to grind him into the dust and saw red.  He reached out and jerked Stark towards him, looking down, his jaw clenching with righteous fire—
“No.” Steve tilted his head. “But you saw the uniform, the shield… Besides, I don’t know why, but I trust you. I didn’t have to tell you my name – I shouldn’t have – but I looked at you and couldn’t think of a reason why I shouldn’t.”
“Exactly.” Tony pulled his hand away from the ice, wiping the water off on his pants. He didn’t put the glove back on just yet, watching trickles of water run off the ice and to the ground. He turned off his flashlight, wanting to spare the battery since Rhodey had taken his own out now.
Behind him, Tony groaned, loud and long.  The slick sounds sped up, in stereo, now, and Steve desperately wished he could see.  “Oh, God, you’re going to kill me.  Okay, I’ve got it—Jesus, I’m getting pretty close, myself, Steve.  This is going to be over in another few minutes.”
magazine, and the man known worldwide over as Iron Man, had seen a great deal of things that most people could never even dream of. And some things that people did.
He turned his head, pressing his lips to Steve’s hair, breathing him in and thinking the future looked awfully bright. Maybe he didn’t have a cure for his heart yet, but he had something else right now.
Tony’s heart squeezed in his chest; he bit the inside of his cheek to focus. “That sounds good,” he managed. He touched Steve’s face with one hand, fingers stroking along that strong, angular jaw. “And I promise that I will always find you.” He didn’t know where that promise came from, only that he meant it down to his bones.
Steve suppressed a shudder as all of the blood in his body abruptly changed direction, his hands curling into fists just to feel the pressure against his skin.  He cut his gaze to the real Tony, live in front of him, watching as—as
He seemed marginally more cheerful than he had yesterday, asking Tony questions about what he did and where he knew Rhodey from. He didn’t ignore Rhodey, but it was clear that most of his attention was on Tony, and he sometimes looked at Tony like he was trying to figure something out.
. (Like Tony was somehow the sun or another star that didn’t make someone’s eyes burn out and Steve was so goddamn blessed to see him and maybe Tony was exaggerating a bit now.)
“Do I know you?” Zemo asked, sounding politely confused. “Is there a reason you’re still standing here when you have better things to do than defend someone who doesn’t need it?”
didn’t seem to be suffering from scratchy lace; in fact, Gwen quickly discovered, Tasha didn’t seem to be wearing any bra at all, and had small loops of metal threaded through her nipples.  Gwen groaned and pulled out of the kiss, resting her head on Tasha’s shoulder.  “How,” she panted, “how are you this... this....”
“Where are we?” Steve asked, sitting up. He reached for the shield, pulling it to his side in a protective gesture.
Suddenly, Steve was hard and leaking, a minute from going off, if that.  Tony knew it, too; his hands jerked open Steve's pants—Tony smirked when he found the fly already open—and then he was pulling back, dropping to his knees.  Steve moaned as Tony mouthed at Steve's briefs, pleading before Tony even got started.  "Please, Tony, your mouth, I need—”
“I’m not suggesting that.” Steve’s voice was frustratingly calm. “Let me go first and see what’s going on.”
Nighttime would be a different story, but Tony had the supplies needed to make it through without freezing his ass off. And if he forgot anything, Rhodey would have remembered it. His best friend was neat like that.
Tony toppled slowly over on the bed in front of him, tipping to the side so that both of his hands could work.  His left hand sped, the length of the strokes shortening until he was barely nudging the head of his cock, thumb circling directly over the frenulum as he beat like a hummingbird’s wings.  He gasped Steve’s name—Steve barely managed not to reply—and on the screen, out of Steve’s line of sight once more, Steve’s own voice said,
“So what’s the deal with the shield?” Tony asked once they’d been driving for about fifteen minutes. “It’s not exactly standard Army issue.”
Slowly shifting to an upright position, Tony winced as his chest complained at the movement. The entire area felt like one giant bruise, even if the skin looked mostly fine. There were the scars surrounding the repulsor plate, along with pale, pink streaks arcing out from it. What was definitely not normal was the deep bruising surrounding the entirety of the repulsor plate.
She stubbed out her cigarette with half its length still to go, then shook her hair—tucked up into a loose and lazy updo—to settle it and gestured towards the door.  The dress curved in tightly under her rear; she could feel it pressing into the upper backs of her thighs, but it was so short that she could in fact still move in it, if she needed to.  She took comfort in that.  “Shall we?”
He couldn’t quite tell how he knew where to go, but something in his gut told him this was the right way. It wasn’t anything that would fly with Rhodey, but a guess was a guess and they didn’t have anything better to go off of.
Tony moved to answer flippantly, then stopped as he considered the question more seriously. He’d thought the man might be an alien…
That definitely wasn’t anything Tony had ever seen before. Clearly Zemo had been busy since the last time Tony had seen him and escaped his clutches.
But when it came to drawing Tony, Steve always felt like he couldn’t quite get it right.  Tony’s face, he knew,
Stark’s eyes narrowed.  She leaned forward over Gwen’s shoulder, speaking directly into her ear.  “Is it?  Interesting.”
Tony swallowed.  "I'm gonna say anything we do while you're dressed like that, I'm gonna like."  His eyes roved over Steve's body, and he stepped forward.
“Gabriel Jones,” Steve continued. “Dum-Dum Dugan. James Morita. James Montgomery Falsworth. And Jacques Dernier.”
Ten mystical rings that each did something whacky and ridiculous but all added up to something that no sane man would go up against? (Tony would say he was sane; his friends begged to differ given the hijinks he got into.) That also seemed like a cool story told to kids at bedtime but was another fact of life for Tony that he wished had never happened.
Tony went to shove at him, but Rhodey jumped ahead, laughing, so he almost tripped over a loose rock. Stumbling, he regained his balance and straightened his thick jacket. “We stick to the path for now,” he said, trying for a serious tone and probably failing judging from how amused Rhodey still looked.
“Not selfish at all,” Tony said, lips quirking into a small smile. “I’m grateful, too. I’m in this gig for the adventure, not just finding a cure. I’m sorry you got dragged in my mess.” He hesitated, then asked, “What happened to Zemo?”
In lieu of anything better, Tony and Rhodey started out on that the next morning. Bright, early, and still rather bitterly cold. The sun hadn’t yet had a chance to warm the air, and their breath fogged the air.
“I take it back.”  When he did speak, Tony’s voice came out soft and shaken.  “You’re not gorgeous, after all.”
No sooner had the thought crossed his mind than he was leaning forward, trying to see what Tony was looking at while still keeping his weight pressed back on his heels, at the edge of the hallway so the floor didn’t squeak.  (It was Stark Tower and the floors probably didn’t squeak anyway, but Steve had learned his sneaking skills a long time ago and wasn’t planning on changing them now.)
Hell, he’d live a lot longer if he just put up the Iron Man suit and the gig for good. But he couldn’t do that. Besides, he didn’t want to live just a
“Like that," Tony said, collapsing into a more comfortable position and opening his buckle immediately.  "Just—oh god, this is—yes—oh, hey, lube under the chair, nice—run your hand down your chest.  How does the lace feel?"
There was a sharp inhalation that wasn’t from Rhodey, along with a faint groan. Tony’s head jerked from where it was bent over the shield, and he saw the man grimace, nose wrinkling.
“Yeah, Tony,” Rhodey drawled. “Where’s your Dyke? You look a bit like one of those mustache-twirling villains…”
Some of the joy seeped out of Steve’s expression to turn to worry. “It’s…you were out for a while, Tony. We were taking turns watching you.”
It was likely this wouldn’t be one of those. There were no obvious red flags in the area, and Tony wasn’t even going to be taking his suit like he did during his most dangerous escapades. It was too clunky and unwieldy to take when he went exploring (now if it was more streamlined, easier to put on, and not as likely to bring the cave ceiling down on his head…).
idea,” Steve argued.  He turned in Tony’s arms and stepped backwards into the tub.  “I just made it happen; you’re the one who came up with it.”
Tony Stark, inventor, millionaire, businessman, adventurer, adrenaline-junkie (as some people would insist), war veteran, world-renowned traveler, hero of
“It sounds like you,” Steve said, sounding sincere. Coming from anyone else, it could have been an insult. Steve made it sound like red and gold being Tony’s colors was as natural like the sky being blue.
feel good.  Past the tight clench of the muscle, his own channel was warm and close around him, and it felt hot at the same time it felt viscerally wrong.  Maybe
The effect was instantaneous: the crowd screamed and scattered, running probably for the exits but mostly into each other.  The press of bodies became intense, and Gwen started a mental timer.  She would give it no more than a minute before breaking cover and taking charge; there was no excuse for allowing even
“I will not allow any living being to pass me, nor will I share what I know; not without receiving something in exchange.”
It takes no time at all to reach the Roxxon silver mines from Doom Manor, even on foot, except Tony and Victor don’t quite make it all the way there before they catch sight of three figures standing in their path. One is dressed head to toe in green, another in black, and the third, out in front, wears nothing but white.
Steve opened his eyes and saw Tony. He somehow managed to hold grip of Steve's hand in just a nick of time.
"You too, Boss" He said and drove off. Tony stood there in silence. He's eyes widened in shock. "Did I just ditched my one-night stand for Steve?" He muttered to himself.
Tony couldn't help but wonder why Steve looked so familiar, especially those beautiful blue eyes of his. Tony was sure he'd met him somewhere, but where? There's no way Tony would forget someone who was this hot. Tall, blond, blue eyes, broad shoulders; Steve was the full package.
Tony's eyes grew bigger, he had an epiphany; he was only thinking about Steve though. The Steve he'd just met a while ago.
He knew those brown eyes and that face very well. There wasn't a day where he didn't think about that day.
Something about the way Steve said it, almost sounded flirtatious, the man must've noticed it too. Steve stared into the man's eyes and was lost in them. How could anyone have such ravishing, beauteous eyes.
Steve was fuming with rage. He couldn't just let their relationship end like this, not after all the things they've been through.
Steve wanted more, his tongue demanded entry for the man to open his mouth, so his tongue could explore and taste every inch of the man's mouth.
Tony drove to the hospital and rushed inside. "This boy needs medical attention now" Tony demanded. The doctors took the little boy in the sketchers and immediately examined him.
Steve would rather die then let  anyone have Tony. There is no way in hell, he would ever witness Tony being happy or let him spend his life with some random person.
But for some weird reason he was afraid of seeing Steve's reaction. Somehow, he cared about what Steve thought about him.
Suddenly, Steve felt something extremely soft pressing against his lips. He realized someone was giving him a mouth to mouth, someone was helping him to breathe. They were breathing for him.
"That’s the one and only 'Tony Stark', the CEO of Stark Industries and his only 10 years older than us. This guy is literally a genius, he attended MIT at the age of 15. " Bucky answered proudly.
How in the world, would he be okay, after almost drowning? Tony was too weak to shout, so he ignored the question.
Tony pulled Steve by the forearm, causing him to crash on top of him. Thankfully Steve’s reflexes were good, he managed to put support on the bed with both of his hands. Which kept a gap between them.
The spark that King Joseph once saw in Steve's eyes ever since Tony had shown up was completely erased along with Tony's memories.
That’s when it hit him, Steve was in fact madly in love with Tony Stark. That explains why, most of the times his heart beats like crazy, that was because Steve constantly thought of Tony. How could Steve had been this stupid? It was obvious that he was in love with Stark, why else would he even think about Tony 24/7? Even an kid would be able to tell that Steve's in love with Tony.
Steve walked closer to Tony. He took a deep breath and started speaking. "Mr. Stark, I'm deeply sorry. I invaded your privacy and heard things I wasn't supposed to. But, believe when I say, I won't tell this to a soul.
Tony removed his hands away from Steve's shirt and stood there frozen, staring at Steve in disbelief. He took a step back.
"Don't be foolish boy, I quite like this handsome man. I also know you-" Howard was cut off by Tony .
"My deepest apologizes, Captain but that I cannot answer. I can reassure you that, sir is safe and sound, there is no need for you to worry about him. " J.A.R.V.I.S explained.
"Stevie! Just what in hell, do you think you're doing with my man?" Natasha asked, she stood there leaning against the door frame, with her hands floded across.
The doctor pressed two fingers against Tony's neck, checking for pulse. "He's still alive, if we hurry and take him to the hospital. There's a chance of him surviving."
Tony glanced at man one last time. Damn, his one-night stand was fucking hot, it was a shame that he won't see him ever again.
" I wanted to let you know that, I know you're already feeling guilty. But, I understand why you'd react like that. Not being being able to do anything, while the person you love is slowly drifting away from you. I know, Steve and believe me when I say, someone will love you and adore you more than me. You were never mine to begin with, Steve. I can't give you the things you want the most, I can't give you a kid, I can't make you a father. I'm a playboy, I can't make long term commitments, I hope you understand, Steve." Tony stated, with frown on his face.
As a single tear ran down Steve's cheek, in contrasting with the rain drops that dripped down his face.
However, Steve had to admit the man was stronger then he looked, as he continued to surprise him even more. "Looks like I've underestimated you, Boo."
If only she had a chance to thank the young man properly for saving her son's life. She is forever in debt with the unknown young man.
Steve held Tony's hand. "No, Tony you're the one who doesn't understand. Don't even think for a second I'd believe that. You're the only person in the world who loves me limitlessly. You belong to me, Tony. Only me! You're mine and I'm yours."
Steve froze there, not knowing what to do or how to react. He's heart began to ache again, this time the pain was 10 times worser.
"Ah Tony, anyone would be lucky to have you as a friend. We're only asking you so much things about Steve, is because we know you're interested in Steve, platonic. Don't get me wrong. It's okay to want him as a friend or even more. That's the least you deserve." Pepper gave Tony a gentle hug, with sweet smile.
" Ah! Mr Stark, I didn't mean to stare. I kinda got lost looking for the bathroom" Steve lied. God, how he sucked at lying, hopefully Tony doesn't caught him. Steve hid his hand behind his back.
"Yes, I believe so. I asked one of nurse, she said it was the young man that saved you, bought these just for you." Sarah replied with a smile.
Now that Tony came into his life, he had completely forgotten about everything he ever hoped. He couldn't recognize it anymore. He was lost in a maze that was filled black haze, making it impossible for Steve to find his way out.
Peter just hoped Tony Stark would also fall in love with his dad, God knows how. After all, his dad was the best in the world, he deserved all the happiness. Tony Stark wad the key to all this.
Steve frowned at him. "So our plans are cancelled after all?" He asked, while trying so hard not to sound disappointed but he failed miserable. Steve was never good at lying.
Steve felt a gentle pat on his face. "Hey, don't you dare to close your eyes." He heard Tony say that him. But, why was it that Tony sounded so frightened and worried?
Steve continued to walk in the rain. His clothes were soaking wet. It was during in rainy days like this, he felt worse then being dead.
His tears stream from his deep brown eyes, heavy sobs teared from his throat. "I love her so much." Tony's voice sounded so broken, he looked completely shuttered; well maybe because he was literally broken into pieces.
Tony bit down his lips, trying to lower his voice. "I ne-ed you in-side me, right now!" Tony gasped, begging Steve to take him.
"Well, now that Tony knows, I'm sure both you get along even more. I know you're obsessed with the guns he designs. But, please do control that mouth of yours. Otherwise, we'll be hearing Tony speaking in another genius language, which we can't even to begin to comprehend. " Natasha stated with a deadpan expression. "Trust me, I've been there."
With that in mind, Steve got his act together and quickly took a shower. He freshened up and went to Tony.
There was no way, he'd let his feelings get in the way. He can't lose Tony, before even has him. That meant Steve needed to wait for the right moment to confess to Tony.
Those words felt a punch in the stomach. He made Tony cry. Now, Tony hated him, his only friend hated him. He didn't even call Steve by his first name, have they gone back to being strangers?
"We've reached to the Stark Tower" Happy stated. "By the way, you do realize you're smiling to yourself, what were you thinking about?" He smirked.
"Tony, how many times do I have to say it," The guy groaned. Tony chuckled and squished his face against the man's face.
Tony had a weak smile, slowly lowering the video camera down. "Me too, but I've got school and million of others projects I need to finish. Don't worry, I'll come and visit you once in a while."
That was it, he couldn't just stand there and watch Tony suffer. No! He couldn't let that happened, never.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's neck and smirked. "I'm all yours tonight." He then kissed Steve with a low growl, devouring him completely. Their tongues swirled with saliva.
His father averted his eyes from the newspaper and towards Steve instead. A bright smile breaks onto his face. His father got up and hugged Steve tight.
Steve wanted to get drunk, in hope that the pain would just go away already, but as being the royal blood, he had high tolerance in liquor. Which, fucking sucked 'cause there were times when he wished he was so drunk that he'd forget everything, even about the pain.
Steve pushed his thoughts back aside for now and nodded. He went to the bathroom and took a quick shower. Steve wrapped a small towel around his waist and got out of the bathroom while drying his hair with a towel that was on his shoulder.
"Stark was the one who brought you here, he's still in the hospital. He's friends with the director of this hospital. So they're having a long convo." Bucky read him like an open book. Was Steve that obvious?
Bucky was out of oxygen, he couldn't breathe at all. God! That was it, he was going die. When all of sudden Bucky felt Tony's grip against his head. Tony held his face and gave him a mouth-to-mouth, giving Bucky oxygen. Hopefully, it'd be enough for them to reach the surface.
Tony glared at them. "Pep, you can't be serious. I don't even know anything about Steve. How would I even tell you guys?" Tony let out a deep sigh.
Steve finally met him, after 10 long years. Now he was in front of him. Steve froze, he felt breathless.
"What, No way! How is it that someone as hot as you possibly remain single?" Tony asked in disbelief, not that he was exaggerating or anything. Tony hadn't expect that at all.
"You know the combination Bucky and Natasha make Uckysha or Natucky. But, I prefer Uckysha." Tony replied with a huge smirk.
"Did you actually think I'd allow you to play with my feelings, Stark?" He asked with booming tone of voice, as an evil smirk appeared on his face.
Bucky shot his eyes opened and stared at Tony with confusion. That was the least thing he expected Tony to ever say. "How did you know?" He asked.
Bucky tried pushing Steve away, but Steve's grip was iron hard, after a few seconds Steve slowly parted his lips away from Bucky.
Tony avoided his eyes, he couldn't hide anything from Rhodey. There was no point in trying to act normal in front of Rhodey with the whole breakup thing; cause the truth was he wasn't fine at all, no matter how hard he tried, the fucking pain won't go away.
Everyone was right all along, Tony was far too broken. He can never belong to Steve. He can never be his. Steve deserved someone more better; someone who'll give him everything he needs and cherish him with all their hearts.
"I'm curious to know him too, so tell us." Rhodey asked him. Both of them were very eager to find out about this Steve guy.
His head was on Tony's lap, he felt so warm and comfy. When was the last time Steve ever lay on someone's lap, well that was a really long time ago. He began to feel drowsy, his eyes were slowly shutting closed.
"That's great! Now let's get going then." Howard said, patting Steve on the shoulder and heading out first.
Bucky and Natasha chuckled, Tony never fails to amuse them. "C'mere, my little hero." Bucky said, while opening his arms wide, offering a big tight hug.
"Now, I seriously I have to meet Steve. So when are planning to introduce us?" Pepper shrieked in excitement.
"He couldn't have gotten far, he must be here some where. Find him at once." One of the guy in the group shouted, ordering the others to look for someone.
"Loved, as in past tense." Tony said. The moment those words came out of his mouth, Tony regretted it.
As he entered the store, the first he noticed was a 'Captain America and Iron Man' toy. Wow, that was a perfect gift, everyone loves superheroes. But, which one should he get? Tony loved Captain America, but what if the kid doesn't like it? Maybe, the boy likes Iron Man? Or even both. Tony sighed and decided to get both Captain America and Iron Man.
"Honeybear, what are you talking about? Of course, we all have to die, that's the whole point of life" Tony commented.
Tony carefully looked at Steve’s hand and sighed in relief. “That’s good to hear-" Tony moved a few steps back, when suddenly he tripped over his own feet.
Everyone was gone. Steve was the only one left in this cruel world. He was all alone. He wanted to cry, but not a single  tear would come out. It was as if a part of him had died in the ice. Steve couldn't feel any type of emotions, ever since he had woken up in this new era 3 months ago. All he felt was an empty hole in his chest; the pain was raw.
Steve gaped at Bucky, his were eyes mainly focused on his lips. Those lips, were the one's Tony's lips was pressed against. His Tony, used a mouth-to-mouth on Bucky to save his life.
The blonde stared at him in disbelief. Not that he blames the man. Tony might've been too straightforward and made him uncomfortable.
Tony got out his card and paid the fees for treatment and medications, he told them not to reveal his name to the boy's family or him.
One cold day, Steve was on his way to his best friend Bucky's house. His head felt heavy, from the slight fever he had. Despite, that Steve walked and walked until he'd bumped into someone. "Ah, I-I'm so sorry." He stuttered.
Tony than found a 'get well soon' card. After paying for everything, he went to the flower store next door and bought a beautiful banquet for the kid. Tony walked back to his car.
His hair brushed back and forth, in synced with the tender night breeze. The icy blueness to his eyes, reflected emotions that were deeply frozen.
The moment they were inside the motel room, Steve closed the door shut and lifted the man off the floor into his arms in a bridal style.
"Mika's Cafè" Tony told him of the place they're going to. Steve nodded and started his bike. Tony tightened his grip around Steve.
"Hmm! Pepper and Tony..." Bucky muttered. He was actually in deep thought and then his mind clicked.
Bucky chuckled "Hmmh! I didn't realize you get along with Stark this well." He replied. "How comes you didn't tell me, that you knew Tony stark?" Bucky asked.
Their friendship was over and it was all Steve's fault. Steve couldn't breathe properly, he felt dizzy. He took countless steps back.
"I don't know what’s going inside that genius head of Tony, but he's saying shits. Don't you dare to listen to him." Natasha warned, her tone was dead serious.
"Remind me to never, get off the wrong side with you 'cause Pepper my poor soul literally petrified of you, when you're angry." Tony gulped, he blinked repeatedly. He crossed his arms and smirked like a child who showed off their new toys to other kids'; felt superior and proud.
