Lestrade laughed appreciatively. Sherlock seemed at a loss for words.
“Right. So tell me. Just what have you and the ‘other John’ been up to in the meantime, eh?”
“You’re still attracted to him.”
He awaited no excuses, apologies, or protests. John didn’t exactly shoot off the chair—he wasn’t an overdramatic adolescent, never had been—but he was the sort that, once a decision was made, it was made, and he got straight to it. So he swung himself tightly to the side, mindful to not touch Sherlock who sat so close, rose swiftly to his feet, and marched out of the room. Then he shut himself into his room, angry at Sherlock, angry at his father, and angry at himself, most of all.

. The looks John used to give him—like early man looking at the moon: captivated, mesmerized, unable to look away at the brightest thing in the sky. Over time, however, that look had dimmed. John had grown used to the moonlight, and though he still looked at it with admiration and awe, from time time, and basked in its glow, on the whole, he took its presence for granted.

The men laughed, and the one behind him asked, “Does it matter?” and licked his ear.
But something else was happening.
“Dr. Stamford, you claim the drug can control an Omega’s scent. Inhibit it, in fact, so that one can’t be identified as Omega in public. Won’t that have a negative or, at the very least, interfering effect on bonding?”
“You said you were trying to be exciting for him again,” he said. “What did you mean?”
He nodded sharply. “That settles that.” But he was grinning.
John’s eyes burned with happy tears as he nodded, looking between the other John and Sherlock. Sherlock. He looked just like his own Sherlock, of course, but a little taller, slightly broader, but seeing him now, a flood of decade-old memories flooded back, and John swore he could almost smell him, too. The other Sherlock looked at him, and something passed between them, an understanding he would never be able to quantify or articulate, but it was real, and powerful. Something similar was passing between his Sherlock and the other John.
John’s eyes went wide. “You . . . did the shopping?”
He made to leave again, but something forestalled him, and he rocked back on his heel.
“If it were as simple as that,” said John, “it’s a wonder we haven’t swapped before now. This room looks
“Shhh,” she soothed. Then she softly started to pull his covers off and took hold of an arm to lift him.
John made an attempt to flail, but he was too thoroughly pinned. Though breathless, he managed to snap, “I don’t know what game you’re playing at, but get off!”
, of pent-up, ignored, all-consuming longing. Heat was coursing through his body like his blood was petrol and John was a struck match, and low in his gut (and another low place), he felt the stirrings of something desperate.
“Holy hell, John, what’s the
John froze halfway to the door and twirled back. “Jaffa Cakes, Sherlock? Right you are, I shan’t forget your favorites as well. Be back in a tic. Cheers.”
If he had to wait much longer, though, he just might die of high blood pressure and heart disease.
“What’s this?” Sherlock asked, running a finger across the seam. John couldn’t see it very well himself unless in front of a mirror.
“I said
Upstairs, the fairy lights still twinkled and the lamps were dimmed, but neither Sherlock nor John was thinking of sleep.
Sherlock blinked. All he had planned to say, all he

“You jumped one way. What we need to do is figure out a way to get you to jump back and leave John’s body for him to occupy once again.”
, telling grown men to turn their heads and cough, asking women the dates of their last cycle. But his mind was a million miles away. That is, a couple of miles away. On Baker Street. Stuck in an imaginative loop of returning home and continuing where they had left off, and wondering where it might go from there. He was both fearful and excited. That’s what the racing heart meant, right? Fear and excitement. Danger.
He gasped. “Oh shit.”
“Well,” he said with an overly dramatic sigh. “That’s the last of them.”
“I’d say I want to hear all about it,” said the excitable young man.
“What’s this?”
Squishing in sopping socks, dripping river water with every step, a soaking John Watson took the steps two at a time in his eagerness to reach the sitting room. He missed a stair, fell forward, but scrambled upright again until he could see the door, the only thing separating him from the rest of his life.
His examination began.

“I thought you were a doctor!”
[He let John read this, but held up a finger, forestalling him from responding, and kept writing.]
“This is better.”
“Is that a yes?” Sherlock asked breathlessly.
“You made that last one up,” John laughed, and Sherlock supposed there might be such drugs that one world had and the other did not. “Dunno what it was. The doc said I was too

“Why might he think his chances dismal?”
“Oh my
treat. Teas? Coffees?”
“I can’t bear it anymore,” John said, voice cracking with emotion, “this wanting you. Needing you. You. My God, Sherlock, if you don’t kiss me right now, I’ll—”
Without bothering to collect his change, he thrust himself out of the taxi and looked up and down the street, but Sherlock had disappeared.
“What?” Sherlock’s eyebrows lowered in consternation.
Swallowing hard, John moaned loud enough for Sherlock to hear: “Sherlock!”
“Spotted you through the window,” Lestrade said by way of apology for waking him. “And I thought, that couldn’t be Sherlock and John. Good lord, what happened?”
“—about the sex.”
“Pardon?”
Even though John pulled back to look into Sherlock’s face, it was too dark in the closet to see him properly. So instead, he reached to find him. Sherlock felt John’s fingertips against his cheek. “What?”
“Itchy feet. The desire to be useful, the longing for excitement, the need to be independent, and those are three things—three very important things—missing from your John’s life.”
But the police, evidently, had tired of waiting and were ascending the staircase. Lestrade, he noted, was not among them. Instead, they were five Alphas. And as a rule, the Met never sent five Alphas together anywhere, not unless it was to—
“Is your Alpha unkind to you? Does he hurt you?”
“No need for me to spell it out, surely: the uncharacteristic affability,” Mycroft was saying, like checking boxes on a list, “the air of confusion, delayed response to questions, apparent amnesia, complaining that scents aren’t as strong as they once were . . .”
“It’s strong. Good strong. I mean”—he took a longer drink—“very, very good. I was just, you know, expecting our usual. Cream and sugar.”
And just before the lift doors closed in front of his eyes, he saw, down the hall, Greg Lestrade approaching Molly’s door, pause, adjust his tie, slick back his hair, check himself out in the reflection of the window. Despite everything wrong with this world, John thought, there was at least one thing right.
Wait,
John’s only defense was a good-for-the-gander quip: “Once we’re done with me, I should return the favour.”
Sherlock popped the cork and poured two glasses. John, who had been holding his breath, released it in a rush as Sherlock handed him the wine glass.
John suspected it was a layman’s term. He grunted in acknowledgment.
“Molly Hooper,” she said, softly, dropping the
Shaking his head emphatically, Sherlock said, “We cannot ignore the facts. The biological facts. Alphas are vicious by nature. Omegas are smaller in everything from bone to muscle mass. It comes down to this: I’m built to fight. You’re not. Besides, if I allow it, people will say I’m mistreating you, to put it mildly.”
“I’m not a man easily repulsed. And if you tell me what happened, I’m not likely to be shocked, either.”
“Sherlock will be glad of it. He’s so moody when you’re away. Oh John, I can’t tell you how happy I am for you. All the ladies are talking about you and what you did, and we think it’s marvelous, just marvelous. Mrs. Turner, she won’t stop going on about how it’s just like those days in the sixties, and she’s right of course, and Mrs. Humphrey reckons your name will be in all the history books from now until history’s done being made. Oh, look at you, you’re blushing.”

) the light brush of thumbs; the coarser outer arm was kneaded like dough (“I’m determining your muscle definition, John”); and the skin at the crook of his arm, when grazed with the light pad of fingertips, jumped and John giggled.
“Just showing him how it’s done,” he said. Then, feeling daring, he clapped Sherlock on the shoulder and said consolingly, “Don’t sweat it, you’ll get there eventually.”
“You mean they get off?”
“Nonsense, John, you’re doing splendidly. And you’ll let me know how it goes.”
” John chuckled and shook his head. “This has nothing to do with
by letting me stand on my own two feet. You and Sherlock and the whole damn world, okay?”
“Okay.”
They stood at opposite ends of the room, John in the doorway, Sherlock by the window. He must have seen John get out of the taxi. His hands were deep in both pockets, and he wore a blue collared shirt with sleeves rolled to the elbows. Maybe it was the effect of John’s being slightly taller and marginally heavier (the nurse had measured and weighed him, and he was shocked with the numbers), or maybe it was the distance between them now, but Sherlock didn’t appear quite as tall and broad as usual. On the contrary, he seemed rather . . . narrow. Still tall, and certainly taller than he, but from shoulder to hip to floor, he was narrow as a rod.
“Now, Sherlock. Oh God, now, now.”
“So I’m not enough.”
. First
. It felt like a milestone and significant as any.
Trying to hide their faces from CCTV, they took a cab from the train station to Baker Street, riding in perfect quiet, each man engrossed in his own thoughts until they stood before their own door, looking around warily for cops who might be surveilling the area. They let themselves in.
“Did you have any correspondence with Jeff Hope? Did you ever, even once, speak to the man?”
“So. Um.” He made himself stand fully inside the room. It was his own room, after all. He shouldn’t feel like an intruder in it. Only, he did. A little. “Lestrade’s just phoned. The pack, they went after someone else. An Omega-X.”
“Yeah. Something like that. Not every Omega will go for it, I’ll grant you. But they should at least have the option.”
“You didn’t know, either,” said Sherlock. “I saw it, the way you turned to Harry, the way you turned away from Mike. You didn’t know that you’re . . . not you.”
really
“Don’t be so jumpy!”
“If there are no objections, then perhaps my examination may commence directly following breakfast.”
“Maybe you should risk it. Just once.” Sherlock smiled. “See how it goes.”
“It was bloody maddening.”
“Shut up, here he comes.”
John quirked an eyebrow, eyes registering confusion, and he slowly took Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock didn’t let it linger. He dropped the stranger’s hand, straightened his back into an even more rigid rod, and glared down at the impostor in his friend’s chair.
Being no stranger to being ushered into strangers’ cars, John felt his suspicious hackles rise, and he stopped cold. “Sorry, where are we going, exactly?” His eyes darted up and down the empty street.
“I mean, did the two of you get drunk? Did he come onto you?” Lestrade gasped with a thought. “Did Sherlock Holmes
“Why?”
Damn. Of course it didn’t work. He had recently changed his password to his old RAMC service number, but backwards, and Sherlock had yet to crack it. He had thought himself so clever. But of course, whoever’s life he was now living had not been in the RAMC and would never have chosen that password. He had no possible way of divining it.
“Here’s something,” said Chris. “It’s from what looks like a pseudo-Eastern philosophy spiritualism site, so maybe a little far-fetched, but bear with me. The article is called ‘Soul Searching.’”
“I do, too.” Sherlock came up behind him, wrapped arms around his shoulders, and squeezed gently.
” Sherlock caught up with John, seized his arm forcefully, and turned him so they were running together, right legs, left legs, keeping pace with one another at rocket speed. Behind them, Sherlock heard the

“It’s gone, Sherlock. It’s not on the map. I’ve never been, but I know my geography, and Taured has always—
John’s heart made a hard thud. It took him a moment to answer.
, Mycroft!”
“I think we’re finished here.” Sherlock rose to his feet and moved to the door, but his implied dismissal didn’t deter Mycroft from finishing what he had begun.
Torn between default outrage and quixotic impulse, he decided to settle on the latter and support her in what appeared to be romance burgeoning in the midst of tragedy. “Oh yeah? Greg Lestrade, right?”
“What about their understanding?”
“I’m all for it! But
She sat forward on the edge of her seat with sudden interest. “Oh my God. Oh. My. God. Are you two
John’s head fell back with a groan as he was transported from sitting room, through kitchen, down the hallway, and into what he had once claimed as his own bedroom. There, Sherlock deposited him—or rather,
In answer, Sherlock drew his head closer, and their lips touched, almost chastely. And in that kiss, Sherlock tried to communicate what he couldn’t find the words for. As John began melting into the sheets, Sherlock followed, tucked a bare leg between John’s knees, and pressed their hips together. John moaned and wrapped his arms more tightly around Sherlock’s torso, and they remained as close as though they were fused together, even as the heat built and pleasure spiked and the shockwaves left them gasping and crying out each other’s names.
Last night had been exploratory, like learning a new language: finding out how their lips fit together, learning how to sneak breaths without breaking away, discovering how different bits of skin tasted, practicing and pleasuring and seeking permission. They had ended up on this very couch, sitting side by side, letting their mouths work and their hands rove until a late hour and timid blushes and shy goodnights had parted them. In the morning, they breakfasted together while Mrs Hudson puttered about, and their toes beneath the table continued what their mouths at the moment could not. But once the flat was theirs again, after a few minutes of uncertain hedging and stolen glances, they found themselves once again on the couch, continuing the rehearsal.
“Cut it out.”
It was so much better than waking up alone.
Ten seconds later, Sherlock found himself retreating with great haste.
“Tell me where it happened.”
“My knowledge of this field is rudimentary, and I’ll have to talk to some colleagues. But what it seems to suggest is exactly what Dr. Serebryakov hypothesized: being in a state removed from his prime corpus shares metaphysical properties with that of being asleep. Oh, the implications! The scientific community will go mad with excitement!” She looked over her shoulder at John, who was holding his stomach, his face flushed with fever, and flashed a toothy smile, saying, “Oh, if I could just bite him right now.”
Sherlock, right there, on the other side of that closed door, sent his heart racing. He suddenly felt the days apart like they had been years, and the distance had been astronomical. Just seconds, and the time and space would collapse into here and now. How could he bear another second standing on this side of the door?
Then Sherlock, with a face of disbelief, said, “He’s gone.”
“You’ve just changed an entire world. Why are you afraid to change your own?”
“What’s happening? Where are we going?” John said through a yawn that stretched his mouth wide. “I need to watch the mirror. I’ll miss him.” His objection fell on deaf ears.
“No . . .”
How the hell was he supposed to do that?
. Like he’d never seen a dead body before, like he couldn’t handle the sight of blood. But that was perfectly nonsensical! John was a doctor, a soldier, and he had seen, smelled, and handled more dead bodies in the past two years than he had during his whole military career (that was, perhaps, an exaggeration). He never winced at the sight of them; he never flinched at the thought of touching them; he certainly never turned
Re-scent. That was to do with the bond mark on his neck, wasn’t it? Like before? He’d have to look it up. But not wanting to seem ignorant, he nodded and smiled tightly, and they left him to sleep.
“Sherlock!” John said, kicking him under the table. What a scandalous question to ask!
So he couldn’t go inside a pub without an escort. A thirty-nine-year-old man needed an

“That’s fantastic.”

this? John thought he’d been out on a case all day, and yet he had carved out what must have been hours, surely, to remove all the furniture and set up his own personal laboratory? The prat! John put up with a lot in this flat, but this was a step too far. Irritated, and getting more irritable by the minute, he tromped back downstairs, momentarily forgetting his bodily woes.
he wished. (John groaned.) John had just figured . . . Well. He figured that if Sherlock were to love/desire/have anyone . . . it would be him.
“Don’t be foolish, it’s too risky.” Sherlock rose from the swivel stool to face him and buttoned the suit jacket he always wore in his Mind Palace. “Like I told the other John, what good is swapping minds back if your body just ends up dead?”
Anderson sighed loudly, to get his boss’s attention, certainly, but also to attract Sherlock’s. Sherlock turned a withering eye on him.
“I need to say something,” Sherlock said. He swallowed hard. God, his throat was dry. “Yes. I loved him. Because he helped me—”

“This has nothing to do with

“You were doing
. John knew that Sherlock was a great believer in utilizing the five senses in his work, but as he had never been the object of inspection, he had never fully realized just how probing it could be. It seemed Sherlock was touching every inch of skin he could find: the soft inner arm enjoyed (
“Have you been in the wine?” He leaned forward and sniffed.
“What is all this?” He swept his arm over the table and to what surely amounted to hours’ worth of work.
Three seconds later, a mild voice bid him come in.
“What way? How many ways are there?”
“Are you all right?” Sherlock asked as gently as he knew how. Whatever was happening, whatever would happen next, they had just crossed a border, which placed them in new and uncharted, and possibly dangerous, territory.
“The cat’s name is Toby. A calico. Green eyes.”
“Bet I can show you a few moves,” John said, smirking. “When it comes to hand combat, I came in second in my class during basic training, and I was the smallest of the lot.”
John removed his hand and scooted back, but he lifted his lips to Sherlock’s once again, changing the rhythm from fevered want to slow-burning desire. “Softly.” He kissed. “Softly, my love.”
[John hesitated, wondering how much he ought to say.]
John gasped, aware of his immodesty, and tried to hide himself. “Sherlock!” he cried.
“You’re a criminal,” he said, shakily.
“I want to say I’m sorry. That was . . . unkind of me.”
There was a sudden
“A man of puns.”
“Tell me everything.”
“You or your Omega? Your questions were far too specific, a little
“Damn, Sherlock. You have no
Now? With Mrs. Hudson within earshot?
Shoving his hands deep inside his pockets, he started walking. He’d walked so much that day that his right leg began to ache. He didn’t think much of it, at first—it was hardly anything new—but it was about the time he thought that maybe he’d board a bus and just ride it around the city until they kicked him off that he was struck by a new thought.
“I shouldn’t have let you take off like that,” said Sherlock, something resembling contrition on his face. “We should have . . . talked.”
But on the other side of the wall, he thought he heard water running. Could it have been that John accidentally picked the wrong bathroom? He stepped outside again and slowly pushed open the pink ostrich, ready to retreat at a female shriek. But there he saw John, at the sink, bent over at the waist, patting his red face with cool water.
He flinched to hear her call Sherlock such a hateful name. True, others had called him that, and worse, but Harry had always been supportive of their bond. Maybe she was just being sympathetic in aligning herself against him? So, lips trembling, he shook his head on her ample bosom. “I . . . left . . .”
But this Sherlock. Upon hearing how his John and the other Sherlock had spent the heat, had merely offered a shallow and silent nod, seemingly unfazed, and the conversation had continued on to focus on more important matters, like the validity of quantum mechanics and how to get the mirror to work again. It appeared, however, that for three full days, the little detail regarding sex had been weighing on Sherlock’s mind, festering, until it exploded. Apparently, that was how ordinary people felt.
“While you were in the shower. Saw we were out and popped down to the corner store. Eggs, bread, beans, potatoes, and apples, too. All told, it was rather heavy.”
The doctor sighed out a long and silent breath. After what felt like an interminable pause, he finally said, “Righty then. Let’s have a look-see, shall we?”
“To the sin-bin, Watson!” shouted Mr. Gillespie, blowing on his whistle.
John had been awake for almost half an hour, but he barely moved a muscle. Morning sunlight illuminated the room, pushing through the sheer curtains, and the sounds of London going about business as usual floated in from the streets. But John just lay there, staring at the beautiful face of a sleeping Sherlock Holmes. Soft lines, softer skin. Hair deliciously mussed on top and flattened around the brow, where the salty sweat from last night’s . . . activities . . . had loosened the curls. His lips were pink and perfect, and the dark eyelashes against his alabaster cheeks looked like the work of a master artist.
Ten minutes later, all were sitting with a steaming cuppa. John took his the way he liked it, with no sugar but just a bit of lemon, and felt guilty for it.
As the day wore on and Sherlock got more and more agitated, like a kid on Christmas Eve or a drug addict in need of a fix, John made up an excuse to get out of the house, mumbling something about needing to buy milk or get a haircut, he had no idea. Whatever he ended up saying, the truth was, he just needed his own space, and that was something he could no longer find in 221B.
“At least buy me dinner.”
The sun was melting into the horizon, and John, unable to take one more step with the world crashing down on his shoulders, sank with it, leaning against the railing and staring down into the dark water of the Thames. His knees bobbed up and down uncontrollably, and his shoulders began to shake, and just before he cracked, he heard a familiar voice calling his name:
“Surrender!” John cried again.
“That’s an interesting theory, Dr. Watson,” said Chris Melas, who had sat with rapt attention as John recapitulated Alice’s story in connection with Chris’s own alternative version of reality and evidence of multiple worlds. “You’re suggesting that the author was from another world himself.”
“He was trying to gain admittance to a pub! What else would he be going in there for? We
“Yes, hello, yes, I’m John Watson.” He shifted nervously on the paper bed, his knees bouncing together.
“Oh John, you should have seen it,” said Sherlock, flopping himself onto the couch and toeing off his shoes, leaving them to clatter together on the floor.
world, a place where he was not, by law, by society, by biology, labeled inferior, fragile, in dire need of a superior hand to see him through life. But his stomach turned to think that his home world would continue on like it was, because no one could see a better way. He wanted to help it, fight for it. It wasn’t all bad, after all, and, he supposed, anything with even a little good in it deserved a chance to be saved.
The man jumped; a flock of pigeons took flight; and John, having startled himself, clamped a hand across his mouth.
“What are you saying?”
Or whatever the hell version of you keeps coming at me. So when I get back—and I

“Took it off one of the arresting officers,” he explained simply, passing it over. “As I understand it, you’re a pretty good shot.”

Fortunately, Sherlock spoke Russian, and the rest of the conversation proceeded in the foreign tongue:
“You’re not well. You should go home. Why don’t we find you cab?”
Until those little things began to stick, like food between his teeth.
“The testicles are crushed with clamps first,” said Sherlock. “Then yes. They’re sliced off.”
To his utter amazement, Sherlock smiled. “Aha.”
“Right there, Sherlock. Yes, yes, you got it, just like that. A little to the left. Perfect.”
taking the morning train. It’s
John stared, bemused, and abandoned his ready excuse to go make tea or use the loo or go for a long and silent walk. “For what?”
“No. We’re just here for a chat. John.” Sherlock gestured him toward the sofa. He sat, and the young man perched himself on the edge of a swivel chair, looking positively gleeful to be hosting his unexpected visitors. For his part, Sherlock remained on his feet, hands folded together behind his back. He stood rigid, chest puffed out just slightly, cutting a rather impressive figure. John couldn’t help but admire him, as he had always admired him. He ached for his own Sherlock.
“So you see, I can be handy in a pinch, if you’ll let me. Just let me. I’ll prove to you—”
John’s smile vanished.
Having never conceived of such an experiment before, let alone designed one, let
“When is your next estrus due to start?”
Mike’s small, beady eyes grew round. “Come again?”
“Please . . .”
“Mine too,” said Sherlock quietly.
“Sherlock Holmes,” said John, pulling the controls out of his hands and setting them aside. “Did you just propose marriage to me?”
Sherlock didn’t deign to respond, just sat back in his chair and pressed the tips of his fingers together in thought.
first meet?”
“Afternoon,” he said mildly.
“What?”
They were out on a case. Sherlock hadn’t truly expected things to go south, but he had accounted for the possibility and snuck John’s gun out of the flat just in case. Unless he anticipated danger, John usually preferred to leave it safely secreted away, from Sherlock as much as anyone (particularly the police, who had been known to make the occasional sweep). He didn’t quite appreciate Sherlock’s past filching and excuses like “target practice” and “bored.” But Sherlock always found it. John was terrible at hiding his things.
“We were both rather taken aback.”
When had this
All that remained was implementation.
“Why? Is someone after me?”
“After
Sherlock shrugged, accepting. “Fair enough.”
John shrugged. “Maybe there’s an element of truth to that. That’s how Alice got back, right? In the story? She . . . woke up.”
“Ha!” John exclaimed. Then he quickly ducked his head and pretended to rub at a spot on his trousers.
he caught a wink.
“Pardon?”
John managed all that, too!”
Sherlock didn’t often allow himself to regret. He did what he did, and damn the consequences. But he regretted touching John.
The small roller suitcase
“What are you saying, that your brain thinks it’s asleep?”
“Hm.”
He’d had horrific dreams ever since Afghanistan, dreams that stole his breath, shook him awake, made him afraid to close his eyes. Fortunately, since moving in with Sherlock, the dreams had decreased in frequency, but they hadn’t disappeared. That was all right—he was used to sleeping alone, and was therefore his night terrors were shielded from witnesses. No longer: he felt Sherlock’s shadow behind him, upright and alert.
“I want names.”
Keeping his back to Evans, who was watching from a distance, he explained to John the various components of the pistol, from grip to safety to trigger to barrel, and though he spoke clearly, he spoke rapidly, and John was holding his breath just so the sounds of his own breathing wouldn’t compete for his attention and he could take it all in. As Sherlock transitioned into discussing how to hold it and explaining what the kickback would feel like, John felt his heart begin to pick up a little more speed. He was eager to hold the weapon for himself, feel its weight in his own hands, and see if he could do even marginally better than he had the first time Sherlock had thrust the gun into his hands and shouted at him to fire. He licked his lips and nodded at everything Sherlock said, showing him he was ready.
“Exactly! You’ve developed something for
, Mycroft. I know what you’re thinking, and you’re wrong.”
“Then what was it? About
as his back arched.
He stopped short and saw a portly, bespectacled fellow angling toward him, huffing through a smile as he lumbered along. John quickly tried to reason out why this stranger was chasing him down. Had he dropped his wallet? Had he knocked into him and not even noticed? Was he some sort of messenger? All he knew for sure was that he had never seen the man before in his life.
“I’m not. I’m more directly refusing to have this conversation at all. Are we finished?”
John hurried around the flat. He threw a loaf of French bread into the oven and left it there to blacken while rushing downstairs with a bottle of bleach and scrubbing the front entryway; he left the soaked rag over the handrail. Back in the flat, he rummaged in the cupboard for candles he remembered having stored there, but all he found were torches and spare batteries. So he abandoned the scented candle ruse and found a tin of aromatic spray instead, which he shook hard and filled the air with the scent of pine until the tin was nearly empty. Then he retreated to the bathroom, found a bottle of cologne in the medicine cabinet (he didn’t remember buying it), and rubbed it liberally into his hands and neck, up and down his arms and across his stomach until even he was coughing on the fumes. It was too much—he knew it was too much—but if things went well, Sherlock’s hormones would be stronger than any amount of perfume.
They had chosen the western side, where one could see the London Eye and Big Ben in the distance. With the other John, they had coordinated the precise location both Johns would assume. Only a waist-high, three-rung white railing separated the pedestrian from plunging into the river; it was easily surmountable.
“Sherlock!” Lestrade warns as he catches up. Sherlock stops and leans in close before Lestrade can say anymore.

So, Dr. John H. Watson.

If the people standing all around the flat hadn't already been silently watching the two, there would have been a gaping silence all around after that. Many people, Lestrade included, looked from John's shoulder to his leg, getting a clearer picture then ever of Sherlock's flatmate.
Throughout the few years the blog has been up, it's easy to see the Consulting Detective and his Doctor have amass quite the following, as each new post- both the personal and the ones documenting Sherlock’s brilliance- have more comments from people that “just stumbled across it” or were “sent by a friend and don't regret checking it out!” than the previous. People ask them all sorts of questions in the comments, about the couple’s relationship as much as asking them to “solve my mysteries please!!.” The later often responded to with “send us an email with the details, there's a link on the homepage.” At first any that ask for more details, Sherlock responds to with a great amount of detail, but as comments have a word count, and Sherlock tended to rant, eventually case posts start getting posted in double, one for those that like the stories from John's perspective, and one from Sherlock for those that like hearing all the analytical details. Eventually he comes across the post from about a year ago that documents the change in the blog's title from “The Personal Blog of Dr. John H. Watson” to “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes” There are several complaints in the comments of this post, all from Sherlock- and all effectly drowns out by the hundreds that loved the new name. Greg amusingly suspects that Sherlock probably complained a lot more in real life about the ludicousity of the title change, which probably prompted the next post announcing yet another title change, this time to its current title
“Yeah. He never really seemed the type.”
“Does it matter? Does any of it?” Donovan shoves in. “You know, he's just a lunatic, and he'll always let you down, and you're wasting your time. All our time.”
“Ye-yes. Sorry. Alright, that's what you were thinking. I'm sure it's what Jennifer Wilson was thinking too, but you're both so much more clever than that.” Sherlock took John by the upper arms, careful of shoulder. “You both knew your murders, and you knew you wouldn't be the last victims. Neither of you wanted your death to be in vain.
“What, why!?”
Well that did explain the shoulder and the leg, Lestrade thought to himself, not at all phased by Sherlock snappy attitude.
John chokes a little, “Nine million?”
“Yes I am, and no, I didn't.” John says, mimicking his earlier words before he turns to walk out of the room and down the hall back the way they'd come.
Well, still, he tries to cheer himself up by thinking. He did know one more, very important, thing for certain. John was definitely going to agree to the joint account.
“I didn't order a taxi. Go away.” Sherlock dismissed her, without turning around.
“Anderson, what are you doing here on a drugs bust?” Sherlock snapped.
“Oh, so not only did you wake me up for a drugs bust with no actual probable cause, but you're not even using actual, properly trained officers?” John asked with a bitter laugh.
So of course Greg looks the guy up. Sherlock my be an arse, and can take care of himself, but Greg worries. And Sherlock would totally harbor a lunatic criminal in his flat if he thought the guy was neat!
Though thinking back on that cab ride himself, Sherlock remembers John’s joke about a marriage proposal. Sherlock supposes his totally logical reply, when viewed by such a romantic as John was, could have been construed as romantic itself, if he'd meant it that way. But he's sure John knows he didn't.
Sherlock walked off briskly.
Then the week after that was
“Well, on behalf of the British Government, I can assure you, you didn't see anything. You came up here alone 'cause you made me wait in the car. You heard the gunshot and came up here, but the room was empty by the time you got here. Now I'm going to go, I wasn't here.” Then John starts to run, and Lestrade vaguely registers that he's no longer limping.
"That thing that you do! It helps me think!" Sherlock replied cryptically.
dating, but we hung out. His idea of hanging out though- he took me running around the city chasing someone down, just like this- I don't even remember what we doing, but it was the most fun I'd had in ages. So we hung out, sometimes with Clara and Harry, sometimes without. Most of the time I picked what we did, but I did love- Right, take a right, we're almost there.
“Dunno...”
At the museum they get confirmation that Soo Lin knew something about the deaths of Lukis and Van Coon, or at least about the one that had committed the murders, in the form of bright yellow paint across the face of a statue in the museum archives. RAZ finds them leaving the museum and leads them across the Hungerford Bridge into a skate park were more of the yellow symbols are already being covered by other artists tags.
“They all did.” Lestrade cut in. “They're not strictly speaking on the drugs squad, but they're very keen.”
“First we find all of the books they had in common,” Sherlock answers. “Then we see if whichever word is the first on page fifteen seems like a reasonable single word message to have left for Van Coon and Lukis. Most likely it will be a simple threat.”
The first post, when Lestrade finds it far to the bottom of John's posts, is from several years ago. It's titled
“But they're just for my hip- and your leg, they can't-”
"Oh yeah..."
“Well, you have just killed a man.”
Well there's really only one thing still on his mind he needs to sort: what Sherlock had said earlier that day. When he'd proposed they get a joint bank account, he'd said some things that meant much more than what Sherlock had meant them to. He'd said he had no plans to leave John, and that he believed- or it seemed to John that he was saying he believed- they were more commented to each other than a married couple, because they showed it with actions and not with words. It was such a sentimental and loving thing to say, and that was the problem. Because John loves Sherlock very much, but Sherlock had said those things, not because he was being sweet, but because they were points towards his argument, and then he hadn't realised he was even being romantic after the fact. Really that wasn't even the problem either, that Sherlock hadn't cared about the sentiment behind the words, or that had he, he might have only said them go get what he wanted anyway.
asking you.” John bit back imidiantly.
“I went to the morgue after that with Dimmock,” Sherlock cuts off any more of John's concern by jumping back into the story. “And we found that both men had the mark of the Black Lotus, thus proving their connection to Soo Lin, and that their deaths were murders. He offered me whatever I wanted in order to help solve the case. Every book owned my Van Coon and Lukis should be here sometime today.”
“And all together now, the password
“What is it? Quickly, where?” Sherlock insiste, unaware of Lestrade’s - and everyone’s- eyes fixed on them.
“Starving.”
“What about your taxi?” The landlady insisted.
“It's here. It's in Two-Two-One Baker Street.”
And just like that Sherlock's worries were flying out the window and he examined the body, and the rest of the flat, while John phones the Yard. Later, after Sherlock's basically done the Yard’s job or deducing Van Coon’s death to be a murder, not a suicide, and John has had to explain that yes John going through a stranger's dirty laundry is different than John going through Sherlock’s, for Christ’s Sake, the duo leave to explain to Sebastian everything they've got so far. Sebastian is as arrogant and unhelpful as ever, denying the murder and the subsequent threat to himself and his employees, and sends them on their way to “do the job they were hired for.”
“I'll explain in the cab!”
Followed by
“I'm fine, John,” the detective insisted, his voice a little stronger now. He grabs John hand away from his collar, I pulls in into a jog. “We've got to go to the museum, now!”
“How can it be here? How?” Sherlock leaned in closer to the screen, accidentally putting just enough pressure on John's shoulder to make him hiss in pain, and make Sherlock jolt back with a quick apology.
"The one where you shut up will do nicely, thanks." Sherlock said, still looking at only John, who was looking back at the other with a thoroughly
Well now John's just being ridiculous. It's obvious this is the only long term solution to their problem, even John should see that. What's there to think about?
“It's alright, I know,” the man said calmly, soothingly, leaning back against the counter now. Taking some of the pressure off his leg, Greg thought. He didn't seem at all bothered by Sherlock proximity, and Greg was starting to see a surprising picture here. “But I
So he's there in the visitor's room, and Harry just pulls us up to where he's abolutally
“Damnit,” Sherlock mutters furiously reach up hastily. “Quickly, pass me the photographs.”
John wakes up hours later to Sherlock curling up on the couch behind him. The flat is completely dark save the street lights filtering in through the window, and the dim hall light they almost never turn off.
“And where're you going?” Greg moves to follow.
After Sherlock's had a look at the wall, the security footage, and the layout of the trading floor, Sebastian tries to hand him a cheque. Sherlock waves him off as he turns to head back towards the trading floor. “I don't need incentive,” he says, despite the incentive of money being one of the reasons he came. “And John handles our money, give it to him.”
“Not interested,” the Detective dismisses with an eye roll, noticing a scratch across table, and covering it quickly with some of his notes for the experiment still set up on the table, hoping John won't notice it for a while yet. “I sent them a message.”
“Yeah- take a right, quick! Quick here!- We met at rehab.”
“Fresh air. Just popping outside for a moment. Vatican Cameos. Won't be long…”
“Recognise the paint. It’s like Michigan; hardcore propellant. I’d say zinc.” RAZ answers oh-so professionally.
“Yeah, but when you were dying, John… When you were being murdered: in your very last few seconds what did you say?”
“You were busy wasting your time, and Sherlock and I have an agreement not to argue when the other want to go to war.” John answered cryptically, but Greg understands all the same. The part of who went to war and who wanted to argue, not the part where Sherlock is apparently in the back of a cab with the killer, driving off to his death, and John seems fine with it.
expression. It would have all been almost funny if the situation wasn't so tense. If they weren't trying to catch a murderer.
But John would still see it that way, obviously, and Sherlock had meant everything he said, just not that way at that time. He wasn't going to leave John, and because of how long they'd been together and everything they'd already worked through, he was confident enough in himself to know John wasn't going to leave him. And he did consider the way the expressed their love to be much more impactful than just saying it.
come busting in here and waking me up. I only just managed to drift off, Sherlock.”
“Interesting.” Sherlock says with blatant disinterested.
“You knew he got in the cab and didn't say anything?” Lestrade barked.
what I mea- Oh what the use?”
“Why would we need two bedrooms?” Sherlock asks, looking vaguely offended at her as he pauses in opening one of the crates labeled “Van Coon” and pulling the books out.
“What about the symbols: do you recognise them?”
There was a long pause in updates, about a year and a half, but the next after that was title
“Rachel,” John said, impressed.
“Yeah, he uh, cleared off before I could get there. But a guy like that cabbie, he would have had enemies, I suppose… One of them could have been following him but... got nothing to go on…” Lestrade trails off.
“Part of a new exhibition.” RAZ says smugly, as they approach, adding more spray paint to the image of a pig-nosed police officer he's defacing the building with.
Sherlock tells John that he's gotten them a case, and after they've returned to Baker Street and put away all of the groceries, and John's forced Sherlock into eating “at least one sandwich Sherlock, you can't go into a case starving. I do not care what you say, it's not good for your thought process,” they hail another cab and get on their way, the strangely dark mood that had shrouded the morning completely gone now they've got some good news.
Sherlock has to pocket his mobile temporarily while he and John carry a copious number of bags on each of their arms out to the street. Sherlock suspects John did twice as much shopping as usually since he had Sherlock along to share the burden, and wait for a cab. Once they're in the cab, bags set carefully at their feet and between them, and in their laps so nothing breaks or gets squished- and God how tedious can this get- Sherlock pulls his phone back out and sees he has an email from an old acquaintance in his personal inbox.
“I'm sorry John, I got distracted thinking.” No really, who was this John, because Sherlock’s behavior was starting to scare him.
Greg's too shocked to do anything besides answer honestly. “Well, yeah, why?”
“What?” exclaims Mrs. Hudson excitedly.
“Mhhm, sure.” John says, dutifully hiding the cat behind the napkin dispenser, so that it's out of Sherlock’s view. “So walk me through it, what have you come up with, now you know where they've been and you got the cypher.”
and fires it at the window. By the time his head turns the Cabbie’s already fallen to ground out of sight, and it’s obvious Sherlock’s now yelling at him.
“Hi. Yeah.
"John's an army doctor. He's recently been invalided home from Afghanistan-
“You seem a bit more then
“You know,” says Mrs. Hudson from the doorway, as one of the last crates is being set on the floor. “There's another bedroom upstairs.”
“Hmm,” John hums, unimpressed, walking into the living room and collapses into his chair. Sherlock has an irrational thought, brought on by his ridiculous but undeniably sentiment for John, that perhaps John's leg or shoulder was bothering him today, but John's leg and shoulder have both been healed for months now, and John rarely ever complains about either. Then Sherlock realised that John was just being dramatic as an expression of his irritation, and relaxes.
“Oh. Oh I see. I'm sorry John, sincerely… I admit the temptation was there, but I really wasn't going to take the pill John, I wouldn't risk my life like that, I’ve promised you that before. Are you sure you're alright?” Sherlock asks, seeing John start to shift from one leg to the other as the adrenaline began to wear off, and his leg starts to pain him.
followed by several suggestions in a comments, all of which John replied to with
“And Dimmock still thought Van Coon and Lukis are suicides, to top it all off.” Sherlock finished, finally taking a stab at the eggs John has made him.
John studies Sherlock for a moment and the detective wonders what he could possible be looking for, when John says, “I'll think about it,” with an enigmatic smile.
John wakes up late the next morning to the sound of Sherlock shouting there's been another murder. He has a candy bar and some clean  clothes tossed at him as he sit up, and then they're out the door. They bounce around the city for the rest of the morning, going from New Scotland Yard to the victim’s- Brian Lukis’- flat, to the library in which Lukis had been the day before, and where they found more threatening cyphers behind a bookcase. There's a brief stop back home in order for Sherlock to run through the gathered evidence again, and add the new picture of the library cypher to mirror next to its companion from the bank before they're gone again, this time on their way to meet with an apparent painting expert who turns out to be...
Well, the blog is public…
“Sherlock…” John muttered.
out?” Greg asked, grinning ear to ear at the very idea.
“Good shot,” he says with a smile as he comes up to John, ducking under the yellow tape. “You cold?” he opens his arms, offering to share his shock blanket with John as his soldier’s breath mists in the cold January air.
Sherlock talks with RAZ for another minute, impressing upon him the gravity of the situation and just managing to get him to agree to keep an eye out when the officers RAZ had mentioned earlier rounded the corner, sending the three of them scattering. The cops chase them for quite a ways, one splitting off to chase RAZ, and one continuing to chase Sherlock and John. The officer gives a good effort too, chasing the detective and his soldier for three blocks before they lose him by ducking around a corner and into and busy little cafe. John tries to insist they stop for and while and have lunch at the cafe once they're sure the officer isn't going to come back around, but Sherlock insists much more convincingly that they're too busy before pulling John out the door.
Sherlock's sitting in his chair in the living room, his breathing only just evened out after an incredible fight with the assassin over a diamond right here in the flat, when he hears the front door open downstairs and then slam shut again. This is followed by the tell-tale sound of John stomping his way up the seventeen steps to their flat. Sherlock quickly grabbed a book and flips to a random page in an effort to look as if that's all he'd been doing since John left, because judging by the heaviness and speed with which John is trudging up the stairs, he's not having the usual trouble with his prosthetic, but rather is in a mood, and Sherlock really doesn't want to add to that by letting on that he'd had an exhilarating fight with an assassin over the fate of a diamond while John had been doing the shopping.
if you ask me.” Anderson mutter from the living room entrance.
“Funny, because I can't
, for the first time in
“Not really!” he hisses. “He gave me a vague threats-of-consequences by way of your brother! Sherlock he shot a man and didn't flinch, are you sure he's not dangerous, I mean what the Hell?”
“You're the one who shot him. Don't blame me.” Sherlock struggles to keep the grin off his face, glad John was alright for the moment. “Dinner?”
“Wh-what?” John sputters.
And then Sherlock remember earlier that day when he'd proposed the joint account, and John had said “he'd think about” and been utterly confusing.
Sherlock spends the entire trip to the store following John up and down the aisles with his nose in his phone reading through his and John's email inbox, the one publicly advertised for clients on their blogs. He's searching for something both interesting enough for himself, which is impossible because none of these people know how to rate their case, almost none deserve the high ratings they're given in the slightest, and with a well enough offer of payment to satisfy John. By the time John's filled the buggy full of all the grocery and lead Sherlock into a line- not the one for self-service Sherlock notes without bothering you look up- the consulting detective has completely given up on finding anything that wasn't completely dull, and he’s now looking thought the ones offering the most money, deciding which will be the least miserable to deal with.
“Anderson, don't talk out loud. You lower the I.Q. of the whole street.” Lestrade heard John snort rather loudly just then and Sherlock, though he hadn't been trying to one-up Anderson, smirked in satisfaction. “We can do much more than just read her e-mails. It's a smartphone. It's got GPS, which means if you lose it you can locate it online. She's leading us directly to the man who killed her.”
he wasn't noticing anyone else but me.”
“Oh, what now? I'm in shock! Look, I've got a blanket!” he ruffled the bright thing in emphasis.
“No.” John replies shortly, crossing his arms, because he really doesn't like RAZ, but apparently they need his help again.
“No, I only came up with it in the bank. It seemed the logical choice,” Sherlock answers honestly. It didn't need thinking about. Once the idea was there, all the reasons why it was a good idea had easily followed.
Sebastian Wilkes, from Sherlock’s Uni days, is apparently offering a gracious sum of money if Sherlock can come by the bank he manages and deduce the who, how and why someone broke into one of their offices the night before and sprayed graffiti on the wall. There's more details about what's happened in the email, and Sherlock decides that despite his dislike of Sebastian, the case is intriguing, and John would be incredibly upset if he found out Sherlock turn the money away.
“Space dear. You've made an even bigger mess of the living room than usually. I thought you might turn it into an office for this sort of thing, if you'd like.” Mrs. Hudson shoots back. “Don't go getting all offended, I'm not insulting the state of your marriage.”
and was just the sentence
“Mrs Hudson!- Oh…” Sherlock shouted and then immediately forgot about the woman in the wake of his realization, still looking at John. “Ah! She
“Anyway, we texted her phone earlier from mine, and he called us back.” John said, standing from the chair.
Well the middle of the night’s certainly a Hell of a time to think about it John, Sherlock chides silently to himself. Especially when you're the one that needs sleep to function during cases, you absolutely hypocrite.
“What is it then, Mr. I'm So Clever?” John asked.
As it was, Lestrade only realised that there was another bloke living in 221B when, about three minutes into his and his team's impromptu drugs bust, said bloke emerged from the room behind the kitchen looking half dead and very pissed off. The man was short but muscular, blond, and wearing nothing but a pair of boxers. And as he was wearing nothing else, the large not-yet-scar from what looked like a bullet wound on both sides of his shoulder, and the sleek and expensive-looking prosthetic piece replacing the man's right leg up to just above the knee, were both very visible to everyone.
is trying to tell us something, in order to get her murder caught!”
Several minute later, Lestrade notices Sherlock had gone missing.
clever like you John, yes!-" now he turned away from John to look at everyone else around the room. "She's cleverer than you lot and she's dead. Do you see, do you get it? She didn't lose her phone, she never lost it. She planted it on him. When she got out of the car, she knew that she was going to her death. She left the phone in order to lead us to her killer.”
They established that Rachel was Jennifer Wilson stillborn daughter, and Anderson got in a few derogatory quips accusing Sherlock of being a murderer, a psychopath, and sociopath respectively while John was getting dressed. Sherlock was just insisting that it was more than just thinking about her daughter Jennifer Wilson was doing when she died, when John re-emerged, now wearing jeans, boots, a comfortable looking jumper, and his leather jacket. Only Sherlock noticed the gun tucked away at his side, and that paired with him wearing his jacket, meant John was prepared to go
“It narrows it down from just anyone in London!” Sherlock went on ignoring his… boyfriend- whatever, didn't matter in that moment. Focus Lestrade! “It's the first proper lead that we've had!”
“It would be so much easier than worrying about who's got enough money for what,” Sherlock explains clinically. “Besides, isn't that what couples do? We live together, have for some years as even when you were overseas you and I always said you lived wherever I was at the time. I have no intention of leaving you anytime soon, and I know you feel the same. Our only source of income is the consulting- unless you really plan to get a job in a clinic, but even then it hardly matters- so it would make it easier on the clients if they only needed to write one cheque, and easier on us then divvying the payments up every time they did.”
awake.” John said to Sherlock, waving at him a little sarcastically.
“So you do know, about the drugs?” Lestrade asked. He'd figured as much, but it would have really, really sucked to have been the one that break it to the guy his boyfriend used to be a junkie.
“I'm fine,” the detective insisted, noticing a folded envelope on the ground. “There was someone still in there looking for Soo Lin, which means whoever she is, she knows something.”
“Why did you buy that thing?” Sherlock says while they're sitting in a small restaurant,staking out the shop from across the street. The little cat sites on the table, waving innocently at him from next to John's plate of well deserved food.
-----
Uh… keep going straight here.
“What, and I didn't notice it? Me? I didn't notice?”
Sherlock chides himself for forgetting that John is with him, and will be with him from now on while John is doing so. He's been so used to being alone on cases, because even though John always came with him while on leave, a majority of his time the idea of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson together was just an abstract idea, something rare you mostly talked about, but never really saw because John was always overseas. But he’d just been making a big deal in a cab ride over about them being together, and then he'd left John in a hall like an idio- Oh, a dead body in a locked room! How exciting.
And I mean, how was I gonna say no to that?”
“‘Cause you're busy and would have ignored me. I'm not putting my leg back on so unless you wanna carry me, shut up and get back to work,” John ends the discussion with that, smiling at Sherlock’s accidental concern, closing his eyes a burrowing deeper into the duvet.
Sherlock’s phone went off, but as Lestrade had gone about helping search for the pink lady’s phone, he only half heard John and Sherlock’s following conversation, and wouldn't processes that he'd heard it, until much later that night.
“Yeah, but some of the guys wanna take photographs.”
post that read
“What? Yeah, yeah... I-I'm fine.” Sherlock muttered. Anyone paying attention would have seen the way the two were standing just a little
There's a pause once John enters the living room, and Sherlock doesn't have to look up to know that John, despite Sherlock's efforts to re-place everything as it had been, can tell that something's happened, and is searching for the evidence. It's one of first things that every attracted Sherlock to John, and about the only observational skill John has, his ability to sense, practically on instinct, the presence of dangerous people and situations and if only John would put in the effort to perfect, to master, this instinct he would truly be exceptional at it. But as it stands, today is not the day John will pick to prod at the nagging feeling in the back of his mind when he doesn't instantly find any proof of Sherlock's mischief, and before John can say anything, Sherlock says from behind his book “You took your time,” rather disinterestedly.
“Wow,” John said breathlessly. “It really is gone.”
“What do you— Oh!” Sherlock shimmied up the sofa, so their heads rested together. “You’re wondering whether, in the other place, things are going quite so . . .”—he grinned—“. . .
. It had, what,
He let the thought pass. After all, he knew Sherlock preferred it when John tagged along, and even though he griped endlessly about the fanciful storytelling in John’s blog, John knew he read it religiously, and enjoyed it. They’d be out on a case together again soon enough.
No, of course not. John would have noticed.
“Shh. Right through here.”
Dr. Stapleton let out a longsuffering, apologetic breath. “He has to die.”
“Oh! Oh yeah, just, um. Let me get my shoes.” He pushed the notebook under his closed laptop as he stood.

Sherlock lifted himself sharply up on an elbow. “What? Why!”

“You don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“He loves you, Sherlock. Just as you love him. It’s not that complicated.”
this?
Sherlock scowled, skeptical. “Coordinate what? Synchronized jumping jacks? Sticking a fork in the outlet?”
He could smell the Alpha in her. That meant she had not been properly screened or injected with inhibitors, and
“Sherlock’s not only a, um, ‘Alpha on the hunt’”—he cringed, wishing he had a better handle on his new vocabulary—“but he’s also a detective. He works with the police. Would you be willing to talk to him, to tell him the same things you told me?”
It was John’s habit to lower his head and appear smaller, as most Omegas did around Alphas who were not their bond-mates. It was simply a matter of biologically programmed respect. So it surprised Sherlock when, rather than exhibit submissive behaviors, John’s jaw hardened and his shoulders squared. For a moment, Sherlock was transfixed—he’d never seen John look at Mycroft with such an expression void of deference and replaced with . . . what was that? Aggravation? He would have pondered the gall of it a second or two longer, if that same expression hadn’t swung around to land on
“Your place or mine? To watch the fight? They’re broadcasting it on BBC One, BBC World, Alphas On Air—”
Distressed and distracted, he didn’t hear the front door open, or the hurried footsteps on the stairs, or anything at all until suddenly, the open doorway darkened. John’s head snapped up, and he saw Sherlock’s tall and startlingly imposing figure filling the entryway, just a silhouette standing at the mouth of a dark room.
, who have transitioned in some way from one universe to another, something that isn’t so easily solved by
There was a long pause, and it was all John could do to keep himself breathing normally. They were hoping Sherlock would be killed in the fight? Not only that, they were
And John’s whole being was on fire.
Despite knowing how useless it was, she struggled, beat her hands and kicked her legs, but she only managed to get out one scream before the first punch knocked her silent. Then they dragged her down the hallway, asked which bedroom was hers, and threw her inside.
“I didn’t know where else to go!” he cried, trying to hold her more tightly. With her free hand, she tried to swat him away, but he thought she was patting him consolingly.
John kicked in a knee, directly to the man’s groin. Above him, Trevor’s face went wonky and his eyes filled with tears of pain, but he didn’t slacken his grip. So John whammied him again: knee-groin, knee-groin. Trevor cursed and released, and as he moved away, John seized his head, and did it again: knee-nose, knee-nose. The bridge crunched. John walloped him in the ear next with a cupped hand. The air pressure burst his ear drum, and Trevor fell back screaming, giving John time to find his feet.
And once more, they kissed, happily submitting to a universe determined to get its way.
To his right, darkening the doorway, Dr. Stapleton stood like a mad scientist, hair wild and eyes bulging while wearing a white lab coat and pointing an imperious finger at him to put down the vials.
But John’s glass was empty. Sherlock pushed his own closer, and John accepted it gratefully.
His mind was spinning, heady with the fog of affection and devotion he felt for this man. He kissed him. He was so in love, it hurt everywhere, even in his toes, if he didn’t do something about it. He kissed him. A future without Sherlock in it was no future at all, and he would do anything and everything he could to ensure that they stayed side by side. He kissed him. Maybe he hadn’t given any thought to marriage before because he already felt that they were a fixed unit and nothing would change that, and the truth was, nothing

“Blame me. I whisked him away. Neither of us much fancy reporters.”
“I think you need sleep.”
Without thinking, and primarily as a consoling gesture, Sherlock moved a hand to John’s thigh and gave it a kindly pat. “You’re the benevolent one, John, of the two of us. And I rely on that, too . . .”
His phone was in his pocket, set to vibrate at precisely midnight. It would be destroyed in the plunge, but there was nothing for it.
“Good.”
Against their nature, Alphas with bond-mates in hospital had no choice but to leave them there overnight and return home alone, and like any bonded Alpha, Sherlock found such action wholly objectionable. He’d never had to do it before. It had been seven years since he had spent a night in the flat alone. And there was only one reason why it had happened, as every bonded Alpha knew:
“What?”
“No. Nothing.”
“. . . wish I could have you at my side.”
John blinked. Raindrops struck his face, and though it was hard to keep his eyes open, he could see blue sky through broken gray clouds. The downpour was letting up rapidly. By the time he sat up—when had he ended up flat on his back?—it was barely a sprinkle.
“And we’re rolling in five . . . four . . . three . . .”
Maybe it could be.
With a sigh, Sherlock returned to the sitting room. “That’s not my call. You’re the one who jumped.”
“What does that mean?” Sherlock asks, but John's turned away now, so he can't deduce anything other than that John thinks he's being funny.
Sherlock watches John, completely distracted from the case now as only John can do, in favor of deducing the reason behind his boyfriends declaration. It seems an odd time to Sherlock, you see, for John to have said such a thing. They aren't the sort of couple that does so on just any given occasion, or to randomly blurt it out just to fill a silence. They didn't need to, they both knew it perfectly well, and it was senseless to become dependent on hearing the word rather that observing the proof. They only ever said it when the other had gone above and beyond to do something spectacularly romantic, or almost died, or else if they were trying to comfort the other in some way.  Sherlock has done neither of the first two, and he certainly doesn't need comforting, so he wonders about it.
“Good idea.” Lestrade barely notice Sherlock voice had moved towards the stairs as he looked behind a large pile of Russian books in the corner.
“Hmmmm?” John murmurs, a little annoyed, which he knows Sherlock will understand to mean ‘There's a case on, why are you sleeping?’
Did the half naked man just come out to

“I'm not in shock.” he protests.
“And frankly a bloody awful cabbie.” John adds, his voice lighter now as its muffled by Sherlock shirt.
“Donavan don't!” Lestrade snapped. “Get out! In fact, everybody get out, we're done here.”
“I trust John's already explained why you'll need to keep quiet.” Sherlock says, and it's a small relief that they're not pending at this moment.
Lestrade gets swept up in doing his job once the other officers finally show up, that he doesn't actually find Sherlock until much later, when he's been seated in the back of an ambulance and given a bright orange shock blanket. He notes that Watson has snuck back onto the other side of the caution tape, and is talking with Donovan as he approaches Sherlock.
