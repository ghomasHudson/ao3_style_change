It takes him a moment to realize he is afraid. His long fingers shake as they work at the buttons of his black silk shirt, his heart flutters against its cage of bone. Every limb feels hollow with dread, muscle scooped out and replaced with jittery nerves that zip about unrestrained just beneath his skin. His shirt flutters away and he breathes through the anxiety of John’s eyes roving hungrily over his bared torso.
Then John snorted and the dam broke, just as it had when they sat on that couch in Buckingham Palace, Mycroft staring with deep disapproval from the doorway as they dissolved into fits like children who had gotten away with stealing the chocolate biscuits. A few travelers sitting in nearby rows glanced at them; the older business man in a black suit and odd, purple tie with pictures of pie scattered across it smiled because he was reminded of his sons; the young woman dressed several hundred dollars above her paygrade glared at them and pointedly stuffed her earbuds in place; a mother and her young daughter eyed them curiously, the mother landing on amusement while the daughter tugged on her mother’s arm, demanding to know what was so funny.
Surprising John was endlessly entertaining. Almost, if not as, entertaining as a true mystery. It was always an added bonus when the surprise irritated him. Sherlock knew without a single doubt that John would never do anything more than give him a good punch, and that he secretly enjoyed the surprises just as much as Sherlock enjoyed springing them on him.
Sherlock just gave him The Look—the one where he would half roll his eyes and arch his brow as if to silently say really, John, you haven’t learned my methods by now? At first, John desperately wanted to punch him in the face every time he used it, but lately there were a few differences—a crinkle to the corners of his eyes, a slight lift to his lips—and now it just made John laugh and shake his head, yes, of course, how dare he question the great Sherlock Holmes.
that was it, Lucifer was going. He abandoned his whiskey, straightened his jacket, and strode straight toward the man with the sound of Maze’s deep chuckle of approval trailing behind him.
Sherlock snorted. John slid a hand over his eyes and groaned at the floor. Chloe cast them both a glance over her shoulder, then abruptly stepped up to John’s side and leaned in to mock-whisper, “So, is your partner as bad as mine?”
Sure, John had spent the last couple… well, years... carefully burying the stray thoughts of men that had begun cropping up since he moved in with Sherlock, but it had never been so blatant. It had never slithered down his spine to pool, utterly unrepentant, in his pelvis, or closed its tight fist to his lungs until the air rushed out of him.
Dan met them at Chloe’s desk an hour later. “This isn’t the first one,” he said, wincing and tossing down a file of photos and paperwork Chloe knew for a fact she didn’t want to see. She picked it up anyway. “There have been dozens of these murders all across the U.S, and just as many overseas, just in the last week. The Lieutenant just got off the phone with some contact of hers in the U.K, apparently he and a couple of his agents will be coming here to work with us.”
John sighed sadly at the mention of them being together. Genuinely surprised when no one teased him about it. Slightly happy that they didn't, while also hating that they felt bad for him.
"It was how he worded it," John admitted, not wanting to give too much away as he remembered how Moriarty had lost his voice that way.
"I can't believe she's still talking to you after the last case," Anderson commented wistfully, the others who were there during the case hummed in agreement.
A few people frown at Sherlock leaving to read Irene’s texts, more than one of their frowns was out of jealousy.
Mrs Hudson and John huffs at the fact that Sherlock couldn't careless about catching a murderer. But they don't comment, unlike Kitty who mutters a disgusted "Of course," under her breath.
John, Molly and Mrs Hudson all flinch slightly at the sight of Sherlock standing anywhere near a high ledge. John briefly closing his eyes to get the image of
"He explains soon," John replied to Anderson, not wanting to explain or really remembering what happened.
"If they find what Eddie and Bran were smuggling and where the acution is they can back track and find out where their held," Lestrade responded.
A couple people sighed at Sherlock dodging John’s questions, most of them wanting to know for themselves.
Despite having seen Sherlock during his period of doubt, most still found it weird to think about Sherlock being in doubt about his own abilities.
"That really wasn't smart John, what if it was a murderer or something?" Molly chatised, and John just smiled back at her sheepishly.
"... You've got to be kidding me, he called you all the way there just to use your phone?" Lestrade asked.
"Since when has he noticed something like that?" Lestrade asks in shock, not remembering a time that Sherlock ever noticed if someone was wearing lipstick or not, or even being interested in someone like that.
Sadness quickly gave way to anger as Irene dares to insult Sherlock. Though a few of them can’t help but wonder if Sherlock was right or not.
Molly, Lestrade, Mrs Hudson and Anderson all smile in relief when she sends Sherlock the text. Off in the corner, Mycroft sighs, feeling conflicted. On one hand he felt happy that his brother was no longer sad, but on the other he remembered how exactly this particular case ended.
“Does Hound actually mean anything?” Molly questioned curiously. Not that she didn’t believe Sherlock, she just couldn’t understand why it would be so important.
“Where did he put the phone?” Kitty questioned again, no one answered her for only John knew for certain where it was. Yet the others had ideas, they didn’t bother sharing it.
Not for the first time, Mycroft wished that Sherlock wasn’t so smart, so Sherlock wouldn’t accidentally ruin all his plans.
"That's actually pretty clever, mean, but clever," Anderson mused, he wasn't really that surprised, but he still wanted to comment on it.
Kitty gives on-screen Sherlock a look of disgust while the others sigh in sadness at Sherlock's behaviour, but they weren't even slightly surprised.
"I'm suprised that my brother hasn't figured it out, so simple," Mycroft tuts, causing everyone else to roll their eyes at him.
Laughs at Sherlock's words and his false cherriness, it really did look stupid if you truely know Sherlock.
Despite being annoyed at Frankland, they all chuckled in amusement at Frankland calling John, Sherlock’s PA. None of them had thought of John as that, and now they couldn’t think of John as anything else.
Everyone, besides for John who also remembered Henry, blinked in shock at the fact that his older self was in the same woods, seemingly without knowing how he got there.
"Probably something to do with the painting," Anderson deducts and everyone rolls their eyes at him because, duh.
"Anderson thought of it," Once again, Mrs Hudson responded immediantly and her words caused Anderson to shrink in his seat.
Almost everyone winced as Sherlock pointed the harpoon at her. Even though they knew Sherlock wouldn't hit Mrs Hudson, it was still unnerving.
John growled, his eyes narrowing as he sees the two figures, hatred burning in his eyes, a similar reaction happened with Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson, thought Mycroft was less obvious. Molly, and Lestrade all tense up, their eyes filled with distrust, laced with hatred, Anderson had the same reaction as Molly and Lestrade just less feeling. While Donovan was only slightly on guard.
A few people chuckled at John’s joke, though most of them were still curious why Sherlock seemed to care so much about a counter.
"Sherlock, don't you dare get in that car!!!!" Mrs Hudson cried out, like a mother scolding her child.
"I don't get it, why would they bother to cover it up, they obviously saw John, so wouldn't they have seen John take the photo?" Anderson asked.
"Whoever sent that message wanted someone to see it, my brother was trying to figure out who it was for," Mycroft snapped back, really starting to get annoyed at these people.
Mycroft sighed, even if he already knew Sherlock used his badge. It was still annoying and embarrassing that Sherlock had it in the first place.
"My brother, can be an idiot sometimes," Mycroft agreed, disappointment filling his voice. Everyone else muttered words of agreement, even Donovan, though quieter and less passionate, was yelling at the past Sherlock.
“In case you haven’t noticed, Sherlock is a very private person, and it didn’t exactly come up,” John answered, his tone clipped.
"Don't worry Mrs Hudson, the nightmares stopped after I met Sherlock," John's voice went from happy to sad as he remembered his best friends death.
Sighs of relief filled the room, as the alarm was finally switched off. Everyone slowly started to relax fully at the fact that they seemed to have gotten away with it.
"You're the girl that caused wrote those articles about the f-" Donovan paused as all the glares that were thrown her way was ten times harder, all of them not wanting her to finish anything about it, especially not with their present company. "Sherlock," Donovan finished, hissing the word out with disgust. Kitty nods not knowing what else to say as John seethes in anger.
"You would assume that he only transmitted it when Henry was out there, so not a lot of people, if any, would have caught it," Mycroft explained.
“Since then,” Lestrade answered with a grin. “I helped in the rest of the investigation,” He added when Anderson gave him a look.
Lestrade sighs, as he runs a hand through his hair. He couldn't believe it, he just couldn't. Even if there were so many facts, he still couldn't believe that Sherlock had made everything up, something didn't add up. Lestrade sighs as Anderson opens his mouth but before he can speak, all their visions turn pure white.
John smiled ever so slightly, even if it had annoyed him whenever Sherlock did it. It still was such a Sherlock thing.
“Who would want to go to this town for a vacation?” Molly questioned with a frown. “You’re not actually on vacation, are you?” Molly guessed after a few seconds of thought.
"What? It's a perfectly reasonable conclusion," Malcroft responds, his chin held up high. Everyone else rolls their eyes at him when they remember
"That's pretty impressive," Lestrade praised, causing John to smile slightly. Proud of his own abilities. Even if they did look terrible beside Sherlock.
"You," John growled, lunging out of his seat, his hands curled into fists, aimed right at Moriarty's face. But before he can even get close, he hits something an bounces back, landing on his ass.
“He’s figuring someone out, isn’t he?” Anderson questioned curiously, a grin finally gracing his lips.
“Playing dumb doesn’t really suit Sherlock,” Anderson couldn’t help but comment. Donovan chuckled in agreement.
"Why does Sherlock do anything," Molly adds, though her words somehow answers Anderson's question as no one says anything else.
"Poor Sherlock," Mrs Hudson and Molly both mutter. Though the older of the two says it a bit louder.
Anderson couldn’t quite help but grin, glad that he wasn’t the only person Sherlock would suddenly kick out of the open so he could focus better.
"Could it be? Could the great Sherlock Holmes be jealous?" Molly teases lightly, pushing away the sadness that her crush would probably never like her back, though she had accpected that fact a long time ago.
The Yarders, Molly and John all laugh at Sherlock's joke. Meanwhile, Kitty wondered how she could get connections like that.
"Please tell me you don't get into that car, and instead walk away like a normal person with any common sense!" Lestrade shouts and the other Yarders hum in agreement. John ducks his head sheepishly.
"I think he's trying to protect you by keeping you out," Anderson said, always pointing out the obvious. John huffs slightly shaking his head slightly.
A few people snorted at Sherlock adding 'Sir'. Their minds going back to when Sherlock corrected the prisoners' language back in 'The Great Game'.
“Why would they bother coming back? Especially with their leader in prison and the fact that Mrs Hudson wasn’t their actual target,” John defended.
“I had more important things to worry about, like Sherlock dazed on the floor,” John defended himself.
"Why are you so shocked?" Donovan questions. "Of course the freak had mutiple theories already." And if the words 'the freak' have a little hint of fondness, well no one pointed that out.
“Why don’t you know?” Kitty questioned, having thought that those two knew everything about each other.
Mycroft sighs at the sight of Sherlock rescuing Irene, knowing full well that this means that she wasn’t dead.
“Honestly, I’m just surprised that Sherlock knew that reference,” Anderson commented, not to be mean, just stating a fact.
“I can’t believe you would ever actually think that would ever actually work,” Lestrade commented, Sherlock never did what he was told.
"It was obvious before all you have to do is look," annoyed glares were thrown at Mycroft because of his words.
“Well, don’t we just know that the Doctor had taken Bluebell from her daughter's hutch, she could have just taken Bluebell back to the lab,” Molly pointed out.
"That sucks," Donovan murmured, knowing how terrible it was to find out that the guy you were with was cheating on you or using you to cheat with someone else.
"I think he was going the other way, and look for books they both have and then go from their," John replied, trying to think which way would be faster.
"Are you really still trying to maintain the facade?" Donovan questioned in confusion. "They obviously know you're lying,"
No one was surprised at the confused look on Sherlock’s face, though it did elicit some sympathy from John and Molly.
"I'm surprised he didn't get it from something like how he walked," Lestrade jokes, and Molly nodded, feeling better about herself.
"The poor boy, to have his whole life ruined just so he could be kept quiet," Mrs Hudson muttered mourningful.
Everyone’s eyes, except for Moriarty, turned murderous at the thought of Neilson torturing Mrs Hudson.
"Is he really going to go after the murderer alone?" Molly asks, though she pretty much already knew the answer.
Before anyone could say anything further, whether that was to comfort John or to interrogate him about his feelings, the tv suddenly sprang to life. A fact to which John was thankful for, as he continued to struggle to put himself together after his minor breakdown.
Any amount of cheerfulness was lost as Sherlock talked about love. The small smile appearing on John’s face disappearing at the mention of Sherlock not believing in love.
"That poor woman," Mrs Hudson mumured, everyone felt sick staring at the crying woman. Why would anyone do this just for a game? Kitty stared over at her, but wisely kept her mouth shut.
Molly sighs in annoyance at them, shaking her head at the two. Wondering how someone so smart could say something so dumb.
Mrs Hudson sighs sadly at seeing Kate lying limp, having a feeling that there would be little chance that those Americans had left her alive.
"What's Sherlock looking at?" Anderson questioned worriedly. No one answered him. Which only increased his and everyone else's worry.
"Well of course Sherlock knows that theres a suitcase, I mean the freak is behind it all," Donovan's use of the word Sherlock, caused a soft smile to come to the Yarders only to harden once again when she said freak.
"This is just speculation and nothing more than rumours to attract tourists," Mycroft assured her, despite the fact that he had a fair guess that this case would contradict him. Much to his annoyance.
"He had just got me arrested!" John defended himself though their was a ghost of a smile on his lips.
"And why would anyone want the freak at their restraunt," Donovan muttered. Earning a slight glare from Anderson, who was the only one who heard.
A few people sigh in relief, especially Mrs Hudson and those who had had the same train of thought as her.
"Who the hell is that? And what is she doing," Donovan's voice was raised, not shouting loud but defiently not normally talk, a little fear crepping into her voice.
“No clue, but I think it’s like the words,” Donovan replied. “You know, so it’s easier to follow what they’re saying,”
The Yarders and Mycroft all sigh as they confirm that Sherlock wasn’t just going to let Neilson get arrested without getting revenge first.
"What if someone had just found the phone and rang the person to find out who's phone it is," Molly asks, her head tiltied to the side.
"Maybe because it's not true!" John hissed, and open his mouth to speak. But was cut off by Mycroft.
Even though no one speaks, everyone thinks that that sounded exactly like something Sherlock would do.
Molly was the first to move closer to the food. Hunger getting the better of her. "Do you really think that it's safe to eat?" Molly asks curiously. When all she gets are shrugs Molly sighs but starts filling her plate. Gingerly, she takes a bit out of some corn, and she doesn't immediantly die she sits back down and starts eating.
A few people jump as they spot something moving outside. Now everyone definitely felt like they were in a horror movie. A few mentally wishing that Harry would either run or look behind him.
Kitty's nose scrunched up in disgust at Sherlock's delight at this situation. While the others, for what seemed like the hundredth time sighed in disappointment at Sherlock's behaviour but not surprised.
"Only because it was repeated over and over and over!" Anderson argued, "At least Sherlock figured it out on his own,"
“What is with Sherlock and sniffing things?” Donovan questioned, and to John’s surprise, there wasn’t any disgust in her tone, just simply curoursity.
Despite it just being in a cage covered by a sheet, everyone was still relieved that John had managed to get to somewhat safety.
“Yep,” John answered, slightly annoyed that his friend only really acted nice when he wanted something.
John frowns slightly as he stares at his old friend. If he didn't know any better than he would think that Mike had a crush on Sherlock by the way he looked at him.
"Yeah but, Sherlock doesn't get paid for helping the infrequent cases from the officers, and the small cases he does get paid for, I don't help with very much," John explains.
"So that's what the harpoon was for," Anderson murmured to himself. Not bothering to even think about asking how that helped solve his last case.
"Why are you getting so angry?" Kitty questioned, John had always been Sherlock's fan. Sherlock had just 'solved' a case, she couldn't understand why John wasn't congratulating him. John shots her an annoyed look, but doesn't respond, mostly out of spite.
Everyone but Donovan, Mycroft and John frown at the man, Donovan because she had a smirk glad that someone was listening to her warning, Mycroft cause he's like a robot and John who chuckled slightly, remembering him. Everyone else's glares turned confused as they heard John's light chuckle.
"You know he did change after you came into his life," Mycroft piped up suddenly, John frowns over at the older Holmes brother in confusion. "Believe or not, but my brother became kinder, more human after meeting you," There was a hint of graditude in his voice that had John smiling slightly.
"Where did he get that can?" Anderson asked, leaning forward to look at it more. "Is that the same paint that was used in the last case?"
“You have to admit that it’s kind of ironic that the two have switched positions,” Donovan couldn’t help but point out, trying to feel a little bit better about everything.
"That's dramatic, but sadly true, or at least until John came along," Lestrade's voice gets quieter and more thoughtful the more he speaks.
They all watch as the screen turns black, after another case had closed. John got up and got some tea for himself and Mrs. Hudson, while the Yarders all got some food. After everyone had sat back down words once again appeared on the screen.
“Not that we know of,” Mrs Hudson replied. As John glowered in his seat, still kind of annoyed that he doesn’t know everything about Sherlock.
"Maybe we'll finally be able to find out how the freak texts everyone at once," Donovan announces and John glared heavily at her because of that annoying nickname she insists on using.
“What’s going on?” Mrs Hudson questioned worriedly, looking over at John to make sure that he really was okay. John opened his mouth to explain, only to be able to say nothing. Which only increased everyone’s worry.
“I didn’t know he actually composed,” Donovan mused quietly. She had known that Sherlock liked to play the violin, but she had no idea that he wrote as well.
“What was it?” Kitty questioned curiously, looking over at John. John glances over at her before shrugging. After all if he didn’t say anything when Molly asked, he certainly wasn’t going to do it when Kitty does.
"Your just saying that because your in love with the freak," Donovan snaps back. Everyone glares at her.
"That's the brother isn't it?" Donovan asked, her voice sharp as she remembered how he had killed his own sister, no one replies but then again, no one needed to.
A couple people, mainly, John, Molly, Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson all snicker at Sebastian's annoyed look.
"That's Sherlock's plan?" Anderson questioned in shock, having expected something much more sophisticated as the plan.
John finally lets go of Mrs Hudson at the proof that she was okay. Mrs Hudson smiles at John, though when he turns to look back at the screen, she subtly rubs her arm.
"Wait what?" Molly questions, as the others all blink shock. Because how the hell did he get that from a corpse?
"He's got a point John, how do you say spectacularly ignorant in a nice way?" Lestrade teases causing John to frown slightly.
"His worried about what his sister thinks? Not about the fact that he just killed a guy or that his going to prison," Anderson couldn't help but comment.
"We've already gone over it, he's not faking." Anderson snapps back before turning back around to the screen. Donovan frowns over at him before shrugging it off.
"I think I'm going to be sick," Kitty commented quietly, covering her mouth in horror. No one else seemed the slightest bit sick. Mostly because they had faced much worse or were just used to Sherlock's experiments by now.
"You know, I'm starting to think that the false painting has something to do with supernovas," Donovan mutters as she hears the narrator speak that same sentence once again.
Mrs Hudson squeezes John's hand tighter and Molly looks over at her friend. As if making sure he was really there.
Anderson, Donovan and Kitty can't help but blink in surprise as they stared at Sherlock. He went on a fan site. They knew that it was for a case but still, it was surprising in a funny kind of way.
A few people sighed, while the others leaned forward, interested to know how he managed to get out of it.
"I had to make sure, but I don't exactly how they could of missed something that important." Lestrade says, almost apologetic towards John.
Laughter fills the room at the inappropriately timed text alert, making everyone on the screen laugh in shock.
"Why does he need an assistant, we never did find that out," Anderson mutters and John frowns, remembering something Sherlock had said to him long ago.
"Worried about your boyfriend?" Lestrade teased, John instantly becomes slightly flustered as he shouted an unintelligible response.
"I kind of feel sorry for the other passengers on the tube," Donovan added with a wince, wondering how terrified they had been of Sherlock.
A few people blinked in shock, not actually expecting that, though then they realised how petty Sherlock could be, and figured it wasn’t that surprising.
“That would be annoying, not being able to talk about the things that you do,” Donovan mused, knowing that she would hate to have keep the biggest achievements of her career a secret.
"Why is there always someone sleeping with their worker in these things?" Lestrade asks fully expecting the silence that followed.
"What could possibly be so remarkable about Johns hand?" Donovan asked, and like half a million other times, no one answers the question.
A few people snort at John still being in denial after all this time. Much to the doctor’s annoyance.
“Yes, this is definitely a horror movie,” Donovan agreed, just slightly terrified. As she never did well with those types of movies.
John’s eyes narrow, almost to slits as he glares at Sherlock. An angry and sickening feeling welling up inside of him.
"There's more than one way to open a door without a key," Moriarty mused quietly. Though everyone heard. John glared over at him.
A couple of people, namely Anderson and Donovan, all frown in shock when Sherlock doesn't preen at the complement like usual.
Everyone but Mycroft chuckles slightly. Well when I say everything, I mean everyone that you can see clearly as the shadows surrounding the shadowy figure are also taking away the sound.
"I hate to aree with you," Mrs Hudson mutters, sending a glare at Kitty, "But your right, that poor woman," Kitty frowned over at her.
John huffs at that, silently wondering if all this time he had just been a fill in for that blasted skull or someone of actual importance to Sherlock. John is pulled out of his thoughts as he hears the Yarders soft chuckles at Sherlock's words.
"What was that?" Anderson questions curiously. Turning to stare at John who shrugs. Just because John knows what it was, doesn't mean he understands it at all.
Somehow everyone got even more worried when Major Barrymore appeared. Especially as he seemed furious.
“Is Sherlock really going to fight him?” Donovan questioned. “Can he even fight?” She added, not remembering Sherlock ever fighting.
Laughter filled the room, dissipating any tension that still lingered from everything that had been going on.
"JOHN!" Molly can't help but yell, her eyes flickering back to John as if trying to reassure herself that John was safe.
"Because I got drugged as well without anyone knowing it," Lestrade answers, semi happy he didn't get his voice taken away from him for answering it.
“Hey!” Mrs Hudson shouted, as everyone, well everyone but Moriarty, glared at the screen. With Mycroft and Kitty’s being a little more subtle, but they still glared.
"Sherlock never trusted any of the police members," Lestrade answered, with a slight glare towards Donavan and Anderson. It was people like them that made it hard for Sherlock to trust them completely.
"When did he do that?" Anderson questions in shock. Everyone shrugs, no one having an answer for him.
"And if he had just called the police or something, he would have gotten a much lesser sentence," Lestrade murmurs.
"If Sherlock really created this case, why would he be so confused about to why the painting is a fake?" John couldn't help but point out.
Kitty huffed, annoyed at how quickly Sherlock had managed to win him over. Pushing away her own doubts in the process.
The other's stretched got up and started stretching feeling quite cramped from sitting down for so long.
"He's a freak, who knows why he does anything." Donovan retorted. "Besides, you didn't really know him at all, if he managed to create all these cases."
"I thought she actually cared about Sherlock?” Donovan questioned sadly. Even if she liked Sherlock, she still knew how hard it was to be rejected by someone you cared about.
"Yes because that would help if actually bothered to look there," Anderson commented, sarcasticasm dripping from his voice.
"No," John confirmed, smiling slightly that Donovan was finally beginning to see. While Kitty huffed, still not convinced.
Lestrade winces that he hadn't even noticed anything wrong with Sherlock. He had thought he knew the late Holmes better.
"Because of Mycroft, he creeped me out, no offense" John replied, and Mycroft nodded ever so slightly.
"How does he always get what he wants?" Anderson asks curiously, no spite laced his words, just harmless curiousty.
"You know, times like these just proves it. That Sherlock actually does have a heart," Lestrade jokes, John snorts, but none the less hums in agreement.
At the sight of all the guns, a few people get slightly worried, after all, what was there to stop the soldiers from shooting Sherlock and John when they find out that the two aren't who they saw they are.
"Freak," Donovan muttered for the umptith time, causing John to once again glare at her as his fists tighten. John shifts slightly, though before he can lunge at Donovan, chains wrap around his wrists, keeping him in place.
"Forgive me, please" Mycroft translated after half the people around him gave Mycroft a pleading look.
"You know, I'm suprised it took my little brother so long to figure it out, I mean it's was so obvious," Mycroft comment absetmindedly.
Mycroft frowned as he stared at Irene. Never actually believing that she could have fallen for her brother.
Mrs Hudson smiled warmly as John walked up to her. His eyes glazed over from the tears he was desperately trying to keep in. Black bags hung under his eyes, dried tear tracks streaking through them. John sniffled slightly before nodding over to the gate of the cemetery. While John tried to keep himself together, to remain tough, Mrs Hudson let her emotions show, though she didn't cry. Together they walked away, leaving the new shiny black tombstone behind, Sherlock's gravestone.
"Why does Sherlock think that 'Syphilis and Local Contagious disorders' is a book that everyone has?" Anderson asks, no one, not even Mycroft could respond to that.
A sharp intake of breath is heard from everyone but Mycroft and John, as they all stared up at the screen in shock. Even Mycroft looked a little shocked as he reflected back on his relationship with his brother, wondering if Sherlock would ever do something like that.
"Did he really think anyone would believe him? He literally just confessed to it," Lestrade pointed out.
A couple people flinch at the sound of the arrow being realised, and espically Mrs Hudson and Molly gasp.
Everyonce winced as Frankland completely destroyed John’s efforts to try and figure out what was happening. A few others started to glare at him as well.
"Sherlock never needs any incentive," Molly points out a small on her face as she watches the screen.
"Of course your a freak just like him," Donovan muttered, even though I'm pretty sure she'd already said something like that before.
"What?!" Almost everyone shouted at once. Only John and Mycroft weren't confused by Sherlock's statement. Though neither bothered to inform the others, figuring it would show Sherlock quickly explaining.
"You just had to mention his cheekbones didn't you?" Lestrade can't help but tease. Glad when John just flushes and doesn't get angry at him.
was looking for the murderer but she probably thought he was," Anderson replied, stressing the word Sherlock with a pointed look.
Almost everyone gaped at the screen. None of them thought even for a second that Sherlock would actually call the police anytime soon.
"Why is he taking the case?" Anderson questioned in shock. Feeling a little bit of whiplash from how quickly Sherlock just accepted.
"Does he really have that much faith in us?" Lestrade asks, once again shocked by Sherlock, but this time in a different way.
"And they say the English are polite!" Mycroft once again though this time his voice is slightly sharp.
As they reached the road, a black fancy car pulled in front of them. It's windows tinted black to stop intruders from peering in, and a pretty girl stepped out of the car, from the passenger's door. John sighed in annoyance at the sight. "I'm not going with you, I don't want anything to do with him." John all but growled as anger replaced the annoyance, after all, it was his fault. If he hadn't of sold out his own brother for information, Moriarty never would have been able to pull it off and John didn't care what anybody said, Sherlock was not a fraud.
"How did you know that?" Kitty questions in shock. John sent her an annoyed look, not wanting to answer that, not because of the question but because of the annoying person asking it.
A few snorted at John agreeing to help Sherlock only because of how beautiful the therapist was. Though Mrs. Hudson shakes her head at him.
A few people sighed, sad that John was leaving. As they refused to believe that Sherlock actually meant that.
"He was being strangled and worrying for his life at the same time!" Anderson snapped back. Donovan rolled her eyes but didn't bother arguing.
"Why would anyone go out of their way like he has, just for a set of pawprints?" Molly questioned curiously. Not understanding what the big deal about the prints were. No one answered her.
The screen turned blank after Sherlock and Watson had walked off screen. Everyone waited for five minutes, not that they were counting, for the screen to turn back on. When it didn't turn back on they started moving around. Anderson moved closer to where the others were sitting and away from Donovan. Which made said Sergant frown after him.
"Miss Riley, if, as you believe, Sherlock is behind everything, wouldn't that make him the killer of Carl Powers, which happened when Sherlock was a kid, who Sherlock only knew after Carl had died," Mycroft stated, Kitty frowned in response. Donovan, sitting off to the side listened quietly. Her opnions moving slightly at the realisation.
"You know, fishing would be extrememly boring compared to working with Sherlock," Molly pointed out.
“Go Sherlock!” Anderson couldn’t help but yell out. Causing John to grin slightly at Anderson fully being on Team Sherlock, despite how much he used to hate Sherlock.
A few people laugh at the deductions Sherlock made about John, while the other’s laugh at the resigned annoyance on John’s face.
Everyone, espically John who bows his head afterwards, flinches at the scene in front of them. Without speaking, Mrs Hudson and Molly hugged John as Mr Lestrade squeezes his shoulder.
"I-I had to help Sherlock," John answered sheepishly feeling guilty, espically after seeing Soo Lin's face.
"What do you think she saw?" Molly asked curiously, and everyone, even Mycroft though he was probably just following the crowd, looked over at John.
Scrunching her face up in revolution, Kitty shakes her head at the man on the screen. She couldn't understand why everyone was so calm about this, simply shaking their heads and not getting mad. Her eyes flicker to Moriarty, hoping to see someone else disgusted, but the male was smirking. Kitty frowned at him before turning away.
"Just a little bit dramatic?" Donovan muttered sarcastically, rolling her eyes at the screen. Not believing that something supernatural was at play for a second.
Those who were on Team Sherlock, glared at the mere mention of Moriarty, because of course he is brought up.
Kitty hisses in disgust, not understanding how these people could support Sherlock. Everyone else sighs at Sherlock's behaviour.
"I don't think that's the point, Sherlock," Mrs Hudson sighs, but no one in the room is surprised that Sherlock focus on the case and not on the people dead.
"Yes, who are are you?" Mycroft asks, or more like demands. The shadow figure didn't move, or speak. Instead the words on the screen changed, much to everyone's surprise.
A few people frowned, worried about Sherlock going off on his own after what happened last time, and well, every time they’ve seen anyone go into the Moor.
Despite everyone being tense, a few still chuckled at John taking charge. Especially since he looked so proud of himself.
"Aren't you always?" Lestrade teases and Anderson huffs, but smiles a bitter sweet smile as he remembers what Sherlcok used to say.
"Umm... I would say the next big case, which I'm guessing are just cases that involve Moriarty, would be The Blind Banker," John replied after a second or two in thought.
“Were they actually in the room?” Mrs Hudson questions curiously, figuring that if it was that easy then they wouldn’t be watching it.
"John, hurry up," Molly and like half of the people watching muttered, trying to urge the docter to run faster.
A couple people chuckle slightly, shaking their head as John frowns, silently urging his past self to go looking for Sherlock. Even if it would do nothing.
John huffed quietly to himself at the continuous mention of him and Sherlock being interested in the other.
"He really is a freak, what's with him sniffing everything anyway?" Donovan asks, and just like every other time that she has opened her mouth, John glares at her.
"Do you think who ever's folding the paper is this Shan person?" Molly asks as they all stare, kinda scared, at the screen. John stiffens slightly at her words, finally realising who it is but doesn't say anything, no one else replies but a couple of people hum in agreement.
"Freaks probably just pretending to be oblivious," Donovan muttered causing everyone else to glare over at her.
A few people frowned at Sherlock’s words, after all he was, sentiment wasn’t in the losing side, sometimes it was the only reason the winning side wins.
"What's going on?" Molly asked curiously as they at the long line of patients. John winces slightly fully realising what time this is. But doesn't respond, to embrassed, besides she'll find out.
A few people stared at the screen in shock. Though the more they thought about it, the more it kind of made sense. Behind everyone, Moriarty smirked to himself.
"Wait, is what happened last night, the part that was shown at the very start of this case?" Anderson questioned curiously. "With him being in the woods as a grownup?" He added.
"Fine," He muttered and together the three of them stepped into the back seats, Mrs Hudson in the middle as the girl got back into the front. But before the car could start; Mrs Hudson, John and Mycroft's vision turned white until it was the only thing they could see.
Everyone but John's eyes widen at Sherlock being there. Even Mycroft was surprised that his baby brother had followed John.
“How can Sherlock not know your coffee order?” Anderson questioned in shock. Even if Sherlock deleted information he didn’t need, he would still have gotten that information again and again. “He did it on purpose?” Anderson guessed after a look from John. Said male nodded in annoyance.
"Hey is that what this girl, Soo Lin saw at the start of this, memory?" Molly asks curiously. A couple people hum in response but no one bothers to respond probably.
Everyone, bar Kitty and Moriarity glared at Irene typing on the screen. “Who is she texting?” Anderson questioned curiously. Though no one needed to answer as he caught sight of Moriarty smirking to himself.
was the one behind everything, so of course he has the cans," Kitty retorted, disgust filling her voice as she said Sherlock's name.
A lot of people started panicking as they saw John panicking. Seeing the usually collected doctor freaking out just made everything even worse.
“I forgot how weird that was,” Lestrade muttered, frowning at the white words appearing on the screen once again.
"Hey Greg," John greeted, his eyes flickering between the other two newcomers but he doesn't bother greeting them.
“Why is it showing Irene’s death?” Kitty questioned curiously as Mycroft and John leaned forward in their seats.
"Probably about what his about to get me to send," John finally answered, cauisng everyone to get more confused at which he waved them off.
"Wow, someone else who doesn't care about Sherlock's weird outbursts," Donovan mused, though unlike before, there was no bitterness or disgust in her voice.
A few people silently prayed that Sherlock and John would get there quickly. Worried about what Henry would do, and what could happen to him.
"Yes because you can totally catch that bad of a cold in the span of two seconds," Donovan retorted sarcastically causing John to sink into his seat, cursing his younger, stupider self.
"You heard Andy didn't you? Her work is her life, her family, plus she probably knows that no matter where she goes they'll find her so whats the point in running?" Molly replies to the more or less rhetorical question.
The officers, all snort as John answers for Sherlock, thinking that they really are a lot like a couple.
John smiled slightly at the fact that the two Yarders had none of their usual disgust or hatred in their voices when talking about Sherlock. And that Donovan called Sherlock, Sherlock and not 'freak'.
"You know I was wondering, if what that word would be, I mean how can you threathen someone with only one word," Anderson commented, a couple people laugh quietly but in the end they all, even Mycroft had to agree.
"Maybe because you are the killer, or at least the mastermind," Donovan hissed, glaring at the screen and getting a lot of glares in return.
“I can’t just help my baby brother?” Mycroft questioned. Almost everyone looked at each other in disbelief.
"But he's not real, just something the freak made up so he could make himself look good." She was completely and utterly ignored.
"You know, if I didn't know Sherlock, I would think he was actually embrassed," Lestrade muses, as he stares at Sherlock.
"You know, for not being a housekeeper, you have got to be the one in the world," Molly comments, John instantly voices his agreements causing Mrs. Hudson to blush slightly with all the praise.
"Miss Riley, if my brother really was the master mind behind all this, then why would he set up a meeting without any other witnesses?" Mycroft questioned in that tone reserved espically for idiots.
"Please tell them you actually knew that it wasn't an accident and you were just humoring Sherlock," Donovan pressed. Lestrade shrugs.
John huffs as his friends send him amused and teasing looks. Though Lestrade looked almost like he understood John's joy.
Sherlock checking his watch just made everyone even more anxious as they focused more on the amount of time that had passed.
"That's why he doesn't eat?" Lestgrade asks in shock, only knowing that Sherlock doesn't eat while working.
"Wait, there actually are mines there?" Molly questioned in shock. Having thought that the minefields were just fake.
"HEY!" The Yarders call out, but deep down, some deeper than the others (*cough*Sally*cough*) can't help but agree at his words.
“It’s alright, I figured it would happen,” Mycroft admitted. He did know his brother, and he figured that he would want to keep something from the case file.
"Sherlock's not going to believe that," Molly whispered. Thinking back to the times Sherlock had dismissed anything he couldn't see or know about with tangible proof.
Gasps fill the room, and Mrs. Hudson and Molly both cover their mouths at they stare at Soo Lin's limp body.
"What's he talking about?" Kitty, ever the reporter asked. Mycroft smirks over at her but doesn't speak, no one else bothering to help her.
"My brother hates working for me, no matter the consequences." Mycroft sighed as he spoke, shaking his head.
Everyone sighs, feeling sorry for Molly when Sherlock rounds on her, wondering why he could never seem to stop.
“I didn’t think he would have kept them all,” Anderson muttered quietly to himself as Sherlock started scrolling through all the texts.
Before any of them, even Mycroft, could figure out who the new people would be, a bright light flashes from in the room, and as it disappeared it showed two figures sitting the chairs, furthest from everyone.
Any and all anger anyone (namely John) felt at Mycroft yelling at Sherlock was gone as he genuinely apologized.
A few people chuckle at John’s muttered thank you, including John, who shakes his head at his past self.
"NOOOOO!!!!" The more compasionate, people watching all scream out in shock, besides for John, who was there.
"That's Sherlock, he never did have any patience," John replied wistfully, his voice soft more like he was looking fondly back on old meomeries then having a conversation.
"You deserve better," Lestrade commented awkwardly. Feeling weird seeing the on-screen her so angry.
The Yarders, Molly, Mrs Hudson and John can't help but smile, because Sherlock realy did have a heart.
"Oh thank god, for a second I thought he was actually going to drink from it," Molly breathed a sigh of relief, filling ever so slightly silly when no one responded.
"Don't worry, he stopped doing it as much, he was probably just used to being by himself," John added, but not before a glare is thrown at Donovan.
"Oh, you have no idea" John muttered remembering all the weird and stupid things Sherlock did when he was bored.
"That's what's happening to that Henry, isn't it?" Mrs Hudson questioned, concern filling her voice.
“Couldn’t you have helped Mrs Hudson upstairs as well?” Lestrade questions, though he had a feeling he knew the real reason why Sherlock wanted them downstairs.
"That's probably because they normally are," Anderson pointed out, Mycroft tuttered shaking his head slightly but not actually speaking.
Lestrade frowns as he watches it, silently wishing he had asked for Sherlock's help sooner to stop so many people from dying, but he probably wouldn't have even taken the case.
"Why are you going to Baskerville?" Anderson questioned. "Or better yet, how do you plan on getting into it?"
“His ‘mind palace’?” Donovan questioned curiously, never having heard Sherlock mention anything like it.
A grin formed on Lestrade’s face at Sherlock making sure that the men actually left, he knew that Sherlock could look after himself, but he was still glad.
"Maybe because we are watching it on a screen, while John had to actually live it and focus on other stuff, like not getting caught," Anderson responded just as snidely, glaring over at Kitty.
Everyone had kinda stopped laughing at John only to start laughing even harder, making John squirm in his seat yet again.
Everyone sighs before taking a seat. John sat in a chair that looked a lot like his armchair in the flat. Mrs Hudson sat next to John. Anderson and Donovan sat on the bean bags. Mycroft sat the closest to the shadowy figure, sitting with perfect posture. Both Lestrade and Molly claimed the couch. They all settled down as the black screen changed to reveal....
"That wasn't mean," Lestrade mused to himself. Wondering why Sherlock's explanations were always rude in some way to him and his team. Though he figured that it usually had to do with his team being rude to him first.
"Why do we have to watch Sherlock's cases, he was behind them all so what's the point!" Donovan said, not letting the chance to belittle the so called 'freak' slip by.
“Sherlock has been miserable thinking she was dead, why wouldn’t I want Sherlock to know that she was alive?” John snapped back at her.
"Are you always the damsel in distress John?" Mycroft asks, almost teasingly, which has to be impossible and most likely imagined.
"You seem sure that they would accept your case," Kitty starts, "Sherlock refused, twice, he doesn't strike me as the kind of man who changes his minds," She adds.
"Mike, he was the one who introduced me to Sherlock," John answers, a faint smile adorning his face. All the other's looked shock in response to the ex-soldiers words. Beside Molly because she was there, kinda, and Mycroft cause his just creepy like that.
"What's so bad about Cluedo?" Anderson questioned, causing John, Mrs Hudson and Mycroft to all huff and shake their heads in varying degrees of annoyance.
“You’re not being silly,” Molly chided, sending a glare over at Mrs Hudson. “It’s a perfectly reasonable response,” She added in a no-nonse tone that no one thought she had.
"Why is he in a different shirt?" Donavan questioned, no one answered her. Mostly because a lot of them hadn't even noticed. Anderson squinted at the image of Sherlock before gasping in shock.
"Yeah, why?" John questioned, frowning over at him in confusion. After all, ever since this had started, Anderson hadn't doubted Sherlock before.
"Sherlock looks like hee's going to kiss you," Molly comments, almost wistfully, her words causing John to blush.
"Is he actually concerned or just concentrating?" Anderson couldn't help but question, his tone not accusing but just confused. Everyone narrows their eyes at Sherlock as they try it figure out. No one had an answer by the time that the next scene plays.
“What did Sherlock offer you to help him?” Lestrade questions, not remembering anyone actually telling him about it.
"I feel so sorry for Sarah, having to be a third wheel, on her own date," Mrs Hudson teases causing John to grumble in annoyance.
“Hey!” Molly and John snapped in annoyance. The Yarders all glared at Mycroft, who at least had the common decency to look ashamed at his previous actions.
“Why didn’t you detain or question Sherlock further?” Kitty questioned, though maybe, just maybe, a small part of her was glad that Lestrade didn’t.
"If only I had looked at the writing," John murmed quietly, though almost everyone heard him if the confused looks thrown his way was anything to go by, not that John took any notice.
Everyone chuckles slightly, either it be at Mrs Hudson's repeated implication or John's face it doesn't matter.
“Wow, who knew they could be so deadly,” Donovan joked slightly, though it was kind of ruined by the shock in her voice.
Everyone with a sense of humor, besides for Lestrade who frowns and John who looks kind of embarrassed, laughs at the annoyed looks on both of their faces.
"Hey were are the little white words?!" Anderson exclaims. He had been looking forward to see Sherlock's thinking pattern again.
“Because if Sherlock lost his temper, then it had to be for a good reason,” Lestrade defended himself. “And it was,” He added nodding to the screen.
Everyone except for John, Mycroft and Mrs Hudson frowned, curious as to why Sherlock was so angry and irritated. More so than usual, anyway.
“Oh my god,” Molly gasped in shock as she realised that the passengers were dead. Her eyes were wide in shock, as the others echoed her sentiment.
Only John didn't show any surprise at Sherlock, the male instead, tensing, his previous outburst coming back to mind. Only when no one made a single comment about it, did he relax.
Mycroft frowned at the story, but didn’t bother reacting otherwise, figuring that the damage had already been done.
"No, John and Sherlock were made for each other," Lestrade announces, sending a teasing look over to a blushing and annoyed looking John.
Everyone chuckles at the pair. "I can't believe you expected Sherlock to actually say yes," Lestrade commented, John huffed slightly.
"What did the wall ever do to him?" Anderson joked, causing everyone but the two male M's to laugh. Even Kitty smiled slightly.
A few people huff while Kitty narrows her eyes in confusion. And Donovan just so happens to glance back in time to see Moriarty smirk proudly as he watched the screen.
“Oh, that actually makes so much sense,” Anderson commented, feeling slightly better as Sherlock finally explained what was happening.
"Why does she want to finish her work? Why not run an save her life?" Anderson wondered aloud, slightly glancing backwards just to see if they had an answer.
Everyone laughs at the past John, expect the present John who shuffled in his seat, looking extremely uncomfortable and blushing.
"Does he really know the lottery numbers?" Anderson questioned in shock, frowning as he tried to figure it out.
"High functioning sociopath," Anderson, John, Lestrade, Molly and Mrs Hudson almost immediantly correct her, speaking in unsion, give or a take a couple seconds.
And everyone proceeds to try and tear their hair out and scream profanities as Sherlock goes against their wishes.
John, Molly, Mrs Hudson, Mycroft, Lestrade and Anderson all glare at the Mycroft on screen and off. The two Yarders now believing that Sherlock was innocent.
"Wait if it's in the fog, then how many people do you think this has affected just so he could keep Henry quiet?" Donovan questions with a frown.
"Of course he has, he-" Kitty snapped her jaw shut at the glare everyone sent her. She was even starting to get on Donavan's nerves!
"Why didn't you call?" Donovan questioned, remembering what Sherlock had said about Mycroft not texting if he could call.
“She doesn’t work for me,” Mycroft stated with a frown, causing everyone to frown as well. Worried for the doctor.
"Like the girl stalking John? What? She was chinese and acting weird," Donovan addded the last part when everyone gave her weird looks.
A few people sighed at Sherlock trying to be nice was actually his way of solving the case. Though they weren’t partially surprised, those that liked Sherlock, liked to think that it had also been his own special way of trying to be nice, but not particularly knowing how to.
Any good mood was instantly gone when they notice the woman in sadness, wishing they could do something to help.
"You sound like a five year old," Mrs Hudson commented causing John to blush slightly and everyone else laughing slightly.
Most of them blinked in shock at Irene talking to Mycroft instead of Sherlock. They knew that Moriarity had talked to Mycroft but they didn’t think it would be enough that Mycroft and Irene instantly assumed it was Mycroft.
Even Donovan or Kitty can't help but laugh at how annoyed and ridiculous Sherlock looks on the screen.
“Yeah, but half the time, it seemed like he purposely played off key to annoy one person or another,”
Mrs. Hudson huffed as they headed into the woods. She really needed to stop worrying so much, especially since she knew that they would get out of this okay.
"Why is he crying?" Molly questioned, slightly afraid and shocked. No one answered her, mostly because they were just as confused as she was.
"So you did listen to my warning, for a bit anyway," Donovan murmed thoughtfully. Though suprisingly no one heard her.
“It’s probably just an act,” Kitty huffed. John glared, wanting to correct her but knowing she was right.
As she felt the pitying looks of others, Mrs Hudson resolutely stared at the screen, ignoring everyone. Except for when John squeezed her hand.
"The freaks probably just pretending all this time," Donovan whispers to Anderson. Said forenzic scientest flinched ever so slightly as the soft trickle of guilt started weeding its way into his stomach.
Donovan frowned, she hadn't even noticed who it was, just that it was for Sherlock and John knew about it from a look? Not that she was surprised, but she thought she was better at her job to notice when a serial killer called.
“Why am I surprised that Sherlock actually checked it?” Donovan questioned curiously, after all, of course Sherlock checked it to make sure she wasn’t faking it.
Those who actually believed Sherlock, now including Donovan, hated seeing the usually strong and detached male so weak.
Kitty frowned. Because while the words sounded more like the Sherlock she knew, the murderous intent was still in his eyes.
Everyone smiles when Sherlock calls John his friend. Though both Molly and Lestrade huff slightly at not being called Sherlock’s friend.
Mrs Hudson squeezes Johns hand painfully tighter at that. Everyone close to John winces, fearing for their friend even though they knew he was going to be alright.
John cringed at not being able to remember which girlfriend was which. His eyes stayed firmly on the screen though, avoiding all the looks he knew the others would give him.
"Really?” Mrs Hudson frowns slightly over at Mycroft. Though her tone was mostly teasing, after all, she had gotten used to the Holmes' weird sense of humor.
Everyone frowned, worried for Henry, feeling pity for the poor male who had been tormented all his life, by his own mind.
Everyone with a consciouness gasped as they heard the little boys voice. Molly reaches out and grabs Lestrade - the closest person's hand - and squeezed in horror.
Everyone sighed in relief, happy that Henry didn't have a gun anymore. Though whether they were happy because it meant he wasn't a danger to Sherlock and John or a danger to himself, well that depended on who it was.
“How many girlfriends have you had?” Donovan questioned curiously, after all, they’ve only seen Sara on this.
"He really does care," Lestrade murmers, more speaking to himself than anyone else. Donovan frowns slightly, the guilt that had been pretty much silent slowly started to make itself more known as she started seeing Sherlock's... more human side.
Anderson, Lestrade and Donovan all wince in empthay at John's rapidly dispairing look. Remembering what it was like to have Sherlock tell you that your best theory was bad.
“Did she really spend her last few moments alive to send Sherlock a text?” Donovan questioned in shock. She knew Irene cared about him and everything, but that still seemed a little excessive.
"It's a machine John, it can't hear you," Lestrade muses, his eyes crinkling in amusement as everyone chuckles slightly.
“Why isn’t Sherlock picking up?” Lestrade questioned in fear, his mind instantly jumping to the worst possible outcomes.
"That definitely sounds like Sherlock,” Mrs Hudson teases, “especially when he had to deal without you John,” She couldn’t help but add. John huffs, but knows better than to try and argue with her, which just spurs everyone else on.
“Oh my god,” Molly gasped, with the Yarder's eyes widening. More than a few of them looked like they were ready to kill Neilson.
Everyone breathes a sigh in relief when Frankland leaves. Hoping that they get out of this without getting arrested, or hurt.
"That's literally the worst thing you could say to Sherlock, espically when his  doing a case," Molly commented, everyone hummed in agreement, even those who didn't know Sherlock all that well.
Kitty blinks in shock at Sherlock's answer, Moriarty was laughing quietly, whilst the rest just roll their eyes.
"Did Sherlock just quote a TV show?" Anderson comments, grinning slightly in amusement at the thought.
Kitty frowns in disgust while the others shake the head at him. Though they aren't surprised. No one notices Morairty grin.
"John, subtly!" Lestrade laughs slightly at John who just blushes even more, the officers laughing even more.
"What's Sherlock looking for?" Donovan questioned, trying to keep the disgust out of her voice. No one answers her anyway.
"You know, for a second I thought he had figured that out without the use of technology," Anderson admitted, chuckling slightly.
While Sherlock making Irene beg might not have been so surprising, Irene actually doing it, was extremely fucking surprising.
A couple of people, mainly the Officers all chuckle at Sherlock and John's antics, and the annoyed face of Kenny.
"Aren't you the one who is supposed to be good with emotions?" Anderson questioned, frowning at how terrible John was at attempting to calm Sherlock.
Most people snicker (why is Mycroft so 'refrianed but Sherlock's not?) at Sherlock.... being... well... Sherlock.
"Because that's not creepy and stalkerish at all." Anderson muttered causing everyone the eldest Holmes Brother to chuckle.
"And you thought he was a good person? He wouldn't even help the government because of a petty sibling rival," Kitty muttered under her breath but being the only one not to notice the smirk on Moriarty's face as he stared at the screen. Sowing a few seeds of doubt in the stubborn detective, and confirming something for the other two.
"If you had seen the sneaker, would you have figured out any of that like John did?" Lestrade questions, smirking when she doesn't answer.
"Ten bucks says it's Moriarty," John mutters darky, causing the room to fall in an awkward tension. The three yarders, even if one doesn't know it, was slowly starting to see the truth.
"And definitely not the best way to find out," Mrs Hudson murmured, "but Sherlock never was good with tact," She added sadly, memories of Sherlock swirling around her mind.
"Why would he see Liberty?" Anderson questioned in confusion. Correctly guessing that the silence meant that he would find out.]
Laughter filled the room at Sherlock’s dramatic words, while Mrs Hudson grins proudly at Sherlock’s words.
“No one would give you a medal for killing Sherlock,” John found himself grumbling quietly to himself with a glare.
Everyone but Mycroft, even John chuckled slightly. "It's their culture," Mycroft tuttered, shaking his head slightly.
“Wow,” Donovan whispered in shock before turning to an embarrassed Molly. “Even if the dress is a little overkill, it looks good,” She compliments, helping ease Molly’s embarrassment.
"That would be highly unlikely, winning the lottery would be more likely with all things considered." Mycroft instantly shots her idea down.
“I thought you would be happy that Irene was out of the picture,” Kitty questioned, causing more than one person to glare at her.
"How the hell did the freak help you with your limp?" Donovan snaps, but John pointedly ignored her. Whether because of the freak comment or because he just hates her nobody knows.
"Is he proud over the fact that I know to ask Sherlock for help, or the fact that I actually would tell someone that?" Lestrade asks curiously.
"Who would do such a thing? And to their sister no less!" Lestrade hisses in disgust, everyone hums in agreement.
“That’s actually a good idea,” Lestrade muses quietly to himself, and though almost everyone hears him, no one comments on it.
"When he's looking around like that, he kinda looks like he's gonna rob the place," Molly joked slightly but it just caused the room to get even more tense as they all subconcsiouly remembered the last days of Sherlock.
"Sherlock does have a lot of weird experiments," Mrs Hudson says, remembering the thumbs in the fridge.
"He didn't deny it," Anderson murmured, pointing at the screen causing his colleagues and Molly to start laughing.
"Did we see that?" Molly questioned with a frown, wondering if that was the bit they saw, or something else had happened to Henry.
Snorts filled the room at Sherlock already having guessed John's question. A lot of them having relaxed, praying that Sherlock is alright now.
Everyone’s eyes widened as they realised what Mycroft was talking about, before wincing as they remembered how Sherlock was the one who figured it out.
"Has anyone else noticed that Sherlock seems to be grooming John?" Anderson asks turning around to face everyone. "I mean he keeps stopping before saying something important, letting you finish even if he knows you probably wont have it, he wouldn't do that with anyone else," Eveyrone frowns at Anderson's words, pondering slightly before they all turn back to face the screen, some like John still pondering the words.
“She probably killed the rabbit,” Mycroft interjected. “Less anyone finds out that she messed her job up,”
A few people gasped surprised again at suddenly seeing them at the crime scene, before figuring it was the same as before.
Mrs Hudson and Molly both gasped at the sight of three men with guns, their eyes flickering worriedly over to John. While the others tensed, frowning at the men.
“Does Sherlock not know your first name?” Donovan questioned in shock. Looking over at an annoyed Lestrade.
“How the hell is he going to get back in?” Anderson questioned in shock. “You two barely got out last time,” Worry slipped into his voice.
“Why would Sherlock care about the counter on your blog?” Anderson questioned curiously, John shrugged in response.
"Probably could have phrased that better," Anderson can't help but comment, wincing slightly. "But then again, Sherlock always was blunt,"
"Don't worry John, soon you'll never have a break," Anderson jokes, causing John to chuckle and hum in agreement.
"Is that really a good quote to mention right now?" Mrs. Hudson questions, feeling like mentioning death right now was a big faux pas. But then again, it wasn't like Sherlock would care either way.
Molly frowned, feeling sorry for the poor monkey and the other animals being kept there for experiments.
"Oh my god," Molly gasps, a hand going to cover her mouth. Tears quickly filling her eyes. The otehrs all shake their heads, sadness filling them. And with Lestrade and John, also guilt at not being able to save her in time.
Almost everyone glares at Neilson, more than one of them wishing that the injuries that Sherlock had given him had been enough to kill.
The three police officers huff at the blatant crime commited in front of them. Even if none of them were very surprised.
"Hang on! Where did he get that ID?" Lestrade practically shouted, John smirked slightly, seeing this as payback.
"To show that it was the last one maybe?" Lestrade answers, but he doesn't really know. "All the last ones were longer than the others.
"When did he order a taxi?" Lestrade asks as the others try and remember when or why Sherlock had orderd a taxi.
Sadness filled the room at the mention of people’s lives being in danger because it, more than one person wishing that she would get the hell away.
"That could be taken two ways," Anderson muttered and Lestrade hits him over the head because of said comment.
“What does she mean?” Molly questioned curiously, a little, or a big edge filling her voice. No one answered, as only one person in the room knew with certainty what she meant, and John didn’t feel like talking.
“How can he get nothing from her?” Anderson questioned in shock, his eyes widening. He had never heard of Sherlock not getting a deduction.
"Do you think ge got it right?" Molly asked, almost wistfully. No one answered her, for no one, not even Mycroft knew the answer.
John would be lying if he said that he hadn’t thought about it. But Sherlock had been so disappointed when she was dead that he hadn’t gone through with it. Not that John ever bothered to answer Kitty.
“You, if I didn’t know any better, I would say that Sherlock is flustered,” Donovan spoke quietly, her eyes wide.
“Yeah, that definitely is a dead give away that,” Lestrade mused, shaking his head slightly at John. “And I here I thought you were sneaky,”
"So he's a freak," Donovan muttered in disgust. John opened his mouth, before shaking his head it wasn't worth it.
The group, expect for Mycroft and Moriarty all wince as they see the old woman. Espically those who now how this ends.
"I can't believe she actually still talks to you, I know I said it before but still!" Anderso cried. The other Yorkers nod in agreement while Kitty frowns in confusion. Not having been there for the Blind Banker.
"Why would Sherlock say something like that? Wouldn't that cause you not to go, more than anything else?" Molly asks, and John shuffles in his seat as Mycroft gives the girl a pointed look.
"A kid should never have to see that," Kitty murmured, just about the first thing she had said, that everyone else whole-heartedly agreed on.
"Who would want to hang out with the freak anyway?" Donovan commented, frowning slightly when everyone sends annoyed glares at her but no one sent any to Molly.
"They're not trying," Mycroft couldn't help but comment, sounding a lot like a prick, which is normal.
John grins at the sight of Sherlock getting annoyed at Irene. Glad that he wasn’t always infatuated with the woman.
"That's actually pretty clever," Donovan mused, wishing she had thought of something like that whenever she needed to come up with a name for something.
"Yeah, don't you just go straight to the crime scene, or where ever you need to go?" Donovan added with a sneer, glaring slightly.
"Seriously though, how did you get my phone number?" John demands. Mycroft smiles but still doesn't answer.
A few people, mainly the Yarders, chuckled at the mention of the hat. Knowing how much it pissed Sherlock off.
"What's going on? I thought we were here to watch Sherlock's life not this," Anderson comments. John shuffles slightly in his seat.
“Is that lipstick on his cheek?” Molly questioned, jealousy in her voice. A few people frown at that, John and Molly especially.
Despite how absurd everything sounded, those with a conscience, still winced at the flashbacks. Feeling sorry that Henry had to witness such a traumatic event.
Before anyone else could reply another flash of white and Molly appeared. The massive T.V. on the side of the wall turned on, to reveal a message written in white.
Anderson snorts as Sherlock calls the men stupid. HIs mind flashing back to everytime that Sherlock called him stupid.
"I don't think that's quite how it works," Donovan jokes, everyone snorts in amusement, as curiosity about what Sherlock was doing piped up.
"He's not actually going to take that... is he?" Lestrade asks, almost worried. He doesn't get an answer, or at least not a worded one. But as John hang his head sadly, well that was answer enough.
"How did he notice any of that? He only brefly looked around the important?" Anderson's voice was filled with masked wonder, no one answers him as the answer itself was pretty obvious. Cause 1 it's Sherlock, and 2 unlike the rest of us he observes. Though John did end up explaing that to him.
"'Hey, you! Why don't you look where you're going?' Is what he said," Mycroft replied causing everyone to hum.
"I can't believe I'm saying this but he's right, what if you walked into on coming traffic?" Mycroft, yes Mycroft, commented slightly shock in his voice as Anderson smiled proudly.
A few people can’t help but feel pity for Molly, and her obvious crush on Sherlock, though they know better than to mention anything about it.
"What's he doing?" Anderson asks, leaning forward curiously. No one answers him, mostly because no one knew not even John or Mycroft. Or Mycroft could be just choosing to stay quiet, you never know with him.
"That's not very nice," Mrs Hudson chided, Mycrfot opened his mouth, probably to say something mean, but propemtly shut it as he remembered that she was extremely close to his late brother.
"Okay, so maybe he hasn't come that far," Anderson muses, as he stares at Sherlock. "But he was getting more human like,"
A few people snorted at John drinking it anyway, just because Sherlock gave him a sad look. Lestrade opened his mouth to make a joke, but paused, not wanting to make John uncomfortable.
A few people snorted in amusement at Barrymore thinking that Sherlock was into conspiracies. Which made no sense and yet seeing Sherlock as a conspiracy person somehow made sense at the same time.
A few people sighed in relief, as Sherlock started acting like himself. Insulting people through observations.
The two newbies frown in confusion, Kitty glances around but doesn't speak, deciding to just observes for the time being while Moriarty smirks at the other's trying to annoy them, which worked wonders.
"And here I thought you had endless patience for your brother?" Molly questions, half joking half being serious.
Molly finds tears in her eyes as she stares at the scene in front of her, shuffling slightly into Mrs Hudson's embrace.
"It's true aint it? All those bodies were because of Sherlock, why do you people keep forgetting that he was behind everything?" Donovan replied, her voice calm as she rolled her eyes.
"Does he have to look so smug?" Anderson asks, feeling slightly sympthetic at the Dective Inspector.
Mrs Hudson huffed in annoyance when she noticed that no one was taking notice of the crying man. The others all flinching, wondering if they would notice someone crying in the middle of the street.
"You know, I don't think I've ever seen Sherlock ask for someone else's deductions," Anderson muses. No one answers him because no one has to. John has always been the expection for Sherlock.
“I didn’t mean it like that,” Donovan spoke quietly when she was sure John had calmed some-what down. “I swear, I just meant it as a joke, if I had known it had any truth to it, I wouldn’t have said anything,” Donovan swore softly, feeling guilty as she stared helplessly at John.
"Whom," Mycroft commented, "it's who's sleeping with whom not who," He added at everyone's confused looks, the others chuckle slightly whilst Kitty, Moriarty and Donavan glare at Mycroft.
"He can be compassionate when it matters," Mrs. Hudson murmed and both her and John both smile slightly, espically John.
Now it was everyone’s turn to be completely shocked at the fact that Sherlock was at that execution. Though a few couldn’t help but wonder, how the hell he managed to find her, and without anyone noticing.
“Why is Sherlock so… cherry?” Donovan questioned. The Sergeant not trying to be mean, just confused as to why the normally grumpy Sherlock was so happy.
"Poor Dimmock," Molly commented though she her voice was teasing which was sounded weird with her normal nice girl attiuide.
"You know, for someone who spends so much time with Sherlock, you would think you could lie a bit better," Anderson teases, John blushes slightly as the others chuckle at him.
"Sherlock makes observations and estimates based on all the facts, he doesn't simply jump to an idea and stick with it," Mycroft explained.
“Go Sherlock!” Anderson couldn’t help but cheer, pleasantly surprised that Sherlock could fight, even if it was dirty.
Everyone chuckles as Sherlock once again doesn’t notice John leaving. John shaking his head in amusement at his late best-friend.
Molly gasps in shock nd even though the Yards, John and Mrs Hudson know that Sherlock will be okay, they can't help but feel worry as they stare at the scene on the screen.
Once again everyone flinches at the sight of Sherlock up high, even Donovan, though her's was more mental and very very deep down. It espically didn't help when Sherlock had climbed over the ledge, the only piece of comfort they had was that Sherlock wouldn't die, yet.
John huffed to himself, feeling annoyed that his past self didn't notice that Sherlock was lying! It looked so obvious now.
Molly and Mrs Hudson jumps slightly at Sherlock's outburst before sighing. "Sherlock," Mrs Hudson cries.
Everyone sighed, feeling sympathy for Henry. Especially since they didn't understand why Sherlock would do that.
Mrs Hudson, John and Molly all glare at Sebastian along with Lestrade and even Anderson. While Donovan smirked.
Mrs Hudson sighed at Sherlock smiling, silently wondering how Sherlock managed to keep any clients when he treated them so harshly. Even if she technically knew the answer already.
“Is that supposed to be the hound?” Donovan questioned worriedly. No one obviously answered her, though everyone became even more worried.
"You're looking for a serial killer and you didn't bring your gun?" Lestrade chides, shaking his head at John.
"Oh Sherlock" Mrs Hudson sighs, staring at the boy who was like a son to her. Wishing she could find some way to go back in time and help him before things become to late.
"No, not really, I mean I wasn't exactly listening when Greg said where the crime scene was and I never heard Sherlock talking to the taxi," John explained, feeling like an idiot.
Moly frowned as she watched Henry changing the channel. Never having thought about how Henry’s fear could change his everyday life. Yet now she can’t stop thinking about it.
“Sherlock throws Neilson out of a window doesn’t he?” Molly questions, John nods in answer and Molly sighs, though she still had a smile on her face.
Everyone winces at that, and even Kitty looked slightly disgust. But she brushed it off as Jim being a good actor, even though a little seed of doubt planted itself in her mind.
Kitty frowned as she realised that it really had been a hallucination. Doubts began to actually form in her mind, after all why would Sherlock see an image of Moriarty, if it had all been fake.
“We will, but we’ve all gotten used to not question all the weird things that happen around Sherlock,” John finally answered her.
A few, mostly Donovan and Anderson sigh in relief that the horror movie type part was over. Even if they both knew that it would show up again eventually.
"It does sound insane," Lestrade added more softly, Molly hummed deciding to stay quiet instead of asking the questions on the tip of her tounge.
“God this really does feel like a horror movie,” Molly muttered, sinking into her chair, because she hated horror movies.
A couple of people snort at the exhange between the two and Lestrade shrugs at the confused looks people send him.
For sitting on the chairs, the two new people, are Moriarty and Kitty Riley. Moriarty was leaning back in his seat, wearing his usual smirk, masking the fact that he was confused with his air of madness. Kitty just looked terrified her eyes finding flickering between everyone, not knowing what to do.
“I wasn’t expecting that,” Anderson muttered in shock, but wasn’t all that surprised that Sherlock had managed to figure that out.
Everyone who wasn't there blinked in shock, expect for Mycroft who jut shook his head at his younger brother.
"Why is it jumping around so much? Why not just explain everything all at once?" Molly asks, slight annoyance in her voice.
A few people smile at Mrs Hudson sneaking the phone out. Though the majority of them were shocked that Sherlock had actually forgotten the phone.
"I guess the solar system is imporant after all," Lestrade couldn't help but joke. Everyone with a humor laughed.
A few people sighed at the mention that Sherlock might be in danger, well those who cared about Sherlock did.
Everyone's faces immediantly drop, a sad sigh on their face. Especially for those who remembered how it ended.
Anderson and Lestrade huffs that he managed to get away, though they were mostly angry at themselves for not believing in Sherlock sooner.
“Oh please, like a coffee shop would be dramatic enough for the great Mycroft Holmes,” Lestrade jokes, much to everyone’s pleasure. Except for Mycroft who glares at the Inspector.
Even those who know Sherlock's random habits, couldn't help but be shocked about bloody appearance. Though Kitty was the only one who scrunched her face up in disgust. The others shook their heads at him, with even Donovan showing barely any disgust.
“Why are you surprised that she flirted with him?” Mrs Hudson questions. “She literally made it so a moan sound every time she texted him,” She added with a light hint of disgust at that rude noise.
"Of course Stapleton doesn't have access to that," Donovan grumbled, wishing that for once things would work out for them.
"If it's your shoulder then why do you have a limp?" Anderson asked curiously. John shuffled slightly in his seat but didn't respond.
"Where is this?" Anderson questioned curiously, as he studied the landscape. It definitely wasn't in London.
"When did the freak ever start looking for the pin? I thought he was just looking for the murderer," Donovan asked.
"You know, I only just realised something," Anderson trails off, causing everyone to look at him curiously. "He's grooming John to become a dective,"
"Seriously! Is anyone else creeped out by her?" Donovan yelled in annoyance. Molly, and the other yarders all hum in agreement while the other's pretty much just roll their eyes.
The Yarders all raise an eyebrow in surprise at her words, while Molly flushes and John glares at her.
"The only body that my brother put, was his own," An awkward sad silence filled the room as they all turned to the screen.
"Major Barrymore isn't going to like it if he finds you in his office," Donovan couldn't help but point out.
Laughter filled the room as they finally realised what the flashing lights had been. The laughter getting louder when John sunk into his chair, embarrassed.
A few people blinked in shock at Sherlock wanting the camera phone. Sherlock’s constant words about how sentiment was terrible ringing through their eyes.
"He really needs to learn how to flirt," Anderson comments almost snidely, kinda like Mycroft. A couple people, mainly the men hum in agreement, cringing as the screen.
“I know I said this before, but I’m glad you’re lying to him, and that you actually went through with it,” Molly commented quietly, smiling warmly over at John.
A few people glare at Irene as they realise that she had broken into Sherlock's room, and was now in the same room with him still practically asleep.
Molly sighs sadly at Sherlock’s response to her arrival. Wondering why he always seemed to be annoyed with her.
"That girl doesn't take a hint does she?" Anderson commented, "It's painstakingly obvious that Sherlock's hates her,"
A small smirk appeared on John’s lips at Sherlock leaving Irene behind, he knew that Sherlock did care for her, but it still felt nice to watch him leave her.
"Then hurry up!" Anderson hisses. Not because he hated Sherlock still or because he was mad at Sherlock. His outburst was purely because he was terrfied for that little boy.
"It's just what Sherlock does," John replied, "he almost always charges head first into danger without a second thought,"
Everyone couldn't help but snort at Henry accidentally insulting Sherlock, especially since he was a fan.
“Holy,” Mrs. Hudson breathed, not expecting that in the slightest. Almost everyone staring wide eyed at the screen in shock.
“What could Irene possibly want?” Molly questioned curiously. The woman had always seemed like she had everything that she wanted.
"Why do you think we know?" Mycroft snapped back, John glanced back in surprise, he had been so silent that John had forgotten he was there.
Everyone flinched, a few turning to check on John. Who had started to frown, cheered up as he remembered Sherlock's later words.
"Sherlock was right, the murderer really did have the phone the whole time," Anderson muttered, causing Donovan to huff in annoyance.
"What? Is he going to start a book club?" Molly jokes slightly still feeling slightly uncomfortable. A couple people chuckle, smiling over at her.
"Of course Doctor Mortimer was his therapist, he had a massive traumatic effect which impacted his later years," Mycroft couldn't quite help but point out. Much to John's and everyone else's annoyance.
“Why does Sherlock have the ticket plane to the one thats getting shot down?” Lestrade questions, his voice hard as he turns to Mycroft, knowing that he was the one who was behind it.
Those who hadn’t already, finally realised what Sherlock was planning to do as he gave Lestrade a list of fake injuries.
Everyone winced slightly, feeling worried for Henry. The officers hated that they couldn't do anything to help him.
"Is it bad that I feel disappointed that Sherlock hasn't already guessed just from meeting Barrymore?" Molly questioned, feeling a little silly.
"Did you really think there was even a chance that Sherlock would watch television for anything but the news?" Anderson questioned, teasing Lestrade ever so slightly. Lestrade huffs.
John blinked as the white vanished, revealing a cosy looking room. To one side there was a table lining the wall, snacks all piled across it. Directly across from the table of foods was a giant TV, like the ones in the cinemas. Between the TV and Table where different seats. From bean bags to rolly chairs all of the seats looked like they had been quickly just thrown in the room. But besides that, there was no other furniture in the room. Though there was a strange looking figure sitting in an armchair in the corner. The figure was clad in black, and even the shadows themselves seemed to be wrapped around the figure. John frowned at him before his eyes were drawn elsewhere. Three figures emerged out of nowhere, the same white light enveloped them. When the light left, it revealed, Inspector Lestrade, Donovan and Anderson.
"You really need to get better at lying John," Lestrade teases, John blushes and looks sheepishly at the ground.
"What is that book?" Molly asks, a little unnerved. No one bothers to answer her, mostly as the only person who knows the answer was Mycroft, who couldn't be bother answering him.
"My brother sadly doesn't understand emotions, because of his Asperger," Mycroft shook his head as he spoke and his hand tightened ever so slightly on his cane.
A few people cringed at the words, sympathy filling them for the test subjects. While almost everyone wondered how someone could do that to another human.
Everyone winced when the alarm was hit. Everyone was either wondering how they got out, or worrying that they didn't. Or both.
“That poor man,” Mrs Hudson mused, feeling so sad for everything that Henry had been through and must be feeling.
“The photos are one the phone aren’t they?” Lestrade asks after he realises what Sherlock is throwing up and down. John hums in confirmation.
"Your in trouble" Mrs Hudson says causing everyone, even John to chuckle, as Lestrade wakes up and laughs not actually knowing what everyone was laughing at.
Despite the fact that Mycroft getting the alert was a bad idea, a few still chuckled at Mycroft's face.
"Well obviously," Donovan muttered sarcastically. She really didn't like supernatural stories made just to con people.
“Why did you count the texts?” Anderson questioned curiously, an almost teasing note to his voice. “Jealous?”
Everyone, or at least those who liked Sherlock, winced at the reminder of Sherlock's death. The sadness at the reminder, outweighing the amusement at Sherlock's food.
Kitty stared at the screen in shock, never having seen Sherlock change like that so much. She couldn't help but wonder why everyone here thought Sherlock was so innocent when Sherlock was such a good actor.
More worry filled the room as yet another person came up. Everyone thinks along the same lines that the more people who see them, the more likely they would get caught.
"Hey, why didn't that weird flashback thing happen?" Anderson asked, "You know, how it showed Eddi Van Coon,"
"The last date you guys went on she almost died, most girls would leave before you could say 'stay'" Donovan pointed out, shaking her head slightly.
"Don't worry, it stopped hurting soon after I met Sherlock," John replied, a soft smile on his face.
"He observes unlike you people," Mycroft retorts sharply, though everyone just ignored the sharp bite to his voice.
“Boys!” Mrs Hudson exclaimed, with a shake of her head. Mycroft rolls her eyes at her, kind of happy that no one noticed to yell at him.
