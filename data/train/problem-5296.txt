‘Go enjoy yourself, Captain,’ Vision says. ‘Myself and the Colonel will be more than happy to make comments on everyone’s skating technique.’
A vibranium hand closes around his throat and drags him up to pin him against the wall. Peter finds himself looking into very familiar dark eyes, currently blank of all emotion.
‘The guy was going to unmask me and sell us both to someone from Hydra,’ he finishes his story. ‘Karen was getting Droney’s stun dart ready but Deadpool didn’t know that. He shot the guy holding me before he could take my mask off. I,’ Peter looks down, ‘I wasn’t particularly grateful because he’d killed the guy. I ran off and left him there. That’s why I was so distracted with my school work,’ he glances up at Tony, then back down at the floor again. ‘But I saw him the other day on a patrol and we talked it out. He said he was sorry but he was trying to help me.’ There’s quiet in the room. Tony continues to study Peter’s bent head, while the other three exchange looks.
Clint shrugs. ‘I owe a guy and I don’t know if he remembers or if he’s still alive. But you should be fine.’
Peter lets the corners of his mouth lift up a little at that. ‘I’m sorry I shouted at you,’ he says quietly. ‘I just…it took me by surprise and freaked me out.’
‘I thought we talked about it last week?’ Tony frowns. ‘When we were down working on those new surveillance bugs.’
‘We’ll follow your lead,’ Steve nods and gives him a small smile, pulling him into his embrace. Natasha leaves them as Tony feels some of his tension melt away, safe in the cocoon of Steve’s arms.
‘I would have thought Bucky was,’ he grins and then turns back to Matt before Loki can say anything in response. ‘Just how serious is it, Matt?’
Scott shakes his head, wincing as the motion pulls at some of his injuries. ‘Couldn’t see. Everything was getting a little blurry anyway, and the guy was backlit from some headlights so I couldn’t make out much. He asks me to pass on a message to you though,’ he says looking up at Tony. ‘He says: “Tell Anthony, that Justin wants to get back in business with him again.” Then he takes the other guys and walks off leaving me in the alley.’
Her question is cut off by Dr Higgs entering the room, her expression is grim but she manages to give them a tight smile. ‘I’ve done all I can without having any in-depth records of what to expect from his physiology. His signs are good and I’m hopeful he will make a good recovery; how quickly or how fully still remains to be seen.’
‘You mean the fact that Brucie went all not-Jolly Green and destroyed our assault course?’ Tony voice comes from behind them, and Scott turns to see the rest of them hurrying over, some quicker than others.
One film later and Peter enters the common area with the now empty plate and spoon, putting them in the sink and heading straight for the freezer. He tries really hard to hold back his grin at the looks Bucky and Natasha are sending each other.
Rhodes nods, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. ‘It was something we all agreed on, Pep. We thought it would be the best option and safest for the whole team.’
Natasha laughs just as the door opens and, distracted, Wanda loses her balance. ‘What are you two doing?’ Peter asks, frowning down at her from her spot on the floor.
It’s obvious the teen isn’t happy but does as the Captain says; it’s very rare he’ll argue with Steve, and Thor sees Wade relax a little and give the blond a thankful smile. ‘Alright, where do you want the webs?’
‘There’s been a lot to process for all of us,’ Steve cuts in before another argument can start, ‘and we should wait for Clint and Scott to arrive before we try making too many plans for dealing with Thanos. Not to mention Loki is still recovering and T’Challa and Okoye have only just arrived. We should leave things here for tonight, take some time to process, and then meet tomorrow better prepared to tackle everything.’
‘You do realise Bucky’s already taken two out with his right? And Clint’s got two knives ready for any that get close to him.’
‘Ah screw you,’ Bucky gives him a playful shove. ‘Come on Scrooge. Trust me you don’t want an excitable Spider-Man coming to find you. No amount of training can prepare you for that.’
There’s silence for a couple of seconds then Tony bursts out laughing, tears streaming down his face. The rest of the table joining in, even Vision managing a chuckle.
I know what you’re all thinking: oh Wade you’re so wonderful! Volunteering to help save all those people that the horrible Francis has got in his clutches. You really are a hero!
‘Loki and Thor are using Yule as a chance to mend some bridges between Asgard and Jotunheim,’ Steve explains at dinner that night, ‘but they said they’d come two days before Christmas so we can have a Yule feast together and they’ll stay until after New Year.’
‘Mr Loki, sir, is it really true you can do magic?’ Cassie asks him as Scott loads her plate up with food, lisping over some of the words with her missing front tooth.
‘Ah ha!’ Tony finds the brick he’s been looking for, pulling it out to reveal a key hung on a hook inside the space behind it.
‘I have to demonstrate my powers every two weeks,’ Wanda explains to Bucky. ‘It’s to a group of military that Rhodes picked out, and they send unbiased reports back to Ross. They’re actually pretty decent guys.’
‘You- I- I can’t- I need to get the fuck out,’ before Peter can say anything Wade has pushed away from the table and all but run out of the restaurant.
‘How did you manage to trust Steve enough to risk it after he left before?’ she cuts across his rambling.
‘Only one person would be stupid enough to try and speak to me this early in the morning,’ Tony grumbles, face covered by one hand. ‘Put it through, FRIDAY,’ he gives the call enough time to be patched through and then continues. ‘Ross what do you want this early? I’ve not even had my first mug of coffee so it better be life or death.’
‘Anyway,’ Natasha rolls her eyes and tries not to think too much about the headaches she’s going to get over this month, ‘why don’t we tell you what we’ve done over the past few years and then you can let us know if there’s anything you used to do for Christmas, Quill?’
Just then a shot rings out. Steve flinches on instinct, but it’s Hammer who lets out a wail of pain, clutching his hand as the device falls to the floor. Before he can work out who fired the shot Natasha appears out of nowhere, taking the former business tycoon to the floor, a gun to his head.
‘Of course. Let me know when you need help,’ he tells her, speeding away to do as she asks. Slowly she moves the debris over, managing to take a few steps closer to the park as she starts to feel the strain of carrying such a heavy load for so long.
far,’ he can feel himself turning red under Harry’s praise. ‘I don’t think many people believe how close I am to the team yet.’
‘Oh,’ Peter breathes as the scarred face comes into view; but that’s not what’s caught his attention. ‘Wade your eyes are gorgeous.’ Then his brain catches up to what he’s said and he blushes bright red. ‘I mean-uh- you know- uh-’
By far the most interesting thing he has ever been called into though, and that includes Clint’s arrows covering him in bright pink powder which he still hasn’t found out
‘Well I do miss the hunt,’ she admits, but at the hopeful look on Thor’s face she rolls her eyes. ‘No, Thor, that is not an invitation for you to start convincing everyone to do the hunt.’ Her king pouts, but she ignores him. ‘We also used to do tournaments afterwards, though, as a way for warriors to show how much they’d progressed through the year.’
‘In this case, Steve or I could manage it alone,’ Bucky explains as Steve takes a couple of steps back to give himself a small run up and easily makes it to the top, ‘which means we can then help the agents up, or in this case: Steve can pull Peter up.’
‘We may not be able to use them, Tony,’ Nick warns him, ‘it’ll be the first place Ross would look for anything going on. No matter how much you trust them something could still get leaked.’
Bucky blinks and seems to take in what’s just happened. ‘Oh yeah… that’s a very good point. You’re dead Wilson.’
‘Tell him to concentrate around the old Expo site, and at warehouses at these addresses,’ as Matt gives him the addresses Peter takes out his notebook to write them down. ‘That’s where I’ve picked up the most activity, makes me think it’s some of their bases.’
‘The Red Room,’ he sees her freeze, the mask slamming down on her mask quicker than he can blink, ‘I remember the Red Room. I remember training you. I remember-’
‘Yes,’ Steve doesn’t hesitate in his breathless answer, feeling his heart speed up with anticipation.
He sighs. Looks like they’re having this conversation now. He stops and lets them walk on a couple of paces. ‘I remember, Nat.’
‘I just… I can’t… I’m supposed to be a hero and save people, that’s what everyone expects of Spiderman. But I didn’t do
Loki’s noticed the sprig of mistletoe above the exit to the common area and, when he sees the mercenary standing to leave, he makes his way around to meet him as he’s leaving.
‘How long you been awake?’ he asks her, forcing himself to a seating position and leaning back against the stone wall that forms the back wall of their cells. He shuffles along towards her as she answers.
‘How long we been at this now?’ he asks, sitting on the table and shaking out his aching arm muscles.
‘Hey, do you want to hear this story or not?’ Tony raises an eyebrow, the children quickly apologise and quieten again. ‘Now, as I was saying before I was rudely interrupted,’ more giggling from the two children, ‘if the monsters somehow managed to get past the Honeybear they were then faced with the biggest challenge yet: the White Wolf and his fearsome partner Lady Spider. These two fighters were the fiercest yet, and nothing could compare to the love they had for the prince and the princess, the White Wolf alone would tear apart any monster that even
A/N: Hi everyone. See I promised I'd be on time this week! Hope you enjoy this chapter, I'm so sorry I still haven't responded to everyone's comments yet. I promise faithfully I will do it before it comes time to post next week.
Surprisingly it’s Steve who answers. ‘When he suggested it to me I agreed, Peter. It means you don’t have to worry about money while you’re out there and we’re all caught up with other things and can’t get to you easily. Not only that,’ he pauses to look at Tony, and the inventor nods. Steve sighs and continues. ‘Not only that, but we’re about to challenge HYDRA. In Europe. You are known to be linked to the team, and especially to Tony; if anything happens, if you think someone from HYDRA is nearby, you can just get yourself onto a train, or plane or whatever and get to us without wondering how you’ll manage it. It’s a safety net for you.’
‘What’s been the favourite so far?’ Ned asks, as Peter puts his head on the table, resigning himself to no support at all from his friends. Ever since the three of them introduced Loki to ice cream it had become a sort of addiction for the trickster. One night he and Tony had gone up to the common room from the labs after working late and found him sitting on the sofa with a giant tub of vanilla watching TV, eating it straight from the container with a spoon. Tony still teases Loki about it even though the Asgardian isn’t entirely sure what is so wrong with the situation.
There will definitely be more to come from my alternate take on the MCU, but I'll be posting it as a new series. Think of this as 'Phase 1' and 'Phase 2' will be focusing on the team trying to get the Wakandan Accords passed through and taking down HYDRA.
Steve just laughs and waves goodbye to Sam as the man leaves. ‘Do I need to tell Sam to stay out? We’ve been told you can’t have too much stress or excitement until the doctors are happy for you to be released.’
‘I’m sure we can find something to treat it with so that it’ll last a long time,’ Steve adds. ‘Tony, Bruce, Peter and Loki between them can come up with something I’m sure.’
‘We’ll join you as soon as we can. There’s some other things I need to keep my eye on other than the Wakanda Accords,’ is the response he gets.
Tony gives her a grateful smile as she leaves the room, he’s really not in the mood to be dealing with Ross today. He helps the super soldier twins and Wanda clear up the table and load the dishwasher before they head downstairs. He makes a quip about having to do the dishes before going to save the world and gets a tea towel in the face from Steve as a reward.
‘Deadpool?’ he can hear the amusement in the man’s voice, and tries to keep his face from going bright red.
‘T’Challa!’ Nakia leaps across to the king, sending them both sprawling to the ground just as an explosion rocks through the room.
Bucky laughs. ‘She’s loyal to you to a fault, but I can’t imagine she would hide something important from you just to spare your feelings. If she said they enjoyed it then I believe they did.’
‘I would ask for you to take it,’ T’Challa looks at Ororo, ‘but if something were to go wrong and you were attacked we do not yet have safeguards in place to be informed.’
‘Well I’ve got to think of something to do for a history project as well,’ he answers. ‘It’s not a homework task exactly, but we’ve got to have an idea to propose to our teacher for our next lesson.’
Rhodes sighs and looks at Steve. ‘I know she’s as worried as the rest of us, but she’s not going to helping him by keeping him bored.’
‘Parents, teachers, school kids and a team of misfits,’ he responds with a grin. ‘You got anything different?’ Bucky shakes his head and Steve lets himself relax a little. ‘Looking forwards to seeing Pete’s presentation?’
‘Spending the evening with Ned?’ Natasha asks, quirking an eyebrow at him. ‘I thought we agreed you would lay low.’
‘Wanda?’ Peter’s question pulls Tony and Steve from their conversation, and they see Wanda standing up, backing away from them.
‘I can’t be certain that the magic from my Asgardian form would not negate any of her abilities and would rather not take the risk. Encasing someone in a block of ice is not going to go down well with anyone here and is going to do nothing to encourage them to trust me, no matter how accidental it might have been.’
‘That’s the first time you got that right,’ she says as he releases her and takes off his mask. She’s smiling. ‘I told you that you were overthinking it.’
‘You’re initial invitation to stay here was because of Thor,’ Tony cuts him off yet again, ‘but you’ve earned the right to stay and to be a part of this team on your own merits and by proving to us that you’ve changed. Hell you saved Peter’s
‘Do we have to? I was getting the hang of it,’ Peter whines, and Bucky laughs at the pout on the teen’s face.
Steve has to admit, that the expressions on everyone’s faces when they realise Tony has hired them out an ice rink for the Avengers’ private use after hours makes his discomfort about being around the ice worth it. There’s a bar attached to it, and Vision and Rhodes decide they’re not going to risk it on the ice and will watch from there: Rhodes because of his legs and Vision because he doesn’t trust the ice. Not that Steve can blame him. He promises to join them soon.
‘Hey those are just as scary! I had a teacher I swear could see out of the back of her head and through desks. She always knew what was going on,’ Sam says.
She smiles a little sadly. ‘Our tradition as a family was that whatever went on the top of the tree went on last. My brother and I would take it in turns to be the one to put it on. It was always the last decoration we put up, sort of like saying the decorating is over and the rest of Christmas can start.’
‘It’s your own fault,’ the inventor points out from where he’s sprawled across their bed, ‘you three decided you were going to be all macho and get the tree back yourselves.’
It was supposed to be their first appointment to test run a prototype Spider-man nano suit that Tony had been working on. The bright eyed high-schooler was pretty excited to meet his mentor, having been picked up directly from school in a chauffeured, unmarked car. When he arrived at the Stark mansion, he instead walked in on Tony using an iconic shield as target practise, smashing bottles of alcohol against it. Peter stood behind Happy, who instructed the teen to back off and go wait in the car while he tried to subdue the billionaire - his boss, his friend - pissed drunk at quarter past 4 in the afternoon screaming "I fucking loved you. You said we’d do it
If Steve was being honest, he couldn't really tell the difference, didn't quite care, but he secretly loved watching Tony with his bed hair pointing in all directions go off on why Sesame Street was superior at 7 in the morning.
The once-inventor regularly endures panic attacks and nightmares every other night, waking up in cold sweat, barely being able to breathe and muttering the words “I’m sorry” over and over again until he fell asleep exhausted.
when you could have been with your family? Of course none of that mattered. Captain Perfect blows his trumpet and everybody rallies behind him and his robot sidekick like good fucking blind rats."
Sam notices again the redness creeping from Steve's neck up to his cheeks as he gushes at the memory. How serious are these two, Sam once wondered. He may have gotten his answer.
enjoying having Tony's ass pressed against his crotch) but when the weight of Tony returns, the genius' pants were gone.
“We’re taking Petey to town for the carnival right?” Steve replies loudly from inside the bathroom as he observes Peter brush his teeth.
The dog tags were the closest symbol of commitment he'd ever gotten from Steve and it remained closely tucked under the billionaire's clothes even after Steve and he went separate ways.
. Even if they took a portal to the venue now, they probably get an earful from the groom, but certainly murdered by the bride.
"I missed you though," he blurts out, straight into Steve's marble blue eyes. He leaves it at that, unsure of whether he would be overstepping to say more considering that it was he who made the decision for them to take a break from each other.
Bucky tosses a clean t-shirt which lands softly over Tony's head. The genius makes a quick examination of it and realizes it's Steve's. He puts it on without protest.
He sighs fondly while breaking into a smile as he looks down at his belt buckle, halfway being flicked open by a pair of hands that were moments ago settled casually on his waist. Now two strong forearms had appeared from behind, tugging his belt out of the loops of his pants and swiftly moving on to the buttons and zipper.
They were both stark naked (ha!) but thankfully their modesties were intact thanks to the spread of sheets covering their lower halves. That didn’t help Tony's brain-fart at all, he was caught frozen in the between lust and panic to even form a coherent thought.
It was only after her comment that he realized he was continously tearing off a new sheet of writing paper with only the words
She reshuffles the worry off her face in a brave attempt to stay positive and pulls Tony for a hug before he gets into the car. "One last thing," she says with a pained smile.
“Good job on the Empire State there, baby. Listen; remember what we agreed on? You only get to play during dinnertime if you agree to finish your meals. I got a report from Pops over there that there’s still some left but you won't eat 'em," Tony reasons.
The ability to remember and recall an image or experience in precised detail, clarity, and accuracy had always worked in his advantage in this line of work. His photographic memory was one of the many reasons why Captain America was a walking lethal weapon - he never forgets
More likely than anything, this fire engine was going to take flight like a Quinjet. Surely anything heavily modified with miniaturised rocket powered blasters shouldn’t qualify as an average four year old’s toy.
If he had his way, Tony would have demolished the Tower instead of letting it go to someone else; he'd much prefer to get rid of its sight. The grand structure reminded him too much of Steve. In every sense, the Tower was where it all began.
This earned a big a laugh as Natasha shakes her head, faking sympathy for Sam. Fortunately for the red-faced super soldier, Sam was keeping the story brief without going into any graphic details. Steve would have thrown himself off the train if he didn't.
"Steve seems to think you're worth all the trouble. My kid loves you to death. I think you're quite alright. So here's my friendly advise - I actually have on good authority that Natasha's idea of a happily ever after? It's exactly what she told you it was. So you're not technically having a Steve-Tony epic dilemma here."
The patch of grass had regrown beautifully, leaving no evidence or trail of the trauma it once endured from scorching repulser burns.
In dealing with the mental burn, Steve humoured himself that maybe the super soldier serum was more upset with him for hurting Tony, than Tony was himself.
"Oh, that's what I like to hear," Steve whispered; he gave Tony a soft kiss, so sweet and gentle against his sweaty temple. "Let me check on your cute little rear." Steve sat up then, fingers circling around the rim of his ass where the dildo was fucking into him. "You're still pretty wet," he murmured, massaging the (god, it wasn't tight anymore, was it? He was loose; he felt so, so loose) ring of muscle there, "but I suppose a little more wouldn't hurt." More lube, cool and slippery, dripped down his ass, his crack, and Tony could feel Steve ever so gently coating the dildo on every withdrawal, how it made Tony feel even wetter, even sloppier inside.
"Alright, get ready," Steve rumbled, and then he was ramming up into Tony, fast and hard like he was running a marathon, chasing down his orgasm like Tony was just a vessel for his pleasure, and Tony felt- so-
"I'm not doing anything I don't want to do here, my love," Tony whispered gently, biting back another swell of emotion as he slicked his fingers up, slid them down to the tightly furled entrance of his body. "Now you just lie back and let me take care of you, baby, alright?"
of the dildo fitting into place, the whir of the machine starting up. Tony tensed up, couldn't help himself, but Steve just rested a steadying hand on the small of Tony's back, slowly guiding his ass into position.
"I know, I know, big boy, they're your colors," Tony whispered hotly, nipping at the side of Steve's throat. "God bless America," he murmured, and this time Steve was laughing, pressing kisses to Tony's face as he slid the ramp under Tony's chest and hips, and
"You've got the sweetest mouth," Steve grunted, fist flying over Tony's cock. "I don't know what I like better — feeling it around my cock or hearing you say my name—"
"Basically the pleasure center of the brain," Jan told Steve apologetically. "It's responsible for short term memory, hormone regulation, your pain perception and sleep regulation, emotional regulation and decision-making—"
"Now you just sit back and let me go to town on your cute little rear," Steve murmured, hands sliding back to grab at the firm globes of his ass. He kneaded at the skin, spreading Tony's cheeks wide so Steve's cock could slip between them and catch at the rim.
erection tenting his sweatpants, a huge wet spot darkening the front of his pants practically down to his thighs. His hips hitched and jerked in the air, like he wanted to rut against the bedspread but couldn't bring himself to do it, and he was making desperate, choked-off little moaning sounds in between gasps for breath.
"Tony, Tony, Tony," Steve moaned, a constant mantra in his ear. He clutched at Tony's face, bumped their noses together, panted into Tony's mouth. "Oh, baby, that's so good," he whined, sucking at Tony's lower lip. His toes flexed against Tony's back, his legs starting to shake. "Oh, baby, just like that, please— Tony, oh good
," Steve gasped, rolling his hips into Tony's grip. He felt himself flushing, his face going hot with embarrassment, knew it was a bright splash of scarlet across his cheeks. Tony twisted his hand, slid it up from balls to tip, biting at the cord of muscle on Steve's throat. "Tony,
"There you go, Shellhead," Steve murmured, and slid one finger in, probing, gently stretching as he slowly fucked it in and out. "Look at you," he murmured, his expression open and dazed and flushed with sex and Tony wanted to moan, wanted to rut against the bed and spread his legs like a whore for Steve because Steve was going to
"Turn towards me, baby," Steve said, reaching his arms out, and Tony was immediately shifting, twisting his torso and legs around so he could shuffle over to the side of the bed, closer to Steve. "Good boy," Steve praised, and Tony basked in, wanted to take Steve's praise and bottle it up and keep it there forever, right below his breastbone.
Steve, and it made him ache, right beneath his breastbone, so that Tony wanted to just reach out and wrap him in his arms. "Dr. Nguyen said it was one of the side effects," he said miserably, clenching his fists, panting hotly against his bicep. "That it might even have been the point of the whole thing."
"No, it's—" Tony bit back his reply, stared down at the sheets between him, his eyes suddenly much brighter than they were before. Steve could see his lashes, fluttering furiously against his cheeks, and Steve felt like a thrice-damned monster. "It's— it's really, it's okay, Steve, it was stupid, you're right, let's just— I should get some rest—"
," Steve whispered reverently, both hands petting Tony's hair and face now, his legs practically jerking as his hips rocked ever so gently back and forth into Tony's mouth and Tony just swallowed and swallowed and swallowed. "Oh, oh, Tony,
"Can we give him another dose of Adenosine?" Tony asked. He grabbed a tablet off the stack in front of him and started scrolling, trying to make sense of the chemical makeup of the drug from the AIM lab they'd raided. On its own, it looked pretty much like any random drug from the street—an amphetamine-like stimulant designed to bind to various transport proteins—but once it hit Steve's bloodstream, the drug compounded upon itself, twisting and turning and latching onto various cells in his central nervous system and multiplying so fast even the serum couldn't keep up.
Once the suit and Cap's uniform were sealed up to be carted away, Tony got to scrubbing too, even though he thought it was a bit of a moot point. Better to be safe than sorry, he told himself idly, making sure to wash his hands and where the seams of the armor could potentially have let some of the powder in. The second rinse was colder than the first, and both of them shivered and dripped while they waited for towels and jumpsuits to be passed through the little flaps in the tent.
Steve's jaw dropped, a soft, rosy flush blooming over his cheeks. "I'm— Hell," he grunted, crossing his arms and leaning back against the door jamb. Steve was a beast of a man, but he looked almost small there, hunched over and looking increasingly like he wanted to either throw up or punch something. "Hell, I'm so sorry, Tony. And— and Thor, I should apologize to him, too."
"'V'e, never done this before," Steve said brusquely, but he did spread his fingers ever so slightly, groaned at the sight of Tony's ass stretching around him, even as Tony's insides clung to him so tightly. Lube squelched wetly, loudly between his fingers, the most intimate part of Tony's body, so sweetly opening up for him. "'M not gonna hurt you just to get my dick in you a lit'le quicker." Tony moaned below him, almost a shout, and he whined and panted and shuddered underneath Steve, his cock finally hard and flushed and pearling with precome between them. "Fellas aren't s'pposed to be pretty," he murmured, dipping his ring finger into the lube on the sheets and adding it to the two already inside him, "but hell, hell Tony, I've almost never seen someone so pretty." Tony sobbed, jerked underneath Steve, and Steve rubbed soothingly at him, inside and out.
"Honey please," Tony groaned, vibrating under his touch. "Steve— Steve, please, I want to feel it honey, give it to me good slugger, I wanna feel it later when you're gone—"
—Steve was dripping with sweat, his hair clinging to his forehead and his face twisted up in despair, but perhaps the most surprising thing of all was the positively
, or that Tony was going to read more into this than there actually was. "Oh, Steve," he whispered, laving his tongue along the band of foreskin on his dick. Tony was an idiot, a goddamn idiot. Steve didn't want to be here (wouldn't be here if it weren't for that drug), and pretending he did was only going to get Tony hurt. "Honey, this doesn't— this doesn't mean anything," he rasped, and his vision started to blur from- from the gin. Maybe he should go get Jan, after all. "This doesn't make you anything you don't want to be," Tony murmured, and swallowed that monster of a cock down his throat before it felt too raw to do anything else.
"Oh God," Tony gasped, and he was certainly drooling now. He grit his teeth and moaned, tried to suck the spit back in through his teeth, but he could feel his beard, his chin all wet with it anyway. "S-shower and a blood test," Tony said, though he wasn't sure he'd be able to make it to the door to get the modified glucose meter Jan had rigged up for them. If he were being honest with himself, a nap sounded like a hell of a good idea at the moment.
Tony wasn't in his workshop. He wasn't in the kitchen, or his room, or any of the labs or the hangar bay. When Steve tried to call Tony it went straight to voicemail, and Steve couldn't tell if Tony's phone was off or he was just ignoring Steve's calls. Steve passed by the parlor and he could hear Jan and Wanda laughing at something on the television, could smell the snacks they'd piled up beside them. Steve hadn't been out of his room in over a week, but honestly he wasn't sure if he could handle being around people right now. His skin itched, and felt like it was two sizes too small for his body. Steve could feel himself start to sweat.
, Tony realized with a jolt of heat in his cock, digging his fingers into Steve's thighs as he sped up even further, the head of Steve's cock just barely slipping over his tongue before it was ramming back down Tony's throat, again and again with no sign of stopping.
"Shh, you can," Tony whispered, pulling up from his task momentarily to press a kiss to Steve's ballsack. His cock pulsed and twitched in his hand, and his hole felt cold and wet against the open air. He wanted Tony's mouth back on him. "You can honey, I promise, just a little bit longer, and then you'll be able to come, alright? Can you hang on for just a little bit longer?"
"I took advantage of you," Tony whispered, his eyes bright and wet. "Steve, I— I wasn't just doing this out of the goodness of my heart. I-I-I had u-ulterior motives, I took advantage of your predicament because all you needed w-was a warm body, and I—"
"Bad taste in your mouth, darling?" Tony teased, keeping the more salacious remarks to himself. An alert popped up in his HUD. "Your heart rate is spiking."
"And if I'd killed him?" Steve asked seriously, but he was watching the play of Tony's fingers on his wrist. "Would it still not be my fault?"
A yell burst out of Tony then, suspiciously high and wet, and he threw his hands in Steve's criminally short cut so he had something to hold onto as he shuddered through his release, spattering come all over Steve's fist and abs and cock. "Oh, oh,
Tony's entire body felt hot. He— he knew it was embarrassing, the big, heavy, bedazzled plug he bought on a whim. He didn't use it on himself all too often (really only used it when he was feeling particularly cock-hungry, when his body was aching and throbbing and not even his pills or booze could help); it was heavy, unforgiving steel that Tony needed to be in a particular mood for, and— well, Tony knew the jewel on the base of it probably revealed more about Tony than he was comfortable with but—
Steve had prepared for him. Tony moaned, and trembled, and Steve just shushed, rubbing at his lower back as he slid another finger in against the tight vise of Tony's body, crooking them up towards Tony's prostate.
"Good boy," Steve praised, effusive as he could make it, and Tony moaned, cock plumping up just a hair in his grip. "I'm gonna finish getting you ready now," he murmured, "and then I'm gonna take you."
"H‒hah," Tony panted, legs trembling. He felt ready; god, he felt open and gaping already, and Steve had barely put two fingers in him (never mind that Steve's fingers were huge on his own, but Tony had to take the dildo soon, and then Steve's
, lift him like Tony weighed nothing at all-), the other rubbing, massaging slowly at Tony's stomach as he began to grind up against Tony's prostate. "How 'ya feelin', honey?" Steve asked, low and rough. "Too much? Any pain?"
"Shit," Tony hissed, flipping back into the comms. "Hey Wasp? We've got an intact hard drive from one of the computers here, but we're going to need a decontamination unit as well." It was hard to tell under all the orange, but it looked like there was a flush rising in Cap's cheeks. "Sooner rather than later would be appreciated."
"Not great," Tony admitted, avoiding Thor's eyes as he grabbed another cooler to fill with food. "He's… he's kind of in and out of it. We're trying to wear him out, see if that'll help his body metabolize the drug faster." Gosh, when Tony said it like it, he sounded almost noble about the whole thing. Don't worry Steve! All this sex you don't have the mental capacity or choice to consent to is just so you don't die! That makes it all better, right? Tony's lip curled in disgust as he stared down at the cooler of snacks.
Steve flinched, and cleared his throat roughly, dropping his eyes down to the floor. "No, thank you, ma'am. 'M- I'd rather just run." He was out the door before Tony could say boo, the door slamming shut behind him, and both women in the room shot Tony a sympathetic look.
"God, Steve, whatever you want," Tony replied, and Steve gasped, hand sliding out of Tony's boxer briefs and Tony could've
Steve was doing a loop of the second floor (his room was still being… steam-cleaned, so Steve had a few of his things in a guest room for the time being) when he passed by Tony's room and heard—
"Hey, hey, killer," Tony soothed, both hands sliding up to cup at Steve's face. Steve could smell himself, the sharp, musky scent of his desire, and couldn't help the shudder that went through him again, wrapping Tony up in his arms like he'd get bored and leave if Steve didn't hold tight. "Hey, my love, hey, it's alright," Tony murmured, kissing his hair, his forehead. Steve could feel the hot brand of Tony's cock on his abs, inches from his own, but Tony didn't even grind against him as he kissed Steve sweetly, sensually, guided Steve's jaw open so Tony could lick into his mouth. Steve whimpered, let his mouth fall slack so Tony could just— take, what he wanted. It'd be alright if Steve let him take charge for a little bit, wouldn't it?
, Tony thought hysterically, biting on his tongue 'till he tasted blood and came, all over Steve's hand. Everything from his lips to his toes quickly became hypersensitive, bordering on painful, but Tony just kept rolling back against Steve, clenching down on every stroke so he could get Steve off. "I want— I want—" Tony choked wetly, those first few humiliating tears slipping down his cheeks and making him cough. "I want to be good for you," he finished miserably, the safest thing he could say with his legs still trembling and endorphins flooding through his central nervous system. Tony couldn't stop shivering — was sweating, but everywhere Steve wasn't touching him felt ice cold, and he alternated between crowding closer to and jerking away from Steve's touch. His face felt wet. "Please, please Steve, I just want to make it good for you—" Tony sobbed, clutching at Steve's hand and winding their fingers together. His skin was on fire. "Please, please— am I-I, am I good? Am I being good? For you?" Tony's brain was winding itself up more and more and he couldn't get it to shut off—
"It was—" Tony's tongue felt sticky again, and he smacked his lips, pressed a kiss to Steve's palm. "It was absolutely wonderful, my darling," Tony confessed. "Ten out of ten, would sub again—"
"Hey," Tony said, ducking down into Steve's field of vision; Steve startled to realize he'd sat down on the bed, hunching in on himself. Tony kneeled down on the plush carpet in front of him, one hand on the bed, ever so carefully not touching him. Tony was so careful — always so, so careful, from that first week (when Steve had fucked him
"I'm crushed," Bucky says flatly, his facial expression a scary cross between woeful and unimpressed.
"I feel like this is too good to be true," Tony whispered eventually, lips barely brushing the fabric at Steve's shoulder. Steve hummed, let his fingers drift up and down the far-too-prominent knobs of Tony's spine. "I'm not hallucinating, am I? Did I knock my head on the floor in the bathroom and give myself a concussion? Am I dreaming right now?"
and soft and comfortable) that he nearly forgot about the blood meter waiting outside the door for them. Someone (probably Jan or Thor, or maybe even not-Jarvis) had also left a thermos filled with that ridiculous calorie-shake that Steve drank sometimes, and another one filled with soup for Tony. "C'mon over here, handsome," Tony said sleepily, even as he was making his way back to the bed where Steve had his finger dutifully out for Tony to prick. "Shake first," he ordered, and sipped at his own warm soup while Steve chugged his calorie-laden beverage. "Okay." Tony clapped his hands together, inserted a test strip into the meter.
By the time Tony made his way to the gym, Steve had graduated from the treadmill to the punching bags. He was drenched from head to toe, and he must have been at it for a while considering how long it took for Steve to even break a sweat. As he watched, Steve reared his fist back, slamming it into the bag with a grunt; the bag split at the seams and sand started spilling onto the floor, and even Tony could see from the door that his knuckles were torn and bright red with blood.
Tony frowned, walked back over to his desk, and downed the rest of his drink. "I have an appointment," he muttered, grabbing his wallet and phone.
Steve huffed and kissed Tony again, soft and slow. Tony hummed happily, his toes curling, and snuggled even closer, his tongue darting out to wet at Steve's lower lip. Steve hummed, pulling back so he could give Tony one, two, three separate, slow, sensual kisses.
Steve jerked again, his cock finally hardening up between them, messy and wet at the tip, and then he was combing Tony's hair back with his fingers, rolling his forehead affectionately under Tony's jaw. "Good," he breathed out, messily petting at the nape of Tony's neck. "Tha's so good Tony, thank you," Steve slurred, dropped a kiss to Tony's chin. "Good boy, Tony, thank you."
, or unable to please his lovers, or anything like that. No one he'd ever shared his bed with had certainly complained.
"Look at you," Tony murmured, biting down on his jaw bone. "You're so needy, Steve. I'm barely touching you and you're still about to come all over yourself." He tutted at Steve, rubbing himself bodily against Steve like a cat. "Come on, now, I think you can hold off, can't you, champ? Put your hand back on your sweet, drooling cock, handsome."
"I'll go with you, darling," Tony started, gathering up his dozen or so tablets and papers and stacking them in his arms. "It'll be better if I just keep an eye on you—"
flexed and moved on either side of him, the soft golden hairs catching the light from the lamp on the bedside table just so, glittering. Tony could feel Steve's feet flexing into the sheets, his hands fisting the coverlet, the loud, jagged moans ripping from his throat as he pulled in and out, kept fucking in and out of Tony's mouth. His cock ached, and his balls were heavy and tight against his skin, and Tony had to physically stop himself from reaching down to jerk himself off.
"I know, baby, I'm sorry," Steve murmured again, petting Tony's hair. "I said I was just going to watch first, didn't I? But then I saw you all stretched out and I couldn't help myself." Tony whined, and Steve reached back, hit hot, wet fingers dragging messily along the underside of Tony's cock. He traced around the head of his dick, the sensitive ridges, the slit. "If you're very good," Steve whispered hotly into Tony's ear, "I'll let you suck me off before we're done." Then he wrapped the fingers of his free hand around the chain connecting Tony's nipple clamps and gave them a solid, sharp tug, just as he slid his fingers back behind Tony's balls, rubbing at his perineum. "You're so wet already, baby, can't you feel it?" Steve groaned, rubbing harder, before sliding back over the tight sac of his balls, his hot, jerking cock and leaking tip.
Steve hummed, grinned down at him. "I don't know, Shellhead," he murmured, massaging his palm lazily against Tony's full, bloated belly. "How many did it feel like?"
, Tony," Steve said, voice hushed. "You're so good to me," he continued then, lips glancing along the side of Tony's goatee. "Even I may need a nap after all that."
"Alright, you're green," Steve said, laughing; he kissed at Tony's hair and grabbed his hips with both hands again. "I'm gonna go one more time, okay? Sound good? Think you can hold out a little longer for me, baby?"
!" Steve snarled, grabbing a fistful of Tony's hair and jerking his head back so he could take a look at Tony. His eyes were red and watery, but it didn't look like he'd burst into pitiful tears like Tony had, so that was something. Steve's jaw clenched, his teeth grinding together, and he let Tony's hair go so he could run his fingers through it. "This has been an awful week," Steve admitted, and
Tony's eyes widened, so bright and blue and beautiful, and then his lashes were fluttering shut, his hips rolling back. The soft opening of his rim caught on Steve's cock, and he choked, fire burning in his lungs and his veins, then the head popped in, and Steve was gone, he was so very very
"Y-y-yes-s," Steve stuttered, shivering and rolling his head against Tony's neck. He clung even tighter than before, his thick thigh and calf muscles flexing on either side of Tony's hips. "Oh, Tony,
Steve did flinch then, jerking his head to the side so he could stare at the wall a few inches from his doctor's face. "Fine," he grunted.
"O-oh," Tony gasped again, squirming a bit under the touch. When Steve massaged a little harder, pressed his fingers just a bit deeper, Tony moaned, curled his toes against the front of Steve's boots. "Oh, Steve—"
— please, harder," Steve begged; he mouthed at Tony's neck, his tongue darting out to lap at the salty tang of sweat on the tightly corded muscle there, letting his teeth just barely scrape the skin. "Can I— another? Another finger?" he asked, canting his hips back. He grunted, and Tony could feel him pull his shoulders a little straighter, tangled around Tony as he was. "Another," Steve ordered, and slid his hand down so he could urge a third finger inside of him.
"No," Steve replied, shaking his head. "No, this was good," he reiterated, brushing an errant curl out of Tony's eyes. "Thank you for giving this to me, Tony."
Steve was breathing heavily now, barely a hint of blue left in his eyes. Tony felt his cock throb, and he had to moan at Steve's words, pressing the heel of his hand to his dick, still trapped in his slacks.
—" Steve heard him say, so very clearly, and Steve was horrified, even as his hips started fucking faster and faster, the wet sounds of their bodies meeting echoing around them, so— so lewd, and loud, and perfect.
They’re waiting in the common area when the other four get back. Wanda especially looks tired and Vision gets up to lead her to a sofa, fussing softly over her. Tony groans and takes a chair, rubbing his shoulder as Steve and Natasha head to the kitchenette.
‘You know, I think I might head to the bar,’ Bucky says, face tense again and a little green at the two youngest members’ antics.
A/N: Hi everyone. I wanted to update mid week but work got a bit insane so I'm doing a double update this weekend instead. I'll probably do the same next weekend as well and then see how many more chapters I have left to write, I'm about halfway through writing at the moment.
‘NOW!’ Loki forces his brother to turn and marches him towards the facility. ‘Inform us if there is anything else you need us to do.’
After three more obstacles, during one of which Flash had apparently found himself brave enough to make a joking comment on Peter’s lack of ability, Steve takes them to the last one which also happens to be Peter’s favourite.
It’s peaceful as they walk along the path, rows of stones stretching away into the field. Neither of them says much, just happy to be away from the compound. Eventually, though, Tony stops and turns off the path; three rows back, set slightly apart from the other stones around them, sit the graves of his parents.
‘But if you were to take someone as consort who was not a Jotun, or who could not produce an heir, you would be leaving behind a succession crisis and that is not going to help keep things stable now,’ Bucky finishes quietly for him.
He looks down and starts fiddling with the bits of suit on the bench. ‘Well…he’s a bit older than me so I thought you might not be too happy with that.’
‘If we can get all the stones together I can use one of my gauntlets like Thanos did with his,’ Tony says. ‘Where did everyone get thrown?’
‘No, Steve, I’ve already had all this from Tony I don’t need it from you too. You two want to wallow in self-pity over the fight, let me wallow in mine.’
‘He made me kill you,’ he finally admits. ‘He,’ he hiccups and continues, ‘I shot a web and pulled on something and I looked down and it was the reactor. I looked up and it was just like being back in Wakanda. Except this time
‘How am I going to get this up to you?’ Bruce muses, realising the kid is out of arm’s reach. Then he spots a chair and goes to grab it. ‘If I get one of your arms free think that’ll be enough?’
Peter scowls at him. ‘Who made you my babysitter? I’ve got enough of them already thank you very much.’
Tony sighs. What is it with him becoming the resident shrink at this place lately? ‘Wade, he obviously thinks there’s something to be interested in. My advice from personal experience? Try not to let your head get in the way.’
Peter’s gone bright red to the roots of his hair and he hides his face in his hands. ‘I can’t believe this is happening.’
Thank you so much to everyone who has left comments and kudos! A big thank you as well to everyone who is sticking with this story, I really appreciate it and the responses I've got from this story are incredible. I hope you continue to enjoy it.
Tony frowns at him as he hands Sam his drink and returns to the bar for his and Bucky’s. ‘Just a bad meeting, Rhodey. I’m not being slowly poisoned if that’s what you’re asking. Unless Ross’ voice counts,’ he adds as he hands Bucky his glass and collapses into one of the armchairs.
‘Well it was fun when I realised I was going to be alright, but yeah wasn’t much fun before that.’ He comes over and starts explaining some of the other parts of the suit, then Peter takes a section over to a work bench to take it apart. ‘Hey kid?’
‘Who are you talking to anyway?’ Peter asks, coming into view, mask in his hand. ‘You’re not on your phone.’
Tony stands next to T’Challa as Thor brings out the Yule log, which apparently was one of the branches they’d cut off from the tree they used to make the table. Honestly as far as Tony’s concerned it just looks like a normal log to him. But whatever, symbolism and all that.
‘Thanks Mr Wilson,’ the kid says, stealing the ball from his hands and jumping off, throwing the ball to Bucky as he does. Tony feels his heart jump into his throat as the kid gets closer to the ground, and only breathes a sigh of relief when Steve manages to catch him before he hits the ground.
‘I can’t cope if they’re going to be like this all the time,’ Bucky grumbles, heading towards the piles of pizza and pulling out a slice.
‘Because you’re going to need them to get up to the top,’ she answers. ‘Think Rocket will be able to help as well?’
May’s expression says she doesn’t believe him. ‘You’re not trying to get people on your side by pulling that innocent act are you? You know, the same one you used to pull on me and Ben when you were young?’
So there I am, minding my own business, disembowelling enemies like a pro, because let’s face it I’m the best pro out there at disembowelling people, when I see old Star-Spangley-Suit give Tin Can the last stone. I’m not going to lie he looks fucking awful. Like seriously worse than when he had all that palladium poisoning shit. Worse than me when I came out the other end of that polar bear. And that was
Rhodes just ignores him and turns to the soldier. ‘Give me the key Sergeant and I’ll get them both out of your hair.’
‘Peter! How many times do I have to tell you not to throw things in the lab?’ Bruce huffs. ‘This is not Tony’s workshop!’
‘Yes,’ Valkyrie answers for them, ‘we are looking for a ship that might be able to take us somewhere we can get a weapon to help defeat him. Do you know of anyone who could help? He is threatening another world and could threaten the whole universe.’
‘Wong I want you to hold him in place with your magic,’ Steve says. ‘Tony, Wanda, Vision I want you to put all your power into him. We need him gone. We can’t risk keeping him for questions.’
Thank you so much to all of you for the love and support you've shown this series and this story. Please, please do let me know what you think of these last two chapters and I will be responding to those reviews I haven't already as soon as I've posted this.
Outwardly he rolls his eyes. ‘How do you think I got to this stage? By ignoring those memories? Just get on with it Night King.’
‘Yeah when we were younger and you were thin enough for the guys you picked on to use as a tooth pick!’
‘I thought you were saying you wanted to find ways to beat me up, now you want me to save your arse?’
As they turn to leave the office Tony turns to him with a grin. ‘If I’m Prince Charming does that make you Cinderella?’
he actually feels. ‘I’ve never been very good at letting people help,’ he points out quietly. ‘Just ask Nat: “doesn’t play well with others” remember?’
‘Hey! There you are!’ he looks up as Wade hurries towards him down the corridor. ‘I was wondering where you’d scurried off to Spidey.’
‘So tonight I want to say thank you. Thank you to all of you who are there when we aren’t. The ones that come along and clean up our messes and make sure there is still a world that needs saving.’ Rhodes finishes with a salute which Steve notices all of the soldiers return, before walking off to a much more genuine applause than any that had come before.
‘That looks genuinely terrifying,’ Betty mumbles next to Peter, looking over the assault course. She looks at him out of the corner of her eye, leaning closer and whispers. ‘Can you do that by yourself?’
‘Oh no, Colonel,’ Loki grins, ‘I’m afraid a couple are ones you will be more than capable of doing.’
‘Drakov’s daughter? The hospital fire?’ Loki feels a sinking feeling in his stomach, something like guilt.
‘Thanks for the vote of confidence, Ned,’ Peter rolls his eyes as they reach the door to the bus and climb on; he spots MJ at the back and gives her a wave.
Steve chuckles. ‘I think Natasha’s doing a good enough job with her glare if the speed that Wade’s hands have gone back up is any indication.’
‘I assume the same thing I am,’ another voice, this one sounding decidedly upset, pipes up as another man in a red suit climbs over the fire escape of the building. ‘Didn’t realise Spidey had asked for your help tonight too, Red.’
‘That’s my job, Ms Parker,’ Tony says quietly. ‘If we can work together we can keep him safe.’ He’s very aware that Peter can probably hear everything they’re saying but he doesn’t let that stop him. ‘When I heard Peter was one of the hostages I’ll admit I was scared. I was scared he’d do something, well incredibly
‘FRIDAY talk to me,’ he mutters, landing and walking slowly towards Peter, taking in the vest hanging around his torso and the gun pointing at his head. The kid is refusing to meet his gaze which is worrying him.
‘Well at least they’ve agreed to the plan,’ Tony sighs in relief, ‘I’ll admit I was expecting Steve to be a little more stubborn about it. He usually is unless he’s the one who made the plan.’
‘And we appreciate it,’ Steve pats him on the shoulder. ‘Right, Thor, you’re in charge. How are we getting this tree down?’
‘Your tribe is not ready,’ he smiles and nods in understanding, ‘my country was very similar, it took a civil war for them to realise we could not shut the world out forever and that it would eventually find its way to us. I hope you do not have to suffer a similar fate before your tribe is willing to look to the rest of the world.’
As always please do let me know what you think, or if there is anything you'd like me to add or relationships you'd like me to explore a little more and I shall see what I can do.
‘You’re telling me,’ Natasha frowns at him, ‘that you suggested using the law firm and you knew Matt Murdock was Daredevil?’
Wade huffs a laugh and stands up, holding his arms open for Peter to gently throw Cooper safely into his arms. Underneath him Lila starts jumping up and down wanting her turn as Wade sets her brother down on the ground and he comes running over again.
‘Mr Stark?’ Tony can’t tell if the kid is asking him to be on his team or save him from the former assassin who seems hell bent on becoming his new best friend.
‘Hans Gruber it is,’ he says, putting in the DVD. Just as the titles start up there’s a knock on the door. ‘Who the fuck interrupts Die Hard?’ he mutters to himself.
‘Merry Christmas, Nat.’ Tony grins as Clint follows his two children into the common area, Laura bringing up the rear with Nathaniel balancing on her hip.
Please do let me know what you think of this chapter, I really do appreciate hearing what you think about what is working and what isn't (even if I am being terrible at responding!)
Before Flash can form a response one of his friends calls his name and he goes to join them. Peter’s shoulders sag in relief. ‘Thanks for the help there, guys.’
‘Of course he agreed to it,’ T’Challa says calmly. ‘Secretary Ross needs to believe he is in charge or none of you will be able to go home. What will happen is we will extract Sergeant Barnes and return him here if it looks as though the healing process will not be completed.’
‘Yeah, but this way there’s less whining,’ Steve smirks, giving Peter a hug. ‘See you soon, Spider-Man.'
He opens one eye and cracks a smirk. ‘Nice get up. You here to save me from the evil government men, Agent Romanoff?’
‘Why does the Spiderling not climb through the ventilation system to retrieve the flag whilst we distract them?’ Thor suggests.
‘This is Wanda, she’s like my big sister, so she’s your Aunty Wanda and she has magic powers like Doctor Strange does, but she didn’t have to do lots of studying to get hers. She can be really annoying though, and she likes to hold my upside down if I’m getting the better of her in training; but she’s one of the most amazing people I know and the best thing, which we’ll do with you when you’re older and you come to visit, is when we have a duvet day and we curl up and watch films with tubs of ice cream. Sometimes we watch rom-coms, and other times we watch horror, which isn’t so much fun, and then other times she’ll let me put Star Wars on and we’ll have a Star Wars marathon.’
I grab hold of her hand and squeeze. Tight. Until even she is grimacing in pain. ‘You touch him and I
‘Just a bit of light reflecting off something, probably just from the window of a bus driving by or something,’ he replies. The waitress arrives with their drinks and interrupts any more conversation until she leaves.
‘Now you’re getting it, Spider-Man,’ Steve’s a little out of breath but Peter can tell he’s coming in for another attack. They continue to dance around each other, Peter doesn’t attack as regularly as Steve, waiting until the man is close enough for him to guarantee landing a hit before he retaliates, not wanting to waste energy.
The trickster laughs. ‘No I suppose you didn’t. I should start by saying you look beautiful tonight, my dear Widow.’
‘Then he also told you I’d told him I liked you,’ he presses a kiss to Steve’s lips, feeling the man relax under him again. ‘You do realise we’ve just made Bucky sound like the biggest slut out there right?’
A/N: Hi everyone. As I said before I'm doing double updates each week; this is instead of posting the other story mid-week as I originally intended. Basically work hours are going up and down all the time and I'm not sure when I'm going to be writing, so although I want to give you guys more story each week I want to be careful I don't lose all my backlog too quickly.
‘Can we get him to come back every time Wanda gets like this?’ Vision asks, phasing through the wall as he leaves the room.
‘I said I was sorry!’ He takes her offered glove and sets about changing the grenades loaded into it and makes a couple of changes to the targeting system. ‘So what has you coming for my charming company today?’
Tony can’t help it, the kid looks so scared he pulls him into another hug and presses a brief kiss to his hair. ‘You’ll be fine, Pete.’
‘I don’t want it to get worse, not for Ned anyway. I mean, if Spider-Man can’t take a couple of scraped knees then what-’
‘Let me make a couple of calls,’ Tony says, ‘we’ll get SI’s legal team on this. I want to make sure we don’t miss any loop holes. The bastard is going down, but we’re doing it so he’ll never be able to come back up. I need to get Rhodey to speak to the President as well.’
‘I don’t care to test it. Neither do I care to experience the lecture I shall receive from Wong should it happen.’
‘Thank you! Thank you so much,’ he hurries to do as he’s told. ‘If you every need anything at all Mr Murdock just let me know.’
‘Is he always this loud in a fight?’ Loki asks. ‘I assumed the last time it was due to him having immense amounts of frustration to release.’
‘But-are you- I mean…’ the teenager looks at the badge in his hands. ‘Are you sure? I mean…how do you know I’m not going to screw it up?’
Thor wanted to cause as few headaches for his friends as possible, including not having Tony take on building regulations on his behalf.
‘Tell Shuri sorry about the window,’ he says, blasting apart the window to the lab and setting Wanda down. There’s not many aliens left, but Proxima Midnight is stood in the centre wielding her staff like she was born with it in her hands.
‘What’s going on- oh that explains it,’ Peter and Wade come up from behind to find out why they stopped. ‘Did Bucky wind up Sam again?’
‘Hello everyone, welcome to our school event and thank you to parents and friends of the students who are giving their presentations here today who have come to support. We have six students giving presentations that they have given as part of their schoolwork, their teachers have been so impressed that they’ve been nominated to give them today. Now, I’ll hand over to our first student, Miss Emily Howard, to give her presentation from her science class.’
‘Starting to feel a bit offended here, Steve,’ Tony mock-pouts. ‘You saying you’d rather spend time with Hydra than with me?’
Natasha breathes a sigh of relief once the door to the car closes and she slumps in her seat, closing her eyes against the thumping in her skull.
‘One it doesn’t take a genius to work out you’d be worried, despite those two only having found out because they were part of your ‘bestie’ group and were spending more time around you anyway-’
‘Missed you too, Steve,’ he mutters as he pulls the phone from his ear. Looking over at the bar as he flips the phone closed and puts it back in his pocket, deciding he’s earned a whiskey. A large one.
‘You’re not useless to me,’ he tells her, ‘I never had a friend to come back to before, you have no idea how much that’s going to help when I’m in there. I’ve got you to lean on, Wanda, even when you’re not there next to me.’
"The only thing that's gonna make me leave this hospital room is a call to Assemble," Steve promised, and fed the head of his cock into Tony's tight, wet, beautiful hole. It slid in with a pop, smearing lube all around his rim and Tony whimpered, gasped into his forearm as Steve just laid there for a moment, let the both of them adjust. When he moved, fucked his cock a little further in, Steve grunted, had to pet his hand over the bare skin of Tony's thigh. "Oh sweetheart, you feel so good, I-I, I don't know how long I'll be able to hold off—"
"Bullshit," Steve said. Tony started, and Steve pressed a soft, sweet kiss to his mouth, puke-breath and all. "I love you, you dipshit. I didn't just say it because I was drugged, or because you were
Steve made no mention of it, however, just kept petting his hair as the water and fluids made their way out of him. Tony whimpered, his abdomen clenching, and just sat on the edge of the tub while he emptied himself out. After a minute, the cramping subsided, and Tony could feel nothing but the cool air of the bathroom ghosting around his hole, and he collapsed against Steve with a groan. Maybe he could just nap, here, for a minute.
"That's a boy," Tony praised, and Steve felt the shocking pleasure of it down in his bones. "Now rub on your messy little cockhead, sunshine — that's right, get it even more wet and sticky for me, Steve." Steve moaned, sucked at the spit he felt pooling in his mouth, and rubbed his fingers against his head, jamming his thumb against the slit and bucking up from the intensity of it.
"Am I going to have to walk barefoot out of this facility?" Tony said with a heavy sigh. "Someone could at least bring me a martini if I can't get my slippers."
Steve's smiled widened, and he leaned down to press one, two, three soft open kisses to Tony's mouth. "Feelin' full, fella?" he teased, drawing slow circles across Tony's stomach.
"You don't have to do that," Steve said, shaking droplet-covered bangs out of his eyes with a wry, quirking grin. "My uniform works just fine as it is, Stark."
"I love you," Tony gasped, his eyes fluttering shut against the wave of raw emotion welling up inside him.
"Oh God, oh God, Shellhead‒ Tony," Steve moaned, blissed out of his mind. "Oh honey, you feel so good."
"Face wash, I know," Steve called back, dipping into Tony's enormous shower to grab the tube from the ledge.
. He whimpered, his chest heaving, and dug his nails into his palms, buried his face into Tony's neck. "Tony—" he gasped out. "
"I do," Tony whispered, feeling something shudder and release in the center of his chest, like his sternum was about to vibrate right out of him. It was all Tony ever wanted— "Steve," Tony whispered again.
, Steve Rogers, who— who swore too much, whose best friend wore dentures because his teeth all fell out, who talked better with his fists than his words most days. Steve Rogers, a ham-handed, bumbling oaf a man, and sweet, suave, wonderful
Steve hummed, but it sounded almost amused, and he didn't chastise Tony for his chatter, so he couldn't be too terribly upset with him. Steve loosened the buckle at his jaw, tugging off his helmet so he could yank a dart out of his skin. "You'd think they wouldn't have left in the middle of this—" he started to say, but then his jaw tightened and he whirled around, fist swinging, just in time to get an Erlenmeyer flask to the face. There was glass in skin and blood pouring down his face, but Steve just bared his teeth at the spitting Russian, slamming his fist straight into the guy's plastic safety glasses.
I do it covered in foul-smelling  inertial-dampening gel. Just because I'm a little multi-colored right now doesn't mean you have to be scared to touch me."
Tony was worried. He had a text from Jill saying she and Jan were working on synthesizing some type of counteragent for the drug, but no progress had been made as of yet.
It took him a minute to answer, and Tony nearly cursed aloud when he noticed the time. "Good morning, darling, so sorry to wake you. Would you be a dear and push my chemo appointment back to Friday? I anticipate I'll be incapacitated for a few more days." He had a few more directives for Jarvis: make sure everything was still on track for the new treatment plan, when Steve's next thermos of calorie-fix would be delivered, things like that. Eventually, there was nothing left to talk about with his butler so Tony let him go with a sigh and a small frown. Lulls were never easy for Tony, he just... wanted to make time move quicker, wanted the drug to run through Steve's system faster, wished he'd at least thought to bring a damn book or tablet so he could actually work on something until Steve needed him again—
"I've got your number now, Stark," Steve murmured, cock rubbing just under the curve of Tony's buttocks, slippery and wet from the copious amount of precome he was leaking. Fingers slipped between Tony's cheeks, tugging at the base of the plug nestled inside of him; Tony gasped. "Yeah, that's it," Steve praised, fingers falling off and returning slick and cool with lube, smearing between his cheeks, all around and inside the edge of Tony's rim. His body had clenched up tight around it, but Steve was patient, persistent, almost lackadaisical in the way he fingered lube inside of Tony, how he gently rocked and eased the plug out of his body. "Good boy," Steve hummed, and Tony felt the shock of that phrase all the way down to his toes, the way his body relaxed and loosened and his head rolled back into the crook of Steve's neck as he shook and panted.
Tony and Steve shared a look. It wasn't often they could both be genuinely surprised on a mission these days, but trust Clint Barton to be the one to do it. "I daresay my dear Hawkeye, I think that's the most I've heard you say in a month," Tony teased, albeit gently.
"Awful," he agreed, spitting another mouthful of yellow-orange saliva on the cement. "'S just the adrenaline. 'Happens after a fight." And well, Tony supposed that made sense in a fight-or-flight type of way - just because the fight was over before it even started didn't mean that rush of adrenaline would magically disappear right along with it.
," Tony cried, his chest heaving as Steve's hot, wet mouth swallowed up and down the length of him, wet and messy and drooling down his groin and his balls. "Oh god,
, was the damndest thing: Tony's cockhead, flushed and dark and red, like sweet cherries, bobbed and twitched above his neatly groomed hair that would've got him called a sissy back in his time (Well, maybe not for the hair, and maybe not
"I don't say anything I don't mean, Tony," Steve murmured against his lips. He cupped Tony's jaw, softened it so they could make out again, a leisurely twist of tongues and soft, spit-slick lips. "Y'think I'd fluff you up just to get a good suck?" Steve's hard, heavy cock bumped the underside of Tony's balls, skidded against his perineum and slid against the crease where his ass met his thighs. Tony made a soft, wanting noise. "You've earned everything I said tonight," Steve promised, dragging his tongue down his chin to mouth at Tony's jaw. "Now let me take care of you, yeah?"
, even though that was the point of the whole damn thing, its unrelenting back and forth motion, how it drilled against his prostate, the vibrations singing along his inner walls. Tony hiccuped and, humiliatingly enough, felt tears pricking at the corners of his eyes, even as Steve repeated
"There we go, darling," Tony soothed as he kept massaging Steve's hot, tender insides. "That's perfect."
, like he was swimming through sweet cotton candy, warm with the thick, pulsing heat of Steve between his thighs. He never wanted Steve to leave. "Feels so
, and he luxuriated in the strong smell of Steve, so close the base scent of him: something spicy and a little earthy and warm. When Tony relaxed his throat, let his fat cockhead knock against the back of it, Steve swore furiously, a sharp "
. "Sorry about that - I'll make you a better one next go-around," Tony promised, politely turning to the side when Steve started on the soaked, clinging-to-the-skin leather pants.
His cock still hurt, but here, in the heat of Tony's body, his orgasm building up in his gut and his balls, it seemed almost bearable.
"And w-what‒" Tony managed to say, "what might that be, stud?" God Tony felt appalled at himself ‒ Tony was
. I— have wanted you for a very long time." Steve sighed, brushing Tony's bangs from his face. "You seem to be thinking I'm this paragon of all that's good and right in the world, and I am
Tony hummed, felt his eyes flutter shut, and the next time he felt Steve's hands they were in his hair, slick and slippery, and Tony could smell the spiciness of the shampoo Steve used all around him. It felt heavenly, to have Steve scrub at his skull, to feel his huge palm covering Tony's eyes so he could rinse the shampoo from his hair. Surprisingly enough there was conditioner next, some soft and delicate scent that had Tony slipping deeper and deeper into the soft hazy sweetness he was feeling. "Do you want to stay in the bath for this or go to the toilet?" Steve murmured, and it took a minute for Tony to hear it, to be able to lift his head up and blink gingerly up at Steve.
"It didn't really do much the first time," Jan sighed. "What about dialysis? Give his kidneys an extra boost to help flush out the toxins."
Tony's breath left him all in a rush, and he sobbed, pressing his face further into the bed so he could buck back against Steve again. "Thank you, baby- thank you-"
"I know we already have one," Steve started almost shyly, "but I took the liberty of ordering a new one for the occasion."
Steve's thumb caressed the edge of Tony's clavicle. "I know I'm not— not supposed to bring this stuff up right now," he admitted, pulling a grimace. His other hand was petting Tony's hair, curling through each individual strand and lighting up all of Tony's nerves. "I know we're supposed to talk about it outside of— of this, but—" Steve's eyes fluttered shut, the tendons in his throat working as Steve tried to gather up the courage to continue. "I want something for, for just the two of us. I—I would like for you to have a piece of me," Steve whispered, his big beautiful gold lashes fluttering against those gigantic and sharp cheekbones. "Something that makes you
. This— they hadn't talked about something like this happening. Should Steve get up? Was he supposed to be doing something different? Steve felt his mind waking up, trying to push itself up out of the sluggish haze he'd somehow fallen into without his noticing. He needed to— Surely, he'd done something
Steve took a second to tuck that little nugget of suggestion back for future use. "Well," he said then, mouthing lightly down the side of Tony's throat. Tony's breathing hitched lightly. "Remember that package I ordered awhile back? It came in. Everything's been fitted and dry cleaned." Tony was very, very still in front of him. Steve smiled;
"Then don't tell him. He's not gonna find out because I'll be home in 48 hours. I promise. Cover for me?"
Steve just grunts, sentences not forming in his near-fucked out brain. He nods half-heartedly, but realises that Tony was going to need real words. "I'm okay," he manages to choke out.
Tony jerks awake, causing the suit to swerve turbulently. He narrowly misses the Empire State before FRIDAY reboots the autopilot and restabilises the titanium-gold alloy suit. The red and gold beauty instantly steadies, hovering majestically above the clear New York City evening skyline.
“Let me,” Tony said, kissing the tip of Steve’s nose. “Think.” Then below Steve’s left eye. “About it.” Tony’s chastely pressed his lips against Steve’s and it quickly became open-mouthed. They kissed hungrily, devouring each other's tongues like a main course. After a while, Tony pushed at Steve's chest to communicate, breaking the kiss.
After a moment, Tony calms down and removes himself from Steve's arms. He takes off his glasses to pinch the bridge of his nose. "Fuck. That never goes away does it?"
"No, hang on a minute – I’m not, I’m not kicking you out. You don't have to go. I just, I just don't feel so good right now.”
Tony remembers easing into a broad chest in silent acquiescence and feeling Steve's cock, hard and heavy, pressed between their bodies. His own erection was throbbing and if their last tryst was any indication, Tony remembers that Steve was not shy to ask for what he wants.
"Four year old son of a genius and master tactician - 1, master tactician himself - 0," Tony jokes, showing no remorse over his bad habits.
, no less - nearly three years waking up in a different century and Sam decided at that very moment that no matter how excruciatingly awkward this topic was for him, he was going indulge the super soldier like a good friend.
"Hi," Tony says shakily, with a half-smile framed by his neatly trimmed goatee. Judging from the specks of snowflakes peppering his perfectly coiffed hair, shoulders and parts of his cashmere pea coat, Tony had walked over here under the snow. The combination of his striking good looks and downlight shining from above made him look like an angel with a soft halo.
"We haven't even agreed on a name!" Tony suddenly remembers as he slaps his cheek that Steve immediately kisses.
“No no no stay please,” Tony blurts, reaching out to grab Steve’s bicep. “I was just. It’s not you, god, please don’t go. It’s just early - for me - and I haven’t had coffee. And you're you. You’re in my bed. Naked. My uh brain just needs to catch up.”
Tony whistled, crossing his arms and leaning against the large couch as his eyes scanned the half naked perfect specimen from top to bottom.
“First of all,” Steve starts, his pitch higher than usual. “There was no pre-nup and we married two weeks later than intended because your lawyers wouldn’t stop calling you to change your mind about it. Second of all, I am not a jealous man. I happen to acknowledge that you’re a catch. I’m allowed to be a little territorial over my fella,” Steve argues, tightening this arms around Tony, trying to earn his way back into his husband's good graces.
to find him despite looking like he's taken the worst beating Tony has seen Steve take (even the Chitauri battle didn't leave Steve hospitalised). If that wasn't enough cause of concern, the man decided to show up at the Avengers Tower one evening, unannounced and having beaten JARVIS' security measures, to confess the crimes of the Winter Soldier.
and given up his Avenging, bow and arrows and life on the run under heavy gunfire, to instead wield a kitchen knife and occasionally suffer the wrath of a malfunctioning power tool. Laura's biggest regret, she told Tony, was that Clint needed to be the father their kids would grow up knowing.
It was just after the final briefing before the mission, Steve had stayed back in the meeting room to go over the mission strategy for the umpteenth time, even though he had given specific orders to each Avenger as to their roles once they breached Sokovian airspace. Of course, like all previous HYDRA base raids, Steve was well aware that even the best strategies required heavy improvisation.
bad. Your anxiety attacks have gotten worse to the point that you're passing out - I don't think I want to ask if it's happened before in the suit because you wouldn’t admit it would you?"
Steve smiles as his hands peel away Tony's that were resting on his shoulders, linking around his neck. Without breaking eye contact, he places Tony's hands on his thighs, gently massaging them against the strong muscles as he spreads his legs wider and wider. This was an invitation and nothing else.
“Okay,” Peter whines, finally putting away his bricks before crawling into his father's lap. Three mouthfuls of veggies later, the plate was wiped clean. Tony makes his way back to the kitchen to hand the empty plate and fork to Steve, shooting a triumphant grin.
Tony bites his lips to stop himself from reacting. He recognises the voice alright, but the frustration behind it? Oh that was something he was very accustomed to experiencing back in the Tower. Everyone on the team including Tony agrees that Steve was an unbearable clean freak. His mother henning was just as bad as his obsession with tidiness. So Tony could easily guess what was going on.
Tony sucked cock like a champ, not that Steve had any previous experience getting a blowjob to compare. Tony engulfed the head again, this time moving the tip of his tongue over the slit to swaddle the supersoldier's super precome that was leaking like a faucet. He sunk down again, took the full length of Steve down his throat, breathing through his nose. He hollowed his cheeks as he sucked and swallowed Steve's cock like a lollipop and Steve used all his strength from keeping his hips from thrusting into Tony's throat, conscious of his strength.
The sorcerer supreme looks at Tony flatly. He spreads his hands towards various areas of the kitchen counter, in particular the corner where Tony was bent over half hour ago. Tony breaks into a shit-eating grin but says nothing.
He wasn’t even sure if that was accurate information, but since all the blood has traveled down south, Tony was prepared to walk into de-brief late and take full blame and responsibility for Captain America walking funny that day.
Of course, Tony had to take things too far and personal once again, his criticism of the "element of surprise" approach being as dated as Steve seemed to hit a raw nerve. His final jibe caused the usually level-headed captain to clam up and storm out of the gym without taking his shield with him.
The otherwise quiet countryside came alive with the merry sounds of children laughing and screaming for their father's attention, the baby giggling as he bounced from parent to parent. Laura was still a little apprehensive though, but Tony knew she only needed time to forgive, forget, and let her husband back in. After everything that has happened, she earned the right to hesitate and guard her heart.
, Strange will portal Peter out of here before you and I can even blink." Tony's eyes fast became glassy, his voice cracking. "You know how I am about this, Steve, we talked about this, we talked about New York and I can't, we can't let anything happen to our son, I won't let it happen again, I can't -" Tony was babbling incoherently, his lungs suddenly rapidly failing him -  a sign of his anxiety creeping up on him. Steve instantly detects it and holds Tony in an embrace with his hand over the back of Tony's head.
Tony blinked away the heat and sudden moisture in his eyes. "N-no darling," he whispered, biting at his lower lip. "That's not why I'm here."
"Hmm?" Tony asked, smiling against his lips. He spread his legs a little further, and Steve could see the folds of his robe slide apart, just barely make out the half-hard swell of his cock resting against his freshly-waxed sac. The ties dangled forward as he moved, brushing against Steve's cock in his pants, jutting out obscenely from his hips. Tony's eyes followed the motion and he grinned, dragging his knuckles up his shaft, circling his fingers around the wet, sticky fabric. Steve moaned and clutched at Tony's biceps, shuddering in his grip. "Yeah, tiger, you're hard," Tony murmured, nuzzling the crook of Steve's neck. He pressed his hand more firmly against Steve's dick, massaging his palm to the head. "You're all wet and hard for me, darling," he whispered heatedly. "You're positively
And that was the fucking kicker wasn't it? Tony shook his head, over and over, tried to reach down and wrap his fingers around Steve's dick, but it was soft, just lying there limply against his thigh and that just sent another rush of humiliation through Tony, another wave of tears to his eyes.
"Y're thinkin' too much," Steve mumbled, swiping out and dragging Tony down to snuggle beside him. "Y' need the sleep more than I do."
Tony nodded. "How comfortable are you with anal, darling?" he murmured, fingertips sliding against the cleft of his ass. "I don't— don't have to fuck you, or anything, but a little bit of prostate stimulation works wonders, a-and it can be rather intense."
There was something he needed to talk to Tony about. This was— this was something he should say to him, Steve thought very deliberately. "Not a bad thing," Steve whispered, brushing his knuckles to the back of Tony's face, gentle against his jaw and bruise, and then he reached back down and dipped a finger in, quick but not hard, just too fast for Tony to overthink it or tense up. Tony made a noise that made Steve's cock perk up in interest, and he rolled his head back.
good, peaches." Steve pulled his fingers out and Tony immediately wanted to whine at the loss, but then Steve was shifting over, presumably reaching under the bed for the ramp cushion they sometimes kept under the bed‒
nearly made Steve flinch back in his seat. "You should let the doctor take a look at you, Steve," Tony said gently, so gently it made Steve sick. "I pay a lot of good money to staff people who can handle the type of injuries you get."
"O-oh, I don't know whether to make a boy scout joke or be hilariously turned on right now," Tony whispered, a little awe-struck, his lashes fluttering as Steve dribbled a bit of the lube over Tony's cock, tried to feed it into his stuffed slit to lessen the burn Tony had to be feelin' right now.
"There's a— ah," Tony called back, unsure, suddenly why he felt so embarrassed. "There's a— a hose in the bag."
!" Steve shouted, his voice booming in the empty room, sitting up and dragging Tony with him. He brushed at a clump of tears on Tony's cheeks. "Tony, you're
Steve smiled then, something rare and precious and beautiful, and it clenched the quiet, secret, squishy parts of Tony to see it. He ruffled a hand through Tony's hair, helping him to stand up and lean against the wall so he could move to strip the sheets.
It was just… a bit humiliating, he supposed, the self-proclaimed playboy Tony Stark feeling inadequate because his dick looked tiny compared to Captain America's. Tony sighed in resignation, turning away to grab pull open one of the transport crates when Steve's hand shot out, fingers lightning quick snapping around Tony's wet, sticky arm.
There was a knock at the door and a soft "Hey, Shellhead," and Tony was flying across the room before he knew it, wrenching the door open and‒ Oh.
"I'm going to give you another finger, Tony," Steve murmured against the back of his neck, and Tony jerked and whined in his arms, trying to spread his legs even farther apart, trying to accommodate all of Steve as he pressed his pinky into Tony's ass. "Gotta make sure you're nice and open for me, Shellhead," Steve whispered, a low rumble deep in his throat. Sweat was dripping down Tony's hair, his nose, pooling at the base of his spine. Steve had to be in similar shape ‒ he always got so worked up when he was working Tony open, called it a damn
Steve sighed and stared sadly at Tony over their joined hands. "That doesn't mean I'm gonna stop worrying about you," Steve murmured, "Or being upset when you get hurt."
"Yeah?" Steve asked, all wide- and glassy-eyed, his cheeks flushed a pretty coral pink, and Tony wanted to just kiss him, to feel the warmth of Steve's desire on his lips, and how sick did that make him? A normal person—a
big, but he sure felt like it, filled practically to bursting, like if he opened his mouth, all the come and lube would come spilling out of him.
Tony's face transformed then, the bright blue of his eyes taking on a new light as he beamed up at Steve. He stretched up, cupping Steve's face between his hands so he could give him a warm, open kiss. "Darling," Tony sighed, nosing across Steve's cheek. "There is
Steve bit his lip against the sudden well of emotion, nosing into Tony's hair and breathing in deep. "Love you, Shellhead," he whispered tightly. Tony's breath hitched.
Tony shivered. No, he didn't want a break, he- he wanted to keep going, he wanted to keep bringing Steve off, wanted to feel the evidence of Steve's pleasure swirling and rolling inside of him. "S' seven now," he slurred, lifted his hips back to meet Steve's. He felt so thick, and full, and
"I was hoping you'd say that," Steve said, smiling brightly as he leaned over and pressed a soft, lingering kiss to Tony's lips.
not fifteen minutes ago. Tony chanced a glance down, and yeah, sure enough, his dick was hard, the tip of his dick messy and wet, flushed a deep purple with blood.
"Was' a sick kid," Steve said with a shrug, spinning the attachment onto the hose. "This was pretty much the cure to everything back in the '30s. You wanna stay in the tub for this?"
you to be here," Tony seethed, gritting his teeth against a sudden dry heave. "That's kind of the point of not returning a bunch of poorly-spelled text messages and turning off one's phone."
Images of Steve jerking off assaulted Tony's traitorous, overeager mind. He'd probably treated it like he did everything else:like a mission, like a
"Takin' down the bad guys is the only perk I need, Stark," Steve replied, and he sounded almost fond as he finally peeled off his pants and briefs and kicked them in the corner with the rest of his clothes. "Now let's get that armor off'a you."
Tony shook, but kept his thrusts slow and shallow. "You're— you're not too sensitive?" Tony rasped, whining as Steve tried to suck on his tongue. "Steve you just came like three times, you usually need a break—" Steve shook his head, rocked them both with the force of it, and clenched down tight on Tony's cock. "
That was simple. Steve was a soldier —  he was good at following orders. He took hold of himself, lightly, and began to slide his hand up and down his dick at a glacial pace. Tony was still laying beside him, one hand cradling the back of his head, the other just resting across his waist. He tangled his legs with Steve, tucked his head in the crook of his neck. "Beautiful," he whispered, watching Steve barely touch himself. "Go a little faster, sweetheart."
Tony made another noise, something soft and high and wanting, and then he was sliding forward, softening his jaw and huffing through his nose as Steve's cock slid further into his mouth and down the back of his throat. Tony moaned, felt the tremor of it on his tongue, had to put his hands on Steve's knees to steady himself. It was true, all of it. As much as he loved to talk, he loved sucking Steve's cock more; he, couldn't help himself, really. Everything about it — from the smell and taste of him, to the way he felt in Tony's mouth, filled him to choking, sometimes, to the way Steve hardly ever let himself go, was always so, so gentle and careful with how the two of them made— made love.
"Tony, Jesus," Steve hissed, and Tony felt Steve's cock twitch inside him. "Jesus, Mary, and Joseph—" And Tony could hear Steve reach blindly out, and the click of a cap, and then there was soft, slippery-cool lube being pushed up against his entrance. "You're gonna hurt yourself," Steve sobbed out, but he was pushing more lube up into Tony, slicking it against his cock, bucking his hips up in mindless, jagged jerks.
"Honestly, I hesitate to give him much more of anything right now," the woman, Nguyen, admitted, reaching out to manually take Steve's pulse. She looked at her watch and frowned. "We've given him enough to put down an elephant and then some, and his heart rate is still climbing. I'm afraid if we give him much more, it could shut down his entire central nervous system."
Or it'd shut his body down, Tony thought with a sharp pang in his chest. That's why he was in his room, hiding away like a wounded cat waiting to die. "O-okay," Tony acquiesced, "but what about more running? They said that physical activity helped abate the symptoms, right?"
"You don't have to be here for this, darling," Tony murmured some indescribable time later. "I'm well aware of the picture I make."
," Tony moaned aloud, felt his jaw slacken and his head tip back as he waited for Steve to slip his fat, throbbing cock between Tony's lips again.
Steve pulled him a bath, poured in all the sweet and spicy soaps that Tony loved to luxuriate in, cradled Tony against his chest and between his thighs. They'd been together long enough now that Steve could use the fine mechanical trimmer to neaten the edges of his goatee that had softened over the course of the day, could practically do it backwards and blindfolded and certainly behind him in the bath. There were sports drinks on the lip of the tub for the both of them to drink when they had time for their more active scenes. Steve would drink any of them, but his favorites were the yellow and light blue flavors, Tony had discovered, so he made sure to stock extras of them all around the mansion and both their bedrooms.
To his right, Steve was lightly dozing, eyes flicking back to Tony every so often as Jenna and Terrance worked on waxing the thick golden hair from his calves and thighs. He breathed deeply through it, as if it were nothing more than tickle (though, knowing Steve, it probably did only tickle, the bastard).
Tony was panting now — little hitching breaths that ended in a whine, high in his throat. He buried his face in his pillow, tangled his leg in between Steve's like he could actually fuse them together if he tried hard enough. "I-I won't—" he gasped, fingers tapping an unsteady rhythm on his thigh. "I won't come, honey."
of the lube cap echoed loudly in the room around them, and Steve watched with wide eyes as Tony reached a shiny, wet, dripping hand behind him. There was something he'd wanted to say to Tony, certainly, but now all he could focus on was the slick wet sounds of— of Tony—
"веселиться в аду," he spit at them, right before he started seizing and his eyeballs exploded in his skull.
