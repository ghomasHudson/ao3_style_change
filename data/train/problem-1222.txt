“Anything yet,” John asked as he walked back into Lestrade’s office. They’d been waiting for Mike to get back to them for hours until John decided to go get them some coffee. It had gotten so late they were ones of the only people still there, save for some stragglers.
“Why are you causing so much trouble? You asked to speak to me,” John said, his voice rising in agitation and volume.
“Of course you can. You want to help dear Lestrade don’t you? And all those people who’re in danger?”
“Yes. They found that she was strangled by a piece of rope, meaning the rest of them probably were as well.”
“Still, I didn’t think that secretary of his would let you back in without his permission. I can’t imagine she didn’t get in a fair bit of trouble last time.”
“On behalf of Sherlock Holmes.” The noise of the bustling city outside the phone booth all seemed to stop and all John could hear was the sound of his own labored breathing.
“This case just becomes more interesting by the minute,” Sherlock said giddily, causing the other two to share a grimace.
“No. He agreed that the killer has to have inside knowledge of you, but unless someone knows you personally, there’s no way they could know about Carl Powers.” Sherlock grinned darkly at his guest. John felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end and his stomach twirl in anxiety.
“Well, I was just here yesterday. Do I really need permission again?” The woman mulled it over for a moment before she shook her head.
John didn’t stay in the hospital long after he quit the yard. He went back to his cramped unit housing where he hid out until the media finally decided he was old news and left him alone.
“I wouldn’t put it past him,” he said, rubbing at his hair like he did when he was annoyed. “John, would you mind going to his flat and ask him about it? We can’t have him consulting on cases if he’s going to break the rules.”
“You didn’t let this happen,” Lestrade said quietly, not knowing what else to say. John laughed humorlessly.
Fifteen minutes later John was pulling up to an apartment complex that he somewhat recognized from the few times he’d been there. After no more than a few seconds a tall, dark figure slipped out onto the sidewalk and got into the car before pulling out his phone without a word.
“Excuse me, Mr. Watson,” a nasally voice called out. John stopped in his tracks and turned around to see Dr. Anderson walk towards him with a deep glare. “What on earth do you think you’re doing here,” he demanded.
“I have to call Greg. I have to tell him to get Mike on it,” John mumbled to himself as he stood up from his seat and started walking towards the exit, his hand already fishing out his cell.
“Slide it through, won’t you,” Sherlock asked, waving towards a sliding box to his right. John hesitated before walking up to the box and sliding the file through. Sherlock picked up his smell when he neared the air holes cut into the glass wall.
“You’re looking well. A few more wrinkles and deeper bags under your eyes, but that’s to be expected.” Again, John didn’t answer.
The first thing John felt was the burning of where the knife had pushed through his skin and into his stomach. He knees wobbled and finally gave out, but he was caught by Sherlock’s free hand, holding his trembling body to his own. John reached down and weakly tried to push away the hand that held the knife in vain. In response Sherlock simply pushed it in deeper, causing a wet pop sound and more blood to spill out and soak his sweater and pants.
“We know we didn’t find all of your victims. He just hasn’t gotten to Jeffrey Patterson yet,” he said lowly.
“Well the last victim was Sarah Sawyer, a doctor who had been friends with Sebastian Wilkes. Before that there was Henry Knight, nephew of Bob Frankland. Then Kenny Prince, Martha Hudson, Soo Lin Yao, and a woman named Rita Davies. We don’t know her connection to any of the cases but apparently her relative Carl Powers had drowned in 1989,” Lestrade explained.
“You caught me, John. Before I stabbed you. You knew it was me. You’ll find him before he gets to you,” he said in a sweetly sincere voice.
“Bored of killing? I doubt it,” Sherlock said with a chuckle. John shot him a glare before the killer spoke up again. “It’s because you got close. He knew you were looking into the hacker angle, that’s why he’s speeding things up. You got too close.”
“She didn’t have a phone. We’ve already searched her person and looked all over the building. There’s no phone.”
“Yes. Just like you. I do hope you get to feeling better soon, detective Watson. Evening,” the man said before he hung up. John kept the phone to his ear until the buzzing of the dropped call sounded. He slowly put it back on the receiver and made his way out of the booth before he limped the rest of the way home, keeping an eye out for anymore strange behavior as he went.
“Ah yes. Dear Lestrade asked you just as I had requested. Tell me, how long had it been since the two of you had spoken? Did it upset you that he didn’t contact you until he needed your help,” Sherlock asked, glancing over the annoyed man.
“Thank you, doctor,” John said, eager to get out of the building and as far away from Holmes as possible.
“He was clever enough to find out,” Lestrade argued. John sighed heavily. “I’m just saying, maybe we should take what Sherlock says with a bit more scrutiny.”
“Nothing,” John grumbled out before the two went to join Sherlock. They found him hunched over the body of a woman dressed in all pink, a small magnifying glass in his hand.
“Wait, how do you know-“ John was cut off by the sound of the man hanging up. He stared at the phone for a long moment until a knock sounded at his door. He and his cane walked over and answered it to find Lestrade standing outside, looking tired but happy to see him. “Greg. What, uh, what a surprise,” he greeted.
“You’ll want to track down her number and trace her last call to the location she made it,” Sherlock said as he walked past her back into the hallway.
“Her wedding ring. The rest of her jewelry has been cleaned regularly, but not her wedding ring. The inside is shinier than the outside, meaning it’s regularly removed; the only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger,” the consultant said in one breath, moving around the body while he spoke. “It’s not for work. Look at her nails, she doesn’t work with her hands. So what, or rather whom, does she remove her ring for? Clearly not one lover.”
“Mike’s smart and he’s got a good team. Even if they can’t track the hacker I’m sure they’ll be able to find evidence that it happened.” John nodded and took a long drink. Lestrade stared at him, a question in mind. John raised an eyebrow at him when he noticed.
“Are you working the cases of multiple murders? Are they related to Sherlock Holmes’ crimes in some way?”
“Evening,” he replied, not bothering to look up at him. John sighed and pulled back onto the street before he headed over to where Lestrade had said the body was found.
An ex-officer? No they changed the passwords far too often for that. Someone with access to an officer’s computer and information? Maybe, but that’d be tricky. The thought consumed John his whole ride back to London.
“You know where John is now? He’s in surgery! God only knows if he’ll survive! But I’ll tell you what.” Lestrade paused to stand up from his seat and looked over the smirking killer. “If he dies, I’ll kill you. You won’t last the night. You hear me?”
John said nothing, his heart caught in his throat. He met Sherlock’s eyes and though he wished he could look away, he found himself trapped in their gaze. For a brief moment he thought he was going to faint, but a deep breath cleared the idea away. Sherlock simply continued, not giving his discomfort any mind.
“Nice to see you too,” John said, as the investigator rushed off. He made his way to Lestrade’s office where is desk looked eerily to how it looked the last time John was in it; the night he’d gone to see Sherlock at his flat.
The next morning John found a blown up picture of himself on the front page of his newspaper. It had been taken years ago right after the trial when the media had still been hounding him. The bold text above it read “ex-detective meets with killer”. John flipped through the pages until he landed on the story.
“You lied about the hacker lead! We checked, there was no evidence of anyone hacking into the yard!”
“Just that this one was like all the others. She was found in an abandoned building so she was obviously lured.”
“Shh.” John sat back in his chair with an internal sigh and waited for the ex-consulting detective to finish reading. It took nearly twenty minutes before he finally flipped the file shut and turned to face him with a sly grin. “Well, you held up part of the bargain. Now for the second half. What’s your theory?”
“Well I’d say I was the closest thing to a friend he’s capable of having,” the man said with a chuckle.
“Your file,” Sherlock purred as he dropped it back into the sliding box and slid it over to John, his eyes on the limped man the whole while. John looked down, not willing to meet his eyes and took the file before he started his walk again. “See you soon, John.”
“You just come back here when you’re done.” With that, he unlocked the last door keeping John from the monster who had ruined his and so many other’s lives.
“I’m becoming a bit slow. Perhaps it’s due to a lack of mental stimulation,” the prisoner mused to himself.
“Of course not. Just take my key card,” The doctor said with a smile. The man grabbed the card off the counter top and threw her a smile.
“It was more than one mistake. People died because of me, Greg. How can I go on calling myself an officer if I let this happen?”
“It’ll be strangulation, just like the others. In fact, I doubt they’ll find anything new,” the passenger said as he pulled out his phone and began typing away again.
“What do you mean? You said it yourself that they found one of his hairs at the last crime scene,” John asked.
John survived the surgery but was in a coma for almost five months. Lestrade was relieved that he missed the trial and all the publicity that came with it. In the end, they were only able to pin eight murders on him, though Sherlock continuously hinted at there being many more. But the viciousness of each crime was enough to put him away for life without possibility of parole.
“I see she still doesn’t like you,” John said to Sherlock quietly, trying to make light of their conversation earlier. Sherlock gave him a smile as he waited for John to take off his own coveralls.
“Yes, that’s how he knows about the victims, but how does he know about the details of their cases? How does he know their address to kill their neighbors, or their family lineage to kill their relatives?” It took John a moment to catch on, but when he did his face lit up with realization.
“Yeah, I just… what I said last night. I shouldn’t have assumed. This case is just wearing me down and I’m just worried about putting you in harm's way,” he said, his eyes filled with exhaustion and guilt.
“He’ll go free. We don’t have any evidence. All we have is your word. Now tell me,” John said, trying to keep from begging. Sherlock eyed him for a moment before he stepped away from the glass and started pacing his small cell.
A few moments after John left, Sherlock stretched his arm out under the blankets, reaching for him. When he realized there was an absence of a warm body, Sherlock grudgingly opened his eyes. He growled low in his chest at the absence of his John and huffed softly. Gathering the comforter around him, he took it with him into the bathroom and started the shower.
“Thanks. Bye.” John waved slightly, taking a few steps backwards before swiveling and walking down the street away from Baker Street.
Sherlock gaped after him as John stood, wrapped himself in his dressing gown and walked out into the kitchen. After a minute he scrambled up himself and threw on his dressing gown and went after him. “John! You don’t get to walk away from this conversation!”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “John. I thought we did have this conversation four days ago. It’s not a problem. You’re overreacting.”
Once his daughter was settled, Sherlock turned his attention back to disinfecting the groceries and to John. “With all due respect, John. As her father, I am authorized to make these kinds of decisions. Do not doubt my choices.”
John nodded. “There’s another pile bags downstairs. I’ll be back in a mo. Hello, sweetheart!” He waved his fingers at Rosie who had hopped up and come to stand next to Sherlock’s leg, holding on to his trousers.
Shaking the thoughts from his head, John put on a smile. “Well, this time you aren’t in trouble. But it is still serious. But not a bad serious. More of a happy serious.” When he realized he was rambling, John clamped his mouth shut, gathering his thoughts. “Well, at any rate... It’s fine.”
With a startled laugh, John grabbed Sherlock and pulled him down to sit on John’s knee, grabbing his face with both hands and kissing it all over. After a few moments, he realized there had been a metal tinkling sound and pulled back from Sherlock. “Did...did you drop the ring?” he asked, barely stifling giggles at the whole situation.
Sherlock watched her tiny pink swaddled feet ascend the stairs to her room until they were beyond sight and settled against the counter, folding his arms, waiting for John to return. Once he re-emerged at the top of the stairs with the remaining nappy boxes, Sherlock gestured at the groceries on the floor. “Now, do you care to explain yourself? This is hundreds of pounds worth of groceries, cleaning supplies, and child supplies, John. What the hell were you thinking?”
“This just feels like such an overreaction, John.” Sherlock leaned back slightly. “Is it really necessary?”
Sherlock huffed. “Absolutely not. Anything you want to say to John, you can say to me. I’m not leaving you alone with him.”
Sherlock took a step towards him tentatively, a hand reaching out to him. “Are… you having some sort of stroke?”
With a dramatic sigh, Sherlock peeled himself off John’s back and trudged back into the living room.
Sherlock straightened, and he knew he was supposed to be searching for the ring, but as soon as he saw John’s arse presented in front of him, he lost all sense of logical thought.
“Well, well.” Sherlock broke the silence with a smirk. “It’s nice not to have been the one to blow up the kitchen this time. How the turntables.”
“I know.” Sherlock ran a hand down her back before he closed his eyes, aching for the missing piece of their family. “I do, too.”
“Good riddance. I’ll be glad to have you to myself for a while.” Sherlock waved a hand and picked a triangle of toast off John’s plate. He looked up and paused at the expression on John’s face. “What.”
Sherlock blinked, his face entirely blank. He blinked again, his hand tightly closed around the ring in his fist. With a slight tremor, he brought himself back online. “You—” He swallowed. “You want
From the moment he was born, his life had been one wreck after another. From his parents being them to dealing with Harry to his time serving in the army to nearly dying from being shot to finding Sherlock and
John hesitated. “Not for a while, I’m afraid. But you have Papa here to keep you company. You won’t really miss me that much.” He winked at her.
After a moment, Rosie scrambled to her feet and pattered towards him, slipping her tiny hand into his.
and then suddenly having him again. Then, going through everything with Mary and Eurus. Not to mention the nightmares or the manipulations or being numerously threatened, kidnapped, beaten up, shot, drugged, blown up, nearly set on fire, and dumped into a well to drown. His life was a mess. He was a mess.
“I was wrong to say what I did. You are here for her. For both of us.” Sherlock watched him quietly.
John did not disappoint and kissed him tenderly if briefly in greeting before nuzzling his face in Sherlock’s hair. “Hello, darling.”
“Shit. And we were so careful in getting it all up…” John stood immediately and went over to him. “I’m sorry, baby. Here.” John helped him sit in John’s seat and knelt in front of him. “Give me your foot, love.”
“I’m holding out for a hero until the end of the night. And he’s gotta be strong. He’s gotta be fast. And he’s gotta be fresh from the fight.”
“Jesus, I’m not keeping you hostage, Sherlock. It’s to protect us, protect you, protect Mrs. Hudson.” John sighed and turned towards the sink, turning on the water and washing his hands.
She shook her head and fumbled with the plastic. After a moment, she looked at Sherlock shyly. “Papa, please help?”
Sherlock grimaced and reached around John to pick up a piece of bacon. “Boring. I don’t like it when you have to talk to me about something. Always means I’ve done something unfortunate.” He grabbed another piece and walked around the kitchen table and plopped himself into his seat.
John said, “Sherlock, from the moment we met in this room, you have transformed my life. You cured my limp,
As the light from the windows landed on him, illuminating the sharp curvature of his cheekbones, the deep green blue of his eyes, the smart curling of his hair and the contrasting smooth sharp lines of his clothing, he smiled and his long coat swirling around him in the doorway like a cape. He stood in the doorway, his eyes meeting John’s and John felt his knees weaken at the sight of the beautiful strong man before him.
“I’ll go. I’ll go to the shops tomorrow and pick up whatever you need and drop it off by the front door, okay?” John ran his hand over his face, rubbing at his eyes. “Please, just stay inside.”
Suddenly, Sherlock swept into the living room, fresh from completing a case, his cheeks rosy and his eyes bright.
“Sherlock…” John took a step forward, bouncing on the balls of his feet. “This is hard for me too. I want to touch you so much.”
. His hands shook as he silenced the phone. John checked over his shoulder to make sure Sherlock didn’t wake to the sound. Sherlock shifted softly in the blankets but otherwise remained asleep. Carefully crawling out of bed, John headed to the kitchen. Once in the hall, he took a deep breath, trying to calm his nerves before starting the more elaborate breakfast he had planned, all of Sherlock’s favorites. Toast with honey, bacon, and 3-minute eggs. He just hoped that he could get it all done before Sherlock woke up.
Mycroft folded his arms. “My brother, against all reason, has quite clearly fallen in love with you.” John looked immediately to the floor. “I see you are not unfamiliar with his feelings. Why, then, are you putting him through this? Giving him hope that you might someday return his feelings?”
Once John had left, Sherlock was finally able to focus, successfully completing his analysis in record time. He reached down for his phone and clenched his jaw in frustration when he realized he must have left it at home. And John had left…. Shit.
“Then why won’t you let me touch you.” Sherlock raised himself up on his elbow and looked down at John. “You don’t let me touch you at all anymore. Have I done something to offend you with the way I do it?”
“Yeah, well, I would rather not listen to your stomach grumbling all night, alright? Just eat the rest of your food then you can come to bed.” John left and went into the bathroom, closing the door behind him, leaving Sherlock standing in the kitchen, holding a takeaway container in his hand and looking after him.
“Yes, that’s right, because Daddy is very brave...  That’s why he’s not here right now. He’s being extremely brave and helping those who are sick and saving their lives.”
“You’re acting strangely, John. Are you feeling alright?” Sherlock munched on the bacon pieces. “Bring me more bacon!”
Watson nodded, bouncing up and down on her toes as she peered out the window. Sherlock glanced at his wristwatch and checked his phone, propped up on the desk to record Rosie’s performance. The clock switched from 19:59 to 20:00 and he hit record. “Alright, Watson, go ahead.”
. After scanning the instructions further, John turned the oven on and set it to preheated to 230°C, separated the racks inside, and slid a large glass Pyrex pan into the bottom. He closed the oven and nodded.
“I can’t.” John pushed past him and headed for the door before pausing and turning around. He came back to Sherlock and pressed a firm kiss on his cheek. John lingered for a moment, his eyes closed, absorbing the feel of Sherlock’s skin beneath his lips, the warmth of his body against his own, the smell of his skin. “I’m sorry.”
“It looks painful.” Sherlock peered at it. “Would those lines be uniform across healthcare workers or does it vary based on the brand of mask?”
“I’ll be up in a minute!” John trudged up the stairs, burdened with another enormous load of grocery bags full of more canned goods, boxes of pasta and tea. He unloaded them onto the floor and moved to go back downstairs. “I’ve just got a few boxes of nappies downstairs still to bring up.”
, Sherlock realised that perhaps it was time for a walk. John had said walking was acceptable if proper safety measures were taken, and it was legally allowed at the moment. What a fool he had been for not taking advantage of that opportunity until now.
Holding tight, John prevented Sherlock from getting up. “It’s fine, Sherlock. We can’t have lost it. We’ll both look for it, ok?” He helped Sherlock stand before getting onto all fours instead, starting to scour the floor for the glitter of brushed gold metal.
After breakfast, Sherlock took Rosie into the living room to play while John got ready for work. Once he was ready to go, he stood in the doorway of the living room, watching them for a moment. “I love you; you know.”
The taxi pulled up at the crime scene in Lambeth 15 minutes later and Sherlock told the cabbie to wait and walked over to where the yellow tape strung between the tall metal fence next to the Beaconsfield Contemporary Art museum, blocking off part of the pavement that led to the black fenced area next to the building in front of the elevated train tracks that ran behind the museum. Sherlock stood in front of the tape, pulling on the disposable latex gloves John had given him the evening before. There were only a few officers posted around the scene, but Sherlock could see Lestrade and Anderson next to the body. Sherlock stepped forward to move under the when an officer coughed into his hand before grabbing the yellow tape and lifting it for him. “Mr. Holmes.”
Sherlock took a deep breath and looked down at Rosie in his arms. “I think your father has lost his mind.”
He stood up quickly and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist. “Love, what’s...what’s wrong? What did I do?” He leaned back and brushed the curls out of Sherlock’s face.
. He followed and maneuvered himself in front of Sherlock as they headed upstairs, purposefully guiding them to the lab where they first met.
“Then what, pray tell, is the problem.” Mycroft’s tone sharpened. “I hope you realise what will befall you if you harm my brother again.”
season and Sherlock was very committed to the saga. John had finished the last two episodes of season 6 the previous night while Sherlock had been too engrossed in a new pathology book that had finally arrived in the mail to possibly take a break from it. If Sherlock took the time while John was baking to catch up, they could move on to season 6 tonight.
“What if I can’t wait five minutes?” Sherlock ducked around John’s elbow and sidled up behind him. He buried his face in John’s shoulder. “Mm. You smell good.”
John barreled out the door and it slammed shut behind him, leaving Sherlock on the stairs in his dressing gown.
“Rosie and I played hide and seek this morning before breakfast, then she played with her horses until lunch. After lunch, we watched a bit of telly. Then we played I Spy out the window until I had to make dinner. After dinner, she played with her horses for a while again until it was time for bed. I read her a book and put her down. She misses you.”
“No, I apologise.” Sherlock murmured. “I know things are chaotic at the hospital. It’s not your fault.” Sherlock separated the groceries into two piles, one for them and one for Mrs. Hudson.
“Oh. Right.” Sherlock hesitated before scooping up their plates and carrying them into the kitchen. “I’ll just put this away then.”
“Oh no! I’ve gone and bungled it. I’m sorry, John,” Molly whispered, her eyes glittering, even as a frown formed on her face. She turned towards Sherlock and raised her voice “If you’ve already solved the case, why do you and John head out to Angelo’s for a bit of an early lunch? I can make sure to close up here for you.”
Debating on whether to join Sherlock on the sofa or tidy up the bedroom, thoughts of sliding into stiff sheets that night moved him towards the bedroom. He would have just enough time to tidy up the space and get dressed before the dough was ready to go into the oven.
"Let's hear: how did you come to this conclusion?" he asked, leaning forward, resting both elbows on his knees.
-John! Jack and Emma are here!"  called Sherlock as he approached the stairs leading to the doctor's bedroom.
-That’s true, but I trust you; I know you won't make mistakes this time- he said as he settled into John’s chair. -Now how about making me happy and eat something? -
In the short period of time that the two men spent alone in the apartment, Sherlock carefully observed every move of the doctor, as was now his custom, losing himself only briefly in his own Mind Palace for quick deductions and considerations on the day just passed,and it was at the very end of one of his moments "of absence" that he found a cup of tea placed on the coffee table at the right distance so that he could reach it only by stretching his long arms.
He had been pulled away by the man in the photographs and had only given him one last look before walking away with him.
-Why not now? - urged Sherlock, more and more annoyed that he was the only one who didn't realize what had happened in that room.
-Ok, but I'm sure you'd like to... I'm just asking you to be patient, and I promise you that over time I'll be able to say it out loud- John promised.
We will talk to Baby Girl and promise that we will take care of her and the little girl: she is only seventeen years old and can still have a future if she wishes and if she has someone taking care of her.
It was useless to pull it for any longer: he had come there, so now he had to deal with the problem and suffer the consequences that would come.
-Go to hell Jack! We’re only ten minutes late- Greg retorts as he heads to the kitchen to lay the takeaway boxes.
It was precisely that tone that had so often framed him as a child: it was with that voice that she convinced him to tell her where he had hidden Mycroft's books or where he had built the nest for mysterious eggs that he had found the day before in the garden.
I thought it would be better for Baby Girl if he wasn't here, plus Molly and Dimmock need to practice-answered Sherlock from the kitchen.
Between them there had always been an ambiguous relationship, bordering on obsession, and the doctor admitted with himself that, excluding the severed parts in the refrigerator, he would change nothing: it is difficult to find someone who adapts so well to your habits and your quirks, especially at such a mature stage of your life, and that you complete yourself with its peculiarities.
For his part, Sherlock had focused his attention on Hamish, trying to improve his skills as a parent, taking long walks around London alternately explaining where they were, which ones were the best restaurants in that area, how many murders  had been committed in that neighborhood, how many had been solved thanks to his intervention and then starting a detailed description of the one he considered his "masterpiece".
In the short seconds before the gate was fully opened, Greg glanced at his image into the mirror, unable to hold back a grimace at the sight of the deep dark circles under his eyes and the stubbles that covered his chin and cheeks.
You will make your mistakes, you will learn, and the next time you’ll know the right thing to do- she said in a calm voice.
When they returned to Baker Street that evening, it had taken ten minutes to climb the seventeen steps that would lead them to their apartment: the kisses that had begun in the entrance hall, while impatient hands stripped the other of the superfluous layers of clothing, had continued on the stairs.
When he distanced himself from his thoughts, John noticed that Sherlock had just finished paying the bill and for a few moments was tempted to protest, but then he remembered the main goal of that dinner and just looked up at his companion.
-You're the most beautiful creature I've ever seen... - he whispered, raising his head to meet Sherlock's gaze, his pupils fully dilated for desire. -And you're mine...-
-Your steps on the stairs... The endless cups of tea... Your sweaters that are as much part of you as the Glock or your first aid kit- continued Sherlock.
"Stay out of my life" John said, with what Sherlock always identified as "Captain" John Watson’s voice.
I do not deny that I will keep an eye on his growth and everything related to him, but I will never interfere with your choices or in his life- Irene answered serious.
"It's amazing how he could have gotten so tired when his main activities all day were eating and watching the animals from the baby carrier" John said.
"You're going to be all mine" said John, standing up and approaching the detective, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s neck.
Sally shrugged off that comment, trying to hide her wounded pride for the umpteenth time and sticking on her face the usual harsh expression that has always been her mask against Sherlock's attacks.
“Well, in this case I’ll let John do most of the work for both of us" Jack said before bringing the bottle back to his lips.
The black-haired man turned a little and saw his mother sitting in the place that until recently had been occupied by him, during that conversation so unusual and important that had totally changed the relationship between Sherlock and his doctor.
- How come an attractive man full of interests like you is still single? – John asked him bringing a new piece to his mouth without taking his eyes off the face of the detective.
The next moment a new song rang out in the kitchen and almost at the same time, John felt Sherlock's presence behind him; he closed the fridge door and turned slowly and found himself stuck between the detective and the kitchen cabinet.
The next moment the screen zoomed in on a section and in the room echoed the fetus' heartbeat, causing tears to rush down Baby Girl's cheeks.
On that "enlightening" thought, Mycroft  quickly turned away, leaving the room and moving towards his own office, honestly proud of how he had handled the situation and the speed with which he had found a solution to the problem.
He clasped his fingers around the door handle and simply turned it to the right, certain it wasn't locked: Sherlock never locked the door of the apartment.
The young waiter nodded his head and turned his back on them, clearly headed to the kitchens in search of Angelo.
Mycroft frowned and squeezed the phone between his elongated fingers, taking it a short distance from his face: attached to the text there were two pictures.
A life full of friends, his work, the chance to fall in love with a quiet man without too much trouble and completely unable to make even the smallest deduction.
Letting slip a sigh through his open lips and, hoping to be in a favorable position to have a decent view of the room, John opened his eyes, looking at a wallpaper he had seen every day for the past four years and half and that damn framed periodic table.
-Okay, but now you're together and believe me, from what I saw the other day, it's obvious that you're both dying to have sex- Sally commented almost ruthless.
-Before I left, you were always eager to tell me every little, useless thing about you, so why do you want to leave me out now?" he asked again.
He remembered perfectly that he had arrived at "Pride" with Greg and Jack and was astounded to find Sherlock there, perfectly at ease in that place as in any other situation he had been involved in.
Trying to get away from the human tide that distracted him and prevented him from thinking quietly, John snared into Gerrard Street in the heart of Chinatown, where he had come with Sherlock many years ago during the case of the "Blind Banker".
The detective shrugged his shoulders and the next moment John started the episode, and for a few minutes the silence fell in the room, until the Doctor appeared on the screen.
John was moving away from him for the umpteenth time, and Sherlock had no idea what to say to change his mind.
"Do I have to remind you that you had a long line of lovers while I was away?"- Sherlock pointed out to him.
-A girl? Since when do straight guys go around looking for a quickie with another man? - Daniel asked curious.
If he had been busy or in another building, you would have let me know before I arrived- he answered.
"Not until tomorrow" she said, approaching the cabinet above the sink and taking some dishes and placing them next to John.
-Yeah, me too...- retorted John with the same wry smile on his face- She was annoyed that things were not going as she wished; but I think she's now over it-John added.
Molly looked up from the folder she was examining and stared at the detective, still intent on studying the sample.
After taking a small sightseeing tour and waiting for Mycroft and Greg to arrive, the three settled into one of the living rooms.
I was the one who forced him to eat, to sleep, to help him overcome his nightmares, who slept with him and who sometimes went to clubs with him, but he was always careful not to show too much or expose too much of himself.
The British officer shook his head slightly, as if he had to recover from his partner's words before following him to their room where Gregory was throwing some clothes into the trolley in the middle of the bed.
With the same uncontrollable curly black hair, the pale face with pronounced cheekbones, the mouth with perfect lips.
-That's why you're the optimist of the couple and I'm the realist... What will happen to us, Gregory?" Mycroft asked again.
Mycroft allowed himself to be guided to the living room trying not to give much importance to the detective's words and to see them for what they really were: the attempts of a cheater to distract the partner's attention from their betrayals.
-I hope so! It’s late, and I'd choke him with my own hands if he woke Mrs. Hudson to take care of Hamish just to come after me. What the hell happened to you? - John asked, following his friend down the corridor that connected the entrance with the living room.
Hands against the shoulder pad of the sofa, Sherlock kissed him again, with greater tenderness than before, moving slightly on his legs, causing a pleasant friction that led John to clench his fists in the expensive and delicate fabric of the detective's shirt, before he moved his hands to the front and start unbuttoning it.
John stared at him with an incredulous expression on his face, his breath held back and a new stiffness in his muscles.
At those words a switch snapped into Sherlock's brain, instantly freeing him from the jealousy that had so far sparked and fueled that conversation: his eyes looked at John, almost saw him now for the first time and noticed how everything from the posture to his gaze,  indicated detachment, coldness and found himself sincerely wondering what he had said up to that moment.
-We have a lot to work on. We have to learn to work together again, understand what our limits are as a couple and above all I will have to get used to Hamish.
-Hey, I don't think I offended you when we were talking about your relationship with John - the inspector scolded him.
-Are you sure you can't give me five minutes? I'm sure I know the right methods to make you relax- he said, raising his head a little bit to stroke Mycroft’s neck with the tip of his nose.
The smile on John's face grew even bigger, and the next moment the doctor took the few steps that separated them and stroked the lapels of the detective's coat with his gloved fingers.
If it was Mike who died suddenly, perhaps attempting suicide, John would have been sorry, he would have missed him, but he would not have come to destroy himself physically and psychologically as he had done with Sherlock's suicide.
John licked Sherlock’s neck with his tongue, leaving some red marks behind him with his lips and teeth, making even more evident his desire to show the whole world that that wonderful and perfect man was His, lingering on the point behind the ear where he clearly felt the Sherlock’s scent, closing his lips around the earlobe and biting him almost forcefully when Sherlock's body arched beneath his making their erections collide, before laying his forehead against Sherlock’s right shoulder.
Those thoughts hurt Mycroft even more: looking for a replacement, Gregory had not sought someone who was up to his standard but had wanted someone completely different.
-This isn't the first time you've declared your feelings for me, despite your self-proclaimed sociopathy.
"You don't know how much I'd like to punch you right now" Greg said without looking away from his unexpected guest.
-Of course you are! But you're charming only with me... Or when you're questioning one of your suspects-answered John.
"During your absence I thought about how many times things between us could have gone differently if only I had said or done something different, if I had let you deduce my feelings for you" he said sincerely, looking back at the black-haired man’s face.
“And how many have you ID’d to this killer through that profiling,” Sherlock asked, his smirk broadening.
“Yes. My therapist thinks it would help for me to see Sherlock in his cell. To know that he’s locked up and won’t ever get out.”
“Yeah. Thanks, John, I appreciate it. Let me know if he’s too much of an arse,” the inspector said before hanging up.
“Ah yes. You’re skipping right to the end, aren't you? I understand you’ve already taken care of Ms. Riley. I’m guessing she worked with Jennifer Wilson.”
“She’d never sustain the fiction of being single over time,” Sherlock continued, not hearing him. “So more likely a string of them. Simple,” he finished.
Lestrade was waiting for them outside a small room, the doorway sealed off by a clear, plastic tarp. “Took you long enough,” he joked once the two neared him.
“Did Greg tell you anything about the scene,” he asked. Sherlock looked up from his phone with a questioning look.
“See you tomorrow, John.” The two hung up and John was left in the silence of his kitchen. Slowly, he felt the feeling a betrayal turn into realization; the realization that Greg was right. Beside him, his tea kettle started to whistle.
“Of course. I’m sorry, John it’s just been a long day.” He could hear how tired the investigator was over the phone and decided to cut him some slack.
“Because I need it. I need your help. I’m just worried I’m wasting efforts on finding this mystery hacker when Sherlock could be pointing us in the wrong direction on purpose. Look, we’ve always known the killer knows Sherlock, so hasn’t he just told us who he is?”
“He’s going to come after me,” he asked in a quiet voice, his face growing pale. Sherlock stopped in his place, turning to face his old friend with a downtrodden expression.
“There is a security camera at the top right corner of the building opposite you. Do you see it,” a sour yet educated voice said over the line.
“We keep our most dangerous prisoners down here,” the man said as he used a keycard to unlock a barred door.
Maybe the caller was the killer or at least knew who was. They were the ones who said the cases were connected to Sherlock in the first place, and they’d been the one to call him after he’s gotten out of the hospital.
“I like the new place,” Lestrade said, looking around the spacious cottage. John has moved out of his unit housing to the quaint house just outside of London shortly after the first mysterious call. He’d told everyone it was because he needed to get away from the bustling of the city, but it was really due to his ever-growing paranoia.
“No. I want to talk about your theory. If you don’t have one you can leave and come back at a later date.”
“Not particularly. But I think I know why you’re here,” John said, wanting to put an end to the small talk.
“And they’ll stay in danger until you come back with something worth my time. A case file perhaps,” the killer hinted.
“We know that the murders are linked to yours in different ways. The victims are family members, neighbors, or coworkers and the like to your previous victims.”
“I haven’t told anyone why you were meeting with me.” The limped man scoffed. “John, I swear. I haven’t told anyone. Not Anderson, not anyone.”
“It’s possible. We found records that he had called in to try to solve it. He would’ve been nine.” John said nothing and rubbed his hands along his face. He was beginning to feel nauseous.
“Well, you were never known for being patient,” Sherlock insulted, his eyes still closed where he continued to lay.
“Come to Sherlock’s. Bring back up,” he texted Lesterade. He had just slipped his phone back into his pocket when he heard a creak behind him. He turned around and practically walked right into the knife.
“Yes, but I haven’t gotten as much help as you might think. And after they bring me sweet Johnny, I’ll kill him myself.”
“I’m not a detective anymore,” he said almost defensively. He flinched at the glare the doctor sent him. He forced on a smile. “But I’m just as surprised as you are.” The doctor put on his own smile, which he dropped as soon as he started speaking again.
“We were delayed,” Sherlock said, glancing back at John who ducked his head in embarrassment. Without further explanation, Sherlock walked right past the inspector and into the closed off room.
“Um, sure. Thank you,” John said, feeling more relaxed though his stomach still ached with the knowledge that something wasn’t adding up. Sherlock disappeared into the kitchen, leaving John alone in the cluttered room. He got up and began looking around.
“Yeah, that sounds right.” There was a brief pause in the conversation as the two thought things over and John put his kettle on the stove to cook. He felt a rush of guilt pool in his stomach as he spoke up again.
Five years passed before John received another phone call from the strange man, this time to his house.
“Sure, but I can’t imagine her cause of death will be different from the others,” John said, ignoring the bristle of annoyance that went through him.
“So you know him,” John asked over Sherlock’s pacing and the sound of him mumbling absently to himself.
Ten days after that, the body of Jeff Hope, an old colleague of Beth Davenport, the third strangulation victim, was discovered. After that Lestrade finally called John back.
“Maybe I was wrong.” John laughed at the very idea of Sherlock saying such a thing. He paused in his pacing and looked to the ex-consultant with a grin.
“And what’s this,” The doctor asked, reaching out for the file in his hand, but coming up short when John pulled it just out of reach before putting it behind his back.
“I must say I’m surprised at your visit, detective Watson,” Dr. Anderson said while he led John into his office after nearly two hours of waiting.
“I’m growing tired of you acting like you know anything of real value. It’s boring. Come back when you have a theory,” Sherlock mumbled up to the ceiling.
“Watch,” the voice said. John watched as the camera turned away from where it faced him. “There’s another camera on the footbridge to your left. Do you see it?” John turned around until he saw the camera.
“His actions were less than tasteful. I wanted to extend my apologies for him putting you in the middle of everything.”
“People are always dying, John. But these people, they’re related to the people I killed. Did it feel good to be so close to that feeling again,” Sherlock paused as if waiting for an answer. When none came, he continued in his low voice. “If the closest thing you’ll get to war, John. I’m what you crave. You need to admit it.” John stepped back suddenly, just then noticing how fast his heart was beating. “It’s okay, John,” Sherlock tried to soothe. “You don’t have to say anything now. Just go back to the yard. Think about what I said.” Not knowing what else to do, John nodded before he started walking down the hall. “John, you forgot something.”
Back in his cell Sherlock was staring up at the ceiling, his eyes betraying his nervousness. He quickly jumped up out of bed and walked over to his desk before he started writing out a message in charcoal text.
“John?” The voice made him jump. He turned around to find Sally Donovan walking up to him, a look of concern etched into her features. “What’re you doing here?”
“I really appreciate your help with this, John,” the silver haired man said as he pulled out a file and began handing it to him. He hesitated slightly, causing John to give him a questioning look as he slowly took the file from him.
“That’s good. Have you given any thought to coming back to the yard,” Lestrade asked, only half joking.
Instead of heading towards the restrooms, he headed down towards the basement, avoiding guards and flicking the card between his fingers. He’d stolen it many times before. Both to access into the prison’s database and to walk the lonely halls of said prison.
“Mine,” Sherlock asked, almost surprised. “Well maybe I should start wearing the coveralls like Lesterade’s been bugging me about. It’ll save the forensic team some time.”
“I guess he doesn’t know me as well as you all seem to think he does.” Sherlock stood up slowly and laid down on his bed, intertwining his fingers on his chest and staring up at the cement ceiling. John looked at him for a moment, waiting for him to say or do something.
“There’s been another one. A couple of kids found her in an abandoned apartment building in Brixton at Lauriston Gardens,” a tired Lestrade said over the phone.
“Do you see the camera, detective Watson,” the voice asked again. John looked around questionly before he found said camera.
“Of course you have your men doing your dirty work. You were always one to keep your own hands clean.”
“I’m worried about him working on a case related so close to what happened,” she continued, not minding what he said. Her superior sighed, dropping his act.
“Did he say I did,” he asked, looking back at John. He walked over to the glass wall keeping them separated.
“Oh. Hi, Sally. I’m just here to pick something up from Greg,” John lied, knowing that his friend could get into trouble if he told her the truth.
“You made one mistake, John. We all did,” Lestrade tried to console. “You can’t give up your career over one mistake.”
Sherlock composed himself before saying, “I’m surprised you’re back at all, given our last conversation.”
“Yes, but that doesn’t mean you need it. You’re far stronger than you think” The ex-detective felt a jolt of surprise at the almost sincere words. “Now sit down. You’re quite pale and I wouldn’t want to fainting.” Sherlock said as he turned away from his visitor and sat at his desk, choosing to face the wall instead. John hesitated for a long moment before he sat but as soon he did the prisoner started speaking again. “I imagine you’re here about the killing spree and not closure like you told Anderson.”
“Why didn’t you just talk to them when they were here,” he asked defensively, his anger boiling over. Sherlock simply smirked at him.
Malik left John to walk the rest of the way out once they’d reached the main floor of the building. He’d already gotten off the phone with Lestrade and was walking as quickly as he could towards the main doors, his file grasped tightly in hand.
“Oh, no. It’s unrelated.” John tried to leave it at that but the look Donovan gave him showed that she wasn’t exactly buying it.
But that seemed too obvious. Why would the killer call him? John kicked himself. It was too easy. But it was something. He’d have to ask Sherlock about it to see what he thought. Maybe he even knew the identity of the caller.
“Well you have become more brazen lately. What will your little nurse think when she finds you missing?”
“Do you know why I’ve been asked to talk to you about them,” John asked quietly, wanting to push the conversation forward so he could get away from there as soon as possible.
It was a short train ride to Sherrinford. The taxi dropped him off outside the prison and John steeled himself before he went in. He stared up at the sign reading “Sherrinford Prison”, his hand squeezing the handle of his cane. He took a deep breath and slowly made his way inside.
“Of course I’m being safe,” John asked, offended that his old friend would think so little of him. “I was a detective you know. I know how to handle people like him.”
“Of course. There’s no possible way,” Johns said, more for himself than for Sherlock. The sound of a tea kettle whistling from the kitchen caused John to jump. Sherlock chuckled at this and stood up from his seat.
“She must’ve been strangled longer. If the killer strangled her long enough to leave indentations when on the others there were none, perhaps he had a personal vendetta against her,” Sherlock said almost to himself.
“You’re friends with Kitty Riley. Of course. I should’ve seen it earlier,” the patient said to himself.
“I know you do, it’s just that you seem a little eager to talk to him again.” John felt the feeling of betrayal smack him hard in the chest, causing his heart to tighten and squeeze.
“Like him? You’re incapable of liking people,” Lestrade shouted, his self control snapping. “You’re a bloody psychopath!”
“You’re just dying to know, aren’t you? How I’m going to hurt your little detective. Are you angry, or jealous?”
“I hear you’ve retired from the yard. It’s a shame; you were the only detective there with any sense.” Sherlock eyed the cane clenched tightly in his hand. “I could hear your cane from down the hall. I’m surprised you still use it considering you don’t need it.”
“Do what,” Sherlock asked, his tone giving away that he knew exactly what his companion was referring to.
“Of course. If Sherlock gives me any fuss I can just bribe him with a cold case or something,” John reasoned.
“But it was close, wasn’t it? You crave it, John. The blood, the gore. You miss it, even if you can’t admit it. That’s why you decided to help on this case.”
The irritated psychiatrist watched him go, his nostrils flaring in anger. He stormed into his office and picked up his phone.
“Sorry, love. I was just trying to surprise you,” he said said as he walked up to her, giving her a hug and a kiss. “You about ready to go?”
“I’ll call him up. Why don’t you have a seat and finish filling out these forms?” Only a few minutes later the orderly was guiding John back down to the basement.
“You know, Greg. I’d really like to help with this case but there’s no way I can do that unless I’m speaking to Sherlock. But I can’t speak to Sherlock unless I have that case file,” he said, taking the prisoner’s advice.
John stepped up to the front desk where the woman who’d helped him yesterday sat. She smiled up at him politely. She looked to kind to work in such a place.
“John, do you think I’d be here asking you if I didn’t have any other choice? People are dying, and based on the evidence god knows how many more will. We never got an accurate number of Sherlock’s victims.”
“Doesn’t matter. He’s planning on leaving her anyway,” the prisoner said as he finally turned to grab the file and placed it on his desk before thumbing through it. John sat in awkward silence as he watched him read.
“He apologizes for you,” John explained. He jumped when Sherlock jolted up out of his chair, glaring down at the smaller man.
One night he was walking home from the store, using a cane to help his new limp when he heard a phone ringing from inside a phone booth. He ignored it and continued on his way until a couple blocks over he heard another phone in another booth ringing. He looked around the nearly empty street before he stepped into the booth, setting his bags down on the ground before answering.
“Very clever, John. You’re quite right. You don’t know the true number of my victims and I’m sure he doesn’t either. That and he seems to be going out of order,” Sherlock explained.
“We all should’ve seen the signs,” Lestrade cut in. “I knew him longer than you did and I didn’t see anything. For god's sake, I thought the worst thing he’d done was contaminate the crime scene. It didn’t even cross my mind that he was the one who put that body there.” John looked away from him, his eyes burning with tears he refused to let fall.
“Yeah, thanks for that. We have to hold a press conference now and tell everyone the spree is related to Holmes.”
“Lestrade. You look tired. And you’re smoking again,” he said after glancing the officer up and down.
Several days later, in the late evening when most of the prison staff had gone home, a young, happy-looking man was walking up the main doors of the prison. He walked up to the front desk and was greeted by the secretary with a smile.
“Embarrass her like that. She’ll never like you if you keep doing that.” Suddenly, Sherlock stopped in his tracks and whipped around to glare at the shorter man.
“And what, may I ask, is the reason for your visit,” he asked as he sat in his large leather chair behind his oak desk. John took this as an invitation to sit down in one of the plastic chairs placed in front of it.
“Because if he did I’d have no reason to go back,” John blurted. He bit his tongue as soon as the words left his mouth. Lestrade stared at him in stunned silence.
The press conference went as bad as expected. John watched it on the television, his guilt eating away at him as he saw Greg, Sally, and all the others struggle through the questions. For days afterward he tried calling in to offer his help, but he only ever got a busy signal. It was only eight days later that the news came out about Gary Jenkins, a friend of the second strangulation victim, going missing.
Lestrade later heard that he didn’t say a word to anyone outside of court besides his defense team until the day John woke up. Apparently he’d said he was thankful the world didn’t lose the one man clever enough to stop him.
“The How is not important, detective Watson, but the why is. I wanted to apologize,” the voice said.
“Donovan actually,” John answered. “But she’s right. I mean, me and Greg were only in the hallway for a couple of seconds but unless you were there when she died-“ John cut himself off, the realization slowly washing over him. Sherlock looked at him, a smile beginning to stretch across his face.
John set his shoulders. “Sherlock, this is becoming a bigger deal than you think it is. I think we should take Rosie out of nursery school and implement self-quarantine.”
“You don’t have to. Clearly, you’re still hungry.” John waved a hand at him. “Just eat or whatever and come to bed when you’re done.”
Sherlock bit his lip as his chest threatened to explode from the flood of emotions running rampant through him. He pushed down the tiny wave of panic at the overwhelming sensation and leaned over, reaching out for John. He tugged on John’s arm. “John… I’ll find it just… come here.”
Sherlock’s eyes grew glassy, and he stifled a sob before looking incredibly alarmed at the sound that had just come from him. His shoulders shook from the effort of holding it back. He nodded rapidly, his curls bouncing. “Yes.” He choked out the response. “Yes, yes, yes, yes, John.” Sherlock reached for him, desperate for closeness; and the ring slipped from his palm and fell with a light
“Conditioner on the hair strands will determine if it was the sister, which I firmly believe it is.” Sherlock raised his hand, and a cab pulled up to the curb. He opened the door for John while leaning forward towards the cabbie. “St. Bart’s Hospital.”
This is the final written chapter of Bee Socks. I have decided not to continue with this story for mental health reasons and lack of creative drive. Chapter 9 will be a summary of what I had intended to happen with the story to give you all some semblance of closure. Thank you so much for reading. xx
A giggle escaped him. He couldn’t stop it. He was just so damn happy. Not trusting himself to say anything more, John squeezed Sherlock’s hand and led them out, heading for home.
Sherlock paused. “Um… no.” He waved the man away and ducked under the yellow tape himself. He stayed six feet away from the officer and moved towards Lestrade.
“Because it’ll be good for both of us. Now, let’s go.” He reached down and held out his hand for her.
John shrugged. “I don’t question it.” He turned behind him and grabbed a knife. He gently scored the top sphere with 8 slices, then moved on to the bottom sphere and scored it slightly 10 times.
As John sat in the back of the taxi on his way to the prison, he fiddled with the file nervously. Would Sherlock still talk to him even though he still had no theories? Would the file be enough? He became lost in thought as he gazed out the window to the cloudy morning. Suddenly an idea popped into his head.
“The cases are related to Sherlock Holmes. DI Lestrade will becoming by shortly to speak to you about them.”
“Because what’s the use of telling you everything the first time if I know you have no reason to come back? Now do you have a theory or not?” It took John a moment to respond, stunned by the killer’s honesty.
“Naturally,” the shorter man said as he began walking aimlessly around the hall, almost dancing to a song only he heard.
“The killer. He had to know you.” Sherlock put his legs down and spun around in his chair to face John, their eyes again immediately meeting.
“Well we’re running out of time.” The two sat in silence for a moment, both holding their phones up to their ears in sweaty palms. “John, we don’t have any other options.” It didn’t take him long to decide, but when John did he made sure his voice sounded steady.
“Is this about the string of murders? Are they somehow related to Holmes,” the annoying man asked, growing excited.
“John, as amusing as it is to hear you all worked up, I find it a great insult that you think I would tell the bumbling idiot anything of importance. Now what are you talking about,” Sherlock asked.
“I can tell you how it happened. He lied to you. And not just about this; about everything. Mike didn’t find any trace of the yard’s computer system being hacked. He’s been playing us the whole time!”
“You don’t have to be a spoilsport. I am  looking forward to putting him out of his misery though.” He paused to glance at his watch. “Sorry dearheart, but I should be going. I’m taking Molly out to dinner tonight.”
“I did. And I can imagine what his is as well.” John rolled his eyes at Sherlock’s stubbornness but paused when they landed at the sight of an old newspaper sitting on his desk. It was the one from weeks ago, the one with John on the cover. Realization hit him like a truck.
“It’s not my fault. You’re little detective got too close. I had to jump to the end to catch him before he wised up and went on the run,” he said, his voice dripping with anger. Sherlock chuckled to himself.
“I am sorry about this, John, but you got too close. You understand,” Sherlock whispered darkly before pressing his nose into his victim’s hair, taking a deep breath. In his arms, John continued to shake. A cool sweat breaking out over his body and his head becoming light with blood loss. “I guess it is my fault. But everyone eventually becomes lazy, forgetful. Even if it takes years.”
“I can’t remember off the top of my head but I’m sure if your team is good enough they’ll come up with a good approximation.” Sherlock’s reluctance caused Lestrade to sigh and rub at his graying hair.
“Brilliant,” John said despite himself. A habit he’d fallen into since he’d started working with Sherlock. The trenchcoat-clad man gave him a smirk before he turned to the inspector who looked between the two.
“I am, but my men are getting tired. I’ve been running them absolutely ragged,” Jim answered in a cartoonish voice.
It wasn’t hard to get past the guard in the surveillance room blocking off the stairs from Sherlock’s hallway. He’d had Sebastian slip in some sleeping pills into the man’s drink an hour or so before. Jim unlocked the barred door and practically skipped down to Sherlock’s cell where the little psychopath still lay on his bed, his eyes closed.
“I am not at liberty to say,” John said definitively. He continued once he saw the man open his mouth to speak again. “Because I’m not working with the yard. I’m sorry I caused you trouble, but I’ll be leaving now.” John turned around and hurried out the door; away from the doctor and away from Sherlock. He needed to get back to the yard to see if tracking the hacker was something Mike could even do.
“Ugh, can you blame me? It got so boring,” Jim said, emphasizing the last word heavily. “Not all of us can kill off every person who slightly annoys us.”
“Nothing,” the investigator said with a tired sigh as he took one of the coffees from the cup holder John carried. John set the carrier down on his messy desk before taking his own drink and sitting back in the chair he’d been sitting in for the last several hours.
“What do you care? You’re the one who stabbed him!” Sherlock narrowed his eyes at the man. A warning.
“You told her John was visiting me, didn’t you,” Sherlock asked, sitting up suddenly. The two orderlies jumped back in surprise while the doctor tried not to look so nervous.
“If people are in danger, they have the right to know,” she called. He hesitated before turning to her.
“You’ll call me when the forensics come back,” Sherlock said once they started driving, his tone being more of an order rather than a question.
“Sherlock,” John said before he stood out of his seat and stepped up to the glass of his cell. The taller man looked down at him with wide eyes as he did. “I’m Don’t with your games, we’re running out of time. You need to tell me right now who he is.”
John got up early to head to the yard. He knew Lestrade would be in early and he wanted to head out to Sherrinford as soon as he was done picking up the file so he could be in bed and forgetting about Sherlock Holmes as soon as possible.
Hours later John was receiving surgery and Sherlock was handcuffed in an interrogation room while Lestrade stared at him through the one way mirror. Donovan came to a stop beside him, looking at the killer in disgust.
John was laying in bed, staring up at the ceiling of his small unit housing. His dinner was left uneaten at his desk and he was ignoring the pain of hunger in his stomach when his phone started ringing. He sprung into action, sitting up and answering the call on the first ring.
“No. I should’ve stopped him sooner. He said he’d been killing for years. I’m a homicide detective, I should’ve seen the signs sooner.”
The doctor did not appreciate his sass and said, “you’re coming from seeing Holmes aren’t you? Don’t you know you need permission from his primary psychiatrist in order to visit him?”
“Because they’re not you. Besides,” he paused to put his feet up on his desk and stretched out his long legs, “those idiots do nothing for my thought process. You however, do wonders.” John sighed before choosing to just continue.
“It’s a small prison, John. Word gets around fast. As for the murders, I’m allowed to read the newspaper when I’m deemed worthy. Though I’m sure Anderson thinks me reading about the crimes will cause me to want to talk about my own,” Sherlock explained, putting his palms together in thought and leaning forward.
“Precisely. He’s a hacker, and a skilled one at that. It’ll be very tricky to source his hacking, but Mike’s good enough to get it done.”
“No, not that. Your cane.” John looked over to where his cane sat, leaned against the chair where he’d left it. He’d been walking without it the whole time and hadn’t noticed. He silently walked over to it and picked it up, inspecting it in his hand in shock before looking up at Sherlock who was grinning at him happily. “You missed the war, John. Welcome back.” John said nothing and walked away, his cane grasped tightly in his hand, though he didn’t use it.
“Thanks. I think it suits me,” John lied as he sat down in his armchair, gesturing for his old friend to do the same.
On the taxi ride back, John thought over what Sherlock had said. Not about him missing the violence of the war; he was too nervous about what that thought would lead to. Instead, he thought about what he had said about the killer getting into the yard’s database without hacking in. He said he’d been close when he brought up the idea of someone on the force being the killer, but who else could it be?
“I don’t know where your stupid friend is. Now leave me in peace,” he said before laying back down. Anderson sighed before walking away, the orderlies following close behind.
“Look,” John said lowly, leaning in close. “I’m not sure if you know why I visited last time, but I’m John Watson.” The woman gasped.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him and bit out, “quite,” before he turned back around and continued up the stairs. John followed slowly after, his heart racing at the memory of the man’s sudden change in behavior.
“You’re close.” John nodded and looked down, lost in thought before Sherlock pulled him back into reality. “Why did you decide to become a detective,” he asked suddenly.
“There was a man who called me just before Lestrade came to talk to me about the case. He said the case was linked to you.” Sherlock suddenly turned strikingly serious. His shift in mood made John’s skin crawl.
“Oh yes. A rope. How helpful,” the inspector said sarcastically as he buried his face in his hands, rubbing at his tired eyes.
“Our thoughts exactly. Which is why we went to talk to him.” John felt his heart stop and his eyes bulge.
“Obviously,” John whispered sarcastically to himself. The rest of the ride was quiet, save for the tapping of Sherlock on his phone. They reached the crime scene in twenty minutes and came to a stop beside the flashing police cars. They ducked under the police tape and went up to where Sally Donovan was talking to some local police.
“I like to hear your theories on the case. It does wonders for my thought process,” Sherlock said, not looking away from his screen. Beside him, John struggled to hide his blush.
. He started folding the dough into itself, smiling at how puffy it had become. After folding it in a few times, he gently started to tug apart a third of the dough. The dough refused to part. His brow furrowed and he tugged harder. The dough still refused to separate. The muscles in John’s arms bunched as he tightened his grip and ripped the dough into two sections with a brief grunt of exertion. A snicker drew his attention up from his dough and he rolled his eyes at Sherlock who was covering his mouth, dressed in a dressing gown, not having bothered to tie it. “My strong man.”
Sherlock paused for a moment when he saw it. “John, I’ll be perfectly fine. I’ll have gloves on the entire time and I’ll even bring one of those pocket hand sanitizers. Satisfied?”
“Why, John?” Sherlock kissed his neck. “I love doing it. I love touching you in any way. I adore you. I adore everything about you.”
They stood side by side in silence for a moment, looking at the chaos that had erupted so unexpectedly. Sherlock cleared his throat. “So… did you forget that when glass changes temperatures abruptly-”
Turning back to the table, he rubbed some flour onto the table’s surface and plopped the sticky dough onto the table. With a glance at his laptop, resting in front of him, screen glowing with the recipe, he started to knead the dough. He sprinkled a little flour on top and then pressed the heel of his left hand solidly into the center of the dough, miming the motions he had seen the bakers do on the show. He pressed his hand forward, rolling the dough out, then pulled the farthest edge, folded it back towards him, swiveled the dough 90° and repeated the action.
“Why are you doing this to him? I never knew you could be so cruel to a man you considered your best friend.”
Leading them down the hall, he opened the door and let Sherlock in first. Sherlock brushed past him and settled at his favourite microscope to examine the product on the hairs he picked up at the scene. As John watched Sherlock set up his solutions and prepped his slides, he shuffled aimlessly, nerves racking up again. He bumped into a metal stool, and the feet scrapped noisily across the ground. John winced at the noise and leaned against the counter instead, thrumming his fingers against the tabletop in an agitated pattern.
“John…” Sherlock ducked his head towards John and stopped, hovering above John’s lips. “Please. Kiss me again.”
Sherlock looked down at his hands. “You barely text me back. The first time we were able to see each other face to face was Wednesday. It took you seven days to manage to facetime me and we only talked for three minutes.”
Sherlock stood abruptly, leaving Rosie on the sofa. “What on earth?” He made his way into the kitchen. “What is all this?”
Sherlock wrapped his arms around himself. “Okay. It’ll only be until the beginning of April. That’s only three weeks.”
“I finally found a recipe for those scones you like. Molly had been helping me with it. It was supposed to be a surprise.” He lied smoothly, turning a half-hearted glare in Molly’s direction.
Sherlock huffed against John’s shirt and John rolled his eyes. “He’s having a bit of a temper tantrum, Rosie. He didn’t know I was going to live somewhere else for a while, so he’s a bit surprised.”
“Do you really have to go so soon? We’ve barely spoken.” Sherlock swallowed around the lump in his throat.
He quickly transferred the bread to the waiting wire rack and turned off the oven. He looked at his freshly made loaf and grinned. Now, to wait a bit before tasting it, the real test if this had all been worth it or just a giant waste of time.
John bent over and kissed the top of Rosie’s head. “I will. Text me.” He stood and went to the landing.
About an hour earlier, John had sat in his chair, enjoying the Saturday morning, drinking his morning cuppa and watching a previous episode of The Great British Bake Off on his laptop.
John placed his hand over Sherlock’s pinning it to his lower chest. “I’m good. Already took care of it.” He turned and met Sherlock’s lips in a kiss.
John rested a hand on Sherlock’s arm. “It’ll just be a minute, love, and I’m sure whatever Mycroft has to say will be horribly boring.”
-It's a movie that just won the Oscar! It must be interesting... I want to see it, Sally too so we'll go together-John concluded taking another step towards the kitchen.
"What was the need to warn him since he would not be present anyway?" asked the black-haired man, trying to find a logical explanation for his misdeeds.
-But I liked it. I think I'd like to visit Rome one day... Maybe you could find a decades-old mystery to solve- he said.
Ever since the man returned to Baker Street, John had thrown himself headlong into the new role of parent learning quickly how to change a diaper, how to bathe Hamish without flooding the bathroom (as had happened to Sherlock the first times), and had managed several times to calm the little one during his tantrums thanks to small affectionate gestures and the reassuring and calm sound of his voice.
They weren't friends, not yet, but that day had shown that with a little goodwill from both, they could be friends again.
"Does this mean that the problem was not important?" asked Mycroft, clearly trying to fully understand the situation.
-Will you be together long enough so that I can meet this sex goddess? – added John with the same beaming smile Harry had gave him just few moments before.
But even before he was fully conscious, John remembered the difference between cinematic fiction and reality: instead of the gentle sun that lit up the room, Sherlock's bedroom was still shrouded in semi-darkness caused by clouds and rain that he felt falling insistently against the window panes; the harmonious song of the birds had been almost brutally replaced by the distant rumble of thunder to herald yet another rainy day in London, and the hope to feel Sherlock's strong body next to him was disproved the moment John reached out to the portion of the bed occupied the night before by the detective and found it cold and empty.
Soon, his brother would appear on the door of the apartment, ready to teach him a lesson on responsibilities, eventually conceding to take care of the child or to find someone more qualified to do it for them.
A distant memory of his literature classes at school and the many times he had tried to impress a girl with that volume made him realize what had happened in that room.
When John went out that night, Sherlock had ignored him, diving into the music of his own violin, despite feeling the doctor's gaze on himself like a sniper rifle: he was aware that it wouldn’t take much, just a slight nod from John and Sherlock would blow all his plans.
He had lost three years of his life mourning a man who had instead traveled around the world, solving the biggest puzzle of his life, without worrying in the least about what or whom he left behind.
Not even an hour after Mycroft's departure, Anthea and two minions had delivered what could be considered an annual supply of diapers, milk powder, Johnson oil, Vaseline cream combined with a wardrobe that the woman estimated would be enough for the next few months, with a crib, a pram and some guide books for new parents.
His gaze lingered several times on the figure of his mother, missing her and above all desperately in need of her embrace and the huge amount of cakes she prepared whenever there was a problem.
The detective entered their apartment and took off his coat and scarf, abandoning them as usual on the sofa.
Despite suffering because of her, Sherlock had chosen Irene over him to destroy Moriarty's criminal web.
With a single elegant move, Sherlock stood, turning his back to John, as if he wanted to hide from the man.
John tried to hide from the detective's gaze and stared for a few moments at Hamish immersed in his own games.
Two deep and dangerous eyes, which in the past had literally brought heads of state and crowned heads to their knees, fixed themselves on his face, clearly undecided whether to punish him for his insolence or not.
-Something you want to take off your chest, John?- Anderson asked, giving voice to what everyone had thought.
"I'm not sulking" Sherlock said, with a petulant voice, without looking away from the slides under the lens.
When the bottle was ready, Sherlock handed it to Molly, who had kept Hamish in her arms during the preparation, to make the baby eat.
Waking up after what had been the "night that had changed his life the umpteenth time", John would have expected a classic Hollywood movie awakening: a shy sun peeking through the windows, the distant chirping of the birds announcing the beginning of a new chapter of his life, the warm and strong body of his lover still asleep next to him under the covers, an arm around his hips.
Would he go to the appointment tomorrow with the knowledge that that was their swan song, or with a confident look in his eyes towards the future that awaited them?
John laughed and put his forehead against the detective's shoulder, feeling the vibrations of Sherlock's low laugh, trembling pleasantly when a hand caressed his short hair and back.
You went on to travel the world solving the biggest puzzle I'd ever seen without stopping for a moment to think of the poor idiots you had left behind...-he shouted at him.
Looking for the perfect family, which would look after him with love and he would not miss anything, making sure he will grow up like a normal child.
Three pairs of eyes rested on him: two were clearly curious, while the third was slightly concerned about what might happen soon.
John smiled for that affectionate gesture, so little in accordance with the rude and callous Sherlock Holmes the world knew and settled comfortably until he laid his head on Sherlock’s right shoulder.
Sherlock stared at him a few moments, a little bit annoyed at being deprived of a worthy fight but before he could say anything  five-year- old Hamish stood in front of him and stretched the front of his t-shirt with the skinny fingers of his right hand.
When he finally calmed down, he looked up again at Sherlock’s face and realized that this time it was up to him to apologize.
-Sharing the apartment with Dr. Watson is not the wisest decision at the moment- rebuked Mycroft to corroborate his words.
Those words were the final confirmation to the suspicion that had tormented Sherlock throughout the medical examination.
A noise behind him let him know that Sherlock had moved from the farthest wall of the living room, approaching his father's armchair.
You said you'd be gone for a few more days and... I'm happy to see you again- Greg said, quickly covering the distance between them and sitting next to his man on the couch.
Tomorrow I will have a work commitment and showing up with a hangover is certainly unprofessional - Jack replied by hanging his jacket on the pegs next to the door.
Why had this "sex beast" been content with mutual masturbation and hadn't slammed him on the bed so that they could fully and mutually enjoy their bodies?
As for Lestrade, it had become clear from the evening that the inspector showed up at Baker Street with a warrant that things were not going well for him, that referral must have been the natural consequence of their collaborations on Lestrade's cases.
It had been a long week, compounded by the problems he and Greg had had three weeks ago and that had not completely abandoned him and  Mycroft needed to go home, spend some time with Gregory and make sure things were back to normal, to make sure that the mysterious problem that had driven them away did not yet hover like a specter between them.
Sherlock exhaled, clearly tired of ever having to explain even the most obvious things, before staring his cold gaze upon Tommy.
John would have liked to retort that they should clean up, that otherwise the next morning they would find themselves sticky and dirty, but Sherlock laced his arm around his waist and pulled him against his chest and a few moments later both were fast asleep.
John chuckled amused, lowering his gaze for a few moments before bringing his eyes back on Sherlock, in time to catch a glimpse of the man's amused smile.
Sherlock sighed and walked a few steps away from the doctor, turning his back briefly before meeting John’s eyes once more.
A tiny part of his brain kept pointing out to him that if they were now in that situation, if they were forced to fight to save that relationship that had been born under the best auspices and that had made John believe in a peaceful future, it was because of Sherlock's mistakes, because of his silence, and because of what had happened with Irene.
-I don't know why you came here before you went to Baker Street, but you're not here to congratulate me on my wedding.
How many mornings, especially during the first few weeks, had his mind offered him that long muscled body there on the couch?
-Okay. As sad as it may be, I understand: England needs to be governed and no one does it better than you" he said as he stood up.
Contrary to the previous kiss, in this one any sweetness was absent, leaving room to the desire that the two men felt for each other and that they had hidden far too long: Sherlock bit John's lower lip with his teeth, recording only partially the strong fingers that sank into his curls pushing him forward towards the solid body of the blonde, while the tip of a foreign tongue stroked his upper lip, drawing the contour of his lips, before meeting his twin and engaging it in a languid dance.
Jack put his hand on John’s nearest knee, trying to calm him down, throwing an affectionate smile at him.
At those words John's heart inexplicably increased his beats, impressed by the simplicity of his reasoning and the total honesty in Sherlock's voice.
Unknowingly John looked up at the living room, worried that that conversation might annoy Sherlock, but the man still seemed lost in his Mind Palace, but a slight smile rose on his face when he noticed that the plate on the coffee table was empty.
Wouldn't it have been better to disappear altogether, continue his farce and make another life elsewhere?
Sherlock opened the bathroom door moments later, dressed also in his pajamas and in his blue robe, busy drying his black curls with a white towel.
Comparing his notes with Sally's, the two agreed that no one had seen or knew anything, at least for now.
John blushed slightly at those words, aware that Sherlock would move heaven and earth to stop his departure, even going so far as to ask Mycroft for help if it was necessary, but at that moment his words were sincere and John could not hold back the smile that stretched out his lips and led him to approach the detective.
"What did Mycroft say when you told him you were coming with me and the kids to the Gay Pride?” John asked him curious.
"I have no idea what I'm doing" Sherlock said honest, staring at those eyes so similar to his own and yet so different. - But I promise I'll do everything I can to give you the best.
- And as if that were not enough it is almost a quarter of an hour that we're here talking about John-she pointed it out.
Sarah remained silent for a few moments, clearly uncomfortable, the fingers of her left hand still clenched around the door handle.
The restaurant was cozy and familiar with blue and white tiles on the walls, recalling the exterior, black-and-white pictures hanging on the walls to witness the decades of activity.
We would avoid Social Services and I can make sure everything is fine- he proposed and then turn to Sherlock once again- Would that be a problem for you? - John asked him.
"And I guess your parents don't know anything about your activities... - commented Greg without saying a word on the automatic action done by the boy.
John stared for a few seconds at his partner still perfect  and handsome face, despite the passing years, a stern look on his face.
-Not many... I wasn't a saint, that's true, and I admit I had my meaningless affairs, both as a boy and during my years in the Army.
-As for your question, I can't answer for Dr. Watson, but personally I'm married to my work and I can't afford distractions of any kind.
For a few moments the two men remained silent, aware that they were on the edge, suspended between the known shore of their friendship and the unexplored one of a possible romantic relationship.
"However, Alastair saw something in me, something that convinced him to help me with my studies and later led him to encourage me to continue my career, despite having two children and we were both two very busy people”
You don't live in close contact with Sherlock Holmes for almost two years without at least learning how to pick a lock.
-Hey Boss, how's it going? -asked John kindly, a slight smile on his lips- Look who I brought with me-said again John, moving slight his head in Sherlock’s direction.
-When I met Alastair, I was a student and he was a professor of biology and chemistry, the kind of courses women were not allowed to attend, because they were deemed useless for our future as mothers and family wives...-commented with a sarcastic grimace that so many times the doctor had seen on Sherlock's face.
“Good girl. Why don’t you take your biscuit, say goodbye to Daddy, and go upstairs? I’ll be right there. We can watch a bit of telly before breakfast.”
Pausing only for a moment, Sherlock wrapped John’s hand in his own, squeezing gently. “And you are mine.”
John’s forehead scrunched in thought and his hand flew to his face before his expression relaxed in understanding. “It’s nothing. They’re from the protective gear we’re wearing. Just a bit of chafing. I’m okay.”
Sherlock froze and John could feel his heartbeat quickening beneath his hand in a frantic symphony of staccatos. “I shouldn’t have-” John closed his eyes tightly.
Sherlock’s mouth twitched and he popped open the wrapping. “Now, remember, just two. Can you sit right here while you eat them?”
“Daddy has to live somewhere else because he’s a doctor and is helping people, but he doesn’t want to make us sick, so he is living in a little flat with Dr. Patrick and Dr. Michael.” Rosie looked at Sherlock matter-of-factly, reciting the information she had been told.
“Six. Go back to sleep, love.” Sherlock shrugged on his suit jacket. “Body drowned in paint in Lambeth. I’ll be back to watch Watson before you have to go in to work.”
Sherlock walked into the kitchen and planted a kiss on John’s cheek. “She’ll love them. You are a very considerate father.” Sherlock returned to his chair, settling into the leather, holding the little socks tightly in his hands. He looked back up at John and tilted his head. “Something else is bothering you… Something that happened at the hospital. What happened?”
The wind rustled through John’s short blond-grey hair. He closed his dark blue eyes for a moment against the wind before opening them again and looking out over the grey city he has come to know so well. He used to feel something for the city, fondness, loyalty, something. Anything. He hasn’t felt anything for quite some time.
“You sound like a child, Sherlock.” John rolled over and sat up, his legs swinging off the other side of the bed. “Most people would be thrilled they don’t have to reciprocate. Just enjoy it and shut up about it.”
John turned his head over his shoulder to look at it. “Quite the little modern artist we’re raising.”
He perked up as he heard the key turn in the lock downstairs and a smile appeared unbidden on his face as John’s footsteps walked up the stairs. He heard John shed his shoes and coat in the hall and walk into the living room. He tilted his face up, waiting for the kiss he knew was coming.
John flinched and set the cup of tea down on the table. “Yes, I know. I don’t want to hurt him. I just… I didn’t know how much he cared.”
Rosie ducked her head back inside the window. Turning to the camera, she said solemnly, “The person across the street says thank you, Daddy.”
Rosie’s face lit up and she stood on her tiptoes, looking out the window at the darkened street. “Really? He’s not outside.”
Wrapping an arm around his fiance, John pulled Sherlock flush against him, letting his hand travel to Sherlock’s arse. With a teasing smack to the plush backside, John placed a wet kiss to Sherlock’s jaw. “Race you to the bedroom?” he said with a wink and bolted down the hall, Sherlock following close after, locking the door firmly behind them. There would be no further celebrating tonight fit for the public eye.
“Daddy!” Rosie cried out his name and forgot herself, rushing towards him before being halted by Sherlock’s hand locked on hers.
“Not yet. I want the best for my family, Sherlock. I’ll do whatever it takes to keep you safe. And I already discussed things with Mrs. Hudson. She agrees with me that it’s best for everyone’s safety. And we can video chat, and I can still do the shopping if I have the time off. I could even talk to you from the pavement.”
John set the dough aside and repeated the action with the smaller section of dough, creating two semi-identical spheres of dough. Brushing the flour off his hands, John pulled out a round baking stone from the drawer under the oven and sprinkled flour on top, rubbing it in gently. He plopped the larger sphere on the bottom before settling the smaller one gently on top. He glanced at the instructions and hesitated. He glanced at Sherlock before quickly flouring his finger and plunging it through the top centre of the tower of bread dough and pressed it down all the way to the bottom. His finger met with some resistance, but he pushed until it sank deeply into the dough. With a slight bit of effort, he pulled his finger out, which left a puckered hole in the top of the dough.
John was giving breakfast to Rosie when Sherlock came pounding up the stairs, heading straight to the loo. “Morning… Sherlock?”
“John.” Sherlock pulled him close and wrapped his arms around him. “I know you’re worried. But they’re going to get this under control. It’s going to be alright. No one here is going to die.”
Immediately, Rosie started clapping, still staring out the window. “Papa, you’re supposed to clap too.”
As quarantine continues and the death rates sore, Sherlock grew steadily more depressed and struggled to look after his daughter. John grew increasingly more unavailable and Sherlock began to suspect John was cheating on him with a nurse from the hospital.
After the last sounds of footsteps had disappeared, Sherlock turned back to John with a soft smile. He held out a hand to him, wiggling his newly adorned ring finger pointedly. “Husband-to-be.”
John’s eyes widened and he gasped, giving Sherlock a short shove away from him. “You berk, you know that song.”
“Shut up.” John looked at the mess. “Well, I’m going to go get my shoes. Can you put some pants on and go ask Mrs. H if we can borrow her vacuum?”
John nodded. “I mean, a little. Especially since we have Mrs. Hudson downstairs and she’s eighty-two now. And we have Rosie.”
“Don’t tell me you didn’t know. Poor bastard’s been in love with you for years.” Greg chuckled softly.
Sherlock looked up from where he sat, building a makeshift fence out of blocks for Rosie’s horses and smiled at John. “I know. I love you too.”
Sherlock squeezed the precious tiny hand gently and walked slowly along the edge of the lake, keeping her close to him and away from the passersby. None of them were wearing masks and while he was mortified at their carelessness, he couldn’t help the red flush that was forming on the back of his neck at the looks he and his daughter were getting for wearing them. His grip tightened slightly on the hand of the prancing child next to him.
Sherlock flung open the doors to the morgue, startling Molly into dropping her scalpel onto the ground. “Oh! Sherlock, I wasn’t expecting to see you so early. Congratulations!”
“I think you’re overreacting, John.” Sherlock reached a hand towards him and rested it gently on his shoulder, giving it a squeeze. “I know you care about us and you’re concerned. But this seems… like a lot. They say it’s just like the flu.”
“Sherlock, from what I’m looking at my first guess would be this fellow was drowned in paint, but dumped here, will you come?”
“Just because the rest of the world is learning how to bake during quarantine does not mean this is something that must extend to you.” Sherlock crossed his arms and leaned against the doorframe.
John held up a hand. “Don’t use that tone of voice with me, as if I’m the only one in this family who has ever spent money on ridiculous things, Mr. I-have-to-have-my-coat-dry-cleaned-twice-a-week.”
Sherlock grimaced. Pushing down the surge of embarrassment he felt at the idea of pointlessly clapping at a randomly set time, he knelt next to his daughter and brought his hands together in a loud clap.  Despite his uncertainties, he sent a small smile towards the camera, knowing John would watch it later. They clapped for a few more seconds before Sherlock prepared himself to reach over and turn the camera off, ready to prepare Rosie for bed when the sound of someone clapping outside the window caught his attention. He ducked his head out next to Rosie’s small one. There were lights on in the apartment down the street, a shadow outlined by the open window, hands raised and meeting with loud, resounding claps that echoed their own. Something clenched in Sherlock’s chest and he continued clapping, feeling a little less alone.
It couldn’t have been more perfect. John grinned widely to himself as he walked up to Sherlock’s side. After pulling out the ring, he placed it in the center of Sherlock’s palm and got down on one knee.
John blinked and looked down, forehead creasing in thought. “Probably would vary a bit, but that’s only because most brands have a different style and weave pattern. But most of us have the same kind.”
Sherlock shook his head as he pulled on his soft pyjamas. “No. I found that I was displeased with the level of personal courtesy at the scene.”
Story: Sherlock watches the broadcast of the Queen and it settles him a little, the comparison and justification. He thinks of having to send Rosie away to live with strangers in the country and that thought is abominable. So, he is thankful that at least he can be with her. He calls Mycroft and asks if he’s okay. Sherlock is ashamed it took him a month to think of him. Mycroft is fine.
-You and Dr. Watson were inseparable at the time of your disappearance; and it was Dr. Watson who created the "
Until Moriarty had put in place the final act of his plan to get rid of Sherlock and the silence had fallen for a very long time.
Okay, maybe the tremor was also because he was there on the dancefloor with Sherlock Holmes, the last person he would have believed interested in dance.
The man had listened to him in silence and thanks to the nervous pulsing of the vein on his neck, Sherlock knew he was right.
John nodded slowly, unable to speak for a few moments, taking a new sip from his glass and focusing on his own food before giving her a friendly smile.
John nodded and watched Sherlock turn his back on him to begin the preparation of the drink, although both were aware that the detective was totally unable to prepare a tea even remotely drinkable.
The detective entered the living room quickly but had to stop at the doorway when he saw the figure sitting comfortably on the sofa.
A second bottle appeared on the coffee table a short distance from his right arm, leading John to look up.
Not at all surprised by the comment, John walked back to the counter to get sugar and milk and put them in the middle of the table and it was then that, after casting a glance at the clock hanging on the wall, he noticed how long it had actually been since Sherlock arrival.
Sherlock looked at John and noticed that the man's face had returned serene, followed by a slight nod.
- The first time I was sixteen, I was at university and most of the students who attended my courses thought I was someone to avoid because of my intelligence... except one.
A sympathetic smile appeared on the man's face instantly, and John realized he didn’t need to say anything, that words were not necessary.
Mycroft felt a callous hand settle on his right side and a little kiss was placed on the back of his neck, triggering a shiver that ran through the man's back.
As soon as he have taken Greek Street, Greg understood that the street was deserted wondering if anyone had informed the boys of his arrival, but then shook his head and reminded himself that he was from the Homicide Squad, continuing to walk as he looked around, taking a look at the shops still open despite the late hour and the pubs that were beginning to serve the last call and just before he decided to head to Frith Street, a couple of boys attracted his attention.
At the time, it didn't seem like an absurd exchange... The 9/11 attack was still a long way off, and it took me 12 hours to show up at a barracks and enlist myself- John took a sip from his glass.
During my internship at the hospital, we talked several times about getting married and starting a family right after my first tour, but just before I left for Ireland she told me that although she loved me, she couldn't continue our relationship: she couldn't bear the idea of spending her days next to the phone or waiting for a letter constantly thinking about what might happen to me-John revealed.
“The love of his life dies before his eyes... It's only natural that he keeps wondering what he could have say or do to avoid it" Greg said.
Trying to make order in his own thoughts, which were stirring nonstop in his brain, Sherlock followed the man for a dozen steps, stopping behind the church, in front of a wooden gate that allowed him to enter the garden of it.
-What can I say? A lady never leaves a party without first making sure she has spoken to the most important people" she replied.
Sherlock's back stiffened further at those words, while his mind was furiously searching for a sarcastic and stinging response that would silence the boy and reduce him to a cluster of nerves, but Tommy had already brought his attention back to John.
"I'll tell you what I know about the Tardis, and you help me look good with Miss Porter by helping me with my research, ok?" she asked Sherlock.
"He was hustling around here, sometimes he would come to the diner before he would go home" Tommy added.
Turning to the table, with a cup clenched in both hands, John smiled: Hamish had managed in the difficult task of conquering even the aloof Mycroft Holmes.
The man looked around for a few moments, only to irritate the British Government more, although he was right:  his plans for that day were very different than a cell in an English prison.
The detective's lips curved in a little smile, but the arrival of Mycroft and Greg prevented him from answering.
At those words John risked a glance at Sherlock, realizing once again how close that episode was to their situation.
At least I know that my man will come home to me at the end of the evening dragging behind his best friend, drunk and desperate for the death of my little brother, despite being able to pick up a lookalike of yours every time he goes to a club.
Perhaps for that very reason, on Friday night John Watson, returning from work, after a shower and with the classic cup of tea artfully placed on the armrest of his own chair, met his gaze for the first time in six days.
John turned to Sherlock and exhaled deeply, trying to pull in the far corner of his brain the licentious thoughts that had occupied his mind until a few minutes earlier.
-Do you wanna dance? -John asked him, his lips close to his right ear to outdo the chaos of the music and the crowd.
Sherlock's gaze had moved quickly around the room, finding solace in the old furniture and what had remained the same during his absence and coming to terms with what had changed.
Putting Sherlock’s legs higher in his hips, John changed the angle of penetration just enough that the tip of his cock brushed against Sherlock's prostate with every thrust, causing the man to moan in pleasure, moving his body in accordance with John's thrusts.
Jack shrugged his shoulders, getting up again and leaning against his desk to meet his friend's gaze.
-He went around collecting information about me from anyone who was willing to give it to him" the detective complained.
For a few moments the two remained silent, their gaze fixed on the television, but no longer following the film.
If John won’t like his conditions, as Sherlock supposed, then no one could accuse him of not trying.
She must have been a beautiful girl before she became homeless, Sherlock thought, observing the happy smile that sprang up on the girl's face at John appearance.
I thought I'd take it to you in person, instead of waiting for you to come down to check your mail... Such a small ticket can be easily missed- she added.
Aware of his ignorance of the matter, Sherlock had asked for help from the only person who, besides John and Mrs. Hudson, could have been really helpful in that situation.
-Irene was the first "stranger" to understand what was going on between John and   me, perhaps even before we were fully aware of it and, convinced that she had found my weak point, tried to take advantage of the situation, but made a mistake... Despite everything she knew about me, about John, and even herself, she fell in love with me-
-I'm waiting for you at home. Try not to spend the whole night here - Greg said, leaving the office the next moment.
Is it possible that such an obvious detail had escaped the brightest and smartest man John had ever met?
She also asked if she could have a sleepover with you on Saturday- Jack said, looking at John again.
When he raised his head, he noticed that Sherlock's gaze was fixed on him, and for a long moment he let himself be caught by the man's gray eyes, before quickly turning away, embarrassed at being caught in the act.
Sherlock let out a frustrated groan and was about to throw his cell phone against the wall, held back only by a new incoming message.
When Molly finally showed up at the apartment, Sherlock had to suffer again that look of reproach that had accompanied him all day every time John was mentioned, but the next moment Molly was totally bewitched by Hamish.
-That’s my boy! - he said, provoking a new laugh in John, before he is pushing him away from himself.
-I am smarter than your teacher-answered Sherlock without unnecessary modesty, leading John to sneer.
I have two short stories, always in this universe: one is set before "Come what may" and the other one is set a few years after the end of "CWM".
He struck him again and again, putting all the pain and neglect of those three years in every punch, until he felt two arms lift him from Sherlock's body.
-Shut up Anderson! -John promptly intervened, aware of the demons that were tormenting Sherlock at the moment.
By the time John returned home, speaking to Hamish, he had proclaimed himself Daddy; Sherlock was happy and satisfied that the man wanted an active and lasting role in the child's life, but why had he chosen a title that had always been of the birth father?
He walked through those familiar corridors, in which he had found himself countless times and breathed the smell of the hospital in his lungs.
“To be honest, I think they're hiding in the crowd somewhere, to be sure that nothing happens to us and the kids. Not to mention the countless cameras that moved along the way while we were walking” John added pointing to a surveillance camera a few meters away.
So, I went back home and lied to him, sincerely convinced that it was the right thing to do, for Sherlock and also for me, to finally get rid of that woman-concluded the man.
-Until she becomes pregnant and he disappears, leaving her in trouble with the family-continued Sherlock in his place.
"What a nonsense!" muttered Sherlock, taking his hand away from the woman's hold standing up, starting to walk back and forth in the small kitchen.
Sitting in a red leather armchair with a high back, a short distance from Lady Holmes, John held his breath, not knowing what to expect: it was not the first time he had been subjected to that kind of conversation, but he was usually confronted by a wary father determined to scare him with any means possible.
When I was 16, my sister Harriet, came out to my parents as a lesbian, and within two days the whole city knew about it.
And that our sweet John has many aces up his sleeve which certainly contributed to the making of that nickname.
