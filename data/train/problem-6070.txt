“Let me get dressed again and we can go.”
Tony smiles. “I think you proved that. Come on, before the water gets cold.”
“So, you ran off and lived on the Garden until you were too old to care and they found you.”
“So, they went ahead and volunteered?” Tony asked. “To stop what was happening to others?”
“Thought the doctors weren’t allowing you out of the med floor,” Tony says and goes to the fridge. He opens it just to stare in it. The timer in his head tells him he has 4 more hours before the nanites are ready – all the validation testing will be completed.
“Sir, I will get the bags and then introduce you to Wanda who will be the main chef for your stay. She’s already under contract and signed all the required documents. All is in order.”
“You and your dad close?” Tony put that out there to kind of break away at the ice. They hadn’t hit it off, not yet.
“I’m not sure there’s anything to talk out. You did me a favor. So, thank you. I had a lot more leverage with SHIELD when I came back to work for them because of you.” He twists off a cap from the beer bottle and places it on the counter in front of Tony.
“Survey. I can survey but not much more. Like I told you the maneuvering is off and the landing a bitch,” Tony says. He powers up the armor. “Stand clear, this baby isn’t certified safe.”
He snaps open his eyes and looks up. His reflection disappears and in its place is Tony. In the mirror. Now he’s really going crazy.
Tony reaches over and covers Steve’s hand with his own. “Listen, I’ll talk to Obie again. Get him to treat you better. The whole conference has been nothing but difficult for him.”
“They don’t seem to mind it,” Steve said. It was true. He never met a brooding vampire. With the exception of Bruce who seemed more anxious than melancholy, vampires in general were a generous people. They didn’t have to worry about disease. Nor did they worry about work. The covens provided everything except the human mate. The covens throughout the conclaves even tried to make that easier. They made rules against hunting, followed the dictates of the Treaty to feed on animal blood even though it did diminish their power. While they never followed the rules against mating, they still put up a fierce front to support intermingling throughout the human world. It worked. Except humans never were able to accept anything they couldn’t understand.
“But why?” The headache robbing him of logical thought processes caused the room to loop around in ever increasing circles.
Eating does not sound like an activity he wants to partake in at this moment. His headache pounds and his stomach flops over. He flinches at the smell of the food.
He frowns at Tony. That’s not true. They went to the Concourse and shopped. “You had popsicles.”
Tony studies him, his eyes hard but penetrating. “I don’t think I like the look on your face.”
Tony’s thoughts of needing to do it alone reflected Steve’s own loneliness. They mirrored one another. He stared at the neural networks buzzing overhead and understood a little more of his attraction and his bond with Steve.

“Sorry. I just don’t know the guy to say anything at all,” Rhodey says. “Outsides of that party, I never really talked to him. I mean I talked to him on the phone once and then again in person after that.”
“So each one of you and your missing members have an assignment, a designation as it were,” Strange said. “That designation not only works for the interaction with the leader of the pack but also with others. Except of course for the Beloved. That designation seals completely around the leader.”
“So, you think I’ll just learn my lesson and get over it.” The razor edge in his tone cut the air.
Of course, it is not the dregs, but the irredeemable. The lost, the feral, the criminal.
“What? That’s what I’m trying to do. I’m trying to get back to Cap-.”
“What are you doing? Do you need to take a crap?”
Steve and Bucky hadn't even been born yet. But he still thinks of it as something he experienced. Sarah, Steve's mom, had spoken of it and described it so many times. The Sentinel Guard leader, Alexander Pierce had advocated for a return to the greater society. The galaxy needed them. The worlds across the expanse of space would fall into chaos without the guidance and wisdom of the Scholar Jedis.
“But you feel better, now, you feel better?”
“Sure, why wouldn’t that be okay,” Tony said and threw his hands up. “Invite the whole damned cult of sorcerers. I don’t care.” He went back to his workbench, his whole manner obviously telling Steve to leave.
If the ring is unlocked, Steve does not know – all he knows is that he yanks up on the chain around his neck as the man strokes him to fruition. The lights in the room black out and a guttural yell escapes Steve as he follows the alpha’s command. After days of hovering on the edge, waiting and hoping, he comes in a wave that shuts off every other sensation and he howls. The pain is so great, and the pleasure slams into him. He’s not sure what happens next as the world funnels down and blinks out of existence. The next thing he knows is that he’s no longer attached to the rack above the bed, he’s lying panting on the bed with his hands curled up under his chin. He’s crying, fully and completely. Alpha sits next to him, slowly petting his hair and hushing him with quiet tones.
“We have fiercely loyal friends,” Tony added. “I mean Rhodey would try and kick your ass if you did anything he didn’t agree with. Might even call you names.”
“Am I?” Steve says and immediately regrets it. She didn’t put him in his current position. He did that all on his own. “Sorry.”
“We need help!” Clint yelled through the comm line.
“No, I did not,” Steve said and turned. His lips were crystal blue. His skin took on the effect of ice as if to touch him might shatter him into a million pieces. “I’m still officially frozen.”
Taken aback, Steve swings an arm around and punches the guy in the abdomen. It’s staggering and the alpha falls back, releasing Steve. Immediately, Steve realizes he’s made a mistake. The man stands there, stunned and confused.
“Tony. Please listen to what Vision wants to tell you,” Steve says, and it just incites Tony.
He changed, methodically. Every bit of him was becoming Captain America as he pulled on the pants, the shirt and jacket, the gloves. Steve couldn’t confess his fears, his trepidation to the team. They needed to focus, to be about the mission, not about Steve friend, his family. His need to find a way to save Bucky was his sin, his transgression, his weakness. He would do what he needed to do, but he would give everything to save Bucky as well. In his heart, in his soul he knew that Bucky Barnes could not and would not ever be Hydra – not willingly. They had a mission to accomplish, but for Steve – he had another mission as well. It didn’t escape him that he once accused Fury of adding extra covert missions to the main mission just days ago. He released a pent up breath. He needed to keep his head in the game and that meant ensuring the safety and well-being of people on that damned algorithm’s list. He picked up his phone. Steve wouldn’t be needing it, but right now he stared at it like it was a lifeline. His brain buzzed with conflicting emotions and he found himself flicking the phone on and connecting to Tony.
“Say hello, Tony,” Pepper says and knocks him in the arm.
“Well, then tell me what happy little trees are doing in the Penthouse?”
Cho hovers over him as Tony recedes. “Captain, we’re going to give you a sedative. It should work since the serum hasn’t been functioning well lately. We think you should go under as we do this. There’s no reason to panic.”
Steve spins around and studies all of them. “Did you know? Did all of you know all these years?” The rage runs hot in him, burns the back of his throat. “Tony, did you know?”
A swooshing wind barrels into them, shoving them both to their backs. Steve is the first to recover and he crawls over to Tony, hooks a hand under his arm and heaves them both to their feet. He ignores the creeping sensation of the world fragmenting around them, each wind gust peeling back layers that reveals only a void of nothingness and darkness beyond. Ultron has an outer rim of existence; they just need to get to it.
Frowning, Steve says, “Just shut the fuck up.” He spits in his hands.
“Damned guards,” Tony mutters and his glasses light up. He keys into the local network and it feeds him information, specifically detailing the discovery of the omega – in the Hillside Facility on Arctica. The stasis container had failed years ago according to the data. The omega survived somehow and when discovered was revived only to be used in training exercises since he refused to talk or answer questions. It was theorized based on facial records and partial genetic records still available after the Uprising, that the omega might have been synced to a member of the Carbonelli Family. Tony smiled at that little factoid. Things were falling into place. And that slight niggling in the back of his mind came to the fore.
“The one we occupy.”
She smiles but this time it’s just sad. She wishes she had that kind of optimism still, but at least Sam’s here. At least his hope might help them through it. She glances at the read out on the screen above their heads. It flashes.
The Plexiglas doors to his workshop slid open and Steve entered with a file folder tucked under his arm. At first sight, he looked no different than he did yesterday afternoon, but on closer inspection, Tony glimpsed the lines of exhaustion on his face. He even detected a hint of sadness the way he held his shoulders and the slight down turn of his mouth.
He clears his throat. “There’s a towel on the rack. Switch next to the tub there to turn it off.” He pulls out his phone and shakes it. “I gotta go.” He has no idea if Steve will understand his ruse, that he needs to go to take a call – which is false – but he doesn’t care. He can’t think of Steve that way. Sure, it’s okay to appreciate the man’s perfection, but to dissolve into him, to long for it. No. There is no way.
Jane smiles, tired and sad. “Yeah. Thanks Steve.”
CHAPTER 7
“I became friends, comrades in arms with Steven first before I knew who Captain America was,” Thor added.
“I can tell. You haven’t stopped eating in the last fifteen minutes. I’m thinking I might need to protect my arms or something,” Tony says with a little laugh at the end.
Lying back on the couch, Steve huffs out a breath. “I think that’s it. There’s not much else I can do.”
Now Tony’s features shift again. He offers a hand to Steve to help him stand and they both climb to their feet together. Tony doesn’t release him. “What’s wrong? Obviously, there’s something wrong or something bothering you that’s been an issue since you left-.”
He races down the stairs, skipping them and bashing into the wall, cracking it. He slams through the door and rushes toward Tony’s house on the opposite side of the Main Street and in the back alley way. Several onlookers call to him, but he ignores them and heads straight toward the old blacksmith shop and the houses behind the main thorough fare of Avenge. Clamoring up the few wooden steps he pounds on the door.
I am very sorry that this is late. Hope you enjoy it. Some warnings in the end notes.
Rhodey and Happy eye him but Steve gets into the helicopter, going to the back and sitting on the floor. Happy glares at him. “Nope, everyone’s gotta get in a seat and strap in. Safety first.”
Tony draws away, panting hard against Steve. His hand slides down and grasps Steve’s erection. “How far can we go? How far?”
Steve screwed up his mouth but continued his battle with the cooked-on cheese. “I just want you to know, Tony, that I realize how hard this is going to be for you.”
“No. No, you’re not,” Steve replies. He runs a hand through his hair and then gently touches Tony’s jaw. “I’ll be back, but I have an errand to do for the Brothel. It’s something I should have done sooner, but I thought I could hold off.”
“And this Stark person you seem to be spending time with?” Sam asks and while his tone is light, his expression stays wary.
“Starting with the Mantra, because I mean – why not?” Tony twisted up his mouth and quirked his brows at Steve. “The Core is the Soul. The Core is in me. I am the Soul.”
“We could get a nanny,” Steve suggests, though neither of them want that.
Tony reaches out because his brain is scattered and confused; that rarely, if ever, happens to him. He touches Steve’s wrist. “Steve, I’m not sure what you’re trying to say to me.”
“Yes, yes you did.” Tony lays his head on Steve’s shoulder. “You did and I know exactly how you feel about it. I know exactly who you are. You know how angry I was about it. You know me.”
“That’s incredible! Truly fascinating. I suggest you come to my lab-.”
He jolts awoke, panting. The sun is still high and the heat of the day has begun to settle over their small town. He presses the heels of his hands into his eyes and sits up, swinging his legs over the bed. Bending over he breathes in and out, trying to wrestle with the horror of his memories more so than the terror of his nightmares.
“I’m going to let him rest for a while. I’ll call for tea and soup in a bit.”
Tony noticed the glare from Natasha and she grasped Bruce’s hand, stopping him from following Hill. “Right now, we need you to take care of Tony. Steve’s in the best hands.”
A troop of V-Corps agents met them at the corner. Natasha flew into action as Tony flung the gurney toward the wall. The coven mistress grabbed one of the agent’s arms as he swung around to hit her with one of his wood spiked gloves. The air around her warbled, a high pitch whistle and then she yanked hard, pulling the guy at the same time she kicked him in the balls. Half of his body shifted through space and dimensions while the other half ended up lifeless on the floor. Without pause Natasha jumped on the next agent as the others scattered along the doorways and hallways of the corridor. That would make it more difficult to hit them, but Clint shot off two arrows as Tony felt the heat warm his palms. Natasha leapt onto one of the agents, swinging her legs over his head and then the air wobbled about her and she arched backwards into the void.
He retracted as fast as he could, closing it off, shutting down, building walls around it. He didn’t think Natasha or Bruce saw it. But as he opened his eyes, Wong studied him, his mouth in a tight pucker, his eyes studious and dark.
He stood up and shuffled to the bathroom. Turning on the faucets he bent over the sink and threw the cool water on his face, ran it through his air, and then gripped the counter. His eyes landed on the scarring along his arm. He never really looked at it anymore. Not the band that marked him first as leader, and not the many brands that scarred his whole arm, with Tony’s traveling up to his chest. He shrugged off the suit jacket and the shirt and tie. He tossed his undershirt to the floor and stared at the markings – soul scars – over his arm and on his torso and chest. He hadn’t admitted it to himself or to anyone, but the one on his chest – Tony’s mark – grew and flourished every time he had one of those potent dreams. Across his whole chest and down his torso the markings stretched. Complex geometric figures and patterns. He wondered if Tony had the same markings and if so how far they went.
Lowly, Steve asks, “And Ana, do you picture her as your mother?”
“I don’t know, Bruce, I really don’t. I told you about the crackles?” Tony takes a sip of his coffee. It’s bitter and cold. “Well, there’s more. I’ve been getting this feeling like I’m being shadowed, like someone is stalking me. I get this image of like dark inky tentacles or vines coming after me. I don’t know.”
“Is that what you think of me? As your captor?” Tony asked and he felt like his meal turned cold in his gut.
“It’s the tech and the war that changed him. After his parents were assassinated, he sobered up. He stopped partying and doesn’t really date or court anyone.”
“Having the ability to shoot doesn’t mean you should have the power to do so,” Fury states.
Thor slaps Tony on the back. “I do not understand your bonding rituals or your biological needs any more than I understand my brother’s magic, but there are many things in this universe I was not meant to understand. I am pleased to know you have such a stalwart and worthy omega by your side. Do him well, and he shall serve you well.”
Flipping the thumb drive over in his hand, Steve stares at it like it might turn into a viper and bite him. “Hmm. I. Really?”
“Thor, I was only gone a few hours,” Steve said as they parted.
As Tony turns away to retrieve some of the small amount of water he has, Steve mutters under his breath. “It isn’t working. I can still feel them. You have to get me out of here.”
Steve lifts his shoulder. “I don’t really know. I’m partial to Daredevil right now, I suppose because I did some of the variant covers that are offered in the current run.” Steve indicates the resume again, and then clasps his hands in his lap. It’s becoming obvious to Steve that he’s not really interested in study his resume, so Tony needs to address that little fact.
Further down, Tony sees that Steven still wears what Tony calls the cock belt. It locks around Steven’s balls, keeping them stretched slightly. On a normal day like today, Tony kept the stretch uncomfortable but livable. On the other hand, Steven’s cock has been held in the flaccid position so that he may relief himself but not get hard. Even now, Tony spots the purple of the head of his cock as it strains against the metal shaft around it keeping it in place. Steven’s bare feet are in the gully around the pole, locked and spread wide. With that position, Tony can easily access his ass and the gully compensates for the height difference.
Silence greets him, but then Steve agrees. “Yes.”
“On my way,” Sam yelled back.
A hand appears on the bottle he grasped. “No.”
God, Jarvis really does hate him. Steve closes his eyes because he can’t stomach it. His headache morphs into a full-blown nuclear explosion in his head. He swears he can feel the beat of his blood in his temples.
He wonders what world Steve woke up to that led him here to this damaged life.
Tony watched Thor leave, the lightheartedness of his story lost to distance. His mind juddered like a boat without mooring, hitting the dock and then being lost to the ocean. He knew he should query about Steve again, find out what was happening, but his mind failed him. He couldn’t anchor, no matter what he did. Clint stepped closer as Natasha reached out to Tony.
When Tony really concentrated on her he glimpsed a phantom speaking from beyond the grave. Of course, that was just ridiculous, but he stood there transfixed as she urged her son to succeed, to continue, to live.
Now – now Tony was mostly likely up on the roof, dying a slow and painful death as Steve hung from chains in the basement prison cell. Only a single bare bulb shined down on him. A circle of light showcased him. He was stripped to his undershorts. The knife wound in his abdomen still dripped, trailing down his inner thigh to a puddle of blood on the concrete floor. There was a small drain grate below him, he knew. The grate was used to wash away the blood and other bodily fluid. His feet barely reached the floor at all. Shackles linked his ankles to the floor, so he couldn’t swing out and use his legs as a defense.
Tony rubs his thumbs against the backs of Steve’s slim hands. “It’s all I can ask for, isn’t it? We all have places in this god awful society. But -.” He stops and doesn’t elaborate. Instead he goes on a different track. “This cock warming, I’m a little spent from earlier. I probably won’t even get it up for a few hours.”
“He used his Pym particles for the return of the stones. He told me it took several tries.”
“There’s loyalty, Clint, and then there’s- well a little too much?” Steve said.
Steve slips his fingers out and then waits as Tony calms himself, his erection is bloody hot and throbbing with need. Taking the tube, Steve lubes his cock and then positions it right at Tony’s entrance. He circles the head around and both of them moan in unison. “I’m gonna fuck you now. Bare. I’m gonna bare back it.”
“Yes, and I forgave you.” Steve glances at the shower and then the lotions. “Now, you said something about a shower?”
“Silly, silly boy,” Tony says and climbs onto Steve’s lap. He straddles Steve and runs his fingers through his hair, and he busies himself with kissing every inch. He starts at Steve’s lips, wanders along his jaw up to his eyes and then back to his lips. Kissing Steve frees Tony. He’s been bound by chains, hard and unforgiving for nearly a decade. The experiences he’s had in the love department can only be qualified as quick fucks – except for Pepper. Each and every one night stand he offered so little to, they never wanted to return. Now, as he molds himself to Steve, the tension, the fear, the lack of understanding melts away and he longs to lay himself bare for Steve. All of him.
The beat of tension ran through him, echoing in his stone heart and in his petrified lungs. “Shit, this isn’t good.”
“I need to use the bathroom,” Steve says and shrugs off Tony’s help. “I can do this. I’ve been potty trained since I was two.”
Except for the moment when he declared that Bucky and the Maximoff twins would not be staying in the Tower, Tony remained unresponsive. Steve brought him to the bed as soon as he entered the room. He laid him down and then sat next to him. Images rebounded in the bond, sights and sounds Steve barely grasped. In many ways the pictures in his head reminded him of watching two different movies edited together. He cupped his hand around Tony’s fist.
Natasha scowls at him. “I had a feeling you were going to say that. I’ll see what I can do to keep it on the quiet. But this is it, Steve, if anything and I mean anything like this happens again, we report it and file a complaint.”
“Can I see you again, Captain?”
He steps away from her as she slips on her glasses. “I don’t need anyone. I have  Jamison and Harry.” He knows he needs an omega; he won’t be permitted to take the High Alpha Chair without one. He won’t be part of the Council if he doesn’t have an Omega warrior. The warrior is not only a status symbol but a shield against any threats or challenges to his status as the Lord of the Stark Family. “I could use an android.”
“Sure.”
“That hurts,” Bruce whispered.
“Yes,” Steve says, his words are low, quiet, tentative.
“For God’s sake man, no,” Steve says and the pit of his stomach turns over that his little display of offense misrepresented his intentions so wildly.
“It means that the interface might get leaky. And then for sure the bastard will be able to infiltrate our minds, not to read them, but to damage them.” Tony states the last part slowly and with purpose, eying Steve as if he wants to make sure that another phase out of the virtual world isn’t imminent.
“Not necessary. Contrary to popular belief, I can rough it once in a while.”
“Less of the old school, more of the new,” Stark says and he’s appraising Steve, his eyes are critical and intense in their expression. Steve can appreciate a man who doesn’t trust immediately.
As a child he learned about an unblemished nation, but of course, those were fairy tales. Every nation on Earth carried its burden of the past – its sins and transgression. America just seemed to carry more because every single advance forward was marked with steps backward and the blood of the innocent. As a symbol of that country, Steve recognized years ago his duty to be more, to stand taller, to be the kind of person that a desperate, blemished country needed. Yet he was as stained and as tarnished as the rest.  Maybe once he could have done it, but now?
Tony sits on the side of the cot. He should name him as the Red Knight but what harm would it do to give the demon a name. It might even lend him some power over the cursed creature.
Friday interrupts him again as he listens for Steve’s groan of frustration. It’s muted but there as an undercurrent. “Boss, I think you should see this.”
“Please what?”
Steve doesn’t mention that Ultron probably already knows. He accepts Tony’s explanation and tugs on the cable. It’s strong and will hold for the climb. It’s not a steep rise, but the wind works against them, so they need the rope as a guide if not for anything else.  He grapples to get Tony leashed to him. They mutually and silently decide it’s for the best if they each climb up individually. Tony goes first, using the rope to hoist himself up the slippery surface. Steve spots him, ensuring there’s no accident. His eyes have adjusted to the weirdness – the perfect perspective, the finite details. His brain still scrambles to make sense of it, but he can ram through the nausea. He did it enough as a young man.
Steve turns his attention to the selection of outfits and picks a simple dark mock turtleneck shirt with long sleeves and a pair of white casual pants. He puts on his sandals and then emerges from the closet to find Tony drinking down coffee and paging through his tablet holo-images.  When Tony looks up at him his mouth drops open and he mouths the word ‘wow’.
Steve skidded to a stop. He panted as he gripped both of Tony’s shoulders. “You have to pull it together Tony. How they did it doesn’t matter. Not anymore. They’re here to clean this place out. To take away everything you worked for, to-.”
Tony goes to the bureau, opens a drawer, and digs out a pair of boxers for Steve. He throws them to him and says, “Okay then, that’s it. We need to get you back where you belong and forget our attraction. Like my hotness I know is a difficult thing to resist- but for the good of all humankind and all.”
“You said-.”
“Maybe I hope for something a little more authentic.” Steve stops for a moment, but the starts up again. “Strike that. I have no business asking that of you.”
Tony tucks his hands under his armpits. They are both soaked to the bone and the wind whipping through the thin forest freezes. “That shouldn’t have happened. There’s no way he knows.”
Steve abandons his task and turns around to face Tony. “We’re really doing this?”
"You said that," Steve replies and thinks he might be lost, he might surrender every part of himself that he normally keeps so reserved and closed inside. Steve breaks away, folding his hands in his lap. He cannot do this, it isn't right.
“Agreed,” Ross said and turned to the hulk of an agent. “Get the hose. And the lines, please. Punishment is the best way to get that serum active.”
The shadows covered them like a black fog and the chill settled in his bones as he hit the button. Natasha said, “Not down. Up.”
Natalie seems to appreciate Furin – often called Fury by most – only glowers at him. “Presentation suite talk aside, I think we have quite an issue to deal with. Estane and Rossi are making a move for that chair.”
Tony glances at the big man and then at Steve. “May we have a minute?”
As they wobble with Steve perched on the edge of the chair, Tony breaks the kiss and flickers his gaze back and forth from Steve’s mouth to his eyes and back again until finally he pulls them apart. “Captain, I want this to be something special for you. Not just a roll in the hay.”
“I got that one? Great. Now you – you’re hot for Captain America – everyone on Earth knows that and probably a few other planets too.  Let me amend that – everyone in the known universe, except for Captain America himself. So, you probably made a move on him and he ran scared.” She’s excellent at profiling. Scary accurate in fact. “How’s that?”
“Do you have a problem with gays?” Tony asks, still holding Steve’s hand.
“Happiness. Love,” Steve says, and he doesn’t mean to, he never means to and maybe that’s his problem. He has a control issue. He stares pointedly at Tony, his hand comes up and touches his cheek, cradles his jaw. “Maybe it wasn’t mine to find.”
“It is 3 am, sir.”
“My point is-. It’s – it’s family isn’t it. We’re all here for one reason. We want to take care of our family. Maybe we were poor as kids and scraped our way up, or maybe you’re someone like me born with the shiny silver – hell not even silver – vibranium spoon in my mouth. But I get it. I get how important it is to reach out, to care, to send a message.
“Both of you have been altered by a serum. Both of you have sought out ways to help humanity because of your alternations. The astral plane and your projections on it were similar enough for the energy waves to synchronize.”
bullshit! He sleeps every chance he gets. He can’t help but smile at his internal joke.
“I can’t stop loving him. That is not going to happen,” Tony said. Today things had changed for Tony. Something stirred inside of him, something awoke. Maybe for the first time he admitted to himself that Steve was something more than a mate. He was a love – a once in a lifetime (undead) kind of love.
“It’s just a book. Why do you always have to ruin everything?” Howard slammed the door on the way out.
“It’s romantic,” Natasha says and the little laughter in her voice fades away. “But tragic. This one Prime pairing is supposed to be the one true pairing. It’s like King Arthur. The once and future pairing.”
The dawning might have blinded him if it had been any brighter. “Wow, I didn’t -. I hadn’t thought about that.”
"Well look at our Souls. Ain't they sweet on one another?"
“Obviously,” Tony agrees. He tinkers with it for a few minutes as Steve completes his task of engulfing the rest of his pancake-bacon sandwiches that are drown in syrup. As Tony works he asks, “Ever get tired to eating so much?”
Natasha uses her nails to dig into his hair. “Always use protection for penetration. I don’t abide my barebacking. Keep yourself clean and shaved. I’m going to do it for you this first time. But you should probably learn how to do it yourself. If you don’t like to do it, one of the other workers can always give you a hand.” She rinses his hair. “Keep your face shaved too. Some clients have a certain type and you’re it. They don’t want to see hairy faces.”
“Yes. It is.” Tony’s smile is far away as if he’s lost in some dream, lost in some faded memory of how the scenery looks. But then he surprises Steve. “The ocean – just listen to it – listen to how it hits the rocks and the sands below the cliff.”
“Okay?” Steve says as Tony pulls off the helmet.
The little girl with pretty brunette curls and wide brown eyes points to a chocolate chip cookie in the case. “Please?”
Tony stares at the stovetop but then busies himself with the coffeemaker. It would be a hoot if Tony’s own killer bot hadn’t a clue about how to make coffee. Oh, how many hours of entertainment that would bring, especially to someone like Clint.
On the night he finds out that his company is still in the arms business and, worse yet, trading arms to terrorists – everything changes. It becomes not a hobby or an afterthought but a mission. His life clarifies and his vision becomes acute and focused. He’s never known or understood drive like this before and he takes off in the armor with a singular idea.
The next thing he knows the alpha seizes his hair and drags him to the rack. “I told you not to come. I told you not to close your eyes.”
“All I can say is that I was drunk, and I have no excuse for my behavior. I never could hold my liquor and I should have known better,” Steve says. He’s always been one to own up to his mistakes. “I apologize.” He can’t make himself look at Tony.
As he starts away, Steve yells out, “I can’t, because it would bond us, completely.”
JARVIS asked, “Captain?”
“Well, we need to do something. He’s not in good shape. That constant stress can’t be good for him?” Sam directs the last at Cho who only nods.
Bruce tilted his head and quirked his brows. “What’s that?”
“God, you really do hate me,” Tony hissed.
“Maybe,” Steve said. “Not sure.” He got the hoody off as he drove toward Sam’s place.. The woman saw them stealing the truck, so how long they would be able to drive around without being detected was a gamble.
The first almost positive reaction – a blush colors the man’s cheeks. He looks down at the food in front of him rather than at Tony. “You don’t want me. You shouldn’t. I was bonded with another alpha. It didn’t turn out well, as you know.”
“Fix,” the man screams at Steve again and kicks the cot. Tony only grumbles in his sleep.
“I can’t, you aren’t even-.” Steve clipped off his words and walked down the corridor trying to escape Tony’s hurt expression. Explaining to Tony that any interaction with him had been more like talking with a stranger was harder than Steve expected. Instead, he’d said something softer, “You don’t remember your time as a Courtesan.”
Steven keeps his head bowed as his gland seeps the bonding secretions and a touch of blood. “What transgressions?”
“Is that a threat to the law, sir?”
Steve huffs. “Yeah sure. I’m fine. Aren’t I supposed to be just fine as a whore? No issues here.”
Rumlow sniffled and wiped at his nose again. Just that motion made Tony wonder if the man did lines of coke to ease the boredom in this place. Rumlow shook his head and stared Pepper in the eyes.
When Jarvis is out of earshot, Tony frowns. “He’s lying. He always lies to me. Ana is sick and he hasn’t told me yet.”
As he swings open the door, Steve scans the room and notes the large bed with the canopy. He still throws wagers around trying to get Natasha to fess up how she managed to get that monstrosity out in the middle of the Western Territories near the Rocky Mountain range. She's always been coy about it, but insanely proud as well. On top of being a massive bed (the grandest he's ever seen) it's well appointed with linens and cushions and pillows and one of Aunt May's beautiful quilts. Next to the bed is a small night stand with a lantern burning, but what draws his attention is the table near the window.
Steve frowns at him. Captain America disapproving of him hurts a lot more than he will ever confess.
“Right,” Tony says. There’s a particular part of the family tree he’s focused on. Tony examines it. “That’s an interesting branch you’re looking at.”
Tony scowls again. He clicks on his glasses and a scroll of the different news outlets starts past his visual field. He can do without this conversation entirely. As a member of a wealthy family and therefore qualified for rank among the Council members, Tony never received any modification. He’s a pure human. Not like a vast number of betas. He relies on accessories instead of modifications.
Steve tried not to let the remark color his association of this meeting with its possible outcomes. Impossible dreams seemed to be his forte. With the lingering memories of his dream last night, Steve hoped that he could at least start mending fences. He might not be able to give Tony the kind of relationship he wanted, but he could at least extend an olive branch. “Doctor Strange, Wong,” Steve said and inwardly winced. He still didn’t know how to address Wong – was it Mister? Sorcerer? Something else? No one told him and he felt on unsteady footing all the time. “We asked you both here to give us more guidance on how the soul pack and the members should interact. There’s been some -.” He stopped and adjusted his wording. “Disagreements on how some members should be accepted or not.”
“That can’t be it. The Secretary wouldn’t come just for one unit-.” Tony stopped and swallowed down his fear. Steve’s open objections to the V-Corps policies would get him killed one day. “They suspect something, don’t they?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He concentrates on the display, the image of Tony Stark. He doesn’t have any choice, this is it. He’s never not stood up to a challenge. He can do this, he’s up for it. “Yes, sir.”
No time to consider the consequences now. Steve heaved himself to his feet and went to the closet. He pulled out his pants and shirt. He dressed as quickly as he dared considering the room spun around if he moved too fast. He grabbed hold of his holster for the shield and clipped it on, and then slipped on the shield. He felt whole and protected with the shield, even though he wasn’t certain he could actually throw it with any accuracy at this point. Going to the bedside table, he retrieved the Gatorade there, snapped it open, and drank it down. He pulled out the door, searched around and found the iron pills. He down a few and finished off the rest of the Gatorade.
Tony feels the heat flush to his cheeks. He's saved from answering the young woman by a voice from the stairs. "You okay, Nat?"
Tony clicks off the phone. Whatever happened, he’s at a lost to figure it out. He immerses himself in the problem at hand – the rewiring of the ancient whole house generator. Hours later he hears the door slam upstairs and his heart skips a beat. The thought of Steve venturing outside during a literal blizzard terrifies him more than he wants to say. He drops his tools and races upstairs to find that – no Steve hadn’t just left he was actually returning from chopping wood apparently. He carries a huge armload of split logs in his arms.
“Well eventually I suppose you should file for divorce.” Steve looks a little pale as he states this between pizza bites. “I know you don’t want to be tied down to me.”
His mother.
The ache never ends.
“And this is hardly roughing it,” Tony snickers. He claps Steve on the arm as he heads back toward the stairs. “You want some lunch? I’m starved.” Which is not true, but what the hell else is he supposed to do?
Steve gasps and then breathes out. “Need you to touch me. Just touch me.”
“Tony!” Bruce called as Tony escaped the room.
He peered over the cliff into the abyss where the stars disappeared and then he looked back at Sol in the distance beckoning him. Implicitly he understood the question. Fundamentally, Steve yearned to be warmed inside to his bones. The sun offered him that pleasure. He longed for the heat of it. For ages he’d been chilled and paralyzed by the cold. He gazed down into the chasm – where the cosmos elongated and vanished.  The darkness echoed back to him, the coldness sweeping through him. A pulse and he felt the life he would leave behind and the beautiful agony ached.
That got his attention completely, and he balled up the holographic projects and tossed them to the save folder. “What? JARVIS didn’t report anything to me.”
She reached over and clasped his hand, brushed a finger along his wrist soul mark. “Some times you need to let the leader go and allow us to be your pack. It’s not just about protecting us, Steve. You know that. Let us in. I can feel you pulling away.”
“Steve,” Peggy said quietly. Her hand lightly brushed his arm but did not stay. “You can live here peacefully and no one will think anything of it. No one will think poorly of you. You deserve some peace and some safety. But if you decide that it isn’t enough, if you decide that you have fight left in you, then we’re here for you. We’re waiting. We want to change things. We’re not going to settle again. This is the beginning, not the end. This is the start of it.”
"Fuck you Rog-." Rumlow starts to shriek but his words are strangled silent and he pitches backward off the conveyer.
“Not from where he’s coming from. You have to let him have this Tony. You’re not going to want to breakdown that wall unless you’re there to commit to picking up the pieces.”
Tony presses a finger on his lips. “It’s just a little thing.” Steve rolls his eyes. He tries to change the subject. “She loves the new book, you know. Best seller. The kids are going wild over it.”
In a low voice Steve murmured, “Two more will take its place.”
Luke puts a finger to his lips. “Shush. Don’t tell her that I have my eye on another.”
The amusement riled Tony even further. “What the hell? No, you’re bonded now. To me, to all of us, you can’t throw your life away like that anymore. You can’t pilot planes into the ocean or even take on Hydra all by yourself – and I don’t care that you had Nat and Sam. Sam was new to all of this and Nat was injured if I remember correctly. No, you don’t get to do this without the pack’s okay.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” he lies.
“It’s marvelous.”
Tony stopped him with a hand on the book. “No, you can read it if you want. I just didn’t realize anyone was going to start studying right away.”
“Are you sure? I know it’s a lot to take in,” Natasha said but didn’t move.
Stark had gone away. Stark had disappeared never to return.
Steve peeks in and says, “Bruce? Nat wants me to get my screening early.”
When Tony opens the door, he sees Steve standing by a messy bed. His face is flush and his eyes red. “I wanted to tell you something.”
Before any other reporter could say anything more, Tony put his one hand up as his other clutched Steve’s shield. He drew on his years of experience with the media to gather the courage to speak, to keep his voice strong and unbroken, to present the face of the Avengers.
“Steve, how is-.”
“I want to leave,” Steve said and then realized he’d said it out loud.
Post-AoU where Tony is ostracized from the rest of the Avengers - and there's a problem with Vision. This was going to be an exploration of the theory of the mind, consciousness, and intelligence. It was a story of transcendence. But the CA:CW came along and killed my inspiration for this story completely....
Blu glances at the ground and sees the light then turns back to Tony.
. Then Tony pieced it together with the long ago meeting with Clara Fury revealed. SHIELD, Coulson. It had been a place and a name. Fury was still inside, Coulson was a good man. SHIELD had been the place – the place that Fury had been still inside. The place he’d found that Rumlow worked. He could have gone down farther into the rabbit hole, but he didn’t. He’d put everything aside once he figured out he was dying of Palladium poisoning. Why bother with the dead?
Drying his hands on a towel, Steve nods. “Well, at least we’re safe and sound here. Unless we lose electricity-.”
“Fuck. Do it!” His own cock drips. He’s always been a messy lover; it’s something that his clients have loved because he’s so very responsive but this – this gush of pre-come is for Tony only. He’s never been this needy, this wanting.
Throughout dinner, Steve relished the feeling, soaked in it. He smiled at Tony, enjoyed the moment, and wondered if the feeling expanding over him, through him, might be that he was falling in love.
Tony takes in the sight before him – how the rest of his family, his clan, literally sank into their seats. They melt with exhaustion and their eyes are dull with the relief of finally going home. But Steven is still working, still watching and protecting. He’s not only on watch as Tony’s protector but he’s also securing the clan. As an alpha Tony has the urge to lead, to bring together those coalitions, to see the future and shape it. For the first time, Tony can see and understand how an omega reacts and acts in a situation. As Tony is compelled to shoulder the responsibility of seeing his clan through the future, Steven is just as compelled to protect and serve. It’s written in his genes, in the code of his life.
Without looking up, Tony said, “Just promise me, after I’m gone, that you find a way to save him.”
“Think she’ll call the police?”
It would be nice to get away from the reality of what’s crashing down on him in the next few hours (probably) but he needs to be prepared. “Sure, invite him to the breakfast nook.”
When he wrote the letter he wanted to explain to Tony why he had to cut out his bonding gland. His purpose seemed clear enough to him, but he thought it might confuse other people, especially Tony. He didn’t want to seem like a basket case, though he thought at some points in time he might be dissembling into one. The letter became his cornerstone, the foundation of his new status. He had hoped the letter would help to explain his reasons and his wishes.
As if reading his mind, Steve calls from outside the room. “We can still exchange if you want. I think I got the biggest room.”
“Stare of death.”
“Good to know,” Tony said. He really only wanted to get this over with. He needed to know if he could humanely release the creature or if he needed to put it down. How? He didn’t know. His hands shook as he put on his glasses. “How about we get the show on the road?”
Opening the door to the hospital room, Tony steps inside and nods to the nurse. She gives Tony a smile and returns to her work on the computer. Her patient is quiet, unmoving in the bed. It’s been days since the seizure. News outlets have been badgering them for an update on Captain America. Pepper’s been fielding all of the calls, which is all kinds of wrong. It should be Fury or Hill or someone from SHIELD. Somehow or another a spy organization is not good at dealing with the paparazzi. Pepper is, she’s a genius. He’s grateful to her. How she spins no change into anything other than no hope, Tony can’t guess.
The words are said sensually, seductively, but Steve reads them differently – as a plea or a confession. He grips Tony’s shoulders and doesn’t break their shared gaze. “Then show me?” It’s a risk, to play this game, putting his heart on the line in his business only means ache and pain in the end. He might not have a lot of time as a sex worker, but he knows how it goes for a forgotten class – it’s not like he’s ever been on the top of the pile.
“Headache is okay. Lot less tension. I swear you could patent your hands,” Tony replies. He reaches out and Steve lays his fingers in Tony’s palm. He cups them with his other hand. Tony runs his fingers up the length and back of Steve’s hand, over the hill of his knuckles and to the tendons. His thumb cups underneath and slowly strokes Steve’s palm. A slight quaver and Tony desperately wants to know what Steve’s eyes look like. Are his eyes large and dark? Is there curiosity there or yearning? He tells himself that if he could read what Steve’s expression is then he would understand his own feelings – the deep need inside of him that tightens and coils. These hands have meant the world to him, a portal to the world. They’ve been there to calm and soothe him, to guide and assist him. Always gentle yet firm. He can only imagine what talents they might possess.
This isn’t good, this isn’t good at all.
“It is if they’re heirs to the fortunes of Odinson,” Steve says – the family name is practically royalty.
“So, the Revelation has contaminated my righteous knight.”
“You did quite a job on poor Brock. He was in surgery for ten hours.” Ross flicked an eyebrow. “Couldn’t save the pinky. You crushed the bone with your teeth. That’s amazing, Captain. I didn’t know you were such a brutal bastard.” He snapped his fingers.
“Well soul packs are kind of new thing for all of us according to Strange. It’s weird thinking about how our lives changed because he played with time. How soul bonds and packs are a thing we all accept as real now, but only a few years ago they never existed and we didn’t know about them.” Bruce led him down the hallway to the laboratory. Steve glanced around with a wash of guilt at the mess. Bruce seemed to read his mind. “Don’t worry about it. I think I’m going to start meditating again. It’ll help both of us. Calm our link.”
“Can you blame me? This is the stuff of classic novels. You know the wilds of Canada?” Steve says and then adds, “And that kitchen is really out of this world Tony.”
The cold seeps into his bones as they move through the dark forest. The moons of the Gavin 6 are only chunks of rocks without much distinction or shape. It’s the large hive in the night sky that reflects the twin stars’ light towards the planet. It hulks in the sky like a mass of skulls built on top of one another. There’s something ugly and nightmarish about it. It isn’t finished; the scaffolds brace around it. He doesn’t like to think about it; he’s heard the stories of the Death Stars from the Empire. If the Red Skull is constructing another one then they are surely doomed. Their little conclave of scholars and artists with a smattering of Sentinel Guards will never be able to take out the Sith Lord and his plans for galactic dominance.
“It’s a love story-.”
“You and Steve.”
Tony’s expression turns to steel, his eyes tight, his mouth a thin line. “Yes. It doesn’t look good.”
“Maybe.”
“Weird. It’s all weird.” Tony crinkles his forehead. His headache blasts like some of the heavy metal music he listens to while working. He pushes the tightness constricting his eye sockets away and asks, “What kind of weird questions?”
Alpha leans into him, his body a force against Steve. He feels the man’s hot breath against his neck and trembles with need. He wants to beg, he wants to vow allegiance – it is his nature and he’s sick with it. The knot inside of him fills and stretches. He pants and sobs somewhere on the precipice between ecstasy and misery. This is how it has been for days. The anguish of it rides over him as he thrusts with a wild and brutal craving, yet trying to hold back at the same time.
The sky darkens in response and he shudders. His hands are stiff and frozen by the time they get to the downed jet. Ice clogs the entrance in the back of the Quin Jet. It looks like a giant iceberg grows out of the backend of the jet. There’s no getting into it that way.
“What?” Tony’s hand touched his shoulder. “What did you just say?”
“He’s okay. Out of the fugue. The doctors have him in a separate room. He’s beside himself with guilt and grief because of what happened,” Peggy said and cupped a hand to his face. “What you did for him, it’s nothing short of a miracle you survived.”
“How has the upgrade gone?” Wanda asks.
“You don’t have to. Having an Imprint is a burden.” A tear catches on his long eyelashes.
Over the next two hours Luke picks out, dresses and redresses Steve in various formal wear from uniforms, to suits, to robes. He has a hairstylist come in and work on Steve’s untamed mane. Makeup is purchased and he’s given a short but useful lesson on how to apply a bit of blush and eyeliner. Not much. Apparently, the prince likes a natural look above all else.
“I thought you’d said for the coven to scatter,” Steve said. He looked down at the hand clasped in his own – cold, pale. Tony hadn’t eaten in a while.
“Stop projecting them,” Tony teased and they lapsed into silence – still holding hands and staring into the fire. They sat together, quiet and abiding for a long time, but it felt like only seconds to Steve before Strange appeared.
“Well, that’s good because I don’t even know what it’s supposed to mean.” He yawns. “God, I’m tired. I hate these headaches. They take so much out of me, plus trying to remember all the code all the time is fucking impossible.”
“I was never good at memorizing them,” Steve had said. “I knew the big dipper and the little dipper but that was it.”
“Not that I know of, but these damned scientists are always hopping and skipping around the systems like there’s no fucking galactical war going on.” Tony rubs Steve’s shoulder, gripping it without much tenderness. “This conference has to go better than it is for this war to turn.”
“Bombs? You think they’re bombs aboard.” Steve tucks his robe around himself as if it will serve as protection.
“Are you my Guide now?” Steve asked.
Natasha asked, “You’re in charge now. How does it feel?”
After a heady weekend in Steve’s cramped studio apartment, Tony dressed and asked one more time for contact information. He straightened his tie as he looked down on Steve; he lie debauched and filthy in the too tiny bed. Tony didn't fail to notice how the marks upon his body faded away - nearly gone when they should have stayed for days and days. Somehow that hurt Tony. "Give me something. I hate trolling around looking for you."
Clint stepped into the light and Tony knew- knew at that moment that Clint had been the one to deliver the virus to his AI. That Clint – of all people – took down his sophisticated computer system and hacked into JARVIS. He recalled seeing Clint in the Security Center. Tony had thought he was just helping Happy out. Shit, what happened to Happy? What if they trace it back to Pepper? How will she get to safety?
Steve held onto the frame of the jet as the supplies were loaded. He stared out into the fields around them. “You know, Clint has a family and now he has this pack to deal with. And in a way it’s his extended family. We’re all family in the pack. Our job is Avengers, but the pack, that’s personal.”
“I’ll make real hot chocolate,” Steve states. By the looks of him, he needs this so Tony acquiesces. Sometimes a menial task helps right the mind. Tony’s done enough simple re-wires to verify that little fact.
“But I want to jump, Tony,” Steve said, and his words were practically whined. His hands trembled at he held onto Tony. Making such a leap might be easy in words but not in deeds.
“So, you did it. You separated me,” Steve says and tries to sit up.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake, that is not true. Now let me tell you about one vampire very dear to my heart. Her name is Peggy Carter and she knew Captain America!” Jarvis sat down at the kitchen table as his wife Ana came in and put on the kettle for tea.
“Yeah, I know.” He has no idea why he called her. “Maybe because you know him better than they do.”
He hobbles over to the hearth and checks the pot sitting on the fire. It bubbles with a thick stew. His stomach growls in protest. Part of him wonders why in death he’s still hungry while the other part just accepts that this is how it works in death.
She offers her hand and he accepts. Once she leave he picks up the tablet and starts to go through the different options and limitations. It’s a long list but what he finally decides on ends up being more self-flagellation than he’s willing to admit. As he finishes Samantha returns to the room and tells him that they have selected a few alphas that are currently available and willing to assist him in his presentation.
They weave their way through the brush, though the path is more distinctive now with their constant trudging of it each day. When they get to their stream – and it’s strange that Tony thinks of it as theirs – he bends down and scoops up some water to drink. Blu crouches and drinks directly from the creek. Tony splashes some of the water on his face and through his greasy hair. A quick dip won’t slow them down much. It shouldn’t take more than a half hour or so to walk to the designated pick up spot.
“Sure thing.” He leaves and the door whispers closed.
Steve licks his lips and stands, wanting to escape but grateful at the same time. “Thanks, Bruce. I’ll keep it in mind.”
She grabs his arm and her nails press into his wrist, daggers against the reinforced armor of his uniform. “I didn’t say he should be with Tiberius, I said he can’t be with you. Remember that Commander.”
“Yeah. Go. He’s starting the climb up.”
“JARVIS?”
“I can take the night off, if you want,” Steve says as he touches the bureau where he put the roll of money. “I got enough for now. We can get something to eat if you want, watch a movie.”
He tried to swallow but his throat ached and scratched. He shuffled to try and sit up, but Natasha placed her hand on his chest. “Stay put. You’ve been out for three days.”
She only raised a brow at him and then left.
Tony grips the steering wheel and thinks he might actually bend it as he says, “How the hell messier can it get?”
. Repeat it.”
“What?”
Steve thanks him. A pair of complete gloves instead of fingerless ones will do wonders for him. He puts on his helmet and while half his face is still exposed, at least he has some protection against the howling wind. He drops out of the wreckage into the deep snow. The top layer of snow is soft, but the bottom layer is hard with ice. It isn’t going to be an easy trek, regardless of which way they turn.
It’s Tony’s turn to fall silent. They journey the rest of the way to the meeting place without speaking. When they meet the helicopter, Rhodey and Happy are there along with the pilot, a doctor, and an animal caretaker. Tony only waves away the questions and climbs aboard. Steve remains in the grassy meadow. Peeking his head out, Tony instructs, “Come on, Adam, you need some clothes other than fig leaves. I’m sure we have something in here.”
“No, I want to hold you.”
“I thought we already figured that one out,” Tony said as he went through the newest diagnostics on the reactor. He never turned to look at her. “Ross declare all vampires enemies of the state?”
“No, thank you for believing in Clint,” Laura said and then went upstairs with Clint.
“What?” Steve screws up his face as if he’s trying to compute a quadratic equation in his head (which granted Tony can do, but most people can’t). “I don’t understand. You know?”
Steve shrugs. “Well, maybe I was comparing it to Star Trek. I’d watched a bunch of those with Sam and Natasha already. A few with Clint, too.”
It occurs to Steve that Tony is actually attempting some civility, giving Steve the choice, the ability to say no. He doesn’t want to say, no. He wants to plunge in and forget how singed his soul will be.
The word pierces his chest as if he’s been run through with a spear. He drops his own sword and stumbles back. His mouth gape open. “Wh-what did you call me?”
The Carbonellis – Tony knew them well. Very well. They had once been a small but influential family with regional ties on the fringes of the Council. In order to try and attain a stronger position within the Council of Worlds, the Carbonelli family offered fostering in their ranks so that children and adolescents could learn a little of their trade and the regional areas. The Lord – A’Danyel Carbonelli, also known as Dany, went to war with his warrior omega at his side during the Uprising. Everyone knew the story. The Viz gobbled it up like candy. Every single Carbonelli died in the Uprising and the Lord ended up lost in the last great battle against the omega rebels. The Council’s forces won but at great cost. The remaining omega rebels scattered to the Purge, leaving ruin in their wake. From that moment on, omegas were stripped of their remaining rights.
“So, we’re taking these children to the Lemurian Star only to move them to a secure location.”
“Heaven forbid. I was doing it for your benefit.”
“Don’t ruin the moment,” Steve says slyly. He tosses the chocolate and strawberry to the side. With practiced hands, he pushes the prince’s tunic up and unties his pants, slipping a hand into find a semi-hard cock. “What say I take away some of that stress?”
“Hey, hey. What are you doing? Bad kitty! Bad kitty!” The big cat stops and scowls at Tony in the dim light of evening. “Look what you did. You’re making a mess!” He marches over to the armor and starts to sort it again. Bending over hurts like hell but he’s too pissed to care. “This is not Dagobah and you are not an old Jedi Master. You don’t get to fuck with my stuff.”
“Come on Tones, we can have cheeseburgers. We’ll order in.” Rhodey sounds like he’s trying to placate Tony and part of him hates it and the other part knows that Rhodey is balancing something – trying to keep the peace.
Tony admits now that the flush of success warmed his chest more than he should have allowed.
“Great.” Tony nods. He waits for a full minute, watching Steve studiously and carefully place all his supplies exactly where he wants them. Sometimes, Tony thinks Captain America might be a little obsessive compulsive. “So, have you checked out the rest of the house? Picked a room?”
“And having hot sex while you won’t even consider it in real life. That is fucking rich!” Tony said. He threw himself back onto the couch. “And this is my life.”
He’d been getting ready to take off when she announced it. Stopping, he turned around and let the face plate lift. “You wouldn’t do that. You know I’m trying to do good, Pepper. Ever since, I’ve been trying to do good.”
“More so than the Negro or the Indian. You tell me, what makes someone equal, cowboy?”
He bites back his cry of horror.
Tony knew that Pepper was having an increasingly difficult time shuffling money his way. Prying eyes kept constant oversight on the Stark fortune. Every few months, Pepper needed to switch off shore accounts and change the route in which he received his funds.
“Stop being sexist, boss. You know I don’t have a gender. Plus, if I was a woman that would be very sexist and patronizing.”
“Son of a bitch-.” Tony turns and aims toward the village just as JARVIS notes.
Tony nods and wonders if the knock to the head might have sent this Army grunt cruising down the highway of make shit up. Tony knows all the stories about the legend of Captain Steve Rogers, and he never had any children. But Tony decides to let it be, if the Army grunt feels better lying about something like that it’s fine with him.  “But you didn’t tell me the story of Steve Rogers, well, you as Steve Rogers.”
“Please. Fuck, Steve. Please!”
“Sergeant James Barnes calling for Steve Rogers. Do you accept the call?” The automated voice is programmed in through the space dilation system.
In a flash Steve is off the bed and has his hand over Tony’s mouth. His facial expression stricken, his eyes wide with fear. “Don’t say it. You can’t say it. Ever. If they know then I can’t see you anymore. Do you get it?”
Steve pulls on the t-shirt; it is two sizes too small, but anything to cover up his wounds will do at this point. “Sure.”
It’s eerie hearing Steve’s voice knowing that he’s a few floors down, sleeping in that wonderland of hope and horror. There’s no visual but Tony feels his heart hammer in his chest.
Blowing up his mansion in Malibu hadn’t been on the list of priorities during the holidays (even if he didn’t technically launch the rockets at his residence, he’d been stupid enough to antagonize a terrorist). When it came to his suits? All of his armors created lovingly but in a fit of post-traumatic stress, those he blew up voluntarily because it was supposed to symbolize his love for Pepper and the next step on his recovery. It worked – to a degree. For a few blissful months he found a certain peace with leaving Iron Man behind him, leaving the mission of the world’s protection behind him. It helped to dissuade him from pressing too deep, from worrying about what might lie within. It helped to think about himself, but then images of his past haunted him – the past where he profited from war and death.  He tried to live a different life now, removing the armor and the glamour and become a more sedate mature version of himself. The media hounded him when he moved back to New York, looking for home. SHIELD called on him. More than once he had JARVIS turn their agents away. Tony wasn’t bound to them in any way even when Natasha appeared at his Tower in New York. His big ugly Tower with its empty Avenger floors that he needed to renovate again and make all of those memories and hopes disappear into the distant past.
