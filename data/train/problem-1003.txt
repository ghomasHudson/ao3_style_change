He didn't have to say it twice, she began on another long train of rants and conspiracies. He glanced at the clock. Ten minutes left of this, thank God. His phone vibrated again. He looked to see that she was preoccupied with a sheet of paper in her lap and pulled his phone out again and checked the message.
“No good?” Sherlock asked as he sat himself comfortably in the large chair, staring at him in his usual all-knowing manner.
John's receptionist, Mary, had married shortly before he closed his practice and he was thankful for her services. Sadly, she was murdered two years later while being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It wounded him to have found her body when Sherlock had been called to the case.
“Boring. History. Annoying.” Sherlock answered in his clip manner while picking at the chair he was on.
The other was in a deep ramble about how horrible her life was when he felt his phone vibrate. The woman kept going on and on and was looking off to the side so he quickly pulled his phone out. Nobody ever texts him, or call him for that matter, when they knew he was working.
“Sherlock, I know what it's like to be a teenager, your hormones are all over the place, but you really don't want this. You don't want an old man like me. Why don't you get with someone your own age?”
He pocketed his phone, assuming that would be the last of the messages but was surprised at the immediate vibration.
John quickly looked up, scared he just chased away the first person he found attractive in a long while. He went to say something when he realised Sherlock was glancing down the street in the distance, his curls hiding his eyes but his pale skin betrayed his embarrassment regardless of the little light cast in the street.
“How have you been today?” John asked, “Probably had a better day than me.” He smiled, thinking of Sherlock. He had never be attracted to a client before but Sherlock was different. John heard the phone ring so he got up and grabbed his phone, “Oh no” He groaned as he looked at the caller ID. He took a deep breath.
His brothers nagging was getting on his last nerve. He bit harshly down on his bottom lip, his eyebrows knitted tightly together as his nose crinkled in every possible show of anger possible.
"Brilliant." John murmured, a smirk playing at the edge of his mouth, "You definitely know how to make a drab day exciting."
John awoke with a raging erection. He quickly pressed the heel of his palm against the throbbing flesh and groaned in discomfort. He rolled out of bed, dodged the snoring Gladstone and padded into the bathroom to relieve himself. He entered his bedroom once again, sighing in relief as his morning wood became flaccid once more as he changed his clothes.
John heard the clock chime when it hit five o’clock; he smiled and grabbed his coat, exiting the office. He walked out to the lobby and saw Sherlock waiting outside.
John looked baffled over the text but slipped his shoes and coat on before walking outside. He saw the teen smoking while impatiently waiting. He started to wonder how Sherlock knew his address, but then again the teen was smart.
John looked up at Sherlock when he finished the long winded ramble, barely taking a breath between words. He smiled at the other and shook his head.
John was walking Gladstone in the park as he thought about his relationship with Sherlock. Well it wasn't really a relationship yet. He wasn’t sure how Sherlock felt about him; he knew how he felt about Sherlock, but the brunette was only seventeen. Most seventeen year olds were in and out of relationships. Sherlock wasn’t a normal teen and had never been in a relationship. So far they had only kissed once and mostly just spent time together; it was better than being alone in the flat. John liked his alone time and being with Gladstone but he still needed a human companion.
This stopped the teen cold who pulled away and stared at him, his eyes fierce as he growled out, “I have never been attracted to a single person in my life until I met you. I didn't even get erections outside of the morning kind. I've seen women naked, men naked, and not even a stir. I look on clinically detached to everyone. Everyone, but you.”
John quickly looked up, snatching a notebook that was in the shelf above his legs and a pen for such instances. He lifted them, “I am listening. Just keeping track of what you say.”
A tall, lithe man stood up, his features nearly incandescent in the halogen lights of the waiting room. He glided towards him and he outstretched a hand, "I'm Dr. Watso-"
John knitted his brows together as he thought over the night before. It hit him. He had asked to borrow his phone. He tilted his head back and groaned silently. The bugger had messaged himself didn't he. He went into his 'sent' messages and found one to the unknown number that was now known as Sherlock's.  He shook his head and saved it to his memory as 'obnoxious git' before sending a text back.
John nearly choked as he glanced up at the woman who was trying to look at him in a flirtatious manner. He coughed, looked away nervously before quickly glancing at her.
“How naughty.” The teasing baritone tickled his ears as the door clicked shut behind Sherlock, whom walked up to him with a bag, handing it over.
John cocked a brow, "Some brother. From what I understand he set you up here because you insulted someone of status?"
Mycroft stared after the athletic man, a look of longing on his features that quickly turned to one of exasperation as he heard the sound of glass breaking and curses. He sighed and went to get the first-aid kit.
Sherlock snorted, "I didn't lie, so what is his problem? The woman called me an idiot, so I figured I'd tell her husband that she was sleeping with his best friend."
He paid for it with his brothers credit card and took them. He went to leave when he felt a grip on his arm, “Sherlock Holmes?”
“What's it to you?” Sherlock growled, his manner getting defiant as he made his way into the personal space of the other, “Why is his friend bothering me?”
The two sat outside, talking for another hour before Sherlock headed home. John had work the next day and needed to sleep but, of course, that usually involved a wet dream of Sherlock. He took a deep breath and laid down to sleep, ready for those nightly dreams to commence once again.
John stared at him in confusion, his heart palpitating wildly as the teens musky scent filled his nostrils and his husky, deep, throaty voice filled his ears. His senses were nearly frayed in the overload of sensations.
He pushed playfully at Greg, the two chuckling before Greg left. John locked the door before heading to his wardrobe and changed into his pajamas. He settled into bed, trying to sleep but he just couldn’t stop thinking about today.  He mostly thought of his client, Sherlock Holmes, the teenager he shouldn’t even be attracted to. John figured he must be that lonely to be attracted to his seventeen year old client. He just shrugged it off and lay in bed going to sleep with Gladstone lying next to him.
John looked at him expectantly and he rolled his eyes, “Yes. They don't give a care. Trust me, I could be a prostitute and they wouldn't care as long as I didn't tarnish their name.”
John stared at him, his eyes wide before he smiled at the teen and leaned forward, brushing his lips to the others lightly.
“I should pay this fellow a visit.” He murmured, dropping the files on his table before getting up and making his way to his bedroom. A few hours sleep and he'll be right to test this bastard.
Lestrade leaned back in his chair, rubbing his eyes after hours of research. He pulled away from his laptop and made his way into the den, sitting down heavily on the sofa and flipping through some of the papers he printed. Sherlock wasn't a hard name to find due to it's obscurity, and with his connections and such he had found out the address of this Sherlock Holmes that his friend seemed to be wrapped up in.
John went to ask how when the other cut him off with, “You glanced in the direction of your house before hurrying after me. It's not rocket science, Doctor”
He flicked the cigarette on the ground, stomped on it and snuffed it out with a quick shuffle of his foot. He looked at John and muttered, “Why are you following me? You don't live in this direction, you live in the opposite direction.”
He tilted his head and thought of the therapist from that morning. That man was interesting. Hardly a punishment when something so stimulating was with him. He pitied the seven day long wait until he would see those intelligent blue eyes once more.
He bit his lip as he accepted the truth and let his hand work their magic on his lonely, aching need.
John woke up and saw the afternoon sunlight filter into the room, he looked at the clock and laid his head back on the pillow. He groaned as he felt a throbbing in his groin area; he ignore it, trying to go back to sleep since he didn’t have to work today.
John arrived home from work. He lived in a one bedroom flat that he had rented shortly after his wife kicked him out. It had been at least two months since she filed for divorce, he was glad it was going to be over quickly; the sooner she was out of his life the better. He looked around and found his bulldog, Gladstone, laying on the bed. He smiled and went over to the bed, sitting down and petting Gladstone.
"Cheating from the looks of it. At least you haven't fallen to drinking, you just go home and play with your dog. Before you ask, hair on your pant leg and too high for a cat."
The woman glowered at him before stomping out of the room. He leaned back in his chair and placed his hands to his face. This was more normal than you'd think, but there was only one client he even associated with outside of work... and he was attracted to him.
“Do sit down and eat before it gets cold. Mrs. Hudson worked hard on that for you, by my request of course. How was Lestrade?” Sherlock asked, placing his violin and bow down before joining him at the table.
That's the other thing. He was now Sherlock's partner not just at home, but in crimes as well. As a psychologist and a doctor, he could help the genius mind of his companion with the cases.
John paid for his bag of crisps before he exited the store and saw Sherlock leaning against the wall, smoking.
The woman quickly pulled up his file and looked it over before looking up at him, "Please, take a seat. He'll be with you in a moment."
“Leverage?” He whispered, his voice giving away his impure thoughts at the moment as he panted with need, staring up through his lashes at the taller man in his lap.
“Okay, I probably should go. I have work, but I am here if you need to talk.” Greg offered before leaving quickly.
John's face was resting on his desk by the time ten o'clock came around. The client prior to Sherlock was one of the more taxing ones he had to listen to. Another violent conspiracy theorist was after Sherlock and he really wasn't looking forward to having two in one day. At least it was a short day because of that; finishing at two in the afternoon rather than five when he had non-violent cases.
Sherlock pulled away, glanced at the computer, then back. “We have a half hour. That's more than enough time from my calculations and experiments.”
Sherlock was mid-experiment when he was informed that someone was there to see him. He muttered under his breath, “Tell them to go away.”
He panted into the kiss in excitement as his hand closed around the throbbing erection of the teen. He pulled back and stared at the long, angled face, the fierce eyes and the white teeth pressing into the full bottom lip in desire as he slowly pumped the others shaft.
John couldn’t believe he had married her- or even loved her for that matter. The doorbell rang and he went to the door and opened it, “Greg! This is a surprise.”
“None of your business, brother.” Sherlock stated, before entering his room and closing the door with a click.
“Finger nail marks in the wood, torn fabric on the arm rests. These weren't there last week and you can smell the wood so the fingernail marks are quite fresh.”
"Please, call me Sherlock." The brunette said with a mysterious smile before he glided out the door and left the building.
Sherlock gave him a look of annoyance and he stood up walking up to his desk and leaning heavily on it, his face mere inches from John's.
John gaped at his phone, but felt a thrill shoot through him. Sherlock was unpredictable. He was graceful, sexy and rough. He was falling hard.
John glanced to the side, "Sherlock- I mean, he asked me to dinner so.. I took him there? Uh... He's a patient I just happened to bump into? Uh.."
“My brother put me here as punishment. I wonder what his face would look like if he knew exactly how I deal with my therapist.” Sherlock replied, a mischievous smile playing on his lips as he chuckled to himself.
John went back to his desk and sat down with a long sigh before picking up Mr. Holmes, no, Sherlock's file and putting it away. He leaned back in his chair and pulled out his next client's file. He groaned as it was a notorious attention-seeker and complainer. He would give anything to have Sherlock the whole day, even when he was being a jerk, anything was better than most of his clients.
"Thank you for saving me from the confines of boredom and my arch-nemesis named my brother." Sherlock muttered, his lips wrapping around the cigarette once again.
“I.. Need to take care of you.” Sherlock murmured, sitting up on the desk and looking at the smaller mans erection.
Pants filled the room; clothing was strewn across the floor along with papers, files, keyboard and desktop monitor. Everything was on the floor. The desk was occupied by the two men in heated passion. Sherlock lay flat on his back on the desk; his feet resting against the edge as he carefully moved his hips rhythmically. His silk shirt was opened and caught on his shoulders as he held the man above him steady. John let out a wanton gasp as their hips met once again, his blue shirt hanging off one shoulder, his hair mussed and face flushed over the exertion and excitement of possibly being caught by his receptionist or next client. He suddenly lunged himself forward, his hips snapping to get the others length further into him as his hands tangled themselves in the curly hair and the two kissed each other, mouths opened and gasping for air until Sherlock gave out a low groan as he came, filling John’s inside with his release. John lay atop him, his erection throbbing between them as he moved to get off the other, whom gasped due to his penis being overly sensitive now.
With a sniff and a shrug, he quickly squared his shoulders and entered the nearest corner store. He made his way up to the counter and muttered, “B&H Silver, please.”
“You will find that one person. Maybe you already did and don’t even know it.” Both men smiled, John ate the meal. He couldn’t help but think of Sherlock. He didn’t know what it was about Sherlock he liked.
The blonde sighed, running a hand through his hair, as he looked in bewilderment at the other, "Yes."
"I know." Came the deep mutter as he shouldered past the short therapist and sat down in a chair, swinging one leg over the other and took on the form of someone sulking.
Mycroft looked up through his lashes, startled by an unknown feeling welling in his gut as he hesitantly shook the others hand, “Mycroft.”
“Yeah, it is one of my favorite places.” John said just before giving the cabbie the address, John couldn’t help but smile.
Sherlock tapped his fingers idly on his desk boredom settling over his sharp mind. He groaned, trying not to just throw his homework on the floor and going off to stimulate his mind. If he got into further trouble at school who knows what his dear brother would punish him with.
He shoved his half complete homework off his desk and pulled out beakers, test tubes, flasks and chemicals. His mind roared to life, a satisfied smile sliding over his lips as he began an experiment of certain poisons and acids happily.
“Brilliant.” John murmured, smiling in the teens direction as he started eating his chips, muttering about their lack of ketchup momentarily.
Inside Sherlock went to pay for the bill while John got his coat; he took a deep breath, his mind wandering to his dream. John shrugged the thought away as Sherlock came back, “Let’s go.”
John stared at the text from an unknown number. SH? He contemplated the initials, ignoring the woman who was still rambling and it hit him. Sherlock Holmes.
John went to refuse but the tall teen had already pushed him into the armchair his clients used and sunk to his knees on the carpet. The blonde's head shot back as he cried out over the hot heat enveloping his engorged member. It didn't take long, a few sloppy licks and a pull and he came, folded in half and his hands tangled painfully in the others unruly curls. Sherlock swallowed and stood up, glancing at the door with a look of alarm.
“He loves him, you know? I had to listen to details I don't even want to think of when he got too drunk. I had to take him home before coming here, so this meal.. Thanks.”
John sighed as he sunk into the sofa. He pulled out the remote and turned on the telly, staring blankly at the drama currently playing. His mind began to wander to his.. Boyfriend? Is that what they were now? Boyfriends? Or were they friends with benefits? But he was still Sherlock's therapist. He hummed and contemplated a bit, but soon pushed that subject away. He thought of the faint blush on the flawless, pale cheekbones, the way his hair curled so unruly but attractively. He glanced to the side, biting his lip. This was bad. He had it really bad. Then he heard his phone buzz.
He pocketed his phone again and pretended to write stuff down as he felt her eyes slide to him and then to his hands.
He was woken late in the evening by his cell phone ringing and he checked the number calling. He ignored it; eventually he turned it off. He eventually got up and dressed. He turned his phone back on and once again it rang, he checked it and answered the call.
He was pressing the thin white wrists into deep crimson velvet. His eyes travelled down the muscular arms to a rather built chest for a teen. He looked up and stared into glittering eyes, half-lidded in lust. He kissed those full, tantalizing lips. He ravished them, claimed them as his own. They parted in a moan and his tongue entered and lazily lapped at the others tongue, which shyly replied.
“I just came to inform you that your one o'clock is here. Is there an issue that your previous client is still here?” She asked, looking between the two. She obviously noticed their mussed hair and flushed complexions but decided to be silent over it and looked at her boss.
“Indeed it was, Dr. Watson.” Sherlock replied as he made his way to the door. He sent him a wink before leaving entirely.
John stared at him with his mouth open as the other stalked off, not even bothering to see if the other would continue to follow or not.
Sherlock had become a consulting detective and worked with Lestrade on most cases, and on those cases Sherlock had to live with his phone ringing non-stop due to his brother wanting to 'check up' on him and then request Lestrade so he could make sure Sherlock wasn't being a bother.
“I do believe that is none of your business. Why are you bothering me? It's his choice, not yours. Get out of my house.” Sherlock growled, pushing the man out of his room.
John went and sat down in his chair. He turned the telly on and channel it was on was airing a crime show. He didn’t feel like going out to get food. The blonde eventually grabbed his wallet and cell phone, along with his keys. He stepped out of the flat and locked the door; he started walking towards the corner store. He'd get something to snack on and just go get take out later like he always did.
“Is he always like that?” Lestrade asked, looking at the chubby redhead whom was glaring at the closed door with a look of dismay before muttering, “Unfortunately.”
The office fell into a comfortable silence as John finished up his lunch. He had offered his food to the teen, but the other shook his head negatively. Once everything was eaten and the rubbish tossed in the bin, he leaned back in his chair and regarded the brunette sitting across from him with a brow cocked as he awaited the other to begin.
The brunette huffed, "Would love to, but brother dearest stationed his dogs at the door to make sure I don't leave."
“Alright.” He hung up the phone and glanced at the clock; he had a few minutes before he'd have to get him.
He should have been cold, what with only wearing thin trousers and a thin dress shirt, but his anger heated his body to the point of being unaffected.
John sat up, panting for breath. He ran a hand over his face and quickly lifted the sheet. Oh god, his dick was hard, aching and purple. He placed a hand on it, moaning lightly at the pleasure it brought. He got up and went to the bathroom to relieve himself, and while struggling to maintain an accurate aim, he contemplated the dream.
Sherlock gave him a droll stare, snorted, and took a long drag before he blew the smoke in the blondes face. He cocked a brow, smirked, and kicked off the wall, making his way down the road. John looked down the street in the direction of his house but decided against it and hurried after the tall teen.
It was glorious for Sherlock to behold now, outside of the event, watching from the future, even though he had been scared at the time. His attention was pulled back as his now lover continued.
happened, we are here, we are together and there is no point thinking about the what-ifs, understand? Life is full of them, every single decision we make is a what if, so who cares? I love you, we're here, together and our relationship is being mocked by London's finest."
A single tear ran down Johns weathered face, his smile blindingly bright. He couldn't handle the distance between them any longer, so he tugged Sherlock up off the chair, pressed himself fully along his lean body, clutched at his curls and snogged him stupid. Sherlock gasped quickly and then whimpered, attacking John's mouth with all the pent up passion he felt for him, all the love that had been behind those desperate words. Meaningless mutterings weren't his forte anyway, words could be manipulated, could be misinterpreted and he would much rather express himself with the language of gestures. He could finally, finally show off his doctor to everyone, show everyone who ever doubted him that he could manage to win the love of this man. He now knew that no one could put John Watson off him. He clutched at him tightly, hands fluttering about all over his body like the beatings of hummingbirds wings. However, John quickly turned the kiss into a slow, intimate exploration, calming him with stroking hands that glided and ran liquid gold up and down his spine. The kiss slowed even further, so slow that they ended up just sharing breaths and little kitten licks, their eyes now open as they ran their swollen mouths along the others in a imitation of an Eskimo kiss, lips spread into grins.
Greg didn't think that Holmes could surprise him anymore, not after five years of knowing him. As always, he thought wrong. Once he had recovered, he grimaced and began his search, methodically sweeping the place with his eyes first and then running his hands over every surface he came across. Whilst he did that, he heard Sherlock order Sally around using thinly veiled insults as usual. The fact that Sally did not argue back just showed how far her state of shock had gone.
a conductor.” Finishing with a wry smirk, Sherlock rolled his eyes as he shrugged off the cloying seriousness that had encapsulated the room.
” Sherlock spoke quietly, barely able to be heard by the audio bugs. John instantly dropped his hand and stared in shock. “
John then turned his head away to look properly at Lestrade, although not after giving Sherlock a sneaky peck on the bottom of his jaw, where he could reach properly. He knew Sherlock always thought this was endearing, even though he had never mentioned it. His expression was enough. The detective gave a small pleased 'hmm' and stopped fidgeting as John continued to stroke the back of his neck, hand sifting through the curls comfortingly.
Back in Lestrades office, John rested his head against his hand in perfect symmetry to footage-John, who had, after looking around the flat as if he was seeing it for the first time, sat weakly on the couch, knees buckling with exhaustion.
Sally stared at Sherlock and gave a confused look. She noticed that Sherlock, the freak, was blushing and…undressing John with his eyes. He was spacing out, and Sally wouldn’t be surprised if he had started drooling right there and then. His eyes were gleaming like he was planning something, and she really didn’t want to know. She would probably find out soon enough anyway, she thought, her expression sour. How the fuck had any of them not noticed during eight months? they were detectives for christ sake!
Sherlock was slightly baffled by the arrangement in recording: he would have thought that Moriarty would want Sherlock himself to be centre-stage, would have wanted to rub in the fact that he had not noticed what was staring him in the face, but no. Either he had multiple cameras placed in web filled nooks and crannies to get every panoramic shot possible, or simply realised that Sherlock spent the majority of his time either in the kitchen doing experiments or sulking on the couch, and therefore a direct visual was seen as pointless in his enemy's dead pit-like eyes.
Everyone in the office jumped, Donovan giving a small, little scream in shock at being interrupted by the sound of John's voice blaring like a fog horn into the now tense air. Even though she and Lestrade had already watched this part, it still did not ready her for the sudden change in volume that was associated with Watson's volcanic temper, her full body twitch causing her to pause the video. Sherlock grimaced, remembering with a pang the following argument and make up. He had been so afraid: terrified even, that John would walk out of his life for good, that his realisation had come just that bit too late. The worse thing was the feeling that he deserved it, deserved the pain that would follow the compact man walking out his door. He had been
"Also, it sometimes gives John some great ideas to try out." Sherlock continued, now smirking to himself like the cat that got the cream as he remembered vividly the time he deduced that Swedish fellow who had tried to blackmail the duo into helping him.
Sherlock had not grown up in a happy home. It hadn't even been a home to him, not really. The draughty halls and cold furnishings of the huge house did not allow for any kind of warm attachment.  His father had left them, and his mother had been too busy wallowing in the self pity and the misplaced sense of blame that she had lain at her children's feet to be there for them like a mother should. Mycroft had left him, gone off to boarding school at a young age to get away from it all. What he had felt during his childhood... 'Well, that's all I had known I suppose,' Sherlock ruminated. 'I had not felt the good emotions, not felt affection or any sense of friendship, nothing like John had ever shown me: love and passion, a complete feeling of belonging that warms me from the inside out.'  That was a proper home, where that burning torch lay. The place did not matter, it was the feeling.
“Mmm… nope. Not gonna work Sherlock. It’s one of my only days I get to lie in, we’re not on a case, your actually here in the bed with me for once, and I am not moving.” He furthered his point by rubbing his nose up Sherlock’s sternum, taking in a long breath, humming, and then slumping even further into him.
“It seems you have me at a disadvantage, Dr. Watson.” Sherlock purred out as he ran his hands up and down John’s muscular thighs, wrinkling and gripping at the soft tartan material. John laughed deep in the back of his throat, a sound that never failed to make Sherlock shiver.
4. This was before Sherlock had told him of his preoccupation with John: John thought it was unrequited on Sherlock's end still and felt that whatever he did was wrong or an invasion of privacy...
Here, the image split, as if looking at a shopping centre's security tapes: Sherlock's slow way up the stairs and into John's room being monitored on the left hand side, and John's silent figure on the right.
"Ha, knew it would get your attention though, am I right? Well, I don't think I would mind, considering what happened last time."
“Why- why do you always s-say his-his name like a swearword?! Oh ye-yeah, it’s because you a-are a drama queen!” Sherlock kept a straight face, secretly amused as his partner shook from his laughter, and said in his most pompous high class accent:
"Unfortunately Greg, Sally's right on the money. I can't believe I'm saying this, but maybe it would be easier to show people the videos? Not all of it, god no. Just... Snippets that we could pick out where we show true affection, put Sherlock in a better light ya know? One of the reasons we kept this a secret was so that he didn't get any bad press, and I won't stand for it now the issue has been forced."
from sleeping next to me for months, its always easier to deal with when shared with a trusted loved one. I’m just so sorry I couldn’t be there for you that night, that I prevented us from talking further.”
“It better be at least a 9.” He growled. Even though the work came first, Sherlock was sick of having to hide their relationship because of it. When they had first started, they had talked about this topic only briefly, as they were both in accord: only Mrs. Hudson would know, because they didn’t want to put each other in danger. Moriarty had already pin-pointed John as one of his only weaknesses: who knows what other criminal classes would do with the information. That was Sherlock’s worry.
He was riled up now, his movements becoming sharp as he turned to John and invaded his personal space. "How long would you have
"You're damn right I will, no 'may' about it…" the sergeant muttered darkly, surprisingly unaffected by Sherlock's little tirade: it would take a lot more to embarrass Sally Donovan, that's for sure. As she was mumbling, she couldn't help but over hear John whispering to the detective, something about not knowing he did it in his bed and that much. He was licking his lips far too frequently for Sally's liking. They hadn't gotten to anything racy yet and Watson was already showing signs of arousal. She was still unsure whether or not the tapes would do anything for the couple: maybe the mortification and shame would be too much for either of them to get it up. That's what she hoped for anyway. In this instance she would Thank Christ for being a woman. No real outward signs of attraction would show, although Sherlock would obviously be able to see if she
“But you were there John. You came downstairs, ready to shoot any damn fool that would dare mess with us, with
And that was how Sherlock had first declared his love for him, never had said the words properly aloud until just this morning. He hadn't been able to, fear had pierced him at random times, the what ifs had piled upon him. If he said the words truly out loud, for everyone to hear, he might wake up. He may wake up from this fantastic fantasy, only to be dreaming in his four poster bed back at the chilly manor, or he could suddenly awaken from a coma, induced by drugs and his own helplessness.
He can now revel in it, instead of panic like what happened at the time. He can bask in the fact that he is in love with the greatest man he has ever known, and the fact that this man
John was cut off by Sally, who in her growing amusement and also bewilderment, could no longer restrain herself from commenting.
Got it? I need everything exactly as it was if you can. He’s back and I can’t leave any room for mistakes… not like last time.” He hung up, half formed sentences dying across the network. Looking over at John, he saw his eyes glitter with determination and reigned in fear. Always the calmest man in a bad situation, Sherlock thought with pride. John had got them out of plenty of untenable positions before, due to his immense self-control and combat skills. When the sirens call of danger beckoned with skeletal phalanges, John Watson was the first to heed it.
He took hold of each of Sherlock’s hands and grabbed the kit which was still open and ready from earlier. Using sterile water pouches he wet some gauze and methodically cleaned and removed the dried blood once again. “
"Yes sir, sounds about right. I put it on your desk as soon as he hoisted it on to me- the lazy bastard-. That was at five to nine."
sorry, bit shorter chapter for you this time, its half term and i am surrounded by homework that i have not done yet!
. God, I thought Watson would be a good influence on him; maybe he would prevent him from going full psychopath. I swear it’s gotten worse, they’re as bad as each other!” Now Greg was completely side tracked, if he had to fill out another bloody 36 page long incident form out on them again he would… Groaning slightly, Lestrade fidgeted.
were the words that greeted him, written in curly cursive that squirmed and writhed as he shook out the piece of expensive looking paper.
"why does everyone question the most inane, simplest things?! Leave, don't leave, why does it matter, oh you might as well hear all of it! Get in on the old Sherlock&john show."
"Well, as we have just missed it, and Donovan has been so kind as to… crush the remote in her harpy claws, I will explain from my point of view: I came back downstairs. John was sat on the couch. I went over to pass him his medical kit and thought it prudent to ask if he was alright: obviously he wasn't, and as I am unused to asking such stupid questions and dealing with large build ups of emotion, I chose the wrong path of investigation into his psychological and physical condition. John is one of the very few who walk this earth that I cannot always predict; which is probably why I can stand his company for long periods of time."
He couldn't stand it. They thought that he was weak, that he had panicked because of them knowing about John and himself. Their stupidity would have disgusted him, but he could deduce that john was also doubting himself, that he thought that all his worst imaginings had become true and Sherlock would just shut down on him and show him the door.
“Right. Greg. I’m gonna give you one minute to explain, in a concise and fairly quick manner, what the hell is going on here. Then, we are going to discuss the matter like the adults that we are. Got that? All three of you? Yes, Sherlock, I’m bloody including you too. Right. Begin.”
The camera view changed once again. The sitting room of 221B was shown in perfect, defined clarity from the corner above the window frame, the curtains open yet allowing no light through bar the endless flickering of the nearly deceased streetlight's luminescent glow. It was putting up a good fight: The settee, John's chair and the kitchen were just visible in the darkness whereas Sherlock's chromed one-seater was stooped in shadow, black leather reflecting amber and steel emitting half-hearted white flashes every couple of seconds before the fuse abruptly snapped under the stress. The low back was facing the lens and if the owner were occupying said chair, would look down onto inky riotous curls and the tips of perfectly groomed hands in their beloved pose. He was not, however, and instead a lone figure could be seen standing in the dead zone between kitchen and sitting room. The waif like spirit seemed thunder struck, almost as if stuck between the crossing of two worlds, so close yet so far apart: body and mind warring that ever familiar, loathed battle. Pale eyes glinted dully in the glooming, and no sound crossed those monochrome lips that stuttered across un- pronounced words that even the owner did not know the meaning of.
In Lestrades office, John can feel Sherlock against the back of his shoulder and along his arm. He feels the hitch in breath, the tension in his frame. At the time of the video, john had assumed that his brilliant, ridiculously handsome flatmate had deduced something about Moriarty.
“Sir… I don’t know if I can stay and watch this. I mean, we haven’t even seen anything yet, and it’s already making me a bit… I just… it’s a bit demeaning you know? Who knew the frea- Sherlock, had feelings like that?”
The moment extends itself: warps beyond all measures of time as their breath mingles in the space between them, the particles of Sherlock bouncing and swirling against the particles of John, collision theory at its finest. We are all just particles, floating upon this ground, in this restricted space of each individual niche: every person meeting is a collision, every old acquaintance bouncing off a limping individual, every chance encounter between a detective and a doctor teaching at St. Barts creates a new chain of events, until two particles collide in a lab on a non-descript day and manage to ignite.
"John, why are you doing that, stop it, I need to get this out before it takes up too much short memory space, it's already backed up in 3 different places... No! stop giggling! This is a serious matter, John, please just quieten down and listen."
Sally had a perfectly shaped eyebrow raised at him, although she wasn't look at him in the face. She was staring at where their hands slightly touched, where Sherlock had curled a finger around John's thumb. She still wasn't sure whether this was one huge joke or not, although even she thought that she would have to be the biggest idiot in the world to not believe their love for each other. It was just... She could not merge this Sherlock with the one that resided in her head. In there, he was a cruel man who was too clever for his own good, a junkie looking for his next big fix. Whether or not that fix lead to murder, Sally was positive that some day it would have. But... Since John, that view had changed. In the last couple of months, it had been changed again, as Sally had seen the freak almost be... Happy. And wow, that was a huge concept right there. Sherlock, happy in someone else's company? Ridiculous.
Reopening his eyes Sherlock caught Lestrade and Donovan staring at him with joint expressions of shock, before Sally smirked and Lestrades eyebrow rose. He glared at them and scowled, feeling embarrassed in his moment of weakness. In fact, he had forgotten they were even there. Sherlock jerked his head up from his lover’s shoulder and burned holes into the ground with his eyes. He pulled his hand out from under John’s and retreated back into himself, walls going up completely. Now wasn’t the time to be childish.
“ OK stop right there. I have had it with this situation, and you’re bloody mumblings. Sally, that was uncalled for, apologise to Sherlock now.”
"I know you three are men, and believe to own the remote in any situation, but tough. it's mine now and I will not stop it unless necessary, got it? Just... Warn a girl if any...well. Funny business goes on between you, yeah?"
Sherlocks first reaction was to be kind of... Dissatisfied. Disappointed almost. Was that all this was? Why were they making such a big deal out of it? So what, it was an image of the two of them at 221B, sat on the sofa like any normal night. It was paused at a point with John looking earnestly at him, elbows resting lightly on his ripped-jean clad knees. His hands were under his chin, fisted to hold it up so he could look into Sherlocks eyes. He himself had an almost shy hint to his countenance, dashed with some crazed look in his eye that spoke of a storm of his once-thought-stupid feelings raging through his mind palace. His one hand was clutching the end of his shirt, worrying creases into the silk material that looked- what? Damaged? The other was grasping John's wrist, looking like he was hanging on achingly tight. Except... Wait... No. No.
John adored him. He could be so shy sometimes, yet in other circumstances could be completely in command, without any reservation at all. This had been his first chance to do some serious PDA, and couldn't wait to see all the ways he could make Sherlock look exactly like that. Hell, as soon as they were out of here John was going to grab his hand and not let go for the entire journey home. No more tension and longing thickening the atmosphere while their hands were mere centimetres apart, thank fuck for small mercies. Sally curled her lip.
John reached out to grab Sherlock's’ hand, realising as he spoke that he had so much to be thankful for. But all trauma leaves its scars. Some more visible than others. “As you’ll probably find out from good ol’ Moriarty, I didn’t exactly have the best reaction. I was so used to hiding it and pushing everything down that it didn’t even occur to me that I could come to you, confide in you. Maybe then you would have seen that it’s OK to not feel...good. It’s okay to be overwhelmed. At least you tried to give your feelings an outlet, you tried to talk to me that night and I shut you down at first, acting like I knew what was best for you just because it worked for me. As you already
Blearily opening his eyes, John mumbled sleep garbled sounds as he was dragged unceremoniously out of oblivion to the shrill echoes of the personalised ring tone ‘cops and robbers’. He lay there dazed for a moment, not able to connect the dots. God he was just so comfortable and warm, a long line of a body pressed against his. He turned around slowly, searching out that blazing warmth and snuggled into the bare chest he found, pulling up the duvet over him and his bed fellow.
The screen flickered for a while, and then a grainy image from an outside CCTV camera began to appear. It was dark: only the ambient lighting from a select few windows and cars made the scene visible, the road quiet in the earliest of mornings. The only sign of life was a young couple staggering slightly along the pavement who shortly disappeared, tripping round the corner and appearing to laugh drunkenly at each other.
"Hey it's just an idea, something to think about. Yet I still don't understand... How could Moriarty get it so wrong? As you said, he's meant to be a genius, and even if he truly is sociopathic, it really doesn't need spelling out..."
His fingers scrambled to get under the raised surface, picking at the tiny, double sided adhesive strip that he could feel. It gave just as his nail began to splinter and he cursed slightly under his breath. He stood up on creaky legs that had seen better days: not getting any younger, he moaned at himself.
Sally just rolled her eyes and stayed silent as she pressed the button: Another day in the life of Holmes, it seemed.
Sherlock felt like an even bigger imbecile than before. He had already admitted to himself that John was still a bit of a blind spot in his deductions, especially those related to emotions, but he had never thought John would believe he was capable of just swiping away his lovers feelings like an annoying gnat. He was becoming a bit fed up, actually, and more embarrassed by the minute. John was not that stupid or blind, surely, unless Sherlock had been completely wrong and John did not want their relationship to become public news. No, no he knew John, he would never use him like that, like a toy that could be thrown away at anytime. No that was stupid, stupid, stupid. No harm in collecting evidence though, was there.
"Sally! Don't interrupt; it's bad enough as it is!" Hissed Lestrade, his face a bit red as he fiddled with paper clips on his desk, trying to zone out as much as possible to give them a little privacy. Short of sticking his fingers in his ears and humming loudly, he couldn't help but overhear.
“But John, don’t you see? It must be important, your phone. Is still. Ringing. How long is that infernal song?! It’s been going for 1 minute and… 9 seconds. Why is it that anyway? Why choose
“Oh so glad we amuse you Donovan, Anderson not available at the moment? His wife’s home, though I suppose you would know after that close call last week.” John and Lestrade sighed the same weary breath as the two began arguing back and forth, and John had to force down the smile that arose when his Sherlock got petty, a defence mechanism obtained when he felt like he was being made fun of.
He snarled in John’s face, giving him such an intent look that John was rooted to the spot, unable to move as if medusa herself had glanced his way. Sherlock looked frenzied for a second, until his features softened into despair and his voice was reduced into a whisper.
John didn't want to look up. He didn't want to see the pity that would be in Donovan's and Greg's eyes. Sherlock was deathly quiet beside him and he didn't want to know what he was thinking. He didn't want to find out how pathetic Sherlock had seen him. He didn't want
"One more thing Sally, if you ever call him a freak again, if anyone at the yard dares to call my partner a psychopath", he flicked his eyes over to Greg and back again, "or insult him in any way possible while I am in hearing distance, they will live to regret it."
He grinned, trying to lighten up the situation a bit more, knowing that Sherlock was getting unbearably frustrated due to his mirth. Sherlock felt himself become calmer, although he was still a bit miffed that John might not be taking him seriously enough.
P.S if you have tumblr and want to follow me, I have a Sherlock blog here which I run with additionalpylons:
You sat me down and you muffled all the static, all the waves. You defy the laws of science John, you’re a brilliant insulator
John physically leaned away at this, he was so taken aback that he just stood and blinked for a couple of seconds, shoulders still squared where he had been anticipating a degrading speech on the futility of emotions. He twisted slightly so that he could see whether or not Lestrade and Sally had heard the same thing or that he was going mental. Nope, not mental yet, going by the look on their faces. John had really not expected this, he felt like all he knew about the detective and his privacy was being turned up on its head.
John was flickering his eyes between Lestrade and Sherlock incredulously as his partner returned his gaze to him with a completely straight face. He didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He settled on doing a bit of both, laughing breathlessly, staring at his lover with a telling wetness in his eyes as Sherlock looked on, bewilderingly ruffling a hand through his hair.
Smirking gleefully, he let go of John's waist and strode over to the items on the desk, though not before giving John a sweet, awkward kiss to the temple and smiling at him shyly, pleased as punch.
“… Ha, well if you’re so up on your high horse, freak, why don’t you wait and see the ‘evidence’ Moriarty has blessed us with? You think you’re such a genius, you’re just a hypocritical arsehole, I don’t know how john puts up with you, the sex must be amazing. Either that or he gets off on being masochistic.” Sherlock’s eyes widened and his nostrils flared slightly as he took a slight step back, coincidently so he was closer to John. John glared between Sally and Greg furiously. There was something not right going on here, Sally now looked sickened by what she said and John could see that she hadn’t meant to come across so… harshly. This was more than the petty insults the two fired at each other normally, and he was getting sick of this waiting around. Lestrade tried to step in.
Sherlock yanked his hand away, a look of disdain passing across his features as he got up to pace the room. He came to a stop, dead in front of John, hands resting either side of his head as he leaned forward.
"What, did you think you would side-track me by talking? Not gonna happen. I may be less intelligent than you but I know when someone's trying to distract me. Sit down, get comfortable and try not to die of embarrassment."
, let alone love! I think of all the things I said to you before, and it makes me... how I would so casually use you or insult you! You probably thought I had deduced it, didn't you? That I was being cruel on purpose and it makes me
“You were so sweet that night, you know?” John reminisced, a sappy smile upon his face. “You don’t know how happy that kiss made me… Oh. Well I suppose you will now what with the cameras everywhere.” Abashedly remembering how they had even gotten to this point in the first place, John looked around at the other two sat in the dingy office. He would never regret other people knowing about them, he just detested the fact that they both had to learn new, private things about each other in front of witnesses. That they would see him almost float up the stairs with how much fucking
"Right this is getting off the subject again. I guess... Yeah I'll have to, I can't use these as criminal evidence for offences against you anyway, the cameras are illegally placed so any crimes committed, unless extremely serious, cannot be held up... That's what I'll say, at any rate, if I get questioned."
, it was so… John. He had been wrong about so many things. John had already loved him; had already come to terms with it. It was not a reaction or a sudden realisation brought about by Moriarty and his schemes. He had not gone through his crisis alongside Sherlock, who for once in his life had been the one to be slow on the uptake.
John was anxious about the press, and how it would affect Sherlock’s work. He didn’t want to be the reason that someone was prejudice against his partner, or didn’t take him seriously. Hell, the yard already mocked them, even when they didn’t believe their relationship could ever happen. Sherlock was fragile when it came to emotions, John thought. He needed the protection that came from pushing people away, and the fact that he had let John into his heart spoke volumes on how much Sherlock trusted him. John would happily bear the burden of knowing the real Sherlock Holmes, due to the fact that he thought that there was no burden at all. He had no idea how Sherlock would react if everyone knew. Bloody hell, if anyone somehow saw the man behind the mask, the man who loved completely but silently, and liked to snuggle on the sofa when thinking on a case, he might shut down. Or pull away from him completely, scared about the repercussions.
see it, of course, at least not in any detail, because he was still standing some feet in front of the gates.
“Doctor?” John turned to see that Miranda had approached at him.  “Thank you for being willing to testify on Tyler’s behalf.  We appreciate it.”
Sherlock did not continue speaking. In fact, his face contorted, lips popping open and eyes widening as John looked ready to explode. Again. Before he knew what he was doing, John was on auto pilot as he grabbed Sherlock's un-injured wrist and pulled him sharply towards himself, getting right into Sherlock's face. His breathing was audible even from across the room, the multi functioning camera capturing every flicker of emotion and every sound that crossed their lips.
Sherlock, wide eyed and too flustered to put up an ounce of fight, sank bonelessly down until he was slumped in the cold, cheap plastic. He unthinkingly reached out and grasped johns hand, squeezing it slightly to caution the doctor. He let go surreptitiously and was surprised yet glad when John reached to take hold of his shoulder and left it there. Lestrade gazed at the two men in front of him, strangely proud of them. John had always known how to handle Sherlock, and Sherlock had always known when to back down with him, something he had never done or been able to understand with anyone else. In a way he was calmed by this. Seeing the brave front the both of them put up reassured him that nothing would endanger their relationship, certainly not Moriarty. They were perfect for each other, he thought, and knew that Sherlock had now become a good man, not just a great one. He gave a grim smile and readied himself for whatever would happen next. Just as he was about to start on his revised speech, Sally -of course- had to jump in and spoil things.
Well, it's been an age. I always had this fic in the back of my mind and felt so crap for never finishing it. Re-reading it now is embarrassing but I'm not going to change anything other than tidy up some typos/grammar. I've not been a part of this fandom for a long time now, and like most people I've spoke to I was disappointed with what we got in the end. My Sherlock and John deserve some kind of happy ending, so I'll get there. Here's my first chapter and first attempt at writing in about 6 years. I can't promise it will be done quickly, but it WILL be done. At some point. Continuity wise, I hope I manage to match everything up ok but if it sounds like it's written by a different person, that's because I AM now a different person! From what i understand, speech that is all italicized is from the surveillance tapes.
Grinning slyly, John winked at sherlock and turned to give Donovan a cheeky smirk. Sherlock blushed slightly and looked at John from under his lashes and messy fringe, biting his lip in a move that was clearly initiated to tease.
"You must understand John, I don't know how to convince you otherwise. I'm no good at this. You're the first person who I've ever felt remotely close to in a loving way. Yes, before you say it, there is Mrs. Hudson of course and Lestrade to an extent- don't look at me like that Greg, I know about your little 'paternal' conversations with John,"
Sherlock opened his eyes to see John turn his head towards him slightly, eyebrows lowered in concern. Oh. Sherlock had spoken his name out loud. Instead of looking back, he slowly lowered his heavy head to his partners’ shoulder, curly hair brushing his neck lovingly. He closed his eyes again, savouring John’s scent and snuffling into the dip between shoulder and neck, his favourite place to rest when in a moping mood. He felt more than heard John chuckle quietly as he placed a small kiss on Sherlock’s head, before turning back to the screen.
"Lestrade, once you've recovered your admittedly pea sized brain, check in that corner and all around your desk. We're looking for anything suspicious, anything out of place. Even if it's a bloody pen you don't recognise, I want you to inform me."
Sherlock snorted at this, and John swotted at him playfully, as Greg spluttered slightly as the conversation did a one-eighty on him. God, Sherlock just had to make this difficult, didn't he. Although, he could completely understand. He might be willing to bend the rules a little, considering the circumstances. Shit, if his superiors found out... Well, they could just watch them for themselves, couldn't they? Lestrade really couldn't see them cautioning him for a slight tweak, not unless they wanted to comb through every piece of footage several times.
A loud slap rang through out the room as John snapped his partner out of his growing hysteria, the doctor part of him coming to the forefront and giving him an unnatural calm.
"Stupid, clever show-off, you can tell he's enjoying it with all the dramatic swanning about." Sherlock muttered mostly to himself, as the tiny, fewer pixel camera showed the keyboard and the desk, case notes strewn about with tea rings stained into their pages that john had been cross referencing before he had left for Sarah's.
John threw out an elbow to give a soft dig into the lanky man's ribs, who growled slightly and said thank you under his breath.
John watched as Sherlock’s expression became gradually darker, his smirk melting off his face slowly, as whatever solvent words Greg said dissolved the character of those animated lips.
He looked over at the detective, who was sitting as close to his side as possible given that they were in two separate chairs, and studied his face. It looked like he was thinking the same as John, his mouth a pale thin line in his otherwise stoic features that were at odds with his current body language. He slowly moved to cover his hand, which was clenched around the armrests of the chair, squeezing it hesitantly in case Sherlock did not want his touch. After not gaining any kind of response, he began to move his hand back dejectedly to its original position. He was therefore startled as the man at his side quickly flipped his hand, palm up, so he could grasp John’s fingers between his own.
"I'm not that much of a soppy idiot, honest! We have eight months of frustration to make up for after all."
?” He was scrunching his nose up showing his utter disgust for John and his stupid charming ways. I mean, who personalises their ringtones now? And how did John even figure out how to bloody do it in the first place, that insufferable,
“No! No, don’t you dare Sherlock. It was an extremely stressful day for all of us, plus you had extreme emotional turmoil on top. Frankly, I’m surprised you handled it this well.”
Both times, before Lestrade had called, and before they had decided to watch the first tape, they had sat in awkward silence: the first time preceding Greg getting up and pushing the disc in the rest of the way and snatching the remote off of the side, Sally and he having an internal argument with each other through their eyes about who would be brave enough to get up and do it. The second time was due mostly to shock, and not a small hint of regret at the dirty feeling they had once they had finished watching.
The tableau that would greet anyone walking in was a grim one, although they would be used to that at the yard. The DI was sat in his chair, elbows across the cheap desk that served as the commanding post for his team. His head, graced with moonlit hair, was resting in his hand, the spikes glittering dully in the sombre light given out by the single bulb swaying mournfully from the stained ceiling tiles. Natural light was hard to come by, the blinds pulled shut as much as possible given that they were broken in several places, allowing sneaking tendrils to burn spotlights haphazardly around the room. Sally was sat opposite Lestrade, her chaired turned slightly in order to see the screen. She had slight marks between her eyes atop the bridge of her nose, where her bony fingers had massaged out her stress whilst also providing cover for her eyes if she needed it. Her other arm was snaked around her waist, hugging herself slightly for comfort and to stop herself from fidgeting due to the sexual tension that had permeated the room from the screen.
” Sherlock began pacing again, his teeth clenched along with his fists. John intercepted him as he came past, hands to shoulders and steered Sherlock to the sofa. Sherlock seemed to compute for the first time that John was still only in his pants and went along meekly as he deduced as much as he could from John’s body. His eyes were drawn to John’s chest, the scarification from bullet entry was neat, however the subsequent scars from infection spread like a web along John’s clavicle and almost down to his nipple. You could tell that Sherlock was itching to see John’s back, the exit wound. With a push he was sat in the middle of the sofa, John perching on the coffee table.
John bristled slightly but became more worried with each passing second. Neither of the two officers wanted to spit out what was happening, and the stray glances that hit throughout every part of the room except to Greg's upper left, and, incidentally, his and sherlock's eyes were speaking volumes to him. Just as he was about to man up and look at what must be the television screen, Sherlock jumped under his hand as if he'd been electrocuted.
Sherlock and John looked at each other, slightly panicked. There was an... admittedly huge list of things that could be considered illegal, not least of all John's gun. Sherlock was pretty sure Lestrade already knew about that though, so it was just... Thankfully, John stepped in at this point.
Decision made, he pulled John by the hips until Sherlock could perch on the edge of the chair he had been sat in, John standing in between his thighs. He grabbed his hands and held them tightly, so tight that John's fingers changed from golden sunshine to bone white, bleached by the strength of Sherlocks grip.
“John now is not the time for sentiment, we are on a case and I need to focus on this, so stop fawning over me and watch the video, I do not need to remind you of the seriousness of this matter, considering that it is about us, do I? No? Good, and I would appreciate, Lestrade, if you and your… colleague,” he sneered at Donovan as she looked at him indignantly. “Would pay attention also, otherwise there is no point of you even being here. Now stop inflicting your insipid thoughts on me and do whatever you are here to do.”
John could feel that his calm would desert him, as soon as Sherlock had opened his eyes from their scrunched position and he saw that brilliant brain come back on line. He had reacted instinctively, quickly, a medic on the battlefield as shells and IEDs exploded all around him. Now he had time to think, and that in his mind was a bit not good. As Sherlock had hyper ventilated in front of him, John had to see the screen. Was it Moriarty standing over the dead body of one of their few friends? Was it footage of a kidnapping?
Sherlock felt overwhelmed. He could not have dreamt this happening to him, not in all his destructive yo- yo life. He was an ex drug addict, an absolute arse hole who hadn't cared about anyone before John had turned up out of the blue. He was selfish and arrogant to an extreme level, and had only just realised that he was not the sociopath he thought he had been. John had changed him, and he may not have welcomed that fact at first but he now craved for John's approval, the change not being forced or asked for by John himself; rather, Sherlock had wanted to change for John, to be someone that John Watson deserved. And here was his partner, saying he did not deserve Sherlock of all people, whilst he stared at him like a half whit instead of getting on his knees and worshipping the man. Who cared who saw? He had waited for ages to tell John, and now was the time. Hmm... Maybe not right here, who knows what had been on this floor. No point getting his dress trousers dirty when he could wait until they got home to get on his knees. Maybe then he could use his mouth for something other than talking to please his doctor.
Their heads whipped around at the same time to stare at the innocent blackberry buzzing across the bedside table, a generic tune playing unaware. They looked back at each other in silence, faces carrying only a ghost of the previous happiness. Their minds ran through the same vein: please continue, don’t stop ringing, please.
John slid down, resting on his haunches, propped up against the wall. Hands ran agitated through his short hair, dust and small pieces of brick scattering around him, until they covered his face and pressed over his eyes. After a moment, his head banged against the wall again, his hands ending up resting on his knees as he let out an emotionless laugh.
The next words soon burst their eardrums, yet it was Sherlocks facial expression which shocked them: it looked like he was drifting into unknown heights of feeling as they watched his lips shake, his eyes glisten and his hands tighten their grip.
" but I will make time for you John, your happiness is essential to me and I fear that I have not settled your mind with details pertaining... Us and the... The sentiment that I... Um, feel, for you. I have deduced by your conduct recently that you are slightly worried about the veracity of this, and that you think that my worries are... Truthful yet pointless pertaining to the danger that criminals would exhibit if our relationship was known, as you get kidnapped on a semi-regular basis even without that knowledge. Following this incident and ones recently, I believe that you are mostly correct. Viewing that, I have come to the conclusion that we should make our partnership public ourselves and on our terms before that decision is taken away from us by the content of these tapes, as i would not be surprised if the 'consulting criminal' sold this information to the press or to slightly less...savoury places. That does not mean that I will sit back and let him, and once I have viewed the evidence I hope to follow up on all lines of investigation, no matter what it takes."
John sighed and made his way back to his desk where he sat down and shuffled through the files before starting his introductory session.
Sherlock cocked a brow in the others direction, "I'm not quite used to people praising me. I must say I like it."
They left the restaurant and were making their way down the street towards John's flat. The two were quiet, enjoying the comfortable silence between them. The light down the street turned green  and Sherlock jolted. He quickly ushered John to the side, glanced over his shoulder before he placed both hands on John's shoulders and swooped down, kissing the other man. John's eyes widened, his pulse quickened as did his breath. He went to raise his hands to brace himself on the teen when he pulled away, looking in the direction a car passed in.
“Billy,” said Sherlock, “Your enthusiasm is appreciated, but I need someone with specific skills today.”
“Did trauma surgery for two years before an accident left me with nerve damage in my dominant arm.  I retrained as a GP and practiced for another four years.”
The blond man gave up on waiting for his missing companion, threw some money on the table to cover the cost of his wine and left. He turned right on leaving the restaurant, then ducked down an alleyway.
They were face to face now.  John had to lift his chin to maintain eye contact.  The man lowered his voice, “You’ve seen it already, haven’t you?”
So Ivan started with the crow and went on from there, describing the battle, what he remembered of the aftermath, what he’d been told by others who’d cared for him in his feverish state.  He described his mother’s unexpected death and his sister-in-law’s departure.  He did, however, omit their names and titles.
As the sun rose in the sky, so did the wood piled against the house.  It was past noon when Ivan finished, and his leg and shoulder were throbbing.  Still, he felt pleased with himself as he had washed up at the well.  Marfa Hudovna brought him tea and a plate of left-over pirozhki, and he sat on the house’s shady porch to eat, listening to the murmur of the breeze in the forest trees.
“‘Mycroft’ is the name you gave me, if you could possibly struggle all the way to the end. And the last time I brought my laptop you covered it with potatoes.”
, mind you – but I can’t guarantee he’ll be able to speak or understand you. We had to adjust his medications for his, ah, past history.”
“So far we know that two of the three victims were practicing Christians, possibly Anglicans, and that both were also employed at royal residences.”
“Internal nose plugs made of soft silicone.  They’re almost invisible to the outside observer unless you know what you’re looking for.  They’re not easy to obtain, but neither is
was over-protective, at least when he wasn’t trading off the details of his brother’s life to Moriarty. Mycroft claimed to care for his brother. Perhaps the Holmeses had no other way to express caring? Perhaps...
John stared, then chuckled. “That’s not a bad idea at all, Mrs Hudson. I’ll call him later – well, probably tomorrow at this point.” He barely caught himself in a yawn.
Here Nigel drew himself up, as if trying to imitate someone taller.  Drew himself up and intoned, in a lower voice than his natural one and in a horribly poor imitation of Received Pronunciation, “Just finished your degree – medicine – enlisted in the army, reporting for duty tomorrow, hangover and all.  The only way you’d have been able to pay for your education, as all you got from your family were anger issues and a propensity for alcohol.  Oh, and homophobia.  Shame about that, given your own orientation.”
“It really had nothing to do with Molly at all, I’m afraid. He turned out to be a criminal mastermind interested in trying to get close to Sherlock.”
Manya didn’t seem to think he was taking this seriously enough.  “I warn you, Vanya Stolitsky, not for injury or nightfall, no matter what you may see or hear, do not stop.”
Ivan took a breath and tried to ignore the anger flaring in his gut.  “Your brother exiled you himself.”
“A freak?  I would.  He is – was – is.  How freakish is that, having someone else carrying your heart around for you?”
In the morning, his soiled trousers were still there, his sword was still there, his horse and the remains of last night’s campfire were still there.  So was the meadow, green and untouched except where Bezimyan had grazed.  Ivan washed himself and his trousers in the stream, waited until the cloth had more or less dried in the sun, then mounted up and went on his way, east and a bit north along the road.
“This” was a Browning HP L9A1 almost identical to the one that John had used in Afghanistan.  There’d been talk of replacing them with SIGs, but then the Revolution had come.  John had still had his Browning at the end of the war when he was shipped to Canada.  He’d turned it in, of course.  The shape and weight of the gun he held now were familiar, almost comforting.  Out of habit, he checked to see whether or not it was loaded – yes – and the safety was on – also yes.
up like that.  I was worried I’d – lose it.  With my family sitting there.  I thought maybe I should excuse myself and find the loo, but I couldn’t leave, I couldn’t stop watching.  And then the ballet ended, but the dancers came out to take bows.  He came out, he kept
Sherlock was standing exactly where he had been, but the smirk was gone. “John,” he said, “I think I should call a cab.”
With her omegologist’s assistance, Mary had used suppressants to adjust her cycles so that her heat began two days after the wedding. The week that followed was nothing short of amazing. Sure, they’d had sex before, but by unspoken agreement, they’d saved the experience of sharing a heat. John felt drunk on Mary’s sweet/tart scent, on the taste of her in his mouth and the feel of her on his skin. He slid into her warmth and she was more than ready, she was
Sherlock’s expression shifted so quickly that John blinked.  “Angelo, I’ve tasted your tiramisu.  I don’t intend to leave John here sprawled across the table in orgasmic bliss.  We have
Ivan handed it over and began to circle the room, searching for the exit they’d presumably need, for entrances to guard.  He found neither.  Sherlock, who presumably had some sort of exit in mind, was busy muttering to himself as he examined the casket.
.  I rattled off a stream of deductions to assist your memory and left.  I didn’t expect you to see you again.”
Ivan nudged Sherlock’s back and muttered, “Talk!”  He moved slightly sideways, more directly behind Sherlock, the better to hide his actions from Muircheartaigh’s view, and fumbled for the looking glass on its cord around his neck.
“Yeah. Yeah, right,” John answered. Distantly he was aware of Lestrade and Mrs Hudson talking, Lestrade leaving, Mrs Hudson offering him a cuppa.
No time to waste then.  Ivan climbed up upon the wall.  The ground was far below, and oh, by all that was holy, he did
Sherlock huffed but handed over John’s phone and went to get his own, starting to explain the case as he did so.
The concierge stared at him as if the bus itself had spoken, but she gave his name to the person who answered the phone.  “No, I won’t be put on hold.  Yes, I know I have to wait, but every time you people put me on hold, the call gets terminated.  Yes, fine, I’ll wait.”
“I don’t like to pry, dear, but I couldn’t help noticing that there was a lot of yelling and door slamming yesterday – and not for the first time in recent months.”
The man’s clothes, stored separately in a plastic bag, smelled of the alley where the body had been found. Despite the stench, Sherlock examined them closely – jacket, shirt, trousers.  The sleeves of the jacket were peppered with small cuts and the remains of the splinters Molly had mentioned.  The shirt and trousers bore various stains.
“...all the while loudly proclaiming that Mycroft was trying to force us to attend Christmas dinner at your parents’.”
They had no trouble finding a driver willing to take them out to Wapping.  Sherlock had the driver let them out a few doors down from 57 Wapping Wall.
They reached 221B and climbed the seventeen steps, but when John went to open the door, Sherlock stopped him.
John took his new phone back into the kitchen to play with while he ate his supper.  There was one number already programmed in.  It was labeled “SH.”
“Thank you.  In the morning, I’ll give you a sack of rye flour to take to a friend of mine, Marfa Hudovna Pekarnskaya, and directions on how to find her.  You should listen to what she tells you.  Now, good night, Vanya Stolitsky.”
Despite the dark and early hour, a good-sized crowd had gathered at the western gate by the time the armed troupe rode forth.  Some in the crowd carried torches.  The dancing, flickering flames were not much help in picking out the men’s faces, particularly given the chainmail coifs and helmets they all wore.  Still, there was no mistaking the tsarevich, sitting straight (if not very tall) upon a magnificent horse.  His gleaming chainmail and the jewels in the hilt of his sword caught the torchlight.  Many a maiden and not a few youths in the crowd sighed to watch him ride by.
“That’s what she was talking about in the lab,” John realized. “How is chemical information transmitted between two individuals?  Foucault and Campbell-Williams think it has to do with quantum entanglement.”

They kissed ravenously, tongues tangling, as if they hadn’t seen each other for weeks. John felt hyperaware of Sherlock’s sun-warmed autumn scent, of every inch of the bony body pressed against John’s, of the little whimpers and moans Sherlock made against John’s mouth. Sherlock’s hands seemed not to know where to settle. They roamed up and down John’s torso, touched but did not grasp his hips, reached ‘round to his arse all too briefly and then stroked up his back.
Months later, it occurred to John that Mycroft’s and Greg’s intentions had been more or less the same. Both had tried to provide whatever help they could.  It was hardly their fault that John didn’t know what to ask for.
The sixth day out, one of the streams they drank from apparently had bad water, because everyone got the flux.  It was bad enough for Ivan but worse for the others who were just beginning to recover from starvation.  The sack gave them only plain bread and apples to eat.
But the woman had forged ahead. “I know some people say it’s not right and try to make all kinds of trouble about it, but I think they should mind their own business.”
Sherlock made a face at this, why couldn't anyone other than John just accept him as he was for god sakes, was it really so hard to see him in a relationship?
"Greg, you may not want to ask us that. I know I've told you several things whilst at the pub, stories which contain, shall we say, a small amount of breaking and entering and other activities that we had to do in order to catch someone, and don't get me started on the amount of trouble he gets me into on a daily basis. You able to turn a blind eye? Mostly all of it has let you catch a criminal, so it's kinda necessary."
, who knows for how long, while he had been running around like a headless chicken, throwing insults here and there to the man.
Now Moriarty had turned up, sent his own personalised gift to Lestrade’s very own office. It had been waiting for him, after he returned from getting a shitty coffee from the Yards break room. He had sat down, not thinking much about the stack of DVDs placed upon his desk, waving them away as some evidence from his last case. After 5 minutes of trying to swallow the coffee and spinning slightly in his chair, his curiosity had finally prevailed, and he opened the envelope that he had only just noticed to the side of the innocuous stack.
at this point John cleared his throat sheepishly as Sherlock widened his eyes and made a shushing motion with his lips.
“Sally, calm it down yeah? There is nothing we can do. The only thing I’m not sure about is whether or not to call the two of ‘em here and tell them straight away, or watch the first one, just me and you, to gauge what they could be of, and stop as soon as anything… revealing could happen.”
lock, don’t degrade people just because you’re bored’ the hypocrisy is stifling John, I may not survive under the onslaught of such a travesty.” He slowly began to grin, as John broke down in a fit of high pitched giggles that made his heart melt. He stared; sobering up as he again wondered how he deserved this beautiful, walking anomaly, who accepted him whole heartedly without restraint, put up with his eccentricities and cold exterior, who
On screen, John stripped to his pants as fast as possible, leaving his clothes wherever they fell. His legs gave way so he was haphazardly sprawled face first on the bed, and the camera angle changed so a hint of his face showed. With his eyes closed, John smiled and reached up, placing his hand where Sherlock had imprinted his cupids bow. He was soon asleep, so overwrought from the day they had that even nightmares were kept at bay. The footage sped forward, hours passing with John moving slightly during slumber, shifting around until he was on his back.
Greg decisively got up and walked to the desk, settling himself into his seat as he grabbed the remote. He set them to rewind and glanced up at the three of them, taking in their hesitant expressions, and in the case of Sherlock and John, major embarrassment factored in. He grinned as he teased them.
“We just finished one! Two days ago!” He gave a playful little remonstrating nip to the pale chest, and hitched his leg further around the others hip, trapping him as Sherlock went to reach towards the still singing phone. Their faces were now level as, after a few minutes of useless squirming, Sherlock gave up unwillingly. Teach him to try and get out of an ex-soldiers’ ninja cuddle hold, John thought victoriously to himself. Sherlock pouted and cupped Johns face with his hands.
“Sally for Christ sakes they do have names you know! And yes, they’re on their way, although they have no idea what’s waiting for them. Well, unless I ‘spose Sherlock’s deduced it somehow or another, he guessed it was Moriarty almost straight away, the genius git.”
"Sherlock, I love you. I would tell everybody in the world about us if that made you happy, and I would have done at the beginning, even before we got together and stopped being idiots. But... I guess that I got it into my thick skull that you somehow felt ashamed to admit being with me. I know, I'm stupid right? I know that you love me. I know that you would do anything to keep me safe, without being constricting or clingy. well, at least most of the time. I know it in the way you play all my favourite songs on the violin, in the way that you are always there to keep the nightmares at bay. Yeah, I know you can be a right dick sometimes, and you drive me up the wall on even the best days. Especially when you steal my gu- well you know..."
“I love my wife,” said Andreyev in a low voice, “Things were not always easy between us, but truly, I love her still.”
– and the male betas he’d dated occasionally had preferred to be the recipients. But Sherlock, who’d never been with anyone except John, was fearless and avid in his exploration of John’s body, giving and taking pleasure with a fierce generosity that took John’s breath away. He wanted John in exactly the same way as John wanted him: in any way that he could have him.
The days leading up to the wedding seemed both to drag and to fly by. Sherlock continued to obsess about the wedding to the point where John had to take him and “run” him, which led to them saving a young guard’s life at Wellington Barracks. Then Sherlock returned the favour by taking John on a uniquely awful stag night, including not only the traditional over-consumption of alcohol and drunken games but also a botched crime scene, a gaol cell and a rescue by an over-amused and over-loud Lestrade.
, and that made it all the more thrilling that Sherlock was taking charge, telling John what to do, taking John’s cock in hand (long acid-scarred, violin-callused fingers wrapping around John’s thick length and John almost came at the touch) to feed the head
Angelo continued to ignore Sherlock as he told John, “I’ll get a candle for the table. It’s more romantic.”
the freak told me my ‘job’ was to ‘distract the guards’!  As if I were some floozy in a low-cut gown, good for nothing else!”
“Think, John.  What motive did he have for the killings?  None.  Someone hired him.  I needed to keep him talking to find out whom.”
“And this wanker was your soulmate.” The moment John said the words he knew they had been mistake, even as he watched Sherlock’s face start to slip behind its mask.  “Sorry.  I’m sorry, that was uncalled for.  It’s just... I’m having trouble understanding how the whole soulmate thing happened.”
Neither the driver nor the car had what one might call a professional look.  “Is this bloke a real cabbie?” John asked Sherlock.
As Ivan ate, he mulled over the question of Sherlock’s loyalties.  It would be a great deal easier to trust the creature if Ivan knew what reason he might have for going against Muircheartaigh.
He would have offered Sherlock his thigh to thrust against, but the height difference made that awkward.  He remembered himself at fifteen, though, and when they were finally forced to draw apart slightly for the sake of breathing, he reached down and gently ran his hand along Sherlock’s length.  Sherlock dropped his face against Ivan’s neck and
“Right. And I think Clara wanted someone who needed her to take care of them.  You’re nodding.  You already figured this out, right?  Co-dependent, capital C.”
Sherlock looked up from the peas he’d been pushing into patterns on his plate. “Just be glad you’re not an amarsupial. You’d have a lot longer to wait.”
“The photographer is presumably familiar with the premises,” Sherlock pointed out. “She might also need the money if she wishes to continue attending galas and other such events.”
“You need some sleep, dear. Leave those dishes and go right upstairs. I made up the bed in your old room and left the windows open to air it out a bit. I’m not your housekeeper, mind, but just this once where everything’s been in such an uproar.”
She seemed genuinely distressed. “Molly, whatever Sherlock’s got going on, it’s not your fault. No, don’t try to take that back. I’ll take it home –
John was about to protest that there was nothing wrong with his clothes until he realized something.  The dark suit that Sherlock was wearing was the first finely tailored item of clothing John had seen since landing in the UBR.
“Yeah, we went for walks. Not really going anywhere, just walking, sometimes even for more than an hour.  And then we’d stop somewhere and he’d buy me a be-”  Here Tyler cut off with a hasty glance at his mother.  Unfortunately for him, she’d already caught the gist of his statement.
In due time, a car arrived. The anonymously handsome young man in the back seat asked, “Home?”  John nodded because it was easier than specifying any other destination and was delivered to his own doorstep.  The car waited until he’d actually gone inside before pulling away.
“That’s when two particles are in different places and you do something to one of them and the other reacts, yeah?” John felt proud of himself when Sherlock raised his eyebrows.  Not
“Jabez Wilson was a bachelor and almost 70 years old.  His only surviving family is a brother in Carlisle.”
“No.  Once Mycroft provided the information, the troops had no more use for Rudy.  They shot him on the spot.  You could
