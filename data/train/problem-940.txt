again yells that this is insane. But he just… he has to
“I thought you’d sleep all day.”
Sherlock shrugs and tries to find the rhythm of their easy banter again, but it’s a struggle. John has apparently decided that the best way to get through this is to try to act normal, and Sherlock is both relieved and somewhat uncertain what that normal is, and where the line between bantering, flirting and leading John on is supposed to be.
“Of course, dear,” Mrs. Hudson says and hands him the picture.
“So, Sherlock, tell us a bit about yourself.”
“The dough was too runny, so I added some flour.”
“Well, my drunk
He dabs two fingers into the little jar with the ointment and starts rubbing it into the bruises. He feels a bit odd doing it, very aware that Sherlock is still watching him. It's difficult to reach around his torso, and he winces in pain as he twists around to get at the bruises at the back of his ribcage.
Sherlock is last, and when the judges cut his cake in half, Sherlock can hear John’s sharply drawn breath at the small rainbow-coloured hearts decorating the inside of Sherlock’s hidden design cake.
And a croissant
“We need a bigger sample size,” Sherlock mutters, noting down the data.
“You do know how girls get pregnant, right?”
He sets out his ingredients and surveys his work with a satisfied nod. He’s got much more space at home, but this will do.
John grins and shrugs while he stretches his dough out further. “Only every single Sunday of my childhood. My gran used to clear the dining room table and make strudel dough for apple strudel, and this is pretty much exactly the same. I helped her as soon as I could reach the table. She always said you need to be able to read a newspaper through it.”
“Your hands don’t shake when you bake,” Sherlock points out gently.
He pushes himself off the wall, grabs his case and goes inside. He’ll just go up to his room, maybe have a shower, get something to eat. If he runs into John, fine. If not, also fine.
Sherlock draws back and looks at John, and there’s a lovely flush on his cheekbones and along the sides of his neck that John wants to trace down his body. He swallows, and John realises that he’s nervous.
What now?
John stills, and he swallows. It's true, but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt to hear. “What... how do you know?” he asks, and he hates how small his voice sounds, how vulnerable.
That's a fantastic idea
One of the problems is that he has no idea whether all the times John saw him, punched him and then kissed him in his mind palace were extrapolations based on observed clues in John’s behaviour or simply wishful thinking on his part. He wouldn’t miss the punching, but the kissing was earth-shatteringly, life-alteringly fantastic and he wants it so much it physically hurts, a gnawing in his stomach.
A small part of him, the part that wants a job and a life and to be

“Something like that,” Sherlock says, not really paying attention to the conversation anymore, because Jim Moriarty is making his way towards his station.
“Five minutes!”
Sherlock gives him a small smile. “I promise.”
So John is really about to perform a public service, as well as making it quite plain that Sherlock is very much his, thank you very much. And it’s not that John is jealous of people Sherlock kisses on stage, that’s just silly, but he isn’t above the occasional claim-staking. Especially when handsome whippersnappers give him condescending side-eyes while hitting on his husband.
“Not really, it was mostly quiet. I even got to sleep a bit, but around three we got this car accident in. Chap wrapped himself around a lamp post. We spent an hour trying to stabilise him enough so he’d survive the lift ride up to the OR.” John rubs a hand over his face and goes to the fridge to check on the apple strudels they made together last night. Five of them, resting beneath a tablecloth, waiting for the oven. The strudel is the second-best seller of their Watson specials, right after the Punschkrapfen.
“True,” John concedes, still smiling fondly at Sherlock. “And she was a tremendous baker. Excellent biscuits, almost as good as Mrs Hudson’s.”
“At six in the morning?” John’s tone denotes his scepticism.
interesting.”
John smiles at him and gets up. “Right. Time for bed. I might even be able to sleep now.”
He looks down at John and meets John’s drowsy eyes. For a moment, they just look at each other quietly. Then John smiles and rolls on top of Sherlock. “Good morning,” he mutters against Sherlock’s lips, before leaning down for a long, deep, breathtaking kiss.
John’s smile broadens, and it does something to Sherlock, makes his stomach flutter and his heart beat faster. “No, you’re not boring. Not even a little bit.”
“Sherlock, this looks incredibly precise.” Mrs Turner points to his spreadsheet. “What are you doing right now?”
“Um… you know, the boy scout motto?” John asks, and there’s a slight embarrassed edge to his voice.
John looks up from the potatoes he’s peeling. “That sounds like a great idea. What’s stopping you?”
John grimaces sympathetically. “Banks are the worst. Hand me the butter?”
John enters without knocking and helps himself to some of the grain coffee Molly always brews first thing in the morning. By mid-day, it’s usually almost gelatinous, but if you add a little water, it’s a damn sight better than nothing.
John grins and grabs it. “And you're eating it with me. Right now.”
“I don’t care,” John says, and there’s blood-red, vicious anger in his voice, the likes of which Sherlock has only ever heard once before, when Mary died and John turned on him. “She
It’s nearing midnight when they return to Baker Street. They’ve charged Billy and the Irregulars with looking for Kitty, as they’re far better at this than Sherlock or John, so they’ve done all they can for now. John hasn’t eaten since lunchtime, and he’s ravenous despite everything. He’s raiding the cupboards when Mrs Hudson comes into the kitchen, in her nightgown. She smiles at John and makes tea unasked, and when she hugs him John lets her, laying his head on her shoulder. She smells of chamomile and the beeswax soap she makes, and she’s very likely the closest thing John will ever again have to a mother.
I’m sorry too. For the other night. I might have punched you in the face one more time than you actually deserved
Her one-room bedsit is two floors up from Violet’s. Sherlock and John make themselves comfortable on the bed while Kitty busies herself making tea. She hands a mug to each of them, then sits down in the room’s only chair and gazes into her own mug.
Sherlock snorts. “I can’t imagine what possible difference there is between cooking and baking. If anything, baking is much harder, because you need to be more precise. It’s just chemistry, both of it. A plus B equals C. Easy.”
“Today’s challenge: Doughnuts. Filled and glazed. You have two hours. On your mark, get set, bake.”
Sherlock hesitates. He knows his silence is lasting for too long to be polite.
Three days after the bombing, John’s mother puts him on a train, kisses him goodbye, and sends him off to the country. He knows she’s relieved that he’s gone, not only because he’ll be safer away from London, but also because he’s begun to notice that she’s been spending less and less time with her children and more and more time with Mr. Henry, the lodger they had to take in after his father died. His sister is long gone, she went out as a land girl the moment she had the chance. John knows that with him gone, too, his mother won’t have to pretend that the new flat won’t be one where Mr. Henry pays the rent. And it isn’t that he begrudges his mother her happiness, it’s that he feels like baggage from an old life she’d like to leave behind, with his inconvenient grief and his ever-increasing awareness of the many ways she’s let him down.
“Oh thank god,” John sighs and sits down heavily on his bed. “Any news?”
Sebastian smiles. “Well then we can both count ourselves lucky. Because I know
“What exactly are you looking for, here?” Janine finally asks, frowning at the pie. “I can’t taste anything wrong with it at all.”
The hotel’s dining room is packed when he enters. The crew sits together around a large table, the judges and hosts among them. Moriarty sits alone. The rest of the contestants are sitting around another large table, except Irene who’s nowhere to be seen. John waves him over when he sees Sherlock, but Sherlock waves him off. He’s not in the least in the mood. He grabs an inoffensive-looking sandwich and gets himself a cup of tea.
Sherlock feels his face heat and his skin tingle, as if John’s eyes on him were a physical weight, dragging over his skin. He turns off the heat under his filling and turns to John. “What do you suggest we do in the meantime?”
It’s quiet and restful and Sherlock wants to stay.
John takes another spoonful and looks thoughtfully at the colour. “Definitely raspberry. And something else. I’d say mint?”
They walk the short distance to Baker Street in silence, and John tries to start sorting out the events of the day.
The stairs, creaking under John’s feet. Sherlock has learned to read that creaking like a moodboard. Heavy steps - John is tired, long day, weight of the world on his shoulders. Determinedly hitting every step with emphasis on the loudest part - John is angry.
Rosie snuggles under the bedsheets on what has slowly become her side of the bed. She doesn’t sleep here often, but often enough that one of her pillows has found its way into Sherlock’s bed, and there are a few of her books on the bedside table he never uses.
Silence.
Sherlock hums non-committedly, then turns to the fridge for the milk. “What about Mike? Why isn’t he taking meetings with Lestrade about lighting?”
He can’t look away. And at the same time he is utterly incapable of expressing, even in the deepest recesses of his mind, why a few inches of reddened, peeling skin encapsulate everything in his life that makes it worth living.
And in counterpoint, another voice inside his head just whispers,
To his surprise, he discovered that the reasons he likes living with John have nothing to do with him doing the shopping, the vacuuming, him paying the rent and the utilities and stopping Sherlock from destroying the flat in any way that will make even Mrs. Hudson evict them. In fact it has everything to do with John, who, underneath his quietly normal façade, is intelligent, interesting, capable, strong, who he can talk to and have some outside chance of being understood, who thinks Sherlock is brilliant as well as weird, who can keep up with Sherlock in every way save intellectually (which, let’s be honest, nobody else could, either).
Irene grins. “Now me.”
Sherlock shakes his head, but John doesn’t see, he just continues, “And every time I wake up I’m not sure if it’s you or her who died, and then I remember it’s her, and I’m
Sherlock looks up at John, who’s watching him with an expression that’s half wary and half fond.
John huffs a laugh. “You sound like Mary. She’s saying the exact same thing.”
Then he goes to deal with the other Watson, and he’s very much afraid that a few pats on the back and some gentle rocking won’t be enough in this case.
“Who’s doing lights?” Sherlock asks, and it’s odd that he’s only thought about it now.
John huffs a laugh from the neighbouring station, and Mrs Turner rounds on him. “John, scone or skon?”
He knows that nobody suspects that he’s actually in love with Sherlock. They all think he’s infatuated or obsessed or dysfunctionally addicted to Sherlock, and that Sherlock regards John like one would a puppy or a trusted secretary. Cute and useful and somebody to shag, occasionally, nothing more.
And John does.
"I'll reward you for staying in bed instead, how about that?"
“Turn left” and “Straight on” are the only words spoken between them, but Sherlock feels that they’ve reached a point where words just don’t matter anymore, and they’ve said everything they wanted to say to each other.
, and then I fucking
John gets up from his perch on the stairs and steps towards Sherlock, next to him, puts his hands on the banister and looks out into the night.
“We won’t get a puff pastry challenge until the final,” Sherlock points out, tearing his gaze away from the crumbs on John’s lips. “It needs to rest for too long.”
John nods and reaches for the pot of eldritch flower ointment Sherlock brought.
“And if you’d stayed, who knows if either of us would be sitting here today,” Victor points out, still gentle, but still firm. “I wasn’t ready to get sober. You were.”
He’s in Devonshire and married to an artist. Both have affairs on the side. Sherlock becomes one of them. It ends when John refuses to leave his wife, who’s pregnant with their second child. Sherlock goes back to London alone.
And this time, Sherlock believes him. He smiles and settles back down, closing his eyes. He’s so very tired.
, deep down in his bones, that John wouldn’t have married Mary, that she would have been as transient a figure as any of his other girlfriends, that right now, at this very moment, they would both be asleep in their respective beds in 221B, and now Sherlock wishes for this alternate reality so much his entire body hurts with it.
John turns and walks down the stairs towards the front door.
They’re lounging in the armchairs before the fireplace, and it’s odd, because Sherlock has this sense of deja vu again, just seeing John sitting in the squishy red armchair Sherlock never especially liked. The fire is lit, the room is dim and cozy in a way Sherlock didn’t know it could be. John is half-dressed in a t-shirt, pants and one of Sherlock’s ancient dressing gowns. The fine hair on his bare legs catches the firelight. It’s oddly distracting.
“That looks painful,” she finally says, gesturing at his taped nose, a faint hint of satisfaction in her voice.
Sherlock’s stomach drops at the words.
“Are you winning or losing?”
John laughs again, then leaves to clean up, leaving Sally and Mary arguing about which of them knows and cares less about flowers.
Slowly, his anger recedes, as he realises that Sherlock is right. He loved every second of it right up until the moment Mrs Hudson told them they’re stuck.
“You’ve taken our criticism to heart, John, and this is both delicious and inventive. Well done.” Lestrade nods at John.
John makes a ‘Bah, humbug’ sort of gesture. “I’m not feverish, I’m just hot from lying under the blankets. It’s not like this is the first time either of us has gone into work a bit sick.”
“Yes, I did. Dr. Sholto was sceptical about trying it out, but he let the patients make the choice in the end, and we had a few that were willing. They’re all on the mend, and now he’s trying it out himself.”
Sherlock swallows against a lump of diffuse sadness that sits on his chest. “I know.”
“Let’s hope none of the judges follow suit.”
“You are helping her,” Sherlock says before he can think better of it. “You’re there for her. That is the most valuable thing you can do for her.”
Sherlock just stands there and breathes, listening to the low murmur of voices as the audience finds their seats.
Sherlock paces around the clearing, looking for god knows what, and John just sits there and feels the damp from the fog seep into his clothing.
“Once more into the breach, dear friend.”
Sherlock walks out two minutes after him, and for a second, they just look at each other. There’s an expression in Sherlock’s eyes he can’t categorise, but when their eyes meet, John feels that thing again, that cliff-edge, knife-edge, poking-a-tiger feeling.
Annoyed, Sherlock checks caller ID. It’s Mr Chatterjee, and Sherlock picks up with a sense of impending dread, because Mr Chatterjee only rings Sherlock for bad news, anything else he usually delivers by text or in person.
It takes no time at all for Sherlock’s legs to tremble and his balls to draw up, and he tugs at John’s head, but John stays right where he is, cocking an eyebrow as if to say,
is very much divorced right now, so I’d say about half and half.”
“Isn’t it Mike’s job to do this?”
Your kitchen is a sixties disaster.
“Well, that hasn’t changed,” Mary interjects.
Sherlock looks at his hands. “I was 25 years old. I’d just been offered the role of a lifetime. In New York, on Broadway. More money than I’d ever earned in my life. A role that would get me seen, would open countless doors. Everything I’d worked for since I was a child, in my reach. I could get out of my contract, no problem. Now tell me, John,” he says, turning to John and looking at him, cooly appraising and quietly angry. “Should I have turned it down? For a relationship that had lasted barely six months at that point, that I wasn’t sure would endure?”
John grins, relaxing back into the pillows. “Are you sure? This would be the perfect opportunity to get rid of a competitor, after all.”
He waits until they’re both seated in front of their pie (Mrs. Hudson’s crust is amazing) before starting his line of questioning.
And John isn’t a poor widower, and he isn’t devastated. Which isn’t to say that John didn’t and doesn’t mourn Mary, but Sherlock knows that his grief is too complex for anyone to understand who wasn’t right there with John through the whole entire mess.
There’s something uncertain in Sherlock’s voice that makes John’s heart hurt a little. Like Sherlock is utterly unused to having this word applied to himself.
"I'm an addict, John. I'm always tempted." Sherlock shrugs again. "But I'm not unusually tempted tonight, if that's what you mean."
Four weeks, six weeks at the most, then John Watson will be out of his life for good. He can indulge this, whatever it is, for six weeks.
“Don’t take this the wrong way, but you look like shit,” Sherlock says, stepping around him to get himself a cup of tea.
“Brilliant,” John whispers and Sherlock gives him a quick smile.
On Monday, they get an e-mail about the theme for next week: Tea time. Technical is Victoria Sponge, and showstopper is supposed to be a sweet and a savoury bake to the theme of afternoon tea, and either the sweet or the savoury has to be scones. This is going to be tedious in the extreme, especially the Victoria sponge.
It all starts like this: Six years ago he made a mistake. Lust isn’t love. But love isn’t lust, either. He thought he would have John, get it out of his system, and then get bored and move on, like it had always been before. But having John only made him want him more, paradoxically, and the more John gave of himself to Sherlock, the more of him Sherlock wanted. And what surprised him the most was that not only did he want to have John, he also wanted John to have him, to claim him and consume him and ruin him for other people. And John did, thoroughly. And Sherlock loved every second of it and never wanted to come up for air.
Moriarty opens his mouth, but Molly just looks at him, eyebrow cocked, daring him to say something more.
John smiles and his heart does a complicated little twist, because yes, he knows, knew from the moment Sherlock looked at him at the pool, the moment he got his first true glimpse of Sherlock Holmes’ heart. He nods. “I know.” His fingers resume massaging Sherlock’s scalp, and John leans down and whispers into Sherlock’s ear, “I also know that we’ll beat him. We’ll be stronger, braver, better than him, and we’ll beat him. I won’t let him hurt you. Not ever again.”
He nods at them one last time, then vanishes into the woods without another word.
“Well, your curiosity must remain unsatisfied,” Sherlock says and turns on his heels to go looking for a cigarette before he verbally eviscerates Irene or any of the others. He would love to, but it would make the coming weeks awkward, and John wouldn’t like it. Why it should matter what John thinks is beyond Sherlock, but somehow, it does.
Then he gets a cup of tea and waits for the crew to take a break.
he tells himself.
John smiles at Sherlock over the screen, wishing he could just curl into him and fall asleep like that. "Are you having fun in rehearsal?"
“You don’t look so good.”
“Oh, right. Thanks, John. Everybody except Sherlock, go home.”
@johnwatsonsblog
They spend two nights on that cargo train, slowly making their way to the Tibetan border.
There’s a pause, and John takes a deep breath, obviously a calming technique. Sherlock noticed he does that a lot. “Why? It’s obvious that you like me. Well, I like you too. Why don’t we just see where this is going and don’t preemptively throw something away that could be really great?”
Then he makes a souffle.
“Is he threatening us?” John asks, meaning Jim, knowing he doesn’t have to spell it out.
“I know, I know, and I’m sorry, really, if I could go back and think of something else to do I would, but I can’t, he was too clever and he knew that I love you, that I'd do anything to save you, and I knew you’d be angry with me, but I had to keep you safe, I had to, anything else was unacceptable,” Sherlock answers, and he hates himself a little for babbling, but he's desperate and he doesn't even care that much that it shows.
John valiantly tries not to blush and fails spectacularly. But he shakes off his embarrassment and asks, “What’s up?”
Are you honestly slagging off my Viennese gran’s recipe for THE Viennese classic?
John huffs and turns to the wall, wrapping his blankets about himself angrily. Bloody Sherlock Holmes and his bloody god-damned logic…
“Shit,” John curses and runs toward her. He pushes back panic as he remembers his first aid training. She’s unconscious, and he can see no bleeding. He turns her to her side and makes sure her airways are clear. Dimly, he can hear Sherlock calling an ambulance.
Sherlock picks John up from the clinic the next day, and they go talk to Billy.
John sinks back into his pillows with a relieved sigh and closes his eyes.
John grins and hands him the cheese. He eats a few bites of his sandwich, then he nudges Sherlock with his elbow. “Look at Moriarty.”
Sherlock swallows and tries not to panic as everything he’s worked for goes up in smoke. “When?” he asks, proud that his voice isn’t shaking nearly as much as the rest of him is.
The judges love the savoury macarons. “Brilliant idea, perfect execution,” Sally enthuses, and the other judges nod.
John nods, too overwhelmed to take in the implication of the story.
John holds up a hand to stop him. “Let’s just agree that we both ignored an inconvenient truth when we really shouldn’t have.”
Next, a light coffee cake with a slightly spicy bite, probably Molly’s. The lemon yogurt sponge with kiwi is probably Mary’s, and is honestly not Sherlock’s taste at all. Mike’s offering is a liquid center chocolate cake with a Sacher style chocolate icing, very heavy and far too sweet for Sherlock’s taste. The light cheesecake almost has to be Janine’s, and the hazelnut-caramel is almost certainly Neela’s.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That still needs to rest for a bit,” John says, then turns to Sherlock, letting his eyes wander appreciatively over Sherlock’s body.
“What do you think he was doing?” John whispers as they look around. There’s a bit of disarray at Moriarty’s workstation, and Sherlock looks into his fridge.
Sherlock turns and straightens to his full height, looming over Moriarty. “You listen to me,” he says, trying to make his tone as menacing as he can, “I don’t care what kind of fantasies you’ve concocted in your twisted brain about you and me. And I don’t care how much dirt you fling at me on the Internet. But if you go after John Watson, I will destroy you. Total war, scorched earth, no survivors. Are we clear?”
He starts awake and almost falls from his chair when somebody calls, “Sherlock?” from the morgue.
Today, they’re all nervous, even Sherlock. It shouldn’t matter whether he wins or loses, his social media interactions are stagnating on a high level right now. But he doesn’t want it to end. Or more precisely, he wants to stand in a room with too many people and too many lights and ovens while he watches John Watson bake just one more time. He wants one more time of bad baking banter, of awkward sexual tension and a constant reminder that he isn’t supposed to touch John anymore. In a way, he should want it to end. He should want to rip off the band-aid, not peel it off inch by excruciating inch. But once this show ends, he’ll never see John again. And even though that’s entirely his choice, Sherlock is irrationally sad about it.
look, and Sherlock adores that look.
Sherlock smirks. “My pleasure.”
“Sleep,” John whispers.
John needs a flatmate because he can’t afford to live on his own. Sherlock’s situation is exactly the reverse. None of the reasons Sherlock has a flatmate have anything to do with money, because that is one commodity Sherlock has plenty of. Of course, John, having met Mycroft and having seen the way Sherlock dresses, should be perfectly aware of this. How he has so far failed to make this deduction is something Sherlock quite frankly marvels at every time John belabours the point of Sherlock accepting remuneration for his work or getting what John calls a ‘regular’ job.
John smiles at him, embarrassed and contrite. “Sorry about that.”
John gives him a small, embarrassed smile. “Good morning.”
John helps her as much as he can, holding her instruments and passing her the things she asks for, and when they’re done, she smiles at him. “Well done.”
John laughs. “All right, then.” He drops his voice again and looks at Sherlock, all amusement gone from his face. “Later?”
“Doubt there’s sugar around anyway,” John mutters, then gets up and proceeds to make tea for both of them.
She turns to Sherlock as they walk out the door. “How about a getting to know you drink?”
Predictably, the music stops instantly.
“You want one of the coffees?” Lestrade asks quietly.
“I’m starting to hate cake,” John says, taking a swig of his wine.
“Nah, you’re not drunk at all,” John says, dragging Sherlock into the flat, where they collapse on the sofa in a graceless heap.
Outside, Molly Hooper is leaning against the wall. She’s apparently here to check on Sherlock, but John shakes his head at her. She nods and gestures for him to follow her. Now that Sherlock has pointed it out, he notices she’s a little taller than the other Fey’a he’s met.
He tries not to think of the probabilities of them holding John in a similar room. So far, he’s held out, held fast to his cover story, but if they hurt one hair on John’s head, Sherlock will gladly give them everything.
A soft whistle and a flash of an arm lead him to the opposite roof, where Billy’s camped out with a paper bag of parsnip crisps and a bottle of ale.
The judging is excessively dreary. Irene, Moriarty, Sherlock, John and Molly all delivered perfect roulades that are virtually indistinguishable from each other. Mary’s roulade is good, but it’s cracked in several places, and so are Janine’s and Neela’s. Anderson’s roulade is crumbly, tough and dry, he overbaked the sponge and there’s no saving it. Nobody is looking at Anderson during the judging, and it’s glaringly obvious that his showstopper bake tomorrow needs to be spectacular, or he will go home.
John grins at Sherlock in that heart-stopping way he has and says, “First one to reach ten?”
“Fuck. Sherlock, look at me.”
it. Physically, at least.
John huffs a laugh from the station next to Sherlock’s, and the two hosts move on to Molly.
John laughs and pretends to lock his lips with an invisible key. He turns to set up his equipment, and Sherlock lets out a long breath, wondering what he’s doing, and wondering whether he wants to know.
She stops talking as Lestrade walks in. He looks tired and rumpled, and he just nods at them and makes a beeline for the kitchen and the coffee maker.
They crawl back into bed, and Sherlock rolls on top of John, looking at him intently. “Stay for breakfast,” he says against John’s lips.
“This is a farce,” Moriarty presses out between gritted teeth. He’s standing next to Emma the contestant wrangler and he’s been complaining loudly about their side-shoot for the entire day. “How can you let them film in the tent? This isn’t fair.”
Finally, John sighs heavily into the phone. "I… I can't…"
Abashed, Sherlock gives a short nod. “Ask then.”
@thesexyguy
“Friend…” Sherlock repeats the word like it’s the oddest thing he’s ever heard. “You’re the second person to use the word today. Do you think he’s my friend?”
“So. Long story short,” Lestrade finishes, smiling broadly. “John, you’re in the final.”
This might actually be achievable, especially if his social media interactions increase.
Sherlock doesn’t answer, he’s clearly dismissed Sarah from his notice, and turns back to his microscope.
They’re lying on their small, not especially clean bed, facing each other but not touching because it’s too hot. It’s too hot to sleep, to think, to move.
“Yesterday, when we left Musgrave Hall, you were upset. Why?”
He wonders what that says about him, as he contemplates Sherlock’s sleeping face. It’s more than obvious to him that he
Sherlock hesitates. He should tell John to go. They had sex. There’s no good reason for John to stay the night.
The door chime of the pharmacy rings, and Listra leaves with a ruffle through Sherlock’s hair and an admonition to leave her mice alone. John is about to tease him about the mice some more when Molly calls from the next room.  “Sherlock!”
“Yes, fine,” John mutters, wiping mud off his jacket and… No. No, no, no, no! “My watch! My watch is gone!” Oh, no, no, no.
to bake?”
Lestrade introduces Sherlock to the rest of the cast, which consists of only three other actors, Irene, Adriana, who plays Sherlock’s character’s wife, and Sebastian Moran, who’s playing Irene’s husband. While Sherlock greets the other actors John has a few seconds to note that he’s a little broader in the shoulders and has filled in a little in the face. He’s no longer all angles and bones, but he hasn’t lost his efficient leanness and the way he moves in his well-tailored suits, all dynamic grace.
He smiles back weakly. “Thanks.”
Sherlock nods and tries not to notice that John smells good. He apparently showered not long ago, his hair is still a bit damp and slightly mussed, and he’s changed into a soft, beige jumper that’s too baggy on him and frankly an abomination altogether.
Irene smirks at Sherlock like a cat that caught a canary. “Well, gents, see you on the bus.”
“Seems we’re not in Kansas anymore,” Sherlock says, awe-struck.
“I love it when she does that,” John says, voice barely above a whisper.
“No. He broke through from the other side about a year ago. And he brought people with him. Dangerous people. With weapons. They guard the Gate.” Lya shudders. “Since then, we've been trying to apprehend him, but he never comes to the Faedorn personally anymore. He never did like doing things himself,” she adds, and there's a bitter hatred in her tone that makes John's skin crawl.
There’s a cold pit forming in Sherlock’s stomach. “Is that why you’re here? To tell me that you signed the contract?”
“What do you mean?” the doctor asks. “You can’t mean somebody tried to murder two twelve-year-old boys?”

It’s John’s blog, specifically the comment thread about the raisins, and he notices it’s quite a bit longer than it was when he stopped commenting.
“The rules are simple. Every week, our bakers will face a technical challenge, where each of them will prepare a classic recipe, and a showstopper challenge, where they can make whatever they like, as long as it fits with the week’s theme. Every week, the judges will name one Star Baker, and one baker will be sent home. The final three bakers will face each other in the great finale, where our jury will crown the Master Baker.”
“Why is this my problem?” John asks, but he’s sitting up and reaching for the fabric samples.
That’s not what happens.

anything at all. “If that were true, most of my sexual encounters wouldn’t “count” either.” He indicates the quotes with his fingers, the gesture as harshly biting as his words.
Hands shaking his shoulder, checking his pulse.
Sherlock shrugs. “It was fine.”
“So, John, this looks good.”
He stitches John up while John does his best not to throw up, judging from the colour of his face.
“I was hoping you would enlighten me,” Mycroft observes mildly. “Might I trouble you for a cup of that espresso? It smells very good.”
“These are sold during carnival, aren’t they?”
Molly comes in, carrying her ingredients and implements in a red cardboard box decorated with flowers. She gives him a nervous smile, which he returns, then goes to set up, as ever a contrast between fluttery nerves and easy competence.
Sherlock lets Mycroft’s words sink in and gives him a half smirk to acknowledge that his brother has a point. “I don’t know about you, but all this sharing and caring business makes me deeply uncomfortable,” Sherlock says, but he knows Mycroft can see that he’s at least half joking.
Sherlock smiles to himself and watches John bake. He’s good at this, a natural, really. He’s photogenic and charming and self-deprecating.
Sherlock shrugs. “The village on our side is abandoned. The stone circle near the village is a gateway to this world. There were drag marks on the path into the forest. Obvious.”
I’m exhausted
Billy hesitates. “What’d he die of, then?” he asks, gesturing at the watch.
In a way, it’s a relief. Ever since that bloody telegram his mother and Harry tried so hard to keep calm and carry on, as they say. Now, at least, in a burning city and with everything they own crumbled to ashes, they have to acknowledge that the world is ending.
She sighs, and he can see the anger seep out of her, slowly, leaving an exhaustion behind he’s deeply familiar with. “I don’t know. How did you forgive Sherlock?”
Now he’s working steadily, and he even gives Sherlock an occasional small smile when he catches his eye, but he’s far from his usual cheery self.
It’s spring and the weather is perfect.
“What’s the story with Mike?” Sherlock asks as soon as they’ve ordered, not necessarily because he needs to be told - obvious, really, divorce, alcoholism, rather pedestrian - but because it will establish the tone for the evening. Professional small-talk and reminiscing about old friends is all right, anything personal is not.
John swallows audibly, and his voice sounds rough and uneven when he asks, “Do you really think we were a mistake?”
Sherlock looks up from the kitchen table, where he’s lazily leafing through John’s gran’s recipe book, waiting for inspiration to strike. “It requires a great amount of precision, not something you excel in when it comes to baking.”
“Maybe I’m being too hard on her,” John muses, his voice quiet and contemplative.
Sherlock smiles and closes his eyes. “I want chips drenched in so much vinegar they make my tongue burn with every bite.”
What if John doesn’t like it? What if he isn’t any good at it? He hasn’t had much practice, after all. What if he likes it and John doesn’t? What if John likes it and he doesn’t? What if neither of them likes it? What if they both do and he loses even more of his head to John, what if Moriarty comes back and sees John written all over Sherlock’s body and wraps him in Semtex again? What if John just wants to experiment and what if Sherlock doesn’t and what if John then decides he doesn’t want this after all and Sherlock does? What if John wants something Sherlock can’t give him? He’s a heartless bastard after all, isn’t he? Caring isn’t an advantage. He already cares too much about John.
Rewind.
“Men don’t… do… that… with other men,” John stutters. “How… I mean, how would that even work? And…. just… it’s wrong.”
“Mummy was hurt. A bad person hurt her, and she died,” Sherlock explains, or tries to, as gently as possible. Normally he hates talking down to Rosie or giving her anything but the unvarnished truth, but ‘Your mother was an assassin and got murdered by the woman who double crossed her’ isn’t something he can say to a three-year-old.
Perversely, of course, that means Sherlock absolutely will. “It’s no trouble. I actually wanted to leave myself. Need to finish an experiment.”
It’s two incident reports filed by Magistrate Lestrade, both three years ago. One about two children coming through a gate that was supposedly closed, one about a fire and an explosion in the Forest where said gate was supposedly destroyed.
Sherlock looks him once over and obviously swallows down what he wanted to say and settles for a gentle, “No. I’ll be fine. Get some sleep.”
like you want me to stay. So why push me away?” John asks, sharp and angry.
The oven dings, and Sherlock gets up and brings the souffles to the table.
“Hogwash,” Donovan says and crosses her arms over her chest. “Obvious suicide. No sign of struggle. The footprints could be days old as far as we know.”
“How do you feel about tomorrow?”
Sherlock is done with the pies just as Mr Chatterjee arrives.
John holds up a placating hand. “We’ll go with you,” he says, also speaking Feyara, though he knows his pronunciation is horrible.
He slides the book over to Harry, who’s expression goes from slightly surly to almost awed as she takes the book, and suddenly Sherlock remembers that this is her grandmother’s book, too. Harry leafs through the book and seems to forget that anything else exists.
Silence falls, and they both listen to the ticking egg timer counting down the seconds.
Mary holds out a hand to help him up. “Why are you apologising for being human, you clod? Do you think there’s a person in this crew who would blame you for needing a break?” She grips his shoulders. “We need you. We need you healthy, well-rested, and happy. Understood?”
“See? I told you. Nothing to fret about.”
“Asked whether we saw who blew up the gate.”
Finally, John turns his head to look at Sherlock. “Well, that’s certainly a Dear Diary moment. Sherlock Holmes apologized. I’m stunned.” The words are harsh, but John is smiling ever so slightly, and Sherlock knows he’s forgiven, even though he also knows that he doesn’t entirely deserve to be.
On a somewhat related note, there’s actually a word in German that describes the process of glazing a bake with apricot jam, it’s ‘aprikotieren’, which translates to ‘to apricot’, so if you ever want to use a fruit name as a verb, you now know how to do it.
“Was Mike even in today?”
Chemistry normally calms him down, the pure and simple science of action and reaction, it’s predictable the way the theatre never quite is. Which is why he loves the theatre, because it’s impossible to give the exact same performance twice. Every show is different. Every audience is different. The actors, the crew, they’re different every night. One night, a joke lands perfectly, the audience laughs early, oh, it’s a comedy, we’re allowed to laugh. The next night, the joke doesn’t land, the audience doesn’t laugh, and the entire evening is different, because of that one joke.
“Well, they’re supposed to be, but you get them all year ‘round nowadays.”
Sherlock restrains himself from asking whether that means John will come, instead he goes back to sieving his jam.
“You never asked,” Sherlock points out, gently, quietly, looking up at John, and there’s so much emotion in his eyes it takes John’s breath away. It reminds him painfully of how Sherlock used to look at him back in the day, and the moment stretches, and they just sit there, gazing at each other, neither wanting to look away. John’s heartbeat picks up noticeably, and he thinks of just leaning over and kissing Sherlock…
John takes out his phone again. “Consulting Baker. Pretentious wanker, more likely.”
“You’re all too young to remember the good old upside down jelly cakes,” Mike reminisces with a far-away smile on his face. “My mum made one with tinned peach halves and pineapple, and it was objectively disgusting, but I make that cake every year for my oldest’s birthday, she won’t have anything else.”
"You're excellent godfather material, and you know it, so don't go fishing for compliments, John," Sherlock answers, voice sleep-roughened and deep even through the tinny laptop speakers.
The thing is, Sherlock realises now that taking this part may have been a mistake. Because every time he looks at John, he feels like there’s a hollowed-out place behind his breastbone, and it aches like a scar during a storm. Something that used to be there is making its absence felt, pressing against his ribs and his lungs.
Sherlock frowns at the sofa, and John shakes his head. “Not here, at…”
John snorts, but doesn’t answer immediately. “I’m not completely sure myself,” he finally says, and his tone is thoughtful and quiet. “I think it was because my leg was trapped under a boulder when we were ambushed, and it fell asleep, and when they removed the boulder, my leg hurt worse than my shoulder for a bit, and when I was in the hospital I was so out of it with fever that I thought they’d had to amputate it, so I guess that’s why.”
Sherlock looks away from the screen and John can see his hesitation. “I… I’m not…” Frustrated, Sherlock runs a hand through his hair. He looks directly at John, eyes finding his through the screen. “I'm not worried about us. I know you’ll be there when I get home.”
“No, he’s still nominally in charge.”
“I just want some goddamned fucking rain for once,” he whispers. “Just some good old English fog. The kind that sneaks into your clothes and makes you feel like you’re getting wet from the inside out.”
“My condolences,” John says automatically, even though somehow the young man's sadness doesn't seem to go very deeply.
John, it will be spectacular.
John snorts. “Yes, well, that’s abundantly clear to me. But what he said wasn’t actually so bad, he just said that he might have to get used to me after all.”
Sherlock shrugs. “I was just walking by. Now you.”
“I want to get the Christmas pudding out of the way, it needs to steam for four hours, so I’m making it now.”
He thinks part of it must, because John looks at him with so much feeling, then carefully puts his gun away before marching towards Sherlock, grabbing his lapels, and drawing him down to kiss him. There’s nothing tentative about the way John kisses, it’s angry, passionate, possessive hunger through and through, and it burns right through Sherlock’s defenses and his fear, and Sherlock grabs at John and kisses him back, pulls him in, closer, closer, closer.
Finally, John opens his eyes and looks down at him, hair mussed and pupils blown wide, and when he rocks his hips for the first time, both of them gasp. John leans down and kisses Sherlock, open-mouthed and sloppy. “You can move,” he whispers against Sherlock’s lips. “God, fuck, Sherlock, move.”

He walks and walks, letting his feet carry him through the streets he knows so well, streets he walked so many times. When he got out of rehab the second time, he used to play this game, to keep his thoughts occupied. He’d ride the tube to a random station, never letting himself look, and then he’d figure out where he was and take a way home that would take him by randomly selected checkpoints. One night, he’d challenge himself to walk by at least ten Tescos on his way home. Another night, Indian restaurants. Chippies, tobacconists, Marks+Spencers, McDonald’s. Pubs with a shamrock in their logo. Anything to focus his brain on something other than where to get his next hit.
“This is bloody frustrating,” John says as he assembles his third hidden design cake. His first and second were solid, but not good enough for competition.
Sherlock swallows and meets John’s eyes, and when John smiles at him, it would have been physically impossible for Sherlock not to smile back.
Sherlock runs a hand through his hair and all but snarls in frustration. “None of your bloody business, get
“You know very well why I won’t give you the money,” Mycroft says, carefully letting the last drop of tea drip off his spoon before setting it down on the saucer. He reaches for another one of the miniscule, bite-sized scones - still warm - and dips it in the strawberry jam - homemade. “This is excellent, by the way.”
John sits down on his own bed and tries to think of something to say. “Sherlock?” he asks softly, into the dark. Maybe Sherlock is asleep after all.
The crew all laugh and groan, because they've all had similar discussions with accounting.
A pause, then John replies.
He wouldn’t blame John if he didn’t come back.
Sherlock looks at it critically. The bottom is a bit thick, and John seems to have glazed the top with something or other, but it looks utterly unimpressive. Sherlock dismisses the tasting from his notice and starts cleaning up.
“Do you think you’ll get the money together?” Mr Chatterjee asks.
that?”
Sherlock’s hands still, but he leaves his palms pressed to John’s shoulders, fingers digging into the soft material of his dressing gown, warmed by John’s skin. “How did you finally convince yourself that your leg was fine?”
John huffs a laugh into the kiss, then murmurs, “Come back to bed.”
John nods. “It’s worth it.”
“So, Jim, what do you think?”
John leaves and promptly returns, and Sherlock is embarrassed how relieved he is when John switches on the bedside lamp and helps him drink the water, when he sits down on the edge of Sherlock’s bed once the glass is empty. “How do you feel?” John asks, and by the way he scrutinises Sherlock, he seems to know the answer.
It’s three in the morning, and he’s at Harry’s place. Harry is, not to put too fine a point to it, plastered.
So he takes his cake and makes excuses for John and Harry, earning a lot of knowing looks from the other bakers, and then he goes home and doesn’t sleep.
He hasn’t really slept in 48 hours. If this continues for much longer, he knows he’ll crack.
“I’ll get us some breakfast,” John says, gently, calmly. “God knows I could use some coffee right now.”
Slowly, the other actors come in. Adriana gets her usual hot water with lemon for her vocal cords, Seb’s glaring at everybody, dissatisfied with the way the production is going. Irene, on time for once.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say. John has obviously showered and changed, he’s wearing a well-fitting t-shirt and a cardigan that’s an affront to the human eye, and Sherlock wants to peel it off John right this very second.
Still, he can’t suppress a smile, and he knows his amusement shows in his voice. “So what is this, then?” he asks, even though he can probably guess.
“All in all it’s been a far more rewarding experience than I ever thought it would be. I thought I didn’t have anything left to learn when it comes to baking, but it turns out I was wrong. It was tedious and stressful at times, but I… I loved it.”
For a moment, Sherlock looks sheepish. “Sorry.” Then he waves it away. “That was yesterday. I’m fine now.”
John doesn’t disturb him, just sets up the rehearsal room and makes coffee and tea. He gets himself a cup of tea and drinks it slowly, letting the warmth saturate him, eyes closed.
Mary looks at him fondly. “Sure. But don’t let this opportunity go to waste, John. How many second chances do you think you’re going to get?”
Sherlock knows this almost as soon as they arrive.
It occurs to him that for his own sanity, and for John’s sake, to enable them both to move on, he should say yes. Then John would get married in peace and Sherlock would not wonder anymore what John was doing, would just know that door was closed.
“I’m never bored.”
“I did.” John looks at him steadily and there’s a world of subtext in these two words that Sherlock doesn’t need translated.
“We all love him, John, but he’s not doing his job,” Molly says.
It’s 7:02 pm and Sherlock is standing on the pavement in front of his house and is smoking his second cigarette in a row. He isn’t nervous, because it would be stupid to be nervous and Sherlock is never stupid, therefore he isn’t nervous. He does, however, experience a certain amount of restlessness, but that’s just because he hates waiting, and he dislikes uncertainty.
Start again.
Going on nine, now. Soon, it will be ten. Nearly a third of his life. But somehow, the years he’s known John outweigh the years he hasn’t. Maybe it’s because the weight of his heart has changed the density of his body, somehow. He certainly feels more solid these days.
John laughs quietly. "I haven't bought a single thing yet. Except yours."
It was a done deal before he even realised he was in danger. The lethal wound was inflicted on his self-image of the lonely sociopath possibly at the same time as the bullet pierced Jefferson Hope.
When he’s done, Lestrade looks thoughtful. “You don't know who rigged the explosives?”
He takes a step towards her. “Molly, out with it.”
And he can’t, he
She goes over to Sherlock, and since they’re not two feet away from the kitchen door, John can hear them talking, even though they’re trying to be quiet.
John grins. “That’s the stupidest question I’ve ever heard.”
When the car finally stops in front of John’s block of flats, he visibly hesitates.
She nods at a second figure, and Lestrade steps out into the light as well, walking up to the killer, already pulling out the handcuffs. “You’re under arrest for the murders of Violet Jones and Kitty Winters.” He turns to Sherlock and John. “And you two idiots are coming along as well.”
He wonders what it says about him that he feels more at home down here than up there.
He watches the cab drive away, wishing he could have gone with them, wishing there was something he could do to spare John this, but he knows that he can’t.
No answer.
“They have six hours, at the end of which all five dishes have to be done. So timing is everything.”
They spend the first hour in silence. The rain is loud, and the radio is on, but they don’t talk, and it’s oddly comfortable.
“I’m exchanging my fridge with this one,” Sherlock says, figuring that he might as well be honest, since it’s pretty obvious what he’s doing anyway.
Sherlock has never in his life hated press night more than he does right now.
“And cut,” the director calls from his monitor. “Good job, guys.”
They walk for what feels like hours, but John has lost his sense of time and direction. Once or twice, he hears Sherlock groan. He asks to stop to look after him, but the Fey’a keep walking.
John’s eyes snap open and his gaze locks on Sherlock’s. “You like that?” he asks, voice husky with arousal, as he strokes his cock in a leisurely, all-the-time-in-the-world way.
Reluctantly, John concedes the point and gets to his feet. This time it’s him reaching out and grabbing Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock’s surprised for a moment, then closes his fingers around John’s.
“John.”
“Wait!” John cries, taking a step towards her. “Please, just for a moment.”
“And you, Sherlock? Soufflé, a bold choice.”
John twines his fingers in Sherlock’s hair. “All right,” he says, smiling, wide and happy. “I will.”
The light in the basement lab is on, so he goes down to see what Sherlock's still doing here.
John.
“Oh my god. What is this, raspberry?”
@thescienceofbaking
John nods, resting his face in his hands. “Yeah,” he says. “I know.” He looks over at Sherlock for the first time since he sat down next to him. For a moment, he looks like he’s about to say something, but then he just nods once more. “All right. Enough self-pity. I need to get some actual sleep in my actual bed.”
“Thank you,” Sherlock replies with an equally fake grin. “It will be.”
Sherlock feels John’s eyes on him like a physical weight, and every time he looks over, John gives him a smile, once going so far to wink  at him.
John gives him a smile that is so blindingly fond that something complicated twists in Sherlock’s stomach. He turns away to hide his answering smile and for the first time he’s actually relieved when he’s called to do a reaction interview.
He turns around and leans against the counter, looking at Sherlock with a carefully neutral expression. “Nice kitchen.”
“Are these little gingerbread croissants in the window?”
Sherlock notices him looking and stops playing. “I’m right,” he says. “I know I’m right. They’re idiots.”
ever make your way home.”
For all of the above reasons, he expected to like having a flatmate. He didn’t, however, expect to like his flatmate.
Sherlock looks up and their eyes meet, and John can't breathe properly, because Sherlock presses his entire palm against his ribs, over the largest of the bruises, ever so gently. "Does it hurt to breathe?" Sherlock asks quietly.
“Thank you, your Majesty,” Sherlock inclines his head respectfully.

“Nothing. Just. You should mention that. People love veterans, you know.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “All right. An Einstein-Rosen-Bridge connects two points in space-time, meaning essentially you can cross large distances or even dimensions instantaneously. It bends space-time.” Sherlock grabs John’s hand and puts one of his fingers on the back and one on the palm. “Imagine there’s a tunnel between the tips of my two fingers and it goes right through your hand. So I can travel through your hand, and don’t have to take the long way around. That’s an Einstein-Rosen-Bridge.”
John wakes to a bumping sound.
Sherlock grins. “It’s an Einstein-Rosen-Bridge.”
Sherlock snorts and looks at him fondly. “You look shattered. Go home.”
John puts his arm around her and squeezes. “You won’t. Don’t worry.”
“Any bets?”

Sherlock’s eyes are overly bright and he looks at John like he’s never seen him before. He’s breathing like he’s just run a race. “That…” he says, “that… was…” He swallows. “Good,” he finally forces out.
Molly blushes a bit and beams. “Thank you, you’re all too kind.”
They had sex. The sex was good. No need to dwell on it. An itch was scratched. Nothing more, nothing less.
John tries to imagine Kitty happy and alive, but his mind always flashes back to her lying dead on the cold warehouse floor, red hair pooled around her too pale face.
Emma the contestant wrangler is standing next to the camera, which is placed in his studio kitchen. The crew arrived far too early in the morning and they’ve already done a shot of him walking down the street, and one entering Speedy’s, and now they’re sitting here and he has to endure inane questions. John told him they did something rather similar with him on Monday, only they didn’t come to his flat for the simple reason that they wouldn’t all fit into his kitchen.
“What if something happens?”
John looks at him with an amused smirk. “You really want to put out your cigarette right now but won’t because that would mean I’m right, don’t you?”
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say to that, so he leans down and kisses John, soft and sweet, and after a moment’s hesitation, John kisses back.
“It’s cold,” John pants, winding his fingers into Sherlock’s hair and tugging him down for a mind-melting kiss.
“Molly, your final words before we go into the judging?”
“Combining two classic desserts into one like this is genius,” Moran says, licking his spoon. “I love the caramel crunch in the souffle.”
Thank you to my wonderful beta BookGirlWithLove for her hard work and her patience. And to hotshoeagain who beta-read some of the chapters.
At the door of Baker Street School, Sherlock hesitates. “You go on up,” he says, “I’ll go see Billy, and then I’m going by the Watch to give a statement.”
“Mild inconvenience?” Sherlock suggests; he knows he needs to be the responsible one right now, because in this mood, John would probably go for full-on sabotage, and Sherlock doesn’t want either of them thrown out of the competition. Moriarty just isn’t worth it, even though he is a comprehensive git with his smugness, his chef whites and his condescending side-eyes.
The sky is just beginning to lighten when Sherlock gets up.
John sighs. “Give me the address. And then you’ll be an honest citizen for once and go get the Watch. I’ll tell you what to say to Lestrade.”
He can feel Sherlock shrug against him. “My little sister died when she was five. It almost broke my parents. Especially my mother. Since then my father always told us not to care about anyone but family. You can't help caring for family. But anyone else...” Sherlock swallows audibly. “Caring makes you weak. Caring
Sherlock thinks,
John’s smile slips off his face, and suddenly he looks defensive and a bit angry. “Did they say anything to you?”
“He can’t, but I can,” a voice comes from the darkness, one John never thought he’d be this glad to ever hear.
“The technical challenge: The humble Profiterole. A delicate pastry with a cream filling and a rich chocolate sauce.”
Once he’s out of the warehouse, he sags against the outer wall of the building, loss of adrenaline making his legs tremble.
“I was looking forward to this,” Moran says, rubbing his hands. “I’m very curious whether you can live up to your reputation, Mr Holmes.”
Molly nods vaguely, still staring at the set. “I was sick in the tent, too. Every single time.” She looks at John, almost accusingly. “How are you so calm?”
Janine is watching him from the kitchen table, cup of tea in front of her, occasionally glancing at her phone. “What are you doing, exactly?”
“God, I’ve missed this place,” Sherlock says. “I hate New York. I’ve wanted to come back to London pretty much since the second I left.”
“No, it will interfere with your taste buds.”
Sherlock doesn't say, and then it occurs to him that he's probably the only person currently in John's life who knows how to bake his birthday cake. And whatever else might be going on between them, John deserves a birthday cake. "I'll be there," Sherlock finally says even though he's sure it's a bad idea. "I'm making the cake."
“So I’ve creamed the butter and the sugar with the vanilla,” John says into the camera, holding the bowl up. “Now I’m adding the chocolate, and obviously I’ve let this cool a bit, otherwise the butter and the sugar will melt into the chocolate, and we don’t want that. At least not now. So. Next step, eggs. Five eggs, and if you’re thinking, gosh, that’s a lot of eggs, well, yes, it is.”
“I’m sorry,” John mutters, his voice full of compassion. “I didn’t know that.”
“Okay,” John says, yawning hugely. “Sounds good. Now go to sleep.”
Sherlock’s eyes darken, and his voice drops to a husky growl. “As you wish.”
“Watson is fine, I checked on her 20 minutes ago.”
She smiles and nods back at him. “Greg. ‘till next time.”
“Really?”
Sherlock smiles back. “Please do.”
John is surprised. Sherlock is stunned. Moriarty is furious and trying to hide it. The others are happily clapping John on the back, congratulating him.
Sherlock shrugs. “Maybe. Chemistry, maybe. Or physics. Mathematics. Maybe all three. And I always dreamed of being able to travel. Paris, Rome, New York, Egypt, you know, a grand tour.”
“I was surprised you’re still here,” Sherlock says out of absolutely nowhere, and he snaps his mouth shut and curses his badly developed brain to mouth filter.
John hasn’t mentioned Baker Street once. Or London. Or any of their friends and family. John takes all of this in stride, their nomadic existence, the total lack of privacy, the fact that all their worldly possessions fit into a small duffle bag that gets fully exchanged for an entirely new set of clothing, phones, laptops, names, identities once every few weeks.
Never being nagged to eat, to sleep, to clean up after himself, to be
Sherlock looks down at his shoes and wonders what that feeling is, that warmth in the pit of his stomach, the odd fluttery feeling. Nicotine on an empty stomach, that must be it.
John’s eyes slip closed as he strokes himself. “Look at me,” Sherlock says, barely recognising his own voice. “John, look at me.”
Sherlock clears his throat. “No, it’s... fine,” he says, vaguely embarrassed. “I should...” he points at the bathroom.
“Back here,” John calls and Sarah wanders between the autopsy table and comes into Sherlock’s little laboratory.
John licks his lips. Sherlock’s eyes follow the movement, then snap back to John’s. “”You know,” John mutters, leaning closer to Sherlock. “We’ve got thirty-five minutes more of this.”
“I have a bad feeling about this,” he says, more loudly than necessary, the almost-humming nearly deafening by now.
“And I’m looking forward to winning the mini Bake Off,” Irene adds with a grin.
The boys are welcomed by a motherly matron who introduces herself as Mrs. Higgins, the housekeeper. An elderly gentleman waits for them in the grand entrance hall. John tries hard not to stare, but it’s by far the grandest place he’s ever seen.
Irene shifts, and leans closer. Sherlock can smell a whiff of her face cream, her shampoo, subtle but there. The moonlight softens her sharp edges, makes her even more beautiful. “Come with me,” she says, softly, almost inaudibly.
Sherlock gives her a small smile. “The sheer glamour of this job is blinding.”
Sherlock suppresses the urge to scratch. The green glitter paint he’s covered in itches infernally, and he’s cold in his tiny shorts.
The Fey’a in charge gives Sherlock a grin. “Because I said so, and I’m the one holding the crossbow.”
It’s a testament to how tired he is that he feels only a little surge of warmth at being alone with Sherlock, a week of the oddly intimate atmosphere of a cast and crew working together for long hours has already acclimated him to Sherlock’s presence. He’s become familiar again, the way he moves, his voice.
Go to sleep, John. -SH
“I thought Mary was pretty funny,” Sherlock finally says, and he discovers to his surprise that it feels good to talk about her, and not resent her.
Sherlock’s chocolate sauce gets high praise, and his profiteroles are the fluffiest, and the ones with the most perfect hollow inside. Irene, John and Molly all delivered perfect batches as well. Neela’s are doughy, and Janine’s collapsed in the oven. Moriarty takes the win for the best overall combination of taste, texture and sauce. He’s incredibly smug about it, grinning at Sherlock in an infuriatingly superior way, but John grabs his sleeve and says, “Come on, I’m hungry, let’s go have dinner.”
Sherlock would very much like to check the time on his phone, but both his arm and his phone are trapped by a sleeping John Watson, who is currently using Sherlock as a pillow.
They’ve been away from home for 498 days.
No milk.
Moriarty’s family’s favourite seems to be a complicated-looking multilayered cheesecake, and he’s doing tiny individual cakes again. Irene is making something with lots of strawberries and homemade jam.
There’s little ceremony about who’s out, it’s too clear. Black Forest Gateau is out, and nobody’s surprised, she even looks a bit relieved.
“Thinks he’s better than the rest of us, he does,” another boy called Anderson inserts. “Posh wanker. Don’t even know what he does here, his parents supposedly own half of Sussex. No idea why he isn’t at home.”
“First of all, I refuse to be bound by anything Jim Moriarty did or did not do with this character, as clearly he’s an idiot who has no idea what he’s doing.” He can hear Moran’s sharp intake of breath, but goes on as if he hadn’t noticed. “Playing him as an unrelenting arsehole is boring, which is as we all know the cardinal sin of theatre. Second, I respect the hard work you’ve all put into the play so far, but we have five days before we move to the stage, and that should be more than enough to make adjustments, given that this is pretty much an hour and thirty minutes of people sitting on sofas and being varying degrees of rude to each other.”
“We can’t all have quaint Austrian grandmothers who bake unpronounceable pastries,” Sherlock says dryly.
"Please," Sherlock snorts. "Your book is so perfect a ten year old could call the show."
“Mary was hurt. St. Bart’s, come immediately,” he says, and hangs up.
he thinks,but as they lie pressed together in the dark, and John falls asleep on him, warm breath, warm body, warm skin every inch of John held closely against his body, he sees the future unspool in front of his eyes like a yarn that got away from him.
Kitty laughs heartily as if Sherlock said something hilarious, and steers him away. “Okay, I get the message, you’re done.”
"You mean you're sponging off my superior intellect to get a leg up over the competition," Sherlock says, eyebrows raised in challenge.
Mary sips her tea and grimaces a bit at the taste, but she doesn’t say anything.
John smiles at her. "Thanks."
“Yes, I see how that must have been annoying for a stubborn genius like you.” John is wearing that teasing grin again, the one that makes Sherlock want to taste it.
John starts violently and turns around to see a Fey’a boy floating down from a tree, gossamer wings gently carrying her to the ground. The boy laughs when he leans against a tree to catch his breath. “Do not worry, if I wanted to hurt you, I wouldn't have waited for you to wake up.”
John smiles. “He's not being subtle about it right now, to be honest.”
Mince pies, Christmas puddings and biscuits are in the oven when Glen calls lunch break.
“You were with the Royal Army Medical Corps in Afghanistan, weren’t you?”
You’re making something disturbingly pink.
Molly walks to the door, then turns around halfway there to look at John. "He doesn't show it, but he feels things deeply, you know."
Sherlock looks down at his tea, avoiding looking at John so he doesn't have to see the hurt on his face that’s so clearly in his voice. “I do trust you, “ he says quietly. “More than anyone. I trust you to keep me from making bad decisions. I knew you would have talked me out of it, and I needed to know, I needed to see.” He pauses, then adds, “At least I took a gun this time.”
“Insanely good.”
Slowly, slowly, learning to trust again. Learning to let it show again, how much, how deeply, how irretrievably they belong together. Slowly getting back to solid ground again, re-learning to bicker, to fight without the fear of breaking, to say every thought out loud with the certainty of being understood.
“Sherlock?”
“Poison,” Lya answers, and the anger in her voice is hard to miss. “We searched Faedorn far and wide, but we found neither the book nor their killer.”
The phone chirps again.
“What do you want me to say?” Sherlock asks, equally challenging. “I’m not sure what you want to hear.”
Sherlock smiles at him softly. “Obviously, I love you too.”
“Was Sherlock here earlier?” John asks between bites.
“Yes. I almost forgot how much fun baking can be.”
John shrugs. “He says he’s fine, but he’d say that if his arm was falling off, so who knows.”
Sherlock wishes the Earth would swallow him whole. It does no such thing.
Sherlock, Molly and John are sitting around a table in the cateríng tent, each of them silently sipping tea. Molly is tapping her foot. John looks cool as a cucumber, but he’s rubbing his hand over his thigh repeatedly, and Sherlock recognises it as the tell it is. He’s trying not to fidget himself, but he’s not entirely successful.
Sherlock takes a few full breaths and finally, finally lets go of pretending he isn’t in love with John. It’s oddly freeing.
John’s eyes flick to him briefly, and Sherlock immediately looks away, busying himself with cleaning up his workspace. John turns his head a little and rakes his eyes slowly over Sherlock’s frame in a way that leaves Sherlock in no doubt what he’s thinking about. Then he turns back to his custard and stirs, and Sherlock feels weak in the knees and slightly hot, and he definitely knows it has little to do with the actual room temperature.
This isn’t how it’s supposed to go.
Mary gives an almost imperceptible nod. “I’ll take the sofa. You can have the bed.”
So there’s still a smidgeon of hope. If he can get the capital. “Don’t sign the contract before talking to me first.”

He hears Irene whisper to Adriana, “We get to exchange Jim Moriarty for this? I must’ve been a very good girl lately.” She smirks. “It’s been far too long since I’ve had a good production fling.”
“Early next year, they haven’t set a date yet.They want to sign the contract by the first of January, though.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “John. I’m a genius with a photographic memory. Do you honestly think I can’t find my way back?”
“I was going to ask you that, John Watson,” Lya says sharply. “Why were you entering the Faedorn once again?”
John snorts. “Thanks for the encouragement.”
Sherlock isn’t here, so John considers his options.
“Sherlock!” John admonishes, shocked but not surprised. Sherlock's done this twice before.
He just needs to get through this day. Concentrate on the bake, win, go home, and put some distance between himself and this rather embarrassing encounter.
There’s a shocked silence that would almost be funny if it wasn’t for the expression on John’s face, all indignant horror. “Nobody killed my puppy, my parents just store-bought my cake,” Sherlock snaps.
Five years. Has it really been five years?
But the smile he gives Sherlock is brittle. “Well. I’ll just.” He gestures at the door.
Molly squeezes his arm affectionately. “You’ll figure it out.”
John nods absently and they finish their sandwiches and their coffee in comfortable silence.
And then, at the end of the night, Sherlock is finally forced to notice that they’re not alone. That the woman John was with stayed through all of it, and seems not to be perturbed by it. That she’s quiet and calm and interesting the way John is quiet and calm and interesting.
Cool, callused fingers grab his wrist and stop him. He turns again and meets John’s eyes, and suddenly he can’t breathe, and John is in his space and his hands are in John’s hair and they’re kissing as if the world would end if they didn’t, and Sherlock isn’t sure that it wouldn’t.
“I know you’re awake, your breathing patterns have changed.”
Emma rolls her eyes. “Don’t worry, he’s all bark and no bite. He won’t say anything, it won’t be a good look for him either if he goes after you.”
Then Sherlock looks down at his notes again and clears his throat. “How is it up there?”
“You the chaps who came in with Mary Morstan?” A bored-looking nurse asks.
This feels a bit personal. Also, for the record, I do weigh and measure.
Sherlock looks after where Moriarty just left. “I hope so.”
“I don't know, I could do worse. At least they can all bake.”
“Really?” Irene takes out her phone and pulls up Sherlock’s resume on his agency's website. “So you can play the violin at concert level and speak any foreign language given two weeks’ notice?”
When Billy leaves, Sherlock mutters something about having to check something and rushes off, clearly upset.
"But I'm fine," John insists.
“Now, Sherlock, what’s your inspiration?” Donovan asks, and he can tell that she’s sceptical about his bake. “This seems very simple for you.”
“It looks really lovely too, the latticework looks very intricate and very pretty,” Lestrade adds.
“There’s flour on your nose,” Sherlock says apropos of nothing, a spectacular example of his brain to mouth filter malfunctioning.
Jim smiles, an insinuating, oily sort of smile that makes John grind his teeth. “Call me Jim, my dear.” He steps closer to Sherlock, and Sherlock holds his ground, watching Moriarty carefully, apparently unafraid, but John knows him well enough to see the coiled tension in his lanky frame. “Glad you could make it. You brought me something?”
Finally, Sherlock lifts his gaze, clearly exhausted, half-starved, nauseated and irritated beyond belief. “I didn’t answer you before because it should be bloody buggering obvious where I was, to use some of your more colourful vernacular.”
“That was...good.” Sherlock hates himself a bit for the slight tremor in his voice.
Each of the judges has a plate with three small flat turnovers.
“Paracetamol?” Sherlock asks.
Never at rest. Never trusting her. Never relying on her. Never looking at her and feeling safe, or understood, or
John finally draws back. “You idiot, you absolute berk, never do this to me again, you’re never leaving me behind again, you hear me, never ever, is that clear? Where you go I go, is that clear?”
The problem is, of course, that he thought six years would have cleared the odd fixation with having John Watson’s undivided attention out of his system, but apparently, that’s not true, because here he is, two hours in, and he’s already having a hard time concentrating on anything else. But he needs to put this behind him. John can do it, he can look at Sherlock and be completely calm, be the perfect DSM who never gets nervous, never gets flustered, never says he’s tired or hungry or needs a break, and if he can be in the same room with Sherlock and not feel anything, then Sherlock can do it too.
Sherlock bats his hands away, grips his face with both hands and presses their mouths together.
Sherlock shakes off John’s grip, clearly irritated. “That won’t happen. I’ll get us home.”
There are twelve stairs to their door. It’s a ridiculous number, twelve. Twelve. The sound alone. Twelve. Twelve. Twelve. He tries saying the word a few times. It still sounds ridiculous.
Everything is hot. Everything is glowing, brightly. Nothing is in focus; the entire world has hidden between a gauzy tapestry of translucent silk.
He makes his way slowly up to their room with two mugs of tea and some sandwiches.
Also, his poppyseed-apple pastry is inspired by
Sherlock snorts. “You have plenty of other clients. Mummy, for one. Father, for another.” He gropes around for an especially nasty way to imply that it’s Mycroft’s way of contributing to the family business, seeing as he’s completely without any artistic ability, but he can’t find a good turn of phrase for the old insult right now, which is a sign of just how little he wants to have this conversation. “Can we just go and have dinner with them in peace?”
anybody to do this to him. But John is different from anyone else Sherlock has ever met, so it stands to reason that he alone can do what neither drugs nor self-hypnosis nor sheer physical exhaustion are capable of doing.
He turns a smile on Sebastian that sends a chill through him down to his toes. “Mr. Moran, I was very surprised to learn of your capture.” His voice is as cool and precise as the rest of him, and he speaks with a quiet authority that tells Sebastian to be very afraid. He takes out a manila folder and flips it open on his lap. “Desertion in time of war, and that from a seasoned officer like you… I don’t think I have to explain the punishment to you. And however distinguished your service record, the fact of your capture would in and of itself not be enough to warrant my interest.”
You wrote ‘Add raisins’. How many raisins per gram cream cheese? What sort of raisins? How can you function like this?
“The island is largely uninhabited, and to find food and help, he built a small ship and came here. We took him in and for a while, he seemed content here. Then the incidents started.” Lya pauses for a moment. “First we didn’t think anything of it. Fires happen, we live in trees.” She smirks humourlessly and gestures at the walls around them. “But more dangerous than his tendencies for violence was that he was unable to let go of his home world. He spoke unceasingly about going back. He told our young ones stories about his world, radios and automobiles and aeroplanes, and some of our young ones were fascinated. So we cast him out. We took the Great Mother Crystal from the Temple of the Mother, and we used it to power the Gate. We took him to the Gate and forced him to go through. And we thought that was it. But some of our young ones were inflamed by his ideas and wanted to see what he'd only described. So two of his most fervent admirers stole the Mother Crystal and re-opened the Gate to let him come back. They also took the book. We found them dead in the Faedorn. The book and the crystal were gone.” Lya’s voice breaks, and Sherlock and John exchange a worried look.
It’s warm in the car, and dark, and quiet. John’s sagged against him, asleep, trusting, warm. If he tilts his head to the right, his cheek brushes the top of John’s head, just ever so slightly. He can feel John’s surprisingly soft hair against the skin of his face, smell his shampoo. He shifts his arm a little, and John sags even further against him, rests more of his body against Sherlock’s, and Sherlock feels the warmth of him through the layers of clothes between them, feels the wool of John’s jumper pressing against the thin cotton of his shirt.
The thing is, Sherlock plays the violin constantly. At six in the morning, in the afternoon, in the middle of the night, he plays while John is trying to eat, sleep, watch telly, work, have a conversation on the phone.
He’s been sitting in this chair for what feels like days. He occasionally gets up, goes to the bathroom, gets a horrible cup of tea. Stretches his limbs. Thinks about going home. Freezes in unholy terror. Goes back in, sits back down in the chair, resumes his vigil.
Sherlock’s eyes unfocus, and John knows he’s not looking at John right now, but at something in the vastness of his mind, something only he would see. “There was something about that bank robbery. It was so neat, so precise.” His eyes focus back on John. “You do know that I would never have run.”
“Time to go to Lestrade, I think.”
John snorts. “I don’t have time for any feelings, Greg. There’s too much to do. Speaking of, there’s a room full of actors waiting for us.”
He gets up from his chair and straightens his unruly hair a little. Sherlock snorts, clearly amused, and John shoots him a
John and Sherlock exchange a grim look.
And then reality came knocking, in the form of an offer he couldn’t refuse. The chance of a lifetime, but in New York. Three months rehearsals, six month run. And he knew, absolutely, that if he took that part, he would lose John. And he took that goddamned part. And he’s been trying to convince himself since that day that it’s been worth it, and he honestly doesn’t know if he ever really thought that, or if he was just terrified of how much of his heart he’d inadvertently given away and using the part as an excuse to run away.
“Can I ask you something?” Sherlock mutters, quietly, still gently massaging John’s shoulders.
“Why do you care?” Sherlock asks. “It’s my head, it’s my shoulder, it’s my blood and my shirt. Caring, John, isn't an advantage!”
He is doing his utmost to restrain himself from snapping at anyone, but apparently he isn’t doing a very good job of it, because when the sponges are in the oven, John returns from the catering tent with a second mug for him.
They were supposed to find the local kingpin. Instead, the local kingpin found them. He kidnapped John from their bolthole and left a menacing note for Sherlock.
“No, no,
It’s appropriately foggy the next morning as they set out in the general direction of the village. John brought a map, a compass and scrounged a few slices of bread and a lump of cheese from Mrs. Higgins, who isn’t supposed to feed them between meals but does so all the time.
“I don’t care if it’s pleasant, I need to know what happened,” Sherlock snarls at Mycroft, because Mycroft is being tedious, and he’s being stupid, because Sherlock has to see it to believe it, with his own eyes, has to see John one last time and know he’s gone, and then he can make the hollow ringing in his ears and the clawing emptiness in his chest go away.
“You realise that asking me whether you can ask me something is somewhat redundant, right?” He tries for condescending. He’s not sure he succeeds.
He plays until John’s exhaustion catches up with him and he falls asleep in his chair. Then he goes into the bathroom and flushes the rest of the horribly expensive, high-quality, wonderfully good cocaine he bought only the previous afternoon down the toilet.
“Would you like to have a celebratory dinner with me there afterwards?” Sherlock says, as quickly as he can, before he can think himself out of this, his heart fully in charge for once.
That earns her knowing laughs from the other participants.
Their eyes lock, and the ludicrousness of arguing exactly how to term the parallel Otherworld they’ve stumbled into seems to hit Sherlock at the same time as John, because they both start laughing. Their hilarity has a hysterical edge to it, but John still feels loads better when they finally calm down.
As soon as they're alone and safe, Sherlock backs John against the nearest flat surface and kisses him like he wants to consume John, and he does, he does. He wants, wants, wants. Wants John’s skin and his breath in Sherlock’s body and his words against Sherlock’s skin and his cock in Sherlock’s hand.
“Why?”
Sherlock can’t sleep anywhere else than John’s room and John’s bed anymore. John’s room is everything Sherlock’s isn’t -  it’s clean and neat and orderly, it’s light and warm and it smells good, it’s white noise and emptiness. And John’s bed is soft and big and insanely comfortable.
She walks up to him, struggling into her coat. He steps towards her and helps her automatically, and she pats him on the arm affectionately. “Thank you, dear.” She smiles at him. “I’m afraid I’m not as young as I once was. It’s a bit late for me, and I’m about to head home.”
It has a spa area with a whirlpool and a sauna.
John wins. Easily. His cream cheese strudel (or topfenstrudel as he calls it) is, according to the judges, light, lemony, sweet, perfect, his filo is crispy and thin, and his custard is, according to Sally, “Good enough to drink.”
The killer grins at both of them. “Now, boys, don’t be stupid. Let’s call this a draw, all right? You walk away, I walk away. Pretend we’ve never met.”
John huffs a laugh. “So, genius. How might I have done the scones differently?”
“I think I’ll risk the catering,” John says with a grin that looks a tiny bit forced. “See you in ten mintues. If you see smoke coming out of my oven, just pretend it’s supposed to do that.”
Sherlock grabs John’s hand to stop him from leaving. “What time is it?” he asks, voice still gravelly from lack of use.
Sherlock’s legs won’t cooperate accurately. He’s trying to walk straight ahead, but something has happened to his sense of balance, coordination and his spatial perception. His legs feel vaguely gelatinous and his vision is slightly blurry.
Sherlock drinks. His hands aren’t entirely steady. His eyes are pinched, like he’s in pain, which he probably is, given he’s got a bloody god-damned concussion.
Time slows. Sherlock feels his skin crack. There’s a noticeable distortion in the air, a screeching, humming, ugly sound that seems to come from somewhere inside his head.
He nods to Mrs. Hudson gratefully and walks the short distance to Baker Street school. He would really like to wash first, but when he sees his bed, he just collapses on it and falls asleep immediately.
John’s face breaks out into the loveliest smile Sherlock has ever seen in his life. “I would absolutely love to,” he says, and the joy in his smile is fully apparent in his voice as well. “But don’t you want to wait until you’re sure you’ve got something to celebrate?” he adds, teasing.
“You’re a little too young to be an apprentice Medic, but you’re done with school in a year, and you could start then. And in the meantime, if you want, we always need people who help out at the hospital.”
For a few long minutes that feel like hours to John's over-sensitised nerves, nothing happens.
, and all at once, Sherlock realises that John is right. No matter what happens, this is already worth the risk.
“Sherlock thinks, and I agree,” John answers, trying not to sound defensive.
“Apricot jam, sugar and lemon juice,” John answers with a pleased smile. “Bit of a trick I picked up from my gran.”
John accepts a cup of coffee from Sherlock and nods at Mycroft. “Likewise, Mr Holmes.”
“Why didn’t he take over the bakery?” Sherlock asks, because this is a point he was always curious about and never asked.
Sherlock looks at him, his unusually coloured eyes locking on John’s. Something shifts in the air between them, almost tangibly, and then Sherlock clasps John’s hand, like he’s come to a decision.
He rubs at his eyes and powers down the company laptop. Then he goes through the stage door and starts setting up his stage manager corner. His book is already there, and his walkie-talkie is charging next to the monitor. He gets his water bottle, the gaffer tape, the sewing kit, the first-aid kit and the small toolbox he always keeps by his desk. Then he takes a second just to breathe. The wood-paint-dust flying into the lights stage smell always calms him down and fills him with a great sense of perspective. Everything is a moment. Moments pass. Stubbed toes, dropped props, missed opportunities. They all pass. And the lights go on, the audience leaves, and you get to do it again the next day. And the day after that. No matter what, the show goes on. Life goes on.
