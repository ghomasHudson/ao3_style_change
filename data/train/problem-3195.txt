Castiel lifts his head, his curiosity getting the better of him. All he manages to catch a glimpse of is one of the words at the top of the page;
Instead of taking the front seat like he usually does, Sam opens the back door. Castiel raises an eyebrow, but only gets a shrug in response to his confusion. Sam even gestures at the passenger seat, as if that’s enough to say that he should be the one to take it. This is made all the more obvious by how Dean opens the door for him.
, though it’s not at him. He sounds happy, and that’s the whole point of this. Dean just has to get out of his head enough to remember that.
With a laugh, Dean taps the side of his head. “That’s thinkin’ with your noggin.” He glances towards the house and takes a mental count of all the cars parked between here and there, and of how many bedrooms he knows are in the McMansion of a house. “Is
away from them and their oppressive attempts to control every aspect of their lives. It was too much and the both of them tried to escape as soon as they could, particularly because neither one of them identifies as straight and the
But it doesn’t look like Dean’s listening anymore. His eyes are unfocused as he stares at the wall. Castiel suspects that he’s mentally going over every one of his cases, just as many as he dug through himself. The Spaghettios are probably done by now and Castiel goes around the island to take the pot off the burner. It’s probably better to take over finishing their dinner, since he just dropped the equivalent of a bomb on Dean’s brain.
Honestly, Castiel could probably do any assignment and participate in any class discussion without even needing to reread the book now. But it’s just so
Kali’s eyes look to Castiel in the rearview mirror. “Or maybe it’s your ridiculous question that’s caught him off guard. Have you thought of that?”

But Cas only hums as he flattens his tongue over one of Dean’s nipples. He catches it with his teeth next, giving it a little tug to match what he’s doing with his fingers to the other. And then he switches sides to carry out the same.
they’re new. He’s certainly never seen them before. They’re both vibrating painfully hard in Dean’s hands, quite obviously on their highest settings. It’s a wonder that Dean has held them for this long without the vibrations making his hands go numb.
not to fly. You’re –” Dean stops and a thoughtful kind of light enters his eyes. “Oh. You haven’t tried to fly because you’re unregistered and don’t want to get caught. Is that it?”
more preferable to just sever the kin-connection on his own – even if it means that the echoing silence fills his head
A loud groan rumbles against the back of his neck and Dean’s hips twitch hard, rubbing his erection against Castiel’s ass for a brief moment before he gets himself under control again. It only makes him want it more. Everything he’s been waiting days for is within reach and he can hardly wait. Dean seems to be of the same mind, because it’s only a few moments before he’s kissing the back of Castiel’s neck again, his voice warm in his ear.
“Flattery will only get you an extra cupcake before we leave for the party.” Her smile grows and she winks at him as Gabriel shouts from the kitchen.
He hadn’t even known that a length of metal rope had gone missing from the colony’s storage. Probably no one knows, or even suspected it. They’ve lost track of plenty of things during their journey. But that’s really the only place Sam could have gotten it from. During the long travels that brought the fang-fin here, they’ve come across plenty of the two-tail’s floating-reefs that have long since been sunk. The colony has combed through them for anything they might find useful. For example, they’ve found the rope made of metal links and they scavenge as much of that as they can find.
He comes with a full body shiver and a muffled shout into the bedding the moment Cas shoves a hand under him to jerk him off. Cas slows down, gentles, but doesn’t stop. Dean’s going to get overly sensitive soon, but Cas keeps going. It’s just on the razor edge of
The satellite is about half his size, but round like an oversized beach ball. It has a halo of metal around it which probably functions as the antenna. There’s nowhere else for Dean to grab, so he wraps a careful hand around the halo and glances back at the ship. Sam and Cas are probably watching a blown-up image of him on the ship’s view screens. With a thumbs up in their direction, the tether from the ship goes taut and starts reeling him back in, confirming what he already knew to be true.
His heart skips a beat when Dean puts a hand on his knee to stop it from bouncing. “Calm down, Cas. This is fine. You’re acting like you’ve never been tested before.”
Dean tilts his head slightly, eyes and soul sparking with nothing short of pure delight and a deep rooted satisfaction. “So, were you all talk when you said you would devour me sweetly, or are you going to keep your word now?”
. If anything, they’re a cage. For over twenty years now, Castiel has been trapped in his house by his wings and the anxiety of being found out.
This moment right now is probably the happiest that Dean has been since his friends decided that it would be a good idea to close him up in this cave too. It even makes him
“And I saved you a slice of meat, otherwise Dean would have eaten it all and left you none.” Contrary to Dean’s belief, the vegetarian pizza was actually rather delicious; but no amount of coercion could get him to try it. Castiel is half convinced that he refused purely out of spite and not out of actual dislike for vegetables.

Thankfully, Dean returns to the bed soon enough and he upends a shoebox onto the covers. “C’mere and look at this, Cas.”
. Some small part of him misses having bedding that smells like Dean, but he sternly ignores that small part and focuses on trying to get his damn brain to turn off and let him actually
Castiel gets a good distance from the auditorium before he realizes that Anna is practically right on his tail. She has to actually slap him on the arm to get his attention as she pulls up next to him.
He gently pushes back from Dean’s chest, putting a few steps between them. Normally it’s far too easy to pretend that there’s something between them, but he can’t do that when it’s thrown back in his face like this. Dean isn’t like him. He can sleep with anyone without thinking about it. Castiel can’t do that. He needs more than that.
and annoying, and it does the trick. After one large warbling honk, Dean flails and twists upright with a loud curse.
Dean replies with a handful of silly emojis mostly consisting of kissy-faces and heart-eyes. Castiel leans his hip against the kitchenette counter and stares at those emojis for far longer than he probably should; his thumbs poised over his emoji keyboard as he debates whether or not to send some of his own back.
Met with silence, Dean licks his lips and glances around the room. He eventually lands on Castiel again, because there’s really nothing else of interest in here. “What’s up?”
Meg is wiping down the tables when Castiel walks through the door. She looks up with a smile, though it’s not nearly as genuine as Dean’s always is. “Hel – oh!” She pauses and looks Castiel over from his head to his toes, recognition clear on his face. “Back already?”
“I’m sure it was just a terrible coincidence, Sam.” Castiel tries for a smile, but it’s probably not as nice comforting as he wants it to be.
that he needs to take it, he had no other choice but to take it. So when he’s allowed out of the class half an hour earlier than usual, it’s nothing short of a delightful miracle.
The laugh he gets in response is almost insulting. Castiel pulls the phone away to frown at it again. As understanding as she is, Anna isn’t riddled with anxiety like him. She can’t really put herself in his position and get
Castiel can’t help smiling as he makes himself another cup of coffee. He forgoes any pre-breakfast snacks to avoid a lecture of his own and escapes to the living room to get comfortable on the couch and just
He hugs himself and follows Sam outside, though he stays on the step. From there, he watches Sam get into the Impala. Maybe his empathy picked up on it, but Castiel isn’t very fond of the idea of people he knows travelling on the highway during the winter. If Sam hadn’t offered to text him, he might have actually asked him to do it.
“It’s probably better that she stays in your room until she’s used to you.” Dean leans back against the door and crosses his ankles. “I’ll bring the litter box here from wherever Sammy puts it. That way, she’ll keep coming back here, and we won’t lose her in the bunker. Probably.”
Any thought of being on the defensive or being suspicious of Dean's actions are completely dropped from his mind. He steps forward to touch his elbow gently. "Dean, what's wrong?"
Before she even leaves the room, Castiel’s phone bings again. He rocks to one side to get it out of his pocket, fumbling slightly because that was
Dean presses a kiss in the center of his chest, but he says nothing more between then and when Castiel eventually falls asleep.
Where are the smiles and the soft kisses? Where is the usual praise and affection that follows sex? These hugs feel half-hearted and Castiel is dreading what they could mean. He tries his best not to let that worry show as he takes on the task of drying them both off. Dean is listless and had no objection when Castiel washed him. Now he stands just as still, eyes downcast as he’s dried off. He even holds his arms out of the way as Castiel ties the towel around his waist for him. For a moment, a shadow of a smile ghosted over his lips, but it was gone in a blink.
to him, isn’t he? Anna has more or less blatantly said so more than once, which is why she hasn’t tried to pursue anything with him again, but Castiel has always just brushed it off.
.” He presses a kiss to Dean’s temple, then his cheek. “I’m sorry – I was just trying to surprise you with this and the toys I bought from Benny, and I never thought that you would feel like – I’m
Castiel stares between the two of them. This can’t be real. Have they actually discussed any potential feelings Castiel might have for Dean? Why? Panic swells in his chest and he fists his hands against his thighs. If Gabriel and Kali can see his attraction to Dean, who else can see it too? Does
sit here and think about all the ways he could try and persuade Dean into edging, Castiel is quite done with sex right now. His libido has been satisfied and he likely won’t desire it for a while now. If Dean wants it, then of course he’ll participate, but that’s a different matter entirely. Instead, he’s perfectly happy to bundle himself up in his blanket and focus on the cuddling and lazy kisses they did to wile away the hours of the afternoon. Those were just so
That sounds like an acceptable alternative and Castiel follows at his heels. “Please remember to get one that doesn’t have meat on it. Sam and I do enjoy
“Nice to officially meet you, Cas.” Dean shakes his hand with a laugh. He leans down to prop himself up on his elbows again. “So, did you see anything interesting this time?”
Castiel shakes his head again. “No, he’s going to continue living at the apartment at Bobby’s place until he chooses to move out.” He slides a pen across the table too, realizing they’re going to need it to sign the agreement. “Sam registered to take the bar exam in
Sam smiles down at him as he drops a handful of pamphlets on the table. He takes his coat off and drapes it over the back of the chair next to him before sitting down. “How’s it going?”
“I just –” Castiel shrugs and rubs his hands over Dean’s arms. “I’m sorry, but I don’t understand the appeal of hitting someone during sex.” Hopefully this isn’t something that Dean really wants to do, although he hasn’t done it even once since they started having sex in the Spring.

blanket, he feels too cold to be comfortable. Regrettably, Castiel has to push himself up onto his hands and squint his way to separating their blankets so he can cover up properly again. Since he’s up at the moment, he also glances at the clock. To his surprise, it’s almost one o’clock in the afternoon. Unfortunately for his day, he’s
it when he leaves without saying anything. He never knows when he’s going to be coming back, or what danger he could be in and – Just, please, God let Cas still be here.
On the second day, Castiel's bag broke. It was old and one that he had been using for years at the academy. He liked it because it was big enough without being
There are a lot of little details to keep track of – taste, touch, technique. Castiel focuses on all of that instead of letting himself get lost in the

Considering how there are only three people who have keys to this apartment and would be coming into it at this late at night, and two of those people are already here, that means it can only be one person outside right now. His breath catches in his throat and Castiel bites his lip. He watches the door carefully, hoping and waiting that it really is Dean. The light of the hallway illuminates the figure that comes through the door and sucks a sharp breath in through his nose. Castiel could recognize the shape of that body even with his eyes closed.

most annoying anchor Castiel has ever had the displeasure of viewing. The anchor is just ridiculously pompous (more so than Father!)  and it reflects in his voice. Castiel can’t tolerate listening to it for any length of time if he actually has to hear it. Which means he’s now on the prowl for another station that satisfies his requirements for a news channel.
He finally chances a look over his shoulder, and sure enough Dean is already on his feet and following him. Joy spirals through the confusion and the ache inside him. Satisfied, Castiel slips into the bedroom and waits for Dean to join him.
That’s a given. Over their year together, there have been very few things that Dean has done that Castiel hasn’t liked. The list of things Castiel has liked about this last year

His drop had been more or less dealt with during the morning after. Primarily because Castiel had been woken up by a groggy Dean crawling into his bed. It had been a tight fit with the two of them on a single, but Dean’s only intentions were to kiss Castiel awake so they could have breakfast. Though it may not have been a conventional form of aftercare, he was still plenty happy with it. That was likely the best aftercare he could ask for from Dean, given that they never actually

be happier if he could pull move across the couch and lean against Dean’s side for the rest of the movie – if they ever start it again.
? Well, that is certainly new. No one has ever called him that before, and especially not Dean. He stares at the message for a minute before typing out an answer.
“Almost everyone?” Sometimes Anna calls him Cassie when she really wants to annoy him, but those moments are few and far between. He’s definitely not going to mention that.
A lump rises in his throat and Castiel swallows thickly around it, blinking back what could likely be the onset of tears. No one in his family will ever know just how much the gift of this camera means to him. Now he can slow down at the café and actually relax for the next few weeks before classes start. He was dreading starting the term exhausted from his self-imposed work load. But now he can slow down and that’s just one more gift that his family has given him.
Castiel rolls his eyes but allows Dean to pull him to his feet. He keeps the grip on his hands as he leads him down the hall and back to their bedroom. There, Dean picks through the closet and dresser, digging for – Well, Castiel doesn’t really know what. All of his good pants are
.” Dean sits forward sharply and grabs Sam’s wrist, his eyes wide and pleading. “For the love of pie, Sammy, can we
It’s only when the bathroom door clicks closed does Castiel allow himself to relax. He takes a deep breath to calm himself. If tonight doesn’t kill him, then Dean will most definitely be the end of him sooner rather than later. Castiel shakes himself out both mentally and physically while he gathers Dean’s clothes and takes them to the bedroom. He dumps those in the laundry basket and glances around the room. What are they going to need?
Someone pokes his tail and Castiel is fairly certain that it’s Gabriel, considering that he’s the next to speak.
Castiel wakes up to something hard hitting him in the face. No, not just one something, but several small somethings. He groans and opens his eyes to find a number of coins littering his pillow. Where in the world –? Another drops, bouncing off his nose. When he looks up, there’s a few other pennies and such floating above his head.
He just barely manages not to flinch when Gabriel clears his throat. “So…” After a lengthy pause and at least two side-glances, he continues. “Never knew you were one to help someone move, Cassie.”
In any case, Castiel is really looking forward to Dean having a matching schedule. It would be so nice to leave the house together and finish work at the same time. Not just because he would save on bus fare because they would drive together, but for the extra time they could spend together. If they leave early enough, they might even be able to stop somewhere and have breakfast together. Granted, that defeats the purpose of saving money on bus fare, but Castiel will take every excuse to go on dates with Dean.
to. His parents still don’t have very much money, but he’ll do what he can for them – starting with their debits, despite how his aunt didn’t want to give them a penny.
It should be said that Dean is very attentive with what he does. He starts at the base of the wing without any prompting, and even goes so far as to gather what’s in the downy feathers under the gland so not a drop goes to waste. But when it comes time for him to actually
“Sure do.” Dean rips apart the Velcro that holds the collar of the housecoat together and comes back to help ease it all around Castiel’s wings. “Clothing doesn’t always hold up so well during a hunt. Rips and tears are easy to stitch back together and saves us a ton on replacing it all.”
standing beside him. He’s looking down at Castiel with an amused and all too bright smile that has his heart leaping to his throat. When did Dean get here? What did he just ask?
“Anna, you know that’s not true.” Castiel sighs and kicks off his boots. “It’s about much more than that.” He starts up the stairs just as she comes around the corner to stand next to Sam.
Not good enough for him? Has Dean been speaking with Castiel’s father? Because that sounds like a very Father thing to say, and he has just the answer for that. “Let me be the judge of that.” He can make his own choices and he’s chosen Dean. Nothing that anyone says is going to change his mind.

and he had enough trouble with the law when he was a teenager that he doesn’t need any more now that he’s in his thirties.
Before they do anything, he needs to make sure that Dean actually does want to do this. “Is –” Oh, talking without letting his voice shake is hard. “Is that acceptable to you? I’ll understand if you don’t want to. We can –”
Oh yes. There’s that too. Castiel looks down at his hands and hates that he can feel an embarrassed blush starting to burn in his ears. He’s been caught out and he doesn’t know how to explain that he’s making a half-exception especially for Dean because he’s – he’s – well, because he’s
after that. His voice drops into a heavy whisper. “Show me or we’ll let the whole store find out just how ticklish you are.”
and he seems to be under the impression that he can use that in place of his presence in his sons’ lives. Whatever Mother sees in him is far beyond Castiel’s scope of understanding.
Dean rocks to one side, briefly pressing his shoulder against Cas’s, to get his phone from his back pocket. He unlocks it and loads up the app. “I play. What’s your handle? I’ll challenge you.”
“My –” Castiel turns around sharply and takes the few steps to the window. Sam and Jess are standing on the opposite side of the street and they’re both waving – Jess using two arms to do it. Out of courtesy, Castiel waves back. “What are you doing here?”
There were many reasons that Dean married Cas, and this just happens to be one of them. He wobbles forward into another hug. “You’re the

?” Castiel narrows his eyes and leans away, unsure if the bubble of betrayal forming in his chest is warranted or not.
Speak of the devil and he shall appear! Dean steps out of his office with his tie half undone and askew, and his suspenders hanging from his hips. He has his suit jacket and bag slung over his shoulder and he looks about exactly as Lisa feels – like he’s about to go home, take his weight in tequila shots, and sleep for a thousand years. They share a tired smile and walk to the parking lot side by side.
of his brothers are going to be going to this meeting and that is beyond unacceptable. Castiel lifts his chin, knowing that he’ll be seen as defiant for this.
“Nope!” He gives his head a good shake and straightens up from filling the bottom shelf of their fridge with as many cases of beer as will fit. “Don’t think about that, Winchester. It’ll just make you crazy.”
This is insane. This is wonderful and insane and happiness is just spiralling through him to the point that he feels like his skin might rupture so it can escape. Castiel rolls them so Dean is sitting up and he curls against his chest, snuggling against it and hiding his face from that teasing, happy smile. The adipose fins lining his tail ripple with his delight, giving away just how much this pleases him to hear.
The heated line of his cock disappears and Castiel’s whines softly at the loss, only to throw his head back on a gasp as it’s replaced by Dean’s fingers. They push to the core of him, brushing against his hole and sending off sparks of heat. He pushes back against the feeling, groaning his approval right through his orgasm as he shudders his way into it.
Castiel doesn’t know what to say. All he can do is nod. Dean does the same before he disappears down the hall and out of sight, the sound of the bathroom door closing shortly after. Once he’s gone, Castiel stops fighting his blush and sinks down on the couch to hide his face in his hands. His cheeks are burning and he hopes that will stop before Dean returns.
The damn cave is full of stone pillars and smooth spires hanging from the ceiling or rising from the floor. It makes the space feel smaller than it is. That’s not really helping how Dean’s feeling right now. He’s not the biggest fan of small spaces to start with and he’d been using his curiosity to keep that feeling from getting the better of him in the tunnels. But that combined with the silence in his head and his anger at the three other fang-fin in the cave is more than enough to make his vision blur.
“I’m not gay, maman.” He sighs and shakes his head, if only because this isn’t something that he really wants to go into detail about right now. “I’m – I just like
The inside of the card just has two signatures. There aren’t even any personal notes in it. Castiel frowns and glances at Dean. “Why are they saps?”
Dean sighs and shakes his head. “Never mind.” He takes a backwards step towards the living room and jerks his thumb over his shoulder. “If you’re interested, Sammy and I just queued up
“Not nearly close enough for you to feel bad about this.” Cas slides his hands down Dean’s body, circling around until he can cup him through the front of his pants. “Now, I believe you mentioned something about wanting to suck me off?”
The call ends and, a moment later, the password comes in. Castiel types it into the appropriate field and logs into Anna’s account. The interface is foreign to him, but thankfully the search bar is where most tend to be. His palms are sweating slightly and he wipes them on the towel he’s wearing around his waist; having come straight from his bath to here.
His thoughts are still immersed in Dean when a call comes across the colony, pushing past the loose barriers he had in place around his mind. It’s one of the guards placed between the bright-fin and fang-fin trench.
Charlie is equally comfortable next to him, with her own snacks because they’ve long since learned never to share their snacks. It just leads to arguments, silly slap fights, and a black eye (but that only happened the one time when Dean tripped trying to avoid having an XL Orange Crush dumped over his head).
That could be just about anything and he sincerely doubts that Dean will be able to guess what it is. And he fully trusts that Benny would never give the secret away. Dean could beg him as much as he wants, but Benny is like stone. He won’t give in and even though Castiel doesn’t know him very well, he at least knows
With the mask blocking his vision, his body feels hyper aware of everything. The feel of the sheets, the overwhelming smell of sex and Dean in the room, the barely perceptible flow of air through the room. Castiel can feel all of it, smell all of it, and practically
when their hands touch. Cas doesn’t seem to react beyond smiling a little brighter as they shake hands.
Gabriel groans and rubs his hands over his face. “I was elbow deep in tarts for some catering gig Crowley snapped up. I barely knew what time it was, let alone who was working the damn cash register.” He sighs and crosses his arms. “I was trying to spare you from that prick.”
And that whole memory feels sour now because Dean hasn’t shared it with Cas yet. Cas was all super excited to learn so much about him, about everything outside of this trench area, and now he’s not going to be able to tell Cas anything. Which means that he’s probably never going to get to see Cas smile again, or feel him get that excited little thrill that he tries to hide every time they talk about something
Dean stops them at the base of the stairs and catches his face between his hands. “Cas. Hey, I need you to just stop and breathe for me, okay?”
Hurt pulses hard behind Dean’s ribs and he actually drops the last of his crab. Who has Sam been talking with? Why hasn’t anyone been talking to him? Sam only really likes spending time with Jess and their friends. He has very few that Dean isn’t friends with too. There isn’t a really big pool of fin-kin in the colony who are willing to talk to them after how their family line has basically been the
movie they’re on right now, he does manage to quote along with the movie here and there. Dean does the same, particularly with some of the more iconic quotes. It’s rather fun and probably about the only thing keeping Castiel awake right now. He’s so very happy that they decided to stay home tonight instead of going out to any one of the number of parties that Dean was invited to.
Just knowing what he knows about his boss, Mr. Adler, he knows that it’s going to be an exorbitant party with fancy food in tiny portions. Everyone is probably going to show up in fancy clothes that have no business being on a ranch. Depending on the type of music, they could spook the animals if it gets too loud and God help them if the milking cows get agitated. Dean will
As much as he hates leaving him there, Castiel goes back inside on his own. He’s learned by now that Dean prefers being alone when he’s angry.
about? Is this conversation uncomfortable for him? Why? Castiel had just assumed that this situation would have been ignored completely and they would never have mentioned it again. That seems to be the Winchester’s take on everything.
Oh sweet Mother-sea. Dean doesn’t even want to think about telling him how hard it’s been to stick to that. It’s not that Dean
With any luck, her lunch date (once she makes it) might end with plans for a dinner date. That would be nice, and Lisa will keep her fingers crossed for it, but she won’t hold out
“I’m sorry I dumped this whole thing on you so unexpectedly.” He puts his arms around Dean’s shoulders and hugs lightly. “I know it’s not what you were expecting when I asked you over.”
Immediately, Sam looks away. It’s a surprisingly guilty gesture and Castiel realizes exactly what that means. He groans. “You already did, didn’t you?”
supposed to mean? He’s touched that they consider him a friend, but who goes around getting life threatening wound all the time? If anything, he should be the
While he would prefer not to move for the rest of tonight, Castiel knows that he needs to get up. If he wants to keep this weekend going like he plans to, he needs to clean the plug and put it back in. There’s still several hours between now and when they go to bed. That’s plenty of time for Dean to end up wanting to have sex again. The chances of that happening before they go to sleep are astronomically high – or at least just
with Dean and that is a very exciting thing indeed. Without Sam here, Castiel can share Dean’s bed with him, cuddle openingly while they’re watching TV, and do just about anything else they want to do without having to be sneaky about it.
“Alright then.” He takes Castiel’s left arm and pulls it over his shoulders. His arm is like a brand around his waist; too hot even through two layers of clothing. “C’mon then. Let’s get hoppin’ before you make a mess in my rec room.”
He gets up to put his mug in the sink and is met with an open cupboard. Oh. Castiel hadn’t realized that he left the door open when he got his mug. Is he
again and Dean takes that as an agreement. He fires off the address in a text message, just in case Sam needs it. They told him where they were staying when they first rolled into town, because it’s better to be safe instead of sorry. It’s a five hour drive from the bunker, so Sam could be here at any point. Not that Dean’s knows when he left, of course. Sam is just freaking out because no one checked in with him after the hunt like they were supposed to. That’s on Dean, but oh well. What’cha gonna do?
to jerk off. It’s been a while, but this should be easy – easy, like riding a bike. A piece of cake. Easy as pie.
Balthazar breaks into a wide smile and he pats Castiel on the shoulder. “Ah, I get it. No one does it for you, right? Oh, unless you’re one of those guys who are too into one particular someone to care about anyone else? Because that’s okay too.”
After a while, Dean shrugs and lays down again. The lack of a response might be the reason why, but Castiel honestly doesn’t know what to say. He watches as Dean curls up on his side, a soft defeat filling the kin-connection. It covers everything else and Castiel frowns at the feeling. Dean is a very confusing fin-kin. One minute he’s making jokes and the next he’s depressed. It will take some time before Castiel will know how to properly deal with him.
. It was also stressed that he should not pull them out like he was revving a lawn mower, so it could be said that it’s a good thing Castiel has never done any form of gardening in his life. He knows from his research that he simply should not do it too quickly or with too much force, and that sounds simple enough to him.
That sounds like an excellent plan. With the Winchester gone, Castiel can hog the only bathroom in their room and not run the risk of Dean or Sam having to awkwardly ask him to let them pee while he’s on the other side of the curtain from them. Their friendship has, thankfully, never had to go through that. Yet.
“So?” She leans forward, eyes bright. “How did it go? Did you admit your undying love for him and –” She cuts off with a squeak as Cas makes a grab for her.
Dean makes no attempt to touch Castiel’s mind through the kin-connection again after that. Castiel waits for longer than he should before he resigns himself to boredom yet again. Whatever Dean is thinking, he’s not sharing it and he’s not making the effort to speak to him yet. It was Castiel’s singing that made him do it in the first place. Would another song be enough to annoy him in to say something? Perhaps. There’s only one way to find out.
It was just supposed to be a normal hunt with Cas. Gank some witches, salt and burn the bodies, and be home in time for dinner. The easy-peasy kinda BS that Dean could do in his sleep. Cas went with him because, like the cloud at his feet, he’s loyal to a fault when it comes to the Winchesters and didn’t like the idea of Dean going off to do a hunt on his own.
With a grin, Dean leans back on his elbows – which isn’t easy with the fucking handcuffs (and he’s quickly coming to hate them, thank you very much) – and spreads his legs. “I prepped myself before coming here.”
thinks what he can do is ethically or morally sound. Will he stop doing it now that he knows? Or will he fight against fate and continue?
As such, Castiel feels justified in throwing his sweater over her head instead of putting it on. The ink needs another few minutes and there are other things he could be doing. “The last trip I took was at the end of
No. Castiel refuses to believe that he would have forgotten that Dean and Sam have a brother. That aside, his name is Adam
is okay. But what he is not okay with is that he didn’t put all his feelings into words like he should have. They got stuck in his throat and wouldn’t come out.
Balthazar’s enthusiasm increases slightly as he beats his tail and swims forward sharply. He slips into the gathered crowd easily, weaving between the fin-kin as they all spread out in a loosely clustered sphere.
He’s not proud to admit it, but Castiel stares at that box for longer than he probably should. The top of the box is open and he can see a few things stick out of it. He chews his bottom lip and glances around the room a few times before pulling it down along with their shoebox. This isn’t right. Castiel
“I will. I promise.” He places his hand over the one on his stomach, their fingers lacing together. Castiel doesn’t have anything new or special planned for the rest of the weekend – or at least nothing that he can recall at the moment. He
“No, no – uh – no.” Hopefully Dean won’t take offense to his hurried answer. “That’s fine. You – you can pick, Dean.” And hopefully this won’t be as disastrous an experiment as Castiel thinks it might be.

is poorly written across the top of the vanilla icing, some of it overlapping the chocolate icing trim that appears to have been piped around the edges – or at least someone attempted to.
As a nurse, he sees both the worst and best of people. The best always makes up for the worst and that’s why he stays in this job. Castiel loves helping people and he’s
better. Yesterday they went on what was undoubtedly a date, and today Dean has been nothing but sweet and all too caring with him. These levels of affection would most certainly be more than enough to convince anyone that they were more than just friends if they didn’t know about the circumstances of their actual relationship.
– and it may be entirely in his head, but feeling like this makes the tattooed wings on his shoulders itch. If he didn’t think they weren’t as compatible as they could he, then he probably wouldn’t have these thoughts in the first place. But Castiel tries, he tries
A shiver runs through him, especially when he realizes that Swirly-blue is staring at him again. It's a piercing look that stabs through Dean and it's getting really hard to meet his eyes. He has to look away and remind himself to breathe. Dean shushes a good chunk of his mind before it wants to pick apart and analyze what all
Dean props his chin up on his palm, elbow balanced on one of his knees. “We’re going to be here all night if you don’t let me help you.”
He ducks his head to lean it on Dean’s shoulder, happily stealing a moment that Sam could easily walk in on. “Thank you, Dean.” Even though these are the same words that were told to him last night, it’s still nice to hear them again now. They really do manage to lighten his mood somewhat.
Pursuing another male would have been absolutely pointless. They never would have been able to make a nest together, and isn’t that the whole point of a relationship and mating? Certainly he would have liked to have a partner he could love and be with like that, but would anyone in the colony accept that? It’s more acceptable for him to have no interest in anyone and never mate than it would be to take another male as his partner.
to take back to the Council. It’s better than nothing, though Castiel doesn’t look forward to telling them that he was shadowed for most of the day without his knowledge. As the captain of a garrison, he’s supposed to be
, but it does make time pass by rather quickly. Castiel gives his goodbyes to the sorters before he slips from the cavern. As he passes the miner’s caves, he touches a few minds of those he had spoken to so that they’ll know he won’t be returning. Their thanks are brief and Castiel lets the connections with them fade into the usual background noise of the minds from the rest of the colony.
“Mmhmm.” Castiel sinks down until the water licks his chin. With Dean seated once again on the other side of the tub, that puts him very nearly sitting in Dean’s lap.
“You sure you wanna sit there?” Dean asks quietly, squeezing his thighs lightly. “We could – I mean, it might be better to lie down again like we were before.” To emphasize his point, he wiggles down a little further. “I just figure that might be more comfortable?”
“I took one last night.” Castiel shakes his head and leans his hip back against the counter. He’s surprised that Dean didn’t remember that on his own – unless he’s just trying to make conversation again. It’s a distraction tactic? If it is, it’s not a very good one.

planning on going to bed. First he has to rub on some of that cream he got at the pharmacy, and then he’s turning in. The light isn’t needed for that.
Dean jumps in surprise and almost drops the cheese when he sees him in the doorway. He brings a hand up to his heart briefly before pulling his earbuds out. “Holy shit, Cas. You scared the crap outta me.” He grins and continues to put the cheese away in the fridge. “Excellent timing, though. The coffee will be ready in a minute and today is
He groans loudly when Dean turns the vibrator back on, even though it’s only at medium. Everything feels so much more powerful when he can feel the rope pressing into his skin. The blindfold magnifies it all into perfection. Although he does wish that he could see what Dean is doing. Castiel is keenly aware of Dean’s movements on the bed, and the slick sound of the lube he’s putting into his hand. Is he going to pull the vibrator out while it’s still on? Is that safe?
With a yawn and a fuzzy feeling in his head that he hasn’t had since he was fully human, Castiel throws the blankets back and swings his legs over the edge of the bed. Dean must be bringing him something to wear for today like he has every day so far. He also brings him something to wear at night too. Last night he produced a flannel pair of pajamas – matching shirt, matching pants in a plaid of varying shades of green. It’s unbelievably comfortable to sleep in and he’s never been so
they get home, that might be enough to satisfying him and he won’t be preoccupied with thinking about it later.
“I have no sexual preferences.” There. That’s perfect and hopefully Dean won’t question it too much. Just in case, Castiel mentally crosses his fingers and hopes.
Ellen sighs and grabs one of the thick binders next to her. She flips it open and tabs through to a specific section. “You two were providing protection for the University today, weren’t you?”
When he first woke up, he hadn’t planned to start his day with a cold shower again. It doesn’t exactly surprise him that this is what happened. He
Up until that moment, Castiel had no idea that there was a note tucked under the bookmark. It stares at him, the stark white of the paper standing out against the darker shade of the book pages. He stares at it for a long moment, trying to remember when he put that there. Nothing jumps up in his memory and Castiel briefly wonders if someone else did it. But that can’t be right, no one but him has had possession of this book since he put the bookmark there during lunch.
The look Cas gives him is grim. “A third.” He nods. “We’ll call them… Voldemort, purely for the purpose that we do
“I see.” His voice is tight, because he doesn’t. He just can’t wrap his head around how anyone could just up and leave such good people as Dean and Sam.
Castiel needs to know. He has to know if he somehow just ruined their friendship by giving in to his most selfish of desires. It’s more likely that he
“It’s my birthday.” He shrugs and slips an arm over Castiel’s waist as he wiggles closer. “I think I’m allowed to call you whatever I want.”
When Dean returns, he saunters around the corner from the hall. He’s lips are tilted in a seductive grin and his eyes alone are enough to read exactly what he wants. “I’m not saying we should roleplay, but I definitely think you should blow me in that outfit.”
“Hello, Dean.” That rough voice is unmistakable. Grinning, Dean pulls the door open to find Cas leaning on his staff. He is, however, practically

The longer this talk is put off, the worse Castiel feels. He wants to talk to Dean soon and – And there’s no time like the present.
That’s not very surprising. When Dean is unhappy, he makes it very clear when he doesn’t want to talk to people. “Please thank Bobby for me when you get the chance. Anything he can do to help is and will be greatly appreciated.”
not the right time for him to confess that he’s been in love with Cas for more than half his life. “And that’s not the point here –”
Yeah, no, not even thinking about somewhat good memories is enough to stop Dean from being annoyed about this. They had a set meeting time and Cas isn’t here. It’s getting really fucking hard
The thing is, as much as Dean loves Cas, he’s pretty sure a relationship is never going to happen between them. Cas has no sex drive to speak of. He falls pretty securely on the ace spectrum and has absolutely no interest in it. Dean, meanwhile,
Dean’s grin has softened considerably. He pulls the collar of his shirt down enough to reveal a slightly faded
with him. Dean was just as mad with him at first, and now he just feels… like a complete and utter jackass.
His attempt at trying to dissuade Dean from this silliness earns him a fuzzy pair of socks to the face. “Just trust me on this, Cas.”
“You don’t know that.” He mumbles under his breath as his free hand seeks out Castiel’s fingers to link them together.
He needs to see Dean’s face to properly gauge his reaction. Castiel glances at him, confirms that Dean does indeed look confused. Wonderful. With a shrug, he looks back to the screen  and crinkles his nose. The blow job has stopped and the woman in the video is now sitting on the counter of a kitchen. Her partner is kneeling in front of her and giving her some very enthusiastic cunnilingus. Castiel can’t help but wonder if that’s pleasurable to receive too. Is being the one to give it also fun, regardless if it’s a woman or a man on the receiving end?
Castiel presses his lips together, unsure if he should say anything about it. He doesn’t want to have to explain to Dean
Cas brushes imaginary dirt from his lap and tries not to look like he’s being a smug bitch about this.
From where Castiel is sitting, there’s nothing weird about wanting to see your partner in something soft and pretty. In fact, he’s having a hard time
Anna shakes her head and fans her eyes. “But my allergies are flaring up and your feathers are just going to make them worse.”
Dean slurred his way through a confession; admitting that he’s never told anyone, and he’s barely even acknowledged it himself. Despite that, he wanted Castiel to know. He wanted Castiel to know because, in Dean’s words, he’s understanding and accepting, and because he isn’t straight either. Sure, he could have gone to Charlie and told her first, but he didn’t. He still hasn’t, as far as Castiel knows. No one knows except for the two of them, because Castiel knows how to keep a secret.
Cas tilts his head at him and there’s a twinkle of amusement in his eye. “You’ll have no idea if I pick one that is or isn’t, will you?”
“What if I pay for the truck?” He makes the offer tentatively, hoping that he isn’t stepping on any toes. If Castiel can help make this move easier on everyone, then he would be more than happy to do it. “We have three drivers here with you two and Sam. The moving truck could fit the majority of everything and the pickup and car can take the rest. We would only need to make one trip. And once everything has been moved into the new apartment, we’ll have more time to come back here and clean up.”
It looks like Dean is contemplating that for a moment or two, but then he nods and Castiel can hardly keep himself from grinning. He pulls at the leash again and moves his hand into his hair, pulling his head back enough for a rough kiss. Castiel dies a little inside as he forces himself to keep it short and step away. There’s something he needs to get in the other room, even though it’s killing him to have to leave the room for any reason.
It takes Cas finishing his whole cup of coffee and pouring another before he even acknowledges that Dean is in the same room. He turns around and leans back against the counter. “Thrift store.”
That sting in his nose grows worse and Castiel blinks rapidly to fight back against the tears; his throat closing up.
“If you were really hyperventilating, I would have gotten you a paper bag.” He rolls his eyes and backs Gabriel up the few feet to the toilet. The lid is down and it only takes a shove to make him sit down. “Have you told Kali about this yet?”
Castiel nods. “They signed the lease-to-own agreement earlier today.” And even though he’s the one who instigated all this change, he’s having a bit of an out-of-brain experience with realizing that yes, this actually
Castiel lets her pull him to his feet too, but there’s no heart in anything he does. He doesn’t want to get ready, he doesn’t want to clean up; he doesn’t want to do a damn thing. All Castiel wants to do is go home, curl up in his bed, and never come out from under the blankets again. Actually, it would be even better if he could curl up in
Hopefully tonight will be fun. Everyone else is old enough to drink, but with Hannah as his ride home, Castiel is glad to know that he won’t be the only sober one there. And considering how he was the one time that he drank with Dean and his friends, Castiel won’t drink anything alcoholic that anyone might try to sneak him at the restaurant. He doesn’t want to accidentally start getting flirty with anyone – which is apparently what he does when he drinks.
Together, they make for a hot commodity in the business of questing. Dean maintains his low profile of being nothing more than a lowly Page by biting his tongue and deferring to Sam whenever their travels bring them into a town where they can pick up various quests. The funds from completing those will carry them over to the next town, and there they repeat the process all over again. It gets them full bellies and warm beds to sleep in, so they see no point in ending their way of life any time soon.
But this town is impeccable. Normally every town has some part of it in disrepair – from travelling marauders, thieves, monsters, or natural disasters. There was none of that here. Every building was well maintained and the roads clean. There were a lot more women around than he’s used to seeing too, now that he thinks about it. Not only did that stick out to Castiel, but he also noticed a bell standing mounted in the center of town.
Gabriel’s attempt at comfort comes through their private link and Castiel actually sinks towards the auditorium floor slightly, his fans drooping.
Michael either isn’t aware of the glare, or he just doesn’t care. His attention, currently, is focused on Castiel.
Sam nods in agreement, though his eyes are on his phone. After a moment, he presses it against Castiel’s ear. “Here! Talk to him.”
“This –” Dean takes a shuddering breath that he blows out through his nose in a loud huff. “This was supposed to be
is not the right word for that. Castiel mostly grins and bears his way through them, happy to be just speaking to Dean even if the content isn’t exactly his most favourite of conversations.
“Hey stranger. Long time no see!” Good Lord. His voices sounds even better in person. With some effort, Castiel forces himself not to visibly swallow as he gets into the car, gingerly sliding onto the front seat. Thankfully, Dean doesn’t seem to notice. All he does is nod at Castiel’s book bag. “That all you got?”
“I gotta get going.” Dean steps away from the counter and Castiel hates it just a little bit, in the most confusing of ways. He wants Dean to go so he won’t be late for work and so things will calm down at the café quickly, but at the same time he doesn’t want Dean to go. Castiel

Aside from being too comfortable to move, he also has a very good reason as to why he doesn’t to go. “I still feel really wobbly when I walk. I don’t want to stumble and have Sam question it.”
With that, he leans forward and plants the softest, sweetest kiss on his lips. There’s a smattering of laughter from everyone gathered, and it covers the sound of the officiant clearing her throat. It still takes a moment before Cas pulls away again. She gives them both a warm smile, clearly pleased that she’s marrying two people so obviously in love, but Dean barely notices it.
“Here, hold this.” Dean shoves a still warm casserole dish covered in tin-foil into Castiel’s hands and turns to the fridge. From it, he takes out two six-packs of beer. “Sammy, do you have the popcorn and cards? We need at least four bags of popcorn.”
“Maybe not in the conventional sense, but that’s what they used to worship me as after I died.” Amarok hums to himself and continues down the line of basins until he reaches the altar with the carved stone pillar behind it. He reaches out and runs his fingers over the carvings. “It was nice to feel appreciated, so I did my best for them.”
To his surprise, Anna is nowhere to be found. He’s somewhat impressed to find that she actually did as told. She did, however, leave a note taped to his bedroom door. It’s simply a large sad face with
“Will you make the same sounds when I’m inside you?” Cas sounds breathless as his teeth catch at Dean’s earlobe. “Will you squirm as nicely as you do now when I’m moving in you?”
It’s kind of nice seeing Cas like this. Dean originally pegged him as being a quiet, nerdy guy, but this is a whole new side of him. He keeps talking about it, eventually leading off into the badass mermaid books that he’s written and that they actually started out as
“That’s what most people tend to call me.” Cas turns that smile on him again and oh man. It makes Dean’s insides go all wibbly. “But it’s Castiel Novak, for the record.” He waves a hand to brush it off while rolling his eyes. “My parents were very religious and my siblings and I are all named after angels. Most of my siblings got Archangels, and I got saddled with the angel of Thursday because that’s the day of the week I was born on.”
Instead, Ann merely crashes into him from behind. Her mind joins his in the kin-connection immediately, barely requiring any concentration to do it. She laughs and crushes him in an all too tight hug, exuding every bit of excitement and delight that Castiel was moments before Dean kissed him.
. Oh God, he’s never going to be able to get back to studying now. His curiosity is going to want to know just how many numbers are in that phone and he absolutely doesn’t want to think about it any further.
He should have said no. Is it too late? Can he just go out there and tell them he changed his mind? God, no. He can’t. He wants to throw up just thinking about confronting them like that.
?” His nose crinkles as he sneers the word, as if the mere idea of having friends like the ones Castiel has is something to be disgusted by.
Anna still manages to get her hands on the gravy at some point during the meal. Castiel suspects that Sam slipped it to her. Aunt Amara doesn’t comment on it, so neither does he. Dean looks like he might, but Anna distracts him with conversation. It’s a loud, boisterous dinner, and it’s so
It would be nice to give Dean that news when they meet next, and even better if it was sooner than their three days between meetings. Castiel almost hopes that he’ll be able to surprise Dean on the battlefield. How happy would that make him? He hopes it would be a nicer surprise. It might be a bit dangerous for them to talk on the battlefield, but Castiel still can’t wait for it to happen. He wants to see firsthand the changes Dean has made with how he fights.
go out, I’ve made sure the backup generators are in good working condition. We’d be back up and running in a few minutes.”
. A bitter tang stings the back of his tongue and Castiel forces it away. It will be hard to eat if he lets his feelings get the best of him. It’s his own fault for getting his hopes up and having such high expectations of the fang-fin before he even knew anything about them.
“It’s fine, Auntie.” He shakes his head and gives her genuine smile. Castiel only ever really smiles for her and Anna. “Thank you, but they’ve both been very kind. I was uncomfortable at first, but I’ve gotten used to them now.”
length at the moment and they won’t be until he goes through his spring molt. For now, all he would likely be able to manage is a short distance glide – long distance if he jumped from a high enough height, though that certainly won’t be happening any time soon.
He ducks out of the café quickly and heads back the way he came earlier. It’s best that he puts Dean out of his head entirely now. There is little point in thinking about him again. Doing that would likely only increase his desire to photograph him and there is no way Castiel could muster the courage to simply walk up to Dean and ask him to let him do that. Gabriel would be mortified and Castiel would likely never be able to show his face in the café again.

hard not to let that bring down his high from this good news. And that’s a really hard thing to do, because he’s still got worry gnawing away at his insides. Worry and about half a dozen different feelings that mostly stem from being annoyed with Sam.
By taking that picture, Castiel has intruded on a moment he was not a part of. Anyone could have caught him in the act and if that had happened he could have been labeled a stalker – or worse. Guilt is a heavy, uncomfortable weight ballooning in his chest and he puts his hand back in his pocket, tracing the edge of his phone. He should delete the picture. Taking it without permission was the wrong thing to do and the situation needs to be rectified.
Before he can get very far in imagining what it’s going to be like to get squished, the fire around Cas explodes outwards. There’s no heat as the waves of it break against Dean. He’s distracted by it for a split second before he’s being swept off his feet by strong arms wrapped in skin tight red and black spandex. In the blink of an eye, they carry him off down the road and back behind the safety of the Impala.
to be caught visiting the workplace of his older brother. Gabriel insisted that it didn’t matter how awesome the older brother is, it would still be detrimental to Castiel’s social status.
– means having more than what they have now? He’s not ready for that. And he’s not sure when he will be, or if he’ll ever be, but –
“What do you say we order in dinner tonight, hm?” Dean squeezes his ass again, his eyebrows twitching suggestively a few times.
Dean. And he doesn’t want to lose his friendship with him. What if he and Dean drift apart? What if Jess and Sam don’t think he’s worth being friends with if he can’t even remain friends with Dean? There are too many questions and too many worries and this stupid
They turn into a parking lot and Castiel notes that one spot by the trees has been cleared of snow. Is this what Dean has been doing all afternoon? Dean pulls the car into the spot and the headlights light up an honest-to-goodness canvas sheet that has been strung up tightly between two trees. It gives Castiel an inkling of an idea of what Dean has set up for them.
The thought of Dean dying – of Castiel never having met him or Sam – makes his blood run cold. It’s hard to believe that there was once a time where he actually disliked the Winchesters and couldn’t wait for them to be out of his life. Now he’s actually disappointed that this visit is going to end eventually. They probably won't be staying for another month, since November was special given the anniversary of their mother’s death. And this visit is –
“Here, give me that. I’ll throw it out.” Dean holds his hand out for the cherry stem and Castiel dutiful hands it over. After a moment, Dean grins and raises his eyebrows teasingly. “One day I’ll teach you how to do this.”
“This could be a problem.” He sighs and runs a hand over his face. Sam still doesn’t know about his tattoo and Castiel doesn’t exactly want to show it off just yet.
the results right now, Cas.” He’s crouching with his shirt rucked up over his nose so he’s not inhaling anything – which Dean should be kicking himself for not doing too. “Can you maybe fill us in? Or do something about this smoke?”
“Just shut up and let me continue rehearsing in my head.” Castiel flaps his portfolio at him and takes to pacing again. “I need to be prepared.”
“Am I supposed to be avoiding your calls, or are you just being weirder than normal?” Castiel sighs and returns to the couch, crossing his legs under him. “Is there a reason for your call?”
For his consideration, Dean gets a trickle of appreciation in the kin-connection while Cas picks the knot in the bag open.

him, Dean’s lips draw back to bare his fangs with a rumbling growl. He squints as Castiel brightens his glow and leans in, trying to see the colour of his eyes.
“You’re acting like you just got dumped.” She sighs loudly and he can hear the muted tap of her fingers on the screen of her phone. “You knew they were only staying temporarily. Now
. There are factors to consider here! Dean hasn’t gotten much of a lead on which side of the fence Cas might be standing on, let alone if he’d be actually interested in
Would Dean touch him more if Castiel let him know that he likes it? But how could he – His body! He should speak with his body. That’s what sex is, isn’t it? It’s speaking with actions and conveying all sorts of things in something as simple as a touch on the arm or a press of lips to skin. Castiel rocks his hips forward into the press of Dean’s hand, a groan rumbling in his throat. Hopefully that will be enough to get Dean to do more. If he doesn’t, Castiel might have to take matters into his own hands. Literally.
Surprisingly, Cas doesn’t disagree. But he also doesn’t agree. In fact, he doesn’t say anything else after that. His attention turns back to the separate conversations that his Council is having amongst themselves and what Bobby and Ellen are doing with sending off the rebels to escort the fang-fin colony back to camp. Dean figures that everyone is about to go their separate ways now, and even with the awkward conversation topic between them right now, Dean isn’t ready for this.
When Anna opens her mouth again to tease him more, Castiel gives her one of his frostiest warning glares. If that doesn’t get her to stop, nothing will.
Castiel’s voice is nothing more than a whisper, but he hopes that he hears him. Judging by how quickly Dean gets them both to their feet, there’s a good chance that he did. But as soon as they’re standing, Dean’s mouth is back on Castiel’s throat. If this wasn’t reality, Castiel would be inclined to think that Dean was a vampire for how much attention he’s paying to his neck. It’s almost as if there’s something that he wants to do that he’s not – oh, never mind.
much interested in his wings, but having it said so blatantly is – God. It’s making him blush again and there’s a weird, tight ball of nerves forming in the vicinity of his stomach. Castiel isn’t sure if it’s because of his general dislike for his wings, or because he has
The exam went so well that Castiel didn’t have a single worry during his walk to the grocery store from campus. His thoughts about Dean and the picture still wandered along the edges of his mind while he shopped, especially since there was no answer from Dean during or after the exam, but it wasn’t enough to bring down his mood. After all, Dean did have a shift today and he would have left the apartment not long after Castiel did this morning. He should be done by now, actually. If Castiel’s memory serves right, it was a short shift.
. That makes him sound like he’s nothing more than a tool to Dean and he wants to be so much more than that. He knows that Dean wouldn’t ever think of him as being used
It must be some kind of record or a blessing that the first two days go by without any problems. The third day, however, is not so lucky. It’s a Saturday afternoon and Castiel is diligently working away on the promised paper his professor gave them the other day. Maybe if he had chosen to work at the table in the kitchen instead, he might have stood a chance with not hearing things – especially if he had worn some head phones and listened to music while he was working.
“Are you going to try flying again?” She gives the zipper a good hard tug to make sure it’s all the way up by the base of his wings.
Though he would like to, Castiel knows better. He presses his lips together and averts his eyes, keeping them downcast. His hands ache from how hard he’s holding the table edge, pins and needles prickling in his fingertips as Dean leans over him and that wicked mouth slides along his chest and stomach. Castiel bites his bottom lip to muffle a gasp as teeth catch at one of his nipples. It’s so
All in all, there’s more than a hundred dollars in his pocket and a few treats given by the time he makes it back to Cas’s house. He’s halfway up the driveway when the door opens again. This time, Cas is waiting at the backdoor, still in his ridiculous housecoat, but at least wide awake. He’s holding two mugs in his hands and Dean can smell the hot cocoa from where he’s hanging up the shovel. One of the cars that was here before is gone now.
Castiel can’t stop himself from thinking about how Dean could walk him through giving his first blowjob; a hand in his hair pulled just tight enough to sting only a little bit as he guides him in how to move his head. That rough voice would direct him on what to do with his lips and tongue; telling him how to relax his throat and breathe through his nose.
“Oh, yeah, definitely.” Sam nods, leaning forward. There’s a smile pulling up one side of his mouth and Castiel realizes that he’s
Castiel bites his lip because the next bit is something he doesn’t want to tell his Mother either. She was so proud of him for pursuing a career in medicine and she’s going to be disappointed with him now. But if she’s going to find out, he wants it to be from him. “Among the many things I told him yesterday, one of them was that I no longer want to be a doctor.”
Castiel feels breathless and it takes him several tries to find his tongue again. “H-h-h-” Oh God. Dean broke him. He swallows thickly and takes a deep breath to try and get his head back in some kind of sorts. “How long will you be gone for this time?”
apartments. The sleepovers staying up late watching scary movies they shouldn’t have been watching. The pinky-promises and whispered vows to be friends forever.
“If it helps, Mom’s the one running it.” Anna crosses her legs and leans forward. “She’s in charge of the invitations, so she has the guest list and is making sure that it’s only Mutant friendly people attending.”
He’s still in the bathroom when his phone buzzes again. It’s a text message from Sam and Castiel’s ribs squeeze around his heart when he reads it. Dean has made an appearance, though it was brief. According to Sam, Dean was wrapped in his blanket and hobbled from his bedroom to the bathroom without so much as looking at Sam. And he definitely didn’t say anything. Although the wording makes Castiel’s stomach turn, at least Dean is up and moving around. That’s certainly something, isn’t it?
Her nose crinkles and she sticks her tongue out at him before turning to put on her shoes. “I blinked in because I forgot my key. And I wasn’t looking at the door when I went downstairs.”
This war has made everyone do some truly horrible things. And as much as Castiel understands that, forgiveness does not come easily. Not for him and not for them. Not for anyone in this war. He tries his best to ignore those thoughts. Forgiveness or not, he still needs to talk to Dean. He still needs to put aside their differences long enough to make sure that Dean doesn’t hurt another bright-fin ever again.
rank has been granted to less than a hundred people since the ranking system was brought into place. Sure, it really only applies to adventurers, but there are a
Castiel honestly doesn’t know what his answer will be then. First he needs to pretend that he’ll be paying attention to this move and then he’ll need to think long and hard about what just happened, how it makes him feel, and how this has changed anything between the two of them. And he sincerely hopes, beyond all realm of possibility, that nothing has changed for the
“No!” Dean grabs up a fallen palm frond and runs towards the box, waving the frond in front of him like a sword. “You leave that alone! Go
He cuts the kin-connection with Bobby after a quick goodbye. His nap won’t be coming for a while yet because Dean fully intends on following Bobby wherever he plans to go. Which means that he can’t be connected with him. It’ll be easy to catch him if Bobby notices that his link with Dean doesn’t ever get any quieter the farther he gets from the hunting grounds – and especially if Bobby is heading out to a different location altogether.
“Oh, right.” Dean sighs dramatically. “How could I forget? I keep hoping you’ll come out in just a towel but you always change
“I just – I got really angry about this situation with Sam because –” Dean pauses, and looks down at his coffee. His whole body slumps with a sigh. “Because you’re
“If you want. But Dean’s going to want to pay you back. There’s no grocery gifts in this household.” He gives Castiel a cheeky grin and fetches the list from the door of the fridge. “Now hopefully he checks the counter before he leaves because I made him a sandwich too and I’ll be leaving as soon as I’ve made myself pretty.”
“See? That wasn’t so hard, was it?” Dean lets go to pet his hair softly and Castiel pushes his head into it, seeking more of it. “Now hold still and be good.”
He turns away from them to keep swimming. If he stops, he’s a little worried that they might try tying him up again.
As soon as he’s free, Castiel ducks his head while heat fills his face. “Thank you. I did my best.” He’s been praised by family before, but having his friends do it makes his insides feel like they’re wriggling in delight behind his ribs .
“Yes, I’ll wake you.” Castiel shakes out his pack tarp and folds it up. “We’ll have breakfast, repack your bag, and head out. I under-packed under purpose, so I can take some of the weight off your back until we get to Mount Laguna.”
“You wouldn’t and neither would we.” Dean nods solemnly, as if that settles the matter. “And even if you
“It’s cool.” Sam wraps her in a hug and Castiel averts his eyes as he waits for them to say their goodbyes. “I see you every day, Jess. My birthday isn’t anything special to worry about.”
, Sammy. Don’t scare me like that.” Clearly Castiel wasn’t the only one who momentarily forgot that he was there.
That’s most definitely the kind of experiment Castiel that would like to try. He can hear Dean clunking around in his bedroom. It doesn’t take long to get the lube, so he’s bound to be back soon. Which means that Castiel window of opportunity to test this out is quickly diminishing. As he stretches out on the bed and spreads his legs, Castiel hopes that he won’t look
Some might find it sad that Castiel is actually studying for fun, but learning other languages requires almost constant upkeep. If he doesn’t do something with them every other day, he’s fairly certain that he’s going to forget it. At least it’s going to keep him busy.
With some sense of horror, Sam watches as the door shuts and the two people he trusts most in the world betray him by bringing the
Cas doesn’t give him time to really think about it. He draws away slowly, hips still firmly pressed to Dean’s ass, and looks down between them. Slowly, carefully, he pulls out and Dean grimaces at the empty feeling that follows – and then crinkles his nose when he can literally
He tries to use breakfast as a means of distracting himself, but it doesn’t work all that well. Being caught half naked by Dean stays on his mind for the rest of the morning. And of course it’s painfully obvious to him that Dean doesn’t actually
The flannel comes off and Dean glances away just long enough to toss it towards the vicinity of the warped old basket that Bobby has in the corner for his dirty clothes. Before he even gets his hand on the t-shirt, the kid is gone. Like, blink and you miss it
Cas nods and that fond feeling is dragged out of the kin-connection. The thing is, Cas kind of sounds like he knows what he’s talking about. Which kind of makes Dean wonder – but he lets it go, because he’s got the rest of his story to finish. Cas must know that too because he makes a gesture at Dean.
This is almost too much for Castiel to take. He squirms slightly and twists his tail to curl around Dean’s. Normally Castiel wouldn’t have
and Castiel does not take it lightly – and especially because of the significance of the presents this year. That aside, he’s also wrapping Anna’s gifts to the Winchesters and her mother, while she has taken it upon herself to decorate the house. Normally she would just put her gifts in bags because she’s all thumbs when it comes to actually
Sam shows up in the doorway to the kitchen while they’re putting everything away. Castiel glances at him to smile and greet him, but the words catch in his throat. Sam’s eyebrows are drawn together in a concerned frown. The look smooths out a moment later into a smile.
with him than he would Victor. It’s nothing against Victor, or anything, but Dean is just better friends with Cas. He hasn’t actually gotten around to befriending Victor yet. He seems like a cool guy, so that’ll probably happen eventually. But it’s pretty hard to make friends in the middle of a war, even when they’re on your own side.
“I’m putting money in your bank account as a Christmas gift and there’s nothing you can do to stop me.” Mother sounds overly smug about it and Castiel doesn’t even know where to start with telling her not to. “Use it however you like, as long as you’re happy.” She laughs and blows him some kisses through the phone. “I miss you and I love you, mon bébé.”
of the reason. The rest being that Sam had been over at Jess’s apartment and the two of them had taken longer to get ready than expected.
gets something shuffling inside. A creak of springs in old furniture, perhaps? Definitely footsteps approaching the door.
. Anna knows that he hates the cold and she’s using it against him like the sneaky little rat that she is.
The old man hums and turns his wheeled-chair to face the table. He tucks up against the edge so he can cross his arms on it. His eyes are bright and sharp; calculating as he looks Castiel over. “Just so ya know, this town is under the protection of the Winchester brothers.”
to them, and Castiel is the epitome of non-confrontational – which is put to the test not more than a few moments later.
because Dean has binge watched every TV show to mankind and Castiel has, as of yet, been unable to find something he
, when they were both angry and frustrated and tired with the day? Does he want there to be more between them or have they finally reached the point where it’s too much and they both need to take a step back?
That stings a little, even though it’s directed at Sam and not him. Castiel follows after him, forcing himself to keep calm so he doesn’t incite Dean further. “Well, I think it’s wonderful that he wants to go to school.” He stands at the end of the couch and looks down at him. “And it’s for such a good reason too, don’t you think?”
They get the frame of the bed put together, conversation occasionally interrupted by a peal of laughter from the other room. It’s always Gabriel laughing and Castiel rolls his eyes every single time. He’s been privy to Gabriel’s flirting ways for a long time and he’s just a little sick of it.
The only time that Castiel takes issue with Dean’s flighty hands is when one of his fingers get a little too frisky. He tightens his grip in Dean’s hair in warning and his hands move away into safer zones. On any other occasion, Castiel would be more than happy to let Dean finger him while he’s on the receiving end of a blow job. But that’s not what he wants to do tonight. In fact, if they want to get started on that, they need to move this to a more horizontal location.
With his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he watches as Dean heads to the closet by the front door where he gets Castiel's coat
long time, and that’s – God, Dean should have done this a long time ago. He feels like such an ass for making Cas wait for so long, which is why he’s adamant on making it up to him. Right the fuck now, actually.
” Winchester is wearing the tiniest pair of jean shorts Castiel has ever seen. The arched edges of a neon pink bikini bottom are wrapped around his hips and peeking out over the waistband of the shorts. And there’s a matching bikini top – which is nothing more than a few scraps of fabric held together with string and hope. It’s just enough to cover his nipples. The rest of his body is on full display as he approaches the door.
The orange bright-fin next to him is – which one of Cas’s brothers again? Right, Michael. He turns a dark look on Raphael.
“What –” Sam pauses to wipe the back of his hand over his mouth and puts his wrap down. “What if he’s not there?”
He watches until they’re out of sight of the house, and his heart crawls ever higher in his throat. That final glimpse of Anna through the trees was the last he’s going to see of her for
thinks this is wrong. But a job is a job and he can tell when Sam makes up his mind. His whole body tenses briefly before he’s charging forward. The sharpened blade of his axe slices clean through trees on either side of him as he powers towards the Druid. If he doesn’t get out of Sam’s way, he’ll barrel right through him. There’s very little that can stop him when he gets going.
“Cas!” Dean comes sweeping into the room with Mary cradled in her arms. Her face is flushed and she’s right on the cusp of crying. “Quick, what’s wrong with her!”
So if he can’t date Cas like he wants to, the least he wants to be able to do is be there for him. Now that Dean has an insanely hefty bank account, why can’t he also be there for him monetarily? If they were dating – hell, if they were
“Dragons are notoriously difficult to track, even for me.” Cas at least has the decency to look slightly put out. “They are strong, and resistant to
. I actually won a national tournament for it a few years back!” Dean stops short and ducks his head. “Uh – sorry. Didn’t mean to toot my own horn there.”

to be a guardian spirit. He did as was expected of him because he didn’t want to let down the people who believed in him. And then the traditions were lost and he was left alone –
Not for the first time, he thinks that he should stop this. But again he doesn’t do anything as he flips open the cap on the lube slicks up his fingers. This is the only thing he’ll be gentle with. That’s a kind of torture in and of itself and he revels in it as he works Dean open slowly but surely. Dean does all that he can to make him do it harder and faster. He rocks back against Castiel’s fingers, his hands curling in the blankets and a frustrated growl rumbling in his throat.
A moment later, Dean calls out into the apartment for them. Sam answers, of course, and a murmured conversation starts up in the other room. Castiel could probably eavesdrop quite easily if he wanted to, but he can already hear the concern in Dean’s voice and that’s too much for him. He can’t deal with him right now.
Just like before, Castiel isn’t expecting to enjoy the act of giving a blow job as much as he does receiving. It’s almost like a power trip and he has those so rarely that this could be dangerously addicting – especially where Dean is concerned. And of course the feeling only gets worse as Dean continues to run his hands through Castiel’s hair, sometimes simply petting and sometimes actually gripping it. Every tug is a bolt of lightning down Castiel’s spine and it could very well bring him to a second erection – if that were at all possible right now.
actually dead. He still can’t quite understand what’s happening though. Did Cas really just ask him to dinner? Dinner
What are the chances that Castiel could just move out in the middle of the night without either of the Winchesters noticing? He’s already determined that Dean is probably never going to want to see him again anyways. Not after whatever it is that they just did. It’s just a matter of time now before he’s told to leave and Castiel is absolutely
“Hey, you sure you two don’t want anything?” He asks, all while jerking his thumb over his shoulder to gesture at the menu board.
Castiel is riding an adrenaline high and he crosses his arms to hide the way his hands are shaking. “How did you find me?”
Dean drags a chair around to sit next to Bobby. They don’t have a booster seat or anything, so someone has to make sure the kid doesn’t tilt right off the side of the chair and crack his head open or anything. He never thought he’d have to do this again, but here he is ripping up the sandwich into bite sized pieces to make sure that Bobby doesn’t take bigger bites than he can take. Sam, at least, isn’t entirely useless. He goes and gets Dean more napkins (aka: paper towel) and a glass of water, because God forbid that they have juice – whether in box or bottle.
, but he did feel the need to point out that he would have gone if Dean really wanted to go. As long as he gets his midnight kiss, he doesn’t care where they are for it. Maybe next year they can do a party together, but what they’re doing tonight is just as good – no. It’s
screw up too. Though Sam is twice her size and largely unencumbered by her attempts to climb him like a tree.
It’s been nearly two whole months since he last saw the Winchesters. What if he’s just romanticizing the memories? Maybe it wasn’t as good and he’s actually going to hate it? Or they’re going to hate being here and want to leave sooner. Castiel isn’t the greatest host and he knows it. Even Anna and Aunt Amara usually take over when they’re here.
. They’re so much more violent than he thought they would be. His heart is in his throat and he can hardly swallow around it as he catalogues each one in his memory.
“This isn’t over.” Dean goes deadly serious and he points at him. “I’m going to finish my shower and when I get back, you’re going to
“C’mon, Cas.” Dean pulls purposefully at Castiel’s hair again to get his attention, even while he tilts his head back further to bare his all too tempting throat. “Just – just
Aunt Amara shakes her head with a smile. “You crazy kids.” She picks up the pen and signs the agreement with a flourish, pausing to initial on all the marked spots. “I really hope it works out for you, kiddo. We won’t be upset if you need to move back.”
Immediately, Castiel crosses his ankles. It’s the best he can do until he regains the ability to actually flex his muscles. Doing so earns him a satisfied pat to his thigh before Dean starts moving and –
There’s still a few hours between now and when Dean needs to leave, but it’s going to take a long time for this to go away and Castiel needs every moment to get himself under control. He’s going to have to be very careful with his outfit choice for today. If his pants are too tight, the normal friction might be too much for him to handle. But if they’re too loose, they’ll easily show off any semi-erection he might get from – well, from basically anything. At this point, he wouldn’t be surprised if a stiff breeze would be enough to get him aroused during the day.
There is the possibility that he could take a cold shower. The gym is just on the other side of the quad and there are showers in there. It sounds like the most viable solution right now, except for the fact that his entire class is out there. He would have to risk being seen with an erection if he tried to take the long way. If he takes the short way, he’ll most definitely be seen by his class and someone is liable to suspect something is wrong if he goes to the shower without using the gym. Not to mention that he would end up skipping class and he does
“What took you so long, Castiel?” Uriel’s hand lands heavily on his shoulder, squeezing tightly. “We thought you were never going to get here.”
was able to get on the Council and the rest of them weren’t. Really, it’s only because none of the other bright-fin actually came forward to fill the empty seat. If someone older had put their name in, Gabriel wouldn’t have made it on the Council. The same can be said for Lucifer too – though he doesn’t preen about it nearly as much as Gabriel does.
with Dean?” Anna gestures at him with her book as she sits back to get comfortable the way they were sitting before.
Dean hums happily and ducks his head to nuzzle his nose into the side of Castiel’s throat. “That’s – Yeah, that’s good. I just – Y’know, I really wanted to make you feel good. As thanks.”
just say that? Castiel’s grip on his utensils tightens as Father continues. “I suspect that you have learned to disrespect your parents because they treat theirs poorly as well.”
Dean only partially listens. “Not alone you’re not.” He opens the driver’s side door and pulls the latch that pops the trunk.
Sam shares a look with him and shrugs. It’s not more of a twitch of his shoulder as he slumps back in his seat too. “Sorry. He took Dad’s distance a lot harder than I did, and then he stopped answering our calls and didn’t return our messages and, well –” He flops his hand out in the general direction of the hall.

for him. This is where any attraction that Dean had for him is gone; blown away like a puff of smoke in the wind. But then Dean’s too-warm fingers find the gland and Castiel twitches. He jerks forward with a gasp at the jolt that runs through him when he actually
He leans his hip against the stretch of wall that separates Sassafras’s door from her neighbour’s. “Were you the one riding her in the shows or are you one of those guys who owns the horse but other people do all the work and train ‘em?”
Bobby clears his throat and attempts to get everyone gathered to start focusing on their weaving again, but no one pays attention. Their focus is entirely on Sam and Jess. They’re all waiting and they all cheer in the kin-connection when Sam holds out the hand with the pearl. Jess takes his hand between both of hers and presses kisses to his knuckles. Her joy is a bright, burning light in everyone’s minds and Castiel knows, without a doubt, that she would be singing if she could be. Jess wraps her arms around Sam’s shoulders and pulls him in for a long kiss. Her tail gets all wiggly in delight, buoying them both in place.
These are all worries that Castiel doesn’t want or need. They’re nothing but a distraction from his daily life. Thankfully, he has plenty of classes and homework to help distract him when he’s starts getting
give him his phone number, once upon a time. But there hasn’t even been a hint of Dean being attracted to men after that. Having this affirmation just gives Castiel so much
Maybe if he was in a better mood, he might have slowed down and tried to talk to him; figure out just how new to hiking he is. But Castiel just isn’t in the mood for dealing with people. He wants to be
Almost as if she was waiting for her name to be said, Jess announces her arrival with a hard knock on the door. Sam lets her in and carries a slow cooker into the kitchen for her. She follows him shortly after with plastic bags in her hands that she raises above her head. “Help has arrived!”
“I understand.” Cas puts a gentle hand on his wrist. “And it’s okay. You can sit here as long as you need. And don’t feel obligated to have to buy something every time you come in here.” He squeezes lightly. “You’re more than welcome to come and visit if you ever need someone to talk to.”
Castiel is more prepared for Sam’s birthday than he was Dean’s. While he wasn’t expecting them to actually be here for it, given that this visit was decided last minute because Dean wanted to be here for his wings, he
that it makes him feel this way. He shouldn’t be bothered by what Dean does with his own time, but he is and he finds it despicable. Even worse, he hates waking up on some mornings with his first thought being if Dean will be home that night or not. Castiel can handle Dean going out to the bar with his friends. He did that before when he was with Lisa. But it’s proving to be an extreme struggle for him.
Sam tilts his head back against the couch and stares at the ceiling while he thinks. “I’m pretty sure we’ve got enough left that we can split a pizza. We could save on delivery if we walked to that one place a few streets over.”
After a long goodbye because it’s just oh so hard for Gabriel to stop talking, he hangs up. Castiel looks up at Sam with a wry smile. “He says hello.”
Despite Jess’s exaggeration, Castiel still glances between the hatchback and the truck. “Do we have enough space for everything?” He’s never been in their apartment so he doesn’t exactly know what kind of furniture they have, but he’s fairly certain a pickup truck and a car won’t be able to fit it all even though it was only a one bedroom apartment.
of warning before another body drops down next to him on his other side. Dean stretches his legs out in front of him on the blanket and leans back on one hand. The other, he holds out to Castiel. “Name’s Dean. Nice to meet’cha.”
“I’m sorry.” Castiel murmurs and rests his chin on his shoulder. “I thought a joke would ease the tension.” He sighs and closes his eyes as they reach his bedroom. “So that I could apologize properly for my behaviour. I haven’t been easy to deal with today.”
him relax. He breathes out a soft sigh and settles back into his seat. And yet nothing happens. Dean
An ache spirals through Castiel’s chest and he has to drop his head. His forehead rests against Dean’s collarbone and he closes his eyes too, if only to keep what he fears might be impending tears. The heat building in his belly is pulling tight and Castiel knows the end isn’t far off. He’s never dreaded or welcomed an orgasm so much before. Once they both come, this will finally be over – and he’s honestly not sure if that means the sex or everything their agreement entails, including their friendship.
As it turns out, Anna absolutely did take a video last night. In fact, she took several and then combined clips from each of them into one summary movie of the party. It’s not very long but , surprisingly, it
Dean grabs his hands to stop Castiel from further exploration. He had made it across his back, around his side, and again to the front where he was tracing the scars across his stomach. Castiel doesn’t realize how close his fingers were getting to the waistband of Dean’s jeans until they’re being pulled away. “Watch where you’re touching, Cas.”
your kinks?” There are some that have been made apparently simply by their time together over the last few months, but there are undoubtedly others that he doesn’t know about yet and his curiosity is on the rise.
But that certainly narrows the list of pictures. In fact, it narrows it down to nothing. Castiel doesn’t have any pictures of himself that he’s taken. He’s never been a fan of selfies, let alone taking pictures of people in general. Dean is the only person that he’s ever actually
matter that this will mark the second time in under a week where he’s had lunch there. It’s not like Castiel is going to be making this a habit – and even if he did, he has no reason not to. Eating lunch at a café every week day won’t hurt his wallet. His parents give him plenty of money for his allowance and Castiel rarely spends it. The majority of his allowance continues to build in his savings. Despite that, money won’t be the reason why Gabriel won’t like it if Castiel ends up making this habit.
“Well, I’m glad that’s all settled.” Sam stretches his arms above his head and turns for the door. “I’m going to follow Dean’s lead and head to bed. I’m
When the prospective buyers arrive to pick up the bed, Castiel and Sam are the only two home. Dean had already spent the evening before pulling the bed apart and bagging all the screws and nails needed to put it back together again. Castiel made sure that it was securely taped to the inside of one of the drawers so it wouldn’t be forgotten. Thankfully, the ones buying the bed are two rather buff looking men with a moving van. It means that Sam and Castiel don’t have to do all (or most) of the carrying on their own. They actually don’t
of the donations towards actually helping people. There are a bunch of charities out there where the money goes more to the employees than it does the people they’re supposed to be helping and that doesn’t sit right with him. You shouldn’t be lining your pockets with money that’s supposed to help the needy.
The rest of the world goes silent. Castiel can’t hear anything but his own breathing and those words ringing through his head. For all he knows, everything outside this room no longer exists. Did he – No, he must have heard wrong. There’s no way Dean could have said – but he
With another sigh, Castiel pulls his dessert over. It’s the actual special of the day and as he bites into the chocolate torte he tries not to think about how he misses the tang of apple pie.
“Fine.” He rolls his eyes but turns his head to catch Dean’s lips for a proper kiss. “If that’s what you want to do, I’ll do it.” Castiel pauses and glances back towards the kitchen. “As long as Sam is amenable to it, of course.”
? That makes Castiel’s insides tingle in a weirdly pleasant way. It’s sweet, and – and not what he should be focusing on right now.
that is never not going to be uncomfortably terrifying. Cas’s tone and cadence coming out of Claire’s mouth with her voice is just – it's so damn
These pajama pants are fairly loose and Dean’s hand slips a bit with the fabric. A strangled noise of surprise claws out of Castiel’s throat as one of Dean’s fingers pressing in between a place where
To be fair, Castiel isn’t really one for physical violence. Personally, he never once felt like hitting either of the Winchesters for how they left the last time they were here. That was partly due to the fact that he felt that he was the one to blame for why they left in the first place. He hasn’t spoken with either of them about whether or not their argument had any sway on their decision to leave, and he’d rather not know. Some things are better left as they are, and this happens to be one of them.
a good idea, but it still rubs Dean’s scales the wrong way. Dean wants to know what Cas’s family looks like so he can keep an eye out for them on the battlefield. He’s got a tentative not-quite-friendship and Dean doesn’t want to make it worse by one of his kin taking down one of Cas’s siblings.
, but it wasn’t the worst either. Honestly, part of him thinks that this is just a dream. He finds it hard to believe that he’s actually
“Sam.” Castiel closes the door, but remains turned towards him. “There is a bird in Dean’s car.” There is a strict
And suddenly everything about the outfit choices make sense. “Is that why my halo is made up of black glowsticks?” He tilts his head back, as if he can somehow see the halo by doing that. “Where did you even
Sam’s touch in the kin-connection is heavy and he’s doing his hardest to push calming thoughts into Dean’s mind. It’s not working.
“I think we were discussing about bringing that up with Cas at dinner tonight.” Sam adds his voice to the conversation. “I promise that I’m not going to let Dean sneak out in the middle of the night again.”
An encouraging tug dances against the walls still firmly place around the majority of his thoughts and emotions. It can never hurt to be safe.
Castiel steps closer and takes Dean’s arm in hand. He rubs his thumbs over the scars along his wrist. “And what about these?”
“Stop it.” Dean grumbles, making the bare minimum effort to try and get out of the hold because he’s not actually angry. “I’m mad at you right now.” But Cas keeps peppering him in kisses until he finally ends on his lips in something soft and sweet.
Gabriel doesn’t even look remotely phased by that, though he does put a hand to his chest. He pouts at Dean, eyes wide with the kind of faux hurt that Castiel is used to seeing from him – which causes him to roll his eyes and give Dean a look that hopefully
Castiel scoops him up and, after a few pets to calm him down, carefully puts him in the box too. They both snuggle together in the corner, snuffling at each other. “I’ll take these two, please.”
our friend, Cas.” Dean eventually continues talking, but he sounds tense. “I know you’re new to the whole friends thing, and it’ll probably be surprising to hear, but – uh – I’m not that great with friends either, okay? We move around too much to really keep up any kind of relationship with anybody. The only people I usually consider friends are the ones that work at the school because they’re always there when we go home, but even then they’re more like parental figures. I was still a kid when I first met most of them.”
, even if it happens to scare the pants off of him. Speaking of, he needs to get those out of the way if he’s going to meet Dean’s unofficial challenge.
“I’m fine with what I have, thank you.” He can’t even imagine what his body or his apparently overactive imagination would do if he spent the day walking around in Dean’s clothing. That is not a risk Castiel is willing to take. “Besides, I can just buy more while I’m out with Gabriel if it’s going to be a while yet. We’re going to check today to see if I can get any of my things.”
His heart is in his throat when he walks into the living room with his wings out. Both Winchesters are stretching; Sam has a leg up on the back of the couch and he’s bending over it, holding onto his foot with his forehead touching his knee. He’s changed out of his sweatpants into a tank-top and shorts, while Dean is wearing sweatpants that are practically molded to his legs as he does lunches in place by the door. Has he always had such muscular thighs? And his
A warmth akin to liquid honey spreads through Castiel’s chest at the sight of Dean satiated and happy in
Sam hesitates, looking from Dean to Castiel. His eyebrow quirks in an unvoiced question and Castiel nods at it. “I’ll take care of him.”
Any comeback Dean might have had dies on his tongue when Mary clears her throat. They both flinch in surprise and look back at her. The slight difference in their height is a teasing argument they’ve had a number of times and they had fell into the trap it usually is for them – primarily because Dean refuses to let Castiel forget that he’s only a
He waits until Sam is looking forward again before letting go and settling back into his seat. “I half expected that you would know by now.”
It’s not a feeling that he enjoys having. And he’s not going to talk about this with them again if their opinions are going to be so different on the matter.
Immediately, Castiel is conflicted. A part of him is absolutely horrified by the possibility that Dean is getting something related to porn. Another part of him is beyond elated that this could potentially be the next step that Castiel has been looking for. But the next step to
“And don’t be so hard on Dean tonight. He’s clearly going through some things and we should let him work through it on his own until he asks us for help.” Castiel smiles at him before turning away to open the door. “I’ll be back after the movie. If anything happens, I’ll call.”
Certainly there have been mornings where he’s woken up aroused or he’s woken up with a mess in his underwear, but he could never remember any specific kind of dream that would have inspired it. This morning is
“So, what’s going to happen?” Sam keeps glancing at him and it’s vaguely worrying. The spike in Castiel’s nerves must be felt, because he turns back to the road and firmly stares out the front window. “Are you going to keep your last name, or hyphenate? Or are you officially going to be a Winchester?”
He ducks his head and turns to look out the side window. It always makes his cheeks burn whenever Dean praises him for things like this. Castiel likes it when he does this, and that’s perhaps the reason why he quietly adds; “And German.”
Speaking of which, the longer that they’re all gone, the larger the danger grows. Castiel looks to Dean, ready to get things over with so they can finally leave.
He pulls his mitts on before pushing the building door open and ducking out into the winter air. It’s not too cold, but he wraps his scarf over his nose and makes a run for the bus stop. His boots are heavy duty and used to belong to his dad, so he doesn’t even have to think twice about cold or wet toes for the whole day. Thank God, because he’s going to be calf-deep in snow for
Maybe that’s what has Castiel’s nerves all up in arms? It’s all happening so fast. They’ve only been in
Castiel brings his knees to his chest and puts his head between them. He struggles to get his breathing under control, counting each one and holding it before exhaling.
And he doesn’t want to be. Just like he doesn’t want to be mad at Cas, or at himself. It’s fang-fin nature to be hot blooded, but that’s what got them in this trouble in the first place. He needs to learn how to keep his head cool and have better control over his emotions when he’s frustrated by something. Dean needs to learn to be – to be
A better question would be, what were they talking about again? It takes a moment for Castiel’s thoughts to arrange themselves into something understandable again. Oh, yes. Dean had mentioned that there are people who don’t like having their nipples or their asses touched. Castiel
“Oh don’t worry about it.” Dean chuckles again, sounding happier talking to Ms. Maggie than he has in weeks. His voice gets a little further away, obviously heading towards the fridge. “I can’t usually wear my ring because of my classwork, and we usually don’t mention being married at work for, y’know, professional reasons.”
Talking is fine. Talking won’t hurt anything. And maybe she’ll know of a good way to commemorate this time of his life. He hasn’t found a single thing that he likes so far to use for it and the idea for a tattoo has still been lingering away in the back of his head. His palms feel sweaty and that has nothing to do with having just been jogging. Castiel is actually
These are some heavy questions and Castiel contemplates them, and more, for a long time. He’s honestly not sure how long he can last like this anymore, and especially if they’re going to have more days like yesterday that fill him with a pointless hope. But he doesn’t want to give this up. Now that he’s had a taste of it, now that he knows how good it feels to have all this, he doesn’t want to let it go. It’s far too easy to trick himself into believing Dean loves him, and that’s the real problem.
“Are we going to watch another porno before our movie tonight?” It’s only one of the many questions that Castiel has been going over all day. They’re direct and to the point because he will
The gears are turning in Dean’s head and Castiel knows he wouldn’t dare have the gall to laugh in his face. Today is just a day
As he goes, Castiel points to the open door on his right. “That’s the full bath.” Opposite it is a closed door and he points to that next. “That is my office. Do
The laughter continues, and that jiggling better stop soon. “Was it as good for you as it was for me?”
An unexpected cry is ripped from his throat as Dean wraps his lips around him and proceeds to take every inch of Castiel’s erection into his mouth. He sinks down so far that Castiel can actually
With the slow purpose of nature itself, Castiel pointedly ignores every attempt Dean makes to get him to do anything beyond this. He angles his hand to ensure the next thrust of his fingers brushes over Dean’s prostate. When he does that, he can actually
nice to hold him, even if just for a too short while. There are other things to worry about now and Dean touches at that nothing-feeling in his head where Cas is, brushing it with his concern. Hopefully he’ll actually get an answer.
Aunt Amara is in the living room, sitting on the couch and watching TV. She drank more than Castiel did and she doesn’t even have a hair out of place. She gives him a finger-wiggling wave and a smug smile. This would have been slightly more tolerable if she was suffering like he is. It’s moments like this that he thinks she must be a mutant in
Once he realizes what he's doing, Dean doesn't stop. It feels too good and he wants more. He wants the actual link. He wants the beautiful bright thoughts of another person in his head before he goes any crazier than he already has. Mother-sea help him, he just wants something
Castiel bites his bottom lip and clears his throat. “You can sleep here for the rest of your visit.”
Castiel is still planning things when he hears Sam wake up and start puttering around the apartment. He must have noticed that Castiel is still in bed, as he’s being quieter than he usually is. His consideration is warming, though unnecessary. But Castiel appreciates it nonetheless.
“Thanks, I’ll give them a call.” She snatches up the clipboard and immediately reaches for the phone. Even though Becky can be a little
Dean groans loudly and kicks the door of their apartment closed behind him. It’s pushing half-past five and his stomach is grumbling. Hopefully Cas has dinner at least sort of started. If not, then they’re ordering in because Dean is
Having someone hunt for him isn’t even necessary because Castiel is a very good hunter himself, but he likes letting Dean think it’s needed. He finds it endearing, really – which is why he lets Dean hunt for him now. It gives Castiel the chance to stretch his muscles with a leisurely swim and subtly guide their course. He has a location in mind for where he wants to tell Dean his very important things. It’s a little surprising that Dean hasn’t noticed where they’re going yet.
It’s a sad, sad thing that they haven’t been able to spend the night together. Cas could probably sneak away from his colony in the middle of the night like he uses to, but it’s probably not a good thing that they do that during a time of peace. Plus, Dean can’t guarantee that his colony will take it well to have a bright-fin sneaking into their camp. It’s been a mutually decided thing between him and Cas that they wait for night time cuddles.
The time it takes to get two bowls of stew and a loaf of hardy bread to bring up to their room is an
that at the thrift store. He expected Cas to pick out something useful – like a journal, or a pair of shoes, some ties, something they could use on a hunt. Instead, Cas apparently bought…
extent.” Aunt Amara leans back with her wine glass in hand. “To think you changed so much to incorporate Castiel into your life. That’s very sweet of you.”
’, but he does hear many people talk about how it happens between their friends regarding friction between relationships of both the platonic and romantic. It’s not something Castiel has had the chance to experience himself, but he does feel like this is as close to it as he might ever get.
Cas takes off his coat first and folds it over his arm before he sits. He’s dressed up really nicely in jeans and a
In a rare moment of bravery, Castiel shares that curiosity. Dean moves immediately, sliding forward so he can sit over Castiel’s tail. He leaves enough space between them that there’s no chance for their erections to touch when he leans forward to kiss him. Castiel brings a hand to the back of Dean’s head, sinking his fingers into his hair to keep him in place as he kisses back.
Dean shifts and briefly grinds his heel into the top of Castiel’s foot. He hisses and yanks it free, and lifts his head to find himself on the receiving end of a pouty glare. “Don’t even
picture of Dean. Castiel hasn’t looked at it since he uploaded it from his phone to his computer and saved it into the appropriate folders. And just in case Gabriel decided to snoop, Castiel also searched how to password protect his files so there would be no risking it. He doesn’t even want to imagine how Gabriel would react if he found that photo. It’s been bad enough when his brother asks him every other day why he goes to the café instead of taking a lunch like he used to.
up on one. Even with his echoes he can’t accurately tell if something is behind him. He can’t even rely on being able to feel the water being displaced. On the battlefield, that’s nearly impossible to notice because the water is
That’s almost enough to make Castiel close the kin-connection. He never returned from that battle, but the three he had been fighting did. There is no doubt in his mind that his entire garrison must think him dead. Which means that his family would know by now too. Tears burn in his eyes and he has to bite back a sob. He has to keep face in front of the fang-fin. After they’re gone, he can dwell on what his siblings must be going through right now.
drunk.” His smile grows wider as he takes Dean’s free hand in his. “I will readily admit that I know very little about most things having to do with relationships, but I thought – I had figured that you weren’t ready.”
The sound of his phone beeping in his pocket draws him back into the present. He fishes it out and thumbs the screen without really looking, still wondering if maybe he should bite the bullet and move into a three-bedroom place, put all his memorabilia in one room, have a roomie in the other, and leave the shared space looking plain and boring. That way, he won’t have to deal with judgemental eyes and quick excuses why the place just isn’t

Now that is certainly amusing. “I’m surprised you trust me enough with the stove for this.” He laughs but accepts the spatula and takes Dean’s place.
Castiel braces himself against the counter and lets his head hang between his shoulders. The coffee maker continues to sputter and hiss as it brews a new pot for him. It’s been a long day and coffee is the only thing keeping him and Sam going while they pull apart the storage rooms in search of all the ingredients they need. Some of it Castiel had managed to salvage from where they had taken down the Witch, but the rest still needs to be found.
“Myself.” Dean answers with barely a whisper. He spreads his arms and holds them out, as if awaiting Castiel to fill them. “Mind, body, and soul. To do whatever you want with.”
The lines of Dean’s shoulders ease slightly and he turns his head just enough to look at Castiel from the corner of his eye. “S’nothing.”
Dean tucks his hands behind his head and stares up at the gray sky. The sun is warm on his skin and the clouds drift by in wisps of white, ringed in silver and gold when they pass over the sun. But their backdrop is gray and it has been ever since he turned sixteen. At sixteen, Dean lost one of the most beautiful colours in the world and he misses it every day. It’s been almost ten years since then, and he can still remember the vibrancy of the sky.
“I asked you out for a beer, but I can hit on you too if you’d like. I’m a little rustier at that, though.” Cas laughs and stands up straight. “I thought you might be interested, seeing as this whole time you’ve been watching
. First one finger, and then the second. They twist and turn, rubbing shallowly at his insides before starting the in-and-out pattern again, pushing deeper every time.
Castiel settles in the corner of his bed with the blanket pulled over his legs to keep them warm. He boots his laptop up and plugs his headphones in. If his studying results in him having to view any kind of videos, then he doesn’t want to risk Sam catching sight of his screen or hearing anything undue. And just so no one will find out what he’s doing, Castiel makes sure that all of his searches are done in an incognito browser. He wouldn’t put it pat Gabriel to get a hold of his laptop and check his history just to find something he could tease him with.
They’re not that high up yet and Castiel does the only thing he can think of. He presses the muzzle of the gun into the flier’s stomach and pulls the trigger. The gun gives a soft
“That sound lovely.” He nods excitedly, pleased that they have plans now. “I’ll see you next week then.”
. They’ve helped Castiel grow a lot since he first met them last November. Because of them, he went to see
Castiel completely misses how the furniture usually creaks when someone stands up or sits down. He’s not aware that anyone has moved until Sam makes a quiet, unhappy sound. “
, thank you very much.” Dean sniffs and mirrors her body language. He holds his head high and puffs up slightly. “We’re paying for our stay with out-of-this-world companionship and delicious as hell food.” All his posturing is gone as quick as it came and he looks Anna over again. “You hungry? I can heat up some of our lunch for you.”
With a sigh, Dean lists to the side and rests his head on Cas’s shoulder. “You’re already the perfect companion for me.”
Surprisingly, that seems to work. Halfway down the beach, Toby skids to a stop, turns, and starts running back. He dodges happily around everyone that tries to grab him; tongue lolling out and tail wagging excitedly. This is clearly all a game to him and he hasn’t a clue that he’s going to give Castiel a heart attack right here on the beach. He had better hope that’s what happens, because the murderous looks from some of the contestants is enough to make him want to abandon everything – Toby included – and make a run for his car.
He takes a shuddering breath and in that moment all Castiel wants to do is comfort him. The best that he can do right now is slide his fingers into Dean’s hair. It makes Dean pause and he shudders slightly, though he doesn’t pull away. Instead, he leans into Castiel all the more.
According to Gabriel, Dean has a voracious sexual appetite. Currently, Castiel doesn't do anything. He
It’s so unexpected that Castiel can’t help but smile as he shrugs out of his shirt. He folds it carefully over the rest of his clothes and begins on his pants. “I believe you wanted me to put on new underwear?”
“You should have seen how he lit up when we found it at Walmart.” Sam calls from the open kitchen door. “It was
He gives another jaw cracking yawn and stretches out. “Then we took Amara and Anna home, and Sam wanted to stop at the 7-Eleven to get Slurpees. By the time we got home and to bed, it was almost four o’clock. So –” Dean stretches out until he can put his foot in the middle of Castiel’s back and all but shove him off the bed. “So
Despite that, a few minutes pass in silence. “Okay – so –” A flush builds in his cheeks before he swallows thickly. With a deep breath, Dean finds his voice and continues. “Well, for a while now I’ve kinda thought that, well, that something was broken in mean.” He pauses and frowns at the ceiling. “I mean, I thought I was
at the idea. He still wobbles as he sits forward, but now he’s smiling. “Really? Finally!” Cas makes a few attempts before managing to get both hands on Dean’s shoulders. “I’ve been waiting
. He didn’t see Anna again until after she presented and he was seventeen at that time. Even still, it was nice to have family close by, finally. The only people Castiel ever saw during those eight years were his parents.
“I didn’t say that.” Dean strokes a thumb over his cheek and Castiel turns his face into the touch before he even realizes that he’s doing it. “I like the idea of you hunting with us – but only once you’re
To Castiel’s unending frustration, Dean does end up drawing back again. “You’re not making this easier.”
Anna chews her bottom lip for a moment and, clearly not having learned her lesson, opens her mouth for another poke at the hive. “What are you going to do about it?” She looks between the Winchesters again. “I mean, are you going to confront him about it?”
His smile falls and he looks down at their hands with a frown, his frustration feeding into the kin-connection.
“Good.” He pats Castiel on his cheek before he leans down to kiss his forehead. “And you know what I want you to say when I give you an order, don’t you?”
Samandriel follows closely beside him as they orient themselves towards the trench. The swim itself is conducted mostly in silence. Neither of them are particularly close, so Castiel doesn’t much mind it. He honestly barely even knows Samandriel more than his name or position in his garrison. That silence only lasts for around half the swim back. It's the exact amount of time it takes for Castiel's curiosity to reach its breaking point – though that has never been very long to start with.
“Sir, yes sir!” Dean salutes and snaps his heels together. He does an about face with military precision and proceeds to gather the dishes and take them to the dishwasher.
While Sam rants, Castiel pretends he’s listening just like he pretends to be studying. He’s staring at the paper and his eyes are going over the words, but nothing is being actually
. He didn’t ask this time. He just took it because Castiel messed up. If he had been more careful, if he hadn’t been there in the first place, none of this would have happened. Dean wouldn’t be
“Is everything okay?” Castiel brushes his thoughts against Dean’s mind, hoping to catch some kind of hint at what’s been bugging him these last few days. But Dean’s thoughts are as guarded from him as they were when they first met.
He ducks his head slightly. “My apologies. Traffic was heavier than expected to get here.” And it really was
. And now he looks like an idiot because his mouth is moving like a fish and he’s not making any actual goddamn sounds. Cas looks amused by the whole thing; eyes crinkling as he smiles.
This is the "final" chapter! The story ends here, but there will be an epilogue for all those interested where the sexy times will be occurring. I couldn't find a good place to fit it in during the story line, so it's going to take place
Dean laughs and calls to her from the couch. “Sorry, but we don’t have the cheesy powder stuff. Will regular ol’ theater style with butter satisfy her Majesty?”
his smile, Castiel hopes that he can hear it. “Your scars don’t bother me. They never have.” He pulls lightly at Dean’s arm until he can coax him closer to the bed too. “I was asking for
“Bullshit.” Dean hisses and slaps his hand down on the desk. He leans forward, eyes sparking with mischief as he drops his voice into a register he knows he’s not supposed to use at work – if only because of what it does to Castiel. “You stayed because the sex is phenomenal and the pancakes I made you the morning after just sealed the deal.”
and he needs to stave off the appetite they worked up. God knows how long it’s going to be before Sam even gets home. A half hour, most likely.
A groan rumbles in his throat and he turns his face into the pillow to muffle it. Just because his body hates him and woke him early doesn’t mean that he should wake Dean before he wants to. Once he’s got his body still again, Castiel lifts his head to squint at the alarm clock. They weren’t planning on getting up before ten o’clock and apparently it’s just after eight o’clock in the morning. He both loves and hates that. On one hand, hates that he’s up so early and has
“Actually, I – uh – I just wanted to say what the article left out.” He gestures at the front page article and that stupid (albeit hilarious) headline. “Winchester isn’t against guns. He grew up with them and goes to the range at least once a month. But he also knows how easy it is for someone to get a gun and the ammunition that makes it dangerous. When he says he wants stricter gun laws, he wants better background checks, longer wait times, and making it harder for the wrong hands to get a hold of both a gun and bullets.”
Dean steps close to the door, but he makes no move to touch it or Castiel. His expression is oddly serious, if not a little worried. “Are things okay?”
what.” He hisses at her and drops his other bag to steer her a few steps away from the car when Sam’s door swings open. “Nothing has happened and nothing will
Castiel sits up a little straighter when Bobby turns to him. He raises an eyebrow under his cap. “How d’you want your eggs?”
Then he’s pulling back to lick his hand again and this time when he reaches down, he takes the both of them in hand. Dean damn near
a surprise that he pulled through. Those wounds were absolutely fatal. The patient shouldn’t have survived. He
Okay, alright. That’s understandable. Shocking beyond all reason, but she makes a perfectly valid point. Except that just raises one great big huge question. It begins with a ‘
Hopefully that will make Dean laugh. If he laughs, that’s yet another step towards things being back to normal between them. It would be nice to not blush every single time that he looks at Dean – because he knows without a doubt that’s what will happen for at least today, if not tomorrow and the day after. It would be nice not to worry and obsess and think about nothing but what happened last night between them.
Dean makes it across the balance bars to scale yet another wall, though this one is made of netting. He closely resembles a monkey as he scrambles up it and vaults over the top. There’s another slope on the other sad and he skids down that without losing his footing. He’s up and running again almost immediately; sprinting through the finish line.
The bright-fin changed their strategy not long after the fang-fin started working in coordinated teams. Now they have rescue teams or something stupid like that. It’s definitely affected just how many bright-fin actually die on the battlefield now. The number has dropped significantly, no matter how hard Dean works to keep it up. He’s a
“Don’t worry. I turned the timer off when you fell on your face.” Sam joins them with a laugh and a hearty clap to Castiel’s shoulders that nearly sends him to his knees, especially now that the adrenaline is starting to wear off and he’s starting to feel like he could sleep for a year. “But you did a good job! We didn’t tell you before, but most students don’t even finish the course on their first try.”
He bites his bottom lip rather hard when his traitorous brain decides that it’s a good idea to bring up an image of
to fall back to sleep after Dean’s nightmare earlier. He curls his back in a stretch, wings pushing out across the bed and only catching slightly on the blanket strewn across it.
. And if Anna went there… Castiel doesn’t want to think about it. There’s a lot of things that he doesn’t like thinking about, but he absolutely can’t stand even
at Dean while they both make themselves comfortable. In this case, that means Dean gets his pants open and Castiel very pointedly doesn’t watch him do it. He prefers taking his own time getting out of his pants when the need arises for it – or when Dean pushes his underwear down out of his own way. If Castiel does it before that, he just ends up feeling somewhat self-conscious.
His breakfast ends up being a handful of cheese cubes and apples slices. There may be apartment rules forbidding him to use a frying pan when everyone is either sleeping or not home. But there’s no rule against him using a knife. After a few years of playing assistant to Gabriel in the kitchen, Castiel has found himself to be rather skilled with chopping, mincing, slicing, and doing all manner of things with a blade. For the most part. He’s not classically trained or anything, but he won’t lose a finger.
. And it’s only because Cas is a new friend. He’s like a shiny new thing to play with and all Dean wants to do is play with him all the time until the novelty has worn off. But with Cas, that novelty has already been going on for a whole bunch of rotations more than it should have. That’s the problem. It’s
A war will give Dean the opportunity to show that he’s a better fighter. The more bright-fins he kills, the higher in rank he’ll climb. Maybe he’ll be able to snag the role of a captain. If he had his own division to command, he’d have more status than his whole family has had for generations. But that’s a sore spot for both him and his brother and neither of them likes to think about it, let alone talk about it.
Castiel quickly steps closer to place a hand on his arm. The scars under his palm have defined edges, but they’re smooth when he rubs his thumb over them. “You misunderstand me, Dean.”
Cas shrugs and glances down, turning off the tap when the kettle is as full as he likes it. “Nothing much. I worked on my knitting project this morning and Sam wants my help this afternoon with translating some tome he dug out of storage.” He plugs the kettle in and turns it on. “I see you finished shopping.”
He’s so distracted with reading the shine of Dean’s soul to ensure that he’s doing a good job that it comes as a complete surprise when his vision is suddenly obscured by his own tunic. Castiel sits back on his knees and glances down, confused. “When did you undo my belt?”
There are a multitude of reasons for that and Castiel is fairly certain (though there’s quite a bit of hope in the mix) that the reason is because of the time of the year. He’s in the middle of exams and sex is not only somewhat time consuming (what with prep, the act, some after-sex kissing, and then the clean-up – which usually involves a shared or separate showers) but it’s also draining. Dean always looks like he wants a nap after and Castiel would be lying if he said that he has never considered that an option either. And that would just eat into his studying time if he did that.
Once upon a time, Castiel had entertained the thought of being a keeper, but he enjoys the adrenaline of a good fight far too much to want to spend his time in stuffy caves memorizing songs that are ages older than he is. The caves of the keepers are located at the far end of the trench by the Council’s amphitheater. He would be closer to half his siblings if he spent his days there, but Castiel much rather prefers the open sea. More often than not, he’ll spend his days off duty being a hunter or spending the entire rotation away from the trench with a large group of farmers.
Oh. Alright. Then their talk will not be as stern as he previously thought. There are more pressing things to talk about right now. “But Father still doesn’t think he’s good enough for me.” It’s not a question and it most certainly makes Dean’s grip around his waist tighten.”
