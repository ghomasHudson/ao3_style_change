"Beautiful," Tony says, like Steve is a sculpture or a painting. "There you go. I know it's hard. You're always so stubborn. Just be here. Just like that."
Howard Stark's death? If Howard had been plaguing his life, surely he wouldn't have still wanted to kill himself after Howard's death? He ought to have been better off, then.
Steve makes a noise in the back of his throat: dry, parched, needy, the crackling of a wildfire hitting a tree-lined ridge. But he stays right where he is.
"Honestly," Steve said, glancing away, with a hint of an abashed smile, "right now I'm mostly just thinking that I definitely should have had a classier restaurant in mind."
"So I went up to see him," Tony began. "I told him I was breaking up with him. I told him I knew the truth. I told him exactly what I'd told you, what Donahue had told me. How Ty must have blamed me all these years for his father's death." Tony was starting to shake again. "And he-- he laughed at me. He told me that wasn't the real truth."
would, no. But Tiberius almost certainly had. And right now, that was the only experience that Tony could judge any of this by.
While, yes, that had indeed been what Steve had been telling himself about Tony all week, and while it might have been true for other people, he knew now that it wasn't true. Not for Tony, not when it came to the two of them. And it wasn't true for Steve, either.
They were both here because they loved Tony, weren't they? That was what this had all really been about. It was just that Tiberius was the one Tony loved back.
Steve glanced over again. Tony clearly didn't know what it was either; his brow was furrowed in confusion. That made Steve feel a little better. At least he wasn't the only one.
"Mmm," Steve said, pushing up against Tony as Tony slid his fingers inside the cuffs to check the fit.
God, of all the random late-night visitors. That explained why they'd let him up here; of course Captain America was on Tony's approved list. But what could Steve want with him right now? It wasn't like they didn't hang out when neither of them were busy, or at least they used to -- and it was good, wasn't it, that Steve still wanted to be near him after everything, after the drinking? -- but Steve invariably called first to make sure he wasn't interrupting anything.
Steve never noticed. He never knew he was supposed to notice. He's been so stupid. His throat is tight, and he hears himself make a soft noise of anguish and embarrassment.
Steve went several shades paler. His eyes were wide. He nodded, a curt jerk of his chin, and then he drew himself up a little straighter, and Tony watched the mantle of Captain America settle over him.
He realized that Tony had very carefully not told him what had happened to his heart. Steve didn't even know what he was looking at. He was ignorant. Because Tony, much like he'd done about the fact of his relationship with Tiberius, had attempted to keep Steve in the dark about it.
His hand was shaking as he slid his identicard into the reader, as he pushed the gate open and shut it behind himself. He barely made it down the path to the front door without tripping on the newly-paved cobblestones. They'd just rebuilt most of the mansion again. They'd formed a new team. Everything had been going so well.
Oh. Tony had drawn the wrong conclusion. Except he wasn't exactly wrong. And Steve absolutely couldn't tell him the whole truth.
Okay. He can do this. He can be normal for Steve. He can be good to Steve. He tries to smile back. "Well, then. While I'm waiting for a call back from the doctor, why don't you and your sandwich come over to one of these couches, and you can sit down, and I'll tell you what you've missed?"
He supposed he couldn't really ask for more names than that. Steve was desperately determined to be thorough.
Tony's eyes lit up. "Is it?" He sounded more than a little surprised. He probably hadn't thought Steve would admit to that either.
Steve didn't think Tony even noticed when the three of them headed out; he was still engrossed in conversation with Tiberius. It didn't matter, Steve told himself. Tony would get the message.
Bewildered, Steve scooted his chair farther out of Tony's line of sight, turned around, and-- oh. It was Tony on the screen. There was footage of him exiting a building Steve didn't recognize, walking out onto a city street. His tie flapped in the wind. The chyron read STARK IMPLICATED IN MURDER.
Steve smiled back and obligingly pushed himself up again, waiting; Tony decided to reward him by playing with the plug, watching the slow, filthy slide of slick metal into Steve's ass.
Tony choked out a surprised laugh. "Well, now that disclaimer makes a lot more sense." He was still chuckling. "I-- really?
"Shh," Steve whispers. He pitches his voice low, soft and gentle. Reassuring. "Shh, it's okay. It's over. It's all over. Nothing to worry about now. You did good. So good. I'm so proud of you. That was amazing. You were amazing." That's not a lie; it's himself that Steve is ashamed of. The words catch in his throat. "You were brilliant. And you saved me, because you're brilliant. I'm-- I'm so grateful. Thank you."
There was an excruciating five seconds of silence. Steve sighed and pulled his cowl back. His hair was sticking up. It was, unfortunately, endearing. Tony had spent a whole decade being gone on him, so he did have some experience in the area. Steve's glare was less endearing.
And Steve, heart in his throat, waited to hear the prognosis. He wanted someone, anyone to tell him that Tony was going to be okay. He opened his mouth to ask.
This was the moment in Steve's fantasies where he'd offer himself up. He'd smile, he'd hold out his hand, he'd tell Tony he'd never hurt him like that.
And then there was that visor. Steve didn't know what to make of that, either. It was anchored around one of Tony's ears, coming up and over half his face, holding some kind of lens in front of his right eye. The image of Tony's eye was twisted and distorted through the glass, warped sapphire-blue. His pupils were unnaturally constricted.
An exhausted smile twitches across Tony's lips, and then his brow furrows. His eyes narrow slightly, his gaze intent. Even like this, Tony's observant. Tony's focused on him, and he's doing a better job of it than Steve is. "Steve, are
can't hear Ghost's heartbeat. His suit must be muting it specifically. Clever. That was probably how Tony had tracked him while he was invisible, once upon a time. So Ghost has eliminated that weakness. When he's invisible, Steve won't be able to find him.
Iron Man sighs again. He looks away. "My father was... a stern man." He's spread his hands out on the table, his gaze fixed on the backs of his gauntlets. Steve suspects he knows what
Tony's answering grin was brilliant. "Nice to know you were paying attention," he said. "I have... a fair amount of fancy underwear. I'd be happy to show you, sometime. If you'd like."
There was no call to get greedy; Tony had definitely sounded willing to oblige him, and he was looking forward to that, but right now he wanted to make Tony feel good.
The years of practice were the only thing keeping Steve's face impassive. "Well, ma'am, I'd say that Iron Man had absolutely nothing to do with it. The very possibility is ridiculous."
"Oh, nothing," Mr. Stark says, quickly, with another flash of a smile, this one a little self-deprecating. "Workshop accident. That'll teach me not to wear proper safety gear. Had to patch up Iron Man's armor, you know."
"Yeah," Tony slurred. "Yeah, okay, go for it." He didn't think he could point to the release catches anymore, so he'd have to describe them. He could do this. He had to keep it together long enough to do this. "On either side of the chestplate, there's--"
He really didn't know what to say. He wasn't good at this. He didn't have the words for this. He'd never needed them before. And then his opportunity to tell Tony what he thought about that was gone, because Tony started talking again.
Some fantasies weren't ever going to come true. Steve was going to sit at Tony's side and watch his best friend throw himself at liars for another decade. Two decades. The rest of his life, however long that would be. And he was going to say nothing.
"Hey!" Steve said, indignant. "That's not fair. That was Kang's mind control. That wasn't you, the same way the Sentient Armor wasn't you. And by the time I'd gotten to you, you'd broken the mind control. And you were
you're jealous, because you've never done this to anyone else I've been with. What's different now, huh? Are you just that upset that I missed brunch? That I'm friends with someone who isn't you? What's your problem?"
Steve frowns as he pushes the door shut behind Iron Man, then steps back and takes one of Iron Man's gauntleted hands between his own. The metal is still warm, once again. He thinks he'll be delighted by that forever.
And then there was... him. Steve had grown up dirt-poor, and the only reason you wouldn't know it to look at him was that the Army had decided he'd needed to impress rich people to get them to donate to the war effort, so they'd scrubbed the accent out of his voice and taught him how to hold a polite conversation and shown him which fork went with the salad course. He wouldn't embarrass himself at a fancy dinner, but he obviously hadn't been born into that world.
But it was good advice. It would be better to do something, as terrible as the thought of doing anything other than curling up with his shield currently felt. But--
But Iron Man cuts him off. "Shh," Iron Man says, and the noise is low and gentle... and one-hundred-percent human. Iron Man's not using the vocal filters anymore. This is the first time Steve's ever heard Iron Man's voice, and the realization of that shocks him into silence, stuns his mind, stops his thoughts. He can't think.
network, Tony -- talked about how she thought you were responsible. And my guess is that if Radioactive Man hadn't died, the story would have still been that you'd hired him to take Tiberius hostage because you were upset about the Whiplash story, and that you'd set the fight up. That was what they started with, you know, while the fight was happening. I don't think you heard that part. You were a little busy at the time. But Tiberius has been trying to pin the entire thing on you, from the get-go."
It was just him, lying in his bed, getting ready to sleep. Him and his aching hand. He didn't think his bed had ever felt this lonely before.
Tony shook his head. "No, no, it's okay. I can't sleep anyway. It's not your fault. I just... keep thinking I'm there, you know?"
New York," Steve points out, as they head down the sidewalk together, dodging past pedestrians. Even New Yorkers don't stop for Avengers. Maybe especially New Yorkers. "I've
"I'm going to say this now, I suppose," Steve said, and Tony tensed. Uh-oh. Wrong move. "It's nothing bad," he added. "Nothing bad, I promise." He exhaled. "I just want to say that we don't have to talk about him. We don't have to talk about anything that happened tonight, or today, or this entire week. We can if you want. I'd be happy to. But only if that's what you want. I'm just saying that I'm not going to push you. We can talk about anything you want. Anything at all. If you want me to sit up with you until dawn and tell you about every movie I've seen in the past year, I can do that." He smiled. "Okay?"
And now, here, like this, Tony's not holding anything back. He can't. He spent the last of his energy dealing with Ghost. There are no polite facades. No masks. There's just Tony, who is sad and scared and reliving a fight that's already over every time he shuts his eyes.
But it wasn't going to happen. Steve knew that. Tony didn't like men. He'd never actually said so, specifically -- a fact that Steve's overactive imagination occasionally used as ammunition in some of his weaker moments -- but surely, if he had liked men, it would have been something he'd have told Steve at some point. Steve knew everything else about Tony. They were the best of friends. He'd known Tony for a decade. It would have been a hell of a secret for Tony to keep from him, and Tony had to know Steve would have been okay with it; Tony already knew Steve had had a whole lot of queer friends over the years. His tolerance, his acceptance -- none of that was a secret.
He lifts, and the chestplate clicks and comes off in his hands. There's something Tony could never have done when Steve first met him, not that Steve knew it. But Tony's heart is all mechanical now, the chestplate unnecessary for survival, and Tony smiles at Steve, a little shaky, as Steve eases the chestplate away and sets it very carefully down. He takes care of Tony's armor the way he takes care of Tony; he's never quite stopped thinking of the armor as another part of Tony. He's gentle with it. Tender. It's precious. Just like Tony.
"Oh, Tony, Tony, Tony," he breathed, and he thought he'd never tire of saying Tony's name. "Like that, just right, so good, love you so much."
; you couldn't make it through the first floor of the mansion without finding pieces of Tony's collection of early aviation memorabilia or even one of Steve's own drawings. This place looked like a staged set, a room that gave nothing about its owner away except for his wealth. Steve distrusted it.
Tony grabs a ballpoint pen with one hand and Steve's arm with the other, and he hauls him down to an open space on the counter. "Ooh," Tony says, perusing the form. "Gender-neutral, nice. Do you want to be Party A or Party B?"
But Steve knew he hadn't imagined the pain in Tony's eyes when Tony had talked to Tiberius, just now. Tony had pushed it back fast, but it had been there. He hadn't imagined the half of the conversation he'd heard, where Tiberius had twisted Tony's point around until Tony believed that he was the one in the wrong. Him, Tony, and not the guy who'd slandered Tony's good name all over his own personal news network.
"You have absolutely nothing to apologize for," Tony replied, as he set the multimeter for voltage. "I can flirt and work at the same time. It's one of my many talents."
"Penny for your thoughts?" Steve asked, cheerfully, aware that Tony could definitely see him starting to blush.
"Oh," Tony added, as casually as possible, "and I'll take the box too, of course. Sorry about that."
"Nah." Tony shook his head. "I want to try your book first. Maybe I'll call him in the morning. But this sounds like a good idea. Hit me."
"Wonderful," Steve told him, and there was something warm within Tony's chest. "That was-- you were perfect. The best."
"Oh, so you're going to skip the newspaper ad and list all my mistakes straight to my face instead?" Tony's voice was dry, sardonic, incurious, but he had a soldier's thousand-yard stare, empty and hollow. "Great. Thanks. That's so much better."
"But-- but--" Steve groped frantically for a solution. "But you came out of DreamVision. You woke up. You woke up and you saw me. You hugged me. Didn't that feel real?" He dared to reach out, to lay two fingers on the back of Tony's hand. "Doesn't this feel real? Don't I feel real?"
"Teleportation," Steve said, the answer falling from his lips before he was even conscious of how he knew it. "Tony said he was testing a brand-new teleportation system in the armor last week."
It didn't matter whether Tony loved him back or not. That wasn't the point. He just wanted Tony to be okay. He just wanted Tony to be safe. He wanted whoever Tony was with to be someone who
Tony's hand slowed, stilled, and then left him entirely; he was ripping open the condom packet. Steve heard himself make an inarticulate noise of dismay. He didn't want to wait for anything. But he could.
It didn't look like Tony was even listening. Tony picked up his mug of tea and slugged it all back like he wanted it to be something harder. He probably did. Then, without asking, he picked up Steve's mug and drank it too.
Steve realized his mouth was hanging open. This was-- this was a lot to take in. Tony believed him. Okay, Tony actually believed Trevor Donahue, which didn't leave Steve feeling too great, but if it meant Tony was going to get away from Tiberius, he'd take it. Even if Tony didn't want anything to do with him after this. That didn't matter. Tony was going to be safe.
Steve closes the window of search results before his resolve fails him in a different way and he can succumb to the temptation of the link labeled
"Fine," Steve agreed, but after Tony strapped him in he let him lean his head on his shoulder, and that made it all worth it.
Steve does. He hears the click of the helmet unlatching, and then Iron Man is kissing him, soft and sweet and perfect.
"How?" Steve asked, confused, anguished. That didn't make any sense. That shouldn't have been possible. "Tony, we all came back healed--"
It was what he'd wanted. Tony had seen what he'd wanted, even though he hadn't really known how to say that. He didn't want to hide Tony from his friends, from his teammates. And now he wouldn't have to. That was the important part.
"Believe it or not," Fury said, "your teammates care about you. They asked me to step in." His mouth thinned. "I got the impression they thought you might take it more seriously if it came from me."
He also needs to make sure that those plans don't leave this building. His mission objective has become a little more complicated. It was already complicated. But he can do this. He has to.
Responsibility, Steve decided, could wait a few seconds longer. He ran his fingers through Tony's unruly hair, then leaned in, his intentions clear. Tony kissed him, eagerly. It was a proper kiss, a nice good-morning kind of kiss. Not passionate -- not the kind of passion that meant no one would be leaving the bed right now, at least. It was the way you'd kissed someone when you'd loved them for years and you just wanted to let them know you still did.
He could do this. He could be mature. He could ask after Tony's boyfriend. It was what a real friend would do.
That's a lot like what Mr. Stark said about Iron Man, the last time Steve saw him. He wonders if they're talking about the same things.
Not even five seconds later, he realizes that this is going to be more difficult than he anticipated. He wanted to keep an eye on Tony, but he definitely doesn't want to turn his back to the enemy.
, a very polite word that masked an ugly reality. Oh, physically, she was fine, thank goodness -- but Tony could still scarcely believe that any of that had happened. So it would make sense if, in the wake of... everything, Tony had wanted to keep an eye on how his teammates were feeling these days. And that was probably even part of the truth. He was worried about Steve, after all. Steve was probably worried about him too.
about it. Iron Man's breaths are loud, heavy exhalations, fuzzing the speakers, like he's been running. His voice is raspy. Is he sick? Is he injured? What's happened to him?
He had the door half open, and he was on the other side of the room taking down the flag that hung on the wall when someone knocked.
was, but he also knew it was definitely not his place to ask. "I was never hiding anyone from you. It-- it wasn't like that."
Afterwards, Howard looks down at him, and even his sneer conveys disappointment. "Don't do anything else stupid, boy," he says. "You have your future to think of. You'll be running the company when I'm gone."
Tony's not really sure how Steve's magic Phoenix outfit is supposed to come off, and he suspects Steve doesn't know either, but five seconds later there are seams where Tony could have sworn there was nothing and Steve is opening a fly that wasn't there before, and, okay, just for today, Tony likes magic.
It's not much like giving a blowjob. Tony's cock in his mouth is smaller, lighter. Vulnerable. Steve's purpose here is to stay still. He's a warm place for Tony to put his cock. He's nothing else now. He's not Commander Rogers. He's not the man who used to be Captain America. All he is now is a warm, wet hole for Tony's comfort. He doesn't even deserve Tony's erection, because Tony hasn't said that's what he gets. He has one job, and it's simple, so simple that he can't fuck it up. He can't fuck anything up.
The theater's in the Village, and when they get out -- and Iron Man lets him go -- Steve is so distracted remembering the feel of Iron Man's hand in his that he entirely forgets to check the marquee to even see what movie it is, and then he stops dead in the auditorium, staring around in wonder.
He checks over his shoulder, a nervous and unnecessary motion, even though he's in his bedroom and no one could possibly be watching him.
After that one close call, the rest of the fight is easy. Sadly, the Masters of Evil scatter before anyone can round them up -- and Steve still isn't sure what it would take to make Asgardians stay put, anyway -- but at least there are no civilian casualties, no team casualties, and no property damage. It's been a good day for Earth's mightiest heroes. He wonders if maybe it could be an even better one.
"You don't have to," Tony said, eyes wide and panicked, unfocused. Steve wasn't sure Tony was seeing him anymore. "I'll do whatever you want." He sounded like a hostage. "I'll already do anything you want. You don't have to bribe me, honest--"
"Going to hurt a little, sorry, sweetheart," Tony said. nimbly holding the splint in place with one hand while reaching for the other elastic bandages to secure the splint.
"I thought I'd never in a million years have a chance with Tony Stark," Steve admitted, almost too quietly for Tony to hear him.
. And, yes, I know how that sounds, believe me, but it wasn't me calling the shots. But I had to watch my own hands choke the life out of him. He died in my arms. It was all my fault, Steve. It was awful."
They made it across the floor, seemingly unobserved, and reached the tangled pile of light-up animals. Steve spun, putting his back up against the light-studded wires, and he raised his eyebrows and tilted his head to the side. His mouth moved in a silent question:
"You." Tony nodded, solemn. A tear rolled down the side of his face. "He thought it'd be-- I don't know, funny? The ultimate in cruelty? Anyway, Ty pulled a hell of a lot of memories and, uh. Pretended to be you. He started out with the usual. You bursting in, screaming at me, telling me what a failure I was, kicking me off the team. That kind of thing."
It was messy, everything sloppy and spit-slick, but he didn't mind. He figured that was probably a good sign, anyway; he'd always thought that if you were going down on someone and trying to look dignified, you were doing it wrong. He thought Tony probably liked it messy. Tony still hadn't opened his eyes, but he was biting his lip, gasping out the tiniest little sounds, like he couldn't possibly hold back how much he liked this.The thought that he was doing that to Tony sent heat all through him. He was still sensitive, having come once already, but he enjoyed how it felt, Tony's body hot and damp where Steve's cock still pressed against his leg.
"And I'd never what?" Steve said, his nostrils flaring, and for an instant it seemed like Steve wanted to punch him or kiss him and couldn't decide which. Which was ridiculous, because Steve didn't even swing that way.
. He wasn't old money. He could dress as nice as he wanted, lose his accent, learn to talk as fancy as anyone who'd gone to a private school, but he'd never be one of them, no matter how hard he tried. His flaws were innate. Deep down, he was a nobody, a good-for-nothing Irish kid from the Lower East Side tenement slums. He didn't belong here. He was
Even if Steve can't see him, of course, he probably still has a chance, because all his senses are peak human. But he hopes it doesn't actually need to come to that.
need to worry. Steve wraps his arms around Tony and draws him close, pulling the blankets up to cover both of them together, to trap the heat.
Several seconds later, Steve managed to take a deep breath and think a little clearer, which was when he realized that it must not have been Tiberius. That couldn't be the case. The wounds were new, all right, new enough not to have healed completely yet. But they weren't
Tony looked at him in silence. Steve was still touching his arm, and Tony made no move to stop him. It was still okay to touch Tony, wasn't it? It had to be. That wasn't wrong. That couldn't be wrong.
It looked like there had been a hell of a lot that hadn't ended up in that report. Steve definitely would have remembered seeing Ultron's name.
"Is it that unbelievable that I might want to look at you?" Steve knows he's still blushing, but he manages to ask the question anyway. Surely Tony's well aware that people find him attractive. Surely it can't be that strange that Steve, who loves him, is one of them.
He turns, and he has a bandage on his forehead. He's also wearing a hell of a lot of concealer; he hasn't quite blended it properly with his skin, and Steve can see the hint of a bruise still lingering on his cheekbone.
"Oh, my manners!" With an abashed smile, Tony finally dropped his hands entirely, and then he gestured at Steve. "Ty, this is Captain America. Cap, this is my old friend, Tiberius Stone."
The problem was, most of the books he had here were either non-fiction -- his perpetual remedial American history, which Tony was almost certainly already factually familiar with, so that was out -- or science-fiction, most of which he'd borrowed from either Tony or Carol, meaning that Tony had probably read it. Also, Steve hadn't gotten around to reading several of them yet; it would be better if he picked something where he could confirm the contents, though he supposed it wasn't, strictly speaking, necessary. And it had to be something that neither Tony or Tiberius had read.
A little bolder now, Steve stroked him again. There wasn't anything to be nervous about, he realized. He had this. He wasn't going to mess this up. Even if he wasn't going to be the best Tony ever had -- well, not yet, at least -- he still got to be with Tony. For real. And definitely more than just once.
If pressed, Tony could have come up with multiple extremely plausible reasons for why he was standing outside Steve's door. They weren't even all entirely lies.
The production team had sent Steve some sample questions last night. With all the excitement, he hadn't had a chance to read them. But he already knew, of course, what they were going to be about.
"Come on," Steve said, valiantly, as if his face wasn't heating up. He pulled his gloves back on and took a few more steps backwards. "Come on, Tony, you can't tell me you don't carry a few fun ones for the kids too." It wasn't like they didn't have to rescue children, after all. That was his story and he was sticking to it.
"--and I was wondering," she said, the words jumbling together in a rush, "if you think -- God, I'm sorry, Cap, there's no good way to ask this -- he might, uh, benefit from talking to Henry. If I should get in touch with him."
Tony was clutching a battered, rolled-up newspaper, nearly crushing it in his fist. His fingers were trembling minutely, with the jitteriness of far too many cups of coffee.
The foyer was empty. Of course it was. It was Sunday afternoon, there were no active threats, it was a beautiful day outside, and other than Jarvis, the only other person in the building right now was probably whoever was on monitor duty. Nobody else was going to want to be here if they didn't have to be. He was safe.
"It does, though." Tony interrupted him. "I said, here I am, here's my goddamn soul, and he decided to break me. How many more times am I going to let myself get hurt? I just-- I only ever wanted someone to love me. But I guess that's just too much to ask, isn't it?" He was blinking back tears. "How long do I keep trying? How long do I give it before I accept the truth? There isn't anyone for me." He raised a shaking hand, gestured at himself. "Who's going to want
That's when Steve, without really thinking about it, reaches out and takes Iron Man's hand in one of his. He's never touched Iron Man with his bare hands before. The striations of the metal of his gauntlet press against Steve's questing fingertips, and Steve runs his fingers up the back of Iron Man's hand to his forearm, in mingled surprise and pleasure, because--
Tony grabbed one of the lengths of chain in one hand and Steve's wrist in the other. "Not so fast," he said, threading the chain through the D-rings on both cuffs to pull Steve's wrists together, then wrapping it up Steve's forearms as if it were rope. He found the carabiner on one end and clipped the two ends of the chain together. Steve could probably still jerk off like this, if he were really determined to, but it would be awkward. "That's all for me tonight," he said, with a significant look at Steve's gorgeous cock.
But when Ghost touches him this time a control on Ghost's wrist blinks blue, and suddenly Steve feels odd, like his skin is too tight all over. Ghost knocks him backwards, back down to the floor, and they're sliding across the floor toward the window, Ghost clinging to him like a goddamn barnacle.
"Didn't exactly mean to tell you like that," Tony confessed, because now that he'd started he was damned anyway, so why not keep going? "Didn't exactly mean to tell you at all, but
"It's going to be okay," he said, not really sure which of them he was trying to reassure. "He-- he's not going to hurt you anymore, okay? I'm not going to let him hurt you, all right? I promise."
"I can't say as I thought about it much." He's been trying not to think about Iron Man's body under the armor. No sense in wanting what he can't have, after all. "But I'm... let's just call it
have done it, so thank you. You were really good with that kid. I was watching you the whole time and I still don't know how you calmed him down."
Tony made a wordless little noise in the back of his throat, and then he reached out and-- oh. He fit his hand over Steve's, lining them up, his thumb stroking over the outside of Steve's thumb in gentle reassurance. "Hey," he said. "It's just me. It's Tony. You know me. Not doing anything you don't want, okay? We can stop right here if you want, take it easy. It's okay to go slow. I'll still be here when you're ready."
He's not sure how Tony thinks he's going to suit up if he can't even stand up. Maybe Tony hasn't thought that far ahead.
"Mr. Stark!" Steve says, and he nearly reaches out for him before he remembers that Mr. Stark doesn't like to be touched. "What's wrong?"
His tone is dry, flippant, although it's obvious that keeping up appearances as Tony Stark is, in fact, something that's important to him. Preserving the secret. Not letting anyone know how badly he's wounded. How much he's hurting.
Tiberius' building wasn't all that far, luckily; he'd established ViaStone's headquarters in the Stone building, which was near Times Square, because of course he'd wanted something obvious. It was a straight shot down Fifth Avenue almost the whole way -- a one-way street in Steve's favor -- following the edge of Central Park all the way down before he had to turn, and this late at night Steve could make it there in ten minutes, easy, if traffic obliged him. Closer to five, which was faster than he could run there, if he ignored every posted speed limit as well as every single traffic law in existence.
Tony's always been hot for armor. So sue him. He's pretty sure that's not a secret to any of the Avengers. He does appreciate the inherent eroticism of stripping a man out of a nice suit of plate armor. Not that Steve's wearing full plate, but it's definitely enough to get Tony going.
"Sure, you did." Maybe if Steve talks about it, he'll start to feel better about it. "No, you didn't shoot Ghost in the head. But you don't have to solve every problem that way, do you? And it's probably better if you don't. What you did-- it worked." Steve's throat is tight again; he hopes Tony doesn't notice him forcing out the words. "And everything's okay. I'm okay. I'm still here. It turned out fine."
He thinks Tony's probably always been just like this, though. He's remarkably consistent. It's one of the things Steve loves about him.
"Absolutely not!" Steve growled, with a voice he hadn't known he possessed. He was several times louder than he needed to be, nearly shouting. He could hear his voice reverberate in the nearly-empty room.
The gratitude in Tony's eyes was, frankly, heartbreaking. That was probably not the word Steve should have used. "I'm not," he said, and Steve breathed out. "Not anymore. The new heart took care of that. And as far as I can tell, it's going to keep taking care of it. It got that right."
It's the first time the thought has ever occurred to him, in these weeks of dating, in these months of knowing he had feelings for Iron Man. It's more than just liking. It's more than simple affection. It's love. That's what it is. He loves Iron Man.
"Well," Tony says, and now he sounds almost mocking, "most people would quit their fucking job, but you, you're going to say something noble like--"
He felt awkward as soon as he'd said it; it wouldn't be hard for Tony to read something into that phrasing that he hadn't actually intended to say. But he also couldn't truthfully say that he didn't want it to be true, because he did. But he couldn't let Tony know that. Except at some point soon he'd have to, wouldn't he? Otherwise he'd be-- he'd be taking advantage of Tony. The thought made him sick.
There were a series of heavy thuds from high above him, and then a cracking noise. He tilted his head back to watch glass fall out of the window above him, a window that was rapidly splintering in little spiderwebbing shards, and then a figure -- presumably the man Tony had been talking to -- fell through the window and landed hard on the floor next to him. He was wearing a bright yellow biohazard suit, complete with facemask. Dimly, Tony thought he ought to remember what that meant, but nothing was coming to him.
Steve looks over Tony's shoulder, where Tony's nearest holographic display is showing the time. 0800. Steve's not early. They both know this. This is how the game works.
wrong. Maybe I was built wrong." His laugh sounded like another sob. "Half the tabloids think I'm already drinking again. And I keep thinking, well, I can't possibly make the world think any
He goes through the debriefing afterward as quickly as he can, all his thoughts focused on the man sitting next to him, and soon enough the meeting is adjourned. The other Avengers start to leave and that, unfortunately, includes Iron Man.
didn't believe it. It sounded like something Tony was perfectly capable of believing, actually. So Steve couldn't do it. He couldn't come out. He didn't know how.
Okay, so it meant that one of the two of them had a crush on Tony, and living with that knowledge was going to be a little weird, but at least he wasn't on the East Coast team with either of them. And besides, he wasn't going to let them know that he knew what was in the box. He was going to pack it up, crop and all, and hand it back over to its rightful owner. No awkwardness required. No public embarrassment necessary. Nothing to be ashamed of. No hint of the fact that Tony had examined the box's contents. He wasn't going to ask them for dungeon recommendations or the name of whoever had made them all their gorgeous gear, much as he wanted to. The existence of the plug changed all that. Tony couldn't let them know that he knew what was inside the box.
"Do you mind if I--" Tony begins, hesitant, and he curls his fingers over the waistband of his underwear. It's the only thing he's still wearing. And that doesn't answer the question Steve has, either; it just pushes it to the forefront.
Honestly, Tony kind of appreciated the monologues, if only because none of the bad guys ever seemed to anticipate that Tony might start shooting while they were still talking. Plus, they gave him some time to breathe.
Gone is the familiar clanking of metal footsteps, heavy and resonant. Instead, he hears the soft whisper of fabric on concrete. That's-- that's not how Iron Man sounds. Something's different. Something's changed.
"You always do." The reply is instant, earnest. Tony believes in him. Tony's always believed in him.
Tony clicked over to the private comm line and killed the external speakers. "Sure, why not," he said, for Steve's ears only. "Besides, I hear I've got a hot date to get ready for. Maybe tonight?"
"Anything else?" Tony asked, quietly. "Up to you." He knew Tony must have been feeling pretty impatient -- hell, Steve was -- but he was clearly determined not to push him.
"It gets better," Steve said, with relish. "At the end, Maurice confronts Clive. He tells him, essentially, that he's gay now, that he's having gay sex and it's amazing, that he's in love, and that he's sorry that Clive is in denial and is never going to be happy. Then he basically says, goodbye, I'm going to live happily ever after with my new boyfriend. And he leaves Clive forever. The end."
him. He's not holding back. Steve never just takes what he wants, not like this. This is Steve just letting go, and it's the hottest thing Tony has experienced. Also, literally.
a robot. Steve knows that. Some people these days have some funny ideas about what it must mean for Steve to be from 1945, like he's not as smart as anyone else is, but Steve knows there's a man under the armor. He can tell the difference. It's the first thing he remembers seeing, really
Steve grunted as he wedged the fingers of his free hand between the halves of a sliding door and started to force it open. "I also hate you being in mortal peril," he gritted out. "Guess which one wins."
"What are you going to tell the world, Ty?" Tony said, coolly. He was upping the ante. And his voice didn't even tremble. "Tony Stark is a fag? Tony Stark sucks cock? Tony Stark takes it up the ass?" He enunciated each insult with crisp precision. "What exactly do you think you can say that I haven't heard before? And I know you know I've heard it all before."
At any rate, he'd discovered he'd liked Brooklyn an awful lot when he'd been living in Brooklyn Heights, back when he'd been with Bernie. And that hadn't worked out, and he'd gone back to the mansion. But when he'd decided he ought to have an apartment just in case, he'd found somewhere else in Brooklyn once more. The Avengers that had managed to stay on Earth after Onslaught -- probably mostly Natasha -- had kindly kept him current on rent in his absence. He'd moved all the furniture back in, he'd last stocked up on groceries a week ago, but he hadn't stayed there much lately. He didn't think Tony had ever been there at all, but the address had been in Steve's personnel file. It had been where he'd been planning to go tonight, where he'd been planning to move to after leaving the mansion. But a lot had changed in the last few hours. For the better. He couldn't explain why Tony wanted to go there, though.
In an attempt to clarify, Steve tugged on the hem of Tony's shirt. "Is the only thing you don't want me looking at or touching, is it the part where the scarring is, by your heart, or is everything under the shirt off-limits? I'm absolutely fine with either, but I'd just like to know which one, you know?"
He didn't want to, but Tony had asked, and it was damn near impossible for Steve to not do things Tony asked him to do. So he turned around.
The worried lines of Tony's brow began to relax a little, and there was more color in his face. Steve held out his hand for inspection, because Tony would feel better, Steve was sure, if he could see it for himself.
He tries to push himself back up, but Iron Man is still holding him, and it's not like Steve wants him to let go either, but it's not like Steve can stay.
But now, of course, Steve has to ask Iron Man himself, and that means -- or, at least, it might mean, Steve isn't sure about this one either -- that he should show up with a ring.
Huh. He hadn't known that. Whatever happened, he'd survive it. Yeah, that-- that did change the calculus here. And if it had been life or death, yeah, he could see why Steve had made the call.
Steve looks up and follows Iron Man's line of sight, to see smoke pouring out of an open fourth-floor apartment window. It's thick, heavy smoke, and Steve can just barely see the crackle of flames beyond. In the distance, he hears a siren, but faraway -- at least a few minutes out.
Tony sighed. "I don't feel like I'm worth all that. I don't feel like I deserve it. I'm trying, but I-- it's hard. I'm just waiting for you to change your mind." He gestured at himself with his free hand. "I'm-- I'm a real piece of work. I'm a mess. Somehow you still think I'm a real catch, but I'm not. My public reputation is in tatters. I've been sobbing in your arms all night. You know every single one of my deepest flaws and my worst mistakes. And I was in Ty's bed
God, Steve doesn't deserve him. He knows that's Tony's usual line. But now it's his turn, isn't it? He hangs his head.
"So," Tony said, with an expression that was probably supposed to be a smile, in a tone of voice that was clearly trying for
He looked like a statue, almost. Human perfection. An invitation to be defiled -- except the joy of it was that it wasn't, not when they both wanted it. Steve's back was a long sweep of skin, broken only by the straps of the harness, ending with the shine of the plug. Iron Man was already in him.
Steve wasn't conscious of stepping forward, and he only realized he'd raised the shield when he saw it in his peripheral vision. And then he saw one more thing: flashing lights on the street far below, in the darkness. Someone had called the cops after all. And that was a lot of cops.
The praise coursed through him, to the bright, needy core of him. He thought it was the best thing anyone had ever told him. He liked this so very, very much. Tony's hand slid lovingly, slowly, over his face, over his open jaw, and that was when Steve, to his surprise, came again, against Tony's skin, over the sheets, shooting messily between them. He gasped, open-mouthed, losing the rhythm, Tony's cock slipping out of his mouth, as he clung to Tony, shaking.
That shouldn't be unusual; in fact, Steve should have expected it. Iron Man told him he survived a shrapnel hit to the chest. The scars should, in fact, be a hell of a lot worse than just this. They probably are, elsewhere.
, and that meant something too. He'd wanted to wait for Tony, and it was strange to think about it like that when he also knew that he'd never thought he'd have a chance with Tony. If he'd just wanted to know what it was like, being with a man, there'd been a thousand different opportunities, a thousand nights where he could have gone out and found a stranger to sate his curiosity with. But he'd always known that no one else was Tony. So he'd waited for the chance he'd never thought he'd have, and somehow, like a miracle, it was going to happen. His first time. With Tony. Like he'd always wanted.
Tony wasn't out. That much was plain to see. Tony had been one of Steve's closest friends for a decade, and Steve hadn't had the slightest hint that Tony was anything other than straight until an hour ago, and it sure hadn't been because Tony had told him. If he hadn't walked in on Tony and Tiberius, he wouldn't have known. He didn't think Tony would ever have told him. Steve couldn't blame him; it wasn't like he'd told Tony about himself either. And it had been very clear that Tony's orientation wasn't public information. Tony definitely hadn't given him permission to tell people. And it didn't seem like something Tony was at all proud of being, as awful as that thought was.
"But that's not what it means when anyone else comes out," Tony continued. "People tell their family. Their friends. The people who know and love them know the truth. And that counts. We call it the same thing, even though it involves several billion fewer people. In the end, the important people know. They don't have to come out to the media, because the media doesn't care about them. So I'm not talking about coming out to the whole world. Someday, but not yet. But our friends, our teammates, the superhero community -- I think I could do that. I could do that for you. For us. I'd do that." Tony's voice grew stronger, more determined, his offer more precise. "We trust some people with our names, our identities. This is just... also our identities. More of our identities. And then you could have everything you wanted. At home, people would know. We could be who we are around the people who actually know who we are. The same people who would usually be allowed to know whoever you were dating. No hiding. No lying. Just like when anyone else comes out. We get what everyone else gets. And the whole world is still on the table for later."
"Bondage is a good look on you," Tony says, with a wider smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes. "Kinky."
"Yeah," Tony said, heavily. "I did love you. I really did. I loved the man I thought you were. But he wasn't you at all, was he? I know that now. This still isn't really you, either." Tony's breath was ragged. "All the people you killed, did they beg you for mercy too? What did you
So Steve comes around the other side of the bed, clambers across the mattress, and kneels next to Tony, as Tony turns his head the other way to watch him, pillowing his head on his folded arms, atop the actual pillow. Tony looks, while not blissfully ecstatic like he did earlier, at least like he might know what it feels like to have a good day. He cracks one sapphire-blue eye open and stretches again, another leisurely stretch, his shoulder blades flexing. He's starting to relax more. Another step in the right direction.
"Steve," Tony said, his voice gone thready, and he sounded like he was three words away from begging.
"You can touch me, you know," Tony says, amused and nervous at the same time, and Steve realizes Tony's caught him staring. "This is a contact sport."
He worked all afternoon. He skipped dinner to eat a fistful of ration bars that he'd stashed in his belt. He couldn't face the rest of the team right now. Not if Tony was going to be there.
Mr. Stark is wrong. This isn't what anyone else has, sure, but Steve wouldn't trade it for the world.
"Tony," he said. Tony tensed like he was actually bracing for a punch, and Steve didn't want to think about who had hit him, or why. "This doesn't change how I feel about you."
In any other situation, Steve would probably have been upset with Tony for that, or at the very least annoyed, but he didn't seem to be capable of having even one more distinct feeling right now. It all blended into a formless sorrow, a palette with every single color mixed together into muddy near-black.
That was the first piece of information that Tony found he was having a feeling about, and that feeling was: confusion. They should have done his left arm, shouldn't they? It was as if they'd found out he was left-handed, somehow, and they'd wanted to leave his good arm free when he woke up. Strange. Considerate, sure, but definitely strange.
"I'll get Iron Man out of the way," Steve promises Hank. "He went down hard, but he's still breathing."
He was kissing like a sub at the beginning of a scene, Tony thought, and he wanted to laugh. Steve was exactly what he wanted. His life had gone from terrible to perfect in the span of twenty seconds.
It wasn't even all Tiberius' fault. Sure, his network had started it, but then everyone else picked it up. Everyone. Every station. Every paper. Every magazine. Every news website.
"Hey," Steve says, softly, and Tony doesn't even lift his head. Steve comes back around to the other side of the bed in the hope that it will get Tony to focus. "Hey, Tony, I'm going to need you to stand up so I can take the rest of the harness off. Do you think you can do that for me?"
Slowly, carefully, Tony reached out with two fingers and traced Steve's jawline. "You can have this," he said, and Steve shivered under him like the day they'd pulled him out of the ice.
A fair few of Tony's actual villains also knew who he was, which was a problem that occasionally kept him up nights, as if he didn't have enough to worry about. And that particular situation made the fact that he hadn't told Steve yet even more ridiculous. It wasn't like the goddamn
"I trust you," Tony repeated. "You feel safe." He sounded like he might start crying again. "You're the only thing that does. Nothing else feels
An invisible force smashes against his wrist, once, twice. Steve is forced backwards and down, away from his goal. He can't see what's coming. He can't brace for it. Even with his strength, it's hard to fight when he can't anticipate an enemy in the slightest.
, after all? You don't want to impose. You've never wanted to impose. So you don't even say it. You're doing fine. You're grateful for what you have. Nothing's really wrong, after all. It's not
Tony raised his head and grinned. Steve was cool where Tony had been kissing him, his mouth slick and wet against his skin; he was hot where Tony was still touching him. The contrast was amazing. Steve wasn't sure his body could hold much more sensation in it, filled to the brim with feeling. And Tony was gentle, so gentle, deliberate and careful, coaxing yet more out of him, keeping him on just the right side of too much.
"I know you can't see my face, Cap," he says, quietly, haltingly, "but trust me when I say I'm blushing."
Tony stared blearily down at the pile of clothing and didn't move. There was an odd nervousness on his face.
And Tony, unfortunately, was there to bear witness to the look on Steve's face when he realized that Tony wasn't going to make it after all. But at least Tony wouldn't have to remember it for long.
"I'll handle this," Steve tells Tony, with a confidence he doesn't feel. "All you have to do is stay with me. If there's a shot you can take, feel free to take it, but if not, you don't have to do anything. Okay?"
And then Steve remembers Iron Man, and the rest of his concerns come rushing back. "Iron Man, is he--?" Steve asks, and the words catch in his throat, as if giving voice to his fears would somehow make them exist, would doom Iron Man.
"He killed his parents," Tony repeated. "It wasn't suicide. It was murder. He confessed. He told me his father had been weak. Useless. Unable to stand up to my father. And, see, when my father died, I inherited SI. And that meant that I had more money than Ty did. He realized that it would probably be years before his parents died. Years before he could inherit. Years before he could ever think of having anywhere near as much money as I had just come into. So he... decided to hurry it along. He arranged the accident. And no one ever caught him. And that was the real truth."
God, Steve was a dream. He was everything you could never actually do to a real person, but you could do it all to him. Tony still couldn't believe Steve was really letting him do this.
And then Tiberius' expression changed again. Steve knew, without knowing exactly how he knew, that this was the real Tiberius. This was what was beneath all the pretty lies.
The kiss is tentative, and after barely a second or two, Iron Man pauses, and starts to draw back, like he thinks he's done something wrong, like he thinks Steve doesn't want him, and Steve can't possibly let that stand.
It was a hell of a speech. The words were a spark, a flame within Steve, kindling pride and admiration and awe, everything he'd felt when he'd awoken a decade ago and a blue-eyed stranger in red-gold armor had held out his hands, and it had felt for all the world as if Steve had already known him, all along.
The polished wood of the front door warped in front of his eyes, and Steve realized he was on the verge of tears.
"Yeah," Steve agreed, disconsolately, the breath rattling out of him. "I know exactly what you mean."
Tony actually looked offended at that, like he was the only one here who was allowed to doubt himself and he'd fight anyone who disparaged Steve, even if it was Steve.
"Yeah, and if I wanted to take you to Lombardi's, I'd take you to Lombardi's," Iron Man says, and then he chuckles. "You should see your face. Yeah, it's still there. But this is better. Trust me."
Now dressed more informally, in a t-shirt and khakis, he heads back to Steve's room, and he proceeds to strip Steve out of his uniform. He knows how to do this -- from battle, from uniform fittings -- but this is intimate. This is a violation. Him and Steve, they're not like that, no matter how much Tony wishes they were. But this, too, has to be done. Steve has to believe he could have fallen asleep like this.
Steve needed to leave. He needed to do something, say something, apologize, get the hell out of here.
Slinging his shield on his back, Steve promptly hoisted Tony in his arms, a six-hundred-pound bridal carry. He wasn't even breathing hard. "Well, it's about a mile to where I parked the Quinjet, and much as I'd like to get you out of that armor right now, I think it's probably safer to get us out of US airspace first."
Tony was already rummaging around, getting out the egg carton, the butter, the skillet. "You don't want to get raw egg on your splint," he said, adding butter to the pan, putting the heat on. "I've got this."
Tony trusted Damage Control. Of course he did; they were, at least partially, his company. But as he stood on Fifth Avenue looking up at the utter ruin that the Masters of Evil had made of Avengers Mansion, it was hard to see how even they could put it back together.
. And somehow you came back." Steve didn't think it would help to tell him neither of those deaths had been real; only the one Tiberius didn't know about had been. "You kept coming back. And then last week you finally came back to me. And I could do anything else I wanted to you. I could make you do anything else I wanted." His voice was raised in wrath, distorted with years of frustration. "Why couldn't I just
Sure, Tiberius could have it edited out. He certainly would have it edited out. There was no way it would make it to air. Steve knew that. But there were dozens of people on set, and probably dozens more who would have access to the footage. And if this past week had taught Steve anything, it was that mere rumors could destroy a man, even one of the richest men in the world. Or, perhaps,
Belt undone, leaving Steve in debauched disarray, Tony's fingers were now tracing the top button of Steve's jeans, tapping against the worn brass. Tony always liked metal, clearly.
-- his uniform is outfitted with more sensors than it looks like it has from the outside. Tony can have Steve's vitals on his suit HUD all the way through a battle. But Steve can't exactly do the same for Tony. The best he can do is leave the private comm line open, with a set of band-pass filters that he's spent a long time customizing, with Tony's help. He can hear Tony breathe, and that's nowhere near all the data he wants, but it's all the data he's got.
Tony was squinting at him. "I spent the whole evening sobbing on your shoulder and regaling you with stories of everyone I was too stupid not to love, then demanding I prove that this is reality. That's not exactly endearing. And I'm sure you never imagined you'd have to put up with any of this when you met me. That, and you've spent the whole week telling me I was wrong about Ty. I didn't listen to you. Obviously I've let you down."
He'd been expecting something mostly symbolic. Something dignified. Something chaste. Instead, Steve cupped Tony's face between his hands and kissed him, hard and heavy and desperate, not pulling away until something hooked up to Tony started to beep insistently.
Tony blinks up at him. His eyes are too reflective, filled with tears. He's not crying yet. But it's a near thing. It's probably a lot to come to terms with.
Steve knows he's going to start fidgeting out of sheer nerves any second. He pulls his cowl back. He pulls off his gloves and tucks them into his belt. When he looks up, he sees that Iron Man is staring at his hands like he's never seen them before, and then his face.
Tony looked down at the multimeter in Steve's other hand, which was reading a suspiciously normal-looking 120 V. He distrusted this. Intensely.
"Charisma, then," Steve said, indulging him, as always. He thought maybe he knew enough about Dungeons & Dragons to play along. "Or, wait, no. Wisdom?"
She fluttered upwards as Tony picked up his helmet and tucked it under his arm with a clang of metal against metal.
"I can't do the porn-star trick where they put it on with their mouth, sorry," Tony said, but he was grinning. "Actually, do they do that in gay porn? Don't know. Never seen any. But I can do this, though." And he leaned in and licked a broad stripe up the length of Steve's cock.
Steve supposes it makes sense to keep that kind of thing on hand; Tony does, after all, spend a lot of time walking around in a suit of armor, and keeping it well-oiled is clearly a necessity. Tony is, at heart, an engineer. It's one of the many things Steve loves about him. Tony's always happy to answer any of Steve's questions, and he always has been, even back when Steve had many more questions. He's kind. He's just... wonderful, and that's all there is to it.
. "I am very, very good with that. Now are you going to come back here? Please? I miss touching you."
question, then it's fair to say that the setback here is in the step calling for you to verify. What we need is something that you know you don't know, and that you can be certain that Tiberius doesn't know either, but it has to be something that can be somehow verified by you, here and now, as true. Even though it's absolutely new information to you. If and only if that is possible, you'll believe that you're not dreaming."
hands. He learned to draw. Then he learned to fight. And since then, since Rebirth, his entire body has been in the service of a goal. Liberty. Justice. Fighting the good fight. He's never been valued for this. He wasn't made for pleasure.
"Hey, Tony!" Steve called out, striding through the living room and into the kitchen. "I was just wondering if you--"
Tony was mouthing a few of the words to himself -- yeah, he was definitely reading -- and there was a strange expression on his face. "Uh. This is the middle of a dream sequence."
That was clearly the word Tony had been waiting for. Tony grinned even wider, grabbed a handful of fabric at Steve's midsection, and started tugging Steve's shirt up for him. Steve sat up to make it easier, and then gasped at the feel of Tony's hands on his bare skin, Tony's fingers skimming lightly over the planes of his chest. He'd known what he'd asked for, but somehow he hadn't understood exactly what that would feel like until this moment. It was all so much, but somehow
"You've had your tongue in my mouth," Mr. Stark says. His voice is a dry rasp; his lips twist. "I think you can call me Tony."
Help was eight floors down, and the elevators weren't working. Help wasn't going to be here in time.
Steve's eyes were dark and dazed, his ass and thighs were starting to streak with red lines, and his cock was dripping down his thigh, so wet that he was already making a mess of the bed. Maybe Steve could fuck him without lube, could slick up Tony and make Tony take him just with how wet he got, Tony thought, and then he realized he was fondling himself through his pants at the idea of it. Even if it couldn't happen, it was worth a good six months of jerk-off fantasies.
Steve generally considered himself a good judge of character. He'd never been sure whether the serum had given him some kind of edge there, letting him perceive things that other people couldn't, or if he was just naturally good at it -- but, nonetheless, he thought he did a better-than-average job. It came in handy in his line of work; he'd hardly ever been wrong about who had the temperament to be an Avenger. He and Jan were co-chairing the team these days, and she liked to run the personnel decisions by him for exactly that reason. He had good instincts, she said.
-- is only saying this because he's upset, because he's scared, because he's trying to push Steve away. But knowing that doesn't make the words sting any less.
. He could hardly imagine it. Steve couldn't help but shudder at the touch of Tony's mouth, soft and sweet.
Steve moaned against Tony's mouth. He felt as if his body had gone to water, to clay, something that could be shaped and reshaped as Tony wanted it, to feel what Tony wanted him to feel. Need swept through him, a rush of arousal that was nearly overwhelming in his intensity, and he clutched Tony to him, seeking more, seeking everything that Tony's lips promised.
"Better than all right," Steve says. "Feel free to do that any time." He thinks about it and amends his statement. "Maybe not in the middle of battle. Any other time."
Tony blinked, his gaze focusing. "Oh, God," he said. "I'm so sorry. I know it's you, Steve. I just-- I panicked."
Tony's teeth worry at his lip. "I didn't say I didn't want to," he says, softly. "I just-- I want-- can you--" He stops, tangled up in words, and picks out four. "Be nice to me?"
He shouldn't get angry. He'd lose. He was already losing. But Tiberius infuriated him. And Tiberius knew that he was, in fact, getting away with it.
Clapping his hands, Ghost leans over the desk, and he starts to untangle the portable drive from its nest of wires. "Thanks for the chat, Captain," he says, casually, head tilting briefly in Steve's direction. "Lovely to meet yet another brainwashed lackey of Tony Stark." He turns the drive over in his hand and yanks out one of the remaining cords. "We'll have to do this again sometime."
Steve's smile was wavering, incredulous. "I've wanted you for so long," he murmured, and it was everything Tony had ever wanted to hear, but Steve didn't
That got Steve's attention. He turned his head and squinted, like he thought maybe Tony was still drugged. "Don't you remember, Tony? You insisted you were going to implant yourself with a subcutaneous chip, while you were making this suit. I did pay attention."
Once he's through the glass doors, he's faced with a ragtag group of strangers -- a few security guards, a harried-looking receptionist, several employees who push past Steve in a hurry. The mood of the atrium is stressed, but not panicked; they've clearly done this before.
. That was right. Tony tested the thought out. That wasn't a dream. That had really happened. Steve knew who he was now. Tony had-- Tony had-- they had been fighting Baron Mordo, and he had--
Maybe it was some kind of accident. Maybe it was some kind of innocent mistake. Maybe there was a sensible explanation for all of this. But it looked bad. It looked really, really bad.
"Whatever you want me for," Tony said, thickly, and then he stopped for a good twenty seconds because his brain hadn't figured out how to finish the sentence. "Whatever you want me for, you're going to want me to be able to think straight. Asshole."
Steve had no idea what to say to that. It was hard to contemplate the idea that he, Steve Rogers, whose attraction to other men had only gone as far as fantasies, who had never come out to anyone in his entire life, could have a healthier attitude toward homosexuality than Tony, who had been kissing another man not three minutes ago, and clearly not for the first time.
Something about the way Tony was looking at him now was too intense, too urgent. Something Tony was going to tell him wasn't what Steve was expecting. Somehow it was worse. He didn't know how it could ever have been worse than that. He set his glass down without breaking eye contact. He was beginning to feel like this was something he should have been sitting down for.
"You seem to be confused," Tony said, dry-voiced, "about who superheroes save. It's not the villains. Them, we turn over to the proper authorities. We make sure justice is done. And that's exactly what I'm going to do. So I'm not going to kill you, and that's the only mercy you're ever going to get from me. It's a hell of a lot more than you ever gave your victims." Tony stared down at him, implacable. "When the cops show up, I'm going to tell them every goddamn crime you've ever committed, and I'm going to hope to God one of them sticks."
"If you don't want to," Steve says, "then of course I don't want you to do anything you don't want to do."
Tony's lips tasted like the salt of his tears. His kiss was awkward, clumsy, desperate, deep, like he'd wanted this kiss since they'd met, like he had years of pent-up feeling that he needed to show Steve in only a span of seconds. Steve didn't need to wonder if Tony loved him, when he'd fallen for him, how long he'd loved him. Tony's body was answering every question. Tony clutched Steve tight, dragging them together like he needed all of Steve touching all of him right now, like Steve alone could pull him back from a cliff's edge.
amount of money. I could have just stayed home, stepped back from my business responsibilities, reduced my stress, hired the best oncologists I could find, and spent all my time trying to eke out a little more time." Tony licks his lips. "But that's-- it's not
Tony covered his face with his hands ever so briefly, then held out a palm in the direction of the photographer, trying to ward him away, even though it was too late. "No comment."
"Luckily for me," Tony said, and it was only that Steve knew him so well that he could tell Tony was scared, beneath the confidence of his tone, "jury verdicts aren't determined by Nielsen ratings."
Jan bites her lip. "I just... had a question," she says. "You don't have to answer it. I was just wondering."
"Shhh." Steve shushes Tony, not because he's noisy but because he needs the reassurance. He smooths his free hand over Tony's quivering side. "Not going to hurt you. I promise, this can't cut you. It's not going to hurt. You're going to be okay. Just hold on, all right?"
Steve knew what he had to say, before this moment slipped away. He took a deep breath. His heart was pounding so heavily that he wondered if even Tony could hear it, in the silence that surrounded them.
"I didn't have to be a superhero," Tony says, precisely, like he's spelling it out. "I'll hazard a guess that being a superhero is not, in fact, a recommended career path for someone with brain cancer. I have an
Steve knows what he has to tell Tony now, even if it's not something he particularly wants to discuss. "But that wasn't what happened tonight. You weren't helpless at all. You did something."
Tony couldn't quite follow Steve's reasoning anymore. It probably wasn't meant to be innuendo, but Tony didn't know what it was actually meant to be. He blamed the severe trauma.
Iron Man coughs. "That's sweet of you, Winghead. Even though I know it's nothing compared to you." He gives Steve's bare arms a significant glance.
Tony's head was tipped back, his hair damp and mussed, his eyes closed, his mouth luridly red, lips parted on a gasp as Tiberius kissed his way down the side of Tony's neck. It was obvious from the little biting bruises on the other side of his neck that this was nowhere near close to their first kiss.
A minute or two later, the bed creaked with Tony's weight. "You can turn back around now," Tony said. The words were clipped, snapped out. He sounded-- God, he
SHIELD gets there in under ten minutes. Tony's got his helmet on again by then, and he hangs back, behind Steve, keeping quiet. Steve is happy to talk to SHIELD; he works with them often enough anyway, and honestly Tony and SHIELD haven't really been on great terms since the last time they tried to make Tony make weapons again, back when Nick was still running it. And that was back when Tony was drinking. It was, in fact, why Tony was drinking. Of course, most of the agents don't know why Iron Man would be taking any of that personally, but SHIELD's ruined Iron Man's life too -- the mess with Tony's technology comes all too readily to mind.
"Come on," Tony says, suddenly breathless. He raises his hand to Steve's face, runs his thumb over Steve's lips, the dimpled corner of his still-smiling mouth, the near-translucent stubble of his jawline. Steve doesn't have much in the way of bare skin, but Tony can work with what he's got. "Come on," he says, again. "Help me out here."
Tony's going to be okay. Steve just barely suppresses a smile. It's a good thing Ghost isn't looking at him. All his attention is focused on the screen.
Tony tucked his face against Steve's neck -- he really liked doing that, didn't he? -- and Steve stroked his back until his breathing evened out. Steve thought maybe it was that Tony could feel a little safer, a little more composed, if he knew no one could see his face, even if it was just Steve. When Tony wasn't being Iron Man, he lived most of his life in the spotlight, and that had to take a hell of a toll on him. Steve could appreciate that sometimes Tony just didn't want to be seen, literally. It was probably a big part of why he liked being Iron Man so much.
. Steve has a bit of a possessive streak. He mostly manages not to give voice to it, but Tony is an adept lover, and he coaxes words out of Steve he thought he'd never say, even in bed. And Tony likes it. So it's all good. It's not hurting anyone.
"Oh, geez," Steve said. "That's rotten." Tony didn't look concussed, though, and that was good. Pupils were the same size, at least. He'd get someone to look Tony over when they got home.
He was across the room in an instant, and Tony took two halting steps forward and collapsed heavily into Steve's embrace, as if he'd run out of strength to hold himself up anymore. That was okay. Steve could be strong enough for both of them right now.
Tony couldn't quite see Mordo from all the way over here, but the light being cast from the far end of the floor was distinctly unnatural, and the crackle of barely-perceptible magical energies was making the hair on the back of Tony's neck stand on end.
-- the only cover anywhere on the floor was back behind the escalators, and those weren't exactly close anymore.
"You-- you don't have to," Tony says, misinterpreting Steve's silence entirely. "It's okay, I just--"
"The username," Tony says, slow and tortured, like the information's being forced out of him, except he's volunteering it, he's volunteering it to save Steve's life, and Steve wishes to God this weren't happening. Tony's never going to be able to forgive himself. "The username," Tony repeats, "is
Oh, he's grateful for the rest of the Avengers -- Ant-Man and the Wasp are able fighters and good teammates, and he's sure glad they have someone like Thor on their side -- but no one compares to Iron Man. Not even any of his old Invaders. They're just... perfectly in sync. Matched.
"I am proud to present a brand-new product from ViaStone," Tiberius continued, smiling brightly. "It's going to change the way you live your life forever! My friends, welcome... to DreamVision!"
Stephen's voice is -- well, it's substantially calmer than his. "I've got something. But you're not going to like it."
? Were you moved? Did you ever change your mind? Or did you stand back and smile while they died? What did you decide they deserved? I want to know. Did you ever spare any of them?"
He shuddered. The armor creaked. Sometimes he wished he remembered that kind of information a little less well. He'd probably have been a happier man.
None of the rest of the team is around, so it's just him and Iron Man in the kitchen as Steve sets two slices of pizza margherita on his plate and Iron Man slurps iced coffee through a straw.
. His eyes were bright as he intently studied the news. His hair fell, curling, over his forehead; Steve's fingers itched to push it back ever so lightly. If Tony let Steve touch him, Steve would be so gentle, so careful. Tony wasn't ever going to let Steve touch him.
Tony's face goes serious. He's focusing in a way he couldn't have, earlier, when it was taking all his energy just to make it through the battle. Now he can actually listen to what Steve is saying without taking every word as some kind of emotional punch.
Tony makes a little choked-off noise, somewhere in his throat. It's almost a laugh. "Happy fucking anniversary," he pronounces, finally. His voice is rough. He sighs, a weary exhalation, but he's smiling now, at last. "Let's not celebrate like this next year, huh?"
Tony sighed again. "He wanted to talk to me about Ty. He told me-- well, everything you said to me. It was Ty. Donahue had been set up. He'd never given that footage of me leaving his building to Ty. He told me that it hadn't even been his footage. He told me that that had actually been one of Ty's cameras. He told me he never hired Radioactive Man. He told me that the battlesuits that had attacked me were his design, but they hadn't been working on his orders. He thought they were probably Ty's. And he said that he suspected Ty had asked me to look into him because he knew he had a shitty reputation. And Ty had wanted to link his shitty reputation to mine. He used to be Ty's mentor, you see. He taught him all the tricks. Taught him to be ruthless. So he knows where the bodies are buried. That might be literal. God, I hope not. But I guess I wouldn't know." Tony snorted. "Anyway, he sounded pretty damn sincere. He'd said he'd hoped Ty's offer of a merger was real, a way to make amends -- but it was pretty clear to him, early on, that it wasn't. He'd recognized his own tricks, I suppose. He said he wanted to take Ty down. But he can't do it all by himself. He's too old. He's dying, apparently."
The screen behind Tiberius changed; now it was outer space, with spaceships and a big space station, shaped like a planet. Some of the ships were shooting lasers. They weren't real spaceships, though. Steve would have recognized at least Kree or Skrull spacecraft, so this had to be fiction. It was one of those Star things Tony liked, wasn't it? Star Trek? No, no, the other one.
So Steve slides in under the covers on the opposite side of the bed, lying on his side. Tony turns to face him, and then promptly slides closer to him. His skin is a little too cool to the touch, but his breath is warm as he leans in and kisses Steve lightly on the lips. It's nice. It's always nice, when it's Tony.
"Shh, it's okay," Tony murmured, as he brushed cool fingers over Steve's cheekbone; he was still chuckling, a little. "God, the blush on you, huh? You're lovely," he whispered, and then he laughed again, delighted. He was
Steve's throat worked. "I know-- I know you're kind, Tony. You're the kindest man I know. But you don't have to say that. Not when it's not true. I know you don't want anything to do with me. Not like this." He swallowed again. "And I know you have no reason to believe me now, but your friendship is more important to me than almost anything else in the entire world. I just hope I can earn it back."
Steve would have put him, conservatively, at about 72 hours awake. That would be what he'd have expected if Tony hadn't slept since before the news story had broken on Wednesday morning, and that looked about right. Steve, unfortunately, had a lot of experience determining exactly how exhausted Tony was at any given moment. It was one of his least favorite professional skills.
Tony licks his lips. "I've never really had a choice before," he says, softly. "Not about this. But if I get a choice, then I pick you."
Unfazed, Stephen just stares at him. He's silent for a few moments, and when he speaks his voice is quieter. "I'll look into it--"
"Easier if you turn over for this part," Steve tells him, and Tony rolls over onto his stomach and slides halfway off the table, until his feet hit the floor, his chest still flat against the table. Steve has a hand on his back, bracing him, holding him firmly in place. If Steve wanted to hold him down, Tony wouldn't be able to stop him.
"Okay," Tony said. "So, the way I see it, I've pretty much got to dispense with the secret identity at this point, don't I?" He said it so casually, as if it weren't one of the most important things about him. He'd kept it for a damn decade until Steve had ruined it all with a kiss.
But maybe it was different in Tony's world. Tiberius had said that when Steve had met him, hadn't he? He'd said Steve wasn't their sort of people. He'd said Steve wasn't like them.
What the hell else should he have said? He didn't want Tony to get hurt. He didn't want to impose his will on Tony. He wasn't going to be another Tiberius. "Tony, of course I--"
The noise Tony made was a hideous, choking sob. "God, I wish it had been a lie. I wish he'd just kept fucking lying to me." Tony's voice was raw. "Steve, he
Iron Man said last night that he wanted Steve to hold him, but this? This sounds like he's been deprived of all physical contact whatsoever. And that's a terrible thought.
"I like to think about you tying me down and working me over," Steve murmured. "Then you fuck me, and when you're done you plug me up so you can keep your come inside me. That's about when I come, usually."
"Thanks so much, Shellhead. I have to run, but I'm clearing you both for the mission now." A keyboard clatters in the background. "There you go. You're both on the board. All the information should be on your cards. Good luck."
"That or the address," Steve agrees. His secret identity has been more of an open secret up until now, but this is all going to be a matter of public record, and there aren't all that many people who share an address with Tony Stark. "The world does know who your housemates are, you know."
, he thought, and it seemed right, in this bright and wondrous moment, to think of Tony as his, because Tony had claimed him too, had said that Steve had taught him strength.
Tony's fingers skimmed over Steve's jawline. "Hey, it's okay," he murmured. "Everything's okay, Winghead." He smiled. "I'm listening. Maurice." He said it right this time. "Rich guy. Secretly gay. Go on."
Tony's smile is heartbreakingly sweet. Obviously hungry for more of Steve's touch, he props himself up with his other arm, trying to get himself closer -- and then his elbow, still coated in slick golden metal, slips out from under him and he crashes back onto the mattress, his hand falling away from Steve's grasp.
"You know," Tiberius added, cheerfully, "I nearly fucked that ex-girlfriend of yours, the one who was at the party last week. What was her name, Rumiko?" He made a show of remembering. "Yes, that was it. I figured it'd really piss you off if I had her. But then you were there, panting after
It takes a few minutes, but eventually the color starts to return to Mr. Stark's face. He's clearly feeling better, as he laughs ruefully and drops the aspirin bottle back in the drawer.
"Not my heart." Iron Man shakes his head. He's laughing again. It's not a pleasant sound. "Except in the emotional sense, I suppose." He sighs. "I'm trying to think of a way to say this that doesn't involve the phrase
"Right," Tony said, and he sat back on his heels and regarded Steve speculatively. "Nothing I can do about the ribs, so I think it's leg time, sweetheart. I'm assuming you would have told me already if it's your femur, so please say it's not."
He didn't finish his sentence, because he'd found Tony. Tony was still on the other side of the room, and somehow Tony was
Sighing, Tony put his gauntlets back on and set to work picking through broken furniture. There, that was one of Monica's uniforms wedged behind his stack of engineering journals. And over there, that had to be one of Steve's boots. It was still all so sad, but thinking about it like a puzzle -- what things belonged to which Avengers? -- made it maybe a little better. People could have some of their stuff back, if they figured this out.
He says it like he thinks that Steve would ever think he was anything but beautiful, that Steve's heart would do anything but soar with joy at the sight of him, no matter what he looks like. He's always going to be handsome to Steve, always going to make him warm with fondness and affection. Isn't that what love is?
People had always stared at Steve. Before the serum, it had been pity, most of the time; he'd been tall and scrawny enough to stand out in a crowd. After the serum, it had been desire, true, but very little of it had been
"Hey!" the guard called again, yelling after him, but he wasn't actually trying to stop Steve anymore, so it didn't matter. Nothing other than Tony mattered. "You go up there, and I'm calling the police!"
"Steve." Tony's voice was slow and shaky, breathy, his speech punctuated by gasps. "S'good. So good to me, sweetheart, oh--"
Steve doesn't usually see the classic thousand-yard stare on Tony. A long, long time ago, he used to think it was because the billionaire playboy Tony Stark had never known that kind of pain, had lived a charmed life, and Steve was glad to think that there was someone in the world -- one of his friends, no less -- who got to be truly happy. He hadn't known anything. He hadn't even known about Tony's heart problem, then, because Tony had kept his shirts buttoned all the way up and never let anyone touch him in any way more intimate than a handshake.
"Your phone?" Steve says, clearly confused. His hand drops as Tony moves away, as Tony stands up to get his own phone out of his pocket.
Tigra had been the one on monitor duty, and for all that she was new to the team, she was actually doing a pretty good job of it.
Jan squinted at him, because she knew this was unlike him. "Uh. Right. So, as I was saying, I don't quite want to get in the middle of whatever's going on with Wanda, Vision, Carol, and Simon."
Steve got his boots and socks off. He didn't bother putting them anywhere organized, and, barefoot, he sat back on the bed. Tony promptly leaned into him like the fifteen seconds they hadn't been touching had been an eternity. That was about how Steve felt too, honestly.
Tony reaches out and fits his hand over Steve's. He's warmer than Steve is. That's rare. It's probably because Steve is still dead.
Tony's face is the picture of skepticism. He waves his hand vaguely in Steve's direction. "Winghead, you could have your pick of anyone in the whole goddamn world."
Steve knew he had to be gentle with Tony, because Tony was afraid. Not of him. Not of what they were doing. That much was obvious. But he was clearly afraid to assert himself. He was a traveler in uncharted land. With no map, he didn't know the boundaries.
Tony wasn't looking at him. His gaze had gone unfocused. "The day I got to boarding school, the very first day, the other boys started calling me a pansy."
He's not entirely sure what he and Tony are to each other right now. Steve had assumed they would talk about it at some point shortly after they'd fallen into bed for the first time, but then Kang invaded Earth again and they were all a little busy. And then they still didn't talk about it. Steve's not sleeping with anyone else and not planning on it; he's pretty sure Tony isn't sleeping with anyone else either. The fact that they love each other isn't news to anyone. They've always loved each other.
Tony shoved his face into Steve's shoulder, as if being able to physically occupy the same space as Steve was the only thing that could possibly make him feel better about any of this. Steve gingerly rubbed Tony's shoulders. His muscles were knotted with tension.
Iron Man's gaze now is sharp, penetrating, incisive, and as Steve stares back at him in horror he has the terrible thought:
Steve's earpiece crackles. Tony's still on the private line. "I'm sorry," Tony gasps, and God, he's definitely crying. "I'm sorry, I can't." Tony's sobbing in earnest now. "I can't. Steve, I'm not-- I--"
He can feel Tony relax. Tension goes out of his muscles. He's limp in his bonds, everything in him focused on Steve's cock, on taking him deep. His mouth is messy, spit-slick, hot and filthy and perfect. Steve's cock slides over Tony's tongue, sliding all the way in, and Tony rises to meet him. He can take everything.
Steve supposed that made some sense. Tony probably felt like he owed him. And it wasn't anything Tony wouldn't have done for any other teammate in need, surely. And Steve would have done it for anyone else too, just the same. That meant it had to be all right.
The explosion was massive, massive enough that Steve could see a flash outside the windows, somewhere out in the park. Tony was floating in midair, his body silhouetted by a tremendously bright light, his half-melted armor reflecting it all, dazzling red and gold.
It's a cruel thing to say, reductive and trivializing, as if the only thing that they ever meant to each other in the past six months was an excuse for French kissing. It's not true. Iron Man means far more than that to Steve, and he knows the reverse is true as well. He knows Mr. Stark --
"In some kind of custody," Steve said, with half a shrug. "Strange came by after it was over and took him, I'm told. I wasn't there for that part."
Steve breathes out, and the last of the tension in him has vanished. Tony knows. Tony knows all his secrets and Tony has him here and he's safe.
"Not the way I see it." Steve glances down and back up. "You want me to stick one on you? You did a good job too, after all."
It wasn't as if any of them were in the right, either. But Steve wasn't about to let himself be distracted from the larger point.
There's silence between them, then, like Mr. Stark is considering and discarding a dozen different things to say.
He felt like he was trying to come out of anesthesia and someone was holding him down in it, metaphorical mask still pressed over his mouth. It was like his awful, treasured memories of drunkenness, but there was nothing good about losing himself here. He couldn't keep track of his brain from one thought to the next.
Steve is beaming at him now. "That'd be swell, thanks!" He looks down at his plate. "Can I get you anything while I'm up?"
The smallest of smiles curves across Mr. Stark's face. "That's very sweet, but there are, in fact, a few other things that matter."
He didn't know if Carol knew what to look for. He didn't know enough about her past to know if she'd had any of the same experiences Tony had had, and he didn't want to think about the kinds of experiences that he knew for a fact that she'd had being relevant. He didn't want Tiberius to be another Marcus. Not that it was up to him. And, of course, he couldn't tell her any of this.
, he knew Tony would do the math, and Tony would figure out when, and he couldn't risk Tony figuring out why. "I'll probably be all better in a few more days."
Steve doesn't know what he's supposed to do. He stands there. He waits. He counts time by the pounding of blood in his head.
"Okay," Steve said, drawing himself up where he sat, and he realized he'd fallen into his mission-briefing voice. "So if we're going back to that
Then Tony's gaze travels very conspicuously down Steve's body, over the disheveled remains of his -- probably designer, Tony bought it for him -- suit, down to the bulge at his groin, because Steve is, of course, once again visibly very hard, and he's a little less patient about it than Tony is. He doesn't like to wait for it, which he always feels a little bad about, but he doesn't feel all that bad, because Tony never, ever minds indulging him.
Tony's report about the situation had been unusually brief, terse almost to a point where it would have been entirely uninformative. He'd sustained some cardiac damage during his final fight with the armor, but he was recovering. He didn't expect any of it to interfere with the performance of his duties. Then Tony had started buttoning up his shirts again.
Steve's stomach lurched. Someone else might have called it freefall, but Steve had jumped out of planes without a parachute. More than once. Freefall would have been easier. At least if he'd really been falling, he would have known how to land.
He could start with something he'd figured out Tony liked, though. He pulled Tony over a little more, so Tony was on top of him now -- because, hell, they'd both liked that, hadn't they? -- and that let him bring his other hand up, stroking down Tony's back. And then, because Tony had liked it before -- and, okay, he'd liked it too -- he slid his hand over Tony's ass. Tony groaned into his mouth and pushed back against his hand, clearly seeking his touch, then rocked against him, rubbing his rapidly-hardening cock against Steve's thigh. Wonder flared bright inside Steve, the thought that he could give Tony pleasure, give him happiness, with just this touch.
And then, as he grew to accept his place in the future, he started to appreciate the library in a different way, as a place with good memories. Good associations. Not all the Avengers liked to read for pleasure, but even the ones who didn't stored books here. Hank's biology texts. Jan's collection of fashion magazines. A well-thumbed shelf of Tony's engineering journals. Most of the other non-fiction -- the histories, the encyclopedia set -- didn't get a lot of use, and it was all old enough that Steve suspected Tony had inherited it.
"Captain!" he says. His voice is pleasant, friendly. "And here I was beginning to worry that I wouldn't be up early enough to catch you."
Steve had never been particularly good at accepting these limitations gracefully, himself, but there were a hell of a lot of more pressing reasons why he wasn't feeling like an especially good person right now.
Iron Man opens the door and takes another step back, putting even more distance between them. "I really do have somewhere to be right now, sorry," he says, and he presses his hand to his chest, an odd gesture. "I promise I'll see you soon."
That was definitely going to come as a surprise, all right. But it wouldn't have come as a surprise to Tiberius. Not that Tony knew that. But it definitely wasn't a good choice. For multiple reasons.
Tony definitely didn't put all these people on his guest lists. But Steve supposed Tiberius Stone was an entirely different man from Tony. The thought was disquieting. How could Tony be friends with someone who liked to pal around with supervillains?
"This is fun," Ghost says, to no one in particular, tartly. Like he wants them to move faster. And, well, he's the one with a gun to Steve's head, so what he says goes.
, which is to say that Tony is completely naked, lying on the bed, and tied up with about a hundred feet of rope.
"You really don't have to tell me if you don't want to." He realized that sounded bad. "I mean, if you want to, sure, of course you can tell me. But you don't need to put yourself through this for me, okay?"
Steve feels himself start to cry again. It feels like all his armor is gone, everything protecting him. Tony could run his hands over Steve's skin and touch his soul.
Tony took it, but his face fell. "I suppose that's fair," he said. "I mean, you know exactly where I've been. And I sure don't know where
"Okay," Tony said slowly, like he'd had to contemplate the word for a while. He sounded... exhausted, honestly.
Mr. Stark must have told him. He must have told him what Steve's planning. No other explanation is possible. There's something aching and hollow in Steve's chest.
"Mmm." Iron Man sounds happier now. This is good. "Okay, then." He rests his hand on Steve's shoulder. "Make yourself at home. Do you want me to get you a pillow?"
"Okay," Steve says, softly. "Okay. I've got you. I'll help you. You're doing so good, okay? Everything's fine." Tony brightens, and Steve knows this is what Tony needs. He clears his throat, tries to get himself under control. He needs to not be angry or -- Jesus -- horny. He needs to think. "You stay right there. I'll get the scissors."
Hercules was technically a possibility, but not really a good bet. He was definitely strong, anyway, so the gear might have fit him. But Tony kind of suspected that if Herc had any kind of inclinations toward kink it wouldn't be modern BDSM as anyone understood it. Whoever owned this box clearly knew some people in the scene, knew enough to know where to go to get good equipment, and definitely took it seriously. Herc didn't strike Tony as the "safe, sane, and consensual" type. Not to mention that Tony had never really thought Herc had that kind of interest in him, specifically.
The video switched, now showing a file photo of Whiplash in what Steve had always thought of as a rather daring costume that was definitely inappropriate for television. It was side by side with one of the Avengers' promotional photographs, Tony posing in his latest armor, eyes barely visible behind the mask. Of course, nobody who was watching this except the two of them knew it was Tony in the Iron Man armor. Steve didn't think that that information was going to exonerate Tony. It would probably make him look worse.
He knew he didn't deserve it, but it was the only thing he wanted. The last thing he wanted. A dying man's last wish.
"I do," Steve said. "And I'm absolutely willing to give it a try. I've wanted you for a long time. It's going to be good. I know it."
Steve came of age in a war. He learned not to waste time. He learned not to wait around. If you're serious, if you have something good, you let your partner know how you feel. And he can't imagine anyone better than Iron Man.
There's a rattling, echoing laugh. "But I'm not like you." Iron Man pronounces this as if it's a settled fact, a law of the universe. "You're good and kind and honest and I'm-- I'm-- I'm a man in a mask. And some days I don't think you'd much like the man underneath it."
In what Steve has come to recognize as the equivalent of a rueful smile, Iron Man tilts his head. "I'm not saying this because I want you to feel sorry for me," he adds. "I just wanted to explain the situation. It is what it is. I'm alive. I'm grateful."
"Of course, Trish," the in-studio host said, "the question on everyone's minds right now is obvious. Could this be a plot cooked up by Tony Stark and Iron Man to seek revenge against Tiberius Stone for the story implicating both of them in Mark Scarlotti's death?"
He found his phone in his belt pouch and winced as he opened it. It was ten to noon, and there were six unread text messages, all from Jan, all probably expressing increasing amounts of concern. Considering that the last thing Jan had probably heard about him was that the police were being called on him at ViaStone HQ last night, Steve could understand where the concern had been coming from. He should have checked in, and in most circumstances he certainly would have, but last night had been very far from ordinary.
"So from where I am," Steve concluded, "it's actually an immense relief to discover I only have feelings for one man. I meant it when I said it was the best surprise. I meant everything I said."
. One meeting didn't prove a damn thing. Steve knew that. Tony should have known that. Tiberius definitely should have known that. It was all rumors. It was a manufactured story.
He should have made the bed. Changed the sheets, probably. They were fairly clean, he thought, but it was the principle of the thing. On the other hand, Tony was probably tired enough that he could pass out on any flat surface, and it wasn't like Tony was going to consider the state of his sheets a dealbreaker.
Steve's grin was a positively lascivious flash of teeth, and he tossed the tube of Vaseline on the bed, then followed it up with walking over there himself. He went over to the box and wrenched it all the way open, with a screech of metal. The blindfold went in the box first, then the nipple clamps, and then the cock ring. Then he turned to Tony and held up the gag.
"No one told me I shouldn't read their messages," Steve says, defensively. He still feels like an idiot. But it's better than Iron Man feeling miserable, so it's a fair trade.
"Really," Steve said. "I mean, I don't keep them for their artistic value, obviously" -- and, yep, he was blushing again -- "but they're absolutely under there."
won't make it out of here without breaking down again. Just trust me when I say I know how to reverse a negator, okay?"
Steve shakes his head. "None of the above." He shifts from foot to foot. He shoves half his hand into one of his belt pouches and then takes it out again. His stomach is in knots. "You said-- when I saw you last week, you told me that if I ever wanted to talk to you, I could. Did you mean that?"
But her eyes narrowed, behind the domino mask, and he knew he'd slipped. Carol's voice went softer, low with concern. "Are you all right there?"
," Tony said, quiet again, pained. "Believe me, I wish I knew how it had happened. I was the picture of health after Onslaught. Had a full workup. And I know it wasn't just me who was better. We all know Clint got his hearing back." Tony exhaled. "Maybe he ought to get his ears checked."
Steve doesn't understand. Why is Iron Man wearing this? He doesn't know what to say, other than that it's oddly adorable, which is not the reaction he thinks Iron Man wants him to have.
Tony grinned again. "Oh," he said. "There's nothing going on with me." His mouth quivered. "Might just go right to sleep. Definitely going to sleep. Any second now. There's sure nothing happening that would make that difficult."
"Hey, no," Tony said, softly, holding him tighter. "Steve, it's not--" He sighed. "I'd tell you it doesn't matter to me, because it sure as hell doesn't, but if it matters to you, then it matters, doesn't it?"
Tony could just barely see the shield glinting in the dark, and he could only see Steve if he switched to night vision. Steve could probably see him anyway.
"Anyway," Steve said, tracing the shape of his hand with one inquisitive fingertip, "Thor took your armor away, so no one else would find out who you were. He got it all out of the way before the paramedics came and then took it back to the mansion. I, uh, didn't really manage to come up with the best cover story; I ended up telling them that you'd been out shopping, missed the evacuation, decided to wait for your bodyguard, and then got caught in the crossfire. And then, since your actual bodyguard couldn't be here, Thor and I have been taking turns at your bedside. Mostly me, though." He grimaced. "It doesn't make you sound very good. I know. I'm sorry."
Steve takes a deep breath. He can do this. He can definitely do this. It's only a question. Heck, it's a question that Mr. Stark doesn't even need to say yes to. But it would sure be nice if he did.
There's also a coiled extension cord, and these days Tony probably really does need it. His heart is -- well, his heart's not what it used to be, but in another sense, his heart's a whole lot like what it used to be.
Steve opens the door and steps inside. The workshop is just as chaotic as it was the last time Steve was here. Mr. Stark's sitting on a stool on the other side of the closest bench to the door, facing Steve. He has a soldering iron in one hand and a circuit board spread out in front of him. If not for that one morning Steve had caught him at breakfast in a sweatshirt, he might have believed that Mr. Stark didn't own anything that wasn't a business suit, but here he is, once again dressed down. Mr. Stark's wearing blue jeans and that same old, worn MIT sweatshirt, as well as a pair of thick, heavy plastic safety glasses. His hair is sticking up. It's the least put-together Steve has ever seen him. It should be ugly, but somehow even like this, he's still charming. He looks like-- well, honestly, he looks like an engineer. He
Maybe he should have gone for the Village Voice personals after all. But he knew he couldn't have. That wasn't him. This was him.
It can't be a good thing that Iron Man's expectations are so low, but Steve smiles up at him anyway. "Nowhere else I'd rather be," he says, softly, and once he's sat up he takes Iron Man's hand and presses a kiss to his fingers. "But I think now I ought to go," he says, reluctantly standing. "I'd hate for Mr. Stark to interrupt us."
A muscle in Steve's jaw twitched. "Yes, you can," he said, and if anyone in the universe was stubborn enough to try to argue with Death herself it was Steve Rogers. "You can," he repeated. "You can and you're going to."
"If you insist," Stephen says, relenting. "I suppose I'll go tell the rest of the club about this little reversal. Wouldn't want any unpleasant surprises, after all."
"I don't know," Steve returned, grinning, deliberately misinterpreting him a little, because he knew Tony was talking about his most recent revelation, "you're the fella who's been redesigning my uniform for years. You have all my measurements. How surprised can you be, really?"
Tony's eyes had gone dark with desire. "Oh, don't you dare apologize. That's perfect. You can absolutely do that."
to the one he would have if Iron Man were a robot, is the thing. He can't exactly touch Iron Man, and Iron Man can't exactly do things like eat regular meals with other people around, as far as Steve can tell. So he can't very well invite Iron Man out to an evening of dinner and dancing, like he could if Iron Man were a regular man.
"Well." Mr. Stark's smile is once again tinged with sadness. "I guess we'll see about that, won't we?"
"That's life as a celebrity, Cap." Iron Man sighs. "People think they're entitled to all the juicy details."
Steve has also clearly already had some experience with magic, because this doesn't even faze him. "That'd be swell," he says, with another smile. "Right now?"
"Hey, Cap," Tony murmured. "What's up? You look like you're having second thoughts." He paused. "You don't have to do this, you know. I bet Jarvis and Herc and Dane wouldn't mind a hospital visit. We can clean everything up without you."
Steve stood up straighter and swallowed hard, swallowed past the sudden lump in his throat. "I'll just go," he said, tightly. "I'm sorry I-- I'm really sorry I interrupted you. I'll see you later, Tony."
God. He'd really kissed Tony. He'd done it. So many years of imagining it, and he'd finally done it.
"And I'm sure you'll do a great job." Tony signs the bottom of the form with a flourish and then passes it over, along with the pen. "Your autograph, please."
But he still knew the truth, even if no one else did. And it mattered that he'd tried. Even if it wasn't going to change anyone's mind, it was important that he'd done it.
He can't bring himself to open his eyes. He waits in silence, in darkness. And then there's a point of warmth on the back of Steve's hand.
, and then you put on, what, easily a hundred pounds of armor, and you ran up two flights of stairs--"
Tony looked nowhere near as distressed about it as Steve felt. "Oh, probably. I don't remember that specific moment. He kept trying an awful lot," he said, as Steve stared at him, aghast. "What's the big deal? It's not the worst thing that's ever happened to me. And I stopped him, so it's not like he actually did it, either."
He just doesn't want anyone to get hurt, and he knows he already hurt Mr. Stark. And he certainly doesn't want to compound that by kicking him when he's down, so to speak.
Steve can't say he's not tempted, but-- "It's not that you don't want me to, uh, touch you, right? If it could happen, you'd want that?"
Steve sits down on the edge of the bed. His head is in his hands. Tony wants to sit next to him. Tony wants to put his arm around him. But Steve doesn't know him. And if Steve remembered him, he sure as hell wouldn't want him to anymore.
Steve finally looked up at him, a determined, defiant stare, like he was facing down a firing squad of his own making. His jaw clenched. His throat worked. "You know the box that Thor found today?"
They'd never talked about this. They didn't talk about things like this. They didn't draw attention to them. They couldn't. They couldn't talk about what any of it really meant. It ran too close to everything Steve couldn't say.
Tony supposed that an arranged marriage definitely had some things going for it over the one he'd picked out for himself. Such as more stringent background checks.
This time Steve's entire body shuddered and his cock jerked, and Tony wasn't even touching him. Yeah, he liked that. "Please," he said again.
This was the sort of thing that people got help doing, Steve knew. Other people brought their biggest, strongest, scariest friends with them when they confronted their abusers. Steve knew he was nowhere near Tony's biggest or strongest friend, but he was more than strong enough to face down any baseline human. And he could definitely manage
"Okay," Tony echoes. He sounds breathy. Uncertain. But they have to do this anyway, and they don't really have the time to spare.
Tony would probably like that, wouldn't he? It wouldn't be the best blowjob Tony had ever had in his life, no -- Steve harbored no illusions that his own abilities would currently live up to his own fantasies -- but surely Tony would enjoy it.
Oh. This was how they were going to play it. They were going to say that Tony had hired Radioactive Man because he was upset that Tiberius had broken the story.
"I had a lot of reasons," Tony said. His voice was hoarse, rasping, dismal. "Don't know if any of them were any good, really, but I thought they were. I figured it wasn't ever going to come up. It's not like I've been with-- with a lot of men." Steve wasn't sure what Tony's definition of
Tony's got his full weight on Steve and is showing no signs of letting up any time soon; it looks like he's still not in great shape as far as even walking goes. Steve can be someone to lean on, if that's what Tony needs from him.
Iron Man shakes his head and sighs. "People just look at me and assume I'm... the kind of guy who'd never want kids, you know? They don't think they need to ask, because they're sure they already know the answer."
Iron Man looks away for a few seconds, like he's trying to figure out what to say, and then back at him. "You're very kind," he says, gently. "You're the kindest man I've ever known. No one's ever offered me anything like that before. I'm touched, I really am. But... I'm okay. I'm doing just fine. I don't need money."
"Thank you," Tony says, softly. He takes a hesitant step in Steve's direction. "So, maybe you want to try the kissing part again?"
Tony knows that date, all right: the day Steve went into the ice. Oh, God. He asked Tony where Bucky was. He asked how they got him out of the water. Falling from that plane is the last thing Steve remembers.
Tony's other hand settled on Steve's shoulder, his grip lightly bracketing the base of Steve's neck, and, oh, yes, that was exactly right. That was what he'd needed. Tony was right here with him, as much as he could have.
Tony rose up out of Steve's lap, kneeling over him now, momentarily a little too high up for Steve to kiss him again. He was steadying himself against Steve, hands on his shoulders. For a few seconds he didn't know what Tony was doing and he was embarrassed by his own ignorance. This was why he'd never said anything. He didn't know how to do this. He didn't know enough for Tony.
Tony laughed, but at least he was smiling. "Honestly, I don't think you're physically capable of lying to me. And I'm sure sometimes you'd probably like to be."
Behind the mask, Iron Man's eyes are wide and earnest. He squeezes Steve's hand. His fingers are gentle. Steve's not sure he'll ever be able to see Iron Man in full armor without wishing for this again, and he hates the thought.
Tony tosses the negator away like it's garbage, and then Tony's gauntleted hands gently settle on Steve's head, moving lightly over his scalp. Checking for sore spots.
Tony shrugged, as much of a shrug as he could ever manage in armor. "One of Doctor Strange's friends."
"Well," Steve said, smiling again, and there was something smooth and dark and sultry in his voice, a rush better than the kick of liquor in Tony's lonely soul. "Heaven forfend you not get exactly what you want, hmm?"
Steve actually, literally, feels his heart skip a beat. And if his heart's beating already, that's... well, that's a big problem.
Steve runs, following the path of Iron Man's trajectory, even as he knows he can't do anything to help. It's not like he can catch him. Even Steve would be flattened if he tried.
"I think they will be," Tony told him, sleepily, and he'd drifted off. Steve could feel him smiling.
Tony still didn't talk when the kettle started whistling, or when Steve hopped down from the counter, put a tea bag in each cup, poured the water, and waited for the tea to steep. A few minutes later, he removed the bags, and carried the mugs, one in each hand, back to the living room. That was when Tony at least raised his head.
Thor brightened, and then he strode across the creaking floor to deposit the box and the crop in front of Tony. "No apologies are necessary! I am gladdened that I have so easily found the rightful owner of these effects."
"Maybe," he mumbles. He's never told Tony that he loves him. He's never figured out how. This honestly wasn't how he was picturing saying it. But he's not sure he'll ever have another chance. He steels himself and looks up. "Yeah," he says, gamely. "Yes. Because I love you."
No, Steve tells himself, and he straightens up. He can't think like that. It's not wrong and it's not going to be wrong and he needs to stand by his beliefs. He can be brave for this. It's important.
Everything in him twists in knots as he reaches up to silence the earpiece he's wearing. He knows it's the right thing to do, but he feels like he's betraying Tony. He promised Tony he'd be here for him.
If Iron Man hadn't existed, Steve would have said yes to Mr. Stark. In a heartbeat. But he doesn't think knowing that will make Mr. Stark feel any better.
He liked it. That probably shouldn't have surprised him, but it did. He'd thought he was going to like it, but he'd thought he was going to like it more because of what it meant, because it would mean finally acting on a lifetime of desire, because it would mean pleasing Tony. He hadn't thought he'd like the act for its own sake, too.
he was a bastard, if that makes any sense." His breath rattled, a tiny little laugh. "Steve, you're-- you're the best man I've ever known. And the thing about you is that you believe the world of me. You'll back me. So I felt like I couldn't trust what you said because you were always going to believe that I was good, that what had happened hadn't been my fault. And because of that, I thought that if it really had been my fault, if I'd done something wrong, you wouldn't have told me so, because you wouldn't have believed it. You weren't... unbiased. But this guy had no reason to care about me. He had no reason to want anything good for me. He wasn't going to stand up for me. And he was saying the exact same things that you had said, about Ty." Tony blew out a breath. "And that was when I thought that there might be something to it. That it wasn't just you telling me I didn't deserve the news media raking me over the coals for every mistake I've ever made. That you hadn't constructed a convoluted explanation in your mind just to try to redeem me. That probably doesn't make sense, does it?"
Tony smiled. "Same for me," he said. "About everything. Including the current amount of wanting." Steve thought that was quite possibly the most wonderful thing he'd ever heard. But Tony's smile was slowly fading. "I just-- I keep finding it hard to believe, you know? Not in the
"Sort of reminds you of the old days, doesn't it?" Jan asked. "I mean, here we all are, the founding Avengers..."
And this time Tony caught him at it, because he clapped his free hand over the fresh mark on his collarbone like he wanted to hide it, which was when Steve also realized that he knew exactly what was going through Tony's head.
"You can't think like that." Steve's throat was tight. "There's someone out there for you, Tony. There
The hand that had been covering Steve's slid up a little, gently splaying over Steve's quivering abdominal muscles. It felt nice. Soothing. Steve let his own hand fall away.
Tony spared a precious few seconds to take in the rest of the floor and update the tactical situation. It wasn't looking good; in fact, it was looking significantly worse. Other than trapping themselves in one of the side rooms ordinarily used for pictures with Santa -- which was a bad option for several reasons mostly summed up by the use of the verb
Steve wasn't going to hit someone who couldn't hit back. He'd never been a bully and he wasn't going to be one and he wasn't going to hit a man who couldn't move, even if it was Tiberius. But, God, he wanted to. His fingers twitched and tensed on his shield.
After that, time starts to blur a little. Steve works his way over Tony's back again, with light taps, and then once more with his fingers, increasing the pressure as he goes, and Tony just lies there and... relaxes. By the time Steve's once again at the dip of Tony's lower back, Tony's flung his arms out to the sides, limp, and pressed his face into the pillow. Every so often he makes a soft little noise. He's still awake, Steve is sure. He's just completely sprawled out, his body putting up no resistance whatsoever. Good. Just how Steve wants him.
He had to tell Steve who he was. He had to. He probably only had a few more minutes left, but Steve had to know. Just one last thing. And then he could go.
"Guessing you like it gentle, huh?" Tony asked. "Didn't know a guy could get this wet. Also guessing you don't, uh, need much in the way of lube," he added, and Steve's cock twitched in Tony's hand.
, Christ -- Tony knew Steve well enough to suspect that Steve might want to be, now. That his opinion would change if he were with someone. That if there was anyone in the world worth being out for, to Steve, it would be Tony.
They kissed, again and again. And even if Luck wasn't a stat, Steve was sure that there was no one in the world luckier than him.
He goes down to his workshop. He needs privacy above all, and right now Steve won't know how to find him here. Good.
His left fist hit first, off-center and at a bad angle, scraping from collarbone to shoulder, with a wetness that probably meant he'd split his knuckles. His right fist was worse, smashing into her other shoulder at an angle that was even more off, connecting with the wrong part of his hand. And with all his strength behind it, the result was predictable, as his fist kept moving, fingers folding in a way that they really weren't meant to. There was a terrible crunching sensation somewhere in his hand.
Tony doesn't even know where to start. "I know a lot of things," Tony says. "And I'm not a Nazi. I promise. You're in New York. And Bucky's-- Bucky's fine, okay?" He doesn't actually know where Bucky is right now. Probably out on his own doing something covert. Maybe Natasha knows. "My name's Tony. I'm-- I'm a friend."
He got in a couple more hits, and Carol staggered backwards. Nothing Steve could do to her could actually hurt her, but if he was fast enough he might be able to get her off-balance enough to hit the mat, because she was still lighter than he was. Weight was pretty much the only thing he had going for him.
The popcorn is done; Steve can hear it rattling into the bowl. Iron Man picks up the bowl, and Steve can see the metal of his helmet glint as he turns around. Steve loses sight of him again as he weaves his way through the maze of machines and armor, but of course Steve can still hear his footsteps as he walks--
"I don't have proof," Steve admitted, "but I'm going to be very, very surprised if it turns out he didn't hire Radioactive Man to murder that news crew. Meaning that someone can definitely lean on Chen Lu. Who, incidentally, tried to kill
Steve could only hope that the deaths of the SNN crew had been accidental. But he was no longer willing to assume that they had been.
He needed to stop feeling sorry for himself. Christ. He was going to heal up in inside of a week instead of in a couple of months like anybody else would, and here he was complaining about it because it hurt a little.
As he took stock of the various exits, trying to figure out where he should go next, he realized that the suite was, in very subtle ways, nothing like what Tony would ever have designed. It was an eerie mismatch, just close enough to be noticeable, but it was throwing him off. His skin crawled.
Tony moans in unfeigned rapture as his mouth glides over Steve's cock and it's easy, so easy, for Steve to slide all the way into that wet heat. Tony's eyes flutter shut, and with his mouth nearing the base of Steve's cock he looks positively blissful. Steve's cock sliding into in Tony's mouth is a hell of a view, better than any pornography he's ever seen. He wishes he could take a picture, but he knows better than to have evidence of this. They're too famous. He has his memory, though, and that's almost as good.
Tony winced. "Always have to outdo the rest of us, huh, Winghead? Really going that extra mile." But the rebuke was soft, and Tony was frowning contemplatively at Steve's hand, rubbing soothing little circles into Steve's palm with his thumb. Steve could only feel it intermittently, at the edge of the splint. It felt... really nice.
That's not just permission -- that's encouragement. And that's also Tony, once again, telling him it's perfectly fine to enjoy himself. That Tony wants him to. Now Steve's the one who needs to hear it again, he supposes. It's good to hear.
"You're not required to--" Steve begins, weakly, but Tony's hand is sliding down his stomach and it's hard to think about anything that isn't the precise location of Tony's hand at this moment. Steve's world is a few square inches in size.
"You can put the helmet wherever you like," Steve told him, as he hung his coat up, then reached over and tugged off the fabric covering the shield. The apartment had unusually good soundproofing -- given Steve's day job, he'd made sure to find a place that did -- but he kept his voice pitched low anyway, for Tony's sake. He needed to be calm for Tony. "You can hang onto the shield if you want. If it's helping you. I don't mind." He tried a smile.
Tony starts talking, and he's giving it all away. "Lowercase E." The keyboard clicks, metal on metal. At least it's probably a secure password, Steve thinks. But that sure doesn't matter when you're giving it up at gunpoint, does it? Steve doesn't bother opening his eyes. "Capital G." Another click. "The number one." Click. "At sign." Click. "The number zero." Click. "Lowercase D." Click. "Capital E." Click. Tony pauses.
This was getting confusing. "But the Sentient Armor wasn't her, right?" Steve asked. He'd been pretty sure about that. Then he had a horrible thought. "Please,
. As in Mark Antony. There was a whole history there, likely years of friendship, stories Steve wasn't privy to. There was no reason to be jealous of that, Steve told himself. Tony nicknamed all his friends. Steve knew that. Tony had nicknamed him, too. There was no call for Steve to be envious, he repeated to himself; Tony wasn't doing anything for this fella that he didn't do for everyone else.
The call disconnects. A few seconds later, Tony smells sulfur, and then Stephen's standing next to him, with his Cloak and his Eye and his stupid red-and-black footie pajamas.
While he'd been parrying verbally, one of Carol's jabs had gotten in past his guard, slamming into his ribs, and he couldn't breathe for half a second. She was pulling her punches, of course, but even so she was still pretty damn strong. It hurt. But that was good, in a way. It gave him a focus. He understood pain. He could handle pain.
For a few seconds it seemed like Tiberius hadn't heard. His face didn't change. But then his smile grew wider.
"And you're your own bodyguard," Steve concludes. "And no one notices." The words taste sour. "I sure didn't."
Regardless, Steve's certainly not going to tell Iron Man either, not if Mr. Stark hasn't. It wouldn't bring anything good. And the last thing he wants to do is hurt the man he loves, especially now that he knows he loves him.
Because Tony is Tony, always in motion, he's across the room and over at the office area before it occurs to Steve that he could follow. Tony doesn't have much there: there's a huge, plush chair, and an even bigger desk, the majority of it covered in those holographic screens Tony likes. There's a laptop, pushed to one side, and a very small pile of actual papers. Ever the futurist, Tony is a big believer in the paperless office.
Tony was still talking. "I was thinking about what you said this afternoon, in the library." Had that really been today? It seemed like a lifetime ago. "You said you'd never seen anyone hurt me the way Ty had hurt me. And that... actually wasn't right." His mouth twisted. "I mean, the part where you've never seen it is true. I suppose you never did see it. But this isn't the first time someone's done this to me. It isn't even the second. It's actually the third."
Retreating, he headed over, rounded the kitchen counter, opened the refrigerator, and he was in the middle of bemoaning his current lack of perishables when he realized Tony hadn't answered him. The silence coming from Tony's corner of the living room felt somehow oppressive.
"So," he says, softly, as softly as he can, because he sure doesn't need the rest of the team overhearing this, "if you're not a gentleman, Shellhead, would you like to come inside with me?"
Tony laughed again. The sound was ugly. "She hardly had to do anything more than compliment me," he said, and that wasn't exactly what Steve had meant. "She told me how clever I was. And I fell all over myself to show her how goddamn smart I was. I'd done some work at SI. I was happy to access the security systems. Show her the prototypes. Do anything to get her to tell me she loved me." He breathed out, noisy and ragged. "Then there was a break-in at SI. A team of masked men stole a good half-dozen of our designs. Then Sunset left me, of course. And then, wouldn't you know it, she founded Baintronics a few months later, with some very familiar designs. So that was when I came clean. Told my father what I'd done. He--" Tony cut himself off and finally looked at Steve. His eyes were wide and nervous. "I don't think you actually want to know this part."
They kissed, again and again. Steve let his fingers trace the line of Tony's spine, down and up and down again, and Tony relaxed slowly against him, everything in him at ease now. His lips were sweet and slack, and he hummed, pleased, as Steve licked into his mouth. If he wanted Steve to take the lead now, Steve was more than happy to. He could take care of Tony like this, the way he'd always wanted to. He'd had a lot of fantasies that started like this. Not all of them were about sex, even; some of them were just about putting Tony to bed and holding him while he fell asleep. But many of them involved giving Tony a very thorough blowjob first.
Steve opened his eyes. "What's the problem, then?" He knew what the problem was too -- did he ever -- but Tony had said that like he also had the solution. Steve was very interested in that.
The workshop door is closed, and Steve can hear the faint strains of music on the other side. Mr. Stark said it was all right, Steve tells himself. Mr. Stark said he could come by anytime if he wanted to talk.
Steve glanced back at the muted television. He knew what he'd seen in the corner of the screen, but he was hoping against hope that it said something different. It didn't. The entire screen was now, in fact, displaying the station's logo as they cut to commercial. SNN. Stone News Network.
And he had a problem to solve here: he had to figure out who the box really belonged to. Not everyone who resided in the mansion had been in the room when Thor had found the box, so if they hadn't been there, it was Tony's duty to figure out who they were. And if they had been there... well, then they hadn't come forward, and it was Tony's duty to return it to them anyway. He could be discreet. Subtle. It would be the kind thing to do. He could determine who really owned the box and then privately hand it back. No one else would have to know.
Tony strides across the room, sets his helmet down on Steve's nightstand with a resounding clank, and then sits on the edge of Steve's bed. The frame creaks alarmingly in protest, but it holds Tony's armored weight as he stretches out on his back atop the duvet, boots and all.
Steve nods once and steps in close. He hikes Tony's leg a little higher, and it's not the most comfortable position Tony's ever been in but also Tony is pretty sure this is going to be over fast. Steve's hands are on Tony's thighs, pushing him open a little more, arranging him exactly how he likes, and Tony has about three seconds to ponder just how good this is going to be, and then Steve slides inside him, slamming home in one deep thrust.
"Ty was there for me," Tony spat out. "He invited me over to his place so I-- so I didn't have to be alone. He helped me. He cares about me. He
"Hey, no," he said, a little sharper than he meant to, and Tony tensed under his hands. "Sorry, not you. Him. You don't know he's not going to prison. No, you don't," he said, as Tony opened his mouth to protest, exhaling warmth at the base of Steve's throat. "Sure, I know he's rich. And I know not everything can stick. But he's killed a lot of people, and he didn't do his own wetwork."
Tony's orgasm blindsides him. He hasn't come untouched in years, but that's exactly what he does as Steve pounds into him. The pleasure crests, breaks, and Tony is gasping, shuddering in Steve's arms. He thinks he might be saying Steve's name. He's dimly aware that he's making an incredible mess of himself; coming in spurts all over his stomach, up to his chest.
For about five seconds, Tony was convinced he'd made a mistake. The scales of Steve's shirt dug into his palm and Steve's surprised breath was hot against his mouth. Steve's body was tense. But then it was like a switch flipped within Steve, the current flowing the right way, and Steve just melted in Tony's arms. His mouth opened under Tony's, urging Tony on, encouraging Tony to just take what he wanted because it was what he wanted as well.
With Iron Man, the days seem to fly by. And the weeks. And even the months. Steve wakes up one morning and realizes it's been just over five months since the two of them started dating. He lies in bed, stares up at the ceiling, and allows himself to ponder this.
Tony tips the faceplate up again and he's smiling, albeit weakly. "You've got the best ideas. Good thing you're here."
And then Iron Man pulls away, and Steve's hands fall through empty air. Steve nearly opens his eyes but remembers just in time. He hears another hissing click. That's probably the helmet.
Tiberius had Tony backed up against the kitchen island, one knee pressed between Tony's thighs. Tony's jeans were undone, threatening to slide off his hips, exposing a large amount of gorgeously bare skin and a glimpse of skimpy, satiny underwear that Steve had no right to see. Tiberius had an arm wrapped around Tony's back, holding him close. His other hand was at Tony's waist, starting to slide up and under the bottom edge of Tony's t-shirt; one of Tony's hands was encircling Tiberius' wrist, undoubtedly caressing him, surely urging him on.
"That's SHIELD," Steve added, helpfully. "You know, the people who get involved when you go after superheroes. Like us. And you can't buy them off."
Maybe it was silly to enjoy holding Tony's hand this much; it was a pleasure adults were supposed to outgrow. But Steve had never been one for letting the rest of the world tell him what to do, and at any rate it sounded like Tony had been deprived of a lot of the usual things that other people got to enjoy in relationships.
Steve nodded. "It has a happy ending. For sure." And then he paused, trying to bring the rest of the plot to mind. And then he remembered the rest of the plot, and he covered his face with his free hand to muffle his laughter. "Oh, God. This is embarrassing."
He sinks to his knees and feels an immediate and overwhelming sense of relief as Tony smiles encouragingly at him. All he has to do is what Tony says. Tony wants him to do this. For as long as the scene lasts, his life is blessedly, perfectly simple.
Steve knew a cue when he saw one. He stepped forward. "Tony has my support. Tony has always had my support. And if Tony wants to be the first Avenger to come out -- well, then he'll still have my support. And I'm confident that the rest of the team will stand by him." He smiled.
Tony clenched and unclenched his fists. His face had gone a sickly yellow-white. "I don't think you want to say another word about my father right now."
He was dimly aware of grabbing Tony's shoulder tighter, of trying to bear down on Tony's finger like he could get him inside him if he just pushed, the sensation sending sparks of pleasure through him as he came and came and came. And because Tony didn't have to worry about swallowing, he just kept licking and sucking, the strokes of his hand gentling as he went. Steve was oversensitive, but he liked it like this, shuddering and shaking through the last of it until the last bit of pleasure was wrung out of him; too much was exactly what he wanted. Hell, it could probably get him there again if Tony would just keep going. But eventually Tony lifted his head.
