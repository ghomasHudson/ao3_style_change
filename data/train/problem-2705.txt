It’s not unlike her to not seek John’s touch, but today... today hurts. John can’t blame her, he’s tense as hell. Toddlers and moods. They are picking them up as quickly as juicy gossip explodes in the media.
“Here, I mean.” He clears his throat. “You’ll be here?”
Sherlock’s gaze pauses on a small, Black family. Mother, father, and little one. The father laughs as he throws his giggling son into the air and catches him again safely and spins him around. The mother tuts, but her eyes are kind and warm as she looks at them. The father stops and the little one reaches grabby hands to be held by his mother, who nuzzles their noses together and cradles him close, a palm at the back of his head as the boy hides his face in her neck, back still rising and falling rapidly with excitement. The father, a look of content pride in his eyes, leans close, but instead of a kiss to the lips, he gives his wife a playful peck on her button nose that immediately scrunches up, ticklish.
When there’s no response, John turns the knob, slow and careful; Sherlock’s door tends to creak badly sometimes. The curtains are drawn but John thinks they have been since yesterday so Sherlock must have simply not closed them last night. Grey light illuminates the jumbled covers and John can make out Sherlock’s curled up body under them, turned away from the door, only a lock of hair peeking from the edge of his duvet. He never quite understood how Sherlock could make himself seem so small. It is endearing and adorable and he’s… he’s just so… tiny. Like a child. Waves of protectiveness wash over John, just like they always did, but now he understands them better. His deeper, gentler feelings. He’s a father after all, there’s only so much a repressed soul can avoid and lock away. Not that it would ever matter if he showed this side of him to Sherlock. John can imagine his incredulous face if he ever tried to cuddle him, kiss his curls, maybe feel his warm sleepy skin… No. Yes. That would be ridiculous. He can see the small frown, indicating Sherlock is thinking of how to let him down easy. Still, the sight is just-
Somewhere downstairs, water starts to run. Sherlock going for a shower probably. John’s smile is slow as he starts humming with her. He takes the small, child-safe hairbrush from the bedside table, slowly combs it through her tangled curls. She doesn’t even object. She’s just humming, looking at the point her fingers are clutching at his chest. The teeth press between curly locks and separate small knots of sweat from the last two days. They’ve been thorough with cleaning her up and keeping her healthy, but they couldn’t risk a bath with the fever and the chilly weather outside, making the inside more difficult to warm up too. They’ll be certainly giving her one tomorrow. In the meantime…
The easy smile disappears from John’s face and he turns to see the plaque declaring the building’s address beside them on the sidewalk. The world becomes grey.
Albedo: The amount of solar energy that gets reflected from a surface.
“So, you… you go first, right? I-”
Curiously, he steps into the kitchen, bare feet cold against the tiled floor. The sink is stacked with bowls, utensils, and a small pan, and the table is, for once, not empty; pancakes are served on a messy heap on a white plate, with the honey jar is placed nearby. There is a steaming cup of chamomile, and one with now cold milk. Sherlock blinks, eyeing the arrangement suspiciously. The possible explanations wash to his mind’s forefront like waves lapping insistently at the shore. He ignores them. He just looks. It takes a moment. Two. Then Sherlock shakes his head -as if agreeing that yes, his eyes are not deceiving him- and shrugs, lips pursing, before he turns to walk to his armchair.
“Sherlock? I’ll need to get that. Be still for me? Just… there you go, just let it rest on the table, can you do that for me?”
“That’s it. Say ‘thank you’ to Sherlock, little girl.”
Something changes then. Something that stood between them, like a wall, invisible, intangible. Going down in an explosion of particles. Not so much unlike those constructed by dust, flying through the curtain of sharp sunlight, shooting glimmering like a knife through the room for an infinitesimally small moment. The world slows down.
Sherlock stands on weary legs, wooden knees. Takes the walk of shame that leads back to his bedroom. With the knowledge of the insanity that he will be back here again next night. And the next, and the next. Because that is all he knows how to do. Because that is all he can do. Why fight it anyway? This ocean is stronger than he is, too.
John was handed Honeybee to put to bed, and Sherlock made the table, opening the cartons to curiously peer what was inside. His stomach growled with curiosity at the spicy, rich scents wafting towards him.
As he walks the last few blocks to Ella’s office briskly, the image of Sherlock’s encouraging smile is pressed onto his mind, keeping everything else banished. For now. He grits his teeth when he wastes energy walking up the stairs to his therapist’s floor. He wonders how she’ll take it. Not that she is supposed to take it somehow, she’s there to listen and probe him after all.
John makes an approximation of ‘mm?’ with his forced-out breath, sounding more like a grunt.
“I’m not quite sure it is over yet”
‘What happened?’
A wail, muffled against his chest. John flinches visibly. He tries to rock her up and down one more time with no result. She cries louder.
façade by being stubborn. John gives a weak smile. He goes to make tea anyway.
Sherlock nods and stays still as John walks closer, to lift the precious warm bundle onto Sherlock's waiting arms. "Thank you", John repeats in a hushed whisper. If Sherlock was fool enough to delude himself, he could believe it was almost tender. John makes sure Rosie is safely transferred and then steps back again. He avoids Sherlock's eyes again. But it is alright, now; Sherlock can hold Honeybee. It doesn't hurt that much.
“Hey, hey, it’s alright.” John whispers.
John erases the tremble in his tone. He will be a good father. He won’t let Harry deter him from the goal. He won’t let Rosie down. He won’t let Sherlock down. Not again. Not ever.
The song… What of it? She seemed happy. She wasn’t. She can’t be. John can’t make her. He can’t take care of her. He can’t be a father. He was never meant to be. That’s it. Period.
The overhead light blinds him. He can hear a quiet grumble from the table’s edge. This isn’t the place or time for his recurring nightmares to be surfacing. Sherlock might need him. There’s pain. So... not a dream.
‘Shut up.’
He brings Ella’s words back to his mind. Knowing himself was the first step. He was working on being a good father and knowledge of self would help. It would. It wasn’t a distraction. It was hard work and he had to do it on his own. Well… that last part was all him. Not Ella. But that’s how he chose to do this. He didn’t want to bring more pain. To anyone. If there was something to endure, he would pull through it himself.
She sticks her tongue out to him with a grumble.
With the envelopes thrown over the table, John strides to the bathroom, which is unsurprisingly occupied. John means to knock a teasing greeting and wish Sherlock a good morning but Rosie’s energetic giggles that have turned to slight whines due to her need for nappy change transfer the news inside the thin door before he can move.
He looks at himself in the mirror as he passes by it. White shirt tucked in meticulously, black trousers. The same man, a different body, a different face. He raises his chin. The eyes that stare back at him are calm. They know who he is and who he should be.
John’s pinkies rest on the edges of Sherlock’s palm, steady as ever, keeping him steady too. He has the flashlight in his mouth again and a pair of medical tweezers in his good hand. ‘There we go, there we go, you can do this, love.’ He tries to communicate as he nears his target. The tweezers close tight around the shard’s edge and John pulls.
“Oh, come on. ‘The poor junkie, needing to be nursed back to health. Must have been such a sad sight. Maybe I should do more’”, he scorns.
They have breakfast together the next morning.
"Coming?", he hears from behind him, and at once turns around. John is half the street away from him, Honeybee's eyes wide as saucers. Sherlock swallows. John's body is shaking, he can feel it despite the distance.
“I’ll get it”, John has barely reached the landing when Mrs. Hudson’s voice answers to the unexpected visitor.
“It’s alright. Wanna talk?”
It only lasts a second and John tries to tamp down the laughter bubbling from his lungs. He manages only by the thought this might not go down well. There must be something up Sherlock’s sleeve for him to intervene like this. Isn’t there? Not that John wants him to solve all his problems, but Sherlock defending Rosie is… priceless. A warm caress over John’s longing heart.
Sherlock nods, eyes lingering on their little girl, unsure. He trusts John. It’s not that. It’s… John extends Rosie forward. She mumbles a little.
He also watched as Hudders insisted she and Sherlock were perfectly capable of taking care of Honeybee -at least until everyone is settled. John was reluctant, but eventually agreed. He still has to go to work, and some of the shifts were brutal. He still goes to the bottle, too. Sherlock has not seen him but knows when the reason John is keeping away are the bitter, poisonous drops. Sherlock knows all of them; he keeps finding half-empty bottles. He throws them away and cuts his hands on the glass even though it is perfectly smooth.
They both remained still for a moment. He with worry, but Honeybee with fear, crouching low over her baby table behind him, clutching the hand he held for her behind his back. It made the skin at the back of his neck crawl, the way she made no sound until the door downstairs was pulled shut, like the young of prey waiting for the danger to leave. Only then did she wail again, clutching his palm with both her hands.
“Thank you”, John sighs, body sagging with relief, letting go of tension Sherlock would never have known was there. And then John leans forward, until he can rest his forehead on their entwined palms.
Memories and decisions. With fluff. And angst. The usual. But rest assured, our boys are making progress, at last!
“Okay.” Sherlock’s voice is small but steady.
This doesn’t make sense...
“Don’t be absurd. Of course I am”
In love.
Sherlock, who had not been expecting an answer, raises his head. John is wiping a small streak of mash from Honeybee’s cheek with her green cloth napkin, his gaze averted but not guarded. “It was quiet, for a while”, he adds. He is keeping his left hand on his lap, where Sherlock can’t see it. Sherlock’s keeps tapping idly.
Close.
John is a father. 21 months and he doesn’t know what that means anymore.
John thinks of Rosie. Rosie giggling to the rhythm of his heart, pressing her ear against his chest. Knowing it will always be there for her.
Sherlock scrunches his nose.
“How often were you checking?”
“John?”
“So?”
Maybe he tried. Once. Twice. Maybe. But no.
“See you soon, then.”
It’s more than he would ever dare hope. More than his share, certainly. But this is what it is, this is what John wants it to be. And that thought alone makes his heart swell.
“Thank you for coming, John. Apologies for the sudden change.”
He grits his teeth and climbs on the bed, a knee folded under him. He reaches to what he assumes to be Sherlock’s shoulder. His palm rests there, feeling Sherlock freeze but only for a moment. John’s fingers stay still. He’s here to make sure everything is in order, he shouldn’t get caught up in sentimental touches. Not even his daughter wants his touch anyway, no matter how gentle or tender.
He tries to locate the sun, but wherever it is at one moment, he cannot tell. It seems to follow his gaze, making navigation impossible. But Sherlock needs to move. He needs to drift with the current, chase the riptide, seek, chase, find... But with every stroke the water hardens around him and his arms flail, his feet hurt from kicking foam. Instead of being propelled forward he is only fumbling in the dark like a newborn cub, the waves pushing and pulling and prodding him until they have him right where they want him. He struggles against them but grows tired, his muscles screaming with fiery pain. He stops and turns on his back, floating again, arms and legs akimbo. The ocean is not his friend, but not his enemy, either. It's there, every time, there to be crossed and discovered, but every time he tries he does not have what it takes to reach its end, to see beyond its orange and purple horizon.
“Mmm?” She glanced up from her notes, put them aside. “Meaning?”
“Oh, you can’t possibly ask me that, John. Of course I’m not drunk. Just cheerful.”
“I’m home!”
“I’ll get the ice then.” John declares after a moment of silence. He rushes out of the room, rubbing a hand to the point of collision with a final ‘ow’. Sherlock has already taken over Rosie’s care inside the humid bathroom and John’s heart flutters at hearing him all the way to the kitchen, as he opens the fridge, takes two bags of frozen peas and slowly walks back. He pauses at the door when hearing Sherlock’s voice.
“And I believe she is right. Cumulatively -from her experience, the tests, and Rosie’s background- it is overwhelmingly the most probable case that like many children her age, Rosie merely needs more time”
The glass that is placed in front of Sherlock stares back with extreme audacity. There is no way he wants to drink this, no, absolutely not. But when he looks up, there is a warm smile waiting for him, radiant and golden.
“Harry.” He rasps. “It’s me”
Despite her increasing moments of mumbling and blabbing, John was still worried about her. He had caught on the fact she could be quiet with him for days but with Sherlock she was all shouting eagerness. He didn’t mind. He just wanted her to be happy. But he needed to know why. He needed to fix it. To work for her, be better, be what she deserves. So, their appointment with a child speech and psychotherapist was scheduled for next week.
Why the hell is she so unphased? This is supposed to be a revelation! Well, not about his sex life, that is not going to change for a while, but… still.
“We’ve decided to talk now?”
“Want to?..”, John pats his thighs and indicates Sherlock’s legs with a small movement of his head -legs which are currently stretched across the coffee table. Despite how novel the freedom of making such requests is, despite the slight tremor in his voice, John’s words ring natural -as if there is no other way for them to sit on the couch together, as if this is the way things should be.
And every time he tries the thoughts are there, beating him back to his hamster wheel.
He needs a distraction. Anything to get his mind off his useless self. Off the people he is disappointing. Over and over.
Finding steady footholds. Finding their own light.
He doesn’t know what it cost the first time, for Sherlock. He can imagine but can’t be sure. But he
“Mm?” Head tilted, listening.
“God, you’re amazing. I’m starving”
“Look at me.”
There’s no air around him. Not enough oxygen. His lips are pursed together. His nostrils flaring but he can’t breathe. His insides are burning. Burning lungs as if he’s drowning for another breath, covered by heavy water, waves lapping at his body and sending him barrelling down. To the depths. His body eating itself. Searching for meagre reserves. His throat constricts and he wants to gag but he mustn’t. He mustn’t. If he opens his mouth only water will rush in. Only doom will find him.
Sherlock's eyes crinkle. Treacherous joy stirs feebly in his chest -like bubbles. But he should be careful. "Of course not". There is a pause. "Wouldn't mind, I mean", he hurries to add, when there is no immediate reaction.
There’s bile coming up John’s throat. What if him trying for more good, actually does more bad? What if whatever he offers and does, be it a fist or a kindly offered meal, any attempt at reconnecting, hurts Sherlock more?
Hum and voice become one as the identical blond and silver heads move from side to side together and John’s heart races proudly. ‘She
A beat.
John shakes the voices away, not understanding where they came from or why. ‘Why now?’
“Yes, John”
Rosie had apparently gotten that memo. She rejected it. She doesn’t need him- no. She doesn’t
24 hours. He’s not
“Yes…?” Sherlock recognises his hesitation.
Sherlock scoffs in good nature. Their eyes lock and they both look away in a split second.
“Of course. Of course”
“Hop, down the stairs we go.” He sing-songs to his baby girl, his little one, his joy. And he hops. He truly does.
, they scream.
“Right.”
John prepares their dinner with his thoughts running rampant like the free willing horses of old times in the grass planes of the world. Rosie hadn’t always been his first priority. When he learned of her existence he could only think about how and why. When he swallowed that down, it was only concerns about his own life and the changes he needed to make to accommodate a child. Then it was all filtered through her mother’s actions. He wasn’t sure when he finally let himself feel the least amount of love he could spare, closed off all the rest far away, deep inside. He wasn’t sure when that love bloomed and when he managed to treat her as his own child for the first time. As he should. He was sure of all the times he blew it all away however. His memory was perfectly accurate of all the moments he disappointed her, let her go, didn’t make her his first and foremost goal and priority… He’d like to think she had been now. For a while. But what if he’s been starting to get distracted? What if…
Honeybee is holding John's hand with both of hers, and is gnawing onto his fingers. John laughs and kisses the top of her head, faking an 'ow'. His other arm is holding her body, all baby monkey now, securely against his torso.
His heart turns into the beating wings of a butterfly.
“Me too”, Sherlock appeases. “I am afraid I am worse than you in this.... department”
“Everybody hides jewellery in their homes, John.”
“I’ll be there in no time, alright?”
“Awaweee” Rosie kicks her little excited feet.
“There we are again. I get it.”
“…Yes”
“Yeah? Good, good. Okay” John smiles before he dives under the table to fish for Honeybee’s bag. “We did pack her food, didn’t we?”
“John…” Tentative.
Sherlock was speaking to her in hushed tones, tender and careful. He was adamant about baby talk. John remembered from the days when her mother had gone off the grid.
"Better?", John smiles, a hand giving a little pat on Sherlock's collarbone over his coat.
Sherlock is tired. He is tired of the knot of mangled feelings beneath his breastbone. He’s lost in the labyrinth of it. What should he be feeling? Guilty? Ashamed? Angry? Forlorn? Bereft? Regurgitating the same old tattered memories, gnawing on the same old bones of pain has stopped helping, has lost its ability to jolt him to alertness like a fix.
His heart stops when his fingers curl over John’s. And then his heartbeat is too fast. Too loud. For a moment he is a herded animal, desperate to escape, the white of its eyes showing as it kicks and struggles. He holds tighter.
“Talk to me, Rosie. Tell me
Amidst the few other items of clothing he has left. It was here, waiting for him when he returned to 221B. He has not put it on since… Since that day. Since the morgue confrontation. And yet it’s here for him. It’s always been here.
‘For real?’
“John, I…” The words were there, like a script. Memorised. Perfected. A script which had begun to itch, to feel too tight, alien, like a tattered second skin.
“Hello you.” Greg sing-songs a little towards Sherlock, shuffling on the sofa. “Finding your good old self, I see.”
Sherlock shakes his head dismissively.
be going?”
“I’m home!”
“We sorted out what we want to do.”
“Yes.” It’s only slightly cutting.
Sherlock nods.
“Other reasons than… what?” She is baiting him. Sherlock can see her smile, a mirror of her brother’s mocking smirk.
John does.
of all people, over me?”
“Sherlock?”
“Promise me you will forgive yourself.”
Sherlock shifts, a tad self-conscious.
‘Please look at me..!’

A day late, but a 7k? That's us. So, we hope dear August, a mammoth of a month won't cause us any more delays! Enjoy <3
“One kiss.” John smiles.
Red. Blood. Hints of crimson reflected here and there. Turning the sapphires into rubies. All because of a scarlet pool of blood beside that angled face. Crashed. Down to the pavement.
Sherlock sighs, digs his palms into his eye sockets and squeezes until his vision is blurry and black-rimmed. He glances towards the couch, where John’s body lies, contorted into an ‘s’ shape, eyebrows knitted together, lips pursed.
“John.”
A hole inside him had filled, and thought it felt that this had happened overnight, the shift was in truth the movement of a tectonic plate; incremental for years and years, and then suddenly it peaked and transformed the world around it.
It was just trying to drill a hole in water. Just all over again.
John looks at him for a long moment, his lips open in a soft ‘o’, as if he were about to say something and is not quite sure yet if he will. “Yeah”, he breathes. “Yes, of course. I will be telling you when I want something, and what it is I want, and if you want it too, then… Is that okay?”
“She likes to hear a heartbeat. Humming a tune adds to it. Vibrations of the chest cavity.”
The growled wail is choked off, John’s entire body goes rigid.
Sherlock keeps his eyes on John, who is biting onto his lower lip with concentration -and when a little foot escapes him again, he kisses its little toes and pretends to nom on them, which has Honeybee squealing with laughter.
Enough. As much as it is required, needed. Never more and never less. He can’t remember the last time enough was good enough for him.
It became easier after that. And he would try harder. To not fail her again.
“B-bad.” He stammered, pressed his lips together. It was his homework. To write down everything he consumed throughout the week. He couldn’t. It wasn’t bloody working. If he tried, he could easily end up dead on the pavement, drunk to death, because of his guilt at drinking any in the first place.
“Since when do I have more manners than you?”, he teases, looking up from his laptop. Especially now, a distraction from his unnervingly fruitless research is most welcome.
“I used to hate baths too.” John whispers. Too aware of his own voice echoing in the tiled room.
Sherlock shakes his head ‘no’. John’s stomach clenches, an unpleasant feeling settling in. How could Sherlock not remember? He wouldn’t delete that information, he knows he needs it.
With an exclamation of triumph, John takes a step back and admires his achievement of having put both socks on his daughter’s feet. “Right. All nice and clean”, he kisses the golden curls and straightens up. “Don’t tell me it’s already time for her lunch”, he realises with a wince.
He freezes. The flash of memory is so vivid, he can’t breathe. He looks at himself in the mirror, old, silver hair, untrimmed beard, wrinkles around his eyes. Eyes. His eyes are wide. Then a flash passes. He blinks. His gaze is cold. He looks down and sees his hands shaking. It’s gone. His breaths normal again. His heartrate low. Resigned. He has tried, hasn’t he? So, nothing would work for him…
“Or is it?” Sherlock sits up on the edge of his chair, seeming immersed, but there are warning bells going off in John’s mind. “Harriet.”
John grows tense, averting his eyes. Sherlock huffs beside him. Exasperation carefully covered by an expertly cultivated shield of indifference only John knows how to break apart. Rosie squeals in a quiet register, squeezing the elephant pillow to her little chest. Still shy, hiding in her shell.
So, what would he do if he woke up now?
“I hoped, since you were looking for me, I hoped… you might forgive me. I hoped you wanted this-” He gestures between them, throat tight. “You wanted this back. And if you did… Sherlock, if you did want this back, I wanted it too. I remember… I was angry but I wanted
“John.”
“Temperature? Do you… Thermometer, something!”
He’s calling his name.
, they’d cackle.
“Professionally camouflaged for the public eye, don’t you think?” John teases, smooching a loud kiss over Rosie’s cheek and making her giggle.
Time. They needed time. Time to heal. Time to reconnect. Time to-
‘Think. Think!’
(See the end of the chapter for
The precious, sweet-hearted little one, that tries to feed everyone with her spoon, that babbles to her plushie elephant more eloquently than any adult to another, that boops his nose when he is sad, that falls asleep to the rhythm of his heart, that never forgot him despite spending eight months away from him, that is so brilliant with her puzzles and cloth blocks and drawings that she can achieve anything, anything she sets her mind to. The little girl that makes John smile and laugh, that gives him hope and courage to be the man he wants to be, that gives him a reason. The bundle of joy that has the tiniest dimples on her rosy-pink cheeks and the brightest sun-kissed curls, that blooms and blooms every day. Harry threatened that they could take her away.
“I just… I fell asleep. Beside him.”
“And then you say you’re not like Dad… Is that how you’re going to bring up Rosie? ‘Don’t want these freaks inside our home, Rosie, do we?’, ‘You can’t see your aunty, Rosie, we don’t talk to people like
His chest swells, and then caves in, and he hides his face in his hands. “I don’t want anything, okay? I just… I just
“I was wrong.”
“What are you referring to, John?” Her tone is patient. How can she do both at once? Press and pull. Negotiation. Interchanging. Bargaining for which emotion will be unearthed more easily. Which trigger will unearth it and how.
No, floor. It was a floor. A hospital’s floor. Not tiles but… Not grey but… Rubber. Mint. Lighting the eyes alive again.
He wants to talk, to breathe, maybe even explain. But what can he say? The depressing conversation about what recurrent nightmares are plaguing his sleep? Or the itch in his gut and fingers for something stronger than water, tea, coffee or milk? The horror of him fixating over cleansing an already spotless kitchen in order not to relapse or do any other harm, is spread in clear evidence all around them.
‘Alright, alright! You-‘ A sigh.
Oh god. Oh god he has failed him.
“Nappy change?” Sherlock pulls aside to let them in.
John steps closer, and Sherlock feels both giddy and annoyed and cornered.
Memories too far away but in need for remembering. Reconsideration. Itching inside of him. Clawing to the surface. ‘When he came back.’
And then it’s all pure joy.
An idiot to keep himself drowning in drops of alcohol. Poor excuse of a man… Selfish. Coward. A wreck. Ruminating. Again and again. His mind stuck on loop. That same loop. Sherlock. Rosie. Sherlock. Rosie. The drink.
“Papa is okay, Rosie”, he murmurs into her ear. There has been a major change in their lives, and she needs to be updated on it. “You will see him tonight, I promise. He is working on getting better. It will be alright soon”
With awareness came the questions about what he had missed, how long it had been. He glanced at his watch. It was almost ten o’clock in the morning. Didn’t John have a shift today, an appointment? Was Honeybee alright? Had she eaten at breakfast, how had she been? Had John eaten anything? His eyes scanned over the man sitting across from him on the bed with one leg beneath his body. This time there were no dark circles under John’s eyes, but there were fading lines over his forehead, and those hugging his eyes were deepened; John had been worried. Sherlock would know, or thought he would know anyway, what to do with that information; if there wasn’t that little detail, that warm palm over his. There was nothing he could explain now. He wasn’t at sea. He wasn’t on solid ground, either. He was stranded. Sherlock decided to opt for the worst-case scenario, even though it did not sit as well as it used to within him. He kept his gaze lowered.
“I’m going to work.” He blurted out and, grabbing his bag and phone, tumbled down the seventeen steps with his ears drumming, flooded with the blood he wanted to spill out of himself.
“What did you talk about?” she asks directly this time. She knows him. He knows she does.
Sherlock leaves the pan over the hob and offers his palm, the healing cut still wrapped immaculately with a fresh bandage. John’s fingertips float over it without touching and then in another impossible daring moment, he brings it to his lips. Soft palm being scratched faintly by bearded cheeks. He has let go a second after, eyes gauzing for a reaction. Sherlock grabs the pan again, face turning away. Is he blushing?
He remembers going with it. Not commenting and ignoring Mrs Hudson’s look of shocked disapproval. Christ’s sake, how could he ever believe a manipulative ex(or not so ex)assassin and an army doctor with anger issues and childhood of abuse could ever raise a child together? A child neither of them had said they wanted?
“I know...” he starts again. Slow. “I know you don’t want anybody to take care of you... but you are not taking care of yourself either...”
“When will you understand”, John’s every word is followed by a pause, sharp and steep, “that this is not about
A mantra in John’s mind.
Greg’s eyes scan him doubtfully. He’s right to do so. Both of them have slipped too many times already. Neither of them is perfect. Things went wrong at the most unexpected of turns. Always. When they thought everything was under control. John could offer no guarantees whatsoever.
Sherlock is pressing his fingertips between his lips, a permanent frown over his nose, muscles so tightly knit together John almost voices the desire to kiss it away. It doesn’t take much else for John to realise how worried Sherlock actually is about Rosie.
“I just… I always feel that you are pushing me away. And I don’t know why”
“You looked… shaken. Still do”
John’s shaking shoulders still.
oligotrophic
‘Couldn’t. That’s why I couldn’t.’
“Okay”
They got back when Molly decided Sherlock was in no fit state for more. John couldn’t forget - even in mid-drunkenness - the rebuking looks he got for that. He shrugged it off, rolled his eyes exasperated. It wasn’t his responsibility to notice the ragged breaths and shivers shaking the detective’s body. Or maybe it was, but he wasn’t fit for it. Poor excuse of a man… Letting himself believe he could actually take care of the damage he’s caused. Just a goal for redemption with no follow through. Look what he has become…
A moment passes. Then another. John doesn’t move. He has laid himself bare, fully accepted his wrongdoings, owning them. He is left on Sherlock’s hands. Entirely. Surrendered even when strong.
‘He kissed me’
"Sherlock?" The spike in John’s voice pierce his feet, his hands, his belly. He is empty. He tries to move, but all he can manage is to sway, tries to speak but nothing will come out of his lips.
At the centre of it all.
“Well, I wanted to say… I don’t think you know why- why I left my cane in your hospital room, do you? I mean, you predicted it, of course, but still.” John finds he is smiling at the memory.
“Flatters your cheekbones”
A number of things to note:
“I should have asked. I mean, more specifically.”
‘Saying “we”...’
John sits at a chair beside them, fingers flexing, legs stretching, tension oozing out of each and every pore of his body.
The full-bellied clouds above his head release their rain. His chest feels tight, his lungs stiff, and swollen like balloons. He is trapped in his body, his mind. They can only offer him the same knowledge, the same input, time after time, when he’s stuck in a loop and all he needs is to see himself from outside, from above, from somewhere else.
“Daw, don’t worry, we’ll give her a second dose before sleep.”
Sherlock had got up on watery legs and rubbery knees and tried to float his way closer.
“I will have one appointment with Ella per week, on Friday. And…” He swallows. His left hand is coiled into a fist, tight. He shakes his head and tries to exhale slowly. But the fist remains.
It is at this point in the comparison that he halts his minds’ wandering; this is the only similarity now. That, and the boundaries.
Their actions were different, but their words the same. They were forged out of the same materials, the same clay, blood, tears, the same fears and shadows. And perhaps, the same sunshine rays, same spring flowers, same summer breezes. Where there had been walls, now there was a way. A hand reaching to him, a beacon’s light shattering the night.
“Hey…”
John’s hand squeezed his again. He still had not let go.
John is a bomb. A ticking device, with countless errors programmed over its core. Waiting to self-destruct and take anyone in close vicinity with him. He always has been, always careful to hide it deep inside. This time his options are running thin.
All positive changes aside, the skies were still dark. There were moments were both faltered, fell silent, could not achieve a smile. Then they just kept company to each other, spent the time over cups of tea and small nibbles, waiting for the storms to weather.
Maida Vale is in fact a great area for families, now that he thinks of it. Cosy and spacious accommodations with large windows, trees everywhere, private gardens, the customary red brick buildings with white highlights and parking places upfront. Everything shining, polished. Walls and atmosphere clearer than the ones at Baker Street, standing strong and surviving, further away from the polluted heart of London. John takes a deep breath, appreciating the semi-silence of the smaller road that leads them to the doctor’s office.
“Haven’t we been waiting for your father, little miss?” Mrs Hudson tuts and presses a tender kiss over the golden curls.
“Sherlock?”
He sees stubble over harsh cheekbones and sunken cheeks, above a cut lip.
The words are swallowed by the space between them. Sherlock feels he is being turned inside out, John’s every violent pull a punch into his abdomen, and his eyes sting with the pressure of it, the unfairness of it, it’s so wrong it’s raw, and lodged in his throat so that he can’t swallow, he can’t get air out of his lungs, he’s just aching, his jaw clenched enough to make his vision swim.
He needs to talk to her.
. Because John Watson can’t be trusted. Of course he can’t. Not anymore. Look at him. He hates every bit of it. He doesn’t talk and he knows. He knows everybody else is doing hell of a better job at helping Sherlock’s recovery from Culverton and drug abuse than he does. But that’s the point, isn’t it?
“Ah…” Different direction helps. “I thought. At first. Then… no. No, I don’t think so.”
Sherlock’s breath hitched.
It has been a good day. For all of them. Despite Sherlock’s and John’s early start due to nightmares and insomnia. John catches another glimpse of Sherlock’s gaze drifting towards them. As soon as their eyes meet, it’s gone. Instead, Sherlock appears to examine a point on his screen with intense focus, but truly... John can’t be fooled like that anymore. Not when it comes to Rosie. Certainly not by Sherlock. The man has always been practically smitten with her. It is a wonder John has managed to ignore it before…
It sounds like… Like
‘Stay away. Hate me’
He whirs around and rushes to her, transferring the precious wailing bundle to her. And then finally collapses on his armchair, pressing the heels of his palms in his eyes. “Could you please… take her… for a moment…”
His cheek muscles stretch and John realises he’s smiling.
John hums, and awkwardly, because of Sherlock’s legs on his lap, reaches under the sofa to retrieve a rather hefty book. “Would you want to have a look at this?”, he says, handing it to Sherlock.
Antarctic Circumpolar Current: ocean current that flows clockwise from west to east around Antarctica. Alternatively called "West Wind Drift", it is the largest ocean current in the world. The current is circumpolar due to the lack of any landmass connecting with Antarctica and this keeps warm ocean waters away from it, enabling that continent to maintain its huge ice sheet.
He nods. It is already too much for one day.
“It was deliberate. I was… watching over him.”
John wasn’t fit to take proper care of the detective and his friend - and maybe something more - that he had almost beaten to death. Yet, he made it his purpose and promise to himself to do so that quiet Saturday morning, after the whiskey had dried from the bottle and the headache it caused came as a welcome reprieve. That’s where it all started, after all. A bad hangover and you suddenly believe you’re thinking straight for once.
He put his phone away, and his eyes narrow. John turns to him. The deep-sea eyes do not quite raise to him, and the circles under them are still there, like two dark moons. But there is the ghost of a smile on his thin lips. Sherlock’s head tilts to the side.
“I am angry because… Because she makes me feel that she is right”
Without a second thought, Sherlock squeezes back.
“John.” Sherlock scoffs, lounging back, suddenly lively. “I know. But I doubt the issue is developmental. Her processing capabilities are obvious-”
The familiar voice inside his head, now that he has had the melody of John’s real vowels and consonants into his every day, has taken new volume and substance. It has adjusted little inconsistencies, turned warmer and even more realistic, bursting with color.
I am too exhausted to check if we need to mention anything else in the end notes apart from the title but if there is something, we'll add it tomorrow ;)
His friend remains curled up and silent, eyes closed and fingers resting on the duvet’s edge, slack and unmoving. John had hoped Sherlock would grow accustomed to his touch, his presence maybe? Maybe after a while open his eyes, talk, unfold himself from the asphyxiating covers? But nothing was happening. It was as if John wasn’t there. Sherlock’s face was barely visible, just enough room so he could have fresh air; a practicality. His lower lip was bitten raw and now left to scald. His brow is relaxed but John can make out faint lines created by previous, continuous frowning.
“Yes?” He fights to control his voice with claws and teeth inside himself.
“What are you up to?” John walks over with an easy smile, fingers brushing the small of Sherlock’s back.
He can’t breathe and prefers choking on smoke.
Sherlock leans back a little, gives him room to breathe. Waits.
“John…”
“Any news? From anyone?”
Selfish. He doesn’t think that too loud. The voice hears it anyway. Always.
He’s chasing Honeybee, and John is laughing, as Sherlock pretends to catch her once, twice, and then John whines that he’s also in the game, that Sherlock can try catching him too. In his ears, blocked by sunlight and barking and the colour-filled wind, it sounds like a challenge. Eyes sparkling, he does try to catch him, long white fingers grasping a jacket sleeve tight. But John pulls away, so fast that Sherlock loses balance and crashes down hard, only his coat softening the impact on the naked ground. The world slows down. But as soon as Sherlock blinks, John is beside him, down on the ground too, head propped up on an elbow, leaning close.
“Please. I am okay. It’s fine.”
, as in… She is your family, too. Not ours in the
“There.” He whispers, not meeting Sherlock’s eyes. He moves away, reluctant but feeling like he has to. For now.
“I am sorry.” He continued sobering. “And thank you for taking care of her.”
There is no reaction whatsoever this time. Any strength he has gathered is fading. John watches Sherlock’s face muscles twitch once, his eyelids fluttering but closing again, his lips stuck together as if with glue, only it’s dried blood. John reaches his hand to Sherlock’s forehead, feels his temperature. Apart from getting sweaty, Sherlock is fine. Physically. As fine as he can be… As fine John can see… Maybe there are symptoms… scars… wounds… he cannot see. He’s not allowed to see… Cold water trickles down his spine and he swallows, nodding more to himself, decisive.
He woke up later than he usually would, to find that he had forgotten to set an alarm. His phone vibrated again instead, and he blinked before he groggily reached for it. The screen popped to life.
John stands in front of the sink. His stomach is rebelling. He takes another sip of water and fights the urge to retch.
“I-I better get to her.”
He just can’t.
“May I- um...”
“She’s in a more stable environment as of late.” He glances up, unsure. “She finally can start feeling at home.” Sherlock is owling at him, not saying a word. “I mean... She finally has one. A home. Of a more... permanent nature?”
“You have my word.”
Sherlock drums his fingers over the back of a chair before deciding to finally sit. John sees -observes- but doesn’t comment or press. He fixes Rosie’s night crème. She has started to eat bigger pieces inside her food so whenever John has the chance, he leaves her fresh fruit crème thickly blended, as well as her vegetables and other food, but at night her meal is mainly consisted of milk and some soft cereal, ideal for her stomach not to be heavy during sleep, so the paste is thinner than her other meals throughout the day.
Sherlock returns to him, curious.
“Yes, Rosie. Woof woof. It’s a puppy.”
John swallows. Swallows ice. Cracked edges, sharp glass, moving down his throat. A disease. A virus. Caging him. Expanding, crackling sudden frost. Bars. Jail bars around his lungs. His heart.
“I don’t know. I really don’t know”, he mumbles. And there’s something innocent at the core of his tone, as if something obvious for one of the cases or experiments was evading him. At least it’s a step toward the right direction.
He watches over her, wondering. Pondering, rather. With relief.
“Why would you forgive him anything and not me?”
But John knew. He knew what it was. It was not a question of when. It was a question of why. A why deeper than what he had anticipated, than what he
Sherlock doesn’t need to respond, he just watches. John feels his gaze like a caress over him. Gentle and soothing.
Sherlock looks straight to the far wall, out the window. His shoulders fall. Just that much. John can almost count the dust.
There is something blooming in his chest now. A small sparkle. The key is not to deal with everything alone. Under his nose, all this time. Togetherness. He could ask for help, cooperate. He is not useless, and he needn’t be afraid of needing someone else.
Sherlock chews on the inside of his lip. He wants to say something back, something clever, very clever, like he used to do. Wants to leave John speechless, maybe with a hint of that look he used to give him, that look that cheered amazing!, fantastic!, back at him. But now is not then. Sherlock doesn’t care to have the last word that much now, not against John. He lets it slide, smiling to himself as he closes the door of his bedroom behind him.
love her. He never did. If that’s not a clever comeback, then what is? It’s cruel and sharp and painful and he’s shaking with his skin rubbed raw, clawed open bit by bit. He could never be the same with Sherlock looking at him. Just like that. That look. That damned look.
Then Sherlock remembers the gap that opened between them with the slightest indication of danger. A gap they could not cross. Not together.
“You utter, utter madman. You scared me”
Shivering, he pulled the covers up over his head, creating a small cavern in the dark.
She babbles something that sounds suspiciously like ‘no’ but goes for the first mouthful anyway. She does not make another face or seems to need another taste-lick. She keeps eating slowly, humming as she scooped up little clumps of cream, her eyes going so wide when the spoon approaches her face that she becomes a little owl.
“Be quick”, John says, stepping to the side to let her pass.
“Okay. What do you
The deal between them is struck in silent communication. There is no going back. At least for the foreseeable future.
Light, and warmth. The first coherent thought coming to his mind, is that he felt good; both feather-light and solid, well-defined. Arms stretching above his head as his eyelids struggle to open, he revels in the freedom of movement, his body quiet and not protesting with pains, or nausea. As far as he can remember, there had been no dreams either, no brine of saltwater clinging to the back of his throat.
Instinct is slow to wake. Basking is all he does at first, too stunned, and too starved, to respond. He drinks it all in but as it comes, no rush, no fear. It’s heady, like too-sweet, warm wine, that leaves his tongue only begging to be doused with more, more, please,
He sighed.
John laughs, the clearwater stream laugh, high-pitched and carefree. “Yeah. Yeah, that would be something. Maybe two spares?”
He trailed to his armchair, sat down, and brought her little hands to his lips, the little hands that had meant no harm, and kissed over them again and again, until her tears dried, and a small shy smile bloomed on her lips.
Major angst ahead. MAJOR.
“Good. Listen, I am sorry to call on such short notice but I’ve been called for a conference after Thursday and I won’t be able to make it for our appointment.”
Sherlock’s eyes dart around the street, searching, dismissing, lightening in recognition or pulling away in confusion. Cars speed past them in the normal hectic morning rush and Sherlock’s fingers flinch every time a loud noise erupts between the monotone hum of the city; tires on asphalt, dinging of traffic lights for the visually impaired, honking. John hasn’t seen him in broad daylight in a while. Hasn’t seen his responses to the city’s overwhelming stimuli. Sherlock hasn’t been out at all. His birthday was spent just downstairs at Speedy’s, in semi-darkness.
“No” A wall.
John’s tone is soft but Sherlock has sat on a chair, gaze focused in its entirety on the puffy red-faced Rosie opposite him. Lines of worry are making his forehead fill with wrinkles and he is biting his lip raw in some inner struggle John is not privy to.
Sherlock recounts to him what she did, how much she ate, the precise timings of her schedule.
“We need to give Sherlock a break, alright little darling?” He whispers over her head, hiding the plushie behind his back and giving her a serenade of noisy kisses.
“Y-yeah. Sure”
They're in. Nowhere to stand. John reaches up to the plastic loops above them, and Sherlock does the same, his hand cold in his sticky, sweaty glove. He keeps his eyes locked on John, but when John looks at him, his eyes retreat hastily to his shoes. Out of the corner of his eye, he can see Honeybee is reluctantly peeking out from behind her elephant's floppy ear. The doors close.
she right?” His voice is soft.
“For goodness’ sakes, when will you two decide?”
But how can he prove anyone wrong? How can he prove Harry wrong? She isn’t his exception. But she can’t know that. Not in a million years. He can’t defend himself. Or else he might reveal just too much. There’s a reason he kept his life separate. A reason he ran away, but not after her. He didn’t need any more dictating of his life. He wasn’t going to be one of those poor young adults from abusive homes always needing someone over their head to function. No, no, he hated that foolish stereotype and he wasn’t going to give in. She would dictate his freedom while he needed a clean slate. He hadn’t let that happen. He won’t let her do it now either.
“Yours is slipping, little brother. It’s slipping bad.” She scowls.
“Where?”
“What about you?”, he says then, and smiles bitterly. Sherlock blinks.
“I don’t have an appointment tonight, so I’ll be home earlier”, John says, reappearing at the landing. The swoop of his silver hair is slicked back. He smells of crisp aftershave and the matching cologne.
There is something missing, however. A hum. A tension. Of words unsaid and touches forbidden. Of feelings shut down and hearts broken.
Also our sincerest apologies for this poor scene that supposed to be totally falling-in-love land but ended up in pain-land.
“Alright?”
John shivers. This is not a dream, is it? Sherlock is real. He’s not a ghost. He’s here. In his attempt to make sure, John reaches -in need- and touches one of Sherlock’s knees. An audible sigh escapes his lips. Sherlock snaps to the here and now, gaze turned to that treacherous reaching hand. John withdraws.
“John?”
Of course, he didn’t let any of it show right then. He took her in his arms and let her weep for a plushie that would soon be with her again. He let Sherlock believe that it was alright. It was just a small incident they could deal with. He delivered her to him when she reached, babbling a ‘dadadadadada’ at her crazy rhythm, before she nestled into him. But he refused to think about it right then. If he had, he would have broken down. Like now.
Ten days. Ten whole days. John thinks it’s fine. It’s all fine. Presses himself to believe it is. Pretends it is. Baker Street is more like… No. Not home. He’s not entitled to call it that. Equally though, the house he got back to ten days ago… was just a house. A place where him and his daughter could live for the time being. It strikes him as weird that they had actually lived there for almost three years. It should have been homely, warm, a place to unwind and relax. Protected. Both of them. But it isn’t.
Sherlock blinks, then realizes John is referring to his gelled and styled curls. Them being ready, which he always leaves last in his morning routine, signifies he’s done with his turn in the bathroom.
It rings again, its sound clear, as the door to 221B is open.
Waits.
“Yeah. Me neither”
“-’t was bad.”
Sherlock swallows. ‘Shut up. Stop’ His neck is burning.
“It was my father’s family tradition.”
He remembers. Yet he doubts it every day.
He takes a step forwards and breathes more clearly, letting his gaze fall. Sherlock’s feet are pushed under some pillows in a search for warmth. The humming stops. John stops too.
It drives home. John exhales black fume. “My sister”, he whispers.
He blinks.
He does. He knocks.
He had fucked that up royally, hadn’t he? Because instead of talking, instead of asking, John Watson had gone and kissed the man. And did the rest later. Hadn’t that been a blast. But John can’t regret it for the world. The softness of two Cupid shaped lips, fluttering under his like small canaries trying to initiate flight. Yellow and warm feathers shaping around his own.
years old’
‘Oh, love…’ He almost says that out loud. He needs to get this right.
He smiles, bringing her towel. There is a weight lifting off him. Slow but steady.
How can it mean anything at all, when John decidedly declared, time and time again, to everyone, that he wasn’t gay, that they were not a couple, that Sherlock was the one that had to go…
He is not denying John’s actions. He’s acknowledging them. Knowing them to be true. Yes, Sherlock was hurt. He was hurt then -physically- and now -emotionally- by John’s fists then and by John’s words now. There was a choice to make. Both times. And Sherlock has made it. Offering forgiveness. For now. John might believe he does not deserve it, not even once, let alone twice, but it’s Sherlock’s choice…
“Thank you for dinner.” John whispers into a smug, besotted little grin, eyelids a little droopy from a full-belly’s warmth spreading over him.
His knees don’t lock anymore. He’s on the cold hard ground. Only it’s tile. Only it’s their kitchen.
“Do you know why?”
.” Sherlock whines.
He could not have imagined what used to be. Yet now, bringing the fragile memories back, he’s cutting his hands on their edges of their doors, the last doors left standing in his mind.
“Thank you” He pushes out and leans, reaching. A soft peck for Rosie; met by a whine. Another for their treasured landlady that acts more like a mother.
Pulsing through his temples. Like rage. Like that day. Like fists and kicks and bloodied curls. A vicious animal. Growing in darkness. Feeding on fear. Scratching claws and teeth below his iced surface. Trapped underwater in a frozen lake. Freezing and burning itself raw. Ugly.
“I… It is not as simple as that”, he murmurs, the memory still echoing in his mind.
He thinks he sees a dark eyebrow raise imperceptibly.
“Quite. Thank you.”
As long as it is not a thing to threaten what they’ve been taught should never be threatened. The illusion. The anonymity. The silence. Hiding behind a euphemism, a slur, a list of vacant expectations. Hiding behind themselves.
With the last impetus of his fading anger he reaches his phone. It vibrates in his palm. He turns it screen-down before he can see why and presses the home button as if he’s strangling the life out of its helpless plastic body. One. Two. It vibrates again, a last broken whine. And it’s dead.
He slips two fingers in his tight jeans and fishes his phone out. The name on the screen startles him, makes him stand in silence for a handful of moments. He straightens, preparing for an emergency. Sherlock wouldn’t have texted otherwise. ‘Would he?’
“Pa.” Rosie pokes his cheek, lips puckering up.
“Obviously.” He smirks with how familiar this sounded to his own ears.
He got up and began pacing to appease her, low voice rumbling in her ear as calmly as it could. Rosie wailed louder and clung closer to him, inconsolable. This was strange. His voice always did the trick, after a while. Why was she not responding to it now?
"Um...". John tries and stops to clear his throat.  His gaze travels from his daughter to Sherlock's chin -and at the last moment turns away again.
“Who called?”
“You know, I never quite understood why you were so obsessed over my middle name.”
‘Pitiful’
So he could make a whole actual dialogue with her and John, despite his agreement with the statement, could never understand if Rosie had indeed understood anything herself.
“Let me explain.” Ella raises a hand. “What happened after?”
His heart raced the wind. His chest cavity small. Too small for such a love. Such an emotion. It pulsed through him and out. Around him. Leaking into the air. Molecules contaminated with a love he could never go back from. It was meant to be forever. It was meant to have all of him. All-consuming and overpowering.
How can she think he ever believed that shite? After years and years of her proving she’s normal to her own self? In parades and rallies and campaigns. How can she think that little of herself? How can she think her own brother thinks there is something wrong with her? After he helped her every chance he got? Every time she let him?
John’s breath is leaving him.
“I don’t see any” His voice is weak, watery.
Sherlock can feel the back of his neck prickling with the immediate refusal his entire body needs him to give. He doesn't.
The first vowel short but drawled with the absent rhotic, the curl of the tongue that cradled the ‘l’, the second vowel drawn out, tender, before the precision of the stop.
“Of course”
“Then you could have asked to see me someplace else. Now, will you tell me why you’re here?”
“We can consult another specialist, if you want”, Sherlock offers gently.
A small nod. Yes, it says. Yes, yes. Again.
‘No. No I’m afraid it isn’t’
She coughs a little, but does not babble a reply.
“I’ve been feeling this for too long. I hadn’t admitted it.” Breaths, squeezed out of him.
her...
“Little rose, please, please, Sherlock is sleeping well tonight, you mustn’t-” He freezes in place, his eyes blinking at Sherlock’s form, leaning against the mantelpiece.
hold off for one day. Just one day.
“I- I can’t. I-” He almost chokes on the next breath.
The sun that had begun to struggle through the clouds loses the battle and retreats. Sherlock presses the contacts icon, waits as it loads. There is only but a handful of contacts remaining. He chews on the inside of his cheek. Which one?
But John had kissed him. He had gone against all that, and
Rosie sits down idle, pouting. Her pirate ship half-sunk, the bubbles dissipating. She inspects them with a critical stare. John huffs.
‘There’s a difference.’
Another growl. It just ricochets. Sherlock’s body fills out against it.
“Are you angry because you believe her? What she says?” It is a long shot, and he knows it. It’s a dangerous one, potentially. He is grasping at straws. But he has to get them moving. The air around them is already growing stale.
He hasn’t stopped hearing John’s voice since. It comes and goes as it pleases, as if it has a will of its own. He doesn’t know where exactly it comes from, even though its details and mannerisms stem directly from his memories, from the wing devoted to John in what used to be a palace among the ruins. And it grew so real, that it did not have to say only things he’d heard John say but could say anything at all and it would still be unmistakably John’s voice. It would still be
He goes for his phone while walking down the street. The world is blurry. Washed out. His eyes wander over the dull colours of familiar buildings. His feet are taking him where he needs to go. Home. But his fingers are dialing.
When he’s done, John grunts and brings his legs up the couch, trying to fit into the small space. Sherlock stands to give him room and helps John turn on his side. He turns the telly on, on mute, to give them some semblance of company, some link to the outside world. John groans when its white light assaults his eyes and covers them with his bandaged palm.
The doctor excused himself, pretending to pay attention to Rosie, thinking they’ll work it out, Sherlock will work it out, maybe John will finally speak, or the other way around so John will finally have to listen.
Why would they cut their one old mutual shared joy anyway?
“Nothing.”
“You’re a bit tense today?”
Where Sherlock
He sits on his armchair again. His left hand is shaky as he carefully places the thermometer under her arm and holds it close to her body to steady it. “Only for a moment, Rosie, I promise”.
“He’s not like me in
“Would you mind bringing me thoughts about how she’s doing and what she needs? We can work it out together.”
“Hush... hush, little girl...” he whispered, lips resting over her shiny little forehead. “I’m sorry... Forgive me. I’ll do better.”
The light hearted version is: John reaches out. Sherlock freaks out.
Sherlock’s gaze feels peculiar on John’s skin, a strange warm tingle. He dares to glance up and he sees why. Sherlock shakes his head, just a bit, the movement infinitesimal, waking him up. His lips are parted and John this time allows himself to think that Sherlock might be surprised. John revels in it, in secret, raising his cup and taking a sip.
Who would protect Rosie to death.
“Keep eating, will you?”
He brought a hand to his lips, snapping a nail between his teeth, thinking.
“Doctor Watson?”
Together. Survivors among the ruins.
Sherlock’s turn to smile, despite his best efforts not to. “You’ll have regretted that by… 9.45, the latest”
Perhaps he will never get used to this. His heart will always kick a little when John holds his hand, and smiles, and looks at him just so… Perhaps this is why he is leaning in now, his lips soft and lingering onto John’s bearded cheek. Perhaps this is the thrill of being alive.
John hums, sending Sherlock a knowing, grateful glance. If anything is working, it’s because of him.
His pulse was giddy; in his palms, the insides of his elbows, his temple, his tongue, his neck. Something had happened, the scales had tipped, something was happening, changing.
“Wow, Sherlock, that’s quite… more than enough. Thank you.”
John stops mid-motion.
“Thanks”
“Mmph...” Sherlock looks away.
“I wanted us to talk… alone”
“It’s okay… It’s not your fault, Rosie. It wasn’t your fault. Shh… Hush, baby. Hush. It’s okay. I am here”
Sherlock lowers his gaze with respect as they walk past them; there is something about this moment that is so pure and private he does not want to be caught intruding with his stare. Beside him, he can see John’s eyes lingering, too. Sherlock wonders what he is thinking about. If he is longing for the woman that Mary should have been, for the family he was denied. Honeybee clutches his right index finger in a palm, and brings it to her lips, mouthing softly at it, as they leave the small family further and further behind. Sherlock can’t help thinking that she deserves a mother. That John deserves someone by his side, someone who will make him smile, and believe in himself, and be strong. They both deserve to be happy. Something in Sherlock’s chest deflates then, a balloon pricked by a needle, and nothing is as magical as it was a few moments before. The world grows back to its real size and can no longer fit in the cage of his palms.
“It wasn’t-”
Sherlock has turned to him. A kick comes forth. John gasps.
“I mean I-”
When John comes down with Honeybee, she is fed and washed, and in her blue onesie. When John is at work, Sherlock keeps her company and reads to her and tries to entertain her insatiable curiosity as best he can. But he can’t hold her for long, cannot take care of her entirely on his own.
As Sherlock is strapping Honeybee in her baby chair, John is already halfway through making her lunch, humming to the tune of a song Sherlock does not recognise. Sherlock watches him serve the mashed potatoes and peas in Rosie’s favourite plate, the one with Rapunzel’s smiling face on it, and draw a smiley face with the tip of Rosie’s spoon on the flattened puree, just as she likes. He joins them, still humming, and sits beside his daughter, placing the plate on her table. He helps Honeybee hold her little spoon, kisses her head in praise at the first bite, asks “alright, love?”, in that soft tone he keeps only for her, and then patiently corrects her grip on her spoon again, never losing his temper.
Then there was Molly. John hadn’t seen her in a month. Since his first week living back in 221B. She wanted to stay clear of the place -of Sherlock- and she had been perfectly clear about it after watching him wasn’t required anymore. John hadn’t had half the mind to object then. Although he should have. Definitely. He should have. But it wouldn’t do any good now… He remembers when she told him about Rosie’s first steps. From her cot to her toys on the carpet. She was careful with the news, respecting his supposed grief, even if it was mere guilt and anger and self-hatred. John hadn’t even taken Rosie in his arms for a well-deserved ‘good job’ that day. Not even a word of affection. Just like his Father had done to him, just like he hated.
“So are we… are we okay? About what… happened?”
And he’s laughing. Laughing until he can’t breathe.
He remembers the blank look of utter confusion that he got at those words and he finds himself almost laughing. Pained and sarcastic but it’s still laughter all the same. Naturally, he missed the wince of pain and heartache from the broken figure; sitting unmoving in that armchair before him.
John swallows. They have already discussed this.
They both stop. Startled. Sherlock blinks, his fingers playing with a loose thread on his knee. John notices, frowns, takes a deep breath. Sherlock, too anxious to wait, takes it as a hint, dropping the bomb.
“I won’t.” It slices. Deep and sure.
“Alaskan Malamute.”
“So, John.” She nods, encouraging and small, yet commanding at the same time. “And…?”
“Want tea?”
“Is she?”
Legitimately Sherlock in his head. He likes that change. The door closes behind him and his knees scrape the floor as he leans over the toilet seat.
“You’re good. You’re good.” A broken whisper.
“No, no, it’s not your fault, it’s just…” John puts his hands on his knees for a moment, as if he is light-headed. He breathes for a few moments, and when he’s ready to face what he wants to face, he nods, and straightens up. Sherlock braces. “I have things I want to say. I’ve never said them and I can’t… I can’t do this anymore. I need to… I need to know. And I need you to know”
“But promise me.”
He breathes in, after who knows how long, and the air swelling out his lungs is ice-cold. “Us?”
. Before, talking about feelings like this was sparse. Now, it seemed, John had set their friendship on a new footing. It was still to be tested, but its foundations were there, tiny saplings watered with every moment they spent together. Their late-night kitchen meetings, as Sherlock had dubbed them playfully in his mind, continued.
John jumps at the deep tone, startled as he was leaning over a baby purée recipe for Rosie’s high-in-fruit breakfast. Sherlock is in the doorway, almost leaning to one side, drowsy. He looks entirely messy -old white t-shirt and blue striped pyjama bottoms under the blue dressing gown, ever-present stubble- but in an endearing way. It’s just him; no armour, no walls. Just a sleepy, puff-cheeked Sherlock Holmes. John is taken by the ruffled curls once again. How could they always just look so, so, so inviting? His fingers are itching to reach and hold and brush through.
John sighs, then inhales, sharply. He can’t let this end here. They can’t just… agree to disagree. They need to solve this. Somehow.
Sherlock wonders what John would do if he found out. If Sherlock told him, with no preamble, no excusing, no explaining, just told him. He would not lose him. That much is obvious -and that was never the issue. But there is only so far John can go. The touches would stop. The closeness they have achieved, the trust would be destabilised. John would start worrying. Being cautious. Being reserved. Doubting. Avoiding. He would feel guilty, perhaps; for not knowing, for making Sherlock uncomfortable -as he would no doubt see it.
It only matters that he is not entirely alone; John is there. Honeybee is there. They are in 221B every night, in the room above his, safe, healing. Sherlock had not fully realized what this could mean, until the early hours of the morning.
Today he will deal with the mess in his head alone. Thoughts. Feelings. Jumbled. Flying around rampant. The least he can do is give himself a sober today. He doesn’t know about tomorrow. In fact, he is very much sure he won’t be able to resist a sip for long. He is not equipped to do so. Not if he is left to his own devices. But dear god above, he
Feet wrapped up warm and resting on John’s legs, sharing in his natural body heat, Sherlock can’t but admit that, “Yes. Thank you”
“Yes?” It’s soft but bitten off. As if John came here with accusations in his mouth and Sherlock is only waiting to hear them.
John snorts, something that vaguely resembles a frustrated agreement.
“Okay. That’s quite fine.” Chloe is smiling. John blinks, confused. “Does Rosie have any hearing problems?”
“Is that a yes?”
He had to stay away those nights. Scared of what he might do. His self-loathing on a high. Tricky to manage. Making him seek the last drop of the empty bottle in his hand. Had to stay at the hall or run to the pub. His half-finished bottles always disappeared the next morning but he didn’t have the energy to pay them any mind on his crazy hangovers. To ask where they’ve gone or who’s taking them. Maybe Mrs Hudson. But no, she wouldn’t meddle like that. Why would she? Why
“For…?”
‘Shut up.’
And yet his heartbeat has changed, his breaths, his bones.
Sherlock does not try again. John is panting. Standing over ruins, the ruins he created, the ruins he deserves. And then he looks up.
“Happier?” She turned her tone to questioning this time.
“She… wouldn’t have done that before…” His heart opens.
“Of you… l-leaving.”
John thinks he can even hear birds chirping out the window in the middle of sound-polluted London. There is so much energy running through his brain and body, making him almost dance around the room. Cheerful. Covers are thrown away, lips are puckering to a circle, John sits up and starts whistling.
so, here it is, enjoy! ^^
“No, please. Let me… Let me express this… Gratitude, it... It’s important to me. Especially because… Because of what I am doing now. The things I need to change, they have to do with how I’ve been. Towards you, too”
"Sugar?"
John’s eyes catch Sherlock’s graceful figure, managing to flop on his chosen armchair without bringing any discomfort to Rosie whatsoever, and he keeps staring, unable to categorise this as a hidden talent or an indication John will be in trouble for his mischief later. He walks to them and sits quietly at the chair nearby.
‘Useless’
Sherlock glances at him, scowling. Then nods.
This wasn’t John holding his hand to do something else, or when doing something else. This was John holding his hand. And that was it. And it wasn’t one-off, either. From what he could understand from the heat of their hands together, from the way John’s palm had turned a little clammy, this handholding had been going on for a while. For how long exactly he could not be sure.
“Oh, hello!”
Sherlock is enveloped in John’s arms, his head resting over John’s clavicle, and there is no harm that can ever find him here. In this cocoon there is only John’s heartbeat, not a trace left of the rest of the world. John’s palms keep skimming over his back, rubbing; up and down, over his spine, his nape, and then downwards once more, as if he is putting Sherlock back together again. Piece by piece. Gently.
“What?”
With John at the doorstep of 221B, Sherlock tries to hope -and cope. John tries to avoid.
“Okay.” His voice is small. He musters his courage to go on with a deep breath. “I thought-… I was angry. For many reasons I shouldn’t be. I didn’t want to be. I was angry at myself most of all. But I thought… I thought the worst was over. I thought the worst thing I could’ve done was cut you off brutally like that for months.” He ruminated, then with finality. “I had done so and I believed… I truly believed that was the worst of it. So I-I hoped.”
“John. Stop”
He can hold her now. For one month he’s fought to give her everything 8 months apart had taken from them both, fearing each day might be the last when he would be allowed to smile at her, to watch her grow, learn, play. To feel her trust, her innocent, pure care for him -ever trying to feed him with her spoon. He did not want to encourage her to bond with him, did not want her to experience another loss a second time. He always felt their time was borrowed. But every time he tried to resist her sunlit smiles, he couldn’t. And now he can hold her.
