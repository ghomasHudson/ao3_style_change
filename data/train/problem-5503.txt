“It’s the arms that take the cake,” Natasha’s voice came from behind them. “How you feeling, Stark?”
“Oh, good! You know what we’re talking about! Not that. Now come join us since you’re a pivotal part of this team!”
“No! No Steve what! With your stupid grin and your stupid arms and — glasses? Really, Tony, glasses? When have you started wearing glasses?”
He could feel the nerves gathering as he added the perfunctory baseball cap and glasses that he favoured for lowkey trips outside. It was a half hour thing, go to his PO box, come back. Darcy had helped him set it up many months before — Darcy was truly a godsend when it came to normal life stuff. She’d always have an answer to all the stupid questions he had, and she always berated him for calling them stupid. “Steve, you’re adjusting, of course you won’t know what a VPN is,” she’d say and he’d nod defeatedly.
“Clint sent approximately eight hundred emojis on everything including secure SHIELD communication channels. General Ross’s personal assistant texted and said he broke a desk so, well done.”
The exchange had him shifting on the chair he didn’t remember sitting on. Acutely aware of the box in his backpack, he chose to focus on finishing up a report before the next step of the plan. It helped minimise the attention he paid to how minutes passed. He must have been at least a bit of a masochist, and really, Steve, you absolute idiot? That definitely
He couldn’t exactly pinpoint why he was so aggravated by the entire situation. Part of him was hoping they would be more excited – if they could get hyped up about movie night, Steve figured this was just some next level event. It was supposed to be a team thing, a
“As expected,” Natasha replied. “Fox is foaming at the mouth, Breitbart threatened to have you arrested and or court martialed under some unknown authority they dreamt up in the past eight minutes,” she informed him with an eye roll.
“We’ll wait for you,” Darcy shouted from the kitchen where she and Bruce were putting together a snack.
The sofa was definitely not big enough for both of them to enjoy their post-coital bliss side by side. Steve didn’t mind, though, he would have gladly forced his muscles to support him forever if it meant looking at Tony’s flushed face, at his contented smile, and the way his eyes seemed unable to focus on anything other than Steve no matter how much they fluttered shut every now and then.
“I love you too, darling. Take your time, I’ve got some water for you when you’re ready,” Tony told him.
“We can probably put a small arc reactor in it, maybe even make it sing,” Tony confirmed. “Come to my lab some time, we’ll talk,” he said and nodded at Steve. “Thanks for my mug, Darce,” he added, using both hands to hold on to the huge mug. It had bad drawings of the Avengers and it was absolutely glorious.
There was a vague sound of Rhodey whooping and Natasha clapping and Bucky cursing softly and Darcy laughing and Clint patting Tony’s shoulder. It all registered in the back of his head, including the proud look Tony threw him, and Maria inviting them all to eat a bunch of dicks. Steve turned away and walked to a bottle of scotch, conversation with Fury forgotten.
“Shh, you’re okay, darling. I’ll go slow.” He kissed Steve’s sweaty hairline, nuzzled his temple. “I know you’re sensitive, I’ll be careful,” he said. His fingertips ghosted over his balls, then he moved up just as delicately. “I got you,” he whispered.
“You have no idea how hard it is for me not to make a dirty joke right now. Very hard,” he deadpanned as he turned to walk up the stairs. Pepper was still in hysterics when he punched in the code to unlock the roof door.
The teacups were not the worst idea, but they weren’t the best either. Steve had no problem with speed or motion in general, but his field of vision was blurred by the spinning movement and it didn’t exactly help. The squeals from children were endearing, their fun almost contagious. Or it would have been if Steve hadn’t just ensured months of harassment from the opposing media. And even the supporting media. He figured Bruce would be accomodating in giving him a remote quiet place where he could go and regroup. Or hide forever, why the fuck not?
The silence was uncomfortable at best, which put Steve even more on the edge. Even punctured by the frequent fireworks, it seemed deafening. He couldn’t help but turn to look at the way Tony’s face was lit up repeatedly by the bright colours. The scientist’s eyes looked tired and perhaps sad, and Steve’s stomach clenched painfully.
Tony wasn’t in the tower when Steve woke up. Friday informed him that “the boss” had to fly out to Boston for a last minute meeting. Which in Tony-English meant he was probably hiding in a lab somewhere in the world for as long as he needed to get over whatever it was he was annoyed about. Steve’s anxiety reminded him repeatedly that he was mad at him, and Steve knew that too well. But if Tony needed time off, Steve would respect that. And punch through several bags until he felt tired enough to sleep.
Tony laughed. “It’ll just be more comfortable. Don’t worry, it’s a magical t-shirt.” He pulled it towards him and Steve held on tighter, eyes wide and definitely not ready to let it go. Tony sniffed it a couple of times. “Okay, it’s clean. I think I wore it only once since it’s been washed, if that bothers you I can —“
Life shouldn’t have gone back to normal, Steve was perfectly aware of this. But it had, as much as normal could be when he had to live with the ever-present thought pushed in the back of his mind that he was attracted to his teammate. It was like a permanent wound that wouldn’t heal, and Steve knew the comparison wasn’t right, but it was what it was. Weeks went by with minimum danger of the train incident repeating. He didn’t make a conscious effort to avoid the man, not even on the very following day.
“Oh my god, just let me sleep, all you ever do is talk and wake me up and I have frankly had enough,” Tony snapped mockingly. His eyes were shut, but the smile on his face was telling. He settled deeper into the comfortable seat.
“One day, Captain Steven Rogers, I will get you to admit you’re doing it on purpose,” Tony said, walking towards the bathroom.
With another long-suffering sigh betraying his age (he fleetingly thought this was all he did recently), Steve pulled his phone out.
By the time he got to the hotel he felt better about things. It was probably the fatigue, but it didn’t seem so dire anymore. He found Tony curled up with Bennu on the sofa, head on Natasha’s lap. He swallowed the pang of jealousy that overtook his heart.
“I doubt there’s chance for that, Bruce. If meeting all of us hasn’t, there isn’t much chance of anything else doing it.” Steve left the implication of bad things unsaid, and Bruce allowed it because the thought of it was too painful for both of them.
“Not particularly hungry, but you guys enjoy now,” he said and smiled to try for some friendly demeanor as the he shut the door.
There was nothing else to do but follow. He tensed, then the relief washed over him as he came. He kissed Tony back fiercely, with everything he had. This was aftercare and love and togetherness. He belonged now just as much as he did when Tony had put the belt around his cock. Here, in the man’s arms, cum dripping slowly on his belly.
“Steve,” Tony said gravely. “These are the markings of our ancestors,” he explained and pointed to the scuffed surface of the cabinet.
Tony half-attacked him, kissing him hard as he pushed him backwards out of the elevator. He took a second to decide on a direction, then proceeded to move them to a sofa. He sat Steve down and joined him, immediately going to kiss his cheek and jaw.
“200 channels in variations of Russian, movies from the 70s, and German porn, music and all. Hence, this.” She used her chin to point to what Steve could only describe as a jug of reddish coloured liquid that she held in the nook of her arm. There were two straws connected to give her the extra length she needed to sip leisurely from it.
“Yeah, no,” he repeated her earlier words, and Steve couldn’t help but find it endearing. “I tend to kind of break things when I get out.”
“Out of the question – stay down, Jesus Christ!” Steve shouts at a bot that’s still crawling towards him. There’s a brief respite, so he turns to Tony. Even with the cowl on, the downturned corners of his mouth speak volumes. “Are you trying to get me mad on purpose?” he asks, his voice actually oddly calm.
Many more handshakes later, they were finally led to a ballroom of sorts, equipped with large round tables full of different sized plates and at least three forks. Steve almost sneered. He stole a glance sideways to both Natasha and Tony, both looking much more at ease within that set-up. He tried his best to mimic them.
“I walked in and you were being silly for the kids and it was goddamn snowing and – Tony, I don’t think I can put into words how fucking beautiful you looked.”
The smile he received in return made it worth it, he decided. It was difficult to explain, especially with a hazy mind that was solely focused on Tony Tony Tony pleasure loving Tony and Tony. It was difficult to explain, but he accepted it, confident in their prior negotiations, in the lengthy conversations they had had, in the rush he got at a caring, somewhat dominant Tony, in the peaceful feeling of submitting to this wonderful man. He’d read up on it, analysed it clinically, then with a bias, then shared his findings with Tony. He’d touched on it with his therapist, the power dynamics. It was important, she’d said, that there was communication and understanding, which Steve was happy and proud to report they’d ensured.
Natasha shut the door and with that, the light disappeared as well. Steve let his body fall to the side, groaning as he went. Fuck his entire life. Like, hold it by the head and fuck it - no, too soon. He grabbed his phone from the bedside table. Missed calls, messages, 5:07. He could tell them he was unavailable. Some illness, perhaps a cold. Sure, the serum would prevent that, but this cold was special. He had to sleep a lot to overcome it. Yeah, sleep and dream some more. His dick was so hard it was painful. He started to reach down when his phone vibrated in his hand and he shrieked for the second time that morning. Tony. Of course.
,” Steve pressed on, rather enjoying the other man’s shudder, “and said ‘you know what, Steven, I’m gonna work with a team to turn you into this guy who will be able to completely astonish my son. I mean I don’t know when I’ll be having a son, but I know for sure he’ll be very much like me, so a complete asshole, and he’ll need to be shut up, and astonishment is a must!’”
Seconds later, Sam’s sigh follows. “Why you gotta be so goddamn dramatic? Hurry up, I’m covering you.”
“Whoa, boy!” Darcy shouted and made Thor stop. “Well then,” she said with a smile, “come help us make this your tree as well.”
“Told you,” came her voice, and Steve found himself being floated away from the almost loaded dishwasher.  He scowled and waited for it to be over.
Steve was on auto-pilot. He dreaded checking his phone. Nat told him Darcy and Clint were working on a tumblr dedicated to his speech. Steve groaned and smiled when he shook someone’s hand. The faces stopped having individual features right after it hit him he may have had a psychotic break on national and international television. He was trending on Twitter. This was a disaster. Steve wanted, genuinely wanted to go back to the ice.
Natasha barked a short laugh at something someone said on a tv show that made people throw themselves onto bouncing surfaces. She waved their confused looks away and sat up. “Okay, cards?”
“Oh, Steve! Will you let me drag you to an empty room and kneel for you and suck you off? Quick and hard and messy? While you’re still wearing the suit and you’re looking down at me? Straight down my throat? And you can touch the bulge it forms, you’re so fond of it.” Tony must have been prepared for it, because when Steve thrusted up into his mouth, he took it in stride. Steve had no self-consciousness left to feel bad as Tony pumped three fingers in and out of him and swallowed around the head of his dick.
“My days of Starking people are over, I’m afraid. Casual sex just isn’t the same when you might be called away on a mission.”
The man regarded her for a couple of seconds before reclining back in his seat and sighing. “I shouldn’t have let you work in legal,” he replied, a note of wistfulness in his voice.
Steve turned them both on their sides, shuffling to get them both comfortable. “This is new, I’ve not – not with someone like you – and not with someone I… care so much about.”
“Mhm. Okay, we uhm.” He pulled Steve’s forehead to his own. “Captain Rogers, given recent developments, would you like to alter your plans and spend your birthday making out with me and maybe let me give you a filthy birthday present — OH!” Steve opened his mouth to answer, but Tony had already pulled out of his arms and grabbed the newspaper from the table. “Where is it? Okay, look!”
“What HR? We don’t have a functioning HR department!” Vision’s exasperation is clear, but so is the amusement behind it.
“HAPPY BIRTHDAY, STEVE!” he shouted. “I’ve had way too much coffee, holy shit!” He paused to look at Steve, then smirked. “Like what you see?” he asked and did a back-and-forth twirl.
Darcy finally hopped off Thor and sat on Bruce’s lap on the large armchair. “I’ll nap now, horseriding is very tiring,” she informed and kissed him briefly before settling down.
“I don’t want to make you uncomfortable,” he whispered. “I… I love this,” he said, hovering over the arc reactor. “It keeps you alive. But if you don’t want me near it, I won’t touch it.”
“It’s too late to try and say that it’s nothing, isn’t it?” When Tony nodded, he continued. “It’s been… not great since we came back. I feel cold whenever… I don’t know how to put it.” He paused. “When it gets bad I feel the cold like… then. Like I’m freezing again. It’s mostly at night, but it hasn't been this bad since we were looking for Bucky. I thought it would go away by now.”
of sorts, like they were uncertain how to keep going. “Don’t mention Jesus when you’re in my bed. Why
He looked up, surprised expression on his face, as if he’d forgotten Steve was there. Then it morphed into something much gentler. “Sorry, I get stuck in my head sometimes.” He reached into a cabinet and pulled a bowl out. He inspected it through the cling film. “Looks okay.”
The man had taken his t-shirt off, glass long forgotten. He had unbuttoned his jeans, and was running his fingers on the skin above the waistband. Every now and then he let them dip lower, but his sole focus was Steve. “What do you need, darling?”
Bucky texted relentlessly. Question after question even during his mad speech. Then he switched to texting funny bits of stories and Steve smiled because Bucky was truly a great friend. There were private messages from all of them, including links to online stuff for when he felt brave enough. (Never, his mind offered.)
“No, you are,” Tony countered, his voice rough. “So mindful of my wellbeing and the way you hold back. Even when you can take, you’re careful not to hurt me. So thoughtful, darling.”
Steve wanted to be jealous. Some small petty part of him succeeded, but overall, he was just accepting. Pepper had been and remained a massive part of Tony’s life. Pepper was actually a massive part of all of their lives, with the way she mothered and cared for them. Steve could not be jealous of anyone who had made Tony feel loved and appreciated. “I… Can I kiss you?”
It wasn’t that Tony had eyes for anything else when they were in a room. And it wasn’t like he lacked Tony’s attention or loving touch, or sweet smile in the morning (or any other time, really). And it wasn’t like the sex was anything less than mindblowing. But Steve craved it always, so yeah, that was one of the layers of nerves. It came with a neediness that Steve still feared was off putting.
He reverted to his original idea, carefully laid out in his notebook. He spent the night googling and texting Pepper at odd hours with questions about the best places in New York to buy things without too much hassle. Bless her, she was more helpful than all of the Avengers combined. Someone had tried to offer him dinner, but Steve was in (what he identified on a bathroom break as) a teenage angst spree. He smiled at the thought that it was probably what Tony was calling it. And as annoyed as he was with the man, he still found it endearing. In all fairness, Steve was being uncharacteristically petulant. So what?
Tony leaned in and they both took the cue and came closer. “Did you know that ‘Natasha’ spelled backwards is ‘ah, satan’?”
“The panic has always been there, Tony. You’ve seen my medical file, you know my history; I’ve always had this feeling of choking, even when the asthma wasn’t that bad. You’re not the reason for my anxiety, I am,” he added.
“Really,” Steve replied and handed him a large silver star. “Darcy and Clint insisted that we put the A on it,” he said and pointed to the cardboard letter that was glued to the glass ornament.
“I think I want you sitting on my face later,” he said when he took a moment to breathe. “We haven’t done that in a while.”
She laughed weakly. “I also saved the tree,” she said simply. “And I don’t want to be in Medical right now.”
“Well, you’re an asshole,” Steve announces, taking in the situation, hand resting on his hip. “And you can kiss your birthday present goodbye, along with my ass.”
“Looks like our dear Captain found himself a belle of the ball!” Tony’s voice boomed in the room, followed by pearly laughter everywhere.
Steve tried really hard. He really did. But he couldn’t hold it in, so when he finally laughed it was loud and wild and he had to close his eyes and rest his head on the top of the armchair and just let it happen. Because it was the only way to release the ball of emotions that was in his chest, and any other way would have been not only mortifying, but also pretty shitty considering how drunk Tony was. Also considering that what he wanted to do was kneel in front of him, kiss him, and run his hands through his stupid messy hair.
Tony tries to focus. He really does. But Steve looks so beautiful, it’s nearly impossible to do anything other than stare. His hair’s sticking out, there are smudges of dirt on his cheeks. He looks fierce, larger than life, powerful. Gorgeous. “Darling,” he whispers almost reverently, having trouble accepting that the loving voice belongs to him.
Nights seemed endless. They seemed endless and Steve found that even with the increase of daylight time and all the extra activities he made himself do, he was still unable to sleep properly. He took to sparring with Peter, trying his hardest to get him to drop the polite title and call him Steve. He claimed he didn’t deserve it yet. Steve liked the kid, he reminded him of himself as far as determination went. He let Bucky and Clint and Peter teach him how to play video games. He took up colouring – Nat got him into it and he kept at it, trying to empty his mind. He helped Darcy whenever Darcy needed help. Once it was just sitting there with Thor and Vision, rating outfits for a date.
It was both empowering and tender to share this experience with Tony. To put on this act and to watch the man’s face as he rolled his tongue back in his mouth, drops of cum escaping as he licked his lips. He made a show of swallowing it. He was almost afraid to touch his cock again, the intensity of his earlier orgasms still vibrant. But he was hard and aching and he wanted to chase that feeling once more.
“Aww,” Steve cooed and smiled at Tony. Then he dropped the act. “No, go away,” he added and shut his eyes tightly. Maybe if he ignored Tony for long enough he would give up. It was stupid of him to think that, in all honesty, given who Tony Stark was. He could feel the intense gaze on his face, but remained stoic in his quest of ignoring it. The warm breath got closer and closer until he could feel it right above his nose and mouth.
“So help me God, I’ll pull you over my knee and spank you!” Steve moaned, licking it again. “Oh, you’d like that?” When no answer came, Tony thrusted upwards slightly. “You want me to discipline you? I thought the army did that, Captain.”
He was playing dirty, running his fingers on Steve’s sternum, where the skin was heated by his flush. In the blue glow of the arc reactor, he wasn’t sure it was visible, but he could definitely feel it. “I don’t suppose I can distract you from having this conversation?”
“What the fuck are you doing?” Tony asks, definitely not proud of his high pitched voice. He flies down and starts shooting. “Jesus Christ, one day I’ll actually have to punish you,” he mutters angrily, partly to himself, partly to Steve, completely ignoring the fact that they can hear him over the comms.
“Yeah, yeah, and then you’d have wanted to scrub the oven, and polish the silverware, and knit some warm tiny socks for homeless kittens, and we’d have been here all night waiting for you. Now sit down,” he said just as Wanda lowered him on the sofa, between Bucky and Pepper.
“Please please please, we’re bored and you’re our friend,” Tony insisted. “Are you asleep already? Steve? Steve? Steve!”
Steve nodded, then sighed. He turned to look at the man currently rubbing comforting circles on his hips. “It felt like, like I was hit by a train. And you know my history with trains. The woman was kissing me, there were people everywhere and I –”
The leather was cold, a grounding point if Steve had every felt one. It fit snugly under his balls, then Tony pulled it up, encircling his cock loosely at first, then tighter until it was finally secured, and Steve
There was a break in their schedule to allow for a change of clothes and away-from-the-press time. Outside, the people cheered them on when they exited the building. Steve would have given up all his worldly possessions for the pavement to open up and swallow him whole. The grotesque statue he avoided looking at glinted in the sun in his peripheral vision. The people thanked and welcomed him as one of their own. Natasha conversed in rapid Russian with a couple of mothers and their kids while Tony signed plastic Iron Man masks.
Unfortunately, he was not wrong. Steve would have chosen a different word, but all in all, that was the closest term for the chaos that was outside. The mass of people was downright erratic, waving flags and to Steve’s utter horror, children. Fair enough, there were only a few and they seemed to be quite secure, but the sentiment baffled him. Tony waved, large smile on his face, sunglasses up to hide the dark circles and potential disdain. Natasha smiled at the little girls wearing red wigs, and he followed their cue, waving and smiling at the kids who wore homemade cardboard masks with his face dressed as Captain America.
“Tony. Enough, it’s just us in a car in a foreign country. I already checked for bugs, everything has been cleared by SHIELD. Please,” she told him simply.
Also, can your poor hard dick forgive me?” He placed a kiss on Steve’s half-hard cock as he moved to get up. “I was thinking bathroom break, coffee, water, energy bar. I have plans for you,” he said as he got up.
They can see the telltale signs of fire in the distance, south of their position, lighting up the sky and what looks to be an entire block. “You ready, Cap?”
Tony laughed. “Alright, Captain Pun, you’re not allowed on the internet anymore.” His face seemed to betray some sort of knowledge, and Steve was suddenly scared that he knew what he’d been looking at and doing.
“Sure. So earlier this evening you were just thinking? You know, when Barnes had to drag you out of the room and you were practically hyperventilating?” The voice was strained to stay calm, and Steve was painfully aware he was fucking up again.
Steve’s arm is halfway in the circuits on the bot’s back. “I barely listen when you’re wearing clothes,” he says, tint of annoyance in his voice. Probably at the fight, but Tony’s heart sinks a little.
Tony laughed again, the sound making Steve’s heart beat faster. “Yeah, you’re not wrong. Fine, I’m going!”
Steve snapped. Something inside him snapped, he could feel it travelling all through his body, landing at the base of his cock where his balls had drawn up. His muscles locked and he knew he was coming because he felt Tony’s calloused hand on his cock. The strokes were punishing, forcing his orgasm to go on and on. Tony was kissing his temple, into his hair. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” he croaked.
“Tony, I’m so close – please, I need to – you’re perfect, you’re driving me insane. Oh, God, I’m gonna come,” Steve said, starting to pull back.
Tony’s heart is a rollercoaster, he realises. More than shrapnel threatening him at all times, it’s a manic ride full of skipping beats and rushing when Steve breathes towards him. Which is fair, he surmises, given the angles of his boyfriend’s face, the symmetry, the sweetness of his lips. “I’m fucked,” Tony tells him before hovering, hand out and ready to pick Steve up.
Couple of things: the "stealing a goat is super romantic" came from the ao3 tag of the day blog. Joey sent it to me one night and the idea stuck, so meet Bennu the goat. I've read a post about the name of the foundation Tony opened in his mum's name, but I'm gonna go with Maria Stark for this series.
Natasha chimed in with a well timed small cough. She leaned on her elbows, capturing the prime-minister's attention. “I wonder if perhaps Mr. Stark might be a better choice,” she offered evenly.
“It happens,” Tony shrugged, cheeky smile on his face. He inspected the tray one more time before pulling open the door to a massive oven.
They had been assigned secret service security which was hilarious given who they were, but the protocol was there for a reason, so Steve didn’t push it. It wasn’t a large group of agents, and they were discrete. It was both reassuring and annoying, having someone watch your back while knowing someone unknown was behind your back at all times.
She arranged them and fixed the camera on the tripod. “Okay, on three say ‘Avengers’! And because that doesn’t work, also smile. One, two…” The shutter went on a couple of times. Pepper went through the photos she took and consulted Darcy. “Okay we got it! Now for the other ones.” She urged them all to gather up once more for their personal photos before setting the timer. “Go crazy, guys, it’s our first Christmas together.”
They tried to figure out what he wanted to do for his birthday the closer it got. At first he was vague about it. Then, when they insisted, he explained he didn’t want a party. They compromised on dinner with party hats and watching the fireworks together to celebrate.
He went in to help train the hand-picked members of a tac team with Natasha. They were cocky, bordering on rude. Nat took two of them out of commission for a month. He made two of them resign before they were fired on very strong accusations of sexism and damn near sexual harassment. One of them cried. It was beautiful to watch, and it made wonders to Steve’s scattered mind. At the end of the day he discreetly high-fived Natasha. Fury’s yelling could reportedly be heard two floors down.
“What are you - what is that?” Steve asked and it was his turn to be shocked. It was such a sore sight his mind must have overlooked it completely. Perching dangerously in the thin top of the tv there was the most surreal fish shaped blown glass ornament. It was painted in bright oranges and blues, and under it, dangling slightly over the edge of the screen but mostly on the back of the tv, a yellowed doily.
He threw his hands up in despair. “I’ve been wanting to kiss you and hold you and touch you since I first saw you on that goddamn helicarrier, all those years ago and —“
Steve was cold. He was tired - exhausted, actually, and on top of feeling cold because of that, he was
The man was decadent; one leg bent at the knee, his strong thighs flexed to support his position, the t-shirt riding up a bit to show tantalising skin. Steve really couldn’t be blamed for pushing the trousers down to his knees and cupping his half-hard cock through his boxers. He forced himself to focus, shimmying enough to make the fabric fall to his ankles before toeing his shoes off and stepping out of the trousers.
“How do you know it was a mall?” Steve bit his lip to stop from laughing at the petulant expression on the man’s face. “Tony? Did you break into the security footage?”
Tony’s laugh made his toes tingle. “Yeah, no shit. Come on, my turn to feed you.” He grabbed Steve’s hand and lifted it to kiss his knuckles. “Run away with me,” he repeated Steve’s words from earlier.
Steve’s heart fluttered. Eight. “Steve’s little smiles when he thinks no one is watching are sometimes the best thing about my day.” Shot. “I fucking hate this stuff, it gets me so stupid,” he complained and went back down for another pushup. He was slower now, sluggish, and Steve wanted to pick him up and hold him and bury his face in his neck.
“Yes! I spent the last six months of my life trying to find a way to be close to you, and you go and do some dumb shit that I can’t even begin to understand.” She turned to Steve. “Like, how do you even name a star after someone?” Steve shrugged helplessly.
It turned out everyone was excited about it, so Steve went with it. He volunteered to be in her line of fire, shield up for when she reacted to the surprise. It went as well as expected: she walked into the dim room, shot at his shield, and pretended to be very surprised while wearing a cocktail dress and high heels. Her smile was bright however, and Steve found it endearing.
They kept an eye on Bruce as Darcy and Bucky eased into a swing dance. He had a small smile on, wiping at his glasses absentmindedly. Without the threat of a Hulk-out (and Steve was certain Bruce had more self-control than to lose his shit over this), it was actually amusing to watch. His eyes swept Darcy’s figure up and down as she moved, looking like he was trying to convince himself of something or the other. Steve grudgingly admired Bucky’s plan, but even if it worked out fine for everyone, he was still going to get punched in the non-metal shoulder for being a dick.
“Hey, bad publicity is still publicity.” He paused. “I need to stop watching crap tv shows,” he concluded, and followed Steve back inside. “If you weren’t fed super serum, you could pass as drunk!”
“My mom used to do this when I was sick. It was very often, so she had time to figure out what kind of physical contact helped,” he explained.
Steve turned to check what the frown was for. He tried not to join in the scowling, but it was impossible. There were reporters everywhere, swarming around their location, taking photos and trying to get close. Behind them, the firefighters kept rushing to put the fire out. Natasha had called the team back home, but his phone was still going wild in his pocket. He refused to check it.
Steve had a new appreciation for Tony’s extravagant nature when he caught sight of the size of the bed. He gently deposited him on the soft comforter, trying to figure out the best way to proceed.
Even the man’s panting as he tried to catch his breath was attractive. “Oh, I’m gonna plug you one day and keep you like that. Take you in the lab with me to help me move some heavy equipment I made sure I left everywhere. And I’ll watch you bend over time and again and twitch whenever the plug moves inside you.”
Steve tried to help the chuckle that escaped him. He did, but then he turned the water off and heard Bennu bleat as Tony kept asking inane questions. “Fuck off, Tony.”
Steve honestly, honest to god, as honest as he could possible be, felt like crying. He also felt like kissing Tony, and punching him a little, and hugging him, and kissing the stupid lines in the corners of his eyes, and run his hands through his hair, and Steve needed to get a fucking grasp on reality sooner rather than later.
Steve went. He felt Tony’s fingers back at his hole and he moved forward to stop him. “No need. Your cock, just want your cock.” Tony’s hips stuttered briefly. Steve reached in between them to position Tony’s cock at his entrance and he began his downward movement. His eyes rolled in the back of his head; he used Tony’s shoulder to steady himself.
But now that Tony was on the same height level, Steve could focus on him properly. He was wearing what was clearly a handmade paper birthday hat, painted in the same patriotic colours, complete with a tissue pompom. Steve shook his head, unable to speak. His chest burst, the train raced through him, around him, through him again, like a snake, and he couldn’t breathe properly, couldn’t form words. Tony was so mindblowingly beautiful, so handsome and his smile so soft. Steve ached, his ribcage pulsed furiously, his heartbeat seemed deafening, but he was unable to focus on anything but Tony. He realised at some point he must have started tearing up when he felt the wetness on his cheeks. Then he could feel his eyes welling up some more and he started crying quietly, trying to stop it, postpone it, maybe even leave so he wouldn’t do this in front of the man. But he couldn’t. He couldn’t speak, couldn’t get up. He would never be more in love with anyone, that much was clear. He wiped his tears furiously.
The witch reacted as quickly as she could given her fatigue and caught the tree at the right time again. “Shit, sorry! I forgot!” She made it revolve slowly in the air trying to find the best side to be facing the room. “It’s a pretty tree,” she told Steve with a small smile. “Do you have any preferences?”
Steve was on his feet immediately, starting towards the door just as it opened. Tony walked in holding a Stark pad, swiping left and right. “Calm down, Captain Nurse, he’s currently in surgery.” He stopped and looked around the room. “Tinder, not as fun as Pepper made it sound.” At Steve’s irritated arm-folding, he sighed. “Even if we all rush and stare through a window right now, there’s nothing we can do to help.”
“I know, darling. I know,” he said, and moved away briefly to dribble more lube on his fingers. Then he picked up the pace, feeling more like what Steve wanted. He was almost there, he could feel nerve endings flare up every time the fingers were all the way in.
throwing a tantrum,” Darcy countered with a smile. “But, hey! It’s fine. Christmas is cool and wanting to celebrate a family holiday is cool. The fifteen feet of snow outside? Less cool, but I figure if I’m breaking a leg one of you will carry me home. So, win-win!”
Steve actually had to get up to take a closer look. He stood next to Tony and unwittingly mimicking his position, head cocked to the left in an attempt to make sense of it all. He identified a somewhat faded ballerina and a dog that looked crippled and sad among the figurines.
Steve didn’t know how it happened, but he just found himself blurting, “I forgot to give you your present!”
“I am literally two stupid sentences away from flying back to New York and hiding in Brooklyn for the foreseeable future.”
Steve went. He may have done it somewhat on purpose, using one of the small towels available around his hips and strutting out like he wasn’t feeling nervous to hell and back. Tony’s hands landed on his shoulders when he was in reaching distance, staring at his face, then blatantly ogling him. Steve felt oddly like a specimen of sorts, but also judging by Tony’s look, he felt wanted. He ached for more of the man’s touch. When the hand came up to cup his jaw, he leaned into it with a sigh.
“Oh, definitely! The biggest fan.” He moved Steve’s hand to replace it with his own. Steve found he was unable to hold himself up any longer, so he rested on the back of the sofa, palm still rubbing Tony’s dick through his boxers. “Come on, darling, take them off,” Tony encouraged.
“It’s just the right shade of gaudy for you, then,” Bruce told him with no real heat behind the words.
There’s a latent nervousness in the back of his mind, stemming from his inability to see Steve. Until he remembers he can figure that out and asks Friday to get him a visual. He tunes in just in time to watch the man use his shield as he helps Vision move Thor. It’s a bit like watching a movie, shot in shit quality and with the man he loves as an unfortunate protagonist. Steve is being pulled back by an out-of-nowhere larger bot. Tony wants to punch Doom with
Steve kept quiet as he ate the candy, meticulously avoiding both looking at Tony and answering. When the silence had stretched on for long enough, and he was certain he wouldn’t choke up if he started speaking, he finally did it. “Thank you, Tony.”
The prime-minister shook his head. “Captain Rogers doesn’t sound nearly as impressive as Captain America,” he countered.
Steve had been prepping for the dinner for days. He had a lot of help from Darcy and Clint and even Vision, and it was a labour of love but he was extremely ready to not cook for a while. He was also nervous about the food; he tried cooking people’s favourites, and foods that were traditional to where they were from. Some ingredients were impossible to get, and he improvised the best he could. When they sat down to eat, Steve was so tense he could barely touch anything. It was a litany of appreciative noises from around the table, and Steve felt his shoulders relax slightly.
“Come here.” He pulled Tony close and kissed the dip of his waist. He rubbed his cheek on the man’s hip, going to unbutton his trousers.
“I’m not dismissing your feelings, Steve,” Tony said, grabbing his hand to hold tightly. “But I need you to know there’s nothing you can’t tell me.”
They were left with the dilemma of how to get it back, and for the first time, Steve could see his plan was perhaps ill-conceived. It would take entirely too much time, and lugging it around through the masses of tourists and shoppers alike would be hell. Bruce half-jokingly offered to commandeer a van in the name of the law, wearing the least plausible law-enforcement expression Steve had ever seen.
“I love you. Feels like –” Steve was floating. There was no other better way of putting it. He lost track of time, lost himself in the cadence of Tony’s voice. “Please,” he whispered in Tony’s ear.
“Oh, good. I was worried your heartfelt compliments were over – so glad to see that’s not the case. So glad I’m alright, I was actually up all night trying to figure out how you see me.”
“I remembered too,” Steve informed him, picking a bag at random. “I just didn’t get you any because you’re a dick.”
“Any day you want, sweetheart.” He pulled Tony to his chest, snorting at the squelch. “Quick shower first? I’d like to be able to move and this drying lube is a bit risky.”
He was beyond mortified. More than the vulnerability - and that he could deal with, relying on someone to have your back in life or death situations kind of meant you allowed yourself to be vulnerable around them -, he was
“Guys,” Clint tried, but Tony had leaned over Steve to look Peter in the eye. On his part, the teenager was blushing furiously, as Steve had predicted he would. But given Tony’s proximity, so was he.
Steve scoffed. “You know my acclimatisation was rushed and I don’t have the time to watch as much as I want,” he said as he crossed his arms.
“We’ll start you off easy - should be pretty simple. All you have to do is take that monstrosity of a shirt off. And maybe burn it. And when we get home tell Sam he is a bitter disappointment.”
“Well, he’s alive and safe but I really don’t know if he’s okay.” She paused and looked at the floor briefly before focusing on his face once more with renewed determination. “Tony sometimes gets like this. It used to be drunken stupors and sleeping around, then it was putting the suit on and going after some bad guys, nowadays he’s been pretty stable but I don’t know. He’ll be okay, he just needs to be alone for a bit I think.”
. You,” he pointed to Tony, “stop being stubborn, you know you - we - can’t take the goat. I’m sure there are laws against bringing animals in the US without having put them through customs or something.”
He managed to leave when the vet arrived, quietly and hopefully unobserved. He tried his best not to rush to his room, not to attract attention. When Vision enquired about his well-being, he lied through his teeth and explained he felt exhausted, but he was otherwise okay.
Steve had a flash memory of reading Animal Farm in his SHIELD issued bed in the middle of the night. He nodded minutely. “Captain Rogers, if you’re technical,” he offered with a forced smile.
“Stop me at any time, Tony. I mean it.” When the man nodded, he proceeded. For some reason, it was the most intimate thing Steve had ever done. Indeed, stolen kisses and hurried fucks in closets and standard issue army rooms were not really representative of his experiences with intimacy. He kissed the smooth skin on the most outward part of the area. Then he moved in, touching the scar tissue carefully before placing small kisses on the skin that bordered the arc reactor. His palm was rolling Tony’s right nipple lazily as he licked around the arc reactor.
It took a while before he was able to leave the bathroom, and he spent way too much time choosing a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt, all in the name of postponing leaving his room to find Tony and thank him for being a good friend the night before. When he was certain that short of going back to what would probably be a restless sleep, there was nothing else he could do to put it off, he finally braved the door.
He tried, he really did. But he still found himself rolling his eyes as he replied, “I do fight crime,” he said and regretted instantly. There was no reason to be rude to the old lady.
Steve forced himself to move. He turned towards the man, an abrupt jerk of his entire body to the right. He plopped unattractively in what he was sure looked like a dying fish. “I’m sorry! It’s okay, you can always hug me.” He shut his eyes when Tony’s face started to look pitying.
Steve opened his mouth, but Tony beat him to talking. As usual. “He’s not in the mood, Hawk, you heard the man. For someone who’s this excited about a holiday some of us don’t care about, he sure is missing his famous mood.”
Steve pocketed his phone, determined to find a suitable tree. And to ignore the question about how Tony knew where they were. Tony could find out everything if he wanted. It would surprise literally no one if he had microscopic tracking devices hidden on all of them. His phone went off again, and Steve nearly facepalmed. All phones had GPS. All phones were Stark issued. Steve had half a thought to hurl it in the snow and confuse the hell out of Tony. It went off again, and then again. Behind him, Bruce and Darcy were dealing with the same problem. The cacophony of sounds was unbearable.
Steve nodded, unable to look away from the man’s eyes. The fingers spread then, combing down through his hair. He shuddered.
Tony mumbled in her hand before gently removing it and clearing his voice. “And when would this photoshoot take place, Christmas is happening soon in case you missed the memo,” he said and waved frantically towards the large tree.
“So help me God, Steve, if you apologise one more time, I’ll actually tie you up and — I’ve got supersoldier-grade ties, you know, I could do it.”
He lifts the faceplate. “You’re the one that I want,” he sings offkey, smiling as genuinely as he can before he takes off once more.
Bucky’s other hand grabbed his arm. “You’re not. Steve, just breathe with me. Four seconds in, hold for seven, exhale. Come on, let’s get you some fresh air.”
“You’re not my handler, Stark. I acted in the best interest of the endangered party,” he defended himself tightly.
Steve and Natasha both answered “no” at the same time, not even looking at Tony, with the casual air only people used to antagonise their teammates could have.
They played some music as they served yet more food that Steve ignored with a heavy consciousness. He had half a thought to ask them to take all the extra food to the people celebrating outside. The speeches were televised and in between they were shown footage of the crowds. He bit his tongue and sipped his tea.
Steve had to smile at the bite. The AI was truly Tony’s child, maybe even more than Jarvis. Where Jarvis was built with part of the real man in mind, Friday was purely Tony’s snark progeny. The closer he got to the kitchen, the harder his heart beat, the harder it was to breathe, the sicker he felt. He slowed down to what probably looked like a comical shuffle of feet. Eventually, through some sort of bravery he definitely didn’t possess - the same one Darcy claimed made him a full-fledged Gryffindor - he stepped in the brightly lit room.
“Stark give me the damn plate before I eat all the skin off this bird in front of you and make you watch,” Steve said in a normal voice.
Well, that makes him feel like an asshole. He doesn’t want to upset Steve; not now, not ever. Yes, they’re equally stubborn and concerned for the other’s wellbeing, as well as for their family’s safety, and Tony understands where Steve’s coming from. The thought of Steve getting hurt makes him feel sick. So he nods. “Okay, yeah. I’m sorry,” he says and touches the man’s shoulder briefly.
“I’m okay,” he sighed. “Honestly. I mean, I’m exhausted and still shaken and supremely embarrassed, and I’ll probably feel guilty and ashamed for the next six months, but I’m okay.”
The kids smiled and started shouting their names at him. He shook every single one of their little hands and accepted that Ben, who was almost five, wanted to hug him. He picked up the kid and walked back to sit down opposite to Tony.
Tony’s eyes flew open. “What? No, I’m just thinking of you tied up to my bed now, I needed a moment.”
Steve pondered how much truth there was in those words. Not that he believed Tony would lie to him maliciously, but he was concerned he would compromise for Steve’s sake. He moved up enough to leave the man completely topless, the t-shirt he had on did nothing but hinder their closeness. The skin to skin feeling was majestic, it made Steve feel complete, like that was where he belonged. He returned to his previous task.
“Did I have fun? Steve, are you serious? I think I fell in love with you all over again so hard, there’s a universe where we don’t even know each other and other-universe-me woke up hard and in love.”
“I just forget how accepting you are of things,” Tony offered as a very subtle apology in case he offended Steve. “Pepper looks after them through the foundation. They’ve either been abandoned or orphaned. A couple of them… their parents were killed in action. She called this morning and asked if she could bring them over. Their caretakers were delighted with the idea and I said yes because Christmas is hard.”
“As soon as Pietro’s feeling up to it and we get everyone together. We don’t need it until the 31st, so you have plenty of time to try and get out of it and ultimately agree because you know how much it means to me.”
“STEVE, FOR FUCK’S SAKE,” he heard, and it sounded like wind was rushing in his ears as well. He had taken off as soon as he saw the kid was in danger, even if he would not make it to him in time. He had to try. The remnants of snow under his boots didn’t help at all. He was thirty feet away when he heard Tony shout “duck, roll!” again and he did, throwing himself to the left and rolling away from the incoming aerial assault.
“Good, evidence,” Tony said absentmindedly as he approached the flat screen tv. “Oh my god, look!” He tapped Steve’s forearm repeatedly until the latter reacted.
“Mhm, this one’s drunk and I’m greedy so I’ll ask again: truth or dare?” Tony scoffed but stayed silent and waved her on.
Tony burst into uncontrollable giggles. “That’s possible the most precious thing you’ve ever said.” He yawned loudly. “Nap first, kinky stuff later.”
He was unsettled by what Matilda said. He opened his mouth to reply, but he didn’t get too far before their impromptu session of fortune telling was interrupted by a series of loud bangs. He stood at once, running outside where Natasha was already alert, checking their surroundings. He did his usual headcount, almost didn’t do it in fact, certain they were together. They had been for the entirety of the trip, and he relaxed for half a second before he realised that for the first time since they left New York, they were not
Tony choked on tequila and turned his back to Natasha for help. She hit between his shoulder blades a couple of times. “Thank you,” he told her. “I feel I’m watching Grumpy Old Men on cable during a storm when there’s nothing else on.”
The situation started off normal, he woke up, realised it was his birthday, groaned. He did some stretches, went to relieve himself, then brushed his teeth. He was contemplating a shower when the loud-loud alarms went off. He went into fight mode immediately.
Obeying suggestions barked as orders was ingrained in Steve’s reflexes. It came not only from the military training he received, but from trusting his team. So he ducked and got up shield first to shove a bot off him. “Ah, I see. So you’re not flirting, good to know,” he said trying to be as neutral as possible and not give in to the sinking feeling in his stomach. “Thanks,” he said and took off to where Wanda was making two bots bash into each other three feet off the ground.
Steve had joined his tight fist with his lips, and a particular sharp twist was what pushed Tony over the edge. Warm come filled his mouth and he swallowed it greedily, loving the way Tony’s hips bucked helplessly as he pulled away from his dick. He moved up on the bed; Tony was shaking, his head thrown back. He gently pushed him down so he was lying on his back.
Tony’s lips were on his immediately. He cradled Steve’s head, opening his mouth with his own. His tongue worked Steve’s relentlessly. “You ready?”
He was about to open his mouth to impart some sarcasm, now truly a common occurrence, as they liked reminding him. They said Tony rubbed off on him, and really they should know better than to open the door so widely for crudeness and innuendos. But there was something in the way Tony said “ban”, a nuance of familiarity that dawned on him seemingly out of nowhere. It had been months since that surreal first day — he’d say “time” instead, but then he’d be stuck internally debating which of the first times that was. So he’d settled on the first day right after waking up with broken ribs and a fucked up clavicle, rabidly searching his surroundings for Tony. But still the word brought him back, and that’s how the penny dropped.
“Is that why you always seemed a bit unimpressed when Cap scolded you?” Peter nodded, absently following Bennu around ready to catch her. “I have no idea where you learned to defy authority,” Tony deadpanned, disbelieving eyes fixated on him.
He managed to gently dislodge the woman. He could hear the crowd cheering, Tony speaking, the woman speaking, his teammates speaking. Steve couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t comprehend anything that was being said anymore, and he couldn’t breathe. God damn it, this was just like before the serum, when his asthma was horrible. This must have been it, his asthma was probably back. Steve thought he could feel his body shrink as the effect of the serum wore off, because this was the only explanation that made sense. He was reverting back to small pathetic asthmatic Steve. If he thought he had no chance with Tony before, this was just a whole new level of impossible.
Steve got up and refilled their drinks. He rolled his eyes at Tony’s eyebrow wiggle. “Jackie, short for Jacqueline. Also, in her words, raging lesbian,” he explained. “Pretty sure part of the reason she joined the dance company was for the company.” The accompanying laugh seemed to soften Tony’s expression. Or so it seemed in the light.
“I’m sorry, Colonel,” Steve replies instantly. “Get me close to that one,” he points at a large Doombot.
Maria Hill of all people chose to lean forward, resting her elbows on her knees. “Dick sucking, Thor.” She prodded a jelly dick with her finger and then looked up at the god. “But
He took to doing that in a South-facing room with large windows where they had added plants over the years. Steve sat in the sun and took whatever sleep he could there. Natasha asked if she could join him sometimes and he readily agreed, feeling safe with her next to him. They sat in companionable silence; Steve would watch her knit, mesmerised by the way her fingers moved, deadly effective. He knew those same hands were capable of soothing. He would fall asleep like that, warm and free and safe, and when his sleep stayed dreamless, he had a brief window of time when he was well-rested.
“Fuck me, I love it when you go all Captain on me and order things. I swear whenever you lead us into any battle, I’m grateful my suit is shaped the way it is because I get so hard it hurts.”
They walked past a small wooden stall, draped with heavy velvet curtains. It had a large cardboard crystal ball adorning its front. Steve had seen palm readers stalls before, the girls he was on tour with were keen on finding out their future whenever they encountered one. He stayed away, uncertain he even had a future and extremely certain it was all a massive scam. He didn’t need some hack telling him their gloomy ideas for his future.
Tony mouth moved lower on his neck; he licked the dimple at the base, then continued downwards, flicking his tongue on every droplet he found. Steve could feel himself getting hard and the towel was not going to do much. He had no inclination to stop Tony, not when his hands were so hot as they roamed on his body. Steve braced himself on the table and caught his lips in a kiss.
“Yes, light of my life?” He knows he’s playing a dangerous game, annoying Steve like that. He can’t help himself, though. Not really. He’s been waiting, hopeful despite knowing better, for the moment when he’d be able to rile Steve up and the subsequent heated look would lead to more than just shamefully coming all over his fist in the loneliness of his lab at night.
“Go work for a living, maybe I’ll even forgive you giving me my present late,” Tony said in between the commentary of the fight.
The camera’s initial purpose was to figure out what Thor was doing wrong to the toaster and microwave. It turned out it was actually Bruce who fucked up unknowingly, and after the roasting sessions died down, they just kind of let it there. It wasn’t actively monitored by anyone, but in a frat-like house, it almost made sense to be able to find out who finished the milk and didn’t replace it. (It was Bucky. 88% of the time.)
“You’ll see. This should be safe to use on food, I did all the calculations, then I had Friday run them too.” He worked methodically, pulling out a tray from under a deconstructed suit. He looked at the circuits briefly, then shook his head to clear it and kept at it. “I mean, now you know I have a secret fridge under this particular desk, but I trust you with my life, of course I’m gonna trust you with my fridge. And I got it to keep this batter cold and well, now it’s full of soda and cold cuts for when I get hangry so…”
To say it was surreal was probably the biggest understatement in history. He’d gone from despair to irritation to elation in the space of mere hours. He didn’t actually know how much time he’d spent falling in love with Tony over and over again. The windows had been tinted, and if he was completely honest, he didn’t even want to know. If this was all he got, he would enjoy it and cherish it for the rest of his life.
“Duck,” was all Darcy managed and laughed again. He just accepted that she was insane and moved deeper into the tree market.
He didn’t have a chance to finish the sentence. Tony had stalked the couple of feet that were separating them, and pushed up on his toes to reach Steve’s face.
Steve regarded them slyly. They’d drop it for now, bring it up in a couple of days again. Some of them knew better. Bruce knew better to be precise; he’d still leave a mug or a t-shirt or both for the man, small bow glued to them, no note or anything. And Tony knew who they were from, but he never approached the subject, never thanked Bruce, and always added them to his ever growing collections of mugs and soft tops.
Tony laughed. “Yeah, I found it appropriate. Everyone’s got a different tune so I know who it is when they enter.”
The movie was fine, Steve wasn’t blown away by it. He had seen enough 90s movies to pick up on the filmography and effects, the way people dressed, as well as the general disaster genre aspect of the movie. Rhodey was adamant he did not look like Emmit Reese, causing great amusement among them all.
“Steve,” Tony barks, unable to voice any more than that. He wants to, but words get caught in the quicksand of his throat and he’s quieted by the weight of his worst failure. He tries to claw at Bucky’s unyielding hold.
“It’s okay. You’re okay. I’ve got you, Steve. Nothing will happen to you here, not on my watch. I’ve got you,” he kept repeating.
The whole thing was arousing in a way he supposed, but these were people he would be giving coffee to the following day when their hangovers wanted to kill them. They were the people he lived with, worked with, went to die for, trusted, and cherished. And for some reason, watching them try to deepthroat wasn’t exactly touching yourself material. Especially when half of them were at various degrees of hysterics, abandoning their task altogether in favour of laughter. Darcy was… different because Darcy was putting on a show. And Steve was many things, but not made of stone.
The vet - June, Steve had found out - had declared her healthy and almost fit to work, which Steve assumed was an inside joke of sorts, because Tony had laughed. It was a beautiful sound regardless of who had caused it, so he smiled in return. She left after recommending a balanced diet and ways to handle her in order to ensure she would not be hurt.
“I know the guy who makes some of these, made a couple of phone calls, Pepper may have to go on a date with him but all in all, it was a good deal,” he explained.
, and Steve couldn’t fathom appearing weak in front of Tony. Not more than he’d already done. He stayed quiet.
Steve yawned, choosing not to comment on what Tony had said, the man seemed embarrassed enough as it was. He’d overthink about it for days, though. “Do you think I can crash here for a bit?”
Natasha tilted his head so the puppy eyes she was sporting were more effective. Her wavy hair fell on her shoulder, and her lower lip moved forward the tiniest bit.
“Not like that! I mean, yes, like that too. I was thinking of our recent interactions.” He continued kissing up on the inside of Steve’s calf, speaking in between kisses. “Sometimes I can be… not-nice. Sarcastic, maybe.”
Tony’s mind automatically goes to earlier, when he’s said the same words to his boyfriend. No matter how many times he says it in his head, he’ll probably always feel a rush. Boyfriend. At his age. At
“Oh. Uhm, okay?” He couldn’t help but think of the string of conquests the media claimed Tony had. How many of them were blonde and pretty.
A woman in the cabinet took the stage, followed by another. They boastfully lauded the success of their government, the steps taken to ensure this and that and he distinctly heard Tony grind his teeth next to him. He listened enough to fuel his rage and know his enemies, so to say, but his attention was solely on his teammates. While they both seemed supremely calm and with the programme, their tiny tells stood out to Steve, who had put his life in their hands time and again.
“I’m sorry if I overstepped my boundaries,” he said, trying to talk exclusively to her although impossible in the group of people surrounding them. It also seemed unnecessary to apologise to this young woman, citizen of the country whose officials he slandered on tv. But he had to apologise because he had done fucked up, as Sam’s eloquently put it the last time he was accidentally insensitive, and this was a way to start doing it. “I shouldn’t have been so aggressive,” and for a second he thought of when he was tiny and how much more aggressive he was then.
He was so tempted to say something crude, but it would only further hide the real cause of his nerves, and Tony deserved better than a poor attempt at deflection. “It’s silly,” he started, and wow, now was definitely not a good time to observe once more how Tony could communicate solely with his eyes. “Ah, for fuck’s sake. I want to offer you a bargain for the birthday ban lift, and —“
Steve rolled his eyes. “Just a bit surreal,” he replied. “And what expression? I didn’t have any particular expression?” he scoffed.
Tony grabbed his hair and pulled towards him. Steve went without any opposition, more than happy to let Tony move him around however he wanted. He felt the man’s naked torso as he leaned back, sliding even lower on Tony’s fingers. He lifted his hips, slamming down on them again and again.
Steve could feel it starting in his toes, like a devastating wave of pleasure, gathering momentum as it travelled up through his body. He kissed Tony hard as he came, moaning into his mouth. The man joined him, tongue relentless as it moved with Steve’s. It was easily one the greatest moments Steve had ever experienced. He doubted anything could compare with the high of coming together with a person you loved.
forgive him if he did.” Steve swore Bruce’s eyes flashed green before returning to the usual brown. “Now can we go before I sweat my skin off?”
Politicians were slimy and disgusting everywhere, Steve knew this first hand, but there was something special about the rows and rows of corrupt members of Parliament, of state secretaries, ministers, just waiting for their turn to greet them. Some had ugly grins on, some sneered openly. There was great social unrest, and in light of the recent development under a government that wasn’t
There was a reply, maybe more things that people said behind him, the door shutting. All he could hear was his blood rushing in his ears, the heat running up the back of his neck and burning the base of his skull. He was vaguely worried he was going to snap the tree because his anger sometimes made him to that. Just tear wood apart like some sort of savage. It was one of those things that kept him up at three in the morning when he cringed so hard his cheeks went red and he had to duck his head in the pillow.
“I’m not just gonna sit and hope everything’s cool.” She shrugged, then ruffled his hair affectionately. “Not when I could inquire a bit and nip any potential argument before it has time to form.”
Steve never did Christmas, and now he had a family and as annoying and uncooperating as they were, he would see his plan through and make it happen. If they wanted to join him, they were more than welcome.
As soon as they joined the others at the bar downstairs, Steve knew something was off. Not in an impending attack way, but in a someone-left-a-banana-peel-outside-your-room-oops way. He naturally turned to Natasha to assess the situation. But Natasha was smiling ominously, and Steve was suddenly a lot more concerned.
Fucking surreal. He’d seen Tony in suits before, even in a tux. He’d seen extensive footage and he’d even seen it in person. He wished Howard was alive so he could punch him in his smirking face for fucking his brain up with his stupid serum. He knew it wasn’t just Howard, but his mind was racing and he was gone. He also wanted to pick him up after the punch and shout that he was in love with his son and there was nothing anyone could do. Other than Tony, who could reject him, of course. Or a villain who could find out and seek revenge.
“I’ve got a bigger bed.” When Steve tensed, he stopped. “We don’t have to do anything,” he said kindly. “It’s just more comfortable, that’s all. You’re not exactly small-built,” he repeated Steve’s words from the hotel. He ran his hands on Steve’s shoulders and arms, licking his lips as he did it.
Tony laughed. “What, you’d report me for lewd behaviour? You have a ridiculous physique and a small golden-lab-who’s-been-kicked-out face. How is that inappropriate? Or flirting? Or middle of battle, you’re not even moving - Steve duck!”
“You want to elaborate on that?” The voice was soft and caring, and Steve felt no pressure to share, but he wanted to, he really wanted to tell Tony. “You had a panic attack, didn’t you?”
It turned out the tv wasn’t connected to anything, so it showed a bright black screen with instructions in a language neither of them spoke. Tony sighed and went to unplug it “before it caught fire”. The initial gasp and then the second and third louder and more pronounced gasps signalled Steve he should offer his undivided attention.
“Honestly, I was just looking through footage of the attack.” He walked to Wanda and touched her shoulder carefully. “A job well done, kid,” he told her. “How about a shower and sleep? And maybe some stitches? I promise I’ll make them give you the nice local anesthetic and a lollipop at the end? Maybe an Iron Man bandaid?”
“Yes, yes, now come along.” When there was no sign of success Tony sighed, cocked his head, tutted, sighed again, and lightly backhanded Steve’s shoulder in the quickest succession Steve had seen. “Wanda!”
“True, true,” the man agreed hurriedly, then retrieved some papers from his inner pocket. He seemed hesitant. “I was – that is, we were hoping you could get up and deliver a speech to consolidate our common efforts.” The eloquence was mostly there, delivered with a hint of an accent. “To cement our relationship since we have the same goals, no?” he asked, the Slavic lilt harsher on that last word.
Steve felt it everywhere. By now the train was familiar, and he felt like a broken record thinking it over and over again. The entire thing was surreal as fuck. He was involved in a kiss he wasn’t exactly reciprocating while falling in love with Tony
Wanda emerged from the lab wearing an old t-shirt of Tony’s and hair sticking out everywhere. She looked younger than usual, even with the bandages on her arm, and Steve felt a spike of endearment towards her. She walked up to them, fiddling with the hem of the top. “Pietro’s going to be alright,” she said quietly. “The last time we had a tree was when we were six,” she offered.
The old woman still held his arm in her tight grip. “Come Captain,” she said, consonants harsh and lips pulled in a tight smile. “Come.”
He started on Wikipedia and went on to read articles about why Tinder was destroying human interaction, and other articles about how Tinder was a godsent for people who were busy or had trouble establishing human contact without the added feeling of security that distance and a possibility to sever the connection of any time gave them. He spent at least half an hour entertaining the possibility that Tony was into choking, and another half an hour trying to convince himself not to masturbate furiously.
“Steve, I don’t know where your mind went, but I’m currently half-naked and hard in bed with you, about to take my sweet ass time ravaging you.”
. He managed to pull himself together when the man reached him and getting him to safety took priority. Steve should have been turned off by the smell and the reckless behaviour and everything, really. But this was Tony and Steve was weak for Tony.
Tony sat up, rearranging the goat. “You’re free to take them if you want to, Darling. We just figured you could use a break from harassing assholes.”
“And,” she continued unfazed, “after each one you do a leap and say something nice about one of us.”
“Shut up, Stark!” Then it dawned on Steve. “You hate being handed things,” he said simply, as if Tony was a normal human being who picked up on the subtleties of human interaction.
“Who the fuck is Chloe?” Tony asked with a laugh. “And gimme that,” he said, reaching for Steve’s knee again.
Steve bit his lip until it hurt. “I’m okay, Tony,” he sighed. “My brain is in overdrive and it’s tiring.” He disagreed with pretty much everything the other man said but it was neither the time nor the place for an argument, harmless as it may have been.
“We’re going, we’re going!” Tony said, and as soon as his faceplate was lowered he took off. His voice came through the coms almost immediately. “You’re not allowed to talk to any of the sarcastic people in our team. And you’re grounded! Both of you!”
She nodded. “Let’s make it interesting. I’ll bet my tiara and you can bet…” She looked around trying to find something. Her smile broadened. “Ah! You lose and I get to set you up on a date!”
Steve was certain he would either pass out or just run away when he saw Tony snag some mistletoe and rush to join their standing puppy pile. He switched the phone to front camera and inserted himself into the photo op. His lips puckered somewhere at Steve’s jaw, and for days after he could swear he felt them actually touch his skin.
“I had a friend called Dum Dum - well, his name was actually Timothy. Good man, had a thing for rifles.”
“My baby,” Tony coos at Wanda. “Look at her, all grown up and grumpy.” He flies them to where the girl is hovering, the fire contained in a huge bubble while she’s throwing energy balls towards the bots. Below her, the firefighters work relentlessly.
