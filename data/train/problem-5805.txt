"I'm really thankful for everything you did for me, you saved my life.", Peter continued and Wade could feel his stomach drop.
That question was far more loaded than
Peter actually managed to sleep without nightmares once he calmed Gwen down and went to bed himself. He was fucking exhausted so it was already noon when he woke up.
MJ went in for a hug and Peter didn't back down from it. That was a new thing for the both of them, or so he thought.  MJ seemed to feel just as awkward as him whenever they hugged but they still did it and each time it got easier.
Okay, this one is a bit of a filler, I just felt like we should check in on the rest of our men, also, I really fucking missed writing Wade. We'll return to Peter, MJ and Bucky in the next one, though and it's a fun one! Still, I hope you enjoy this one and leave your thoughts in the comments!
"I'll open the door and you'll remove her tracker, that's an order.", she clarified and just like that they did it.
"Is it because of me?", Peter asked carefully when the door to the kitchen was slammed open. The Black Widow stood in it's frame, a stony look on her face and a familiar file in her hand. Wade's heart skipped a beat.
"No.", Peter said at the same time as MJ replied:"Not really."
"Nah that seems rude. Like I'm discrediting him. Especially since he's so much better than me.", Peter shook his head.
He returned his attention to the man at his feet, cowering pathetically. "You shouldn't have come here.", Peter stated, his voice as sharp as a knife.
"So, I think we got everything, Strength, speed, agility, I can stick to pretty much all surfaces, webshooters and all my senses are dialled up to eleven. That'd be it. I'd prefer to not talk about how I got them, because... because I don't want to subject either of us to a panic attack.", Peter finished his explanation.
Maybe it was too late, maybe he was too far gone. His family had to think so, too. They sent him away. They were smarter than Gwen, they realized that they couldn't fix him, not on their own. He understood. It still
"Wade?", Peter's voice pulled Wade out of the poisonous sea of his thoughts. Wade only now realized that he had stopped dead in his tracks. "Are you coming?", Peter asked holding out his good hand and it took Wade a solid second to understand that Peter was offering to hold Wade's fucking hand. Like...
"Peter, it's pretty obvious. He'd just never say anything because he knows what you're like and he doesn't want to pressure you. As much as I hate admitting it, he's a good guy.", Tony tried to explain.
He also noticed that Peter, while obviously messed up, still had a sense of wonder for the world. Maybe it was only temporary, Wade hoped not, but even right now as they were talking Peter didn't stop looking out the window, taking in everything around them.
Even though Wade's childhood was pretty messed up, even though he didn't have many friends and even though the person he loved most died in his arms.
He turned around, facing Bucky and the other men who still stood in the hallway, peaking in but keeping their distance. Peter didn't look at them, he didn't want to see their faces. Peter felt like he should say something but he also didn't feel like it at all. Luckily Bucky seemed to understand that. "They said yes, we're leaving tomorrow.", he repeated, as if Peter didn't already know that. His heart skipped a beat anyways.
"It's not.", Peter shook his head.
"None of that was your fault, though. I told you that, didn't I? I told you that I didn't blame you. ", He argued and when Gwen looked at him again she looked devastated and Peter knew that it was because of him. It was heartbreaking.
"Steve, get her out of here.", Tony ordered.
"Why are you still here?" The question caught Wade off guard. Had he overstayed his welcome?
"Yeah, I called because of the room earlier?", Bucky said. He put on this fake polite tone when talking to strangers, it unnerved Peter from time to time.
"And finally, you, Wade, I'm sorry-", Peter whispered, his smile didn't fade but he looked sad, he looked heartbroken.
He knew that Tony was a stress eater and Peter also needed food as soon as he woke up. Steve also needed to do something to not feel useless. Add that to the fact that his lover seemed to be in a state of shock and Steve found himself pretty busy.
"Yes, no idea what could trigger me next but I don't want to live in a bubble, I don't want to be a tough subject, a 'too soon', I want more."
He quickly put Peter down on the shredded bed and the boy turned to one side, pressing his face into the mattress and digging his fingers into it until Wade was sure that it would rip soon. There he stayed, sobbing uncontrollably.
"What do you mean?"
"I guess so?", Peter nodded.
"Ding ding!", the woman chuckled.
Peter continued to watch movies with Wade and actually tried to pay attention to the plot. He tried to participate, be less of a ghost. It was tiring but Peter hoped that it would be worth it in the long run. Fake it 'till you make it, right?
"Why would I? I mean, from what I heard they aren't the nicest voices to have around so I'm sorry about that. But that doesn't really change how I think about you, you know?", he then replied before glancing over at Wade and he actually seemed genuine.
"Steve, I- I'm so sorry but I need to call you back. I have to take care of something first but I swear, everything will be okay.", he quickly said before hanging up. He felt bad about leaving Steve hanging like this but he had to handle this immediately. When he came back into the livingroom Peter glanced up before seeing Bucky's expression. He had to look pretty shaken because Peter immediately asked if he was okay.
Despite the dramatic end of their last conversation, Peter seemed to get somewhat better in the following days. Asking for food or just taking it was still an issue but when offered he ate. He left his room more and more, spend time in the living room, where he curled up on the couch and watched every movie Wade suggested.
"Peter?", Tony asked carefully when Peter hadn't said anything in a while.
"Okay. I'll call you, if there are any updates.", Pepper agreed before ending the call. Tony only allowed himself a minute of burying his face in his arms before sitting up again.
"I alread do- wait, how do you know that I'm immortal?", Wade asked surprised.
"Your daddy's place.", Wade replied and Peter was wide awake again.
"Yeah, of course.", Peter replied before pulling the door shut.
"Yeah, I hope it's okay.", Wade said from across the room. Peter wasn't exactly sure what he had expected but it wasn't this. For starters he had assumed that the water would be cold. Slowly, very slowly, he let himself sink into the water until he was sat in it, only his shoulders, arms and head sticking out of the bubbles. It was surprisingly not-awful and with no one near that could drown him, Peter felt almost not-panicked. He wouldn't call it calm, though.
Then again, he told himself, this was only temporary. Wade was only the delivery man and once Peter was with his father again there was no promise that he'd get to feel like this again.
"Peter?", MJ asked, an edge to her voice.
"You good?", Steve asked and Wade nodded.
Peter didn't recognize the man but for some reason he caught himself thinking:'
"Yes. In case one gets stolen! Like now. Now move!", Tony returned before they separated in the hallway.
His heart was racing in his chest, like a bird flapping in his cage uncontrollably. He couldn't see the agents anymore, or Wade, but he could still hear them, the gunshots, screams.
"You and Wade have a similar taste in music.", Peter mumbled before taking it out and putting it into the CD player of the car. A guitar started to play and Matt Maeson sang the first few lyrics of
"I'm not suicidal right now, don't worry. I didn't really mean to do it back then either. I was...on drugs...and... I don't know things just didn't feel manageable. I'm doing better now, I promise.", he quickly explained. It was as close to the truth as he could get.
This time Peter actually took the time to chew and swallow before replying. "I liked it considerably less when they came up again 15 minutes after I ate them but otherwise, yes." And there was a trace of humor in his tone, or at least a little less blankness. A start.
"A lot of time has passed Peter. Time where you weren't together, time where your presence couldn't make her stronger.", Wade said, as gently as possible.
Even though she knew all of that, even though it broke her heart to think of young Peter, tortured and experimented on and programmed like she had been, Natasha was professionally paranoid. She had to be in her line of work and there was something gnawing at the back of her mind. It was ugly and disgusting but persistent.
Like this one. When he was younger, maybe 11 or 12, this was how things would go: If Peter behaved, if he endured the medical exams without crying, if he mastered the physical tests, if he did well in their version of school, if he remained quiet and complacent, he'd get rewards. A bed, better food, a shower instead of being hosed down, Gwen. More time with her was the best reward.
Natasha slowly started to reboot her brain after a few more seconds. "I- I can't believe it, everyone thought that you were dead- How- Where was he?", that last question was directed at Tony but Peter answered anyways.
They had undressed him and put him in paperthin scrubs. Peter was shaking all over. He wanted to claw at his arms but they put him into a straitjacket. There was a collar too but Peter wouldn't have tried to use his powers anyways. This wasn't new. This was familiar. Peter had spend 10 years of his life like this. He knew that fighting was useless. That didn't mean that he could handle this. When more agents came to take him out of his cell for his treatment he couldn't keep it together. That's when things got fuzzier. Peter could remember screaming, struggling, he could remember Lorenz' strong hand grabbing the back of his neck and dragging him along. He didn't remember the way to the labs. Peter found himself in a chair that felt all too familiar, straps holding him down and that's when he wished that he could lose time. Check out. Not go through this again. Anything but this.
"We won't read it unless you're completely fine with it but whatever you could tell us right now that we might need to know would be greatly appreciated."
"Found him in a HYDRA base by accident. I was just there for the fun of killing Nazis, you know.", Deadpool shrugged. "Everything about his time there is in this. Though I'm not sure if he'd appreciate you reading this."
to me! I'm not blind Wade, I am inside my own head when I do these things and I know that they're messed up. Who in their right mind would voluntarily have someone like me around?! I'm a fucking timebomb! So please, don't fuck with me. I can take a rejection but I can't tolerated your pity."
They were all waiting for a reply from Peter but he seemed to have checked out somewhere during the exchange. When he didn't say anything for a while Wade already thought that he wasn't listening after all. Now it looked like it, too. The way he was just staring at the floor, eyes hazy and unseeing didn't exactly spell 'attentive listener'.
Next they went north. Multnomah Falls were beautiful though Peter didn't enjoy how cold it already was in Oregon. Judging my Bucky's light jacket it wasn't that bad but Peter was very sensitive to the cold.
"Hey! Look at me!", Peter ordered and her eyes actually snapped over towards him. "Do you want her to end up like me, or worse?", he asked, completely calm now, matter of fact. God, he was a fucking rollercoaster.
"You're being an idiot. He literally told you that he loves you. ", MJ argued but Peter wasn't convinced.
Peter didn't know. Everything always
"Kid?" His calm voice sounded like a scream in the silence between them and Kid looked up. Bucky prepared himself for him to flinch back, to drop the book and start shaking like he always did when he though that he did something forbidden.
"It never worked on her." Peter sounded desperate, devastated. It was awful.
"Dead Ex-Girlfriend.", Wade replied and Peter went tense under his hands.
"Who are you talking to then, if you don't mind me asking?", he didn't sound accusatory or afraid, that helped.
Anyways, I hope you enjoy this one and leave a review!
"Yeah but I blame myself. ", She confessed, her voice suddenly faint, her eyes glassy. She took a shaky breath and forced the tears down. "I close my eyes and I see you, beat up, choking on your own blood, struggling for every breath, you're dying and it's my fault. "
"Sort off...", he gasped. He couldn't breathe, his lungs were filling with water. Someone reached out for him, but all that Peter could see was Keipon, yanking his head up by his hair to taunt him, before shoving his head into the water again. "No, stay back!", Peter snapped, unsure who he was even pleading to.
Wade kneeled down in front of him and waited until Peter held out his arm, making sure that Peter was okay with being touched. He wasn't, but that didn't really matter. Wade quickly wrapped his wrists up again and by the time he was finished Peter's  eyes were falling shut.
"Oh shut it, Dom! Get outta here with your facts!", he snapped back before throwing a pillow he had been clutching after her.
"Peter?", the younger man asked, his voice cracking. He turned his attention back to the boy in the bed. Peter had opened his eyes but made no other indication that he was conscious. He just stared straight ahead. "Peter, can you hear us?", Tony asked and Bucky could see how much he longed to reach out and touch his son. But he didn't, he kept his distance.
"Peter and James Parker. Do they have a backstory? I suppose they need one, if anyone asks. ", Peter explained and Bucky was glad that that's what Peter had been thinking about.
"What...?", Wade whispered, truly confused.
Wade looked at the closed door for a moment before returning his gaze to Tony.  "I guess it went well?", he asked sarcastically and Tony rolled with his eyes.
"How would you do that?", Peter asked shakily and that was a good question. Bucky was just kind of making this up on the go.
He looked up at Keipon as he stepped through the door, hesitating for a second and turning back around to face Peter one last time. "You truly are my greatest disappointment.", Keipon told him and Peter wished that he could kill the part of him that felt bad for that.
That's how his next week went. He got up, they went to SHIELD where they were told that Peter refused to see them. He'd listen to their progress.
"You're not Bucky Barnes... I thought this was his thing.", Wade mumbled before seeing the file that was in a holder that was attached to the chamber.  He grabbed it and flipped it open.
"I don't remember a lot from when you came in until I passed out. Just- just that I thought that I was going to die, and...", Peter slowly started and by now he had lowered his eyes, not daring to look Wade in the eyes.
Natasha went over to a controlpanell next to the window. "I'll be closing the door behind you but we'll watch and listen.", she warned.
"I'm not being optimistic. He survived HYDRA for 10 years, even as a child. I think Peter doesn't get enough credit for that. I just believe in him you should try to do the same."
"I know. Okay? I get it.", Bucky sighed before reaching out with his flesh-hand to pat Wade's shoulder. It was all a little awkward, at least for Bucky. He wasn't used to comforting people and he didn't really know what to do with himself. But when Wade stumbled another step towards him he acted on instinct and pulled the other man into a hug. It was strange, to hold a guy that Bucky barely knew, a guy as dangerous and intimidating as Wade, but Wade melted into Bucky immediately, like he needed this, so Bucky held him. "It's gonna be okay. We'll get him out. It'll be fine...", Bucky whispered. Wade was trembling and Bucky wasn't entirely sure if it was just that or if Wade was crying. It didn't matter, anyways. They stood like this for a while, so long in fact that Bucky actually forgot that Steve was watching them. Wade only separated from Bucky once another pair of feet made their way into the room.
. It shot through his legs up into his spine with every step he took. Maybe he was injured, maybe not. It didn't really matter. Nothing mattered, least of all Peter. He was designed to stay functional, even when damaged.
And he was worried about Wade who was now, technically his boyfriend even though they hadn't talked about that yet, and how Wade had chosen to move back into his own apartment, putting more distance between him and Peter.
"She knows about that?", Bucky wondered, surprised that Peter would share something like that with someone who was barely more than a stranger.
Okayyyy, that's it! At least for part one. I think I'll post chapter two of this story in the next couple of days so you should subscribe to the  " Spiders, Death and Roadtrips ", series!
"Cheers to that.", Bucky replied with a smirk before combing through Peter's hair one last time. "So, go take a look.", he ordered and Peter got up from his chair and made his way to the bathroom.
"Do they live here, too?"
Peter only shrugged, his face neutral, eyes still cast towards the sky. "It's okay. It isn't your fault. Besides... It's not like she's wrong."
"Let's get you an actual bed, shall we?"
"The other thing we wanted to talk about is the HYDRA file.", Tony then announced and Peter stopped what he was doing to glance at both of them.
"Just don't blow it in my face.", she then shrugged.
Peter had never kissed anyone, he had never imagined it either. Kissing MJ was nice, her lips were soft and she was gentle with him. Peter didn't feel the need to cower away or push her off, but it wasn't like in the movie's either, he didn't feel sparks fly and fireworks go off or any of the other stuff movies always talked about.  It was okay, but Peter didn't really care for it. And he had a sneaking suspicion that for once he wasn't the problem. He felt like maybe he was just kissing the wrong person because one of his first thoughts after processing that he was kissing MJ was what it'd feel like to kiss Wade instead.
Peter waved her off. "Yeah, hello, whatever, I wanna see-", the rest of his sentence died in his throat when another door opened.
"Alright Spidey. You want proof, let's get you out of here then." Suddenly Peter wasn't on the ground anymore,  he was being carried, bridal style. Sure, it was humiliating, but Peter was way past feeling humiliated and his aching body was just glad that he wasn't dragged along.
"Of course! Can you walk by yourself?", he asked and Peter looked down at himself, his expression uncertain. He got off the bed himself, though. (Only to collaps right away, but still.) Wade caught him before he could fall down completely, putting one of the boys boney arms over his own neck so that he could support him. Peter went rigid for a second but quickly sagged against Wade.
Slowly, very slowly Wade stepped closer and closer as he spoke until they were only inches apart and then, carefully, he reached up and cupped Peter's meager face in his hands. His skin was cold against Wade's but he didn't flinch or tense, he leaned into the touche, his eyes fluttering for a second. "I wish I could believe you...", Peter sighed before meeting Wade's eyes again.
"It's somehow easier when it doesn't concern me.", he admitted with a shrug.
, how he wished that he could die.
"Wilson, get a grip, please. What are you talking about?", Tony asked, his tone sharp. When he wasn't all mopey Tony was on the agitated side, Wade couldn't blame him.
"They got wet.", Peter explained.
His issue was the shirt, it was a button up with short sleeves and it was almost oversized on him. The silky material had a sort of headache inducing pattern. Red background, yellow flowers and green leaves.
When he saw the caller ID he couldn't pick up quickly enough.  He hadn't spoken to Tony since he left but the other man promised to call as soon as he heard something new about Peter.
. Peter's eyes trailed down to the thin silvery scar on his wrist. In a few hours it would be gone completely. Then there would be no physical evidence of Peter's worst moment. Well, maybe not
Peter sat up and scrambled back until his back hit the headboard of the bed. He pulled his legs to his chest, making himself as small as possible, his eyes never left Tony.
"Hey, are you good?", Vanessa asked but her voice sounded wrong too, like it was far away, or like Peter was under water.
"Do you really think they'd answer?", Steve asked as the connection was established.
Peter didn't try to conceal the fact that he was contemplating it. Whatever his confession was, it didn't come easy. "Maybe now's the time to mention that I have superpowers."
"Judging by his vitals he's fine. He seems to be brooding.", FRIDAY explained and the tension in Tony's chest eased up a bit.
"Half-brothers.", he eventually stated. "Same dad makes sense."
Peter looked so much younger than he was in that moment. He was, what, 19? But he looked like a child, narrow shoulders, hunched over, huge eyes that looked so fucking lost. But he also wore the exhaustion of an old man, someone who has been through way too much. It was a dichotomy that was equally fascinating and heartbreaking.
"Yes, but I was also punishing you on purpose. And I think I don't want to do that anymore.", Peter confessed.
"Look, I don't know you very well. But I do know Tony and trust me Peter, that man's a mess.", he then said which seemed to catch Peter off guard. So much so that he let out a surprised chuckle, which made the invisible hold on Steve's lungs ease up a little. "Like, really. You should've seen him when you took off, he was a wreck. Understandably so of course. And I get that you can't know that. He hides it, he has to, he's the parent. But believe me, he's just as terrified as you are, we all are. It's human nature. We're all so fucking scared, especially of the unknown. And don't beat yourself up, if you feel that you can't help others right now. Sometimes you just gotta mend yourself first before you can do it for someone else.", he explained. Steve wasn't sure where the words came from, just that they felt right, important, meaningful.
The boy repeated this over and over in his mind and didn't even notice how his own fingers ran over his arm, nervously clawing at his skin.
It was all very predictable. He had taken that same stance with James years ago, she knew he'd do the same for Tony's son. Still, it tugged at Natasha's heart uncomfortably. It had taken her years to get to that point, but she considered Steve a friend, Tony, too. She wished that she could just shut her brain off and see Peter as a simple kid. Unfortunately she couldn't and unfortunately he wasn't.
The withdrawal set in two hours later and at first it was slow. The coldness slipped and made way for irritation. "What do you want?",Peter asked Wade once he returned from the bathroom. The blank expression was still there but his tone betrayed him, it wasn't quite as void as before.
At first Peter thought (or hoped) that he was just unconscious. Then he stepped closer and saw the countless bullet holes everywhere in his red and black suit. One was right in the centre of his forehead. Peter searched for a heartbeat, a breath, something. When he didn't find it he broke down, fell to his knees beside Wade's body, not caring that his pants got stained with blood.
Wade knelt down in front of him and once again waited until Peter held out his arm to make sure that it was okay. His left arm was fine, actually it was completely healed, so Wade removed the bandages. The right one was bleeding and even if it wasn't as bad as yesterday, it looked fresh. Peter didn't flinch when Wade cleaned the wound and wrapped it up again, he didn't move at all, his eyes were glassy.
like I'm not a huge inconvenience in your life.
And a week or two ago Peter wouldn't have answered it. But now? It was still difficult but he felt separated enough from the incident and so much closer to MJ than ever before, so he decided to give in, at least a little.
"That's what I've been telling him. We could star in horror movies together. I look awful and you are awful. ", Wade chuckled before lightly bumping his head against Peter's and his smile made Peter's heart flutter.
"'m good...", Bucky whispered, making no move to look up. He wasn't, obviously. But there was no reason to point that out. None of them were good. Steve shifted his weight from foot to foot before deciding to join Bucky on the ground. Now they were sitting side by side. "I'm serious, Steve. I'm fine. Shouldn't you be with Tony?", Bucky asked, his voice toneless. Steve let out a sigh but Bucky still didn't look at him.
"Her name is MJ, she's a coldhearted bitch and I love her. ", Peter grinned.
"You obviously put him somewhat at ease. He doesn't trust us. I don't know, if he even trusts you but you're definitely closer. I'm not going to sabotage his recovery by cutting you off.", Tony explained simply and Wade was completely  dumbfounded. The dedication of these two was unheard of, at least according to Wade's life experiences.
"Don't-", Peter gasped but it was already too late, they had seen it.
Tony froze for a second but then he wrapped his arms around his boy, lightly patting his head.
Peter wanted to be comforted, to trust and love and rely on someone but he couldn't. His ability to do so died with Gwen.
Wade really had to treat him with
"He wants to see you. ", Tony announced an hour or so after he went to the roof to talk to Peter. Wade had been dozing off on the couch. Ever since he had started spending his nights with Death again he just couldn't seem to get enough sleep. A small sacrifice in the eyes of never seeing Peter again.
"You heard that?", he asked. Peter only rolled with his eyes.
Bucky seemed to understand that and refrained from apologizing
They gave him space. For about two hours. Then they seemed to decide that it was probably time to confront the moody teen that was brooding on their roof. Peter knew that eventually someone would come for him. He expected Wade or Bucky, he didnt expect it to be Tony. That's why he was surprised when his father climbed through the ceiling opening that led to the roof. "You?", Peter asked surprised. He had curled up on the ground a few feet away from the edge. Until now he had watched the sunset, his mind running on empty, it's how he liked it best.
Wade didn't know many details of what happened to Peter, the boy still didn't give them permission to read the file. But Peter had told him that there had been brainwashing and that they had trained him. That's why he wasn't sure if Peter only made himself responsible for Gwen's death or if he literally killed her. "Literally as in
"So, how is she doing?", Tony asked after a moment.
"Yeah. My mind is running a mile a minute. But Gwen's asleep now and I don't want to disturb her. ", he admitted.
Peter wasn't surprised by that comparison. He was more surprised that Tony actually said it. Positively surprised. He wasn't used to him being so direct with him. "If that's the case I think I owe you an apology.",he smirked, he didn't mean for it to sound so bitter.
"Yeah, I do. It's worth it, though.", he nodded before taking a sip of his coffee. It was delicious. Natasha somehow always made the best coffee. Tony was quite surprised when he realized despite of how angry he was with her, he had missed Natasha. They used to be so close, it was no wonder that she left a hole in his life.
"Yeah, he physically can't. We need to ride this out.", Bucky nodded, his tone bitter.
"Tony will hate me.",Bucky said with an amused smile as he watched Peter smoke the rest of the cigarette.
The only other thing he was willing to tell them was that there was probably a tracker on Peter. The boys sleep turned out to be a blessing because this seemed to be a more pressing matter than talking to him.
"I'm only 30!", Bucky exclaimed, faking offence.
When Peter came to a halt a few feet away from them nobody really knew what to do. Wade wanted to hug him but he could imagine that Peter wouldn't appreciate that at all. "Hello Peter, how are you doing?", Steve asked, his tone awkward and stilted. Peter looked at him with the bored expression not shifting at all.
Needless to say that his healing factor took care of that and Wade was nice enough to make some jokes about the incident in the following days to lessen the tension. Peter still knew that it must've been disturbing, disgusting, repulsive to see him like this. One of his first thoughts was: '
Then Wade caught himself. "That wasn't really you though, was it?", he asked. He couldn't imagine that the real Peter was capable of that and surely enough he shook his head slightly.
It was silent between them for a while, all their words hanging in the air, suffocating them. Natasha couldn't crack, she knew why, because of this. "I think you should go.",Tony then said and his voice broke. Natasha stared at him, then at Steve who had his eyes downcast. She was baffled and at the same time not surprised at all. After all, they were three remarkably different people, but especially when it came to secrets.
The most haunting thing was Peter himself though. He was just...
"Gwen and Peter stole the quinjet.", Steve explained as he and Bucky began to suit up, gathering their weapons.
"I have a really quick metabolism.", he replied before digging into his first burger. That's one thing he had actually gotten better at, eating. He still probably didn't eat as much as he should with his metabolism but he didn't have as many anxieties connected to it anymore.
"Tony's on the phone.", Bucky said, handing Peter his phone.
"Will you just drop me off or will you-", he tried to explain but his voice broke off. "-could you- ", he tried again but the shame of it all was eating away at him, it tied around his throat and choked away every word he could've come up with, only leaving hot air. "Fuck!", he yelled out of frustration before burying his face in his hands.
There is a more emotional one coming up.
"Peter, I want you to be happy, if you can't do that here then you need to leave.", Wade replied, the words easily spilled from his lips, they were the truth. It hurt to know that Peter didn't want him around him any longer but Wade would never put Peter's well being over his own feelings.
"Yes but last time it was really flashy. It's why I didn't recognize it right away. ", Wade mumbled. With the softest voice he could muster he tried to coax Peter into looking at him.
He lost time, no idea how much. Next thing he knew he was on the bed again, staring at the ceiling. His eyes burned but he didn't bother to close them, too much effort. The fire was gone, or it wasn't, but he didn't feel it as much anymore. It wasn't the same as being numb. It was like not feeling the pain of burned skin because all the nerves were destroyed. Peter wasn't sure if it was better or worse than the fire. He didn't feel better. His skin was crawling, like there was something underneath it. Peter wanted to claw his skin open, wanted to pull out whatever was rotting inside of him. He didn't have the energy.
Ahhhhhh guess who's going to see a special screening of Infinity War and Endgame tonight! I just wanna warn you that this might kill me, so if I don't update it's because I died with all my favorite characters.
" If you say so...", he mumbled, already seeming a bit sharper. As soon as he became aware of his position he tensed and Wade released him from his arms. To his relief Peter didn't retreat completely, only curling up a few inches away from Wade, his eyes trained on him.
He looked up at the screen with tired eyes and let out a sigh, rubbing a hand over his face. "Nick. This is my son. Work with me, I'm fucking begging you." So they had gotten that far. To Wade's surprise Fury actually calmed down, removing just a fraction of his edge.
"No? I mean, I don't think it's normal. But then again, what do I know, right?", he asked before turning his attention back to the road as if he was done with the topic. It couldn't be that easy.
It wasn't just that. Tony asked FRIDAY to check on Peter every once in a while when Tony didn't feel like disturbing his son's peace. According to the AI Peter avoided all mirrors, didn't sleep in his bed, curling up either on the ground or crawling into one corner of the ceiling instead.
"FRIDAY? Did they turn off the tracker?", Tony asked, holding Wade's gaze as he silently prayed for good news.
"Wade. ", Peter repeated as Wade tried another one that didn't work.
"Uhh...sorry?", Peter mumbled.
"Please...I can't- I don't want this.", he pleaded, looking down into Not-Peter's eyes.
"This does look like something Wade would like.", Bucky smiled but it wasn't teasing, there was a weird facet to his smile that Peter couldn't place. " It looks good.", he added, not sounding convincing at all.
"But what are they planning?", Peter specified, a little agitated.
Tony's mind did the same thing it did last time. It shut down.
"You don't know what foster parents are?", she asked, like she was hoping for Peter to say. "Just kidding."
Peter was doing so great, he was doing better than anyone could've imagined and Wade wouldn't ruin that.
"Shut up!", she snapped before punching him again and again and the whole time Peter just laid there taking it.
He then let go with his hands and now he was just hanging from his feet, his upside down face turned towards Tony. "You know, there's a reason he calls me Spidey.", the boy then added glancing over at Wade.
"On myself when I still had hair. Vanessa also taught me a few tricks." Her name just slipped out and Wade almost cringed when Peter asked:"Who's Vanessa?"
Peter was addictive and Wade knew that he'd be his ruin, but he'd been ruined before, it was worth it.
"Peter! God, you scared the shit out of me... I woke up and you were gone- I thought- I thought you- Peter you can't just take off. Not after-", he stammered, his eyes wide and panicked. Peter immediately got up and stepped towards Bucky. For a moment he thought that Bucky would close the distance between them and grab a hold of Peter. Luckily he didn't. His night was already so fucking fragile, he had no idea, if he could handle anyone touching him right now.
"You're weirdly quiet, what's on your mind? ", Peter asked, apparently unaware of how close they were and how it drove Wade mad.
"Understandable. But all in all you look better.", Wade commented and to his surprise Peter smirked.
"Wouldn't have it any other way."
Peter could feel the other customers staring at them, the waiter that took their order glared at both of them like they were fucking aliens.
"Noticing a pattern?", Peter asked in a teasing tone at which MJ rolled with her eyes before throwing some fries at Peter.
"Yeah, yeah, give me your hand now.", Bucky mumbled before analysing Peter's fingers. "This might hurt a bit.", he said before grabbing a hold of one of his fingers and yanking the broken bone back into place. It hurt, Peter didn't flinch, physical pain he could handle, it brought everything into focus. Bucky fixed another one before taping the two together, so that they'd stay in place until Peter healed.
There's gonna be an appearance of a popular character from the current Spider-Man movies (guess who it is!), an inspirational lady named Karen and Peter's first time acting as a hero. I hope you're as excited as I am!
his stupid brain dared to resent the only people who had ever been kind to him. He didn't hate them, or he did, or maybe this was love, or maybe it wasn't.
Peter's eyes grew large in anticipation. "Yeah! Sure, let's go!", he agreed before pushing himself off the floor.
"Who is this friend you made that showed you vines?", he asked, intrigued.
I hope you enjoyed the date chapter and leave a review with your thoughts! Your comments motivated me so much to write this chapter so quickly so keep them coming!
Instead he started to dig out the bullets in an attempt to exhilarate his healing. He healed quick either way but it was always easier when nothing was blocking the wound. Clawing through his own flesh certainly wasn't the most pleasant of experiences and Peter didn't attempt to hide the pain he was putting himself through. He didn't have to prove anything to Gwen. Still, it made him sick that she didn't even flich at his pained grunts, didn't even tell him to shut up or stop it, as if she didn't even register him.
"Damn right, I fucking am!", he exclaimed. His whole body was trembling violently and he felt like he'd completely come apart if this went on for just another second. Then he felt Wade's big hand on his shoulder and they locked eyes.
"You talk in your sleep.", She stated before straightening up and sitting down at the foot of Peter's bed
He forced his body to relax and stop shaking. "Sorry. I'll stop.", He mumbled before looking out the window again.
"Yeah. I thought we could get Gwen some clothes today, if that's okay. ", Peter asked. Why the fuck was asking for things so easy when it wasn't for himself?
"Then it isn't irrational.", Wade replied gently before taking a few steps back. "I'll just stay on my side of the room, I promise.", he said and Peter wanted to cry again. Wade was so fucking gentle with him, much kinder than Peter was used to and he didn't deserve any of it.
"I just want to say... that I know that this isn't your fault but you won't know that. Once you'll wake up, and you will, you'll blame yourself, so I need you to know, that I forgive you..." Speaking was hard, breathing was
Next thing he knew he was throwing himself at the Black Widow. Or... no...he couldn't actually remember that. But it must've happened. Because somehow he found himself held back by Steve who had locked his arms behind him.
This was
"There are CDs in my backpack. You can pick one.", Wade said and since Peter didn't know any musicians anyways he just chose the first CD he got between his fingers and put it in.
, Wade didn't want anything more than to stay and pretend. That's why he stopped killing himself for her, he knew that he couldn't stay, no matter how tempting.
"It's a tragedy.", Peter whispered, because it was. They had turned his best friend into the thing they both despised so much, against her will.
"Tell me what?", Wade asked. His mouth had gone dry, his heart was racing.
"I said he doesn't want to see you!", Tony snapped from behind the door to the living room. Then the door was pushed open and there she was. Natasha Romanoff looked exactly like on the pictures online and like Peter remembered her. She was beautiful, but in a deadly way. She'd lure you into thinking you're safe before striking. A perfect weapon. Peter thought of Gwen and his heart seized. Her eyes were wide when she stared at Peter and both Bucky and Wade shifted beside him. They got up, put themselves between Natasha and him. Peter himself was frozen, he didn't move an inch, didn't even put down the book in his hands, instead holding onto it until his knuckles turned white.
"Say what?", Peter asked.
Peter was shaking when he woke up, he's trembling violently. But around him everything was still and quiet. The room was dark, he wasn't in his HYDRA cell. Nobody was holding him down. It took Peter several seconds to remember where he was and what's going on. He's in a motel room, Bucky's on the other bed next to him, still asleep according to his snoring. So Peter didn't scream this time. That was new.
Tony couldn't focus, couldn't form an idea that would work. No tracker and the Quinjet was in stealth mode. When they tried to contact the jet Peter didn't reply.
Tony smiled, a sorrowful kind of smile, a mirror image of Peter. "I'm sure she'd disagree.", Tony said and Peter new he was right because he knew that Gwen loved him as much as he loved her. "And you know what they say, if she really was that great, takes one to know one."
"Could the superdads not gross out their superson on his first day. That'd be great.", Deadpool said and the men both glanced over to the door where Deadpool was standing next to Peter.
She looked satisfied when she looked down at him. "You pull a stunt like this again and you won't be the one getting shot.", she added before returning to the pilot's seat, leaving Peter laying on the ground. She sounded like she ment it.
It was bad enough that Tony had to deal with Peter in his life. He really didn't want to do that to anyone else.
Peter didn't mention their shift, at least not for a couple of days. Then he did. He was sitting on a stool in the kitchen, if you could call whatever he was doing sitting. One of his legs was tucked underneath him while he had pulled the other one to his chest, wrapping one arm around it and leaning his head on his knee. Like a fucking folding chair. Wade couldn't see how this was comfortable or practical in any way.
"If Peter should be left alone right now.", Steve repeated.
Tony lost time.
Wade didn't know what to make of it. It's like Peter was waiting for something and Wade could imagine what it was. He knew how it felt to wait for all hell to break loose, to constantly watch over your shoulder.
"But I am-", Wade tried again and this time Peter didn't even let him finish. "I don't want to hear it." His words were a warning.
He was reading a lot, and writing. The things he remembered filled countless journals by now. He kept them in a little suitcase in his closet, away from view, he didn't want to constantly think about them.
"Okay... Just don't get pressured to do anything you don't want, okay?", Bucky called after him.
"You'd rather have me look like this?", she asked, grinning at him, wearing Vanessa's face.
. He wanted to claw his arms open. A little voice said he shouldn't, though he couldn't remember why. So he did. It felt okay, but only for a second, it didn't lessen the pain inside of him. He clawed at his arm while something else clawed at his insides, tore them to shreds. Peter knew how it felt to be torn apart. It felt something like this.
"What alternative?", Tony asked, even though he probably knew.
"What's that even supposed to mean-?", Tony just snapped when he heard a voice speak up from behind him.
and I didn't mean to ask for you, I wanted to be okay by myself, I
"Or a big one!", Peter laughed but Wade noticed tears streaming down his face. Still he continued to laugh until it eventually died down and he only stared at Wade with the faintest shadow of a smile painted on his lips.
Wade: *bursts through the door, covered in blood, laughing manically*
Peter had gone through hell already, grew up in it, how the fuck was he still a good person?
"Sorry to disappoint you, kid.", a male voice answered a single table lamp turned on, revealing Tony Stark, sitting in an arm chair a few feet away from Peter's bed.
" No, I have a fast metabolism, you burn through calories like Alduin burned Helgen. ", MJ returned and Peter raised his eyebrows.
"When are you leaving?",  Wade asked, his voice thin and shaky. Peter still felt like crying but for a different reason now.
Steve smiled softly. "Yeah, like Bucky. He used to be just like you. If he can do it, so can you."
So he got up and excused himself, but when he reached the door he heard Tony call out for him.
That question took him by surprise. Not enough to ease any of the tension that turned Peter into single ball of nerves, though. "Don't I?", he asked and the expression on Tony's face made everything seem nonsensical.
Peter took a couple more breaths until he was sure that he wouldn't spiral again. Then he opened his eyes. He still didn't look at Wade though. And just because he was calm again didn't mean that his worries were gone.
"Your HYDRA file.", Bucky replied, his tone apologetic. It had been the most recent picture of Peter, taken right before they froze him. The Peter in the picture didn't know yet that he'd wake up to Wade's relentless rambling instead of HYDRA's cruel words. All he knew was that he had killed his only friend. He looked empty in the picture, soulless. Luckily the passport picture was too small to show that. "I'm sorry, I needed something quickly.", Bucky apologised.
Bucky didn't need to hear that twice. "I'm getting our stuff.", he announced, as reliable as always. He turned his back on the other two, storming back into the motel.
"Wade! Open the door, I know you're in there.", Domino yelled and Wade flinched. It was okay though, nobody saw that.
"So HYDRA experimented on you as well?", Steve asked, with his iconic stoic face and his 'talk to me, son'- tone.
"What are you doing up there, Spidey?", Wade asked.
"Not sure if that's a compliment but I'll take it as one.", he smirked before sitting down on the curb. He was too exhausted for this shit, his healing was taking up all his energy. MJ was nice enough to sit down beside him and he was glad to see that she didn't seem spooked.
"Why do people look at old pictures of themselves?", he asked in turn and Bucky raised his eyebrows.
"Touché.", Peter smirked and they both resumed their path along the water. They fell into a comfortable silence and Peter went back to enjoying his time outside. He couldn't know when he'd be allowed to step outside again and he wasn't foolish enough to assume that this would become a regular occurrence. Peter contemplated, if he should ask or if he should just enjoy his time out. In the end curiosity won, it often did.
"Any wishes for food?", Steve called from the kitchen.
"I mean, it ain't really. Is not like you followed some guru that tried to merk you with koolaid.", Wade argued. "But the brainwashing is similar. ", he then added and Peter rolled with his eyes turning away.
Peter seemed unable to talk about himself like this. "Ask me what I think of something. I can't- I struggle to express what is manageable and it changes all the time but I don't like it when you assume that I'm too fragile to handle anything. So please, just ask me and one day I might be able to tell you by myself."
"It was tough, but you can imagine that. He didn't remember me, he didn't remember himself. In the beginning he thought I was his handler, that was...rough. I mean... He was fucking terrified and so frustrated with himself and it's fucking heart breaking to watch someone you love go through that while not knowing how to help." While he spoke, Tony looked up at Steve. He rarely saw Steve like this anymore, vulnerable about his own frustrations, his own feelings. They both had their demons, matching mountains of PTSD and abandonment issues. Tony had to wake Steve up from nightmares just as often as Steve had to calm Tony down after a panic attack. They used to talk about that a lot, exchange their traumas. Lately Tony felt like it had all become about him, or not him but Peter and Steve was supportive as always. Tony still felt like he was neglecting Steve a bit. But he also didn't know how to stop worrying about Peter. He used to be like that before Peter was taken, too. Peter used to be and still was the most important part of his life. Now there was just a new completely rational sense of panic involved in that. "Yeah, that sums it up pretty well.", he mumbled, otherwise lost for words.
For a second Tony could only watch, until he saw that Peter was squeezing some of the shards in his shaking hands until crimson blood sprung from where the porcelain cut through his skin.
He had to be
"Alright... I'll leave my number with your dad on my way out. Don't hesitate to call, if you ever need anything or just in general. I'm always down to kill Nazis or eat waffles.", Wade chuckled slight as he got up but he had already lost the boy's attention.
After years in dark labs he wasn't used to the sunlight so Wade bought him sunglasses. Now he almost looked like one of these tumblr boys, with his messy hair and clothes, of course if it wasn't for the constant reminder that he was on the brink of starvation.
"There is no imminent threat and I'm currently ignoring my anxiety's calls, so yes, I'm bored. ", Peter went on, already a bit closer to the truth. "You know why I wore a muzzle. Because I was so goddamn annoying.", he then added.
"He was called to an Avengers mission.", Tony replied and Peter nodded slowly because he wasn't sure what else to do. That's what the call must've been about.
"Mind if I sit with you?", Tony asked and Peter shrugged but moved over an inch. Tony took that as a
"Three dozen HYDRA agents positioned all around the terrain. But I'm sensing a flock of them around the centre of the main building.", FRIDAY replied. Wade couldn't wait to get down there. Killing HYDRA goons was a hobby of his in general but today it wasn't about his enjoyment.
"Nah... he loves an idea of me.", Peter stated simply and now Wade was getting kinda annoyed.
. So tired that he didn't even attempt to combat the dread.
Natasha opened the door to her apartment and Peter didn't wait for an invitation to step in, pushing past her immediately. "Where is she-", he asked, looking around the empty living room.
That's why I'll mark parts where anything even mildly sexual happens between the two with this ** so that you can skip it if needed.
"I don't hate it.", he announced, stepping back out of the bathroom.
Peter and MJ separated but their faces still hovered close to each other, when Peter opened his eyes he was met by a frown. "You look upset.", he pointed out and apparently MJ hadn't been aware of that.
"Nah, just certainty. What did dad use to say?", Tony glanced over at his son, this young man that according to every probability should be dead, but wasn't. "Starks are made of Iron."
That helped his mental state as much as you'd imagine, which is not at all. So he started to do things to keep himself actually occupied.
His eyes were wide and frantic  he was trying to catch a breath but as soon as he focused on Wade he calmed down. Wade would've never expected anyone to be calmed by looking at his face. Peter took another shuddering breath before bending forward, burrying his face in his hands.
Their drive was silent, only Matt Maeson's music filling all that quiet. It was one of Peter's non verbal days and Bucky respected that.
He was worried about Gwen and why she still didn't want to see him after 3 months of separation.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Peter?", Wade asked surprised. He thought Peter had gone to bed with Gwen hours ago. Peter hadn't paid him much attention since they returned but Wade couldn't fault him for that. He had been pretty wrapped up in Gwen, as he should be.
"Yeah.", he nodded before coming in. Peter sat down in one of the armchairs in Wade's guest room while Wade sat down on the bed.
"Would that be that hard to believe?", Tony whispered, leaning forward. To his dismay that made Peter flinch back ever so slightly, tensing up again. Tony immediately corrected his position and Peter relaxed slightly.
Especially friends, especially people he trusted. It took him months to admit to Steve that every time they hugged it made Bucky's skin crawl, and of course Steve was horrified, which only made Bucky feel worse about it. It was all so frustrating, needing and wanting things, asking for them. Especially when you weren't allowed to do that for so long.
"Into?"
They were still in the bedroom, Peter didn't feel ready to leave it yet. The thought of facing Tony and Steve after the last couple of days sent shivers down his spine. It only now hit him how dysfunctional he had to seem in their minds. It's not like they were wrong either. Peter's behavior was unacceptable and if he didn't get it in line, sooner or later they'd grow tired of him, if they didn't already.
Little Backstory for this chapter. I actually wanted to write and post this yesterday and I had like half of it done, forgot to safe it, got pissed off by that (whenever that happens I just stop writing out of spite even though it's my own fault)
They both stopped, smiling nervously. Peter couldn't take this tension. It was so unnatural.
"And what changed?", Bucky heard himself asked and Peter's eyes fell on the book in his hands. He let it fall close before holding it up as an answer.
So Wade did as he was told, he kicked in the door and didn't look back. Three more HYDRA agents charged at him on the other side but Wade had killed dozens, he could handle a couple more.
With that thought he closed his eyes.
"Huh?", Peter asked, lifting his head slightly. Wade looked over at him.
Apparently the idea of a romantic relationship seemed to stress Peter out a lot right now. The only reason that Wade could think of why that'd come up now was because of Gwen, which in turn stressed Wade out, but he wasn't about to put his own feelings above Peter's, so he tried to help as well as he could.
"We need to stop the bleeding until you start to heal-", Bucky stated, getting to work immediately. Peter realized too late that Bucky had pulled off his jacket to press it too Peter's wound, revealing his arm to the two women now.
It didn't quite make sense to Bucky. HYDRA didn't do this to him, it didn't look like them. His theory was that the boy hadn't been in HYDRA custody when his injuries happened. This looked like an accident that he only survived because of his healing factor. The arms still didn't fit but Bucky would just have to ask him about that once he woke up, if he did wake up.
Also, I hope you enjoy this awful awful chapter, I promise it gets a bit better from now on. No magical recovery, that's too easy and unrealistic, but a bit more fluff here and there. As always, I'd really appreciate a comment, I love reading them!
Gwen didn't pull a face, her expression remained perfectly composed. "The Winter Soldier has a lot of them in his room and sneaking around is much easier when you can hear exactly where everyone is in the house.", she replied and Peter really hated how cold she seemed, it rubbed him the wrong way, but that wasn't important right now.
"Yup! I kill Nazis for sport!", Deadpool exclaimed cheerfully and even though Peter thought that he was absolutely crazy, even though he had no idea where Deadpool was taking him and what he'd do to him, even though he didn't trust him at all, it was a little satisfying.
"Peter-", Bucky called out in an attempt to stop him but Peter wasn't having any of it.
"Okay...I think I'll... Can I lay down for a bit?", Peter asked, his eyes not meeting Tony's.
Natasha's expression was unreadable, she was the perfect spy, Peter knew that if she wanted he'd have no idea what she felt. That's why he was honestly surprised when she dropped her mask. " No. I don't have excuses. I know we did wrong by you. I'm sorry,  we went about this all wrong.", she admitted and she looked and sounded guilty. Truly guilty.
"They shouldn't have called you. I'm fine.", he spat and Wade almost laughed out. Instead he got up and his movement was apparently enough of a threat to get Peter to look at him again.
"I didn't mean that it was bothering me, I'm just concerned for you.", Tony sighed. Peter didn't look at him. He didn't want to see the worry.
"Yuhh- cnt- mth- lckd-", Wade replied through sealed lips.
"Am I hearing judgement in your tone? I'm sorry but I haven't had solid foods in... I don't know how long. Let me enjoy my goddamn bananas!", he exclaimed dramatically, faking his outrage.
"You'll be okay. Most of it has healed already. You heal fast, don't you?" Still no reply. Bucky wasn't sure, if he was rushing it but he preferred to be clear right out the gate. "Look, kid. I'd appreciate it, if you told me, if you're on the run. Are people searching for you? Is... is HYDRA searching for you?"
This slight difference in presentation wasn't enough to make Steve believe that it could be true, though. That didn't mean that this wasn't suspicious.
, he was so beautiful.
Eyyyy! You didn't really think I'd kill Peter for good, did you? Nah, I'm a firm believer in happy endings. I'll talk a bit more about that topic once I post the last chapter. Because there is only one more chapter left! Are you excited?
Peter looked down at the book in his hands again. His eyes didn't meet Bucky's when he asked:"Do you want me to leave?"
"Wade, not now!", Steve snapped and Wade rarely witnessed him so angry.
"Natasha called. Gwen wants to see you.", He explained with a smile and Peter's heart stopped. He was pretty sure that it did and he wasn't sure when it started beating again.
They decided to not get another motel room and stay on the road instead, driving through the night. It was safer that way, Wade knew that HYDRA could catch up to them any second and even if he was convinced that he could protect Peter, he'd rather not risk his life unnecessarily.
"And what sort of issues would that be?", Peter asked and Tony and Wade exchanged a look. This was something that they both had noticed before, a certain sort of behavior. It was all too familiar to Tony, he used to do the same, still sometimes did. When he would feel cornered he'd lash out just to test the waters. Check how much he could push the borders before crossing a line.
He needed a plan. Peter wasn't good at plans, or at agency, or at not doing what he was told, but he had to do something.
"Yeah, okay. " As promised Wade only opened the door wide enough to hand Peter a stack of clothes before closing it again. Underwear, sweatpants, a t-shirt, a hoodie and fuzzy socks. Peter put the underwear, sweats and shirt on. Wade would probably want to replace the bandages and he preferred to be barefoot so he took the rest of the clothes under his arm before stepping out.
MJ stared at him for a moment longer before shaking herself out of her apparent stupor. "Wanna get out? Then I won't feel watched and you won't be in the water?", she suggested and Peter agreed with a grateful smile. That's how Peter found himself sitting at the edge of the pool again, MJ next to him, wrapped in towels with their legs hanging in the water. "What brought you here?",MJ asked, staring at her feet in the water.
"It's not half as bad as you pretended.", Peter then said and Wade almost laughed out.
Wade was alive. Peter wasn't.
"I do mean it. ", Wade promised him, holding Peter's gaze even when Peter tried to avoid him.
That got Peter to smirk for real. "I guess so.",  he nodded. He watched Bucky take another drag, the embers at the end of his cigarette glowing in the dark. "Can I try it?", he asked and the question was born out of genuine curiosity. Bucky said he smoked when he's stressed. Did it help?
"Yeah. ", he nodded and he took her clothes and carried them in one hand while holding her hand in his other.
Peter's eyes glanced over at his father and Steve. He was trying to gauge how things would be once they returned home. Tony and Steve seemed okay with taking in Gwen. For a moment he feared that he'd have to get her out of there on his own. When Tony actually jumped in and helped him out Peter couldn't believe it for a second. He felt like he sometimes didn't give his father as much credit as he might deserve. Sure, he made mistakes and Peter didn't forget those, but maybe it was time to try as well. He hadn't been trying to make things work for a while now.
"'Cause you're acting like somebody's pointing a gun at your head.", Wade pointed out.
Peter still cared about those things. He just didn't care about what happened to him anymore. Not in the way he used to. He didn't know where this newfound apathy came from, only that it had been there since the last HYDRA incident. He maybe should've mentioned it to his family but Peter wasn't exactly bothered by a lack of fear. Not caring was easier, so he kept it to himself.
Hey... it's been a while and some of you might've thought that I gave up on this story.
He didn't react though. Normally he couldn't stand it if someone snuck up on him, he didn't care much right now. There was no reason to worry anyways, it was only Steve. "Buck...?", his voice was low and faint, it cracked from being choked earlier.
"Peter?", he asked and Peter's focus was back on him again.
"Why so gloomy, love. Cheer up.", Death said, cupping Wade's face in her hands before leaning in an forcing her tongue down his throat. Wade didn't stop her, he didn't struggle, he wrapped his arms around her and tried to imagine that it was actually Peter. He knew he'd regret it later. Associating the two in his head never went well but it made coping in the moment easier.
"Ask away, Petey-Pie!", Wade winked. He had no idea where this was going but if Peter wanted to talk, he'd listen.
"Are you crying?", he asked, glancing down at her with a smile.
Confusion morphed to frustration in an instant as Peter struggled to express what he was feeling. He let out a groan before dropping his head and stroking through his hair frantically, pulling slightly at it.
"Roadtripping. ", he groaned, dropping his head back down again.
"How? We were by ourselves. How could they have reached you?", Peter asked. It was baffling. As far as he knew HYDRA needed codewords to activate their drones and he just couldn't imagine how they could've gotten that kind of access to Gwen under Tony's roof.
"Are you ready?", Bucky asked. They had all gathered outside Tony's house. Tony had provided one of his cars, a truck, and Bucky had already packed all their stuff in. He spend the last day gathering all the stuff he might need for an incognito road trip with Peter including fake ID's for both of them. They hadn't left Peter without supervision the entire last day. Even at night Steve had stayed in his room, making sure that Peter didn't try anything. Apparently he had refused to talk to anyone but Wade. Now it was time for a goodbye.
"Peter-", Natasha began but Peter wouldn't be pacified.
"So?! That's not good. You wouldn't be yourself anymore. ", Wade snapped and this time his frustration shone through. Peter didn't flinch. He stayed completely calm and Wade hated that.
"No.",  Peter admitted with a shrug. "But I can pretend. I can be better than before. I can be good for you."
"So you did?", Bucky asked, completely baffled.
"Doctor, the Avengers have arrived on sight.", one of the guards announced and Peter didn't dare to be relieved. He was nowhere near safe.
Then Peter attacked Tony and Wade. He couldn't remember it but he still saw the blood drip from Tony's forehead. Like an accusation, like a verdict.
Peter was shaking, his heart was racing.
Wade was dead. He was pretty sure of it. He almost expected Peter to turn into Lady Death and laugh at him for falling for her prank. But no, this was real. Peter was real and he was asking Wade to stay.
Every day he he just found more ways in which HYDRA had deconstructed his son. While Tony would never give up on Peter like the boy clearly expected, Peter was right with one thing. Tony hadn't been a dad in 10 years, and the Peter he had lost wasn't the same as this one. He didn't know this current Peter yet, couldn't tell what he needed.
"Because she doesn't want to see you.", Natasha replied and this time it wasn't just sympathy. It was fucking pitty. Peter didn't care though, his insides just continued to shatter and crash.
"Peter, it's okay... nobody will hurt you.", Wade said carefully while approaching Peter like a wild animal, slowly, his hands raised before him.
Tony had his eyes fixed on his son, a heartbroken expression on his face. Tony was too exprecive for his own good, you always knew what he was feeling, it made him an easy target.
"Get in.", Gwen only ordered before giving Peter a shove. So he did as he was told, a decade of HYDRA-conditioning shining through. He stepped onto the quinjet and even before he could confront what was about to happen next, he got whacked over the head  with the handle of Gwen's gun, sending him stumbling to the ground.
"If you say so."
Tony couldn't believe it. He hadn't thought that he'd ever hear Peter say those words again. He was content with Peter just being here but to hear him say that he loved Tony, that he considered him family, it was better than Tony could've ever imagined.
"Okay, enlighten me if you will.", he said, his voice calm but in a controlled way.
"Back at the forest, when you took off you were swinging through the air on white strings, where did they come from.", Wade then asked and Peter relaxed even more. His powers were the least of his concerns.
"He can't.", Bucky commented, proving Wade's suspicion right. Peter had absolutely no control over himself right now. Bucky had warned them about that but to see it right before them was daunting. Peter's eyes were crazed, his movement frantic, he was laughing hysterically like the fucking Joker. Wade wasn't sure if he had ever seen Peter so unhinged.
Wade couldn't shut up, though. He never could. And especially not now. Not when Peter was dead, and he told Wade that he loved him, and Wade didn't... didn't get to say it back. Peter died not knowing how much Wade loved him. Peter
Bucky offered him books, movies, music. Anything to entertain him (and to see if there was a person in there.) Sometimes it felt like there wasn't anyone to safe. Like Kid was an empty shell. The lights were on but nobody's home. Sometimes Bucky wondered if there was even a point or if Kid was just following orders.
He didn't look at Wade, his eyes were still pressed shut. But he could hear him sigh before replying.
"No, I'm fucking losing it. But thanks for asking.", he laughed and that actually made Wade crack up as well.
"Peter. I need you to focus on what we talked about. Focus on the present. It's 2019, you're not at HYDRA anymore. Wade saved you. You are safe.",the man then said and he started to repeat it, over and over again until it seeped into his mind, pulling Peter out of his head. It was a struggle but eventually Peter glanced up at Bucky who was still pinning him to the ground, his eyes a little clearer, and let out a faint whisper.
"Teammates?", Peter asked with raised eyebrows, actually looking at Wade now. It was strange that Peter really didn't seem to mind that Wade wasn't wearing his mask. Maybe it had something to do with his own distaste for his appearance. Wade didn't quite believe him when Peter talked about how he didn't want to look at himself. After what he saw at the bathroom this morning that doubt was gone.
Peter was
It took him a few seconds to determine, if he should tell Steve but eventually he replied:"He's good and brilliant and he cares even though he doesn't have to and he refuses to give up on me even though he should've by now. I'm... I'm messed up. I could never be like that. I'm too busy breaking apart to build someone else up."
Then he heard them, terrifying wails, like somebody was burning alive, Wade knew what that felt like.
All of these words shot around Peter's head in that moment. He felt suspended in time, like days passed between each of his heartbeats. He had never seen anything like it.
To say that Peter didn't take it well would've been an understatement. His head whipped around, his eyes wide, glaring at Tony, uncaring that they could now see the rivers of tears that ran down his face. "Stop! Lying to me!", he yelled, his voice cracking with the strain of it, his whole body trembling from the emotional intensity. " I can't be loved! I'm a fucking monster! I'm a thing! I'm fucking toxic, if I was left to my own devices I'd destroy everything. I know that! "
Death's words sounded like a threat. Or a warning. Which one it was wasn't really important, they were equally concerning. Sure, it was possible that she was just fucking with him. For all he knew she could be jealous.
"Yeah, sorry. How- are you sure that he's dead?", Bucky asked and he heard Steve take a shuddering breath.
"Whatever.", Peter shook his head slightly. "Let me rephrase it. I don't think he's lying. I believe that he loved me or loves the son he lost but... I'm not the Peter Stark he lost. You've spend the last few days with me, you know what a colossal dumpster fire of a person I am. Soon enough he'll realize that and I just don't want to deal with his disappointment. So yes, I'm protecting myself."
"What the fuck, Tony?", she seemed to have been holding back when Peter was present but now that he was gone she really let loose. "I mean... HYDRA? For all these years. How is he-? What did they-? How can he-?" She seemed to be unable to form a coherent question at first, her mind running too quick for her mouth to keep up with. Finally she took a deep breath and settled on one. "Is he okay?"
"Yeah but that was 3 months ago. 3 months that I spend in cold-ass New York instead of Malibu. ", Peter pointed out. Tony and Steve asked if he was okay with staying in New York for now. Peter knew that it made their jobs as Avengers easier, this way they were much closer to the rest of the team, so Peter said yes. He didn't really mind the city as much as he used to, anyways, even though he still preferred Malibu. The main things that had bothered him were the cold weather and the many people but those didn't effect him much anymore.
He didn't know how long he had been here, time didn't feel real in the afterlife, the clock on the wall didn't even have pointers.
I'll include a completely non-graphic summary of those parts in the bottom notes. The text itself will never be really graphic because I'm personally uncomfortable writing that but I still wanted to warn you.
"He needs to talk to you.", Bucky said but Peter shook his head stubbornly.
"Peter-", Karen started, her steady eyes focused on Peter, pleading with him to stand down but Peter had already attracted the attention of the robber.
"I really don't know, I'll figure it out, though. ", he replied focusing on the boy again. Only then did he notice that Fake-Peter was glaring at him. His huge dark eyes had something unsettling, even disturbing.
"It's fine." Peter shrugged, as if he didn't care and Bucky wished that he did. He'd take anything over apathy.
That one hit a little close to home but Peter just gave another apologetic shrug and the alarmed expression on MJ's face softened a fraction. She gathered herself enough to actually explain it to Peter.
The other male took a step back, just staring at Wade. "Why are you ruining this for me?", he then asked and he sounded fucking heartbroken.
On the days that the boxes were too loud, the days that they almost convinced Wade, that it was all pointless, that he had fucked everything up beyond repair, on those days Wade looked back at Peter's messages, at the little promises each of them represented. And they kept him going and would continue to do so until Peter would finally return.
"Am I allowed to say it?", Tony asked with a careful smile.
"Still, that's like 11 years.", he pointed out.
Not almost, not nearly, no. Peter had been dead and gone. Tony didn't come in last minute to save him but that's what Peter thought.
"I do? What do I say?", Peter in asked, stretching a bit and sitting up as well.
fragile to function. So don't see this as me asking you to stay, don't feel obligated to do so. I couldn't live with myself if you did.", Peter was rambling and with every new word something inside Wade came undone.
sign up to have me as a son and I don't expect you to be my dad. It's as easy as that. ", there wasn't any emotion in his voice. No resentment, no pain, no disappointment. He sounded resigned. It made Tony sick.
"That's okay. I'll prove it to you with time. Just don't resent me for staying.",Wade asked of him and his heart fluttered in his chest when Peter bit his lip and replied:"I couldn't. I missed you, too, by the way."
When he did Wade was careful, painfully careful as he wrapped his arms around Peter gently. Even though all he wanted to do was give him an embrace with all his strength and adoration, never letting go. But he couldn't do that, so he took it slow as Peter clung to him.
. But Wade couldn't just drop this now. He had committed.
"Wait. Just like that?", Wade stammered.
The first time he saw Wade's skin Peter understood why he wore a mask. Not because Peter was disgusted, it really wasn't all that bad, but because he understood that A) Not everyone was as unbothered as him, and B)he knew how it felt to be repulsed by your own appearance.
The other male slowly rose from his spot on the ground, groaning in pain as he stretched and Peter realized that he could hear his bones cracking. But that was the only thing.
They left the grand canyon after a few days and moved on. Peter didn't ask where to, he trusted Bucky to pick something that he'd like.
"How about a bath?", Wade asked his tone lighthearted but Peter could feel his whole body tense instantly as fear crept up his throat. Apparently that didn't go by unnoticed because Wade pulled his eyebrows together and took a step back. "Unless that's connected to a certain trauma?", he asked carefully and Peter tried to swallow the lump in his throat before replying.
"Okay, FRIDAY? Tell Tony that MJ and I are going over to Wade's. "
Tony took a deep breath, collecting his thoughts and the words he had prepared. This would've been so much easier with Steve present but Fury demanded him for a mission. They hadn't told any of the Avengers about Peter yet. Only Pepper, Happy and Rhodey knew so they had no excuse to be absent. "For starters, food." Peter pulled a face, still not looking at Tony. He didn't let that stop him, though. "You can eat whatever and whenever you like as long as you eat. You don't have to ask for permission and if you want anything specific you can just ask for it and we'll get it for you." Peter eyed him wearily, like he wasn't quite believing him. But at last, he nodded. "Okay. Great. The other thing is that we need you to tell us how you feel.",Tony continued and to his surprise Peter scoffed, rolling with his eye.
"You ain't the one that needs to apologize-", Wade stated but Peter cut him off, something that was surprising enough on it's own.
"This is weird, isn't it?", She then asked, another careful smile on her lips.
"I hope so... I love you Peter, you know that, right?"
"You're a menace, I'll reset them for you back at the house so that they don't heal crooked.", Bucky smirked and Peter gave him a grateful smile.
"Peter...", Tony persisted, his tone far calmer than he felt. "You have a right to chose what happens to yourself. If you don't want anyone to touch you, then nobody will touch you. And whatever else you need, we'll take care of it."
A fire lit up in his chest when he saw Peter's name on the screen and died down as soon as he heard Tony's panicked voice on the other side of the line. "I sent a jet for you, he needs you."
"We made a deal, Peter.", Steve suddenly stated, taking control of the situation. Peter didn't look at him. Steve didn't let that stop him. "I know it's not what you wanted but there isn't anything we can do right now. The good news is that you'll only be stuck here for a few days and that we'll check in on you every day. After that we can go home and SHIELD will leave you alone."
"What's up, Mechanic? Why you ghosting me?", the boy asked.
"It's the McWay Fall.", a voice beside Peter suddenly said and he flinched too violently to go unnoticed. To her credit the girl beside him didn't mention it. Instead she just stared at him with a blank expression.
"I know. I'm sorry... I couldn't sleep and I didn't want to wake you... I'm sorry. I'm not going anywhere. ", Peter told her.
Death glanced down for a moment, considering Wade's offer. "You'll give me whatever I want?", she asked.
"Fuck.", Bucky cursed as Tony set the jet in motion, launching them into the sky.
"Peter... I promise you that I won't let anyone hurt you ever again...", Tony whispered, his voice breaking.
"Never heard of it.", Peter claimed and Bucky's eyes grew wide.
"Sure, come on Petey-Pie. Gonna build you sand castle in the sand like Robin Sparkles." With that he led him off and Tony turned back to face Natasha.
He woke up with a metallic taste in his mouth, probably blood, and the chatter of his boxes in his mind, what's new? He took a deep breath before sitting up and opening his eyes. They fell on Peter immediately.
Bucky shook his head. He knew how dark things could seem, how hopeless. He knew because he'd been there and back then nobody but Steve had believed that he could ever become something resembling a person again. If he made it, Peter would as well. "That's the aftereffects of the withdrawal talking.", He said but Peter didn't seem to like that.
"Yeah, I'm still not used to it.", he admitted before sitting down on the bed and pulling off his shoes and throwing them aside.
He let his eyes wander to the window again. The area was getting less and less rural, for the last few hours they've been driving through actual towns.
"Sounds normal, seems fake.", he said, his voice muffled by the bits of sandwich he just stuffed in his mouth.
With that he turned around and followed the agents outside again, leaving Tony and the others to collapse on their own.
"I don't know.", Peter sighed, releasing the smoke. "She's pretty shaken up, but that's not a surprise. I don't know how I'm supposed to help her. Even though I can imagine it, I don't know what she went through ever since we separated, she seems different. I just...I don't want to cause her anymore pain but I don't know what the right thing to do is.", he admitted.
Wade pulled a face. "Depressed, in love, same thing."
"I guess you're right-", Steve sighed, stroking a hand over his face. He was interrupted by Wade.
"Of 10? Definitely air for improvement. ", Tony remarked.
"Yeah?"
"Fake IDs.", Bucky replied simply. Peter inspected them for a moment, reading the writing on them, looking at his and Bucky's picture.
What he didn't plan on was finding a cryo-chamber with an actual person inside. He could see his face through a window in the metal door, half of it to be precise. Pale skin, messy brown hair, sharp features. The other half, his nose and mouth, were covered with a black mask.
Gwen didn't say anything at that for a long time. Peter wished that he cold see her face. "What happened to you, after... after they separated us?", she eventually asked and he could hear the worry in her voice.
"If you say so.", Peter nodded along.
"I believe you. But Gwen might be scared that you didn't.", Tony told him.
"I- I can't accept this-", Wade whispered. He had no idea how long they had sat there, gathered around Peter's dead body. Wade's mind had sort of shut down and was only now booting back up again. It had to have been a while though, because Tony had stopped crying. He just sat there, staring at nothing.  Steve had wrapped his arms around him, trying to give some form of comfort, though Wade didn't think that that was an option right now.
"Is that all you've got?", Peter asked with a weak grin. It was a small victory but Peter would take it.
"Well, we can't have everything going my way. I have to become a person before I become cocky."
"It's because I love you.", there they were, the words just slipped out and Tony knew that they were true. He never stopped loving his son, never would. Peter only rolled with his eyes, looking out the window again.
Peter didn't turn around, didn't even glance at Tony or indicate that he heard him. He just stared straight aheah. "I'm not suicidal.", he then said and he spoke through gritted teeth.
"I don't care what you ment. Piss off.", he snapped and Wade had the feeling that as much as that hurt, it would only get worse from here.
"Yeah, sure. They kinda got off an hearing me beg for it.",he said with a casualty that startled Wade, not because it was foreign but because it was so goddamn familiar.
"Breakfast?", Peter suggested. It took Gwen a while to set back into motion, she nodded and then got up, sort of mechanical.
"But also less hope.", Wade pointed out and he wished he could see Peter's face but didn't dare to move.
"So what? We do nothing now?", Wade snapped and Tony glared at him before answering.
"And can I drive it?", Peter asked and Tony raised his eyebrows in surprise.
"Take a wild guess."
"Never got to tell him that, did you? Never got to kiss him?",she asked and it felt like mockery, each word cut like a knife. She was throwing these words in his face, things he hadn't even dared to admit to himself. Now it was too late. "It's really a shame, isn't it?", Death asked and started to lean in and Wade knew what was coming but that didn't mean that he could bear it.
Okay, look, Zendaya and her portrayal of MJ own me and I had to put her into this story somehow. Plus, Peter needs some normalcy, and he needs some friends, and I also love Zendaya, sue me. Since this is already pretty AU I decided that MJ doesn't live in NY, (neither do Flash and Ned but they aren't part of the story for now).
"Oh is that so? Then tell me your plan, genius.". His voice was edgier than intended. He couldn't handlethis right now, but he had to. "I don't need a plan, I'm going in there and I'm getting Peter out. Whatever it takes.", Wade spat before narrowing his eyes at Bucky. "You should be coming with me, you know. I know you wanna."
"They won't be fast enough.", Gwen returned with absolute conviction.
Hope you enjoy this slightly fluffy chapter and leave a comment!
"Yeah...", Tony sighed, unwinding his crossed arms and leading Wade down the hallway. "He's in his room but watch out, he doesn't react well to touch or... anything. ", he sounded so defeated when he said that and a few seconds later Wade could see why.
"I can't!", he suddenly exclaimed and it was the loudest Peter had ever been. "I can't, okay?", he repeated, quieter this time and it was almost like a plea, every word dripping with desperation. "What if I go back? How long until I snap again? What if it's worse next time? What if I kill-", his voice broke off, eyes wide and terrified.
"Was?", Tony asked and Peter really didn't want to talk about this. Grief, disgust and anguish coiled around his throat, making it hard to breathe. His eyes started to water as he let them wander around the dark room, trying to anchor himself.
It was a little drafty in Steve's studio but Peter didn't feel the cold anymore. Still, he wondered if it had been a bad idea to let MJ paint him shirtless for her art school portfolio. He never knew how to say no to her, so there they were, in Steve's studio in the Avengers tower.
"He doesn't need me right now. He needs to work, he needs to find a way to get Peter out. I'd only be in the way and both of us know that.", Steve explained. He sounded exhausted and pained but hopeful. Far more hopeful than Bucky could muster. Typical Steve. "You know that it's only a matter of time until we get him out, right? This isn't hopeless.", Steve then stated and he sounded so fucking sure of himself and Bucky envied him for that. How could he believe that things would eventually work out? Maybe because for Steve, they did out. Bucky was different. He always had to lose something to get something else back.
"We perfected the procedure. It'll only take a week. Two at most. Then you'll get him back. He'll be neutralized, he won't be a risk anymore and you can continue his recovery where you left off.", Fury said and Wade wanted to smash the screen.
He didn't believe a word when Wade told him that he was bringing him to his father. Peter didn't have a family, HYDRA raised him, he was their creation. If he knew anything it was this.
"Who is Gwen?", Tony asked and Peter narrowed his eyes at him. He sounded curious but also flippant, like it was a casual question.
"Now I'll have to draw you, you look like a sad indie boy right now.", MJ said, the amusement back in her voice, breaking the tension.
Oh my God, the amount of hits and kudos this story got practically overnight is amazing! Thank you so much!
"Stop it. Stop looking at me like that. ", Peter begged, rolling with his eyes.
"You can't know that.", Peter stated, defeat in his voice. That might've been true, if Bucky didn't have a very concrete understanding of how much forgiveness Tony Stark was capable of.
He looked up at Gwen and her face was pulled into a grimace. It hadn't been before. Why the change? She punched him and he spat blood, she punched him and she looked devastated.
They had called Peter down for breakfast. He still looked incredibly small and gaunt, his face empty and sickly. His dark hair shimmered with grease by now but Tony didn't dare to mention taking a shower again.
"So you do remember me?", he smirked but this time Peter didn't. He just watched him, one second, two, three, five, ten.
Sorry for dying... again. I was just really fucking inspired in a different way. If you wanna know what I mean check out my tumblr https://winter-oswin.tumblr.com/
. Wade wouldn't have expected anything different.
. Fitting word. Everything is always so goddamn complicated.", Peter mumbled, his eyes focused on his hands in his lap, he was fiddling with his phone and it reminded him of Wade.
"Don't touch-", Peter hissed, flinching back but the guards held him in place. He had nowhere to escape when Keipon backhanded him. Something sharp caught on Peter's brow, probably a ring and he could feel something warm trickle down the side of his face from where his skin had split.
"It's an honest to God question. Why would he come back? I mean, he's clearly doing better now that he's away from me. So why would he ever return?"
Keep Peter a secret. Another deadly secret. "Yes." She had done it before. "I hope you don't get yourself killed." With that she left.
"It's okay... I'm just glad to see you out again. You look...better.", Tony said with the faintest smile pulling at his lips.
"No, this is a ruse. I'll drop and kill you so that you have to spend time with Lady Death again.", Peter replied sarcastically, rolling with his eyes. He pulled at Wade's hand once more and this time Wade leaned out of the window and let Peter pull him up. He held onto the thin string of Peter's webs and marvelled at how Peter could just pull him up without breaking a sweat or even standing up.
Peter still didn't reply to that, his eyes focused on his hands in his lap. Bucky could almost see the cogs turning in his head. A different approach, then. "Besides, Steve told me that they are pretty devastated, all of them. They think that you're dead."
"Pretty good all things considered. I mean, it's rough, everyday is a new battle but I'm sure you know that yourself. ", Natasha sighed. She looked tired but happy. Tony was sure that they both did. There was a very unique sort of pain but also joy that came with taking care of a kid.
Gwen looked actually startled by being addressed, as if she had no voice in this discussion of her future. Wade couldn't fault her for thinking like that.
"Oh, okay...", he only said before reaching for a single slice of bread and starting to nibble on it.
Steve glanced over as well, Deadpool was currently rubbing Fake-Peter's back, quietly speaking to him. He didn't seem malicious, he actually seemed to be the only thing that kept the boy from falling apart completely. That didn't have to mean anything though, he could still be responsible for the boy's state. Steve had heard of gaslighting and
"Yeah?"
. That's good, though.  It was too much before."
"Now that was a bit dramatic, wasn't it?", Wade chuckled nervously but Steve and Tony just both stared at the closed door like Peter would return any second.
"Anyways, I see that you enjoyed your little vacation a lot but it's time to come home now. ", Keipon went on before turning away from Peter and starting to circle Gwen instead. "Gwenny missed you a lot.", he added with a grin before stepping behind her, glancing at Peter over her shoulder. Gwen didn't move, didn't even pull a face, his presence didn't seem to faze her at all.
Happy, Tony's head of security, a guy that generally didn't look happy at all, let them out in front of Sister Margaret's School for Wayward Children. Wade was friends with the owner of the bar and that's how he got the apartment above it.
Peter ignored his warning and chose to answer his first question instead. "Yeah, but it could be worse. I saw what you did to the agents,  I don't want that happening to me and I know that there would be no point
Anyways, I hope you enjoy it and leave a comment!
Days passed, weeks, months, years. Suddenly a decade. It didn't feel like it. Tony could still see the blood like it had been yesterday. Peter would've been 19 years old. Except he never got to go that far. Never even turned ten, never went to high school or graduated, never fell in love, never kissed a girl, never went to prom or got his drivers license.
"Do you still want to die?", she asked, sounding so goddamn sad, it hurt. Peter hated causing her more pain.
So? I told you that this served a purpose, didn't I? After all, this is a strictly Spideypool household.
"Hey, listen to me, it would be a real dick move if you didn't listen to my last words.", Peter said, his voice cracking but he dared to smile. Blood was spilling from his lips but the smile was genuine.
"Natasha, we told you to leave!", Steve snapped but Tony didn't bother with words. He strode over to her and yanked the file from her hands.
Wade didn't get time to contemplate that thought much further though because in that moment he heard shots. They had no time to react when something hit one of their tires and suddenly they were flying off the road.
He decided to give the two a little privacy as he turned his attention towards Bucky and Steve. "You really did a number on him, Buck. I'm impressed.", Steve just said and Bucky smiled but didn't look up, seeming almost shy.
"That's because I was trying to build trust. Would you've come along with a guy going by Deadpool?"
Ahhh all your comments on my last chapter were amazing!!! Thank you very much and please tell me your thoughts in the comments! It's so motivating when I hear from you!
Instead Peter's expression shifted, just a tiny bit, Wade probably wouldn't have noticed it if he hadn't watched Peter so closely. He just suddenly looked... less curious and more sad.
"Peter. It's okay." So goddamn soft. Like a blanket, like Gwen. Peter lowered his hands and finally looked at Wade. He had nothing but sympathy in his eyes, sincere sympathy and Peter couldn't take it. "I won't leave until you're okay to stay by yourself, I promise. Okay?", Wade said and somehow Peter believed him.
