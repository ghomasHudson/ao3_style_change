"No, I suppose it didn't." John's tongue darted between his lips as he thought about it. "I think I'm more comfortable in a medical setting. And I can keep my chair near the foot of the dentist's chair, so I could get to it if I needed to. The barber moves it away so he can have room to cut my hair."
John closed the door behind Molly and turned back to Sherlock and the glider. "How did Eurus order this, anyway? Did she steal your bank card? Or mine?" He reached for his wallet, which was safely tucked in his back pocket—she couldn't have taken his card without him noticing, as she had with his phone. Could she have?
Moriarty laughed again. "I don't think so. Even your brother's incompetent security force would be able to find me there. We meet on neutral territory." He paused for a moment, then said, "Barts Hospital. Two hours. Just you and me. No Johnny. No police. No big brother Mycroft. Just the two of us."
"Oh." Sherlock straightened up and turned towards John. "Erm. Rosie, do you know which basket they went in?"
Sherlock shrugged and leaned back in his chair, putting distance between them again. He spread his hands in the air, palms up. "For the time being, at least. Who knows what the future may hold?"
Thanks for reading!
Diazepam=Valium, though my understanding is they don't call medications by brand names in the UK. Also that Xanax isn't commonly prescribed, although that would be a more common prescription here in the US. Either way, Sherlock could probably use something legal to occasionally calm himself down.
It took him a moment to realise what John wanted.
"True," Mycroft said. "While you seem to enjoy it now, as if you're some sort of...family man."
"Give her to me." John was still outside on the pavement, but he was certainly better equipped to tend to an injured—
"Trust me, I will. You do recall that Moriarty is familiar with Barts, as well? He was even briefly employed there."
John paused to check the door behind Sherlock a few times when he first started, but once they got going he kept all his attention on Sherlock, continuing to use his hands as well as his mouth, stroking each time he pulled back to take a breath and whisper filthy words of encouragement.
"I think you're going to lie there on that sofa and let yourself get sucked down into a black mood and you can't afford to do that now with Moriarty still running loose."
"For you," John said, and thrust the card towards Sherlock, who took it from his hand.
Sherlock's stomach dropped in horror at the thought of sleeping with John in his parents' bed, and John obviously had the same thought, because his eyes widened before he smiled at Mummy and shook his head. "No, we couldn't possibly take your own bedroom away from you."
"Right." John dropped the knife into the sink.
"Did someone think you were important enough to assassinate? How much did they pay her?"
"I'm glad you're not dead."
The number on the screen was unfamiliar, from outside of the UK, based on the country code. He wrinkled his brow and tapped on the message to open it.
"She's an escaped murderer, Sherlock. She lost the right to have a say in her own future."
Sherlock glanced back at John without opening the door any further.
"He still feels guilty and thinks he owes me. Plus, he has experience. He managed to track my movements halfway around the world, even if he never quite caught up with me."
"He has eggs," Eurus said, without lifting her gaze from Eve. "And I bet that between the two of you, you could figure out how to cook them. A tip: turn the flame up higher and they'll cook faster."
"She's killed people much more recently than that. You know she has. And even if we don't call Mycroft, we still need to let someone know a baby has been born. She needs a birth certificate, and Eurus should be checked out by a doctor who knows more about childbirth and its aftereffects than I do."
"Mm. That's a good question." Sherlock looked over at John, and for a moment John thought he was trying to pass the question off to him, but then he continued. "I suppose we use hearts because when you love someone, it makes a warm feeling inside your chest." He dropped his gaze from John. "And that's where your heart is," he added, and poked Rosie in the chest with one finger.
"Yes, you made the right choice." John was about to wiggle right out of his dressing gown. "Lube's in the suitcase. We finished the other tube last night."
"Are you trying to kiss me through that face mask?" John craned his neck to look back at him.
"I know."
“He’s...still outside,” Sherlock said. “He’ll be along shortly.” He unsnapped Stone’s lead so the dog could serve as a distraction. It worked—Stone ran to join Daddy on the sofa and Sherlock made it past them without having to provide any more explanation for John’s absence.
"I haven't put your gift out yet," John said. "Don't want you to guess what it is."
He grimaced and squatted down next to her, unable to keep himself from asking what happened, though her answer was again too slurred to be intelligible.
By the time he finished washing his plate and the pots he had used for cooking, John had changed the channel to a football match, but Sherlock chose not to join him in the living room yet. Instead, he opened the window over the kitchen sink, and then the drawer that held Lestrade's old cigarettes. John would know, obviously, but if it helped him get rid of the memory of Moriarty lifting up John's shirt and taunting Sherlock about how helpless he was, then it was worth enduring a brief bout of his anger.
John nodded and began to strip, dropping his clothes into the laundry basket by the door. When he got down to his underwear, he stepped into the steamy bathroom and took a deep breath. "Oh, you're an angel."
“Of course he arrived in town. It’s only two miles away, and he left nearly an hour ago.”
John watched him go, appreciating both the view as Sherlock walked away and how easily he had fallen into the role of tending to Eve. He was going to be a good father, as long as he could keep himself clean, and John would do everything he could to help him with that. He finished off his tea, took one more small biscuit and then got up to clear the dishes they had used. He'd make sure they ate something better for dinner, at least.
Rosie burst into giggles and Sherlock hugged her to his chest, laughing and spinning in a circle, marveling that something so simple could make her so happy.
"I do wish I'd got the chance to see Eurus. You should have phoned me yesterday when she arrived. I could have been here by mid-afternoon and helped while she was in labour."
"Yes, well-observed. You can borrow it for now."
Rather than arguing with him, Rosie burst into tears, a clear sign that she was overtired. If he tried to take her to Baker Street now, they would have at least 30 more minutes of travel, and they still wouldn't have had dinner, which would make her even more miserable. And he really wanted her to be in a good mood the next time she saw Eve, after her meltdown before they left yesterday.
"I—" Sherlock faltered at the thought.
"Yes." Sherlock blinked once at him before continuing. "Thank you. Her water broke. Contractions are three minutes apart. I'm almost out of clean towels." He started to unroll one of his sleeves, stood stock-still for a moment, then pushed it back up to his elbow again. "Thank God you're here," he repeated. "I need to go down to Mrs. Hudson's for more towels and I don't want to leave her here alone." He moved as if to walk down the hall past John and John planted himself firmly in his path.
"Are you suggesting that I am less able to get in and out of a bathtub than your 75-year-old parents?"
"Oh, we got this one for Rosie," Daddy said. "Mummy's idea, it was." Daddy bit at his lip and looked at him.
John waited a few seconds, because he knew what a silent Sherlock looked like, and this wasn't it.
"Rosie." Sherlock's voice, soft and gentle, came from behind John. "Daddy isn't trying to be mean to you. Here, I've got your balloon for you. You can take it home with you later, okay?" He let the balloon he'd liberated from the bouquet in the kitchen float up until it bobbed against the ceiling, then stepped around John and the coffee table and sat down next to her on the sofa.
He was able to confirm that the fingers had been removed from their bodies less than 24 hours ago, which was obvious given that Moriarty had only escaped yesterday. It didn't help him get any closer to identifying the victims, so he set to work preparing his microscope and a row of test tubes. If he tested the blood in each finger, maybe that would turn up some leads. He discovered that the male victim had a vitamin D deficiency and that the woman was slightly anaemic. Neither condition was uncommon in the UK, but if he corralled enough data he might be able to use it all to narrow down the identities. He detected no traces of poison or anything too out of the ordinary in the tissue samples, which was unsurprising. Moriarty would have doubtless used a faster and more direct way to kill or impair his victims.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him. He'd told John not to worry, that even if she understood the purpose of the ring it wouldn't matter, since she was aware that the two of them were married and having sex. "Just because I said it doesn't mean I meant it."
"Oh, John. I thought I heard the door open. Did you talk Sherlock round yet? About sending his sister back to prison, I mean."
"John, pay attention. The animatronic Grogu that Rosie wants for Christmas."
John's mouth opened and then closed. He looked down and sighed. "I just...didn't want you to overreact."
John narrowed his eyes. "Like Pavlov's dogs?"
John wanted nothing more than for him to go away, to stop looking at him and turn his attention to unpacking the items Wiggins had brought, or cooking the eggs, or anything other than watching while he struggled to pull himself together.
"Yes, but he was acquitted at trial, so he went free."
"That's fine. I doubt that I'll sleep, anyway."
"Wasn't sure if we'd make it out," John said, letting out the lead so Stone could sniff around the back patio.
John gave a half-hearted laugh. "My hair's more grey than blond these days." He poked at the small mass that sat on the table. "Those blond strands are probably Mary's hair. She and Sharon switched schedules so she's in my office a lot now."
"Wiggins?" John's evening, which hadn't been great, got considerably worse. "What does he want? He'd better not be trying to sell you something." He had sworn off violence, but would make an exception to beat Wiggins to a pulp if he came anywhere near this flat with drugs.
"What's wrong?" Sherlock came all the way into the kitchen and dropped the bags onto the table, letting the balloons drift up and bounce against the ceiling. "Did Eurus do something to you? To Eve? Is Eve all right?"
"Another mystery gift from Eurus?" John suggested. Too small to be another piece of furniture—maybe she'd sent a pillow for the glider.
He pulled his head back slightly to speak. "Of course it's about the case. I'm tired of the case." He rested his head on his knees once more.
"What? Lestrade doesn't even know about the fingers."
"John, tell me quickly. If I were to attempt to deliver a baby in my flat, what items should I have on hand?"
—child than Sherlock was.
"You don't think I should be stopping them at all," Sherlock deduced.
"Shut up, Mycroft. What do you know about it, hm?"
"Yeah, but where should I look?" Lestrade spread his hands and looked up and down the street, as if Moriarty might be standing nearby, watching. Actually—
A few long seconds passed before he had the presence of mind to rest his head against his knees and make himself take slow, deep breaths. His thoughts were a whirl of chaos, so he found a starburst-shaped stain on the floor and made himself focus on it as he breathed, waiting for the panic to subside.
So I have now confirmed to myself that Eurus definitely offers far more material than can be neatly fit into a few ficlets, which is good for my plan to write a longer fic with her after this, but probably not so good for people looking for a solid resolution to the plot line here. :)
"Yes," Sherlock replied, and seemed to know what John wanted. "If I can sit still like this and you do most of the moving, you can sit on me now. I'll come inside you."
Now that they weren't under threat of being discovered and possibly arrested, John took his time. When they were finished, his only request for himself was a glass of water, which Sherlock fetched for him despite his inclination to roll over and fall asleep immediately.
Mummy gasped. “There’s no need to be that graphic, now.”
Eve didn't stir when they came into the room, but as they gathered around the cot, they could see the pale green blanket she was swaddled in rise and fall with each sleeping breath she took.
Finally he found a box of zipped plastic bags in the drawer next to the fridge-freezer. As he pulled one out, he spied a half-empty pack of cigarettes. Lestrade hadn't smoked in months, but he still hadn't disposed of his old cigarettes. Somehow the thought made Sherlock feel better about himself.
Perhaps Sherlock shouldn't have been surprised. He'd known he loved John; he'd known he was attracted to him, as well. He had not known how desperately he wanted to kiss him. How could he have? He'd never known kisses could feel like that. Weren't they simply something done for show, to signal that you were interested in another person? And yet that simple press of lips they had just shared, while a far cry from an intimate kiss of lovers, had made every nerve in Sherlock's body leap in joy.
Somehow, with an incredible effort, he manages to mumble a few words.
They're gazing at each other then suddenly, both of them burst into giddy giggles. Blushing.
A few moments pass: John looking sadly at Sherlock. He knows he's right.
’ today,“ John explained, not even lifting up his gaze from the book he was reading. Once Sherlock shuffled under the duvet however, he tightly wrapped his limbs all around John’s body and so John had to put the book aside on the nightstand, knowing that trying to read under such conditions would be useless.
SHERLOCK (CONT'D)
“Yes, actually yes, it was him. About five minutes ago,“ John replied.
Go away.
“Sleep is boring.”
SHERLOCK
“Sherlock, you’ve hardly uttered another word,“ John said reproachfully. “Either you’ve been whining or you spend the rest of the time cursing your brother.“ He passed his arm underneath Sherlock so he could embrace him and put his hand over the side of Sherlock’s head. Sherlock immediately gave into the touch, casually prompting John so he would stroke his hair.
Cut to Sherlock, listening intently.
, you remember bloody everything,“ he snorts.
“Sure,“ John lowered his eyes, this time taking one long gulp after another until his mug was half-empty. Fake or not, the sight of Sherlock kissing someone else had been quite queasy-worthy, John had to admit. He could hardly erase the memory of it, albeit feeling like an utter hypocrite since he had so often used to promenade around the flat in the company of his girlfriend, sometimes in a desperate hope of spurring a jealous reaction from Sherlock. And yet he so irrationally held grudge against basically everyone who had merely breathed in Sherlock’s presence. John might have as well turned green on the outside, it would at least explain Sherlock’s puzzled expression.
SHERLOCK
… he truly... cares about me, would you believe that? You've always claimed that once you let someone so close you're destined to fail in everything because that person now owns your heart and you're no longer able to do anything without prioritising
“I know, I am sorry, John, I shouldn’t have asked you about that,“ Sherlock apologised, panic in his eyes as clear as in his breathy voice.
“Stop making fun of me,“ Sherlock pouted but left out a pleased hum right afterwards, once John gently stroke the scalp of his head.
“You-you forgive me then?“
” he attempts to say but the only sound that leaves his throat is another broken moan. “Sherlock,
Sherlock: knows that look, shrugs.
Sherlock stares at him for a few seconds, intently, as if trying to read his thoughts before finally giving a nod of agreement.
,“ he brooded, slipping his phone into the pocket. “Let’s just hope there aren’t any ghosts around. The ones that are used to feed upon the darkest souls, it wouldn’t end up well for either of us.“
! For God's sake,” John bursts into giggles, shaking his head fondly. “Put something on, please.”
You attempted to stop her.
Sherlock takes a shaky breath, carefully, he sits down on the edge of the bed, John's hand still in his.
“Don’t worry,“ John waved a hand in surrender, “I don't want to argue with you anymore, that's the last thing you need, so... so fine then. If you think it's wiser to wait, I'll wait. I won’t do anything stupid, Sherlock, nothing I first don't consult with you. My lips are sealed, as you wish. I will play a fool in front of Mary for the next couple of weeks until one of us figures how to deal with this so no one else gets hurt. Especially not that baby. And then… we shall see.“

John, grinning too.

John: flustered again.
Sherlock gawks at him.
Sherlock scrunched his face in ire, gritting his teeth like a wild roaring wolf which is about to rip his victim’s throat apart. But Mycroft wasn’t alarmed, he knew his little brother well enough to know what lies behind this wrath.
My favourite.
And at that moment, out stepped Moriarty.
“Obviously,“ John chuckles. “Except you’re going to freeze now, Sherlock.“
Sherlock’s lips curl into the saddest smile John has ever seen. He reaches to cup John’s face, brushing underneath his eyes and across his cheeks. Sighing, he traces his thumb down the scar that splits John’s left side, somewhat a painful reminder of all the rough they have been through together. John relaxes into his touch, closing the distance between them, slowly, inch by inch until their noses bump, making Sherlock chuckle ever so softly.

(titters)
“That guy, the client's uncle... Harrington... whatever. Did you learn anything useful at all?”
Sherlock couldn't sound more vexed if he tried. If John weren't used to his grumbling, he would too, be on the verge of exasperation by now but this time he handles it with a smile on his lips. Such demeanour seems to confound Sherlock.
Yes. Hello.
“I've promised I wouldn’t do

Yes, yes! God, yes, it's a yes. Of course I'll marry you. I'd marry you this instant if I could.

He grabs his coat, clumsily putting it on.
“There’s not much to talk about anyway. The-the-” Sherlock makes a hopeless gesture with his hand pointing at his lips, “-
Personal experience?
Under any other circumstances, John wouldn’t worry that bad. Sherlock used to disappear from time to time, without a word and sometimes even for hours. But considering that Mary was still out there, free and extremely dangerous, John would feel more at peace if Sherlock at least informed him what he was up to.
“Y-yes,“ Sherlock panted, “in ancient China-form of-of punishment-“

“What, a case? Can I be any helpful?“

“You've never...
John takes a deep breath. As if to brace himself.
“But- I am already holding you, Sherlock.“
“And I’ll be the one to end this... Can I kiss you?“ John bit his lip, already leaning down.
“Don’t come any closer,“ John yelps through the tears, his left fist trembling nearly frantically. “Just don’t, Sherlock… I don’t-I don’t need your help. I don’t want you here, don’t you understand? I don’t want you to look at me.“
It seemed to be useless trying to reason with Sherlock but John was having none of that. “I am not entirely sure I believe you, Sherlock,“ John admitted, risking a small step forward. “You’re exceptionally quiet. You didn’t even make a speech at the funeral. You-you

How could you not? She was practically... whatever.

“Yes. Yes, I heard you,” Sherlock nodded but kept his head down. “But I couldn't. Because if I did... If I did let you know, who knows what would have happened. I couldn't risk it, don't you get it? I needed to make sure that no harm would come to you. I had to take care of Moriarty's network first and then-”
Several minutes later, however, John kind of begins to regret that he has. Just the thought of Sherlock all by himself somewhere nice and hot with swimming pools and cocktails, surrounded by dozens of scarcely dressed, tanned people, every day for a whole damn week, people that will undoubtedly

“I didn’t mean the couch,“ Sherlock sheepishly bit his lip, rubbing the back of his neck. John would swear he noticed a hint of a coquettish smile upon his lips but it must’ve been his imagination because Sherlock’s expression was rather that of a shy lamb once he opened his mouth and spoke again.
“Does... does that mean... What does that mean?” He feels like an idiot, struggling to say anything even remotely coherent.
return to the hotel room after dinner, John doesn't get to do much other than change and he isn't exactly happy about it. Because Sherlock has decided that tonight of all nights it's a perfect night for going out and have a drink and while John isn't opposed to the idea itself, he really,

Sherlock snorts at John’s remark, his eyes rather lazily flicking between John’s still incomprehensibly excited face and a folded scarf in his hand.

“Who did this to you?“ John’s voice was calm. Gravelly and raw, filled with sorrow, yet creepily calm.
Inside there's a simple but beautiful silver ring.
SHERLOCK
The first touch of John’s lips was merely tentative, light and tender, but electrifying nonetheless. Sherlock could hear himself making the softest little noise, one that made John chuckle and draw back a little, the brightest grin hanging upon his face.
On John, as he sits up in his bed, turns on the lamp on his nightstand.
Is Rosie with her?
LESTRADE
“I am sorry, I am so sorry, Sherlock, I couldn’t have chosen a worse time to tell you-“
“And you’re telling me you remember that moment?“ Sherlock’s brows knitted but the smile on his lips didn’t disappear.
“I’ll understand if you want to tone it down a bit, though,” Sherlock suddenly says and it takes a moment for John to comprehend. He can’t possibly concur with that now, though, for if he did, he could as well admit what kissing Sherlock truly made him feel like. Better keep downplaying it...
VICAR
As soon as John woke up the next morning he was prepared to discuss what happened the previous night but once he shuffled into the sitting room, he found nothing apart from Sherlock’s laptop left open on the table. It seemed that the man was nowhere around flat, no matter how many times John called for him, Sherlock didn’t show up.
I am just...
“Sherlock, w-why is your back covered in scars?“

“No, it’s fine, just… it hurts a bit, but I am fine.“
For the first time John avoided Sherlock’s eyes, simply because the brief mention of what happened between them. But instead of changing the subject he rather combed Sherlock’s curls off his forehead so he could sterilize the last remaining wound on his face.
Dreadful.
yet. You were just teasing me to make me feel better,“ John giggled, smiling into another kiss.
The corners of Sherlock's mouth curl into a shy half-smile. “Why would I want to look at anyone else? Nobody holds a candle to you.” Giving John a once-over, he walks up to him, glancing at the star-shaped scar stretched across John's left shoulder. It's the first time he gets to see it properly but he doesn't pry nor even mention it and quickly refocuses on John's eyes instead. The barely five inches between their faces make maintaining the eye contact incredibly difficult though.
“It's okay, we're used to dealing with worse,“ Sherlock assures her but more than anything, he just wants to be alone with John again. “Will that be all?”
And do you, William Sherlock Scott Holmes, take John Hamish Watson, to be your lawfully wedded husband?
(a bit desperately)
“Here?“
Before John knows it, he starts to slip over the edge of the pool and with a huge splash, he falls into the tepid water. Or, to put it more correctly,
“I have no idea what you are talking about.“
Yes... Yes, of course. I'll be right there.
, it wasn’t preposterous,“ John asserts, reaching to catch Sherlock’s arms before he's able to flee. “I think it’s incredibly sweet of you to care about my well-being like this. You thought I deserve a change and you’re damn right. You always know exactly what I need, so often before I realise it myself. Without you I’d-“John halts in the middle of sentence, averting his gaze for a second.
John returns.
Sherlock gulps, chilled to the bone. As if sensing impending disaster.
“Shut up you bastard.“ For the first time Mary let her voice raise a little, but Sherlock didn’t seem to be startled by it. At least he didn’t let it to be shown. He kept standing there with hands in his pockets and a false smug face that would turn anyone else furious, but Mary got used to his manners long ago.
“But we both now need a little time alone, I guess. And you need to rest, so… later. I’ll be back soon, don’t worry,“ he added, walking his way toward the exit.
“No, it’s not,“ John shook his head, taking Sherlock’s hand again, pressing it against his lips so to plant tiny butterfly kisses over his knuckles. “For a hundredth time – it’s not your fault. Come here, kiss me.“ Sherlock didn’t quite agree with that statement but he gave in in the end, just because it was useless quarrelling over the same old stuff over and over again.
No objection whatsoever.
“You mean that, me coming out will have an impact on… what is between us?“
Closer on John - looking at his own reflection, adjusting his collar. He smiles - a sidelong glance at the wall on his left.

But what? You can't simply tell me that two years of my life did not actually happen at all and expect me to act like it's alright. Because it's not. It's against all logic.
He grins, approaches Sherlock.
Are you not going to answer it?

“Not now, Mrs Hudson.“
John sniggers. That alone does it. No reason to think twice. “Hell no. Which... is why we-”

Sherlock opened his mouth a couple of times so he could finish what he had started, but once John so fairly brushed his wet cheeks he was suddenly short of words, his eyes fluttering shut and mouth falling open in a silent gasp. He had imagined this moment countless of times before, but the reality felt much better than any of the fantasies he could have ever come up with. But John was waiting, patiently, not making a move until Sherlock let him. No matter how intense had been the urge to finally take that lush bottom lip in between his own lips, he refused to do something Sherlock wouldn’t approve of at first.

“No, of-of course not,“ John shook his head, shifting closer to Sherlock who in the meantime did the same.

On John. Grinning, he steps toward Sherlock, closes the gap between them.

And you're going to let her get away with it.

' did you not comprehend?”
“I know you’re not stupid,“ Sherlock cut him short before John managed to finish his sentence. “You’re clever and brave, John, you’re everything a good man should be.
Eyes on Leonardo - a cold stare.
“No, you don’t. John, you-“ Sherlock draws a long, shaky breath to compose himself, fearing he might as well break down himself. “You-you don’t have to go through this alone. You can’t… You shouldn’t.“
, John,“ he growled a little lasciviously but John noticed a hint of a chuckle in his voice. “I want you to fuck me so well so I’ll forget my own name.“
“I am afraid I can’t do as you wish, John, not this time,“ he whispers. “I am not going anywhere. I am here to

“It’s
No, no I am not okay... John. I ... I need you.
Sherlock stares at the painting, puzzled. He starts to walk toward it, but stops short at the sudden burst of pain in his body. Wincing, he presses his hand to his chest, only to realise the pain is coming from his gunshot wound, now only a scar but hurting, as if fresh. As he does, John's voice echoes through the room again.
As soon as Sherlock impatiently whimpered to prompt him, he perceived, leaving an open-mouthed kiss over his throat. Once the sensitive skin vibrated beneath his lips John could only hardly prevent a moan from escaping his throat.
They kiss for a few more moments, when suddenly Sherlock stops, breathless.
share the bed with you if that’s what’s terrifying you.“
The sound that crawls out of Sherlock's throat should be classified as illegal, John thinks as he gives him a couple of strokes. Still, it's not enough, not even close. Withdrawing his hand, he shifts to pull the rest of Sherlock's clothes off and carelessly tosses them on the floor. And as soon as he does, his face turns hot red.

“Well, I didn’t do this to myself on purpose, obviously. That man I was chasing tricked me and I had to change the route. If I wanted to get to him in time there was no other option but to crash through the window so I could cut his way-“

Sherlock had only few seconds to plan the next step. He tried to collect himself, steady his breathing, think clearly, analyse the situation, but there was no point in attempting to remain calm. Once he glanced at the place the gory wound was located under the shredded piece of cloth, he lost every fragment of sanity he possessed so far. John’s got shot far enough from his heart, but Sherlock could tell that it was a no less a dangerous injury.
“Sherlock-“

Sherlock’s eyes shut close in what felt like a defeat. “You’ve thought of everything, didn’t you?“
John scowled. “So
What's that about?

Yes, well, Mary had disappeared and since you're no longer stuck in a toxic, unhappy marriage and I am free from the harrowing, alternative universe my mind had been trapped in, I thought we could, perhaps, try to return to what we had... had before.
Sherlock wavered a moment before giving a small nod. “It’s okay, do go on, please.“
You're beautiful.
Sherlock gives a long exasperated sigh. “Boring.”
“I had a very personal reason for going after Mary by myself this time,“ Sherlock uttered, shoving hands into his pockets. “And I would gladly finish what I had started if it wasn’t for that she began sending me threats. I am not so scared of her but since John is

going to change after all,“ Sherlock remarked, but John shook his head in a silent disagreement.
Sherlock shows up in the doorway again, putting a t-shirt over his head, then leans against the wall, gazing down at John like he’s just discovered the most precious gem in the galaxy. He’s got that fond, dreamy smile on his lips and John cannot be absolutely certain that he is paying attention to him but, in a way, it’s somewhat adorable.

but as soon as he realises that Sherlock might end up not eating at all, he tears off a small piece of his own toast and passes it toward Sherlock’s lips.
However alluring the temptation to lock their lips was, John didn’t want to push Sherlock, nor he wanted to do anything until he was sure that Sherlock was confident and sure enough to continue. He seemed to be still a little shy, trying to muster up enough courage, from what John could observe.
How is that supposed to help?

Holding on them. A moment later we hear footsteps - someone climbing the stairs, then enters the room, taps at the door.
“I guess- you’re not wrong,“ Sherlock sighed, closing his eyes. “But that doesn’t mean I am scared,“ he added with a raised finger. “I am just- For God’s sake-Mary is-“
SHERLOCK
CUT TO:
MYCROFT
I am very much grateful for such a distraction. In fact, I have a much better idea - we must stop taking boring cases.
“I know what that means,“ Sherlock cut him off, now standing so close to the other man their chests were almost pressed against each other’s. Neither of them flinched this time. Those few short moments of suggestive glances and ambiguity were enough for both of them to finally realise that there was in fact no reason.
Sherlock offered no reply, but there wasn’t even a need, John understood. He wavered for just a couple of moments before he turned around and headed for the bedroom, leaving Sherlock alone with his mixed thoughts and feelings.

... over
A sudden noise however roused him before he was even able to drift off to sleep. Sherlock concluded that it could have been no one but Mrs Hudson, that distinctive gait, feeble steps, breathing with difficult while climbing those steep stairs, he had no idea how he could have mistaken John for her the evening before. But then again, his mind had been preoccupied with Mary and his own judgement was proved to be clouded that day.
“Are you – are you trying to imply you want to move back in?“
“I-I mean once we-once we lie down again. Could you hold me in your arms tonight, John? I need to-I need to feel you beside me.“
we get to piss off your brother... What’s next? Free food? Hold on, it
John grins. There's no arguing against that. He slides his arms around Sherlock's shoulders and pulls him close enough so their noses are brushing. “Fair enough. But you do realise that we're both wet and we've just made the mess of the sheets
At that John instantly leaps forward to seize Leonardo's wrist. He twists him around and pushes him against the nearby wall.
Sherlock happily obeyed, prepared to listen to each advice John could give him in order to make them both feel as good as possible.
Come on, Sherlock. Next thing I learn is that you

On Sherlock, he blinks rapidly, as if in some sort of a trance, trying to think of what to do.
Sherlock opened his mouth again but John had been already shambling in the opposite direction. He rummaged for a while, searching for the rest of his clothes in the pile of mess that had been the sitting room before he turned around again, never leaving his eyes off Sherlock as he walked, much to Sherlock’s surprise toward the bathroom door instead of the exit.
Once he was back seated next to John’s bed in the afternoon, the tension was still there and the first minutes were awkwardly tedious.  But neither of them brought up what they had discussed that morning. They acted as if the conversation never happened, except of course, it did. It was almost as if they both, silently, implicitly agreed on that they won’t talk about their feelings anymore. At least not while the nurse
“I didn’t say-“
, I may not say this too often but trust me…
“Hold on, oh God, I didn’t sleep with Sherlock,“ John exclaimed but then immediately turned to the other man to make sure that Sherlock didn’t take it the wrong way.  Fortunately, he returned the glance along with a tiny half-smile upon his lips.
, of course I am bloody happy.“ Sherlock was literally beaming, smiling from ear to ear, such joy and light in his eyes that John had never seen there before. Even though his face was patched all over the place, he was gorgeous, adorable even, John had to admit.
CUT TO:
,” John chortles once after he finds Sherlock sitting on the edge of the bed. Sherlock seemed to have anticipated a different sort of a reply, if the dissatisfied frown on his face is anything to go by.
“So... you’ve been setting up since the moment we’d arrived?“ Sherlock concluded. “Hoping we were about to solve that case as soon as possible so we could jump into the shower
Damn, we really should have stayed in bed.
Caught between a rock and a hard place. Sherlock now understood what people meant when uttering those words. He did feel like trapped after all. The longer he pondered about it, about the past, the future, trying to come up with the best possible solution, trying to decide what step to take next, the louder his thoughts were, shouting at him, burning him from inside. Sherlock would have maybe collapsed right then and there under such enormous weight of hopelessness if it wasn’t for a sudden shrill croak of crows echoing somewhere in the distance that snapped him out of it. It wasn’t until then that he perceived, realising he’d already reached Mycroft’s grave.

“It’s when we met for the first time.“ One. “Your birthday.“ Two. “I only remember

“Thank you,“ he whispers, sheepishly, trying hard to not think about how their fingers brushed the moment Sherlock handed him the cup.
(fibbing)
Well, truth be told... I want you to... I mean... What I mean is that... I'd like you to stay forever, John.
John has already changed into the sleepwear and got into bed but trying to focus on anything other than the notion of Sherlock currently showering in the bathroom seems to be absolutely futile. As it happens, Sherlock steps out of the bathroom just as this very vivid image pops into John’s mind and...
“What a shame,“ John sighs, but his voice cracks in his attempt to choke back a laugh so hard. “I had prepared some more, but since you want none-“
Sherlock, doesn't reply. Fiddling with the hem of his duvet. A tad shy.
Pulled through what? What happened to me?
JOHN (CONT'D)
Sherlock can feel his breath quickening, heart hammering loudly in his ears yet he still tries to concentrate on other the sounds, sloppy noises of his cock sinking into John’s mouth, wet and nasty once John swallows around him but it’s the friction, John’s soft lips and tongue and gentle fingers pressing against the hard throbbing flesh, feelings of pleasure that are so inexplicable and sensational that not even John’s firm hand can keep Sherlock lying idly any more.
Maybe I don't want to be anywhere else.
John was bending over the tub, evidently not pleased with the water temperature although that disgruntled frown on his face might have as well been the result of him slouching in such an uncomfortable position.

John looks at the dog, then back at Sherlock.
Wider: A small, plain office cluttered with stacks of papers and files.
This time Sherlock didn’t fight. He let the tears roll down his cheeks, allowing himself to indulge in that momentarily relief. But it hardly lasted for long enough. What was dark and unwelcomed had soon crept back in, returning with such a force that pushed Sherlock down on his knees. Vicious, intrusive thoughts strangling him, drowning him in guilt, despair and anguish. He couldn’t move, almost as if he’d been chained to the ground, long forgotten images flashing in front of his eyes against his will. Past interchanging with present.
“Yeah, sex… that’s what I meant,“ John mumbled, avoiding the other man’s eyes. He felt immensely embarrassed suddenly, as if the two of them were never meant to talk about such intimacies.

He kisses John to prove it.
“But now you feel utterly gross, right?“

Christ, I can't believe you forgot.

“So can I do this?“ John sniggered naughtily, keeping his voice deep before he leaned even closer, taking Sherlock’s lobe in between his thin lips. The sound Sherlock just made was clearly an attempt to utter John’s name but once John tenderly chewed on the skin, it melted like a chocolate into a kind of moan he would be embarrassed of if his mind wasn’t completely shut off.

aware they're still kissing but it takes merely a split of a second and he catches on. And once he does... his face turns the darkest shade of pink. John can't tell whether it's a good sign or not, he but hopes it's not a sign of regret. Well, Sherlock didn't flee yet, so there's that at least.
“And frankly, your accusations are
Ten minutes ago? He's been gone that long?
“Were you expecting someone else?“ John squinted, taking the mug Sherlock offered him.

She's survived. But don't worry she's not here. Mycroft's going to take care of it. Once and for all.
Sherlock blinked at John, so puzzled he failed in his attempt to tie the belt of his gown. “Have you been standing here this entire time?“
Without hesitation, John springs up from the chair, heads for the door.
You don't have to lie to make me feel better, John. It's not working.
“Fair play,“ he nodded. “So, what is it you wanted to know, Mary… or-“ Sherlock hesitated but then he said what he’s intended to. It was more than clear what was the purpose of all this, there was no use pretending that Sherlock has no idea anymore. “I suppose I should call you by your real name?“
I... don't think anything did, we just... fell asleep in each other's arms.

Boyfriends.

“Yes.
“Your hands are soft...”
Only very reluctantly, he turns away, pushing the door open and disappearing behind.
urging him to deepen the kiss and hell, John has no idea what’s happening but this might as well be the most amazing moment of his life and he’s not going to pass the opportunity to make the best out of it.
“You and that boyfriend of yours have
“But that means this must’ve had happen while you’ve been faking your death. So when I pushed you down on the floor in that bloody restaurant-“ John’s voice cracked with sudden flush of remorse and hurt.
Sherlock’s mind goes blank for a second time already that evening, refusing to cooperate. He's having a difficult time comprehending why is John doing what he’s doing, but risking no awkward conversations in public he decides to not question John about it.
John - a small mischievous smile crosses his face.
“I already told you, John.”
“I just hoped you would,“ Sherlock shrugged. He circled around John, tossing the bag over the sofa. “Even if I couldn’t predict that you were going to stay forever. I was just trying to-“
Zooming in on the 221B on the door. Holding on for the last few moments...
“Well, but you like him, so- ah, be gentle, please.“
Mhm. I might as well think of something.
“ John’s voice suddenly quivers, fading into a long, tearful sigh.
Sherlock blinks, quite impressed with that deduction, albeit such an easy one. “Well... I was about to sugar-coat it, but oh
and then act like it was just meaningless gibberish. Or maybe he can... he's doing that right now after all and hell, John has to admit that it would probably be for the best if they didn't have that sort of a conversation in the middle of a bloody swimming pool. They're going to have plenty of time once they return to their hotel room...
“Oh, God, yes, like that,“ John growled against Sherlock’s lips, which was both arousing and concerning, considering how hard Sherlock already was. Thankfully, there was a duvet in between their bodies and Sherlock’s cock still safely covered from John’s sight. Sherlock was sure he wouldn’t last for very long if that wasn’t the case and that was something he wanted to prevent from happening.
At this...

“Why of course,“ John nodded affirmatively, trotting back with a handful of blankets he’d brought from Sherlock’s bedroom. “If I’d left just as you asked me you wouldn’t go – wherever it is you were – you wouldn’t be in such an awful condition. Look at you, you –“

And yet there was nothing near perfect about their dance. Sherlock still couldn’t bring himself to meet John’s eyes, he stared down at their moving feet instead. But he couldn’t hide his face completely. John could swear there were tears glimmering in his gloomy eyes. The mere notion of Sherlock fighting an urge to cry broke his heart, he felt as if he was about to combust if neither of them were about to say anything.
“Hey,“ the man grinned, folding his hands behind his back as he stepped closer, “hope I am not interrupting.“
“A hint?“ John rises an eyebrow, smirk hanging upon his lips. “Since when does the genius Sherlock Holmes need a hint of

“Obviously.”
Ah, splendid. Sherlock and John, I now pronounce you husband and husband. You may kiss.
Oh. You did?
“Nothing, forget it.” Flashing a forced smile, John pushes himself up and out of the bed and steps toward Sherlock. “Pool sounds great. I haven't been in ages... unless you count the incident with Moriarty,” he adds, knitting his eyebrows in a frown. It wasn't a pleasant memory.

Sherlock, for you to make a move… now I see that I should have not played a fool this time.“

“Why are you apologising? It’s…
Didn't say you were. I was merely enquiring.
John blinks, realising the other side of the bed is empty. Sheets crumpled but Sherlock nowhere to be seen.
MRS. HUDSON
“I thought you might fancy company.“
Blushing, his face practically radiating heat, Sherlock leans to press his forehead against John’s, closing his eyes in anticipation. If this is indeed a dream, he doesn’t ever want to wake up again. He’s been imagining similar scenarios ever since the moment they met but none of his fantasies had ever reached the perfection of the moment he’s found himself in right now.
I've sent about 60 texts. He's responded to none so far.

“Very sorry, John,“ he panted, trying to tangle himself in a sheet without leaving a room for John to see anything he wasn’t supposed to yet.
Funny you say that, because I've been wondering. If by any chance, you'd like to... get married... again.
“Err... the same as us? And besides, you don't know if-”
John can barely restrain himself from grabbing Sherlock by his coat collar and kiss him until his lips would be swollen. Sherlock doesn’t make it much easier for him, grinning so ridiculously beautifully once he returns, a cup of chocolate in each hand.

to give me a massage.”
“No, I am fine, more than fine,“ John smiles, grinning from ear to ear. Sherlock can hear it in his voice rather than see, feigning interest in the tree in front of him instead of looking at John, for he fears that the moment their eyes meet again he might do something entirely ludicrous.
“And you... are a marvel,” Sherlock pants, searching for John's mouth with his own. There's but an innocent stroke of lips at first, but as Sherlock lets his tongue swirl over John's, things take a whole new turn.
I was just trying to-
His voice trails off.
Sherlock... what are you doing?!

“Spaghetti it is,“ Angelo claps, turning on his heels.
John striding down the empty hospital corridor. At the door, that lead to Sherlock's ward, he barely comes to a halt. Throws open the door, practically hurtles inside...
“Oh, my heavens, Sherlock, what happened?“
On the TV. Eventually, the sounds begin to fade away...
Sherlock wished it was him. It shouldn’t have been John struggling for life in that moment, not least because of sacrificing himself for the sake of keeping Sherlock safe.
John purses his lips, his tongue heavy in his mouth. He doesn’t offer an answer, he but stares at the two women approaching fast, their voices growing louder. By the time they’re close enough to spot their faces John can be nearly certain they’re making fun of
“Just don’t let this affect you in any way, John,“ Sherlock warned him, terrified of the possible turn that sort of a dialogue could take. “I didn't say it so I could distract you from what is truly important. It doesn't matter what I... what

John stretches out his hand. Sherlock takes it.

John, gazes at him, nods understandingly. Doesn't respond though.
“Why... why would it bother me?” John's voice quavers, because God, it’s almost like Sherlock just read his mind but in the same time completely misinterpreted his thoughts, because sleeping next to him? Would most certainly not bother John in the slightest. Right opposite.
. I warn you, it’s going to be a bit different this time.“
...Since when?
SHERLOCK
“I know you lied to me about our baby,“ John continued, trying hard to not fume. “You fooled me into thinking I am going to be a father, how could you?“
“How come you can let those words out of your mouth and still act as if everything was alright,“ John gasped in disbelief. “Did you really think I am going to stay with you for any longer? After all this?“
John. Both you and know that that is no longer true and hasn't been for a long time.
John took a step back in shock, gasping confusedly but no actual words left his throat.
Forever?
Mary clenches her jaw.
Er, yes, I figured I owed you an apology. For what happened last night.
Oh, yes, I have been wrong many times, John. Especially about you. For which I feel compelled to apologise.
Now, tell me what's wrong. You sounded rather... desperate on the phone.
Will you help me?
“And that’s what makes her so dangerous, Sherlock,“ John added. “Remember what you’ve said? She wants to crush your heart and won’t stop until she achieves that or until someone stops
Slowly, John's lips spread into a smile.
Sherlock opens his mouth only to shut it tight, absently fiddling with the hem of his coat. John insisted he should keep it this time and for once Sherlock’s glad he listened. And not because of cold. Without his coat, his armour he wears to protect his vulnerable self, his heart that beats so fast now, so close to John, he’d feel almost naked.
"So what? Maybe I wanted to get off when you weren't home."
"But thank you," Sherlock continued. "For standing up to Mycroft when he wanted to take Eve away. I know you must have your doubts about whether I can raise her."
"Oh! I almost forgot why I came up here!" Mrs. Hudson took a second to peer into the mirror over the mantel and pat her hair into position, then reached into the pocket of her cardigan. "You've had a delivery, Sherlock. It came very early—I was still in my nightie."
"All right, we're going to the park. Need anything while we're out?"
"And I wouldn't want to miss my goodnight kiss from such a wonderful little girl." Solving the case had put him into an ebullient mood. He crossed the room, making a mental note to tell John about the case later tonight instead.
"Warning?"
"They match."
John cradled her in one arm, stroking the thin, dark hair on her head with his free hand. He'd forgotten the simultaneously terrifying and exhilarating sensation of holding a new-born for the first time. "Hey, sweetie," he whispered. "Look at you. You've got some big, beautiful, blue eyes, don't you? I wonder if they'll stay that colour." He glanced over again at Eurus, who was staring blankly at the wall with eyes the same pale blue shade as Sherlock's. John's gaze strayed briefly to Sherlock, then he shifted his attention back to the baby in his arms. "Let's see how big you are, then we can get you wrapped up so you won't be cold."
Over in the bed, John was trying to stop himself from laughing. "I shouldn't have done that. She was so young. She didn't mean any harm."
"She's not your job."
"Good thing you've got plenty of padding." Dad bent over and gave Sherlock a pat on his bum, then kissed the top of his head.
The living room was a bit more cluttered than usual, but only because there was a stack of empty ornament boxes neatly piled to one side. Another, larger tree had been erected near the windows, this one festooned with tinsel and glittering baubles. Every level surface in the room held an unlit candle or snowman-themed display, and the fireplace mantel hosted colored lights and several sprigs of pine.
Sherlock didn't reply with words, but he did push himself up to kneeling again, both of his hands feathering lightly over John's back as he moved. There was a second of unpleasantness as Sherlock pulled himself free and John's arse clenched in protest of the loss.
—before he settled on simply:
"No, you won't."
After a moment's hesitation, he detoured slightly, so he could walk past the corner shop down the street from their flat. He didn't really want to buy cigarettes, because John hated it when he smoked and generally would refuse to kiss him afterwards, but.... A quick smoke would calm his nerves, and that would make it easier to deal with Mycroft. And maybe John wasn't home yet. He stood on the pavement looking at the door to the shop while people bustled around him and Stone pulled towards home.
John shook his head. "Well, I hope you catch him quickly. I don't like you playing games with mass murderers."
They'd been out for nearly half an hour, so surely John would be home by now. And even if he wasn't, perhaps the sight of Sherlock and Stone walking into the flat covered in mud would be enough to chase Mycroft and Anthea from the premises.
"I know, but I want to." He tilted his head towards the bedroom and gestured at Sherlock to stand, so Sherlock did, following him through the flat towards the bedroom.
Sherlock sniffed. "We'll take a cab."
"Crisps. And coffee."
"Hmm?"
Rosie shook her head. "I figured it out on my own. Dad doesn't want me to know about you at all. He gets angry at Uncle Mycroft every year when he gives me a gift from you, but Sherlock tells him to let it be."
Sherlock sighed. John was right. They knew how the Crawfords had died, and they knew who had killed them. There was nothing particularly notable in the flat, and Lestrade had already sent the Crawfords' computers and phones and other devices back to Scotland Yard so they could be searched for any more clues as to why they had been targeted, if indeed they had been targeted and not randomly chosen by a madman. There was no reason for him to go back inside, and even less reason for John to put the braces back on and join him.
Wider: Sherlock, bolts upright in his bed, sweating, breathing hard. It takes him a moment to perceive.
-“ Sherlock parroted, shuffling out of the bed with nothing but a thin layer of cloth loosely wrapped around his body.
Somewhat absently, he lifts the mug to his lips, blows on his tea, sniffs. And as he does, a small smile crosses his lips. Finally.
Whatever excuse he’d have, John would know it’s not the truth, he knew this well enough. Sherlock was not able to lie to him anymore, nor did he want to anyway.  But for now he
“God, you’re so-“
Shut up.
He can't help it, he doesn't even pause to think of the consequences. In the heat of the moment, John reaches to grab Sherlock by the back of his neck and pulls him into another, a far more spontaneous kiss. Stunned, Sherlock forgets to close his eyes for a second but once his mind clicks and he fully perceives, his eyes flutter shut and he begins to kiss back with as much fervor as John.
Oh, why does it concern you anyway. I thought you had an enormous problem you wanted me to solve.
“You’re gorgeous,“ Sherlock gasped, stretching out his hand so he could brush John’s skin but then he wavered for a second. “May I?“ he asked softly. John offered no reply, he simply smiled and took Sherlock’s hand, allowing him to caress the star-shaped scar on his shoulder. Sherlock breathed shallowly as his fingertips tenderly brushed the jagged edges of John’s salmon pink coloured patch of skin. Then he let his fingers slide leisurely down, ghosting over the skin, eyes firmly locked on John’s as he brushed the more recently scarred spot.
(coldly)
“God, Sherlock, why didn’t you-“
“Hey, Sherlock, are you with me?“ John’s voice dispersed the darkness Sherlock was groping in, almost as if someone just struck a match, letting the light in. Once Sherlock perceived, he realised John was in fact standing above him, gently holding his arms, his face once again much closer it should be.
free,” John smirks, then resumes walking towards the reception desk. Sherlock has to gather every single bit of control he possesses so he doesn’t burst into giggles right in the middle of the lobby.
. I miss my little havoc,“ Sherlock sighed dramatically.
What??
John frowns.
Sherlock’s moan echoed loudly in the small bathroom, once, twice and then again when John grabbed his hair and pulled his head backwards, exposing his neck so to leave another purple mark in the pale skin. His other hand was still roaming dangerously close toward Sherlock’s erection, drawing circles over his inner thigh but still far enough so Sherlock had to beg for more in order to get it, unwilling to stay patient any longer.
DR. MASON
Oh, dear.
“What do we do?”
Just as the haze over his eyes clears up, he registers the tousled mop of hair tickling his chin and soon enough realises that
As soon as they gave into a messy deep kiss however, full of teeth, clumsy tongues and accidental lip biting on Sherlock’s side, Sherlock’s eyes flew wide open in sudden worry. He quickly turned them over, playfully rolling over the sheets until he was the one on top.
"Mm, okay." John didn't ask him to explain. "They went on a lot of nice holidays together. Here's their honeymoon." He lifted a hand from one of his crutches to adjust a photo on the mantel. "Married about five years."
She raised her eyebrows at Dad, and he looked at her and nodded. "Of course, if you want it."
"You don't like having to get out of your chair and into the barber's chair."
"What?" Sherlock shifted the plant to his left hand and stabbed at the button for the lift. "Of course not. Why would I be jealous of a plant?"
Sherlock blinked again. Not just a sheet of paper. Not the way it was folded—it was a card. Hand-drawn, the front of it featuring a meticulously-penciled depiction of a human heart.
"Now that I know all about ash, can we please please make something burn?"
"No. I wouldn't—no."
Lestrade threw his hands up in the air with a groan and Sherlock, smirking, left him to his own deductions. He expected to find John out in the hallway, back in his chair, having decided he'd had enough of the braces, but there was no sign of him.
Rosie shook her head, but then nodded. "All right. I'll try it. This will probably be easier than bringing them each home to meet you two without any outside witnesses."
"Boring and cliché."
"To make you stop worrying. You know how you always say 'there's always something' that you overlook and get wrong? That's what this is." He leaned back on the sofa and draped an arm around Sherlock's shoulders. "And anyway, even if you had thought about the bedrooms being upstairs, I still would've refused to let you bring my braces and crutches and we'd still be sleeping here on this sofa."
"Hit me back," John repeated, without looking up at him.
"Maybe we should stay out of it," Daddy suggested. "It's Sherlock's business, not ours, after all."
"I think someone is trying to delay her bedtime," John said, but stepped out of the way again to let Sherlock give her a hug.
He spent a few minutes working both his hands in tandem, growing more confident with each pass of his fingers and each small sigh John let out as his body grew more and more pliant. Sherlock combed through his mind palace in search of any scrap of massaging knowledge he may have unwittingly retained. Long, slow strokes, small circles with his thumbs, targeted pressure in the spots that seemed most tight. When it became clear that John's right shoulder needed less attention than the left, he switched both hands to the left only, kneading softly at the largest knot he found there. He'd expected to need to use more oil, but whatever Molly had given him worked well and John's skin stayed supple but not too slick beneath his hands. The scent was noticeable but not overpowering, and didn't register as too feminine to his nose, which is what he had initially feared.
Sherlock grabbed a wool beanie that the car's owner had left in the backseat and pulled it onto his head so he could jump out and grab John's chair and fold it up for him. John generally preferred to wrestle it in himself, but this was much faster, and John didn't try to stop him.
"Sherlock, this is serious. I should not have hit you."
Donovan picked up a pencil and used it to push the bag closer to the edge of her desk.
"Are your fathers both Scrooges about the holiday?"
"It was Uncle Mycroft's idea! He loves to build with Legos!"
A few hours ago, Sherlock had been reading Rosie a picture book—they'd been downstairs this time, sitting in the chairs by the fireplace. Rosie had been on his lap, with John in his usual spot across from them.  Every time Sherlock had glanced up, John had been staring at them. At him. At his lips, Sherlock was certain. He'd never done that before. Usually if Sherlock was looking after Rosie, John would take advantage of the chance to do something else—clean the kitchen or run a load of laundry or answer comments on his blog. But tonight he'd just sat and stared while Sherlock read. And it wasn't the first time Sherlock had caught him looking—he'd noticed nineteen distinct instances of such behavior since Sunday, the day after they had kissed. Which meant John must still be thinking about the kiss, too. And not in a negative light, or he would have avoided looking at him. Right?
"Your illegal handgun won't be of any use if Moriarty decides the next bomb should be a real one," Mycroft said.
"I know." John heaved himself onto his back again, legs landing heavily askew. "Okay, I shouldn't have slept like that. My shoulder's going to hate me today."
"I don't need to defend myself. You're not going to kill me." As he said it, Sherlock willed himself to believe it, knowing that Moriarty would be able to see if he showed any doubt or fear.
"Oh, we will. We will." John finished tightening the second caster on his chair and gave it a flick to set it spinning. "Do you think I should keep my gun on me at all times or can I take it off when we go to bed?"
John froze. "Sorry, what?"
"Yes." Sherlock tried to set Rosie down on the ground, but she clung to him, hiding her face against his shoulder. "Rosie. She's a bit shy around new people."
"What was that for?"
"Because I just realised that I thought we were friends, but I didn't know the name of your boyfriend or your cat until just now. You know a hell of a lot more about me than I know about you."
"No!" she shouted, and turned and ran out of the room.
“Sorry.” Moriarty stepped close again. “No, I’m not.”
Sherlock stood up from the bed and stretched, cracking his neck. "It would've worked better if you were still unconscious. I could crowd you more and you wouldn't be able to object."
"No, you don't, do you?” John laughed again, warmer and deeper. “One of the things I love about you, actually.”
"As it happens, yes. I did have rather urgent matters to attend to. But now I've come back, because I have what I believe Sherlock will consider to be good news to share." He lifted his chin to look past his parents and over at Sherlock, who had moved to sit in his chair while John had been in the kitchen.
"What are you doing here?" Sherlock said back at her.
"Why don't you just send a cheque to the charity that's collecting gifts? Then you wouldn't have to deliver all these toys yourself."
Sherlock scowled but didn't complain any more as Mycroft logged into the cameras that he'd placed around the building. He turned the laptop so they could all see as he replayed the footage from a few minutes earlier, showing a close-up view of a small drone flying straight into their bedroom window. They could see the glass shattering and then, seconds later, black smoke began to pour out into the alley.
"Is she?"
The noises in the hallway grew louder and the door banged open, admitting two agents and Mycroft into the office. Mycroft pulled up short, several metres away from John. "Is he all right?"
John tore off the paper and lifted the box so everyone could see. "It's a foot bath."
"Sorry, what?" Rosie and John asked at the same time.
"I know." Sherlock's whole body rocked as he nodded. "And I know you're here to help me, and I do appreciate it." He rubbed his hands along his thighs, fingers sliding over the smooth fabric.
He pulled his phone from his jacket pocket. Nothing important since last night: a few hundred new hits on John's latest blog post, no new activity on his own. Two missed calls from Mycroft, followed by a text that read simply, "Call me."
"Jesus, Sherlock. Really? I have to listen to those things every time I want to hear you make that sound?"
He picked up the jar of jam and waved it in her direction.
Sherlock frowned. He knew better than to try telling John that it wasn't safe for him to leave the flat, but he also didn't want him to leave the flat. Admittedly, staying cooped up here under guard wasn't ideal, but at least they would be together. "You could skip it, just this once."
"Well, I certainly wasn't expecting to have any, not with the way you and your brother are. John, you need to cut a hole in the top of the box so she can put her head through."
"You didn't know," Sherlock said, pushing himself up to sitting. "And he's unlikely to call you back a second time to check, so everyone wins."
"Never. Don't even think such a thing."
John squinted at the notebook, seeing how Sherlock had highlighted a report of a stolen wallet found in a skip, intact except for a missing driving licence. If he hadn't known better, John might have thought it was a record of Sherlock's own crimes. "You did all this last night?"
He took two large steps to catch up to her as she climbed, his mind racing. Clearly, the pregnancy was the reason she was here—it loomed foremost in her mind—but why would that lead her here? She intended to keep the baby, hence the protective hand across her front and her firm grip on the handrail. And even if she didn't want the child, she wouldn't come to John for help—there were plenty of other doctors with more expertise in such matters.
“I have called him.” He pulled his phone out and hit the button to dial his number once more. No answer, again. He didn’t bother leaving a message this time.
"She would have called us instead of letting her in!"
"Jesus, your hand. Not going to last." John pumped his hips. "Keep going. Please."
Mycroft rolled his eyes, but whatever disapproving remark he was about to make was drowned out by sirens as the first fire engine turned onto Baker Street.
"Sherlock, she gave birth yesterday. If she'd been in hospital, she'd have doctors and nurses monitoring her to make sure she's all right. I'm just doing my job."
He brushed a hand against her knee as he straightened up, an automatic gesture of comfort, and she flinched away at the touch, closing her legs and pulling her knees up as close to her chest as she could manage.
John nodded, grateful that she didn't pursue the topic of what close friend of his might now have a baby. God, what was going to happen once the media found out that Sherlock Holmes had a child? He shook his head and called Rosie's name, and a moment later she came trotting out of the living room, holding Mr. Bear in her arms.
"You are," John agreed. "But what if I do this?" He brought his mouth to Sherlock's again, this time coordinating his tongue's movements with those of his right hand, while his left hand fondled Sherlock's balls, occasionally reaching back further to stroke between his cheeks.
John nodded. "That's what I thought, too. I would've been up in the flat, but Mrs. Hudson caught me when I got back from the clinic. She wanted me to meet Leon. A minute later something hit the building—we could hear the glass breaking upstairs. All the people in Speedy's were panicking, so I tried to get everyone out calmly, hoping that by the time I did you would've made it downstairs with Stone, if you were up there."
He spun in a circle, surveying the crowd that was gathering several metres away from the building.
"Don't kick my dog. Where is John?"
After a quick bath, she got into her pyjamas and John lay down next to her on her bed to read the book. She fell asleep halfway through it. He rolled onto his back on the tiny sliver of mattress he was allowed and let the book drop carefully to the floor. If he'd had another six inches of space, he would have closed his eyes and gone to sleep right there himself, but he didn't want to disturb her by trying to move her closer to the wall. And he still had things to do before he slept: the washing up from dinner, laundry since he hadn't been here on Saturday when he normally did it, not to mention having a shower himself.
"I know. I recognise that expression." John raised his eyebrows at Sherlock's reflection.
"I took Stone for a walk."
"We're going shopping to buy each other's Christmas gifts."
"Don't what?"
"You've helped me with minor medical procedures before and I know you're not usually squeamish, so get over it and do what I tell you to do. Get me a set of sheets, then go wash your hands." He knew from long experience that although Sherlock didn't always take well to commands, there were a few specific situations where he needed John to take charge, and this was definitely one of them.
"You heard what he said." Sherlock leaned forward slightly in his chair, still doing an admirable job of pretending to be calm and in control.
"Yes. Remember they came to our Christmas party together?"
He pushed away the appeal of the idea. "Maybe you can tell me about it later. I'm feeling a bit...warm. I think I want to go get some air."
"Because I would really appreciate the sex right now," John continued. "It's been a very rough few days and I know it's only going to get worse and I thought this little bit of fun would be a good release. But if you don't want to—"
"They will never be anywhere near each other," John said. "If you ever let Eurus have any direct contact with Rosie, you will find out that Rosie's not the only one around here with a gun. And trust me, my bullets are not made out of foam." He unclenched his fists and turned away, leaving the kitchen without bothering to wait to see Mycroft’s reaction.
Sherlock shrugged and lay back down with his head on the arm of the sofa. "Tonight's a half dose on the schedule, so that should help." He hadn't taken anything besides some paracetamol last night, and had once again proven to himself that he'd become dependent on his antidepressant to sleep soundly.
A few minutes later John returned to the bedroom to collect his phone and watch and wallet. "What are your plans for today?" he asked Sherlock.
"I promise—wait, any killing? What if it's justified?"
Sherlock stared at him without answering and John continued. "Even if I followed through like I was supposed to, would it be worth it? There might be no benefit at all, and even in the best-case scenario it would likely be only small improvement. I'm not going to put the rest of my life on hold for months or years just so I can end up feeling temperature and pressure in my whole left leg instead of just my thigh. If...if in another ten years or so, they've made enough progress to have any sort of treatment that's been proven to make a significant difference, then it might be a different story, but for now...." He shook his head. "I don't think it's worth it to me."
"Do not tell me you're in the mood for—"
Molly's smile looked sincere. "That's...amazing, really, that you finally.... Watch out, her hands are greasy."
"Oh! Baby Yoda. Right. Good. Rosie does want that."
Until now. Mycroft personally thought nothing of what Eurus was saying—she was trying to get under Sherlock's skin, obviously. Unfortunately, Mummy and Daddy did not share that opinion.
"I tried nursing her a few times, but it didn't work. Sherlock's more patient with her than I am. He got her to take a bottle before she fell asleep just now."
"You don't have to—"
"I don't care if you believe me. It won't affect the situation either way."
"How are we...." John's brow wrinkled. "Oh, is Molly working?"
"You don't. I took them."
"But why do we have to stay here?" Lestrade sounded petulant, and Sherlock didn't blame him.
"She wouldn't," Sherlock said. "At least, I don't think she would. She didn't seem like she wanted to die this morning. Did she?" He turned to John.
"I did lots of unpacking!"
He didn't bother to pretend otherwise. "I was just thinking of what I'd like to do to you."
John stared in confusion as she turned around and headed back down the stairs. He shook his head and continued into Sherlock's flat. There was no sign of Sherlock; he must have gone to bed, as he'd said he would. He could be asleep already. Maybe this could wait—no. John didn't need the ghost of his wife or a mysterious text from a dominatrix to tell him that if he didn't do it now, he'd never work up the nerve to do it again.
Sherlock stepped back, silently watching the two of them interact. A fire was an excellent idea, but really not necessary, in his opinion. He was already much warmer and cozier than he had been in a long, long time.
"What are you doing?"
"Yes, you are. You're not even—" John dropped his head to give him a quick swirl of his tongue and then exchanged his mouth for his hand once more.
"You—you've been spying on me the whole time I've known you?" The hurt in John's voice was painful to hear, though this twist in events was much more palatable than the idea that he had been sleeping with her.
He'd finished up his chores and shower and was finally headed to bed himself when his phone chimed with a text. Usually only Sherlock would text him at this time of night, but it wasn't his alert. Was it Eurus, again? He opened the message.
“It’s off the air,” Mycroft said. “We’re the only ones who can see it now.”
John felt a moment of compunction, only because he knew he shouldn't let his personal feelings about Eurus interfere with her care. He shook his head. "It doesn't matter exactly how old you are. Any pregnancy over age 35 is technically high risk, but if you got this far with no issues, then you're probably fine." He made himself soften his shoulders and uncurl his hands. "I need to check to see how far your cervix has dilated, and then I'll take your blood pressure. Is that all right?"
"Not particularly impressed," she said, shaking her head. "John, you could definitely do better."
Probably not. Despite the findings of the
John jumped back into the conversation. "Okay, Rosie. It doesn't matter what we think of people you like. This is just a first date, right? So tell us what you like about each of them."
"I'm not—" He sniffed and dropped the bag onto Donovan's desk. "Fine. There you are. They're no use to me now anyway, since we've found the bodies they came from."
“And that is?“
Sherlock...
SHERLOCK
John shows up, his eyes going to the mistletoe. He giggles.
“You took your time,“ she proceeded to say, pointing at Sherlock’s phone then. “Oh, you won’t need that anymore.“ She reached for a little switch on the wall and turn on the little flash bulb above her head, filling the little space around them with more vivid light.
(sternly)

but all it takes is a beat and the next second they’re gone, not much as glancing at either of them.
SHERLOCK
That happened just once and no, nothing of that sort. Mrs. Hudson, can you sit down here for a minute? I need to tell you something.
“I should go,“ Sherlock said absently, eyes pinned upon the closed door instead of John.
Sherlock swallows, panic in his voice almost palpable. “No,
“Are you sure?“ Sherlock whispered sheepishly. “This is rather…

Sherlock and John... You've asked me to make the introduction quick-

Alright, she can take it.
“No, but we weren’t quite serious either, were we?“

“Sherlock, please,“ John hissed through his teeth, “if what you are about to do, has anything to do with Mary… you
On Sherlock, pale and weak, lying still in the bed, as if sleeping. Heart rate monitor beeping.
,“ he uttered, emphasising each word, his voice as gloomy as if there was nothing but darkness and venom behind that simple phrase. “Ring any bells?“
John came back out a few minutes later, dressed for bed. "I left your toothbrush and your meds out on the sink for you."
Ignoring the mystery of why Sherlock had kept one of his old t-shirts in his drawer for the better part of a decade, John tipped his head in the direction of the kitchen. "Go get some scissors—not the ones from my med kit—and slice off about a foot of the bottom fabric. And find some big safety pins, if you can."
Donovan burst into laughter and Lestrade threw up his hands in a gesture of frustration. "Nope, gotta draw the line somewhere. Go on home and clear your mind there. Or I'll have to bust you for public indecency."
"Like maybe not killing so many people?" John wasn't trying to be light-hearted, but God, this whole situation was frankly ridiculous if he thought about it for too long.
He began to compile a list of possibilities but had only thought of two when the telly emitted a short buzz and then Moriarty’s voice filled the room.
Sherlock glanced at John, then cut his eyes to John's mobile. John grabbed it and began to type.
"Sherlock!"
John finished eating and excused himself, but Sherlock lingered at the table a while longer, letting Mummy and Mrs. Hudson wait on him. They were bickering over who should pour him a second cup of tea when Sherlock heard the front door open and Daddy speaking to someone. He frowned, straining to hear who he was talking to.
"Oh, no, no, it wasn't her." Mrs. Holmes dropped her handbag onto the coffee table and put her hands on her hips, looking around the flat. "Where is she? I haven't seen her in ages, not since that concert the two of you played for us last Easter. I've been so worried about her ever since she got out. And to think she's had a baby without any of us ever knowing she was expecting! Where's the baby?"
John tried to give him a smile. He knew that Sherlock didn't really understand, not in the same way that someone who had grown up without money could, but he appreciated the sentiment all the same.
"I won't worry about it, because I don't do it."
"No, it's all right. I just don't have the same sex drive I used to, and it takes a long time and it's always a big production if I want to come, but you—nothing's changed with you. You can still have a quick wank whenever you want, and you should."
. Today we have a special guest, Dr. John Watson!” He waved his hand dramatically and stepped to the side to give another view of John, who hadn’t moved at all. Moriarty stretched an arm towards the camera and it zoomed in, showing a close-up of John’s face.
He stood up from his chair, the sleepy feeling he'd had a moment ago entirely gone, replaced by an almost giddy sense of daring. John glanced up only briefly before looking back down at whatever horror story of national or international import he was currently reading. "You going to bed, then?"
She was in the doorway to Speedy's, being helped outside by her bodyguard.
—would squeal to John (literally) the moment she caught a whisper of what I have been thinking about
"And something to eat," she said, looking down at Eve again, who had her mouth against her breast but seemed to be falling asleep. "Eggs. Eggs sound good."
Sherlock gathered himself, trying to keep his voice light and even. "I was quick enough to track down your former employees before you could kill any more of them."
Of course. Not hard to interpret at all, really. John didn't want to admit, perhaps even to himself, that he had enjoyed kissing a man. Sherlock had long suspected that John might be bisexual but in denial about it, and now here was another bit of evidence to support that theory.
Sherlock didn't know precisely what he was listening for, but he didn't hear any wheezing or otherwise alarming sounds, though his ear lost contact as John's forced cough turned into a longer stretch of hacking. He sat up and ran his hand up along John's chest and neck, pausing to rub the rough stubble on his chin with his thumb. "We'll leave you to sleep more. Rosie and I are going to watch another film, though there's some disagreement as to which one."
John wrinkled his brow, then gasped. "Oh, God. Sherlock. I forgot. I completely forgot. How could I?"
Sherlock stumbled back, catching himself on the stone wall with a grunt.
Mycroft faced them both. "Yes. Well. I am pleased to learn that you didn't have sex with my baby sister, Doctor Watson. Though in hindsight, she is a bit your type, isn't she?"
"Yes." Sherlock nodded, trying not to stare too openly at John's lips and throat as he chewed and swallowed. He cut his gaze to Rosie, instead, who lifted the plate of biscuits towards him.
"Yeah, she is. For right now, at least. You called me to help you as a doctor and I'm seeing that through, and then I'm done. Okay?" He dragged his chair back to its usual position, several feet away from Sherlock's, and headed off towards the bedroom.
Molly's smile faltered. "Is he all right? I thought if you'd left him, he must be okay, but—"
And whose fault was that? Sherlock's, for being so damn magnetic? Or John's, for not being able to control his own desires? But he had been controlling himself, for years, since the day they met. That control had slipped, just the tiniest bit, over the last two days—understandable, he thought, given everything that had happened. He'd been too concerned with Eurus and the new baby to remember to keep himself in check. He'd have to be careful, get himself back under control again. Which meant he'd have to stop thinking about how it had felt yesterday, to have Sherlock's arms around him while he was panicking on the kitchen floor. Or how it had been even better today, to lean into the weight of Sherlock's hand on his back as they held Rosie together. Thank God she had been there, or John might not have been able to stop himself from pulling Sherlock into his arms for a kiss.
"Okay, thank you everyone!" Lestrade clapped his hands together once. "That was lots of fun. I'll be sure to drink my wine before the new year, so I can start January with my usual resolutions."
He pushed away a thread of excitement that flared at the prospect of hearing from Moriarty, and stabbed at the screen with a finger. He could hear Moriarty's fake, cheerful voice before he even put the phone to his ear.
"No. You stay here," John commanded. "We are going to help you, just give us a minute. Sherlock." John pointed to one of the chairs at the desk.
Lestrade said that John had told him he was leaving, but Sherlock had been too wrapped up in what he was doing to notice him trying to get his attention. And John wouldn't have wanted to venture very far into the kitchen because the floor was covered in blood and he wouldn't be able to manoeuvre around it very well with the braces.
"Can I just stay in here for a while? I know Sherlock's having fun torturing DI Donovan about the solution to the case she's working on, and I don't want to make him leave."
He made himself re-focus on the case in front of him. The fingers did appear to belong to a couple under forty: the skin was smooth, with no visible wrinkles or age spots, though the ring on the man's finger appeared to have been sized before he'd gained weight. Sherlock could see a smooth indentation on the woman's finger that indicated another ring had been removed: of course, an engagement ring. Moriarty had made at least that much effort to make the illusion match Sherlock and John. Or perhaps she'd worn a diamond big enough to make it worth stealing.
