8:45 PM
So many booze bottles.
Sherlock Fucking Holmes, in jeans and grey T-shirt and slate-grey trainers, leaned against her doorway. She hadn’t even heard him open the door.
“Monday?” Violet echoed, stalling for time, “This coming Monday?”
“How did it make you feel?”
She looked at her left hand, wrapped in white gauze, squeezing and releasing.
Then she left him to clear up the mess.
Sherlock texted Mycroft the location of the new
“Nothing left to the imagination in that frock. The décolleté almost went all the way down to her belly button. Bikinis covered more than that gown.”
Violet debated whether or not she should retrieve her gun from the piano bench, but then had a better idea. “
John opened his mouth then closed it again as Sherlock took another placid sip of tea. Staring at the lees floating in the remaining amber liquid, he gruffly said, “Thanks.”
“Nope,” Sherlock kept his hands in his pockets.
“’Twas trained by the best,” Jim said modestly.
Then John noticed they were bound together with an USB cord.
“Well, my dog is eating one of your experiments.”
“So, I’m supposed to trust you when you tell me you won’t hook up with John again?”
“Then get your arse back inside the posh house so I can turn the cameras back on,” Wiggins had said laconically to Sherlock. “Then I’ll shut my devices off until sunset. But I got this,” and he held up an old pager, circa 1998. It was the size of a brick. “Battery life lasts longer than a mobile’s does. And it’s got a vibrate option as well.”
“Did you know?” John demanded Violet. Before she could answer, he wheeled around on Sherlock, “Did
Violet thought, but then her mouth went dry as Mycroft’s acidic words flew back to her when he had heartlessly sent the two of them to save Sherlock from Jack Woodley last April:
“Sell this place,” John leaned back in his chair. “Honestly, what are we doing with a terrace house when a flat will do? We don’t need all this space.”
“My pretty little thief?” Dupin chuckled, definitely amused now. “Well, this sounds very interesting, indeed. Anything else?”
“What are you doing here?” Violet hissed as Sherlock adjusted the tiny strap holding his frock up over his broad shoulder. “

Her mobile vibrated a few minutes later:
Violet curled up in the bed she had shared with him only two nights ago. Granted, nothing
Sherlock continued to swish his bow back and forth. “I told you, you can always come home, John.” He looked down at his bow and violin as if he had never seen them before, “Any other requests? Brahms? Or maybe something Gaelic, I learnt a few Highlands tunes, a long time ago. I’d have to visit my Mind Palace to retrieve the memory on how to play them…”
John studied his drink. “I don’t feel like being interrogated, Violet.”
In fact, those shoes may very well have belonged to someone’s granny. They looked like she found them at a jumble sale.
He tugged on Mary’s sleeve and she sat back down. “When he was a little boy, something… dreadful happened to him and, well… let’s just say relationships will never be easy for him. Especially, ah,
In other news, Sherlock's sick as a dog, Violet's being run ragged, Mary's lying her ass off and John is getting ready to punch Mycroft in the face.
“Will you come back?”
… “Give me a minute to recoup and I’ll be ready.”
“John, I ingested a very dangerous amount of arsenic during the Copper Beaches case,” she reminded him. “We both know arsenic is a carcinogen as well as a toxin.”
“Oh, I’ll get it later,” he said negligently, picking up his fork.
“Oh my God, stop, just stop, shut up!” Lestrade squawked, holding up his hand to stop Sherlock from talking.  “I don’t want details. I don’t want to picture the two of you...” He grimaced, then inhaled sharply then exhaled slowly. “Right. So. Molly said she told you to stay out of the picture except to pop in once in a while as Uncle Sherlock, right?”

“What does this have to do with
“Did she kill him,” John whispered. “Sherlock, the Senator, did she…?”
“Doesn’t love you,” Sherlock finished.
obvious…”
She looked very Mary Watson, almost defiantly Mary Watson. She wore a lavender t-shirt, khakis shorts and her beloved old white trainers. Her short platinum hair was held back from her face with two tiny lavender clips. She ordered a grande iced hazelnut macchiato. She also carried a rucksack as well as a very small handbag, only big enough for her driver’s license and bank card.
Honoré grinned as he merged into traffic. “You must be the fiancée,” he glanced at Violet in the wing mirror. “I’m Jack, Jack Honoré, at your service.”
Violet chirped in, “Don’t let the door hit you on your bony ass on the way out,
living…
Violet fussed with the hem of her jumper instead acknowledging his peevish retort. “And I’m just so fucking insecure right now.”
. John thought. There was just something endearingly pure and heartrending about Sherlock’s temperament, if one subtracted the staggering genius from it, of course. The defensive detachment camouflaged Sherlock’s intense curiosity about everything and everyone. The eccentricity and fierce intelligence helped him keep those would do him harm or distract him from his precious Work well away from him. He had learned the hard way how necessary it was to hide his greatest vulnerability away from the world. Bury it under layers of icy detachment, odd mannerisms and strange hobbies.
He had never uttered those words, even in jest, before. But he meant every single one of them.
“Well, it’s a pleasure to meet you, Miss Dobney,” John straightened up. “Now, I’m sure Mr. Holmes would not mind if you used his bath for a nice long soak.”
“Three ideas,” Sherlock said, going to the broom cupboard, throwing the door open.
“Go on, Mrs. Watson,” rumbled a gentle, familiar,
“Yes, how inconvenient for her to get murdered without her identification card,” John felt Sherlock Holmes possess him for a moment. He closed his eyes. “Sorry, I’m sorry. That was rude. I am a bit short on sleep. Now then,” John pulled his  little notebook and pen out. “May I please have the names of the victims that were identified?”
“Wha’?”
“My son’s name is Rupert,” Mrs. Hudson pushed the platter of biscuits towards Molly. “Everyone calls him Scooter.”
No one noticed the Ruger SR9 tucked into the waistband of her jeans. Or the knife in her boots: an illegal serrated knife.
Every single living man in the room visibly cringed.
There has been a change in plans...
chess.
The worst bit was the dinner. Instead of whipping up one of her usual, hearty English feasts of roast lamb and boiled potatoes or beef Wellington, Mary had an Indian buffet catered in instead.
“I won’t let him. If he kills you then I get killed. I’ve been dead twice now. It’s getting tedious.”
It didn’t shake anymore. Now it tingled and burned and was horribly stiff, like she had been outside in the snow without a glove. She curled and uncurled her fingers, staring at it as if willing her fingers to obey her command.
He wondered if Lestrade would let him borrow Alex MacDonald to do some digging.
Evie Payne-Ellis…
Kneeling in front of town car, hand on bonnet to steady himself, Sherlock shook his head. But he kept his other hand over his mouth. Meanwhile, Gladstone whined and nosed the side of Sherlock’s head, asking to be petted.
“I know this is difficu-” Dimmock started sympathetically but Violet sawed him off with a “Shush” and she closed her eyes for a moment, thinking.
She didn’t run across the street, but walked quickly, with purpose, striding towards the throng of sweaty yogis, all chattering in German. Clad in the black hoodie, a grey T-shirt and black yoga bottoms, she blended in with the crowd, keeping her eye fixed on that mane of luxurious chestnut hair...
…” Sherlock murmured, “This was purchased in America…but that doesn’t help us as it could have been purchased from one of the millions of the giant box stores there.”
After their second and last meeting, she knew for certain that Miss Smith was no mild-mannered ladylike office manager. Anderson’s efforts hadn’t been enough. Despite the massive fight she put up, Donovan had been dragged out of her own home and knocked out. She awoke hours later, finding herself zip-tied to a chair in a room full of explosives. She also wore a heavy suicide-bomb vest. Her chair was also rigged to blow.  If she somehow freed herself from her bounds, if she got out of her seat… boom.
But he snorted, deterring her impulse. “Sorry? You shouldn’t feel sorry. You should feel terrified.”
Naturally, that’s when everything started going straight to hell.
your scarf?”
when it was just the two of them alone in their hotel room on their last night. If he hadn’t sobbed on Sherlock’s shoulder like a little girl and had kissed him instead. Kissed him there in Paris, instead of at Baker Street like an idiot. Kissed him, pulled that suit jacket off, unbuttoned his shirt, pushed him down to the floor while kissing that gorgeous long white neck and running his fingers through the unruly mop of black curls and…
Tuesday afternoon
Jim Moriarty was still out there.
No Violet. No John. - MH
best efforts to make me believe otherwise.”
But he highly doubted that Violet would appreciate him wandering around in the buff right now.
Or how she looked into his eyes unflinchingly, without a shred of self-consciousness.
“It’s only been a few weeks, John,” Mary sprinkled bits of crushed walnuts over the muffins. “Even if the boy wasn’t fucked up, I think, was your professional diagnosis?”
An old memory echoed in John’s head just then:
“Hello?” he said into the mobile.
BUT -  I have a fic to post.
Wednesday afternoon
Which, she wasn’t, of course. Only Sherlock knew she didn’t act precariously but Lisbeth and Green were catching on. “Give or take,” she shrugged.
Her actual surname was Hunter. Her true nationality was American. She had gotten caught up in Jim Moriarty’s web in the most extraordinary way. If John hadn’t personally witnessed some of these events, he would have scoffed. Her situation was too unbelievable, too much like an action film. A James Bond flick.
Now every kiss Victor placed on Sherlock’s lips, cheekbones and throat felt like a jagged broken piece of that promise, as if that vow had been made out of nothing stronger than glass.
within you. But you are as blue as the sea. I wonder,” he grinned at Sherlock,“I wonder if I can deduce you like Mr. Holmes can. If I can determine why you are so sad.”
,” Dupin swung his coat on. “
“I promised the lads that if they were good boys, Daddy would take them to Disney,” Chibs gave her a wide toothy grin.
.  Um…” Violet rubbed her forehead, trying to make out the second word. “Valley…. Valley ….” She squinted at the next word.
John had a feeling that this conversation was going to go about as well as an unexpected burst of flatulence during church.
“Not much to tell. We have to meet Dupin at five. I’d like to wash up and eat before we do so, is that alright?”
Half of Sherlock’s mouth quirked up in amusement. “Her journalism friend does call her that as a nickname, yes. She prefers her handle,
“Oh, yeah, sorry,” the stoned bearded hipster released her as his friend asked, “Are you filming like a YouTube video or something? Some sort of hidden camera stunt thing?”
about that… it was scary and gory and a
Drop a line and let me know how you are.
“Did you come from a crime scene? Did you come from a
“Text me then. Otherwise, shepherd’s pie and a nice salad?”
“I think you’re full of it,” Mary sneered. “Violet Hunter is dead. She died in a plane crash.”
Her brow crinkling, she envisioned a room full of filing cabinets. She then pictured a drawer pop open and flash cards came flying out, twirling around. On one side of the card was the English word, one side the Farsi script… but when she tried to mentally grab a card, it would flutter away like a piece of rubbish on the breeze…
Mycroft decided to tell John the truth.
things?”
“Oi! The meter’s running, mate,” the cabbie shouted at them, ruining the light-hearted mood.
John clutched the crutches. He didn’t dare text, didn’t dare breathe, didn’t dare move.
opened his mouth to speak, but John cut across him: “Some silence would be marvelous right about now, yeah?”
)  John was muttering something, but Sherlock wasn’t quite sure if it was English. It was a heady mixture of cursing, helpless moaning and dirty talk.
“Mary,” Violet repeated acidly. “Let me guess. John doesn’t want her in prison or dead.”
“You can make a more substantial living by being a doctor again.”
Papa Bella also made political connections and donations, learning from his predecessors how much to shrewd give, how to subtly influence and when not to be so subtle.
She sat on the edge of his bed, wearing a black jumper, jeans and sensible black boots. Her luggage was on one side of her, her dog on the other. She had been petting her dog when he called her name as he stood in the doorway. She didn’t look up, so he said, “It’s time.”
“No, well, yes,” John spluttered. “Mycroft implied it was bad, but you never told me.”
have told him! You should have stopped him before he even made a move.”
John turned to see Sherlock positively shaking with suppressed laughter. “Shut up,” John said weakly. “Just… shut your mouth for once in your life.”
Leaving her to soak, he retreated to his computer in the lounge.
Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose. “It makes sense,” he finally said. “
“Harry…who?”
The man’s greyish curls were receding and his beard was scraggly, like a hillbilly, but she would know that face
“You can call me John.”
“Something this huge should come from you. “
“Easy,” Violet stabbed a slice of duck, some lettuce and a few green beans. “Your brother is a homophobic piece of shit.”
Mary opened her handbag, held up a plain white envelope, stuffed with money. “Miss Smith and I lied to you. I do apologize, but this isn’t a job for Sherlock. It’s a job for
“I did,” Sherlock coughed again. “I told him I wanted to solve the Rucastle case first then we can discuss the possibility of friendship.” He rubbed his sternum, wincing.
Mycroft arched one slender brow. “Consider yourself on probation and final warning. Proceed with extreme caution.” He leaned forward and hissed, “Get that brat and her new minders out of America posthaste, assuming that is where you stashed her.”
“Right,” John turned away from the sculpture and followed Sherlock.
true. John would not abandon Susan… but neither would Mary. And Mary would never let him take Susan to Baker Street, no matter how much safer that block of flats was than this cardboard cut-out terrace house.
Violet wished she hadn’t eaten anything at all. Her stomach started to hurt again.
He fired off another text.
“Can’t John just come over an-” Sherlock started to whine.
John stared at Dupin, dumbfounded. “You should have told us.”
“Use a secure chat room in Hackers’ Republic and we can discuss our findings. We’ll figure out what Valley of Fear means and what that old bastard Moriarty is up to,” Lisbeth had said somberly. “He won’t win, the old creep.”
“I know,” John tried not to sound miserable. “I mean… if it was just Mary, I wouldn’t stay. It’s not as if she wouldn’t be able to handle herself, it’s just… Susan.”
“Now what?” Irene resisted the urge to cover herself with her hands. Strange, how she had flaunted her body for money all these years. But only now, with a loaded gun pointed to her chest, did she actually feel truly vulnerable.
on him ignited an inferno of rage that would have put John Watson’s temper to shame.
Talk to you soon – JW
“What? No.” Rucastle felt his bowels turning into water.
Regretfully, Mycroft scratched Mary off his short list of people who could possibly be aiding Violet in her flight from 221B. But this little visit was not a complete waste. It was always good to remind Mrs. Watson who really was in charge. Plus he had acquired another piece of the puzzle as to what exactly happened in Magnussen’s penthouse that night.
Sherlock plucked the mobile from out of John’s fingers. Hit Mary’s contact information and hit Dial. “Hello Mary, what seems to be the trou…” he trailed off. Soon he was pacing. When John opened his mouth to ask a question, Sherlock silenced him with a raised finger. “We’ll be there in forty-five minutes… maybe an hour, depending on traffic. Yes, we’ll both be there. Do not touch anything else. Do not answer the door or phone for anyone other than us. Keep Susan out of the kitchen.” He rang off then said quietly to John, “Get dressed.”
… John thought dreamily as he ran his hand from Sherlock’s ribs slowly, slowly up to Sherlock’s face, his thumb tracing those impossible cheekbones. As he felt Sherlock’s hips rock against his in a breathtakingly wicked way he hadn’t dreamt possible, he thought,
John got the hint right quick. He let her go and watched her hobble down the last three steps.
“Then who are we chasing after?”
“No,” Violet said stiffly as she cracked a can of 7-Up open and mixed herself a stout drink.
“Wrong,” Sherlock intoned. “The burning is ritualistic.”
Hands on hips, Lestrade grumbled, “Do I even want to know?”
“I would like to discuss the safe return of my wife to England, brother mine.”
“As for the mole, well, obvious, false information was planted to lead MI-6 into believing that the mole was in Paris, when in reality, the mole is in London. They are completely off the mark in their pursuit,” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “It is not an agent who is leaking secrets to the Red-headed League. It’s someone they interact with everyday, but is all but invisible. Someone who has access to MI-6 buildings, to their offices and computers, but someone actual agents wouldn’t consider a threat. Someone in the janitorial staff, a housekeeper of sorts.”
“I needed to buy time,” she leaned up against the alley wall, drawing her arms and legs closer to her. “I need time to figure out what to do… but,” she laughed again, bitterly this time. “I can’t deliver something that doesn’t exist.”
“I know,” Dupin tilted his head, a little smile on his thin lips. “The teacher comes when the student is ready to learn the lesson.”
…Ignored the fact that her left fingertips felt completely numb.
She did get the pleasure of killing Jack Woodley, after he had kidnapped and tortured her.
Curious, Victor studied it as Mycroft slid it open. The mobile made him think of the communicator thingamabob Captain Kirk had used in the old
“Oh my God,” Hope pressed her hand to her lips, trying to compose herself.
Sherlock hesitated, the Earl’s ruined face swimming in front of him.
Sherlock sat, feeling like he had during that brief period he had gone to primary school and had been called to the headmaster’s office after one of his experiments had gone horribly wrong. “I… wasn’t making very rational decisions before I used, I’m embarrassed to admit. It was all a blur, for real this time, not like when I dropped the CIA agent 23 times onto Mrs. Hudson’s bins.”
as she sprinted across the lounge, nearly tripping over the tails of Sherlock’s dressing gown. She threw open the lid of her piano bench and stuffed the weapon inside. She covered it with sheet music for good measure and slammed the lid shut.
“And he’ll want me to witness the theft,” Sherlock coughed and grimaced. “This
She felt sick with regret.
“I… I think so, I mean, I’ll try.”
The Professor put down his tea and clapped his hands. “Bravo, that is what I like to see, teamwork. Oh yes, you two would do very well underneath me instead of drowning in Holmes’ wake. But, you’re not convinced yet, let me give you a final bit of incentive.”
“Illogical, Moriarty’s suicide,” Sherlock murmured. “There was no evidence he had planned on ending his life, only that he wished to just end mine. I didn’t realize the extent of that miscalculation until I reached the rooftop and he started talking about the futility of staying alive.”
“No, I do not,” Mycroft sounded crisp, almost military. “Does anyone else know?”
“I wish you wouldn’t,” Sherlock let his eyelids droop again, as if dropping off to sleep.
,” Violet looked at Mary unflinchingly.
“Oh, is that all? I would have doubled his fee for
While he had helplessly watched the A&E nurses and doctor tend to John, Sherlock had also been texting Violet to find out what in the world was happening to her and Mary. He had paced restlessly while the doctor stitched John up and his mobile stayed resolutely silently.
“I’m profoundly glad that my Homeless Network did not have to fish you out of the Thames,”
“A shadow.”
“Yeah, I know,” she shook her head ruefully. “He’s a Drama Queen.”
Mary bade him good morning and made her escape.
“… as your own child.”
“What?” John and Sherlock said at the same time.
Suddenly the short distance between them yawned wide like a chasm. John felt golden warmth steal over him as he languorously ambled towards Sherlock, a sensation he thought he’d never feel ever again...
He closed his eyes again, concealing his eager anticipation to finally foil his brother.
He also ordered random surveillance checks on Sherlock’s mobile and Internet usage.
“But now I know she was pissed off because Dupin was glossing over just how bad his house was. Dupin made it sound like he just needed someone to run errands and do chores, grocery-shopping, throw in a load of laundry, while he’s working. I had
“Your soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend? Are you serious?”
“Don’t talk about her like that,” Victor snapped. “She’s a good person, a
“Where is my dog?” Violet demanded again.
“And relive your worst memories,” Violet folded her lips together, her eyes suddenly watering.
“Aw, Dr. Watson,” young Honoré sounded amused at John’s complaint. “This is going to be an amazing entry for your blog. Where is your sense of adventure?”
She had lifted her head as high as the narrow space allowed her, but now Sally let her head flop back.
The Lestrades, mercifully, had been absent from the press, other than Lestrade giving a generic statement congratulating all the officers for their hard work and thanking Sherlock for his assistance. He did, however, give public kudos to Sergeant Alexis MacDonald for her perseverance and dedication on this case. Somehow the Met had managed to keep both home invasions quiet, as well as Dr. Lestrade shooting her attacker with her husband’s gun.
It was unnaturally quiet in the flat while Sherlock was in the kitchen. Slightly concerned when she didn’t hear any bangs or booms or crashes, Violet had been about to call out and ask if everything was alright. But Sherlock re-entered the lounge before Violet said anything, bearing a tray, with a single plate and two mugs. He set the tray down on the coffee table with a thud then thrust the plate of food at her. Then he told Gladstone in exquisite German to get off the sofa.  The dog gave Sherlock a woebegone look and uttered a small, almost puppy-ish whine. But the Alsatian slunk off the sofa, then trotted over to Sherlock’s chair and curled up in it.
“To be continued,” Sherlock said to John as he lithely sprang to his feet to answer the door.
“Me?” John was taken aback, “Me too?”
t a machine. He had feelings, he had liked Mary. Befriended her, helped her plan their wedding. Still even tried to save her from Magnussen after she had shot him…
But as the truth sank in, Violet also thought about the photograph Sherlock had managed to save. The Holmes Boys…
“Alright. Any nibbles with tea?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Gagnon bridled at the very obvious insult, but in painstaking slow English, he looked at John and said: “Dr. Watson, my deepest apologies for any mistreatment you may have suffered at the hands of my men. It was all a misunderstanding. You will be… compensated for your trouble.”

,” she turned on her heel, hurrying away from the bikes and the clubhouse.
“Recall that I stated that I have an actual opportunity for you to earn money instead of borrowing,” Sherlock lifted his pointer finger up then at John. “Also you have concerns about continuing your façade of the Loving Husband around Mary.” Sherlock gave John a crafty smile. “How would you like to be out of the country for two, three months?”
“So… not ginger?”
“Oh my,” an unctuous voice drawled about them all. “Am I interrupting something?”
4 April 2016
“If I believed in something as illogical as an afterlife, I would think you had been possessed by the spirit of Anderson,” Sherlock mumbled as he stared at the screen, toe tapping in impatience as he waited for Violet’s text message to appear.
“Actually, that would explain so much if he really was born to different parents.”
“She’s no longer a person of interest regarding how the Pentagon was hacked in 2008 or any involvement she may have had with the True IRA or the
Neither man had let Violet be by herself. Nor did they allow Violet and Mary to be alone together either.
Gladstone recognized the change in her tone at once. His ears twitched up. He knew he was On the Job now. The friendly, lovable dog was gone . He pressed his body close to Violet’s, ready to go to work.
“Like fish-and-chips? He actually bought dinner for once?” Molly asked.
Hm, well…
Breaking into Rucastle’s tonight.
In the beginning, John took Sherlock at his word. At the time, John still thought Sherlock was some sort of madman or at the very least, somewhere on the autism spectrum. As time went on and as Sherlock taught John to become more observant, John realized that many of these kids were runaways, escaping abusive situations. Some of those situations were in the very foster homes they had been sent to after being removed from abusive parents. So calling social services sometimes was not in the kid’s best interest. John would patch the kid up, Mrs. Hudson would feed him up and Sherlock would find a safe place for the kid to stay. Sometimes the runaways would end up in a bedsit with other members of the Homeless Network. Sometimes the runaways would end up in hospital or rehab.
And he was going to do it again. And again. And again.
She had just shut the oven door and set the timer when John entered the kitchen.
“Good God,” Mycroft leapt to his feet, his heart beating a frantic tattoo again. “I’m on my way.”
“Do you really think Mycroft would entrust the world’s secrets to one single locked drawer?” Violet asked, regretting her decision to help Mary immensely.
“When did I see your hair products? God, John, how could I not? They were
“Ah, yes, the Moriarty operative working within the CIA could no longer funnel money from the military in order to properly protect the Onion Field project, well spotted. But I assure you, it was still well protected.  Just, not by military men,” Sherlock purred.
Gladstone (the loyal and beloved yet extremely lethal Alsatian) meanwhile had trotted past Violet and made a sharp turn into the bathroom, his black nose twitching. Soon there was the sound of splashing and barking.
Sherlock eyed her as she bent down, fumbling to pick up the card. Just as he decided it would speed things along if he assisted, she snatched it up. “You are still such a pain in the ass,” she grumbled, pushing a curl that had escaped the beanie out of her eyes. Immediately after touching her head, she sucked in a pained breath, “Ow.”
“I know where you live, I can always come back,” the cabbie sounded a bit more menacing now.
He’ll be gone until Aug 31st.
It did not go unnoticed by either Sherlock or John that the villainess’ name had been
“Because she was the only one I could trust to set up the perimeter around Baker Street when you told me too, when you rang me after Moriarty left your house after holding you and Mary prisoner. We’re sending someone to fetch her and Susan now. But John, listen, listen,” he reached out and gave John another little shake. “You have to bring Sherlock to the Met. We need your statements now, while everything’s…” Lestrade shook his head and started over. “Look mate, Sherlock, he’s… he’s going to be a fucking mess and we don’t need this night getting worse with him running off to try and find a dealer.”
“S’alright,” Lestrade mumbled, stroking her hair.
“Oh, no, don’t be silly. It will only take a few minutes. Go ring Violet. I’ll meet you outside.”
But it wasn’t going to be just John-and-Mary for very long.
Sherlock took a breath
” she cried out again as she futilely jerked on her handcuffed hands.
Mary’s heart bled a little for the poor mite, so abused he couldn’t even recognize kindness anymore. But she didn’t have time to save him or the other dogs in their cramped plastic crates. She did however take note of the extra-large crate as she picked up the razor and gun again. Remembered that John had been attacked by a bull mastiff and that particular crate looked large enough to house a pony.
Instead of looking pleased, Lettie’s eyes dimmed. But she quickly smiled. “Yes, of course, that would be splendid.” Her face softened and she tilted her head, lost in thought. Violet recognized the expression; it was the same one Sherlock wore when he was in his Mind Palace. “Oh, but Henry is the spitting image of William,” she finally crooned. “I know everyone else sees the red hair and dark eyes and thinks he looks like his mum, but he’s William all over again. It’d be nice, being Granny Holmes. Be lovely, really. But… we’ll cross that bridge when we reach it, won’t we?” she started to get up. Violet leapt to her feet and helped her stand. “I need to get these old bones to bed. Lovely chatting with you dear. Apologies for catching you unawares tonight and when I visited you in London, but I had to see what kind of a woman you were. That reminds me, are Dr. Watson and Mrs. Watson still together? They were separated last Christmas.”
Violet waited until he left then hobbled towards the bathroom.
Then he looked beyond the pool and back garden. He studied the dilapidated boathouse.
All freckles, all scars were neatly hidden away.
, John had to remind himself sometimes.
Before Bodley finished his sentence, Molly’s hand suddenly gained a life of itself own. Before she was even fully aware of what she was doing, she had slapped Bodley soundly on his cheek.
“I’ll ring the executor of the estate,” Georgina brightened. She didn’t care she was getting robbed of her cut. She just wanted this lousy piece of property off her desk. Nobody wanted to buy a place where someone had their brains blown out.
“Bomb, what bomb?”
Truth or Dare she thought.
enough, apparently.
“Dupin’s right,” John swallowed hard. “I do take you for granted.”
His gun felt hot and heavy against his body. Once inside Dupin’s car, John unzipped his parka and unsnapped the holster, taking it out. He clicked the safety off and put it back into his holster.
“He’s right, as usual,” John scowled at Clara. “If you keep enabling her, she won’t stop the booze or the gambling.” He ran his fingers through his silvery-blond hair, making it stick up like hedgehog quills. “Harry, you lost Mum’s house because you lost your shirt at the racetracks. Everything Mum did to keep that house for us whenever Dad pissed everything away on the ponies, you just… I can’t…I don’t understand,” he shook his head. “
Fibromyalgia, myasthenia gravis, lupus, Huntington’s disease and multiple sclerosis were all contenders. He had ruled out Huntington’s immediately since her mental abilities remained as sharp as ever. He contemplated eliminating myasthenia gravis from the equation as well since she did not have the trademark “blank expression” nor muscle weakness in her neck, causing a bobbing head.
Belatedly, John realized he should have worn a tie and a proper suit jacket.
“The girl? Susan? Saddling me with her while John is off doing your bidding for two months.”
“Call Lestrade, wake him, I don’t care,” Sherlock ordered John as he unlocked the door to Sally’s bedsit. “Tell him he needs to start monitoring funerals, starting with any services happening tomorrow. Also, we may need a team to exhume any fresh graves.”
“Time for what?” she couldn’t keep the edge out of her voice.
“Yes, you are correct.  Although I imagine Marie would have liked her. She knew I did not live as a monk before I met her. Before Marie, I was a bit of a… mmm… the English word escapes me.
“Sherlock,” John called from one of Rucastle’s drafting tables. “I think I found something.”
He decided to trust Sherlock and all would sort itself out in the end.
, John shook his head, smiling a little.
In a vain attempt to frighten the young Heathcliff, Sherlock had slipped into the guestroom the teenage monster had passed out in after a night of too much drink. Six days shy of his eighth birthday, Sherlock had set the bed on fire. But the flames had spread faster than the boy anticipated. Sherlock had fled in terror as his tormentor shrieked in agony.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dupin saw John positively squirming in his seat. “There are worse things in the world to be than gay, John.”
“Parliament… how did you…” John blinked, remembering who Sherlock said those exact words to hours ago. “
“Always,” John whispered back.
. I can see why his teacher insisted on summer school.” She pulled the cheque out of her pocket. “And you have got to talk to your damn brother about unfreezing my bank accounts. Here’s another check I can’t deposit or cash.”
, huh? No more ickle Johnny?”
Once Victor shut the door behind him, Sherlock played a bit longer until he was sure Victor was good and gone. Then he opened his eyes, frowning at the door leading up to John’s old rooms.
“Take Sweetie out for a wee before you go anywhere,” Mary called as she left the bedroom. Then John chuckled when he heard her exclaim, “Oh damn,” when she saw the trail of their clothing littering the house.
Sherlock ignored them, as usual. “I assume the culprit used a blowtorch. Crisped the bodies, like the top of a Crème Brulee.”
“I knew you watched the

“Then let’s get to work and find Evie before it’s too late,” John made himself comfortable in the chair across from Missy’s desk.
“You don’t love her,” he repeated, sounding more desperate than cold.
Dupin.” Her voice had cracked, the pain medication finally wearing off by then.
“Is he colicky? Or…?”
“You’re pregnant,” Violet reminded her. Even though she really did not fancy having Mary behind her with a loaded gun, she also knew John would never forgive her if she allowed harm to come to his unborn baby. “You cover me.”
Violet smiled and texted “OK” back at him and waited for the address. When the address of his bolt-hole came, there was a postscript:
Sherlock snatched the pass out of Dupin’s hand and kept running. John paused to stutter out a “Ta,” but Dupin shook his head. “No time, go,” and gave John a bit of a shove to get him moving again. Soon he was running ahead John again. Not that John was in terrible shape at all, but it irked him a great deal that he was being outpaced by two smokers.
St. Thomas’ Hospital
So Violet’s aversion to sleeping in John’s room was not illogical, as Sherlock insisted it was. To her, it was obvious. This room did not belong to her.
Maisie had been perfectly
Molly had discovered Snapchat and sent him random pictures she thought would amuse him, mostly at Greg’s expense. But also as an excuse to show off Henry, whose head still seemed bigger than his body, poor kid.
“Charming,” John’s cheeks reddened, “Can’t wait to get the next round then.”
Violet uncrossed her arms and waggled her fingers at Mycroft.
“Oh, but that wouldn’t do at all,” Mycroft said. “Why would I give you a key to escape your gaol?”
He wished his German was better…
She turned to flounce off, planning to run the minute she could, when Rucastle called out, “If you run, the girl dies.”
“Grandpa was replacing the shingles on the roof. Stubborn old man, he shouldn’t have been up there anyway. He lost his balance and fell head-over-heels to the ground. My dad was granted compassionate leave and we all spent the summer on the farm while Grandpa recovered.”
“Hm?” John turned his head to watch the Captur drive away, trundling slowly down the cobblestone street then turning the corner.

John stood up so Sherlock could get out of his seat. Dupin waited politely for them by the café door then jerked his head, indicating they should follow him. As they left, strolling casually, John realized Sherlock had just insulted Dupin the same way John, Mary and Violet did Sherlock when he was driving them mad.

Yet another lie told to protect John. Those wounds had been fresh, barely had stopped weeping when Sherlock arrived at that French restaurant nearly two years ago, to announce he was Not Dead.

“The house…” John’s voice petered out. Then he shook his head in sudden realization. “You mean, our old house, Mum’s house? Did you lose Mum’s house, Harry?” When his sister turned brick-red, John shouted “Did you lose our house?”
Violet gave Mary a quick summary of what had happened while Mary had been stalking and kidnapping Anthea. Mary’s eyes widened and she made a mental note to call the young lady, Josie Tey, and try once again to convince her to go to Sherlock about the woman who tried to abduct her. However, Mary was also hit with a bolt of inspiration: “If Rucastle goes on holiday tomorrow, John and Sherlock can go investigate that House of Horrors while you and I go to the estate. I know where it is. John and I had to fetch Sherlock from there one night, long story, but please, Violet. Please, we are so close to finding her,” Mary begged, no longer the cold assassin. “The boys can hold their own. They did in the past, before they met us, at any rate.”
,” He laced the last two words with as much poison as he could as he cupped his massive hand underneath Violet’s elbow. Completely wired, she jumped at his touch. But she never broke her angry stare-down with Mycroft.
Now John looked perplexed, “Why would he do that?”
Sherlock wrenched his eyes away from John, unable to look at his best friend in the face anymore. “You tell him,” he pleaded in German. “This sort of thing really isn’t my area of expertise.”
The cab had started slowing down. Both Sherlock and Violet looked up at the hotel.

She knew he didn’t like her either. Sherlock had been right (as usual). Victor expected Sherlock to be alone, unattached.
Sherlock shook John off, but actually obeyed. Dupin charged through and stood in front of the door where the shouting and the shot had come from. John positioned himself so he could point the gun into the room the minute the door was opened. “Do it,” he told Dupin.
John thought they would return to Dupin’s hovel and he had to repress a shudder. To his surprise, Sherlock instead commandeered young Jack Honoré’s flat in the Latin Quarter, near the Seine.
Violet winked at John as he stormed past her. But he politely waited for her at the top of the stairs. She pushed the door open with her toe and called out, “Sherlock? Earth to Sherlock? John’s back from his trip.”

The drink was just as foul as Sherlock promised. And results were immediate. Soon Violet was hunched over the toilet again. Only this time, Sherlock helped hold her up and he held her ponytail back.
He didn’t like all the flowers though. He didn’t have allergies, but every single sense he possessed was hypersensitive. Through the years he learned to hone his powerful vision and filter out unnecessary noise (which usually consisted of people talking). Since he presented himself as aloof and cold, people didn’t go out of their way to touch him…

John said his good-byes (to Sherlock and Violet while ignoring Mycroft) then made his way out of 221B Baker Street and started walking towards the nearest Tube stop. The wind had picked up, the temperature had dropped and rain threatened. But John, mindful of his budget, decided it was best not take two taxis in one day.
“Oh good, I’m so pleased you’re bringing her home. I like her. More nibbles, poppet?”
Upon reaching Sherlock’s navel, John sat up again. Sherlock could feel John staring at him as he hooked the waistband of his boxers with his thumbs. Sherlock lifted his bony hips, deducing what John wanted to attempt.

It stayed silent on Violet’s end longer than John cared for. “I wouldn’t rule it out,” she finally, unwillingly said. “I mean, he was drinking tonight. He hardly ever touches alcohol. Also, well, you see, Victor said something very strange to me, when he and I were talking before he left Baker Street on Sunday.”
She avoided the Red Line. She opted to take the Green Line to downtown instead.
“Mycroft is not interested in us. He thinks we’re Sherlock’s puppets. He’s interested in Violet. We’ve done all we can now. It’s up to Noelie to led Mycroft on,” Dupin tried to sound nonchalant but his brow was creased with worry.
9:33 PM Central Standard Time
“What?” Josie nearly spit her drink right back out. “After what happened to me? Are you mad?”
Violet covered her faced, “But it’s so dangerous! Moriarty nearly killed him last time.”
“He rented a car from Enterprise,” Lisbeth explained as Dupin, now dressed in jeans and a black jumper (but still barefooted), took his clothes from the tiny wardrobe and deposited them into the suitcase on the bed. “I’m trying to get into the website, but I never thought a fucking car rental would have so many firewalls… ah-ha. Finally,” she sighed as her fingers flew over her keyboard. “Right, so he rented a Toyota RAV4.” Then she snorted in glee. “Idiot. He added on GPS. I can track that.”
“What about the double-hit?” Violet whispered as he sat down on the coffee table, facing her.
Mary’s training as a nurse kicked in. She eyed the thin woman, noticing not the robe or slippers but the thick knee-socks. “You’re diabetic.”
“Not,” Sherlock overemphasized the “T” and held up his pointer finger, “If he needs the reports for blackmail purposes, my dear Mary.”
Violet, immediately picking up on the chill, shot a look at Sherlock as he hovered in doorway.
He smelt gunpowder. He smelt blood.
Prior to the event now officially and simply known as “The Fall”, Violet had returned to London and started freelancing for the True IRA. She had needed money and information. She needed information on the
221B Baker Street
Violet had lived in England long enough to know that whenever anyone talked about ‘The War’, most people were referring to World War II.
Dupin continued to shout when he saw what had to be a parking ticket slipped underneath the windscreen wiper. “
that actually prepared me for the real world. Do you know how stupid I felt when Victor had to teach me how to balance a cheque book ledger?”
He needed a pretty little thief.
Chibs folded his lips tight together, his throat working. “Right,” he finally croaked. “We don’t make any moves until we talk to her. We have eyes on her?”
Wiggins really did look better than when she’d last seen  him. He had gained a few much needed pounds. His hair was now cut and styled more flatteringly to his long lean face and he was also clean-shaven. His clothes were also clean, a bit rumpled to be sure, but at least they didn’t reek of methamphetamines fumes and urine.
Friday afternoon
Unlike his mother, he hadn’t been bothered by his unflattering sobriquet.
“Yes, but without me not only would your life be unspeakably dull but you wouldn’t be able to get things off the top shelves.”
“Possibly,” Sherlock muttered. “I was high, obviously. Who knows what I was thinking.”
“Did you notice any bruises or strange marks, scratches, cuts?”
Her hair was now neatly plaited in some complicated braid and she had put her “Miss Smith face” on, foundation, powder and a light lip color. She also wore her fake eyeglasses and a light cardigan, despite the sweltering July heat.
“Exactly so, they no longer have any influence in American events. At the very least, Professor Moriarty would have initiated the ultimate punishment, the Sign of Four.”
, Violet thought darkly as she exited Mary’s battered car.
Sherlock took stock of John’s current condition:
“Ahhh…” Dupin took a step closer, looking at the squiggles that weren’t really squiggles. “
Dupin lazily turned around in the front passenger seat to face Sherlock. “Do you honestly believe that? Or is that just a comforting lie you tell yourself when life’s disappointments drive you deeper and deeper towards introversion? No, that’s not the correct English word…” Dupin took off his sunglasses now. His eyes were green, like summer grass. “Isolation,” he finally said. “One cannot live on brain-work alone.”
So it had been quite late when John and Mary got home. They had tromped up the stairs, kicked off their shoes, changed into their pyjamas and collapsed into bed.
“That is an understatement,” Sherlock tented his fingers together again, furious with himself for losing control. The last time he acted so foolishly was with Molly…
“Mr. Holmes,” Mitton took another step forward and locked his eyes with Sherlock’s. “I have been assigned to be her MI-6 handler until the trial in America is over. You have my word no harm will come to her, I swear it on my own life.”
John felt nearly like himself again, but he could feel Sherlock’s eyes on him, taking inventory, cataloging everything he observed. In a vain attempt to distract the Great Detective as well as to keep him from commenting on his cut lip, he turned to Anthea and said: “Thank you again so much for bailing us out. I really mean it.”
There was a loud click then a louder buzz then the door swung open.
But he definitely liked Agent Hunter.
really doesn’t like to share information, does he?” the Professor pushed his glasses up his nose again. “Here is my modest proposal: a tax-free, lifetime annual income of fifty thousand pounds each if you both work for me. That’s a hundred thousand quid a year until you die, not bad and far more than what you’re both earning.”
“What ‘side project’?” John demanded but when Mycroft only sipped his tea, he said, in irritation, “Well, I have a message for you too. Stop being a dick and unfreeze Violet’s bank accounts. She’s not going anywhere. She can’t, thanks to you.”
“Wanna skive off and play video games?” she had whispered, like the impish teenager she was instead of the scared, sick homeless girl she had been. “Dr. Watson has games on his laptop.”
“Actually, it’s quite brilliant, although Violet hit the nail on the head last night when she told me how she had informed Mycroft that this idea of his is “medieval’. Arranged marriages have been used in royal families to cement political power and to control potential opponents for centuries. And not just in British history. Julius Caesar married his seventeen-year-old daughter to his greatest rival, Pompey the Great. After the nuptials, Pompey and Caesar immediately became the very best of friends… until the girl died in childbirth. Then Pompey immediately became Caesar’s enemy again once he was free of his child-bride.”
Now, alone (for the most part), Violet again found herself tempted to snoop around the house. Unfortunately if something happened to Edward while she was poking around, she would definitely be up shit creek without a paddle.
“Jim. He was still running the show at that time. Richard was busy filming
“What
“The Earl,” Sherlock confirmed, his face paling a trifle.
Sherlock ignored her flippancy once again.  He was busy flipping through a gigantic leather-bound book. It took a moment for Violet to realize what it was. “Is that a Bible?” she asked.
“He did?” Rucastle tried to hide the shock and failed utterly, “When? Whatever for?”
11:57 PM
“Then we hide in here,” Violet said grimly, finding the brick again. “And we wait Mycroft out,” she added as the secret door swung open again. She crept into the gloom then stuck her hand out, waving Mary to hurry up.
He hated this. Hated seeing the flat turned upside-down like this. After his self-imposed isolation had ended, John had spent many nights in this very flat as Greg helped him recover from The Fall. They had sat in this very lounge and  worked together to clear Sherlock’s name posthumously. They had watched football games together and drank beer like normal men, normal mates. During the brief quiet interlude after Mary had gotten out of the hospital and before Violet had entered their lives, Greg and Molly had invited the Watsons over for supper now and again and it had been fun. One night, Sherlock had even joined them all. Molly had made a roast. They had played
“No, I understand, completely. But,” Victor looked around. “Is Sherlock here?”
“I don’t have it,” Violet lowered her head. “And it’s Agent Hunter, Mr. Holmes.” She gave him a sly smile. “Dr. Watson’s not the only one willing to punch your lights out.”
“It says
She leaned forward and kissed his cheek, a cold, formal peck. Her lips barely grazed his skin. “My deepest sympathies for your loss,” she intoned in her coldest, loftiest ‘Miss Smith’ voice. Then she locked her eyes on his again, mouth firmly screwed down.
As her would-be rapists died in pools of their own blood, Mary turned back to the dog fighting ring. She opened the gate and told the friendly pit bull, who whimpered, “Go on, you. Run.”
While the Tollers made their escape and Sherlock and John made their plans, Rucastle shoved Mary into the garage. She stumbled, but stayed upright. The sharp, almost metallic scent of blood accompanied with dog excrement assaulted her nose. Averting her eyes from the bodies of the men she had killed only a short time ago, she staggered away from Rucastle. The dogs started barking again, high, agitated yips as the gruesome, foul man smiled at her.
“I think,” Lestrade felt his face flush slightly. “I was wrong. After yesterday and well… while I was stuck at that black-ops hellhole while Sherlock and Violet were doing God knows what for MI-6, I had plenty of time for a nice long think. And what I think…no. I
Sherlock seized Violet underneath her left armpit and hauled her away from Mitton before he could inadvertently kick her.
“So I am. I never said anything because…” Sherlock squirmed then bolted forward to put the tea on the coffee-table. He folded his knees up to his chest and wrapped his long arms around his legs. His long toes coiled over the edge of the ratty old sofa. “I never said anything because I wanted to respect your decision to stay in the closet-”
. The Work is what is necessary and vital and is what keeps me beautiful and pure, despite this,” he clamped a meaty hand over his chest. “Unfortunate vehicle my soul has been placed within in order to walk the earth with mere mortals. The Tollers… the Tollers are barking mad. They’re the kidnapper and the killer. Mrs. Toller took care of my first wife, oh, how she took care of my first wife.” His face darkened. Unexpectedly, his eyes teared up as he whispered, “My Ellie. My lovely Ellie, my perfect bride, my goddess. Oh, I know the rumors, that I murdered my first wife so her cousin could inherit the entire family fortune. But no, Mrs. Watson, I did not murder my first wife,” his smile was positively monstrous. “But Mrs. Toller helped the murderer accomplish the task. Shall I tell you, my darkest secret? The one I swore I’d take to my grave? The identity of the person who really killed Lady Elise Cullen-Culpepper?”
He hated how unsure he sounded, but he had been let down before. After all, the two men he had sincerely loved before her had thrown him over for others.
, John thought as he peeled the shirt open. The silkiness of the expensive fabric was nothing compared to the marbled smoothness of his skin.
“Oh, I’m so sorry, should I pretty up the truth with a comfortable euphemism?” Violet found Mycroft’s pressure point and
“We’ve got to go. Now,” John felt dread swelling in his belly. “We’ve got to catch the next shuttle to the South Terminal.”
“It’s fine, really,” Sherlock turned to start walking again. “No worries, Victor.”
There was no Sherlock to save the day with a brilliant deduction. No John with guns blazing. No Mary as a dubious ally. No Mycroft to produce a
“It gets less impressive as time goes on,” John muttered but he clicked the safety back on his gun and went to help Sherlock and Dupin.
She changed into a comfortable white jumper and a pair of black, cotton-knit leggings. She put on a pair of woolly black and white striped socks over the leggings and applied a little bit of make-up, just in case Mrs. Hudson decided to pop in. She didn’t put on her full face, but she put on the thick concealer she used to hide the scar on her cheek and the lavender smudges under her eyes. Then she dusted her face with powder and studied herself in the mirror.
“Really?” When Violet nodded, John shook his head in confusion, “That can’t be, I’d have far more, uh,
Violet ruthlessly cut that thought off when she saw the glowing sign for The Plaza Coffee & Muffins.
he thought as he cleared his throat. “I know you will want to discuss Victor Trevor’s return to London, but can we please conclude the business regarding Violet beforehand as I have a feeling our discussion about Victor might deteriorate into a row?”
Mycroft never did anything for
“Sherlock?” she shook her head, making her ponytail swish back and forth. “Do you think Greg and I are going to love him less because he might be a bit different?”
Mary Morstan Watson, naturally.
“Ohhh…” Violet felt her face heat up. Then remembered Victor had said he had a wife and child… “Oh,” she said again, realizing Victor was his first
“It’s not your brother.”
As she chewed on the hangnail, Violet felt immense gratitude she didn’t have to be anywhere tonight. Sherlock and Violet had been invited to no fewer than three New Year’s Eve parties. Henry Knight, one of Sherlock’s former clients, was in London for the weekend and asked them to join him and loads of his friends at a giant spread he was throwing at a posh hotel. “I want everyone to meet the man who saved my sanity,” Henry explained to Sherlock unabashedly.
Sherlock pursed his lips.
“Thank you,” Sherlock stood up “Now if you will excuse me, but I have loads of work to do. Good-day, Mycroft.”
“No,” Lettie surprised Siger with her answer, “Of course not. Mummy and Daddy will handle it without the police. No one is ever going to hurt you again, poppet. OK?”
Munching on the apple again, John garbled as he kept his eyes trained on the iPad, “Do you think Sara G. would know where the Letter is now?”
Sherlock still stayed quiet.
William shook his head. “I tried. But I frew up.”
“In a moment,” Sherlock barked. But the spell had indeed been broken. Sherlock got off the bed, buttoning his shirt as he did so. John pulled the sheets and duvet primly over him and smoothed his own hair down. He drew his knees up as well, the dull ache between his legs informing him he probably had more than just a decent erection by now. Tactfully, he suppressed a snigger as he caught Sherlock adjusting himself as well; his ivory cheeks flushed a light pink. Only after Sherlock tucked his shirttails in then he reached up for his scarf, pulling it off the camera. John noted, not without a bit of glee and smugness, that instead of putting the scarf on properly, he held strategically in front of his trousers.
“With all due respect, Mr. Home,
Violet had given the old bitch a foul look. “What a dreadful thing to say,” Violet Smith snapped before a cold, cruel smile curled up on her lips. “Mr. Rucastle will hear about it,” she had purred before excusing herself to leave the table.
But Mycroft shook his head. “Not until I can figure out how to un-do the double-hit Mrs. Watson has in place. Did Hunter indicate in any way she knows about Mary shooting Sherlock?”
That did not mean information popped up quickly or easily. When she realized they only had two hours before they were going to land in DC, she had actually begun to sweat. With only forty-five minutes to landing, she managed to find a way to get past Dulles’s firewalls and various other security measures. Then, she scheduled a Routine System Outage that would affect the lights, PA system and security systems at the approximate time they would be delivered to the fake FBI agents.
“Like 221B is a fucking palace?” Violet had snapped back at him. Warm and comfortable, she had lightly dozed during the flight and had started to feel like herself again.
my Montmartre Militia,” he translated for John. “And it is a fortunate thing I asked for those coffees to go. Time for a walk, gentlemen.”
“No need to get ratty,” John snapped. “Oh and here’s another deduction. How long have you had that cough?”
Violet knelt next to Sherlock. Remembering that kneeling was one of his triggers, she slipped her hand into his. She felt the slight tremor, realizing that he was struggling with his own demons. “Sit, you’ll kill your knees,” she whispered to Sherlock before turning her face up to Mitton. “Mitton, look at me.”
surprisingly, had pitched a massive fit when John told her he was going to New Scotland Yard that morning. Her unhappy and disapproving outburst had been a borderline  temper tantrum, which was completely out of character for her. Shocked by her white-hot anger, John futilely explained he was receiving multiple texts all at once, starting with Lestrade, then Sherlock, then Lestrade’s colleague DI Montgomery, the DI who helped give Sherlock a leg-up on the case, then Alex naturally, and last but not least, MacPherson the hipster forensics tech who took Phillip Anderson’s place after he died.
“She can be spot-on about some things. You should listen to her. She is quite practical.”
“Oh zip it,” Violet rolled her eyes but took his arm.
Heathcliff gave Mycroft a pitying look. “But I like William. He has the sweetest arse I’ve ev-”
“Jack,” Dupin finally spoke out loud, although when he said the boy’s first name, he used the French pronunciation of
The MI-6 agents ignored Sherlock’s snarls. “Come along, Mr. Holmes,” one of them even dared to command him. The look Sherlock gave him would have curdled the souls of kings and Gods but the agent endured it stoically. “Let the professionals handle this,” he said, hooking his hand under Sherlock’s arm, forcing him to stand. Another agent gently but firmly grasped Violet by her thin shoulders and lifted her to her feet. As soon as Sherlock and Violet were out of their way, the paramedics swiftly took their place.
“Mr. Holmes, we are cutting it close,” Honoré argued as he did as he was told, pulling the car over to the kerb as the other cars and lorries zipped past, honking their horns as they did so. “We need to be at

And tried  not to think about Harry.
“Probably not, but I haven’t ruled out the possibility.”
Dupin has a bolt-hole set up for you,” Honoré explained. “I’m taking you there now.”
“No, wait,” Sherlock looked at his wristwatch. “The military and MI-6 wasn’t that far behind us. Snipers will be in place in ten minutes while the military assembles a perimeter.”
Tentatively, she asked “Fall-related or Hiatus-related injury?”
Sherlock grinned. It was great fun winding her up, like this. As he carefully made his way from the darkened lounge towards his bedroom, he idly wondered if he could in fact procure a monkey. Not permanently, of course. He knew he didn’t have the have the time nor patience to properly care for a simian full-time. But it would be a highly entertaining experiment to gauge her reaction if she came home and saw a spider-monkey dangling from the light fixture.
Violet muttered something under her breath that sounded suspiciously like “Jackass,” and sat down next to him with a cup of coffee and her omelet. “I checked emails this morning,” she said, meaning messages received through John’s blog, in other words, private case requests.
Lisbeth gave her a blank stare. Then a flush pinked her cheeks as she produced a genuine smile of pure pleasure instead of one her sardonic half-smirks.
