Steve jumped at a loud bang and looked up to see Tony leaning on the table, his hands splayed between them.
Steve panted against the sheets, and for a second Tony thought he hadn't heard him at all, but then Steve slowly unfolded his body, rolling over onto his back so slowly that it looked like it took monumental effort. Steve was already sweating, his face and bare chest painted a splotchy red, and Tony attached one end of the first cuff to the reinforced bedpost by Steve's left arm before he clasped the open end around Steve's wrist.
Tony smiled as he stepped around Steve onto Steve's floor, never breaking eye contact. “Can't say no to that. I live and breathe coffee.”
Obie nodded, straightening up as he wrapped an arm around Tony's shoulders and shook Steve's hand with the other. “Thank you, doc. We appreciate your efforts.”
“The sex doll people!” Steve should probably keep his voice down, but he was too wound up to care. “You gave them my address and now they told me to give them an interview!”
“Do you –“ He couldn’t even finish his sentence before Tony came suddenly, humping his fist as he unloaded all over the mattress, leaving multiple wet spots on the fabric. Steve licked his lips, slipping the fleshlight off his cock so he could wrap his arms around Tony's waist and drop a line of kisses up his spine. They were both still breathing heavily when Tony turned onto his back and Steve dropped down next to him, staring blankly at the ceiling.
“Fuck,” was all Tony managed to say before his jaw clenched, his stomach tightening as all of his muscles tensed in anticipation. “Steve –“
“That's why I wanted to ask you, if... I mean, if you –“ He cleared his throat. “Do you think you would... consider it? If the option were available? To do that again?”
“I do.” Tony blinked in surprise, looking up at Steve who was steadfastly staring at the wall. “I feel... I don't know. Restless. Like something's simmering inside me.” He let out a shaky breath. “It's not anywhere close to actually – you know, yet, but – it's there.”
Tony stormed past Steve into the living room, not daring to meet his eye as he grabbed his jacket off the back of the couch and –
Steve felt Tony's hands feather-light against his neck and opened his eyes to Tony's gentle smile before Tony leaned down and pressed their mouths together.
“It's too loud in my head,” Tony finally admitted, his throat scraped raw by the words. He hated feeling weak, but before he could start to regret saying it Steve was there, grounding him with a firm hand on the back of his neck.
Steve stepped over to the table behind Tony, putting his hand on the flat, wooden surface. “You'll be lying down right here, face-down on the table. I have pillows to make it more comfortable if you need them.” He tapped the sphere sticking out through the wood – some kind of metal, judging by the sound it made. “This is the massager. With the way you'll be positioned, your pelvis will rest right on top of it to get the maximum effect of the massage.”
Steve shifted in his seat, his cheeks getting a little red as Tony stared at him. “Just wondering. There's gotta be a reason why you do it, right?”
“You've never kissed anyone?” Toni asked, keeping any and all judgment out of her voice, and Steve gave her a self-deprecating smile.
If only she'd met Steve ten years ago. Hell, five years would've been acceptable too, then she could've fucked him and moved on with her life without feeling like she was betraying her own moral code. It still would've been terrible press, but... fuck, she didn't even know why the number fifty was such a huge barrier in her mind.
“Yes, boss.” Tony grabbed the pie tray with pointed fingers, looking at it consideringly. “You know, I wonder –“
with you, Tony,” Steve shouted, suddenly angry. He'd kept this secret for all these years, tortured himself with what ifs and unsaid possibilities, and now that he'd finally found the courage to say it Tony was going to goddamn hear the whole truth. “Spell or no spell I've always had feelings for you. And I know you've never thought of me that way and god knows I've destroyed any chance at ever asking you –“
Steve closed his book with a sigh, propping himself up on the couch as he turned to face him. Tony put down his phone, catching the weird vibes Steve was giving off, almost like he was anxious about something. Which was weird, considering they were just spending a quiet afternoon together.
That seemed to shut Tony up. Steve made quick work of their clothes, which wasn’t hard considering Tony was still in his morning robe and Steve slept essentially naked, before he sat them both on the bed, eying the tube in his hand.
Tony was up off the couch in a flash, dragging Steve along by the sleeve. “I'll show you old, you fucking dick.”
Steve hit the opposite wall with a loud thud, groaning as he crumpled to the floor, blinking dark spots out of his eyes. It took him a second to get his bearings before he stood up, stumbling back over to where the plant was still holding Tony hostage. "Damn it! Put him down!"
"Now." Steve pinched him in the side, and Tony groaned through a breathless laugh as Steve bit the skin just above his hip, worrying it with his teeth. "Okay fine. Please."
, drinking him in like Steve was starving for him, and Tony could feel his stomach clench with lust in response. He was already wet – he'd have to be a robot not to be affected by the sight of Steve lost in pleasure – so he swung a leg over Steve's hips and positioned himself until Steve's cock was pointed straight up between his thighs.
"No. Just – listen to me." Tony stepped forward and took the duffle bag from him, throwing it on the bed. "I know running away feels like the easiest solution but it's not. 114 countries have signed these accords now, Bucky. And if you run they'll make us hunt you down, wherever you are. You'll never be able to stop looking over your shoulder and if worst comes to worst it'll be one of us pointing the barrel at you. I won't let you live like that. I can't."
Steve blinked. Tony kept staring at him while Steve processed all of that, but before Steve could say anything Tony nodded, his face still carefully blank.
her to do that,” Tony said quickly, wrinkling his nose. “No. She's just there for the legal stuff. You know, NDA on locations and names, 'anything you say can and will be used against you', blah blah blah.”
Steve was following Tony's every move with hooded eyes, inhaling sharply when Tony's hands got anywhere near his cock. As soon as the boxers came off he groaned, his cock bobbing in the air as he thrust up into nothing. It was flushed almost completely red, thick and hard with veins pulsing along its underside. Tony could feel his mouth water.
He could hear virtual coins tinkling as they dropped into his donation jar, and winked at Pepper who was sitting in a dark corner behind the camera with her laptop, keeping track of the number of tickets as she wrote them down on tiny slips of paper. There was already another considerable pile in the basket next to her.
Tony swore his brain short-circuited for a moment as he imagined it - Steve's lips around him, framed by soft hair that would, fuck, it would
“I'm not going to shackle you to the bed before I absolutely need to,” Tony said firmly. “You're not a goddamn animal. Stop trying to make me do this.”
Tony pouted just long enough to get an exasperated eye roll from Steve before he smirked and ushered him across the room. "Just wait. I'll knock your socks off."
“So that's settled,” Obie said, reaching out to shake the doctor's hand. “I'm counting on you, doc.”
Find attached a compiled briefing on your first team mission in Great Britain. The UN has located a terrorist cell in London and we've received a request for at least two Avengers to support the local forces in carrying out its termination. Please decide on which Avengers will carry out this mission by tomorrow 8pm EST.
But then they moved, sliding over smooth skin down to the spotted line where skin met fur. Steve's breath caught in his throat when he touched it, surprisingly soft against his fingers as he tentatively petted Tony's hip, exploring the texture.
Tony swallowed heavily, rubbing stray hairs off his scissors. "I'm not the one who found him, Buck."
“Because –“ Toni swallowed hard, looking off to the side. “Look, I'm filthy rich, right? That's enough of a power dynamic as it is, no matter who I go out with. If you add an age difference into the mix –“
“Still okay?” Tony asked and Steve nodded frantically, grabbing Tony's shoulders to pull him forward further.
“Tony, what –“ Steve broke off as soon as he saw Tony’s face, a worried frown creasing his brow. “What’s wrong?”
Pepper rolled her eyes. “Whatever you say. Just know that I would never judge you for being with a younger guy, okay? Fuck the tabloids.”
“Mr. Rogers,” she cut him off with a polite smile. “Ms. Potts is already waiting for you. Take the elevator up to the eleventh floor and make a right. The meeting room is through the last door on the left, room 1106.”
“Yeah. That – yeah.” He smiled wryly. “I couldn't. Not even when – I mean, there was my mum. And then I was living with Bucky. And in the army it's – I mean, you're lucky if you even get a moment alone, it's not –“
Tony grunted, then tilted his hips until he could press his balls to the metal along with his cock, whimpering under his breath at the sensation. It was as if his blood was churning, gathering in a pit right below his stomach to form a massive knot of heat that pulsed and pumped pleasure all the way to the tips of his toes. It felt almost the same way as a cock hitting his prostate did, but like this Tony felt so much
“Okay,” Steve said, still a little subdued, and Tony kissed him softly before he pillowed his head on Steve's chest.
"I want to show you the dog bed," he said and Steve gave a startled laugh that trailed off into a sniffle.
Steve shrugged, his face bright red, and Tony's eyes were immediately drawn to his flushed cheeks, to the blood gathering underneath there because he knew how that
Steve rubbed his eyes with a quiet groan, suddenly very tired. “I can do that without fucking a doll.”
“Damn it,” Steve sighed, leaning back on his stool when Sam shoved a plate of eggs at him – and subsequently at Bucky.
Steve chuckled, tapping a finger against the white star in the middle of his chest. “Are you terribly attached to the colors?”
For a moment they let the silence linger between them before Tony chuckled. "You know what this reminds me of?"
Steve knew Tony's scheming face when he saw it. Knowing that Tony was already thinking up ways for them to repeat this experience was stirring up something between exasperation and arousal in his chest. Which was pretty much how he felt around Tony eighty percent of the time.
“Yes,” Steve gasped before his brain had even fully caught up with the situation, and Tony pulled back, giving him a stern, almost a little concerned look.
Bucky looked at him for a long time with an unreadable look in his eyes before he nodded. "Yes. I trust you."
Steve swallowed, pulling his fingers out a lot more carefully than he'd pushed them in, stretching Tony with slow movements. He'd used to do this a lot, mostly to himself because usually people didn't look at his scrawny body and see him as anything but a catcher, but he'd always tried to do it fast and save valuable time. Maybe that was different in the future too.
it, his weight and his strength as his hips kept hitching forward against Tony's ass, pushing him even
“I can prove it!” Steve cut in, leaning down to rummage through his bag. He held up a hand when Tony started backing away, ignoring the frisson of hurt in his chest at the thought that Tony was afraid of him. “I'm just getting my sketchbook.”
“Ready?” he breathed and Tony nodded against his lips as Steve lubed up the tube and pressed it against his hole. “Deep breath.”
, a line of drool trailing down the side of his face that he tried to wipe off on his shoulder, but another vine slithered up to his face and –
"You'll see." He could practically hear the smug smile on Tony's face. "Sorry, shnookums, I gotta run. Lots of calls to make, emails to send.
By the time Clint and Bucky left Steve had completely forgotten about the package. It was only after he cleaned up and turned in for the night that he caught sight of it sitting innocently right next to his dresser, just as huge and nondescript as it had been earlier that day.
Tony froze for a second as he seemed to process that before he nodded. “Okay. Can you tell me... What do you mean, it doesn't feel right?”
For a second Tony had no idea who the hell David was supposed to be. Then he blinked and put on his most charming grin, shaking Steve's hand. “Hey, Steve, nice to meet you. You can just call me Dave. That's more familiar, isn't it?”
Tony dragged Steve's bottom lip between his teeth before he licked his way inside, grabbing the back of Steve's neck to pull him closer. Steve moaned into the kiss, and Tony jerked when he felt Steve's fingers digging through the pie until he found the right angle to hold his palm and create a tight space for both him and Tony to fuck into. Tony broke their kiss to look down at where his and Steve's cocks were sliding together, speeding up until he was rutting into the pie, his balls already aching as pressure built at the base of his cock.
.” Steve could feel his hand fumbling between them as Tony tugged open his own belt, pulling out his cock. “Fuck, come on –“
Steve groaned, his fingers digging into Tony's sides as he seemed to search for words. “Inside you,” he finally said and Tony chuckled, hissing when Steve suddenly prodded at his hole with two fingers.
“Or maybe you being a criminal is kind of sexy in a weird way.” Steve snorted, but Tony leaned in to whisper in his ear. “I may have jerked off thinking about you fucking me in an abandoned shed somewhere. Meeting under the cover of night. We'd have to be quiet so we don't attract any attention.”
“That’s handy,” Steve said, swallowing hard when Tony sat back on the bed and spread his legs. “Do you want me to… um.”
, I thought about fucking you too,” Steve chuckled, looking equally aroused and abashed as he stroked his hands over Tony's thighs. “Your legs wrapped around me... your weight in my arms...”
“You, uh.” Steve cleared his throat, glancing up at him. “You said you liked the pie better, didn't you?”
Tony kept babbling under his breath, encouragements interspersed with sounds of pure pleasure, and each and every one of them hit Steve like a punch in the gut, fanning the heat under his skin. He'd always needed to strain to hear whether or not his partner was enjoying themselves, listening hard for the slightest hitch in their breathing, but with Tony he didn't have to wonder. Tony let him know what he liked, freely, enthusiastically, and that –
She led him to her mother's old study, feeling almost a little melancholy as she looked at the cream colored furniture – the same she'd had back then – before she shook her head and turned to face Steve.
“Not much.” Tony took his glass over to the living room, waving a hand at JARVIS to pull up Netflix. “I'll probably go to bed in a bit.”
,” Tony groaned, rubbing his hands over his face. “I swear to god, you're not going to maul me in your sleep!”
It was his. Not Bucky's or Clint's. Steve picked up the letter and read it again, his heart pounding as the full implications of it hit him, sending a frisson of mortification down his spine. His hands clenched into fists, crumpling the letter at the corners as he stared at his own name at the top.
“They did it again,” she lamented, tossing her phone at Pepper who was tapping away at her laptop next to her. “Read that shit!”
“Oh.” Tony glanced up to find Steve looking down at him with a mix of surprise and understanding. “Yes, of course. If you're still feeling agitated –“
Steve was breathing heavily already, but Toni didn't give him a break, unbuttoning his shirt and pushing it off his shoulders so he was only in his undershirt. They'd gotten this far before, made out with only a thin barrier of fabric between them, but tonight felt special. Toni didn't want it to end there.
“Okay,” Tony said quietly, and Steve put down his cup so he could pull Tony into his arms, pushed up firmly against his side. It was a little awkward, but Tony solved that problem by swinging a leg over Steve and settling in his lap and – oh yeah, that was perfect.
Tony propped his hands up on his hips, looking at the perfectly baked apple pie that was sitting on the counter in front of him, its crust dewy with a buttery sheen, the filling glistening under the kitchen light. It looked amazing. Good enough to eat.
“Do you feel any lingering stress?” Steve asked, and Tony rolled his shoulders, surprised to find that any tension he'd had before was just – gone. His muscles were a little rubbery, like they'd been sapped of their strength, but even that felt good when coupled with the feeling of the pleasant buzz under his skin that made his body soft and his vision hazy. He almost felt a little drunk.
Steve held up his arms, and Tony grabbed his glass, angrily pouring the scotch into it. He raised it to his lips, his hand trembling as he held it there for several seconds before he slammed it down onto the bar, liquid sloshing everywhere. “God
“Oh,” Steve whimpered, and Tony caught him when Steve's knees suddenly buckled, his hands coming up to cling on to Tony with trembling fingers. “Oh my
He swallowed and felt a shiver run down his spine when Steve groaned in response, a quiet, broken sound that seemed to reverberate in Tony's chest. Tony looked up to meet his eyes, his heart pounding at the desperation he found there. He pulled back, moving his tongue all over the underside of Steve's cock before he let it pop out of his mouth and took several deep breaths.
“Well, you got me, don’t you?” Tony asked and Steve smiled so sweetly that Tony couldn’t not press a kiss to his lips. “It’s real, I promise.”
Bucky's shoulders stiffened before he took a deep breath and consciously relaxed. "Well, you found me." He shouldered his bag as he turned to face Tony with an unreadable expression. "Move."
“Tony,” Steve breathed and it seemed as though Tony wavered for a second, revealing something soft and vulnerable underneath his anger.
Tony hid a fond smile behind his hand as he twisted his other in Steve's palm, interlacing their fingers.
The elevator dinged as they arrived on the ground floor, and Steve stumbled out on shaky legs, taking a deep breath to compose himself before he briskly walked through the lobby, his hand still grasping Tony's.
"I'll show you what," Tony said, grabbing their clothes on his way to the bathroom. "Come on, I want to suck you off in the shower."
The Avengers alarm blared. All of them looked up at where JARVIS was flashing a red alert signal. Great.
"What?" Bucky cut in. "How does that help with –" He broke off, his eyes widening with realization. "You want me to stand trial."
“Oh god,” he whined, throwing his head back as his eyes squeezed shut. Tony could feel Steve's knot swelling against his ass, catching on the rim as it grew bigger and bigger with every thrust – “I can't –
Tony was panting by the time Steve's hips started stuttering tellingly, the sound of skin on skin getting even louder as he sped up. “Fuck. You gonna knot me again?”
“I'll say,” Steve laughed, still a little on edge as he looked up at the plant – which had shrunk considerably now. He blinked, not quite believing his eyes as he watched it retreat back into what he assumed was the glass container Tony had kept it in before all this, going so far as to grab for the lid with its vines and pluck it back onto the container, sealing it shut. “Uh.”
“One moment.” Steve walked over to what looked like a linen closet in the corner of the room, grabbing a long nightgownish piece of clothing and holding it out to Tony. “Put this on, please. You can set your clothes down on the chair over there.” He gestured at the back of the room. “I'll see to something in the staff room, but I'll be back with you in a minute, okay?”
I feel like I need to stress this in case some of you haven't read the other installments of the series: These are real life pictures of penises. If you don't want to see that, please skip this chapter or stop reading once they get to the sexting. Please proceed with caution!
“Wait, really?” Finally, there was the concern Tony was looking for. “That’s awful, Tones, I’m sorry.”
“You have nothing to be sorry for, Steve,” Tony said soothingly, but Steve only grimaced and clung to him tighter. “I promise. Just tell me what's wrong.”
“Just –“ Tony moaned when Steve's hand tightened on reflex before he started stroking again, his brow creasing in thought.
The doors hissed as they opened and Steve stepped inside, mindful to leave enough space behind him so Tony could maneuver around as he did what Tony asked, grabbing on to the nearest pole. Tony's arms wrapped around his waist and Steve widened his stance, his pulse jumping when Tony slid his hands across his stomach.
“I've got you,” Tony panted, gripping Steve's thighs with both hands, probably hard enough to bruise.
Steve had always enjoyed hiking by himself. His mother used to get worried sick when he ran around the woods all day and only came back after dark, but Steve loved it, loved the fresh air and the smell of pine trees. Now even more so, when he could combine his errands in the next village over with a nice trek through the forest. It was good for his lungs too, or so the doctor had said.
“Yeah,” Tony said, realizing all of a sudden that they'd never really talked about this – “What would you change about them?”
Tony could hear the snappish undertone in his own voice, but Dr. Yinsen didn't seem affected, his hand a blur as he wrote something in his notebook, nodding along to Tony's words.
“No, it's – shit,” Steve sighed, running a hand through his hair. “It's not you. I just – I'm not used to –“
going to feed on him?” Tony asked, barely suppressing the fear in his voice as Steve stiffened at his side. “What, are you going to kill him?”
“Just like that,” Tony breathed, and Steve cursed, arching off the bed as he stared at Tony like he was barely hanging on to his sanity.
“You're doing so well, Tony,” Steve said, and Tony felt the praise rush through him like a soothing balm, calming the storm that was still racing through his mind. “Why are you being punished?”
“Just let it out.” Tony poked him in the ribs. “Scream, curse, whatever you want. You never have, right? You should try it, it's fun.”
Steve stared at Tony's back for a moment longer before he mentally shrugged and climbed the rest of the way out of the pond. He was just about to pull on his trousers when he felt a sliver of – not quite hesitation.
Steve couldn't have stopped grinning if he tried, clutching the phone to his cheek so hard it almost hurt. "I guess we will."
“Then why are you still here?” he asked before his thoughts could drift even further, and Tony weighed his head side to see like he was thinking, crossing his arms over his chest. If he were facing this way Steve would see his huge –
“I love you,” Tony said quickly, grabbing Steve's head to pull him down and mash their lips together, scrambling up onto his knees for a better angle as he kept talking against Steve's mouth. “You fucking idiot. Of course I love you!”
“Thanks. You clean up nice too,” Toni said, grabbing two champagne flutes off a passing waiter's tray before she handed one to Steve. “Here you go. To us.”
Steve looked up from his porridge to find Bucky staring straight at him, his fingers steepled under his chin. “What?”
“It'll be fine, Pep. You'll see.” Tony swung his feet up on the couch, cradling his bowl of nachos to his chest. “I bet you fifty that I can climb three ranks in that session.”
“Not here,” Steve said firmly, setting Tony back on his feet as he straightened his clothes. Tony barely restrained himself from pouting. “Let’s go to our room.”
“You guys are amazing,” Tony purred, tilting his head just so as he smirked at the camera. “I can't wait to see who'll be the lucky one. Or the one getting lucky?” He chuckled, letting the sound catch roughly in his throat the way he knew his audience liked. “I guess we'll see.”
It took a long time for them to pull apart and by then Steve was laughing into the kiss, unable to hold it in when he felt like a winner, like he'd finally gotten everything he ever wanted.
to touch me?” he asked, not quite sure where this sudden brazenness came from, but Tony just grinned knowingly, his eyes twinkling with mirth.
“Well.” Tony dragged the one syllable out as his smile turned to teasing, making something low in Steve's gut flare with warmth. “I might be in the area. Around noon. In two days.”
“Sorry,” Steve stammered as he tried to push himself back up, but Tony wrapped his arms around his neck, hanging on like a limpet until Steve lowered himself back down, much more cautiously this time. “Tony?”
Clint chuckled, and Steve took that as answer enough, settling in to watch the movie. He was glad that Bucky didn’t dig further because Steve wasn’t sure he could explain it, even to himself.
you,” Pepper said and wisely hung up before Tony could change his mind again. Tony dropped down onto the couch with his bowl of regret in cheese form and tapped at his phone, pulling up his social stats.
Steve's hand came down on his ass like the crack of a whip, and all of a sudden the knot in Tony's chest loosened, because if
“Oh.” He watched Tony's eyes light up in understanding before they softened with sympathy as Tony laid his hands on Steve's arms. “I'm sorry. I should've known...”
“No, it's okay.” Tony gave him an open smile that only had a hint of tension buried underneath. “If you want to cut this short I can –“
Steve knotted him two more times before promptly passing out, his face pressed between Tony's shoulder blades as he snuffled out the satisfied purring noise that he only ever made after rutting. It was unbelievably cute – and the fact that Tony could say that after just getting fucked through the mattress by the same guy was saying something – so it almost seemed like a shame for him to pull away once Steve's knot deflated enough to let him.
When he wrapped it around his cock in the bedroom later, getting crumbs all over the sheets as he fucked his fist, he thought about what Steve's face would look like if he could see him like this.
“Told you.” Tony sounded so smug that Steve hit him weakly in reprimand, his whole body curling into the motion of Tony's fingers inside him to try and keep him there. He barely noticed when Tony added a third, already riding so high that it felt like he would burst, but when Tony teased at his rim with a
“That needs to go too,” she husked, and Steve kicked his shoes off before he started fumbling with his belt, pulling it out of its loops. Meanwhile Toni slid her dress the rest of the way down her body and stepped out of it, completely naked except for her high heels. She sat back on the bed, spreading her legs as she leaned back on her arms, and when Steve finally looked over at her he froze in mid-step, his whole body tense. His eyes darted down between her thighs as he licked his lips, and Toni smiled when he almost fumbled the pants he'd been folding in his hands. He looked delightfully overwhelmed.
“I think that's enough,” he declared after a few moments, hitting the button again to make it stop as he sauntered back over to the other side, swinging his hips as he went. “Let's see who the lucky winner is.”
"Lots and lots of beard oil." Tony grinned when Steve snorted. "No, seriously. Let me give you a face massage with that thing on. You'll change your tune real quick."
“I do not doubt that.” T'Challa sounded like he very much did. “But isn't it preferential to treat someone as being above the law? Mr Barnes deserves to be prosecuted for his crimes like every other man.”
And either way, Steve didn't feel quite ready to go home to a silent house. He'd take any distraction he could get.
The white-knuckled grip they had on each other didn't loosen even as their kiss gentled into something a little less frantic, lingering caresses that made Tony's heart sing. His breathing hitched every time Steve's lips caught on his and Tony found himself smiling into the kiss until they were simply touching, neither of them pulling away even as they grinned dopily against each other's lips.
Bucky slowly reached up to touch his face, turning it this way and that to look at himself from all angles. Tony pretended not to notice when his eyes got a little misty, turning away to give him a moment.
Tony closed his eyes as Steve trailed kisses down his stomach, twisting into the touch until Steve breathed directly on his cock and his hips dropped flat on the bed as all air rushed out of him.
Steve's doubt must've shown on his face because Tony sighed and tapped a finger right under his eye.
"I know." Steve sat down on his bed, cradling the phone with both hands. "It's so good to hear your voice."
“About to be a whole lot better I think,” Tony said brightly, his eyes tracking Steve’s hands as he squirted the lube bottle onto the gap at the top. “Man, I wish they could’ve made it temp-sensitive. I’d love to feel that.”
“Ah!” Steve's legs wobbled when Tony suddenly rubbed him vigorously, hard enough to draw a noise from him that made Steve's cheeks fill with heat. Tony immediately slowed down again, but Steve could see the elderly woman glance up at him for a second before she went back to her conversation with her husband. Holy shit, that had been way too –
“Tony? Where –“ He trailed off into a sigh when someone once again grabbed his ass. With both hands this time. “Of course. Should've known.”
Wow, the last few weeks have been stressful. I hope you guys are doing better than me because hot damn, I just want to push a pause button on my whole life xD Anyway, please enjoy this chapter and I'll see you in two days!
“Well, I do this thing, on OnlyFans – Do you follow me on OnlyFans?” Steve's eyes went even wider, but he nodded again. “Okay. Great. So, if you want to I'd really love to show you a good time. And possibly take a picture after, so I can show everyone how much I enjoyed our time together. Is that something you're interested in?”
“It got worse over night, didn't it?” Steve asked tiredly, and Bruce patted his hand across the table.
He'd barely made it through to the other side before Tony was tucking him back in and zipping up his pants, standing up to give him another kiss. Steve hummed, licking the taste of himself straight out of Tony's mouth, and Tony groaned.
“Alright, alright,” Steve said, taking a step closer only for the plant to suddenly retreat further into the room. “What –”
Steve had his phone at his ear before he even knew what he was doing, stomping around his apartment in a tight circle as he waited for Bucky to pick up.
“Would it kill you to swallow before you talk?” Pepper asked, then sighed. “I heard it after I said it. Please don't make the joke.”
“I'm good,” he said, a little surprised to find that it was true. He'd expected to wake up in severe pain after that ordeal, but he was pleasantly sore at worst, feeling a little like he'd just woken up from a full night's rest. Which couldn't be what happened, seeing as the sun was still up in the sky. “Thanks.”
New chapter, yay! I hope you guys enjoy this one and thank you for your patience, I'll update again soon <3
He was breathing heavily, and somewhere deep down he knew he was being ridiculous, but he was so fucking
"I served three tours in Afghanistan," Steve blurted out, wanting to slap himself in the mouth a second later, but Mr. Stark only paused for a moment before he nodded, his eyes shining with genuine interest. Perhaps that was what gave Steve the strength to keep going. "I have trouble... I mean it's just – people are – a lot, sometimes." He took a deep breath, folding his hands in his lap. "I'm getting better, but. I have bad days. And, well –"
A month ago on the exact day that I meant to post this chapter my laptop broke. This fic was completely finished but for some reason I had no safety copies of it (same with about 20 other WIP fics, probably about 150k words in total) because apparently I am a complete dumbass. The technicians I sent my laptop to for repairs couldn’t retrieve the data and I was so devastated that I pulled away from fandom for a while because I didn't have the motivation to write anything.
The last chapter is heeeeere! I can't believe it's over, but at the same time I can. Thank you so much for reading and I hope you enjoy the finale! <3
“Okay,” Steve said after a long moment, his breath brushing the side of Tony’s face. “Now, do you want to talk about it?”
Rhodey sighed but allowed Tony to snuggle up to him as they settled in to watch a movie. Tony tried to let it soothe his worries away, but Rhodey’s words kept burrowing under his skin, making him restless.
“I think she'd prefer my liver with a nice chianti,” Steve said drily, and Tony snorted. “No, she's fine. We brought Clint along on that last stretch, so she's been a lot happier. I think we both needed a break from sitting on top of each other all day.”
Steve sighed. “Look, Tony, it's not a big deal. They want a human to be there? Fine. If it means that you won't have to look over your shoulder anymore, then that's okay with me.”
Tony snorted. “Right. And you think Steve is going to be happy with an omega that doesn't even have heats.”
Tony was going to come soon, and luckily he could tell that Steve felt it too, his hips stuttering in the way that usually preceded him shooting his load deep inside Tony's ass. Tony's fingers were tingling, his stomach coiling as the pressure kept building until he thought he could barely stand it.
“So what? You’re just gonna let him go without telling him how you feel?” Sam asks, disbelief in his voice. “Man up and just talk to him! It’s been nine days of you dodging him! Nope, don’t even try to deny it, Natasha and I talk.”
Steve had his eyes squeezed shut, his lips pressed firmly together as he breathed through that initial rush of being
“Okay,” Steve said breathlessly, doing as Tony asked and settling back down on top of him as if they really were just cuddling up for the night. Tony stroked his hands up and down Steve’s back, closing his eyes as he reveled in the closeness, in the feeling of Steve’s weight on top of him, inside him. Steve let out an unsteady breath, relaxing into Tony’s touch until he went completely limp, draped over Tony’s chest like a warm blanket. Tony hummed.
“I’m sorry,” he choked out, and Steve hummed, pressing a kiss to his temple before he pulled Tony further into his arms, almost lifting him up off the floor.
“You have nothing to be sorry for.” Steve's hands wandered down to Tony's hips before he promptly stood up, ignoring Tony's startled yelp as he carried him over to the bathroom. Tony flicked him in the shoulder.
When she was finally done she released her grip, stroking her hand soothingly through his hair as she looked down at him, her stomach twisting with primal satisfaction at the dazed look in his eyes, the fluids smeared all over his chin and down his neck.
He laid his clothes down on a big tree stump in direct sunlight so they would be warm when he got out before he waded into the water, feeling shivers run up and down his spine at the cold. With what little meat he had on his bones he knew he'd have to hurry not to get chilled, so he quickly stepped under the waterfall to get soaked before he moved to the alcove where he could sit comfortably in the water and soap up his body and hair.
“But true.” Pepper smiled tiredly. “Look, do you really want him? In more than a one night stand kind of way? Or is this just a passing fad?”
“Good,” Tony groaned, and anything that reduced Tony, the man who never stopped talking, to mono-syllabic answers had to be pretty damn incredible. “It's – oh,
Tony frowned, feeling along the suspiciously flat surface of Steve's shaft. Steve looked like he was ready to blow, how wasn't he swelling already?
“Does it matter? I'm stuck!” Tony tried to twist out of the plant's hold, turning pleading eyes on Steve when it didn't work. “Get me out of here, please?”
"I'm putting everyone here in danger by staying," Bucky said, his hands clenching into fists. "I won't let you cover for me."
“It's very nice to meet you. My name is Dr. Steve Rogers, but you may call me Steve. I'll be performing your pelvic massage today.” Tony bit his lip when Dr. Ro –
“I guess so,” Tony said and Steve squeezed his hands before he let go to sit up a little straighter.
“This,” Steve said, and the way that his fingers slid easily through Tony's crack made Tony realize just how wet he was. “Please?”
Steve's hips started twitching under his hands where Tony was holding him down, and Tony could feel the tension building as Steve's back arched, his breathing coming faster and faster as he bent over Tony, his free hand clenching in Tony's hair.
“Don't sound too excited about it,” Tony quipped before he shivered as some of the leaves drew patterns across his lower back. “Oh fuck...”
“Toni,” Steve whined, hunching his back when she pulled him forward by the hair, his hips jerking as he tried to fuck her fist, hands clenching on her shoulders. He was probably going to leave bruises, but god, did Toni not give a shit. “Oh god – oh god –“
came to a halt in front of him, still at a respectable distance, but close enough that Tony could get a good whiff of his scent. His toes curled in his shoes. “Do you have any questions?”
“Yes, really.” There was something almost a little sad in Dr. Yinsen's eyes. “Please tell me about the procedure.”
Tony twisted just enough to look at him, but Steve averted his eyes. He sighed. “Look, I know you'll miss avenging, but it's only for a short time, okay? And if anything really big goes down they'll be begging you to lead the charge anyway.”
Tony sucked in a breath but obediently started fucking Steve's fist again, the added pressure making his stomach curl with heat. He knew it wouldn't take long, and judging by the way the muscles in Steve's arm kept jumping he wasn't far behind.
He hadn't thought that he'd be stupid enough to allow himself to fall for someone so far out of his league, and an alpha no less, but Steve Rogers was a curveball that Tony hadn’t expected. And if he was honest with himself, he’d known from the first time that he saw him that he stood no chance of trying to stop himself from falling.
Steve immediately changed course, taking a couple of steps back and letting out a breath of relief when the plant loosened its grip. “Fuck. Are you okay?”
He took the elevator up to the penthouse, silently praying that Steve wouldn't be waiting up for him, but his vain hope was shattered when he saw Steve sitting on the couch, apparently reading a book. Tony veered left before Steve could see him, heading straight to the bar where he poured himself three fingers of Scotch. If he could just take it to their bedroom before – “Hey, Tony. You're home early.”
“Something I said?” Tony asked with a frown and Steve shook his head, his lips curling up in a small smile.
suit." Tony patted the armor's flank, lingering on the red and white stripes that trailed up its legs. The design was completely different from Steve's suit, but Tony couldn't resist sticking with the red, white and blue. "You like?"
Tony leaned down for a kiss, heart thumping at the noise Steve made when their lips met, his hips stuttering underneath them. He quickly picked up the pace again and Tony couldn't help the way his hands clenched, probably leaving scratch marks on his back.
“I can smell you,” he murmured, and Steve leaned down to nuzzle Tony's hair, scenting him right back.
“You guess?” Mr. Stark asked. “Come on, I spent months developing that silicone tube in its ass. On a scale of one to ten, how realistic does it feel?”
been on a subway, but when Tony's hand slid down to cup him through his pants his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth.
Steve listened to the beep after Tony hung up for several seconds before he put the phone down, his stomach churning with something not quite pleasant. He hated not knowing what was going on.
, practically impaled on Steve's cock, and he pulled back in a hurry, taking several deep breaths through that flash of almost-pain.
Steve swallowed hard, pulling the doll's hips up so he could arrange its legs underneath until it looked like it was kneeling, presenting its ass to Steve. It felt all sorts of perverted, but Steve was determined to try it out, just this once. He had to see it through now.
God, that thought alone, of all the things she was going to teach him, made her pussy throb for action.
"Hey," he said and Steve raised his head just enough to look at him, the fond warmth in his eyes making Tony's stomach clench. "You're here."
Steve pushed down his pants just enough to free his cock, spitting into his palm before he grabbed himself with more purpose now, a nice up and down stroke that made his thumb catch on the dip right below his glans. His eyes were closed as he thought of the last time he'd gotten a blowjob, letting his imagination fill in the gaps in his memory, the sight of brown eyes and a trimmed beard around his –
Sometimes she caught herself staring at the date on her calendar with the kind of hatred that she usually reserved for the bastards who thought that being a woman made her an easy target, even in the armor. The thing was, with those assholes at least she had something physical to take her frustration out on. Unlike her aging body.
Steve was probably way too far gone for any sort of foreplay already, so Tony grabbed his cock firmly, stroking it right away. The slide was made smooth by how wet Steve already was, practically dripping with pre-come, and Tony bit his lower lip when Steve made a downright desperate noise, fucking up into Tony's fist like he was seconds away from coming.
Bucky tutted, wrapping an arm around his shoulders. “That’s not how presents work, Stevie. It’s gotta be a surprise.”
Steve wasn't even looking at him, sitting at his desk and sifting through papers with an air of professional distance around him that made Tony think that it
“Just trust me, okay?” Tony spread his legs, reveling in the noise Steve made when his cock slid down between his thighs. “Come on. You won't hurt me, I promise.”
Steve bit down on his fist as he suddenly came, watching his come pool in Tony's invisible mouth for a second before he swallowed and it disappeared in mid-air. He grabbed the back of Tony's head, twisting his fingers in the strands to guide him back and forth as he rode out the last of his orgasm, his thighs trembling so much they were barely holding him up.
“Perfect,” Steve sighed, reeling Tony in with an arm around his shoulders as he turned them over, twisting until he was lying on top of Tony, pressing him back into the couch cushions. Tony had absolutely zero complaints, and he let Steve know it with an enthusiastic moan as Steve ground down against him, still kissing him thoroughly.
Tony wrapped his arms even tighter around Steve, purring under his breath when Steve started stroking his hair. Whatever was going to happen, they'd make it through to the other side together.
"Stay here and let me do this my way." Bucky opened his mouth but Tony shushed him with a raised hand. "Not yours, not Steve's, not Fury's. Mine. All I'm asking is that you trust me to handle this. Do you trust me?"
Tony picked up as much of the fallen pie filling as he could before he folded the tray and put the whole thing in the trash. Steve was already in the shower when he joined him, wrapping his arms around his waist from behind.
I just keep adding more chapters... the fic is running away from me again, help xD Anyway, I hope you enjoy this chapter and I'll see you tomorrow! If all goes well we'll have daily updates for the rest of the week :)
Bucky was silent as Tony wet his hair, brushing it with sure strokes before he separated the first strand, squeezing it between his fingers to pull it straight. The snipping sound of the scissors seemed almost unbearably loud in the room.
Steve helped Tony shuffle up onto the table, and Tony caught himself leaning into the strong grip on his arms for a second too long before he snapped out of it and let Steve guide him down onto his stomach. He could feel the sphere digging into his groin, and Steve gently urged him up until Tony's crotch was settled right on top of it, his penis and balls pressed against its underside.
When Pepper broke up with him Tony went through the usual stages of denial, anger, depression, acceptance – and bought a gigantic angel cake to stick his dick into. At that point he'd had to accept that this was becoming a thing, but as he did with most anything else Tony shrugged it off and continued on with his life. So what if he occasionally bought baked goods with the sole intention of fucking them? People did weirder things every day.
Steve let out a small moan when Tony rubbed out a particularly stubborn knot, mouthing at Tony's skin in a way that sent a shiver down his spine, and all of a sudden Tony had the perfect idea of how to make this even better.
, and Steve pulled him up into his arms and hugged him close, strong and steady as Tony clung to him like a limpet, crying into his chest.
“Spit in your palm,” she said, and he did what she asked without question, still looking up at her for guidance. Toni wouldn't lie and say that the rush of power wasn't doing it for her. “Coat your fingers. Get them wet.”
“Hey,” Tony said and Steve could feel the motion of his jaw against his fingers that looked like they were just hovering in mid-air. But he could
Tony wiped at his forehead – and grimaced when his hand came away wet with come. Steve made a strangled noise, but before Tony could tease him about it Steve offered him the corner of his discarded pants, his face decidedly more red than before. “Here.”
Tony liked to believe that Steve was a reasonable man. That he saw through complex patterns and abided by logic when someone presented it to him. That he knew Tony's limits and managed to respect them without ever making Tony feel like he was getting coddled or that Steve thought he couldn't take care of himself.
“So that was sex. How do you like it?” Toni asked with her usual tact, and Steve laughed brightly, nuzzling her hair. She could feel his broad grin against her cheek when he pressed a kiss to it.
“There's a ritual, okay?” Tony glared at him. “They have this – well, I guess all vampires have... a thing.”
“I love you.” Steve pressed a soft kiss to Tony's slack mouth. “You don't have to say it back. I know, after what I did –“
"Hey, To –" was as far as he got before Tony cut him off with a kiss, fisting his hands in Steve's hair to pull him closer, fuck, he
calm down!” Steve shouted. “You go! Tell them you – just tell them whatever, but I’m not setting a goddamn foot in that place!”
As a result he'd been less than enthusiastic about the process of finding hot guys to suck off for OnlyFans pictures, if only because he'd already gone through pretty much everyone in close vicinity that had a halfway decent cock. But it wasn't as if he could just randomly pull some dude off the street and expect them to be enthusiastic about meeting him, let alone having their cock posted on –
Steve's cock was fantastic. It was big but not too big. Long but not too long. Thick but not too thick. The goldilocks dreamboat of dicks, and Tony had to swallow down a hysterical laugh because that would be really inappropriate.
“Not saying you should. I'm just saying, your options are pretty damn limited here, so you're gonna have to make a choice.” Bucky propped his arms up on the table as he leaned forward. “Can you live with the Accords if it means getting to come home to Tony and everyone else?”
Tears prickled at his eyes on the last stretch, and when he was finally seated on Tony's thighs they were both panting heavily, clutching at each other as Tony's forehead pressed against Steve's shoulder.
“You want to see if the real deal measures up?” Mr. Stark asked with a raised eyebrow, and Steve felt his cheeks heat furiously.
Steve pinched him and Tony laughed, throwing an arm around Steve’s shoulders. “Come on. If you like this suit you’re gonna
“This doesn't make me want you any less,” Tony said firmly, and Steve sucked in a breath that emerged as a sob, as much from built up tension as it was from relief, and Tony immediately pulled him into his arms to hold him close. “It's alright, Steve. I still want to be with you, okay? This doesn't change anything.”
“We're not forcing you to actively participate in our Council duties, Mr. Stark. All we want is to offer the vampires of New York our protection in case they run into trouble with the more... discriminatory parts of society.” There was something dark in his eyes as he looked straight at Tony. “We can't do that if you aren't registered in our program.”
“Do me next!” Clint shouted, speed-walking over to Sam so he could grab him by the shoulders. “My mom's a hoe, I have awful b.o, come on, Wilson,
He choked, his entire body jostling when Tony suddenly sped up, ramming into him so hard that Steve thought he would pass out for a second –
Steve rolled his eyes, lifting the grocery bag in his hands as Clint let him into his apartment. “I didn’t forget, don’t worry.”
I couldn't resist bringing this plot point back. If you've read KBAB you'll know what I mean ;) Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this!
Bucky shrugged nonchalantly. “Just saying. If Tony says you need to lay low it's gotta be about you somehow. And knowing you you've probably come up with every possible scenario in the book already.”
“That's so good,” Tony breathed, and Steve made a noise that was somewhere between a moan and a whimper, wrapping Tony up in his arms. “Don't move yet, just – I just want to feel you.”
“But!” Tony's eyes looked stoic, but Steve could still see a sliver of fear underneath. “After that you let me go. Deal?”
Steve barked a laugh, feeling his shoulders lose some of their tension as Tony stroked his hands, his thumbs digging in much harder than they usually did. Steve appreciated the gesture more than he could say.
“It's my job,” Steve said, his voice a little more distant when he spoke to Obie, but when his eyes landed on Tony he gave him a quick smile. “Stay safe, Mr. Stark. And let us know if you feel any recurring symptoms.”
Tony forced a noise of assent out through his tight throat, his hands scrabbling on the table as his hips moved against the massager of their own accord, rubbing up against the vibrating metal. It felt like his cock was on
“Dad loved her.” Tony stroked Steve's hair, silently glad when Steve leaned into the touch instead of pushing him away. “Always invited her for Christmas. Her and uncle Da–“ Tony bit his lip but Steve raised his head, giving him a weak smile. There were dried tear tracks on his face and Tony reached up to wipe them away as gently as he could.
He knew he didn't burn in sunlight and that blood bags did the trick. Anything else was not worth dwelling on.
Steve rolled his eyes, and by the time he looked up again Tony was gone, only the sound of rushing water and birdsong filling the silence. He hoisted his basket over his arm as he started his trek back to the main path, humming under his breath.
stop, if it kept winding him tighter and tighter until Tony crumpled in on himself and completely disappeared –
He'd told her those exact words more than once since they'd started dating, but it still felt like the first time every time. Toni basked in the compliment, stepping closer to slide a leg between his and grinning when she felt his hard cock against her hip.
“Of course, Mr. Stane,” Dr. Yinsen said, still with that bland smile, before he turned to Tony. “If you'll follow me, Mr. Stark, I'll take you to your physician.”
“That’s alright.” Steve could already hear the slick sounds of Tony stroking himself, but when he glanced up the sight still made his stomach twist with arousal. “I'll be right there with you. Just fuck me.”
“We fight every time we're in the same room, you hate my face, you've told me straight up that you don't like the way I do anything and two years ago you slammed your shield into my chest. Clearly you're not in love with me.”
If the man wasn’t a grown up Steve might have just gone over there to tug the boy away and yell at the man about maybe picking on somebody his own size, but he promised his Ma he wouldn’t get into trouble — well, not on the
Steve himself rarely made use for the art studio and Tony doesn’t think he’s stepped back into it since he showed it to Steve, until now.
- but he did it! They’re on their date as we speak, and no offence Steve but I don’t he had this in mind for their first date.”
“He just- he makes me so- ugh,” Steve stabs a piece of his waffle a little to viciously, bring it to his mouth. “Ifp owhn-“
Someone enters the bathroom, and Steve dashes to the tissue dispenser, pulling the roll too hard. The man looks at a flustered Steve, holding a handful of tissue in his palm, looks right into the camera lens and then walks out.]
him with the memories of having to gladhand with influential people from when he’d been touring as Captain America before the moniker had really
“Uh, I can’t - if I tell you, it won’t come true,” he says and grabs at the stick in Tony’s hand. “I -I could write it, in the sand for you though.”
“Rhodey is off talking to your Chief of Police. I think he likes her,” he says before taking a sip of his coffee.
Tony sticks his tongue out at him. “Oh shut it, let’s be cheesy! Alright, since you didn’t want a cake and from the way Clint is guarding the marshmallows, I doubt we’ll get much for dessert so here,” he says, drawing a cake shaped blob in the sand with the stick. “Close your eyes, make a wish, and blow out the candle before the ocean does.”
Bucky chuckles, “You know I was kinda delirious when Sam got me and according to him I asked ‘Does it hurt when you descend from heaven like that’ but he still went on a date with me so I guess my lines ain’t all too bad.”
“Like I said, nothing is ruined. Look over there huh,” Steve points over to where Natasha, Clint and Bruce are.
“That absolutely does not surprise me,” Fury says, sitting down on the plastic chair beside Tony’s desk. One of the legs is uneven to the rest, causing the chair to wobble. “The kid hates bureaucracy but he’s passionate about what he does here.”
Steve stops having his nightmares after Tony buys him a new bed sheet set, simply waking up and forgetting whatever his subconscious cooked up.
Thor and Bruce were sitting atop the blanket, passing a bowl of grapes back and forth as they watched the sunset, Bucky was setting up the bonfire area with Rhodes and Wanda was sitting on a boulder with Vision, both of them smiling softly at each other.
“As I’ve mentioned before Mr. Rogers,” Tony sighs, “I’m here to fix your town’s budget. A mess of which your own government is to blame for. I’m not the bad guy here.”
She’s always been overly protective of Tony. Tiberius Stone still bolts at the mere sight of her - which,
Steve, Sam and Bucky are having an argument on the cushions, shoot glasses drained in front of them.
“No engineer binging until after food and debrief,” Steve cuts in, left eyebrow arched which translates to,
Steve says the only reason Tony tries out for cheerleading is to be a rebel and to effectively drive Steve insane.
“Uh, I’ll fix that if needed,” he says, clasping his hands together in front of him. “But anyway, the harvest festival!”
“Barnes, where the hell is Rogers? The phone has been ringing insistently about this whole Healthcare Department fiasco,” he says, crossing his arms, the sleeves of his leather trench coat making a crunching sound.
colours but - I, I really like them during the sunsets too. They’re pretty,” he says, trying not to wince at how awkward he sounds.
Bucky had laughed in his face when Steve had told him the plan because he said Steve wears all his emotions right between his eyebrows but he isn’t about to mess this up now.
It lands with a solid thunk and Steve frowns at him. “You’re so lucky that was just clothes and not something more fragile.”
The moving truck is parked in front of the building so Steve parks his jeep on the other side of the street and Tony jumps right out the moment the car stills.
Okay, so now Steve is confused and a little worried because why is this a hard day for Tony? But he can’t think of -
Looking at Tony isn’t an option, so he stares in the direction of where his painting hangs and says, “Just nervous. A lot of my grade is riding on this. Why didn’t you bring Thor?”
“Steve isn’t- we’re not- limpets,” Tony falters, his italian colouring doing little to hide the pink in his face.
“I think I can remember that without needing to jot it down baby,” Steve tell him, pulling on his clothes.
and he finds himself being enveloped in a hug from all angles, squeezed so tight he can barely suck in a breath.
“Yeah, all your whining about having to do exercise, but it’s worth it, right? Hard pressed to get a view like this out in DC.”
He just watches and laughs at Tony antics as they enter the diner and wishes he could hold Tony’s hand as they walk.
Steve’s jaw clenches but he turns his head to kiss at Tony’s fingertips. “I’ll be fine. I’m just worried about Buck. I’ll check up on him later.”
He turns back to the bed but stops short at the sight of Steve curled up, his big frame bent inwards as if he’s trying to make himself small as possible, a death grip on the blankets he’s tugging around him like he’s trying to bury himself in the warmth despite the fact that Tony can see sweat pooling on his brow
“Rhodey,” Tony says, voice above a whisper, “they’re all going to lose their jobs. It’ll be true what he said. I’m heartless.”
The sky is steadily getting lighter, taking on a pinkish orange hue. Tony and Steve settle down on a boulder, taking sips from their water bottles.
“I know you guys are always talking shit about me at home,” Steve says, pointing his fork that has a waffle piece on it accusingly at Sam, maple syrup dripping onto the table. “And no, he didn’t exactly call me stupid but it was insinuated when he asked if I knew what the [bleep] his job is. Ugh, [bleep]. He thrives on crushing dreams and sucking the joy out of the townspeople.”
All the blood swirling in Tony’s brain goes to the apples of his cheeks. “Oh. I - I really like them too. I mean
“I’m not much for nature or the big outdoors,” Tony says, looking at the view, “but this is really something Steve. Thanks for wanting me to tag along.”
Tony handles the mending of Steve’s suit now. It used to be SHIELD, but once Tony got his hands on it, he refused to let SHIELD get anywhere near any of the Avengers’ suits.
He points towards a door behind Rhodes’ desk. “That room there? That’s where all the files from all the departments are kept, filled with expenditures from the last 5 years as well as proposed projects. There are 7 entire boxes stacked with files from your department alone, with Rogers as the head of every proposal we’ve read through so far.”
Rhodes jumps up, coffee sloshing from his mug onto his hand and to the floor, “What the [bleep] dude!”
Stan comes out of the kitchen then, 4 plates on his service tray and a carafe filled with coffee. He places the coffee as well as a plate of blueberry pancakes in front of Tony and puts 3 plates filled with bacon and eggs in front of Fury before taking his leave.
“Yes, but shower first,” Nat says, hopping off the stool and dragging a grumbling Clint with her, Bucky shuffling after them to head to his and Sam’s floor.
“I can handle it,” Steve says, sliding into the backseat after him. “I’ll just tell her it was Sam that ruined her boots on that last mission.”
Tony thinks his bones have turned to liquid because he’s suddenly on his knees, kissing Steve and tasting salt.
“Rhodey is gonna stick around for a while. He’s using his vacation days so he can continue hanging out with Carol so it’ll just be me heading back.”
Fury snorts. “Typical. Lord, I might actually have to do some work around here now that a certain someone has all his attention. Here I thought that budget cuts meant less work,” he says rolling his eye.
“Steve, angel, wake up,” he coaxes, soft and gentle, stroking at Steve’s hair. “Awaken darling, it’s only a nightmare -
, under the covers and sleep until Tony is awake, eyes opening slowly and burrowing his head in Steve’s chest, a dopey smile on his lips that Steve can
They both freeze, eyes comically wide before springing apart, their clasped not letting the other get too far.
“Smart move,” he says, before going quiet, looking down at their entwined fingers long enough that Steve stops rubbing his thumb along the back of Tony’s hand.
Brunch itself goes well, and Steve finds he quite likes Rhodes and the man’s sense of humour but something in him
“Shut up, there’s no Steve haze! What even is that. Steve and I are friends and I’ll- I’ll miss him when we go, that’s all.”
“Why aren’t you standing by your work?” Natasha asks, looking gorgeous in an off-shoulder black dress, her eyes narrowed at him.
Natasha looks right at the camera and mimes stabbing herself, but the corners of her mouth are edging upwards.
Tony walks right up to him and takes his face in his hands. Steve seems to stop breathing altogether at this.
“Is that a yes?” Steve asks, laughter in his voice with a smile so bright it warms Tony to the core.
Steve gives a huff of laughter as they cross the road, Tony resisting the urge to flip off the cab honking at them lest Peter look over. “I’ll let Dada climb onto my shoulders later if he wants,” Steve says, shooting Tony a grin as they enter the ice-cream shop and Tony rolls his eyes at him.
All Steve can think is how much he wants to have this argument with Tony for the rest of their lives and he just wants to make Tony
Sam looks at Steve’s drowned waffles in disgust, “How you don’t have diabetes yet is a mystery to me. Alright, so you went barging in there, after office hours, all gung ho about the harvest festival and he said absolutely no way was it going to happen?”
“And why are you exempt from this Barton? As an absolute disaster of a person, it’s highly likely you broke it,” Natasha says.
The other man ribs Clint in the side. “I’m Pietro and I’m a patron here at Hydra Head,” he tells the camera. “My sister and I created a special drink that’s only available here, so now we pretty much run this place.”
pointed the other night,” Tony tells him, dropping his undersuit onto the floor before stepping into the shower, fiddling with the knobs until water rains down; warmth seeping into his skin and steaming up the room.
Steve can’t even think of anything to say to that because he’s watching Tony’s feet swing slightly because they’re nowhere near the ground and before he can stop it, “God, you're tiny.”
“We’re adaptable here.” Steve smiles when he sees a Beetle car pull up right beside Rhodes and Tony’s hybrid.
The camera turns away from Steve’s retreating figure to focus on Rhodes moving over to Tony who still hasn’t moved. He takes the smaller man’s hands in his, going to his knees in front of him so that they’re at eye level, “So, I can see why you said you wanted to punch him in his perfect teeth.”
“I’m not mad,” he says, hands on his hips. “I just want to know who broke it.” He fixes them all with a look that is trying to convey
Everyone stops to look at him, then looks down at the smashed coffee maker before erupting into noise, mostly calling Clint a moron.
“No, no I’m not okay,” Steve says, grabbing two shots from a passing waitress. He hands one to Tony and downs the other.
Tony flinches just slightly, leaning back in his chair but his voice is calm when he asks, “Does no one in your department respect doors or just see them as hurdles that must be defeated by splintering them?”
of a bad situation. Bucky always managed to sneak a loaf of bread and some cheese - Steve still has no idea how he managed it considering Mrs. Covington
Bucky only grins at him. “Lay off, it’s a good thing. Haven’t seen Steve interested in anything but this damn job in years. It’s about time.”
There are tears pooling in them and Steve cups Tony’s cheek to rub his thumb across the salt that spills there.
He steps out of reach and Steve’s face seems permanently set in a frown now, hand still outstretched. “Tony?”
“Thank you, Tony. I really- I appreciate all you’re doing for me,” Steve says, voice a lot calmer now than it was mere seconds ago. “I just really need this to go off without a hitch ya know. Our entire department is riding on this.”
Except that plain black velvet box has been burning a hole in the pockets of all of Steve’s clothes since he had bought the damn ring,
He gets under their covers, gives Steve a peck on the lips as he wishes him a goodnight before dropping off in less than a minute.
The benefits of a private beach means he doesn’t have to be concerned about strangers in his space at the moment, but it also means he has
All the fight seems to go out of Tony. “I could vacation for like a year at this point,” he says, standing to move the files on his desk to a box.
Rhodes only glances at him a moment, lips twitching just slightly, before moving on. “One of the most effective ways of reducing department costs is getting rid of non-essential personnel as well as identifying where there is unnecessary spending and of course ceasing all new projects.”
“It was not me! I would not smash my primary source of life,” Thor says. He pauses then adds, “Bruce being an outlier to this rule.”
Tony kisses him, hard and fast -they’re lucky their teeth didn’t clack together - before pushing him off to the field. “Go on number 29! I can’t cheer for you if you’re terrible.”
Hurt flashes across Tony’s features before his eyes go hard. His voice is like ice when he says, “You know what, I’m beginning to wonder that myself Rogers.”
places - he think the Fantastic 4 should maybe start living up to their name and deal with him for a change.

Well, either that or he’s got a gambling addiction he’s managed to hide for the last 3 years and is now in serious debt because these are the only options Tony can think to explain why Steve’s picked up
line of questioning, he takes the case back from Natasha and closes it. “I’ll hold onto this until we get you your permit and then I’ll take you to the range for lessons.”
Tony is drinking the last dregs of wine in his glass so Steve gives the server a small nod. He watches her disappear through the door, swinging closed behind her but not before Steve sees all the staff huddling around the chef.
He makes a go on gesture at Steve who shoots him a grateful look. “The harvest festival was an annual SHIELD celebration. It brought people in from all over and it’s a great way to get some money for the city. More than 50 percent of the businesses in SHIELD are local so the festival is a great way to showcase, uplift and provide income! It was scrapped two governments ago when the city was going through budget cuts.”
to ask, then I think we’re done here,” Steve says, voice cutting through the noise before pulling Tony up and out of his seat.
Rhodes’ smile gets a little doppy just then, “Yeah, Carol’s great. Though I’m surprised you’ve even noticed considering the Steve haze you’ve been in since we got here.”
Steve’s opening the backseat to help Morgan as Peter and Harley climb out, all of them turning to look at Tony in surprise.
He doesn’t enjoy the small fits-on-a-stick bites of food floating past him on trays, with a glass of something bubbly pressed into his hand that does
Steve’s cheeks go pink. “Uh, he’s a therapist. And as of recently the Head of PR for the Health Department if you can believe it.”
In a role reversal of their positions a mere three days ago, Steve takes Tony’s face in his hands and tells him, “Tones, no one is losing their jobs. We’ve got this handled. I promise the residents of this city will not let something like a little mud stop them from having their fun. You’re not heartless, you never have been. And I’m sorry for
So here he is, pacing around their tiny apartment with the clock on the mantle that is always ahead by 2 minutes
“I know not of this Natasha. My name is Natalie Rushman. I’m a very rich widow with a dark secret,” she says before grabbing Clint’s drink from his hands and downing it.
He loves Tony at 11pm - hedging into 12, in the cover of darkness as they’re so entangled in one another, breathless gasps and small laughs being shared between their lips.
So, tonight was going to be the night Steve asked him. They were going to have a romantic candlelit dinner at the apartment where Steve had cooked Tony’s favorite food, a classic Italian Carbonara with a recipe from Tony’s mother. The table was set and there were rose petals around the table and on the floor. Steve even decided to just screw it and open the bottle of red wine they had been saving for New Year’s.

Tuesday’s are their day off, which means it’s become a day spent lazing around in bed - doing nothing productive and scrolling through their netflix
“You didn’t wake me up,” Tony tells him, stroking his sweaty hair away from his eyes. “The moon did.”
“Yeah, I stopped by the bodega on the way home,” he shrugs. “Can’t afford to keep ordering out anyway.”
and Steve smiles right back, knowing that they’ll get to pick up greasy pizza from Sal’s on their way back to the tower, that when he kisses Tony he’ll taste the apple juice that Tony’s been drinking out of a champagne glass all night, that they’ll get back to the tower and peel each other out of their suits, the silk tie around his neck being used to bind for wholly
Tony is often not around, dealing with the figurative fires - and once a very literal fire in the cafeteria due to an incident with a duck and a raccoon- from the other various departments struggling through the slashes in their budgets.
His eyes seek out Tony again, - an easy task, - Tony always shines brighter than any light in the room - the crowd around him drawn in like moths to a flame.
Tony drops the pen onto his desk and pinches the bridge of his nose. “I really need a cup of coffee to get through this conversation right now,” he sighs. “Look, I can’t fire you either. Your rigidity over expenses shows the balance you bring to your department, especially over Rogers’ many many proposals over the years.”
“I’m here! I’m here!” Tony shouts from across the floor of the showroom, drawing looks from the patrons though Steve would argue that Tony draws looks
“Your mom’s tikka recipe is your ultimate comfort food, Tony. What’s got you upset?” he asks, cupping Tony’s cheek with a warm palm and Tony just
“Why are you so eager to accept his confession at face value Clint? Trying to pass the blame?” Bruce accuses, eyes narrowed behind his glasses.
Steve can’t see what the man’s face must be like since his back is to him but he imagines it must be angry and that just makes
He snorts when he sees the state of Tony’s sneakers. “You don’t got the weather app on your phone sweet thing?”
“Oh,” and Steve doesn’t even need to look to know that Tony is smiling, the one that causes crinkles in the corner of his eyes. “I finally,
Thor has streaks of mud across his face and Bruce is swiping at him with a baby wipe. Thor has to crouch down so he and Bruce can be level with each other but from the wide smile on his face, he doesn’t find it a hardship at all.
Tony’s eyebrows go up. “Exactly how fast does word get around in this town?” he asks, looking between Fury and Stan.
“We shouldn’t have just walked out,” Tony says eventually, voice still a little shaky. “That’ll just make it worse. They’re definitely going to run with the ‘
There were caterers milling about with trays of finger foods that regardless of portion size, will probably sit like a lead weight in Steve’s stomach.

“But I wa- I-“ Steve begins before he justs turns around and heads back in the direction he came from.
Steve stills then nods. “Yeah, I like the colours.” He takes a breath before looking at Tony. “I like any colours that mix in red and golds like that.”
“It’s been a long day so if it’s not too much could you maybe put all those words in a sentence that makes sense,” Rhodes says, looking between Tony and Steve.
“Alright, well let’s get wrecked!” Pietro shouts, passing out shot glasses of the clubs signature drink, aptly named Hydra Venom.
There’s a man standing in front of a boy who looks smaller than Steve does, something he didn’t even know was

Fury snorts. “Son, it is because I don’t give a [bleep] about what we do here that I can’t let you fire Rogers. You can’t afford to lose a Steve Rogers.”
A week ago, they went ice-skating. Tony had been beaming the whole time and whenever Steve kissed him it was like he could taste his happiness. But Tony has lamented before on how he didn’t care for public proposals. Has said that it’s unfair to the other party since it’s almost like they’re pressured to say yes because saying no means being a villain to the crowd that were watching. Not to mention, as someone who grew up in the public eye as the son of Howard Stark, Tony would definitely not want something as personal and intimate as a proposal to be in public. On some level, Steve agrees with that.
“As I mentioned before,” Rhodes says, “your meetings regarding your department will be handled by me. Mr. Carbonell has other pressing matters to attend to. You may begin your presentation.”

The surprise is evident on Bucky's face but he schools his expression pretty quickly. “I thought your last name was Carbonell.”
"That's –" Tony cleared his throat, averting his eyes. "He's happier with you here too. You know that, right?"
room?” Steve, if possible, sounded even more incredulous, and Tony sighed, looking at him with a small frown.
Steve shivered, taking a deep breath before he grabbed the back of her neck in a loose hold, gently pulling her closer. Toni followed his lead, letting her eyes slip shut when she felt his breath on her lips, and a second later his mouth was on hers, soft and tentative. She hummed, reaching up to tilt his head just so, and Steve made a small noise when their lips slotted together, gently, just the soft pressure of skin on skin.
Tony cut him off with a kiss that made Steve’s whole body jerk, dragging a ruined groan from him that went straight to Tony’s dick.
Tony shifted closer, and they both groaned when their cocks suddenly slid against each other, meeting in the middle. The pie filling was still warm, encasing them in heat, and when Tony thrust forward on instinct he felt that familiar give of soft dough around his cock, sending a zing of pleasure through him.
“Oh. That's – okay.” Tony looked a little alarmed now, gears obviously turning in his head. “So you – you don't feel anything? No physical sensation?”
“Nice to meet you too,” Steve said on reflex, still staying halfway turned away from the creature with his hands clasped over his genitals. He was mortified to be seen like this, but the satyr didn't seem to notice his discomfort, instead looking him up and down with an undeniably attractive smirk.
“No. I mean, well...” Tony shifted in his seat, a little uneasy at the way Dr. Yinsen kept looking at him. “It's not like it needs to be fun, right? I'm supposed to find an alpha, not make friends. And anyway, I –“
“And it's been what, three and a half since he took out the implant?” Tony asked with a raised eyebrow that Steve apparently ignored. “Tell me the last time you slept for eleven hours. I'll wait.”
So. Some of you were wondering if there was going to be a fight at the airport. And here we are. I hope you enjoy it!
Tony felt weirdly betrayed as Obie negotiated the payment details of Tony's 'disease'. For a moment he'd thought that – well, it didn't matter. Apparently Dr. Yinsen was just another one of those people who would never understand Tony.
“Right. Yeah, that makes sense.” Tony plopped down on the couch, fiddling restlessly with his hands as Steve opened the boxes and handed one to him. He had no idea why he was so jittery, almost as if he was nervous.
, and Tony realized that he could smell himself in there, his essence mixed with Steve's until they were almost indistinguishable.
– Even when he felt like he couldn't breathe, like his body was going to burst into flames because he couldn't
Steve rolled his eyes, but his smile was fond when he leaned down to kiss Tony, shifting just a tiny bit more to bring their hips together. They both groaned at the contact and Tony wasn’t embarrassed at all by how quickly he spread his legs to allow Steve closer, pulling them flush together.
Steve could feel his heart thumping in his chest, his hands suddenly sweaty. "I –" He cleared his throat. "I wouldn't do that over the phone."
T'Challa didn't seem fazed by his tone, his eyes as intent as ever. “A changed one, I presume. And if we are very lucky you may even be a just one.”
Steve gave him a tense smile that dropped off his face as soon as he walked past Tony. “Thanks,” he said through what sounded like clenched teeth, and Tony followed him, equal parts confused and curious.
“I love you,” Steve said right in his ear, and Tony was pretty sure he was going to start purring when Steve's fingers found that spot at the base of his neck and dug in, massaging any of the lingering tension away.
