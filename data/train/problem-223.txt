"Ugh, I'm tired of contesting this with you," Sherlock muttered acidly. He was fed up of discussing the issue with someone who knew
"I've never seen anyone bat their eyes in real life. Sort of thing Sherlock'd probably try, though," Greg mused with a smirk. "You know what, you tell me as much as you can, and I'll buy you something nicer than that cat-piss Foster's," he laughed.
"Is who okay, Watson? You need to lie still, sir, or we'll have to restrain you. You'll tear your stitches."
exposed. His hands came up, fluttering over his chest, and he self-consciously crossed as arms, blocking John's view.
The manager began to describe the situation succinctly and Sherlock listening raptly while at the same time wondering which of the assembled witnesses John would prefer to him, jolted in shock when he recognised the familiar weight of Lestrade's hand on his arm.
Greg, choosing not to encourage Sherlock's obvious sulk, swiftly changed the subject. "I'll get this round. Pint okay for you, John? ...Sherlock, you want anything?"
Gripping at the edge of the mattress, Sherlock moaned and tried to match the rhythm set by John, his movements jerky and erratic, and the twitching of his thighs only increasing somewhat violently. Sherlock seemed excessively sensitive to everything, his body like a strained string being wound tight and tighter, seconds away from snapping and fraying at the edges. Moaning again, Sherlock reached back with one of his hands to grip John’s naked side, digging his fingers in wildly as he encouraged John to go harder and faster.
"A coat? In this weather?" She asked, smiling. "Look, you've had a serious injury. You need to try and relax. You've been given quite a lot of painkillers and you'll be feeling confused for a while. Try to keep still, so as not to disturb the stitches."
He frowned at the sudden sound of loud, drunken jeers and cackles approaching from somewhere behind them, beyond the dense, shade-dappled thicket of delicate weeping-willows.
John felt his heart begin to palpitate, skipping beats, just as it sank like a rock to the bottom of his stomach It couldn't be. No. It couldn't be. Please. Trembling, he stuttered to explain, praying, hoping against hope. "He's...he's tall...He's...where is he?"
“Ah ah, I’ve told you before,” the detective reprimanded breathlessly, batting John’s damp left hand away from his untouched shaft, and pushing it back against the sheets by John’s head, mirroring its partner. He gave it a brief, affectionate squeeze, rolling his thumb over the ring on his finger.
anything." Sherlock said, his teasing nonchalance dropping like shedding a cloak, his reticence making itself known. He stopped twirling the briefs and held them, clutched in his fist, looking as if he regretted showing them to John in the first place.
Sherlock swallowed a few times, looking totally bewildered. "...I...don't know. How did you do that?" he asked innocently.
“Clean it up John, that’s your sort of thing,” Sherlock instructed, striding out of the room. When he didn’t return immediately, the doctor glanced down dumbly at the feline that was pawing at its aggravated flesh.
Sherlock's eyes, which had been half-lidded and clouded with lust, suddenly sharpened and he fixed John with a dark, angry expression of his own. The last vibrations from John's mobile died away, audible in the sudden hush of the flat, leaving Sherlock's cock jerking in his hand, seemingly forgotten about for the time being.
." John breathed and Sherlock shivered at his tone of voice. John forced his fingers inside, deeper, probing and stretching faster and more roughly than usual, but not hard enough to cause pain. Sherlock hissed and arched into the contact, relishing the roughness. Usually John was so gentle, patient, loving- which were all traits Sherlock loved and didn't want to change about John- but every once in a while this was nice too. Reducing John to an animalistic side he rarely exhibited-
He hissed as he opened it to a flush of bright, dazzlingly, headache inducing light from Sherlock’s bedside lamp and took a few seconds to grow accustomed to it before he turned to the man in question, who was sitting, cross-legged, in the centre of the bed on his laptop. The detective looked up at John briefly, bright, narrowing, penetrating eyes flitting over John’s face, John’s mussed hair and John’s crumpled pyjamas, and then sighed in annoyance.
Sherlock glanced into Molly's bedroom. It was more tasteful than he'd expected, the walls a subtle dusky pink, though there were still about fifteen different cuddly toys scattered about on various surfaces. Judging by her blog, she had few qualms about appearing childish, and had made no attempt to hide or even move them. He opened a few drawers, her bedside table, eyes flicking over the contents. He flashed a brief, amused grin at the lilo on the floor beside her bed, dressed with a deep-red duvet, presumably the most 'masculine' one she owned.
He pretended not to notice as John shuffled around the room, the silence between them tense and awkward. Sherlock was loathe to break it, didn't even know what to say. Where to even start. He jumped when John unexpectedly cleared his throat.
"Yes, he will." John muttered, sending Molly his love and ending the call. He gave Sherlock, whose eyes were fixed on John's soft penis, a glare. "That wasn't on. What are you doing?"
“My jokes are always in poor taste according to you,” Sherlock countered easily as he slumped back down to the bed with a sigh, stretching out his long legs only to curl them back up and turn aside to face John. He pillowed his face on his hands and gazed at him, having the nerve to look annoyed at being woken.
“Fuck, she’ll probably be straight up here,” John muttered, getting off of Sherlock’s lap and chucking a cushion in the direction of his detective’s crotch. “Don’t tell her anything yet. And don’t embarrass me.”
"Uh...yes, it is." John admitted, glancing around at all his preparation, suddenly feeling self-conscious. "It's...well, it's our 3 month anniversary."
There was a moment of stillness, of Sherlock tensing and flicking his eyes, and then he flew into action, unbuttoning his shirt with a strained exhale and almost head-butting then smacking John in the process. The fireworks were still going off, still splashing the room with colours and light, and it made Sherlock’s movements all the more dizzying to watch.
“I’d hardly say I ‘sneaked,’” Sherlock snorted and then removed one of his hands from beneath his head to motion with idly, flicking his wrist in a dismissive gesticulation as he continued, “Must I have a reason? What does it matter? – And though your bed is quite… minute, I prefer it most nights.”
"Shit, stop, Sherl," John warned, as his blue eyes focussed on something over the detective's shoulder. Sherlock immediately froze, worry clawing at him over whatever it was that had made John so uncomfortable.
- I'm almost...there." John pleaded and Sherlock, spurred on, began jerking at his cock harshly, fast and hard, and John shrieked as he suddenly came, his orgasm being forced almost painfully from him.
John had been studying something blurry on the wall, before catching Greg's voice and turning to listen. His body had been turned at an angle that allowed him to be completely unaware of the figure that slid from a nearby booth, a rustle of black material in his wake.
John frowned slightly at the enigmatic words (Sherlock had never offered this particular benevolent statement before), before the line went dead, and he was left with an unsettling sense of dread, sitting alone in his office, the storm's fury finally surrendering to stillness with a few aborted spatters of cold rain against his office window.
He'd caught glimpses all morning of the staff clustered together, in groups of twos and threes, outside his door as he greeted his patients, and John knew he was being irrational to suspect they were talking about him but…
He sighed, remembering all sorts of taunts and murmurs at school- how bony he looked, pale and fleshy like a fish, skinny as an eel. Ribs and jutting hipbones and smooth skin that never seemed to grow hair except on his calves and around his cock and balls. Sherlock shivered in the cool air of the room, quickly shucking off his pants and fumbling his way into the tiny briefs with shaking fingers, hoping he wouldn't open his eyes and find disgust or worse, amusement written on John's face.
He heard the no-nonsense whisper of supple leather being pulled through khaki belt loops behind him, and grinned to himself. This was going to be
Even as John gritted his teeth, his expression clouding frighteningly, Sherlock appeared to calm suddenly, and raised a long, pale hand for silence. Remarkably, silence fell, and all eyes were on him.
Sherlock blinked bleary eyes, groaning indistinctly before he gritted his teeth and shakily dragged the clinical sheets higher up his near-nude body.
Chewing the inside on his mouth and feeling a cold sweat breaking out on his skin, feeling as if everyone were staring at him, John burst into his office with as much professionalism as one enraged ex-soldier could manage. He collapsed into the chair behind his desk and, hesitating a brief moment, picked up the phone, pressing the flashing light which indicated he had a call waiting.
Sherlock cleared his throat, blushing a little under Mrs. Watson's praise. "Please, excuse me one moment so that I may introduce myself properly," He said graciously, removing his coat, placing it on the back of his chair, and then extending his hand to John's mother. She blushed and tittered as they shook hands and gave her son a cheeky, approving smile as Sherlock shook hands with Mr. Watson.
John smiled at his breathless anticipation, kneeling up and steadying himself between Sherlock's legs, placing the head of his cock at Sherlock's entrance.
"Course you did." John blithely replied, raising up and pulling a face at the slick amalgamation of come and olive oil on his crotch. "Think I'm for a shower." He gave Sherlock a suggestive smile. "Want to join me?"
, Sherlock. Then just drink to..." John gesticulated in frustration as he tried to think of something, "...Our engagement," he suggested, pointing at the naff cracker ring on the taller man's finger.
It was a lazy, drizzly morning and Sherlock, hunched over the kitchen table, a brutally-sharp scalpel gripped surely and knowledgeably between fingers and thumb, latex gloves covering his long, pale hands, muttered to himself as he peered into his high-powered microscope.
"Sherlock..." John took a step forward, then another, guilt lancing through him. He hadn't meant to hurt Sherlock by not inviting him along. He hadn't. He'd just honestly not thought his partner would want to come to a boring lunch with his parents. It didn't seem the sort of thing Sherlock Holmes would enjoy. He should have still asked though, John realized, watching his beautiful love saw away at his violin, his face turned away, the upset wobble of his voice still playing through John's mind.
Seeing the little slip of fabric in Sherlock's hands made John's heart race, his throat go dry, and his prick made a truly heroic effort at trying to get hard. Sherlock twirled the white briefs casually around one finger, unable to restrain a self-satisfied grin as he saw John's reaction.
John's eyes softened predictably and his lips went a little less pinched. "Sherlock..." He reached down and grasping Sherlock's hand in his. "I'm not mad. Well, actually, yes I am mad but...I'll get over it. And listen, just because I was with him doesn't mean I still want to be. Okay? I want to be with you. I'm fucking stunned that I'm with you, all right? Stop being jealous of the past."
John was too busy starting to try and grind down upon his lover's stiff cock in such a way that would do more than just frustrate him to notice.
"Get off, prick," John instructed fondly, defending his crown and cracker. "Let me have this one thing. It only happens once a year."
"...I still have to do it. Or I can't do my job. And then I'll have to work in Tesco's. And you know I'm not even allowed in there any more after all that shoplifting."
give me ten minutes to recuperate. You must need it too?" he asked, before lavishing a few selfish smooches upon Sherlock's damp, white, throat.
John frowned, sighed, then capitulated, throwing the covers back over his overgrown child and ordering room service for tea and breakfast. By the time he got out of the shower, packed both their bags, and thanked the bell hop for the food, he judged it was more than time to get Sherlock up. He dry-swallowed his prescribed painkillers from the bottle in the bathroom, and approached the indolent brunette.
"…Hang on...why is it with...these things?" Sherlock flicked his hand disdainfully at the large green sign that highlighted the 'Fruit' special offers section, his brow crinkling in confusion. He glanced around, looking for an employee. "They're stocking their products incorrectly. Pineapple isn't a fruit...someone should get reprimanded."
"What?" John asked, pulling away and Sherlock yanked at him again, sending John sprawling on top of him on hands and knees.
Heart still racing, John fumbled for the bedside lamp, flicking it on and squinting against the sudden flood of light. He swiped at his forehead as another icy drop snaked its way down his face and he glanced up at his ceiling.
"No, I'm not." John agreed. "But I can't wait to get used to it." He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively. "Now. We're going to this thing and you need a haircut. So, come on." He slapped Sherlock's knee encouragingly. "Let's get going."
Swirling her index and middle finger in a practised rhythm she had perfected when she was thirteen, Molly shifted on her bed, close to a climax but holding out as long as she could, wanting to hear more.
"Well, that's understandable considering I haven't had a shag in ten months. Mostly due to you. What can I say, I'm craving intimacy," John snorted, eyes closed and feeling less sleepy, but still relaxed. "And if you insist on staying here, don't complain if you get molested."
Sherlock experienced some qualms about number two. The idea of removing his clothes made his stomach knot up and a dreadful nervousness threatened to quench his arousal. But John
John, stretched out on the bed, just laughed, enjoying the view of Sherlock, pale and nude, rifling through his wardrobe.
," Sherlock said almost inaudibly, scowling in frustration. "Want to see what..." he paused, and cleared his throat, shuffling slightly on the rumpled bed. “What your second orgasm looks like.”
He briefly thought back to previous instances of various animals rescued, injured, from crime scenes, orphaned in murder victim’s houses and in one case, sequestered from a man who had been smuggling small diamonds injected under the skin of bearded dragons.  They had been fostered in 221B before being suitably moved on to new owners.
"I- that's..." Sherlock shook his head, looking stunned and confused, adorable with his hair mussed and eyes wide. He glanced shyly at the table then back at John, his cheeks slowly reddening with color.
“OKay...okay, let's...I'm ready. I'm so ready," John laughed. "Christ Sherlock, where do you want to do it?"
"Oh...oh god." John shuddered, easing his hand away from his twitching cock carefully. He blinked at the sight of Sherlock, face literally dripping with come, his shirt striped with it. His eyelashes were clumped together with thin strands of come and his lips, which Sherlock was sucking on, had been totally slicked. "Wow." John traced his fingers through the mess. "That's...quite a bit."
memorizing those' trite, ridiculous pornographic' phrases John had obviously loved masturbating to...and apparently it'd all been for nothing?
"Of course you're not having one." Sherlock rumbled out, turning away from John as his fingers hammered away at various password attempts. "You're planning dates with two different women this month. You're too nice to tell me straight...not even in a cute 'heart-to-heart' in the bedroom of your spurned, irrational, flatmate who you assumed was asexual. You'll try to pretend as if nothing has changed between us but of course it will. It already has. Your attempts will pain us both and be horribly awkward. You'll give notice to leave the flat in two weeks, which you deem to be a reasonable and polite timescale. 'Sherlock's just'...oh." He muttered. His fingers had unconsciously tapped in one of the words he had been speaking, and John's desktop flashed open for him.
Sherlock pressed closer to the door, wondering what Melissa was saying, breath coming in short little puffs as he strained to hear.
Sherlock sighed, his breath ruffling through the small, short hairs at John’s nape, “You can’t see, but I’m rolling my eyes at you,” he mumbled.
Sherlock blinked and found himself stumbling barefoot over a painful, awkward, and overly-colourful stack of Lego Bricks in his Mind Palace. He frantically tried to remember what John was talking about, running over everything they'd said in the past few hours, all the while feeling John pulling away from him.
it..." John struggled to hold down his partner's powerfully bucking hips, afraid he'd hurt himself if he gained too much leverage as he fucked himself on the large toy. "Come on. Come all over me," he ordered breathlessly.
He trailed behind Sherlock to where Lestrade was waiting for them near the back of the shop, looking tense and worried, but relieved when he spied them.  "Where the hell have you two been? I expected you here an hour ago!"
"Look at the mess you made, you gorgeous thing," he murmured while Sherlock shuddered, breathing a sigh that gusted against John's neck.
"Used to what?" John mumbled against Sherlock's shoulder, his lips tickling and the sensation was so odd and arousing Sherlock filed it away for exploration later.
"I'll make it feel good for you. So fucking good." He licked his lips and John watched the motion with bated breath. He glanced behind him, checking to see they were still alone and then, before he lost his nerve, stepped closer to Shaun and tentatively reached out to touch his hard prick.
“Sorry,” John offered sheepishly, hoping he hadn’t pushed too far, though unable to extinguish the secret smug thrill that maybe he had.
"Mm." John licked at the still-tingling place on his neck before traversing lower, fingers tracing around Sherlock's nipples which stood out in stark contrast on his chest, twin points of colour on an otherwise pale landscape.
He frowned, confused, when John chuckled and grabbed hold of him for a deep, endorphin- and love-fuelled snog. The ashen-haired doctor pulled back after the dizzying contact, and grinned.
John ran the back of his hand across his forehead, blowing out a sharp exhale and squinting his eyes at the setting sun, which was an eye-watering, dizzyingly hot fireball. The occasional gusts of air that swirled around him were warm and offered little respite as he and Sherlock entered the ornate gates of the park.
Sherlock scooped a long hand, still hinting at debilitation, through his impossibly-mussed curls. He sagged in a feeble, lanky exhibition in his own armchair, eyes watering in the golden evening sun.
Speedy’s muffins are very nice…be sure to grab one if you’re ever on a Sherlock pilgrimage XD (and make sure you pay for it! ;) ) And the fairy thing is real :3
"Because I fucking love it, when you say things- especially like that- but right now I really want to get off again. I've waited god knows how many weeks so if you'll just-" John broke off, gasping, when Sherlock abruptly shoved a finger into his arse, slick with lube.
"Tex - Text me...place, time," John seethed, flinging his phone away, hearing it bang unhealthily against the wardrobe, before he yanked at Sherlock's beautiful, glossy black curls.
John's eyebrow rose and fuck it, that shouldn't have been arousing. Sherlock was still angry. He knew he was and that he had every right to be. He just…couldn't remember…. He rooted around in his mind for the tendrils of righteous anger which were trying to elude him. "You didn't tell your co-workers about us." Ah, that was it.
"Tell mum I'm on my way. There's no reason for her to worry...Yeah, I'm walking to the restaurant... No, I don't think I'll get mugged...Yeah-...No, I don't think he's coming. Mhm. Ok- yeah, dad- yeah- ok-…See you soon." John hung up, sighing, and turned back to Sherlock. "That was-"
"You really are far more dense than I imagined," Sherlock uttered in a deep voice made of smoke and threat. "John must have been under some kind of impressive hypnotism to ever see you as a valid partner."
," Sherlock seethed in a delectable deep voice that made the curse sound doubly sinful. His imperfect teeth gritting, his pale aquamarine eyes struggling to stay open, Sherlock yanked needily at John's ashen hair. "Need y- up here," he heaved.
Hearing the main door close, Sherlock cracked open the bathroom door and frowned indignantly out into the empty, chilly flat.
He also knew by now that John had a considerable and far-ranging desperation kink, and one he was more than happy to exploit. With the added factor of the one-month anniversary, Sherlock was satisfied that there was a better-than-80% chance of success. If it
John eyed the reddened, hard cock between Sherlock's legs, fluid dripping copiously from the tip, and his tongue snaked out, clenched between his teeth. "Get yourself off." He instructed, groping for Sherlock's hand and placing it on the throbbing erection.
Shaun nodded again, grunting, and pushed back carefully against John's hand. "Shaun-" John stopped him and Shaun whined high in his throat, reaching beneath him to start frantically tugging at his cock.
Sherlock swallowed nervously, nodding. "I'll just...just go put them on in the loo..." He started edging towards the door but John stopped him, crawling to the edge of the bed.
John was still agitatedly looking for the lost cookie and Sherlock wrapped himself around John's smaller frame, resting his chin on John's head. "Come back to bed? "
He opened his eyes, staring at John's sleeping form laid out on the bed, still and quiet and unaware of what Sherlock was doing. For how much longer? How much time did he have before John woke? He had to finish this- now- before John came awake.
"You were eavesdropping?" asked the doctor dumbly, a hint of confusion marred by the awkward tension still clinging on the air. "What are you talking about?"
By the time he had located the man in question- a gay Irish brunette in his late thirties- and started trawling through every Facebook profile detail and post, John was back. He distantly heard his questioning voice.
He still couldn't resist peering one eye down at his own chest and abdomen, despite the knowledge that he hadn't been penetrated by a bullet. He attempted to glance upwards, towards his saviour, but was blind-sided by the image of his captor's arterial blood pulsing out over his crotch, drenching his underwear, a deathly-pale head smacking lifelessly down upon his thighs.
Downstairs, Mrs. Hudson grinned indulgently as she recalled the heart attack that she had nearly suffered yesterday morning when a fully-dressed Sherlock had flown recklessly down the stairs, wide-eyed, stricken, looking more colourless than usual, panting and shaking violently. Careening into her as she was heading out the front door, nearly knocking her to the pavement, he had seized her upper arms in a crushing grip and yelled “MRS.HUDSON!” in her face, practically deafening her. Passers-by had paused to stare, and got ready to dial 999 if need be.
John let himself admire the view because honestly, if he thought he looked like a walking knob in his tuxedo...Sherlock looked fucking gorgeous. His tux was exquisitely tailored, tight at his arse and highlighting how long his legs were. John licked his lips, gazing at that plump swell swaying, until guests moved in front of him, obstructing his view.
The doctor shrugged off his jacket briskly and removed his shoes, his practically-ingrained, discontented frown marking his forehead. Opening the door to 221B, adrenaline pulsing encouragingly through his veins, teeth clenched in anticipation of a fight, John strode boldly into the living room.
Toby the cat followed John to the table and yowled at his feet, demanding attention. John gave it a few pats on the head before he settled beside Sherlock.
Sherlock gave John a venomous glare and stalked away, aware of the smaller man striding along behind him. He knew John was staring at the assembled people, probably playing some perverse game trying to decide who he would fuck. He strode up to the manager of the spa, frowning irritably and the man wilted under his gaze.
"Deep breath," John smiled, smoothly pushing inside his partner with his finger, twisting slightly from side to side to gain more territory within the other man, red-hot, crushingly-tight, and pulsing tellingly.
He was still sitting there, eyes swimming from the pain, when Sherlock pushed his way into the room, a nurse flapping behind him, looking very put-out. Sherlock's eyes immediately found John's and his worried face softened.
Shaun stood, downing his raspberry-flavoured shot without the faintest acknowledgement of its’ taste, and watched as his ex began to ease his boyfriend from the booth, John’s dark eyes tellingly hungry.
was a situation John had never been in, and he was blown away by how much it turned him on, having no anchor, no way to ground his pleasure, focussing on staying upright whilst his orgasm roared to be released. He had always been vocal, and now the panic that the other guys would hear him coming explosively down his mates' throat, nearly did him in.
“Thank you,” Sherlock mumbled and took some time ruffling the fabric against his body with a soft rustling. Once he was done, John heard him throw the trousers to the ground and then he turned, gathering John up against him with a satisfied exhale through his nose, fitting and slotting himself against John with winding arms and legs. He was still trembling and scorching hot, like a shaking human-shaped water bottle, and John smoothed one hand across Sherlock's forehead, displacing his damp curls, and blew cool, gentle breaths over the burning skin.
John had still chosen his own hand over anything Sherlock had to offer, no matter how much he desired him.
"Yeah, thanks." John quipped, taking a deep breath and whooshing it out agitatedly. "Look, I don't want to rush into this and make mistakes because ten years from now I don't want us to regret anything."
,” Sherlock complained, pushing his mouth to John’s jaw and neck, stroking and then awkwardly patting John’s bare shoulder.
, John." Sherlock gave him an imploring look. "I've fantasized about this for so long..." He let his breath start coming faster and licked at his lips. Predictably, John's eyes dropped to follow the motion and Sherlock knew he had him.
“Yeah, ‘oh,’” John grinned reassuringly, before cupping a hand behind Sherlock’s head and pulling him down gently, but firmly, into a kiss. His other hand settled on Sherlock’s hip, and the resultant muffled “Mph!” of revelation from the taller man was glorious.
John nodded and Sherlock crumpled. He buried his face in John's neck, breaths quick and agitated against his skin.
Sherlock, leaning against John, made himself force a rather strangled sounding laugh, sniffing a bit but managing to shore himself up under John's playful banter. When he felt he'd got himself under control, he pulled away and gave John his best arrogant look. "You left without cooking me breakfast, John. You may go ahead and do that while I shower. I want scrambled eggs and toast. Oh. And tea."
Sherlock's arms relinquished their potential strength and he sagged against the mattress, relenting in John's strong grip and shivering with the implications of what John was about to do. John had only gone down on him a couple of times, not recently, and he had always pulled off before Sherlock climaxed, licking his lips and using his fist to finish Sherlock off, never swallowing, or even coming close to doing so. Sherlock still nurtured a fantasy of John deep-throating him and ingesting everything he had to give – and his damp forehead crinkled tellingly as he vividly imagined John sucking him off and savouring every musky spurt.
," Sherlock murmured, gulping a few times as he swivelled his hips harder, making a few tentative bounces, his mouth falling open wide, eyes still closed. "Gonna ride you...so hard," he wheezed, looking indescribably aroused.
"If," John said, before surrendering to helpless giggles. "...If you want me to give a scientific report on everything that I felt after that experience...it's fine. But
"I would love to lick your anus properly. I've read the opening is particularly sensitive and I would enjoy experimenting to see if yours is the same." His own muscles bunched as his mind helpfully supplied a visual of him doing just that- placing John's legs over his shoulders, spreading his arse, and licking-
John bit his bottom lip and halted for a second, gasping inelegantly, his eyes still tightly closed. "Don't want to come too soon." He admitted, panting. A stab of envy went through Sherlock's chest at John's self-control and he glared up at the other man, trying to read what was doing through his mind from the little twitches in his face.
John's brow furrowed tellingly, and he halted abruptly, stalling hard enough to cause Sherlock to emit a faint, adorable noise of protest as he was pulled back against his steadfast doctor.
"Of course I didn't post the photo." Sherlock scoffed. "No one else gets to know what your face looks like when you orgasm.
Sherlock remained unmoving and silent for a long few moments, almost long enough for sleep to begin to claw at the edges of John’s mind, and then he stroked down John’s neck, along his shoulder, and down his arm with a hot-palmed swipe, “I’m not uncomfortable,” he said in a husky whisper, his chin nudging John as he leaned over him. “Fine. I might know what you’re talking about. – I want you to say it. Sometimes you…surprise me. I don’t read minds. There’s always something I overlook…”
"You mean besides the overpowering smell of bleach in the hallway as we passed 202 where the most recent murder took place? And the low rate for the rooms? The staff are all new, most people don't like working in a hotel riddled with murders." Sherlock closed the door behind them and took in their room with a disgusted expression. "None of the murders have been very inspiring. Nothing interesting."
His hands moved to his shirt collar, pulling it down before bringing it back up. His thumbs caressed the edges, mimicking the movements of John's fingers. The past month, John had seemingly gotten more comfortable with shows of affection. He would grab Sherlock by the collar and pull him forward for a kiss.
"...What are you waiting for," he murmured with ostensible indifference, watching John dust the mantelpiece with revealingly-dilated eyes and tense muscles. He was tempted to throw off the blanket and relinquish his naked body to John's attentions…but it was simply too cold.
This time, it was John's turn to whine, rubbing at himself where he was hard and throbbing. "I'd suck you." He said, without preamble. "I'd take your lovely, hot, wet cock in my mouth and suck you. Make your eyes roll back in your fucking head. Take you as deep as I could. You're already so loose...I can
"Stop right there, Sherlock." John said sternly, pulling away and giving Sherlock his best no-nonsense frown. "I don't want you to be 'grateful' for me...putting up with you. I love you. You're a mad, impossible man who..." John smiled fondly. "...who does ridiculous things to get angry, rough sex when he could just ask...who wants to monopolize all my time and- as much as I complain about it-I'm flattered. It's...incredible...sometimes when I think about how much you love me." He cleared his throat uncomfortably and gave Sherlock another stern look. "So no more talking about being grateful, you idiot. If you want to tell me you love me...tell me that and leave out all the rest. Ok?"
"J-John..." He panted, all rational thought gone, the heavy thickness of arousal stunning in its ability to strip away all his reserve and higher intelligence. "P-Please..."
"Look...I'm in bed...getting a massage from..." The doctor abruptly shut his mouth with a click before trying again. "I'm sensitive anyway, and it was bad enough in the clinic, but this is really going to cause problems. The 'molesting' won't be a joke anymore."
"Hello, you," John chuckled infectiously, squeezing his arms lovingly around Sherlock's firm torso. "...You know, you're alright."
“Ignore her. Stay here?" the taller man asked, his sweet smile tainted with the garish purple bruises decorating his face.
He was currently searching for a tiny poison-dart frog that he had acquired and clearly underestimated in terms of its dexterity and decampment, and now, its ability to go into hiding in their cluttered living room.
John double-checked the photo himself, ensuring they hadn't overlooked any tell-tale...bodily releases which may have been missed in the clean-up. Satisfied, he grinned. It was a surprisingly good photo - both of them visibly bare from torso up and looking more than a little bit shagged-out, but not explicitly so.
"And a double chocolate muffin. Let's go outside to eat, though. Too busy in here." Sherlock said, raising his voice above the clamour of the packed-out coffee shop. He strode outside, leaving John to deal with the banalities of ordering. After making a man leave one of the highly coveted tables by deducing his infidelity and affinity for furry pornography, Sherlock sat himself smugly down. Checking to make sure John wasn't on his way, he whipped out his mobile and began searching for Shaun Morris.
John grinned his wide, bright grin and stood, pushing aside the plate and taking his detective gently by the hips. “Alright, enough messing around. I’m ready to take you apart in the best way imaginable. You ready?”
"Beautiful." John breathed, scooting closer to Sherlock and bending his head, pressing a sucking kiss to the center of his chest.
Sherlock rolled his eyes a little, “I won’t,” he told him, leading him to the bed and then pushing him down on it.
Sherlock’s face crumpled in dissatisfaction and he continued speedily, trying to express himself. “That…sounded bad, but it’s not. Not entirely. Not
." Sherlock breathed, his heart skipping a beat and the beginnings of desire starting to pool low in his gut. He moved back to the bed and knelt beside his grinning lover, his hands hovering over the sheet, watching the enticing flex of John's cock through the fabric…before he drew away, frowning. "Are you sure we have time for this?"
"Um...look, Sherl...can I just...since you've got to clean up anyway...just..." he trailed off, before gently coercing the brunette once more against the wall, and prodding himself questioningly against the plump, white backside in front of him.
"Fine." He said curtly, not returning Sherlock's attempted hug, instead reaching for a knife to cut through his bonds. "Come on. We're getting out of here. Mycroft's arranged the helicopter to meet us on the roof."
"I'm not sure, Watson." The nurse dismissed the question as he adjusted something on one of the machines attached to John. "You need to calm down."
"I...don't know," John answered honestly, with a brief shrug. "Every time I started considering it, I forced the idea away," he murmured, avoiding Sherlock's gaze.
"He..he's always been very p-professional...oh, John." Sherlock's fingers dug into John's arm, gripping it as he panted as quietly as he could. His hips stuttered into John's hand and John watched his eyes darken.
"I don't want any cookies." Sherlock pouted as John grabbed the mug and offered them to him. John's face fell, though, and Sherlock felt guilty so he plucked one of the few remaining ones. " ‘You're gorgeous even when you're pouting.’"  Sherlock read. "Very clever."
"Shit!" Sherlock suddenly spat, eyes tightly-closed. He had painfully snapped a nail from scrabbling along the grimy top wall of the flimsy cubicle whilst seeking much-needed bodily support. "...
"Are you all right?" John asked worriedly, patting Sherlock firmly on the back as the other man's eyes watered and he struggled for air. Sherlock nodded shakily, still coughing around the constriction in his chest, and gave John a watery, tentative look.
Sherlock gasped sharply, his hips bucking up at the contact, needing more. He'd been needing more all afternoon, unsuccessfully trying to get himself off with John's mobile and his own hand, both paltry and useless devices which had done no more than tease him mercilessly. They had been unable to bring him the relief he craved, the relief that he
." Sherlock rumbled. "I like it. You can tell we're naked and in bed..." He trailed off, eyes raking over the picture again, committing it to memory.
John sighed at the sound of the door banging shut and shrugged on a slightly crumpled dark blue shirt and black jeans. He crouched to look in the fingerprinted mirror on the dresser and ran his fingers through his hair which was drying into short spikes. He gave it a cursory judgement, shaking his head. It'd have to do for now. Grabbing his wallet and phone, he leaned against the wall outside the bathroom, and waited.
"Mm. Sort it in the morning." Sherlock slurred, sighing happily as he sank back onto his pillow, hugging it dreamily, exhaling gustily.
The two men dropped the phone, grabbing at their guns and spinning around toward the source of the noise.
John glanced down as Sherlock let out a long, pained wail, but the detective hadn't come, he was just reaching a state of delirium, so much so that he was almost laughing in between wet hisses of sex-scented air and guttural, deep-toned growls.
That was more than enough. With a high-pitched, anguished growl, John bucked hard, squeezing crushingly-tight around Sherlock's finger as he came, squirting the taller man's already-wet stomach with pearls of hot ejaculate. With a gruff, pleased-sounding grunt deep in his chest, Sherlock moved his mouth to John’s and breathed against him, as if sharing in the moment with John, before he kissed him affectionately, stroking him through his orgasm with a flex of his trapped finger and a swipe of his other hand, drawing it up John’s back.
Wordlessly, John turned to face him, splaying one hand upon Sherlock's belly, whilst the other braced him on luxurious white pillows. He gave him a few small, quick kisses, pulling back each time to enjoy the dizziness in Sherlock's grey-green eyes, though rapidly the kisses became longer, harder, and noisier. It was addicting, like the man himself. John had been addicted from the start.
Sherlock fixed him with a devastating stare that managed to be blatantly lustful, and yet construed by normal people as an innocent expression. "Don't worry, you'll have something to drink."
"You've forgot about me." Sherlock said childishly from his position on the floor. "After being so cruelly and thoroughly ravaged by my doctor, he heartlessly abandons me in my hour of need." He opined, tossing the now disgusting flannel across the room without a care as to where it landed. John could pick it up later.
“…So…good,” John murmured, groggy with oxytocin, whimpering faintly as the detective strongly, intuitively, thumbed a few tough knots at the base of his neck. “
"It's not our anniversary." Sherlock said, hoping he was right, worried he'd missed a major milestone and John would be angry. "...Is it?" He asked uncertainly, looking down at himself, naked under his damp, soapy-smelling dressing gown. John, he belatedly noticed, was wearing one of his best shirts, the red one, and new dark, well-fitting jeans. His eyes unfocussed and his lips moved unconsciously as he rummaged frantically through his Mind Palace documents relating to important dates.
Sherlock nodded, and John inadvertently felt the slight ribbing of the roof of the detective's mouth against his sensitive tip, and a sharp pulse of pleasure caused his left hand to move reflexively towards the mantelpiece. He hissed again, cursing.
"...Yeah." John agreed, deciding not to let him know it'd been a near thing. He'd wait until another time to tell Sherlock not to let go so quickly and actually finish him before stopping. "You did...good."
“You exist everywhere inside my Mind Palace. Sometimes I can see where you’ve been by…a signature. A little scribble that denotes where you’ve been trespassing during my dreams.”
"I was just trying to...lessen your discomfort later. I've already seen from my reconnaissance of the kitchen that Molly's out of oil."
Shaun let out a short, awkward noise, bit his lip, and then sucked in a quick breath, his slick and forceful hips not halting in their assault. Blinking sweat from his dark eyes, he hissed, "Let me do this."
"M-move. Just...Jesus. Move." John gasped, shocked, when Sherlock dragged his penis out of his arse, sliding it slickly from his passage until only the head was breaching him.
His eyes, wide and pale and fearful, flickered over the older man who was now grinding disgustingly against him, deductions screaming spontaneously into his head.
Sherlock grinned at her and John, if he had been looking, would have known what was coming. As it was, he continued on blithely eating, not aware.
." John gestured at Sherlock, eyes doing a quick glance up and down his body- making Sherlock’s skin flush hot all over- before snapping to attention again. A comically-bemused expression crinkled Sherlock's features as he silently questioned John's implication. It might have been sexual, but...it was hard to say.
the fun stuff in between actually becoming a couple and breaking up?” The suggestiveness was subtle yet deafening.
He sped up the movements of his hand on John's cock, repeatedly swiping his thumb over the tip in an effort to make him come quicker, but the convulsive clench of John's body around his cock, an exquisite, rare sensation, coupled with the punishing pace Sherlock had set up, was his undoing. He teetered on the cusp of his orgasm for a few breathless seconds, valiantly trying to stall it, just for a few more seconds, just until John came-
"Oh...oh," Sherlock managed, slack-jawed in a way that would be highly unattractive in anyone else. He pushed his hips up, cock throbbing in protest at the tightness of John’s arse.
With a muffled laugh, Sherlock wove his arms back around him, kissing John contentedly, “I rather think that was the
The other guys at the sticky table had quietened warily to listen to the conversation at hand, aware of John's short fuse when something really riled him.
He was surprised when he was approached with Shaun's customary cheeky grin and knowing, smiling eyes an hour later. It would seem that Shaun himself hadn't gotten off from his encounter with Wilkins and he was obviously looking for John to help him out.
The shuddery, ecstatic groan of delight that rumbled into John's mouth was almost enough to send him over the edge again. After Sherlock had assaulted John's mouth briefly, but very thoroughly - saliva decorating both of their jaws, lips sore, and faces tingling with the birth of stubble rash, the detective pulled back, breathless. Panting a few wet necessary inhales, Sherlock tried again. "John what is it? Tell me. Need to know," he wheezed.
"It's pre-ejaculate, John. I would've thought, as a doctor, you'd have known that." Sherlock replied, his voice still deep and groggy, eyes drooping visibly even from across the room.
"You don't think about what? Sex? You're kidding, we've got the best part of an afternoon in front of us,” he said, gesturing at the bar. “I'm sure you could still manage a bit of police brutality in the bedroom."
John stared up at Sherlock, speechless in his horror and anger, and his father, flushed very red, looked on the verge of an apoplectic fit. Only Mrs. Watson seemed to recover enough to say haltingly-
"Ignore them. They can't see us. Sounds like they're too preoccupied...racking up ASBOs...they'll catch up with you soon." He added teasingly, giving John a quick smooch under his ear, finding himself quite enjoying this 'public display of affection' business.
He felt his orgasm looming, his testicles drawing tighter to his body, and John gave a few more hard thrusts before coming.
"Give me a few minutes and I'll...do whatever the hell you want." John promised, chest heaving, looking almost giddy with pleasure.
close," he illustrated, holding his finger and thumb a little apart. "One or two more inches would literally have been enough."
"I..." Sherlock cleared his throat nervously, musician's fingers twiddling with his silverware, making the spoon and fork clink and chime together loudly. "A...a..." Sherlock brought one hand up to toy with his bottom lip and John's eyes jumped down to the movement. He smiled in understanding.
"How long do you want to breathe for?" John was already unzipping himself gratefully, his skin burning with both the heat of the desert, and the heat of a vicious attraction he hardly dared to contemplate. Shaun moaned, dropping down further and opening himself up to John.
The gesture was like a spear through Sherlock's heart. He was very much aware of the fact that, were it not for him, John would still be well. Healed. He wouldn't have almost bled out while being operated on because he wouldn't have been stabbed in the first place. Sherlock let John hold his hand until the doors opened onto their floor.
"What, no stir-fry?" Sherlock replied flippantly, letting out an exaggerated, bored sigh. His gaze had already flickered around the featureless room, and had seen no evidence of bladed weapons as yet - the assaults had been purely manual. He subtly continued trying to stretch the tough leather bonds that were currently tethering him, kneeling, to four sturdy rings in the gritty floor.
Sherlock altered his weight and stroked along his back comfortingly, taking a deep breath before he spoke, “A while,” he replied.
Sherlock's eyes flared and he bit his bottom lip fiendishly. Drawing back his hand, he delivered a short, sharp slap directly on John's erection.
The detective stared at him, perplexed, for a few seconds, but John interrupted him before he could dig himself any deeper.
That startled a chuckle out of John and he tapped Sherlock's cheek affectionately. "Yeah, we did, didn’t we? And it was great too."
"Few times." Shaun grunted. "Been wanting to bugger you for bloody weeks." He added another finger and John's body, relaxed from too much alcohol, easily opened to accommodate him.
"No, I...yes," Sherlock rushed to explain. "...I'm just a bit...not as good as you." He muttered, in what John thought was probably the most cringe-worthy, yet adorable thing he had ever heard in bed.
Recuperating somewhat, John’s eyes softened and Sherlock’s deep-crinkled grin eased into a sweet smile.
"Everything alright?" he asked after watched Greg's face crease in concentration as he tapped something out on his sleek device.
…" John sped up his thrusts as he felt Sherlock's muscles begin fluttering around him, knowing the other man was close, the knowledge making the arousal in his own body coil tighter, spark and flare.
He had to admit that he really wasn't quite in 'case-solving' mode at the moment, but couldn't quite bring himself to feel guilty about it. He felt giddy, high with an addictive cocktail of pride, lust, and adoration.
"John, you're lucky I love you," Sherlock uttered, his pale brow crinkling beautifully. "Are you intending to finish me off? If you're planning to tease for the next few minutes, know that I will forsake physiological pleasure in favour of mental invigoration. By that, I mean The Work."
!" He broke off at the first crack of John's hand against his arse, brought down hard and without remorse, leaving behind a sharp, stinging which made him gasp. John smiled at the sight of Sherlock's pale skin reddening and, keeping his hand firmly fixed in the middle of Sherlock's back, holding him down as he swung again, he channelled his indignant, righteous anger into his hand and wrist. He pulled back a little more, before whacking Sherlock's arse again, the ringing smack loud in the mid-afternoon gloomy silence of the flat.
Sherlock gasped in relief with each protracted, bone-deep contraction of his orgasm. It seemed to go on and on and on deliciously, aided by the toy which was still vibrating powerfully in his arse. He tried to savour the feeling of release and luxuriate in his hard-won orgasm, but the vibrations became too much and Sherlock twisted, writhing against the bed in a futile effort to get away from the sensation.
John mentally thanked god that he had the day off. Five in the morning was no decent time to be forced into wakefulness by your intransigent lover. He instinctively rubbed his left shoulder, which was healing remarkably quickly, his arm working almost at full strength, though it twinged sharply with pain every now and then- and focused back to the problem at hand.
"God...that was bad…sorry, mate." The tumult of conflicting emotions showed very openly on John's face as he rummaged through Sherlock's short curls apologetically. Sherlock grimaced at the use of the word 'mate' again, and while John distracted himself with needless apologies, he took him into his mouth again, sucking submissively.
Pacing through the sitting room, muttering to himself, a glimpse of a rusty-red specimen under the coffee table caught his eye and Sherlock paused to investigate. He dropped to his knees and fished the thing out, frowning when he realized what it was.
"Yeah, I would have thought my pounding on your leg was saying something." John groused, standing from the bed and wiping at his chin disgustedly.
"W-well. That's certainly...I'm glad the two of you are together now." Molly stuttered, pushing her eggs around her plate to keep from looking at the two men.
Momentarily stunned, John watched his partner disappear into the perpetual gloom of their flat, and then watched as the cat (now that he looked at it properly, it
"Can I put my mouth on you?" John asked, eyes darkened and pulse noticeably elevated, but maintaining impressive composure.
John spent a few seconds panting, staring blindly up at Sherlock's prick while his own was treated to a wonderful, fantastic blow job. When Sherlock huffed around his cock, John recovered, realizing he was being an inattentive slug, and strained his neck upward, sucking Sherlock's cock into his mouth.
Rolling up his shirt sleeves and blowing away a thick curl from his forehead, Sherlock scooted closer to John on their bench. He licked away a bead of sweat from the dent of his top lip and watched as the young family near the edge of the lake began to pack and make their way back to the park gates.
John hesitated outside the door of 221, glancing up at the windows which were, for the time being, empty and devoid of stroppy consulting detectives surveying their domain. For the first time in a long time, John wasn't really looking forward to going inside the flat. He knew Sherlock was waiting for him, still angry about this morning, and ready to fight with him.
Sherlock was led back to the bedroom, where he furtively inhaled, taking in the pungent and mouth-watering particles of sex in the air, something that wasn't noticeable until you had left the room and encountered air untainted by pleasure. "...What are you going to do to me?" he asked in an unholy baritone, a childish intonation made fiendish by a grown-man's voice.
John smiled down at Sherlock. "I think you've still got one more in you, don't you, love? Think you can stand another?"
“Mrs. Hudson, I told you to leave ages ago, why won’t you,” he drawled irritably over his dressing-gown clad shoulder, voice strained.
The vicious grip that Sherlock’s large hands had on John’s backside tightened into actual pain, but he didn’t dare cease or even slow his eager invasion of Sherlock’s blood-hot, delightfully wet and responsive mouth. He was ignited even further when the detective started pumping his hips optimistically against John’s stomach, sucking sloppily on John’s tongue, making deliriously arousing noises. He was
"Why don't we...try something else? Ok? I don't want to hurt you. Not...not when I can pleasure you instead." John offered, awkwardly. "That is, if the 'uninspiring' murders of this particular venue haven't killed your mood entirely."
Embarrassment swamped over him, stealing the glow from his post orgasmic state and making him feel foolish. He sucked in a few much-needed inhales, then, after the obvious aftershocks had left his shivery muscles, he pulled himself upright with tremulous arms, and a loud grunt, back onto his armchair.
Sherlock listened as John rustled around at the coat rack on the opposite wall, trying to deduce what he was doing- and nearly jumped when something soft touched his face. Fabric. Small. Narrow. A tie. He allowed John to wrap it around his eyes and knot it, careful not to get Sherlock's curls caught up.
Sherlock blinked. Derailed. "Wh-what?" Did that mean bloodplay? He wasn't sure how he felt about that, exactly, and now was perhaps not the time...
"God, you're gorgeous. Get on your knees," the customer growled. "Suck my cock like you said. Want to see those lips wrapped around my prick." He nipped sharply at Sherlock's lips as he said it, drawing a startled yip from the detective as he jerked back.
"Oh! J - John. ..John- are you close?" He babbled, almost sobbing with frustration and despair and need. "Please….oh…oh, please, John! Please!"
"John," Sherlock managed to utter, swallowing again, hypnotised by the sight of his long fingers disappearing into his partner at a rapid, dizzying speed, and, according to John's face, shamelessly and openly expressing his pleasure. "John," he whispered shakily. "Tell me how it feels."
Sherlock scowled massively and strangled out a noise of deep vexation, before finally downing his mouthful of muffin and hastening to retort, spraying chocolate crumbs all over his own summer-damp shirt.
"What do you want, gorgeous?" John asked and Sherlock, not really caring, asked for a hand job, rolling onto his back and spreading his legs so John could get comfortable.
Sherlock texted back, waiting on tenterhooks for John's reply...which never came. It was clear he didn't know what Sherlock was up to. His stomach sank. What was this feeling? He frowned, trying to parse through what exactly it was.
"Down near the end." John giggled, inordinately pleased seeing Sherlock at a loss and hunting for something. It was so rare and, if John were being honest, rather endearing.
Shaun recovered quickly, not wanting to be intimidated by Sherlock. He thrust his chest out, squaring his jaw. "Yeah? Well I don't know what in hell he's thinking with you. Bet you'd never even sucked a cock before. Did he have to teach you how? Do you even swallow?" He laughed, derisive.
?" John asked through gritted teeth, as he began a feverish pace with his wrist, soaked with a surprising amount of pre-come, so much that small, translucent drops were plopping rhythmically from his fiercely-rapid hand, to the hatefully-overpriced carpet.
Beside him, John turned his face to the sinking sun, closing his eyes and taking deep, happy breaths. Sherlock watched him for a few minutes from the corner of his eye, tracing the wrinkles at the corners of John's eyes, at his mouth, the moles that decorated the side of his neck. Illuminated by the sinking sun, looking handsome and distinguished by the visible signs of his age, John was lovely.
His own heart was racing as he finished and wiped his slick fingers on the sheets, mentally reminding himself to wash them later. He eyed the myriad, greenish bruises spread over Sherlock’s’ torso and legs, and hesitated.
"Move back to your bloody seat, Shaun. You had your chance and you blew it. I wouldn't have come out tonight if I thought it involved seeing your fucking smug face again."
John had known Shaun didn't love him. But he'd hoped...He'd thought maybe, after all they'd done and been through, that Shaun was falling for him. That he just didn't feel comfortable saying it. They were blokes after all. They didn't talk about feelings.
Then, after a minute of uncomfortable silence accompanied by John’s restless flicking through the newspaper’s pages, he spoke up again. “Would you at least tell me why?”
“No, no that’s fine, thank you,” then, not wanting to sound too curt, he added, “Really, John. Thank you.”
The party was being held in the event room of a modest hotel in Notting Hill. The room was spacious and airy and Sherlock was surprised Lestrade and the gang went through the trouble of reserving such a room. Its open-concept allowed Sherlock to purvey the room from the bar. He spotted John off to the side, standing in front of a large window, drink in hand, chatting with a woman Sherlock had not cared to notice before. John was being as distant as ever, avoiding Sherlock whenever possible, making excuses to head to the washroom or the bar whenever he sensed Sherlock was on his way to approach him. Sherlock was exasperated. Not only was John ignoring him, he was leaving him to fend for himself in a room full of people wishing to...
"Okay," John said with his voice still caught up in the end of a laugh. "Okay, you don't have to do my head-nodding thing. Just be yourself and do whatever comes naturally."
Sherlock waited a moment before responding, going through the options John was presenting him with. "If I choose to have Mycroft over for dinner," he began with a hint of distaste in his tone, "could we possibly invite him over another evening when I have more time to prepare, possibly even enough time to go through a whole box of nicotine patches?"
He chased after John, pushing past the crowd until he found himself in the hotel's lobby, receiving a series of odd looks from the hotel’s staff.
"Well, Sherlock, I can't imagine that two blokes who claim to be in a purely platonic friendship cuddle all of the time." Lestrade took another long swig of beer.
Sherlock was puzzled. There wasn’t enough data. John was never like this. Sherlock had nothing to compare this to, no experience with an angry, quiet John Watson.
“I don’t know, Sherlock, it depends on the music. If it’s an upbeat song then you’d typically go for a faster kind of dancing. And for slower songs, slow dancing is the go-to.”
However, Lestrade's conclusion did have an ounce of sense to it, upon further observation. It would explain why John had been so distant since the Arm Cuddling Incident. He was most likely taking some time away from Sherlock to figure out his feelings and why Sherlock's instinctive cuddling affected him in the way it did. This was a possibility that Sherlock had not entertained before. It was intriguing to him. He'd be lying if he said he never imagined what it would be like to take a step beyond where their relationship currently stood. But he had always brushed these thoughts away, claiming they were pointless impossibilities. But now, he found himself wondering how impossible they truly were. Suddenly, he could see him and John taking that step, sharing more moments like what happened during the Arm Cuddling Incident. They had always loved each other in some form but when did that platonic love turn into something more?
“We’re here.” John said quickly, unbuckling his seat belt and scrambling for money to pay the cabbie before Sherlock could finish his sentence.
"Oh, just come here, you." John captured Sherlock's face in his hands and joined their lips together in another demanding kiss that left Sherlock utterly breathless. Their hands tangled around each other as they kissed. Sherlock realized there was nowhere else he'd rather be.
that bother John so much? This was the question that had been bouncing off the walls of his Mind Palace for days now. Sherlock decided that it couldn’t have been because John was bothered by physical contact as he had hugged him just earlier that day. He wondered if he had strained John’s bad shoulder by pulling his arm unexpectedly but this was unlikely because Sherlock had been very gentle during the Arm Cuddling Incident. And a simple accident like straining John’s bad shoulder should hardly be worth a determined dose of silent treatment, should it not?
“No, well, most parties have some kind of entertainment like a live band or a karaoke machine. And you can almost always count on music and dancing.”
This must not have been Lestrade's first beer of the night because based on that comment alone he must have been far more drunk than Sherlock realized. It was absolutely preposterous that Lestrade could come to such a conclusion. John being in love with him? Impossible. John wasn't even gay. Or, at least he claimed that he wasn't whenever someone suggested that he was. But even if John wasn't entirely straight, there was no way he thought of Sherlock as anything more than a close friend, if that.
Sherlock chuckled. "It's up to you. Although, I wouldn't mind finally showing off some of those dance moves you taught me."
He let his eyes travel down the table to where John was sitting with the same woman he had seen him with before. He was turned toward her, sitting at an angle with his back to Sherlock, smiling the simple, wide grin that Sherlock once considered himself to be familiar with. John was trying too hard. The woman he was with would obviously sleep with him if the opportunity presented itself. Her silver pointed-toe heels were brand new, suggesting she bought them for the occasion and that she clearly hadn't been out in a long time. She was a fan of the blog, Sherlock deduced. Too much makeup, desperate for attention, her body language displaying a clear interest in John. She was single and searching.
“Show me the kind of simple moves that you would use at a party. It would give me a better idea of what’s expected.”
Again, before Sherlock had the chance to cut in, John started again. "No, never mind, I don't want to hear it. Just another one of your stupid, bloody plans to make things more interesting, am I right? God, Sherlock..."
"Idiot?" Sherlock teased. "I thought you thought I was brilliant. I just solved one hundred cases, for Christ's sake, what more do you want?"
They stayed like that for an amount of time that Sherlock had virtually lost track of, until he felt John delicately lifting Sherlock's hand off of his arm. Sherlock raised his head to meet John's eyes but his expression was unreadable. Had Sherlock crossed some type of boundary by leaning into him like that? His deductions were failing him. Possibly sensing Sherlock's uncertainty, John smiled at him for a second before pushing himself into a standing position. He stretched out his hand to help Sherlock up too.
The wind picked up after a moment, awakening them from their peaceful trance. "We should go back inside," Sherlock said.
Wordlessly, John took a seat on the couch next to Sherlock, held his gaze for a moment and then slowly, carefully reached out his arms to pull Sherlock towards him. John's arms were sturdy and warm as they wrapped around Sherlock's shoulders and crossed over at his back. Stunned, Sherlock kept his arms tucked at his side. John was...hugging him? That certainly wasn't mentioned in his personal list of predictions. He let himself relax into the embrace, still unsure, but giving into the warmth John was offering. If he was being honest with himself, it was quite nice. He raised one arm and used his hand to cup the back of John's shoulder, pulling him closer.
"Yes, I can see that. What was it this time? It must have been pretty bad. Severed legs in the cupboards? Cockroaches between the couch cushions? Or did you finally burn down the place?"
"Wait! Stop, seriously, stop!" Sherlock watched as John paused his motion to send the message and looked up at him. Sherlock closed his eyes, letting out a small wavering breath before everything came out in one big, unplanned clump of a confession. "I can't go to this party because I have never been to a party. Not once. Let alone, a party that has been held in my honour. Frankly, I don't know what the word 'party' even entails. Dancing? Drinking? Eating? Singing? Talking? Touching? Who knows! I wouldn't know! The great Sherlock Holmes—the world's only consulting detective and the world's only man who has never been to any sort of party in his whole bloody life!"
John rolled his eyes and continued. “Okay, so what if I just let you know what to expect, what to look out for. You know, parties really aren’t that complicated.”
“Sherlock, you listen to me.” John said calmly, clearly gathering up every ounce of energy not to lose his patience. “It was very considerate of Greg and everyone to go through the trouble of arranging this party. They really appreciate the work you’ve been doing for them over the years, so would it kill you to show up at a party that they’ve arranged just for you?”
By the time Saturday rolled around, John had spoken to Sherlock a total of three times. All brisk, meaningless chitchat, nothing like the way they had spoken to each other the day John was teaching him how to dance. Sherlock couldn’t make sense of it. One day they were laughing together like they were the only two people in the world and the next, John was giving him the cold shoulder as if he were a complete stranger. It was very odd behaviour.
Sherlock thought briefly, taking himself back to the moment in question. "We were lying on the floor together, pressed shoulder to shoulder, what happened before that is irrelevant, but there we were, laughing together...I don't know." Sherlock shook himself into focus. "All of a sudden I had just reached out and pulled his arm toward me and curled into him without even thinking about it. It was extremely odd, looking back, but at the time it felt totally normal, like it was meant to be happening."
“No,” he said with a touch of humour in his voice. “People don’t usually choreograph their dances ahead of time for parties. All you have to do is listen to the music, move with the beat, do a few simple moves, that sort of thing.”
“Uh,” John faltered, rubbing the back of his neck. “I can’t just dance without any music or anything.”
John eyes softened as he took in the weight of these words. He had lost the persistent anger that had driven him out of the hotel and he regarded Sherlock with a gentle type of astonishment. John took a step back, shoved his hands in his pockets and took a long, steadying breath. "It's about time I start being honest with you. And with myself."
"Plus, you and John haven't said a word to each other all evening. And don't think I haven't noticed that you haven't taken your eyes off of him for longer than thirty seconds at a time. I'm a detective too, you know," Lestrade said with a smirk. "Don't underestimate me."
"Yes, I did. Actually, well, I'm planning to but I haven't sent him the message yet. That's because I have a deal for you, Sherlock. If you agree to come to this party, that all of Scotland Yard has so humbly arranged in your favour, then I will delete this message and you will not have to put up with your brother tonight. But if you refuse to come," John paused, digging out his phone from his pocket and lifting it in front of Sherlock to show him the message that was ready to be sent to his brother, "then I will be hitting
"Oi, you two," Sherlock heard the familiar voice of Greg Lestrade call out. "There's a hotel right here. Get a room!"
They found themselves sprawled out on the floor several minutes later, their chests rising and falling quickly after all of the dancing and their foreheads slick with sweat. Sherlock was already feeling the after-effects of a pulled muscle.
Sherlock ran through many possibilities for John’s sudden silence and found that the most viable conclusion was that Sherlock had indeed crossed some kind of boundary by leaning into John while they were lying on the floor, beat out from dancing. It had been such an innocent, careless action but it seemed to be the root of whatever was wrong with John. John was perfectly fine around Mrs. Hudson, engaging her in all kinds of conversations about the lovely weather they’ve been having and the supposed snow storm they’d been calling for that afternoon. Clearly, he wanted everyone to know it was a Sherlock problem. And seeing as John was acting perfectly normal up until what Sherlock was now terming the Arm Cuddling Incident, that must be the only explanation for John’s spurt of silence.
"No, my family was never big on birthdays. We never hosted parties to celebrate them and, come to think of it, we rarely even acknowledged each other's birthdays."
Sherlock took a long, dramatic breath and pushed himself up from the stool. What was he even going to say? What was there to say? He dismissed these thoughts, deciding to worry about them after he completed the daunting task of crossing over the dance floor to where John was standing. He would worry about what happened when he got there. He launched himself through the dancing crowd and maneuvered his way to John with an inexplicable confidence he had mastered ages ago. He barely faltered when he found himself standing in front of John.
“Alright, well, you’re an intelligent man, you’ll catch on quickly so I’m not too worried. What do you want to know?”
Sherlock realized that he had no plan for what he would have said if John had responded to him. A simple
Early the next morning, John brought it up again over breakfast. “I’ll give you five quid if you can give me a respectable excuse not to go to this party.”
“Of course not. How silly of me,” Sherlock said with a grin as he pulled his phone out of his pocket. With lightning speed, he searched the internet for a
John just shook his head, a dry, humourless laugh escaping his lips. "Oh yeah, you're certainly right about that."
Maybe it was the look John was giving him, or maybe it was the dance music that was still blaring through the flat, but Sherlock suddenly found himself unable to hold in the laughter that was bubbling inside of him. John followed suit with a burst of giggles that sent Sherlock over the edge as he found himself smiling a wide grin and strolling back over to John.
"I meant you're always doing things that make people think we're a couple. Always. And I'm always the one who has to tell people we're not. You never say a bloody thing! You just leave it to me to set things straight."
"That was supposed to start five hours ago," Sherlock remarked, feeling the light flakes blowing around them.
Sherlock pressed another greedy kiss to John's lips and he heard a holler coming from someone inside who was still looking out from the door. They both laughed.
"Nothing in particular. All I'm saying is that maybe this little incident made John realize something he preferred not to realize."
They broke apart hesitantly, inching back bit by bit only to find themselves unable to resist the urge to press a final kiss to the other person's mouth.
"That's the spirit. Go get your blogger!" Lestrade raised his beer glass and chuckled at what he was saying.
"I'm so bloody tempted not to tell you why but I suppose you have the right to know. We're having company over for dinner." John exclaimed with far too much delight for Sherlock's liking.
"Look up," John said suddenly, directing his attention to the sky above them. Sherlock couldn't figure out what John was looking at for a moment, not until he saw a handful of snowflakes travelling through the air. The handful turned into bucketfuls as they gazed at the dark sky together.
“Alright,” said John, standing up, breaking the spell. “So, let me get this straight: you don’t want to go to this party because you have no experience going to parties and you don’t know what to expect?”
Sherlock smiled sadly for a second, all of the terrible recollections of his childhood suddenly floating back to him: all the missed birthdays piling up and piling up until Sherlock had given up and abandoned the idea of even acknowledging his own birthday. He had pushed away these thoughts for so long, tucked them into one of the deepest chambers of his Mind Palace, and now it was all coming back to him.
“You’re a complete arse, you know that?” John huffed as he plopped down in his chair, busying himself with the newspaper.
"It was accidental, of course. A conscious action, perhaps, but nothing was meant by it. However, it seems to have offended him gravely."
John gave him a little smile, the kind of adorable little quirk of his lip that sent Sherlock’s heartbeat skyrocketing. Sherlock lost himself in returning the smile.
"And then the other day," John continued, "when we were lying down on the floor in the sitting room and you just pulled my arm towards you, it did something to me, it dug up feelings that I thought I had pushed away long ago and I didn't know what to do."
John pulled back a bit to look Sherlock in the eye. "Do you mind if we give that first kiss another try?"
John laughed, pressing his lips to Sherlock's cheek and then he took Sherlock's hand in his own, guiding him in the direction of the hotel.
The appalling event John had been trying to convince Sherlock he ought to attend was a party hosted by Scotland Yard to congratulate Sherlock on solving his one hundredth case. To Sherlock, the whole thing seemed ridiculous. His “spectacular” one hundredth case was nothing more than a six on his scale—it was the boyfriend who was pining it on the victim’s deranged brother the whole time, obviously—so it was hardly worth celebrating. He’d solved much more difficult cases over the years and none of them merited a party. So, why now? Besides, he couldn’t stand the thought of being anywhere near Anderson without the excitement of a murder to distract him.
Sherlock searched for John out on the dance floor and found him speaking with Anderson, of all people. The woman from before was nowhere to be found.
Lestrade plopped down on the bar stool next to him with a grunt, followed by "Sherlock, I know dancing's probably not up your alley but just give it a try for God's sake. You look like a dead fish in an aquarium." Then he addressed the bartender. "And can I get a beer?"
Sherlock started stomping off in the other direction when he heard John protest. "No, no please come back. I shouldn't be laughing at you when we both know how bloody ridiculous I must look right now too."
and made his way towards the main entrance to the hotel, where the woman at the front desk had pointed.
He felt John's fingers ghosting over his jaw and tiptoeing up to a spot just behind his ear. John's lips came next, brushing against his chin at first and then reaching up to capture Sherlock's mouth with his own. It was tender, chaste, soft, full of something Sherlock dared to describe as love. Because what they had truly was love, even if it took them so long to realize it.
Sherlock took a tentative step towards John and pulled him into his arms. John closed the distance and melted into Sherlock's embrace. It felt like the most natural thing in the world. Sherlock found himself completely unconcerned by the fact that they were hugging in the middle of a cramped sidewalk in Notting Hill just outside the entrance of a hotel that people were bound to come in and out of. It didn't matter a bit to him. Even John didn't seem to care. That was a first.
John began moving his head to the beat, nodding along at first and slowly getting more adventurous with it by letting his head sway from side to side to the rhythm. Everything about the movement looked so natural in coordination with the music that Sherlock found himself utterly lost in watching John dance. It was mesmerizing to see him that way—eyes pressed shut, head bobbing to the music, feet doing a little hopping thing that, if it were anyone but John, would look utterly ridiculous but he made it work.
“Fine.” John said after a moment. “Don’t tell me. See if I care.” And with those words, he stomped off to his room.
"No, I mean, not really. Nothing like that has ever caused John to act like this. It's not making sense."
Sherlock turned his face into John's shoulder and chuckled, his eyes crinkling as he grinned. He felt John laughing contently against him and suddenly Sherlock felt like he was on top of the world. The idea of this party John had been persuading him to attend no longer seemed like a chore. Hell, even having Mycroft over didn't even sound half bad. At this thought, Sherlock suddenly started to wonder if dancing caused the brain to release any euphoric hormones that could be responsible for such an outrageous thought. Nevertheless, Sherlock felt uncharacteristically overjoyed with his nose rubbing against the cotton sleeve of John's jumper as they lied down on the floor together. He closed his eyes and breathed in the scent of the sitting room, of the floorboards, of John.
. The flat was instantly filled with the pulsating sound of drums and electronic keyboards. “Go ahead.”
"I..." Sherlock thought about the best way to word it and found out there really wasn't any good way of wording it. "I cuddled him."
When it was announced that dinner was ready, Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief and took his seat. He busied himself with his food, picking away at the plate of chicken risotto, hoping to appear too distracted by the food to be engaged in more small talk. Thankfully, he was only interrupted once and ate the remainder of his meal in undisturbed silence.
"No, thank you." Sherlock didn't offer Lestrade so much as a glance. His eyes were fixed on John. He had taken off the jacket of his suit and was now stepping around rhythmically and shaking his head, probably as a response to someone's question. Then, John kept moving to the beat, escalating into some of the signature moves Sherlock was more familiar with.
Sherlock gave John a playful eye roll. "I imagine they'll be bringing it up until the party that celebrates the one thousandth case I solve for them, unfortunately."
Sherlock's dancing progressed into an experimental shimmy of sorts as the next song began. John joined in, showing Sherlock some of his "signature moves" and Sherlock gladly copied them, finding them much more exciting than the head-bobbing. Eventually, Sherlock began to pick up some of his own moves, adding in a bit of a skipping motion here and there, and a twirl every now and then which made John laugh every time.
"John!" Sherlock called out as John disappeared behind the crowd. When he looked around him, he saw that everyone had indeed dropped what they were doing to gawk at what had just happened. Okay, perhaps kissing John in front of everyone they worked with wasn't the best idea. Despite what he had said to Greg just a few minutes prior, he really was still capable of scaring John off.
"That's—that's okay." Sherlock remained fixed in his position leaning against the fireplace, fully intent on watching John move along to the song for as long as possible. This plan was cut short when John shimmied over to Sherlock, took his hands in his own, and started pulling him to the middle of the room. Sherlock obliged as John dragged him forward and then set him free in the center of the room, expecting him to instantly start dancing. When Sherlock remained perfectly still, John raised an eyebrow at him.
“Sometimes there’s food, or snacks at the very least. In our case, Greg has invested in a superb cake. For birthday parties, this would be the time you sing
could do the trick but he had a feeling John wouldn’t admit to being bothered by something as simple as Sherlock holding his arm. And why
"Well, first of all, you're being insanely quiet, keeping all those signature sarcastic comments to yourself. It's not like you at all."
Sherlock risked a glance up at John who had remained completely still since the beginning of Sherlock's outburst. What he found when his eye's caught John's face was completely uncalled for. He was expecting the disbelief, of course, but he had been anticipating a fit of laughter to come next. The thought of anyone his age never attending a party of any sort sounded absolutely ludicrous. But John wasn't laughing. He wasn't ridiculing him or making fun of him in any way. His features were portraying an emotion Sherlock could only describe as concerned.
Sherlock opened his mouth, perfectly ready to explain what was on his mind but John cut him off before he had the chance to start.
He found himself resenting John too, just because he was associating with her. She wasn't what John needed, what John deserved. She knew nothing about him. She didn't know that John used to be an army doctor, that he was a man full of compassion, that he owned more ridiculous-looking jumpers than any other man in London, that he makes an excellent cup of tea in the morning. She didn't know John Watson in the way Sherlock did. Sherlock prided himself on this fact and continued to eat his dinner in silence, keeping an inconspicuous tab on John.
