Sherlock hummed and moved two of his fingers to wave her goodbye, she giggled and left. He looked at her again as if she had lost her mind. Probably she had.
"How old are you? Are you even allowed to drive?" Sherlock said without taking his eyes off him, which made John feel a little uncomfortable.
Mycroft looked startled at the question for a moment, but then his expression became as emotionless as always. “John Watson…”
"Shut the fuck up for a moment and let me talk. You can stay in my room."
"Good night, John."
"Have you ever done this before?", John asked softly.
. "So yes, thank you for bringing him here."
"Sherlock!"
Mycroft shrugged. "I don't know."
you know what? Listen to whoever you want!"
"Well, if you excuse me..." John said turning his back because he really wanted to leave.
"Is he okay?"
”, he said, pointing at the drawing.
Mike raised an eyebrow at Sherlock. "Sherlock, flash news, you're not a doctor, you have no saying in this", Mike said, clearly still furious at them.
"I...don't know anything about Jim. Sorry."
Sherlock remained silent for the rest of the ride.
"It's great to see you too." John smiled.
*******
Sherlock smiled back, grabbed John's hand and led them towards his bedroom. As soon as he opened the door, John started kissing him again and Sherlock gasped. They stood there for a while, content with feeling each other there. John grimaced and had to break away because his leg was throbbing him once again. He looked disappointed of having to limp towards Sherlock's bed.
"Expecting something, are we?", Lestrade asked.
voice. Apparently he had.
"Of course I would do something like this! Now shut up and enjoy of the road without asking me anything else."
“When was the last time you fucked with someone?”
"I'll just- I'll leave you here. I'll bring your tea in the morning, okay?"
"You better take your chance with that doll, bird!" Greg said excitingly, patting his arm.
He pressed his forehead against John's chest, feeling his rise and fall. His rise and fall. His rise. His fall.
He blinked and found the driver looking at him with a weird expression on his face. Right, he was standing in front of Baker Street. He handed the cabbie the money and walked into the flat, desperately wishing that John was there to receive him with a smile and a kiss. But John had a nightly shift at the clinic, which was the reason why he'd left the crime scene early and-
"Yes." His mother said sharply. "What are you doing here?"
"Hang on," John said, fully turning to look at them. "Do you know each other?"
“And he’ll be gone forever?” John asked after a long moment of silence.
"...fine."
His brain turned on again, for a single second, and his hand moved on to the grip, holding tightly the other hand.
"And to answer your question, no. I do not love her."
He hated that new high school, he hated his... Friends and he hated taking the bus. That gang he was spending time with was starting to get annoying, and he missed being alone. Now he couldn't be by his own a minute without a girl coming to talk to him or one of the boys talking about the dolls he bang. It was all so dull.
Sherlock tried to cover the expression of displeasure in his face. Wonderful friends he had there. They were standing by the lockers and classes were about to start. Jim wasn't there and Sherlock still wondered if he really was okay with him "dating" Irene. Greg was silent. He looked at Sherlock quietly. The bell rang.
Sherlock stopped and looked at him. "For a doctor, you're very stubborn."
Sherlock stared at him, stunned. Without even thinking he leaned up and their lips met once again, softly, less desperate.
Lestrade, I’m going to take him home and make sure he gets a proper rest and a proper meal.”
Irene chuckled. "
He had better things to think about. Something less... Bitter.
The studies didn’t go that bad. He was starting to realize that he wasn’t particularly bad at drawing, he never had been of course, he was an artist, he simply hadn’t paid much attention to drawing realistically per se, but once he focused completely on doing so, while he filtered the noise of the street, while he emptied his mind of all distractions, while his hand remained steady, and while he pictured Sherlock guiding him through with advices, his drawings would come out looking…realistic enough.
He rolled his eyes as he looked around.
John went to open the door, but just before he did so, he turned to look at Sherlock once again. The mask had fallen off, or he had forgotten to put it on once again, because when their eyes locked, John looked so filled with pain, with his jaw clenched and his breathing ragged, he looked angry, desperate and so terribly
For him, Sherlock wasn't just a work partner either.
The museum of antiquities?
He pushed his hips against John’s, so he could feel his hardness. He didn’t stop himself. Didn’t stop to think about it. He
He let out a sigh and continued walking, wondering if Sherlock was still behind.
Sherlock shook his head. "We'll fill applications, John, look everywhere. You were born to be a doctor! Look, you're even reading a book about anatomy! I've seen the way your eyes sparkle when you're helping someone else. You're a healer. In every sense of the word."
He observed the pictures of the victims. All of them had died somewhere they were familiar with, either at their working place or at their house. Except for Isabella, and yet she had been at a place she knew, a place she was comfortable with. Or as comfortable as she could get in a hotel room.
John sighed in exasperation. Sherlock and his bloody lack of tact.
Sherlock shrugged slightly, as much as he could without feeling the pull of his the bullet hole in his skin. "Apparently yes."
“For God’s sake, Sherlock! I haven’t bought anything since I came back! I was lucky I found something I could draw with!”
them, or my brain was going to explode. So I tried them and..." Sherlock bit his lip. "I really thought I had it under control."
*********
greaser
Sherlock didn’t turn to look at him, he kept his eyes fixed on the painting in front of him. “You look different”, he replied.
"I don't know what you're thinking, but you look... Sexy when you are so focused." She smiled even wider and leaned closer.
He was so lost in thoughts he didn't realize in which moment the greaser turned his face towards John's window and now they were just staring at each other and time was freezing and it was just the two of them and John couldn't look away. Sherlock's expression was unreadable, yet he wasn't taking his eyes off either.
John looked down. "I know, I just...I couldn't help it."
--------------------------
This couldn’t encompass what he felt, this wasn’t even close, this was just a stupid reduction of the whole situation, a poor attempt to express the inexpressible.
He still felt the need to use them. What used to alleviate his boredom was drawing and now his lack of inspiration had only left him feeling more and more desperate for relief. It seemed almost unavoidable, until…until he saw John Watson’s painting and his inspiration was brought back to life.
to know that an action always brings it consequences and you have to do the right choice always. Always. You look like a smart boy, but you have to do the right choices if you want to get somewhere." John nodded absentmindedly.
"Dear... I'm not going to leave this door until you open it and assure me that you're awake!"
He threw his backpack on the entrance, sighed and went out to take a taxi.
He didn't get to. He slipped past the door while one of Mycroft's minions flirted with one of the nurses, but the minion realised of it and called for backup. Two minutes later he was tucked into bed again, scowling.

Sherlock looked down and shrugged. "I don't know."
“Why haven’t you written again?” Melissa asked out of curiosity.
That was definitely a bit not good.
Sherlock smiled. "I'll be there in a moment."
“There’s no need to say anything John, you can simply walk out the door and leave”, Sherlock replied, sharply.
“Now take your mental image, translate it to your arm and make your hand move with the symphony.”
Sherlock looked around, they were not inside the hotel room anymore but on the hallway, just outside. How long had he blacked out for? He couldn’t quite remember. In all honesty, he couldn’t remember much before he blacked out.
"I always do." Sherlock said winking at him.
She smiled. "Let's have dinner. And I'm being delicate this time. Just dinner, I promise."
Sherlock hmed. “Yes, I knew that much”, he said, sounding slightly exasperated and John loved that Sherlock wouldn’t sugarcoat him, wouldn’t treat him any differently, wouldn’t change his whole demeanor after seeing John at his most vulnerable.
“It is quite similar to the color you used as a background”, Sherlock continued after a while.
I swear this is the last horrible cliffhanger I'll leave you with!!! Thank you so much for reading <3
Well, two human bodies.
“Yes.”
"Why?"
"What did it say, Sherlock?"
"Yes. It was a surgery on my bloody shoulder. I broke it after I fell on the street. I crashed with a cyclist and... I don't know why I'm telling you that, what does it have to do with this?"
Suddenly, Sherlock's phone sounded. The woman.
“Alright then”, he looked at Sherlock before turning again and closing the door behind him.
John closed the newspaper and eyed the folders with a frown. "What's that?", he asked, a bit sharply.
"Just... The usual. She yelled at me, I yelled at her. She will come back when she forgives me.
He opened the link.
“Great!”, Melissa said, excitedly. “I- well, my shift is over in two hours so could I pass by there just after I’m done?”
The class went by and he didn't understand a single thing his teacher explained, but he didn't care (which showed him how much Sherlock had changed him in such a short period of time) and then it came: the bell. Lunch. One hour before detention. He was nervous but he had absolutely no idea what he was nervous about. And damn it. He couldn't still get Sherlock out of his head.
John gasped. His mouth fell agape but he struggled to close it again.
"I said I don't want to get out. I'm having fun in here and my house is endlessly boring."
"John!", Sherlock exclaimed at the sensation as John slowly let go of his cock until he had only the top of it in his mouth. Then, just as slowly, he started going down again. Sherlock couldn't help it. He jerked his hips up, desperate to keep feeling the heat of John's mouth once again. John moaned as Sherlock moved, and Sherlock kept doing it so until he apparently let go too much and choked John.
“Ugh! The white thing!”
"Do you think that of yourself?" John murmured and Sherlock snapped his head to face him, his eyes widening, but he didn't reply.
John looked at him nervously. “What do you think?”, he asked.
"So?" John said, trying to clean the tears he had on his face.
"Have a seat. Dinner will be ready in a minute."
"It's fine."
.- Mind Palace John kept telling him.
"Seriously, are you angry because I'm caring about your well being?" The words stood in the air, Sherlock heard each one of them carefully, surprised.
What else could he paint about? The idea of painting London had simply come from the atmosphere of 221B, for it carried the essence of what London was, of what it represented: the mix of the old and the new, the classical and the modern, the scent of tea mixed with oils and turpentine, the light rain crashing against the window. Sherlock. Sherlock painting the human body. It felt like
22 steps, plus the seven stairs leading to John's bedroom. It would take him approximately 8,5 seconds to get to it. In 8,5 seconds, 24 different violin notes crossed through his head.
"Why did he hit you?" Sherlock said, changing the topic and turning so he could see John's face properly, who still didn't dare to look at him.
He had finished sketching the human form for his third painting in the week, now all he had to do was paint it.
Knock, knock.
Sherlock looked at him immediately, frowning. John knew how much it pissed the detective whenever he got into his business, especially with anything related to the woman. This was not looking good. Sherlock articulated his words slowly, with a growing tone of anger. "You knew? You knew and you didn't let me go!"
John shook his head too. "Do you think it's easy for me? Sherlock, at least you have friends, you have a girlfriend, you have a reputation, all I had was
John had learnt to recognize (and name) the different colors he’d seen along his career. He had a sharp eye for colors, and yet he couldn’t put a name on the color of Sherlock’s eyes.
"Because... I thought it was the best thing to do!"
Sherlock thought.
And it would be fine. Because for one moment, just for one moment, Sherlock had believed it. Sherlock had felt it. Sherlock had seen the light rushing through him, scintillating and sparkling and lighting.  All of that- What was that smell?
John tried very hard not to shout at her. He was angry, and yes, he was jealous. "What do you want from him? What now? Why now? Why here?"
And oh god, that was more than enough, more than he could have ever asked for.
", Sherlock said with disdain and John suddenly
“Yes?”, Sherlock asked. If Jones had escaped, then Sherlock would be certain he was Isabella’s killer. He hoped those were the news Lestrade would give him.
“I’m sorry”, John said again.
Now he only saw colors.
“It was yours.”
Nothing. He came up with nothing. He needed to focus.
Sherlock turned to look at John and nudged him slightly, without the detective's notice. John reacted and stepped forward, adjusting his glasses. He tried to make his most serious and adult-like voice. "Hm...Yes. Yes. Doctor John H. Watson."
"Your elevated pulse seems to disagree with you."
Sherlock leaned closer. "Well, my answer will have to be why do you think so little of yourself, John?" John didn't say a word.
As soon as she saw him, she stood up and waved a hand at him. Sherlock rushed towards her and didn't greet, he merely said: "What happened?"
Unfortunately, Mycroft knew how to handle Sherlock in these situations. They had been in the same position many times before, and he didn't even flinch, no matter how much Sherlock begged.
you? That boy who stood silent and quiet while I was being beaten and pushed against the lockers. Yes. That one
“What did you mean, then?”, Sherlock said, just as lowly as John’s.
"Please, keep an eye on him"
Before Mycroft could answer, Sherlock's phone sounded again. They both directed their looks to the object lying in the table. Sherlock sat in John's chair without saying a word. Mycroft smirked: "What an interesting sound Sherlock! I hadn't heard it in
"I'm sorry for ruining everything."
And all of the sudden the feelings came back rushing to him. He had numbed them momentarily, far too busy with trying to have everything perfect for his visit, he had managed to distract himself, but now, standing in front of John, of a John that he had hurt so many times and in so many ways, of a John that exhibited every single psychological scar on his face, and that showed nothing but the deep, searing hurt that Sherlock had caused him, he felt he would collapse, right then, right in front of John.
Well, he hadn’t texted him back, but as they said goodbye with a frankly breathtaking kiss, John had clearly said that he would come back, or did he?
throat
"The night of the accident..." Sherlock started a bit hesitantly.
"Morning, Sherlock!" - Harry stared at him. "Good night sleep?"
“-and, we’re done. I think.”
"Fine, you are
"You look miserable, you know that?"
was the wake up call which told Greg something was completely wrong. How the hell was it possible that John Watson remembered the cases but didn't remember the man who solved them? He stood silent for a moment frowning, and realized he hadn't replied yet. John eyed him curiously. "Not really." He replied absentmindedly.
What had happened was…unexpected and unplanned and wonderful.
“Yeah and you failed. Seriously Sherlock? Over three months to solve a case of serial murders? Getting slow aren’t we? Definitely slower than John’s blog claims you to be.”
When John realized, it was already 9 p.m. He seriously had no idea at which moment time had passed so fast, but he had to admit he was having a great time. He had talked to Sarah during all that time, and she was really interesting, she kept telling funny stories and he had a good laugh.
“Of course”, Sherlock whispered back. “Always, John. Always.”
He needed it before it was too late.
"He's right there, John", Lestrade said as he helped him up the ambulance.
John was scared of how Sherlock might react, maybe he would leave and then they wouldn't ever talk again, just the way it was supposed to be from the beginning. Wasn't it? But then the greaser just started laughing and John looked at him with a frown.
John shook his head. Sherlock was so, so
As soon as the class finished, John stood up and turned to look at Sherlock, gathering as much courage as he could, he took a deep breath.
Sherlock stood up and stopped in front of John. He extended his arm. “Show it to me”, he said.
to my house to take Harry, remember? Why did you do that? You were drunk! Something could have happened!"
“I know”, John replied, and his arms tightened on Sherlock, “I know you do.”
"Alright, alright!" John said still laughing. "I take it back!"
Sherlock stopped looking at the phone and his eyes fixed on John. "Of course, of course you can."
too. She is brilliant. There, the paper is ready."
John cleared his throat. "Hm...Sherlock brought you."
"Be careful with those kind of headaches." He warned him, wanting to change the topic completely.
"Harry Watson?"
--------------------------
He closed his eyes against the window. Perhaps he had said too much. It didn’t matter. His head hurt. So did his back.
Sherlock’s eyes widened. “What?”
"It's just that I was holding these books and I couldn't see... So."
"Alright then, but I'll see you in lunch!"
He didn’t look at him either. He just sat behind, not pushing, not kicking, not punching, not yelling. Now
He remembered what Mike had told him and the boy had a point. It was better to set the grounds clear and there was no better chance to do it than now, since the greaser was barely alone and his friends were absolute jerks not to mention they now were picking on John and this was all Sherlock's fault and all because some freaking books.
“Great, Dr. Watson. We’ll see you then. Do you have any other questions?”
Sherlock closed his eyes and recorded John's smell John's body John's hair John's hands John's back. He had done so before, a thousand times, and yet everytime he did so he found something new, something worthy, something magnificent.
The night before had been different, there was a raw need for relief, but now, here, there was something deeper than that, something that dared not speak its name, and he could see it in John's eyes, and he could feel it himself.
work with that music!" John said, moving his hands through the air.
One of the investigators stopped them at the entrance. "Hey! Wait! What do you think, that you can just get any friend inside to peek whenever you want to?"
“Sherlock-”
He was about to fall asleep, feeling he had used all the energy he had left on his body, when he heard John's voice whisper. "I'm sorry."
Sherlock was good at thinking of outcomes.
Mrs Hudson stood up frowning. "You just want me out of here, don't you?"
John wasn't staring him with a look that said
"John, Moriarty is only the consulting criminal. She wasn't working with him, she just...requested his services. That was all. Stop being so dramatic."
It took him too long to realise that he had an oxygen mask on. It took him too long to realise that that was what was helping him to breathe properly.
"Sorry. Mm... Molly. Molly Hooper. Remember? The girl from the chemistry club. She asked me to give you her number. So I'm doing it." He said showing Sherlock the paper.
"I can drive drunk!" Sherlock said annoyed.
John’s brain shut itself off as soon as he listened to the ‘we’. He absentmindedly nodded.
"No." Sherlock said shaking his head.
"What the hell is that supposed to mean?" -John asked, regretting immediately of opening his mouth.
As he did, a smile drew itself on his lips. He stared at Sherlock for a long moment before he cleared his throat and said “morning”.
"That's not information I needed to hear, so I'll pretend I didn't and keep talking. Anyway, I found a note in his coat. She gave him a present and asked him to wear it in their date tonight!"
John shook his head, not knowing what else to say. All of this situation was unbelievable and stupid.
He walked towards him.
"Stop it." Sherlock said shaking his head.
*******
Sherlock stood up in his fine suit and raised his chin, "I assure you, detective inspector..." The sleuth said throwing one last look at John, hoping he would sound more rational and logical to the doctor. Perhaps,
"Terrible, as usual." Sherlock said as he stared his friends in an incredibly serious gaze, which later turned into a confused one, when they all laughed. He wasn't telling a joke. It was true. History was a torture for him. John looked at him from afar and smiled a bit.
-------------------
"Shhh", John said placing a finger over his lips. Sherlock shuddered at the sensation of John's skin. He sat up and linked their lips together once again.
Sherlock stood hesitantly over the ‘send’ button, wondering if it was too bold to ask John to come with him when it wasn’t really certain that John
Finally, the greaser looked up and rolled his eyes, "what?"
John laughed and shook his head, "no, it's fine. Better than fine actually."
"What do you mean
Surprisingly enough, the encounter went...well. After a cup of coffee and a long time of talk, John's mother seemed to have changed completely her opinion about the greaser and seemed to accept him as a friend of his son. Sherlock was so... charming, and John thought he would be an excellent actor. The greaser talked about his life, about his parents, even about his brother! And John ended up thinking that now his mom knew Sherlock better than he knew Sherlock. Which made him a little jealous. Which was stupid and he shook the thought away.
"She didn't hurt you?", he asked, remembering what she had done to John. He felt anger rushing all over his body.
Sherlock shook his head, "No, no apparently nobody knew where they had moved to. This town is very small, John, it barely appears on the maps. Seems like the perfect place to hide."
His skin missed the pinch of the needle, he would come to realise.
Sherlock sighed. "Well, you should know who he is
He allowed himself to move closer, to press himself as close to John's back as he possibly could, to feel their bodies together, John's back merging with his chest, their breathing synchronised, moving at the same time, as if they were just one. Apart by a lot of layers of clothes, but feeling the closest they've ever been. Sherlock closed his eyes and smiled in relief. He could get used to this. He could wake up to this every single morning, feel the rise and fall of John's chest below his hands for the rest of his life. Hell, this was everything he never thought he wanted.
"I don't believe you, sorry."
"FIRE!" Sherlock yelled.
"Nothing."
Her mother sighed. "Don't let it happen again, John. You are a brilliant student. This boy doesn't seem like a good influence in you."
John looked confused. "
As she hung up she stood up and started running and screaming.
! I don't feel such... Sentiments."
"You know what? I'm going to sleep, you deal with Moriarty by yourself, do as you wish, tell whoever you want. Good night." John stood up and left to his room. Sherlock stood in there for another half hour, thinking over and over again. He felt so much fault, so much pain. He didn't know how to make it up to John, he really had been a terrible friend, he didn't deserve a best friend like John Watson.
John laughed a humorless laugh. “So it was a lie.”
Yes, John realized it was for the best. He had to stop this, all of this, he had to pull the band-aid off. Painfully but quickly. Now or never. Sherlock looked at him and frowned. "Really? Why not?" God, he was still unaware, he seriously didn't know.
"There is nothing wrong with me!" She said defensively.
"Are you okay?" Sherlock asked worriedly, but not wanting to invade John's space.
During lunch John did hang out with Mike and his group of friends. They were nice and they talked to him, but he didn't feel right, he just felt like he didn't fit in at all, and he hated that. He wanted to feel like part of the group, but he simply couldn't. He assumed that it was just his personality, the way he was, and he could do nothing to change it, so as lunch passed by, John counted the minutes till he could go join the chemistry club, not that he was a fan of it, but he was starting to consider being a doctor as a possibility and he had to know some chemistry if he wanted to do right at college.
"Five years."
"Yes! And he saw me in my pjs, thank you very much."
"Yeah, maybe, probably. Possibly."
War left scars. And not just physical scars.
John fell silent. Now that he could finally talk to Sherlock he didn't know what to say. "I... Why were you mad at me yesterday?"
John hadn’t been expecting
was a boy? No. He had a reputation to take care of. And if they found out, they would hurt John too. Of course, it was the best choice. How come he didn't realize he needed Irene's help?
The door opened to reveal a frankly surprising crime scene.
"Shut up!"
"One hundred and ninety milligrams is A LETHAL DOSE!", he yelled.
And that was for the best, wasn't it?
"From her. She hurt you so much the last time. And you saved her. And you care about her, and you love her. And she loves you and you'll get married and have children. And I'll stay here alone."
I’m in my head right now, aren’t I? ,
I just wanted to give you all a HUGE Thank You for all your support on the fic! I appreciate all your wonderful comments and kudos and it means a lot to me. I hope you keep enjoying the story :D
His eyes turned heavier, heavier. He had to close them, the white ceiling was turning black. That was never a good sign, he should listen to his brain just this once. His fingers on the right hand twitched a bit, but even that slight movement was far too much for him, he felt exhausted just by doing that.
them.
"Shut it Sherlock!" John immediately yelled at him.
John rubbed his leg but nodded. "Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, it's just... My bloody leg." He said a bit angrily.
She touched Sherlock's leg and placed her hand there. She whispered to his ear, "You know I could help you with that don't you? Do you want to make him jealous? Do you want to see how much he cares about you?"
Harry looked at him and opened her eyes wide, biting her lip. "I am not... I'm not. I'm not...."
"She is the woman!"
"The message that just arrived! Don't pretend like you didn't hear it!"
"And I drive." John tried to hide the smile drawing in his face, but he couldn't help it.
His last class before lunch was Biology, and even though he loved it, he couldn't focus and he absolutely hated that. When the bell rang, Mike turned to look at him and frowned: "Mate, are you okay?"
Sherlock stood up too. “Right, right”, he nodded over and over. “Of course.”
"Shut up Holmes! I just need a typewriter! Even if that means making deals with the devil!"
“Yeah”, John said after examining her. “She died at some point between around 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. The cause of death was blood loss.”
John had promised Mike he’d go to the gallery. When he received the message, he knew there was no turning back. Mike had photographed him in his studio four years ago, just before everything went to hell, and that portrait would be featuring in his collection.
Sherlock dragged a deep breath and nodded, leaning towards John, offering his hand.
"Why?" Sherlock said shaking his head.
He longed to go back in time.
As soon as they were inside of 221B, John’s eyes fixed on the same corner where he had seen Sherlock’s work in progress two days ago. It was finished now, and it was accompanied by other two works in progress, which brought just a little bit of color to the room.
“John, what happened?”, Sherlock asked while he crouched and examined John carefully, making sure that he didn’t have any injuries.
"You just smiled, so you thought about someone, what's his name?"
"You can take mine!" Clara said entering to the bathroom and handing him her keys. "They won't notice! Sometimes I leave it at school. Look, here's the sketch. It's very easy to get there, just a five minutes ride. Thank you Sherlock!"
"Nothing." Sherlock said looking elsewhere.
John stared at him as he let go of Sherlock's arm.
Magazine. "I think this will help." Sherlock said with a smile.
John nodded. He still felt somehow exposed and stripped down but he was amazed by Sherlock’s brilliance and madness and by the easiness in which he expressed it all without caring about following social standards and patterns. He just said what he thought and that was it. Perhaps people should be more like him.
He dragged a deep breath and slowly caressed John's back, until he held him by an embrace, a soft reassurance that he would be
"Because I was tired of doing whatever you wanted me to do." He said, still shaking.
Two minutes later, Lestrade replied.
"And I doubt you ever will. Can I count with you? Please. You are the only friend I have left."
He hadn't talked much to Mike because there wasn't much to say. Well, there were lots of things to say but he didn't want to tell him those. He knew he needed a friend, but nor Mike nor Sherlock filled in that concept for him. One for being less than a friend, the other being more than a friend.
*******
Irene and Sherlock nodded and left the classroom.
"Which one?" Sherlock hesitated.
"Of course John, we'll share the bed, then."
But he felt his arm being grabbed and he was forced to face the greaser again. His face flinched as he felt pain in his back. "Sorry, but you have to listen to me, John."
What a dolly!"
Then the pain registered in his brain. He squeezed his eyes shut as he was hit by the cruel reality: he'd been shot.
"I was looking for you."
"No, you certainly aren't." And as John said that, Harry punched him in the shoulder, "Ouch!"
You’ve never used them?”
. It hasn't stopped sounding. It's annoying." Answered John, he glanced at Sherlock, who was still standing in the door. Suddenly, he opened it wider and left.
"Clearly." Sherlock said, trying to sound cold and nonchalant and deeply hoping he had done it.
He needed answers, because he wasn't crazy.
The whole group burst in laughter, except for Sherlock and Greg. Sherlock was starting to form an idea about it, but he had to ask anyway. "How does she know?" He said frowning.
John opened the door and looked at him. "What?", he asked.
They pretty much always started the same way: he walked into St. Bart's, Mike Stamford next to him, Sherlock asking Afghanistan or Iraq.
And this lousy, poor drawing was a proof of it.
"This way, doctor!" Sherlock said happily.
Sherlock didn’t reply.
John smiled, that bright, clean smile that mixed colors that touched each other and yet distinguished one from other and that merged itself with the light blue of the sky. Sherlock felt drawn to that smile as if there was a magnetism behind it and couldn’t help but smile back.
John couldn’t explain why, but he wanted to keep talking to Sherlock so he said out of nowhere, “really? I started at 12. We were on a school excursion and I saw a Van Gogh painting and I decided that was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Perhaps not as good as his creations, but it was worth a try.”
But John thought it were only months.
John looked confused. "Why?"
She smiled. "Sorry bro, but you really,
"John-"
"Mom, will you let me explain or not? Third of all, I wasn't doing anything bad, don't worry." Well, that wasn't technically a lie. He just escaped with a guy and then argued with him and was never talking to him ever again. The thought of it scared John even more.
Sherlock just looked at him, looked and looked.
----------------
------------------
He opened the door. Hawthorne and Melissa walked in, carrying a lot of weird equipment. “I thought you were gone.”
John looked surprised. “Is it?”
Sherlock remained silent.
Jim turned to face Sherlock and looked at him up and down, before replying. "I don't understand what you're fighting about. You were the one who drove the boy into our path."
He knew it was true. He rushed to the door, yawning. He opened it looking half-sleep. Mrs Hudson saluted him with a huge smile in her face. "Good Morning, darling! How are you feeling today? First day, last year, isn't it exciting?"
Clara came from the backyard (and no signs of Harry) running and yelling "STOP THE MUSIC NOW AND SHUT THE FUCK UP!"
Sherlock shrugged. "Well, it's an excuse to not talk to my 'friends'"
"Sh-boom!" Greg yelled while Sherlock entered to the cafeteria only holding his book and trying to hide the little smile growing in his face. The greaser stopped immediately and turned to look at Greg confused.
Lestrade shook his head, "listen, I've heard that name before. Somewhere. What if she's involved in all of this? We can both agree on the fact that someone who works there surely must have something to do with the murders, what if her name might lead us to a clue?"
Sherlock stood silent, then Mycroft walked towards the couch and sat, keeping his eyes fixed on his little brother. "So... John Watson."
“Goodnight, John.”
He nodded absentmindedly.
"John phoned me last night, he told me about the message" Sherlock looked at him with a sarcastic expression: "Really? You don't say!"
Except he was surrounded by light. Trapped by it. He stared through the window.
“Hey!”, John said.
No point in denying it. Harry knew it since the start. She always knew. She knew before John knew. "...Yes." He said hesitantly, flushing.
greaser
He tucked his hands into the pockets of his Belstaff and started walking towards Marylebone Road, desperately needing a cigarette.
John wasn't a conductor of light, John was the light. Each and every single particle of radiation capable of igniting the cells of Sherlock Holmes' body, of Sherlock Holmes' brain. Capable of igniting his imperfections as well, and turning them into pure, absolute light.
And who he is is not much better.
He had tried making of the world a thing of beauty.
Sherlock put Harry inside the backseat with some difficulty, John turned to look at her, worried. "WHAT HAPPENED?", he yelled.
Time seemed to pass slower and slower, but at least his sister was happy and that was enough. But he missed Sherlock. God, how did he let this happen? When did this happen? When did Sherlock become such a huge part of his life, if not all of it? He realized it had been since the very beginning. Yes, he had changed since the moment he met Sherlock Holmes, everything had changed, hadn't it? He was happy, he lived now a crazy and ridiculous life, but a life that deserved to be lived. He embraced the adventure, and now he couldn't live a single day without it, without Sherlock. This was getting out of his hands. But he realized it already had a long time ago.
"What? No. Sorry. I didn't know you were coming until last night."
He sighed. The party didn't sound as much of a great idea now.
"Yes", was John's reply. A simple, shaky, out-of-breath yes. And Sherlock nearly lost it. He moaned.
“Of course he is! He is bloody fantastic! Was.”
“Is that what you think? Hm, I look for perfection in simplicity. That’s why I paint naked bodies.”
Yet here he was.
doesn’t it?”, she said with a smirk.
*******
They were both breathing hard by the time the world started turning around again, their senses slowly coming back to them.
"Sherlock, I think I made it quite clear: I want to be with you. That's it."
Someone had to break the silence.
John felt he blushed
Sherlock sat right next to a chair. "No. It's alright. Not much to do anyway."
He was sitting on the chair at Lestrade's office. They were both silent and he hadn't realised that Lestrade was staring at him until he spoke up. "No, Sherlock."
Mike looked at John confused, "oh, really? Why?"
The grip on his wrist loosened immediately and he turned the corner and walked away, not looking back to Sherlock.
John moved out for a moment and coughed. Sherlock threw an arm over his face, filled with embarrassment. "Sorry, sorry", he said.
“Running down the street”, John whispered, once again, to himself.
"... I don't know where your house is."
Sherlock took John's hands and slowly caressed his knuckles as they kissed. He remembered that moment, back in the rooftop when he talked to John and reached a hand, desperately, hopelessly trying to hold it one last time before letting go.
He couldn't help but think about all of that.
"What happened, Watson?"
"Fine!" Sherlock said looking in the first floor as Clara went to the second floor.
"Why?"
Sherlock was already standing up and walking towards the room while reading the text.
Sherlock stood still and silent.
"Are you sure?"
"...it's running late. I should just go home" -Greg said notably feeling uncomfortable, things were getting really tense and he felt he was knowing more than he should.
Sherlock looked at him clueless: "Like what?"
John walked towards him slowly. Sherlock could only blink, dazed by shock and surprise. He stopped in front of him and examined him carefully. He didn't reach out, he simply stared and stared and stared.
Sherlock looked at him with soft eyes before taking the shirt and using it to cover John’s shoulders once again.
Sherlock was right. This was exciting. He should feel ashamed of escaping and of disobeying his parents but he didn't, at all. He had to admit he had a lot of fun, hitting the road, seeing Sherlock's halfslept face, listening to that music he used to despise...
"And I can tell you like him too and I can tell he likes you too."
She nodded and leaned closer to his head. "Is he in here?"
It wasn’t because of John, of course not. That wouldn’t make sense.
And Sherlock couldn't help himself, he really couldn't. He was too far away from John, he needed to be close to John.
"Look at me."
over, more than over, actually. They both had been quite clear at the party, or so Sherlock thought, he didn't remember much of what he had said, but he remembered John's words clearly. It was painful, yet when they talked to each other at class, Sherlock held some hopes, he wanted to feel as if nothing had changed.
John, with his thumb over Sherlock's cheek, caressing the skin there. "It's okay, it was just a nightmare."
"What are we?", he asked loudly, startling John, who jumped and muttered a
That was surprising.
He wondered if Vermeer or Caravaggio ever hated what they painted.
The teacher arrived. A man in his fifties, definitely. So he had been born before the First World War! He taught history because he
Sherlock dragged a deep breath. "If you don't tell me right now what happened with John Watson I can swear to you I will find a way to demonstrate the illegality of what you do, documents will be provided, an investigation will be opened, and with a blink of an eye everything you've worked for would have fallen apart and you'll end up in jail. Now tell me." He said completely calm, his face expressionless.
I'm sorry for deleting this blog. I'm sorry you all lost both your favorite detective and the doctor who was always there for him, but I hope I can make it up to you as well. This blog will shelter our stories and our memories, our future and our past. It will be an insight of the life of a madman and a man who's forgotten too much, but most of all, it will be the record of our time together.
“This painting is unfinished because he killed himself. Don’t you see it?”, he said, turning to look at Sherlock, waving his hands in the air.
it was a joke and he was creating false illusions. No. He wasn't creating anything. And Sherlock because he didn't want to look at John shaking his head, looking down and walking away.
------------------------------
John rolled his eyes, “Sherlock-”
"I hear you."
" Sherlock said lowly.
It took them around two hours to search the whole flat and Sherlock was furious. He had been so certain that this case was solved, that Hawthorne was the one behind the murders, but nothing.
He stared into John's eyes, they were dark and wide, and he was breathing hard already. "God, they better discharge you today or I'll sue them. I need you now, in 221B."
“Which question?”, Sherlock said, even though he already knew which it was and he didn’t want to answer it.
"Pills." John said, surprised.
John stood behind him. Sherlock heard the sigh of relief. “You- you had a- a flashback.”
That night turned out to be quite disturbing for John. After talking to the detective, he went straight to his flat, too exhausted to do anything else. He didn't eat, he just went to sleep.
"...Hello."
Definitely not the greaser.
Also, I'd like to thank
“What are you drawing?”
"Did I?"
He felt strangely warm. That was it.
“Are you serious?”, John said with a frown. “It’s a city!”
On their first class together, Sherlock had told him he thought of the body as a musical composition.
“Then
are very illogical and inconsequential”, John replied stubbornly.
He was dead, forsaken and forgotten. He just hoped that something would bring him back to life.
Blue was always associated with feeling blue. Yet John’s face seemed to find the warmth amidst the cold. That was what John liked about the photograph. That was what he hated about the photograph.
Sherlock feigned indignance.
John looked up to him through half-lidded eyes and a soft smile that later turned into a yawn. Sherlock stopped at the entrance of the bedroom and couldn't help but smile back, taking in the sight of a sleepy, naked, John, with his hair disheveled and with the early sun's reflection bathing his skin with traces of gold. He was so lucky. He was so lucky of being able to see John like this, positively
"... Talked to him in a long time, and every time he called we ended up fighting, he didn't come back in here, he was everywhere, looking for a place to stay..."
John licked at his earlobe.
*******
They arrived to a place that looked nothing like the studio from the photograph.
John sighed, wondering if the greaser had lost his mind. He shook his head.
"Of course I'm right. There is nothing left to tell, John! Nothing about me!"
"I don't know, but I hope he takes his time to come back because I wouldn't be capable of looking at him right now, I would probably pee."
“WHAT?”, John said, jumping.
"He suggested them. I didn't know they existed. Not until then. He had met them because of his friends. I
John shook his head. "You're crazy."
It felt so good to say that name again and actually be standing in front of the person who responded to it. In Serbia, Sherlock had said it so many times, as some kind of last resource, as the only way to keep his mind awake, to stop himself from slipping into unconsciousness. He knew what would happen if he went unconscious.
"But, Sherlock, you looked so happy!"
John took his hands off his face and jumped in surprise as soon as he saw Sherlock standing so close to him.
His hands were once again holding onto the lapels of his jacket, this time pushing towards their bedroom, the bedroom they had shared for the last month. They hadn't been...sexually engaged since Sherlock had been discharged from hospital, mostly because John felt that Sherlock's wound might give them trouble, but now Sherlock felt immune to pain and immortal.
John knew better than that, he didn't believe a word of what he said. Not one. "You saved her life..."
Then John went on with a string of
Sherlock sighed, closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He was breathing hard, exhausted for all the things he had already done so far this day. When he finally caught his breath he replied. "What did you do to John Watson?"
“They are- erm”, he cleared his throat, “rather good, John.”
Apparently the smile wasn't enough to conceal his disappointment, because Greg realised John actually
Sherlock rolled his eyes but nodded. "It was as if he had never seen me before. He asked me who I was." Behind the detective's apparent composure hid a hint of despair, of bitterness and sadness. It was the first time he opened to Greg.
“Ugh. Do shut up, Doctor Watson”, Melissa said, pulling a disgusted face.
He knew Mike was a fine photographer. They had gone to art school together and had been friends back then. Mike didn’t find success as fast as John did, but now he was starting to gain recognition. The collection was about the artists and their studios, and it wanted to show that, just as romance made people unromantic, it seemed like an artists’ studio made artists so unartistic. People were captivated by the gallery.
Sherlock’s mind raced. A thousand thoughts appeared there. Were they really not? Sherlock had just had the thought that him and John had never been just friends, and Sherlock left John and John went to get him erased from his mind, and there was no other way Sherlock could define the pain in his chest while John made that little speech in front of his grave rather than ‘the pain of loss’, a kind of pain that would accompany him, haunt him for the next eighteen months before coming back, seeing John again and finding out he had erased him from his mind, only to feel that pain of loss once again. A pain of loss he still felt.
When he realised, he opened his eyes, and felt an odd sensation crippling inside of him. Most of all, he hated the familiarity of the situation, it was like a deja vu, as if he had lived this a thousand times before. It was the white painting everywhere and the smell of clinic and the
John sighed. "
John shook his head and followed him. Before they entered to the room where the wife had been murdered, John grabbed Sherlock's arm and turned him so he could face him. "Sherlock. What do you want me to do?"
"Are you sure? You don't have a clue on who could have left the message?"
John shook his head, uncertain if he should be boiling with anger or laughing. He stood up impulsively, telling himself it was the best choice.
A sound somewhere, closer.
"Where is it?" Sebastian asked.
"Are you okay, little brother?"
Sherlock looked down.
“Eager, aren’t we?”, he said between kisses.
“So to you.”
John smiled and kept doing so.
Sherlock couldn't articulate a word, he was... Confused? He wasn't even sure if he was confused. He was... Distracted. Definitely distracted.
John nodded. “I’m fine”, he replied, taking a deep breath.
It was 5:30 and they had already done a huge part of the work. It turned out Sherlock knew lots of things about chemistry, and they worked surprisingly good together. Mrs Hudson entered to Sherlock's... laboratory, carrying two glasses of milk and two slices of apple pie. "Hello, my boys!"
He asked as if what he had just said was meaningless, as if it shouldn't matter that John was no longer in charge, as if Sherlock shouldn't worry about that fact that John saw him and left, that John abandoned this, abandoned him. He asked as if the earth was still moving, as if the very cores of it hadn't collided piece by piece, he asked as if life kept on, as if it was a minor happening and nothing else, as if the world was the same place it had been five seconds ago.
He tried as best as he could. He really did.
He smiled weakly and Hikes entered to the classroom, now they had to organize it and shake the erasers he and John hadn't done last time. That had been a great detention. This one was... Boring.
Sherlock looked at him and stood silent. "Huh?"
It didn’t work.
He leaned and kissed his mother on her cheek. "We'll be right back. Love you, mom."
It felt as if two hours had just passed. Sherlock's left hand was clenching and unclenching into fists as he fought the urge to just yell at the cabbie to drive faster.
"Let me see the body."
He looked up immediately, following the sound of that desperate voice.
"This! All of this! Maybe start by explaining what your brother was doing here."
table. Harry was there, laughing. Probably she had no idea of what Jim had done to her brother, she wouldn't have allowed that. And then it was Jim. Serious, focused, not listening to any of them. Sebastian looked at him worriedly, Greg was just eating his lunch without doing any comments and not a single sign of Sherlock.
She stared at him, as if waiting for something from him.
“Is it? Maybe I wasn’t thorough enough with the observation-”, Sherlock said, a tinge of nervousness in his voice.
What? Sherlock asked himself. Because hell, that was wrong. How could John not be living there anymore? That was their home. 221B was everything. He stared at Mycroft silently. Then swallowed, turned towards the other end of the room and replied a simple, small “Oh.”
He tried to breathe deeply, but it only hurt him more. The movement of the chest hurting the wound.
Project due for Monday.
"And then got drugged to get him back."
"What are you looking at Watson? Get out."
He walked over the huge cracks on the floor, right in the middle of the gallery. They were mended, but the scars were still there. He looked down and wondered how on earth a crack on the floor could ever be considered a work of art.
He couldn't deny he felt a bit uncomfortable with that outfit, but with the nervousness he was feeling at the moment he couldn't care less about the way he looked.
Or perhaps he just overdosed and this was his hallucination.
His phone chimed. He looked at it in a hurry, knowing in the depths of his mind that it wouldn't be what he expected it to be, yet holding the endless, hateful hope that
Harry went out of his bedroom and looked even worse than John. As she looked at him she opened her eyes widely and made a very, very worried face.
His lower lip trembled when he started, “Be-before you erased me from your memory I had been gone for a year and a half.”
Sherlock turned it on, then turned on the radio and looked at John. "Do you mind?"
John stood up, almost kicking the chair down as soon as he did so. He raised a hand, as if distancing himself from Sherlock and warning him to not come any closer. Sherlock stopped in his tracks, mentally kicking himself for having done
"Sorry, John", he said. "I know it wasn't your fault. We're just under a lot of stress."
But it was him who had pushed him to the limits.
Sherlock walked hurriedly towards the player and pressed the 'stop' button. He felt the air leaving his lungs, his heart racing, his hand shaking. He opened his mouth, no voice came out of it. He closed it, opened it again, but still no sound. Finally, he found a tiny thread, the slightest hint of a voice, and barely above a whisper, all he managed to say: "John."
"I don't know what you're talking about."
Of course, this was easier when John was here.
Yet, he felt the heat from John's arm, the warmth, the comfort.
Greg rubbed his forehead. They had reached the cafeteria. He looked at Sherlock for a moment and the sight helped him make a decision. "I'll see what I can do. You stay here." He said, pointing at him with his finger, enunciating an unspoken menace.
Sherlock nodded stubbornly. "Boring. Boring. Boring."
"Oh come on, Holmes, stop it."
John turned, and Sherlock could
Sherlock threw his shirt to the floor and John turned at the sound, he walked to the back of the chair. Sherlock was starting to feel sleepy and dizzy and all he wanted was to get it done with and get some sleep.
Hikes stood up and so did John, who shook his hand and said "Goodbye, sir. Thank you, and again, I apologize."
"Sherlock! You let me be beaten! Do you think I can just
He softly and slowly wiped him. Sherlock’s smile widening. “Thank you”, he whispered.
“The junction between the cornea and the sclera!”
"There were two victims. Where is the other one?"
John planted kisses along Sherlock’s jaw, soft, feather-like kisses which sent shivers down Sherlock’s spine.
As they left, Sherlock laughed. John looked at him raising an eyebrow. "What is so funny?"
Although to be fair, it wouldn’t be the first time that a fan of their blog would develop a psychopathic obsession towards them.
Sherlock stared for a moment, and a tiny smile drew itself in his lips. "Oh, he planned it ahead. He planned it and followed her until he found her working place, and decided to join, to befriend her and create an alibi. How appropriate. Is he still working there?"
He stood still, bent on the floor, closing his eyes. John felt far away, too far away.
His mom, surprisingly enough, trusted Sherlock. He had no idea how, but that day the greaser and his mother met, Sherlock had been able to convince her he was a good guy despite his clothes and his attitude. She didn't have a single problem with John going to his house, and she was glad he was John's friend. John knew that his mother worried a lot about him being lonely, but truth was he didn't feel lonely at all. He didn't need people like the rest of the world seemed to need people, he didn't care not having someone to talk to, he could find answers in his books. That was until he met Sherlock.
"I'm going home now." Sherlock said turning his back against Irene.
John stood up and walked around the room, “of course I know, Sherlock! But that doesn’t make it less real. I don’t know how to make it go away. It will take over my art”, he said, the last word sounding muffled, as John struggled with an emotion he didn’t want to deal with at the moment.
"Yes, there's something-"
“Shhhh”, John said softly as he assessed the wound.
"For my sister, I mean, I-"
As he closed his eyes, the only thing he could possibly think about was that John’s lips tasted like Orange Autumn.
"What?" Sherlock asked, profoundly confused.
-------------------
Greg nodded. "Yes, he helps us once in a while." Sherlock snorted. "...Occasionally." Greg corrected, looking at Sherlock.
laugh and John thought he should do that more often, as it highlighted his...features. "You are
John stopped laughing. “Who is it from?”
John laughed. “I know, I know. Still.”
John understood what she meant with every statement. "Jesus, Harry, no. No, it's just-" he swallowed.
John and Sherlock stood still for a moment, neither of them daring to move.
And then, just as fast as the effect started, it ended. Just like that. That wasn't supposed to happen, was it? The effects usually lasted more than an hour, sometimes he still felt the effects after a day, when the dose was too much. What was wrong with this one?
read his mind. He was struck by Sherlock’s intelligence and perception. He sighed, “you don’t know that.”
"Oh." John said relieved.
She smiled. "I know, people can be so intolerant, but don't worry, I don't mind..." She winked at them.
"8:46" Sherlock replied curiously.
“Yes. He looked fine. And, the clinic’s name is Lacuna, not exactly a clinic for illness.”
He felt the blood pumping through his veins and maybe it was because he was being called 'doctor' or because Sherlock was right next to him, but it was exciting, and terrifying at the same time. Just like what he used to have with Sherlock. But not anymore.
"To get a milkshake." Sherlock said as if it was the most normal thing in the world.
"Oh, don't come with that utter bullshit! You keep your plans secret from him and you keep that woman's messages from him! Promise it! It's about him, please, I need you to know."
The greaser got out of the car fixing his leather jacket and sighing in relief at the sight of the boy, who looked terrified, but with no gun wound, while John kept his mouth wide open in surprise. "Hello, John." He said avoiding the eye contact with John, and trying to sound as nonchalant as possible, he made his way towards the house, followed by the boy, who kept his eyes fixed on him, questioningly.
Sherlock stared at him.
Sherlock bit his lip but didn't reply.
Sherlock couldn’t reply. He couldn’t find the words to do so. He couldn’t find his voice.
“Nope.”
He took another breath. It smelled of oil paint and of Autumn Orange and of Sherlock Holmes.
"I mean it. I'm sorry for ruining
Perhaps Sherlock was getting it all wrong, perhaps it had been another motive, perhaps Michael
"Who?"
talking about the project now."
"I don't understand why I'm being monitored, though..."
"Fine. It
Lestrade turned to look through the window, but Sherlock could tell from his tone that the hideous smirk was still in place, "good. I'm glad."
But he just…stayed silent.
"Take this one". Sherlock told John, handling a doctor robe, which wasn't his and was also too big for him, but John obeyed and put it on. He felt a pinch of excitement and smiled widely. Sherlock looked at him up and down. "It certainly fits you, Doctor."
Now, in front of Sherlock, John smiled. John smiled and clenched his jaw.
before, he has no idea what love is like."
“I asked where were you heading to. Maybe we could share a cab.”
"So, about yesterday..." She said getting a bit more serious.
"Oh, I'm sorry, John. But hey, at least you get to drive it!"
“I’ve improved, I’ve gotten better. I want more, Sherlock.”
"Hey, Sherlock."
Sarah grinned at him as soon as she saw him, she looked different, she had a beautiful hairdo and a lovely dress, and it felt somehow different to see her outside of school, John grinned back. "I thought you wouldn't come! Come on in! Everyone's here already!"
Sherlock scoffed. "Well, you imagined he was black so..."
Because I know this won't be easy. None of it. He died. I forgot him. He came back. I didn't know who he was. I hated him. I forgave him. It's never been easy for us, but I'll take anything, because I had a glimpse of a life without Sherlock Holmes, and I prefer any scrape of him I can get.
“The very, very best”, Sherlock replied petulantly.
Sherlock smiled and looked at John again. "Yes. Sorry about that."
"Your lies. We've had the same argument, over and over and over. And you're right. Maybe we'll never see the end of it. Maybe I will never ever know you at all. Maybe you'll always be the stupid greaser you're always pretending to be, and maybe I will never fit with that, maybe I will never understand that."
John eyed it hesitantly.
1. This had to happen. It really had. It has its own reason, so don't look at it as something bad for their story, but as something that's building their story. Things had to be said, they had been keeping too much for themselves.
“Hmm, we’ll see about that”, John said flirtingly as he stood up and wrapped his arms at Sherlock’s neck before kissing him deeply and thoroughly. Sherlock
"Yes." He nodded.
“Fine, fine. Maybe that’s true, but I might want to put other body parts floating around in my paintings, wouldn’t I?”
"Of course! I don't want those idiots-" she said pointing towards the greaser's table. "-to ruin our night!"
A zodiac killer. Only with the alphabet. Boring. Dull and annoyingly predictable and yet he hadn’t realized of it. How could he have not? He had been disappointingly slow and stupid with this case.
"Don't be silly! What happened with Sherlock?" She said with a look both expectant and worried.
When he finally reached him, Greg took a look of the hall, trying to see if they were alone. Clearly, he didn't want to be seen talking to someone like John, who rolled his eyes and wanted to end the conversation as soon as possible.
Sherlock shrugged, smiling softly. “It worked. We both knew it, I think.”
And that was enough to bring color into any place.
“You only did what you thought was better. It was the right choice. Mines were not.”
John did so, his hand firm and soft as it moved through the paper.
"Are you sure you're okay?" Sherlock asked John as soon as they arrived back to the school. John had been silent all the way back and Sherlock just kept looking at him worriedly.
Sherlock still had his eyes shut closed. But he felt John’s soothing voice, so close to him. “Hey, Sherlock. Come back to me.”
"Good, good!" She said nodding up and down, up and down, up and down and smiling. "I'm good too. Have you seen Clara? I lost her... I think I saw her like an hour ago. Oh! That song!" She said yelling. "I LOVE that song!"
him? No. No. Definitely not. He didn't love John. Love was too big of a word. He smiled again and looked at Irene and they started talking, maybe this would wake him up from his stupidity. Love. What a joke.
There was the echo of the raindrops falling over the rotten ceiling. There was no other sound, it was silent. Way too silent.
eyebrow
"My, oh my." Another voice said. "Look who fell down again." Victor smiled at him, his face getting closer and closer to Sherlock's. "I told you this would happen, because this,
job won't be the one at stake."
"There was a wound in his forehead. It was bleeding. Around two inches. It needed stitches, I'm certain, he'd lost blood because of that wound-", he kept explaining, but Mycroft pushed him back again, this time more decidedly.
Sherlock felt a bit
And John had a flashback to the first time they met and he thought the greaser had finally recovered his sanity and he was expecting the punch, but then all he felt was the eraser hitting on his face, and he was blind. Well, there was chalk all over his glasses, so he was disabled.
“You stopped eating and sleeping.”
And Sherlock's self-control slipped off him, and he couldn't help himself from opening his mouth, "John", he whispered, and it came out so broken that he wished John hadn't listened at all.
"But I never asked you to quit it, I knew you loved it."
"Sherlock, calm down!" He heard a voice behind him saying.
Chapter 4 is here! Sorry it took so long to update, but I was away and I didn't have time to write it. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it! This is getting interesting! Chapter 5 is on the way! And will be uploaded faster than 4. Thanks to everyone who left kudos and comments! It means a lot! x
Lestrade's words came back to him often:
Mycroft was smirking and raised an eyebrow. "The car stopped in front of the house an hour ago, get out."
"...I used to deduce people and my mother didn't like that so she took me to a therapist. Psychiatrist, is the right term."
John turned to look at him with a raised eyebrow. "Are you okay?", he asked half-jokingly, half-worriedly.
Mycroft's face remained stoic. "He doesn't?"
John shook his head, "You are crazy! I can't do that!"
Oh, and please read the notes at the end. There's a little surprise for you.
*******
He looked away.
He couldn't leave. Not until he made sure he was fine.
"Leave me ALONE!" Sherlock yelled.
*******
John froze as well. He reacted as soon as Sherlock said:"I'm out of here."
John held the hope things would change a bit once they had History class. They did not. As he entered the classroom, Sherlock was already there and didn't pay attention to him at all. John thought he preferred when Sherlock bullied him, when he rolled his eyes at him, anything,
Sherlock sighed inwardly because of course John knew all of that, of course he did, he had been here before, yet he felt the need to say it, he felt the need to make that evening perfect.
Sherlock smirked, knowing he had won this time. John rolled his eyes and a shiver passed down his body, because Sherlock was angry and he was rude and he was going to kick his ass. Not a difficult assumption to make. "Let's go, nerd."
John breathed loudly. "I don't like it either, but we have to choose a topic!"
"I'm off to class." Sherlock said moving from the car and away from the girl, followed by Sebastian and Greg who smiled foolishly when they passed in front of her.
“Thank you”, Sherlock said as she opened the door, “-for your help.”
I'm so sorry for taking so long to update, although you're probably used to that :( this chapter is my redemption though, so enjoy! :3 thank you so much for reading and supporting this little one! x
"You can come if you want to. Body found in the Thames."
“Right”, John said, lowering his tone. “The shapes, slowly tiny galaxies connecting themselves around the black hole of the pupil, right?”
He had a case to solve. The most important case of all.
"You tell me."
Just this once.

John shook his head. “No. That’s”, he cleared his throat, “that’s exactly the color I used. I hadn’t seen it in ages. I used to love it.”
connection. Um. We go to the same school. We see one class together. That's all."
her, how didn't he realize of the mistake he made? Then he remembered: his brother was behind this, he fooled him, he always does that.
John smiled. "Greg, I'm fine. Just a bit...dizzy."
He ignored them and concentrated on the screeching violin breaking inside of his head.
"Together? Like the two of you?" She said surprised and questioningly.
he thought, and without hesitation, took a sip. It tasted like shit, but after two or three sips it felt... better.
Sherlock wanted to ask all of those questions to Mycroft, they were almost forcing themselves out of his mouth, but he couldn't, he couldn't show Mycroft how much he needed the answers, how much he

"Well, good luck with that." Sherlock took his violin and turned to the window, playing a song.
options just to stand with one."
Sherlock frowned as he stared at his phone. He didn’t look particularly interested in the conversation but he didn’t look annoyed either. “Who?”
John was about to ask what happened today but then he remembered, and immediately his back started hurting. The greaser kept his eyes fixed on him. "You don't have to keep apologizing."
Sherlock looked at him, looking slightly nervous. He looked beautiful. His hair sticking to his forehead, small drops of sweat falling down his face.
As soon as the guitar solo was finished, Sherlock leaned closer to John and whispered into his ear."Look at that!
"Of course I'm sure, Harry!"
Sherlock shrugged.
greaser
Sherlock frowned. “No! No, no. I’m not going to hospital. I’m perfectly fine.”
Sherlock didn't turn and barely answered. "History, English and chemistry."
Molly smiled at him and threw a dismissive hand. "It's okay. I'm fine, by the way. How have you been?"
He had seen it ever since he stared at John’s painting for the very first time, but since then his brain would drown itself trying to come out with the variables and the possibilities hidden inside John Watson’s world.
Lestrade stared at the detective in front of him. He felt completely shocked, from head to toes, he was still frozen on the door, unable to move. "I'll call you back, Donovan." He said seriously, putting his phone down.
Melissa frowned. “Why? Is it because of Alice?”
“Anything can be painted.”
"Okay, come on in." She said walking towards the door.
She made a big 'O' with her mouth. "The boy."
"I was taken other two times to rehab, but it never worked, it didn't. It was agony, I had to face the same four walls, I felt trapped, my brain was draining and all I had was rock and roll music. And it healed me somehow, well temporarily at least. It's always temporary, isn't it?" His face suddenly lit up a bit, recalling an experience. "Until I met Scotland Yard."
Lestrade smiled weakly. "Well, I don't blame him, I understand how he felt."
---------------
Sherlock was beautiful, with the sun highlighting his hair and the reflection of his dark blue dressing gown imprinted in the window. He recorded that image in his mind and promised himself to reproduce it in a canvas, for this was the complete opposite of
"Oh come on! That doesn't count, at all! Come on Johnny boy! I want to go to Brighton! Pleasey please?"
"Hikes thought he might help at the cafeteria." She said giggling.
And now John had walked away.
Sherlock ignored the feeling of disappointment at the loss of John’s warm fingers resting against his but he said nothing on it, he simply walked towards the crime scene.
“I don’t think you’re an ex-anything. You’re just too afraid of trying them again.”
"Thank you."
Sherlock cleared his throat and hesitated,
"You are one of those greasers, Harry."
Greg smirked. "Well, I think you should know Sherlock wasn't okay with that. He didn't like what they did. He was angry at them."
"Which John Watson?" John could barely mutter.
After a twenty minutes ride, they arrived to the High School. As soon as he parked, Harry got off. "Clara! Hi!"
"How late, John?"
" Irene said, running towards them.
Sherlock saw John storming into his room and he did the same, he was so angry, John didn't have to do that! How could he call his brother? What a stupid thing he had done!.
It was about her. It was always about her. John felt angry, not because Sherlock didn't tell him, but because he was protecting her, again. "Fine, it's okay, don't tell me anything. Fine. I just want to warn you something: you are falling right into her trap. She has you exactly where she wants to. Do you even remember what she did Sherlock?"
to know. "...Look, I know it's none of my business and I don't really care, but do you have a girlfriend?"
Victor threw his hands in the air. “It blocks away the pain! Can’t you see that? Wasn’t that why you kept taking them?”
“There’s no pleasure behind it, but for the pleasure grabbing a brush and creating a silhouette brings.”
He started unbuttoning John’s shirt.
He turned and looked up, finding a young girl standing in front of him, holding a cup and looking
Sherlock hummed. "She prefers jelly babies, but she doesn't like the green ones."
“Yes. Not going with you. But- sounds familiar, that’s all”, he cleared his throat, “continue, please.”
Which meant…there was
"They reacted quite well, actually." Sherlock lied.
It was actually happening.
He sat pushing John's desk. John felt a lot of anger towards this guy, it had been an accident, he didn't mean to crash with him, anyway it had been his fault too because he wasn't looking his path! Then why was he the only one who apologized? God, he really didn't like this new greaser.
He arrived early and looked around, no sign of the greaser nor of his brainless friends. He took his English book out of the locker and went to the classroom with a sigh.
Lestrade asked him about John, and Sherlock realized he had been distracted by the whole case. But now, remembering that John still hadn’t texted and apparently wasn’t interested in joining him on his cases, on going back to the life they used to have before, or at least on going back to be friends (something that, Sherlock would come to realize during his exile, was never something they really were, because they were always
"Do you want a pill or something?"
Sherlock didn't know where to start looking, so he went for the most logical option: if his brother couldn't tell him where the hell John Watson was, then Scotland Yard would.
Okay Sherlock needed to something about it now. He turned and felt a sudden rage and disgust with himself and had no one else to pour it into so he just looked at Mrs Hudson and yelled. "STOP TALKING NOW! JUST SHUT UP AND LEAVE ME ALONE!"
Standing in front of the door, Greg wondered if Sherlock had already talked to John, perhaps he would see them again, sitting on their chairs, chatting while having tea. He really hoped he could see them again like that. He was curious to know John's reaction, for him if had been the biggest shock of his life. He couldn't even begin to imagine how John Watson would feel after seeing the detective alive.
John shook his head, trying pointlessly to stop his body from shaking uncontrollably. "I'm sorry, I can't. I just... I can't do this, Sherlock. This is too much. I feel sick."
Melissa nodded. “He had access to all of it. All the files, all the information, the tapes, everything. It was only logical we’d think he’d be the first suspect.”
"Since when do they care?"
"How was it like, for you, these two years John?" - his voice sounded soft, very soft, in a very non-Sherlock tone. He tried to process it in his brain. No response. How was he supposed to answer to that?
Sherlock kiss the top of his head again. "Always", he replied.
Without opening his eyes, he counted 64 heartbeats in a minute. So almost normal.
John’s hold weakened, it faltered.
Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen.
"They are idiots! What if he's losing his vital signs? What if there's something wrong in his head? What if he passes out again? I need to see him!" He said, unable to hide his despair.
"Please get some rest, doctor Watson. You need it. And do try to eat something."
As soon as he said that, three men who were also wearing those jackets looked at him, then looked at each other and smiled, one of them came close to the scene and looked at the greaser who was standing in front of John, kicking him in the arm, with a huge smile on his face. "Heeey! You must be the new one! Well done you! I'm Jim and this is my...gang. Wanna join?"
"Fine. So, a little break huh?" John said moving towards the desk and taking a slice of apple pie and a glass of milk.
The greasers immediately shut up and looked at John in surprise. He then realized he had said "Sherlock". Whoops. Sherlock frowned and turned to look at John, standing in front of him, and he looked so tall, and John was so small.
“It’s cold and I’d like to-talk to you in private.”
John grabbed him by his chin and turned his face so he could have a proper look at him. Sherlock tried to focus on John’s eyes but his head was still hurting. “Sherlock?”
"Are you done?", Sherlock said, walking towards the door and opening it.
John's eyes closed and he lost balance slightly. He focused enough to ask, "are you certain?"
John smiled at him. “It was”. He thought he’d be angry, damn it, he
"Did you call me, Dr. Hawthorne?"
In all honesty, he didn’t even know what to expect, nor how to expect it, but he couldn’t help feeling slightly- disappointed at their lack of communication. It made him wonder. What if-?
John couldn't fight the tears any longer. "I just... I worry so much about her... I don't want to see her hurt, I don't know what to do."
Jim looked at him up and down. "Because everybody wants to hang out with us."
Sherlock smiled sarcastically. "I think that's even obvious to you."
John walked and stopped right in front of him. He bent down. Sherlock’s eyes closed and he kept his head down. “No”, he heard John say in a very soft tone, “no Sherlock, you didn’t.”
"No, really, it's okay. We can stay, if you want to."
But he started to worry when his mind went black.
When dinner was over, Sherlock offered to wash the dishes but Mr Watson said sharply. "No. Harriet will wash them."
"Well, she is back."
He took out his phone and sent a message to his brother, the only person who had his actual number.
“There”, he dragged a deep breath, “something went wrong. Very, very wrong. I had it all planned, I had worked it all out, it had to work… but then it didn’t”, he felt a surge of rage taking over himself. He sighed, “And they caught me.”
“He entered this morning to a clinic.”
“I don’t want to buy one yet. Not yet.”
Sherlock remained silent. He couldn't find words.
"You really should-"
Sherlock's phone beeped with a message alert. He ignored it.
John served the breakfast as Sherlock sat and started talking about a new case, it was surprising how he was avoiding Moriarty's message. He didn't want to think about it, though he couldn't help but think about it all the time. This was the only moment since the day before that Sherlock had found some peace, it was nice talking to John again, they both looked so happy, they were the best of friends, as if nothing happened.
Among many other things, Harry had told John that if the party was supposed to be at seven, people would arrive an hour or so later, but he dismissed it. Honestly, the people Harry went to parties with was quite different from the kind of people who would attend this party, so at 7:15 he was already knocking on Sarah's door.
He grimaced, andhearing John's voice, he threw them into the grass, feeling disgusted with himself. Great. Another feeling to add to his expense collection of things he wasn't strong enough to avoid.
John stared at him silently, then he laughed, one of those hateful humorless laughs.
Melissa shrugged, “we can’t tell. There are so many folders that we can’t possibly keep track of all of them.”
------------
And John came.
greaser
Sherlock lifted his chin in a salute and entered the car, where Johnny Cash sounded loudly. "Go, go, go, my brother will arrive soon!" And Greg accelerated.
John turned to look at nurse Stephens looking at them, her arms crossed. "You're not supposed to be here, Doctor Watson", she said firmly but good-naturedly.
"Are you sure you want to sleep here tonight? You're going to freeze!"
John smiled as he leaned closer and stared at the heavy brushstrokes of the painting, and he could almost picture Van Gogh painting them as he poured every single thought of his mind and every single emotion of his soul into the light of the stars. They were yellow. Strokes in spiral, strokes with shape, strokes with lines, strokes that looked so full of painting, they were able to bring life to the picture.
It was lunchtime and John was still angry and not knowing what he was angry about made him even angrier. Mike was sitting next to him and looked at him a little worried. "Alas John, are you alright? You haven't even touched your food." He said pointing to John's untouched lunch with his fork.
Mycroft's face was hatefully expressionless. He didn't look amused nor surprised, he simply stared at Sherlock. "It speaks volumes that the only good thing you had left in your life was the thing that would end it."
"Sarah's."
Perhaps John had changed his mind. Of course he would. Perhaps John realized of who Sherlock really was and decided that it wouldn’t be a great idea to learn from him. Perhaps John only saw all of this as a joke. Perhaps perhaps perhaps. Sherlock looked down at his clock impatiently. John had said he’d be there at 7, it was 7:02 already and John wasn’t coming. John was definitely not coming.
John raised an eyebrow.
He stood up and left. John felt confused, he knew Sherlock was a drama queen, but this was different, he wasn't faking it, Irene's message caught him off guard and brought him back to reality. Something wasn't right. Sherlock knew how to hide his feelings perfectly. But that message seemed to change something within him, John didn't know what, but that wasn't the Sherlock Holmes he used to know. This was some kind of hurt, shocked, surprised Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock leaned closer and they just stood like there, their foreheads touching and their mouths
Sherlock, without saying another word, opened the door wider. John entered, taking a bit of time to climb up the stairs as he was holding his cane, and in the meanwhile, the detective could realize John's left hand was clenching and unclenching into fists. He grimaced. That was not good. Not good at all.
know.
have a point. They had never worked together, not properly. There would come a day when they would have to be apart for real, and then Sherlock would become just a memory for him. It was the way things had to be. It was unavoidable.
car so I drive as fast as I want to. Clear?"
They stared at each other for a long, silent while. God, it felt like it had been ages since they had last done that, that thing where the rest of the world ceased to exist and all there was left to the humankind was John Watson’s dark blue eyes fixed on Sherlock’s gray/blue/green ones. And that was enough to save humankind, somehow.
Well, what could he do?
John frowned and stood by the door, thinking he wouldn't be welcome.
Harry's eyes widened and her jaw dropped, then she chuckled. "The new boy? Sherlock? Sherlock Holmes? You can't be possibly saying that that bird chose you!"
Then an awkward silence fell. And all he wanted was to get out of that bus and light a cigarette but damn it! He couldn't smoke in school!
"Get out, Watson." Sherlock said calmly. Dangerously calmed.
Sherlock clasped his hands behind his back and nodded sharply. Lestrade stared at John frowning. Silence fell in the room and Greg felt the need to fulfill it because this was just getting more and more awkward. "Um...we just wanted to check how you were..."
John nodded.
"Sherlock, you haven't gotten any new clues since you sat here, simply because you can't stop thinking about him-", Sherlock opened his mouth to reply but Lestrade pointed at him menacingly. "So stop scratching your arm and go see him, go make sure he's safe. We won't make any improvement until we have the files."
John looked down. “Answer me first.”
Sherlock frowned, rising his voice. "No, I don't!"
Sherlock didn't close the door so the boy stepped inside, tilting his head to the side.
"I'm sorry for ruining everything with Sherlock."
"No. I'm fine, I will be back in a moment." John said standing up. Mike nodded and kept talking to his friends, who seemed oblivious to John's state.
No. That was stupid. He had his own style and he was happy with it. He had learned to love it. He had explored it and analyzed it and over analyzed it. He studied the paintings from the absolute best, and he loved their need to resemble reality.
"What?"
?" John asked, deepening his frown.
And call it stupidity or romanticism or...stupidity, but Sherlock thought, for flitting seconds, that that was enough.
For the worst.
He looked at Sherlock, feeling confused. Sherlock was absorbed in what he was drawing, not even realizing that John was staring at him.
John cleared his throat. "Okay, okay. Sure, I'll try not to take too much time."
John shrugged.
Sherlock was already grabbing his coat and walking out the door.
Mike bit his lip. “Right, so, my exhibition at the gallery was extended for two months more after the reception”, he said with a smile.
“Why are you looking at that old thing?”, John said, pointing at the painting and being unable to hide his disgust.
Sherlock wanted to smile at how cheesy and yet how absolutely
Mrs Hudson shrugged with a small smile. Mycroft stood up from his chair. Sherlock turned and barely said "Good night, Mycroft. Please don't disturb us."
"Good night to you too."
He stopped dead.
It always went downhill from there. This time they were running. Running and running and running. John could almost feel the thrill of the chase pumping through his veins, could almost hear Sherlock's voice encouraging him
"So..." Sherlock asked, placing both hands below his chin, his face falling apart. He didn't feel capable of finishing that sentence.
Sherlock sighed, he kept his eyes fixed on the book but slowly shook his head.
Harry leaned closer to him and told him in a murmur: "Seize this chance. Don't blow it, idiot. I need to know all the details tomorrow."
"Yeah I'm fine." He said after a while.
It was at times like this when Sherlock was hit with the constant reminder that caring was
Sherlock lifted the tape the police had placed surrounding the house and turned to look at John, expectantly. "Well?"
Sherlock stood still for a moment, speechless, feeling not only embarrassed but also at an absolute loss of words. “I- erm”
He opened his eyes as soon as his orgasm dissipated to find that John had just reached that point, and it was the most spectacular sight he'd ever seen. Locked and sealed, directly into his mind palace, along with the feeling of John pulsing against his skin.
was never one of them. "Sweet?" He said confused.
John nodded, encouraging him to continue. Somehow, John felt like all the wounds left by that accident to his sister and Sherlock were healing. He was healing as well.
“Stop doing that to yourself.”Sherlock said in a moment of weakness. He wanted to help Victor, he really did. “You’re killing yourself slowly and painfully!”
Sherlock sat on his bed and patted John to sit in there and John's heart was threatening to get out of his chest. "Take a seat."
The memories. All of them were lost.
"Nothing, still trying to find something that might give us a little hint of the kind of criminal we're dealing with. But I think the lack of evidence describes us exactly the man who is behind this. But it can't be, John!, it can't!. I saw him take his own life! How can he be alive?" -Sherlock looked desperate, scared, terrified. It wasn't something he saw very often, and definitely he wouldn't wish to see ever again.
John looked at him with a frown. "Consulting detective?"
John stood with his back against the door, smiling like an idiot.
"Yeah, thanks for the visit."
Wrong about the facts and wrong about the murderer and wrong about himself and wrong about John. Wrong wrong wrong.
Sherlock stood quiet for a moment. Then he looked at Greg and invented an excuse, anything better than
He had known that for a very long time, but John had made him feel as if he could win it, as if he was enough strong to defeat all the demons crawling inside his head.
John didn't feel offended, he had the right of not knowing who this Presley was. He didn't change his expression and kept his eyes on the road. "I guess I am
"I'm up, mommy! Don't worry!"
"Sherlock. Holmes." He said without looking at her.
"Why should I know?" Sherlock said shrugging.
"We can still...be friends."
"You are. You always will be."
This world was lonely and sad. And yet surprisingly magnetic. Dragging Sherlock in. Giving him that desperate itch to pain, to discover, to dig further.
Harry decided to change the subject, the opportunity was given, she was going to take it. "So, Sherlock, you slept with John last night..." She realized the best thing she could do was going straight to the point. Sherlock nodded, looking confused. "...What happened?"
"I didn't... Shove you. I just lead you towards it."
Chapter 3 is here! This one is considerably longer than the other two already posted, and in my opinion, is far much more interesting! A very particular character is arriving: Harry Watson! Well, this is exactly the way I imagine Harry Watson is like. Chapter 4 could take a while to upload because I won't be around very much next week, but enjoy this one! This is getting exciting! ;)
It was 1 p.m and John and Harry were still feeling pretty bad. They looked terrible, too. They were playing cards without much talking, John was still wondering where Sherlock might be, but he tried not thinking about it, because he couldn't stop wondering what he had possibly said. He heard a noise downstairs and thought he was back. He felt incredibly nervous and anxious, he was dying to talk to him. It was most definitely Sherlock.
She shrugged. “He is not a celebrity. He just used to have a very popular blog in which he wrote cases he lived with Sherlock Holmes.”
Finally, John broke the silence that had settled. "So yeah, I'm fine." He said as if he had never stopped talking.
A part of him maybe did.
"You sound so confident, Sherlock. How can you be so sure of every damn thing? How can you be so relaxed? Things just happen to work out for you!"
"I bet this is all because of Mike, is it?..."
John was looking down when they entered to the room. Melissa recognized him from the picture on his blog and that man didn't look like the picture at all. He was skinnier, had huge bags under his eyes, looked pale... He turned to stare at them and she lifted her hand awkwardly. "Hello."
"What?" Sherlock said frowning.
Sherlock grabbed his book and left in the opposite direction from John, thinking, clearly surprised by the way the boy had reacted, that was definitely unexpected, all of this situation was unexpected, John Watson in general was unexpected.
It hurt.
"For you?"
“John?”, he asked because he couldn’t stop himself.
-------------------------
Sherlock frowned. "How come?"
"Please, Dr Hawthorne.
Irene winked at him. "Ask Sherlock for it". Harry smiled and turned her face to John who was looking at her with a frown that could only possibly mean
However, his senses had gone numb.
"What?", Sherlock said with a frown.
"I'm sorry", he whispered against John's head. "I'm sorry it had to be this way. I never wanted to hurt you, John. Never."
several damage
"John!" Sherlock said almost anxiously and John turned again, the silly smile turning into a frown. He didn't reply, just stared at Sherlock. The detective took this as a good sign, forced himself to breath deeply and said slowly: "Short version, not dead."
"Oh, thanks John, I'm starving."
"And he just let you in?" John's mother said sarcastically and unconvinced.
He bent down and kissed him urgently, their kisses turning frantic and urgent. Sherlock kept touching John's chest, his ribs, his stomach, stopping over his heart.
“I went and got you erased from my mind. I can tell it was a feeling as strong as that one if it pushed me to do it so.”
"Hey!" John protested, smiling.
Sherlock sat in his chair, just in front of John.
"What happened? Did you realize he wasn't a drug dealer so he didn't match your style?" Mycroft said sourly.
Even better.
"Oh, I see", he said, his hands balling into fists. He stood up and looked at Sherlock with an expression akin to rage. "It's not about the leg, is it? You just think it might slow you down."
“Well, I’m glad you finally worked things out.”Greg said, leaning on one of the lockers. John had just passed by and thrown a shy smile at Sherlock, which he replied quickly, trying to avoid noticing by anybody else.
"It's okay if you don't want to tell me, I'll find out... Eventually."
"Yeah! If they wake up they'll think you're corrupting me and call your brother or something."
"It's physically painful watching you think so much. Just... Just enjoy this, us."
“Come.”
Sherlock looked at him seriously. "Tell me what upset you."
Sherlock looked down, he couldn’t help not to, “alright then”, he said lowly.
"Oh, you must be the new one, Holmes, right?"
, he said about the portrait of a young girl painting a still life filled with flowers and so on.
It was and at the same time it wasn’t, for it was painted in a thousand different colors which didn’t reflect reality at all, but which described London perfectly somehow. He couldn’t explain it.
Sherlock actually
The following days had passed incredibly fast, and when John realized it already was Thursday and oh god it was Thursday!
He stopped playing and looked at John. "Yes?"
“Perhaps you could use that time at an anger management course”, Sherlock replied.
"Don't", was all John replied, looking away and opening the door. He looked at Sherlock once again, the mask firm in place now. "Don't", he repeated, and then he walked away.
there.
A voice invaded his mind, blocking John's fading figure. A seductive voice, a voice he had eventually come to hate, but that had meant so much once.
He remembered Victor was the one who gave it to him. Of course, of course that idiot would have bought the cheapest pills he could find, and they weren't working at all! Just like the one he took after the party, they
John nodded. “I always liked that, yeah”, he said with a soft smile.
Sherlock stood in the middle between the living room and the kitchen, staring at John's back. "You aren't wearing a cane", he observed. "You're leaning your weight in both feet."
finally
"She just needs to sleep the high off", Sherlock said.
"Oh, I see, you are defending her and him now?"
"You for him.”
"I can't promise you that, he is my friend. I can't keep secrets from him"
John looked down. “Neither would I.”
Irene smiled. "Oh..."
Moran stood in the door and clenched his fists. "I told you to hurry! I wanted you to see by yourself who came with Holmes!"
He spoke lazily, slow and in a confusing tone. "Whaaaaaat?"
“That’s it.”
Sherlock knew he didn't but right now he didn't really care.
John laughed, “a lot.”
They entered and Mrs Hudson looked at them with a smile. "I'm so glad you worked things out!"
As soon as they were free, John grabbed Sherlock's jacket by its lapels, refusing to let him go, holding onto it with his everything, as if his very own life depended on it. As his memories were hidden into the fabric of the suit jacket.
Sherlock snorted. "Whatever!"
Maybe Sherlock was right, maybe he knew far too much about him. But no, he didn't. What was Sherlock even doing with the police last night? Why did he keep pretending? What about his friends? John still didn't know him at all. "Maybe you're right."
Completely and totally sucked.
John smiled. "Let's go!"
John moved apart from the desk and sat himself on the chair, the red one. He liked it. Sherlock always took the black one and it just felt natural going directly to the red chair, as if he’d claimed it from the very first time he sat on it.
--------------------
It was Saturday evening, and things were starting to get moving. He knew the man would be busy and it would be a good excuse for a fast talk, a warrant he would keep his answers short. That considering he would be willing to answer...
But it was never about them. These cases, they had existed long before Sherlock’s return, except-
John nodded, unable to erase that silly little smile off his face. "See you." He said, while his eyes roamed on the greaser's back as he made his way out of the classroom.
or how it resembles any other human arm you’ve seen in your life.”
Irene
He heard the greaser singing for the rest of the trip, only stopping to give John some indications as where to turn or which road to take. After a time without saying a word, John turned to look at Sherlock, who was staring out of the window and singing. And he smiled at the sight.
It was so different from their other kisses, so completely different that John felt as if it was their first kiss ever, and it was
He sighed as he entered the school and walked towards the lockers. He looked all over the place to see if Sebastian or Jim were near, because he certainly couldn't stand being pushed against the lockers again, not today. They didn't seem to be around. He opened the locker and a note fell right into his feet. He opened it, saw the
"What life if I'm not in it?" Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
Sherlock stood still. "...yes. Present from Mycroft."
*******
Sherlock raised his other eyebrow. She was definitely an amateur, if she didn’t know that Sherlock could not possibly care less about his own life, no matter how much he tried. His own existence had only ruined everything and everyone around him, and so if she killed him she would do him a favor. He didn’t reply.
“Sir?”
Sherlock stopped walking and was surprised to see that John stopped walking as well and had turned to look at him. He closed his eyes, drew a sharp breath, and simply said what he felt. "The only thought that has kept me on after all of this was that I would be allowed to talk to you once again, John.That I would get to explain, that you'll get to know all the things you've deleted. Closure, isn't that what you need? Isn't that what I need?"
Harry stared at Sherlock and really tried to suppress the laughter at seeing the greaser so
It was John's first kiss ever, and it should have been weird, it should have been awkward, it should have been disappointing. But somehow, it was perfect. It was just him and Sherlock, and he felt utterly comfortable and it just felt right. Wether he was a good kisser or not, he had absolutely no idea, but that didn't matter now. What mattered was that he was kissing Sherlock Holmes! How did that happen?
She smiled and leaned a bit closer to take a look at the room, but Sherlock blocked the view. "Oh!" She whispered. "Is John in here?"
“SO HAVE YOU!”
"I know nothing about it, I'm afraid."
"I'm afraid I'm not in the liberty to say."
"What?"
John leaned closer and smelled Sherlock. "Apparently so are you."
"I didn't take that from a song!"
This was going to break Sherlock. This was going to shatter his little brother piece by piece.
"Because I love you, John!"
"That never stopped you before did it?"
John shook his head. “You can’t ask me that.”
“Perhaps you could not do it again.”
John shouldn't be as excited as he was of going to school, he didn't what to admit the thought that was going through his mind:
Sherlock slumped himself in one of the chairs of Hawthorne's living room. "I don't have clues Lestrade", he whispered, bringing his hands to his head, "I don't have clues and John is involved and John could be in danger and I'm going nowhere-"
them,
John laughed and kept cooking the pasta. "We'll see."
Sherlock shook his head and if he looked a bit blanched at Melissa's implication, well that was just the light. He clenched his hand into a fist and found it difficult to speak up when he replied, "...no. But, but", he looked down, "he might be in danger. Please."
"Mike?" John asked questioningly.
It was past five when John left school, since Harry wasn't able to drive, Clara used to take her everywhere, and John enjoyed those moments of solitude when it was just him and his Chevy, driving over the fields. Although it was a very short ride, he enjoyed it, he really did.
Sherlock realized of it too and opened his eyes, looking fixedly at John. He laughed.
“Yes.”
He nodded, looking at the floor. As soon as the man left, he looked up and felt a rush of pain and anger. He hated school, he didn't want to go back to that hell.
“And then you licked your lips. I should have known. I should have known but I didn’t and I told you I was married to my work. And that was it.”
The crime scene was intact, the woman still laying over the typewriter, while the police tried to collect as much evidence as possible. Sherlock stood in front of the body. "She will be taken to the morgue soon, but for now, I want you to take a look at her. Closely. Tell me what you see."
"...this boy you fell in love with..." Irene said with a smile.
He hated the person he had become and the art that had made him famous. Now he only saw stripes and dots and stupidity and colors that didn't match and he asked himself how he had ever chosen this life in the first place.
amnesia?" Sherlock asked, he had quite clear what had happened now, but didn't dare to believe it.
"I needed to thank you, for everything. For saving my life. Thank you, Mr. Holmes, I would be buried right now if it wasn't for you".
Not for now. He couldn't go back to that hellhole called Rehab and he knew that his brother wouldn't fail his word. Too much was at stake and it wasn't worth it.
"Oh I do. I just want to make sure we're in the same page."
John knitted his eyebrows together and took a sip of tea. "No, not really. Why?" He said after he drank.
"It's the cross I have to bear." Sherlock said laughing.
standards", he hit back.
John certainly knew how to go, anyway.
he looked very upset!"
"What do you need my help for?" John said, exasperated.
John shook his head and smiled a bit. "...hi."
The thing Sherlock hated the most about the avant-gardes (their lack of details and their need to detach from reality) took a whole new meaning with John Watson: reality and colors and textures and shapes and all those elements from impressionism and surrealism were mixed there, with a
embarrassed.
"Life's getting tough, isn't it?" He heard after a while as someone whispered to his ear, he turned to look immediately, taking his glasses off and rubbing his eyes to make sure it was who he thought it was. Sherlock was sitting right next to him, leaned against the lockers too.
"I need to talk to one of your workers", Lestrade said, passing the folder to Melissa and opening it in front of her, "Alice Pollock. Working place: Lacuna Inc."
Sherlock gave him a reassuring smile and a nod. "I'm fine. The accident was long time ago, I just... I miss driving my rocket, listening to rock n' roll, feeling invincible. But it's fine."
Sherlock turned to look at him, surprised, “Oh.”
Sherlock considered his options, and he hated facing those fuckers people called his friends, yet he needed a cigarette
Blood flow not controlled yet.
"Good evening to you too, Sherlock." John recognized the voice immediately and widened his eyes. "I see you brought your little...
"Thinking. My apologies. Where's John?"
He sighed and entered to the classroom, not wanting to see his sister before turning away, because he suspected she knew all the things that were going through his mind.
Of course not.
"What? Okay. Thanks, I suppose. Not sure yet. Should I?"
John smiled. "I will always be there to support you, okay?"
“Is that my hand?”, John asked softly as he pointed towards the painting.
Melissa shut her mouth and looked down, a slight blush in her cheeks.
"Because I know what you're planning on doing, Sherlock. I know you will want to run away and leave him alone, because you think that'll save him. But it hasn't. It won't. It's not your choice to make."
John cleared his throat and nodded. "Yeah. No one answered the doorbell, so I- em- used the keys you had given me."
So he tried with drugs.
That's how you treat your friends? Then no, thank you!" He said trying to hide the bitterness he was feeling.
"Have you been here all day?"
He suddenly started thinking about it. It was a very stupid idea, she was putting herself in risk, Mycroft kept an eye all over London, he knew every movement every person made, of course he would find out he was with her, but he had nothing to be afraid of, she was the one who was threatened to be killed anyway, and if she didn't seem to care, then he didn't either, so he put the thought apart and tried to think of something else, to pass the time and don't feel forced to start up a conversation with her.
He…wasn’t amused.
"There has to- there has to be a unifying factor between one and the other. It can't be a coincidence, the universe is rarely so lazy. So, what's the link between Alice and the rest of the victims? There has to be a link Lestrade!"
Sherlock stood there, fixed to the spot, going through all the things John had just said, John had just
