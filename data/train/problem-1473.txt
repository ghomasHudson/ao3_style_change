“I was reading this tome some months ago out of boredom. Their primary defence is mimicry. I had mistaken it for a viper too, at first, but apparently they are devoid of teeth and entirely harmless, and that is because--”
She furrowed her brow at this “I-” She looked down at the basket in her hands. “I reckoned I was the one doing the helping here, sir. I’ve brought the supplies.”
The chicken ignored him. Instead, it looked with renewed interest at the box of flying humbugs in front of it.
The girl let her foot slide from the pedals to drag it across the ground, and the old metal beast gave one last indignant screech as the world stopped moving and they finally came to a halt at the feet of the hill.
"On the contrary," said Holmes, "this explains everything. You should be grateful that it hasn’t killed one of your hens yet. It must have been bothering my hives as well."
Watson laughed, “Nonsense, you’ll find no tigers in England. I’ve had to confront a tiger before, and I can assure you they will do anything to keep away from humans if they have the chance. And it still doesn’t explain the lack of footprints.”
Eight years the Londoner had been there, and eight years later it was still what they called him. He never went out past the confines of his field, and when he did, he made for the sea, leaving their small speck of civilization well alone, the only exception being to buy food. He wasn’t what her mother would call a companionable neighbour.
, right about the time a number of convicted felons began to return to civilization from the gaols I put them in!”
“You are doing no such thing. Do you wish to terrorise everyone down at the village? Besides, something doesn’t fit here—”
“And you were lecturing me about modesty.” I teased, kissing the corner of his eye, and he conceded.
“My dear fellow, of course; but what do you suppose we do with it, then? We could sell it to another farmer, if that is what you wish, but there’s no guarantee that a similar fate won’t befall it.”
They did catch his attention, after he'd thoroughly inspected the frame and begun to slide it back into place, when the defensive buzz roared again.
"So, this is how it is," he glared again at the chicken as it approached the hive once more. "You come to my house, you steal my lover, and now you eat my bees. Perhaps you'd like to have my keys as well, so you might make yourself at home? Teapot's in the bottom drawer."
“I need you to knock on Doctor Walters’ door and refuse to leave unless he agrees to come with you. Drag him out of his bed if you have to. Tell him that one of his African snakes has escaped.”
Doctor Watson smiled but chose not to comment, possibly feeling that the topic was sensitive to the young girl. Instead, he drew her attention to one hen who had wandered up to them while hunting for bugs, and Melanie picked it up, holding it close to her chest. The bird didn’t so much as flap, recognising the touch of her former owner. She let her shoulders drop.
As it looked back towards the hive, he prepared to scare it away once more; but the chicken paused, had a change of heart, and decided to scavenge for worms in the ground instead.
“Melanie,” Watson said, putting a hand on her shoulder “have you, by chance, had a close encounter with one of Doctor Walters’ dogs?”
“John.” he called, shaking him gently, and Watson’s breath hitched. Turning over so they could face each other, he huffed, rubbed at his eyes and gave the room a tired glance.
The chicken was right by his feet, peering curiously at the hive. Its clucking ceased as a group of guard bees flew towards it, a tone of warning in their buzz. The bird stared.
Only after he had taken a drag and breathed out a fine cloud of smoke that wrapped its winding tendrils around his form did he finally turn his attention to me.
That seemed to strike the stranger dumb. His eyebrows gave a funny jerk, and he raised a hand to pick at his moustache.
“Huh,” she said, inspecting the black automobile resting in their front garden, “that was not here before.”
Holmes did pose for a painting, as promised. All worry of inconveniencing him vanished as soon as I saw him sitting in his armchair, his fingers woven together and a playful smile on his lips. It was an educational and pleasurable experience, for I will never tire of looking at him, but I strongly suspect that, out of the two of us, he enjoyed it the most.
“It is my joy and privilege to make you flush as many times as my heart desires. Come now, no more climbing on ladders for you today, old boy. It would be such a pity for you to break your neck now, of all times.”
"I understand that it might seem like a trifle," he continued, "but it will put my mind at ease if I can ascertain the lack of danger myself."
Holmes snorted and reached for a cigarette in his nightgown pocket. For a few seconds, the small fire from the match pooled light in the cupping of his hands, illuminating his profile and accentuating his sharp features, his sunken cheeks casting deep shadows around the lines of his mouth. He raised a questioning eyebrow in Watson's direction, but the doctor shook his head. They both settled back to listen to the night.
“If it is so ridiculous, you’re welcome to get inside. I’m staying here.” the other man finally called back.
Melanie agreed, the prospect of a chat with Mr Holmes and the unspoken promise of biscuits too appealing to turn down. They began to walk back to the cottage together.
His hair was mussed and stubbornly sticking out to the side, and his cheeks were in dire need of a shave. Holmes ignored the fond warmth in his chest at the sight. “Good morning,” he said.
Sometimes Melanie would let herself wonder. She didn’t exactly stalk the house day and night, but she never seemed to see any visitors come rapping at their door. They didn’t seem to have wives or children. When she thought about it, neither did they seem to possess any other kind of relative at all.
They both startled when the chicken jumped back onto the ground in a flutter of wings, the cat following its example and running outside through the open window.
Watson finally cracked one eye open to peer at him, his gaze dark and unfocused under lids heavy with sleep.
“Ah, splendid! Here you are,” said Mr Holmes. “Watson, this is miss Melanie. Miss Melanie, may I introduce you to my very dear and lifelong friend: Doctor John Watson.”
The number of Londoners in the cottage had doubled, as had the size of her basket of supplies. As had, all things considered, her salary.
“Yes. Logically, it must be a simpler task to draw a stationary subject rather than one dashing hither and thither. Besides, I am already your muse in one of the arts, I can find no harm in taking that same role in one of the others.”
John imagined Sherlock trying to terrorize an old woman who had watched him grow up and wouldn’t allow him to scare her. He smiled warmly. “Caravans go out that way all the time. I’ll make sure you gain passage on the first one out after Mary signs your clean bill of health.”
The room was utterly still for a very long time. Just as John was beginning to get lightheaded from holding his breath, his grandmother stood, faced the Sheriff, and tilted her chin up.
Sherlock sighed and closed the book. “My brother,” he said the word with distaste, “is the one who taught me to read, as a child. He took a lot of pains with my education, not all of which went to waste.” His voice turned wry at the end. John’s curiosity spiked and the words tried to force their way out—“What happened to make you into a prostitute?”—but he managed to fight them back down.
The stranger’s eyes opened again at that. “Sanctuary?” he sneered. “To a whore? Let me kiss your feet in thanks!” he rolled his eyes in the most dramatic manner John could imagine then closed them again.
"Did Mary bribe you with food to gain knowledge of your name?" he asked teasingly. The man rolled his eyes but didn't reply. John shrugged and stood up to get some food. "I wouldn't blame you, as she used the same tactics on me and greatly succeeded!"
Once again sitting in the library, John gave the ledger up for a bad job and turned his chair towards the window. He could remember the day his grandfather died and his grandmother, a frail omega, refused to allow the next “legitimate” (an alpha cousin) heir take over the land. John had been a child, hidden and eavesdropping on a room full of anger. This very library, in fact, just with fewer shelves and books. Over and over, the town elders had demanded the guards take the omega away, to be locked up in the jail, to be taken to the insane asylum in the next town over. Every time, the guards and household staff refused. The Sheriff, a terrifying being to John in his youth, was called, and John was in tears by the time he could hear the lawkeeper’s boots clinking down the hall towards the meeting.
With some breakfast, he is finally able to label his mood: it’s like the last ember in a fire glowing in the early hours of the morning. But what the mood
The guards were carrying a stretcher among them, and John’s heart sank. He knew what he would see even before they bowed before him and allowed him to see their burden: the man they carried was caked in mud, his longish hair matted with blood (new and old, utterly rank regardless). He was wrapped in a cart canvas, which means he’d been found naked.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at him and John laughed. “I’ll be in the library: Standford can show you the way.”
“I am the ruler of these lands,” he said, bowing slightly. “I would prefer you not call me king, but…”
I will be the first to admit that I know nothing about prostitution. I read fics that feature characters who start as prositutes, but I understand those stories aren't reality. It is my hope that this portrayal isn't offensive or ridiculous.
"You're going to need a hat," he says after directing them to his rooms. Sherlock is leaning in the doorway, looking slightly winded, the unreadable expression on his face again, which clears at John's pronouncement. He scowls as John continues to dig through his clothes. Sherlock points to the straw hat John is currently wearing.
John heard the doors to the library crash open, and the staggering feet of a half-dozen men. “M’lord!” a man’s voice called, obviously attempting to be respectful but falling into the panic of an urgent situation.
Sherlock’s blunt, straightforward honesty emboldened John and he spoke. “Why are you, a decently well-educated and well-spoken alpha, a prostitute?”
The sheriff had walked through the door, and John was still grateful to this day he hadn’t seen the look on the man’s face: the adults in the room had, and had gone deathy quiet in just a few heartbeats.
His movement rushed back. “Enough!” he barked, and the two stopped mid-word. John breathed for a moment, then scrubbed a hand over his face. He turned toward the hallway. “Standford!” he called, and the guard stood behind him in a few moments.
She chuckled. “He didn’t try to take my head off and Standford said you’d talked to him last night: obviously you worked your charms on him and calmed him down a bit.”
John sighed, then noded. “Please take him to the Healer.” The woman, Mary, lived on the other side of the house because she was John’s personal physician. “You probably should’ve taken him there, first, then alerted me.” The men shifted uncomfortably, avoiding his gaze. Standford took a step closer and lowered his voice. His eyes skittered away and he bowed his head slightly. “Sir, you should know…” His embarrassment was palpable.
John’s hands tightened over the arms of his chair. He cursed his injury on a near-daily basis (especially in the aches of winter) but couldn’t regret the winding path of his fate. War had allowed him to taste strange liquors, strange spices, strange lovers. Upon his return, Harriet’s caring family surrounded him, and eventually, on a cool, summer evening, Harriet had relinquished the holdings to John.
John thought suddenly of the war: the boredom of inaction, the breathing of air saturated with blood, and the hunger, outrunning terror to drink and laugh about it later. He wondered if he could have made the choice, if his illness had allowed for it: his life or his ability to have children? As it was, he had awoken to the choice made for him.
okay?" he said, gently. "This is for us, Sherlock. For whatever 'us' means… will mean... in this case. This is important. To me. Please, let us get it right this time!" He almost pleaded. Sherlock scanned his face, held John's gaze for a stretched moment that almost killed him. Then swallowed and nodded faintly.
So it had been nothing new when he had turned, no rush this time, more like the retreat of a defeated animal. He hadn’t even grabbed his coat. He had simply left the flat, thudding down the stairs. When John had heard the front door slam shut, he had sagged on his chair, buried his face in his palms, a dry sob escaping his throat.
"How about we just take one step after the other? Figure it out together?” John continued, “Because… that's what this is about, yeah? Together?" John raised his eyebrows slightly.
Clutching John's dog tags with one hand, steadying themselves with the other on his thigh, they puffed warm breaths against John's ear and murmured: “All the nice girls love a soldier.”
How was he supposed to live under the same roof as that woman for one more second? He and Sherlock had had arguments about it, during their preparations in the bolthole, and in the moments they had to wait for Mary to arrive. Sherlock had thought it would give them time to think of a plan. Sherlock had thought it would be safest.
“What is it with you young folks these days?” Mrs Hudson had continued in a much smaller voice, “why not grab what is right in front of you?”
He felt the emptiness like a stab between his ribs which would let him bleed out in the end. He felt as if going back to hell to meet Moriarty and never get out again. It felt like he was hitting the pavement in front of Barts after all. Maybe he should have.
"You're whistling four-four-time. It really can't be that difficult, can it? Considering it is a tedious Christmas Carol, for God's sake!"
With difficulties John pulled back, tenderly pushed Sherlock’s curls out of his face. He reached for Sherlock’s shampoo, squeezed a bit of it into his palm and started spreading it in Sherlock’s hair. It was a bit awkward, reaching up for it like he had to with their difference in height, but the blissed out expression on Sherlock’s face made it all worth it. John increased the pressure slightly, moved on to massaging Sherlock’s scalp and marvelled at the man’s beautiful face, all relaxed, eyes closed. Lashes clinging to pinkened cheeks.
“I was terrified to lose you.” Sherlock admitted silently. “But we’ve started the way down that road already and there was no way back.” He swallowed and John kept quiet, just waited, his stomach coiling in dread.
for his big boy—jeez, major internal eye-roll—... hmmmm, that was something different altogether. Although, preferably not provided by Mrs Pesky Redhead but rather by her gorgeous companion. He should keep that in mind for later... the thought of plush deep purple lips wrapped around his erection… no, not bad. Not bad at all…
This was the moment Greg chose to pull the door of the bathroom open in a flourish and parade into the living room covered only by a towel slung snuggly around his hips.
"Alright." was all Sherlock answered with a voice gone a bit hoarse. "I have to say I'm relieved," he said a bit more steadily and John saw the twinkle return to those mesmerising eyes. "Because I never said anything about being averse to
“Well, the impression I left wasn’t appropriate nonetheless.” Sherlock smirked and finally threw John an amused glance.
When Greg handed him a cup of tea John looked up at his friend and was met with a tentative but friendly and open smile. He saw that Greg had already changed his formal Yard-attire to his more comfortable private clothes. Frowning, he looked at the cup in his and then to the sink, where the dirty dishes had miraculously vanished. Greg must have had enough time to do all that and John hadn’t noticed anything, too engrossed in the email he had been reading, too lost in his mind. Was that what Sherlock had always felt like when lost in his mind palace? Did John miss him that badly that he was already taking over habits. Just great, apparently his whole damn life was taken over by the man. But then, what was new about that?
"Don't be silly, love." she had turned her back on him and had busied herself with the kettle. She had looked over her shoulder at him, berating him like a little schoolboy. "You know perfectly well that it takes more to bring me down, to give me a
Without stopping in his tracks, Sherlock seemed… like in a sort of osmosis… to slowly absorb the melody into each of his body's cells and his movements seamlessly merged from mere walking into something else altogether. This was nothing like John had seen before. This was, no doubt, dance… but nothing like the clear forms, precise techniques of which John knew nothing and none of the energetic jumps and turns either. Everything looked somehow smooth and supple, fluent. Almost fluid, John thought. He was transfixed. He looked at Sherlock's slender body bowing and stretching the lean limbs, dropping into heaps, raising again like waves on the ocean. Always a pensive expression and hint of a frown on his face. He looked vulnerable this way. Yet strong.
It stung. Even if he was aware that John knew better — of course he did, he was a goddamn doctor — this flat out dismissal stung. True, he had, apart from anatomy, sparse medical knowledge. He had done his research, he had done his best. Most of the time the people he was interested in, work related that is, weren't in need of life-saving anyway… not anymore at least… and the lives he saved through The Work were those of people he had never met and will never meet and therefore weren't interesting.
“You’ve been very convincing.” Sherlock swallowed and ignored John’s efforts. "You have to admit, your change of heart was very sudden. How can I be sure that this is not just a convenient experiment due to a lack of other options?" He witnessed John’s face pale. Then John winced, lowered their hands but didn’t let go.
A completely disheveled Sherlock emerged from under the covers and John immediately pulled him in for a frantic kiss. Sherlock's mouth tasted of his own precome in place of the expected morning cottonness. John groaned.
... in which John learns about a lot of things: his duties as a doctor, the value of household remedies, a lot of different languages, the equipment of the queen and his own role in this case.
Lost in thought he was startled by a scratching and scrunching. At first he thought of rats seeking shelter in the abandoned building the same way he did. He scanned the dusted floor next to him when he realised that it was the noise of nearing footsteps in the dust. Shit, he should have known that this place had security and got checked regularly. Of course they would secure a place like this. Homeless and squatters taking over vacant buildings was a common problem in London after all. Maybe it was one of those. Or was someone looking for him? Greg? No, why would he? He hastily shuffled backwards into the shadows. Either way, he felt absolutely no desire whatsoever to be discovered and to have to explain his presence.
"Because I prepared it." Mycroft had his back turned towards Sherlock and was drying his hands on a tea towel.
The memory of a limp and nearly lifeless arm stretched out on white sheets, skin cold and damp, a flat and frantic pulse beating underneath pale skin the only sign of life. The pressure on his heart tightening simultaneously to the tourniquet around a bicep. Veins appearing faint and blue in the crook of the arm. He had had to take the right one, the normally smooth tissue being too scarred and taught on the left arm. No fresh puncture wounds though, that's good, good… he had tried to convince himself. Although he hadn't checked the space between the toes afraid of what he would find there. Neither had he dared to inspect the groin area afraid of… of everything really…
“I’ve… I’ve been hearing your thoughts, sometimes.” John whispered, as if he thought the very mention of the insane might be dismissed. With Sherlock’s silence, he seemed emboldened to continue, the words leaving him in a rush. “Not all the time, but… It’s like, I listen and I can find you. I see thoughts that aren’t mine, images…Tell me I’m wrong.  Tell me it’s PTSD, or…or…” John broke off then, swallowing hard.
Mrs. Hudson smiled as the Dragon's hunched frame finally started to relax, not surprised in the slightest when Sherlock's chin began to hang
When he spoke, his voice was low and sonorous, and his eyes seemed to change colour like his Gem as he looked up, peering at John for a long moment, seeming to see past him and into his mind itself.
John felt his throat tighten, even as Sherlock turned away. He silently wondered just what would have to happen to render Sherlock so vulnerable, so unsure when his age was questioned. What could make someone seem so fearful of ageing? Especially in Sherlock's case, as he was implying he was much older than he appeared... Then John realised that truthfully, painfully, he didn't think he could bear to know.
John was reminded of that sky now as he stared at the beast before him and his legs trembled in fear and awe, lips parted in shock as for a moment the Dragon regarded him speculatively, snarls dying slowly in its throat as it stared at him with narrowed eyes. In return, the young man stared back at something that was not quite man and not quite beast, unsure of what exactly he was seeing.
The conversation continued on the same inane threads, something that Mycroft could navigate easily enough. It was what he’d been raised to do, essentially. There was a soothing sort of nature to being in his human form, working on diplomacy, guiding the course of diplomacy so that no one felt left out or offended. He was good at it, modestly speaking. He hardly needed to think when he nudged the princesses towards a sake at the end of one massive banquet table, or suggested to Kareem and Chun li the best people to make small-talk with given their interests and goals. They were nobility themselves, after all, and seemed pleased with finding out more about the Northern Tribe.
Then there was a freezing blast, and the Dragon's crushing pinning weight was off of him. John was still for only a moment, but when he rolled onto his side, Sherlock was locked in a fierce battle with a fully transformed English.
“Too soft for battle.”  Lieutenant Dodge commented sharply, but she didn't offer further argument as she grabbed the creature's chain and hauled her towards the front, threatening any disobedience with the idea of a taze. John didn't think the timid beast would even consider it anyway, the pitiful burbling noises she made as she was all but dragged away to be Chipped and Registered were panicked and small. He's also not sure if Dodge is actually referring to the Dragon or to Mike, because his friend had a soft look in his eyes that showed he picked Molly out of pity, and probably nothing more.
For the first time, John was forced to conclude that he had finally experienced something at least a thousand times stranger than the bullets and fire of Afghanistan.
The man chuckles then, as if he's just told a very good joke. He leans back a little, regarding Daniel in a calculating manner.
SO SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG! DX many apologies, however with school starting up I have found myself suddenly waking up at five and going to bed at ten again. So.
The little girl huffed then, crossing her arms (John's arms) over her chest and frowning thunderously at the Detective like he had committed some kind of gross offence. For a moment Sherlock couldn't figure out what he had done until she pointed a finger at him in bold and imperious accusation.
Lestrade hadn’t gotten an answer at the door when he’d shown up that morning, and assumed that Sherlock and John had finally crashed and gotten to sleep. With Mrs Hudson’s cheery blessing, the D.I took to the stairs, entering
“Just a moment please Mr. Holmes. We are trying to collect ourselves since we've become a little scrambled, and it seems that it's proving to be more difficult than usual.”
A quiet exhale, and a spider-long hand reached by John’s leg. The young man held his breath, waiting for force to be used- and was instead confused and more than a little bit perturbed when said hand merely pulled the blankets up higher, tucking them under John’s chin like a parent might do for their child. Then that voice, dangerous as ozone, crackling and yet still so bored, spoke into the quiet.
pressed up against the wall, with little room to breathe or see as Sherlock's wings covered him like a shroud.
The silver-haired Selkie hummed, unsure of what exactly John was saying. Yet he found himself understanding the man’s posture, some of his pained countenance. There was a melancholy that seemed to live in this Human habitually, and it came and went like a tide was prone to do. John appeared almost like a cracked seashell, held together but not entirely undamaged. Too much force, and he’d shatter, sharp pieces injuring you in the process.
Sherlock's growls cut short, confusion lacing his features as he inhaled deeply, searching for a taint of Dragon. He found only Human scent before him, deceptively soft and fragile. He growled out a curt response without thinking, slowly drawing himself upright as vague imprints of manners pulled at him. Foolish traits he should have abandoned long ago and yet could not delete. When he spoke, his voice rasped from disuse. The Dragon realized with some surprise that he had not spoken in a very long time. It would not do to be impolite, if only because tradition mandated so.
, which was awkward as John was all but sitting in Sherlock's lap. He glared up at the Dragon, attempting
An itching, nagging feeling crawled along Sherlock's spine, tingling through his bones as he breathed in, holding his hands up instinctively in a supplicating gesture even as he crouched a few feet away. The information on dissociative disorders was vague at best, often contradictory with other sources, yet each website and forum that Sherlock had analysed had agreed on the same thing:
And then John stared down at his hands and swallowed, because he could not answer that one honestly. The words caught up in his throat, knowing the Dragon's true nature. It felt like his chest was sticky on the inside with them, their cloying deceit seeping into his lungs like brackish fluid.
John winced at the accusation in that sentence, and Greg hastened to explain. “Not like that. It's just... I've known Sherlock for years, and he
It was too late, the company had come to a halt. Cerioth’s sensitive ears could pick up the steady beat of a heart amongst a hundred other panicked gallops around him.
“I’m the head of the women’s quarters amongst the servants. Aamon, the head of the males’, unfortunately had pressing business to attend to.” Hajera looked to John, her dark eyes wide and earnest. “He asked me to apologise on his behalf, as well as to show you to your quarters, when the time came.” She laughed then, and it was a sound that was both embarrassed and stressed. “I’m afraid you’ve all come at a rather pressing time. You see, her majesty is currently in the middle of a rather strenuous bout of negotiation with neighbouring countries. We’ve all had to keep on our toes- she does not like to be kept waiting.”
He felt the moment that Greg fell into it, felt the strange but warm presence in his own consciousness. Mycroft felt his mother and father, his brother and all those still dancing in the Star Ball. A red and gold tail brushed his own, Greg letting him know that he felt it too. They drew closer together, hearing in each other’s thoughts the same bell-note of companionship. They were opposite magnets, drawn to each other even as Mycroft was sure he’d burn up and Greg was sure he’d turn to ice. The storm around them made it hard to see, but both of them could find each other with ease. Mycroft realised what it was the moment one clawed paw met the other, the two of them folding their wings in a breathless, wondrous fall towards the earth that only stopped a moment before it would have been too late to fly.
“M'sorry, mate. I'm just... He's been cold before but this is approaching glacial and I'm worried... he's only come out of his room presumably when I'm not about. If he doesn't start eating soon or at the very least
Unable to defend her partner due to the fact that she had been protecting her nest (Molly had a younger brother and sister, but to this day she didn't know what became of their eggs), the proud Dragon had almost managed to succeed in protecting her eldest child from the men that came to take her. If she strained to remember, Molly could still see the flames her mother had spat that night upon the men that had slowly climbed their way up to her den. She could still feel their heat, warming the back of her ears as she had been pressed against her mother's side. If she strained to listen, she could still hear the lullaby she sang for the last night they shared together in that cave.
Made the hair on the back of Greg’s arms stand on end, and it was only made worse by the shuttering of Sherlock’s expression, his eyes turning flat and distant in a way that was both frighteningly similar and foreign, an expression that hadn’t been used in months.
“John.” Sherlock murmured, manoeuvring so that he had the smaller man curled beside him. However John had already vanished, Sneak's voice rumbling against the detective's neck. It
Everything tasted like desert, in John’s dreams. Sand and dust was how Sherlock’s betrothed had grown up, all he had known. It was a village that Sherlock had only glimpsed at from time to time, and yet now he saw it for what it was- a dustbowl.
to let it rain, as he was currently watching a group of children pull and tug on a doll made supposedly to his likeness. They were giggling and fiddling with the straw arms of the doll, dressing his robe with coloured stone necklaces as they crouched in the dirty street. The leader of the small group, an imperious looking little girl with a smattering of freckles across her nose and a dark red robe and white sash, was pretending to be the mysterious and aloof
“She’s dangerous, John. Dangerous and almost as clever as Sherlock or I. The Gem she’s been blackmailing is not the first victim to her cons and if she’s not careful, she’s going to attract some ugly company. Anyone tied to her will be in the strike zone, and truth be told there is only so much I can do outside of my Diamond court. I humour Sherlock, but the other Diamonds… they’ll crush him if he steps a hair out of line. Irene affiliates with dangerous people, and they’re attracting attention.”
of iron when John's foot connected with it, the scales making it so he didn't even leave a bruise. There was an empty plate where the cake used to sit, and the Dragon kicked it aside with one foot before sitting back down and resuming his protective tail-curl around John's middle. John sighed, giving Mrs. Hudson a small, pleading look before turning to the
Yes, Sherlock could put his energy to a much better use. He could Mark his territory, claim the room as his own.
The little girl crowed, standing on top of the playground, baring her teeth in a grin that was surprisingly savage for one so small. Her voice was clear, far clearer than any two and a half year old's should have been. “I AM THE GREAT AND POWERFUL DRAGON! FOOLISH HUMANS!”
Sneak turned, pale brows drawn in consideration. After a moment he stated decisively “Eton. At the very least that's where your brother wound up. I'm not sure with you, given the fact that you have certain traits that most people of upper class wouldn't have: Such as your status as an addict.”
“Name's Marley, Lieutenant Marley Jones. My Dragon Parlyanne and I have done this a few times now, so we know what it's like to be fresh meat.” Her Chinese Dragon blinked its assent behind her, almond-shaped eyes streaked with flecks of gold in their depths. Behind John, Sherlock thought his deductions with lightning-quick brutality.
Sherlock’s scowl, evident frustration at his lack of understanding of John’s words made the soldier chuckle slightly, even as the Selkie dove forward, resting an instant out of John’s personal comfort bubble. It was a last second move, brought on by John’s instinctive flinch. Sherlock’s expression was impatient, and his eyes flicked towards the darkness, outside. John felt a tingling along his spine, unfamiliar adrenaline pricking his blood as Sherlock hummed a wheedling melody of desire.
Plush lips pressed to the soldier’s temple, fleeting but soft. Sherlock’s voice was gentle, but the hands that turned John over, pressed him closer were demanding. They rumpled the covers, twisting them about their bodies so that they did little to deter the chill. It didn’t matter though, not when the Demon’s skin was burning hot, and John’s own was slowly heating to it. John opened his eyes to see twin wings, spreading to shield the man from even the moonlight itself, and the Incubus’ blue eyes. They shone, slitted and inhuman in the dark. Monstrous. John found that he had never been so glad to see such a sight.
“I’m-” Mycroft broke off, hesitating. Not many viewed his abilities highly. He kept his silence as Greg began to shed his Human form, his body changing and growing with rapid speed. A blast of energy in the form of heat came with the transformation, forcing Mycroft to squint and move back a half-pace.
Sherlock nodded, pencil already making sharp little notes in his pen-pad. He didn't need it of course, but it would be good for John to
The young man cut off, biting his lip. He looked at John, eyes wide and pleading. John could see the betrayal in that gaze, the shock that anyone could
Wordlessly, the little girl nodded. However, she did not offer any further explanation. Her hands were firmly gripping the armrests of John's chair, and her breathing hitched slightly. The detective called to her in assurance, trying to steady the beginnings of panic that seemed
To what do I owe this untimely visit? You don’t often visit the bone room.” True to the room’s title, a collection of skeletal creatures shivered in the corners of the chamber like timid pets, save for the fact that they were not of the living and indeed quite dead. Their eyes were baleful empty sockets, their forms nothing even close to anatomically correct. Pieces, stitched together by hands that cared not for mortal definitions of “physically possible” and instead aimed for both fantastic and strange.  To Mycroft they were the epitome of his brother’s frivolity, as he treated them less like the messengers of the dead they were meant to be and more like house pets. Then again, the elder Holmes had never much liked the empty look the creatures gave him, or the skittering way they scuttled around the polished end of his parasol.
What Sherlock would have said in retaliation was mercifully left unspoken however, as in the next instant, Molly’s presence prickled over Sherlock’s skin. The Water-Spirit lifted his head, taking the opportunity to call John in. A part of him felt a strange twisting in his gut as the curtains parted to his will, revealing John.
Mycroft watched him leave, the fire flickering as a cold wind blew in from the open window. It sent the room sputtering into inconsistent golds and blues, casting everything into shadow. He felt the warm feeling douse, leaving him with only a feeling of unease writhing in the pit of his stomach. He felt the heaviness of exhaustion settle in his bones, deep and pulling. Against his will, Mycroft’s eyes began to slip closed. He curled closer to the edge of the chair near the fire, shivering in spite of himself. The library seemed to hunch down around him, protecting him from something.
God, he had been here since morning and there was still no end in sight to his shift. Not that there could be, given the time of the year. Even now all hands were on deck, men and women alike throwing thick cords of rope over the posts of the gates, heaving as one and pulling the massive wooden blockade shut for the evening, caging the village against the threats that would soon come. John watched them from above on the wall, people he had known all his life appearing like tiny ants marching in tandem. The town of Baker was well protected, he thought, fortified by the stake-like wooden walls, each spike armed with an archer who knew their weapon well. His people were lucky, all things considered. That still did not make the expectations of tonight any less dreadful or menacing.
Sneak purred, head tilting slightly as he peered through his eyelashes at the man of angles and shadow before him. The hand that held his cigarette came up to reach out and brush an errant curl lightly from Sherlock's eyes, smile fading into something strangely sad and piercing the longer the detective looked at it. Sneak's question
, tearing a hole into the back of the nightgown Mike had bought for her. Her tail curled ruby-red about her legs, dark spines glinting dangerously. She didn't know what had happened.
So John, glancing once more upwards to ensure his husband slept, hugged Elena close to him, opening the book to the page Elena was insistently tapping to. It had a picture of a little boy, his eyes filled and lonely.
John looked fragile, tied up as he was in a hateful collection of tubes and beeping monitors. His pulse was being monitored in a lime green line on a screen, and despite the fact that Sherlock was aware of his Mate’s health, he took to staring at it for long moments. He found himself sitting in the available chair without being fully aware of such actions. There was no other option, it felt as though rocks were tied to his feet. He felt the strangest compulsion to take John’s hand, and was idiotically irritated that it was too swathed in gauze and wires to do so.
The fact that she was also fluent in Dragon-Tongue, her husband having taught her as he had a job in training the creatures, was just an added bonus in light of the very bad situation she quite suddenly found herself in.
to bubble deep in his belly, and his blue eyes glittered in the dark like twin gems as they roved appreciatively over the figure lying beneath
The Gem was a pathologist at St Bart’s, and it had been rather obvious from day one what she had a rather terrible crush on Sherlock, even if her skin hadn’t already had an usual pinkish blush to it. John watched as Molly (also known as Morganite to her friends) would follow the detective around much like a duckling, often trying to gain his attention and with varied or little result. John felt a certain amount of sympathy for her, if only because if a fellow Gem didn’t have a hope in the world of capturing Sherlock’s eye, then there wasn’t a chance in hell that he’d be able to. She let him use her outrageously, fetching him coffee or grabbing syringes for him: all for one little smile or nod of appreciation that did not appear nearly often enough.
Holmes looked again and saw that the two openings were, in fact, approximately the same height. He also noticed that Watson had tried to replicate the windowsill of their cottage, with arguable proficiency.
Holmes regarded me from beneath half-closed lids, “You were still writing at around midnight, when I last saw you awake. You continued long past that hour.”
“But… why?” asked Melanie, “I mean, I’m coming over tomorrow, as usual, there was no need to drive all the way here today.”
I have the painting to this day and am tremendously proud of it. Though the few people to whom I’ve shown it seem to admire it, they will never be able to appreciate it as fully as when I see it, hanging next to its twin in Holmes’s bedroom — a jewel amongst the wall of snarling criminal faces — while the weight of my beloved’s head presses against my breast and all is at peace with the world.
“H’m?” I mumbled, attempting to rub the sleep out of my eyes. “Oh, yes. I am to send this to my editor by nightfall. I might have finished it as early as last week if it hadn’t been for this dreadful block.”
Holmes, in the meantime, had snapped out of his astonishment and slid to his side on the sofa. He gave the animal a puzzled glance as he rested his chin on Watson’s shoulder.
” he responded at last when they broke apart and rested their foreheads against each other’s. The smile on his face was as wide as it was genuine. “So much for pandering. How dare you make me emotional over a chicken coop.”
He still didn’t look convinced, so Holmes laced their fingers together, rubbing small circles on the side of his thumb.
,” the doctor corrected him, “Only the females grow to that size, and even then, Doctor Walters’ was an exceptionally enormous specimen. They hunt at night so as to avoid the birds, which, in turn, prey on them. They are also very fond of climbing. I suspect we will find a surprising pile of shells inside the higher sections of the coop’s walls, tomorrow.”
Also simultaneously the three-taps stopped abruptly while Greg cheered: "Hey old groundhog, are you finally awak…" and faltered.
As soft-footed as possible John sneaked around the corner and pressed himself against the closest wall in the shadows.
“Slide your hand over your cock now, John. Slowly, steady hold, not too firm. Imagine it’d be my lips encircling your shaft, the cavity of my mouth enclosing your glans. Are you imaging it?” Scott asked, but John wasn’t able to articulate any coherent noises anymore and only groaned into the speaker. Luckily Scott was panting little breathless puffs between his words as well, when he continued. “When you squeeze your penis now, only a bit… Are you doing it, John?" John hoped Scott didn't expect anything other than needy grunts, because that was all he was capable of right now. "Then, do you feel the soft tissue of your palm? Lick it again, John. Make it wet and imagine it's my tongue. Can you feel my tongue pressing against your erection?"
Then again, it was 3am. He had been awake after all. Not able to sleep. Never went to bed in the first place. He sat fully clothed in his chair in the sitting room engulfed in the nightly dark. The fire in the hearth long gone cold.
He had intended to go back to Baker Street only to realise that he had lost that as well. It just wasn't the same without Sherlock and the memories of a prior period alone and lonely in 221B were still much too vicious. He couldn't live there anymore but he went to visit Mrs Hudson, ask about Sherlock, realising again that Sherlock was definitely gone. Because… he hadn’t even contacted Mrs Hudson. In what universe would Sherlock Holmes abandon Mrs Hudson? '
Greg, embarrassed, rubbed the back of his neck and ran a hand through his salt and pepper hair. The grease on his hands, still not fully absorbed by the cloth, didn’t help his appearance one bit. It made his hair messily stick in all directions.
John swallowed. Sherlock swallowed. John kept looking at the screen, his eyes seemed to be boring into Sherlock’s, although Sherlock knew this was impossible. It was just a screen, goddammit. When the on-screen-John spoke again he seemed a bit more relaxed.
Not really realising where he was any longer - home, mind palace, wherever, doesn’t matter - and noticing nothing but music and dizziness, he drifted off again.
"I'm sorry, John, I know how much you despise when I lose myself in my studies. And that you usually don't appreciate when I'm... digging too deep into the subject of my experiments…" Sherlock said pointedly with a devilish grin, and nibbling on John's collarbone he slid his hands down John's naked back, taking hold of John's bum—each of his big hands covering one of John's arse cheeks.
"For once in your life, Sherlock..." Mycroft said tiredly and rubbed his forehead with his fingertips, "... just do as you're told."
Occasionally brushing over Sherlock's hips and thighs in his never ceasing attempt to comfort his lover—and himself as well if he was honest—he traced the bumps of garter belt and straps in wonder, cherishing the sensation of the ruined lace of the stockkings under his digits, felt the hot breath in his neck, savoured their combined smell of fresh sweat and sex. He must have been a saint in a former life to be worthy of this unbelievably wonderful enigma of a man.
, instead tugging at the belt to his trousers without a second thought even while pressing a torn piece of his jumper to the wound. The shooter
He was going to die curious, and that fact in itself seemed as darkly humorous as it was horribly unfair.
and held all the power that came with it, sitting cross-legged in her chambers and listening to her prattle on about the events of Humans life below. She'd sit on her favourite deep blue cushion, her servants (usually a young star or perhaps a comet) combing through her shimmering silver-white hair even as she fiddled with the precious jewels in her ears and prepared for her nightly dance in the sky. Sherlock when he felt like it could recall the exact timbre of her rich voice as it would lecture him, could envision the piercing ire in his mother's pale blue eyes as she berated him once again for not understand Human morals and laws.
But just as it looked like John might reach it, a wind that was as powerful as it was chilling tore through the village, scattering leaves and ruffling the young man's robes. John shut his eyes against the dust that threatened to fill them, and when he opened them, the soup bone was gone.
“That hasn’t seemed to work that well so far, Sherlock.” John admitted quietly, looking up at the detective through the fan of his lashes. He resisted the urge to flinch away from his companion’s agitated snort, still feeling the aftereffects of… whatever had transpired last night. “I mean, Claude seems to like you…but so far the other personalities haven’t seemed all that interested in making your acquaintance. And I can’t access them. You know that.”
He could be pretending, and then he would take this room over and force Sherlock back into his Crate with the awful clicking thing that made his very insides roil with hate.
“Perhaps,” Is all she said at last “Death and near-death are far closer than I thought when I was alive.”
Okay, so the angst is (mostly) resolved in this chapter ^.^'' still a bit more to go but things aren't quite as tense.
Sometimes, when he was very sure that he was alone in the flat, when the right song came on the radio, and John didn’t have much to do, he’d find himself trying to dance.
The soldier asked, mystified at the seemingly cryptic question. He was positive that this time the Dragon
It had been ages, an eternity it seemed, since he had held a gun without the express longing to put it against his own head.
His mum's voice hissed like the rattle of lightning against the window pane, and for a moment John saw her figure, illuminated by the flash of light outside. His mother's eyes were wild, hair frizzed with sleep. She stood in her nightgown like a ghost. In contrast his father towered over her, and yet John found himself more afraid of his mum's cold fury. He bit his lip, flinching at the next words thrown, sharp and cutting as rose thorns.
If he closed his eyes, Sherlock could sometimes sense the place his companion rested. It was the darkest parts of the mind, a tucked in corner of John’s brain that saved the man from the worst of his injuries and consequently his memories of what had happened. John had been steadily drifting closer, but had yet to actually break unconsciousness’ hold. Sherlock shivered with how much he could read of John’s thoughts, how intimately he could now fit himself inside the man’s body. It was a mental connection that felt all at once deeply right and deeply horrid. He was never one to keep boundaries in mind, but no should be able to read every waking moment their Mate experienced. It was a constant television channel playing in the back of his mind, and Sherlock worried that it would only get worse once John woke up.
Fortunately, Anthea was always one to break the ice that Mycroft tended to cultivate about himself. She stepped forward, delivering a crisp report.
Sherlock inhaled deeply, allowing the heavy set of his emotions to pass. He shook his head, dispelling the chaotic nature of his thoughts and accepted Nalini into his arms.
Instead of waiting for an answer, Hamish ducked inside to go searching for Papa, little body still too-full of energy to quite stay still. The stomping of his feet was like the thrum of an earthquake. Sherlock sat perched on a stool in the kitchen, leaning over a microscope as his skeletal fingers twisted the dials into focus. Upon his son’s entry however he paused in his work to smile at his son, bending down to scoop the boy up onto his knee, much to Hamish’s delight.
John didn't notice them for nearly the first month, too preoccupied with moving in and getting to know his rather eccentric
He would wake up in someone else's bed having no recollection of ever talking to the woman (and sometimes on rare occasions, man) that lay next to him, yet it would be obvious what had gone on the night before. And though he had lied his way into the army and managed to convince them that he was stable, he still woke up with half of his shoulder torn apart and no recollection of the bullet that had entered him. That had been the first time he had ever been truly frightened of a black spot, because there had been the shrieking sound of sirens, and then only inky darkness.
The Dragon looked up at Dodge, who watched the entire scene with a kind of impassiveness that made Sherlock's throat close hotly. It would be better this way, he reasoned as he stared down the barrel of the gun. After all, it
It was funny, how those thanks given to him left him feeling ashy and small. John spent the first three nights after the battle in a hospital bed, bouncing back and forth between nightmares and dreams that left him aching, blood pooling to his groin and leaving him crying out a name that he should never had known. The priest had come to see him, to talk to John about his feelings after the “attack”. The captain hadn’t told kind-faced Father Henry that in his mind, it wasn’t so cut and dry. Still he confessed his sins, and was told that it wasn’t his fault. That he had been “overcome” by the creature’s dark magic, that what had happened had been a cruelty.
And then wetness, warm and dripping against Sherlock's neck. John shook silently with his crying, trembling like a bomb strapped down to stone as his ragged voice pleaded. Sherlock stared straight ahead, hardly daring to breathe. In his mind, pieces fell together, long sleeves and nightmare-filled nights coalescing into a very different John than the detective had first assumed.
“Wish I had something to read. My book got stolen, thanks to fucking Bill.” He sighed to himself. “It was a buggering helpful read, at least. Fucking shame.”
He kind of liked the idea of being a fire-fighter, except for the fact that if he was one then he wouldn't get to learn how to use a gun. The thought made him frown unhappily. As a five year old boy, he thought it very important that he learn how to fire a gun. After all, who would protect big sis or Mum if he didn't learn how to?
finally recall, the knot of tension that had wound itself in his stomach only turned to ice, heavy and unforgiving.
when did John start believing in such things??) meant that the army doctor was making an assumption:
Weighing the options heavily in his mind, the Dragon then took into account the promise of more food. If Sherlock had known John better, he would have spotted the clever bluff in an instant. John had no intention of letting the creature starve, but he counted on Sherlock's distrust of him in this case, as it made it easier to lie. It was perhaps underhanded, but the soldier couldn't quite bring himself to guilty as he saw the Dragon's eyes narrow in hesitant acceptance.
He inhaled more deeply, brow furrowing in concentration as he tried to pinpoint the aroma that drifted past his nostrils. Not meat, it lacked that certain greasy and savoury texture. Yet it wasn't something bland either, like the watery gruel he had been given at the Kennels when they hadn't been able to afford the more expensive shipments. It was sweet, almost sickeningly so, and had a dark timbre with it that spoke of decadence. His mouth watered as he unwillingly imagined what it could be, the possibilities making him painfully hungry once again in an instant even though as of late he had eaten more than he had ever before. A small, desperate whine of frustration at his own weakness slipped from his lips before he could stop it.
Dizzily, John thought at first that his Dragon was speaking to someone in the truck. His heavy tongue threatened to chide Sherlock, to reprimand him for speaking to his teammates that way. Yet, as he watched more closely, he saw his companion’s sharp features were not focused on anyone sitting on the benches, but rather on the elegant-looking Dragon seated in the Queen's lap without an apparent care in the world. His blue eyes held a thunderous sort of fury, and John felt a vague twinge in his arm, the Bond Tattoo Sherlock had placed on him writhing, suddenly turning into fire ants beneath his skin. John wasn't sure if he had made a noise, but he must have, because even though to him time was moving as thickly as molasses, he could see Benson sitting up, looking at him with eyes lowered in concern. Vaguely, John could hear the conversation inside the truck drying up, dying away as his friends watched him, wondering what was wrong and why Sherlock was this agitated so suddenly.
“Do all your partners wind up having full-blown panic attacks before things even get started, or are you just a natural at this? You seem to be taking this entire situation rather well.”
John could picture it in his mind's eye. A foggy night, where mist reflected off of silvery skin in the water. A lullaby just out of reach drifting in his ears. He blinked, thinking he could almost see the shapeless forms dancing in the firelight, fins kicking the flames as if they were waves.
When John came home, utterly exhausted from the Blackout and feeling just a little bit sore, he was greeted with Sherlock's languid form lying on his back on the couch. In the half dark he squinted through his pounding headache, trying to make sense of the man's awkward posture. He lay there completely still, eyes closed. Hands folded against his lips, almost as if he were praying. Except John was fairly sure Sherlock didn't have a deity he felt the need to pray to. Except perhaps himself. The enigmatic man didn't seem to even notice his entrance, and for that the soldier could only pray for small mercies.
Sherlock felt this way even as the boy stirred beneath his hand, and sleepily his friend murmured, “M-mum?”
He had been in the middle of filtering through the rather large and impressive collection of books that each new victim shared with the
The man murmured, but the detective didn't reply. John rose slowly to his feet, cautious as he crept forward. The detective didn't
Unwillingly, a shiver rippled up John’s spine, and his eyes closed. He felt himself being dragged into the darkness. Sleep was calling to him a sweet lullaby. When John opened his eyes again, there was a glitter in those dark blue irises that hadn’t been there before.
“I figured it’s time to pull my own weight a bit, given that neither of us really had much choice in our marriage in the first place.” Greg sipped his tea, nodding thoughtfully. When he set his cup down, he glanced at Sherlock who was standing in the corner of the room looking every bit like a particularly gloomy lawn ornament.
angry he shuts himself off into another wave so I don't hear him shouting, or if Sneak's being stupid they send me away so I don't hear his thoughts. That sort of thing. My Other Brother practically
The soldier looks at her impassively, as if he could really care less about what John might think. His eyes still dark about restlessly, looking on instinct for weaknesses.
"I've never heard him mention a Sherlock before, not in school, not when talking about the neighbourhood kids, not anywhere. He didn't call for me, didn't call for Mum or Dad or even Grandma. He called for Sherlock, and asked for him."
“They barely helped at all, and besides that half the time I felt like I was in.... In a fog.... I went through most of my teenaged life on pill after pill. Then the war came, and it got better. I got better. It seemed.... It just seemed unnecessary once I turned eighteen and could make my own choices.”
John hissed, shooting Sherlock a glare. The detective for his part look rather offended, though it was a struggle to maintain the expression. After all, staying angry was a struggle when one was balancing an awkwardly-shaped end of a dresser. John settled for scowling up the flight of stairs at his partner, straining to keep his end of the heavy furniture upright.
“They're fragile things, Dear One. You can't simply manhandle them into the shape you desire. They're not malleable that way, not like the water which you rule over.” She'd say this even as she'd look at him through the reflection of her ornate, circular mirror, her eyes kind despite the barbs within her words. Sherlock would usually huff at such lectures, crossing his arms over his chest and growling out excuses. However that time, he had glared back at her, his jaw squared as he challenged her with defiance.
John hadn’t asked any more questions after that, his jaw tight and his gaze turned towards the window and the uncertainty of evening. The nurse had tentatively asked if he had made arrangements with a relative or friend, but his silence was perhaps telling enough. After a while, sensing his need for solitude,  the nurse had gathered herself and left.
lithe forms and how they moved. He swung his arms experimentally as he loped a little out of the shadow of the cove, the cave-like rock not interesting him enough, the sharp rocks ahead instead drawing him near. He was pleased to note that it made movement easier, crouching on the sea-stained outcropping to look at the tide-pools that formed in the dips of stone.
“As a result male mothers of eggs tend to be overly protective. Instinct, you know. So much so that it's been shown that they'll even be wary of their own Mates during the waiting period between the birth and the Hatching. The eggs simply aren't as strong, something about the membrane of the shell... a tendency to crack, break. Sometimes the Hatchlings are still-born. Yet they try so hard...The grief from losing the egg alone can sometimes kill them-”
Like the ricochet of the bullet slicing through his shoulder, his voice rang out in the room. Echoing as he quietly struggled in one last feeble attempt, and then died pressed underneath the crushing force of Sherlock's shoe.
He wondered if Mrs Hudson would even let them rent from her, now. She loved Sherlock, but to house them was to invite trouble. John had heard some of the nastier names for people like him, how they were perceived. The thought of putting her, of putting
The Gem made a rather exasperated sound through his teeth, burrowing closer into the cushions. His sigh was one of quiet defeat.
one, and that was a thought that made John shiver uncomfortably, looking to change the topic quickly. Turning away from the balcony, he indulged Sherlock with a small smile. The Water-Spirit blinked at it, seemingly at a loss as to its motives. “C’mon then, show me your flowers.”
had been satisfying to help out with). Her gem glittered on her shoulder, hidden and yet not under a sheer blouse.
For another, he was too busy feeling his mind all but being assaulted by Sherlock's thoughts, crowding out his own, buzzing at a mile a minute. It was strange how the Dragon could so easily overwhelm him with so much information, yet nothing of particular informational value at all. Then again, John half suspected Sherlock did this on purpose. He noted how the Dragon’s hands were folded underneath his chin, and how his expression seemed dazed with thought.

Going into the centre of District Three was often seen as hazardous, but a necessary drawback to the usually metropolitan-like atmosphere it held further out in the country. However, Mike lived closer to the centre than John did, and so the young man calmly reminded himself that he was a
It was lying in the dark, protective shelter of blankets that John Watson looked at his partner, the detective curled into the shell of the army doctor’s body like they were made to slide there. Like two puzzle pieces, effortlessly nudged side by side. Shyla- or Sherlock (John supposed he wouldn’t know which would wake up with him come the morning) slept solidly once down, the fan of their lashes fluttering with the beginnings of REM sleep, long and spidery hands occasionally twitching in response to some unseen stimuli. Both of them were naked, the detective a canvas of pale skin, now marked here and there with love-bites and the scent of sex still hanging in the air. Their eyes still had smudges of the evening’s mascara on them, and the red of their lip still shone deep and plump, making John want to do nothing more than press his own lips to them again and again. Asleep like this, John found the detective looked so much more vulnerable, shedding their usual armour of the day away to reveal instead a kind of delicate nature.
“M.I.A, unfortunately,” Mycroft murmured, not unkindly. His grey eyes sharpened as he added on, “But four survivors were found at the compound, and were given the option to be honourably discharged to London, if they so desired. Three of the four elected to do so.”
“These are the bath chambers; they connect towards the outside of the temple, and the warmth from them comes from underwater steam. I put some soaps and perfumes for you in the basket that I know My Lord is partial to, and by the time you’re done I’ll have sent a robe to you as well.” John didn’t bother asking how she knew his size; Molly’s confidence in her job suggested she merely knew because much like everything in Sherlock’s world, strong magic was afoot. Reluctantly, John had to admit that a part of him felt bad that he was in such a cruel mood when around Molly, because it was evident that she was truly a nice person. The thought left him vaguely unsettled, as John wasn’t even really sure if Molly was human at all. He decided, however, that at a glance, she was far more human than Sherlock would ever be, and as it stood that was enough for John to offer her a small smile even as she bowed once, turning down some corridor to give him privacy in the expanse of the cavern.
Without a word, John held his Stone out to her, blue eyes as dark as its near-opaque surface. His sister's insults fell silent, and she looked at him with wide eyes. Harry's lips parted in surprise, and her instinctive reaction was to deny it.
Greg inhaled deeply, coughing the next instant as the cold air assaulted his lungs despite his Magic. Mycroft stepped forward, ignoring how the Dragon’s skin burn his own pink as he patted his back.
Inside the cave, the sand was cool and damp. John felt it collect in the crevices between his toes, and he shivered with the abrupt realisation that he had somehow managed to leave his clothing behind. Goosebumps pebbled along the outside of his arms and the back of his neck, brushed by the cool sea air. Sherlock, however, seemed not to mind nudity, even as he knelt to lovingly scoop something into his arms. For a moment, John thought it to be a dress, however as the child turned to him, the boy saw it was something closer to a cloak. It looked like, well it looked like it was made of
It was all Sherlock's tightly-strung senses needed. Unable to stop himself any longer, the Dragon warily stepped over the threshold of
Benson’s grey-blue eyes roved over the refugees, and beside him, his Dragon stiffened suddenly. The next moment, a rumbling growl emerged from the creature’s chest, a warning that in the next moment made sense as Sherlock hissed John’s name through his teeth. The young soldier realised why a moment later. Stepping forward from the crowd-or rather pushed from it, a Dragon with a simple chain collar and a trembling countenance emerged. He was filthy as the others, his dark hair sticking up on end in clumps of matted sweat and grime, and dark eyes ticked nervously and widely even as he stood.
The Central Kennel as it turned out, was the sort of place that made John think of fleas and excrement, of blood and other unpleasantries. On the outside it
“It is good to see you're awake my Lord. Allow me to introduce myself, I'm Molly and I've been instructed to care for you.” She tried for a smile then, attempting at friendliness and light-hearted joy. John did not return the smile, glaring at her silently. He sat on the bed a stone statue, mute and defiant in his refusal to save face. After a moment, the young woman's smile shrank away, and her dark eyes softened with something indefinable as she folded her hands in front of her waist.
Humans only visited their dreams in sleep, and yet Sherlock was always struck by how vibrant and colourful their imagination could be. Even John, who was in many ways a very practical person, seemed to dream in vivid technicolour and sound. Sherlock was assaulted by a barrage of senses, smells of earth and hearth and home. He blinked and saw in it a wave of John’s childhood, a reckless sister whom he felt responsible for and a father that worked too hard. He saw a mother that fed her children the water that had been pulled from the trunks of arid trees or imported from afar, sickly in colour. He could taste it on his tongue, and it tasted to him like moss and filth.
sloshed. He kicked it up under his toes, bare feet feeling the grainy texture and reminding him sharply that he had left his shoes by the safety of fire and light. In his eyes, it seemed to glitter like pixie dust.
His blue eyes close as if he's going to sleep, then open an instant later. His entire posture changes. His grip loosens on the cane, tremble in his left hand relaxing. His eyebrows draw together in a scowl as he turns to look about him, wondering exactly why
She hadn't thought he'd back out in the end either. Sometimes, there was no choosing a Dragon. Sometimes the Dragon chose you. As acerbic and vicious as the best was, she didn't dare question that kind of selection.
John dreamt that night of a cold and remote crystal floor beneath his feet, shining in the dark of a seemingly endless black. The young man first became aware of it by the cold seeping into his bare toes, the hair on his arms breaking out into gooseflesh. His head darted upwards, eyes searching wildly for a trace of his home or Sherlock’s temple. What he found instead was emptiness, vast and deep and endless ahead of him save for a figure in the distance. A shadow, standing alone and tall, though John couldn’t see their face he could tell that they were at least humanoid in form. His dream-like state didn’t question this, and neither did his feet as they carried him forward, step by step towards whatever awaited him. In the silence of his dream John could hear the quake of his own heart in his chest. Somehow he knew that if the shade before him had truly been mortal, he would have been able to hear theirs as well. As he approached, the young man’s eyes adjusted to the darkness, and he came to see that it was in fact a woman he was walking towards.
John’s first dream in his beige little bedsit didn’t actually start as a nightmare. Those came later, once despair had time to well and truly sit in. Instead, his imagination painted for him a darkness that was profound and deep, his form swimming in it from the waist-up. He was dressed in military fatigues, and his dog tags glinted like twin points of light. He looked down, realising that it was water, salty and restless that he stood in. It was cold like ice, the floor of it slippery, and John kicked out in panic as he found it rising to his middle, then his chest. His toes came off the ground quickly, boots turning waterlogged and heavy. The more he lashed out, the deeper it seemed to get, and coldness made his limbs feel heavy and his blood turn to sludge. His uniform was like a lead weight, pulling him under, drowning him.
In the moonlight, it occurred to John just how alien his friend looked, bathed blue and silver in the dark with eyes far too wide, a figure curved femininely but taller than even a tall man. Then he considered his own appearance, and he felt a nervous flush dart over his skin. It was several moments before anyone could seem to get up from their disbelieving sprawls in the grass, and surprisingly the first of the Met to rise was Donovan. Her eyes were bright, but they were not looking at Sherlock, instead pinned onto John. Her voice stretched across the night, heavy with disbelief and something shockingly close to betrayal as she shouted.
If he squinted, he could just make out the rock face, shielding the cove on the other side. The red-black stone glinted wetly from salt-spray, shimmering in the setting of the sun.
been called. Blue eyes dart about, military training kicking in. Locked doors. Possible hostage beside him, but probably armed. Cameras are likely, given the expense of the car. He flips through John's memories, frown running deeper in a very un-Johnlike way.
Sherlock wasn't a stupid Hatchling. He knew when asking was really just polite demanding. Yet strangely, he found he didn't find this 'Jawn' quite so irritating as he gave him the supposed 'options' to pick from. On the one hand, the Dragon absolutely despised physical contact. It made his skin crawl, bad memories resurfacing and leaving it difficult for him to regain his composure when he closed his eyes and pictured the past. Yet he also knew he had no idea how to drain or refill the tub, as the mechanics were quite lost on him since he had never seen a faucet before this closely. He was sure he could figure it out, but it would probably require a fair bit of time and splashing, and he wasn't sure just how patient this Human was. It was quite possible that if he took too long he would be beaten, and though that soft face didn't seem like the type for unnecessary cruelty, there was a firmness in 'Jawn' that was hidden under his caretaker veil. Sherlock was not yet sure what kind of steel it was, but if it turned out to be the volatile type...
However, no mercy revealed itself. The wine found itself past John's lips, and a moment later the young man felt his knees give out from under him. The world swayed, streaking together and blurring, and only the arms holding him, scooping him up in an ironic bridal style kept John from losing the tenuous grip he had on the edge.
Neither word fit when he looked in the mirror, and so he slashed the words to ribbons, uncaring of the sting or the pull of the blade. Uncaring really of everything, as he lay on Sebastian's dirty bathroom floor, the fluorescent light keeping him awake and nightmares at bay even as his thoughts tore him apart. His Mind-Palace was far more frayed than his skin could ever be. At the end of the day, if he was a boy or a girl, he still bled red. Somehow, that thought was comforting. Comforting enough that his thoughts slowed, and Sherlock Holmes fell into a dreamless and dark sleep.
Sneak's slow, curling smile was content and blissful later on that evening as he lay with Sarah in her bed, content to spend the evening and
” He waved his fingers in jazz-hands style, grinning wickedly even as he licked crumbs from his lips. The Alter continued to speak, seemingly lost in his own memories.
And he might have continued, if the younger Holmes hadn't screeched at him, throwing the phone so it smashed into the wall, the receiver breaking into pieces.
“Yet you’ve remembered his name,” Mycroft murmured, watching as his brother flinched as though he’d been struck.
Daniel grinned, and the detective realized he got his first deduction (though really it was more of a shot in the dark) incorrect. He sighed, cursing mentally as he realized that there was nothing he could do. He gestured resignedly for the man before him to ask away.
The hint for the next chapter after this one is: Death. Make of it what you will ^.^ after this is when things begin to more or less fall apart for the boys for a bit...
Mycroft hadn’t noticed the boy when he first came, but he had an idea of just who the child was, and so could explain the enchantment that melted away and revealed him. He looked to be about Sherlock’s age, though smaller. His eyes were dark, and restlessly flicked from face to face as he crowd-watched. He’d taken no interest in the proceedings before, but now he looked up at Mycroft seriously. The expression he wore was nearly bored, if Mycroft had to give it a name. He spoke, his voice flat and musing.
at him just enough to keep him from hurting her. He tried to tell himself it was for that reason at least, and not because her company kept away some of the dark thoughts that were circling his mind as he curled back into the corner behind the couch. Absently, he nibbled on a piece of cake as his sharp eyes ran over the old woman, the
As it turned out, Lestrade’s hunch had been right- Sherlock was only in his early twenties, homeless, and high, but with no actual possession of drugs on him. This provided only small comfort truthfully, as Greg was still nursing a savage-looking wound on his arm, his team fed up with the man’s (
John mused about just how far he'd have to dig through Sherlock's brain to get to the heart of his thoughts before reluctantly admitting it was likely impossible. Instead, he let himself think of the Queen, so young and yet so powerful and of the children crowding the streets of Kandahar, many dirty and starving and tired.
“It’s nothing, truly. Due to the circumstances, I think it’s in everyone’s best interest if we do our best not to be at odds with one another.”  It was almost… sweet. John blinked, wondering if perhaps he had hit his head last night. Then, the other shoe dropped as Sherlock carried blithely on, seemingly oblivious to his betrothed’s mood. “You care about your people, and you’ve quickly proven that when distressed, you tend to find inventive ways to make the lives of people around you difficult.”
She felt exposed as she opened the door to the bedroom a crack, and the hair on the back of her blonde head tingled slightly as if she were being watched. Swallowing reflexively, she wished again that Sneak and Daniel weren't having a spat. Although even she thought that Sneak had struck a low blow last time with his stupid stunts. She was more than a little bit afraid of that personality, but only because her other brother thought him to be foolish. She took her other brother's word to heart, even though the others didn't like him. After all, her other brother had gotten rid of
Sherlock hummed as he felt John spend over his hand, stroking him until the man’s thighs were shaking from the stimulation. The two of them sat like that for a while after, after a moment John’s hand reaching up, tightening in Sherlock’s curls. In response, the detective curled his limbs about the smaller man, compacting himself and John into a tight curl in the centre of the bed.
However it was also triumphant, in the sense that John could feel the layer of ice that nearly always caged the man thaw just a bit.
“Like I was a part of you.” Sherlock finished the sentence, hearing it already in his head. John’s silence was answer enough; the Dragon could feel the man’s eyes boring a hole in him. He stared at the long shape of his wrists, at the delicate join to his hands. He had a tan now, miraculously. It wasn’t as dark as John’s, but it was definitely darker than he had been when he’d been adopted.
“What do you want to tell me?” John asked, meeting Mycroft’s gaze. The Dragon smiled, and something in his eyes began to glow a soft, blue light. The glow began to pulsate from the man, trailing like water in pooling form until it filled the room. John gasped, the sudden onslaught of Magic causing him to jerk upwards in his bed, to hell with his shoulder. He stared in awe as the white-blue glow began to fill the room, spreading a reflective sheen.
John found himself at Sherlock's side without even consciously realising he had moved, kneeling so that the detective was forced to look in the army doctor's earnest blue eyes. His voice was cool and clear-cut, and Sherlock read in John's posture that the man was obviously fighting off anger.
It was quiet, a comfortable calm settling over the two as they patiently waited for night to fall. Those clever blue eyes didn't flick towards her, but Sarah could tell somehow that he knew she was looking at him. She still jumped though, when his low voice murmured against the filter of his cigarette, answering her unspoken question.
He added the last part as an afterthought, as Sherlock's eyes flicked towards the walls almost eagerly as if he might like to Mark them. The Dragon snorted under his breath at the panicked look on the young man's face, having not considered claiming the space
The silence on the death of Barnes remained between the two of them, unspoken. By way of answer, the Dragon merely pulled on the Human's sleeve. Leading him towards their tent firmly. His tone however trembled as much as John did as they moved, not quite an apology, not quite an insult.
“We’re alright Holmes, seriously. John’s still out of it but with how weak I’m feeling, he’s likely gonna make a comeback soon enough.”
Sherlock didn’t respond, his eyes clouded and confused and his pupils pinpricks, heavy with pain and exhaustion. Instead he stared at John in what could only be described as dependence, hopeful and vulnerable. It was as if Sherlock’s entire world was pinpointed onto John’s existence, those eyes were so filled with complete and utter fixation.
' Claude couldn't help but perk up hopefully. Sherlock had once told John that he had been a rather infamous member of the homeless community.
“You're right. It was never my plan to have kids…” Harry's grip tightened on John's arm, but the little boy needn't have had the support. He was stone still, eyes wide as the very person he had thought would always want him admitted to having not
Softly, Sherlock responded. His voice was harsh and brittle. Still so gentle, despite the pain lancing through it.
Sherlock, to his credit, didn't seem to be in the mood to object. The Dragon was all but silent for the duration of the tube ride, but his wings flexed restlessly, turning an uneasy violet as he allowed himself to be searched by the bomb-squad at the front gates. Security nearly didn't allow John through - he had forgotten about the small pocket-knife he had been keeping in his pocket to peel apples for Sherlock (the Dragon had taken to experimenting with fruit, eating it in mass quantities as of late in a variety of ways and forms). When one particular officer became too aggressive in his questioning however, Sherlock's low snarl of warning quickly put John on the fast-track for admittance. Soon the pair were on their way, Sherlock practically sulking in the sweeping expanse of his coat.
When he was running as fast as he could, he couldn’t hope to think so much of Sherlock. There was a burn in his lungs, the twinge in his thighs that sang of
John’s dancing was left forgotten for the moment, and the ex-army doctor privately hoped that enough action would occur on this journey that it would be a permanent dropping of the subject.
John nodded, to which Greg pursed his lips and traced his still half-finished pint with one finger in contemplation. When he spoke, his voice was careful.
The second raid came in the dead of night, when the desert air had cooled off from its arid texture, plunging into polar-like temperatures in seemingly a moment. Seated atop a rapidly-cooling sand dune, Sherlock’s sharp eyes tracked the horizon mutely, keen gaze searching for something unseen. He had never truthfully gone to sleep, though John had dropped like a rock. The young soldier found flight practice utterly exhilarating, if not completely exhausting. It was a feat that required not only balance, but strong leg muscles, as well as an instinctive ability to predict Sherlock’s movements mid-air. John so far as a Thrall was leagues ahead of his colleagues, but that didn’t mean that it came easily to him. To be connected so long to the Dragon’s mind-frame proved to create a bit of an issue for the young soldier, as afterwards John found himself forgetting normal Human conventions such as speaking aloud, or stating where he was off to.
Sherlock saw him nodding to himself and smiled slightly, pleased that he had at least hooked the man's attention a little.
behind. There was no name behind his reason for flight, only an overwhelming sense of terror. A feeling of fear that his family would leave him behind, that he was somehow not needed to complete the Watson picture.
people responded. As it was his uncertainties, things that he had pushed aside with the impulsive desperation to save Sherlock begin to work their way into his mind. Telling him he's probably more than a little bit cracked to have even chased after the Detective at all. As if sensing his confidence leaving him, Sherlock's brow lowers in a rare display of concern.
And there was nothing, nothing at all to be done about it, because the only solution to the mistake would be to stop protecting John.
“I'm giving you a choice. You will get both in the end, but would you like to eat first, or have a nice cool bath?”
He could remember how the sun had felt against his seal-skin, shining and brutally hot. It seemed to evaporate even the suggestion of moisture from his body.
A low, rumbling growl filled the flat, and John looked up to see Sherlock staring at the point of connection between John and the intruder to his home. The young soldier's eyes widened as Dodge froze at the sound, a quizzical expression on her face as she looked behind her, taking in what had lead to Sherlock's sudden vocalisation. Her voice was dry as she looked at John.
“We can check you out in the same room as the other Dragon. Provided of course that you do not... antagonize the other patients too much. As you probably know, Dragons tend to make... irritable patients at best.”
A firm, solid hand pressing itself against Sherlock's chest. Not groping, just resting gently on the pounding of his heart. Unafraid. Unmoving.
“John!” Sherlock greeted enthusiastically. The Selkie seemed unconcerned with his nakedness as usual, holding in cupped hands what appeared to be some kind of crab. He presented it eagerly to his Mate, making a few garbled sounds that in his excitement he didn’t bother to translate into something John could comprehend.
It was then Harry spoke from where she was seated in one of the hard and unforgiving plastic chairs. She was still dressed in her pyjamas, hair mussed from not sleeping for an entire night while looking for her brother. Her eyes were large and serious.
Merina looked out towards the beach as she spoke, eyes tracking the waves as they crashed to shore. The waters at this time of evening looked brackish and dark, mysterious and edged with silver and red as the sun's last dying rays faded away. Like a jar of coins the water glittered, and John listened to the rhythmic pounding and found himself picturing his mum as a little girl, playing on the beach.
In the next instant, the Dragon had curled himself protectively away from John, wings flared and defensive green-gold, a blazing banner to mask the fear in the creature's eyes. John could see some of the Human form that Sherlock had kept to lately fade as scales over took more of his skin, and a low, threatening growl that didn't sound nearly as sure as it should be emerged from his peeled lips. John was surprised when a rippling, melodic language came from the creature's lips, repeating itself over and over again until something clicked, and Sherlock switched to English for the first time. Though his accent was as broken as a badly-strung guitar, John could understand him.
