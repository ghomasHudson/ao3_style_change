The two men still sway together in the silence, clinging to each other as the candle stubs flicker out one by one and the fire burns down into ashes.
“I feel like a breakable bloody Wedgwood figurine,” John grumbles.
The truth of the matter is John likes a wager, likes it probably a little too much if he’s being completely honest with himself. He enjoys horse racing or blackjack or five card draw, understands the strangely compelling thrill of calculating risk, determining the odds, using the unpredictable yet potent alchemy of brains and statistics and good luck to try and beat the house, sometimes even beat it big.
“Good to know,” Sherlock replies, then puts his new knowledge to use.
“Your names, please?”
Mary --
I may have been the one who pulled words out of the air and arranged them in a semi-coherent manner, in order to finally finish this story at long last...but as the saying goes, the real story here is the friends I made along the way.
“Rocco,” Sherlock says, in a kinder voice that John has ever heard him use with a client. “I know you’ve suffered a loss, and I know you wish to talk about it. But you need to get to the point now.”
, Sherlock’s rich baritone murmurs in his head.
“You know,” he says, “it occurs to me we’re leaving here with far more than we came with.”
They spend the entire evening staking out at the back of Big Pete’s Discount Furniture on 5430 Kidder Avenue, waiting for the building to go dark.
(Underneath it all, John has discovered that for the right person--for this person--he is a hopeless, helpless, stupidly sentimental romantic, and how he desperately wishes he weren’t. It’s exhausting, feeling these things, trying to control emotions so terrifyingly uncontrolled. It’s so very embarrassing for a private, reserved, properly British man to have these kind of melodramatic impulses bouncing around in his brain. Honestly, the whole thing is
"I know," John says quietly.
He turns away from the window of his office, swiveling his chair to face the pretty young department assistant smiling at him from the doorway.
“I’ll be back in a little while, I promise,” Sherlock says in a rush as he opens the bedroom door and slips through, closing it behind him, closing it on John.
Eyes fixed on the digital payout display in front of him, John is silent for half a beat too long, then exhales, shakes his head.
John’s own hair always grows out quickly, much to his annoyance in his bygone Army days, and has already gone shaggy around his ears and the nape of his neck. John can’t help but note that for the first and probably last time, his own hair is longer than Sherlock’s.
The smell of decaying blood seems to increase tenfold, thick and fetid in his nostrils, and suddenly the reality that John had been pushing away comes crashing down over his head.
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John snaps, annoyed. “Even the imaginary you gives me a hard time.”
“And when you did...you weren’t Irish,” Sherlock states. It’s not really a question.
“Of course,” Sherlock says dryly. “The whole encounter was closely monitored from the very start. I may be reckless with my own life, but I do try to be not quite so cavalier with yours.”
“I’m counting,” he replies.
From the corner of his eye, John can see the beginnings of the face Sherlock makes when he doesn’t immediately get his way, the familiar wrinkle of confused annoyance forming between his strong dark brows.
The man nods and gets back into the car, his body visibly shaking as he starts the ignition. John moves to Sherlock’s side as the car pulls away, tires squealing in haste. Sherlock is still breathing heavily, eyes wide and feral.
John looks at him, eyes large and uncertain in the gloom. Is he relieved or disappointed? Sherlock can’t tell.
“Yes, John,” he says quietly, floating in a dark, calm space now that the sharp-edged, desperate need has passed.
John's curiosity is far greater than his pain or exhaustion. “How bad was it?”
“In point of fact, that’s exactly what I am doing. Is it working?”
“No, it’s not.” Sherlock looks away, closes the dishwasher carefully, presses the button to start the wash cycle before he speaks again, not quite making eye contact. “For the record, John, I am actually capable of not being a dick on occasion.”
“Well, then.” Mrs. Hudson draws herself up to her full five foot three of pure focused disdain and gives John a look that unmistakably says, Not bloody likely. She places a package of Chocolate HobNobs on the countertop as she shifts her gaze to Sherlock, her face softening into motherly concern.
“Okay. Yes.”
Sherlock cracks open one bleary eye, registers the sliver of deep blue sky through the dusty window, sunlight pouring through the glass, He recalls the snowstorm, a white blanket reflecting back the sun, making the morning light dazzlingly X-ray brilliant. It’s
. I was gravely wounded, in mortal danger, and you went to Mycroft for help. He calculated the risks, and when the plan fell apart he did what he had to do. That was his decision. What you did was exactly the right thing to do. The only thing you could do.” Sherlock’s hand wraps around his wrist, slender fingers gripping the bones tightly. ”How could I possibly blame you, when I’ve done the same exact thing myself?”
Sherlock’s eyes are icy with affront. “Still waiting to hear your
What he says is simply, "Marry me."
Sherlock is so tired, so sick to death of the whole thing.
“In addition, he is an uncommonly keen observer. He could be a great asset to your investigation, I believe.”
After Sherlock is gone, the room is suddenly and eerily quiet. It somehow feels like he took all the activity and energy from the room, leaving John suddenly and disorientingly alone, with his endlessly swirling thoughts as his only company.
“And what about you?” John asks.
“Go back to sleep.” Sherlock’s voice is quiet, but thick and dark as treacle, vocal cords roughened from stress and sorrow and lack of rest.
“It will do,” he says softly, almost to himself, and there is a universe of pride and sadness and grief and joy in those few murmured words, and it breaks John’s heart in the best of ways. “Yes. It will definitely do.”
“Bit of a hurry, love?” John asks.
The dispensary counter itself is behind a thick layer of bulletproof Lexan, as befits the neighborhood.
Tamara takes the papers and disappears.
The two of them fall silent for a bit. John is just starting to drift off when Sherlock speaks again.
John watches his hands ball into fists; he feels detached from his body, a bit, somewhat removed and above the rage that flows through his veins right now, almost as if he allows himself to feel the rage he might actually implode.
He straightens his shoulders and does not break eye contact, staring her down, daring her to challenge the truth of his words.
“We have so much to deal with, just between the two of us. So many broken pieces that need to be glued back together. But I think we can. I think we can do this, and that’s what I want. I want... this. Us.  I don’t want to play Moriarty’s stupid little reindeer games any longer.”
“I was sure, John. I was
, John tells himself sternly.
Both of them, of course, know full well he’s lying.
“Tell me,” John growls against his mouth. “Tell me how good it feels when I fuck you hard.”
Sherlock groans at the very thought.
“Shut up,”  Derrin shakes off Alan’s hand, drains his glass, slams it on the table. He fixes John with a cold, murderous stare. “Go home and suck off your posh little boyfriend, Watson. You’re not welcome here.”
“I know,” John says, in an exhale that’s not quite a sigh. “Just not happening today. Suppose I’ve slept too much.”
Sherlock is, for the hundredth or thousandth time, both amused and amazed at himself, marveling at how much he’s changed, how his language and behaviour shift when they’re having sex, his words shamelessly vulgar and lewd, his enunciation growing slangy and lazy.
This terrible,
“New mobile,” he said. “I’d like to see you every day, I’d love to, but I’m going to leave it up to you.”
“Yes,” Sherlock gasps, fisting his cock. “Anything.”
“I just…” now it’s Sherlock’s turn to sigh. “I’ll be fine, John.”
Even to a mushy, barely awake John, that level of medical observation clearly indicates he’s almost certainly in intensive care.
“I could deal with a mindless car chase or two, I suppose, if I get to spend it in your company,” he says, and he probably intends for the words to come out sarcastic but instead there’s a soft fondness there that gives John a warm, glowy feeling inside.
“Good boy.” John kisses his shoulder in answer, tongue tasting him as it trails across the top edge of his collarbone. His right hand remains over his heart while his left weaves through the curls at the back of Sherlock’s head and pulls, firmly but not cruelly, bringing Sherlock’s head up to look in the mirror. In their reflection, John pins him with his dark gaze, eyes gone hooded and dreamy with lust. Sherlock is mute, transfixed, utterly unable to look away from the face of his beloved captor.
At the sight of the viciously opened flesh Sherlock makes the tiniest involuntary gasp, just a whispery huff of air through his teeth. He quickly plucks a fresh towel from the dwindling stack behind him and wraps it around the wound, large hands cradling his injured limb with a tenderness that cuts John to the core. Anguish is written plainly all over Sherlock’s face, in the way his full lips thin as he presses them together hard, the way his pale eyes take on the unmistakable glitter of unshed tears as they look up at him.
“You say that like it ever stops you,” John replies dryly.
“Because this is the last time I’m going to kiss you for the first time. And this time, I’m going to do it properly.”
Mycroft looks utterly unruffled. “‘A spring wedding, then?” he intones smugly. “Mummy will be so pleased. There will be lilacs. Bushels and bushels of lilacs. And all the
“Well, that’s one for every day of the week and two for Sundays, so at this rate I think your wardrobe will survive the loss. Anyway, that’s what you get for wearing a white shirt to chase down a serial dismemberer.” John takes another swallow of the water. “How about the suit jacket?” he asks.
“Do you want me to kiss you...now?” Sherlock asks.
“Very possibly, but we don’t have time to explain it all right now,” Sherlock says, “We need you to help us. Katie has just erased all of her social media accounts, and Adam as well. They’re going to run, and our only chance of getting John’s daughter back is if you call her, right now, and find out where they’re going. Can you do that, Patricia?”
“That’s very…practical,” John says lamely.
Sherlock gives a little laugh against his mouth. “You’re just saying that.”
He pauses, and Sherlock looks at him with amusement.
There are a few random pieces of decayed furniture scattered about what used to be the sitting room--a side table, a rotting couch. The flocked wallpaper is peeling and there is a heavy, earthy smell of mildew in the air.
“You first,” he murmurs.
“Oh yes,” John reptiles archly, “you dewy young ingenue born three full years later. My goodness, no, it’s thirty-eight full months. You couldn’t possibly understand my dated cultural references.”
“You could tell me what happened,” he says, quietly. “If you want.”
John’s not wearing pants. His cock easily springs free from his jeans, proud and stiff.
“He was shot barely a week ago,” Sherlock points out.
“But is that what John Watson truly wants? Are you what he truly wants? Are you what he needs to be happy?”
Sherlock groans into the pillow in frustration.
It’s the best he can do, and he supposes, going by the trajectory of the past several days, that it is enough to suffice. He’s never been one to dwell on his shortcomings, at any rate, and now doesn’t seem like the right time to start.
John opens drawers and pokes through stacks of neatly folded shirts; plain cotton, nondescript workingman’s clothes. Underneath them he finds stack of photographs. Most of them look older, but one of the snapshots was taken in this very room. A dark haired man sits in a desk chair, his back to the camera. A slim, sharp-featured brunette female reclines fully clothed on top of the made bed. She is smiling, but her eyes look sad, lost.
"You should play a bit," John suggests. “Some music would be lovely.”
Patricia looks at him, wide-eyed, still processing the information. She shakes her head. “I don’t… I don’t even know what to think. I can’t believe Katie would get involved in something like that.”
“And if the machine doesn’t work?” John murmurs.
Sherlock doesn’t waste breath answering, instead going straight for the door handle and pulling hard.
What Sherlock means, of course, is nursery furniture and items for the baby. John had somehow never fully processed the fact that of course the three of them would be living at Baker Street, and of course arrangements needed to be made for their return, and of course one of them is undeniably an infant.
“Really?” Sherlock murmurs, lips curving into a tiny pleased grin.
“No,” John says with a disbelieving chuckle and a shake of his head. “No way.”
“God,” John breathes. “
“Dr Holmes made him. He’s... he doesn’t know what he is. Sherlock does research. I do genetic engineering. We’re co-workers. Friends, I guess. Well. Kind of.”
“We should have left,” Sherlock says, voice cracked with grief and guilt. “You wanted to try to get to Paddington. We should have left.”
“Five days,” John tells him. “Thank God for greedy morons. One of the goons that snatched you kept your mobile instead of tossing it like he was told. Lucky for us he couldn’t pass on the lure of a new iPhone 6. Mycroft had military-grade GPS installed in it, of course he did, so we tracked the arsehole down and got the information out of him pretty easily.” John’s fingers tighten around his. “Mycroft’s pissed at you, by the way, for getting involved in that Hungarian business without letting him know. I didn’t know you’d kept him in the dark, so I tend to agree with him, but we can discuss that later.”
For all the commotion, Martinez looks positively unruffled as he focuses on John as if seeing him for the first time.
Sherlock had spoken in hasty defensiveness earlier, when he had brushed John’s advances aside.
Sherlock stills and pulls away slightly, breaking the kiss. His brow furrows in unmistakable (and, honestly, quite reasonable) concern.
In Sherlock’s defense, it’s not like he
The noodle stall nearest his flat isn’t very good, but it is cheap, and John is cold and soaked to the bone and hungry enough not to care much about dubious quality.
“That’s good,” John says, almost breathless with relief, unable to keep a grin off his face.  “In fact, that’s marvellous.”
Okay? Please.
“Good,” Sherlock says from behind the wall of newsprint. “We’ll leave in twenty.”
“The Browning is in the locked metal box in the back of the wardrobe in the upstairs room. The combination is 0910. It’s unloaded; the spare rounds are in my sock drawer, left hand side.”
"John. Look at the body."
“In a minute,” John rasps, reaching out for Sherlock’s hand.
out of my house and then we’re just going to forget any of this ever happened.”
“What do you want?” he murmurs into Sherlock’s mouth between shuddering breaths and messy kisses. “Anything. Anything at all.”
John turns back around to her. “Yes?”
“Who’s asking?” he sneers, not bothering to hide his annoyed disdain.
John pulls back, kisses his forehead. “Anything, love,” he murmurs. “Anything you want.”
David’s somber expression softens as a small smile touches his thin lips. “I will. I promise.”
A few minutes later the text alert beeps. Sherlock waits for a red light to pick it up and look at the message, then types out a brief reply before returning the phone to his pocket
After his mental inventory, John is passing the time by watching Sherlock examine the various and baffling buttons and dials on the telly control when there is a soft knock at the door.
The unguarded relief and affection -- no,
“Professional. As in...oh, shit. You took a picture to indicate...you mean to put a
“I think perhaps I have. Maybe more than you realise.” Sherlock is speaking slowly, almost hesitant. “Last week, when you came over to Baker Street and I was out...I was at an appointment. With, um. My therapist.”
“I want it, John, I want you to fuck me, I want it more than anything. God. Please.”
“I was rather hoping you would,” Sherlock tells him.
“If we leave right now, we can get the magistrate to sign off in twenty minutes,” Lestrade says apologetically. “I know how badly you want to rush in there and rescue Sherlock. I do. But if Kevin Lee is the monster we think he is, I absolutely don’t want him to skate away on a technicality. Neither does Sherlock. Neither do you.”
This isn’t what I want to do,
“Thank you.” Sherlock kisses him once more, this one a quick peck, no less affectionate for its brevity. “Let’s get you back to bed.”
“I suppose it is.”
He likes it.
“Fuuuuuuck,” John groans, tossing his phone aside, his head sinking back down into the pillow.
“Two more bites, Sherlock,” John says, hating the wheedling note in his voice but unable to stop himself. “Or I’ll sit on you and force it down your throat.”
“I feel --” Sherlock breathes out, and lets the last bit of his constructed self crumble, lets his mind slip away completely, and it’s finally peaceful, still and quiet, the thick sweet tide of subspace flowing into him, soothing the sharp and splintered edges inside his mind and soul. “I feel exposed. Vulnerable. Shame, humiliation, producing a strong catecholamine response and amplify -- amplifying arousal. And I -- I like it.”
Sherlock senses the change coming over him and pulls away slightly, giving him a quizzical look.
“I love you so much,” John says quietly, “and I love what we do, when we’re doing it. I just don’t always like myself much, after.”
John huffs out a chuckle and pulls Sherlock’s long pale legs up over his shoulders, but his face grows serious and intense as he positions himself against his slick and loosened entrance. They are gazing into each other’s eyes as John presses slow, oh so slow but he doesn’t stop, just pushes into him bit by bit and the stinging fullness is almost too much for just a moment, making Sherlock whimper once, low in his throat.
“Sherlock, yes. Oh,” he breathes, shaking, as his come slicks their fingers. “
Something in his tone makes John stop, turn around.
John slides his hand around to caress the base of Sherlock's skull, savouring the feel of thick silky curls sliding through his fingertips as they kiss and kiss, tasting each other, exploring each other’s mouths, their kisses less clumsy now, lips slotting easily together with a touch more ease than before, a comfort level borne of just slightly greater experience.
“I did not know that,” John says. “I feel like maybe you’re on the brink of a new quarantine project.”
“But Jesus, I’m only human,” John grumbles to no one as he walks down the pavement, eyes on his feet, his breath puffy clouds in the chill night air.
“Chicken and wine in a pot. That’s not a big deal.”
He picks up John’s hand, turns it palm up, and presses his lips to the sensitive skin there, sending hot, shivery sparks up his spine.
So the question, then, is this:
By the end of the ninety-minute car trip, I had most of the story fleshed out in my head.
Ever since he had come back from the dead, Sherlock had dedicated himself to making John happy, no matter the cost to himself...and John hadn’t even bothered to notice.
“He was fried.”
Silence.
“It’s too bright in here,” John says, and photoelectric shades darken the panes of glass, plunging the room into a dim grey twilight as he removes his overcoat and takes the seat opposite Sherlock.
“Ta for that,” John grumbles, annoyance sparking back into life. “
“What if we promised,” Sherlock says. His hands come down to grip John’s biceps. He grins at the perfection of the idea. “Right now, today, we promise each other that no one is leaving ever again.”
“But what?” Sherlock’s voice is just slightly sharper. “But that’s different, is that what you were going to say? And why would that be?”
“Is this a...permanent shift in accommodations?”
. The man abruptly releases Sherlock, who stumbles back a step before righting himself.
. So how could I be better than you deserve? In fact, how could I possibly be good enough, Sherlock? How could I even begin to be
Of course, he doesn’t succeed, his anxiety growing with every step, tying his stomach into knots.
“Which is?”
“Yes, John.”
far.”
He’s burning with anger, his emotions spinning dangerously out of control--but God damn it all he finally feels it, for the first time in so fucking long he can actually fucking taste it, touch it, feel it as it flows through him, a river of rage and sorrow and frustration.
Seb squeals and jumps, darts out of the entranceway, dropping his battered shoulder bag as he scrambles away. He pauses, turns back, eyes the woman with a carefully calculated air of frightened, childlike uncertainty.
“I know it would be a completely different experience,” Sherlock replies with calm certainty. “I can’t explain it fully, but you have to trust me on this.”
The past is done and gone. It can’t be changed. But it’s barely even behind him, the scars on his mind and heart still as fresh as the ones he has on his belly, and John can’t shake the feeling his past isn’t done with him, not quite yet.
“I don’t care,” Sherlock cuts him off, quiet but emphatic, enunciating every syllable. “I don’t give a damn if you're not perfect. I don’t want perfect. I never have. I just want
“Please, God, John, make me come, I promise, I'll come so hard for you --”
“Intend to,” John says as he leaves, closing the front door behind him.
Sherlock hums in mock contemplation. “Counteroffer. Fluids, no food, toothbrush, and a hot shower. With you in it.”
“Yes,” he says softly. “Yes, I believe it is.”
She looks up to the ceiling as if trying to find one last ounce of patience up there. “And by your doctor, you mean you.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Sherlock says, and slips the chain over his head. The stone, still warm from John’s skin, nestles over his heart like it was always meant to be there.
This narrative, while not particularly explicit or pornographic in any detail is very, very difficult and potentially triggering. It contains intense discussions of the emotional aftermath of rape and abuse.
Also, the change from 'Maria" back to calling her 'Mary' is very intentional on my part, and speaks to upheaval and loss of emotional distance.
“We need petrol,” John points out helpfully. Sherlock doesn’t reply.
Tangle-haired, hollow-eyed and in need of a shower, Sherlock had gone pale and deathly still on the couch. His celadon eyes were open and unseeing, giving him the air of a living corpse, a development which always scared John much, much more than the shouting, cursing whirling dervish he had grown accustomed to.
“She took a bunch of my clothes and my credit card,” Jennifer replies. “Called me up out of nowhere, said she was back in town, needed a ride and a place to stay. We used to run in the same...social circles, you could say. Once upon a time.”
Sherlock nods and disappears back into the main living area.
“Pills and water,” Sherlock reminds him, before ducking into the loo for his own ablutions.
Sherlock pauses. “I should probably get --”
have.”
There is more of this story to tell (obviously), so check back in a bit and see how that's coming along.
“Not much of a businessman, though, if you’re putting every quid you make into your arm.” Lee makes a face, opens his mouth to reply, but Sherlock cuts him off. “Please, don’t bother. Takes one to know one, and you’re high as a kite right now. Can’t stop talking, inappropriate euphoria, labile affect. Speedball, I’d guess. Heroin and cocaine, both pharmaceutical grade.”
“You’re amazing,” he breathes into his sweaty skin. “God, you’re so beautiful, you’re so amazing.”
Sherlock swallows down the whimper rising in his throat, willing himself into blank, patient stillness.
“It’s from the painkillers,” she says, letting him off the hook, letting him have his last shred of dignity. “They make people emotional.”
thinks Sherlock.
“I’m going to work, Sherlock. It’s a new thing I’m trying on, working for a living. Charming little hobby.”
John has been hovering close to the breaking point for days now.
” John echoes archly as he sets his mug down on the table in front of the sofa. “If I haven’t been kidnapped, help me understand what’s going on, then.”
John had almost choked on his drink at Sherlock’s words. “Really,” he said, aiming for polite interest and missing by a mile.
“I’m just going to start the washing up,” Sherlock says, not meeting his eyes.
Sherlock lets out a plaintive, raggedy whine, his eyes screwed tightly shut as his hips rise off the bed, seemingly of their own accord.
“I never said -- I never meant --”
he thinks.
Ah, hell with it, he decides, remembering what he and Sherlock got up to earlier in the morning. After that, he deserved a good nap. Even if he had been coming off of ten hours of sleep.
“There’s always a chance,” Sherlock says, “But she posted her running log to Facebook this morning as usual, as well as an Instagram of her post-workout vegan oatmeal breakfast only forty minutes before she called you. Of course, it’s possible she arranged all that as an elaborate fake-out as part of some nefarious plan, but it doesn’t strike me as
“Moving on,” Mycroft states bloodlessly. “As far as the...exact nature of his experience, Sherlock was, unsurprisingly, less than completely forthcoming about the details of what occurred. Actual physical findings on his person were relatively minor. Moderate abrasions, bruising, swelling and the like. He was given prophylactic antibiotics and antiretrovirals. The STI panel was negative, and remained so at three and six months.” Mycroft closes the folder, puts it aside, steeples his fingers under his chin in a manner very reminiscent of his brother. “All this to say, what happened to Sherlock in Serbia has, thankfully, not caused him any permanent damage to his physical health.”
“I thought you preferred to be on top,” Sherlock murmurs, kissing his neck, nipping at his skin.
“Finally,” Sherlock exhales theatrically as he rises, but before going into the bathroom he comes up behind John as he’s closing the refrigerator, dropping a kiss on his shoulder and wrapping long arms around his waist. “You know, you never did yell at me,” he murmurs against John's neck, tickling the short, bristly hairs there.
John wonders, briefly, when talking to imaginary companions became a routine part of his life.
Sherlock would love to watch John sleep peacefully in his arms forever, but the fire is warm and his body is sated and his eyes are drifting shut before he’s even finished the thought.
“You hope to make a career of it?”
“It’s fine,” John reassures him. “I’m safe as houses here, and I can’t wait to wear my own clothes.” He considers for a moment, looking over Sherlock’s positively gaunt frame. “And eat something. Please. You’re pale as a sheet of paper and almost as thin.”
John turns on the small bedside lamp, then pulls out his mobile and plugs it in on the charger on top of the dresser. He’s pulling off his jumper and jeans, leaving on his usual night wear of pants and vest, when the sound of running water stops and Sherlock emerges from the bathroom.
.” Sherlock’s words are level, but John doesn't miss the flicker of subdued amusement in his eyes.
“Someone with an interest in sending messages in floral arrangements," Sherlock replies, with that familiar, didactic
“All right.” John kisses the nape of his neck, his hair. “Thank you, pet, for telling me. I’m so proud of you for telling me.” He presses a gentle hand to Sherlock’s chest. “Deep, even breaths, now.”
He closes his eyes and drinks, his hands visibly shaking as he lifts the bottle to his lips. When he opens them again his gaze is blank, staring fixedly at nothing, and it rips John apart inside to think about what horrors Sherlock is reliving in his mind’s eye.
“That’s not the point, Sherlock.”
The baby’s due date comes and goes without a mention from either of them.
In between faking a death and marrying someone else, the waters do tend to get a bit...muddied, after all.
“Put it in me,” John rasps between gasping, panting kisses. “Now, Jesus, Sherlock, please. Just--”
Sherlock exhales. “Of course I am,” he replies, still sounding a bit shaken, not really sounding completely okay at all. “It’s just...a lot. To process.”
Sherlock gets in on the driver’s side, and they pull away from the hospital. Despite the frisson of nerves John felt earlier, it still feels incredibly good to see that giant silver box of a building in the rearview mirror.
"Don’t be ridic--” Sherlock cuts himself off with a huge, jaw-cracking yawn, then sighs, shifts his weight.
He’s on the police radar, now, and there is little he can do on the fly to alter his appearance, except remove the loathed tartan jacket. He shrugs out of the hated garment with no regret and tosses it carelessly aside, then whirls towards the counter and takes a half step towards the cashier.
While John waits for the area to become fully desensitized he sends Sherlock upstairs to scrub his hands, with the admonition not to touch anything on the way back down. Sherlock complies, though not without giving John his very best 'I’m not a moron' eyeroll.
“Hmm.”
She narrows her eyes with barely-concealed annoyance, but refuses the bait. “Call me Louellen, then,” she replies evenly. “John, I suspected your true identities, but you’ve left a trail of conflicting and frankly confusing accounts in your wake. I needed to make sure, and the most straightforward way of calling Sherlock Holmes out of the woodwork is...well, frankly, you.”
“You wanted to summon Sherlock Holmes?” John says, his tone sardonic. “Well, you succeeded. And from the sounds of it, he is incredibly pissed off.”
“No, no, no no,” Sherlock whimpered, his voice ragged, on the edge of tears.
Glenn chuckles briefly before he checks John’s reflexes and his temperature, then wraps the blood pressure cuff around his arm. The machine hums and squeezes, releases. Glenn rips the velcro apart, takes the off the cuff, notes the results.
“How’s your pain?” he asks.
Sherlock busies himself with finding the promised clean clothing and taking them into the tiny loo, while John raises himself to sitting upright, carefully unhooks himself from the IV -- a whole lecture from the nurse just in that move, he’s certain -- and oh-so-gingerly swings his legs over the side of the bed.
He seems concerned that John isn’t eating enough; he’s unearthed a packet of custard cream biscuits in the pantry, setting a plate of them on the coffee table alongside the tea mugs.
Sherlock obeys, making a low, raspy moan as his hips start to move in counterpoint with their joined hands.
,” Sherlock mutters, finally succeeding on his fourth attempt.
John gets the fuck out.
As he knew it would, the call goes directly to voicemail yet again, making John curse and smack the doorframe in frightened frustration.
“You maybe don’t have to mention that I came around,” says John, looking away in embarrassment.
“Where do we start?” John asks, surveying the cluttered desktop. “And what are we looking for?”
John looks away briefly, tongue darting out to his top lip, then he turns back, grasps the lapels of Sherlock’s coat and pulls him close. One warm hand comes up and slides gently into Sherlock’s hair. John’s eyes are wide and dark in the light of the streetlamps.
Sherlock sighs in assent, wraps his lips around the straw and drinks.
John shakes his head. “Us Watsons can hold our liquor,” he murmurs with a small smile.
“Really truly,” John tells him. “Did you like it?”
“Maybe that’s why he went too far, because I always stood by him. But the baby...I knew he went too far, I did, but I went along with it anyway. I knew it was wrong, and I didn’t stop him.” She shakes her head. “That’s on me. It was his idea, but I didn’t stop him, and I’m to blame for that.”
He dresses carefully and dries his hair, waiting for John to ring the doorbell, trying to ignore the nerves gnawing away at the pit of his stomach. He’s pacing the sitting room, crossing back and forth across the faded rug on bare feet, when he hears Mrs. Hudson open the front door. Sherlock is not at all surprised to hear Mrs. Hudson speaking in fond tones, and John’s deeper voice growing muffled as she envelops him in a hug at the foot of the steps. Sentiment and fondness won her over in the end, and Sherlock can’t help but smile a bit at the notion.
“Oh. You know. Pirate stories. Economics textbooks. Herman Melville. Creation myths of indigenous Amazonian tribal groups. The usual sort of thing.”
They stay like that for several long moments, breathing together, unwilling to break the fragile spell between them.
“This gun.” John gestures with the firearm for emphasis. “Small, lightweight, easy to conceal. I really like it. I think I’d like to keep it. Sherlock, what do you think?”
Sherlock nods, dips his head back down, kisses his chest again, tastes the edges of the scar with his tongue, then slips further down, closes his full lips around a pink nipple, sucks experimentally.
“Can I…” John begins, tentative. “Can I show you how?”
“Wouldn’t hurt to double check.” Sherlock spends a few minutes bouncing about the small room, picking up a few last odds and ends, checking drawers and closets. It’s so unlike his ordinary demeanor that it doesn’t take a genius to see that despite his displays of outward confidence, he’s not entirely sanguine about John leaving hospital. John is more than a little anxious, as well, and Sherlock’s displacement activity soon begins to grate on his nerves.
“I want to do this forever,” John sighs as he rides him. “You’re so good, baby, God, I love the way you feel.” His hands wander across Sherlock’s chest, thumbs tracing circles around his peaked nipples. “I love the way you look underneath me,” he whispers. “You’re so beautiful, Christ, you’re so beautiful, I can’t fucking stand it, you don’t even know.” He dips his head and kisses Sherlock, his mouth tasting of wine. “I love fucking you like this.”
“Of course,” the woman replies as she settles herself into a floral side chair next to the sofa.
“We go to their house,” Sherlock says. “We’re most likely to find  the information we need there.”
“Very good,” John said. “It will be over soon, and then you’ll be forgiven. Now, spread your knees apart a little for me.”
“An hour or so, I suppose.”
, which makes things worse, in a very real way, then they were before.
“Okay,” Martinez says. “Whatever. Long as I get paid, this is between y’all, not me. When and where is this transaction to take place?”
“Okay,” John says, shaking his head in disbelief. “First of all, we have a firm no hitting limit--”
As always, John knows exactly what Sherlock wants, even before Sherlock himself does.
“He gave a full confession before he lit himself up,” John adds. “Also, I dunno how many people Lee had working for him, but there’s a bloke in the walk in cooler who might know things.” He swallows. “Also, there’s bodies in there. Four. Wrapped in plastic.”
But John doesn’t look at Mary, instead turning his attention to the EMTs.
Sherlock’s arousal is evident, the hot ridge of it nudging deliciously against the underside of John’s bollocks, and John can’t help but rock against it, his hips undulating gently as Sherlock’s huge hands grow bolder, roaming down his flanks, curving around his hips, slipping around to cup and knead at the bare flesh of his buttocks.
“I’d rather not take the chance,” murmurs Sherlock. “Besides, I don’t have anywhere else I’d rather be right now.”
“I don’t care. It’s rude and inconsiderate.”
So he takes his time, slowly pressing into his body, opening him with the utmost care as he takes his cock fully into his mouth at the same time, giving him pleasure to ease him past the initial discomfort, the burn and stretch of using his body in this way for the first time. John lavishes attention on his prick, taking the shaft deeply into his throat, sliding his lips all the way to the base before pulling back, bobbing shallowly, lavishing attention to the sensitive crown for a few moments before taking him in all the way again, letting his glans push against the back of his throat. He takes Sherlock close to the brink; sensing the tensing of his muscles and altered breathing of approaching orgasm as he backs off, stilling his movements for a moment.
Sherlock ignores him -- John really wasn’t expecting an answer -- and sinks down into the blue vinyl chair. He steeples his fingers under his chin, eyes fixed intently on the unassuming bit of greenery.
“Now, you were saying something about that wet shirt?” John says, a note of gentle teasing in his voice.
John reaches out, then, encircling Sherlock’s wrist with his fingers.
She insists on bringing out the good cups and saucers and fussing over loose tea rather than bags, and an apple crumble magically appears, and between this and that it’s almost eight when Mrs Hudson clears the cups and saucers away.
“Doesn’t matter.” John mutters to no one in particular as he shrugs, miming indifference. “He’s a grown man. Didn’t ask for his help anyway, did I.”
not right
But Sherlock’s arms are warm and strong, and John soon falls asleep despite his roiling thoughts.
Seb swallows down the lump in his throat, nods, and again finds Jim’s lips with his as he makes himself believe, if only for a moment.
He rolls his eyes and almost leaves--but damn it all, he really is interested in that thyroid and it will just get cremated with all the other bits if he doesn’t take it home.
Two nights later John is surprised by a knock on his door.
Please forgive the mash note to Wawa. It's basically my favorite store in the whole world.
As Lestrade strides over to him he apparently can’t decide between grinning with pride and rolling his eyes right out of his head at the detective’s reckless foolhardiness. It makes his face look like he’s having a stroke. Sherlock tells him so.
A lot of things happened, he almost says, but that’s evading the question and he knows it.
“It's not," he finally concedes, too bone-tired to offer anything but the truth.
is the word about to spill from John’s mouth, but he reconsiders on the fly, decides not to go with the guilt trip that implies. “I’m glad.”
The pharmacy is smaller than the usual chain chemist's; it's perhaps a bit dated in appearance, paneled walls and fluorescent fixtures overhead, but the aisles are clean and well-lit, and the shelves fully stocked. John expects Sherlock to stride briskly to the dispensing counter at the back of the shop; to his surprise Sherlock chooses instead to take his time, wandering down several aisles, closely investigating product displays, bending down to investigate the merchandise on the lower shelves.
“You still--” Sherlock’s voice is wavering, uncertain. “Even now, you still. Find yourself worked up. Over me?”
“Not to bring up the utterly mundane,” John interrupts, “but we also really need some clean clothes.”
“I want you to fuck my mouth,” John says, soft but direct, the filthy words tumbling out of him unchecked his usual filter of reticent self-consciousness derailed by his bone-deep instinct to give Sherlock what he so desperately needs. “I want you to fuck my mouth however you want to, and just give yourself up to it, let yourself feel good.” He mouths and the tender skin of his inner thigh, licks delicately at the softly-furred crease of his groin. “Can you do that, love?”
“Because you’re not really a gangster, are you, James? You’re a grifter. ID theft, bank fraud, online credit card rackets. You recently lost a considerable sum in the Bitcoin meltdown, hence the move back into real world crime. You’re educated --  William and Mary College, BA in Economics, 2005 -- and possess true insight into the nexus of money and human psychology. When you learned of the power vacuum that currently exists in Atlantic City organised crime, you immediately saw the potential of it all: the money that goes through this city every day, the vast amount available to be stolen or skimmed or embezzled here.
“What did he tell you?” Sherlock asks flatly.
“Thanks.” He takes the clothing; Sherlock withdraws his arm, closes the door carefully. John pulls on the boxer briefs and tee, then enters the bedroom to find Sherlock is standing at the desk, jacket off, his back to John. He holds a half-full plastic bottle of what looks to be exceedingly cheap vodka in his hand.
John absolutely does not want to go to A&E like this, with a serious self-inflicted knife wound, if it can be at all avoided. He’d be evaluated, possibly sectioned. His medical license could be jeopardised.
The two of them sit in companionable silence against the headboard, Sherlock’s long pale legs stretched out alongside John’s much shorter ones.
“I know that.”
Sherlock nods, swallowing back tears. This is mortifying.
“Oh you did,” Mummy chimes in. “Just loved it.”
“Your class insecurity is showing, John,” Sherlock remarks, sounding very much the posh, condescending git he’s so very capable of being. John has a sudden, very real impulse to punch him in his patrician nose, but he’s got no desire to tangle with the US legal system at this juncture, so he settles for glaring at the back of his obnoxious neck as they go through the checkout lane and pay for the items.
It’s a large city, so parts of it are of undeniably beautiful, and other parts of it are...quite rough and tumble, to put it kindly. But either way, the streets feel
“What happens next?” John asks the empty room, not even quite aware he’s speaking aloud, giving voice to the doubts and fears of his heart. “Even if it does end well, if we find her and take her home. What happens next?”
and even as angry as he is he really, really doesn’t want to do that ever again.
“So do you,” John says, as his hands tighten on Sherlock’s hips. He sighs. “You always feel so good.”
Outside the sitting room windows, their city rages and convulses and dies.
I liked her for a reason. So nice of her to send us something to keep us entertained.”
John just chuckles. “Anything has to be an improvement on old fryer grease and warehouse floor. Also, I stole some of your shampoo.”
He feels Sherlock’s body tense, feels his cock grow hotter and harder against his own.
, John thinks, the fine lines etched into the thin skin around his eyes and mouth visible even in the smooth slackness of deep sleep. His skin is pale to the point of greyness, drawn tight over razor-sharp cheekbones. He can’t go on like this, he really can't. He’s going to get ill or collapse or have a breakdown if this continues much longer.
John doesn’t answer. He feels queasy as he sips at his now-warm (and worse for it) drink.
“I need my hands free,” John points out.
“Get. The. Fuck. Out.”
John places the iridescent sliver carefully in the bag. “Gloves are for preserving the integrity of evidence for trial. Replicants don’t get trials.”
(And despite Greg’s reassurance, John finds himself wondering if what happens next to him will involve being classified as a Category A prisoner.)
“Of course you do. I’ll just call you Fox Mulder, shall I?”
“Not a bit,” Sherlock says mildly. “But I believe in you and me.”
Sherlock. What went on before, he bears most of the blame, but I…” she shakes her head, flaps a hand at him. “Never mind, love. I go on, sometimes.” She stands, straightens her skirt.
“No, I know that,” John says, abashed, willing himself to not glance at Sherlock. “Apologies.”
Sherlock breathes out, quiets the last trace of clamour in his mind, and obeys without question.
The flame of anger builds into an inferno as john opens his wardrobe and pulls out his dress uniform and battle fatigues and slashes them apart, throws a wooden box of photographs and mementos across the room with such force the wood splinters apart, pictures and papers spilling down.
were to manifest in physical reality, John is absolutely certain some of the levels would resemble nothing so much as here, the quarter slots floor at the Bally’s Atlantic City Hotel and Casino. Greed, sloth, gluttony...any and all of the deadly sins could applicable here, honestly.
“Shut up,” John says without bite. “You knew what I meant. Back to the question. Do you?”
“There was--” John gives a short, self-conscious chuckle. “There was--an attempt, I suppose you could call it.” He winces a bit and shakes his head at the memory, a hazy recollection of a long-ago dorm room misadventure lubricated only by spit and alcohol. “Not, um, a successful one. But I’m older and wiser now. Well, at least older, and I’m absolutely certain we’d have a better go of it.”
“I am very physically attracted to you. I am, I can’t lie about that. I very much would like to be physical with you, to share that with you, and I would be sad if we don't get to have that. But you need to know, Sherlock, I loved you with all my heart when I thought we would never be more than best friends. I was always willing to spend my life with you, eager in fact, for reasons that have nothing to do with sex or physical intimacy. So yes. I would stay here with you, forever.”
about a case. But I just -- the forecast is calling for a sunny day, and I’m a bit sick of these four walls, so I--” he rolls his eyes, blows out a breath. “I just fancied a walk, okay? You certainly needn’t feel
“No cane. No limp. I guess a little action fixed up that crossed wire in your head.” The Chief claps a moist, meaty hand on his shoulder; John steels himself not to shudder. “Three more to go, then. Come on, Lestrade.”
, he decides, resolute. This is is his burden, John decides, and right or wrong he can’t -- he won’t -- ask Sherlock to bear this one with him. It’s not a secret, exactly, but it’s something he will bury deep in his own heart, carry the wound with him until the unseen injury someday heals into another rough, jagged scar.
Sherlock whimpered.
“Yeah, oh fuck, yeah,” John groans. “Just like that, so gorgeous, fuck, come for me--”
“Excellent. What can we further deduce?”
Sherlock falls silent again, thoughtful and distant as the panda turns on to Baker Street, pulls up at the kerb in front of 221B.
He’s exhausted, in body and soul, but he pushes on. For his daughter. For Sherlock. For the possibility, however remote, of all of them making it through this alive and unscathed and returning home to the cozy, dusty, desperately-missed rooms of Baker Street.
“We fought like cats and dogs,” she says as if Sherlock hadn’t rudely interrupted her. “He was immature, you see, and I was insecure, and all I ever wanted was to be sure of him.” She looks at Sherlock, her eyes motherly and kind but also no-nonsense in her own voluble fashion. “Maybe John needs to be sure of you.”
True to John’s initial assessment, James proves himself far more interested in living to see another day rather than risk his life in violence. After a moment of deliberation, the three men make a break for the nearby exit.
“Good afternoon, Ms. Hallman,” Sherlock begins. I’m William Scott, with the International Criminal Police Organization.” He flashes an identification card that John has never seen before. “And this is Inspector Greg Lestrade with the Metropolitan Police of London.”
-and gazes sleepily at John.
Sherlock takes a deep breath and turns to face him. John looks up at him, stormy blue eyes soft and kind, crinkled with affection and concern.
John’s voice is low and a bit hoarse, but the underlying tone of command is unyielding. Sherlock almost sighs in relief.
As Sherlock begins to drift down from his climax John eases him through, gentling his touch as the aftershocks make him shiver and twitch, kissing his shoulder, his hair. Sherlock releases his hand and John lets go of his softening cock, surreptitiously wiping his hand on the sheets before stroking his trembling flank.
“I promise,” Sherlock says, rough with unspoken feeling.
Sitting alone on a park bench, his tea long since gone cold, John takes a deep breath and tries saying the truth out loud for the first time in his entire life.
Sherlock sighs theatrically, handing the keys over to John.
Many thanks to the gorgeous and talented bittergreens for keeping my characterization on point.
“That’s not fair, Sherlock. This is one of the best trauma centers on the Eastern Seaboard, and these people are trying their level best to help him,and you know it. How many times do you have to do this before you realise taking out frustrations on the people
The shopkeeper nods. As the man is sliding the fifth of clear liquor into a paper bag, someone rudely taps his shoulder. He turns to find Lestrade looking--no,
Jim opens his eyes. His fathomless dark eyes are filled with sorrow and guilt.
“It’s okay,” Sherlock says, his voice soft and kind in the darkness. “No harm done. It’s okay.”
Sherlock obeys.
Sherlock swallows down the sudden but so-familiar bloom of fear and excitement leaping up into his chest, bright and hot. Now is not the time. He shakes it off, exhaling through his nose as he mentally boxes his reactions up, walls it off before his sympathetic nervous system catches fire and causes his body to visibly, embarrassingly react.
John knows Sherlock is correct (if a bit needlessly rude) about the ordinariness of his appearance; he’s always had an unassuming air, always been easy to miss until he wanted to be noticed. It’s a quality he’s used to his advantage many, many times and it serves him well in their current situation. Nobody sees him, not really.
“How about number four?" Sherlock pesters him. "You had half a banana ten hours ago. Go in the kitchen. Make a cheese sandwich. Take you all of five minutes.”
one--so I don’t have any data. But it doesn’t seem like something I would do.”
“Sherlock.” John takes a half step closer; Sherlock is vibrating like an angry cat, all tensed spine and sharp angles. “That’s your system. You delete things all the time. I don’t… I’m sorry, I really am, but I’m not quite understanding.”
, so you could outlast him, outlive him and Moriarty both, you could get out of there and come back to Baker Street.”
“I’m making tea,” he says, and his clipped, no-nonsense tone anchors Sherlock, tethers him to the moment. “Go wash up. I want you naked and on your knees next to my chair in ten minutes.”
“That’s not true,” Sherlock says, backing up half a step. “I ate eggs and toast this morning.”
“The story you've spread around says you’re from the rough streets of Baltimore, but that’s not quite true, is it? You were born James Winters. Your mother is a critical care nurse from Puerto Rico, you father is a cardiothoracic surgeon, both employed at Walter Reed Medical Center. You’re telling a partial truth about being from the Baltimore
“Evelyn,” he hisses, clearly furious. “Allow me to make this
“Really,” he says, carefully neutral.
He snatches up his phone, checks the time. 2:07.
“Very nice,” murmurs Sherlock appreciatively.
“Good morning,” chirps the lad behind the register, hazel eyes crinkling at the corners as he looks at John.
Patricia, who had been keeping it together admirably up well until this moment, dissolves into terrified tears. “I didn’t tell anyone!” she gasps. “I swear, Mister Holmes! I wanted to, I really did, but John trusted me and I would never endanger a case, hand to God. I didn’t say a peep to anyone! You can look at my phone if you don’t believe me!”
“I’m sorry,” Alan repeats.
, brought him willingly to this vulnerable and human state, and somehow that awareness is stunningly, viscerally erotic.
“You almost died,” Sherlock says, and it comes out almost accusatory in tone.
After dinner, Sherlock gathers dishes and takes them to the kitchen before returning with John’s refilled water glass and several pills, which he places in front of John.
Off his feet and with a fresh round of pills in his system, John feels a bit badly for his earlier strop over Patricia. He mans up and does the necessary, sending her a friendly opening text.
Sherlock doesn’t respond, though, letting her vent, letting her unspool her tale without interruption.
Over and over he hits Sherlock, hard and unyielding, making him sob and shudder with each sharp blow, and the rhythm of it sends John into some kind of hypnotic state where time itself slows to a crawl, the inexplicable need inside of him both soothed and inflamed by the ritualized violence, by the shocking power and intimacy of inflicting pain on the one he loves most in the entire world.
“I’ve missed you,” John tells him, simple and heartfelt.
“Who is the blonde woman?” Sherlock asks bluntly, gesturing with the photo in his hand.
“How long?” John asks, tenderly carding his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.
His head swims just a bit, the blood rushing to southern regions as the familiar, insistent heat makes itself known, beginning to build between his legs, making his cock swell and thicken against the flannel of his pyjama bottoms.
“I checked his neck for a pulse, even though I knew he was dead,” Rocco said. “I just...I had to touch ‘im. Just to make sure.”
To his credit, the nurse doesn’t pay Sherlock’s rudeness the slightest bit of mind, focusing instead on the task of checking over John’s vitals.
“Hungry?” he asks, rising from bed and pulling a pair of clean gym shorts from the laundry basket parked on the side chair. “I don’t think we’ve anything in, but maybe takeaway? I could murder a curry right now.”
John shows his badge to the first likely stall he finds, an elderly woman tending her collection of mechanical koi fish, gold and yellow and black creatures knifing elegantly through still water.
“Fantastic,” John replies, his own voice still a bit breathy and uneven still.
Johnson gives a short, unpleasant bark of laughter. “That’s not going to happen, buddy.”
been him.” She smiles, a mocking parody of a just-between-us camaraderie. “Tell me,
John curses under his breath as he moves to the window. The rain has stopped; he watches Sherlock leave the building, coat swirling gracefully about this his slender frame as he disappears around the corner, out of sight.
Sherlock flipped Winters onto his stomach and cuffed him as John took the pistol and tossed it into the far corner of the room before sinking  to the floor, clutching at his injured thigh.
there, someone shot him in the eye, who would
” He huffs and folds his arms. “Anyway, you two dumb bastards better work this out, cos God knows no one else wants to put up with either one of you.”
Sherlock closes his laptop, rises from the chair and peels off his hastily pulled-on denims.
“Patricia,” Sherlock says, calm and direct. “I need you to stop crying now. This is incredibly important. Can you do that for me, please?”
,” he observes.
in front of Mycroft) and steeples his fingers under his lips, trying to force the headache out of his brain through sheer force of will, trying to
“How did you know that?” Jennifer asks.
“At the moment, no,” Sherlock admits. “But if necessary, it wouldn’t be difficult to obtain at all. He’s likely left a digital trail a mile wide.” He lights his cigarette, puts the car into gear. “In my experience, smug and crooked men like Caldwell always do.”
He shakes off the thought as he rinses, shuts off the taps, dries off with the inadequate towel.
Sherlock snatches up his phone from its resting place on the bedside table, swipes and taps with the controlled intensity that means he’s on the brink of a new discovery. He smirks in triumph before handing the phone to John.
He’s out of ratty jeans and tees and back in his own tailored clothing, slim black trousers and a light grey dress shirt. The recent past still shows, however, in how the shirt is visibly overlarge on his too-thin frame, and in the way his hacked off hair is sticking up in awkward tufted clumps. His lower legs hang off the edge of the folded-out sleeper, socked feet dangling in a way John finds endearing even now, in his compromised mental state.
John clears his throat. “Listen, if it will help we... we have a whole nursery set up. I can have it all sent over for her. I want her to have it.”
“John.” His voice is a tiny, broken gasp. He can’t get any air, he can’t breathe, he can’t think--”John.
“Scrubs?” John asks.
He breaks the kiss, and looks at the man in his bed. John’s eyes are wide and dark in the lamplight.
“You complain
It is an undeniable psychological benefit, John realises, not to have his his arse hanging out in the wind. Wearing pants is such a silliy, trivial thing, but it makes him feel more like himself agan, less like a helpless victim of fate.
John’s gaze shifts over to Mary’s face and suddenly he sees her clearly, perhaps for the very first time. She stares back at him, her harshly shadowed features twisted into a grimace, her wide, coldly blue eyes holding nothing but anger and contempt.
“Oh Shan,” sighs Jim. “If only you could see the things I’ve seen with your eyes.” He pauses, leans forward, pinning her down with the unblinking dark gaze she created. “My questions?”
It’s like he never left, except now there’s snogging and orgasms, and it’s absolutely bloody marvellous.
And John wants, he does. He wants more in this moment than he could ever put into words, wants
He shrugs and types “Small med large? ziptop or slider?”  and sends the message to Sherlock.
“I know, pet,” John says, kind but firm. “I know, but it’s time to roll over now.”
“I have to, you know I have to,” John breathes into his skin as he releases the tiny metal jaws. Sherlock screams.
“What kind of work did you have her do?”
“Hey,” John replies, his voice a gravelly rumble.  “Where’d you go?”
After damn close to a year... back to the story! Thank you so very, very much for your eternal patience and support. There's no way I would still be hacking through this jungle without you.
“Stop this nonsense,” John says aloud to no one, and picks up the call.
“But you can’t understand, John, how completely your brain shuts down, in order to protect itself, in order to survive. You can’t understand how your world narrows down to four walls, a bed. A hand wrapped around your windpipe as you endure another violation, counting out your life ten seconds at a time, telling yourself can survive this--survive anything--for just ten more seconds. And after awhile, nothing else seems real. Nothing else matters.
”You love this so much,” John murmurs. “Restrained, abused, in pain. You’re going to come from it, aren’t you? You’re going to come so hard, ruin your lovely knickers while I watch.”
He closes the front door carefully but firmly behind him as he leaves.
While he contemplates the spectrum of human mental disorders, however, another part of his mind is mulling over the more important question of Doing Something Nice for John. He was on the brink of figuring out just the right course of action when this inopportune snow thing brought John home early. However, he always prefers having John with him rather than at dreadful boring stupid work, so he’s not overly put out at having his thought process interrupted.
John does as asked, then seats himself at the kitchen table with his glass, sipping pinot as he watches Sherlock work. Sherlock places the chicken pieces in the bowl of wine for a brief soak, then reaches for his own glass.
him--it sends hot, possessive shivers of desire down his spine as they move together, hushed and quiet, the crackle of the fire and their quickened breathing and the slide of flesh against flesh the only sounds in the silent flat.
“I’m going across the street to get coffee,” he says as he reenters the sitting area. “You want anything?”
Which means, getting out of this is going to be entirely up to John.
D'Annibale is pronounce "Dee-annibelle."
“...John?” Sherlock asks, his voice uncertain.
“This is beautiful,” John murmurs. “I really didn’t -- I don’t know what I expected, really. But considering what we’ve seen so far, this is... this is
“You’re so beautiful,” John whispers. He slides his hands across Sherlock’s chest, thumbs brushing across his nipples then trailing down the flat planes of his stomach. “So perfect.” A warm hand slips under his balls, cupping and rolling them, making Sherlock moan low in his throat and arch back into John as his cock grows fully hard. John wraps his warm palm around the shaft, strokes him gently, brushes his thumb over the wet slit just the way Sherlock likes.
“Yet when she turned up again, you helped her,” Sherlock said. “She called you, out of the blue after decades, and you helped her.”
He finally says the words he has to say, his voice breaking.
“Habits should change,” pants John as he grinds himself back on Sherlock, seeking more depth, more pressure, just plain more. “You feel fantastic. Jesus, Sherlock. Oh.
Sherlock is able to take John entirely with relative ease, needing only a few slight pauses along the way in order to accommodate the fullness and stretch of him. He settles himself fully onto John’s thighs, savouring the fullness, a feeling of deep, primal satisfaction. A burst of tender affection washes over him. He brushes a stray bit of fringe from his John’s forehead with gentle fingers.
, John.”
He unbuttons his cuffs, takes off his shirt, sits on the ruined mattress in jeans and vest and examines the cut. It’s really barely more than a scratch on the inside of his forearm, just north of his wrist, a little over two inches long. He must have slashed himself with the knife while shredding Mary’s things. He never even felt it.
“Thanks,” John says, giving the detective a brisk, slightly impersonal handshake. “It’s good to be back. Really good.”
again. Do you understand me?”
He peels himself partially away from John’s damp skin as he pulls himself upright, positions himself between his bent knees, opens the tube of lubricant. John hears the tiny squelching noise as he squeezes the lube onto his fingers, hisses a small intake of breath as Sherlock smears the slippery gel between his cheeks, over his hole. He seems to hesitate a bit, presses his warm damp forehead to John’s shoulder, his fingers still tracing circles around his entrance.
John grabs Sherlock’s right hand, brings it to his mouth, licking the palm, broad messy swipes of his tongue against the rough, salty skin of his palm. “Touch yourself,” he says, and it comes out harsh in his need, more aggressive than he intended, and he almost apologises but Sherlock shivers and moans at his words and then obeys, curling his spit-slick hand around his shaft and stroking himself in long, rough strokes as John pulls all the way out, pauses, and drives back into his body hard, setting a punishing pace, balls bouncing against his perineum with each desperate thrust, as he balances on the knife edge between taking his pleasure and holding on long enough to give Sherlock what he needs to--
“Tell me your colours.”
John grabs his wallet and leaves the room without another word.
John is drifting back to earth, reinhabiting his somewhat battered skin as he rolls cautiously onto his back. He is discovering that while a resounding orgasm doesn’t appear to be fatal, it is very likely going to be an unwelcome amount of soreness. He gives a small, somewhat inelegant grunt.
“So, blade runners are judge, jury, and executioner.”
“Shut up,” John huffs as he swipes ineffectually at Sherlock's hair, but after a moment a chuckle escapes him, and soon they’re both snickering like naughty schoolchildren at a juvenile dirty joke.
John nods and struggles blearily to his feet, picking his jacket up from where it lay across the tabletop and shrugging one arm into a sleeve. Long fingers grasp the shoulders of his jacket, making it much easier for John to get his other arm situated. Sherlock briefly smooths the black fabric over the slope of his shoulders, then gently turns John to face him. One eyebrow quirks upward as the barest ghost of a smile crosses Sherlock’s face.
“Stay here tonight,” he whispers.
The trip down to med-surg is quick and uneventful, Glenn and the silent technician piloting John’s bed expertly down the hallways as Sherlock follows, carrying both the garment bag and the hospital-issued plastic bag that contains the everything John had on him the night he was shot (minus two handguns and one ankle holster, John presumes), as well the few random possessions accumulated during his stay so far.
John snorts. “What, you’ll call the police?”
The pain is phosphorescent, his nipple on fire, and this time he cries for real, tears streaming down his face as John suckles and licks, the cooling saliva quenching the terrible burn. As the pain finally fades, the endorphins kick into high gear, pain and pleasure merging into a whirlpool of quicksilver tension, hot and demanding, filling his groin and belly, a rising tide held back only by the thin strip of black leather wrapped tight around his purpling, swollen cock.
“Yep.”
“I don’t think they’re designed for that level of abuse,” John replies with a touch of amusement. “Oh, well. Even if they don’t, still money well spent in my book.”
“Others have let him down, but you’re not,” he says, low and quiet. “You care about what happened to him. I know it feels like it’s making things harder, like it’s tangling you up, but it’s what will push you to solve this case. It is an advantage, this time.”
John’s footsteps echo in the hallway and he re-emerges into the cocoon of orange firelight, damp flannel in one hand and a small, square black box in the other. He tosses the flannel to Sherlock, who makes no move to catch it, allowing the cloth to land squarely on his chest.
Irene laughs, reaches for a skimpy black camisole, pulls it over her head. “You think I would be working in this cesspool if I could afford a real snake?”
“Piss off.”
Still feeling somewhat dazed, John allows Sherlock to guide him into the hotel, one hand pressed to the small of his back. At their room he swipes the keycard and turns the handle, gently ushering John through and closing the door behind them with a quiet click.
The steady beep of the monitors does not change. His desperate attempt at communication raises not a blip from the equipment attached to his body, and the world-renowned consulting detective for once fails to notices something of import, distracted by heated conversation at hand.
They were, John thought to himself, the absolute luckiest bastards in the entire world.
Something crunches, wetly.
Sherlock is almost fully hard again, his cock rising stiffly away from his body. John reaches behind himself, digs in the rumpled sheets for the lube, locates it. He manages to flip the cap and pour some into his palm single-handedly, then recaps it and tosses it back onto the bed.
They haven’t been physically intimate since the kidnapping, now ten days past; even their frequent casual touching has all but ceased.
“Tell me,” John says, his eyes darkening.
“I asked if you had any plans for the summer hols,” Dad says. “We’d been looking at going to Greece, you loved it there when you were young, didn’t he, Mum?”
“Because you need to have...full agency, I suppose is the phrase,” John tells him. “You need to be the one to decide what you want, and when, and with whom.”
“Be back in a little while to check on you.” Glenn gathers up a few last bits of paper, tissues and straw wrappings before he leaves, easing the door shut behind him.
“Badly enough to play good boy and stay?”
John shakes his head, gives it up for lost as he settles for the universal language of bodies, his mouth finding Sherlock’s, lips and tongue conveying the feelings he cannot put into words. Sherlock moans just a bit, low in his throat; his hands find John’s shoulders, pushes him against the mattress and climbs on top of him, caging his shorter frame with his long, deceptively strong limbs. John can’t help but groan a bit, a slow-building, delicious friction growing deep in his pelvis as he cups his warm, plush arse with both hands to pull him in closer as their hips roll together.
Suddenly, despite everything --or, perhaps, because of everything -- John feels like he never really knew the man next to him at all. He wonders if he ever will.
John realizes the moment of silence has stretched out too long in the same instant Irene attacks.
John smiles, warm affection growing tinged with something darker, more feral. He kisses the corner of Sherlock’s full, lush mouth. “Tonight, I want to teach you kissing. Will you let me? Will you let me teach you how to kiss properly?”
Sherlock has put aside thoughts of their interaction this morning, and the repercussions that await him, for the entire day while he focused all of his energy on solving the case.
John knows this.
“I know. I don’t care.” Sherlock pauses, considers. “Is this all right, though?” he asks, curiously, formally polite considering their current respective positions.
“Okay. But we can’t let that keep us from moving forward. Every day we spend here the risk of losing her grows. Johnson knows something’s up now, and we don’t know what he’s going to do next. We have to get in front of that.”
