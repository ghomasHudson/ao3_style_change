“Very nice,” the general complimented. “Large enough for riding, good musculature, strong wings. Shall we fit you for a saddle?” Sherlock snorted, looking back at John who shrugged.
“Enough,” John shrugged, patting Sherlock's neck. “Are you going to bring me the package?” The man glanced through the letter a second, then gestured for the two men behind him. They came forward and John realized that one carried a package roughly the size of a melon. John reached out and wrapped his fingers around the string holding the box closed and pulled his hand back quickly. The men didn't move to leave so John backed away, depositing the package in one of Sherlock's packs and tying it closed securely. He stepped into the stirrup and hoisted himself up as Sherlock started backing up. The dragon growled one last time then with a firm flap they shot into the air, gaining altitude quickly.
“Thank you,” he said softly. “For allowing me to ride you. I needed this.” Sherlock glanced back at him, golden eyes glimmering and made a series of whistling happy noises. They flew for another hour before Sherlock headed back towards the base, aiming for the back of the hospital tent. He landed smoothly, wings tucking against his side as John slid down, wobbling on his feet.
John grumbled again as they made their way down the musty hallway. He wanted nothing to do with this, had tried to get out of it, but the army had insisted. As a doctor he would need something to watch his back, something to protect him when he was kneeling over an injured soldier.
“We'll at least get all the fittings for the harnesses and armor,” Bowen said, stepping closer to take a better look at Sherlock. The grey dragon made a noise of distress as he drew nearer Sherlock and the general shushed him. “We're fine Lestrade.” Lestrade sighed, wings stretching and closing. Sherlock looked bored, tail curling in a half circle around where John still stood. Suddenly the door burst open and a man came running in.
“Sherlock can you carry him!” John yelled up at the dragon. Sherlock shot another attack, smacked another man away then grunted, turning to help John push the man upright. The man looked scared to touch the huge creature but John urged him up, putting him in the saddle and instructed him to hold on to the handle. Sherlock was already attacking again and urged John away from the middle of the fray, keeping him protectively under his wing. The fighting was dying down as they neared the edge of the battle and John thought he saw Lestrade fly overhead, shooting a few more sonic booms. Another shadow and Lestrade landed in front of them Bowen sliding off and hurrying towards them.
“Well I'm here to take over the tent, why don't you head back to yours before someone else comes in,” Mike told him, gathering up the spilled supplies from the night before. Molly who was a wisp of a girl in human form, hurried after him to help, giving them one last smile.
“He's amazing,” John whispered. “I'll take him.” Greasy, as John was affectionately thinking of him as, groaned and went to fetch paperwork and some unlucky handlers.
I thought it was a fitting term of endearment/name for a mate for a dragon, no? also a subtle/not so subtle reference to Smaug
“Please sit,” Bowen insisted with a smile. “I know you're still healing.”Sherlock entered as John was easing down in to a chair, stretching his leg out in front of him. The dragon grazed his shoulder questioningly and John gave him a tight smile to let him know he was all right.
“Please?” John pleaded. “Can I just try first?” They all looked to Greasy who finally nodded his head slightly.
They'd been flying for hours when John realized they were losing altitude. As they descended from the clouds he noticed the ground below them had become wooded and a misty fog was settled over the tops of the trees. The closer they came to the ground, the muggier it got till John was questioning whether or not he'd be able to remove his jacket without falling off the dragon. Sherlock started a wide circle, descending as if to land and John noticed the small clearing below. When they were about 50 feet above the clearing Sherlock leaned and dove, slamming into the ground and bounding a few paces. John immediately slid from his back, shrugging the jacket off and walking around trying to get his balance back. He felt bow legged from riding for so long and Sherlock chuckled in that chirrupy way of his before shrinking down into his human form. He shook the rest of his harnesses off, digging through one of the bags and pulling out a pair of cargo pants that he yanked on briskly.
“Should we be leaving?” John asked suddenly, followed by a watery sneeze. Sherlock nuzzled against his hair, tightening his wings around them and nodded slightly.
“Sherlock please,” John pleaded, picking up the clothing again. “We'll be fine. Bowen wouldn't send us if he didn't think we could handle it.” He urged Sherlock to take the jumpsuit again and it was snatched out of his hands but Sherlock didn't put it on. He stepped right into John's bubble, glaring down at the soldier in annoyance.
“Think you can ride?” Sherlock asked after giving John a few minutes. John nodded, accepting Sherlock's help as he wrapped an arm around the man and lifted him gently. John swayed slightly but steadied himself and released Sherlock to stand on his own. He nodded once and Sherlock stepped away, sliding into his natural form and towards his abandoned harnesses. John shook his head to clear it then bent to help Sherlock get into his harness. Sherlock laid all the way down to make it easier for John to climb up and gave him plenty of time to get adjusted before he took off again. He headed back into the cloud cover, wings pumping steadily, trying to fly as gently as possible. John meanwhile was just concentrating on holding on, bending low over the saddle and trying to keep his head clear. He must have hit his head on the ground harder than he'd originally thought. His eyes were getting heavy, the world around him skewing and he vaguely wondered if Sherlock was doing spins through the sky. That couldn't be possible though because he wasn't even holding on to the saddle. The wind was blowing and he turned his face in to it and realized the ground was getting closer. He thought he heard a shriek then it all went black.
“Sorry?” Sherlock shrieked. “You almost die and you're sorry!” John winced, hands moving to massage his temples delicately.
“Gauging emotional reactions,” Sherlock shrugged. “Assessing weaknesses. The sort of things government officials like to keep track of.”
“That is...unusual,” he commented. Sherlock glared at him, continuing his work until John's entire back was covered. “You never showed interest in any I showed you before...”
John didn't go back to sleep but lay there and listened to the brothers arguing softly with each other. Across from him, the egg was still in it's nest, stones glowing softly with heat around her. He started thinking about plans, what they could do to stop Zane, then cursed himself for slowing them down. Why had he run? If he'd just stayed still, he'd be fine. He got angrier at himself the longer he laid there until he was shoving himself to his hands and knees with a grimace. Trying to keep quiet so Sherlock wouldn't hear him. He was tired of being a burden to the dragon. Finally, he managed to get to his feet, swaying slightly, and took a few steps towards the entrance. His vision started to darken around the edges and he tried to push past it, and groaned when it tunneled worse. “Fuck...” he moaned as he started to fall.
Sherlock seemed perturbed as they made their way to the tent, grunting and huffing, electricity crackling over his scales. It kept stinging John's hand as he was leaning heavily against the dragon to help support his injured leg.
“John! John!” Sherlock was screeching, smacking his face lightly. John groaned, head shifting from where it was pressed against bare skin. “What were you doing?” he demanded, voice still too high pitched and loud.
“Those....creatures!” he spat, fingers curling in front of him and John watched his claws lengthen slightly. Sherlock was barely under control, his whole body shaking. The soldier took a step back fearfully and Sherlock's shoulders dropped slightly, claws shortening. “They're experimenting on children John. As if capturing and enslaving dragons wasn't enough, they're performing experiments on our children! Trying to make us more obedient, just soulless killing machines.” He looked sad now and when he looked up at John his eyes were that icy blue again.
“Shh,” John whispered, one hand going to his temple and the other pressing over Sherlock's mouth. The dragon glared at him but didn't say anything more, helping the doctor sit up gingerly. “Help me up.”
“Moriarty,” Sherlock finally mumbled, blue eyes glancing up at John. “He's very interested in me for some reason. I haven't yet figured out why.” John sat up and started as Sherlock climbed up beside him, pressing into his shoulder.
“Your lackey attacked what is mine,” Sherlock grumbled. “You will wait until I am done caring for him.” Mycroft turned and glared at the dragon who was staying in his natural form a good distance away. “I do need you to do something for me though.”
“Ambushed by a dragon sir,” John answered as Mike finished up his wrapping. “Got hit with a fireball when he attacked. I think he must have belonged to the enemy.” Sherlock, who knew exactly who the dragon belonged to, looked down and kept quiet.
Sorry for the long long delay. Sometimes the words just don't wanna come and I haven't had a good writing mood for a while.
“Sir, I beg you, you don't want to bother with this one,” the man tried again. John turned and glared at the greaseball.
“I am a dragon though John as much as that annoys you,” Sherlock snapped, easing John down to the ground again. “We are bigger, stronger, more resilient, and faster than anything a human could be capable of. When you surround yourself by dragons, yes, you will get hurt. Yes you will appear weak. Because in comparison to me, you are. But if you compare yourself to your fellow humans, you are quite extraordinary. I mean for fuck's sake your back is in ribbons and you're trying to refuse pain medication and walk about like nothing is wrong. You're amazing John and for the love of all things shiny will you just lay down and let yourself heal....please.” He brushed the doctor's tears away with the pad of his thumb, leaning forward and kissing his brow gently. John finally nodded and accepted the soft kiss to his lips with a hum of pleasure. “That's my ghivashel,” Sherlock smiled, nuzzling against John's cheek. He helped the doctor lay back down on his belly and proceeded to work ointment in to the expanse of his back, hands gently kneading until John was blinking sleepily and quite relaxed.
“We'll get you some pain meds and you can get some much needed sleep,” Mike told him as he took a bottle and syringe that Molly had ready for him. John took the injection without so much as blinking and eased down into the cot gingerly, allowing Sherlock to curl up against him. It didn't take long for the drugs to take effect and he was letting the darkness take him as gentle fingers carded through his hair.
“No,” Zane interrupted. “You treat him as an equal when he is your property.” Sherlock bristled, a low growl coming from the back of his throat. John reached out and wrapped a hand around his forearm to keep the dragon calm.
They landed in a dense forest, the dragons dropping in to the upper most branches then slinking down the dense canopy until they could hop to the forest floor. Sherlock immediately changed and to John's surprise so did Lestrade, the dragon changing in to a middle aged man with silver-grey hair and a friendly yet firm expression. He smiled warmly at John and gave Sherlock a look of exasperation as he pulled on a pair of shorts and started digging through a pack. Bowen accepted the map Lestrade handed him and rolled it out on to a nearby rock, gesturing for John and Sherlock. They all gathered around the map of the facility, Bowen pointing out their route, where they'd find the package they were picking up, and the way they should get out so as to not be seen. He vaguely pointed out where he and Lestrade would be providing the distraction, warning them to stay far away from that area.
“Dr. Watson,” the man greeted, shaking hands firmly. “I'm general Bowen. Found a fiery one I see.” Sherlock snarled under his breath, and John swore his hair stood on end with the electrical charge in the air. “My bad,” the general corrected, smoothing his arm hair down. “A lightning drake then.”
“I can see it,” Sherlock said softly, eyes on his plate. “One of my talents I guess, seeing the truth.”
“We don't have time for the harness,” Sherlock explained quickly. “You're just going to have to hold on.”
“If it wasn't for you I'd be dead,” Sherlock said simply as he drew away. He ran a hand through his curls again and got to his feet. “I'm gonna keep watch for a little while, go back to sleep.” He stepped forward sliding into his dragon form before John could say anything else and slipped out the door. John scratched his head in confusion but curled back up on his cot, pulling his blanket up around his shoulders.
“That...” Bowen breathed out heavily. “Was some damn fine flying.” John grinned, he didn't need told, he knew how amazing Sherlock was. Seconds later an explosion rocked the ground below them and panicked yells could be heard through the dust and debris.
“I'm tired of being a burden!” John snapped finally, turning to glare at the dragon and loosing his balance. Sherlock caught him gently, looking down in confusion. John's eyes had brimmed with tears and his grip on the dragon's arms was tight. “You're always taking care of me, I'm always getting hurt. You get hurt and you just shake it off and go on being amazing. And don't you 'I'm a dragon' me, god dammit,” he interrupted when Sherlock opened his mouth.
“Come on Sherlock,” John said gently. “Forget about it.” Sherlock gave the dragon one last glare that made the other visibly shrink before turning and following John, wings unfurling slightly. As soon as they had stepped into the next room a man was beside him and grabbed one of his wings without warning or asking. Sherlock snarled, whipping the appendage away and knocking the man back.
Once he was settled, the blanket under his chin, Sherlock lay down next to him, curled on his side and facing him. He didn't touch John except to wind their fingers together, face carefully blank.
Bus, off course! The first Mets officer hadn’t even had time to get out of her police vehicle and Sherlock was already running. As he ran his mind worked in highest gear, trying every possibility and rejecting the answers as quick.
“Aren’t you,” John starts voice unsteady, he coughs and then continues, “The package, aren’t you going to open it?”
He hated Starbucks, they all looked the same, the coffee always tasted the same and the staff never stayed long enough for you to recognise them, always new spotty teenagers replacing the old. Sherlock preferred to visit the same places over and over, people he already knew who would take his eccentricities as they were.
John looked at him in confusion, “Sherlock?” He asked stretching a hand out towards him, and Sherlock fled.
was all John’s confused brain could tell him as Sherlock started into his eyes. He tried to look away but only succeeded in focusing on his lips instead which only made things worse. Holmes’s breath smelled fresh, like mint. His probably smelled like old coffee, he should have brushed his teeth before he…
Sherlock, dressed in a white lab coat, was leaning over dead man number two, whose skin was so white it was competing with the walls, lips blue, drained of any colour. Having your body emptied of blood does that to a person. Sherlock didn’t notice; he was looking for something else. What, he wasn’t sure about yet; but there was always something which connected victims in cases like this. Always.
Watson almost cried out in dismay and yet again forced his eyes to fix upon the screen: “Focus John,” he muttered to himself.
What was he doing to John? Did his friend even know what he was doing? Was he in his right mind?.  Oh god what was he doing.
Sherlock was standing in the big bay window, back to him, playing some erratic tune on his violin. His posture straight, neck gracefully bent to allow his head to rest upon the instrument.
The place was as run down on the inside as it had appeared on the outside. If it had been used for anything recently any traces were long gone. The only thing they found was some leftover junk from what must have been squatters; explaining the heavy looks on the door, maybe.
“A joke Sherlock, it was a joke.”  Sherlock just did that tiny shake with his head, flinging the dark curls back.
Sherlock seemed to be reading his fortune in the tea leaves in the bottom of his cup. When the silence became unbearable John put down his paper and got up thinking he should go to bed.
“No,” he said calmly, refusing to look at John. How could he not see that this was his fault, he should have seen this coming. If he had been better, faster, stronger then John would not have been taken in the first place. He had let his feelings cloud his perception.
“I swear the attitude of young people now days,” Mrs Hudson shouted after him. It made John stop in his track. What would he do without her; he really should try to be more considerate.
“The writing is smudged in a way that only left hand writers do, the shape of the vowels indicates a man who received his schooling in the 60’s. The victims have both been cut on the right side of their necks, the angle of the cut indicates that the assailant stood in front of the victim, however, there is no sign of struggle, suggesting that he drugged his victims elsewhere before killing them here.”
“Sherlock!” John pleaded. Wings twitched and finally he stopped, slinking back to John's side and flopping to the floor with a huff.
“Sherlock I don't really have time for this,” a deep aristocratic voice sighed. Sherlock snarled at the man, wings flaring slightly in challenge. John glanced up and was surprised that Mycroft looked completely human. He didn't carry wings on his back like Sherlock and no horns were nestled in his hair. He was like a serpent, a roiling predator hidden and ready to strike. To John's amusement he did have a bit of a belly and in his slightly delirious state he laughed a little. Mycroft looked very annoyed, glaring down at the doctor. Sherlock chuckled behind him, hands still smoothing cold water over the cuts and cleaning them.
“No...no,” he stuttered, looking up at the dragon's sad eyes. “I was...enjoying it.” Sherlock smiled, slinking forward until John was caged in his arms, pressing a slow kiss to the doctor's lips. John moaned in to the kiss, tangling his fingers in dark curls, but Sherlock pulled away, pecking him on the nose gently.
“Okay I think that's enough time in the cold water,” Sherlock grumbled, climbing up the bank and helping John up. The cold water had numbed his back completely so Sherlock was able to scoop him up and carry him up in to the cave. He sat him next to the fire, digging through packs until he found a change of clothes and a small towel and tossed them over near John.
“I think you two will make a fine pair,” he finally said, stopping in front of them. “Dragon form please!” he demanded,taking a step back and placing a hand on his own dragon's shoulder. Sherlock grumbled, getting to his feet and unfurling his wings to full width.
"We're very drunk men," John murmurs, feeling his words slurring together slightly as though they're trying to make his point for him.
Sherlock tips his head back to examine the sky and the world pitches forward, the clouds dematerialize, velvety darkness falls over everything like tired eyelids slipping closed.
He breathes out, a soft huff that's nearly a laugh but not quite, and reaches his left hand up to rub at the back of his neck.
John sets to work, neatly slicing off two slices of dense white bread. He can hear Sherlock humming, of all things, from over in his corner. It's a happy song, whatever it is. Apparently he is pleased about this turn of events.
A bark of laughter.  John drops the rock he has just picked up and straightens, squinting one eye at Sherlock, really smiling now.  “You sound like on the BBC.  The marine life live in waves, anyhow.  Aren’t they used to being tossed about?”
The words feel sour in his mind as he reads and rereads them.  He can almost feel the twenty-pound note through the leather, weighing heavily in his hand.  It’s charity, he’s sure of it, and he doesn’t know why he feels so utterly blind-sided by it.
John rolls his eyes.  “Sod my leg,” he mutters, but he goes over to the chair, swats a few times at the (absurd, out-of-place) Union Jack cushion that rests on it, and drops himself down with some relief.  “Milk, no sugar,” he says, off-handedly.
If only he could have the dress.  The dress had been right.  Maybe if he is very clever and very careful he can get another look at it somehow.
Sherlock scowls and tears after him, catching him up.  “I am not dreaming about eating.  I don’t eat here.  It’s a waste of time.  Go and have lunch in your own subconscious!”
John glances over his shoulder at him, smiles half a smile, and turns back to the ocean.  “You’re in
Mycroft is big, though, and heavy.  He’s got seven years on Sherlock.  Seven is a hateful number.  Sherlock is six.  He isn’t able to put up much fight once Mycroft grabs his arm and drags him away from the window.  He plants his feet, he jerks his arm to try and free it.
“Right,” he says, gesturing with the wallet before tucking it away in the back pocket of his trousers. “Thanks for this back, anyway.  Lovely playing today, as usual, but I, uh, should probably be on my way.”
out."  She shoves him, and there's nothing playful in it this time.  He puts his arm up in an attempt to keep her from putting her hands on him again.  "Were you ever planning to tell me that, then, or were you just gonna wait until you gave me a bloody disease?"
wrapped up in a spare uniform shirt to school one day and elephantine Nathan Thatcher crunched it up under his untied oxfords and called him a freak, shoved him hard until he overbalanced and fell with a whump into the schoolyard dirt.
Sherlock has never been invited to join in.  Why? Because he is different.  He is odd.  He says wrong things and stumbles over his letters and looks into people’s eyes too fiercely or doesn’t look into them at all.  He ferried the bleached skeleton of a
“No, John, I--” He tugs at his curls with a fist, agitated. “John, they are awful. They're gaudy, and, and gauche and I should abhor them. But I don't. I don't abhor them and I keep watching this ridiculous truck every single day and it is driving me
Sherlock drops his voice even lower.  "And even if we were," he says firmly.  He slides his own hand over to rest it on John's thigh, nuzzles the side of John's head, kisses his cheek with a soft brush of his lips.
“Surely John, the need has passed,” Sherlock waved his arm in the air, not looking up, the finger on his other hand casually trailing the rim of his mug, tip coming away wet from condensation, “We are both alive and well and it seems we will be so for the foreseeable future,” Sherlock’s eyes briefly met his, begging him to leave it be.
She doesn't tell him he's just been hiding, really, that he's always been there underneath, exactly as he is.  Same as she's been hiding herself away in liter bottles of Everyday Value vodka all these years.
“How did you know I was a soldier?” John measures his words.  Slow now, easy, he tells himself.  This is his first honest-to-God conversation with another person in months and months.
It's funny, she thinks, how to her eye he still looks about seven years old, the lines and acne scars and beard shadow barely even registering.  There are flecks of runny egg yolk dotting his chin, and he's got toast crumbs absolutely everywhere, and he's forty-three years old and she's got an inexplicable, vestigial urge to clean him up.
The step is easy to take, he finds. He turns back to the corner with the sandwich in hand, and walks towards Sherlock. He takes care to be gentle in his movements, as though it were a flighty horse he were approaching, not a tipsy and confused man. He offers up the sandwich.
, to call it 'hash.'” His voice cracks and his blue eyes have gone positively manic. “Hash! That is not a hash. I
Is there anything left in the house? Or will he need to start asking Dad to pick things up from the shops?
John can't help giggling a bit at that. “I suppose you could say that. I'm the chap who makes the grilled cheeses. Does that make me a 'Cheesy Chap?'”
Sherlock stares at him, thinking hard, piecing together a puzzle made from tatty jumpers and black eyes and loneliness.
“I didn’t try.  I gave you money.  And you spent it like I asked; you’ve got some color back in your face today.”  He looks so pleased, cat-that-got-the-canary all over again, and John’s left hand shakes.  He wants to hit him.
John realizes his hands are shaking and he forces himself to draw in a few deep breaths.  He’s not sure what he’s feeling, but there is an unpleasant pull in his gut and a lump caught just below his Adam’s apple.  Air, he thinks.  He should get some air.
There is a pause, a beat of silence, and then John feels a smile etch itself into his face and a bark of unexpected laughter escapes him.  It jars his system, wakes up the under-used creases near his mouth, pulls at muscles in his belly that have been long neglected.
"Right, well.  Yeah.  I have sex with other men... fairly often.  Does that count for interesting?" He smiles through it, keeps his voice light, like it's not the heaviest thing in his life.
“No, no, no. You work in it, and it is called 'The Cheesy Chap.' It's...” A pause, as though heis thinking over his next words. “It's absurd, John. Preposss. Preposterous. 'The Cheesy Chap.' What does that even mean? Are
“I tried to discover, in the rumor of forests and waves, words that other men could not hear, and I pricked up my ears to listen to the revelation of their harmony.”
He slides to a halt a few feet from where the boy is standing staring at the ground and looks him up and down with frantic eyes.  The boy stands like the others at the primary school, square-legged, ever ready to punt a football or piss on something.  Dull boy, common boy.   Sherlock fists his hands into the scratchy wool of his trousers, his body practically vibrating with upset.
He wants to reply.  He wants to ask how the man can possibly know any of that.  He wants to tell him to piss off.  He wants to tell him that he is
Sherlock looks aghast at him. “Absurd, John. And grilled cheese is horrid. Greasy, indelicate...” He trails off. He lifts his face and meets John's eyes.
There had been no options to consider.  There is only this, the quiet drip of blood on the pavement as he stands in front of Sherlock Holmes’ door in the dark.
“Right,” he says, hesitantly reaching out his left hand and clapping Sherlock gently on the shoulder.  “I’ll see you soon, yeah?”
He watches John’s head dart around, searching, and sees the grin split his face when he sees Sherlock waiting for him.  Sherlock watches him stride over on short legs, his bag over his shoulder.  John’s brow is crinkled, as if he is confused, but he is smiling brightly nonetheless.
The window is painted shut, she'd explained earlier, apologetic, so the room is muggy and stuffy and smells like there's mould lurking behind the plaster.
“Ah, listen,” John starts finally.  Sherlock looks at him with a curious expression.  “I just wanted to… apologize.  For losing my temper, earlier.”
Sherlock is kneeling by his violin case, examining his bow.  At the sound of John lurching towards him, he looks up, bright-eyed and with a smile playing at his lips.
The man smiles along with him.  He pulls out his mobile and wakes up the screen, the luminescence of it reflecting faintly across his face.  He speaks again without looking up.  “I would check your wallet again, though.  One never can be too careful with street performer types.”
He hates the relief that washes over him when he sees the hall light flip on through the crack under the door.
This particular dress, yes.  But Mycroft can’t be expected to understand that.  Sherlock’s brand of logic eludes him.
John wrenches the cork out of a bottle of ginger beer and takes a swallow from it.  “What should we do after lunch, then?”
The second day goes very much like the first.  He runs out of biscuits and eats nothing instead.  His stomach protests.  He ignores it.  He stays up all night.
He wants a shag badly.  He's aroused down to the very tips of his fingers, even though he literally couldn't get hard right now to save his life, not after the six (seven? Heavy pours, in any case) vodka-Red Bulls, but he
The boy frees one of his hands from his pocket and offers it to him, steady even despite the wind and the chill spray clinging to the light, fuzzy hairs of his arm.  “John.”
"Lunch with your sister today, isn't it?" He cups his palm around the base of John's head and strokes a thumb over the edge of his ear.
John takes it from him and cracks the lid easily, handing it back to him without comment.  He tears open one of the packets of butcher’s paper and crams a thick slice of ham into the split of a roll.  When he speaks again, it’s through a full mouth.  “Wonder who Martha is.”
“Oh, lighten up, Mummy.”  Sherrinford smiles at Sherlock, kind eyes, crew cut, neat auburn beard.  “I’m sure he’s just had enough of our dull talk for one evening.  Dismissed, Private!” He gives an exaggerated salute in Sherlock’s direction, then turns back to his dinner.
Sherlock freezes and stares at Mycroft’s reddened face.  He huffs in breaths.  He hadn’t realized he’d been making any noise at all.  The dress is gone, and he feels all wrong inside.
“John!” he says, sounding out of breath.  “Come in, come right in.”  He is draped in an expensive-looking blue dressing gown over a neatly-pressed shirt and pair of trousers.  John notices with some amusement that his feet are bare.
John blinks his eyes open and sees the blurry form of the busker looming over him. His reactions feel laggard and he is still exhausted. The sandy crust that has formed at the inside corners of his eyes pulls at his skin uncomfortably.
A moment later, John feels him shift and very nearly press a kiss into his cheek, and he feels shot through with nerves like he's had ice water sluiced over his head.  It's hateful, it's truly awful, the fear is, because the beautiful energy between them is even stronger now with Sherlock's face so close to his, breath warm and sugary with energy drink and sweet chili sauce and right against his ear.
He is outside the Baker Street flat, and he is so fucking embarrassed he could scream.  He did shout, earlier, or at least had tried until he had gagged on the blood running down the back of his throat and had needed to lean over, coughing up red on the ground.  He had kicked over the nearest garbage can, and cursed and coughed and yelled himself hoarse, only stopping when the wail of a police siren in the distance startled him into silence.
.  Just beneath, John's shirt collar (new shirt, interesting) is turned in, and the urge to reach out and fix it, smooth his hand over the warm skin and stubble just above it, is stronger than he can control.
Angelo seems not to hear him.  “I’ll get a candle for the table, s’more romantic,” he says, winking hugely at them and clapping a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder before walking away.  John is left feeling a bit shell-shocked.
Instead, John clenches his fingers tight around the handle of his cane, gives Sherlock a curt nod, turns around, walks away.
“Oh, OK! Yeah.” John smacks the flat of his palm on the counter. Sherlock jumps at the noise. “Keep insulting the food. Great way to get someone to cook for you. I'm calling you a cab.”
Something finally clicks, and he stares at the other man.  He doesn’t intend for his voice to come out as faintly as it does.  “What are you playing at?”
John can feel it, physically, the energy pouring out of him and into Sherlock and out of Sherlock and back into him, like a closed circuit, electricity endlessly cycling through them both.  Stunning.  He's so
“I wanted to ask you to have a meal with me yesterday, but as I stated then, I had a prior engagement that was unavoidable.  Since I wasn’t able to invite you to eat with me, I determined to at least leave you the funds I was going to spend anyway.  You looked quite ill.  No, don’t argue--” he says, holding a hand up flat to silence John’s interjection.  “You did.  You looked positively gaunt.  You have since you started coming to see me play three months ago and it’s only gotten worse with time.”
“Oh god,” he says, his voice low, hoarse with distress.  He sweeps the hand back through his curly mess of hair.  His eyes are resolutely avoiding John’s now, darting around the ceiling of the station. “That’s how I’ve come across to you.”
John curses and walks to the door, opening it gently to avoid striking his would-be intruder with it. Sherlock steps back and sways on the spot, huffing with annoyance and staring at the sky.
When the desire to hit something finally leaves him some time later that evening, all he’s left with is a bleak empty feeling just below his ribcage and a loneliness he just isn’t able to shake.
“This is my dream, too,” John says.  His hand moves slowly into Sherlock’s frame of vision, reaches out and presses at the skin around Sherlock’s own left eye.
On the first day, he goes to bed at dawn and sleeps until the afternoon.  He glides around the flat in his pyjama bottoms and dressing gown.  He plays the violin as loudly as he pleases.  He eschews real food and has several pots of tea and an entire box of Hob Nobs instead.  He dissects a thumb from the refrigerator.  He stays up all night again.  It is lovely.
Sherlock waved at him to be silent. There was no need to emphasise the seriousness of the situation. John felt it in every bone in his body and in the cold weight of the gun at his back.
But John would not, not again, not this time. A frantic anxiety filled him, a feeling of it soon being too late. He knew that this was it; if he did not act now then it would always, forever be too late. The moment would have passed by, lost to them.
“Well I gathered that by your presence, but no. Just turn around and go home,” Sherlock the tramp shook his head.
He let his gaze drift over the crowd milling about. The place was huge; six dance floors the girl in the wardrobe with spiky blue hair had told them. That was apparently very impressive as far as these things went. None of the other places they had visited that night was even close to this size; this place felt like a world in itself. In this dark place other laws rules and in the safety of the crowd people threw away their inhibitions and lost themselves to the night.
He continued, trying his best not to stare at the people in various states of undress standing about. On one occasion he was sure he spotted the man ahead of him, dark polo shirt just disappearing behind a corner but when he ran up, he couldn’t see anyone. It was starting to freak him out and suddenly it struck him that perhaps he was being toyed with. Was the murderer leading him on in this dark maze, did he know he was being followed? In this place no one would hear him scream.
After he had returned from Afghanistan he seemed to have gone underground, there was no information about him from the last two years. The three dead, Sherlock told him, had been responsible in one way or another for his positioning with John and subsequent dismissal. Apparently Peter had at one point messed up, losing or selling on some cargo he had been transporting. The first man, Barry, had reported on him and that had stopped him working on the smuggling line of the organisation.
The woman had recommended discharge with immediate effect as he returned to England without any results to show for his time in Afghanistan. Sherlock told him all this as he pointed at documents and pictures spread out on the table in front of them. Normally he never bothered to explain everything but this time he seemed to want John to understand it all.
Hands trailed up his sides, one stopping at his waist doing circles over his shirt and the other came up to his chin, forcing his head slightly to the side, long fingers on his cheek and in his hair, sending shivers through his body. John’s hands travelled up a naked back, over scars he by now knew by sight but hadn’t touched, not like this. Sherlock’s skin was warm and dry and he could feel the muscles underneath.
The rhythm slowly increased, each stroke just a tiny bit harder and faster than the previous one. Unable to control himself John pushed his hips forward into Sherlock’s touch. Sherlock left hand gently painted circles over his stomach under his shirt, playing over his hipbones and further back towards the small of his back before coming back to his stomach.
In a sense he was doing the same thing that he had been doing in the army, walking behind the devastation patching people up that got hurt in the storm. There it had been physical wounds, here they were mostly mental, witnesses frightened or people intimidated by Sherlock. Now John was at the centre of the storm, who would put him back together?
“You sure you want another one mate?” The landlord asked, looking suspiciously at John’s slumped figure and creased sweater.
Sherlock is still there when John wakes up an hour later, snuggled in close behind him sleeping silently, pale chest rising and pressing against John’s back. John feels tired and soft, skin sensitive like it is glowing. Sherlock’s arm is draped over his chest and John lets his own hand close over his, treading their fingers together. Sherlock stirs and mumbles something which sounds very much like ‘John’, breath hot on his neck but does not wake fully. An elated, warm felling fills John and he smiles wide and thinks that maybe he will get to keep his present.
Afterwards they lay still on the bed in a tangle of cooling limbs, with a blanked John had pulled over them; bodies sated and minds at rest. John traced a finger slowly down Sherlock’s chest; he followed all the little lines telling of great adventures and dire dangers. He could not help but to feel some trepidation, where would this take them? Could they handle it? For all his bold statements he feared that this would not be easy, but then things worth something seldom were.
“Justice Doctor,” Again the same ugly twist at the word doctor, “Justice for all the wrongs done to me.”
Sherlock stopped for second on the huge white stairs of the Scotland Yard, “I couldn’t risk you giving the ploy away my dear friend.”
“I remember him, he was discharged,” John wasn’t sure it was actually him that was talking; it seemed to him that right now two worlds existed at the same time and him somewhere in between.
Sherlock continued his deductions, his mind ablaze as he connected the pieces of the puzzle, each revealing itself slowly before him, “The victim might have been killed here but was most likely picked up somewhere else; you see that stain on the left trouser leg?” John bent down, glowed fingers pointing at it, not touching, as Sherlock waved towards it.
It only lasts for a tent of a second and then his mind returns to him and he realises that this, right here is not in any way ok.
“Not everyone has the sort of control over their bodies as you Sherlock.” Watson answered with just a tiny bit of cynicism in his voice.
At that time the secret service had started to take serious note of the organisation and had done several attempts over the years to pin them to some of the many illegal activities they were involved in, so far without success.
He shakes his head and is momentarily angered by the Holmes family and the games they always play, how had Mycroft known Sherlock would give him the package and not set it on fire if that was indeed his normal procedure. He turns the note over and realizes it has writing on the back as well,
He leaned over Sherlock’s face trying to pretend that he felt the weak breeze of his breath, but Sherlock was still as death itself. He filled his lungs and blew air into Sherlock’s. He did it again and again, blowing, breathing, blowing, breathing and endless circle making his head spin.
“What, I thought you said I had the making of a great undercover detective,” John teased. Sherlock continued down the stairs, careful in his steps as he tried not to irritate his broken ribs. He waved his hand out for a cab and as the car pulled in to the curb he said, “Bah, you are to honest for your own good John,” A fond smile took away any edge there might have been to it. They entered the cab and made for home.
The morgue was brightly lit. The fluorescent light from the ceiling drenched the sterile environment with its unforgiving intensity, emphasising the sharp edges between the white tiles and chromed fixtures.
They manage to get down to their underwear as the back of John’s legs hit the bed. He stops for a second, his hands coming up and holding Sherlock’s face in place and he just looks at him.
Two hours later he had produced all of one sentence, it looked pitifully alone and deserted on the blank screen. He leaned back in his chair reflecting on how easy life had been in the army, just duck if people were shooting at you and follow orders.
He stares at the ceiling and wonders if perhaps he should have accepted his sister’s invitation and gone to spend Christmas with her. He turns it over for a second thinking how it would all play out and then he sighs; Christmas with Harry is not something he wants to put himself through. He loves his sister, of course; he just prefers to not spend too much time with her.
He started to slowly back away, calm in a detached sort of way. The lighting was low and his mind, playing tricks on him registered threats everywhere. Flickering shadows as vicious shapes out to get him, to slice and dice at him until there was nothing left. He focused on the pounding from the music. A steady background noise, loud enough to make the walls shake slightly. The beat, in sync with his heart gave him focus.
“I want you inside of me,” John said and it came out hoarse and needy, “Now, I need you inside of me now.”
“Yes, I was out here getting my mail when he ran down the stairs like he had the dark one on his trail ordering a car as he ran,” the old lady shook her grey curls at that. In her book, order and courteousness was the way to approach life.
“Where did you get those clothes, not to mention a wig?” John was stalling but he needed time to think, some seconds to try and process what had just happened. However, trying to outthink Sherlock was like trying to stop a tsunami with a piece of string and a paper clip.
It was strange in a way, how protective he felt about the doctor. Normally people in Sherlock’s presence didn’t last long; they burned out fast in his company leaving him behind as they moved on. People tried to keep up with him and when they couldn’t they left. It was just safer to not get involved with people in Sherlock’s experience. Not John though, John had this steady, calm force about him and it whispered to you that he would always be there, never leave you.
Sherlock holds him still and laces his long arms around John’s waist and John thinks about pushing him away with brute force but he figures it is quite possible he would lose a wrestling match with Sherlock. He stops trying to get away and prepares to die of shame instead.
They exited the club and John followed Sherlock up to a, quite clear to anyone, undercover police vehicle. As they closed in on it the rear doors slid open and Lestrade came out to meet them.
He started to walk towards the correct address, trying to look like he belonged in the place, something he doubted he was succeeding with. He blamed his comfortable English, middle class upbringing for that.
It was all gingerly and careful, John had to constantly remind himself that Sherlock had six broken ribs and was not at all as ok as he claimed. So he let Sherlock push him down on the carpet and lie cautiously down atop of him, knees pushing John’s legs apart. Sherlock’s eyes were burning black pools and John suddenly had trouble breathing.
“I haven’t seen him today though,” He finally admitted when Lestrade seemed to wait for something more.
John turns his eyes to the tiled floor and forces himself to draw a tight breath.  He is not ready for this right now.  There is a tug in his chest that tells him he ought to retreat and spare himself the possibility of fucking up this conversation, driving a wedge between himself and the busker.  He doesn’t want to ruin this.  He wants to keep hearing the music every day.
The circle of the boy’s left eye is blackened, smudged a dark, purpling grey like the stratus clouds slung low over their heads.  Sherlock feels an unsettling in his belly.  He hadn’t guessed this, but he ought to have.  There are rules.  There are patterns.  He can read them like he reads the heavy, yellowed texts he drags home from the library each week.  Causations, correlations.  Even here, by the rock pools, things have an order.  There is logic for him to follow.  He refits his deductions.
“Sorry?” The boy’s head remains bowed.  Sherlock tracks his gaze down to the rocks and finds he’s watching a green shore crab scuttle by near their feet.
"Honestly? You've been elbows-deep in human entrails before, you nancy," she says, pointedly licking a gob of sauce from her thumb.
Sherlock hugs him.  The tea probably spills again; he doesn’t care.  John starts, and then hugs him back with his free arm, squeezing tight around his back and burying his face against Sherlock’s coat.  Perfect, Sherlock thinks, this is perfect, perfect, perfect.  He tucks his head into the crook of John’s neck and breathes deep.
John frowns. He limps a few paces back towards the man and answers before he realizes quite what he's doing.
He can feel the eyes on the back of his neck, but when they reach the exit, all he hears is a cheery "Night, gents," from the young man behind the counter.
There’s a nudge against his shoulder and he blinks at John, who is looking at him with a raised eyebrow and a close-mouthed smile.  “There you are.”  He shoves a pair of biscuits sandwiched around jam into Sherlock’s fingers.  “Go on and eat, genius.”
The phone disappears back into his coat pocket and his eyes meet John’s again.  The man’s eye contact is all or nothing; he is either glancing around at everyone and everything that is not John, or looking directly into his soul.  He winks, of all things, and ducks down to pick up the violin case.
The next week feels like limbo.  He texts John and John texts him back.  Mrs. Hudson brings him food and dotes on him far more than is usual.  He stops screeching his violin and he runs out of thumbs.  He takes to staring out the front window.  It is patently ridiculous, but he is watching for John.  Just in case.
John laughs.  Sherlock thinks he is laughing with him and not at him; John doesn’t laugh at him, normally.  “Sherlock, it’s thoughtful.  Really.  Cheers.”  He takes the cup from him and inhales the steam coming up through the hole in the lid.  “I didn’t expect to see you here.  Greeting people at the security gate seems a bit not your thing.”
“It’s no bother.” John waves his hand dismissively and starts hauling himself up the staircase, leaning heavily on his cane.  Sherlock pads up after him.
“Learn to control yourself, Sherlock.  You must.”  Mycroft’s eyes are red and wet, at the corners, past where rainwater might have settled.  “You must.”
John watches him sweep into the station, long black coat fluttering behind him like a cape. He always puts John in mind of Batman, or Zorro, or some other outlandish fictional character. He seems larger-than-life. The man sets his violin case on the station floor, then pulls off his coat and folds it neatly. He then takes out the violin and begins plucking at the strings with long fingers, testing and tuning. The instrument looks comically small in the grasp of his broad hands.  The case is left open at his feet, inviting tips from the passerby.
Sherlock unfolds himself from the floor and gathers up the dish from the desk, settles back into the corner with it.  He spoons down his serving of pudding from supper and feels warm inside.
“Apologize, you don’t need to apologize,” Sherlock murmurs, browsing over the menu again and avoiding John’s eyes.  “I made you unintentionally very uncomfortable.  Your reaction was perfectly understandable.”
John is cut adrift, leaning on his cane in the middle of the floor.  The smile that had lingered throughout his conversation with the busker slips gradually from his face.  He chews at the inside of his cheek, glances to his left and right and sees that the world has somehow kept turning.  People are cutting around him in wide swathes as they pass.  Nobody else seems to have noticed the coming and going of the remarkable man with the violin.
A vague burning smell breaks the moment and startles John back into awareness. He hastily pulls the slightly charred sandwich from the heat and takes a moment to neatly wrap it in wax paper. He takes a shaky breath. He wonders why he feels shaky. Why does this matter so much? Why does this feel so much like jumping off of something very high?
His brain is so thoroughly shagged out, so full of endorphins softening the edges of everything, that he barely thinks about the words that come flying out of him like the ills out of Pandora's box.
It’s impossible, John thinks.  This man is impossible, this entire conversation is impossible.  How do you tell someone that their mere presence lights up the dark places inside your head that you thought were dead and rotting?  There aren’t words for that sort of thing, and if there are, John doesn’t know them.
“I hit back too hard.”  John starts picking his way down the pebbled beach away from Sherlock, towards the rock pools.  “Come on.  Someone’s made a lunch for us.”
John tried to see where Sherlock was pointing at the same time as he attempted to make apologetic gestures to the people they pushed out of their way as Sherlock forced a path through the horde of revellers. He finally turned around as he managed to free himself from Sherlock and careful not slip on the wet floor looked where Sherlock pointed.
Yet all the time he was still dead; leaving John behind. Alone again. The world should have stopped and mourned, torn its hair and cried salted tears that scourged the earth.
Here Mycroft sat down and the word was back to Lestrade, who with the help of Sherlock, moved on to the bodies. The brothers may look very different John thought but right now you could see that they were related. They both enjoyed this complicated dance of the mind, the breaking down of information and reassembling it again into coherent shapes.
It is only then that he realizes that there is not one but two hard-ons pressed up between them and he suddenly takes in Sherlock’s flushed face and dark eyes, pupils blown and huge.
The downpour softened the edges, making everything seem lit with grey light from within, yet it was all intensely familiar. With it came that old feeling that life had never been more right than when he had lived here, and now it was all out of order. Everything from his job to his white apartment, it was not his life he was living. Something was inherently wrong.
What he was about to say was interrupted as the back door flung open, slamming against the wall and letting in a gust of chilly December air mixed with rain and a veritable army of black clad people filling the narrow room to its breaking point. They walked over and around the pair, still half sitting on the floor, skilfully ignoring them.
John hit him in the side again and Peter let go of the shotgun and started to hit back, it wasn’t pretty but bloody and messy, the two men rolling on the floor throwing punches wherever they could reach.
Stupid, so stupid, he thinks as he mentally berates himself. Eventually he has to put the cup down, hands shaking slightly as he does.
“So how is Sherlock doing in all this?” Lestrade said as he finished the last pieces of his Shepherd’s pie.
The memories of a similar situation weeks ago, of Sherlock’s body pressed against his, mouth meeting his came back, flooding his mind in vivid flashes.
“Sherlock this time you have gone too far,” Lestrade started, “The threats and now this, it seems clear that they are connected.”
He took a deep breath; he had known he needed to tell this story eventually; he just whished that it would be a million years into the distant future when the sun had turned into a brilliant giant on the brink of consuming the earth.
degree but John would live. He tried not to sigh in relief and instead ripped the rest of the pants leg open, cutting it off above the wound. He found burn ointment next to a bottle of pain medication and handed both over to John along with some clean bandages. “Will you be all right? The dragon asked, getting to his feet and stretching his wings.
The sun dropped below the horizon as they swung in to their saddles, John adjusting his splint in to the makeshift rig and nodding at Sherlock's questioning look. They stayed on the ground as they approached, the dragons slinking like snakes through the trees.
“I'm sorry John,” he said softly against his ear. “I'm sorry you ended up with me and that I don't make things easy.” He squeezed John a little tighter, lips grazing his earlobe. He let out a breath like he was going to say something more but pulled away, leaving John's hair prickling with static. He shifted in to his natural form, shaking his wings out and John noticed the scorch marks around his shoulders and across his wings.
John was flush and about to let the dragon do whatever he wanted when Sherlock suddenly stopped, head cocking. He glanced up toward the sky, then leapt to his feet, dragging John with him and towards the tree line. The doctor grunted as he was shoved up against a tree, Sherlock pressing up against him and surrounding them with his wings. “Sher...” he started and the dragon pressed a hand over his mouth, eyes still focused upward. John quieted, wrapping his arms around the dragon's waist and following his gaze up. A shadow flickered through the canopy and the dragon pulled him closer, tucking John's head under his chin after releasing his hold over his mouth. John saw the shadow a few more times, slowly moving away from them. They stayed like that for at least another half hour after John had seen the last shadow and he'd started to drift off against Sherlock's chest when the dragon nudged him gently.
“I don't like this,” Sherlock said immediately, putting his hands on his hips. John flushed, scrambling for Sherlock's jumpsuit and trying to hand it to the dragon who knocked it away. “We know nothing about what we're picking up. He's sending us by ourselves. This is dangerous and a death trap.”
“What is that thing doing in my house?!” she demanded, pointing accusingly at Sherlock who smacked his tail against the floor in agitation.
“I'll be okay,” John promised, meeting Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock dropped his hand to John's shoulder, pressed his lips to John's forehead a moment then stepped away, sliding into his dragon form before John had fully realized what had happened. Sherlock stood at the cave entrance waiting patiently for John to put the harnesses on, securing bags and saddle, his cheeks flushed pink. As John climbed up Sherlock swatted their fire out with a smack of his tail and headed out into the night. Once the soldier was situated Sherlock was in the air, enjoying the crisp breeze, wings stretching and pulling rhythmically. John sat comfortably, holding the handle in front of him as they climbed higher. They broke through the clouds and the stars shimmered overhead, giving just enough light to gleam off of Sherlock's dark scales. John ran a hand over the scales absentmindedly and felt the vibration of a pleased purr underneath him. He smiled softly and settled in for a long haul.
He slipped through the doors by himself, Sherlock unable to fit and started looking around for a release switch for the glass cover. Growing frustrated he grabbed the microscope off the counter nearby and heaved it above his head, bringing it crashing in to the cover. Glass shattered all around him but surprisingly no alarm went off. As the fog cleared John realized it was an egg and heard Sherlock let out a shrieking moan that had the hair on his arms standing up. John snatched the egg, hurrying back towards the dragon who looked very upset. He was shifting and agitated, eyes glancing around rapidly.
“I've got a mission for you two,” he explained softly. “A private mission.” Sherlock and John glanced at each other and crowded in closer. “It will be just the two of you. There's a package pickup, two days flight from here. I'll provide you with a map to the pickup location. This is confidential boys, no one but us knows about this.” John nodded firmly and Sherlock narrowed his eyes slightly. “Pack your overnight bag, you're heading out in the morning.” He got up and disappeared into the crowd as quickly as he'd appeared. John hurriedly ate the rest of his meal, noticing that Sherlock hadn't eaten any more of his and was looking rather put out.
“Uh Sherlock,” John coughed, eyes big and slightly worried. The dragon pulled back, his arousal evident through the thin shorts and shook himself slightly.
“They were not John,” Sherlock snapped, teeth bared in a snarl. “He took me out of that wretched place you put me in.”
“Thank you again,” John said quietly, trying to break the awkward silence. “For protecting me, for letting me ride, for everything.” Sherlock smacked John upside the head with a wing playfully, nuzzling into John's hair and snorting as the hairs tickled him.
“I don't believe it is up to you what dragons are fit for the british army,” John snapped, posture straightening. “Now I asked you a question.”
“Won't let anyone touch him,” John sighed, glancing up at Sherlock who snorted in derision. “But he's passed all his tests with flying colors.”
“That's what I want to talk to you about, but it will wait a moment,” Sherlock snapped, rubbing the towel through John's hair and over his face. “Dry,” he told John firmly, handing him the towel and going back to their pack. He found John's med kit and brought it back with him, settling on the ground behind the doctor. John took the water and pain meds Sherlock handed him without another word, going back to his job of drying off. Mycroft settled himself on a rock with a huff, eyeing the egg with curiosity. Once he'd settled the human back between his legs and had ointment in hand he finally looked up at Mycroft.
“Fucking dragons,” he grumbled. He switched out stones for the egg, put the last of the meat in to their basket and resolved to gather more vines today. He knew the dragon wanted him to come join him, so he resolved to get revenge and leave him shivering in the water for as long as possible.
“You are one tough son of a bitch Watson,” Bowen complimented, reaching out and squeezing John's shoulder in what was meant to be a show of awe and instead had John gasping in pain and Sherlock snarling at the commanding officer. The dragon was wrapped around John protectively, wings curving around the man and glaring at Bowen fiercely enough to make the general step back. Mike tutted John gently about not telling him about the other injury and sent Molly to get fresh water as Sherlock slowly relaxed his hold and helped John pull the shirt over his head.
When he finally left the cave, he headed immediately in to the trees, not even looking toward the river, to go relieve himself. He took his time and was zipping up his fly when he heard the crunch of a stick behind him. “I suppose you're quite irate with me, serves you right,” John taunted with a smirk, turning and immediately going pale. A dark green dragon was standing there, eyes narrowed and wings slightly raised. His chest and neck were glowing gently like he was ready to attack at any second. “Easy,” John said softly, putting his hands up. He heard Sherlock roar from the river and when the dragon turned it's head he took off in the opposite direction, shoving through vines and brambles and feeling thorns cutting at his arms and legs. “Fuck,” he hissed when one caught him under the eye. He cried out when he was struck from behind, a hundred slices like papercuts through his clothes. He hit the ground hard and curled in to a ball, choking back a sob. The green dragon came up on him, nosing him as if to make sure he was still alive. John groaned, his wounds bleeding sluggishly, then heard the crashing of something else coming towards him.
“We can talk to Bowen, try to figure out what's happening?” John suggested softly and Sherlock bared his teeth in a snarl.
“Zane wants this done as soon as possible!” one of them exclaimed and John could see a syringe in his hand. “He wants it ready for the siege in a couple months.”
“John I am a dragon,” Sherlock huffed. “I can go a very long time without sleep.” John chuckled and settled in to a companionable silence with the dragon leaning against him. They spent the rest of the daylight hours like that, only getting up to make a small meal and relieve themselves. When it was getting close to dark Sherlock went to wake the general and Lestrade as John started gathering their things and putting only the necessary things in their packs. The rest he sat against the base of a nearby tree to hide under some branches. He wanted Sherlock to be as unburdened as possible for this mission, especially since there wouldn't be much room inside the compound anyways. The dragon sidled back up next to him, rubbing against him like a cat and allowing the doctor to put his harness back on.
I finally finished another story I was working on so this is next on the list to finish up. So I'm back on this full time (well, it's my main focus, I do still have to work)
“I really don't think this will all be necessary,” John argued as the men were suiting up. A large crate was rolled up to an opening of the cage and latched securely in place.
“Uh...of course!” John stammered, turning and fixing another plate. “I'll see about finding you something to wear too!” Sherlock had sat himself down at the table when John turned around again, thanking him as he sat the plate down in front of him. When John finally sat down with his own plate of food Sherlock looked at him carefully.
Sherlock scanned the sky, pupils blown wide with adrenaline and lightning crackled over his skin angrily. How dare anyone attack him? They would pay very dearly. He turned in time to see the black streak hurtling towards him and just barely dodged out of the way, shooting an attack after the dragon. The lightning blast struck the other dragon in the wing, knocking him off course and sending him spinning. Sherlock tore after the dragon who was trying to correct his flight, flapping weakly with his injured wing. Sherlock rocketed towards his enemy and slammed into him at full force, taking the dragon down into the jungle. They slammed into the forest floor, Sherlock pressing a clawed paw over the other dragon's throat. A snarl ripped from his throat and the other dragon started to chuckle in a rasping tone.
“We were out on patrol, just a normal round; looking at one of these road building projects. One of those things that seemed to work fine without us. The Afghani built roads; found something that the community needed and they made it happen. Women carried rocks side by side with men. It was like one of those dream projects you tell your superiors about, and they tell the media for publicity.”
“Now that’s taken care of let’s get down to business.” He turned away, like nothing out of the ordinary had happened and went right back to his pacing. For him probably nothing strange had happened. John stood dumbfounded for a second before pure survival instinct kicked in and he wiped himself and did the best he could with his rumpled clothing.
Lestrade nodded, he could see that this wouldn’t lead anywhere. Not to say that he would stop trying to bully John into a safe house, just that he would put it off to a later date.
“Ok,” He says very inarticulate, “I’m glad I mean,” He adds after he realizes that he is probably making a fool of himself yet again.
Sherlock turns to look out the window, hands shaping a pyramid in front of him; he shrugs lightly and says casually, “You can have it.”
“I know,” was all John replied. He gave the photo back and pushed the food away, the smell now nauseated him and the ache in his head was back in full force.
He turned back to Lestrade and continued, “Even an absolute moron would realize that putting John into custody is what we would do. And this killer is clearly not an idiot. There are at least seven security cameras in the locale and none managed to capture either this victim or anyone else remotely suspicious. No one working here saw or heard anything.”
“They kidnapped John to get access to our apartment and fill it with surveillance equipment,” Sherlock paused as Lestrade broke in, “It is all being removed as we speak.” John shook his head ruefully, the Inspector always thought about everything.
“Dead for 9 to 11 hours, cause of death a sharp object, probably a razor, which punctured the main artery in his neck,” John pointed at a thin, seemingly innocent, red line at the left side of the victim’s neck.
John swallowed; Sherlock was telling him off, telling him he had gone too far this time but he was not telling him to leave.
Sara clapped her hands once and a soft light filled the room. She opened a drawer and brought forth a crystal bottle and two glasses, she poured them each two fingers of what looked like cognac, “Here Mr Holmes,” She sipped her own and leaned back in her chair, eyes inspecting him over the brim of her glass, well manicured fingers tapping on the glass. Sherlock made no attempt to reach for his own drink.
“Showers? You are rambling John, do you have a fewer?” In one quick stride Sherlock’s hand was on his forehead, cool and smooth. Watson reflexively tried to pull back from his touch but Holmes grabbed his arm and held him firmly in place with a strength that never stopped surprising John.
Not daring to breathe he ripped Sherlock’s shirt open, hands clammy with sweat and maybe shaking a bit. Underneath it the matt black of an armoured vest appeared, the likes police wear.
The man shook his head, a small movement, neck bending only slightly. He looked calm, focused. Like he was exactly where he was supposed to be.
Without warning he ran downstairs, the startled officers doing their best to keep up, their boots stomping behind him. He took a sharp left and followed a corridor until it ended in a t-intersection where he turned left again. And there at the end of the hall was a door which looked remarkably new, a sheet of plastic still covering the laminated wood.
For months it had haunted his every sleeping hour and infested his waking life. Now the dreams came more seldom and when they did they were often intermingled with memories of deserts, battle, and wounded flesh.
Lestrade thanked the brothers and quickly summarized his own role in organizing the raid and thereafter nodded to all inside declared the meeting over.
His normally so well groomed hair was standing on end, making him seem unattuned to the rest of his outfit, the perfect fitting trousers and the pristine, just right, shirt at odds with his ruffled hair.
“They are children John I’m sure they will have forgotten by teatime and brag to their friends about it by tomorrow morning.” Sherlock met and held his eyes calmly, “Is there something else going on John, something you wish to tell me?”
on the telly with a nice cup of tea. A nice relaxing, safe night in and if you get bored we can juggle some explosives.”
“A deal you broke before it was even made,” Sherlock said and lowered his voice so that even John had trouble hearing what he said, standing right beside him, “It was a mistake to think that you could hurt John and get away with it,” His eyes held a dangerous gleam and Sara grew quiet, unconsciously she backed away half a step and looked suddenly uncertain.
“Oh bloody hell Sherlock don’t make me spell it out for you, I need to go out, meet some girls, have some fun.” John said, desperation creeping up on him. He needed to move away from Sherlock, to sit down in his chair and think of gardening, banking or Margaret Thatcher.
