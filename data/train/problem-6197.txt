Red phone: Also, his aunt has been cracking down on his afterschool activities since he got beat up by ‘Steve from Brooklyn’ a couple of weeks ago.
HSBF: Probably because nobody is letting you survive by smoothie and coffee alone anymore. Actually, I wasn’t talking about Ross. I didn’t know. I guess it’s didn’t make the news here. Although, I’m a little rusty with the local language, so I could’ve missed it anyway.
Anthony love: PS that body part really misses you and is sad we probably won’t even have time for a supply room handjob. We haven’t been in the same country since Valentine’s Day/Presidents’ Day weekend. The finalization of the Mumbai agreement and getting Flash settled in his own apartment have been time-consuming.
"Which is scary as I learned by trying to reconnect with Pepper." Tony rubs a finger against Steve’s beard. He is enjoying it and isn’t that sad about losing the clean-shaven Boy Scout.
Me: People that smart at that age can benefit from spending more time around normal people. Benjamin is not normal, but normal-ish. I still regret skipping so many grades.
Me: That you neglected to look at. Trust me on this, I know Coulson. Only Clint and possibly Natasha would be more qualified.
Me: The National Aquarium is a great place for employee bonding, especially because I can’t do bars anymore. Now we’re having dinner before coming back to the Playground.
If you want to talk to me about that, remember to pm me on fanfiction dot net. No deep talk about Infinity War until May 27.
HSBF: But this is really just a timeout and you know it. When you get back from Johannesburg, you’re going to have to sit down with Spidey and talk things out.
Me: He did great and I was proud, genuinely proud, and then it all went to hell. I knew he was still investigating. The suit was still tracking him. I knew he was running reconnaissance and yet I didn’t try to stop him.
Nomad: You blame yourself for all the innocent people that were killed with your weapons simply because you didn’t question Obadiah Stane earlier.
Red phone: Well, your spy was born after January 1986, so she's definitely not an option. Also, I went to grad school with her mom and I think there’s a 67% chance I may have changed a diaper or two.
Looking back at it now, we were both afraid of the exact same thing, but we had different ideas on how to handle it. It probably would've helped if we actually told each other what we were thinking. We didn't. We were way too good at talking over each other. We were too busy assuming that we thought we knew what the other was thinking to ask.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all fabulous. A little programming notes: because of a break in proofreading, I am switching to a once every three-week updating schedule for the foreseeable future. At least until more chapters are banked. However, I am accepting volunteers for more proofreaders. Currently, I have just Ursula. Who is fabulous but I write a lot. I’ve actually already moved two of my stories to AI proofreading only.
“No, we can do five. My first one for you is you’re a good dad.” Steve even gave him his super sweet smile again.
“That doesn’t surprise me. Although, it’s good to see your face.” It’s been only a little more than a week since Malta but he’s so happy to be seeing Tony right now.
However, I’m adapting the questions slightly to avoid pure plagiarism. Hey, maybe they are somewhat different in their timeline.
My assistant Mary Watson (CCed on this email) will contact you all the details and put you in touch with HR to finalize your contract as soon as it’s a reasonable time in New York. She was the one who reminded me that I’m no longer on Mumbai time. She wasn’t happy. However, she still will take care of you in the morning.
“You’re so cute when you do that. I understand because we both have to keep moving forward. Besides, I saw the nano paper out, I should have known that was what you were doing while I spent like 45 minutes doing emails. How’s it going?”
I didn’t say anything because how it was when we were growing up. Especially, because I knew you still like dames as well. Maybe I was hoping that if I found you the right one you would forget about the other part, especially after Artie left. It would’ve been safer that way. I was wrong. I don’t want you to be anything other than yourself.
Blue phone: I think I should just be happy that you just didn’t assume that I was a virgin like everyone else.
Me: You are definitely planning your own wedding. Depending on when it is, I’ll let you know if I’m up to being in the bridal party. I’m going to need at least another year before participating.
Red phone: More fine print from the accords. They’re saying it’s because they want to see if I’m fit to be the leader of the new Avenger team, but really I think they’re just using this as another means to get information because I still haven’t cracked yet. After several rounds of interrogation.
“Not the one that was blown up by the monolith. Coulson and Yo-Yo died, and Daisy and Mack turned to dust; you married Captain bloody America and adopted two kids.” Simmons yelled.
Me: Fitz just walked into the room to check on me. I’ll write you in a few days when you’re not distracted by Stark.
Anthony: I can’t deal with people who are more into appearances then anything else. I had enough of that from the Obadiah years.
Me: Because Deputy Secretary of State would be the chief negotiator when it comes to renegotiating the Accords. Negotiations could begin as early as February, if the new State Department is in place by then.
Genius Princess: I have to go. Deke just punched his grandfather. I really thought Hunter could keep them under control while I eat something.
"I'll go to the room now. Sam, we can catch up later after we relocate to a hotel very far away tomorrow," Natasha said, grinning. Tony is not sure that she's joking because he doubts she's going to want to stay in one place for long.
Me: Your boyfriend almost kissed me before he realized I wasn’t you. I’ll send him back to you in a few minutes unharmed, along with his present.
"Okay, as much as I want to stay with you in this bed and mess up another set of sheets following the letter of Dr. Simmons’ rules, but not the spirit, I probably need to shower and get dressed."
Agent Johnson: That's impossible. There is nowhere on Earth that isn't in the range of a Stark communications device.
Me: In a way. The new Super Human, Inhuman, and Enhanced Liaison Division will stay as an office under the ATCU in cooperation with the UN.
FRIDAY: No, due to the reference of the incident and encrypted Hydra files. I will make contact with my source to get the report digitized so I may review it. I will let you know the results.
Tony: Also, I didn’t contact you right away because I kind of passed out from shock and I’m just getting text privileges back now. Rio is worse than Simmons.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely fabulous. I know you probably have more questions but I hope that the Princess annotations have helped some. More answers to come as the story goes on.
Purple Princess: It only takes less than a half an hour to get to the Lighthouse by quin-jet level craft.
“This trip was definitely worth it because I now have like 50 photos of you being cuddled by the kids. You’re adorable when you’re being cuddled by a four-year-old.” Tony remarked. “She will be five soon. She’s getting so big. I’m pretty sure she grew half an inch while I was at the compound.”
Anthony: Virtual reality training exercise. Dr. Monkey Lover refers to it as the ‘framework’ so we don't get sued by the copyright holders of the Matrix. But the concept is similar-ish, except our goal is to let people beat the hell out of each other without medical visits.
Red Malibu: As the parent of a preteen, you are well aware that they never listen to anything you say which is the whole reason why the ferry incident happened. Unfortunately, the whole situation is making S edgy, i.e. in the mood to arrest people, even juveniles.
Anthony: Extremely encrypted. But I don’t trust any technology. Also, apparently every single one of my so-called friends knew that I had a crush on you before I did.
May: Once this mission is over and we’ve managed to bring everybody back with some actual planning, I think we should get a divorce.
Anthony: Yes, sort of. I’m telling you right now that I will be texting you the entire time, mostly as a means to keep my sanity together.
Me: Or a passport and visa. Apparently, I’m not supposed to give the State Department reasons to come after me. I mean most of Ross’ staff despise him and are praying that the other person wins. Mostly because she doesn’t want to create Inhuman internment camps.
Venom: I think I get that, and I’m not that upset about the robot thing because, honestly, she tried to tell me the truth since the beginning. Since I’m stuck in medical with nothing to do, I’ve been reading our old text messages, and it’s all there.
Friday: I wanted you to be prepared if we successfully make it to the other timeline. Understanding interpersonal relationships and team dynamics of the other timeline can aid in that endeavor. That seems more important than learning how Hydra tried to assassinate several of your family members multiple times.
StarkAE: I‘m almost offended. At least none of the rides at Coney Island were damaged because I would not hear the end of that from my sex on legs boyfriend.
Agent L. Barton: I’m aware after it was pointed out by Tony Potts. This is why we’re figuring out how to turn the Zephyr into a time machine instead of the suits. Apparently, your version is ready for space travel.
Counselor Laura: That doesn’t surprise me. I assume that means Steve isn’t a fugitive anymore because the Mumbai agreement went through.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. Here is part two. The title from this conversation comes from the lyrics of Save Tonight.
Steve: But if we succeed, we’re going to lose Kamala. Tony says that she’s old enough to decide who she wants to live with, but I’m sure she would like to go back to them.
It was at that moment that James Leopold formally Leo Fitz was convinced that the universe truly hated him. That’s also when he lost consciousness.
“Brooklyn Vision Academy was not as lucky.” Tony finished for Steve. It was, unfortunately, a very common story.
Agent L. Barton: I just want to say thank you for helping last night. I don’t think Simmons would’ve agreed to work on her drinking problem if you weren’t so supportive. Now that she’s acknowledged that she has a problem, she really needs everybody’s support.
The Mechanic: Well, not normal fishes and spiders. In the case of the fish, it was contaminated with an agent that can trigger metamorphosis in individuals with a certain genetic marker.
“Despite the spy wife and the teenage daughter, I’m not that good with technology even if the decimation has slowed things down. I uploaded the wrong picture, and even Avenger Friday couldn’t save me." That blush told Tony he was lying, but he won't push.
“If we didn’t have to come here after the Mumbai incident it would have been a possibility but I don’t want to risk coming back here until Christmas and I really want to spend Christmas with you. Besides, I know you have plans with Pepper and your kids. It will be good.”
Me: So glad you’re going with the clean version. I also feel like I have less unfinished business than last time. When I flew up into the wormhole, I tried to call Pepper. She didn’t answer. But if something like that happened again, I would call you just so I could hear your voice one last time.
Tony Potts: That’s right. Me and other Tony would have shared that trauma since it happened before the dividing point.
“I’m sure the team will rule out LMD soon since AIDA was the only one.” Fitz said, just as the door to the room open. It must be time for another session with Dr. Suarez. But it wasn’t the doctor that walked into the room, but rather Simmons. He’s been using her last name to differentiate her from his fiancée back in his own time.
MayMQ: Even divorce doesn’t help sometimes. You can love more than one person at the same time. I have.
Anthony: Not as lonely as I used to be. My tower is now filled with Min Archers and Rhodey has decided that he would rather be in Manhattan for the moment. Also, Lila is currently sleeping on my lap.
“I don't think Sharon would appreciate you contacting her right now. Also, the protocol dictates it has to be me. Especially because part of her cover is me being her uncle.” Tony wonders what member of the team that creates fake identities he pissed off that week. But since he already had a secret daughter come out of the woodwork, he can have a secret niece.
Me: That doesn't mean I was there. How long was I in the weapons industry before I got tired of all the blood on my hands? Hydra weapon plus terrorist group equals weapons deal.
Stephen C: Or even a first one. I’m not wasting this chance and neither should you. You should tell Phil that you love him. You were in love with him when you were with Andrew.
D Fitzsimmons: Exactly, and we really should have considered this possibility, since that's how I ended up in 2018 about a month before half of all life in the universe was wiped out by Thanos. I'm glad I survived because it would've been horrible to travel 70 some years into the past only to get wiped out of existence.
“You’re going in the right direction, but I think because we're calling out from this side, we need a device from this timeline to anchor us. So you using your phone wouldn’t work.” The Princess explained. That made sense.
CoulsonPJ: It makes sense. Look, it's only going to be a couple more days and then you will be back here.
“I have no idea.” Tony looks up to see Steve reply verbally as he grabs the bag from Tony and pulls him into a half hug. “Come on in. I’m glad you’re here.”
Me: I think we became friends because you punched one of those people out. Somehow we managed to stay friends despite the stupid stuff I do on a regular basis.
About six months ago while doing good things, her cousin was murdered by a dirty cop in her home country. Said dirty cop managed to get out of lock up and was on US soil selling weapons, including some old Hydra swag. I helped her find him to make him pay for what he did. I can’t punch you out so I might as well help her.
May: We had lunch last month after I ran into Cruz when Kamala took a campus tour. She’s planning to do dual enrollment for her senior year. Cruz and I talked about the old days.
I am sad that you have to pretend with other people but at the same time I’m happy that I get to see the real you. I’m glad that you trust me enough now to see you. This shows that we’ve come a long way in the last few months.
"I really wasn’t going to. Friday just did that by accident." He was totally lying. Steve knew he was totally lying, which is why his Stark pad was confiscated.
Me: Skye-quake-22’s boyfriend was the one who safely flew away the big bad and his big bad weapon into space where the worst thing it could do was take out a bunch of satellites.
“Look, I’ve already confessed to what I did to your propaganda poster as a preteen. And you know what your name was in my address book.”
“I don’t need politeness right now.” Laura was trying to remember if Steve was this much of a dick before the therapy and getting laid constantly.
Iron Dad: Because I wanted him to focus on navigating the Gen. situation, which apparently means a press conference with the president.
Also, they actually have an entire Avenger’s squad in training on the island as well as a shield/ATCU team helping those with powers. He couldn’t stop the hurricane, but It’s not the humanitarian disaster that happened the first time around, because of the actions of Ross and the then-President. Not that he knew a lot of details, but anything would be better than what Ross did to the Inhumans on the island. Instead, the shield team led by Agents Davis, Piper, and Morales-Davis along with Morales’s wife Rio, (as a representative of the Lincoln Campbell Foundation and SI) were leading the efforts.
Agent L. Barton: Don’t you need to keep reading reports? I know you didn’t get through that many last night because of the Simmons situation.
Me: And when you say stuff like that, it just makes me fall in love with you a little bit more, you bastard. (Message not sent)
Me: And when we went back to that farm to visit the new pony, I got picked up by Ross’s secret forces and spent two days in an undisclosed location before the lawyers took care of it.
Sky Quake can write me when she’s ready. Although, I really would like to talk to her about coming up with additional safeguards for the database along with the Princess. She doesn’t need to apologize for the last time we saw each other. I get it. You’re well aware of what I did in Siberia as well as why I did it. And I still feel bad. We had our heads up our asses so far, that her boyfriend had to sacrifice himself to keep half of the world from becoming zombies.
Counselor Laura from 2023: I thought things were better between you two. Which kid? Do you think you would remember to send a text message if one of your kids were missing?
Anthony: It's not your fault. And if you say it's your fault because of the train incident, I am going to hop into a suit just so I can smack you upside the head.
Me: Only because Skye Quake is still on the lamb. Coulson really wants his baby girl back safe and in one piece. The last attempt fell apart and he only found the budding artist who I will just refer to as Sparrow. I think the only reason why my James is still letting him search for her is because he admires his fatherly affection.
I will have my assistant call your assistant for details. Kevin just sent me a text and the meeting is now Tuesday. I definitely will now be in town.
Anthony: Yo-Yo just texted. Monkey lover is a miracle worker and May is out of the woods. Although, despite the potential life-threatening situation, Coulson still hasn’t confessed his feelings for May yet or vice versa. Despite making some very questionable decisions to get her treatment.
“Well, it was hard not to pay attention after Mary started yelling at you. Especially with the super hearing.”
“I mean he’s going to eventually get half of everything anyway. Why not start early?” At that moment a very large crash could be heard.
Venom: I’m not sure how to start that conversation. I’m sure it will just be awkward, and I may end up calling him Penis [redacted] again.
When did we start being unable to talk to each other? Because deep down I think it was long before you decided that we needed space. Honestly, that's what I miss the most about us. As evident by the fact that I have a boyfriend in another country, lack of sex is not a deal breaker. Lack of communication is.
The Mechanic: What are friends for? I’ll see you next week. We can do lunch. After my Presidential meeting.
Anthony: Stefan is 35 so it's not that much of a problem, especially because, thank God I don’t look 46 which is a small miracle considering all the drugs I did during the 90s. I did not deal well with my parents or Jarvis dying at all.
Anthony: Putting a warmonger in charge of the State Department is not his finest hour. However, the people under Ross are trying to make sure other governments do not use their enhanced persons as weapons of the state under the peaceful use of enhanced person section of the Accords as they simultaneously ignore their boss. They take their oath to uphold the Constitution and serve the people seriously, regardless of who is in charge.
As we get new medium in the MCU, I will be using that for background and to assist with the characterization of characters in this story. I can tell you now I’m going to have some fun with WandaVision background information. I’m sure the next show  will give me more goodies to play with.
Tony: Totally. I feel like that would be a better way for you to come out publicly then let’s say a non-consensual sex tape. That’s such a Captain America way to do it.
D Fitzsimmons: I wanted her to come work for SI. It's an excellent job. Pepper is the best boss, but she refused. All she does is drink and try to figure out a way to go back in time. May and Natasha keep her at the Avenger compound because they feel guilty. Although maybe Steve thought Nat and Nana could be lonely together.
Also, please note that you’re only going to see one image from Steve, but he included a few others in his letter to Tony. It is more fun if you guys use your imagination.
We are on the Avenger/ATCU/Shield channels this time around, so different codenames. The Purple Princess is Afia, which is her field codename as well. The system is forcing her to use her Avenger call name now, unlike the day before, because we are now in active apocalypse mode. The genius princess is HRH Shuri. Once again, MJ is the new consultant.
Me: There are some loopholes. Robots as tools are still allowed. So, to have an LMD that can disarm a bomb or go into a crumbling building and save lives is still a possibility. It just can’t have the ability to become omnipotent and decide that the world would be better off if all humans were dead. You know like last time.
So just let Peter know that right now, this is a timeout. I want him to think about what went wrong and how he can improve. When I get back, we will think about additional training. He’s going to the best public science school in the city, but maybe some supplemental classes might be helpful. There’s things involved in my day job that they don’t teach. My bodyguard/fellow Avenger Melinda mentioned a summer program in DC that one of her friends, Dr. Leopold, runs that might be good for him.
Me: Benjamin is doing well. Relatively speaking, considering the entire school is whispering about him and passing around a video file of him getting kicked in the genitals.
Agent Johnson: Loki and the big brother arrived just as Leo said. I proceeded to get into an argument with Loki then Loki disappeared with Leo. A business card was left behind with an address that doesn’t actually exist, according to Ana. Consulting local for location.
Warning: This chapter does have some minor spoilers for WandaVision. However, I did change something. I can do that because this is a slightly different timeline. Things are not entirely identical to the Sacred timeline. I promise it’s not very plot-relevant.
Anthony: Oh and it looks like you sent a card, a very NC-17 card. I should’ve took the blue envelope as a warning. And you included an inside image of us kissing. Maybe that should’ve been an outside image. I am so glad Laura is not letting Lily Bear come up here right now. At least not until I'm done unpacking.
DILF: That wasn’t an excuse not to talk to you. Melinda was trying to figure out how things went wrong, and Simmons was not cooperative at all and it escalated. Deke is not here.
"Yet that’s no reason for you to banish him to this place. Now we have no idea where he is.” Thor yelled at his brother.
We would be happy to have you on the medical staff at the Avenger compound in upstate New York. Now that the bulletproof pacifist is taking a more active role along with Spidey senior’s penchant for doing stupid things like getting a building dropped on him, we can use staff that understands the unique needs of the Avengers. I think you can be that person.
“This is also true,” Tony said, cutting off his own lamp and letting Steve take away his Stark pad. Otherwise, he would keep reading the history of the other timeline. Which was definitely not conducive to sleep. Although accidentally falling into Steve’s chest was. If he woke up wrapped around Steve, nobody needed to know.
Chocolate gift bags already ordered. The larger version was waiting on my doorstep before I even woke up. I thank Friday for that.
Tony: And I love you but I really wish I did not have to listen to Howard’s endless variations of “you’ll never end up like Captain America”, “you’ll never be as good as Captain America,” or “he’s the greatest and you’re worthless.” I wish I never had to deal with any of that stupid shit that Howard used to say to make me feel so worthless.
Me: That's sweet. But it is good to have a plan in place, well a better one than when I was giving my art to the Boy Scouts.
Director Snookums: You know I feel like you’re bringing up marriage just so I won’t point out the fact that I know you’re lying to me. Coulson’s team in Zephyr One picked up seismic activity within about half a mile of where you were 45 minutes ago. So I’m going to ask again, why are you in Baltimore?
Tony: You’re right, that puts the bar pretty high up for a bad dinner. Nobody tried to kill me so there’s that.
Tony: She’s never happy. Besides, it’s necessary. At the rate were going it’s going to be January before we get through all these questions. Since S is having his worst week in Washington, I decided to take the risk. Jane terrifies me and we really need to be good to go in a couple of weeks.
Anthony: Do you happen to be in a country where you can use Netflix? Or should I just have Friday upload something to your computer?
Ana Jr.: Until last night anyway. Did you use the files found on the Stark server to create your time GPS?
Tony: And she may have got caught in a feedback loop. It was highly uncomfortable and extremely creepy.
“I’m sure Steve is still texting his wife right now. Sugarplum, ask the wife if she is coming over tonight or tomorrow?”
Hunter: Because he didn’t think he was ever coming back. I know you made some similar choices in the same situation. So you can’t judge him for doing the same thing you did.
“Although it’s probably a good time for us to actually get some sleep,” Steve suggested, still blushing.
This chapter takes place about four days after the last one, on Wednesday, September 15 2016. In my universe, Peter and his classmates will be at finals on September 16. I reserve the right to make this change because it makes more sense for the event to be on a Friday and unlike the writers of the movie, I can do math. Really, the eight years later thing was the one thing I hated the most and that includes that upstate New York scene.
Anthony love: Baby, nothing makes sense right now. Honestly, I don’t believe half the stuff Deke told me. I tuned out half of what he told me and then told him to write it in a report. Ana, has he done that yet?
Iron Dad: Sorry, I worried you. I thought Ana would’ve interrupted and told you I am currently en route to the Playground because I have a 10 AM with the president.
“He is unavailable. Leopold J. Fitz, however, will contact you as soon as feasible. He’s currently en route to the new West Coast Avenger facility,” Karen responded.
Me: A lot of very young children and adolescents are suddenly waking up with superpowers like Lily’s new friend from New Jersey. They need someone who has experience working with kids and working with enhanced persons.
“If Director Rhodes was the one in charge of negotiating the original Accords I think I would have at least come to the table with an open mind. I think it might be a good thing if he ends up at State.”
There are a few tiny WandaVision spoilers in this chapter. Remember, I will use things from the new material if it works for my continuity.
FRIDAY: I'm sorry. The phone's sim card has been removed from the device. I no longer have a connection.
Me: I can’t wait to see you either. Although would you be upset if I didn’t show up to the hotel alone?
Anthony: Friday, ask Yo-Yo to get all the flowers moved down to the cafeteria with a sign that says free to a good home.
Cuddle fiancé: Natasha just told me we’re going to the Playground now. May radioed her and changed our route.
Me: May, the spy, is looking into it. Possibly to keep Clint away from her man, but also to do whatever it takes to protect her godchildren.
The new consultant: Regarding your code name, I don’t know. I think it’s randomly assigned. I’m apparently stuck with the new consultant. I don’t even know who the old consultant was.
Chief mechanic: This is good because otherwise, I would probably have to ship my daughter off to Norway to see if she could lift it. Although she’s a little bit more mischievous than her older brother. So we may have had ourselves a problem.
The mechanic: And yes, I’m fully aware that he killed her when he was mine fucked by Hydra, and it was like the 10
Tony: Although I’m upset that Pepper’s chief creative officer is MIA, I’m glad it’s not you. Maybe I shouldn’t have let him look at my time travel theory work.
Tony: Now, I’m sad you can’t get drunk. I don’t have that type of memory. I wish I did. Actually the last time I talked to Mom would probably be one of the top three contenders for question 18, which is the exact opposite of question 17.
The new consultant: She does now. Her body can create energy from food just like we do. She got an upgrade last summer.
“Well I’m definitely better than the closeted asshole who cheated on his wife and conspired with the Watchdogs. I mean it’s not hard to be better than that. Oh, maybe you can start with that story. It will make your James less wary of me. I would seem like a great catch in comparison.”
This conversation takes place about three days after the last one between Tony and Steve because Tony and Steve have to show some restraint, but it is really hard.
Tony Potts: I don’t want to know. Me and Stevie bear decided that we have a bunch of other bullshit to deal with outside of just Siberia. Therefore our answers would probably be different than theirs. It was seven years later with a couple of failed relationships and a few kids between us. We’re not entirely the same people.
Counselor Laura: The kids need me, and I know I’m making a difference. I looked up what happened to a few of my kids here, and I know it was better for them with me there at Midtown. I don’t think my Clint got that. The shouting started because I felt like he was trying to control me, and that’s not going to happen. It ended with him moving to Malibu and filing for legal separation, again.
Red phone: People are twitchy now that there are hundreds of people walking around with powers or enhancements and we are the poster children for enhanced people.
“Point. I'm so glad I don't have Olivia’s class Monday. I feel like I’m starting to get a headache.” Peter said just as he looked at his phone again.
Me: Sorry for worrying you. I was sleeping and I forgot to tell Friday that it’s okay to let you know that I’m sleeping. We are having some ongoing discussions about what is appropriate for her to tell other people. It’s a work in progress.
Anthony: No. Actually, I think my assistant burned them and the stupid card. They didn’t even have the decency to have an intern sign it. Also, if they’re sending out everybody a card that reads, “we’re sorry for your illness or incapacitation, and cannot wait until you are able to be a productive member of the SI family again”, we are seriously fucked as a company.
“This is not your room either.” Tony shot back. He actually got the agents their own suite with private rooms on this floor so they did not have to share with Happy. Even though they were not his agents, he still like them enough not to put them with Happy right now. Seriously, why did Pepper Pop and Director Snuggle Bear make him bring Happy along? Maybe this was their new attempt at cock blocking. He wouldn’t put it past them.
Me: Since last week. It’s okay, I’m adjusting. I’ve been hanging out with Monkey Lover a lot. I adore him, but sometimes I feel like I’m dealing with two different people. But he’s still fun.
“At least through September. They’re hoping to be done with getting the PR Avengers off the ground. You have a point. We will put 19 and the ex-husband at separate tables. Speaking of seating arrangements, according to Hunter, Thor did RSVP for the wedding. He’ll be there, barring Ragnarok. Baby bird says that’s actually a strong possibility. All the more reason for us to hurry up and choose the location. If the Asgardians are going to be showing up, I feel like a remote lighthouse is the best option for the ceremony. We should set Thor by Bobbi.” Tony suggested.
Tony: I was trying to avoid that. Baseball cap and everything. This will totally be on Twitter in five minutes.
“According to Leo’s Intel? Yes. And Coulson has seen a lot, so I can see where this could come from. There was even this incident early on in Coulson’s career in the mid 90s that Fury doesn’t like to talk about and Coulson doesn’t remember because Fury wiped his memories of it. According to the Shield rumor mill, it involved torturing bodysnatching aliens with blue blood and may or may not have been related to project Pegasus,” Natasha responded in a way that made Steve sure she doubted the rumor mill.
Deke was apparently being sent back to keep that from happening, whoever Deke was. Instead, somehow, she ended up here, and he was missing.
Me: Progress in the sense that neither Laura nor Dr. Suarez was there, and it didn’t come to blows. But I don’t think our friendship is back to where it was before. Of course, we’re doing better than Agent and Purple Arrow. Of course it probably helps that there’s no sex involved. Also, Happy is less stupid.
DILF: You don’t think Robin and Kamala are my priority? I don’t want  Robin to keep living in this broken world. Her drawings of us restoring everybody has been the first happy thing she has drawn since May and I received full custody of her.
Anthony: Now that your self-righteous yelling is out of the way, can you tell me when my ex threatened to kill you?
Genius Princess: I found out during November of 2016. Of course, you have access to the events from the other timeline.
MJ: And Thompson would do it to impress his crush. Then maybe he’ll dump the evil boyfriend in California.
“If you consider pointing out all your bad qualities repeatedly throughout the flight that, then yes,” Piper explained.
TMNS: Why did everybody know about the breakup before me? Also, no drinking. Although apparently vast quantities of ice cream were involved.
Kitty Brother: I have been informed that you are still in your lab at the embassy even though it is 7:42 AM local time. Why have you been working through the night?
Me: She’s glad that they’re no longer talking about her breakup. She really wishes that the Watchdogs’ attempted assassination of you was not the reason for it. She also really wants you to call her. Although, she understands why you haven’t because you’re probably busy with your boyfriend.
Me: That whole messy episode is probably why I didn’t date anybody for so long. It was the beginning of my trust issues. Stefan is my second serious relationship. Pepper was my first. A lot of mistakes were made on all parts.
“Someday, when I'm not driving, I want your full relationship history, but I don't think you're ready to tell me that yet.” Tony has lots of questions.
Friday: Text allows for greater exchange of data through the window. But I will see if video clips can be transferred through.
Me: OK last question for tonight mostly because the ones right after it are going to lead to some very angsty answers and I want to be at home with some ice cream when we do that discussion since I’m not drinking anymore.
Anthony: Also Sam was always just your friend and he just tolerated me for the cool wing upgrades. Wanda kind of has a right to hate me.
Tony: She made the new body and gave Afia a wonderful new backstory/legal identity as well as Wakanda citizenship. As far as the US government is concerned, she is a person. She’s also planning to attend Midtown to keep an eye on Spidey Senior and the boy in the chair.
Again, light spoilers from Spider-Man: Homecoming, but I’m doing that thing where I’m re-contextualizing stuff. If you’ve read my Star Trek stories, you know what I’m doing. Now the next chapter will have heavy spoilers for the film.
“No. I think this falls under the category of nocturnal omissions anyway. Kind of sort of. All things I don’t tell my doctor, if I saw my doctor regularly outside of near-death experiences. Although please do not take this as a sign of my stamina. It’s just as I told Friday, been a while." Like he is not 100% sure Friday has been around for a sexual situation that did not involve his right hand and the toy chest. Jarvis was still around the last time he slept with Pepper and bringing random bed partners home would not improve that situation, so Tony got used to sleeping alone until Steve.
Counselor Laura: She’s going to help us. Thankfully, she’s not teaching actual classes this semester.
At the same time, I’m worried. I saw you after Siberia. Not in person because you were and still are avoiding me. But your bruised face was all over Twitter. I don’t know what happened because you won’t tell me since we don’t have that type of relationship anymore, but I’m concerned. I know you can hold your own, but he’s a lot stronger than you are. Jim said that you two have worked it out, but I am concerned. Just because we stopped sleeping together doesn’t mean I stopped caring. I’m always going to care about you.
Me: Yes-ish. Everybody totally believes I have an illegitimate child. The media were child’s play compared to the stuff from the board after the stocks dropped 10 points post announcement. Baker was mad I didn’t knock up a “Norwegian” scientist at a conference.
“As soon as we’re not dealing with multiple Apocalypses simultaneously." Because, of course, they are. At least the Confederacy has already been handled. The earth was still in one piece, so that’s a win.
Did I ever tell you that the last conversation I had with my uncle Ben was a fight? I don’t even remember what I said to him. It was so stupid, but I never got to apologize. I don't want that to happen again. It’s my biggest regret.
Me: I don’t think she wants to kill me anymore. Also, no charges, and I think she might be willing to listen.
"That was my asshole first boyfriend who I thought loved me and instead just wanted to have a story for his company. Notice how his face was conveniently edited out. It's the reason why Steve is my second real boyfriend ever. So congratulations on realizing that most of the things in the media about me are a complete and utter lie."
Me: Of course they are, even though I’m sure it’s the escaped prisoner. Piper mumbled something to Davis about superpowered maniacs with a God complex. I’m going to absolutely love this debriefing when they get back to DC.
Chief mechanic: Yes, they couldn’t have elections in 2020. Things were still too messed up, or at least that’s what Ross argued. The president that they already had before was setting the groundwork anyway for an authoritarian regime.
Me: It's in your phone under Slingshot. If it's the end of the world catastrophe situation you can also try Bulletproof Pacifists and Deathlok. I did his new prosthesis so he owes me.
HSBF: I know you were without your lab for a few days, but you should eat more. That means no more working through multiple meals just to get the project done.
Me: That’s not surprising. James mentioned that the Princess was in America a lot. And apparently the super human, inhuman, enhance human liaison division has already recruited the Princess.
“She keeps calling me Mr. Stark even though my legal name is Potts Stark. Although I’m a little less mad at Howard now that I know the truth.” As a father, he understands why Howard sent him away. He was doing it right now with Morgan, but Morgan knew what he was doing. At least as much as any four-year-old could understand. Although being his and Pepper’s kid, her understanding is probably 12% greater than most four-year-olds.
StarkAE: I have a couple of houses there. I’ll let you live in one, rent free if you change your orders.
Now it’s letter time. This email was written a few hours after Tony’s letter to Steve. It’s one that he’s been working on for a while and I promise happy will see it.
Me: I’m not going to go to DC. Agent America is off on a mission and Yo-Yo is taking a vacation with her boyfriend, but Monkey Lover and Agent Piper are available.
Me: And hand-to-hand combat instructor. He already said he would train Rio since she’s going to be with us on missions as medical support. He’s also seen some of Spidey senior’s early YouTube videos and is concerned.
Me: Because his original plan was dangerous. He thought it was an innovative idea to send the entire toy chest to the new facility at the same time without a whole army of security personnel on board.
Me: Of course you are. Sorry Snuggle Bear, it’s the consequence of dating Tony Stark. There were engagement rumors about me and Pepper for years.
Anthony love: Apparently, Friday 2023 didn’t realize that Friday 2018 is a reality stone enhanced LMD, and Ana is now her appropriate counterpart. This is apparently because Friday 2023 isn’t from our future but the original James Leopold's future. Or you know how it turned out after he was flung through the monolith.
OK, I think you’re right getting the Director involved. Maybe, he can come up with a national security reason for why we can’t even give the New York Times a fake version of this interview. I’m willing to do it for Benji but I’d rather not if there’s a way out of it. Also, of course you were smart enough to figure out how to answer number 25 in an email because you’re a lot smarter than me.
BITC is short for boy in the chair and is Ned’s codename. Because nobody wants to keep typing that, an acronym is now being used.
Chief Mechanic: So, after that, Simmons and the grandkid join a group called Guardians of the Galaxy to look for Monkey Lover 3.
“Check your phone.” She does, realizing that unlike everything else in the room, it’s still working.
I’ll send an update when I can. I don’t want people to know that I have any type of communications device. And by people, I mean my Asgardian roommate.
Me: Yes. I hope you actually do. Tony’s getting desperate. He’s planning to cover the entire house in mistletoe to get you to kiss Phil.
Anyway, enjoy the apology gift that I’m sure you will be receiving soon. I will make sure Rogers shows up for Christmas, if you and the doctors allow it, even if I have to drag him there myself. Okay and let’s hope he doesn’t get shot again before then. Was he always this reckless? Seriously, I would love to wrap him in bubble wrap, but I’m sure he would be pissed off if I did that.
MayMQ: You’ll never be able to convince me otherwise, even though your back. Being with Stefan was my own way of running away, which is why I understand why Daisy felt like she needed to be alone. But eventually it did get better and I did come home to you. Hopefully, Daisy will do the same soon.
FRIDAY: Okay boss. Steve has just responded to your last message. Although, please try to cut the rest of this conversation short. You have only 5.6 hours of sleep in the last three days. You need rest.
“I know you want Robin to meet your BFF. Did you know that your James is dating Robin’s mom in the other timeline? Now I’m extra sad that she died before the snap. It was another wasted life just like Agent Rodriguez.” Tony never met the woman before Thanos killed her. Apparently, she’s one of other Tony’s best friends per the notes he read from Friday.
Me: So much. With him where he is we are probably only six months out from enhanced individual internment camps.
Me: Maybe that’s true. But it doesn’t make it less necessary. Stefan gets that and now I’m with him I get Pepper’s perspective a lot more than I did. I am absolutely terrified that one day we are going to go up against a guy that we are not going to be ready for yet. I’m afraid he’ll die in my arms.
“Can you guys go make sure strangling actually is not involved? I would hate for that to happen to Happy.” He was annoyed with the man, but did not want him to incur the wrath of Black Widow.
“Because obviously, the answer is once everybody you love is out, you don’t go back in. Nothing is worth risking your life. They are just things. It can be replaced." Tony answered.
Cousin quake: Your too much like me before I joined shield. Although we all know it would’ve been Ned.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You’re all fabulous. Time for more Tony and Steve.
TMNS: I know who you’re talking about. Tony got her banned from Twitter after DMing me very explicit pics on my official Spider-man Twitter account. They may have been of that tattoo without her wearing any underwear. Tony called Jack personally. He got them to change their TOS.
Me: Probably. Thankfully, my session didn’t end that badly. I didn’t break down in hysterical tears after I was forced to talk about my Howard issues. I was also not subjected to several rounds of invasive questions about my unauthorized contact with enhanced persons. Finally, nobody turned the thing into a giant interrogation session. Bonus points for that.
Purple Princess: Yes, they shared a bed last night. Also, notice the absence of shirts. I'm almost sure my dad's responsible for these accommodations, but he's not saying anything. I'm using the Avenger channels because of the location where said picture was taken.
Girl Friday: Now you make me feel like a bad friend. I arranged for them to share. I may have also left ice cream, condoms, and a first-aid kit with the intention of just leaving them there and checking in on them in the morning.
Me: Elevator actually because I did get out and walk. Happy can just take his time parking the rental because somebody didn’t want to use a car from the hotel. I can’t wait that long to see you.
Me: Soon to be Mr. Fitz-Simmons. And he just walked into the room. And may have heard me dictating that to the phone. He’s scowling right now.
“I think we’re getting there. We are a work in progress. I just wish I was there to keep an eye on him. I was worried when the stuff about the ferry started coming out over Twitter."
Tony: Good morning, Buttercup. Are you up yet? Have you done your ab crunches yet? I bet you would look super sexy in yoga pants. Fabric clinging to all the right places.
Me: Yes, although she’s going to send it to Jane first. I hope that she was so freaked out that she’ll change her mind and actually publish the thing.
Tony Potts: So good news, I had lunch with Capt. Tight Pants. It did not end in bloodshed or one of us running out of the room crying.
Number one May: Laura is missing? Coulson got kidnapped by [redacted]. I never trusted the general—that poor Ruby.
TMNS: What happened in Germany? What really happened? You told me that he was crazy? Why did you bring me in?
Me: Sex is not training unless you’re doing it right. Although with you, maybe it could be. Oh, the positions I would try out with you. Have you ever read the Kama Sutra?
Tony: There is a loophole. The fact that he’s under 18 means Spider-Teen is under new Shield jurisdiction and if you’re under Shield jurisdiction, your identity is protected on the secret database. Regardless of that, I think it has to be his choice.
Me: Personally, I feel like anybody POTUS chooses, if he gets a second term would be god awful because he has horrible taste in political appointees. I mean his cabinet has had multiple Hydra members. Multiple.
Friday: I have taken the liberty of re-sending the remaining questions to your email account. Please review.
“So, the next question feels like something we already did with question 28. We are supposed to tell each other something we like about one another already.” Tony said, and Steve is grateful that he is moving them onto safer ground.
Venom: Also, who came up with my codename? I don’t like Venom. Why on earth did they decide to refer to me as Venom in this system?
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all fabulous. We are still in the “better choices” timeline. I wish we could alternate between the two lines, but sometimes it’s better to just stay in one timeline for a few chapters before switching. I’m always going to do what’s best for the narrative.
Blue phone: If you read what you sent me, you would know that you didn’t send any pictures of your privates, this time.
Counselor Laura: I wouldn’t exactly call it that and the protocol has been on since Siberia. It’s the main reason why Tony didn’t succumb to alcohol poisoning during his last bender that triggered the alcohol intervention.
Red phone: Because I have a meeting with the ATCU and knockoff Coulson in the morning, but now it’s time to get back to the fun questions. Such as how did you make your money for college during the Great Depression?
Melinda: There’s no easy way to ease somebody into waking up in the future, although this reality is slightly less dystopic than the earth being cracked apart.
Original A/N written April 2022: In Spider-Man Homecoming, Seymour O’Reilly is played by Josie Totah before she publicly identified as transgender. I decided to write this into my story. So, by this point in my story, Seymour is now Cecily O’Reilly. In the comic books, O'Reilly is part of Flash's group. Here she is another ally of Flash and one of the few that knows the truth about him.
HSBF: Not as much as last time. Although, you know that I love you. I would regret not being completely intimate with you physically. You?
Anthony: Technically, she is not an agent anymore. Actually, I think she’s about to overtake you on the most wanted enhanced person list.
That’s essentially what happened when Robbie’s uncle, Eli Morrow a.k.a. the guy in prison for attempted manslaughter read the book and used a shiny project rebirth knockoff to turn himself into a “superhero”. Which he did and then subsequently skewered half of the security team which really actually made him a super villain. Of course, the fallout involved in an explosion that made Coulson, Fitz, and Robbie become trapped between dimensions.
I’ll text you as soon as I can give you my full undivided attention. Snookums is back. Gotta go sugar muffin. Wish I had time to talk you into sending me naked pictures. Agent implied that I’m going to love the new look.
Purple Princess: Again, I think this might be Wanda’s plan for her ultimate revenge against the Stark line. And we did some really shitty things, so I’m not mad at her.
The Wakandan government is in favor of her possible appointment and is looking forward to increase diplomatic relations under her tenure.
Cuddle Bunny: And then you showed up unannounced and ended up doing a pizza party and handing out stark pads to every kid there.
“Okay as fun as this team rebuilding exercise has been, I really would like to get to the ‘build a compass and find the EMP’ portion of the exercise.” Tony said as he wounded bigoted number nine in the leg. That was about the time that Piper and Davis made it into the room. Kudos to Fitz for redesigning the ICERs to being impervious the EMP pulse. They quickly knocked out the remaining evil puppy.
Once again, we are in the bad timeline. The difference in how time passes in each timeline is causing some problems in that regard. However, I do promise things will speed up soon after our next meet-up between the timelines.
Genius Princess: I can’t, mostly because Chief Monkey Lover and the time-traveling R&D guy cannot be left in the room alone. Hunter can only keep the peace long enough for me to eat something, and TMNS might just web them up. That would be bad. Besides, we almost have it. Are you back home yet? I know you’re not in Mumbai anymore.
“Which was bad enough," Peter mumbled under his breath, which resulted in both Flash and MJ putting an arm around him. Everybody was unsettled about that. All of them ended up dust in the other timeline — even Ned. Of his wider circle of school friends, only Cindy Moon and Cecily O'Reilly survived the decimation. (Liz survived too, but she is more Flash’s friend because she’s never going to forgive him for his part in her dad getting arrested.) Although in the other timeline, Cecily was still going by Seymour at the time of the decimation. Maybe it took longer for her to come out as transgender in the other timeline.
“No, it’s not, especially because these powers come from something genetic passed on from the parents. Could you just kiss me again? I need a distraction.” Okay he just need Steve as much as possible.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider: Apparently, Ana was not programmed to lock the door as soon as she detects such activity. I’m going to have to fix that oversight in her coding.
Me: Congratulations, the Princess still believes you’re from the future. She is going to work on a contingency plan for her own citizens because apparently these are the type of people who will prepare for any contingency including invasion by shape shifting aliens because they are that smart. Okay, they already had “in case of alien invasion” plans drew up. The Princess is just going to modify them a bit.
Me: That feud has been going on since Pierce was a young Under Secretary for T. This is just the latest chapter. Besides Shield is now under the DOD and the UN.
Rogers: Are we actually celebrating that? I was under the impression that the Colonel wasn’t completely happy that Tony put his name forward. Which I feel bad about because I’m the one who actually suggested it.
“Yes, but I did bring a toothbrush. Over the last few months I feel like I’ve started to actually get to know you and I think I know how your mind works enough to know that you think you might be the consolation prize."
“Which is why we have already successfully ruled out the possibility of you being an LMD.” She said walking into the room itself, not the safe observation area.
“Is somebody fishing for compliments? Is it okay if I say I like your ass? You know I appreciate your ass. I liked your ass the moment I met you. That’s definitely something you wouldn’t tell a stranger.” Tony quipped.
: Another nickname for Tony Stark. Official codename in the Avenger message system/database. Currently trying to convince system to label my sibling King as Kitty Brother.
Continuity Note: This story is compatible for all parts of the MCU that take place before Captain America: Civil War and AOS the episode Ascension. (Technically, Luke Cage takes place before Civil War.) Anything that takes place afterwards starting with Agents of Shield: Slingshot (and judging by trailer alone Spiderman: Homecoming) will not be completely compatible with the story but some elements will be used. The butterfly effect is in full effect. This chapter is where our butterfly hurricane starts to become obvious.
Also, the people who tried to kill me were arrested yesterday, so no worries. And it wasn’t about you or any other powered person. Little Miss Sunshine was embezzling from the Edwin Jarvis Foundation and when I decided to appoint my new boyfriend as her co-director, she didn’t like that which is why she apparently resorted to murder. Idiot.
Red phone: I’m not even sure. There were secret meetings with thought to be dead spies and saving the world from delusional bad guys. I’m an expert at functioning on minimal sleep and 20 cups of coffee, but this even pushed my limit.
Tony: It’s a toss-up between not growing up in a world filled with homophobic bigots and having a father who is not an alcoholic. I may be projecting on that last one. I might be projecting on both. I’m sure growing up bisexual in the 80s was significantly better than the 1930s, but probably not as much as it should’ve been. The homophobia of the Board is testament to that and unfortunately they haven’t got much better since the 80s.
“I heard you made a particle accelerator in your garage. Although I didn’t know you made a new element.”
“Hydra being responsible for that might actually turn out to be true. At least that was what Zola told us when he was stalling for time.” Steve reminds him.
“We can still go to the beach. We should do something outside of the room together. What I’m trying to say is if we actually left the room, then Piper would have just waited until breakfast to tell us to text your friend.” Steve remarked.
: He is a Dr. Leopold Fitz from possibly another timeline or dimension, brought to our dimension by the explosion of multiple interdimensional portals called monoliths. I am trying to determine if he comes from a later point in our own timeline or from a parallel dimension. So far my research is inconclusive. To prevent any confusion with his original dimension/timeline counterpart, I will be referring to him as Dr. Leopold.
Venom: Of course, she’s the Purple Princess. I’m already on the Watchdog's shit list. What’s one more?
Love: Why the Fuck did you not call me when Ross had you arrested? Getting arrested counts as an emergency. Especially when, in this case, you were arrested in a way that was anything, but legal.
“But what about the people who died by suicide after the snap? Do we bring them back? Or Carol’s wife. They didn’t even get together until after the snap.” Due to some prodding by Deke and Simmons. Tony has no idea what actually happened. “And then three years later, she died of cancer. Do we bring her back too? Can we? Should we? I don’t know the answers to these questions.”
FRIDAY: I felt that you needed to vent and if I alerted you to Mr. Stark’s safety immediately, you would not have written what was necessary. I am concerned that you have convinced yourself that you are responsible for Mr. Stark Senior’s death.
“I really don’t take orders from Shield anymore, even if you’re in charge now.” He doesn’t want to go back to before the fall.
Me: Peggy was also the one who told me about the accident. She stayed with me when I identified the bodies. I even stayed at her house for 2 weeks afterwards.
HSBF: Do I want to know why the woman at the front desk is completely convinced that I’m Chris Evans checking into the hotel under a fake name?
“On the bright side, dad has convinced your mom to let you take a personal day Monday. He says he's calling May next." At her words, Peter looks at the text message that just popped up on his phone.
Counselor Laura from 2023: We are definitely going to have to have a conversation about accessing things you shouldn’t even try to access when I get back. Lily bear, I'm fine. I’m not really in our future. I’m in 2023 in a different timeline.
Tony: My other self is engaged to Steve in the alternate timeline because, apparently, the fate of the world hinges on us being on speaking terms.
Me: Hard to show up to work when you’re locked up on treason charges. I wish Ana could send them to voicemail, but unfortunately, they're here at the penthouse, and I have to deal with this in person. Video conference tonight. Operation Leopold is afoot.
Anthony: I agree, but not in this case. We were in rehab together once and played a lot of fun tricks on the staff. I’m hotter of course.
Lily bear 2018: That’s different, although I'm sure he's a good dad. He's excellent with Afia, Flash, and [redacted].
Anthony: Although Agent Scary has found it entertaining and she finds nothing entertaining which is understandable after her recent foray into widowhood.
Things will be different because of the ripple effects of Tony and Steve trying to fix things and Tony sobriety. Okay, the divergent point in this universe was Tony calling out Steve’s name in bed with Pepper. For those of you who watch the Framework arc of Agents of Shield, you know that one change can have major effects.
Love: I’m glad I’m several thousand miles away, even if I’m dealing with an emotionally distraught Nomad
The boss: He’s married to your alternate timeline counterpart. Apparently, he assumed time travel was more like Back to the Future than Star Trek.
Purple Princess: OK, sometimes I think this is her vengeance on the family line for killing her parents. Which is justified. Although I’m pretty sure it was Obi responsible for the bomb that ruined English night, a.k.a. killed her parents. But again, she’s entitled to vengeance because our name was on the missile. I feel guilty, so I watch old episodes of Malcolm with her in the middle of the night over secure video chat, and I let her make me get sleepy sometimes. I owe her.
“OK, can you explain to Pepper what’s happening until Dr. Leopold is conscious enough to talk to his boss himself? Also, dust off the strategy to tell the board that he's an Avenger. We might need it soon."
I hope you told Kevin to get a couple of cases of those cookies for Monday's thing at the Children's Hospital. Yes, I'm still going. I need to show the world I'm not dead and that I'm not afraid.
“And Stark is very partial to your new look. I had to listen to him talk about the joys of beard friction on the flight here. That might be why Happy was so cranky.” Steve groaned at her words.
Counselor Laura: That's maybe something Friday can look into when I'm not trying to figure out how to avoid an apocalypse. However, they're working on getting me back on their end.
I am meeting with Tony Stark soon to assess if he should know that there are currently two Leopold Fitz is in this timeline as well as the fret that is yet to come. After reading his correspondence with Captain Rogers, I believe I can trust him, but I still have reservations. Knowing the future is a burden that not everyone can handle.
Chief Mechanic: Ana doesn’t have access to the cameras in lab six because the Princess is blocking her. Which has me worried. I know all the kids are down there, including Flash and MJ. Also, your grandkid is there. Earlier, Ana said they bonded over dysfunctional families.
"I was expecting to spend the day you bounce back from the future in bed, celebrating the fact that you haven't suddenly disappeared from reality." After dating for 16 months, Leo knew that was his boyfriend's biggest fear. Leo's as well. If he really thought about it. But today's the day, and he is still here.
Me: You’re such a sap, it’s adorable. Yeah, I want something similar except no SI stuff and no work crisis. Just us together all day, nothing possibly going wrong. Bonus points for the fact that I am now allowed to engage in sexual activities. The doctors, Simmons and Suarez gave me the green light a couple of days ago.
Happy Bear: I’m sure you probably won’t even read this message until tomorrow unless Friday flags it for you but I want to apologize for how I acted. I’m sorry.
3. You love kids. You absolutely love them, especially your kids. I see that in the way your protective of Benji, the Purple Arrow children, Ms. Marvel and Spidey Junior. Even before I knew that you were pen pals with that kid from Tennessee. And I think you would make a good father/guardian to a child someday, as long as you don’t do a repeat of Germany. That was stupid.
“Not yet, but if Yo-Yo gets accidentally on purpose touched inappropriately again, it will be a near thing. Too many sleazy business leaders. I have 20 minutes." Tony said as he kissed Steve.
Tony: See this guy that you love, loves you too and realizes what type of situation you are in. As much as he wants you here with him, he’d rather you be thousands of miles away and safe than be sleeping next to him right now and be in danger. He doesn’t want anything to happen to you because he loves you so much.
Tony Potts: She realized she was three months pregnant with Morgan. I needed three DNA tests before I believed her, which might be why we are still just publicly engaged after all these years.
Maria isn’t complicated. She was the good parent. One of them anyway. Anna and Jarvis were the other members of the parenting team with Howard doing who knows what really. Maria was the type of person who would come all the way down to boarding school so we could just hang out together. She was the one who told Howard off for being a prick. She was the one who told me I deserved better than my first idiot boyfriend that outed me to the press.
Tony: Absolutely not. Which is why we are never ever going to have text message sex. It’s bad enough that she knows about what I did to that poster.
Text messages from the life of a teenage LMD navigating the halls of Midtown School of Science and Technology the best way that she can.
Blue phone: Only the fake personality that you put on for people who don't deserve to see the real Tony.
Director Snookums: That you were completely in love with him and when you're in love, you will do crazy things to protect people you love. Sometimes, they blow up in your face.
Football Hunter: Not yet. Your baby brother is being extra cautious. He’s just like I remember you before you lived like three different lives. Sweet. Almost innocent. I guess getting kidnapped by a sexual assaulting bot that wants to be a real girl will suck the sweetness out of anyone.
Me: It’s so great to hear from you after almost a year of radio silence. And even that was a baby shower present postmarked from Arizona. I mean, you could’ve at least told me that your boyfriend wasn’t dead anymore.
Tony Potts: Good to know. Although how did I end up the foster parent of Peter’s biggest high school antagonist?
StarkAE: Friday, if you do not want to become the AI to Spidey‘s cell phone, and I mean Spidey Junior‘s kids Stark phone, you will get that video off now. I prefer there not to be any references to what happened to my parents out there.
D FitzSimmons: Well, he was wrong. Also, good on him for getting the wedding moved up. Other Nana invited me to their anniversary party.
Warning: This chapter does have some references to information that we discovered in WandaVision. Of course, it's been twisted for this timeline.
After they got to Malta and Piper cleaned up Steve’s wounds, the couple mostly stayed in the master bedroom on the property. The only break was two nights ago when they had dinner together with the other secret Avengers and tried to talk about what each side needed from a new Accords. Surprisingly, that went better than Steve thought it could which meant nobody ended up covered in bruises and there was no property damage. That was all he could hope for, at this point.
Tony: The LMD was so anatomically correct. Like, I would not have known that she was an LMD until she started to speak and I recognized that I was talking to Aida.
The boss: I probably should have sent you this text message before I got on the road, but Steve and I are on our way to Pepper’s house. So, you can have the night off.
Tony: We're going to take the kids to Brooklyn, so there's no need, and I have a bag at Pepper's place. I actually probably have more clothes there than here. I do have my own bedroom there.
Some of the events in this chapter have been adapted from AOS episode 4.2 and 4.3 but have been modified for the new timeline. There are also allusions to the events of episode 4.22 as it occurred in the original timeline.  There are some slight references to Ant-Man and the Wasp in this chapter as well.
Note: For some reason in the MCU, probably due to bad researching, Malta is not part of the EU. I decided to reconcile real geopolitics with MCU history by having Malta be previously part of the EU, but they left right about the time aliens fell over Manhattan.
"I don’t know.” Tony responds hesitantly. “It was nice being with someone who can fight along with me when it all goes to hell. At least I don’t have to worry about my assistant getting killed. It was kind of nice to not have to worry about that."
Tony: Hey, I can do holographic interfaces. It’s just that I want your phone to be almost inconspicuous.
Anthony love: So please hurry up and text me back. Because I do not want to deal with a pissed-off Agent May. I’m not 100% sure she’d ever forgiven Leo for icing her to prevent her from using the big book of evil everything.
Steve: Since you finally told me about Pepper, I’ll let you know the truth about my family. You know that in the history books it says that my father died in World War I. But did you ever look at my Shield file?
We are on Avenger channels in this conversation. I debated whether this conversation could happen on personal channels, but this does become a business conversation because the purple one is coming. Leo Fitz of the prime timeline, a.k.a. James Leopold, is Chief Monkey Lover. He is also head of the UN Avengers. Tony gets Chief Mechanic now since he is the head of the ATCU. Mack’s call name might have some variant of mechanic in there as well. He is the West Coast division head at the moment. They are terribly busy on the West Coast right now. This might be a good time for you to check out Ant-man and the Wasp for background purposes.
“Maybe not in this timeline, and I’m just one of the heirs. Peter is also an SI heir along with the Fitz Brothers. I'm sure Flash has a trust fund with a lot of SI stock in it. Also, I think Pepper is grooming him for something big at the company. She's already planning to take him to look at various business schools.” Afia joked. Although not really because Peter knew he was an actual heir apparent to Stark industries. He still couldn’t believe that.
Red phone: He was the greatest person in the universe. He was the one who could keep me sane some of the time. Unfortunately, he succumbed to lung cancer when I was 25. Jarvis never smoked, but most of dad’s cronies did including Obadiah.
Tony: Yes, because we’ve spent so much time together lately, I’m already reading your mind. I should probably email Laura to get her take on things, but she’s probably enjoying quality time with her husband and I want to at least give her a few days before asking her if I should give Spidey the suit back.
Me: Spidey is another person who is in your life. Then there’s Coulson, Melinda, Yo-Yo, and Clint, who probably wouldn’t appreciate you making sex jokes.
FRIDAY: I did not allow codename Spidey into the tower to retrieve his suit, nor did he request access to his suit after you took it from him. However, my analysis of #Spiderman is telling me that I probably should have.
HSBF: I’m glad the director asked you to stop because I don’t want him reading that stuff either. It was different when it was people that we didn’t know or Ross himself. This makes me a little uncomfortable and really glad Sharon wasn’t the one reading the messages.
Anthony love: Please write back to me soon and let me know that you’re alive or at least still in this timeline. It’s been a weird day. Good news Clint didn’t hit me, but he did cry on me. I gave him some of my ice cream. He’s a mess.
Tony: I really wish Jane would just not force me to do an article for the New York Times when I’m dealing with everything else.
PS: About five minutes after you read this, Friday's going to replace the S word with Stefan and rejigger things so Ross doesn't know I'm talking about you know who. Yes this is my life. Never date a fugitive.
Me: Really well, I caught him looking at wedding rings while we were here. So I think the proposal is going to happen soon. I mean he knows that you and she got engaged before you went through another hole in the universe. That put the idea in his head to get it done before the world blows apart.
Tony: Fitz definitely found some bodies. My aunt didn't die because of a weird light bulb changing accident, but because Hydra tried to kill Howard. Unfortunately, Ana was collateral damage. Of course, I found all of this out reading the other timeline text messages.
Red phone: The company stopped making it so I paid a ridiculous amount for the formula and I make it myself now.
Tony Potts: His boy killed another member of my family, and Steve kept it a secret. That seems on brand.
Therapist Laura: No, she showed me messages to her, the ones where you have somehow convinced yourself that you’re culpable for Howard Stark’s murder because you were unable to keep your friend from falling off the train. Coupled with reports of your near death experience and the fact that Nomad seems to mostly concern himself with rescuing victims of kidnapping, I’m concerned.
Counselor Laura from 2023: He's a broken version of you. He is a man who’s wife and children disappeared out of existence when he had his back turned. He blames himself for ignoring the emergency phone calls of Fury, May, and Coulson. Although I totally understand why he ignored Coulson's phone calls because he didn't actually know he was alive again.
A few notes, we will be switching back and forth between the “Tony and Steve have their ship together” timeline and the “Tony and Steve are still idiots” timeline. Which as you see so far is not quite the same as the way it was in Endgame cannon, such as the fact that Tony is not married, but Steve is. We will explore why that’s the case as we go forward. I have my reasons for mixing things up a little bit.
The new consultant: That she's not on Asgard but another planet. Ana won't even let me have access to her last suit cam video. Stark himself blocked it, and the Princess won't override it.
TMNS: He did that to break up you and Steve? He wanted you to lose the person you love because you accidentally made him lose the one he loved?
Me: I came up with my best stuff at 16 before my creativity was tampered by assholes on the board. Besides, that would be something Howard would do and you know I hate being anything like Howard.
You’re in DC trying to protect everyone and you don’t have to but you do. I admire and respect that about you. I thought you were selfish before, maybe because I read a little too much of the S.H.I.E.L.D. dossier or saw one too many things about you in the news, but you’re not that person. You wouldn’t have been by my side during the battle of New York, if you were who I thought you were.
Me: Clint is okay with living at the compound, especially after the Watchdogs attacks a couple weeks ago. The old farmhouse is compromised due to Ross. So they can’t go back there anyway.
Purple Princess: That’s because you are Ms. Marvel’s beta, and you make sure she doesn’t post things she shouldn’t.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely wonderful. This conversation takes place late in the day on October 24 Tony’s time.
Me: Man wasn’t meant to time travel. Although, I like this version of you better. A bit of a darker edge. Also, you don’t get anywhere near as flustered with the sex jokes.
Me: The happy life you were planning with Peggy on those cold war infested nights or somebody to share your life with now as it is in reality?
I’m surprised you let me anywhere near your kid if you remember that particular youthful indiscretion.
Football Hunter: But then you wouldn’t be here trying to fix the world. Just focus on preventing the robot apocalypse, and I will handle the rocks that eat people.
Genius Princess: I will be at the Lighthouse in two hours. We will have a briefing. I would bring BITC in, but he's with his mom this weekend, and she doesn't like your dad very well.
Anthony love: Please explain how Hydra managed to get in league with a group called the Confederacy. That seems like a potential Hydra ally.
Me: It really is. So you were right. Her death threats against you were just the shovel talk. She was jealous.
Anthony: Deputy Director Mace and his bodyguard/minion just walked into the room which means lie detector time. Write to you later, Muffin.
Agent L. Barton: I’m not even going to ask about the Instagram incident. I feel like it’s better that I don’t know.
Anthony love: I know you’ve been radio silent for less than an hour, but she’s worried. You know we’re all on edge because Robin keeps drawing pictures of doom, gloom, and a purple genocidal maniac.
“Would it make her feel better to know that she’s married to the other Fitz, and they’re expecting their first baby soon. There are some pictures of the makeup reception in there.” They had one about a month after the wedding once Leo was healed from his gunshot wounds. She still can’t believe Alastair tried to kill his son at the Fitzsimmons wedding with the help of the Watchdogs. It was beyond disturbing.
Tony: Sort of. I hired his construction firm to do Phase 2 of the SI upstate compound. Bonus, now I have a babysitter and Spanish tutor for TMNS.
Stephen C: Yes, multiple times. Right now, I am just going to treasure every moment I have with Tony. With what we do, you never know how much time you have left.
“I'm also good at lying to myself, but I think I need to stop." Although in Steve's defense, he didn't think Tony would ever forgive him or want to be with him was a lie at the time.
In regards to some of the reviews, I want to address how this story will be handling the Accords. I will be taking my cues from Agents of SHIELD on enforcement to some degree because they are the first part of the MCU to really deal with the fallout (even Luke Cage will apparently be taking place pre-Accords and before the episode Watchdog of AOS which takes place in late February early March in the story).
The Mechanic: I was trying to get TMNS to tell you on his own. Since you read the letter you know that I was trying to set up a safe place for that conversation Saturday.
"Although there are some pictures of my mom that I don't think I have anywhere else. I still wouldn't go back for them.”
A/N: I wrote the original draft of Steve’s letter to Tony a few weeks before the Infinity War trailer and Agents of Shield season five dropped. I was intending for Steve’s words to be “harsher in hindsight”, but they managed to get that way before the chapter even dropped. I cringed when I reread it after the two products came out (especially Agents of Shield), but decided not to change it, although I did adjust Tony’s response a little.
Although now that we’re back, I suggested to Peter that we could do dinner on the Saturday after school starts back up. I can even take you to the lab so Peter can show off what he's been working on this past summer. He really is the best intern I've had. I’m going to miss his presence in the lab now that he’s going to have to do more school stuff. Although I think we can arrange for him to work on weekends if that’s okay with you?
Part of me thinks that you’ve skipped off to where ever ‘Stefan’ is, but Phil has reassured me that’s not the case. That was a deeply unpleasant conversation for several reasons. When were you going to tell me that Phil was back? Or is that just one of those things we don’t talk about? We have a really lengthy list of things that we need to talk about and I’m tired of avoiding those conversations so I’m going to start now.
Me: Don't you think it's a waste of your limited resources to be chasing after somebody who just wants to help people?
Thankfully, Hunter decided not to mention the fact that in this drawing, they was a green woman with antlers and a giant wolf or the fact she was allegedly their sister. Leo had a feeling that’s not going to go well. Of course, before Leo could say anything about this, he found himself inside of a house that he recognized from Robin’s artwork. The man he knew from Coulson’s fake medical file, the one that covered up his resurrection.
Counselor Laura: Apparently, you still have the phone number of my Tony since the address book is showing it as the usual contact for him even though Friday said you had a non-Avenger phone number. Congratulations, it only took you an hour.
Purple Princess: At a minimum, you will stay over tonight, maybe longer. Dad's going to have to talk to our principal.
Me: Which isn’t true because I’m pretty sure Bruce is straight. I think Benji is freaking out because his aunt still thinks something is going on between him and Ned. I have money on him and Michelle. Friends sometimes become more than friends.
“Of course he does.” He said, tired of dealing with toddlers. “Did you tell him about what happened two days ago?” He asked the young woman in front of him.
Friday: I no longer have access to that information because it was transferred to Ana Jr. I purposely chose not to make a backup copy.
“We are professional lemonade makers. At the same time, you feel guilty because you are here enjoying the good stuff when other people are not.” Tony remarked.
“It was. The doctor is inside me. I hear his voice telling me what I need to do to save you and the team. Not all of its good. Sometimes, I even see him,” Leo confessed.
Me: I say we do lightning round and knock these last few out then it will no longer be over our heads.
Anthony: It will be because I still don’t have twitter privileges yet. And considering what we’re watching, it’s probably for the best. Otherwise I would be making snide comments about Jonathan Windom West’s apparently tiny genitalia and lack of sexual prowess.
Counselor Laura: My marriage is really fucked up, and I really miss my kids. Also, Tony is probably furious at me because, apparently, things are really different in this timeline.
The Mechanic: Like that’s going to be that hard. Ross got through one. As well as his predecessor and that guy was Hydra. And Malik. Rice will be easily confirmed and you will be as well.
"No, Steve is your first real boyfriend." Sam amended. "The asshole with the sex tape doesn't count. I can see why you have trust issues."
“Very aware but you kind of killed her good father. So surrogate daughter of Phil is a little angry, and she could split a continent apart when she’s angry or blow a man to pieces, not the fun way.” Hunter remarked, Leo just rolled his eyes at his boyfriend. Daisy glared.
BITC: Because she threatened to take him back to court if he did. I know they won’t listen to me when I tell them that I would rather live with my dad full time. They didn’t last time.
“I’m aware.” Steve tells him. “There was a transcript of the post-Afghanistan press conference in my welcome kit.”
Me: See, this is another thing we’re going to have to come up with fake answers for. I’m never going to say something that personal in the New York Times or anywhere else. I might be 30 seconds from crying. I hate crying.
Iron Dad: Sorry, I was on a video call with Jeffrey and the minion, which is why I couldn’t reply to your litany of text messages. I need to get Jane to leave SI and come work for the ATCU.
Spider-Man Homecoming will influence the story more because the characters are directly involved. But thankfully due to the style of the story spoilers will be kept down to a minimum. Also, Tony and Steve being on speaking terms will change things. For those of you who are not familiar with my writing pedigree, I once wrote an Ugly Betty story live with the season. They sent one of my main narrators to Africa. That experience taught me to be flexible.
Me: Yo-Yo. She and her BF Agent Shotgun Ax are in the car with us. We just got the signal that we can get out of the car, so keep an eye out. Yo-Yo is going to post some video.
"I aim for us to be far away by that point. I'm sure I can find something to occupy our time locally." Natasha remarked. That's when Sam walked over to hug her.
Tony: OK, I will ask Mary to book another suite at the Oberoi. It’s in the financial district. And lovely. It’s fine. You know I can afford lots of suites at five-star hotels.
"I think she’s going to always need her uncle Tony.” Steve said pressing a kiss to Tony’s mouth again.
Iron Dad: I don’t know. You know I am the one in charge, so I’m going to go ask your almost step-dad to come to DC.
“Last week, I went to him to ask for his help with our attempt to create time travel using the Pym Particles to undo what happened. The only thing he was willing to do was to watch Robin. I think he doesn’t want to help because deep down, he still hates me.” Steve tells her. Laura was personally fighting off the desire to shake Steve. Really, she thought she was so done with Tony and Steve pining after one another. There’s also Steve being too self-absorbed to realize not everything is about him. Here we go again. Maybe she should’ve let Steve come across Tony’s ramblings to her earlier. Perhaps that would help him get a clue.
The boss: I am aware. My other self ended up the director of Shield or rather the replacement agency.
It’s been 201 hours since I first arrived here, and I’m back to wanting to smack Loki upside his damn head. He is sleeping with the grandmaster. I think it’s stupid.  He thinks it’s the best way to survive. As well as our best shot of trying to find a way off of this planet. After 201 hours, I’ve concluded that these messages probably aren’t making their way to earth, or they’re taking weeks or months to get there. So I can’t sit around waiting for Robbie to come to rescue us. We’re going to have to save ourselves.
Football Hunter: More the reason to do it. Stark and the Princess actually suggested that maybe as my cover, I should be your husband instead of just your boyfriend. Stark really wants to fuck with these people as much as possible. The Princess set up my ID that way. Although, she offered to switch it to something else because she may have sat through at least one Bobbi rant.
Counselor Laura: When Steve and May came to your house last week to asked you to help with their Time travel project, why did you say no? Was it because of Morgan? Because you don’t want to leave her behind if things go badly.
Me: It was a different time. The only person I told was Peggy. I only told her because I felt like if we were really going to start something she should know.
BFF Ned: I really hate the fact that my mom hates Mr. Stark so much. It’s been a year since the wedding incident. She should just get over it, but now she’s just as controlling as ever.
Tony: I know I could call Jane myself, but I feel like you should hear this from me and not her. You deserve that much.
"No conversation with the Board of Directors is pleasant. Any conversation where I have to cover for Happy using Rhodey’s new job is even less so. The fact that I think one of them arranged for someone to leak candid shots of what happened makes it so much worse." Tony sighed as he took a drink from the large coffee in his hand. That was his 3
