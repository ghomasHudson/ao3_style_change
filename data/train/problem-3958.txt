“I came to apologize,” he said, voice impassive. “I now see that you were busy.”
“What the hell is so funny?”
So, he chose a random day during school hours to pick up his phone and, as Jo would say,
Dean shook his head, “Well, what happened?” He turned on his heels until his back was facing Jack. The kid knew by now what to do. He stepped forward and securely wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck. Dean pulled his arms under Jack’s legs and lifted him up on his back. He started walking towards the house when he spoke again. “I mean,” he scoffed, “What’d you do to this girl anyway? You put a bug in her Lunchable?”
? Surely he is a more capable Hunter than this.
The boys had gotten their usual two queens special when they stopped into a town for the hunt. They still chuckle to themselves at the odd looks they receive when three grown men ask for a room with only two beds. Dean usually throws them a salacious wink as he grabs the keys.
"Dean, do you have any idea what you have done?!" Castiel repeated when he didn't receive an answer the first time. Judging from the startled look on Dean's face, the Hunter must not know what he's done at all. Knowing Dean Winchester the way that he does, Castiel can guess that Dean just walked head first into the first thing that crossed his path that would potentially help in ridding the world of Abaddon.
Crowley glares and responds in the affirmative.
"Can you stay with me the rest of the night, Dean?" inquired Castiel quietly.
moments," Castiel interrupted sternly. "We are going to remedy this misconception you have of yourself. Do you understand me?" Castiel glared at his lover until green met blue and Dean conceded with a nod. "Good. Can I get out now? So we can clean these wounds and eat?"
“Just wait here, Dean,” said Castiel from the backseat.
"Hasn't worked much so far. Plus, this is totally a one man job. I'll stay here in case Kevin comes back," answered Sam quickly.
"Then I would like to carry you over to the bed and open you up on my tongue-"
Castiel nods before speaking. "I knew his name and what my service for him would be before I even heard my own name. Father made sure that I would become the Angel Dean would need, and when you're given something like that, how do you not fall in love with the object of your study? He is the only thing that I know better than anything else."
"Daddy?"
"It's Sam..."started Kevin.
"You guys are so screwed." The witch laughed at their predicament and squeezed harder on their throats.
Pandamonium hit fairly quickly once they were inside.
"I love you, Castiel," he managed barely above a whisper.
"Sorry, Dean. I didn't mean to scare you. I just wanted to tell you something before you leave," finished Kevin with a nervous glance over his shoulder.
"I just...I just realized that I have to get back to Sam today. And it's a lot harder than I thought it was going to be. I fucking love laying next to you. This past week has been the most relaxing thing I've ever experienced and it's fucking ending."
"Hey, baby," replies Dean with a matching smile.
"You needed forgiveness, Dean. I allowed myself to get caught so that I would be brought to you. I had heard rumors that you were Alistair's favorite and that he would give you the best people to torture-"
. Please tell me we’re at least best friends
Tight. Hot. Perfect. Those were the only words on repeat as he pushed forward into his lover. He hasn't had much experience to compare this to, but he knows that nothing will ever compare to being with the one person that has ever meant this much to him. "Fuck, Dean, you are so amazing."
"What's the matter, Sam?" inquired the Angel.
"I'm going to head out first thing tomorrow for Oz." Castiel didn't miss the excited gleam in Kevin's eye.
Castiel slowly pulled his member out of Dean's mouth which caused the human to protest, "I wasn't done with that!" A stern stare stopped any further complaints. "Right...what you want when you want. I remember now."
The hunter ran his tongue along the seam of Castiel's lips and surged the organ forward when he felt the Angel gasp, winning the fight for dominance not long after. Just as it was getting difficult to breathe, Dean moved his attention to the smaller man's jaw. He reveled in the feel of stubble on stubble against his cheek as he ventured further and grabbed the lobe of Castiel's ear between his teeth. The man underneath him shuddered and thrust his hips upwards in response to the sensation.
"I'd never leave my domestic partner in crime, despite the fact that
"Why are you here, Dean?" continued Cain.
The hunter turned to look at Castiel and he winked and shot a smirk towards his brother. "Sure do, Cas. I was just messing with you guys," he laughed. "Had you goin' for a second there, didn't I, Sammy?"
The Angel sighs from his seat in the Impala for what seems the hundredth time since the two lovers had set out on their way back to the bunker. Dean had already called ahead to forewarn the others of their arrival within the hour. The suffocating air was heavy enough that the Angel felt as if he were going to be bent in half from the pressure. Dean hadn't spoken a word except to ask the other man if he needed to stop somewhere to let him know. Castiel couldn't help but feel as if he would pull his hair out. As an Angel he never needed to read Dean's mind because of the five years they had known each other in Hell, and he doesn't need to have the ability now either.
"Yeah, I know," smiled Dean, "it's great. Sometimes it feels like we spend TOO much time together and I can't hardly breathe, but then moments like these make it all worth it," finished the elder brother.
“Perhaps I was too quick to agree to this, Dean.” Another smack. “You seem confused.” Another.
Minutes later, Castiel was the one to break the silence this time. “I know that Claire is different from the other kids. But I…” he sighed, and Dean noticed he seemed to be doing a lot of that. “I don’t know how to let her know it’ll be okay.”
Dean sighed. “Okay,” he said, then angled himself inside to shout out, “Claire! Your dad’s here!”
Jack didn’t answer, and Dean was pretty sure he knew what that meant. He placed the pack on his son’s face once it cooled up and winced as Jack hissed at the feeling.
Castiel didn’t say anything, but sat his half-empty mug aside and looked up at Dean.
Sam cut in. “Whatever you say, Dean,” he said, as if anything that had come out of Dean’s mouth was coherent. “I’m gonna go now. I’ll let you get back to figuring all that out.”
“Right,” Dean huffed and rubbed at his forehead. “Alright, I’m on my way.”
“That’s the thing! He’s playing for my team, but doesn’t wanna step up to the plate,” Dean rubbed a hand over his forehead and blew out a heavy breath. “And the guy is hot, Sammy. Granted, talking to the guy can be like talking to an automated phone service. A very, very hot, nerdy, scruffy automated phone service. God, and his voice. Sam, his voice drives me crazy. I feel like I could just—”
He froze when the man on the other side of the door was revealed to be a complete stranger. He was just about the same height as Dean, maybe an inch or two shorter, standing stiff as a board in a long trench coat, casual suit and tie and a mean ass glare that Dean was pretty sure he didn’t deserve.
“I suppose I did enjoy it,” he looked to Dean. “Maybe I’ll get one.”
And when the staring lasted a bit too long, Dean just rolled his eyes and grumbled, “What the hell.” He closed the distance again, kissing Castiel and pressing until he could back him up against the wall of the kitchen. Castiel’s hands were on his neck and Dean was back to exploring with his own. He reached under Castiel’s shirt and rubbed his hands up a smooth, bare back, clawing at it with dull nails. Castiel’s legs were pushed apart so Dean could wedge one leg between them until Castiel was nearly forced to lift one and wrap it around Dean’s thigh. Dean rotated and ground his hips, groaning at the thick bulge forming in Castiel’s trousers and the way it pressed roughly against his own.
It was so deadpan, it hardly felt like a question. But, regardless, Dean answered,  “I like to think it’s for any and all who are youthful at heart.”
Castiel smiled and shook his head again.
Castiel huffed, frustrated now, “Because, Dean. It just wouldn’t be wise.”
“It’s alright,” Jack cut in. “It was my fault.”
“I just wanna talk,” Dean said, sounding a bit more urgent.
“Oh, shut up,” Dean groaned.
“Well, I think you should take Jack home and let him get some rest,” Mrs. Karmichael said. “And Jack,” she looked to the kid. “If you want to take an extra day, I spoke to Mrs. Lee and she says that would be fine.”
“I suppose you could petition the mayor,” Castiel said and Dean laughed.
“Want some coffee?” Dean asked, but Castiel shook his head before he made a move for the pot.
“Yes. Your son sent my daughter home with a black eye and we demand an apology.” He swiftly stepped to the side and gripped the shoulder of what appeared to be a young girl with said black eye. It looked pretty bad, if Dean were honest. Her long blonde hair barely covered the purple and blue bruising. Her arms were crossed tightly and she wore a scowl and a glare that seemed to emit young rage.
“Look at me, Cas,” Dean said, and he barely recognized his own voice. Castiel didn’t make a move to give Dean what he wanted right away, so Dean stroked his hand up their cocks to give him a little encouragement. Castiel choked out a moan and hissed at the feeling. “Cas,” Dean said, softer. “Look at me.”
, like you did to me.”
“Yeah, well,” Claire huffed and rolled her eyes. “I guess it didn’t suck, Dorkchester.” And then she actually did smile, and Dean was just too angry to appreciate it.
“You don’t know shit about me or my kid, pal.”
“You guys have fun?” Dean asked, and wondered if his voice was as loud in real life as it was to his ears.
“Fine!” Claire shouted. “I’m sorry!” She got up and stormed out after that. Castiel rubbed a hand over his face and sighed. He looked completely worn out and now Dean was feeling a little bad. As irrational as it felt, seeing as his kid’s the one who was beaten up, he figured it probably isn’t completely the guy’s fault that his daughter’s a nightmare.
Dean sighed, “You know, if you don’t fend for yourself they’ll just keep bullying you.”
Dean rehashed the bulk of what had been happening over the past couple months. To Castiel showing up at his door with a scowl and a bruised daughter, to the weirdness surrounding Dean’s sexual orientation, to Castiel’s hastily blurted out confession. When he was done, Jo sounded like she was holding back laughter.
“Yes! The whole nine.”
“What?” Dean’s eyes grew wide and his bottom lip hung low. “You’re joking, right?”
Dean grinned, knowing it was just pissing Castiel off even more. “First of all, I resent that,” he said, holding up a finger. “Secondly, you’re the one who raised a rabid dog who has some sick desire to pound on my kid. So, if either one of us is more of a parent, I know who I’d bet on.”
Castiel’s eyes narrowed in confusion, and he tilted his head in the most and completely un-adorable way. “What do you mean?”
“Okay. Not my finest parenting moment, but get this. She was being picked on for maybe-possibly-allegedly liking another girl and she was just taking all that anger out on Jack.”
Dean looked at him, watching as Castiel absorbed the movie’s intro, rather than watching it himself. It only took three minutes before Dean started laughing. “Come on, Cas. You gotta loosen up, man.”
“Uh, yeah,” Dean said, folding his arms over his chest. “You’re… wait. Novak?” He tilted his head and narrowed his eyes.
“Claire,” Castiel said with a sigh.
Dean cleared his throat and looked down at his coffee, “So, maybe we got off on the wrong foot.”
He was just making his way down Josh-Andy-Maverick’s neck to his chest when he heard his doorbell ring.
“Yeah, you keep saying that. What’s that all about?”
“Yes,” Jack nodded. “I know.”
“Claire,” Castiel said next. “It’s more than fair. Please apologize to Jack.”
“Dean,” Sam chided and Dean let out a deep sigh of defeat. He leaned forward and rested his elbows on his desk. One hand held the phone to his ear while his other hand rubbed over his face and scratched into his hair.
Castiel tilted his head up and kissed him, lingering there for a moment before he leaned back again with a crooked smile, “Good unexpected.”
“Yeah well, maybe. But, you’re my brother. I know you. There’s something on your mind. Spill.”
“I don’t need an apology. Dorkchester’s a wuss, he caught me off guard,” the little girl started saying.
Dean wasn’t sure why that made his stomach turn in disappointment, but it did. And hell, maybe he’d had too much cheese today. And even though he’s pretty sure he hadn’t had any dairy at all, and was vaguely aware that had nothing to do with the feeling, he chalked it up to it regardless. Then, the words flew out his mouth before he’d realized he was speaking, “You sure? I was just catching up with Shaggy and the gang when you rang.” He winced at how painfully uncool those words sounded, but didn’t make a move to take them back.
“No! No, nothing like that, just, if you’re free,” Dean squeezed his eyes shut. He hated how nervous he sounded.
It wasn’t that hard to find Castiel’s number. There weren’t too many Novaks in the yellow pages, and only one had a strange name like Castiel. The angel of Thursday. Dean had to look it up just to see if it wasn’t some made up word. Castiel was also the only one to pop up when he searched his name in Google. Which, Dean reassured himself, wasn’t for any reason other than curiosity. The guy was a history professor and a couple years older than Dean.
Dean laughed, “I don’t doubt that.”
“Who the hell are you?” Dean said with a slight nod and twist of his lips.
“I told him to defend himself. Obviously, Rosemary’s baby over there has a knack for lashing out,” Dean fired back. “And let’s not forget, my kid’s eye is still healing after your girl decided to take out her prepubescent angst on him.”
Castiel sighed and sagged his shoulders. “Come on, Claire,” he said and turned to open the door.
“Is something wrong?”
“Unzip me,” Castiel said, pushing his hips up and making Dean groan from the contact.
“Oh, how I miss seeing my Special K,” Dean joked with a smile as he walked around to sit next to his son.
Dean couldn’t help but laugh a little. He shook his head, “I’m not that old.”
Dean was losing the battle of keeping his hands to himself quite rapidly. Luckily (or unluckily) for him, he didn’t have to try so hard when the back door was suddenly pulled open. It knocked the sense right back into him.
“Okay, there’s sort of a guy,” Dean admitted.
“Apologize to him. Now.”
“Claire,” Castiel warned again, this time with a sharper tone. Claire rolled her eyes, but seemed to let it go for now.
Dean smiled and chuckled, “So, you saved my number, huh?” He wasn’t flirting, he told himself. He was just naturally charming, like Mrs. Karmichael said.
Jack didn’t answer, and all Dean could do was shake his head when he got to their door. Just then, he spotted an old continental pulling into his driveway. Dean hunched to drop Jack off his back, “Great. I almost forgot.”
By the time Castiel did show up, Dean’s mind was all out of sorts.
“Yes, I can see that now,” Castiel said and Dean couldn’t help but smile. Hell yeah he had a good kid. Not that he needed Castiel’s approval anyway, but still.
Castiel turned that smile on him and Dean felt for a very brief moment like he couldn’t breathe. “I very much enjoyed that,” he said with a small nod.
“You sure?” Dean asked, planting kisses on Castiel’s neck.
Castiel let out another deep breath, looked down at his daughter, then back at Dean, then said, “We’re going.”
“What would you know? You’re practically a hermit.”
“Later, old man,” she said, already bounding toward the car unbeknownst to the atmosphere.
Dean shook his head, “I’m not getting it.”
Dean sighed and leaned back into his couch. “Maybe you got a point,” he grumbled.
Dean laughed, “Good unexpected, or bad unexpected?”
His head was turned to the side, then he looked up, then down at his feet before he said, “Just here to collect Claire.”
“No, uh,” a bit of laughter slipped out, so Dean cleared his throat. “Nothing, you uh, you said that?”
“Well, what is it?”
“Black is fine,” Castiel said.
“Yeah, man! You gotta show that Novak kid that you’re not to be messed with,” Dean unfolded one arm and nudged Jack’s knee. “I’m not saying beat the kid up. But if he picks another fight with you, you gotta defend yourself.”
Jack peeked up at Dean and smiled a little, then back at his lap. He finally said, “What is a dyke?”
Dean cleared his throat and looked away, “Good. It’s uh… it’s a classic.” He lifted the remote and turned off the TV.
“Little girl, or as you call her, a rabid dog,” Castiel said, walking past Dean and sitting at the kitchen table.
Jack’s eyes narrowed and his head tilted in his confusion. “But you told me to fend for myself,” he said. “Isn’t that good?”
Jack was just staring down at his lap, eyes pinched like he was thinking. It was so strange, how smart and thoughtful the kid was at his age. Sometimes it made Dean wonder what kind of people his biological parents are or were. The kid had a brain that worked about fifteen years older than what he actually was. He’s had it since he was able to talk.
“What’s… Shaggy and the gang?” Castiel looked toward the living room, to the kitchen, then back at Dean. His eyes squinted, “Are they here?”
Kevin looked reluctant at first but conceded nonetheless, what else was he to do? "Yeah, man, I will. Have fun, dude," he ended with a smirk as he exited the room. Dean shook his head with a chuckle and a relieved sigh. He's been skeptical about allowing Ezekiel into Sam without his knowledge because, in his experience, nothing that's supposed to be good actually stays that way. For now, however, he has someone keeping vigilance while he is gone to see the man he loves.
"Yes, of course. He is one of my more eager students. You needn't worry about his performance," answered Castiel as he took an almost imperceptible step closer to Dean.
"Dean," gasped Castiel. "The witch is the man in front of you." Without question, he turned the gun to the real witch and shot. Immediately, the trio was able to breathe.
"Wow, Cas, I-I don't even know what to say." And he honestly didn't. What could be said to that anyway?
"Yeah. Good luck with that. The Knights of Hell aren't exactly the dying kind," Dean smiled darkly.
"Hey, who says I'm the bottom?!" Dean exclaimed loudly. He was met with an unimpressed look from the angel before him.
"I hate you right now," the Hunter said with indignation.
"Yes, while it lasted," he said bitterly.
"I don't care if Heaven gets back in order once the Angels are back there," stated Castiel.
"God, Cas, I'm so sorry for being so needy," Dean exhaled while running a trembling hand through his hair. The last week had taken its toll on him and he was running on caffeine alone. Now that he has talked with his lover, though, some of the jitters that racked through him have seemed to quell. Maybe he'll be able to sleep a little tonight if he can block out the screams coming from the dungeon.
what I mean," he finished before disappearing.
"We will, I just want to follow 'human tradition' first."
“Yes. I…I have done some awful things,” the man answers in a tone that would cause any heart to break.
"What is going on? Why are you talking like this?" asked Dean perplexed. What has gotten into the Angel? None of this is making sense. He found a solution to their Demon problem, and here he is being chewed out for it.
"Hurry, Dean. I cannot wait much longer," ground out Castiel impatiently.
"Seriously, you couldn't walk downstairs?"
Castiel can only look in disbelief at the man across from him, thinking of what he could say next. "I will tell you, Dean, that there is a price that comes with that mark. A price that I don't think you're aware you've paid, quite frankly."
"Dean. We need to be a world away from here-from him," Crowley intoned.
Castiel smirked before taking Dean's member into his hand and giving a few lazy tugs before kneeling before him. He gave a quick glance to Dean and smirked again at the debauched look on the cowboy's face before slowly taking Dean into his mouth.
"Answer me!"
"I didn't say that I don't love my dick of a brother. I love him more than anything, he's all I've got in this world, but I was done. He needs to let me go."
"And then?"
"Oh, yeah? And who's going to stop me?" he challenged.
Castiel pulled out and watched as Dean's hole clenched on nothing, the fluttering causing his lust to surge once more. "Your hole is so hungry for my cock, Dean." The man in question nodded furiously. The angel lined his member up and pushed in quickly only to pull out again. He could feel the frustration coming off the hunter in waves. He continued to tease Dean like this for several more thrusts. Pushing in just to immediately pull out. There was no thrill that equaled entering his lover and he was going to exploit it until neither of them could stand it anymore.
"I do what I want,
"That's up to you." Dean smiled around the other man's rapidly hardening cock. He was feeling particularly insatiable today, and he had been blessed with a partner that could make the human body do whatever he wanted. Castiel nodded and silently grabbed Dean's hair and began granting his beloved's wish.
"Samuel," Castiel stated firmly, "you know perfectly well that I cannot return. I will not risk your safety."
Sam has always been able to take care of himself, but Dean can't function on his own. He needed to be cared for, or he needed to be the one doing the caring. So, Sam is going to make sure that his brother and his lover reconcile even if he and his brother cannot. "I know Dean can be a dick, Cas, but I'm sure he'll come back around," Sam said in order to comfort the man in front of him.
"God! I need one, too. A double of whatever's the strongest."
"Yes, Sam?" sighed Castiel.
The sound of the slap hit Dean's ear before he realized he had just been spanked by Castiel. "No words, Dean. You are, however, still allowed to make noises."
Dean had to turn away from Ezekiel after he was given the ultimatum. It sucked that everyone knew his weakness. He couldn't bear the thought of Sam being completely taken over by Zeke and leaving if he let Castiel stay. The other scary thing was that the thought of asking Castiel to leave pained him just as much as the threat of Ezekiel leaving. He was being torn asunder and there was absolutely nothing he could do about it.
After a few more slaps to the ass in front of him, Castiel brought the panties down to right beneath Dean's cheeks. He had decided that Dean didn't deserve a barrier to take part of the shock. The first slap on bare skin made Dean cry out even louder. "Fuck, Daddy, that feels so good! Please don't stop," Dean sobbed. Several slaps of varying strength landed in different locations after the hunter's pleading. The one that made him cry out the hardest was the one that landed right on his hole.
"Who is the witch?" The hunter was nervously looking around the room at the different people.
Castiel took that as his cue to follow Dean into the bathroom which was almost ready. “We really should start getting our own room, Dean. It’s not fair that Sam has to disappear whenever we get intimate.”
“You should. He’s probably your biggest success. Next would be if you managed to dislodge your balls and actually call this guy.”
Sam laughed outright, “Nnnn—ooo,” he said mockingly. “The last time you sounded like this was ten years ago. Remember? When you were in the peak of your mid-midlife crisis and decided you wanted to dedicate your life to another human being.”
It was nice after that. Apart from having to awkwardly explain sex to Jack that night, things didn’t turn out too bad.
“A dyke,” Jack looked up again and now he was staring right into Dean’s eyes.
Dean pushed himself off the doorframe and called out, “Fine! I forgive you!”
“Hell yeah. We’ll just have to change her mind about you,” Dean smiled back and leaned forward to kiss Jack’s forehead. He got up after that and walked around to his desk. He still had a lot of work to do for the shop before he made the call he had in mind.
“Hello, Mr. Winchester. Fancy seeing you here again,” Mrs. Karmichael said. And though there was definitely sarcasm in her words, her tone was nothing but warm.
“Hi, old man,” she said. “I called daddy and he said I could come over after school.”
“Alright, just… come on,” Dean nodded for them to follow him inside. He could hear Claire protesting as they came in, but he ignored it in favor of approaching his son. “Jack,” he called and Jack promptly looked up with a smile.
“Very,” Dean answered. “Five… four… three…”
“Oh, it’s alright. There’s nothing like Kansas, though,” she said and Dean rolled his eyes.
“I don’t understand,” Castiel said, but Dean was already ushering him toward the couch.
“Cas,” Dean shifted forward, just an inch, and placed both his hands on Castiel’s shoulders. “I like you. Like, a lot. And it’s weird because I feel like I don’t really know you, but hell, I do. And if you don’t like me back, then tell me that now. But if you do, I’m going to kiss you. Okay? You have ten seconds to decide to push me away or not.”
Dean stretched his arms over his head once the credits were rolling and Castiel was still smiling. Dean looked over and raised a brow at the soft expression.
“Really? I pour my heart out to you and you’re laughing at me,” Dean said, though he couldn’t help the little smile of his own. At least she couldn’t see it.
“Trust me, I get it.” Dean looked down and nodded. “I actually had the balls to tell my dad I was gay and he practically gave me the silent treatment. Hell, if I know if he even cared about the bruises I came home with.”
"With pleasure," Castiel purred. He brings their lips together hungrily and tears at their clothes until there is nothing left between them. He pulls back from the kiss when he is out of breath but keeps their faces close enough so that they are breathing each other's air. The Angel rakes his blunt fingernails down his Hunter's chest until he is gripping Dean's member. He watches as the Winchester's pupils dilate further and he worries his lip with his teeth to hold back a moan. Castiel keeps a firm grip on the seat behind Dean's head as he positions himself over the erection in his hand. Just before seating himself, Dean grabs him by the waist and hoists him up a few inches.
"Oh yeah? And you just so happen to know?" Dean squints his eyes in disbelief.
The Angel pulled out all the stops and worked Dean until he could feel the hand gripping his head almost unbearably tight. Clue number one that Dean was close to coming. It was at this moment that the Angel shoved Dean back into his pants and made his way back to his seat. The incredulous look that was staring back at him did nothing to deter his happiness.
"All right, so...I'm going to get another room, see you in the morning."
"Sam?" comes the curious voice of the Angel.
Castiel teased his tongue on the area behind Dean's balls before taking them each in turn into his mouth. "Cas," Dean panted pathetically. He was unconsciously working the angel's fingers in and out of his hole in desperation. "Ba-baby, please," he pleaded.
"See, that worries me. What do you mean 'became a Demon'?"
"What the hell?! Why didn't you tell me?!" yelled Kevin when Dean finished his hurried recount.
“I don’t-…I don’t understand,” fumbled the angel in apparent confusion as if on cue from Sam's thoughts. He looked to Dean, as always, and he was met with a lustful gaze and blushing cheeks. The shorter man squinted his eyes.
"Yeah. It's right next to mine. I even put stuff in here from the storage that reminded me of you or I thought might interest you," replied Dean with a nervous cough.
It was a good thing that he wasn't looking up when he revealed these things to Dean because he would have seen the exact moment that his brother's heart skipped a beat and broke a little.
Seeking closeness, Dean leaned forward so that their foreheads were touching and he brought up a hand to meet the one Cas was still holding to his cheek. "How are we gonna do this, Cas? Wanna take things slow? Or-"
"Is...is this the verbal version of the puppy eyes?" Sam could almost see the squint-head-turn thing Castiel does when confused or suspicious.
have no qualms about doing so," retorted Crowley.
“That is much better, pet. Now, your real punishment begins.”
"Y-yeah. I did," the hunter answered hesitantly.
"If at any point we do something you are not comfortable with, Dean, I would like to remind you that your safe word is Impala."
"Want me where, Castiel?" Dean asked as continued to push the other man's knees closer to his chest.
"Alright, Agatha...I'll take you up on that offer."
"A man betrayed by the man he loves. That is who the 'fuck' I know I am," growled the Angel. He was seething now. He has never felt so angry or betrayed in his life. How could Dean do this? Has he not learned
"Goodnight, Sam."
Castiel, on the other hand, tries his best to keep from smiling. He is purposely trying to get on Dean's nerves for selfish reasons. It is definitely giving him a gratifying feeling that it's working, and he plans on having Dean eating from the palm of his hand by the end of the evening. A month away from a lover is never easy and while he can understand Dean's want for human tradition, he wishes that the hunter had waited until after they fornicated. Now that he has partaken of the forbidden fruit, he seeks to indulge himself. Often. Gluttony may be a sin, but what weight does Hell hold on a being that has lived for countless millennia as a harbinger of Celestial Justice?
“Oh," he gasped in surprise. Well, that won't do. "I’m sorry, Daddy,” Dean whispered. The shiver did not go unnoticed by Castiel.
"Who the hell's Dean?" he asked.
Dean was getting ready to cancel the weekend with Castiel until he remembered that he never told Kevin about Ezekiel which, oops, might be a good thing to inform him of now. He let out the breath he had been holding and hurriedly brought Kevin up to speed.
"The only room available was the one next to you guys, and I forgot my noise cancelling headphones at the bunker," Sam growled. "Goddamned thin walls. Heard shit I never wanted to hear in my life." He handed his brother coffee and slammed the door before presumably going back to his room to wait. Dean stood there in shock.
. But I don't know if I can forgive you for what are about to become. Even for the sake of the you that took me five years to fix."
Before Castiel could continue reminiscing about a time so many years ago, he was interrupted by an awkward cough.
Meanwhile, by the time Sam understood what Dean had meant, he wished he had brain bleach. "God, Dean! I was only joking! Cas didn't tell me anything! Fuck! I soooooooo didn't need to know that about my brother," said Sam in a rush all the while rubbing his eyes as if the action would erase the image he has of his brother now.
"What did you do, Cas?" the other man asked in shock.
"Because," began Castiel as he put his had behind Dean's head, "I've never heard that word said in that particular drawl of yours; it is sending my libido reeling. And one more thing, if I may."
"I didn't either, actually," Dean chuckled nervously, "I just found a piece of wood and some carving tools and kind of just went at it."
"Jesus, Dean, you've been in out of it for days, man. What is it?" asked the boy.
“Who are you?” asked Dean to the dainty ginger figure at the door.
Let me know what you think! Reviews are love. I do have a question, if there was a way for me to fit into the story for Castiel to get his Grace back...would you want him to? I'm leaning towards no, but I want to know what you guys think :) I'll have another chapter up ASAP!
"Also, you're going to need to buy underwear 'cause I've got to draw the line somewhere, dude," Dean chuckles as he turns out of the room.
"Whoa! Stop!
"Oh, no," he spoke as the two men watched a figure walk from behind the house. "We need to leave here now," the Demon hissed in undertone.
"Wouldn't dream of leaving, Cas. Just...don't leave tomorrow without saying goodbye."
Sam shot his brother a shocked look but before he could say anything, he saw Castiel's demeanor change...he thinks it's about time he showed himself out. He's got a week before the essay is due anyway. He slowly backs away and takes Baby with him to the local bar to try to clear his mind. The other two men had already forgotten Sam's presence.
"You're coming with me," Dean grunted as he hastily undid the cuffs holding the Demon in place.
"I've been chasing that blade for decades," Crowley interjected. "The closest I got to it was when one of my droogs-Smitty-got wind of a protege demon of Abaddon's who claimed knowledge of the blade. Sadly," he added, "before Smitty could nab the guy, a hunter by the name of John Winchester nabbed the protege. I was wondering if there is anything in the John Winchester Memorial Library that might lead us to the first blade-to killing Abaddon."
Dean growled as he brought their lips together again. Castiel took that opportunity to push Dean away from him so he could stand and push him down onto the desk. "What're you doing, angel?" the green eyed man asked in confusion.
"Well," the Demon scoffed. "I came by to give you the good news."
"So have I, Dean, and if you can find it within you to forgive me, then I must forgive myself and forgive you just the same. We cannot absolve ourselves other than through accepting and giving forgiveness."
"Kevin, what the hell?!" exclaimed Dean.
"Really, Dean, you listen to Cas, but not your own brother?" Sam growled.
"Wow, Dean, we haven't done something that childish in forever, man," gasped Sam still laying on the floor.
"Umm...yeah sure," answered the waitress with an air of uncertainty. "I'll be back in a few."
Dean smirked before continuing at a faster pace than before, making sure to hit that same place within Castiel.
He knew he should have warded the room.
things to yourself?! Just who the FUCK do you think you are?!"
Without so much as a glance towards his lover’s sibling, Castiel brought himself to loom over Dean and stated in a voice that brooked no argument, “Get another room, Sam. Do not dawdle.” The two men continued staring at each other as they heard Sam scrambling to grab his things without a complaint. The second that the door slammed, Dean was placing a hand behind the angel’s head to bring him in for a searing kiss.
"Hm," pondered Malachi as he looked at Castiel. "Wasn't expecting that. Probably should have fed him or something. It's so easy to forget how susceptible you pesky little humans can be," he chuckled.
"There is nothing that I could say that would change what you have already planned to do to me," answered Castiel in falsely even tone. If he was being truthful, he was terrified of what his siblings had in store for him. Angels were craftier than Demons.
"You are so fucking pretentious, you know that?" Dean angrily exclaimed. "First, you won't tell me why the fuck I couldn't remember
"Like Eden? Adam and Eve? Wasn't that Lucifer?" Dean asked for clarity's sake. He's never been to Sunday School, but he knows that much at least.
"I will take that as a yes," chuckled Castiel. "Could you get on your hands and knees for me, beloved?" whispered Castiel into his ear. When Dean didn't immediately acquiesce, Castiel firmly gripped the jaw of his lover to regain his attention. Lowering his voice, Castiel looked into Dean's eyes and commanded, "I
"Alright-
"I don't know, man...doesn't he seem a little weird to you?"
"First, I would really, really like to kiss you," Castiel breathed against plump lips.
Dean scoffed and everyone practically heard his eyes roll. “Whatever, Dad,” he responded sarcastically as he made no move to go to bed.
"Good boy." Dean shivered at the moniker. That was a kink he never wanted to think about because he knew it was testament to the shitty childhood he had in which he was never praised, so now it does things to him. One look at Castiel told Dean that he knew already what that praise did to him. "Open your mouth."
"If the situation were reversed, you mean you wouldn't do the same?" Castiel asked dreading the answer.
The odd pair make their way out of the bar. Just as they step through the door, the man Crowley had eyed, turned towards a few others scattered throughout the place, and gave a signal before he walked out into the night as well.
"You may."
Dean returns to his task and takes Castiel into his mouth. Immediately he feels hands in his hair, gripping almost too tight. He uses his tongue as a distraction for what his fingers are doing.
The following morning, Charlie is barking out orders for Sam and Kevin when Castiel finally decides to come out of his bedroom. His own this time, Dean's has been soiled by far too many things for him to actually lay in it anymore.
The hunter heard a gasp and almost inaudible sob on the other end of the line.
“Dean, what are you doing?”
“It’s not like I can tattle on you without mom and dad around. Besides, I’d never play a prank on you now!”
Every kid raised their hands and yelled, “Me! Me!” I smiled at their enthusiasm. The chaperone in the back chuckled to himself and his eyes glimmered with something mysterious.
“What does this have to do with singing poorly to popular songs, Dean? And that’s a lie, I know for a fact you love-”
From the back of the small crowd, one of the chaperones unintentionally caught my attention. He was making a boy’s shoulders shake with stifled laughter by wiggling his fingers above his head.
Castiel’s childish stubbornness entertained Dean to no end.  “You are my last customer today, you could probably stay the night. However, I don’t think this table is a good substitute for a bed.”
“Castiel.”
A quiet knock sounded at the door sometime later. “Mr. Novak?” A nurse entered with a clipboard, looking far too bright-eyed for my taste. “Ah, you’re awake! That’s wonderful. How do you feel?”
Castiel thought for a moment, weighing his options. Dean was writing him a blank check. He could ask for something really good.
Cas’ skeptical smile wavered at the corners like he didn’t know whether to fight it or not. The “games” Dean generally proposed were usually unfair and ended one of two ways: with fun sexy times or with exhausted naps, often times both. Either way, Castiel ended up desperate and panting somehow, and lately, it seemed Dean had become especially fond of these games. Castiel didn’t know how much more he could take.
“What?! Cas…”
I’d have to do research before I go anywhere to see if the place is wheelchair friendly. In fact, I’d have a hard time going anywhere that doesn’t have fucking ramps and door buttons. I would have to relearn how to navigate the entire world. Doors would be closed that were never a problem before. And the world was going to look at me and see a burden, an obstacle, or worse, an invalid.
“That sounds reasonable,” Cas smiled fondly. “Shall we get started then?”
“Hah, come on, Cas. I’m not that stupid. Guess again.”
Dean was the one subject to temptation. But today was evidence that Dean could control himself. He got to keep his new client and get to know him more. He couldn’t wait to discover new things each time they were together. And maybe someday, they could even become more than this. Dean wasn’t sure what he was looking for from Castiel, but he knew he was special. Dean wasn’t one to let that sort of chance get away from him.
The angel shook his head and met Dean's quizzical look with a wide-eyed caught-with-his-hand-in-the-cookie-jar look. "Like what you see?" Dean teased with a wiggle of his hips, his half hard cock swinging unabashedly across his lower abdomen. He brought up his knees and spread them a little, intending to give a view of his hole; however, the position he was in made that difficult without the use of his hands. Castiel still gasped at the motion though.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I love you, Cas," said Dean through a yawn.
"What do those numbers in the margin mean?" the Demon asked pointedly. He is not going to allow the Hunter to hold out on him on such an important case.
First, there was the tragedy of Mary Winchester's death, followed by the catastrophe that was Dean's upbringing. He cringed in disgust at each piece of stolen innocence that Dean had to endure for the sake of finding his mother's killer. If Castiel could have had his way he would have paid John a visit and instilled the fear of God into him. It was unfair the way that Dean and his brother had to experience a life that was beyond tragic, and he had to sit back and watch as Dean was left to be a father to his brother. The Angel had to lament for the fact that Dean was left without much guidance but for the sporadic intervention of Bobby. There was constant apprehension and sorrow in Castiel's actions for much of Dean's life, but the day that the Hunter had lost his little brother was one that tugged at his heart strings.
"No. Because in doing so, he has condemned his soul to demonization," the Angel explains. There is a moment of silence before the news sinks in.
When he finally made his way down to the dungeon, it was to find Dean bickering with Crowley.
Dean can't hold back anymore and punches him. That smarmy dick's death has been on delay for way too fucking long. Crowley's talent seems to be in always making sure he is relevant, and it drives Dean insane. The taller man cannot wait for the day that he gets to rip the Demon a new one.
"Dean, we are both free of STDs, I regularly give you a checkup, and I would rather feel you uninhibited."
"We learned some things about you though, didn't we, darlings?" teased Rowena. "For starters you were very sweet to everyone. I was completely unaware you were capable of gentility. It says a lot about your life, I think." The witch's smile did nothing but grate on Dean's nerve. "You were especially sweet on your handsome little angel here when he swaggered in to come to your rescue."
After Rowena dispatched one of the witches, there was still one more to contend with, and he was currently holding them all hostage. There was no one they could rely on, except for Dean, but he wasn't in his right mind. Just as Castiel was starting to lose consciousness, he heard the one voice he was hoping not to hear.
He drops his bags over by the bed and turns around to see Castiel nervously sitting on the edge of the bed. "What's wrong. sweetheart?" he asks. Dean doesn't miss the subtle shiver that racks through his lover and internally smirks.
Castiel gasped in horror when he saw the mark. He tossed the arm away from himself, and backed away shaking his head. He didn't say anything until Dean repeated his previous question.
Just as he is about to answer Rowena there is another knock at the door. The three occupants of the room look to one another in confusion.
. It figures that Castiel would make it here first. He was going to turn around before he was stopped by Castiel's answer.
"I don't know. I like get a flash of something and then I snap out of it and then I can't remember what the hell I just saw. Fuck, I haven't slept in four days, but I've got to find Cas."
"And how do I know this isn't a trap?" asked Dean with trepidation. He's had too much bad luck recently, and he would rather not add to it.
“It’s a little difficult to explain, dude. Just go to sleep.” He knew resistance was futile when it came to Castiel stubbornly wanting to know something, but he really didn’t want to have this conversation with his brother in the room.
In his own room, Dean is restlessly tossing and turning, his stomach in knots. A part of him wants to be selfish for the both of them but the part of him that doesn't want to deal with the aftermath is keeping him glued to his bed. His window of opportunity is closing quickly and here he is being a coward.
"My room?" Castiel asks tentatively as he slowly walks into the room.
“Is he always this annoying? Whatever his name is?”
"You don't understand, Sam, I've been in love with that idiot for thousands of years," his voice cracked. He turned teary eyes to the younger Winchester. "And I mean that in the literal sense. I jus-what do I do now? I don't know anything else." Sam offered the Angel a shoulder to lean on as consolation. Sometimes there isn't much one can do other than to physically be there for those in need.
"They're beautiful," said the Angel as he caressed the face of the figure representative of Dean. He turned to find the Hunter standing directly behind him and his breath caught in his throat.
In answer, the seraph brought their lips together once more and allowed himself to get lost on the taste of the two of them together. He could only groan in satisfaction. Soon, he was laying kisses down towards perky nipples that were mercifully sensitive and he lost who knew how long teasing them to the point of oversensitivity. Then he continued to map his way down Dean's torso, pausing to lave attention at Dean's soft middle. A perfunctory lick down his cock and balls and Castiel was looking up at green eyes full of anticipation. The seraph grabbed a pillow to lift Dean's hips to a better angle and he spread freckled cheeks and was mesmerized by the delicate pink hole before him.
"What did you hear?" He may as well resign himself to the fact that he had a lot of explaining to do.
"That's not funny, Dean, my ears are sensitive," Castiel stated sternly.
"Son of bitch didn't think we were clever enough to melt down Angel blades into bullets," chuckled Dean earning a smile from Castiel. "Come on, let's get outta here before the police show up," grunted Dean as he stood up.
"I can't, Dean. Because I would have to lie to you," he whispered.
"Cas," he croaked. "I said I wanted to be alone." Dean angrily yanked his hand from Castiel's grip when he didn't say anything. "Did you fucking hear me?!"
"You just signed your death wish, asshole. I'm gonna find you and I'm gonna kick your ass so hard you're gonna wish Daddy was home to kiss your boo-boos. And if you know who I am, you know that I keep my promises. Just ask Zach! Oh wait-I stabbed him in his face." By now, Dean's gravelly tones had garnered the attention of Crowley and Kevin. Dean held up a finger asking for silence before either could inquire. "Now, listen to me. You're going to let Cas go-"
Dean's breath hitched the moment he'd been manhandled into position. He was immediately reminded of those times when he'd pissed off the man in front of him enough to elicit being pushed against walls. It always sent a shiver down his spine if he's being honest. Dean could only stare down at the cerulean eyes before him that were beginning to lose the battle to lust. "And how do you know what I have and haven't done, Castiel?" Dean whispered.
"Good thing I wasn't talking about Heaven," she smirked.
"Sam, it's my job as your big brother to make sure that you get the best of everything, ok? If that means I gotta work my ass of doin' shit I ain't so proud of, then so be it. So long as you get to do what you want and get to be good at it, that's all I can ask for my efforts, alright? Now wipe that guilty look off your face before I punch it off," said Dean sternly. He knows he's being hard on him but he needs Sam to understand that he'd do whatever it takes to make sure he does something worthwhile with his life, and he sure as hell doesn't need to see that guilty expression every time. It'll break him eventually. "*Ahem* So anyway, Sammy, how about you show me all the stuff you been doin'; where your classes are, maybe some of your hot teachers, too," finishes Dean with a suggestive tone and waggle of his eyebrows.
After the two men hung up, Sam made his way to the kitchen where he could hear that his brother was still cooking. Walking in through the door, Sam inhaled the heavenly scent of a stew boiling away on the stove. Dean was facing the cupboard on the other side of the room with a pensive look on his face, and the younger Winchester slowly made his way to the pot and grabbed the spoon. After sticking it into the stew and bringing it to his lips, he could feel an angry glare beating on the side of his face. He hadn't heard his brother move closer, but he wasn't giving Dean the satisfaction of knowing that.
"Holy fuuuck," the taller man breathed.
“Color,” he inquired.
The younger Winchester looked around confused before settling on his brother's face. "Dean? I-I...I don't know if I'm ok," Sam mumbled as he gently pushed his brother away from himself and stood to walk past everyone.
"Hello, Dean," said Castiel with a small smile as he closes the door behind him.
"To be quite frank with you, beloved, I feel we have taken things quite slow enough." And boy, was he not lying. They're creeping up on a decade of knowing each other. "In fact," he continued, "if we take things any slower, I'm not sure either of our cocks will be able to function anymore without any supplements."
They watch the stars for almost an hour, pointing at different constellations and sharing anecdotes, then Cas starts closing his eyes a little too frequently and Dean forces himself to call it a night.
He needs a distraction.
“I know the place but not which way to go from your house, Cas” he laughs “you’ll have to guide me.”
“Looks like nothing’s out of place here. I should take a look under her. Bring her inside?”
“You heard the boss!” and with that Kevin takes off, leaving him standing in the middle of the kitchen like an idiot.
?” her face is suddenly in his line of sight, and oh, she looks shocked and proud at the same time. Weird.
There's no reason he can't ride the doc-
“You’re a menace to yourself, Dean Winchester!”
Dean is very confused.
“That’s your problem. The gas pedal can’t go lower because the mat is stuck. You can’t go faster because the pedal can’t go lower.”
It's Cas who talks first.
It’s routine work and he actually relaxes with the familiar movements for a while. He’s almost done with the cleaning when he feels something soft and hot rubbing on his gloved fingers. Castiel’s breath stops for what feels like ten minutes when he realizes it’s Dean’s tongue.
He won’t go to the next appointment and he’ll have to look for another dentist.
“Anytime, Cas. Now,
would happen or what could happen next time!”
“Yes, I see that.”
Doctor Castiel Novak with blue eyes, dark hair and the most beautiful pair of thighs he’s ever seen (the stool the Doctor sits on is basically in his face, sue him), looks very hot in his white lab coat.
so Dean's pretty happy with that.
“That is- none of your business. And frankly gross when you’re the one saying it.”
He knows that Dean likes to joke and that he finds most of Castiel’s attempt at being funny hilarious; he know that the other man is very proud of his and his
Was the tongue-sucking comment what made him like that?
“Good, I… I’ve been thinking of holding your hand since the other day at the garage…”
Still, he needs to tell someone about this, so he takes his phone and sends a quick message to Charlie.
“Really? Didn’t peg you for a romantic, Cas.”
Cas had texted him almost immediately after getting home that day, and they had spent the following days texting as much as they could.
"Dean…"
After Dean’s mouth is open again, Castiel takes the saliva ejector, removes the tip to have a better suction and starts aspirating the excess of saliva near the molars he’s treated last time. He’s in the middle of the examination and very concentrated on it when his hand slips a little and the saliva ejector ends up sucking Dean’s tongue, without him noticing.
stare.
“It can, but I’m happy you’re not. I want to show you a place.”
“Y-yeah Cas, very okay.”  he will deny the blush on his face until the day he dies.
“What, you’re already tired of seeing me?” Castiel tries to go for mock-offended but maybe having half his face covered doesn’t help since Dean looks terrified for a second.
to commit seppuku. I can’t keep living like this, it’s either that or I’m digging a hole and burying myself in it!” he knows he doesn’t make any sense but Baby’s steering wheel has had enough of his head banging on it, so he needs to talk to someone.
They’re both smiling as soon as they see each other, and the doctor wastes no time in climbing into Baby.
“Is this okay?”
He mumbles a quick “If you need something else just call me” and walks away, going for the storage room. As the door closes behind him, he leans on it. This is going to be a long night.
During the drive back to his apartment, Cas thanks Dean again for he beautiful night and when they're parked again under the building, none of them wants to leave.
Castiel is so very tired of his car.
“No, I fear
Castiel is impressed. He didn’t expect to have a short lesson on beers, but seeing Dean talking about a topic with such confidence makes him wonder if there’s something this man can’t do.
Turns out, six days are not enough to freak out. Or maybe they’re too much.
The frustrated groan coming from Meg surprises Castiel, that was not the reaction he expected. He sits up, watching his friend curiously.
Cas scoots closer again, resting his head on Dean’s shoulder.
“That’s not what I wanted to say. I wanted to apologize for being an ass. I know you three are just trying to help, I shouldn't make it harder for you all by being such an assbutt. I just don’t know how to stop.”
The man is hunched under the hood of a black vintage car. Castiel tries to not look, but those bowlegs covered by well worn and stained jeans look familiar and that ass is definitely
He ducks his head faster than ever, turns his back on them, and keeps clearing the table very slowly, he can’t have them sitting at one of his tables. Once he feels it’s safe to walk away he brings the tray with the dirty dishes into the kitchen and goes back behind the counter, subtly scanning the room to see where the doctor and the missus are sitting.
will.”
Castiel wills his dirty mind to not interpret that invite in any other way than a friendly drive around the neighborhood.
"As you said, it doesn't surprise me."
“No Cas, no dice. You gotta try it, you’ll never be the same after, I swear. C’mon, at least one bite, for me?” he takes a forkful and extends his hand to the doctor, to feed him, batting his eyelashes exaggeratedly.
“Keep watching the screen like that and you’ll need a new laptop, Clarence.”
“Are you a mechanic?”
“Don’t worry, Ken Doll, I’m not offended. I would’ve been happy to be his wife, if he wasn’t gay.” Meg winks at Dean, who stares at her with wide eyes and laughs uncomfortably before bowing away.
“Charlie, do you know if Jo has a tanto in her blades collection?”
4:50 PM arrives and Castiel is on edge. His ears were eager to catch Dean’s voice and only a couple of minutes later they did. The man isn’t very quiet.
“Order for table 14 ready in...?” Dean asks as he walks into the kitchen.
"I dunno Doc, you're the one that wanted us to have dinner together."
“If you don’t want to share there’s no need to add pickles, Clarence. Fine, I’ll have the mushroom one, Hot Stuff, and an iced tea.” she smiles sweetly but to Dean it looks like she's aiming for the jugular. He decides then and there that he doesn’t like her, at all.
“With your most charming smile. He’s a dentist, right? He must like your smile!”
“We got bacon and blue cheese, mushrooms with sautéed onions and swiss cheese, then cheddar, lettuce and tomato.”
He calls Kevin over, and orders two slices of pecan pie. The doctor says he’s too full, but Dean insists, this pie is to die for and he was promised pie, so he’s not backing off.
Castiel just lets out a breath and goes looking for his surgical cap and mask, and puts them on. Then he washes his hands again in the small sink in the corner and, after drying them thoroughly, reaches for the gloves’ box. He finds it empty and groans in frustration. He’s forced to use the gloves he normally uses for kids, since they’re flavored and usually that is enough to have them relax.
“Fuck, Cas.” Gabriel reached out to pet Castiel’s head affectionately, but Castiel turned away. He grimaced sadly. “I’m sorry I wasn’t here sooner. What happened?”
Sam was not convinced in the slightest. “He’s not a toy, Dean. You know it’s a bad idea to get involved with a client.”
Despite his doubts, Castiel still hoped he could return. He wasn’t ready to let go of his dream yet.
“You mean when you would play horrible pranks on me and blame me for anything that we got caught doing?” I smirked.
Dean nodded once and shut his lips, kissing the finger lying there. Cas smiled sweetly and turned his attention back to discovering Dean’s body. To say this was not what Dean expected would be an understatement. While it was sexy, this wasn’t about sex at all. He couldn’t quite wrap his head around the experience, but it was definitely about connection, Dean thought. Even though Cas was the one doing the poking around, Dean felt like he was discovering Cas in equal measure. Regardless of what it was or wasn’t, Dean liked this. He liked it a lot.
“Now then, I could give you a list of all the options, and then you can pick whichever sounds the best. Or, I could make a suggestion.”
“All I’m asking is for a chance to do what I want. Whatever I want without question or complaint. I don’t mean anything painful, of course, I just want to learn your body, to explore, if you will.”
“Oh” a beat. “
“That’s perfect. Thank you Dean. Alright, let’s see if you’re being a good patient” Castiel takes a dental mirror and starts prodding around Dean’s mouth, pushing aside his tongue to take a better look.
“Take a picture, it’ll last longer Sammy.”
A couple of hours later a car slowly pulls up and Dean hears Bobby swear and mutter “The idjit’s here again” he turns his head enough to see a golden old car parking, but he doesn’t care about the driver so he just ducks back under Baby’s hood.
He totally doesn’t wonder why Novak’s fiancée/wife calls him Clarence.
Dean is so immersed into work that if it wasn’t for his giant baby brother coming in at 1 PM he would have ended up having lunch at 3 PM, or entirely skipping it.
“What’s going on?”
Dean Winchester was beautiful inside and out. And he wanted to know more about him, in any way the other man would have him.
“Dean, you know I love you and you can come here whenever you need, and I’ll gladly listen to your very important musings without complaining, but you barged in as I was getting ready to go out on a date, so why don’t you tell me what you did this time before I tell Jo
So the doctor is gay. Fine. Totally fine. It’s a nice piece of information. Good to know, right? What could he possibly gain from knowing this?
and I might take you on a ride.”
That makes him stop putting away the records in the file cabinet. He knows he doesn’t have any dinner ready at home and those burgers are the best in town, anything he could whip up by himself can’t compare to one of those burgers. Damn, Meg does know how to convince him.
Dean dies a little when he sees that Cas is wearing tight dark jeans, a dark grey shirt with the sleeves rolled up (motherfucker has sexy forearms, how’s that fair?) and a couple of buttons left open, and there’s a leather jacket on his lap.
The car digression helps him to not think about the embarrassment of what happened and he stays there, trying to remember if Gabe has talked about cars recently, until Meg knocks on the door and swings it open without waiting for an answer.
“Eating, thanks Jo.”
“Well, hopefully you won’t have any other bad to- experiences. Here. I think we’re done? Yes, everything’s good. Alfie, give Mr. Winchester a glass of water to rinse his mouth, if he wishes. Dean, there’s no new cavities and the ones we’ve treated are perfect, but you should floss more, there’s some plaque building up and we don’t want that to become tartar. I’ll see you in a couple of months for another checkup. It was a pleasure. Goodbye, Dean.”
Three steading breaths later he’s got his notepad in his hand and is walking to the Novaks table, repeating himself
” as he looks up.
But he’s getting too nervous, so he reasons that he could get stuck in traffic so getting out of the house right now is a good idea. He applies a fresh coat of deodorant and checks his reflection in the mirror one last time as he wears the shirt. He looks good, he can do this.
Turns out Cas was actually interested in what an interior designer does and Dean was more than happy to explain and show off some of his favorite projects. The doctor wasn’t stingy on compliments and Dean relished in them, proud of his own accomplishments.
“Yeah, Doc, I'll keep my teeth tartar free.”
“Sure, yeah, I promise I won’t keep you hostage.”
“You? What happened? You finally told him you have the hots for him and he told you to back off?”
My gaydar is strong, Handmaiden.
His face has a couple of dark grease streaks, but that somehow doesn’t diminish the fact that the man is very handsome. His hands move surely from one part to another, what they are doing is completely lost on Castiel but they’re fascinating to watch, so he does.
“Good. Gotta keep you on your toes. So, where to?” with a smooth manoeuvre he’s once again on the road.
More than the half-assed attempt at… something that this attack was, is the use of his name and not Clarence that gets him. Shit, he’s really being insufferable.
“I can never show my face in there again!”
He takes it, and Castiel feels every callus in Dean’s hand. He also feels his warmth and how nice it is to have it wrapped around his own. He indulges just for a second to fantasize how it would be to have this hand caressing his own body, then snaps back to reality and hauls Dean up. He sees his eyes grow bigger at that, but it’s so quick that he’s not sure he really saw it. And it doesn’t matter all that much when they end up closer than it’s appropriate. With a step back he lets go of the other man’s hand.
“I was joking too, Dean” he says more softly “please, open up again. Alfie, saliva ejector, please.”
He knows that's Bobby's way of saying he approves whatever this thing is. He probably thinks he'll get a discount on his dental work for his involvement anyway.
“Dean.” his friend sighs his name like an exasperated mother “Were you to the dentist today?” he groans a “yes” and to his surprise Charlie doesn’t laugh.
“Yeah, with the saliva ejector. My hand slipped and it landed on his tongue, hence… his tongue was sucked.”
“What? Why?” Sam looks confused and
“Are you sure you’re just not treating
Then, because he’s a man of his word, he does his best to show the doctor what a good tongue-sucking feels like.
Shit, it was.
Fuck. Okay.
“No, I just sucked his tongue. And likely said some things that out of context sound…. Bad, if Alfie trying not to laugh is any indication.”
never treated me well. I think
I like things to be cute and romantic.”
"I thought your forte was using your tongue."
Dean is still
They keep eating, drinking and talking, and before they both know it, it’s already 9 PM.
Dean snorts, shoving him a little but tightening his grip on the other man's shoulder immediately after. He doesn't want Cas to fall off (and ruin Baby's paint).
He gets the cooler, loads it with beer and puts it in Baby’s trunk, with his grease-stained clothes. He’ll never risk staining Baby’s seats so he’ll just change in the shop’s bathroom.
“Here ya go, Doc. Car’s good as new.”
Dean notices that Novak glared at the brunette, but stayed silent. He doesn’t understand what’s happening, but that’s not his job. He shakes his head and tries to remember the food he could suggest to her.
“Fine, Clarence, I’ll leave you alone! Let me know if he calls you
“You sure you need to sleep?” he surprises himself with the roughness of his own voice.
“We’d love to eat, Ken Doll. Do you have burgers without pickles?”
It’s been a while since their last call, some days after Dean’s second appointment to the dentist, and way longer since he stepped into the shop, and he misses it.
When he’s ready he turns again and finds the chair already almost horizontal and the paper towel on Dean’s chest, so he just sits on his stool, adjusting his pants as subtly as he can before getting closer to Dean.
They talk while he parks the car and unloads the bags of groceries. One of the first things he does is to ask Bobby if one of these days he can pop by and get some work done on Baby. They both know he doesn’t need to go down there, because he’s got all he needs in his own garage, but there’s a difference between doing it at home alone and doing it in the shop with Bobby, having a beer together.
“We can’t have a second date at the Roadhouse, Cas!” he laughs, breaking eye contact to shake his head.
After all, he should live a little. But how can you live a little if you don’t
“See you tomorrow, melwa.”
’s the one who’s slowly killing his car?” Dean smiles, cleaning his hands in a dirty rag and walking towards them. Castiel doesn’t know how to feel about the shop’s owner gossiping about him and his car.
“You sayin I’m an alcoholic, Cas?” Dean’s eyes have a mischievous glint in them, but his expression is mostly serious.
“You’re- you got another appointment?” suddenly disbelieving-Charlie sounds a lot like disbelieving-Sam and Dean makes a mental note to limit the time those two are spending together.
“So… this is you.”
He picks up his burger and starts eating, glowering at it. And thinks.
First of all, how do you know? Second of all, DUDE I KNEW IT!!!!
Dean grabs a notepad and a pen, putting them inside the apron’s pocket, and looks around the tables he’s been assigned to. He sees the couple on 11 is still eating, the groups on 13 and 15 have their glasses still full, and the family on 10 just sat down, so he decides to man the bar for a couple of minutes before approaching them. Meanwhile Jo and Kevin, the part-time-waiter-full-time-genius-kid, walk in and out of the kitchen, Ellen must be running around like crazy in there.
“So he’s smart, not just a doll. Yes, Hot Stuff, it’s Meg. I’m a doctor too, you know? I wear a lab coat just like dear old Clarence here. Next time you’re at the clinic you should come say hi and take a look!” the glint in her eyes is mischievous and something about it doesn’t sit well with Dean. He doesn’t like it.
“It’s not a hot date! He’s a patient, like everyone else!” Castiel blushes while going outside of his small study and into the bathroom to wash his hands, just to have something to do.
“No we’re good, I got it. Go work, Joanna Beth.”
“Live a little, Clarence. It’s been so long since Mick that you don’t remember how to flirt?”
Castiel decides to wait in the dental chair’s room, under the pretense of supervising Alfie’s work with setting the right equipment (Alfie takes offense on that, he is more than capable of arranging a dental mirror and a couple of scrapers that he’ll have to sterilize again even if they end up unused). Then, Hannah leads Dean in and he sits on the chair without being prompted.
"I don't want to know, thank you."
Kevin arrives at that moment with the beers, some peanuts, olives and chips, and disappears after reassuring them that the burgers will be out shortly.
Saturday arrives quickly.
The weekends he speds hanging out with Gabriel, Meg and Balthazar are forced onto him because Gabriel can’t take no for an answer, and Meg and Bal live to give him a hard time.
She walks away and finally, they’re alone.
“Cas. Give me your phone.”
They drive out of town, just a couple of miles to let the city lights well behind them, until they reach a meadow with sparse trees and tons of flowers. Dean is not an expert but he recognizes poppies even in the dark. He parks on the side of the highway and stops the car.
But it’s okay, he won’t freak out.
“I’ll let you know what I come up with, Doc.”
Dean stares at her, mouth hanging open like a fish, he doesn’t even have the time to say something because Novak is immediately shooting daggers at his friend and leaning on the table.
“Yeah, what can I do for you… Meg, right?”
“Meg, what are you trying to prove here? Hm? What do you
“So uh- I need to finish a couple of things with Baby…”
It’s probably late, but he feels like a dick now. He ponders if he should apologize to his friends, because it’s definitely long overdue.
“That was some good tongue-sucking.”
“Don’t be stupid, Clarence. I did not know he works here, I just saw him last week with Bal, as a customer, and I figured there was a high chance to find him here. Not working. Aren’t you happy you saw him in that cute little apron? Sauntering away? Those are nice bowlegs…” she makes an appreciative noise, and something twists inside Castiel.
“Right, right, sure! I’ll just- are you sure you don’t want any kind of compensation?”
He’s glad to be put to work though, he likes working at the Roadhouse. Most of the regulars know him either because they were around when he worked the counter during college or because after he graduated and got a better paying job as interior designer he himself became one of the regulars.
“He must think I’m an idiot, that’s what!”
“No Dean, I don’t think that’s possible.” he says it with such fondness that his own heart squeezes a bit.
What he said it’s not necessarily a lie, but he’s been failing spectacularly and they both know it.
, comes from inside the shop and both men turn to see what happened.
“Well. I didn’t do
is my pride and joy. Don’t disrespect
pouting.
Cas keeps his eyes on Dean's mouth, and Dean smiles like a cat that got the cream.
“Night, Cas.”
“Oh- Dean- Hello. I see you’re feeling well, I- thought you were sick…” Novak trails off, eyes still big, filled with surprise but also some sort of relief. Dean notices a tiny smile on the doctor’s lips, and he has to force himself to look away, tapping with the pen on the notepad.
Cas stares at him like he's the one that lit up all the stars shining in the sky.
“I am not moping, and I’m feeling pretty tired so I’ll have to pass.”
The blue screen of death is what Dean sees in his mind.
After that Dean steps out of the Continental, coming close to Castiel. He steps away from him and the car, leaving Dean enough space to kneel on the garage’s floor and reach the car’s floor easily. After a couple of tugs the mat is back in place and the mechanic rises up, groaning as his knees pop.
But most importantly, he’s wearing combat boots. It’s all too much.
"You're a dick, you know? Shut up and c'mere, I'll show you how to suck a tongue."
“Hey, jerk” Sam says cheerfully before noticing the curved back of his older brother “did you stretch at least once since you sat there?”
Castiel just gestures towards the diver’s car door and waits there. Dean sits on the driver’s seat and turns on the car.
“But? You don’t put out on the first date?”
It’s not like it isn’t a stressful day. (Meg has fun teasing him every time they cross paths.)
is probably cursed or something.” he laughs a little, holding out a hand to help the other man get back on his feet.
He stops Kevin as he walks towards the kitchen.
“This is going to be
Dean’s face softens as it colors with a nice shade of pink, a tiny smile is on his lips as he replies “Well, if there’s pie I can’t say no. Give me your phone, I’ll add my number.”
Not even the thought of Meg teasing him can dampen his desire to be around the nerdy interior designer/part-time waiter/mechanic more. He’s funny and intelligent and just... beautiful.
Castiel, very pointedly ignoring the fact that Dean just called him cute because
“Heya Cas. Are you scared she will expel you if you don’t treat her right?”
Dean walks away, pointing at one free station, and Castiel gets back into the car to drive it there.
They share the snacks and chat about their day at work to pass the time, waiting for their food. When it arrives, Castiel is once again surprised by the combinations of flavours and is asking himself why he never tried this burger. His friend looks happy as a clam, eating his own burger and basically preening for having guessed Castiel's tastes right.
. Jesus, he’s a teenager again.
Dean’s face is alight with excitement and once again Castiel is taken aback by this man’s beauty. Still, the fact that Dean is excited at the idea of introducing him to another man doesn’t sit well with him.
“You don’t like it?”
Sam spots Dean’s phone and nudges it at his older brother, who rolls his eyes dramatically but picks it up and calls Novak’s clinic.
Thank God for cavities.
“Why do you keep saying my car is a she?”
“Can’t say I have, bitch” Dean loses no time in straightening and rolling his back, with some satisfying popping of bones “what are you doing here?”
“I guess I can try the pie... How’s the burger? It’s not some kale crap, right? I need my meat, man!”
"So what," he collects some crumbs with his fork and licks them off, keeping his eyes on the doctor’s, that track his own tongue’s movements.
Castiel doesn’t have the time to ask what he is doing because Dean starts laughing while rising up again.
It's normal, right? They're going out for dinner together on a Friday, it'd be stupid and bad for the environment if they both drove there.
The only thing he can see now are the other man’s shoes, so he lets his eyes wander around.
“You sure you got into Stanford because of your brain? Because you’re sounding stupid right now.”
He’s starting to get annoyed. Meg is a good friend, but her attempts to meddle with his love life (especially with Balthazar and Gabriel’s help) are not his favorite part of their friendship.
y’know what i have no time for this, gotta work ttyl
“They didn’t approve?”
“What can I say,
is the reason why he’s currently curled on Charlie’s loveseat, with his hands covering his face.
“Get off me or we’ll end up sleeping here.”
“Heya, Doc, Alfie. How's it going?” Dean seems very relaxed, and Castiel takes that as a sign to calm the fuck down.
Castiel is very confused.
“Oh- please, forgive me, I shouldn’t have assumed!”
So, the doctor wants to play.
Cas keeps asking where they’re going, unable to keep the curiosity at bay, but Dean doesn’t budge and keeps repeating “You’ll see when we get there, it’s a surprise!”
“She’s not my wife, she’s- a colleague- I mean, she’s a friend! We’re not- she’s
He gets out of the house, jogs to Baby’s side and opens the car door. Sitting on the driver’s seat immediately calms him down. He rolls down the windows, selects the tape he wants to listen to (he decides for Mothership) and after letting it play he starts the car.
