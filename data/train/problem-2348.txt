With a roll of his eyes, John (reluctantly) handed Sherlock the pad. Sherlock opened it and stared at the drawings.
Sherlock turned to look at Lestrade, feeling that he didn't even know what to tell her. Nothing was 'okay', they didn't have a single clue, John was in danger and this clinic kept being a mystery. He rubbed his forehead, trying to supress his growing headache.
"I jumped off because it had to be believable. He had killed himself but that was just the tip of the iceberg, there was more, he had planned far much more. You had to be there, you had to watch."
"Stay away from me!", John said, trying to distance himself as much as possible. It shouldn't have hurt as much as it did. Sherlock felt the truth kicking in: after listening to that tape, John had lost all the trust he had in him.
They had fallen asleep at some point. After Sherlock had poured his whole heart out to John, he felt completely exhausted and collapsed against the couch, closing his eyes and wondering if he had just committed the worst mistake he could have ever done, when a few minutes later John sat right next to him, looking at him fixedly, not saying anything, neither of them doing it but saying it either way. They didn’t kiss, they didn’t do anything else, but at the moment it wasn’t necessary. Sherlock was happy enough.
John nodded and opened the door wider, allowing Sherlock in. Sherlock stepped inside and took a quick look around.
He debated going to the ER and kidnapping John and locking him in 221B or something but he knew that wasn’t the right way to keep John safe, and he would be forced to explain John what was happening and mention that his life was in danger and he wanted to avoid that as much as possible. He knew John Watson and he knew that if John Watson knew his life was in danger he would go after the person who was putting his life in danger. And that was certainly a bit not good.
The corners of his mouth twitched in a small smile. This painting existed physically, but its meaning went beyond the physical, its meaning was mental, meant to affect every single person in their own subjectivity, in their own appreciation of it.
“I can’t keep drawing legs and arms for the rest of my life. Can you imagine them in my paintings? Just floating around amidst the colors? That would be too surrealistic, even for me”, he said with a small smile.
John laughed, "it's true though", he stood up and walked towards his bed. "I would never give this up", he whispered as he leaned towards Sherlock. "I mean it. Never". He bent in and kissed him softly.
Then he heard more sirens, in the middle of the confusion brought by the incident. John looked at the three police cars that were approaching to the street, and kept looking as the police force and the detectives got out of it. The town was so small and so peaceful that something like this was absolutely incredible. "...Sherlock?"
Sherlock smiled at John and he needn't say anything, he knew John forgave him. He felt better, like he had taken a weight off his shoulders. They stood silent for the rest of the ride, but the awkwardness was gone, they were so comfortable with each other's company, that they were afraid talking would ruin everything.
to, because if he did, he was resigning to put an end to everything, and he certainly didn't want that either.
He grabbed John's hands, intertwined their fingers and stared at him. John was breathing hard, and so was Sherlock. They needed each other desperately. This was new, all of this. Sherlock had needed John desperately every single day since January 29th, 2010, but he had never needed him like this, like he needed to pull him apart and to merge every single bit of him with his own until they were one. No. The need had never been so absorbing, so deep, so
"I know, I know! But I was drunk and I just wanted to see you and I couldn't come up with a better excuse. So I was terrified, but it felt so good. I love driving, John. I do."
Maybe Sherlock would be right next to his house again, maybe even though he could not talk to him, he could see him through his window, and that would be enough. Well, not enough actually, but something.
Lots of things had happened ever since, and now Sherlock wasn’t so comfortable with the cameras. Somehow, looking at all those lights fixed on him, at the microphones and the reporters’ voices he had a flashback to Serbia. His knees wobbled for a moment.
She loosened the hold of the two men and hurried towards John, who was leaving the crime scene. "Oh John, I'm glad you're Okay! These monkeys wouldn't let me see you!"
John was looking fixedly at Mycroft without realizing, while Mycroft looked at Sherlock with a frown. John reacted when he heard Sherlock's voice and stood up. "Yeah, sure." He nodded at Mycroft. "Thanks for dinner." Then he went towards Mrs Hudson and grinned. "It was delicious."
Sherlock broke the silence. "Tea?" He said, moving towards the edge of the chair as if he was about to stand up.
John smiled. “I have an idea”, he told Sherlock excitedly. “For a painting. It just came flying into my head, and it’s
Sherlock stared at him "You just talked to Mycroft and told him what had happened, you felt tired but felt the need to stay awake so you served a cup of coffee but thought it wasn't enough so you got yourself some wine. You talked to Mrs. Hudson, apparently the sex holiday is not going quite well, I think his new man is seeing someone else. You had a fight with Harry this morning, she is drinking again after all the money you spent in treatments. She's also talking to Clara again, they might come back together, she didn't tell you because she didn't know how to."
He sighed and entered to the classroom, not wanting to see his sister before turning away, because he suspected she knew all the things that were going through his mind.
Lestrade asked him about John, and Sherlock realized he had been distracted by the whole case. But now, remembering that John still hadn’t texted and apparently wasn’t interested in joining him on his cases, on going back to the life they used to have before, or at least on going back to be friends (something that, Sherlock would come to realize during his exile, was never something they really were, because they were always
to Victor. I didn't feel strong enough to be alone, I felt like I was nothing without him, that only by his side I'd be complete. He had it all: the sex and the pills, what else did I need?"
Sherlock lifted his eyebrow and took the paper, staring at it carefully and John wished so hard it was his number instead of hers. "So... Are you calling her?"
good together!" She said with a smile. As soon as she said that, Sherlock stood up so fast that John didn't even have time to reply "I'm not his friend" and was closing the door of the laboratory without saying another word to Mrs Hudson, who was barely able to say "...I'm going to have a talk with your parents."
He knew that wasn't right, that his sister was a fine example of why drinking was absolutely wrong but hell, it was so hard to care when he was having so much fun, plus, it's not like drinking five beers would make him an alcoholic, they would make him light-headed, sure, but alcoholic not so much.
Sherlock looked at him for a moment and smirked, looking confused. John turned and said, "I'll see you later."
An awkward silence fell between the two of them. Sherlock couldn't describe quite well what he was feeling. A part of him was excited, looking at John right where he belonged, another part was irrationally angry and wanted to shake him until he'd look into his eyes and recognize him again, and the other part, the one he didn't dare to admit he had, felt an acute and utter pain. A kind of pain he had never felt before, a kind of pain which only seemed to stab deeper and deeper with every second John spent at the flat still not knowing who Sherlock Holmes was.
He closed his eyes again, clenched his jaw and his fists and managed to turn. But Hikes wasn't there anymore, he had never been there in the first place, had he?
Breaking into the apartment was far too easy. This man was leaving for three weeks and didn't even bother about properly securing his house? What was up with the criminal classes these days?
John sighed, every time he thought he was making an improvement with Sherlock, things went backwards again and he was starting to get tired of it. Yet he had to be friendly. "Yes. I mean, if you want to..."
fast. It was contradictory. A part of him practically begged to see John again, but another part of him told him that it wasn’t okay, that growing attached to people in any way was never a good idea.
And John couldn’t remember a moment when he had felt more at peace with himself and with his surroundings. Perhaps such moment had existed, but it had been blurred amidst the sweat, the heat and the blood of Afghanistan.
John had just finished his second class and was leaving the classroom when he found Sherlock in the lockers talking to his friends. Well, not really talking, he barely paid attention to them and rolled his eyes every time one of them made a stupid comment which was all the time but they didn't seem to notice, except for Jim, who looked at him fixedly.
Then he turned to look at Sherlock. “Thought you’d get rid of me that easily huh?”, he said quirking an eyebrow.
Sherlock didn't answer, but John turned to look at Harry and greeted her with a hug. "Hello, Harry!"
"You just saw the picture! I couldn't have possibly made up all of what I just told you!" Sherlock said, sounding a bit desperate.
John smiled softly at him and Sherlock let go of one of his hands to run a hand down his cheek. John closed his eyes and leaned into the touch.
John shook his head trying hard not to make eye contact with Sherlock, whose blue/green/gray eyes were fixed on him. "No, no. Just so you leave that clear to her."
John shook his head too. "Do you think it's easy for me? Sherlock, at least you have friends, you have a girlfriend, you have a reputation, all I had was
He stopped in front of a little coffee shop in Marylebone Road. He had no idea how long it had taken him to get there, because there was a fair distance from his tiny flat to the avenue. He entered, looking desperately for a cup of black coffee with no sugar, which he thought might help him with the severe headache.
"Morning"- John said with effort. Sherlock looked at John and smiled, an expression that really confused John.
Sherlock unbuttoned John's shirt, slowly, as if it was the first time he did it. It wasn't, not with John, but there was something new in this, not only the element of eternity, but the element of commitment hidden within it, without any barriers. The last time they had had sex they had tumbled to the ground as John cried against Sherlock's chest for all the things they'd lost, the time before that John didn't even know what he'd lost. Now there were no enemies standing in the way, no secrets hidden, just them. For the first time since the pool, it was just the two of them.
He needed a bit of inspiration, he might look for it on the only place which was actually able to bring him some peace.
"You went into Sherlock's bedroom! You looked so calm and cool and I honestly thought you were going to tell him everything about your feelings, but I couldn't stop you! I've never heard you more determined. Now you tell me what happened when you got into that room!"
Lestrade left. Sherlock smiled and jumped with excitement: "Yes! A Message! Oh we're dealing with an interesting assassin aren't we?"
He entered to his house, didn't talk to his mom and went directly to his bed. He didn't sleep at all that night.
While they walked from John's garage to the crime scene John's curiosity won him over and he decided to ask Sherlock. "Sherlock, are you going to tell me what are you doing here?"
John looked around, trying to conceal his disappointment. He smiled at Sherlock and nodded. In a corner of the living room there was the only thing that brought some king of presence into the flat: the painting of a body.
He felt the need to reply to her, but he knew that it wasn't what he was supposed to be like, he was so surprised that even if he had texted her back he wouldn't even know what to say to her.
John turned to look at Sherlock and said "Sherlock, listen to your brother. Enter to your house and get some sleep, I'll see you on Monday okay?"
corrupting you," Sherlock said touching John's arm and turning to face him, leaning close, so close to John's lips, but John felt the invading smell of booze and shook his head.
Sherlock looked cool and calmed when he replied: "I want it all from you. Just as much as I'm willing to give my all to you."
He had finished his cigarette and he still couldn't find the focus, the strength he needed to just stop
“There was a moment when I felt all the strength leaving my body, all the energy giving up, and I just let it happen, but then it didn’t. It never came. And I still wonder why it didn’t. Before- just before that, I saw you”, he said, refusing to meet John’s eyes. “And I said I was sorry I wasn’t going to make it, I’d never see you again.”
He tossed another one into his mouth. Three, three was fine. Three is better than nine, which was his record. Temperature rising. He felt hot, he took off his jacket. It was a different kind of hot from the normal, the kind of hot the pills gave him was somehow...satisfying.
"What about your friend?" She asked pointing with her finger at Jim, who was in the backyard sucking hard on his cigarette.
Sherlock cleared his throat and put his phone in his pocket, feeling a blush reaching his cheeks. "Apparently yes."
John had been at lunch break when he was kidnapped and he was taken somewhere. Somewhere with feelings attached. Somewhere related to their own story. Melissa might have gained access to those memories when she erased John’s, considering that Melissa was the killer. Which was just a theory, only a hypothesis that Sherlock honestly didn’t want to prove correct.
John screamed in pain. Sherlock bent on his knees once again. He couldn’t walk towards John, he knew it would only make things worse, but he was completely desperate, as if all of his body was pushing him towards John. It was taking all of his mental capacity to not move at all.
He'd love every single version of John Watson he could get, for it was better than no John Watson at all.
Sherlock stared at her, frowning. Who the hell was she? Did he know her? Then who did she think she was to come and say those things to him?
“For God’s sake, Sherlock! I haven’t bought anything since I came back! I was lucky I found something I could draw with!”
Sherlock looked up and stared at John in utter and complete surprise. John pointed at the player once again, "that's-", he dragged a deep breath, "that's what it said, in the tape. I. Would. Have. Gone. With. You."
So, there you have it, finally after 38 chapters, the word 'cock' makes its appearance. I'm still not sure whether this should be considered 'mature' or 'explicit' though. This is my first attempt at writing smut or something of the like so excuse the naivety and tell me what you think about it! Certainly hope you liked it and... well expect some more.
There was silence. An intimate kind of silence. A kind of silence which was loud enough to fill the whole room and cover them both.
His eyes widened. What the hell was John doing in Baker Street at 3 in the morning? Not that he was complaining, but something seemed odd.
been a dream. He had arrived home six hours ago, without saying a single word to anyone. He closed himself in his room and laid on the bed. He didn't know if he cried or if he screamed in rage or if he stood still and silent. He remembered falling asleep at some point, he remembered waking up three times.
He palmed John's hard cock over his pants and they couldn't stop kissing, wouldn't stop kissing. There was no turning away from this and right at the moment, Sherlock couldn't care less.
Sherlock eyed him warily as John looked at the paintings. He didn’t say anything else, but he looked slightly anxious, as if he really cared about what John saw there.
From the door, Sherlock heard someone clearing his throat. He turned to look at Lestrade, who was looking at Sarah. Then he looked at Sherlock and whispered: "apologize."
He wasn't sure what to think. What did she mean with dinner? He tried to deduce it, but nothing. He looked at her, he smelled that perfume, nothing. "Why would I want to have dinner if I'm not hungry?"
Sherlock opened the door, John was holding a glass of wine in his hand, he looked at Sherlock, Sherlock didn't look him back, he just stared at the window, speechless. "So, she's back".
John narrowed his eyes. "Sherlock, I saw this body and I'm shaking and I feel incapable of keeping my eyes on it and I feel like I might throw up. I can't. I could never be a doctor." He said with a tone of disappointment.
His headache only seemed to have gotten more intense. He sighed, took the keys and walked out of his flat, how come he was a bloody doctor and he didn't have a single pill for a headache?
He got up of bed and felt his head was going to explode, and his left hand was trembling uncontrollably. God, he needed a pill. Hadn't he learned what alcohol did to him? Why did he keep doing it then?
Sherlock remembered John had said something before the woman had arrived to distract them, what was it? The three words hit him like a truck:
"No one. Let's go." Sherlock turned and left. John stood where we was, confused and looking at Sherlock.
Half an hour had passed since John and Harry left. Sherlock was sitting on his chair, thinking that he hadn't been alone in the apartment since he came back from death. He hated to admit it, but he missed John and despised the feeling of loneliness he used to treasure long time ago. How was that even possible? What had changed so much? What did John change?
"Because we're stupid." John said, trying to light the environment, his anger was leaving again, and he felt a sudden need to hold Sherlock. But he wouldn't.
So he had agreed, he had regretted it, he had been confused, he had been determined and now he was thinking it had been the biggest mistake of his life.
As soon as he heard his last name, John turned his face up from the pad and looked at the man passing by his side, who gave a loud breath and walked forcedly towards the desk. He answered the greaser's reaction by rolling his eyes, also showing his displeasure.
"Come on, love." Sherlock realized of what he had said too late and widened his eyes and closed his mouth.
John took his hands off his face and jumped in surprise as soon as he saw Sherlock standing so close to him.
He shook his hands off Sherlock's hold and turned, the greaser's smile suddenly vanished. "Fine. I'll get them opened." John said without looking at Sherlock and walking towards the big windows of Hikes' classroom.
It was impossible. There weren’t enough words to express that. Perhaps there were enough colors to express it, but John was the expert on it.
The hardest part of visiting John’s blog regularly was to avoid writing a comment. There were so many things he wanted to say, he wanted to start by telling him he was alive. But that was… a bit not good. He also wanted to comment on John’s writing skills. But he stopped himself halfway.
Sherlock's pain numbed as soon as he heard those four letters. He stood speechless, unable to say anything else. His brain unfocused on the intruders inside his body and placed its attention on storing the way John had just said that word deep into his mind palace. He would keep that memory locked for the rest of his life.
"It's just-" John took a deep breath. "My life is a mess. I had a fight with my family, I lost Physics, which means I lost the opportunity to get into a proper college, I'm good for nothing and that is never going to change." The tears were rolling down his face again. "And then there's you..." John closed his mouth as soon as he realized what he just said.
The only interesting part about that waste of time was that he got to ask Lestrade about Jones’ interrogation -not useful, the man still refused to speak and wouldn’t even begin to admit having killed Alice, so the police hadn’t told him he was the main suspect on the other murders. He was being held in custody until they gathered enough evidence against him-.
Perhaps the pain of withdrawal was somewhere along his body, hidden in a little corner, but it was blurred, taken over by a bigger, deeper pain, a pain that he had no idea where it started and where it ended. He didn't know anymore. He didn't know how to stop all of this.
John was sitting on a chair, his arms and legs bound to it. His forehead was bleeding, as if he had been hit on the head in order to bring him here. His eyes widened at the sight of Sherlock, and they showed something akin to relief. A kind of relief Sherlock wasn’t feeling.
Sherlock stood still, thinking. The spaces for the folders from the last three years were empty, they were in his possession. Well, in Scotland Yard’s possession, which meant that they were safe, and yet the killer had killed again. Had probably memorized the information or something of the sorts.
"Oh yes! How was he? Was he good? Oh don't tell me, it was his first time wasn't it? I should have known, he looks so inexperienced! Oh, isn't that adorable?"
“Of course I do. In order to draw your face, we need a strong pencil whose tip won’t break under your trembling hand.”
Sherlock nodded, feeling too terrified to even be embarrassed. John looked at him with worry but he didn’t say another word, his hands were intertwined with Sherlock’s, but just slightly, as if he didn’t want to push it.
Her salad arrived. He didn't eat, he just looked at her, puzzled. Still not sure of what to make of all of this, the situation was absurd, there was nothing usual about this. What could possibly be this?
"I'm taller and older, I wouldn't do that if I were you." The greaser said and it should have sounded like a joke, except some thing in the way he talked told John that Sherlock wasn't joking at all.
It wasn't weird, not really. Whenever Mrs Hudson wasn't home, nor Sherlock nor John would answer the door, probably Sherlock was upstairs yelling at the doorbell to shut up.
"Don't worry, we all have secrets, Mr. Holmes. It's okay if you don't want to tell me, I'll find out anyway, eventually."
Sherlock stared at John, the anger was growing bigger and bigger, he thought about what he was going to say, when the words came abruptly from his mouth: "You don't know me at all John, at all!"
He was so lost in thoughts he didn't realize in which moment the greaser turned his face towards John's window and now they were just staring at each other and time was freezing and it was just the two of them and John couldn't look away. Sherlock's expression was unreadable, yet he wasn't taking his eyes off either.
"Of course, what else could we talk about? Have you seen that guy? He only talks about people who dies and violin and bees and I couldn't care less. The only thing we have in common is you!"
"Oh!, oh! OH! Sherlock didn't want to! Oh he is such a virgin! Awww! You'll have to be a little patient then, but it's okay, don't worry, let him take his time" -she winked at him, and the wink only made him angrier.
As he arrived to the corner, he lit up the cigarette and started smoking anxiously. He hated those times when he smoked one, and that one led to another and that led to another and then the package was gone and he didn't feel better. It was something rare, but it happened sometimes.
Lestrade shook his head, suddenly taken a bit aback. Was Sherlock Holmes asking for his help? "Sherlock... We haven't talked to each other since you, well, died."
But he knew next to nothing about that man, except for the fact he painted nudes and he lived at that place. And he wasn’t even certain of that, what if it was his boyfriend’s -girlfriend’s? - flat? What if he wasn’t living there anymore? What if he never even lived there at all and he was just attending a party, or a social encounter or whatever?
“I won’t ask you to draw anything, I just want you to show me which colors come to your mind when you think of Afghanistan. Paint them.”
“Michael Jones was captured. But another person who had the scar was murdered. He is not the killer.”
Sherlock sighed but obeyed. "Watson, Mrs Hudson. Mrs Hudson..." The greaser turned to look at John and rolled his eyes. "...John Watson."
"Her ex-fiancé!", Sherlock repeated. "Melissa told us, she always said horrible things about him. Look for him Lestrade, it must be somewhere in your record before you filed her murder as a cold case".
"Do you know where Holmes is? I didn't see him in any of my classes and he wasn't in the smoking corner either, so..."
". He recognized the handwriting, Sherlock's, obviously. He opened it up. A sweater, a warm knitted sweater that fitted him perfectly. When Sherlock saw the sweater, he lifted his gaze to see John's face who was smiling widely.
It was Saturday evening, and things were starting to get moving. He knew the man would be busy and it would be a good excuse for a fast talk, a warrant he would keep his answers short. That considering he would be willing to answer...
Sherlock cleared his throat as he pulled out a vinyl and put it on the record player. "Yes. Yes he did."
He didn’t want to remember those scarce days when he actually felt happy, happy with his work, happy with the fame, happy with who he was. Someone had said that something that happened just once might as well never have happened at all. Who was it? He couldn’t remember, he had read it somewhere. And John wondered whether he had been really and completely happy or if he just had imagined he was.
John widened his eyes and turned to look at Sherlock, who didn't dare to look him back. "I'm sorry, what?"
The sun was starting to come out when Sherlock opened his eyes once again. He hadn't had any nightmares after he fell asleep on John's arms. He widened his eyes.
It didn’t matter, now it was nothing but wishful thinking, but desiring too much, but wanting what he couldn’t have, and what he was certain after the class, would never have.
He was getting better and he'd be discharged soon, he knew it. He was desperate to leave hospital, but he feared with every cell in his being that this would be the last he would see of John Watson.
“But, well, the technique… is just, terrible”, John admitted, his eyes fixed on the painting, as if he was afraid of looking at Sherlock.
. Pathetic. He was disappointed of himself. But now he had awoken. He had taken the veil off his eyes, he realized of how pointless it was falling for someone. Damn it, no. He didn't
His mother looked at John suspiciously, then turned to Sherlock and threw her hands in the air. "Alright, just please take care of my boy."
Sherlock wondered how he could have possibly taken so long in finding out who had done it, it was obvious, once he had Lacuna as the unifying factor, the rest of the pieces would fall together.
John blushed a little but tried to defend himself. He spoke lowly, very very low. "How can we be a couple if you already are in one?" He certainly didn't want it to sound hurt, because John was convinced Sherlock didn't love Irene at all, but still that was the tone it sounded.
Sherlock regretted immediately of what he had said. But he was still so mad. He didn't know what he was doing, he wasn't thinking properly, he was just saying stupid things, but in some way, it was liberating.
He stared into Victor’s eyes. He couldn’t quite tell, but did he look sad? He could swear he caught a glimpse of utter bitterness behind that fixed look. He thought about it for a second, remembered the Victor Trevor he met, the Victor who had been his first friend, the Victor before drugs, the brilliant Victor who only demanded a bit of attention from his parents and was in need of a friend without even knowing it. During that short moment, he could almost see that Victor. And he felt so sorry for him. This Victor, whoever he was now, wasn’t happy, he was helpless.
So he smiled as he felt each touch from Sherlock's lips on his face. He could do nothing but hold him, hoping it was showing everything he wasn't saying, everything he didn't feel brave enough to say yet.
"But there is no other way out! He doesn't know who I am! He doesn't know I exist! He doesn't give a damn about me, then why should I give a damn about him?"
John stared at him for a moment until he blinked. He shook his head and smiled a bit at Sherlock. "You're right. Sorry. I was a bit- confused. Hello, Mr. Holmes. Have you come to interrogate me?"
"I didn't ask you to do the whole fucking job! I told you each one would do its part!" Sherlock said, not knowing now if he was angry or if he sounded desperate.
He grabbed Sherlock strongly by the shoulder to force him to turn to face him again and took him by the collar in his jacket, pulling him closer. The greaser kept his eyes fixed on John, frowning. "Listen, it is not a delight for me to work with you but it's what I have to do and I'll do it, alright? Now I want to leave something clear, just one thing: do NOT expect me to do the whole damn thing just because I am a nerd or whatever you call me. If you want this shit to work then you'll have to put something from your part. I was thinking we reunite next Monday to define the topic. And you
“Eyelashes, yes”, Sherlock replied, “scatter them naturally, use sharper traces in order to add the illusion of multiplicity.”
He sat in the edge of his bed, he was very tired. He opened his bags and took out his biology book, just because he enjoyed reading it. As soon as he saw the books, the memory of what had happened before came back, and he remembered Sherlock, threatening him, pushing him and annoying him, and it had only been a day! , John took a deep breath, asshole. "God, I hate him, I hate that guy."
He was gone before Sherlock could say anything else. He then listened to the door closing and sighed. He wished John would stay, always, forever, for the rest of their lives.
He tucked his hands into the pockets of his Belstaff and started walking towards Marylebone Road, desperately needing a cigarette.
"No. I don't." John said honestly, but his voice came lower than he thought, probably because the pain in his back and his head was bigger. "I really,
"Yeah." Sebastian nodded looking around at the girls that were passing by. "Oh, now if you excuse me, I just found me a dolly." He said rising his cup and leaving.
Mike raised an eyebrow at Sherlock. "Sherlock, flash news, you're not a doctor, you have no saying in this", Mike said, clearly still furious at them.
Sherlock went upstairs and saw John, still sleeping deeply. He smiled to himself. He hated to, but he had to wake him up and take him to the guests room, so he could sleep in a proper bed. He leaned in front of him and whispered softly in his ear. "John..."
"Oh don't even start denying it Sherlock! Because I've known you for five bloody years and hell, I can tell that you're lying. So just don't. Don't pretend like you don't care, like she is not a big deal to you because she is, God, she is! So stop saying you don't care about her and admit it! Just admit it!"
“Greg”, John replied with a nod and with a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes, because worry was still drawn all over his features.
They pretty much always started the same way: he walked into St. Bart's, Mike Stamford next to him, Sherlock asking Afghanistan or Iraq.
“You know”, John continued as he started painting the iris of his eye, “Autumn Orange is not actually called Autumn Orange”, he said distractedly.
And Sherlock was dying to drive it. He hadn't been in a car since... The accident and he forgot how much he loved driving. He put himself together and bit his lower lip, as he opened the companion's door and John entered on the driver's one.
Sherlock walked towards his violin and picked it up, turning his back towards Lestrade. "Do as you please, Detective Inspector." He said coldly.
John nodded and walked towards him. With every step he took he could see the uncertainty and the confusion drawing in Sherlock’s features and he
Sherlock told him everything about the case, and John listened with interest. He laughed at Sherlock’s sharp remarks and looked worried or even anxious at some points, and even though he never felt he was a good storyteller -John was the romantic one-, he would do it for John. And John liked it, apparently.
Sherlock turned and his eyes buried in John's face, he was angry, he was really angry. "It certainly wasn't John! It was stupid!" -the word stupid came almost like a shout.
John was safe. John would be okay. They both would. He’d come back tonight and they’d talk. That’s what he said they’d do.
But then the truth came crushing him: John Watson was strong enough to defeat Sherlock's demons. Sherlock Holmes wasn't.
"Certainly I'm not John, Mr. Holmes". Sherlock looked up, and his smile faded away. Irene Adler was there, and they were alone, and she looked... Good. She was wearing a long, tight and white dress, and The lipstick, that red lipstick.
He realized a second later that his hands were still holding onto John’s forearms. He looked down and pulled back, feeling awkward.
Greg nodded. "Yes, he helps us once in a while." Sherlock snorted. "...Occasionally." Greg corrected, looking at Sherlock.
He nodded at Sherlock, even though he knew the detective was so immersed on the folder he probably hadn't even caught the gesture. He stood up and moved towards the door. When he was about to leave the flat, a tiny voice stopped him. "He didn't recognise me."
John traced the letters with his fingertips, slowly. He kept his eyes fixed to it, going back to that moment, that one final moment before it all went to hell.
Sherlock sighed again. "Do you remember when we first met and you told me to choose a topic for the history project and I chose Chemistry even though it would be a topic that would affect both of us? Well, this time is your choice, John. It's up to you now. I certainly won't save us. You decide if you will or not. You choose what you want." Sherlock turned again.
Sherlock lifted and eyebrow and turned to look at John, who avoided eye contact with the greaser at all costs. "Oh! Has He?"
Sherlock shook his head. "I'm not. I'm just bringing a friend to buy some things and enjoy a gig. What's awkward about it?"
Sherlock crouched and smiled. "Old cases that Scotland Yard hasn't solved yet, which are most of the cases in London."
John smiled widely, but it was too dark, so Sherlock could only see the shadow of that precious smile.
Sherlock wasn't sure whether he could really carry on with that memory, knowing that that moment, carefully stored inside of his Mind Palace, meant nothing for anybody else.
Okay I'll be perfectly honest with you: this chapter was a caprice. It's a tribute to the movie that inspired it, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and to my absolute favorite sequence from it (which actually lasts for half of the movie), there's no need for you to have watched it, but I think this is an appropriate time to fill in the void and listen to the other side of the story ahem...John's. Enjoy! :)
Back in their rooms, John was once more reminded of his determination to understand what was causing his Prince’s black mood as Sherlock threw himself in an almost-empty armchair, his temporary triumph at unmasking Princess Adler’s disguise having been replaced by petulance once again. The knight’s subtle queries of the last days had brought nothing in terms of new information, so he decided to go to the crux of the matter.
“Shouldn’t you be administering morphine as a counter-poison then, instead of wondering?” cut Sherlock, his hands twitching with the need to act, to make sure by himself that his knight would be fine. Ella wasted no time to wonder how the Prince knew the way to counteract belladonna, knowing he frequently dabbled into more-or-less sinister experiments concerning dangerous substances.
“Can you remember which ones of the new servants were here this afternoon, then? Around two hours after the sun reached its peek?”
“Do you? And what could you have possibly learnt about me in our fight as brothers in arms, except for a vague knowledge of my fighting style?”
“Now come. I still have to show you our rooms, and my brother is no doubt impatiently waiting for me.”
It worked like a charm – the strange insecurity that lingered in Sherlock’s eyes, like he expected to be mocked and shut out now that he had confided to his feelings, swiftly disappeared as he analysed John’s curious comment.
John had rarely felt as exhausted. Princess Adler, still to be monitored closely, had been put to bed, the Colonel had been thrown in a cell, men had been sent out on a search for an eventual accomplice awaiting for Moran’s signal in what even John could recognize as a frankly ridiculous tentative. He had had a long and painful conversation with Lady Sarah, who explained with a firm voice but without meeting his eyes that her Mistress had wanted Sherlock to be alert  and to be aware of a Moriarty’s existence (apparently this was a name he was supposed to know so he didn’t interrupt her, carefully memorising it) and had decided a direct threat to what he held dear was the best way to make sure he felt implicated.
expect me to follow your orders when someone I love is in danger, because it won't happen", John said, his eyes fixed on the road.
His mother pulled him in a hug and he unconsciously shuddered and gasped at the pain he felt in his back, from the fight with Jim. Well, not really fight. Her mother loosened the hold rapidly and turned to look worried at her son, cupped his face with her hands, staring fixedly at it, checking if he had any bruise or anything. "What happened, John? Did somebody hurt you?"
"I don't know, but I hope he takes his time to come back because I wouldn't be capable of looking at him right now, I would probably pee."
He took a brush from the set of brushes Sherlock had in his desk. He grabbed the turpentine and the palette and poured just a drop of each of the colors. “I believe that a color is not a color”, he started.
. John sighed. He wanted to do everything but going to that class. He stood there for a while thinking about how much had changed in so little time (again!) first he hated the class, then it was his favorite, now he hated it again. He picked his books from the locker and went to the classroom.
John took the palette and the oils and started mixing, but just before he was about to start, he turned to look at Sherlock and softly said, “talk to me.”
Stupidly wrong, thinking he grasped it all just by looking at a stupid painting that is just a bunch of stripes in pretty much the same stupid and boring and meaningless color. “Sod this”, he said with animosity. “Sod this”.
He shoved Victor a bit. He shook his head, fighting the blush which was threatening to invade his cheeks. “I’m not up for that either. Not anymore. I think I made myself clear enough last night.”
"Well... You said you had heard me when I talked to your grave. If you did, then you know I wasn't okay. It was hard, of course it was, I saw you die in front of my eyes and I could do nothing about it. I had saved a lot of lives, yet I couldn't save yours. How did you think I could feel? I wanted you not to be dead, Sherlock. I missed you, I missed solving crimes with you, I missed hearing you making your deductions, I even missed your blog. Somehow, it became harder, coming to Baker Street, I just had to get away from it. Too many memories, there was too much to bear, and I couldn't, I felt powerless. So yes, it was hard."
"Watson. Get. Out." Sherlock said emphatically and John felt scared. Of course, Sherlock was going to kick the shit out of him. So he was not leaving. No.
And he was determined to find out what could possibly cause John Watson such an inexplicable and unknown pain.
John kissed him more eagerly, and started moving his finger in and out. A moment later he tucked in another and Sherlock moaned at the combination of pain and pleasure, perhaps more pain than pleasure at the moment, but it didn't matter. "Shh", John whispered against his ear, "it's okay, I got you love."
He couldn’t find it. He couldn’t see it. He looked for perfection, not for beauty. The thing was that the world he lived in was a place he didn’t feel happy about, and so he reproduced it as faithfully as possible.
Sherlock looked at it and replied almost automatically. “How’s John Watson?” That definitely wasn’t what he was planning on saying next, it sort of escaped from his mouth, unable to be stopped.
About two hours had passed and he was already feeling hammered. And he hated that. Before the accident he used to handle alcohol so well, the word
Sorry for leaving you for so long with that terrible cliffhanger. Thank you so much for your support, I hope you like this chapter! x
"Your brother. I know that he has found out I am back, Mr. Holmes. He wants to get rid of me. The whole British government is looking for me. They want me dead and I don't want to die."
Sherlock sang opening his eyes and turning to look at John, who was staring at him with a frown and looking upset. As soon as the song was over, Sherlock straightened and looked at John expectantly. "Well?" "Well what?" John said seriously.
He didn’t look at him either. He just sat behind, not pushing, not kicking, not punching, not yelling. Now
But he couldn't find that strength, not when his heart was bumping out of his chest, not when Sherlock fixed his blue/green/gray eyes on him. He didn't want to be with him, because he knew it was never going to work out and they both had
"No." Sherlock said shaking his head and grabbing John by his arm. "I refuse to do that, I won't lose you. I
John realised it was already time to go looking for lunch, but he really didn't feel like it. His head was still killing him after taking two pills. What he really needed was a coffee, to leave the hangover behind.
He heard the door downstairs opening. Someone climbing up, and he felt a sudden happiness, he had come back for him, yes. "John, did you forget anything?"
“John?”, Sherlock asked, when John grew silent for far too long. “John?”, he said, turning to look at him.
Sherlock closed his eyes, muttering to himself, "a cold case, a cold case, a cold case", willing his brain to work faster faster faster.
John smiled at him but couldn't take the worry off his face. He opened the book once again and kept reading for a while. "What about you?", he asked, all of the sudden.
He felt a hand on his forearm and he turned to look at it. John was looking at him with wide eyes. “Are you okay?”
There you have it. I can't believe this is actually ending. I really can't. This fic was a huge part of my life and I enjoyed so much writing it!
part of me. I can see it every time I'm with you, you still expect the punch, the insult, the joke. You don't believe me."
"They decided I had to leave him, they took me to rehab and then they took me with them to travel around the world."
He dreaded that cold, calculating look he saw in John Watson's eyes. A look he had never, not once, seen in his face before the fall. Now it seemed like John was studying him, seeing him as a potential threat, as someone who could cause him harm.
"Leave me alone and make sure no one else enters this room. Goodbye", he said, turning slightly to the side, away from the nurse's view.
Three minutes into seven and Sherlock really should have known it wouldn’t happen. He sat in his chair, leaned his head against the back and sighed. He was holding a pencil in his hand and felt the utter need to break it and rip the paper he-had-set-on-the-living-room-so-John-would-be-comfortable apart.
"I-I'll be looking in the bedroom. Now you stay here and make sure he doesn't go anywhere!" He said pointing at John, feeling a bit awkward, as the two men stared at each other.
“Well, I’m glad, we’re okay. I- thank you for talking to me. I’m sorry. And I’m sorry for coming at this hour but-”
Sherlock sat on the couch, feeling tired. John yawned. “Is it okay if I ask for some takeaway?”, John asked.
But there was something else in there that John hadn't dared to admit, being at the crime scene, he felt something different, he felt
Along with that, the environment in the school was not good. Up until this year, he had managed to keep a low profile, without disturbing anyone, without picking any fights, because he hated that kind of behavior. He didn't want to be
Sherlock stood silent for a moment. There was no other noise but that of the brush over the painting, mixing and merging.
He did hear someone approaching. And John could tell just by the way he walked it definitely was Sherlock. And he felt a pinch of relief. Sherlock walked slowly towards Jim, looking at John.
King Mycroft threw him a quick glance, as searching and thorough as his brother’s had been. He had the feeling he had just been neatly categorised as uninteresting and that he would have been forgotten soon thereafter if he hadn’t been in the Prince’s company.
Sherlock was aware however that his knight knew to be extremely cautious with anything resembling a chemical substance in their chambers and that he’d have sent for a fresh mug of ale from the kitchen rather than reheating a beverage left in their rooms unattended – this had to be a deliberate attempt on John’s life. Or rather on his health, considering the dosage hadn’t been fatal.
It occurred to John to wonder just how many times this had happened. Had the Prince often stumbled in, tired and hurt, while he slept placidly a few feet away or laid away despairing about the man’s lack of trust in him? He felt a sudden burst of contempt for the fool he had been – some Prince’s knight he was. But he now had his chance to act and earn his master’s trust.
Leaving Alte in the good hands of a stable boy and getting to enter the castle was remarkably easy as well; finding Lady Hudson, the old family friend his parents had written a recommendation letter to, was not so. After a brief hesitation he had started for the kitchens, figuring the servants there had to know the location of all the nobles’ bedchambers; rather than trying to figure their location on his own, he had asked another guard to point him the way. His interlocutor had thoroughly detailed his attire with a rather derisive smirk but he had answered his query easily enough; John was grateful he hadn’t tried to trust his instincts because he would have left in the completely opposite direction. A few moments later, however, he figured he must have taken a wrong turn somewhere, because he was in a part of the castle that seemed much too richly decorated to lead to the kitchens and servants’ quarter.
“Right, mister Knight. You can sure have a place in the stable, and I’ll make sure to treat yer horse particularly well.”
His brother’s answer to his brusque question could have seemed obscure to some, but he had long since grown used to the man’s elliptic reasoning.
Understanding the question wasn’t truly meant for her, Lady Sarah remained silent even as the room, which had become almost quiet, erupted once more in indistinct chattering. Lord Astair seemed ready to start protesting once more, but fell silent as Sherlock asked the guards to escort Colonel Moran to the royal table.
John Watson’s eyes, which had been intermittently threatening to close for the last few hours of his long trip, suddenly snapped open, bright and alert, as he heard the pitiful cry. In order to determine from where the cry had come he immediately pulled on his reins, the black mare obeying with an alacrity that belied its wariness.
John had made it clear that night that things had to change, and they did; he found himself joining the Prince when he left to get documents, meet with mysterious individuals (or not-so-mysterious ones, since one of his main sources of information appeared to be the children working in the castle or living on the streets in the city) or fight some ruffians, now understanding and following the man’s strange schedule.
“Please, Lord Astair.” The King’s voice immediately resonated. “I understand your panic, but please consider that on the eve of an alliance that would have strengthened both our Kingdoms, neither my brother nor I would have had any reason to harm the Princess. Please stay back, so that my Physician may examine Princess Irene.”
Suddenly soft brown hands were working alongside his; Sherlock’s eyes snapped up to see that the royal physician was carefully turning John over, making him ingest a mixture he didn’t recognize. It managed what the Prince hadn’t and made the knight vomit violently, and the sight made him sigh in partial relief. Surely John would be fine. They couldn’t have been too late. It was unconceivable.
The three of them would mock-fight one another for the first round; if one of them lost his two fights, he was eliminated. The second round would involve a fight against one of the knights. The man explaining this to them was very clear; one position was open, but it didn’t have to be filled today. Even the best among the three of them wouldn't necessarily become a knight.
A non-committal grunt. John remembered however how Sherlock himself had explained that the best way to make an unwilling witness talk was to make him or her want to contradict you – he figured that being complementary enough towards the Princess would accomplish that, considering the rivalry the two royals seemed to be engaged in.
“I-I’m not sure he did, Sire. Certainly he could have, as I was busy looking for a basin for Princess Adler.”
Most people acted before thinking. They were ruled by their instincts, merely reacting to stimuli rather than trying to influence them. It was an important part of the reason Sherlock despised most of humanity and certainly nothing he’d ever thought he’d envy. But he had been wrong, because here was John, white and not breathing and on the floor, and he really had to do something but still his brain wouldn’t let his body act before it had analysed the scene – white lips, poison, mug of ale slowly spilling its contents on the floor, most probable means of poisoning, he had to make sure there was enough left to analyse what the toxic had been, the door hadn’t been forced, someone had been invited in or had the key, or the beverage had been altered in the kitchen, was the drink left for him or for John, would a physician come soon enough to save his knight? And then a stray thought; this is just like this time in the forest when John had been hurt. But so much worse.
“I do believe you’re delirious. The blood loss must be more debilitating than the quantity of blood currently staining your armour would indicate – which means we should immediately head for the castle. Come on, John.”
John froze slightly, more because the stable boy’s words painfully awoke all his doubts than because of the inherent impertinence in the other’s queries. He didn’t know how to answer, but it turned out that he didn’t have to.
“What a polite young man! You look just like your mother, John – but you must get told this often enough. In any case it was certainly no trouble to accommodate you here for a while, my dear, no trouble at all. Now, just hang your coat on this patter; perhaps you’ll want a moment to freshen yourself up while I call for tea?”
Torches and candles had already been lit up for an hour in the castle, and in their vacillating light the circles that even the best-applied powder couldn’t hide seemed deeper than ever under the Princess’s eyes.
His eyes widened at the impoliteness inherent to the man’s tone of voice, which was cutting and clearly dismissive, but Molly seemed to pay it no heed and she merely did a clumsy little curtsey before leaving in the direction pointed out to her, her cheeks still flushed. Struck mute by all the strangeness he had seen and experienced in the last half of an hour, he finally managed to ejaculate his surprise.
“My Lords, it’s indeed a pleasure to see you again! Sherlock, I hope you have kept the painting of me I’d left you with.”
As always when he thought his name, Sherlock felt a tremor that was half-hate and half pure fascination.
“I believe you’ve met Princess Adler once before, King Mycroft. Like the bird her family is named after, she doesn’t like to be restrained by anything else than her own whims. She left two days before we did, leaving us with a simple note and no means of tracking her, and told us she would meet us here – we had little choice but to believe her and hope she’d indeed be present today. When we didn’t see her as we approached the castle, her closest confident -” Here he gestured at the long-haired woman in the middle of the room “- pleaded with us to give her a little more time and persuaded us that she could imitate her mannerisms well enough to fool you. Obviously she overestimated her own acting skills.”
“You think he’d stay anyway? Certainly you fulfill his need for adventure – but what about the need for official recognition his childhood in a poor noble family has left him with? You may not care a whit about your reputation, Sherlock, but what would he expect people to think if he remained at the castle – at your service and paid by you – without any official role? People might talk.”
The Princess only laughed, a clear bell of a laugh, taking off the official guard headwear with obvious relish and shaking her head a little to free her hair.
The Princess seemed unsure rather than mocking for the first time since John had unknowingly met her but the King rose before she could answer, trying to defuse what was slowly starting to resemble chaos.
The Prince’s voice rang with sincerity and bitterness; this wasn’t the answer John had been expecting.
Sherlock certainly didn’t share his brother’s disdain for what Mycroft called “leg-work” with a particularly regal twist of his lips; the thrill of the chase was one of the headiest sensations he knew of, just after the extremely satisfying moment when all the clues just clicked into place to reveal the solution to a case. He had nonetheless refused to resort to such measures until now, certain his skills would allow him to shed light on the matter of John’s poisoning without leaving their rooms, something he found himself inexplicably reluctant to do since his knight had been attacked and Mycroft hat “reminded” him the two months they had been allowed were coming to an end.
“I- Alte wouldn’t have gone very far, I’ll find her easily. How did you know about my wish to become a physician?”
The wedding was to be held on the morrow, and John mostly felt relieved. For the past week, ever since he had woken up on Sherlock’s bed to find the Prince at his bedside, Sherlock had behaved in a way John would have dubbed as overprotective if he had been describing anyone else. Sherlock certainly didn’t hover or even asked about his health, but he rarely left his knight alone and never when anyone else visited, only leaving to further investigate the events that had led to John’s poisoning – or at least John supposed that’s what he was doing, having not been put in the confidence in spite of his many queries.
The Prince’s head snapped up and John knew that he had him, even as the man automatically wiped all traces of surprise off his features. In spite of the man’s clear invitation to on the day of John’s unconventional dubbing, John had never made use of his given name before. Sticking to formalities had somehow always seemed essential to his continued sanity, but he suddenly found out that he didn’t care much about sanity any longer. It was a gamble he was ready to take.
Suddenly wishing to be nowhere near the vicinity of the King, Sherlock turned to leave, throwing a last, vicious parting shot at Lady Sarah.
“This I am glad to hear. I hope the meals you’ve chosen to have here have been just as satisfactory and taken in the same quietude.”
Truly chagrined now, John acknowledged two things; first, that the mocking guard from earlier must have voluntarily given him wrong directions, and secondly that the guard in front of him now seemed very determined to believe the worst of him. For a moment he felt truly distraught, pondering his few options. Although he believed he might have been able to fight this man if it came to this, he somehow doubted that getting in a row with one of the royal guards would endear him to the men who’d judge his skills as a potential knight – however, he likewise suspected that the man in front of him wasn’t ready to listen open-mindedly to more protests of his innocence. Just as his imagination started to get the better of him and he wondered if you could be thrown in the dungeons just for being at the wrong place in the capital, a deep and already familiar voice resonated.
Finally he made it out of the maze-like bazaar, although he suspected that the unexpected obstacle had taken him much further south than what he had anticipated. Querying a guard on patrol nearby about the way to the castle he made it there with no further difficulty, opening wide eyes as the road beneath him became more and more regularly paved and the houses around more and more sumptuous. Eventually, unexpectedly, he found himself in front of the royal edifice, and breath left him in a rush. The ‘castles’ he had seen back home were little more than fortified mansions, with walls of solid stone protecting a few peasants’ homes and the ruling family’s ancestral house; but this in front of him was much more than that. It seemed as much an object of art as it was a means of protection; everything from the barbicans above the footbridge to the machicolations on the ramparts seemed meticulously crafted in solid grey stone, while the covered parapet walk’s roof showed intricate and colourful motifs. The keep itself, massive as it was, cut an elegant figure across the cloudy sky, its pinnacles raised proudly. All in all it was an architectural marvel, and John very much feared that his astonishment was clearly visible.
Now that he had reassured himself of John’s continued existence he should have gone to the kitchens, to ascertain whether the servants had seen anything or anyone suspicious there, or to Mycroft, to discuss the situation and the measures that would have to be taken. The thought that John could reawaken at any moment to find him gone, however, made his inwards twist in a definitively unpleasant way, and he finally sent Billy on his way with a gold coin the kitchen boy gasped over before settling on the chair the boy had just left. There would be time to observe and deduce later – right now, ridiculously enough, nothing seemed quite as important as to make sure that John was safe and breathing.
“Si on me presse de dire pourquoi je l’aimais, je sens que cela ne se peut exprimer qu’en répondant: «Parce que c’était lui, parce que c’était moi.»”
There was simply too much noise, too many things to pay attention to, and surely Sherlock couldn’t be expected to think in such a maelstrom? He would have liked to scream at them to shut up, to turn away, but even he was aware of the impossibility of such a demand. John was stepping closer, though, and at this moment the shorter man seemed a broad-enough barrier to keep the rest on the world at bay; so closing his eyes, Sherlock concentrated on his knight’s solid, reassuring presence, on the light grip John had on his shoulder, on the calm rhythm of the man’s breathing and started thinking.
Before John could determine if he’d just been insulted or complimented or even thank the man for his help, he was alone once more. Shaking his head slightly to clear it, as any time spent with the mysterious man seemed to fill it with both unanswered queries, he knocked on Lady Hudson’s door.
“I doubt this young man will accept any of your rewards, Lord Astair. I do hope, however, that he will allow me to make him Assistant to the Court Physician – I hear you have always cultivated hope of following this noble profession, Sir Watson, and as I understand it your role as a Knight was a non-official trial that was to be over on the morrow.”
The reigning silence was soon broken by footsteps, however; and as he raised his head, he found that he was looking into inquiring grey eyes once again.
“Fine, Sherlock. I’ll indulge this little caprice of yours-” Sherlock frowned, there was this word again “-for two lunar cycles. A knight’s salary isn’t negligible, and I personally believe we have enough of them right now. So you’ll have to convince me that hiring this man was a necessary measure before your time runs out.”
It would have probably been better for the two of them if John had made Sherlock admit that the danger John was in was pretty minor and that he could leave their chambers without risking finding his knight a corpse when he returned – he was pretty sure that he could have convinced Sherlock, had he really tried. He had been held back, however, by the truly distressed look Sherlock sported every time he even brought up the idea; somehow John suspected that there was more to this than a need to make sure he was safe, but he couldn’t think of anything that’d make the other man feel insecure and desirous to spend all his spare time in his company.
The guard – Gregson – who had fairly puffed up with importance at the man’s first words, suddenly deflated.
“Yes, thank you very much Molly; here’s your payment, and you’ll find your mount a bit further on your right.”
Then the next morning he had taken four of the beautifully-carved white pawns and made them suffer a tragic demise in a truly horrific chemical experiment, and John had understood why the page he had asked for the board had been so hesitant about entrusting it to him.
The other man’s expression went through several emotions in the space of a second before it became perfectly blank once more.
John was admittedly aggravated by the Prince’s secrecy in those matters. Certainly they hadn’t known each other for a long time, but the enigmatic man had made him his Knight – did this title mean nothing? Remembering how the other man had denied him the knowledge of his identity in the first days of their acquaintance, he bitterly admitted to himself that he had been forewarned from the beginning. In spite of his beautiful speech, the Prince clearly didn’t trust him, either to have his back or to even know where he was going; this much was made clear with almost every action the Prince took.
“Your noble status is made obvious by your possession of both a horse and a sword, while your current lack of fortune is written all across your clothes. You’ve been showing signs for the latest hour that your boots, although clearly well-worn, still hurt your feet – it wouldn’t be the case it those were yours, so you’ve been given them for this trip, most likely from an older brother with feet smaller than yours. The bags I’ve seen on your mount indicate a five or six-days trip, but your horse is fresher than it should be, had you been travelling alone the whole time – no doubt someone from home accompanied you at first with at least another horse, ensuring the mounts wouldn’t get as tired. Your character is clearly discernible from your actions and words – you went to rescue someone because you heard a voice screaming from help, not because you wanted a fight. Still, you stayed and fought against seven people alongside me instead of fleeing, showing a certain brand of recklessness that certainly isn’t expanded to include other people’s life, as you abandoned the advantage your horse represented to make sure it would be safe – you should perhaps try and find it, by the way – and then thoroughly made it clear that I shouldn’t have risked Molly in this way. Your attitude to Molly was also very telling; that you called her Lady when she was obviously a servant girl with no falseness in your tone shows that you put mutual respect above the conventions dictated by our stiff social order.”
“I’m sure you do.” Mycroft slowly made his way to him from where he’d been standing at the window, eyebrow raised inquisitively, and Sherlock was abruptly reminded of everything that annoyed him in his older brother. “You do seem to have formed an unusual…attachment to this knight of yours.”
John followed reflexively before actually registering what the man had said. His eyes widened as his step faltered. Our rooms?
“Let me escort you to your new rooms. You’ll be able to get your luggage from Lady Hudson’s rooms later.”
“I have many witnesses ready to explain how you love to take a walk at a very precise hour every morning and evening, Colonel Moran, going through the kitchen to reach the forest shortly before the meals are served to the guests’ rooms. Do you confirm those are your habits?”
“I- hello. I’m staying with Lady Hudson during my stay at the castle, before hopefully joining the knights’ quarter, and I was looking for the kitchens to ask for directions. But what about you?” John blurted out, before rethinking the question. “I mean, do you…are you a knight yourself?”
“When Harry – or Harriet, should I say – was born, there were complications; my mother was told she wouldn’t be able to bear any more children. My father needed an heir, but loved his spouse too much to remarry, so he raised Harry as he would have done a son. I was born seven years later, but I was premature; and my father kept the charade until they were sure I was going to survive. By the time I was six and finally robust enough, it was too late. Harry is quite strong-willed, you see, and she enjoyed the freedom life as a boy afforded her. She liked sword-fighting far too much to drop it for embroidery and she categorically refused to ‘become a girl’. In any case, I believe she makes a far better heir than I would ever have done.” John smiled a little bitterly.
Sherlock had acknowledged that the results of this risky endeavour would probably be disappointing; the forest wasn’t sufficiently thick to allow him to follow Moran from close enough to be able to distinctly see the man receive his instructions through a message carried by man or bird or to listen to any eventual conversations. Yet when his prey turned around and went back to the castle without having made any effort to contact anyway he felt his fingers curl themselves slightly in frustration. He was reasonably certain Moran hadn’t known he was being tailed, and the familiarity the Colonel had with the path showed that this was indeed where he had been going every morning and every evening in the past two weeks. It may very well have been that Sherlock was merely unlucky – Moriarty only contacted his agent occasionally and Moran went everyday to avoid suspicion or because he ignored when he’d need to be in the forest.
John didn’t bother to point out to the man that there certainly wasn’t enough left of the night to constitute a “good night’s rest”, nor that even if there had been, he had never known the Prince to sleep more than three hours in a row. Instead he used what was probably the only weapon at his disposal.
“No, no, the place was filled. Sir Bolmir – Knight Bolmir, I should say – gave a convincing-enough performance to be considered able for the post.”
“In any case, there’s no need to discuss it now; there are still a few days until the end of the second lunar cycle you were allowed. I’ll upgrade security, especially around the kitchens, although you must understand that too much cautiousness would only vex our guests – something I cannot afford right now, with Princess Adler’s uncle’s mind poisoned against us by the colonel. He’d only be too willing to call off this wedding if we gave the slightest hint that we mistrust them.”
Even later, as they finally roused themselves, Sherlock received a missive he immediately held out to John: impossibly, Moran had escaped from his cell. Sherlock looked at his lover and smiled a slow, dangerous smile at him; Moriarty, he whispered, and John’s heart, unaccountably, skipped a beat. But then the smile directed at him turned a bit brighter, and Sherlock, uncharacteristically, tugged slightly on both of his hands:
“One of the modern written languages. The philosophers’ latest works reflect our societies’ change, John. The written word finally transcribes what our languages have become and the frontier between the analphabetic crowd and the man of letter is slowly but surely thinning. We’re heading towards a new world – and soon enough every child will be taught how to read.”
Although the other man didn’t dress anything like he’d expected the knights to, it’d at least explain the quality of both the man’s fencing and clothing, as well as the fact that the royal guard seemed to regard him with such reverence. The grey eyes seemed to dance a moment, as if they were amused by the query, before the man answered.
A long blink was the only visible indication of what Mycroft was already aware of; Princess Adler hadn’t known of every tradition surrounding a royal marriage in Baker Kingdom.
His answer was flippant but he was clearly shaken – at least to those who could read him. Seeing that, Mycroft softened a little.
His companion, who had casually started to sift through the ruffians’ belongings after tying them securely together, straightened to look at him, and he was struck anew by the particularity of the other man’s appearance. Although John was by no means a tall man, he had rarely met anyone who towered over him this way, and certainly he had never met so thin a man among expert fencers, as his interlocutor has proven to be. Very pale skin was made paler still by the contrast it presented to the man’s long black coat (again, of a quality he had seldom seen before), its lack of colour highlighting the light grey eyes that were steadily gazing at him.
“If I am to tell why I loved him, I feel it could only be expressed by answering “Because it was him, because it was me.” The…friendship between Montaigne and La Boétie is said by many to have been legendary.” Sherlock looked right at him then and John had to turn away from the piercing gaze; when he finally found it in himself to look back at the Prince, Sherlock had turned his attention back to the large opus in his hands and started reading aloud once more.
Sherlock couldn’t help his mouth tightening a little as he thought about what Moriarty had already done.
When the rain finally started falling, however, he found himself far too drenched to feel any kind of relief.
“In what? Saving my life? Stop saying such idiocies. Now if you were to apologize for your fool-hardiness I might accept, but I somehow believe it wouldn’t be sincere.”
“Perhaps no bond is as thick as the one existing between comrades in arms-” he couldn’t use his voice as a weapon like the Prince did, but he was still fairly sure that his irony came clearly across “-but surely the one between a Prince and his knight is thick enough to require trust.” And you didn’t deceive a person you trusted. This is what it all came down to, in the end; and John was determined to be steadfast on the subject. Nothing the Prince could say would make him reconsider; actually, if he even tried to bring up the matter of his high salary as a knight, John might well have to break the man’s nose, Prince or no Prince.
“But surely paying for Knight Watson’s salary will barely dent the generous donation sent by Count Bolmir.”
The silence that fell between them then was sudden to say the least and should probably have felt awkward, but it really didn’t – perhaps because they had both said all they needed to. Sherlock had offered his knight one of the keys necessary to understand the enigmatic man a little better and John had reciprocated by not directly acknowledging the rare gift it was; and somehow, nothing seemed to summarize their complicated relationship better than this moment.
The scene had painted himself in sharp colours against John’s closed lids as he listened and his heart hurt quite a bit as he almost saw the boys his land’s leaders had been and imagined them thrown much too early and much too alone in a world of power and politics. The idea of Mycroft using their late parents’ memories to get his little brother to listen to him was unpalatable, but then so was his mind’s vision of a young King who had had to change his very nature so as to conform to his parents’ wishes.
Before he could reassemble his thoughts enough to answer the difficult query, two men approached them, looking as if they had been walking for a while now.
Suddenly feeling the return of the deep fatigue that the strangeness of the events had kept at bay for the past hour and a half, John resolutely left in the other direction, whistling in order to call his mare.
“And to what do I owe this lack of courtesy, sir?” He asked, voice clipped, insisting on the title as if to remind the man across him of their existence. The grey eyes in front of him widened in obviously false surprise.
Much later – for once, the Prince hadn’t jumped from his bed at dawn, and not so much as a page had come to knock at their door – John awoke to find his nose engulfed in a warm and tickling nest of raven-black hair and a stupid smile already stuck on his lips.
“Billy. A-There’s a…John. Poison. Physician.” The Prince choked out. Billy did not waste time with questions – he dropped the laundry he still held, turned heels and ran. Another few seconds and the corridor was empty once more, except for a pile of dirtied sheets and the echo of a serving boy’s footsteps.
The Prince had indeed a tendency to disappear without a word, not only in daytime, but also at night – being a light sleeper, John often woke up to the sound of the door being shut as Sherlock left his room or again when he came back. He had first thought that the Prince was going off to see one of his lovers – perhaps Molly, the kitchen girl who had seemed so enamoured with him? But the Prince’s attire didn’t seem to corroborate this theory; he always left fully armed and when he came back his first action was often to meticulously clean and sharpen his blade, no matter the hour.
Having confirmed that in spite of his nerves trying to tell him otherwise his arm hadn’t nearly been ripped off his body, he closed his eyes in shame. His clumsiness had almost killed the person he had sworn to protect; what kind of knight stumbled over tree roots? The could-have-beens kept repeating themselves in his mind’s eye, in an unbearable but inescapable loop of agony. If he hadn’t been fast enough, the fifth man’s attack could well have felled the Prince. If his master hadn’t been such a skilled fencer, he could have been seriously hurt while battling two opponents.
His first source of bewilderment had been the Prince’s bedchambers; although the furniture was as richly decorated as one would expect from a royal bedroom, no one had seemingly tidied anything up in the last five years; his trying to do so, if only to access the bed and writing table that occupied the smaller room he was to have, was met with grudging acceptance at best and frank annoyance at worst from Sherlock.
“Well the only one I can remember seeing is the Princess’s lady, the nice one with the beautiful dress. I know she was there because she gave me a silver coin when I went to look for a basin for the Princess. A real silver coin, look!”
“My Lady, I wanted to thank you most sincerely for your kindness in letting me stay here. My mother sends her warmest regards, and this letter.”
The man didn’t reply to his badly-masked query for more details as to how he had known this, choosing instead to question him.
It was John’s turn to be astounded. He detailed Sherlock’s features carefully, despite knowing how little the man could be read. He had seen anger, or at least annoyance, flash across the Prince’s face as his brother addressed him often enough to think he could identify it, but he couldn’t see any in the pursued lips and deeply furrowed brow in front of him. The deep tenor voice didn’t sound angry either, but rather…panicked? John frowned a little, unconsciously mirroring Sherlock. That didn’t make any sense.
Again mystified by the man’s secretive answer, he only belatedly realised his guide had started moving down the corridor and had to hasten to catch up with the man’s long strides.
“You’ll learn my name soon enough, John – allow me to benefit from my glorious anonymity for a few more days. And now, I really must depart, before those thieves awake, and you need to find Alte. Good day, John; I have no doubt we’ll meet again soon.”
Even as he desperately tried to make sure his knight would live to see another moon, a small part of Sherlock’s mind couldn’t help but notice and analyse his own peculiar reactions. Elevated heart rate. Slightly clammy hands. A light-headed feeling not unlike vertigo. Those were all symptoms which would usually result from physical activity, but this couldn’t be the case right then. Could they really be the result of mere emotional distress? John could die, he thought experimentally, and his breath caught a little as the most extraordinary pain violently stabbed at his chest. Heart attack, he immediately diagnosed, but the pain didn’t repeat itself, merely slowly recessing and leaving a persisting ache behind. This truly was only his answer to the possibility of his knight’s demise. Fascinating.
“Perhaps we should adjourn the rest of the ceremony to tomorrow; I do believe our guests are tired. I’m looking forward to seeing you at our welcoming banquet tonight.”
He had tried to make Sherlock take interest in a game of chess; Sherlock had beaten him in five minutes and sighed a little in the way that meant he honestly pitied most of humanity for not having his brain. He had then made the Prince play without four of his main pieces; he had been checkmated in less than half-an-hour. He had finally forced Sherlock to sit with his back to the chessboard and announce aloud where his pieces should be set, which had amused him for about an afternoon as he beat John three more times.
The first fight opposed the Blond to Gangly Boy; it was quick and brutal. The lad seemed more anxious than ever and the first brutal thrust of his adversary’s sword made him stumble when he parried, leaving his left flank open for attack. As they had been told, the Blond then attacked the weakness with the flat of his blade; although it did little more to the boy than wind him a little, it meant he had lost the fight.
It also meant that he was one of the first to reach Princess Adler’s side when she turned extremely pale and softly slumped over the side of her throne, her knife clattering harmlessly on the floor.
“Please, Sire, let me take a look at it. You’ve already deduced I had some training in the healing arts and-”
“I’m sure, Gregson.” The guard paled a little at the imperious tone, immediately saluting and leaving. John’s attention instantaneously focused on the other man, more than a bit surprised.
And yet…As he parried a blow that certainly wasn’t a part of regular fencing – but then he had hardly expected them to play by the rules – John registered that two of their opponents were already on the ground and that a third would soon join them. The other man certainly could hold his own in a row, but it was more than that: their fighting styles simply suited each other, and John found himself marvelling that he could have found such a perfect battle partner so far from home and in such bizarre circumstances.
Before the Physician - and therefore Lord Astair and a good part of the onlookers - could start to panic, John saw the King raise a calm hand and, bewilderingly, turn to him. And even though he couldn’t fathom what this latest development meant, he knew what he had to do – and thus, ignoring Sherlock’s unreadable look, he offered Physician Thompson the small bottle he had found on his pillow three days sooner, accompanied with an enigmatic note – “Just in case”.
The dark-haired not-quite-stranger that wasn’t at all a stranger or even a knight must have replied something but John didn’t hear it, occupied as he was to realise the depth of his blindness and naïveté. The man that had approached them had his face engraved on every single one of his purse’s coins, and there was only one person named Sherlock that he could think of.
“Sh-” The rest of the man’s name proved to be too much for him and he started to cough painfully, his throat parched. Spying a glass of water on a nearby table he gestured a little towards it, feeling relief as the Prince pressed it in his hand a short while later. The cool liquid felt rather heavenly as it slid down his throat and he tried with limited success to blink his gratefulness at his friend.
“They married Harriet far under her station, hoping the promise of a title would allow them to avoid the young bride making a scandal, and it did. The last I heard, Clara and my sister were living quite happily together.”
Bewildered by the numerous smells fighting for his nostrils’ attention – some more pleasant than others – and by all the noise around him, John began to make his way very slowly through the crowd. His anxiety, which had been steadily rising along with the number of miles that separated him from home, reached its peak as he guided Alte between the market stalls, ignoring the merchants’ calls to him the best he could.
“John.” Suddenly the grey eyes were back; except in the ways that they weren’t. Because they didn’t belong to a strange man appearing from around a bush anymore, or even to a knight defending him against a guard. They belonged to a Prince. The Prince. Prince Sherlock.
“Considering the Princess of Bohemia is expected to arrive in the week and our activities will then mostly consist in an endless stream of boring diplomatic matters, I’m quite certain we’ll manage.”
The two men knew by now just what they were capable of together: the row should have been over promptly, and for a while it seemed this way; but then everything went wrong very quickly. John stumbled on a tree’s large root. Sherlock whirled around in concern, blocking the attack coming from his right while doing so. A man they had both thought incapacitated painfully got himself up on his elbow and tried to stab at the Prince’s shin. His aim was off but it was enough to distract Sherlock, and John’s throat closed off as he saw that their fifth opponent, who had stayed a bit outside the fight until then, was about to take advantage of the Prince’s momentary lapse of attention. Rather than scream a warning the knight literally threw himself at the attacking man, heedless of the danger involved in such a daring move. Brutally shoving the Prince aside, he tried and failed to repel the blow, biting his lower lip hard enough to taste blood as the sword left a trail of fire-like pain in his left shoulder. Immediately pressing his hand to the deep gash there, he stumbled against the large tree they had been fighting under as the Prince defeated their two remaining adversaries faster than even his trained eyes would follow.
He blinked and found that the scene had changed once more; Ella had put John in a half-sitting position and was now impatiently gesturing at his knight’s feet.
“And the reason why there are no Prince’s Knights is because you ardently refused to even consider the idea the last seven times it was suggested.”
“A likely story, boy-” here John bristled; he had already lived through twenty-seven springs, and surely the man couldn’t be much older than he was. “The kitchens are in the opposite direction, so I dare say you must have got more than ‘a little lost’ to get here. Now tell me the truth: what are you doing here, huh? Looking for something to bring home? Or did you have something more nefarious in mind?”
The sound was a growl rather than a word as the Regent of Bohemia surged to his feet, standing protectively over the body of the fallen Princess, drawing up his sword and pointing it at King Mycroft, The Freak Prince and the Prince’s knight in a smooth movement that belied his age.
Fighting the pull of sleep wasn’t easy, but he was fuelled by his anger and determination, and as the Prince silently shut the door after himself a little after dawn, he was still awake. He crossed the room in two steps and, made daring by his sleepless night, seized the Prince’s arm. Before he could speak, however – to say what, he certainly had no idea – his thoughts derailed.
The world seemed to tilt a bit to the side; John dimly thought he should get used to this sensation, considering it seemed to happen often enough when near the Prince.
This meant that Mycroft had missed the hidden depths of this man, even after a second glance. A delighted smile curled the Prince’s thin lips. He now had the proof that he’d been right; learning to read and understand John Watson was going to be the most interesting challenge he had had in a while – and once he was done, surely John could become part of the royal knights or something, so that he didn’t have to bother with the other man anymore.
“Indeed. A most dangerous man, from what I understand. Yet he’s not the one we should truly concern ourselves with. There’s been talk of another, more sinister individual…”
Most of the knights obviously didn’t know how to react to this strange version of what was basically a teaching exchange, but the man who had explained the rules to them and was clearly the fencing master was looking at Gangly Boy with a new light in his eyes, so John considered his goal achieved.
“Oh, what a wonderful fight this was! And what dashing figures you struck! I can’t thank you enough, Sire, and you, sir?”
Reassured now that there was no way the other man was going to leave the castle before Sherlock had him completely figured out, the Prince went in search of someone to annoy, wondering if Captain Lestrade would terribly mind Sherlock pointing out every little thing that the guard had done wrong on its last mission; it was one of his favourite activities.
“You’re being quite unfair, brother of mine. If your spies did their job correctly you’d know that John Watson’s arm was injured as he tried to save my life – and certainly even you wouldn’t blame him for being poisoned. For all we know the cup was altered because the culpable thought I intended to drink it.”
He absently let his hand rest on his knight’s forehead as he thought, a whisper of a smile touching his lips as the lines on John’s face faded a little at the coolness of the touch. According to Physician Thompson, John had fallen into a healing sleep and wouldn’t wake for hours, but Sherlock still found himself strangely reluctant to leave the sick man’s bedside. He nonetheless called Billy, who’d been hovering near the door with his eyes wide open all the while, to take over his task. He had some work to do after all. The attacker, whoever he or she was, had made a grave mistake. Because he’d stop at nothing to find out who had hurt his knight.
In the end, it was a good fight; the duel lasted close to fifteen minutes, and it certainly didn’t lack in animation for the knights standing around. John’s adversary was lithe and fast, making up in agility what he didn’t have in strength; he was as imaginative and tricky as the Blond had been conventional, and his fighting style was actually a lot like John’s. In the end, John reflected ruefully from his position on the ground, it had come down to experience. He couldn’t help but feel disappointed, however, and he must have looked forlorn indeed because his adversary held out a hand for him to take.
Almost as a last resort he had tried to engage Sherlock in what had to be the main topic of conversation everywhere in the castle outside their rooms, wondering aloud which type of financial and military bond for the two Kingdoms would be announced by the new couple as they took their vows and rejoicing in the idea of eating the traditional rich fare at the feast. Sherlock had first raised a brow at his extensive knowledge about traditional bonds before enjoining him to stop “trying to fill his mind with useless information” and engaging in a truly bewildering explanation (somehow including attics) of why he certainly couldn’t afford to remember just how many days a royal ceremony was supposed to last (five, although two were considered as the heart of the ritual) or the ingredients in the traditional soup that would be served on the day of the official bonding (even though he did raise his head when he heard John talking about Ellebora leaves, especially as the knight explained only the royal table was served the soup containing the potentially poisonous plant, laying it back down when he heard the recipe included no more than a single symbolic leaf).
No matter how much he liked the tired feeling that came after a fight or the happiness brought by teaching, nothing quite beat feeling that you had had a part in saving a life: this was something that he believed in, something that he knew. And yet he couldn’t just say it, because not making it as a knight had been a disappointment. Leaving his hometown for the first time had made him realize what he was missing out; now that he knew he’s soon have to leave, he found that he wanted to have the chance to say that he knew the capital, no matter how big the city was, he wanted to take revenge on that guard that had deliberately misled him, he wanted to live adventures such as the one told by the beards. He wanted to get that mysterious man better.
“I’m terribly sorry, Guard – I never meant to intrude. I wanted to find the kitchens and was given directions to them, but I must have gotten lost.”
“No it didn’t. However, it did have to do with the fact that our allies are getting sparser, our enemies stronger and that ensuring Count Bolmir’s loyalty was essential to preserve this Kingdom’s continual survival, Sherlock!”
“A distant uncle from the Princess, and a trusted friend of her late father. His mind, however, seems to have been slowly poisoned by his closest confident – a certain Sebastian Moran, I believe.”
Still, he knew that he couldn’t win if the fight became a duel of endurance, so he took a risk, brutally breaking the steady rhythm of thrust/parry/counter-attack they had fallen into by stepping forward, coming close to skewering himself on the other blade before disarming his surprised opponent and pointing his sword at the Blond’s throat.  In his mind he could hear a smooth voice declaring ‘And though easily worried about other people’s safety, you have but little concern for yours’ and it made him smile.
“I do believe this scratch has been beaten in submission by the three layers of bandage you’ve wrapped around it.” A slight tightening of the said bandage – clearly a warning – was his only answer, and inexplicably he found himself fighting a smile yet again. “We should both find some rest now.”
“Spit it out, John. My knight won’t be beaten by some chemical substance. Come on, I thought you were actually looking forward to the ridiculous celebrations next week? You must be the only person in this castle that does. I’m almost certain Mycroft expects you to make sure I behave for the wedding, and you shouldn’t disappoint your King. Believe me, he’s a vindictive man.”
Sherlock only nodded, his lips narrowed in thought, as he rose from the chair he had sat in across the girl, absently holding out a gold coin to her. He barely took notice of her widened eyes and enthusiastic thanks, the facts already repeating themselves endlessly in his mind. He was clearly missing a large part of this particular puzzle – and he knew precisely who could enlighten him.
“He has a point there.” Was murmured in her ear, and Sally startled a little before turning to see Anderson had apparently abandoned his post by the main door to see what the commotion was about. If the poisoner’s goal was to throw the castle into chaos, she reflected wryly, their methods were certainly efficient.
But why such an attack? Poison slipped in a mug of ale, this certainly felt personal. John had only been in the capital for less than two lunar cycles – who could have desired revenge? A slighted lover wasn’t likely – Sherlock would have noticed if John had found someone deserving of his attention. He also doubted John had actual enemies, considering how ridiculously good-natured the man was. No, this was certainly an attempt to make Sherlock react – here he had to pause in his reflexions to unclench his fist, quite surprised to feel his nails had made themselves at home in the skin of his palm. To scare him, perhaps. To warn him? It didn’t make much sense, considering Sherlock wasn’t working on any case for the King right now, having refused the four last ones offered to him as being too boring before carefully avoiding his brother’s smirk as the larger man implied without a word that his ennui had more to do with his knight’s hurt shoulder than the Prince would like to admit.
Stubbornly he blinked again, placing a shaking hand on the bed beside him and trying to raise his body a little from where he felt like he was drowning in a too-soft pillow. The hand that took hold of his right elbow was unexpected but welcome, especially as he instantly recognised the spindly fingers holding him up. Part of him loosened in relief as he established that the Prince hadn’t been poisoned as well and as he finally managed to open his eyes he found that he already had a small smile on his face.
The other man raised a brow, acknowledging and choosing to address the clear challenge John’s words had represented.
Surely enough, the Prince and his knight soon found themselves engaged in a fight with five surprised ruffians. No matter how many times the scenario repeated itself, John kept forgetting the sense of utter rightness permeating their fights alongside each other, or perhaps convinced himself that his memory had to be flawed. And yet here it was again, as always, this easy camaraderie that according to all accounts shouldn’t have existed after little more than a lunar cycle of knowing each other.
“And you honour us with your presence, my Lady. Nevertheless, I would appreciate to know where my fiancée is.”
“I’m sorry that inflexible traditions will keep her from participating to the two main feasts from as close as you’d perhaps prefer, but I assure you she’ll enjoy the table she’ll be sat at. I’ve also noticed you haven’t brought any secondary taster with you, so I’ve taken the liberty of assigning you one of ours for the two evenings of the ceremony.”
The other knights jeered a little, obviously amused by how quick the fight had been; and as John took the Blond’s place for his own fight, he felt a little irritated. The older gentleman had done nothing out of the rules, he had won fair and square; but John still felt as if it had been cruel to treat this fight as an inconvenience to be done with as quickly as possible. He was himself of the opinion that the boy in front of him was far from ready to be a knight, but he had also seen potential in his first parry and in his almost-perfect posture – he didn’t like the idea that after this second match the boy would be sent home in disgrace, probably convinced of his own worthlessness.
John sighed. "Fine." He said with a nod. He looked around and, as Sherlock suspected, he sat on his -
handle those 7 books he found and he managed to pick them up, which he found really surprising. But he couldn't see anything, not even the pile of books he tripped with. He fell and so did the books, causing a very loud noise. Sherlock turned and there it was again, John was blushing. "Dear lord, Watson. What is your damn problem?" He said between laughing and annoyed, as he stood up.
John never needed a friend as much as he needed one now. But he didn't have one. Mike wouldn't want to listen. Maybe he would, but John wouldn't tell him anyway. The only person in the world he felt he trusted enough to tell him his problems was Sherlock. Well, the
John nodded while paying attention to the meal. "Yeah, wanted to surprise you. Since you never eat during cases, I thought I could force you to do it so."
After a quick ride on a taxi, Sherlock arrived to the commissary, where a man saluted him in a rush and got him inside the police patrol immediately.
"You-", John was starting to lose control, now not even bothering with hiding his trembling hand, it looked as if all of John's body was trembling with rage and if Sherlock saw a couple of tears starting to strain John's eyes, he preferred not to focus on them. "You made me see you die. You-", he turned to point at the tape, "jumped in front of me? I couldn't I- how, how could you do that?"
over, more than over, actually. They both had been quite clear at the party, or so Sherlock thought, he didn't remember much of what he had said, but he remembered John's words clearly. It was painful, yet when they talked to each other at class, Sherlock held some hopes, he wanted to feel as if nothing had changed.
, because this was filled with something, filled with hope, filled with certainty and John was amazed to discover he wasn't scared anymore, he didn't doubt, didn't hesitate, didn't even think, he just
John looked at the naked silhouette that the portrait depicted. “Yes, I can see that”, he smiled without wanting to. It looked like a wonderful drawing Sherlock was doing.
The man shook his head and spoke to both Sherlock and John. "Sorry, as I told you the first class the rules are unchangeable. The first thing I said about the project is that it is in couples so there is absolutely no way I'm changing my mind. And Holmes, you better start liking working with somebody, because you'll have to get used to that."
On Wednesday, after two very long days of school in which everything and everyone reminded him of Sherlock and the happy couple and how wonderful they looked, John arrived home. Before, he preferred a thousand times staying at school and not coming back to his house because he was incredibly lonely, but now school was even more lonely and all he longed for all day long was going home and leaving everything behind.
He locked the phone again, and got into the living room. Mycroft was sitting in Sherlock's chair, reading the newspaper, Sherlock looked at him with an expression of unpleasant surprise. "For God's sake! What are you doing here?"
To say that he was anxious would be an understatement. He had spent the last couple of days regretting the fact he had asked Sherlock to teach him over and over. He knew he had acted on impulse, and he usually liked acting on impulse (wasn’t that what artists did sometimes? Acting on impulse often led to masterpieces…or to total failures), but after Sherlock had agreed and after the excitement had died out, John realized he had made one big mistake.
He rushed and grabbed her by the arm. "I'm sorry. Please. I'm just... I'm worried about him. I shouldn't have said that. I know you're recovering and you're doing great and forgive me."
Jim Moriarty disappeared. Jim Moriarty had never been there in the first place, he knew it. But he couldn't convince his body of it, he started shivering harder, his heart beating faster, his head aching, he felt dizzy, he might be falling into the ground, he couldn't tell.
Dr. Hawthorne shrugged. "No. It doesn't ring a bell. Now come, we need to collect the mementos and start recording."
John walked off from the cafeteria and unconsciously, he took the same path he always took to go to Chemistry Club, and just as he turned one of the corners, he found the greaser, seating in the same chair as the day before, reading the same book, and incredibly focused. In the moment he saw John he exhaled loudly and closed the book. John tried to pull a little (but fake) smile and told himself to be patient.
"I'm tired of this. My parents don't seem to care, and she is only getting worse and worse and I can't help her. And I feel... Powerless."
"Leave me alone! Leave me in peace! It's the only thing you can do to help now!" John shouted, and Sherlock stood still, staring at him, then he frowned.
"Do you want to know how to make things right? Start by stop acting like a fucking asshole, because that's all you've done. And try and talk to him. And last but not least, break up with that hot girlfriend of yours, because it's more than obvious that you don't love her at
Greg raised an eyebrow, surprised. Sherlock never accepted help and would play stubborn, but now he seemed too put down to protest.  Finally he turned to the door. "I'll be right back."
A second later, Sherlock's eyes roamed down and found John's as John encircled his cock with his mouth.
Apparently the smile wasn't enough to conceal his disappointment, because Greg realised John actually
He grabbed the stack of folders Lestrade had brought him as soon as he came back from the death. Cold cases from his time away. That would keep John enternained for long enough. He smiled as he placed them onto John's lap.
Oh god, was he? Was this all their goodbye? their closure? was it his way of getting over Sherlock? Was that why he was crying? Because this would be it?
John laughed that kind of terrifying laugh he did when he was furious. "Fun." He snorted. "Well, I hope you had the fucking time of your life. Dad lost it and beat mom and I while you were just having fun!", he said.
He was tired of looking at the same four walls, he felt sick of looking at them. He needed to get out, even though he hated the London weather right now, he had to do something before he died of boredom in his house.
It was past five when John left school, since Harry wasn't able to drive, Clara used to take her everywhere, and John enjoyed those moments of solitude when it was just him and his Chevy, driving over the fields. Although it was a very short ride, he enjoyed it, he really did.
He really couldn't care less about lunch, but Mike invited him to his table and it was fine. Except for Mike, he didn't have any other friends, he wasn't very good at socializing, and the few people he barely talked to, it was because he had met them through his sister. To be honest, he didn't really feel the need to have friends, he had books, and that was all he needed.
His brain turned on again, for a single second, and his hand moved on to the grip, holding tightly the other hand.
Sherlock snuggled in and tucked himself under the covers, going through a thousand thoughts in his mind, that were hauling him over and over and over. That until John shifted and placed a hand over Sherlock's stomach, holding him, almost
The detective inspector stared at John, startled. John remembered perfectly what the case had been about, yet he had said it had been Greg who found them and not Sherlock. What the hell was going on with John?
But instead of a kiss, Sherlock felt one of the erasers hitting his black leather jacket, and suddenly everything was white and John was coughing while he laughed and well... Sherlock's jacket was ruined.
And Sherlock felt himself trembling under his glare. For a long moment there was nothing but silence in the room, both of them looking at each other, John's eyes never leaving Sherlock's, as if he could find all the answers there.
"No, it's fine, I'll be fine." He said, attempting to smile and poorly accomplishing it. Without muttering another word, he turned and went to his medical office.
John dragged a deep breath and broke the silence. "I had a dream-", he stopped talking and bit his lip, looking down.
And as the eyes of the Lady in question glistened with tears for the very first time this evening, as John whirled to look at her, more hurt and confused than ever, Sherlock finally made his exit.
“I…I cannot seem to know if this bothers me. Surely justice has to be done; and yet, knowing that, no matter how inadvertently, I was part of those men’s arrests…”
Lord Astair reluctantly stepped back as the Royal Physician quickly knelt near the Princess but didn’t draw back his sword, throwing wild accusing glances to anyone who’d meet his eyes and not ceasing in his vituperations.
As always, this strange tension. It shivered through the room, curdled along his spine, whispered inaudibly of battlefields he had never seen and never thought he’d want to see.
Sherlock could almost follow John’s train of thoughts as the other man remembered the circumstances of their first meeting and – finally – realised why the prince of his kingdom had been chasing bandits alone.
This night, when Sherlock silently rose from his bed and left, John sat up. It was too much. He had taken too many superior or pitying looks, too many derisive remarks about him being lucky to be so highly paid for a job that didn’t seem to entail more than being stared at or talked to a few hours a day, too many blush-inducing whispers about why the Prince did keep him around. He had enough.
Sherlock showed no outward reaction whatsoever, even as he almost heard the last part of the trap that had been slowly enclosing on them click into place, when Lord Astair gave voice to the suspicions his confident had patiently nurtured in him in the last weeks, or perhaps months. Their opponent had finally showed his hand, and his move was a bold one – a poisoning that ignored her taster to touch the Princess only, a poison which had found its way to a plate resting between Mycroft’s and his without them noticing anything.
“Certainly they would have. Their only question would have been to know why it hadn’t happened sooner and what I was waiting for to follow in my dear big brother’s humongous footsteps.”
The Prince stayed at his side as she expertly applied a poultice and dressed the wound, an unmoving and silent presence that attracted more than a few raised eyebrows from the obviously curious woman. John had thought that by now the news the Prince had “acquired” a knight had circled the castle, but either he had overestimated the rumour mills’ power or Ella, as she had asked to be called, didn’t listen to gossip.
“Lady Sarah is settling in fine as well, then? I understand such a change in ventures can destabilise even the sturdiest soul.”
“Sit down and stop acting like a petulant child. I have to put a dressing on this if you don’t want it to scar durably.”
His display of courtesy was a mistake; thinking himself mocked, the young man adopted a full-out sneer.
“You’re the second son of a noble, though quite poor, family, and your own wish was to become a local physician. Your father, however, wanted you to become a royal knight, and therefore you have learnt to fight, and fight well, and are now on your way to the centre of our kingdom. You’ve been travelling for five days now, but you’ve only been travelling alone for three. Even though I don’t think you’re quite bloodthirsty enough to be a knight, you possess the nobility of heart which is supposedly a condition for knighthood-” a sneer, there, indicated that the man strongly doubted that point “and though easily worried about other people’s safety, you have but little concern for yours. You also hold the conventions supposed by the social order rather lightly, although you treat everyone with respect.”
Sherlock suddenly seemed younger than he had ever had, even tugging absently at his hair, a nervous habit John had never seen him indulge in before. John wasn’t certain how to answer – thankfully, it appeared what Sherlock really needed was for someone to listen.
“Was it? Then I must definitively congratulate you on the successful arrest of this suspicious individual, Gregson. I’ll take care of the rest – return to your post.”
Mycroft blinked. Sherlock didn’t know if it was because he wasn’t supposed to know this or if it was because he seldom expressed interest in any underhanded deals his brother partook in.
“They always had trouble understanding us – the way we saw the world was certainly quite alien to them. Ironically enough, Mycroft was my only ally then; the only one who got it. It changed as they died, though. Mycroft was only 16, but all of a sudden he was the King, not just my brother. He had no more time for the experiments we used to escape from our lessons to conduct. He started talking politics, when before we had both held them for boring. And when he understood that it was the only thing that would work, he began using our parents’ memories to make me listen to him. ‘Sherlock, don’t act so rebellious, you know how it all upset Mummy.’ ‘Father wouldn’t have wanted you to react this way, Sherlock.’”
He’d have liked to explain to her supercilious smirk just why his silence was more than cowardice or simple loyalty to his employer; but truthfully, he didn’t know how to explain or if there even was something to explain, so he simply let his mouth close and his brow furrow slightly. The young woman seemed satisfied by his lack of answer and her mouth became a genuine smile.
“Trample around gracelessly and inefficiently, as is their way, effectively warning our miscreants that they should either be more discreet or make themselves scarce from this part of the woods entirely, after which they would have started to strike on grounds much less protected. I think not.”
“You were poisoned. Belladonna extract, if we’re to believe Physician Thompson, but not a truly dangerous amount – she didn’t administer morphine. You’ve been out for a few hours and I have a few rather urgent questions to ask you.”
This was totally inefficient, his mind berated him even as he pressed two long fingers to John’s neck. His knight’s mind wasn’t flinching away from an emotional shock, it had been driven away by poison; addressing him would make no difference to his current state. And yet, even as he tried ineffectually to make the other man’s body reject the noxious substance, he couldn’t hold back the litany of nonsensical words that emerged from his lips.
Except for the Princess’s warning about the dangers she thought herself to be in, they hadn’t talked alone since the delegation’s arrival.
John was well-aware that his astonishment had to be clearly and inelegantly visible, but he simply couldn’t stop his mouth from opening slightly.
Sherlock’s mood reflected others’ for once – tension was spreading on the castle as the wedding approached, a dark feeling far from the joyful anticipation John had been vaguely expecting. A metaphorical storm seemed to be slowly brewing and he found himself wishing more than once that it would finally unleash itself, no matter the casualties.
After living in the castle for one month and a half, John really shouldn’t have been surprised by the time it took the approaching cortège to enter the fortress, but he was anyway. The welcoming party he belonged to had had to stand for what seemed like hours as Bohemian guards and guests slowly made their way into the building and John had wished more than once that he’d be allowed to get back inside and rest his feet a little. To distract himself, he started observing the rather magnificent show the colour of the noblewomen’ dresses created and even tried to apply what little he had learnt of Sherlock’s method to know more about the people whose eyes he met, with little success however.
Sherlock was practically unmoving except for his long, agile fingers, whose slightly jerky movements revealed his anxiety as they fluttered away and drew half-shaped forms to punctuate his story. At first John found himself at a loss of what he could possibly answer this strange and unknown version of his master, who seemed more vulnerable and yet more tightly-guarded than ever before. But truly, only one thing could ever only distract the Prince – and so John did his best to present him with a mystery that could effectively attract his attention.
John wondered dazedly if this getting-to-know-you thing included a bed before snapping back to his senses. And then he realised that he had beautifully lost this argument.
“Keep your trap shut and let me listen – this is getting interesting.” She ordered, shivering just the slightest as that made him chuckle against her neck.
John didn’t quite know what he had expected to find when he finally arrived at the capital. A castle, certainly – one big enough to contain the royal family and the guards and whoever else was needed to make sure their government could function. Houses around the castle, surely, lavish and complicated because they belonged to the richest nobles. But although he had come upon a sign informing him that he was indeed in the capital of the Baker Kingdom, there was so castle in sight; instead, he had apparently come upon a gigantic market in which his whole hometown could have easily fit, and this included his family’s decrepit mansion.
“This is Sir John Watson – Knight John Watson, actually. I’ve decided to make him part of the Prince’s Knights.”
The question was asked rather abruptly, but the hands putting the dressing around his arm stayed extremely gentle. It was all very fascinating.
“Although most of those missions barely represent a challenge of any sort, I agreed to fulfil them for the rare few that come around with some interesting features. It certainly has nothing to do with my brother.”
It was ungracefully that he had finally admitted to himself that the answer to this particular mystery eluded him, but admit it he had – and that’s why he was now very carefully following the traces of Colonel Moran in the forest outside the south side of the castle, aware even as he cautiously made his way on the well-trodden path the man had created in the last two weeks that he might well be – oh, the indignity – walking into a trap.
John was torn between being relieved – considering he was apparently Sherlock’s only confident as well as his knight he was expected to attend the meetings his master did, no matter that it should have been the role of the Prince’s manservant, but he didn’t have access to a comfortable chair - and a bit disappointed, as the two meetings they had been forced to join in had allowed him to commiserate in lowered voices with Princess Adler’s confident, Lady Sarah, over what it meant to serve a master with such unusual character. Considering that both official gatherings had put Sherlock in the blackest mood he had yet to see the Prince in he finally settled on grateful, even if the absence of cases and John’s inability to make a decent sparring partner with his hurt arm meant Sherlock was often dreadfully bored and therefore terribly annoying.
After congratulating him on managing to keep the wound from bleeding too much and asking if he had ever received medical training – Sherlock smirked a little then – she pronounced him fit to go, recommending that he didn’t move his arm around for half a lunar cycle, longer if he could help it. He tensed a bit at the news, wondering anew what use he would be to his master without his dominant arm, but his dark thoughts were interrupted by a hand briefly holding and shaking his (right) shoulder.
Another consequence of his lengthy fight was that the Blond was definitively taking him seriously now, he found out as the third fight began. Neither of them really knew just how good the other was, so they started with cautious tests and rather slow movements, but quickly enough the fight began in earnest. The other man was a good fencer, solidly built and obviously very enduring, John acknowledged, but he was unimaginative; he wouldn’t have lasted a minute in a brawl, where the rules of fencing duels were only known so they could be ignored more effectively.
The following days were full of a tension John didn’t understand. He had at first feared that Sherlock hadn’t been sincere when assuring him that he didn’t consider the incident his fault, but he had soon come to realize that it was rather tied to Princess Adler’s impending arrival. He had asked the Prince whether he knew her personally, but while Sherlock’s answer of “Had a case concerning her once.” certainly made it seem like there was a story there, it also appeared to John that the problem went deeper.
He had even asked Lady Hudson to give them the pleasure of her company for a cup of tea, but while watching her interact with the boy she had more-or-less raised and reminisce on a few childhood anecdotes about the two brothers had been fascinating, her well-meant cooing over his still-tired form and the disapproving glances she had shot at their untidy bedchambers had left him too exhausted to want to repeat the experience anytime soon.
It simply didn’t make any sense. If the Prince wanted to train, why would he do so in the middle of the darkest hours? If he was engaged in a fight, who did he fight against and why did no news of his action reach them by the light of the day?
The world must have titled five degrees off its axis then, because John clearly heard the Prince answer.
Surprisingly this latest activity seemed to interest the Prince enough to make sure that he’d stay still for the rest of the afternoon and John soon relaxed in the armchair he had dragged by the fire, the unknown words forming a strange melody as Sherlock kept reading. He never saw the Prince’s brow unwillingly relax from the concentrated frown it had settled in as he raised his head from his book to find John fast asleep, never heard him quietly lay the tome aside and cross the room to leave, never felt the touch of the three fingertips Sherlock had let brush his forehead for a mere second.
The boy who had been emptying the nearest bedchambers of their dirty laundry was rather surprised to see the Prince leave his room mere seconds after entering it, and more surprised still to have his shoulder grasped by a vice-like hand.
It was a totally novel experience, and yet a ridiculously recognizable one. It also seemed to him to have been what he had been searching for his whole life, he whispered between kisses as they tumbled into bed, guessing rather than seeing Sherlock’s raised eyebrow at this absurd notion in the darkened room, feeling against his neck the smile the Prince couldn’t contain.
Just as in many other places, Sherlock knew exactly whom to talk to in order to determine if anything suspicious had happened in the royal kitchens. Janet was a tiny wisp of a girl, looking no more than nine when she was soon to be fourteen and more often sick than in good health. The main cook had an uncharacteristic weakness for the girl’s pale blue eyes and more often than not Janet’s only duties for the day were to make sure that the fire wouldn’t go out and occasionally to stir the large pot of soup that simmered perpetually in the kitchens. Although the girl was grateful for the reprieve she was also quite often bored and made it a game of hers to observe what happened around her – a habit Sherlock encouraged and sometimes rewarded with a few sweets or coins. It certainly wasn’t the first time he had used the girl’s testimony in one of his cases – this time, however, the young girl didn’t have much to tell him.
“Now I understand – this is your latest incentive to get me to do what you want. Be more obedient, Sherlock, and you’ll get to keep your knight. Rather naïve of you, however, to think that I wouldn’t be able to ensure John’s continued presence by myself.”
“No matter how remarkable Princess Adler is, as a woman she can’t truly have power over Bohemia before she marries. Hence our rushed engagement.”
Belatedly remembering his manners, he took a short bow, an action which painted the servant girl’s cheeks a lovely pink.
Bewildered anew, John watched as a young woman, clearly a member of the servant class, came stumbling from the nearest bush. He started to reach out to her in concern as he saw she was trembling faintly, but as she let out an enthusiastic little giggle he realised that she was reacting to excitement rather than fright.
“So it would be correct to assume that if you had both been led to consume a little of a certain ingredient every morning and every evening during your entire stay here, an ingredient that would interact negatively with a dish only served at the royal table, she’d be the only guest to suffer from such an interaction?”
All seemed to stand still once more as the Prince sifted through the herbs contained in the Regent’s advisor’s bag only to hold up a few small violet flowers with long stems and dark leaves.
John blinked a few times as he tried to register this flow of information; finally, he found his voice again.
Moran’s forays into the woods, twice a day. John, on the floor, pale and barely breathing. The only thing I know is that her taster is fine and you’re the only two who had access to her plate! Lady Sarah’s presence in the kitchen. Only the freshest ingredients, and I picked the Ellebora leaf for the soup myself Sire, I swear! Lady Sarah, at John’s bedside after his poisoning. The brew was under constant surveillance! Irene’s disguise. The Princess looks tired, Sherlock, don’t you think? John had asked as they waited for her to make her way through the hall to reach her future husband. Moriarty. The table where Lady Sarah and Moran had both been eating, a respectful twenty-five feet away from the royal table - none of them had gotten up during the feast. I only regret traditions keep me from having Lady Sarah next to me on this fine day, Irene had murmured when Mycroft had asked her if all was well. The only thing I know is that her taster is fine! His own unsuccessful following of Moran in the woods the day before. John’s rueful look as Sherlock dismissed his explanations of the royal wedding’s ceremonial rituals as irrelevant.
At first everything seemed fine – Bohemia’s regent and King Mycroft exchanged welcomes and pleasantries in a cordial tone while Sherlock, bored out of his mind, drummed his long fingers on the side of his smaller throne and shot John exasperated glances he answered with tolerant smiles. A certain tension nonetheless permeated the room, and everything came as a standstill as it was the Princess’s turn to advance towards her hosts. She seemed even more nervous than she had when riding, John noted with sympathy, even trembling a little.
“Having a little fun, Melchior? I’m sure Sir Rave would be glad to hear his stable boys are efficient enough to take time off to work to rib newcomers and still finish their work on time.”
“If you get tired of being around him all the time, just drop by the kitchen and ask for my name – I’m always around anyway.”
“It was an honour fighting with you against those ruffians – seldom have I met a man on whom I could depend so completely in a row. I would be much obliged if you’d let me offer you the opportunity to fight alongside me on a regular basis.”
The guard didn’t seem terribly impressed by his polite and earnest tone, nor did he seem intimidated by John’s instinctive defensive posture as his hand came near the hilt of his sword.
John’s eyes flew to meet his at that, clearly uncertain, but for once Sherlock didn’t want to meet them as Mycroft’s total victory was made totally clear. Sherlock may have seemed to direct the events this evening, but his brother had obviously known about the poison, and sufficiently in advance to make sure he’d be able to make good on his threat to steal John from him even as he cured his fiancée.
“As another second child, I understand the feeling of always being compared to one’s elder and being found lacking. Yet consider that your sibling was at least another boy.”
Sherlock straightened a little on his armchair, obviously interested in this unusual titbit of information about his childhood.
Sherlock thought of sarcastically asking whether John knew many Mycrofts, but figured it was rather a bad idea to annoy someone who had his hands less than two inches away from your wounded arm.
And the lad did; not perfectly, but with surprising strength considering his lanky form. He had left his left side open to attack once again but John didn’t end the fight; he did, however, make an aborted gesture to make it seem like he was going to. Careful. Only attack when you can also protect yourself. Once more, the lad understood, and his next attack was much more careful. John nodded his approval. The joust continued in such a way for about fifteen passages of arms, becoming more and more fluid and graceful, before John finally let himself score a solid hit, and although he involuntarily made the lad stumble and fall back, the eyes that were looking at him were definitively grateful.
Culverton Smith was certainly an interesting character; his apothecary was renowned for providing its most faithful clients with anything they needed in less than a fortnight, no matter how dubiously legal. The manager with the twisted smile had actually been investigated more than once by the royal guard but they had never managed to find anything against him. The Prince had little doubt that the man’s place was in the dungeons somewhere, or possibly on the gibbet; but Smith’s gossiping tongue held far too much interest for him to try and arrest the man. There wasn’t anything that the man wouldn’t reveal for gold, and he held information about places and people Sherlock would never have allowed his street kids to investigate.
“Naturally. No matter that she agreed or that she received a financial contribution for her troubles. Putting a young girl in such a position of danger should be avoided at all costs. Surely there were other options; if those are royal grounds, the royal guard should have been able to…”
John had pretty much been confined to his rooms by Ella, barring a daily hour-long walk they generally used to visit Lestrade so Sherlock could torture the man a little, in spite of John’s efforts to make him lay off the long-suffering Captain who seemed more and more strained as the wedding approached – John could only suppose securing the castle in those conditions was nearly impossible. The main consequence of his confinement was that the Prince Was Bored. John had quickly learnt, after finding all the too-soft pillows of the princely bed clinically hacked to pieces by a masterfully-wielded sword, that this was generally a bad thing.
“Yes, really. I had actually meant to tell you; I’m now engaged. To Princess Adler. The wedding is in two months.”
“Oh, I’ve no doubt that you’d be able to triple his current wages without it being a strain on your personal finances before many years – but what about his status? He hasn’t been officially dubbed, and as far as I remember my presence is still necessary for this kind of ceremonies.”
Her words were slightly drawled as well and he wondered whether anyone from the capital knew how to speak without elongating the syllables.
So high up he couldn’t hear anything, but this was the price for being unbothered; and anyway, he didn’t need to be closer to recognise John’s small figure. He had repressed a smile at the teaching lesson the man’s first fight had become, figuring it was yet another consequence of John’s great heart, and slightly nodded in unseen congratulations as the man won his second fight and lasted for far longer that the average trainee against Knight Gerove, who despite his usual light-hearted behaviour was a serious and expert fencer.
Three hours later, when John woke up, the Prince was nowhere to be seen; nonetheless, inexplicably, he felt better-rested than he had in almost a week.
“Oh I’m sure you do, John, but you see I really have to warn the incompetent captain of the guard that they have a band of ruffians to put in gaol – in this, at least, they are truly experts.”
“Those men,” a negligent wave in direction of the five bodies on the ground “have been harassing travellers in those woods for almost a whole lunar cycle now – pillaging and killing and the like. As these woods belong to the royal grounds, the problem has been brought to my attention. I’m afraid, however, that my reputation as an able fencer has disserved me in this instance, as I was unable to ensure that they attacked me – therefore I enlisted Molly’s help.”
They had settled in what could have been called a routine, had the word not been incompatible with Prince Sherlock’s very self. As it was, the two men at least adapted beautifully to each other, John learning to ignore the constant mess their bedchambers were in and Sherlock managing to forgive him when he had to take a break to eat or sleep during missions. It was, however, on said missions that they found themselves growing always closer together. It made a certain amount of sense, considering they had immediately fought alongside each other when they had met, and more than once John had found himself smiling ruefully as he reflected on the words the Prince had used to convince him to let Sherlock call him John. They had indeed bonded through battle.
This unexpected strike at his current deepest fear left him silent once more and the woman continued, apparently satisfied.
“A-ah, around eight this morning I believe. He’s quite often crossing the kitchens, actually – every morning and evening, from what I can tell. He’s not coming on any errand either, even though he always comes right before we send the guests’ meals up.”
This flat was not a catacomb, a memento of forgiveness, of rejection, of addiction, of pain and of loneliness. This flat was no longer empty, felt no longer lifeless, it was filled with an odd sense of excitement, adrenaline, and a touch, just a tiny touch of color.
“You know it’s true”, Sherlock said, allowing the tears to fall on his face freely. “You know all of this was one huge mistake. Another one of my failures, another one of my miscalculations, because lately I don’t know anything else. I should have never walked in on you at that café, never attempted any form of contact. I’m sorry, for being so selfish, for not thinking about you, about what I was doing to you. I’m sorry, John.”
Hawthorne spent the next two hours staring fixedly at Melissa’s phone while she monitored John’s signs. When he reached the last post he gave the phone back to her and sighed.
"Shhh..." Sherlock whispered in his ear. Then the greaser leaned and pressed a kiss on John's head, staying there as well. He was saying something John couldn't quite understand, then he did. "I'm sorry, John. I'm so sorry."
Sherlock Holmes had his arms crossed and was leaning towards the portrait, looking at it closely. John looked at him, puzzled. What could possibly be so fascinating about his portrait?
But he remembered the conversation John had had with Irene Adler back then. The way he stood there, silently, as Irene acknowledged his feelings. When she talked, Sherlock rolled his eyes, imagining some kind of comeback from John, some response, utterly denying all accusations, as he had done a thousand times before.
Mrs Hudson chuckled. "Anyway, I'll bake you a pie. Do you like pies, John?" She said, looking at the smaller boy.
"So, until when are you staying Harry?". Sherlock didn't sound mean, just curious, so Harry didn't take it as an insult.
His hands were shaking, he could feel his own body temperature dropping, as if in contrast to the outrageously sunny day London was having.
He hummed and turned towards the window again. Molly felt uncomfortable, but since he had told her his name, she thought it was worth a try. "So, which classes do you have today?"
He grimaced, andhearing John's voice, he threw them into the grass, feeling disgusted with himself. Great. Another feeling to add to his expense collection of things he wasn't strong enough to avoid.
Melissa's face had completely fallen after listening to the word 'murder' but she seemed to come back to herself once she realized that she was actually given the chance to
Sherlock was moving in his seat uncontrollably, pretending he didn't hear John. "Damn it, I need a cigarette!"
"And who was that person exactly?" John was looking at Sherlock, he certainly looked nervous, it was rare seeing him like this, something wasn't right.
"Shit." Clara said leaning down and touching Harry's wrist, checking her pulse. "Harry, love, are you okay?" She said worriedly. No response.
, which was the most surprising turn of events. Her name was Molly Hooper. She was really nice and smart and John enjoyed talking to her.
He missed the way he used to reach with his fingertips and feel the brushstrokes as he smiled at his own artworks. He missed the way he used to take the paint in his hands and mix it with a completely different color and get something beautiful and intense. He missed the smell of the oil. He liked the way the oil merged with the canvas.
John finally looked up to meet his eyes. He kept his expression neutral, but his eyes betrayed him. He walked towards Sherlock slowly, painfully slowly.
"I don't want to take a seat!" Sherlock said raising his voice. It came out sharper than he intended.
Harry looked down as the memory of that night stroked her. She closed her eyes and bit her lip. "...Of course I remember John, it torments me!" She said lowly.
"I don't know what you're thinking, but you look... Sexy when you are so focused." She smiled even wider and leaned closer.
With every move, John touched Sherlock's prostate and Sherlock was melting into John's body. He wrapped his legs around John's torso and began moving out of sheer instinct and need, and he'd never felt anything remotely similar to this before.
John and Harry entered to the living room, looking very confused. John stepped up, "I'm sorry, would any of you like to explain what the hell is going on here?"
John was now a couple of inches away from him, looking around anxiously. “Jesus, I’m sorry. I just- I couldn’t help myself, I’m so sorry. I’ve ruined everything.”
John looked at him out of the corner of his eye and sighed. This was difficult, this was all too difficult.
John's first idea was to come up with an absolute NO. But once he thought about it, perhaps... maybe... "You can't say no, Watson." Tom said sharply.
John wasn't ready to face Sherlock the next day because he didn't know what to think. It was as if, with finding the letter, John had found the last piece to the puzzle. Well, not really the last piece, there were still so many things he didn't know about Sherlock, but a central piece.
"You know me too well, Johnny boy." Sherlock said winking at him, passing John by, and going downstairs.
Harry hesitated, then looked up at his brother and answered with determination. "Nothing, I just found out that you didn't say anything bad last night, you just went into his bed and that's all. At least that's what he told me."
Sherlock sat in front of a white canvas, holding the charcoal in his hand, mentally prepared to look for perfection, imagining the proportions, the curves, the shapes, the shadows, the balance of colors…
“You hit the foot of the bed with your back and your head when you collapsed. I-”, John rubbed his eyes, clearly tired and preoccupied. “I’ll check it out as soon as we get home.”
John wanted to lean closer, to hold Sherlock's hair, he wanted to kiss him so badly. But he couldn't. He didn't know if that was what he was feeling, he couldn't be sure, he never felt it before, but somehow he
to pretend everything was fine because if he didn't, people would start suspecting the real cause of his anger towards his so called friends: John Watson. He was the root of all problems, the mystery. But now everything was ruined and he had left things very clear:
I wanted to state that this is not a case fic, I don't like case fics and find them boring, so I try not to turn my fics into case fics, although with this one it was almost impossible. Just keep in mind that all of the details of the case are somehow related to John and Sherlock's relationship.
"Smooth!" John said laughing at Sherlock. Then he took the keys lying on the table and said "Let's go, I'll drive. Open the door quietly, if my parents wake up they are going to be mad! Lucky for you, they were at one of dad's friends house and they drank a few glasses so they are deeply asleep."
He walked towards the door and, before opening it, he looked back and stared at Sherlock. They looked at each other for a while, silently.
John’s eyes fixed on Sherlock’s and they stared at each other, silently. Then John’s eyes roamed down until they stopped in Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock instinctively licked them.
He was anxious, his mind was made a mess, he couldn't think properly and he kept checking his watch every few minutes unconsciously.
Even though he knew looking after John wasn't the wisest choice, he couldn't help but feel worried. He wondered if his life would be like this forever, looking after John from afar, while John would be unaware of him. It seemed like a dreadful existence.
“Isabella Dorman. Actress. 27 years. Was filming a movie in London, had dinner with her colleagues, stood until late at night with them, and came back to the hotel. She was stabbed repeatedly. She arrived alone to her room.”
John looked slightly embarrassed when Sherlock walked into the kitchen. “Did I wake you?”, he said, not turning to look at him.
John's voice now came out more like a whisper, in an attempt to hide the sudden realization and the incredible pain that was hidden behind it. He cleared his throat. "I'm very, very tired. It's been a long, long day. I'm going to sleep."
"Mr Watson and Mr Holmes. Interesting pair. Let me see your work." Mr Hikes said, holding a pen in his hand and looking defiantly at John, who was shaking.
Sherlock's senses slowly came back to him, and all he could do was to pull John towards him, merge with him, not allow a single particle (or a whole universe) to stand in their way. He kissed John and could taste himself on John's lips and the thought was too absorbing, too enrapturing. He felt John moving against him, desperately seeking friction, and he helped him through. John came with a muffled groan and collapsed against Sherlock's chest, both of them panting and sweating and it was messy and Sherlock loved every single second of it.
"Could you be more in love, little brother?"-Harry came to him with a glass of wine in his hand, again.
Just as John thought that, Sherlock turned and walked off. "No- no wait! Where are you going?" John had to run a little to catch the boy, he took him by the arm and forced him to stop. So Sherlock did and turned to face John with an annoyed expression.
“Right”, John said, lowering his tone. “The shapes, slowly tiny galaxies connecting themselves around the black hole of the pupil, right?”
"How many times do I have to tell you you are the most incredible person I've ever met, that you are smart as hell and you are going to be the best doctor in the country? Because the story is getting old."
A little treat ONE day before it all goes to hell. (And I'm not particularly referring to the fanfic), best of lucks on January 1st my lovelies! :3
They were heavy, and the road from the shelves to the desk seemed endless, yet it were only 5 or 6 steps. John wanted to prove he
"Can-", he whispered, feeling the tears welling up his eyes. "I know I don't deserve this, but- can I ask you a favor?"
The greaser was scribbling something down on his notebook hurriedly, like when he used to read books and lose himself in another world. His hair was ruffled, not quite as carefully combed as usual. His hands moved fast and steady. He was decidedly not looking up. Deliberately not looking up, John thought.
After lunch, John went out of the cafeteria, in order to go to Chemistry Club. It was a five minutes walk from there and he hated being late for anything. He crossed around one of the corners of the school when he saw Sherlock, sitting in one of the chairs of the hallway alone and reading a book.
Sherlock looked down as well and Lestrade could see a bit of insecurity on Sherlock's behalf. "...That's partly why I am here."
John’s mouth opened, just for a second, before he realized of it and closed it. “I- do you really think so?”
When they finally reached upstairs, John guided Sherlock to one of the chairs at the kitchen table. “Stay here, I’ll get you some paracetamol”, John said.
"Let's go idiot, it's late!" John said, grabbing Sherlock by the elbow and dragging him towards the door.
And Sherlock leant closer and their lips met. It was a hungry kiss, a kiss filled with desire, filled with a need to recover all of the hours they've spent apart the whole day. Sherlock grabbed John by his forearms and pulled him closer, feeling the slide of their tongues together. John let out a soft moan, and kissed him deeply, deeper, deeper, and Sherlock was struggling to breathe, but this was all the air he needed, John was all he needed. His hands went up to grab the back of John's head, pulling at his head a little. John gasped with pleasure.
“What do you mean? You’ve already got lost once in this castle, and I have to go back to my chambers anyway. You coming with me is the most practical arrangement.”
Eventually, though, every guest was let into the castle and assigned to a room – John spared a compassionate thought for the poor castle’s help, which had been working relentlessly for the past two weeks to make sure everything would be ready in time – while the Princess, her regent and their trusted advisors were ceremonially brought into the throne room for an official welcome. Sherlock went along, of course, and thus John did too, marvelling as always at the richness of the décor.
Mycroft’s voice was loftily pointing out all the discrepancies in the tentative analysis Sherlock was making of this situation and hearing them spoken aloud only made Sherlock this more uneasy. Still, he answered decisively.
His eyes snapped up to meet light grey ones, and he realised it was the first time they had actually exchanged eye-contact in this conversation. He likewise remembered just why he had decided to keep his gaze on the vicinity of the man’s shoulder; those eyes were the man’s most dangerous weapon.
“I’m sure I don’t know how our esteemed King dispenses justice; but probably they will be hung. This is the standard punishment for burglars and pillars, after all.”
John stayed rigidly immobile, convinced that the world would obediently right itself once again if only he didn’t move a muscle for the next five minutes.
He didn’t need to turn his head to know Sherlock had frozen for a second, the way he always did when John said something to surprise him. Astonishment was usually a good reaction to receive from the Prince, one he thrived on – it meant that for a short while he held the too-intelligent man’s total interest. He wondered, however, whether he had gone too far this time, and only realised he had been holding his breath when the Prince’s answer caused him to exhale in relief.
“What about Sir Moran, the regent’s manservant? An elderly man, with a high forehead and a grizzled moustache.”
“A Prince’s knight, eh? Never heard of that. And I haven’t seen you much around him either – are you sure he knows you’re supposed to work for him?”
Only two serious hypotheses remained; either Sherlock had seen something in John Watson that he wished to explore, or he was trying to mess with his brother. Mycroft ran an even more thorough check of John Watson’s kneeling figure before throwing an exasperated glance at Sherlock; obviously he had decided on the latter theory and had little patience for what he perceived to be another of his brother’s games.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow as he considered the man in front of him, but his knight’s eyes, as they met his, were filled with nothing but total innocence. He let the comment go, lips twitching slightly.
It could have been a rejection. Sherlock’s voice was unreadable but his hands gave him away, instinctively flexing as if desiring to reach out for John.
The corridors were surprisingly empty, noted John as he crossed them on his way to Lady Hudson’s bedchambers; he had met a grand total of five people in the last quarter of an hour, and none since he had entered the richest part of the castle. He had already noticed this earlier, as he had made his way towards the training grounds. He had expected such a big castle to be bursting with life, but it seemed the nobles valued their tranquillity over everything else. He had no doubt that the servants’ quarters were rather more animated.
Sherlock gave what John had a long time ago named his shock-induced blink and for the first time he admitted to himself that one of the reasons he liked surprising Sherlock was because seeing the shadows those long lashes struck on the man’s high cheekbones was terribly enticing. And then he didn’t have any time to reflect on hands or eyelashes anymore because they were kissing, and though a small part of him couldn’t help reflecting on the most surprising parts of this (he had never kissed anyone so tall before, nor so thin, and Sherlock’s lips were somehow warmer than any his had ever touched) most of his attention was caught by the ways Sherlock was incomparably Sherlock and inevitably familiar. Because the Prince had freed his right hand, which was now possessively gripping John’s neck and pressing him closer to Sherlock, but his left wrist stayed in John’s firm grip, a gesture of trust rather than submission. And though there was certainly passion in their embrace, Sherlock’s tongue inquisitively seeking his out and exploring the roof of his mouth was clearly him studying John, trying to understand and comprehend his friend in yet another way.
Now he had done it; his brother was sincerely surprised. It didn’t show on his large face, but Sherlock knew him enough to tell. Wanting a knight all to himself could have been another “caprice” (Mycroft’s name for it, not his); deciding to actually share his living space with the man meant this was no laughing matter. Sherlock could almost see the reasoning being pursued in his brother’s mind, so identical to his, could follow him as he brought up and discarded theories. Not a tryst; Sherlock got bored of his lovers very quickly, he certainly wouldn’t have made arrangements to share a room with one. Not a way to curry political favours with the man’s family – even if Watson had had anything to offer to the Kingdom, Sherlock’s only use of the court intrigues was to mock them and occasionally to expose them, contrarily to Mycroft who adored them. Not an enemy – no doubt Mycroft had some records of the Watson family somewhere in this huge brain of his, and anyway John’s honest nature was written all across his features.
Before he could dash off, however, a hand fell on his shoulder and the man beside him fairly bellowed:
Far above from the training grounds, Sherlock watched the proceedings with a look of apathy that felt both very familiar and totally insincere right then; although he had never taken an interest in the choice of new knights before, he had to admit that this time he had wanted to know what would happen. His new-found fascination for a fellow human-being had surprised even him, but the truth was that in spite of the string of deductions he had given to impress John, he felt as if he had barely scoped out the man’s limits. The would-be-knight had surprised him far too many times – with his fighting abilities, when he had raised his voice to protest against Molly’s role, when he had reacted with admiration rather than fright or disgust to Sherlock’s deductions… His responses were unlike anyone’s Sherlock had ever known, and he couldn’t help but relish the challenge that trying to understand this man provided.
"They would get the wrong impression anyway, I wouldn't be here looking for their daughter and neither would she." Sherlock said shrugging and smiling.
"Do you seriously think 'detention' is a good excuse to come up with?" Harry said with a laugh. "Detention doesn't last until 7, you naïve boy!"
”, Sherlock said, rolling his eyes at the stupid name as he pointed towards the color. John looked at it closely, it
He didn’t want to admit it, but he knew pretty well why he had felt the inspiration kicking in. John Watson. Ever since Sherlock saw that painting at the Tate Modern he felt it all over himself, but not with the intensity he felt it now. He could only blame it on what he had seen on their class last Thursday.
John smiled. Of course he could call himself that. Not just his friend, but his best friend, and far much more.
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes in that very sherlockian expression which reminded John of their first days. "Fine. Spit it."
John nodded, picked up his cup with his right hand, threw one last look at Sherlock, picked the napkin the woman had given him and then walked away, leaving a bemused and terrified sleuth behind. Then he got lost in the people, in the street, in London, just like that.
Sherlock Holmes had been staying in Belgium for two months, tracing the last link he could find to Moriarty’s web. He had been working very hard all this time, chasing and capturing.
"Who the hell thought it was necessary to hospitalize me, by the way?", John snapped angrily, "I'm a bloody Doctor, for God's sake! I can take good care of myself!"
"Just waking up by his side, hearing his breathing, looking at him while he was sleeping deeply, it was beautiful to see him so...relaxed, so calmed, so human. I've never felt more at home in my life."
30 days ago, staring at a nonsensical, abstract and colorful painting had been what had brought him some kind of inspiration back. He didn’t understand how, but the complexity and the depth of it spoke volumes to Sherlock, volumes that the painting didn’t show by itself.
As he did, a smile drew itself on his lips. He stared at Sherlock for a long moment before he cleared his throat and said “morning”.
Sherlock flinched. “It doesn’t work, Victor. It will just make you feel more miserable. It. Never. Works!”
"I'm afraid he is busy, Mr. Holmes, and the orders were clear. There's nothing I can do. Now let's check on your general state. How are you feeling?"
Sherlock felt as if he had been stabbed. How could he make John see? How could he explain him that all he had done had been to protect
Sherlock looked at John without saying a thing. He just had his eyes wide opened. Finally, he opened his mouth.
"Alright then, sweetheart. Just arrive before your father does, please. You know how much it upsets him."
"That was-", he started but didn't know how to finish. The English language had 1,025,109 words and none of them was enough to convey what Sherlock was feeling at this exact moment. John sat up and Sherlock pulled him down to kiss him. Well, sometimes a kiss said more than 1,025,109 words. Sherlock could feel his own taste in John's mouth and he felt overwhelmed by it.
Sherlock took his violin again and started playing without saying a word. John left the bags on the kitchen and opened the fridge to put the milk inside, as usual, the fridge was the scenario of Sherlock's experiments. "Sherlock! There's a hand on the fridge!" Sherlock pretended he didn't hear him and kept playing "Sher... Sherlock!" -John shouted.
His acute sense of smell activated as soon as he stopped in the counter. He would recognise that smell anywhere,
Sherlock smiled widely and looked directly into John's eyes, with that look the boy simply couldn't resist. "I missed you too. I imagined myself telling you what I had found on the crime scene and  I ended up talking alone and everybody looked at me as if I had lost my mind."
But John couldn't smile back, he couldn't fake, he just couldn't smile at Sherlock anymore, he resisted the urge of returning the smile, shook his head, looked down and when he looked back up, Sherlock's smile was gone as well, and the moment was over. He closed the curtain and forced himself to go back to his bed and continue studying and doing the homework. He couldn't, every time he tried, he heard Sherlock's voice, and it was getting harder and harder to ignore it.
