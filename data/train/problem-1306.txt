“Fuck.” He muttered, looking up the stairs and deciding it just wasn’t worth the effort right now. John pulled him close and somehow, they fell asleep on the stairs going up to 221B. It wasn’t very comfortable, but…well, what for it? He had no idea how long it had been when he was aware of a door opening and footsteps. And then “Oh, John! What happened?”
sorry, my dear Watson. That moron will pay for hurting you.” Jim knelt beside her, using the key to her hand-cuffs to get them off before moving to very carefully remove the duct-tape gag, “This will hurt.” She nodded and braced herself. The tape came off with a painful rip and brought tears to her eyes.
“The look that got me tagged with the nickname Mother Watson when we were in med school?” John knew exactly what Stamford was talking about and chuckled a bit.
“Okay, let me give you a little extra incentive.” Sherlock frowned. Extra incentive to what? Jump? What did Moriarty think he had on Sherlock that he could use as leverage to keep Sherlock from dropping him off the roof of Saint Barts?
“Come on, Judith. I want you to meet someone.” John took her by the hand and up the steps. The strange woman was right behind them, and as she hesitated at the threshold of the barrier, Judith was aware of a firm shove between her shoulders. She stumbled forward and went through the barrier head-first, landing hard on her knees on the other side.
“To me, you’re beautiful.” John smiled and directed Sherlock down for another kiss. “Come here, you, before you start talking and forget to stop.” Getting both hands free, John took the chance to touch, to learn, being careful of scars he found on Sherlock’s back. Where had he gotten those? John knew without seeing them what they were, what had caused them, but couldn’t begin to imagine when Sherlock would have been in any position to
“Your pardon, ladies and gentlemen.” She said with a polite smile. There was a chorus of “Oh, no trouble!” and shaking heads. Whatever was up was bound to be a good show. With a brisk nod, Judith left the table.
“I should introduce you to the lead pathologist, she might be able to point you in the direction of something to keep you occupied.”
Some more MCU/Sherlock crossovers happen here. Greg finally meets Doctor Strange and realizes that they aren't exactly strangers.
“You’re certainly smart enough.” Riyah sat her down and handed her a mug of tea, “But you’re a doctor, yeah?”
“Nonsense!” Before she could say no again, M picked up her desk-phone and dialled an extension, “Q, patch up the camera footage to my office, please. Yes, all of them. Thank you.”
“You’ve done enough, Constable. Take off for the night. See you back in a few days.” Lestrade said, indicating her car. Judith nodded and shot Anderson a last glance before heading for her car, knowing damn well she wasn’t going home. She’d return the car to Kensington Police Station, but she had work to do.
“And I’ll do it many times more, son.” He closed his eyes and let the sway of the cab lull him until they reached their destination. He got out behind Sherlock and paid the fare, just like the old days, thanking the driver, and looked around.
“Hmm. Lucky you.” Iridescent blue eyes the colour of the sky at dawn right at the horizon just after the sun rose rolled and water splashed as Sherlock flicked two fingers in disdain.
“Evening.” Judith’s voice was soft but strong, despite a nervous waver, “This is a turn-up, isn’t it, Sherlock?”
“Kill you?” Jim grimaced, “N-no, don’t be obvious. I mean, I’m gonna kill you anyway some day. I don’t wanna rush it, though. I’m saving it up for something special.” Jim shook his head briskly.
“Thanks, Molly.” Lestrade took it from Hooper and looked at John as he added the information on the newest victim he’d brought to the morgue. “You look familiar, do I know you from somewhere?”
looking at?” He snapped. Sally’s eyes widened and she lowered her head as John started to move. She knew what was coming and couldn't bear to look. Judith knew exactly what her brother was planning to do and quietly took another pair of handcuffs from Sally since hers had been given up for Sherlock. They weren’t going to stop John from taking a swing at the Chief Superintendent, not right away. If anyone deserved a good shot at James Roben, it was definitely John Watson. And he could get away with it, Judith and Sally could not.
“Worst case, invoke Mycroft’s name.” She walked into a small, spare room with basic furnishings and shaded windows. In the morning, she would have a view of the city. On a work-space bench, she saw a laptop and some books on spirituality and magic. There were others, written in Sanskrit. The laptop was
unexpected, but so soon after she had joined the force? He suspected that they had the Holmes brothers to thank for this, more likely it was Mycroft’s doing. But when he
“What happened to it?” Sherlock took the towel from him and touched the damp strands of hair, running his fingers through them.
“Greg.” She was trying to get his attention, but he was too focused. Finally he managed roughly strip the jacket and vest off Judith’s arms.
He set the bag down on the table and turned as she came inside, closing the door behind her with one shoulder, her motions almost distracted.
“Neither are we,” John growled, arms folded across his chest as he glared at Roben unnoticed. Oh, if looks could kill!
“It’s almost ten, you can’t really hide out here for two hours.” He looked worried, “Here, come with me.”
“I keep telling you, Jude, go all the way. A week a month obviously isn’t doing it for you, you’re working more and more time and even the Super is getting curious.”
“Oh, good afternoon, Inspector Lestrade.” Strange turned and smiled at him, that genuine smile Greg knew was saved for a very
word for it, I didn’t really get a good look at the hands and I’m not sure there would be evidence of a ring-band after all this time in the water anyway.”
If anyone who had known John Watson before 21 November 2011 had seen him the following year, they wouldn’t have recognised him in passing. He spent months in mourning, cutting off contact with just about everyone he had ever been friends with.
It was quiet as they pulled into the Tesco’s car-park and parked next to John’s car. But he didn’t get out right away.
“Yes, Mum.” John's shoulders slumped and he bowed his head. Sherlock put one hand on his mate's shoulder. The reality that they were both in serious danger was staring them in the face, and they didn't have much time. Going back to his bedroom, Sherlock found a small suitcase and packed a few days worth of clothes and necessities. John came in and retrieved the pelt-cases from the safe.
“Yeah, but that doesn’t mean he gets to take off with evidence from a crime-scene without saying anything.” Greg narrowed his eyes, “You’re driving.”
“We’ll see. It’s a shame no one’s called for the others.” Sherlock joined him and they watched as the ecstatic Radcliffes thanked the police for their help.
to know, not the last. Judith cocked an eyebrow. The papers were in her pocket and her badge had been switched out to reflect her new post. She had promised Sally a round at the next Yard Pub Night to properly celebrate. That, it seemed, would have to wait a while.
“I’m happy to be useful where I can be.” Strange took Sherlock’s hand in his for a moment. Something unspoken passed between the two men before Strange turned and looked at Greg as he walked away down the hall. Greg shared a look with Sherlock as he followed Strange.
“Yes.” He almost forgot how to breathe as he looked at the ring. “We must have visited the very same jeweller, John.”
“Help yourself.” John let him, catching his breath when Sherlock kissed his fingertips before tearing the packet open very carefully using his teeth and shaking out the rolled bit of latex, which promptly disappeared between Sherlock’s teeth.
“Oh, hush.” He wrote his phone-number down at the top of the page in the corner. “That’s my number, call me or text if you need anything. If you get a case or the likes.”
“He came to the hospital looking for me. Ended up meeting my whole family.” Judith looked at her brother, who grinned, “I think it might have been a bit much for him so early in the day.”
“You are not a freak, Sherlock. You have an incredible brain, an intellect that puts any modern genius to fucking
“I remember the boys I took home that night, after Davenport. I got ‘em home safe, I wasn’t interested. After all, you’d made it rather clear that you wanted them home safe, so I took them home.”
“Solve this and I’ll keep you in cold-case work for six months, Sherlock.” She muttered, jingling her keys irritably. Her irritation was short-lived as she felt a tug on her boot-laces and tiny, sharp claws digging into her combat-trousers.
The transaction was smooth, and Magnus gave him a box for Judith’s ring. Greg wore his out of the store, a happy, welcome weight on his left hand that had been missing for a while. It would definitely take getting used to, but he was looking forward to it. Wearing his, he knew he would give Judith hers tonight. Or…sooner, perhaps?
home, but her staff was surprisingly talkative. They recovered the tiger-pelt from the zoo case and were informed that DeVil had departed London for a family property in Suffolk. Word was put out to the local boroughs in Suffolk to be on the lookout for the Radcliffe puppies and the rest of them as well. There was a slim chance the puppies were still alive. Desperate to see this through to the end, closed, and the puppies safe, John asked if he could get out to Suffolk somehow. That required a short phone-call to Mycroft, who gave them the chopper and a warning to be careful.
Finally, Sherlock made a move. A daring move, he started to walk slowly towards the calm hostage. Judith pulled open her jacket to reveal the bomb strapped to her chest and Sherlock felt a deep dread.. From somewhere in the upper gallery, a sniper’s laser immediately began to dance around over the vest as Judith blinked a subtle S.O.S. message that he would have missed if he hadn’t been looking at her eyes. Behind him, Greg and John both made the same noise.
“You can’t fire me from a job I haven’t started, sir, and I doubt the Director of MI6 would be terribly pleased to learn you’d booted me from The Met because you can’t get along with the smartest consultants in this place.” Judith gave a short, sharp nod, “With your leave, Mr Roben.” Before he had a chance to stop her, she turned on him and left his office. Her phone buzzed in her pocket and she answered right away.
“I like the freedom being a Special Constable gives me. I get to pretty much pick my hours. A week a month takes care of my time requirements by a bit.”
curious scrutiny. She paid a bit more attention and tracked the source to a pair of men sitting across from her on the train. They didn’t look
“God bless you, Inspector, for being there for Judith, for all of us.” Richard tucked the papers away again, “You’ve got a job to do, I take it?”
?” He couldn't help a mean chuckle. Sirens approached at the junction ahead of them. Sherlock swerved to his left and dropped the pistol in the process. It clattered to the ground.
“We’ll do our best.” Judith smiled at him, “Don’t be a stranger, yeah? We’re a couple thousand miles separated, but don’t forget to visit.”
“Good! Very good.” He grinned at them. Sherlock didn’t move, still aiming his gun at Jim’s head but now a little anxiously, wondering what action the hidden sniper might take if one of them made the wrong move.
“Okay.” She smiled and he rubbed her cheek with his thumb before he focused on driving. He hadn’t mean to touch her that way, but she needed it, needed a kind hand, an understanding voice.
“Pretty damn sure. Just spend more time than is wise with them is all.” She coughed. The way they were seated at the long table, backed by a pull-down screen displaying photographs of the most recent victim, it was Sally on the right, Judith on the left, and Greg between them.
“I know.” Judith smiled and kissed Sherlock on the cheek, “Trust me.” Sherlock blushed a bit and wrinkled his nose, but didn’t say anything. They sat on the couch once John had tea ready and she leaned against Sherlock.
“Holding you still.” She smiled, “Distracting you. It seems to be working.” Judith leant down until their noses touched, “Say stop.”
“I’ve played five times. I’m alive. It’s not chance, Mr ’olmes, it’s chess. It’s a game of chess, with one move, and one survivor. And this...
She pulled the keys from the ignition and got out as she hung up with Greg after exchanging goodbyes. It was quiet as they entered the hospital and made their way down to the chemistry lab where Sherlock and John had spent hours on cases or just for the hell of keeping Sherlock out of trouble at Baker Street.
in, Doctor Watson, but I suppose you have better things to do with your time than stare at dead bodies all day.”
“I’m the lucky one. She’s more than I deserve.” He would never say that Judith deserved better, he knew she hated it when he did that. She had been there from the beginning, and wasn’t going to leave soon. He couldn't live without her, it hurt to think about it.
“I know what you promised, but we both know that duty must come before family when necessary. Do what you can and I’ll see you at home. Where can I take you?”
“No, but perhaps you should be grateful.” John’s eyes narrowed, and anyone who knew him would know that it was not a good sign. “And I’m not your brother’s lackey, I’m his
look good on your record, John went about the business of procuring a bottle of the restaurant’s most expensive wine, double-checking the label to make sure he had the right one, and a basket of fresh, hot bread. He added something to the water, tasteless and colourless, to bolster the nutritional value. He knew that Moriarty’s companion was Fey, and he’d caught a whiff of sea-air. He wasn’t sure exactly
“Well, usually I’m not lucky enough to be on the receiving end of things like this.” She leaned against him, stretching up on tip-toe to steal another kiss. Not that Greg was
Seeing an opportunity, Judith rushed forward and slammed her full weight against Jim’s back, wrapping one arm around his neck and the other around his chest. Sherlock backed up a step in surprise but kept the pistol raised and aimed at Jim.
After a few seconds Sherlock looked down to the pills again and raised his hand, his fist clenched above the table for a moment before he extended his arm and pointed to the vial on the cabbie’s left, the one which wasn’t pushed across the table towards him.
When Judith Watson disappeared with a few of the dancers, Greg Lestrade knew something was up. She’d said that this wasn’t her first visit to Maroush, and he believed her, but the way she was comfortable with the dancers spoke of some different familiarity. He liked Watson, he really did, more than he probably should He knew if Sherlock ever found out just how much, he would never hear the end of it. It wasn’t like today was the first time they’d met, anyway, so he was allowed a bit of fancy. He wondered if Judith remembered, he certainly did. It had been years ago, they had both been a bit younger then than now, but he had made himself a promise to remember the feisty medic he had met on a deployment to Canada, and again in Afghanistan. Judith Watson had saved his life in Afghanistan three years ago, he wondered if she remembered that. He had been Army Reserves for most of his career with The Met, at the mercy of the needs of the military, and had left for a two-year stint in the Middle East. That had been their second deployment together, and his last.
“And no one is asking you to, my dear.” John sighed, leaning his head back, “What do we do about Moriarty? We can't just wait for him to make his move.”
“No one else gets to call you an idiot. No matter what. You can’t go off and get yourself into trouble without me, ever.”
“Let’s get this over with.” He muttered, collecting the ice. Going into the house and through to the kitchen, he had Sherlock, Hutchison, and a couple of sergeants in tow. He dropped the ice off with Lisa’s sister, Beverley, who happened to be in the kitchen and did a double-take when she saw the police.
“You didn’t have to do that, John, you didn’t have to...you could have been more seriously injured or killed.”
“Easy, Sherlock.” Judith put herself between the brothers, “Please, Mycroft, he’s in a bad way. The last thing he needs is the kind of stress you’ll put him through. He was kidnapped by the serial-killer responsible for Beth Davenport’s murder and the previous three. He took out another victim tonight and Sherlock might have been his sixth, but we got in the way.”
“You caught him good, though. He really does like you.” Moran stroked her hair, “I’ll make sure you and your boys are safe in this mad little game of his. Who matters to you, besides John?”
With his window open just enough to let in a bit of breeze and the night-sounds of London, John fell asleep in a new bed in a new flat, and slept very well. He thought he heard something downstairs around two or three, but he couldn’t be arsed to go investigate. There were no explosions, the alarms didn’t go off, and there was no shouting. Just Sherlock up to whatever harmless nocturnal pursuits interested him, no doubt.
“Thank you, have a nice day.” Judith held the door for him and he passed her one cup. “For you, my dear.”
When they reached the first body, Judith circled it a few times, reciting what she could see out loud as she lifted the sheet to get a better look. John inspected the bodies with her while Sherlock took apart the scene inside the apartment. For a while, it was quiet while they made observations and took notes. But while they were going over the third body, that of a six-year-old female child, Judith straightened and turned her back on the scene for a minute.
“She.” Sherlock stripped off his gloves, balled them up, and shoved them into a pocket. “The killer is a woman.”
“What?” He swung the Belstaff around his shoulders, unable to help a happy, content sigh as it settled into place.
“You seem to have this impression of yourself that you are unfit for your age or some nonsense.” Eyes turned grey looked steadily at him, “Which is entirely untrue. You are in far better physical condition than many of our age-mates and even some who are quite a good bit younger. There is nothing wrong with the way you look.”
It was very likely her car would be seen on Berkley Street, but no one would bother looking for her in the Sanctum. The Acolytes and sorcerers who lived at Kamar-Taj were used to seeing her like this, at all hours of the day, in her duty-uniform, and she muted her radio out of habit. Going to the room she kept at the sanctuary, she opened a portal to somewhere quiet. Stepping out of the portal and onto the slopes of Mount Everest, which had become a favorite place of hers to go when she needed to get away, she found her “thinking-perch”.
“Yeah, okay, I did. But the flirting’s over, Sherlock…I’ve shown you what I can do.” Jim looked at them, “I cut loose all those people, all those little problems, even thirty million quid just to get you to come out and play.”
speak fluently.” He rubbed his face, then remembered his manners. “Sorry, I don’t think we’ve met before. I’m Greg Lestrade, Judith’s partner.”
“That’s news to you?” He grinned and dropped a kiss to the scruffy cheek before he hopped off the bed, “Who’s the bad influence, Sherlock?”
“Oh, she knows I’m good for it.” He said casually, as if it was no matter he had just flirted with a woman who could not only kill him and make it look like an accident but make sure they never found a body in the first place.
to Baker Street. He couldn't hold his gaze for long, however, and he looked away again after a while.
"Down to the River to Pray" is one of my absolute FAVORITE songs, and I have a lovely version of it in Gaelic on my playlist, both the English version and my beloved Gaelic will feature in different parts of this story. It's such a pretty song. Judith gets to show off a bit more of her dancing skills, too, for a VERY appreciative crowd, which is never a bad thing! ;)
Sighing, John got to his feet and headed out, waving to a few people as he left. If he had his choice, he wouldn’t come back to this party. The nearest petrol station was a half mile away, and Tesco was six minutes’ drive. Taking a risk, John decided to drive.
“Female, mid-twenties. But the facial features are a bit ... strong.” John narrowed his eyes and did a manual inspection, carefully running his hands along the victim’s body, paying particular attention to the groin.
The only warning John had before he just completely broke down in tears was a single teardrop hitting the screen of his phone. Hutchison let him cry, just offering company and soft words, reminding John to breathe every once in a while so he didn’t pass out. It was probably the first time someone had hugged John in months, and he couldn’t bring himself to be ashamed of needing a hug in the first place. He felt kind of silly for sobbing hysterically in a police car, but it wasn’t the first time he’d had a good cry in one. He’d spent almost an hour in the front seat of Greg’s car doing this very same thing, it might have been longer than that.
“You don’t have to talk me into it, Inspector. If you don’t mind a returning, aimless veteran sleeping on your couch a few nights?”
“A bit disappointed is a severe understatement.” Judith cleared her throat, “I spent the first ten years of my life wearing boys clothes and short hair.”
He hung up that call and quickly put out calls to the rest of his team. When he got hold of Sally Donovan, he had one request for her.
“Oh. You noticed?” John’s smile turned shy as he pulled the jumper over his head and used a towel to ruffle his hair, which was tinged a rather noticeable shade of green. It wasn’t all over, just...sort of at the tips. He hadn’t noticed before.
“Put a muzzle on your mutt, Holmes.” Donovan sneered. Sherlock saw the air around John rippling and realized it was the Glamour. Uh oh.
“You’re the only mechanic who could possibly know what to do with this car, Q. You and your lot,” John promised as he started the car, admiring the way it came to life so smoothly. “I’ll be back, don’t worry, you haven’t seen the last of me.”
“Alright, gents, I’ll get this started and be back to see how it’s going in a bit!” Bryan said cheerfully after double-checking their orders. “Do you need anything else right now?”
“Mm? Oh! You’re awake!” He shoved up on his elbows, rubbing sleep from his eyes, “Hi! Oh, god, you’re…back! You’re back!” It wasn’t just sleep he was rubbing out of his eyes. Judith was not surprised that this made him cry. She sighed and rubbed the back of Greg’s neck, ruffling the longer hair there. He needed a haircut again, and a good razor. It didn’t look like he’d shaved in a few days. He’d showered, his hair was clean and she smelled the body-wash and shampoo he used, but he was wearing the same clothes he had worn the night of the pool stand-off. His clothes were clean but rumpled, he’d worn them for a few days after washing what had to have been a horrific pile of dirty laundry.
John Watson without direction, without something to occupy his time and his mind, is not a happy man. What happens when he finds himself dismissed from the SIS is anyone's bet, but those higher on the ladder had better keep an eye on him.
When Stephen suddenly popped out of the Astral Plane to guide Palmer, Judith couldn't help her own startled jump. But when he suddenly warned them to “Keep me alive, will you?” and disappeared back into the Astral Plane, Judith just shot him a dirty look.
“Oh, god, you and the other two! I’m not interested right now! I like calling my own hours and being able to say no when I’ve filled my time.” She rolled her eyes, “Not that anyone upstairs would mind if I did go all the way.” Judith felt her phone buzzing in her pocket and pulled it out, “Oh, Q’s got something for me.” She looked at the occupants of her grandmother’s office, “If you three would kindly excuse me, I have work to do.”
“Well, that takes care of my business for the night. I guess I go home now.” She crushed the dog-end of her cigarette under the heel of her boot, picking it up to toss it in a nearby bin, “Just try to keep your promise.”
“Somebody’s awfully excited.” Greg teased as she headed for the wrap-around veranda once she had changed, “Where are
“Whoa.” Looking at the camera one last time, she pushed the door open and slipped inside. It had started to rain while she’d been walking, and getting out of the rain was a bonus right now. Shaking water out of her hair and from her jacket, she looked at her watch to see what time it was. It was almost four am. She groaned and leaned against the door.
“Vauxhall Arches last week. Worked his way north towards Baker Street, spotted around Regent’s Park two days ago.”
“Oh. Shit.” It wasn’t breathing anymore, it was something else. John shook his head and looked up. “I’m so sorry.”
“You’ll see! Something to keep you busy a while.” He kissed the tip of her nose, “I will keep my word. Go on, you’ve been missed.” He let her go and headed off down the street. Judith watched until he was out of sight, wondering what it was about Moriarty.
“Oh, of course!” She just stood at the bottom of the stairs, beaming but sad, as John hauled Sherlock to his feet and they made their way very slowly up the stairs. “I suppose I’m not to tell anyone about this?”
“Open it.” He watched her eyes. “Tell me what you think?” She turned the box over in her hands, studying it, and the look on her face changed as she opened it and found the ring.
“Lestrade.” Roben looked over his shoulder, “Call it.” Greg braced himself. He had no idea which body was on which table.
It wasn’t until they had driven from Baskerville to Henry Knight’s house that he realized the past forty-five minutes had actually happened. Sherlock had some damn crooked ideas about things, which was how he found himself hunting Sherlock and Henry down on the foggy moor in the dark, hoping to God whatever was out here didn’t come after him. It didn’t, but he lost track of Sherlock again after a ghost encounter in Dewer’s Hollow. Taking care of a frantic Henry Knight, John didn’t get back to the inn until many hours later, and looking for Sherlock got him a sight to behold. Judith had returned from Baskerville and the two sat across from each other by the fire, caught up in a tense discussion. He could see Sherlock’s hand shaking as he lifted a glass and frowned. Was Sherlock having a panic attack? Not that he blamed the man, but Sherlock didn’t
“I never said you had to.” He could just feel John tensing up behind him at the handling, but John had to know that Lestrade was never, ever going to hurt Sherlock. That he was a good one.
“Richard Marcus, age 27. Middle of three children, eldest of identical twins, engaged to his girlfriend of six years, owns three dogs, medium breed. Broke his arm in a fall six months ago, break healed well, still favors that arm.” Sherlock rattled all of that off without missing a beat, Judith and John shared an eye-roll.
“This is the astral plane. One of many planes and dimensions a sorcerer can access with proper training.” The Ancient One stood before her, looking a bit blurred around the edges, transparent. “Your mortal form has not reached the floor yet. You will not be harmed by the fall.” She watched, wondering if any of this was real, as her brother put one arm under her shoulders in the physical world. John catching her was the only thing that kept her from hurting herself when she fell back into her physical body.
Judith had abandoned Dartmoor for Nepal, and that without a second thought for the matter. Sherlock was being difficult, unwilling to admit that he had been scared. He
he was going to stage an escape and they were helping him. Their jobs, already at risk, were now in serious jeopardy because of his next actions. John gasped in surprise at the rapid turn of events as Sherlock took careful aim at the nearest few officers.
With Greg behind her, keeping tabs on the whole thing, and glad he was around, she decided it was time to start probing for answers. She set Greg’s recorder between them on the table. She had already read him, he had already agreed to talk. He wasn’t asking for a lawyer, he wasn’t
“Watchful thing, this one. Hard to take her by surprise. One of my brightest, one of my best.” Moran rubbed her shoulder fondly, “Always thought you’d go into government work once you got out, never mind you being a doctor and all that.”
John and Greg only waited a short while to get a table and John ordered the first round as promised. Once the drinks came, they sat and drank in companionable quiet.
“You can always offer me a ride, sir.” She didn’t even hesitate. She smiled and pulled the door open. Once she was in, she closed the door, buckling her seat-belt as he got underway again. It was quiet between them on the fifteen-minute drive from Kensington to The Met, a familiar drive for them both, and she wasn’t a bit surprised when he reached across the console and took her hand in his.
“You…traitor!” He tried to get at her, “You bitch! You sold me out! You don’t deserve your badge, Donovan, you deserve nothing! You worthless, selfish bitch! I hope you…you…”
“Fair enough.” He kissed her on the cheek, “Time for sleep now, we’ve got an eight-mile run waiting for us in two hours.”
“This way! Track him!” She led the charge into the forest, and they chased down the perpetrator. Judith did something a bit risky and used a spell to bring down the runner. It was Doctor Frankland, of all people, who had a perfect excuse for why he’d done all those terrible things to Henry
“What?” She fought to sit up, peering out the windscreen of the Rover. Greg pointed wordlessly at the cab that had just pulled up. On her laptop, the indicator showed that Hope’s taxi was in front of them.
“Just don’t do anything stupid? Please?” John paced behind him, “Don’t lock me out of whatever you plan on doing?”  When he caught sight of Riley coming up the footpath, he sat down to wait for her. John sat next to him.
“I think you’d better come with me, Doctor Watson.” The constable put one hand on his arm and squeezed. “Last time I saw a man’s face that colour, he was dead. Come on.”
, Stephen!” Begging was unnecessary, Stephen was willing to help. He was very fond of the Watsons and those attached to them. And Judith had a very reasonable request. This wasn’t nearly turn-back on the scale they had seen in Hong Kong all those months ago, this was at the
“No, sir, I found it. Had to do some hunting, but I watched him steal the coat the second time he took it and I traced his route.” That was news to Sherlock.
“At the moment? A friend. Please sit.” He indicated the empty seat, “You’re on your way to Saint Bart’s, yeah?”
“Tell me about it. Being around her made my hair stand up.” He shuddered, “If she’s not behind this, then I don’t know who
“Oh, how can I say no to that face?” Watson chuckled, causing his eyes and mouth to crinkle in a soft, adorable way, and carefully set aside his own clothes. With his back to Sherlock, he stripped to the waist and Sherlock caught sight of a particular scar on his shoulder. It was small, but obvious against the muscled, tanned expanse of Watson’s back. It was an entry wound. Watson had been shot.
“Fold your legs lotus-style, son. And just relax, nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to worry about. No one around here’s gonna yell at you.” Uncapping one bottle of water, she had him swish to clean out his mouth a bit before the next wave hit, and he spit in the bucket.
“I’ve got you.” He put one arm around her and called in over his radio for an ambulance and a bomb-disposal team. Both were already en route.
“I’ve wasted enough time on that woman. It ends tomorrow. I’ll do it in the morning, and we’ll spend the rest of the day … I have no idea what we’ll do.”
“Really, all you’d have to do is give ‘em that look and they’d behave, I think,” Stamford said with a chuckle.
“What about them, sir? You know the rules.” Donovan shot John and Mycroft a suspicious look. John just looked right back until she averted her gaze first.
Sighing, John leaned his elbows on his knees and ran his hands through his hair, sitting still for a moment before he heaved himself off the bed. He made his way to the water-closet and took care of business before returning to the small bedroom that would be his until further notice. He had no intention of moving out of Baker Street, he rather liked the cluttered flat and it’s very unusual tenant, but it wasn’t for certain just how
“Personal investment, sir. I don’t get on well with the likes of DeVil and can’t stand those who treat animals so badly.” John shrugged, “It was no problem.”
After she finished what needed to be done with reports and such, she headed straight to Berkley Street and parked outside the Sanctum. Going inside, she made her way to the Rotunda and from there entered Kamar-Taj. She wasn’t sure what she was looking for going back to the sanctuary, but it seemed the most likely place to find whatever she
“Ah.” Judith smiled, a bit disappointed by that revelation. Some bit of her had hoped he was unattached. She had Greg, of course, but there was a roguish charm to Strange that she found
He still remembered the first time he and John had reunited and the month of recovery that followed when John made him sit still long enough. He had stumbled into the cramped, dank flat in Dublin after taking out one of Jim Moriarty’s high-level operatives, drenched and bleeding. It hadn’t taken him the time necessary to close and lock his door to realise he had company, less than that to realise he had a friend.
“Thanks, Gary.” John smiled at the man. Gary just nodded and went back to serving customers. Judith drained hers with a speed that had won her many drinking-contests in their Army days, setting the empty glass down with a thud and turning from the bar. She didn’t care for anyone who might be watching as she took a bit of her mood out on poor Greg, who didn’t seem to mind much.
“Hey, are you gonna be alright, Watson?” Lestrade followed her to the door, “Your day was about as bad as mine was.”
was in that tea?” She groaned, bracing herself on hands and knees and waiting for her body to realize it was stable again. Motion-sickness and sea-sickness had never bothered her, but she felt
“Well, if you don’t mind, Captain, I’d really very much like to kiss you.” Now they were almost touching noses and John wasn’t sure when Sherlock had decided to lay on top of him, but he didn’t mind. “In fact, I’d love to kiss you.”
She was still searching at two am when she happened to make a round of a build-site down in Soho. The site had closed down at regulation hours, but the lights were still on, which wasn’t unusual. What
“I’m not planning to stay long, though.” He held the door of the car for her, “Your mother’s already back at The Met, and I need to question her. Your brother should be in surgery for his injuries, but it’s not likely he’s going to survive. Are you
After breakfast, they snuck out of Baker Street. Getting to Saint Bart’s didn’t take long, and she checked in with Greg to let him know that she and Sally were on-site at the hospital if he wanted them to take a patrol there.
“Judith, this is Stephen Strange.” John took her free hand, “He came here for healing the same as I did, but he stayed when I left for home after getting what I needed.”
Once they had repacked for a short jaunt into the countryside, they took a hired car to Dartmoor. Their destination was a small airfield, where a chopper was waiting for them. The flight out to Baskerville didn’t take long, but landing was a bit tricky since the base was on complete lock-down when they arrived. Judith rolled her eyes and picked up a harness and belay-rope.
“Well, if you’re anything like Sherlock Holmes, who’s one of the pranciest know-it-alls I’ve ever met, I can’t say I blame them.” Greg smirked. “But you’re one of the smartest men in the world, what could you possibly learn from them?”
“Oh, you’ve got an audience now. Off you pop.” Those were either Moriarty’s people, or those were his people, getting into position and waiting for his signal.
“Hmm?” He cracked an eye open at the sound of his name and realized they had stopped and Mycroft was standing outside the car. “Jesus, did I fall asleep?”
“Wait, so ... let me get this straight.” John held up one hand as he managed to swallow a mouthful of beer before he choked on it. “You’re a DS, just a kid practically as far as the force is concerned, and you get a call one night, so off you go to drag a body out of the Thames because somebody spotted a floater and the River Police got called out to see what’s on, and as you’re standing over this bloated corpse that’s been in the water for Hell knows how long, this kid who’s clearly off his tits on who knows what shows up and starts talking big?”
“Of course we don’t! Besides, I guarantee you Ford’s going to tell Sherlock the very same thing! You two deserve to have a quiet night to yourselves! Go home, John. We’ll take care of Rosie for you.”
He checked his phone as it pinged again, this time with a message from Judith asking him to bring down some clothes for her so she could use the showers in The Bathhouse, she wasn’t going to have time to come back up to the room.
“Lieutenant-Colonel Judith H. Watson, late of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers and Special Forces.” She pocketed her credentials as Barrymore’s eyes widened in alarm and returned a hasty salute, “I don’t think I need permission from the likes of you to go where I like, Major Barrymore. Let alone a place like Baskerville Research Facility.” She looked around.
A nervous corporal met her and explained things. Sherlock had used Mycroft’s ID to break into Baskerville and had gotten caught. Judith planned on getting answers, but not out of the Baker Street duo. She headed for the main lab compound, swiping in with her own ID, entering overrides to gain entry, and caught up to the gang that had stopped Sherlock and John a few yards shy of the exit. She saw one of the researchers coming up on the group from behind, but as soon as he saw her and registered her uniform, he ground to a dead halt, face nearly white. Sham inspectors was bad enough, but the real thing was even worse. And she wasn’t here on pleasant business.
“Now, we can talk here, in peace in Baker Street, or this conversation is going to happen in a metal room and you’re going to be very uncomfortable.” Judith gave a casual, disinterested shrug. “It’s your choice, but I’ll get my answers out of you in a fashion either way.” Oh, she was
“Of course. It’s the least I can do.” He smiled and looked at John, who rolled his eyes and fetched their coats, “Besides, you brought me cases earlier, I owe you one.”
“Jesus, Sherlock!” He croaked once he had his breath back, Sherlock had smacked him between the shoulders to help if he could. “Are you mad?”
“I…think that worked!” She murmured. A moment later, Stephen regained consciousness with a flailing gasp.
“Keep them overnight and find a shelter in the morning. I have the day off tomorrow, I plan to actually
“Mrs Hudson!” He yelled hoarsely. He got no answer and groaned. “Mrs Hudson! The door!” There was still no response and the knocking continued. If it was Lestrade, he would have let himself in by now. Mrs Hudson was apparently out at the moment, and Sherlock muttered as he shoved off the couch and stumbled down the stairs, shrugging into the parka without thinking about it. It was instinct, really, and he pulled the door open with a bit more force than strictly necessary, completely prepared to tell off whoever had come banging on his door to not-so-kindly fuck off. And froze mid-sentence when he saw the man standing on his doorstep. He blinked a few times, wondering if he was dreaming or not. It was him. It was John Watson. He was here. At Baker Street!
“I’m so sorry, sir, I tried to stop her!” Sally stumbled at the door, trying to catch her breath. He waved off her apology.
“Yes, sir?” Sherlock reappeared with a shuffle, flushed and grinning like the boy he really was. John sized him up a second time and made a split-second decision he couldn’t quite regret. He closed the short distance between them and carefully put both hands on a narrow waist, fingers sliding against slick skin. The cocky bastard hadn’t even taken a towel. He chuckled and leaned up on tiptoe a bit to make contact. It wasn’t a perfect first kiss or even a really proper one, but it certainly did the trick.
“Don’t struggle, Ms. Mendez, it’s not going to end well for you either way.” Judith said in a low, threatening tone, applying that bit of pressure to the back of Claudia’s neck, “You’re already in trouble for harassment and assault of a senior detective of New Scotland Yard, no need to add resisting arrest to your charges.”
“Oh, don’t mention it, John!” Wanda gave him a tight hug, “You’re family, for God’s sake! I’m just so glad to know that awful woman can’t hurt you anymore. You, or your sweet little girl.”
Going back to her car for a moment, she looked around and took note of a few things. There were several bars in the vicinity, the late-crowd was spilling onto the streets, and those who saw her nodded respectfully, slurring their greetings.
The radio went silent and she checked her time. This was definitely going on over-time. Returning to the Rover, she stopped by Angelo’s over in Soho to get dinner, waiting until she got to Brixton and had parked on a corner to eat. She reported in when she reached her post, took a few minutes to reorganize and eat, and drove the streets looking for anything out of the ordinary.
“I suppose that is something to be grateful for, yeah?” She rolled her eyes, knowing very well the sheer volume of trouble Sherlock was capable of getting into just by himself, never mind John.
have to know everything, love. A bit of surprise is good for a soul.” She sighed and shook her head, but she left it alone for now.
, then. And definitely DeVil’s fault. Nudging the affectionate, clingy Dalmatian off his lap, John got up and didn’t bother to try and brush off the dog-hair as he held out one hand to the couple, who apparently recognized him.
“That was fast.” He sighed, shrugging into his coat and wincing as his shoulder objected a bit. His sense of awareness tingled and he looked to his right without moving his head too much. A black car sat by the kerb, innocuous but intimidating. John knew a government vehicle when he saw one and rolled his eyes. The driver appeared and opened the back door in the time it took him to register the car and its purpose, and he sighed as a familiar figure emerged from the back seat of the car.
“I play the violin when I’m thinking. Sometimes I don’t talk for days on end.” Sherlock got to his feet, looking down at the unassuming homeless man before him, “Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.”
“Hey! Ouch!” Looking down, she found the culprit. Judith chuckled and reached down to give her small assailant a boost, “Oh, hello there, Galileo.”
“Anderson, for God’s sake, leave alone!” Lestrade snapped, “That’s enough of you both! Christ! All I need is one answer! One clue!”
“John?” It was a breath of a name he hadn’t spoken out loud in almost five years. Turning around, he backed up a few paces and looked up at where he thought he’d heard the laughter. No immediate sign of John, but if that hadn’t been him, Sherlock was in far worse shape than he’d thought and hallucinating things that didn’t exist. It wouldn’t be the first time, would it? He had seen far more of John in the past five years than he’d expected to, but not
“How many times have you seen him?” Greg was already in work-mode, had been since they had called his team to Brixton probably.
did, though. You landed on your feet, for Christ’s sake! No one lands on their feet like that, not out of the Astral Plane like that, on their first time.” Her brother was on one side of her, one hand on her shoulder, grounding her back to the physical world.
“Apparently he liked what he saw yesterday.” Donovan shrugged and pocketed her phone, “Although, it was pretty neat to see someone else pull one of Holmes’s tricks and leave him staring. No one can do that.”
“Well, sorry to give you that, but can’t let a taxi drive with a bad light.” She shrugged, “Have a good night, sir.”
about that?” John folded his arms across his chest and leaned against the back wall of the lift. “You said that Holmes would be in the chem labs and you were wrong about that.”
“A collector.” Sherlock was already building an Evidence Wall, “John, what should we call this one?”
“In the wind. He’ll surface when he needs to, but right now it’s better for him to stay under The Met’s radar.”
“God, yes!” She got up from her desk, “Get me out of here, Sherlock Holmes, and I’ll do anything for you.”
, Majesty. I never ever dared hope there would be someone in this world who cared enough to risk themselves like that. Moriarty is one of the most dangerous men in the country.”
“Oh, look at that. Guess Mycroft was right.” He made a noise in his throat as he sipped at his tea, “Saw
“They always said the pen was mightier than the sword,” John said cheerfully as he put his hands in his pockets.
“Thank you, Anthea. I know you’ve got far better and more important things to do than drive my car home for me.” The DI grinned sheepishly at his long-time assistant, who just offered a glimpse of a genuine smile as she took the keys from him.
With nothing on, and nowhere to really go, she set off north-west and walked for a while. It was nice to immerse herself in London again, no one really bothered her, and she made good time. She was in Whitechapel when she received a text message.
Things go a bit more the way of classic ACD canon here, and the way John and Sherlock meet is a bit different. Quite a bit different.
“Your friends will die if you don’t.” Jim’s voice became far more hostile. This wasn’t a game anymore.
“Ask him about what happened in Singapore sometime.” John’s smile was positively wicked and Sherlock was left to follow after him.
“Don’t apologize for someone like Sherlock Holmes.” John said, “You shouldn’t let him treat you that way.”
“A tame word for what you really are to her.” The man got to his feet and turned to face Greg, who was struck by how
“Yes, ma’am. It was his request that the new orders putting you into a long-awaited retirement and a life of...well, I refrain from saying leisure, you’re not the kind to sit idly by a fireplace and content yourself with small mundane tasks. No, William’s orders were very clear. He would have handed them to you himself if he’d been able.”
“An awful lot like you for a child you had nothing to do with.” Sherlock stroked the back of his neck, “In case you were wondering, and in the interest of full disclosure, it was a bullet-proof vest.”
“Yeah, we’ll see about that.” He headed for a sling-portal open to Baker Street, “Don’t mess with my sister, Strange, she’ll do me the honours!”
Judith was pacing the ruins of the Map Room in Kamar-Taj, waiting for Stephen to come back, and knew the worst had happened when she saw the tears on his cheeks. But the current trouble with the Zealots kept her from offering him any consolation. She found John in Hong Kong, and they stood witness to Stephen’s risky bargain with Dormammu. As the city continued on its way around them, it’s citizens unaware of what had just happened, they watched as Mordo decided it was time for a crusade.
“Shit. I found her alright.” Judith groaned, “Damn it!” She clicked her radio and called for Homicide before setting up the first stages of the crime-scene. She crossed her fingers she would get Greg Lestrade tonight, she needed a friendly face. Hell, at this rate she’d even put up with Philip Anderson, if she got five minutes with Greg and Sally.
The flight from Kabul to London took twenty hours, which included a brief stop in Germany to refuel and sleep. So, when they landed at London City Airport, and the first thing Sherlock’s phone did was start ringing, Judith was feeling rather spry and refreshed. She’d gotten a good solid ten hours of sleep, and at least two quality meals into her while she’d been in Germany. Sherlock was practically vibrating with wild energy and he answered the phone with barely-concealed glee.
“Sher.” He called softly. It got quiet in the kitchen and Pongo raised his head but didn’t leave his spot on John’s lap. A moment later, the homeowners appeared, an early-forties couple, dual-income household until recently, he designed computer games, she had been in fashion-design. She had worked for House of DeVil, in fact. Ooh. This was
“You’re reckless, but you’ve always been that way, and expecting you to change now is unfair. Just be more careful.” She sipped her tea, “Especially with someone like Moriarty in play now. We don’t know anything about him, who he is, where he came from, or what his motives are.” Sherlock hummed in agreement, and it was quiet for a while. The cats had gone into hiding and had yet to surface, John found them up in his room sleeping on the bed. Sherlock collected their empty mugs, took them to the kitchen and rinsed them out before setting them on the drying-rack for the next morning.
“That’s it, that’s it. I’ve got you. Sleep well, my love.” She slept well that night, and they were both awake at their usual half-four start-time.
good at her job, and was well on her way to solving a string of suicides that had plagued the city since last October by herself, but the promotion still came as a bit of a shock to him and the rest of their family. It wasn’t
one in person. Most of the time they were very normal-looking, in nondescript civilian street-clothes, not drawing much attention to who they were and what they were capable of. And he had just come face-to-face with three at once, and three very irate and angry sorcerers to boot. Greg couldn’t say he was too sorry for the nasty shock.
“Oh, lovely. That’ll do, when we figure out what in hell’s name is going on around here.” Greg rolled his eyes.
“More than.” John came back to himself with a shake of his head and he looked at his gifted young Quartermaster. “Thank you, Q.”
Yes, Moriarty's goons took Judith! No, he is NOT pleased, and neither is Judith. Come to think of it, I doubt ANYONE is thrilled about it. Wrong Watson, you morons! But, that was a dummy-vest, so maybe not too bad? But then we get a reminder that Jim Moriarty is always going to be a charming, sick, twisted psychopath no matter how fond of someone he might be.
“Please not him. Please, God, not him.” Mycroft whispered under his breath. He was already running facial-rec, and it took less than five minutes for the system to get a hit on the patron in question. Unfortunately, the system came up with a perfect twenty-point match and Mycroft groaned. No rest for the weary tonight was there? Rubbing the bridge of his nose, and feeling the start of a headache that would sadly have nothing on the misery John Watson would be suffering, Mycroft let out a slow breath.
“Brought you a little getting-to-know-you present.” Sherlock called out on the pool-deck, “Oh, that’s what it’s all been for, hasn’t it? All your little puzzles; making me dance – all to distract me from
“Thank me when we get the puppies back.” He ended the call and slid his phone into his pocket. It was quiet as they returned to Baker Street, and they spent the rest of the day looking for other cases in the papers and on the web. Despite having been “dead” for three years, Sherlock’s website was still receiving posts from people needing help and they solved a couple of easy cases. John did the typing since Sherlock was supposed to be dead but
“If you don’t need anything, Judith, I’ll leave you to get some sleep.” John stood in the door as she looked around.
“It’s not just a bump from Special Constable, Greg.” She leaned against him, “Not that at all. I don’t know why she would do that to me when I
invisible. Something was coming for Sherlock, Jim had some awful game planned, and she hated being caught in the middle.
The press-conference was fairly straight-forward, as far as such things went, and when the question of a serial-killer came up, it got a bit more interesting. The crowded room was humming and they were sort of making it harder to keep quiet. But anything she had in mind for giving a piece of her mind to the press was way-sided when every phone in the room started buzzing. Not a phone-call, but a text message instead. Someone had hacked into the system and sent out a one-word message:
“...unless I kill myself – complete your story.” He looked at the madman who had completely turned Sherlock’s life upside-down with almost no effort at all. But how much of it was really Jim Moriarty’s clever dirty-work and how much of it was Sherlock just...giving up and playing the game Moriarty so desperately wanted him to play? And why couldn’t he shake the feeling that there was something Jim either didn’t know or had forgotten about? Something about his little hit-list. What was it?
hand to give Kitty some attention while he scribbled something in the margins of the file open against his knees.
They decided against calling in back-up just for the moment, but sat on the flat for a while to keep an eye on things. Mrs. Hudson went out after a bit, drinks with Mrs. Turner next door, she said.
. Her?!” Jim grabbed the man by the front of his shirt. Interesting that he was so angry. The goon gave him the information and Judith rolled her eyes.
“Well, Mycroft certainly didn’t waste any time, did he?” John muttered, pulling down his worn-out copy of Frankenstein.
“Dusted it yesterday, love.” Mrs Hudson patted him on the cheek, “Drafty and chill with the weather we’ve had, but not a thing’s been touched.”
Judith was aware of her surroundings, and knew she had picked up a tail at the corner of Baker Street and Marylebone Road. She got as far as York and Baker Street before she was jumped. Her tail hadn’t been expecting her to fight back, and she took down two of them before she was dropped in her tracks with a sharp needle-jab to the back of her neck. She was aware of being picked up and bundled into a nearby van, but that was the
dogs, but this kind of dedication is a little unusual for you two.” Greg flipped through the file, “I mean, you’re always meticulous and focused, but this…”
“Shutting you up.” She grinned and kissed him. It was rushed and sloppy, but she put a bit of her usual finesse into it and a little promise to come back from this patrol in one piece. It was a routine patrol, they weren’t expecting trouble, but that didn’t mean trouble wouldn't come for them.
need a shower, so out you go!” Watching Sherlock stumble out of the bathroom in a daze was far more satisfying than it should have been, considering he’d done nothing more than kiss the man, but John would be lying if he didn’t admit that his heart was racing. He wore a bit of a shit-eating grin, but he had nothing to be ashamed of. Sherlock had started it this time, had initiated. He would ask before assuming more was wanted, and constant communication was ever so important, but he didn’t see the young man refusing him outright.
Pleased with getting one over on his brilliant, arrogant brother, Mycroft set his phone on the table face-down and reached for the glass the server had put by his place.
“I didn’t expect you both to stay and help.” Stephen looked at them, “But I’m grateful. You can go back to London.”
“A bit of a, erm, retirement present, if you will.” Q just grinned at him, all unruly dark curls, dimples, and iridescent hazel eyes that shone behind practical, functional glasses with thick black frames that should have been gaudy but were quite stylish. At least, they were on the youthful man who ran the division once overseen by Geoffrey Boothroyd.
“But that’s such a long time!” Oh, she had him good. He was still standing there as they pulled away, the saddest lost-puppy expression on his face. Her guys knew better than to pick on her about a new conquest, but the knowing looks and snickers in the truck were not subtle. Judith just shook her head and checked the mirrors for a last glance of the very charming Will Holmes. That wasn’t his name, though, she knew that now. That, if she wasn’t mistaken, was a grown-up Sherlock Holmes.
“Can you two please not do this on my scene? Please?” Lestrade chuckled, looking at John. “Are you the one who rescued Sherlock’s coat, then?”
“For venting? It’s fine. I get the feeling you don’t have a lot of girlfriends or get out much beyond your work obligations.”
It never mattered in barracks or mess-halls or even in the offices and command centres, but when it got around to the hospital-tents, that’s when things got nasty. She had seen her share of inspections, and nearly every time she received a warning from her superiors to behave the next time, these people signed their paychecks and controlled their budgets. The last thing any of them wanted was a smart-mouthed medical officer to tell off the wrong government official and get vital funding pulled.
“Nah. I usually only stick around if they need my help on a private case. This was a quick visit, and they both knew it.” She started the Rover and checked for traffic before merging.
“A bit behind, actually, until tonight.” She shrugged, “We haven’t gone public with the theory, there’s enough concern on the streets without us actually saying the words.”
“Yes, yes, we hear. Judith, come on!” Waving off his brother’s concerns like bothersome flies, Sherlock grabbed Judith by the hand and dragged her away from the plane, “You know what to do with her things, dear brother!”
word for her, that’s for damn sure,” John muttered, pausing to take a draw of his fag before blowing a stream of smoke into the night. “Fuck.”
“Nope. I’ve seen too much of the world to care about the small problems of the masses. Too many days of thankless work for a few hours of gratitude and gratification.”
John made some strangled noise and hated himself when Sherlock’s smile turned into a predatory smirk. Caught like a deer in the headlights. Fuck. He found himself face-to-collar bone with a very naked, very wet Sherlock in the time it took to blink. Everything he was holding hit the ground with a soft thump. The top of his head reached Sherlock’s jaw. A wetness on his cheek startled him out of his head and John refocused.
“This should be worth the price of admission.” He folded his arms across his chest and watched as Q tucked the pen into the mannequin’s pocket and clicked it three times, patting the dummy on the chest.
“I’m good for now, John. Thanks for…well, whatever this is.” She hugged her brother, “See you in the morning?”
Judith closed her eyes, comfortable in her spot, and leaned against the person to her left, resting her cheek on their shoulder. It was Donovan, but hell if the gifted sergeant minded at all. They had history far older than anyone outside this house suspected, it wasn’t like yesterday was the first time they’d set eyes on each other. Just…the first time in way too long for either of them.
At noon, she pulled off for a break around Regent’s Park and they sat at the top of Baker Street. She could
.” She leaned back, “I saw the past, the now, a future. I saw friends, family, strangers. Places I’ve never been and won’t see again.”
“Your…hands?” He frowned. Strange held up his right hand and Greg looked at it. There didn’t seem to be anything wrong, but a closer study brought up something that made him ache.
Judith doubted she could single-handedly convince him to put an end to this deadly game he was playing with Sherlock, but she had to try.
The walk from Barbican Station to the hospital was quiet, unhindered. When they got to Saint Bart’s Hospital, that was where she parted ways with Moran and Moriarty. Before they took off into the night on whatever business had them in Clerkenwell this late, Moriarty gave Judith his card. On the back, he had written “Call me!” in a flowing scrawl.
“To find John Watson and save his life!” That was yelled back to him as the door slammed. Mycroft looked at his PA, who was fixated on her Blackberry.
“Ah, but you’re one of the smartest.” He amended. John simply lifted the lighter to the end of the cigarette he had given Sherlock before pocketing the whole lot again.
piece of his history and looked over his shoulder at Sherlock, who stared like he’d parted the Red Sea or something. Shrugging, John headed for the chopper. It had been
“Okay!” She ran off and Sherlock followed her into the house. John heaved a sigh of relief and looked over at Sherlock’s parents, who looked relieved but saddened.
“Oh, just down…” He trailed off as he looked up and over his shoulder and finally got a proper look at the man’s face. “Oh.”
“New York? Who does she know from New York?” He took a gulp of hot coffee, “You didn’t get this from the canteen, did you?”
She was a bit surprised how many sorcerers lived in London, of different levels. The night she ran a power-mad sorcerer to ground in Whitechapel was the first time she had to use any of her own magic. He had wiped out a whole squad of police officers and taken to the streets. No one had been seriously hurt, but they were definitely going to feel it in the morning.
“I…abandoned you, Sherlock. Spilt my guts over your grave, and then a few months later I turn around and forget about you completely.” A sniffle, a stiffening of his shoulders. “I wish I could say you would have adored Mary, but...maybe you would’ve. I don’t know, she was so…so…”
“You’re going to need tending to, I’m afraid.” He licked at John’s wounds, which his mate allowed him to do.
“Of course, love.” Sherlock just smiled at Rosie, “Tonight, we’ll stay with Nana and Papi, would you like that?”
do that.” She headed off for the other end of Chester Place, Greg tagging along behind. They finished their run with breakfast at Cafe de Fred and showered at home before heading out for work.
“Oh, thank you, Judith! Bless you!” Someone kissed her on the forehead and she scrunched her nose. She hadn’t sang for anyone in years, let alone put words to Down to the River to Pray. She sang the first couple of verses by herself, Baxter picking up accompaniment, followed by Donovan, who startled Judith with her rather lovely alto.
“So…” He watched John as he moved around, his routine and movements as familiar as ever, and he took some kind of comfort in that. John had a towel around his waist, that same towel was used to dry his hair. That scar he had noticed earlier was easier to see now and he made a subtle, closer study of it. It was knife-work, alright, and it looked like John might have turned away just in the nick of time, given its location and apparent depth.
“Right that, Constable! Good evening!” The ringleader waved cheerfully. Judith chuckled and flagged down a passing vacant taxi with it’s light on after doing a head-count. There were six of them. Shaking her head, she raised her traffic-whistle to her lips and hailed down another oncoming cab for the revelers.
“Phone’s ringing, dear.” Greg indicated John’s phone, which buzzed as Sherlock tried to get his attention. He opened a text message attachment. It was a camera-phone image of someone he was a bit familiar with.
“It’s a press-conference, Greg, wearing a uniform isn’t going to hurt the cause.” She smirked, “Besides, I think you look rather dashing.” He rolled his eyes, grumbling about the collar. Judith chuckled and finished getting dressed.
“Back when he was a teenager.” Richard nodded, “I waited that long because I didn’t want to anger Beverley. See, she was so convinced that John was mine, but...well, how could he be? Doesn’t look a damn thing like me or any of his siblings.”
“I don’t mind at all.” She shook her head a bit, “It’s just hard to find good Lebanese in London. Where were you planning to go?”
. But one thing she insisted on, even though they were away from London, was their morning routine. It was glorious to run to the top of Great Hill and Gorda Peak to watch the sunrise, even though trail-running was quite a bit different from what they were used to, they adapted quickly. There was a certain tranquillity to the way of things on the island, and he wasn’t really looking forward to returning to the madness of London.
“Mycroft.” John nodded to the man who more or less ran the country. Because, really, what else could someone with the kind of power his brother held actually be
“There’s a chance she’s split town, we’ll find out pretty fast.” He let them read the warrants, “If you want to come along, we’re not going to stop you. Pretty sure the family will be there, they called in another tip about DeVil. How did you know it was her?”
like new, and she’s all yours.” Q tossed him a key-fob, that grin firmly in place. He wasted no time joining the Quartermaster when Q waved him over. He knew bloody well the car had undergone a complete overhaul and rebuild from wheelbase up in the very recent past.
! I don’t think I believe you!” The man spat, John saw a tremor in the hand holding the pistol. “I’m not letting you walk away, Holmes, you’ll go rat on me!” John could see now that the gun was a Colt 1911A1, poorly maintained, but he didn’t trust the man’s trigger discipline, or that the pistol would actually jam if fired. The model was built to be reliable no matter what you did to it, but sometimes ... well, John wasn’t taking that chance.
“Yeah, I’ll say. Hell, she might show up at the hospital, but that wouldn’t be her way. She stays out of our business, we stay out of hers. She’s there if we need her, but we kind of do our own things.”
“Somebody’s got to look after you, lot of you won’t look out for yourselves!” The friendly Italian just smiled and gave her a tight hug. “Now, go on with you. You’re still on the job.”
“Mm, I think I’m supposed to be the one saying that to you, but I see your point.” He reached up and touched the slightly dishevelled curls, a bit damp from the earlier bath, soft to touch and careful handling. Sherlock smiled and leaned into the touch, leaning towards John.
“Just his luck. And don’t worry about this one,” He looked at Sherlock as he ducked the line, “He’s with me and won’t be a bother to anyone.”
“I think you’re…a good person. Desperate and driven to do unforgivable things.” She tapped her fingertips together, looking across at her suspect, “Can you go to prison with a clear conscience?”
“There’s three of us, I’m afraid.” Q’s expression twisted a bit. “You’ve never met Sherlock, have you?”
“All of our students are shown the way, if they wish.” The Ancient One smiled as Judith got her feet under her, “But, you might want to brace yourself. The trip can be rather…exciting.”
“G-Greg!” He still wasn’t listening. He could hear her, but he was so focused. Greg bent and skimmed the items as far away along the floor as he could. He’d worry about that later. Judith was alive, shaken and going into shock, but she was alive. That was more than he could have hoped for when he realized that she had been kidnapped and somehow talked Sherlock into letting him come along.
“Rather out of our favour, I suppose, but there is no such thing as coincidence.” Sherlock rubbed his thumb in the centre of her palm, “The universe is rarely so lazy.”
loyal. But, oops!” He grinned briefly at Judith, then looked towards Sherlock and the others. All three of them were armed and fully prepared to take action.
“You’ll find the right one, just give it a few months to heal up before you dip your toes back into the dating-pool.” John just smiled and they headed for the motor-pool. He would take John, and pinged Sally to have her borrow another marked car to drive Judith out to the scene. He fired off a text to Sherlock with all of the details he knew about this latest case and received a swift response that he would meet them on-scene, and asked who was on Forensics. He rolled his eyes.
“Yeah, sure.” She swallowed on a suddenly-dry throat. She had expected John to tag along, but Greg was a rogue entity she hadn’t accounted for, and neither had Jim. Why had he come? Had they called him when they realized she’d never made it home, or had
half-eight, for God’s sake! I’m pretty sure your grandmother will understand that a rather serious family emergency got in the way of other plans!”
She caught her breath, trying to calm herself down from an oncoming panic-attack, “No, no, I’m fine, I’m just…um…maybe a little lost.” She looked around and sat down on the floor.
“Hi.” Sherlock just smiled and held him in place. “So … Mary in the morning and maybe we’ll go looking for dogs in the afternoon?”
“Take all the time you need, John.” Sherlock squeezed his hand, “If you need any assistance, let Mycroft know. He’ll be glad to help.”
Mycroft, all the man would admit to was handing over the letter of promotion written from somewhere inside MI6. John didn’t think James Bond had the pull to effect something this big, but M certainly did. Had their grandmother, who had always been there for them but had never stepped in on their lives unwanted or unasked for, finally gotten sick of sitting on the sidelines and done something about Judith’s career with The Met? God bless her if she had, that was a risky thing to do without warning any of them. Of course, John was intimately familiar with the level of outrageous miracles M and Mycroft were capable of pulling off both together and single-handedly.
doing under here?” She chuckled breathlessly as a mangy female cat prowled just out of reach. She saw a lump of indistinct fuzzy shapes behind the mother and realized that a litter of kittens had been whelped under a construction trailer.
“You noticed him.” Greg hummed, leaning over her shoulder the way she had leaned over Mycroft’s a moment ago, “Well, now what? We can’t just clap this guy in hand-cuffs and haul him in for questioning.”
“ID unauthorised, sir.” Some poor corporal was talking to the base’s highest commanding officer, Richard Barrymore. A few privates held John and Sherlock at bay. The two were rather calm, all things considered, she saw the annoyed tension in her brother’s shoulders.
“I thought you might pick those.” Magnus just smiled at him and set the tray aside. “Anything you want to add to them?”
For the occasion, they had both shaved and gotten a haircut, which was very much against what they liked these days. Well…not completely. They had both cheated. They didn’t look like a pair of homeless bums, but there was just enough of their recent looks left to make a statement that the John Watson and Sherlock Holmes everyone remembered from before November 2011 were not really there anymore. Time and experience had changed them both.
“If I hadn’t, you wouldn’t be married to that insufferable government prick.” John knew what had been left unsaid and smiled a bit. “You’re welcome, Greg.”
As she slid the door open, she was aware of the door to her quarters creaking open. Only a few people would be bold enough to come into her quarters like this, and she paused.
“I know. Sitting on reserve, not going anywhere, and the people who matter know that. I think he did it initially to threaten me, a message that I can’t stop him from getting rid of me, but now it’s more like if something comes up, I’m not just sitting there looking pretty.”
I’d take work as a Certified Paramedic or ambulance driver, that would be easy to get with my medical background.” And Mycroft would be more than happy to write him any letters of recommendation necessary to help him secure such a position if that’s what he wanted to do with his life.
“Not interested in better.” She reached up and ruffled his hair, still damp from the shower, “Not even close to interested in better. Too much to like here. Ah, there’s a smile.” She’d gotten a slight grin out of him. He snorted, which turned into a snicker, into a chuckle.
“It’s not much, of course, but it won’t do for the pair of you to keep starving yourselves and since you won’t be bothered to look after yourselves, someone’s got to.”
“He wouldn't. Brook isn’t as important to him as Moriarty was.” John leaned his head back, far calmer than Greg would have been in his place.
She escaped to a lift and headed back to Homicide and Major Crimes, bee-lining for CID when she got there.
“Just do as he says!” Greg yelled, gesturing for everyone to get down, and slowly the gathered police began to kneel.
“You’re starting to believe in something bigger than yourself. That’s why you stayed here, there was more you can learn, more you can do.” She shrugged, “Did I forget anything?”
“He doesn’t like me, it’s mutual. Your brother’s a bigger pain in the arse than you will ever be, and far less likeable.”
like gravity holding her still. Looking to her right, she saw the sparse early traffic passing her by on Grosvernor. To her right stood Davies Street, which she had been down many,
“If you hurt any of them, you won’t be safe. Be careful of your games, and what you want to play.” She took his hand, “Or you’ll find out the hard way that Watsons don’t play by the rules.”
“Try Big Brother showing up out of nowhere on a military base in Southern Afghanistan with a chip on his shoulder that makes the Titanic’s iceberg look tiny and a dislike for the working-class masses risking our fucking necks twenty-four-seven to keep the likes of his ungrateful poncy arse safe.”
“Well, we didn’t do much of anything. It’s those two who did all the hard work, we just helped.” The two constables from Risby that had been so helpful pointed to John and Sherlock.
The door closed behind Sherlock Holmes and Jim Moriarty, and John Watson’s portal crackled and sealed once he was through. Greg Lestrade didn’t move for a few seconds, his gun still aimed towards the door, then his gaze drifted across to Judith Watson. Right. He shoved his pistol into the hip-holster on his duty-belt, then dropped to his knees in front of Judith and started unfastening the vest.
“She doesn’t have a name yet, but I found her with a litter of kittens under one of the construction-trailers inside.”
“Does this mean we get a chance to be a proper family, John?” There was a tiny glimmer of hope in Sherlock’s eyes.
“Yeah, where are we going?” It wasn’t the only question going through John’s head, but it was certainly one of the more important ones.
The radio squealed as the dispatcher spoke. Rapidly Sherlock reached through the open window of the car with his free hand and pressed down on the Talk button after confirming Judith’s location behind him, she stood to his left. A high-pitched squeal of feedback broke the quiet commotion on the street. Greg, Judith, and Sally all three ducked and pulled their ear-pieces as the feedback ripped through their radios. Sherlock reached behind him and pulled Judith’s pistol from the holster with his free hand. It was too easy, she had snapped the holster and left it open for him. She
I’ll be mad at you.” John reached between them and took his hand, “And don’t forget, son, you’re engaged to a bloody sorcerer, good luck sneaking anything past
“Used to say somethin’ to the lot of ‘em, all the coppers.” The Homeless man raised his head and Sherlock finally got a look at his face. Slightly gaunt, pale, a short, trim beard of two months’ growth or so, thin wire-rim glasses, high-cut hair more grey than blonde from what he could see under a knit cap. The man wore a grey hoodie and ratty jeans, both were recently laundered but worn many, many times. Behind the glasses, his eyes were an alarming and intriguing blend of grey, brown, blue, and green.
We finally meet everyone's favorite consulting criminal mastermind. Things go a bit differently during The Great Game, as they have for most of the story so far! Yikes?
“You “borrowed” your brother-in-law’s handcuffs, sure,” John smirked and took the offered pair of bracelets, wasting no time putting them around Lachey’s wrists. “Speaking of, you
“Well, sure could have fooled me! You just put Sherlock to absolute shame a minute ago!” His smile was bright, “Name’s Greg Lestrade. You’ll be around a bit, then?”
“I take locums work for general practice when I can get it, part-time at a local clinic, but not enough to pay rent anywhere decent. I’m living with Mike Stamford at the moment, we went to Bart’s together ages ago.”
“I can’t begin to imagine the kind of trouble John and Sherlock are in if we’re being sent to Baskerville.” Judith shook her head as she got dressed in clean, pressed fatigues. Greg was packing a few days of clothes for them and looked up at her.
, don’t we?” Judith said savagely, and he saw sparks crackling around them. Wait, hadn’t Judith been in hand-cuffs earlier? Had she…had she used her magic to free herself while the rest of them hadn’t been paying attention?
“Okay. That is…weird.” She murmured, studying a relic of some kind contained behind glass, “What is this place?” Judith explored three rooms without seeing anyone, when she was absolutely certain this place wasn’t abandoned, until she reached a room of stone pillars with a set of great doors on one end carved with a symbol that looked very similar to the one on the massive front window.
“No!” John snarled, pulling away from him, “It’s not something you get used to! It’s never something you get used to! Never let someone treat you like that!”
On one occasion she had spent six hours of her own time, while on the clock, tracking a tricky suspect across half of London. She had ended up pursuing the bastard right off of the Millennium Bridge into the Thames in the course of a foot-chase. A River Patrol boat had hauled her from the water six minutes after she cleared the railings and she’d spent the night in Saint Bart’s. Another boat had dragged the suspect out a few miles downriver, waterlogged and half-dead from exhaustion and hypothermia. Greg had been at her side from the minute she was pulled from the water until they discharged her the next morning. , He’d actually been on that boat and pulled her from the river himself. It had not been a pleasant night for either of them.
“On your knees, Lachey. Hands behind your head.” This time, Lachey went down on his knees, hands kept where John could see they remained empty.
“Then, I’m right and my brother owes you an apology.” She waited while the call rang through and put the call on speaker-phone, “But I am not above hunting this moron through London tonight.”
“Ugh! For god’s sake, Greg, leave him be!” She moaned, “And how do you know he lives over here anyway?”
“Well, I found Kitty, and Sherlock clearly isn’t out.” John said quietly, “He’s not in the kitchen, so ... ” A quick check found the bedroom empty, and he rolled his eyes. Shaking his head, John looked around.
“What do you know?” Sherlock swept back the tails of his coat, thinking of all the times John had grabbed it to keep hold of him on the run during a case, and knelt by the Homeless, “You’re new.”
“Okay, you’ve got questions,” Sherlock said after a while, not really looking up from his phone. What was he
“They wouldn't take me at first. I spent nearly a whole day sitting outside their door, begging them to let me in, to teach me.”
“bhautik duniya ke lie meree aavaaj ka paalan karen. aap kaaphee lambe samay se phans gaya hai. apane mitron aur parivaar ko tumhaaree jaroorat hai.” That wasn’t English, he didn’t know
“We met at The Criterion this afternoon. We visited Saint Bart’s after talking for a bit and a round of drinks.” He said. “I got to meet Doctor Hooper, she’s quite lovely.”
“God I love having friends in the government.” She muttered, padding across the room to peek over his shoulder, “I promise most of this is wet from the fog.”
“Already have.” Sherlock waved his phone at him. John just nodded and they waited for the police to arrive once they had Lachey immobilized.
“If I felt like giving someone a heart attack? Maybe!” John set his fork down to take a sip of his tea.  Mycroft just gave him a look that usually meant some sort of trouble. Not for him, specifically, but for someone else. He returned the look with a level, slightly disinterested one of his own. They were used to playing this game, it had just … been a while.
“Baker Street. London. We’re home, John, we’re safe.” She smiled and held out one hand, not nearly close enough to touch, “Breathe deep, brother, breathe slow.” She slid onto the bed and perched just out of harm’s way, kneeling in place. Sherlock joined her.
She signed off and accessed her shift-logs, remotely clocking out with several hours of overtime on her chart for tonight.
“Thanks, love. You’re a keeper, Q, for putting up with me all the time like you do.” She kissed him on the cheek and popped a couple of mints as she headed upstairs to see her grandmother.  She realized about halfway there that she had forgotten to ask if Bond was around, but would find out in no time.
And that was the last she heard before the line clicked over. She stood dead still as a woman stepped through the doors, through some kind of barrier. It looked like pure energy. Magic. But…
“Go on in, I’m right behind you.” He pushed her through the doors as they slid aside, one hand tight on her shoulder to keep her focused. He saw an older gentleman, probably in his sixties or seventies by the looks of him, with dark hair going gray and mild features. His eyes were a soft brown, framed by prominent crows-feet from laughter and squinting in the sun and a pair of rather elegant spectacles, his skin a dark tan you only got from hard honest labor outdoors.
“Right. Your service-history is a bit shorter than Judith’s, yeah?” He shook his head, “She’s been in the Army almost as long as I was married, for Chrissakes.”
! You’re Rachel Donovan’s girl Sally!” Sarah grinned, showing a few missing teeth, “All grown up now, right, and off to work for New Scotland Yard? Haven’t you gone some high places?” Judith looked at Donovan, who didn’t look as ashamed as she probably should have.
When Mrs Hudson came up with tea, she found them curled up together, wrapped in a hand-knit Afghan blanket, listening to a recording of some of Sherlock’s music. All she did was smile and set their cups on the coffee table where they could reach them but said nothing. It was very clear that she was excited they were home but knew to keep it to herself. It was quiet in the flat, no one spoke, but when Mrs Hudson collected their empty cups, she leant over and patted him on the cheek.
“Judith, talk to me. What is going on?” Greg pulled her away from the door and sat her down at his desk, “I know for damn certain it’s only the fifteen years you were in the Army that’s kept you from breaking down. What happened?”
“Mm, don’t think so. Come on.” She headed for the staging-grounds to see how much time she had. She had her schedule practically memorised, but sometimes it was good to double-check. Hooked to the wall was a roster-log, and she took it down to read the names. Will read over her shoulder as she read down the list of names written on the log. There she was, slotted to take lead on the out-going patrol.
“Texted your boss’s handler. Jim’s with Seb Moran right now, you can stay here if you want.” Judith looked at Brook, who was white as a sheet. “Are you going to be okay? I can call a patrol to sit on the flat if that would make you feel better about your own safety.”
He was debating a proper response when his radio squawked at the same time his desk-phone rang. John picked up the radio and adjusted the volume as he picked up the phone.
It took John almost two hours to find it, buried in a skip under a pile of trash-bags. It reeked of god knows what, but John retrieved the coat, a beautiful custom-made Belstaff coat with red button-holes on the lapels and a blue cashmere scarf stuffed into a pocket. Bundling the coat into a handy, clean paper sack, John made his way home. He would have the coat cleaned tomorrow and return it to its owner at the soonest. He had an old Army buddy of his who ran a bespoke dry-cleaning service, gave fellow vets a healthy discount and did uniforms for free up to three full kits.
“No, you haven’t. I like you, even if you won’t give me the courtesy of a name. I’m not asking for much, you know?”
“Well, it’s not every day he has to put up with the missing Aetherborn Prince of the Summer Court, is it?” John muttered, heading up the stairs slowly. Mrs Hudson gasped, one hand to her heart, the fingertips of the other to her lips.
“Won’t know until I see what we’re up against.” Greg shook his head, ruffling his hair with one hand. “Kind of depends on how long the body’s been in the water and what kind of damage we’re looking at. Molly’s going to hate me, I already dumped another one on her earlier.”
had it really been him. Someone with John’s face, or a figment of a troubled, sleep-deprived mind clinging to something familiar, a fragment of an old life discarded for a quest to rid the world at large of a subtle, smiling threat. But he’d done it, he had finally, really, done it. The last of Moriarty’s network was eradicated, he had also managed a few peripheral threats to ensure the continued safety of his family and loved ones, even if they never knew he’d done a thing.
Sherlock sat on the bed, long legs stretched out, back against the headboard, looking at something on the tablet John had given him for his birthday last year. God, had it been that long? Hearing him come out of the bathroom, Sherlock looked up and when he saw the expression on John’s face, he quickly set down the tablet.
While he was busy grooming John, the rest of Lestrade’s team arrived, bringing with them the coroners’ van and an ambulance. Sherlock watched things unfold from his perch on John’s back, while John lay curled up by the front door of Baker Street, and when he was aware of someone picking him up, he almost bit them before he realized it was just his brother.
“Yes, another victim.” She narrowed her eyes at him, “Now unless you have information for us or a legitimate concern for your little brother’s well-being, you can just go on your way and bother Baker Street another day.”
“Wouldn’t know that from the way she goes after you, would you?” John rolled his eyes. Mycroft stayed long enough for a night-cap before taking his leave, John saw him to the street.
case. “I wish my story had the ending yours did, but my pelt was stolen against my will, and he stole my coat, too. I got my coat back, but he didn’t give me back my pelt. One of my brother’s people must have recovered it from Moriarty sometime earlier and retrieved yours from your flat, bringing them both here, very likely while I was asleep and before you arrived.”
“No buts, Mr Holmes. Yes I know your name, I recognised you the minute I saw you, I just didn’t know why.” She looked down the line of jeeps, “I’ve got a job to do, and as much as I like you, I’m not going to not do my job just because you don’t think I should be driving the lead-jeep.”
“Are you going to fuck me, old man, or do you need more time to get it up?” He would be damned if Sherlock didn’t wink at him. John just reached down, stroking along the pale, marred skin to Sherlock’s thin wrist. Moving carefully and quickly, he pulled out until just the head rested against the ring of muscle and took hold of the young man’s wrists, pinning them above his head.
good, we were right behind them leaving The Met.” Donovan wrinkled her nose. “But I think he’ll appreciate us not getting into a wreck on the way over just because you said something about Anderson.”
“Take your time.” He murmured during a pause to let Sherlock adjust, “Got all the time in the world.”
Andre took them out to the London City Airport Jet Centre and they boarded the waiting Cessna 650 Citation III that Mycroft Holmes had offered them for the duration of their trip. She slept for most of the nineteen hours they were in the air, sleeping through at least
“I can’t see from here. It might be.” She frowned, “If it is, then he’s a bit more of a psychopath than I thought. Only the worst of them will stalk their own crime-scenes to revel in the reactions from law-enforcement.” Her on-board laptop pinged and she looked down to see where the tracking-device she had set earlier had placed Hope’s cab.
“Jim Moriarty. Hi!” The besuited madman introduced himself. Sherlock tilted his head as he looked more closely at the man. Why did his name sound familiar? Where would Sherlock have heard it before? Had they met somewhere and he simply didn't remember?
She took off for Baker Street, lights and sirens on, and they made the twenty-minute drive in easily half that.
“No thank you, Anthea.” He didn’t hesitate to turn her down. Anthea knew Judith and liked her, and probably knew why he had said no to getting his coat cleaned. That night, as he had expected, Mycroft slept well. The people important to him were safe and well. And that was truly something, as very few people were so important he would arrange deportation orders to some of the coldest, most hostile places on earth for their sakes.
“If I do something stupid, I won’t do it because I wanted to. Don’t believe anything I might say or do once we go our separate ways.”
“Judith, calm down. You just got the absolute worst news anyone ever gets, you can be forgiven for letting it slip your mind. I mean, it’s
“Hasn’t seen me in nine months, Sherlock, you in three years.” He went out again after washing his hands, “You’re not
When they got to The Met and reported to their work-spaces, Judith spent some time arranging her desk. She didn’t have much in the way of personal effects, but Greg had brought in a small box of things for her to use in decorating her cubicle. Mostly pictures from her time in Afghanistan; well,
“Shot in the dark. Good one, though.” Sherlock smiled at him, “Power connection: tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he goes to plug it in to charge but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man’s phone; never see a drunk’s without them.” He handed the phone back to John. “There you go, you see – you were right.”
“Yes, sir.” Judith smiled and squirmed a bit to make more room, “Oi, Baxter, budge over, mate!” Obediently, Gerald’s eldest son, who was three years older than Judith, squeezed over to make a space. Malembe’s wife Sarah brought out tea and biscuits, which Judith and Donovan were happy to accept. Sarah peered at Donovan, and put a hand on one hip, eyes narrow as she looked the detective sergeant over.
“Of course! Good night to you, ma’am!” He saluted and ducked into his cab. She watched until the cab was out of sight, followed it to the corner to make sure, and ran back to the house. Before she made entry, she radioed back to Dispatch.
This is a short one. Sorry. I broke up Part 2 of A Spot of Mystery, figuring the formal, public return/resurrection of John Watson and Sherlock Holmes deserved it's own chapter. I might put up more in the future, despite this being marked "Complete", I have more written.
, her good mood was infectious. Clad in board-shorts, a vest, a flattering two-piece swim-suit, and an unfastened PFD vest, her hair wild from salt-spray and wind, she still commanded the room. The Watsons were good at that, he’d noticed. Watching her mingle, Greg tried to reconcile that this kind of energy and personality was all his to do with as he wished. All he had to do was ask nicely.
“No, don’t. It’s...fine.” Sherlock looked at John, who looked ashamed of distracting him. “It’s fine.”
“Would you stop apologising? For Christ’s sake, the only person who should be apologising is Major Kendrick, for the way he behaved in the hospital-tents just now.” She saw the dark curls tremble with the shake of his head, and turned as he climbed up onto the truck next to her.
“Ladies.” Sherlock ducked under with a winning smile, “Couldn’t help but overhear that last bit. You’re too pretty for that expression, Sally.” He took Sally’s hand and kissed her on the cheek, making her blush, “That’s more like it.”
They found their way back to the London Sanctum, where she parted ways with Strange. He kissed her good night before disappearing into the Sanctum, returning to Kamar-Taj from there. Judith drove home, feeling much better than before. When she checked her messages, there was nothing from Greg aside from a check-in text letting her know he was still working on the most recent case.
“Bother with plebes, I know.” Judith racked her Browning and chambered a single round, ensuring the safety was fully engaged before she returned it to the holster. “I suppose I lied a bit in Afghanistan.”
“Mm. I’ll see you in the morning, Sherlock. Do try not to blow up the kitchen while I’m asleep, will you?”
“Oh, it was amazing! I’ll take you out some time, it’s such a thrill!” she hugged him tightly, neither of them minding that she got him a bit wet, “Keep yourself busy while I was gone?”
“Right behind.” She followed him down the stairs and out to the waiting car. Mycroft was giving them a ride to The Met, a very kind gesture, and it was quiet as they joined early traffic. Anthea had been a busy woman, fetching clean clothes for Judith and Greg from the Pembroke Mews house and picking up takeaway from Cafe de Fred so they wouldn't forget to eat.
“Come visit me in London and I’ll return a favour,” Judith said over lunch. She had last eaten nearly twenty-four hours ago, and her New York friends had noticed.
“She was exiled.” John leaned his head back and looked up at the cloudy sky, it was going to snow soon.
“Oh, you have!” A bright smile split the woman’s face, her eyes lit up. “Oh, Sherlock, I’m so proud of you! It’s about bloody time, young man! So, then, who is he? When do I get to meet him?”
“Well, now you know I’ve got licensing and clearance to fly an EC135M.” He chuckled and looked at the controls, making a small adjustment. The chopper gave a slight bounce as they hit a thermal, but he’d steered through gunfire and the leading edge of a sandstorm, making corrections for thermal turbulence was easy. They searched through the night, stopping once to refuel, and as the sun came up over the village of Risby, three miles west of Bury St. Edmonds where John and Sherlock had spent the past two months holed up in hiding while Mycroft handled the threat posed by Morstan, they got a ping. Sherlock saw it first before the radar caught anything and called it in.
“Also, the biggest by far I’ve ever seen, or taken.” He said, “I can’t wait to feel it inside me.” Well, shit. That was a first. John hoped to Christ the whimper wasn’t something Sherlock could actually hear.
“Like hell I don’t. I’m not about to let the likes you walk home right now, Aetherborn. Come with me.” Lestrade was already heading for where he’d parked his car, leaving them no choice but to follow.
It was a good thing she did, he was sitting on the edge of the double-bed with his head in both hands, the lights off, and she could just see his shoulders twitching. This wasn’t work, this wasn’t the alcohol, well, not
“Alright, I’ll stop. I like surprises.” She leaned across the bed and gave him a kiss, “I’m sorry, that was mean of me. How are we getting there?”
“All of Lieutenant-Colonel Watson’s things are inside in the first upstairs bedroom, Inspector. Mr. Holmes sends his regards and asks that you remember the arrangement.”
“No, I know, I know. Christ, I was worried about you!” He cracked a smile, “Guess I’d better go find the doctor, eh?”
“Thank you. Bless you.” Jim blinked and lowered his gaze as if blinking back tears. After a moment, he raised his head and looked at Sherlock, leaning in to whisper something to him. The words he’s been waiting for: “As long as I’m alive, you can save your friends; you’ve got a way out. Well, good luck with that.”
“Mm, it was John.” The twins smiled at each other and Greg suddenly felt very sorry for the criminals of London if they decided to pool their resources together with Sherlock Holmes. As he filed Judith and Sherlock’s statements in the proper case-file, he noticed that John had a cane. He had missed that detail earlier at the hospital, but it was only to be expected with so many people and so much going on. He frowned and looked up at the charming, slightly-dangerous blond.
“Up is the only way she can go.” John sighed and tuned in to see where on the rosters they were reading names from. Still not to Judith’s class, but they were getting there. It was a smaller group, so they’d be calling her up soon.
He had only met the man once, heard him speak a handful of words, but he recongized Judith’s brother’s voice right away.
“I can take you some time if you want to go. I don’t think my masters would mind.” She took his hand in hers, “You actually believe me.”
“Just remember to aim for the bucket. And don’t forget to drink between bouts, alright?” She doused two flannels with water and folded one to lay against the back of his neck before she covered his head and shoulders with the towel. She stood in front of him, blocking him from the rest of the crew, waiting for his body to signal its slow-down.
Thirty minutes later, they reached a barricade of cars and tape. The place was swarming with blue-and-white lights, marked and unmarked cars alike, uniformed personnel, and a familiar sense of urgency. But there was something about the way the personnel milled about at their tasks that struck John as ineffective as he followed Mycroft and Greg, not missing how no one really seemed to question Mycroft’s presence on the active if poorly-run crime-scene. They were met at a secondary line by a woman in a skirt suit and heels, she might have been pretty if that was John’s thing. But her attitude was a turn-off, and it was clear she had very little self-respect where it actually mattered.
“Second trailer on the right, back of the lot.” She rubbed her nose, “I’ll figure out what to do with the kittens later.”
“Mum is going away for a long time, Rosie. But she won’t be able to hurt Sherlock or anyone else again.” John touched his daughter’s cheek, “I promise.”
