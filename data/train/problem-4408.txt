“Fine by me,” Dean said.  “I never intend to let it happen again anyway.  But this is something that Cas and I were talking about right before you came in, Alfie.  Full disclosure.  Sammy and I fought and, in my timeline, never spoke in person again because we were each operating on only half of a story.  We need the whole thing.  Because the whole point of Project Samandriel was to go back and correct a mistake...”
“Because it doesn’t make sense,” the angel explained.  “To be chosen as a vessel is the greatest honor a human can have.  My own was still weeping tears of joy as I took him.”
“No, actually, I don’t think so,” Chuck corrected.  “It’s funny.  Sam screamed his head off, probably said words I’d prefer were never repeated in this house again.  But I didn’t hear any bangs or crashes.”
Castiel moaned and cradled his head.  “No!  No, no, no! Dean, please, don’t argue with me about this now!  Someone came after me and you got shot and you could have died!  What if it wasn’t just your arm?!  I just need to make sure you’re safe and I won’t take it off and I don’t understand why you’re so upset and please please just stop yelling at me!”
Worried green eyes looked up at Dean.  “You’re going to steal something again, aren’t you?  You’re eighteen now, Dean!  The next time you get caught, you’re going to jail!”
Castiel tightened his grip on Dean’s hand.  “I don’t care about the laws that say you can’t contact a former contract owner.  I...”
Gabe and Mike were looking at each other now. Mike gestured to Gabe, who sighed. “I’m sorry,” he said.  “But I vote yes.”  His eyes met mine, pleading as I stared at him in shock.  “I have heard everything everyone said, and while it’s great in theory, practice is a different story.  And yes, Samandriel, I’m aware that my own insecurities, that I somehow managed to miss a plan to steal an Angel and let this happen to him, are likely playing a part.  Dean, I have no doubt that you’re just as good a bodyguard for Cassie as Sammy is for me. But Dean, I also see that you watch him constantly.  You almost always have some physical contact.  It’s sweet, but it tells me that you aren’t exaggerating when you say that Cas needs to be constantly watched.  Like Luc said, you’re human.  I want you right in his section with him, but I want him locked in. Sorry.”
It finally did.  He could hear Michael and Lucifer laughing as they went into the house.  Dean had been left alone.  Castiel got to his feet, wanting to go to the man, offer comfort, maybe medical care...
Rufus accepted the bottle.  He held it against the edge of the countertop, expertly banged it with his other hand, and the cap went flying.  Ignoring both the cap and the small dent he’d just made in the counter, Rufus took a long chug of the beer.  After draining about a third of the bottle, he belched loudly and, ignoring Dean, glowered at Cass.  “I recognize the kid’s name, though.  Saw it in the papers.  Why’s he here with you?  The hell you get into this time?”
“But the internet does, right?”  When Bobby confirmed this with a nod, I went on.  “Cas, do you think you could use the internet?  You’d have to do it the old-fashioned way, but...”
I believed in Castiel.  I just wished that the process for sending us both back together hadn’t taken quite so long.  By the time I’d gotten the tap indication from my wristband and was able to jump with my angel, the other four bastards were there, desperate to separate us, upsetting Cas.  But I still believed in him.  I’d made that terrifying jump.  And I’m not ashamed to admit that I came perilously close to shitting my britches. But even when we were falling, when the ground was coming closer and closer, even when Castiel himself, sure he was about to die, had turned his head and buried his face in the side of my neck, I still believed in Castiel.  I’d pressed the buttons in the order Cas had instructed me just before I’d jumped.  0-1-2-4. My birthday, just one more way my sweet angel showed his love for me, even when I’d been too scared and stupid to say it back.  Now the lights on both of our wristbands were flashing rapidly.  I didn’t know if that was good or bad.  All I knew was that the ground was coming up fast, that Cas was clinging to me, the Angel the only warmth as the freezing wind whipped past. I held him tight, whispered again and again that it would be alright, that I’d never hurt him, that I loved him. My angel.  My Castiel.  I’ll save you or die trying.
Shocked, Castiel moved closer.  No one was in the driver’s seat.  Surely this wasn’t Dean’s Baby?  If it was, then where was...?
Cass considered this for a moment before nodding.  “I know you were part of my capture.  That doesn’t matter.  What I told you about the two of us is true, Dean.  While I believe in the free will I fell for, and destiny means little with my Father gone, I can’t deny what I felt when I touched you.”
To his embarrassment, Cass heard Dean’s stomach growl and chuckled.  “I think it’s time we went back and had some lunch,” Cass noted.
Dean brought Cass’s hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles.  “I’m here, Cass.  Let’s get you out of here.  Then we can figure out what to do next, ok?”
“He’s been quite helpful.  That’s what I was doing when we all sat down, communicating with him.”  Ketch smiled, enjoying the looks he was receiving.  “I have contacts within law enforcement.  Creating a record like this wasn’t difficult for them.  As we speak, it’s circulating, along with an all-points bulletin.”
“Dean?”  The red glow was gone from Sam’s eyes as he looked at Dean, seeming to see his brother for the first time.
He got up, moving to the door.  He leaned his ear against it, listening as the security barriers closed all through his section.  He frowned.  He hated being locked in!  Castiel banged his hand on the barrier in frustration.  Turning, he started to pace.  Lucifer, he knew, would only get worse the longer he remained in overload. And if Gabriel was off-site, the situation was dire.
Naomi glowered at him, her lip curling into a sneer as her eyes fixed on the golden pin at Dean’s collar.  “Why is this
Meanwhile, the other Angels were starting the demonstration.  In the darkened room, holographic projectors were lighting up, filling the auditorium with images and sounds.  The Angels’ interfaces were being projected for the room, allowing outsiders a rare look at what each Angel saw and heard as he worked.  Right now, the room echoed with a babble of voices, dozens of them speaking in multiple languages, all conversing with multiple versions of Michael’s voice in their same language.  A floating holographic map lit up, displaying various countries around the world.
“Castiel,” I told him.  “We need Castiel in here, or at least on the network, and we need him fast!”
I snorted.  “Not hardly.  I told you, Cas is behind most of the biggest tech advancements in our time, either directly because he flat-out invented it himself, or indirectly because it came through one of his satellite labs or they improved on it.  It’s what he was designed to do.  He’s awesome!”
The cabin, Dean could see once he got closer, was completely engulfed in flames.  Cass was watching it, crouched down behind a brush.  The last remaining intact window shattered with a tinkling of glass as Dean came up behind Cass.  “What the fuck?” Dean whispered.
“Yeah, yeah, flutter off, would you, Feathers?  A man has a right to shit without an audience.  I’ll call you when I’m ready.”
Naturally, when Dean checked his thermos and announced there was enough for one more round, we all clamored to accept.
In answer, the angel spread his wings.  Doing so sent new waves of pain through him, but he needed to know how bad the damage was.
Charlie gave Dean a sorrowful look.  “Someone at Roman Enterprises leaked information.  Something hidden so well that even I couldn’t find it.  Castiel Novak?  He’s not really Castiel Novak.  Some time ago, it looks like Dick Roman did a favor for his family and altered his identity.  Because his real name is Immanuel Shurley, and he’s the son of Carver Shurley, of Shurley Electronics.”
Dean stayed as he was, leaning against the back of the futon with his eyes closed.  He felt a slight shift as Cass sat down next to him.  Then a warm, gentle hand was rubbing on Dean’s back.  “I didn’t take you to ruin your life, Dean,” Cass said quietly.  “I did it to help you.”
“Yeah, heh.”  Dean rubbed the back of his neck as an excuse not to meet Cass’s eyes.  “I suppose I could use something to eat.”
“Because I was the only thing that was real,” Dean recalled.  “He was so confused.  His programming was clashing with reality so much that he had no idea what was real and what wasn’t, except for me.  That’s why he needed me.  But if he lost me, he believed he’d lose it completely.”  Dean closed his eyes.  “Now he’s locked up somewhere, and his worst nightmare is a reality.  He must be going completely insane!”
“I know you’ve got a million questions, and I’ll do my best to answer them.  Since I’m sure you’ve been told or imagined any number of things, I’ll start with myself.  Alright?”
Dean felt his cheeks heat a bit.  “Well, I mean, well, look at me!”  He waved a hand towards the ankle cuffs.  “Unless you’re letting me go, all I can do is make the best of things, right?”  He paused.  “Of course, if you did just let me go, then...”
“Well, one of two things.”  Cass looked at Charlie for confirmation, nodded, and continued.  “One, we’re looking at a cover-up on a massive scale.”
“I know!”  Sam pounded his fist on the table.  “Dean’s lost in the system, tied to some high-level executive that works directly for Dick Roman himself.  And Roman knows who I am.”  Sam produced the notebook and flipped through it.  “I don’t remember what it was I found.  Something about a food warehouse, that’s all I really remember.  I know they grabbed me the very next day, because I don’t really remember much beyond my breakfast the day before.  It’s part of what I lost from the Demon Blood, but I’m sure this much is real.  When those goons grabbed me?  As they were injecting me with the Demon Blood, I remember one of them leaned real close and whispered it to me.  ‘Dick Roman sends his regards.’  I’m sure it’s real, because I remember his breath smelled like onions.  And look, you wrote it down multiple times.  I was repeating it over and over.  Those bastards came after me on orders from the highest level.  I’m sure of it!”
“Sgt. Novak!” Angelo barked.  Apparently, he’d realized that Dean was still there, trying to undo his carefully-laid plans.  “Who do you belong to?”
“Well, honestly, her leaving was a matter of time.  Angel Lucifer put her on report two days ago after Angel Castiel got out of his section and ended up stuck in a supply closet.  She probably was going to get fired anyway.  It’s the second time Angel Castiel got out on her watch because she wasn’t paying close enough attention to him.”
“Hey, angel.”  The familiar nickname made Castiel wince even as he smiled.  “Just checking in.  Did you eat supper?”
“Oh, I’m positive Dick knows who I really am,” Dean growled.  “That’s the only reason he didn’t just take me the first day you introduced me, because he’s after Sammy and he knew I wasn’t him.”
Dean had seen Ketch for an instant, peering around the corner to give Dean a quick nod as he’d started walking towards Cass.  Now he moved into the hall, leveling his weapon at Cass.  Dean knew he had to act fast.  He threw his arms around Cass’s neck and planted a kiss on the startled sniper’s mouth.
It was all Dean could do to force himself to let go of Cass.  He unwound his arms from Cass’s neck with extreme reluctance, groaning miserably against the upholstery of Baby’s back seat.  A scratchy woolen blanket was placed over him.  Dean pulled it snug around himself with a whimper.  Surprising.  He would have expected a survivalist like Cass to only have one of those stupid mylar survival blankets.  Dean wasn’t complaining.  The added warmth was appreciated.  He closed his eyes and sank into it.
The angel made a face.  “From what I have been hearing, he’s learned quite a few tricks that he’s put to good use.  Every time we think we’ve found him, he’s given us the slip.  Once, we were sure he was dead, but when we went to collect his vessel and make sure, he was gone again.”
Castiel was currently out on the roof while he waited for the blue indicator to light up again, Bartholomew hovering uncomfortably near.  That was one thing that Bartholomew did better than Dean.  As long as the blue indicator above the doors was lit up, Bartholomew was fine with Castiel going to his lab.  In fact, the substitute bodyguard encouraged him to do so, even occasionally pointing out that the indicator was on.  The end result was that Castiel was much more productive. But for some reason, he felt the need to escape to the roof much more frequently.
“Alright, I knew you idiots were doing something stupid!” Alfie complained as he stormed in.  “What are you...?  Oh. Um, we should turn this off!”
Cas went quiet again, and Bobby shot me a look. “Why do you want to go back to your time, Castiel?” Bobby asked.
“You two will be too busy with Huis,” Gabriel argued.  “I was already planning to take him once I knew Winchester was going away.  Cas, I’ll come get you tonight.”
Thank you for all the well wishes!  Husband and I were pretty sick, but seem to be finally recovering.  Hope everyone else is safe and healthy!
“Then they’re 100% idiots.”  Dean was scowling fiercely, but looked happier when the Angeli Quinque security team arrived, forcing the reporters back.  “Alright, I’m getting you in fast.  You ready?”
Michael smiled brightly.  “Of course you did!  And I loved having you, Cas!  I didn’t want you to leave.”
“Are you asking me why I treat you like a human being instead of an Angeli Quinque Angel to gawk at?  Because if you are, I hope that’s your answer.”  He reached towards Castiel’s plate, paused when Castiel flinched, and then carefully pushed Castiel’s hand down and openly looked at the engraving.  “‘Angel Castiel, Research and Development.’  That’s what it says.  It tells me exactly two things about you, Cas, your name and your specialty.  But there is so much more to you than that!  I knew that from the day I met you.  So no.  I don’t need to stare at you.”
“Ah, of course.  Sorry, Novak.  Stay seated, gentlemen, I just want to go have a look.  You mind, Novak?”
No answer.  Cas seemed frozen as we were swept along, the blue eyes gradually changing as his indicators moved closer to full.  And that was when it hit me.
Dean chuckled.  “You know, I like you, Samandriel.  Maybe it’s the whole psychology thing, but you’re the most, well, human Angel I’ve ever met!  Cas said you brought the humanity back to the others, and he wasn’t kidding!  They’re all so...  Normal!”
“No,” Cass insisted.  “There’s strong signal the entire way through the tunnel systems.  It’s vitally important that we know if there are any delays or accidents, anything that might block a tunnel.  If we don’t know exactly where every single transport is at all times, it could result in a catastrophic collision.  We’re talking massive loss of life, property, maybe even destroying the tunnel.  That hasn’t come close to happening since I took over.”
Castiel and Naomi were surprised into silence by their father’s yell.  Chuck looked supremely irritated.  He pointed a finger between the two of them.  “Sam has only been here a week and a half, and look at the two of you!  Now enough is enough.  I honestly was uncomfortable with it to start with.  Sam’s wearing a shock collar and consent is an issue.  So now, after seeing the way you two are fighting over him?  I am officially taking sex with Sam off the table for both of you.  And by sex, I mean penetration of any kind, fingering, fondling, frontage, any type of oral sex, kissing with or without tongue…  You know what, if you wouldn’t do it with me?  You’re not doing it with him.”
“He knows!” Castiel defended.  “Why else would he be here, risking everything, to tell you all this?  He’s here to help!”
A room.  Moonlight beamed peacefully through the panes of a window, providing the only source of light.  Dean gasped, pulling free from the Trickster.  His hand went up to his arm.  There was no pain, but his arm still almost seemed to burn where the angel had touched him.  He looked frantically around, seeing almost nothing in the darkness.  Even the Trickster himself was mostly hidden in the dark.  “Wha...?  Where am I?”
“I remember you had me and you jumped, Dean! I remember that very well!”  He looked frantically around.  “How did we get to dad’s cabin?  Dean, what is this?!  I need to go home!”
“We all visit every day, Raph,” Gabriel reminded. “We do that even when he’s got a steady bodyguard!”
Dean was certainly pouting.  He couldn’t bring himself to care.  He moved the package of frozen peas, revealing his blackening eye.  “You didn’t have to punch me in the face!”
“It’s ok.”  Dean flashed him a smile that made Castiel’s knees feel weak.  “You go knock their socks off with your presentation.  I’ll do my best to make you look good.”
“Recon,” Castiel explained, turning the sausages.  “A few of us went ahead, tried to scout things out.  I found a position and sighted in.  My role was sniper,” he explained, sensing Dean’s confusion.  “I usually started and ended our engagements, picking off guards and anyone who came after us.  I was instructed to take out a perimeter guard, which I did, and our scouts brought him back.  When we checked him out, looked through his papers, we knew we were in real trouble.  He had a full dossier on us, complete with names, pictures, and all our specialties.”
Besides, his sweet, innocent Immanuel, regardless of who his father was, could never grow up to be the kind of cold-hearted bastard Castiel Novak was.  Immanuel would never put Dean in a position like this.
“Wouldn’t surprise me.  But here’s the kicker, Cassie.  With the possible exception of Azazel, which frankly, I can’t blame the guy for?  Sam Winchester was never known to cross the line.  He and his brother dealt with the worst of the worst, people that they’d have done the world a favor if they’d just put a bullet in their heads.  But they didn’t do that.  They took those monsters down, brought them to justice.  Apparently, with Sam, that changed when he started hanging out with this Ruby chick.  Word is, she’s the one who got him on the Demon Blood.  After that, he went down fast.”
Cass, he knew, hadn’t slept much either.  The former soldier had camped out in a sleeping bag on a mat in the hallway, directly outside of Dean’s room.  While he’d closed the door to allow Dean some privacy, it barely mattered.  Any time Dean moved or made a sound, Cass would immediately get up, crack the door open and peek in on him.  Dean had pretended to be asleep each time.  Cass would watch him for a moment, quietly close the door, and lie back down again.  It was nerve wracking.  Being under such close constant guard drove home the fact that Dean was a prisoner.  The cuff made him feel like an animal.
For his part, Dean had invested in a bandana, fake gold necklaces, and a sleeveless shirt he for some reason referred to as a “wife beater.”  He was still wearing the sunglasses, although he’d put the hat onto the angel’s head.  Then he’d immediately insisted the angel take it off when they’d entered the restaurant.  Humans made little sense.
“I was wondering that myself,” Cass admitted.  “But we already know there’s clearly more to this than meets the eye.”
Normally, my brother’s antics would make me smile, but not today.  I quickly jacked into him.  Then I drew him in, diving back into Castiel’s mind to show Gabriel what I’d found.
I heard a familiar voice, glanced over into the corner, and saw Lenny and Barney, drinking with a few other guys I didn’t know.  I looked away, not wanting anything to do with them right now. But naturally, Lenny and Barney came over to me.  “Have a fight with your boyfriend?” Barney asked me.
“So that we can restore Heaven and Earth to what they should be,” Michael urged.  “Give up this nonsense and come with me.  Together, we can create a unified world, one that our Father would want to return to.”
Bobby’s jaw dropped.  “Holy shit!  Dean, that’s crazy!  So in your time, unless you had the money, you could get drafted into the military, turned into a cyborg, and then used as a spy for the rest of your life?!”
Castiel was seated next to Dean’s bed when the green eyes finally opened.  They fixed on Castiel, and Dean smiled.  “Hey! That worried little frown for me?”
“It’s a fucking Shurley!” someone else yelled.  “There’s not a man or woman in this room who hasn’t lost someone to the Convicted Laborer Program.  Now we finally have a chance to make him pay?  I say we take it!”
Even as he spoke, Dean knew it was useless.  Every time he pumped her chest, more blood spurted out of the grisly wound.  He was covered with it.  He blew air into lips that were rapidly turning grey.  Desperate, he turned to see what was keeping the clerk.
“No,” he said.  “She never wanted me.  And after The Incident, she hated me.  It’s alright, Samandriel.  I’ve had time to come to terms with it.”
I looked up at him.  “Cas, we’re obviously not in our own time, alright?  There are buildings outside that don’t exist anymore! So that means that Luc never gave those Huis rebels a well-deserved ass beating.  And that means they could still be out there!  No, don’t go into a panic!” I called quickly, seeing Cas’s eyes widen in alarm.  “I’m here, and I’ll protect you.  But to do that, I’m going to need you to help me, ok?  You need to stay close to me.  We need to hide the fact you’re an Angel, and let me do the talking.  Can you do that?”
“I could have told you that,” Ellen scoffed.  “Only sure way we found to get that shit off of Joanna Beth was to cut off her arm.”
Dick stared at him for a moment.  Then he laughed.  “You know, for the first time since I had you brought in?  I actually believe you.”
Lucifer snorted, handing Crowley’s chain to Meg, who quickly moved away with him.  “Says the archangel who couldn’t keep control over his own angels.”
Castiel forced himself to look up.  Dean had an odd expression on his face.  And suddenly, his hand was tight in Castiel’s hair, holding his head still as Dean kissed him.
My brother was unstoppable.  He stabbed his Angel blade through the first man he reached, not even pausing as he raised his arm and threw the body over his shoulder.  Then he grabbed two more and brought them sharply together.  There was a sickening crunch.  He shoved past them as they fell, grabbing the next enemy, crossing his arms before the man to seize his left shoulder and right hip. He jerked hard, twisting the man’s body sharply.  And the Winchesters were right there with him, fists flying as they battled their way towards us.  Except for Lucifer’s Angel blade, he and the Winchesters had been unarmed for their day in court.  But the three of them weren’t even hesitating, diving on our attackers even before the armed security forces arrived and opened fire.
“As his bodyguard, you will be responsible for all aspects of his care, including feeding, dressing, bathing...”
Only Dean could put so much derision into the word “master” he could make it sound like an insult.  Suddenly, Dean’s bruises seemed more obvious on his face.  No.  It wouldn’t do to project anything but confidence.  Castiel straightened.  “Fortunately, the rest of the family mostly prefers to drive themselves.  So I will be your primary passenger.  Otherwise, well, we’ll work that out.”
“That’s for you and your brothers to work out.  It’s the Winchesters I want right now.  Let me get you into Cas’s section, so you can wake him back up once you’re able.  Meanwhile, I need to have a chat with those two brothers.  I’ve got some very important instructions for them.”
“Hey, I didn’t do that!  But I guess you have a point.”  He looked at Cass.  “For real, though.  You barely even know me.  I haven’t even been here for a month!  Neither one of us is the same person he was as a kid.  So why would you even consider throwing everything away for me?”
“Why?” Dean wanted to know.  “Why would you put yourself through all this shit when you don’t have to?”
“That’s right,” Luc agreed.  “You live here now.  If you’re hungry, eat.  All I ask is that you don’t eat within an hour of a regular meal.”  His smile widened.  “Although with your appetite, I don’t think that’s a problem.”
Naomi didn’t seem surprised.  From what Dean could gather, the camps were nearly finished with whatever they were doing.  Some sort of land revitalization.  Made sense.  When the environment went to shit and the rain and air turned toxic, the earth had been doused with poisons.  From what Dean understood, the labor camps turned the earth, running it through machines that cleaned it of toxins in hopes that it could one day grow green again.  Dean was surprised to learn that Naomi’s efforts, combined with the massive towers that worked to purify the air, were actually having an effect.
Something grew warm in Dean’s chest.  He drew Cass’s hand up, held it against his chest.  “How about you worry about you first?” he suggested, smiling.  “I think, at this point, you’re the one in the most trouble.”
“Climb into the back and get down into the footwell,” Cass ordered.  “I’ll throw the tarp over you.  We’ll go through a drive-through and get food.  Then we’ll find a place to spend the night.”
And suddenly, Sammy was on the screen.  He looked young, cornered, and terrified.  The green eyes he shared with his brother were wide, seemingly lost in the flashing cameras as microphones were held in his face.  “Dean isn’t dangerous,” Sammy insisted, barely hiding a tremor in his voice.  “He was just desperate.  Our dad is sick, and we didn’t have any more food in the house.  I don’t know where he got a gun.  But Dean would never hurt anyone, no matter what people say!”
Dean focused on his buffing, remembering the rule about not talking.  It wasn’t easy.  Having two douchebags talking about you like you A) weren’t there B) couldn’t hear them and C) were an object to be owned was a hard pill to swallow.  It didn’t help one bit that the assholes were standing right next to him, looking at him like an artifact on display as they literally talked around him.
“I agree.  That’s why I turned him in.  But what he said bothered me.  About how his family was convicted for crimes they didn’t commit?  That’s something the bounty hunting community’s been hearing a lot.”
“Just watch your own ass.  Dean, sit down,” Bobby ordered, stopping Dean in the process of going towards the door.  “Rufus, take care of Castiel, and yourself.  Don’t do anything stupid.”  Hanging up, Bobby pointed Dean onto the sofa.  Then he went to the door.
The cork came out easily.  Dean quickly pointed the bottle away from himself, expecting a full-sized angel to come boiling out.  The eye he’d seen as a child had certainly been regular sized. But nothing happened.  “Um, can you put the bottle down?” a tiny voice called from the opened mouth of the bottle.  “It’s going to be a tight fit.”
Castiel nodded.  “We started to wonder then if it wasn’t just a clerical error that caused us to be dropped into the wrong place.  Maybe whoever had just ratted us out had expected us to do a forced march back to our landing zone and walk right into an ambush?  But we were always super careful, especially when anything went wrong.  It’s part of what made us so successful.  By the time we’d arrived, we were two hours behind schedule.  We think they got impatient.  But now there was nothing to do but abort the mission.”
“Actually, based on what I was just told, I’ll be taking both of your laborers,” Crowley corrected.  “I know some gents who, shall we say, specialize in problem laborers?  They should be able to correct the disturbing behavioral issues I’m seeing here.  After all, I’d hate to be accused of not doing my job, right?”
“This just keeps getting juicer and juicier.  What happened?  He bent your halo, stole your harp?  Ooo, was there a lady angel involved?  She decided to go cloud seeding with this other guy, so you had to clip his wings, so to speak?”
“That’s why!” Dean exclaimed.  “Because you’re all willing to believe something that isn’t true about someone you used to call your brother!  You’ve been influenced, and I knew I’d never be able to convince you, and it was a matter of time before I ended up in the same boat. I had to get you safe!  Listen, I know you don’t believe me right now, but all seven of you are in terrible danger!”
Apparently finished, Dean gave Castiel’s hand a gentle squeeze before sitting back and returning to his breakfast.
“Don’t worry about me.  In fact, when you do get in contact with them?  Tell them to stay away from me.”
Dean looked down, realized he was completely naked, and flushed to the roots of his hair.  “If you two don’t drop that cell phone and get the hell out of here...?”
“I spent the bulk of last night checking for spells, wards, anything you might have done to have triggered this reaction,” Castiel went on.  “But I found nothing.  It wasn’t until I went to you and watched over you as you slept that I realized what it was.  ‘Creepy’ as you found that, it did serve a purpose.”
“Here’s the thing.  Dean trusts you.  I love that boy like my son, but he’s been gone for weeks now.  That does things to your head.  So until I’m sure he knows what he really wants?  You’re staying right here.”
Dean’s smile widened, and for the first time, Castiel felt himself relax. He tried the potato strips, savored them.  Maybe, he dared to think, just maybe, his new bodyguard would work out after all?
Angelo slowed to allow them to catch up.  “It’s coming from the front,” he reported.  “They must have hit us there, anticipating we’d try to leave in the motorcade car.  The transport is ready, Senator.  If we leave from behind the house we should be able to get away.”
“Sorry.”  Cass was busy looking around.  His hands were tucked into his trench coat and his face bore an uncomfortable expression.
The eyes moved back to the road.  Fortunately, the light had turned green.  The man hit the gas and the car shot forward.  Dean found himself thrown back against the seat.  Then a hard right turn nearly had him in the man’s lap.  The driver didn’t spare Dean a second glance, maneuvering through traffic at breakneck speed, cutting off other cars and nearly forcing one off the road.  “Shit!” Dean exclaimed.  “You’re going to get us killed!”
Footsteps sounded in the hall, moving towards Dean’s door.  Dean tensed.  The hand in the cuff tightened into a fist, while the other clutched at the side of the bed.  Cass was coming back.  What would happen now?  His heart pounded.  Something was squeaking in the hall, coming to a halt just outside Dean’s door.  Then came a knock, and a questioning blue eye peeking in.  “Dean?”
Whatever the reason, it couldn’t have been good. Dean prayed Sam was safe. That’s all he could do. He’d never felt so helpless.
How many sick ways did that demoness torture him before Cas got there? If he still had his power, he would have super-heated the succubus's molecules until she exploded in light.
Dean’s mouth moved in the shape of a weak laugh—a common and sarcastic, ‘no shit’ laugh that had once hurt Cas but now felt so normal it was almost a relief.
Doc’s voice matched. “Then you’re the luckiest sons of bitches I ever met. Now, how did you clean the wound? How did you stop the bleeding?”
Then he heard screaming. It wasn’t far away, and it definitely wasn’t female. In fact, it sounded like Dean. But he was right here. It seemed he heard the screaming too. His head whirled toward the door, and he stood sharply.
If his body was a Christmas tree, the lacerations of various depths spiraled around his torso and limbs were like oozing, bloody ornaments. And that was the kind of random thought Dean only had while drunk or faint. He was stone cold sober. That meant he needed to eat something.
Then there was a squeak that didn’t come from either of them, and Cas opened his eyes to see a red-headed woman standing in the doorway with her mouth agape and a scarlet blush on her cheeks. The world crashed back into focus, bringing all the negative back with it, and Cas froze so hard Dean realized something was wrong.
"Play with me," she repeated. "Or I'm going to play with your pet over there." Her smile was toxic and gorgeous. If he'd seen this chick at a bar and she'd flashed him that smile, he would have been at her side in an instant, and they'd have been in the backseat of Baby not long after that. But this fake sexual arousal, this magic-induced want, it was poison eating at his veins, and he fought it with everything he had. Because he may have wanted her more than anything he'd ever wanted in his life, but he was stubborn, dammit, and she was a freakin' demon.
Maybe the loss of his voice was for the best. What would Dean say, anyway? That Cas shouldn’t have come to rescue him? That Dean should never have left in the first place? They both knew it. Talking about it wouldn’t change anything. Maybe what was broken couldn’t be fixed.
Doc nudged his way into the kitchen past Miss Rose and looked between the two men a few times before declaring them both fevered and prescribing ice baths.
Castiel’s voice took on a vacant husk, a tone Dean knew well and despised for its lack of humanity. Castiel never sounded more like his old self than when speaking of things like this—of confessions that should be emotional but seemed like nothing more than a comment on the weather.
It was a familiar voice, but entirely out of place here. Dean had to be imagining it. Or he'd died and gone to some weird version of hell.
The man’s hand reached up to the table and circled Cas’s arm. His fingers were cold and his grip weak as he squeezed.
Dean’s eyes slipped out of focus, and he saw past the doctor as he worked. The house wasn’t just old-fashioned, it was old. Like, really old. Like, wood-burning stove, iron kettle, no appliances in the kitchen old. No electrical outlets. Dean spun his head to the right. Zero modern furnishings. Not even retro or vintage. There were tintype photographs on the wall. No television.
He trudged away down the hill. Sam asked another man. And then another. And another. They all greeted him with suspicion and curtness, offering no help before marching wherever they might be headed for rest. Then he saw a younger man, someone with lightness still in his step. Sam approached, and the young man looked at him with a tilted head.
Cas looked at his shoulder, thinking that if he could see it, he could bear it easier. He was wrong.
Charlie laughed a high-pitched bark. “You’re jokin’ ain’t ya? Here I thought you had no sense of humor.”
Dean let out a sigh, and his breath clouded around him. Then he heard the sound of Cas’s voice coming from the window above him, and his heart raced with a mix of fear and something indefinable—a feeling between longing and anxiety. He sat on the cold ground, his bare back pressed against the splintering wood, and listened.
Cas had always been instructed to shut up and let Dean do the talking. Being an angel who spent most of his time in heaven had made Castiel seem as foreign to most humans as they had once seemed to him. But heaven was far behind (above?) him, and even though Cas understood many more human references than he had in the past, he knew most humans still found him off-putting. And more than that, he had come to prefer Dean speaking for him.
Jamie smoothed his hair down. “Well, yes. I came to tell the gentlemen,” at this, he gestured to Cas then Dean, “that when they get to feelin’ better, the mine’s in desperate need of workers. Mr. Carson’s near workin’ everyone to death. We could use more men to help split the shifts. Ease the burden of makin’ quota.” A long silence followed.
"You done screaming now?" he asked. Cas blinked the tears from his vision and saw Dean sitting back on his heels, wiping sweat from his brow. Fresh, red blood coated both hands, and he wiped them on his jeans. Cas nodded. Dean stretched out a hand and removed the fabric from Cas's mouth. It would be a while before Cas could speak, he thought, but he tried to meet Dean's eyes. He had to apologize somehow.
Cas shook his head. “That’s not it. Dean is selfless. If it had been anyone else, he’d have reacted the same.”
is you, at least. It’s like you hung the moon. No wonder he put up with what I did to him. He worships you.”
She and the doctor were in conference in the kitchen, their voices too low to be heard—at least from where Dean sat in the living room. He was wrapped in quilts and seated in a wooden chair while Cas lay stretched out on the wooden bench across the room. What the doctor had against cushions, Dean couldn’t guess, but not a surface in the man’s home was comfortable. Not a surface except Cas’s lips, of course. And his body. His warmth.
Sweat poured down Dean's body in buckets. The direct-to-brainwaves televised special of "Demented Succubus Attacking Defenseless Angel" had turned off with a blast of darkness moments ago. He didn't know if it was because he had screamed or something else, but Dean knew he had to get free of the ropes: NOW.
The demoness arched an eyebrow. "More threats, I assume?" She brought a hand up to her head and hissed. The handle of the knife embedded in her temple trembled. Dean hoped that she was in pain.
The older man studied Sam from the corner of his eyes—startlingly blue amidst all the black coal on the man’s face.
Cas and Dean inch toward death in their separate torture chambers, but not without first fighting with everything they have. And there might be a few tricks left up some sleeves around here.
The air seemed thin. Cas felt the walls waver around him, and his vision blurred. Hunters had existed as long as monsters, so the idea that the old doctor could be one, himself, wasn’t too hard to believe. And maybe Doc Emmerson could help them if Cas told him the truth.
Castiel pulled the quilt tight around his shoulders as he summoned details to the front of his mind. The air seemed to drop in temperature as the small room shrank smaller still.
Then the doctor kicked the door closed and said, “Well, gentlemen. Now you’re both awake, let’s talk.”
“I’m Jamie,” said the youngest of the strangers, the one with the blue eyes and the soothing voice. “That’s Charlie.”
he called out as hard as he could. This made his throat raw, but it still didn’t make any noise. The forest rustled around him. Leaves crunched beneath him as he shifted to get to his feet, and he heard all of that, so his ears worked fine. He swayed—a lot—and lost his vision for a few seconds, but remained on his feet. His heaving breaths made noise. So why not his voice?
Strategizing never came easily to Dean. His brother would always take care of the how and when, and Dean would charge ahead, guns blazing. He might get thrown against the wall right away, but he and Sammy and the rest of the good guys always ended up on top.
Though Dean was certain the woman had seen them going at each other, she hadn’t spoken about it. The doctor hadn’t seen the kiss and didn’t seem suspicious of their flushed faces or breathlessness, and as long as the red-headed woman didn’t share what she’d seen, Cas and Dean should be safe from scrutiny and the law. As for whether or not she would keep it a secret forever, there was no way to tell. Knowing women, Dean suspected she was holding the information close to wield it like a weapon or bargaining tool against them later.
“split me: open: split me: open: split me: open,” and fuck if Dean didn’t want to do that more than anything. And the most mind-blowing part of it all was that Cas wanted it, too.
Cas nodded, panting. Dean ripped open Cas’s shirt, sending buttons skidding along the dirt floor. When calloused, heavy hands landed on the frayed edges of Castiel’s shirt, bracing themselves against his chest, Cas gasped out, “Wait.”
The succubus replied by dragging Cas up the wall to a seated position, a movement which seemed to cause the angel great pain, which he attempted to hide. Then she gave a bullshit but a plausible reason for them both to take their clothes off.
After a few knocks on an old wooden door, it flew open, and a white-haired man stood on the stoop, gazing out.
Dean had acted like he had some escape and travel plan, but then he'd gone off again. By the time Dean returned next time, Cas might be dead. Maybe that was the only way Dean would have a chance of making it to safety. And really, that was all Cas wanted anymore. Just Dean safe from harm. It was his final prayer and wish.
She shrieked again, and Sam picked up his pace, though he was running out of energy reserves. The unholy scream seemed to come from all around, as if played through loud speakers. Hell, maybe the she-demon had shed her human-like guise and was all around them, now.
Cas and Dean were in this together. Torture, mind-games, being forced back in time—the two of them were all each other had. But the distance between them had never felt so vast or impassable. Still, Dean had to try. This was a battle he could fight, and he would not let the chasm between himself and Cas grow bigger. Not while he still had a chance of making things better—or at least more tolerable.
Dean’s hands clenched. But then Miss Rose entered the room, and Jamie’s face turned pink beneath the coal dust. He removed his hat to clutch it to his chest, and Dean scolded himself for his misplaced jealousy.
The young stranger came to kneel beside Cas’s bed. Or was it a bench? It was quite uncomfortable and rather cramped.
Dean is forced to watch as the succubus masquerades as him and further torments the unsuspecting Castiel.
“I hurt him,” he said to no one. “Again. Always. I’m always hurting him.” Tears stung the back of his eyelids.
The doctor didn’t blink or hesitate before replying, “That much is obvious, son. What’s not clear are the details. And the why.”
Dean’s touch lifted from Cas’s arm as the hunter placed both palms on the table beside Cas to hoist himself up to his feet. He looked exhausted and pale, yes, but more frightening than that was the expression that made Dean’s face almost unrecognizable. Cas couldn’t remember ever seeing the man look so… broken.
Dean put a bundle of fabric in Cas’s mouth, then he gripped the fronts of his dress shirt and peeled it down from both shoulders.
Dean's brain screamed for oxygen. The world was turning red, and his lips tingled. Pressure behind his eyes threatened to pop them out of his skull. He fumbled for the hidden knife.
Doc Emmerson chuckled. Cas staggered toward the door, feeling his legs waver beneath him and his torso topple under its own weight. He stopped and leaned against the wall when the doctor called out.
Cas hooked his thumb deep into the exposed meat of Dean’s leg and squeezed. The hunter came to with a silent roar of pain and sat bolt upright.
“Cas needs her,” Doc clarified. “Again, I don’t know what the hell you boys went through, but it wasn’t a human woman who did this—“
The succubus, trussed up and stacked like a porn star, wore a hot librarian get up. She was ruining one of Dean's favorite kinks as well as his face and Cas's trench coat. The bitch would die screaming. She laughed low in her throat, tittering and chirping like a sexy bird.
Cas drank deeply, and though he didn’t believe he could get drunk, his body did respond to the burn by unwinding some tension. He took an even breath. Then he set his eyes on Dean, who seemed to be well and truly unconscious.
“Dean,” Cas tried, his mouth dry and his voice broken. He stroked Dean’s head. “It’s okay. You’ll be okay.”
“That's bull, and you know it!” he shouted. “You’ll bleed out, or the succubus will find and torture you before killing you. I won’t have your death on my conscience. I refuse.”
Doc Emmerson stared at the closed front door a moment before pulling up a chair and seating himself across from Castiel.
Things went foggy. There were sounds of footsteps overhead and below him. A cold shiver made his muscles clench and pulled at the fresh stitches. Dean hissed. Someone placed another blanket over the first, weighing him down. He grew aware of hushed conversation, mostly between Doc and the kid.
But he wouldn't give in. He wouldn't get hard, not when the succubus kissed him and he felt it through his whole body. Not when she ground her shapely hips on his lap. Not even when she found that spot behind his ear that always made him drip pre-cum when it was kissed, even without the use of her sex magic making everything ten thousand times more powerful. Her voice was like silk as it wafted over him.
Dean’s world view shifted almost on a daily basis, but the revelation that Cas wanted him shocked the hunter more than when he first realized angels were real. And because it seemed so impossible, Dean had to keep reminding himself their kiss wasn’t a fantasy. So he focused on the pressure, the taste, the shared longing that remained and let it give him the first hope he’d had in days, if not years.
A chill traveled his body, which he knew was somewhere beneath him, though he couldn’t see it and barely felt anything besides an all-encompassing dread.
Castiel thought that was more than likely, but he didn’t say so because he wanted as much time between him and the extraction of the fabric wedged inside his body as possible. So he shook his head.
Dean's throat grew tight with panic, and he struggled even harder against his bonds. Cas was in bad shape. Real bad. That waxy-eyed, pale-faced expression on his handsome—no, stupid—face belied a chasm of nothingness underneath. It was the look of a man moments from death. His gaze had slipped down to fake Dean's mouth and broadcast a willingness to be kissed, but the look behind all of that said, "I'm gone, and I know it. This is goodbye."
Doc Emmerson stood and poured a glass of water. He looked over his shoulder at the ex-angel to ask. “Animals?”
The doctor was red around the collar, and his tone bordered on scornful. Dean shook his head but the old man didn’t see, his unblinking gaze stuck to the wall.
“Last time I saw wounds as grave as yours, I was in a war zone.” He crossed his arms over his thin chest, his shirtsleeves rolled up past his elbows, and gazed at Castiel. “This wasn’t simple highway robbery. What happened?”
The older man helped Dean to his feet. After a slight stumble, Dean was alright. The younger man lifted Cas from the ground. The angel didn’t stir.
Well, he was Dean Winchester. If there were something to fight, he’d fight. If there were something to accomplish, he’d find a way to get it done no matter how impossible the task seemed. But right now, the only thing he could think of doing was to get himself to shelter.
"I have to see about finding us some water." His voice cracked as if to indicate just how much he needed it. Cas's mouth was drier than it had ever been before, and his head pounded from the base of his skull. Yes, they both needed water if they were to have a chance of getting out of here. But Dean couldn't leave this shack without knowing about the demoness. So Cas swallowed and tried to speak.
Cas felt his mouth part, but the words were a jumbled mess in his mind, and on top of all of the confusion was fear for Dean. Why didn’t the man’s voice work? Was he in shock, or had the she demon done something unspeakable, like remove his vocal cords? Would it be fixable, or was Dean—smart ass, mouthy, deals-with-pain-by-cracking-jokes Dean—going to be stuck without a voice forever?
The demoness was almost within stabbing distance. Just a few more feet and Dean could reach her leg with the blade. She would buckle to the ground, and he could stab up into her brain from below her jaw.
“A few men in town were found murdered and mutilated. Dean traced it back to the woman. He thought he could stop her himself.”
"I thought you were smarter than that. I really did," Dean groused. Then he added in a voice laden with disappointment, "What were you thinking?"
Castiel’s own torture at the hands of the she-demon was unimportant and relatively standard. He’d been starved of food and water, but he had a much higher tolerance for such things and slower metabolism than most mortals, so it didn’t affect him as badly as it would have a regular mortal. It was the same with the sleep deprivation. And pain was just pain.
Cas looked pale and confused. It seemed he wanted to turn and look at Dean but stopped himself and stared at Doc Emmerson instead.
Dean whispered in his own voice from his own body, “I’d never treat you like that, Cas.” But a guilty part of him knew that he had been cruel in the past, too. It hurt to see his friend behaving as if anything that demon did as Dean was normal. But it killed him to think that his own words and actions had made it seem real enough to Cas that he didn’t even question her cruelty.
Jimmy Novak had been a man, which made Castiel a man. He had the same parts, and sometimes he had the urges, but only when it came to Dean. He knew the oldest Winchester would be sickened if he knew of Cas's longing for him, so Cas kept his secret buried.
“Damn near bled out from all these knife wounds.” The other man sounded queasy. He swallowed so thickly that Castiel heard it from the ground. “Robbery?”
That ass clown Gabriel had shifted him through space and put him in some kind of forest—alone—presumably far away from fighting, far from Sam, and far from Castiel.
Both men laughed. Dean snuck into the tree line and hid himself in the dark shadows. He could see the others, now. Two men, both in good shape, average height, wearing grimy work clothes. On the ground between them lay a third man, unmoving. He faced away, but the shape of his shoulders, the curve of his waist, the way his hair lay on the back of his head—Dean knew without question that huddled, half-naked heap of man was Castiel.
Dean flicked Cas’s kneecap in an apparent show of irritation. Of course, the man would not appreciate being talked about. He wasn’t an invalid—he was sitting inches away.
Probably not here. Perhaps in need of help with no one being aware of the need to rescue him. Besides Dean, the succubus was the only one who knew she had Castiel trapped. Would Sam and Gabe kill her before finding out? Or worse, would she kill all of them while Dean was stuck here?
It was like a prayer and yet less focused, the sound softer than a whisper, but so needful it was as if the speaker was reaching out to Cas while falling backward off a cliff. It pulled him out of his pain and gave him a sense of urgency.
That was a good idea. And maybe it would be easier to figure out what to say to Cas if Dean could write it all down. He imagined what his opening lines might be.
Dean nodded and gave a disapproving—probably harsh and judgmental look—at the way the young man was carrying Cas. He mimed
Cas stood on shaky legs and brought Dean with him, at least as much as he could. Jamie helped support the other man’s weight, and together they shuffled inside.
When the darkness snuck in this time, he dove inside and prayed that when he woke—if he woke—this would have been nothing more than a fever dream.
So Dean focused on the feeling of his heart pounding in his chest. It helped connect him to his own body back in the basement. He had to remember that he wasn’t really there with Cas. He was still chained and bound to a chair in some basement, and he couldn’t let this new torture distract him from his goal. He had to break his thumb and get out, especially because right now would be a perfect time. The bitch wasn’t there, and thanks to her eyes in his head, he could see where she was and what she was doing. Dean knew he was safe for the moment, so he had to take his chance.
She tilted her head and smiled. Her body transformed, hazy at first, like a mirage, and finally all at once. Her clothes were the same, but her hair had turned from red and curly to straight and black. Eyes that had been big and blue moments before were now deep brown and almond-shaped. She looked like one of the Busty Asian Beauty girls.
Sunlight broke through gaps between wooden wall planks. Gardening tools hung along shelves and lay on the ground. Cas saw a lawnmower, a chainsaw, a radio, and nothing else of import. Except for Dean.
It worked. Dean blacked out for a few seconds, just long enough for the demoness to take a step closer to Sam, but Dean's leg was free, and the knife was in his hand. His brother still held the angel blade pointed at the woman, but he wasn't attacking. He wasn't rushing in to take her clothes off, either, so there was still hope. Dean knew that, mentally, Sam was fighting her influence. If Dean could help shake his brother out of her trance, the two of them could take the bitch down.
The world flipped inside out. Sam went tumbling, free-falling, into nothingness. He lost his body, his mind shouted out in terror, and blackness gave way to every color in the universe until exploding into pure white.
“Dean cares about others more than himself. She tortured him for days, starved him of food and water, sliced his skin to ribbons. He would have died before giving in. But with me, she was able to… to gain leverage.”
Or he was kidding himself. Just the thought of that made his head spin. He raised a hand to get Cas’s attention. The angel’s eyes locked on his. Dean’s empty stomach flipped.
“My day keeps getting better,” she announced and closed the door. She never locked it when she was inside. “How’s yours?” she asked as if she was a housewife from the sixties and Dean had just come home from work.
“I do know that these woods are freakin’ dense. It’s humid and buggy and desolate out there. I must have hiked for a mile before finding this guy.” He held up the water bottle. “Then I tripped over the world’s smallest creek. There wasn’t much to it, but the water wasn’t stagnant so it should be okay to drink. But I have a bad feeling about the succubus. Like she's close. Or toying with us from afar.”
A lascivious shudder raced down Dean’s body and made him lightheaded. After years of suppressing his desires, of ignoring his heart and needs because of his fear—of many things but most of all of alienating Cas—the angel wanted him, too.
“You were calling for me,” Cas said. His voice was raw from screaming, and his chest ached from how hard it was to speak. With the fresh blood loss, Cas was the weakest he’d been in days.
“Set him here, please,” the doctor instructed. Dean laid Castiel down atop a layer of what looked like hand-sewn quilts across a wooden bench. Cas looked pale and stretched and bruised and skewered. Dean took hold of the angel’s right hand in his left and squeezed as he knelt by the edge of the bench.
"Shut it, babe," growled the demoness as she came forward. "We are done flirting, you and I. My sights are higher, now."
Dean forced a smile to his face, despite the icy fingers that traced his spine.  “Yeah, I heard.  Thank you, so much, for everything.”
“Don’t worry, I won’t go back to childhood, not really.  I was a bit of a wild child, out drinking and partying most every night once I left home.  I was looking for love in all the wrong places, as they say.  I spent my twenties searching, and was still looking in my thirties.  By then, I was looking for the wrong kind of love.  Got pregnant with Joanna Beth as a result.  Her daddy didn’t want fuck all to do with either one of us, so I went looking again, this time for a stable father figure for her.  Thought I found a good one.  We didn’t have much, but he had a steady job.  I thought I was in love with him.  It wasn’t until we were married and I was all moved in with Jo that he started to show his true colors.”
“Baby is registered to Jeff, not to me,” Cass explained.  “When I was listed as Killed In Action, all my assets went to Amelia as my wife.  She sold almost everything, but apparently gave Baby to Jeff.  His name is on the papers.  So anyone who looked up the plate would have seen his name, not mine.  It would take time for the title to revert back to me, as the army lawyers just started in on all that.  So right now, the only vehicle that might still be registered to me is the old truck I left on base before I was deployed.  I didn’t drive it because the battery was dead and I thought I was going home to my wife.  Apparently, Amelia either didn’t get around to selling it or forgot about it.  But that’s the vehicle someone trying to find me would be looking for.  As for Baby being at the cabin?  Jeff was a friend of mine, part of our group that owned the cabin.  It wouldn’t be a stretch to assume that he was storing her there.”  He shook his head.  “If you hadn’t been so worried about scratches, Dean, we might have been caught.  The fact she was covered may have just saved us.”
Dean nodded. Focusing on the doctor’s angry rant had made the succubus disappear. He clung to the old man’s every word and expression, afraid of drifting back to the basement in his mind again.
Rough hands stripped Cas of what remained of his shredded trench coat. Cas screwed his eyes and mouth shut so as not to make noise. He fought so hard to stay quiet that he barely breathed. When Dean muscled him free from his suit jacket, Cas greyed out, losing sight and time for a few heartbeats. Dean smacked his cheek.
The demoness' laughter cut short. She stared down at Dean, unblinking. A slender handle from the file blade stuck out of the side of her temple. Blood dripped down the edge of her face.
“Huh,” said the older man with a pleased smile. “That looks a helluva lot easier than how we was tryin’ to hold him.”
Dean? Part of him hoped so because that shit would never work, and then it would be her turn to be on the losing end. As long as Dean had known Cas, he’d never seen the guy display any inclination toward sexual anything. And he absolutely, beyond any doubt, had zero physical desires toward Dean. That was a solid fact.
Once, he had freed Dean's soul from the pit of hell. He had carved Enochian onto the brothers' ribs to keep them safe. But without his grace, he was worse than useless. He was a liability.
He wanted to tell her to go to hell, that he was going to cut off her head, that he would end her—but she wasn’t real and he didn’t have the heart to yell at monsters in his brain. Now that he and Cas were out of danger, Dean found he couldn’t rally. There was no fight left in him. He’d never been broken before. Not even in hell. Not like this. This was… this was…
“—Sorry.” The youth shrugged his shoulders. “But you’re the first stranger I’ve seen come through this town. Ever.” The young man picked up his steady march downhill and tossed, “Good luck,” over his shoulder.
Doc sounded sorry but firm. “Then he’ll be used to it. We have to get this done. I shouldn’t have waited long as I did. Didn’t realize it was this bad. Your friend’s got a hell of a stubborn streak and must be real good at hidin’ pain.”
“Something heroic and stupid.” Gabriel sealed the vial and shoved it into Sam’s hands. “Don’t lose it,” he commanded, breath ragged. Sam had seen angels bleed before, but couldn’t remember ever seeing one sweat. Gabriel looked like a human who’d run a hundred miles. He reached out to Sam, and the hunter helped the angel remain standing.
Dean glanced at Doc to gauge whether that was bad or very bad news. The inner corner of the doctor’s left eye twitched. His mouth seemed too tight to form words, but he hummed and annoyed ‘continue’ sound.
Dean’s lips were on his, taking the words from his mouth and replacing them with heat and desire and need. Cas’s spine arched as Dean’s rounded forward, and they were touching from noses to chests. There was no room for pain or shame in the face of such bliss, and Cas had to wonder if this was real. Then Dean’s hand found its way to Castiel’s thigh and squeezed a helpless noise out of the back of his throat that made the ex-angel blush and Dean kiss him harder. It was one of the most real things he’d ever experienced.
Dean stared at the real-life Cas, (who looked concerned and afraid), and tried to scrub the nightmare vision from his brain. That horror was in the past. Cas had survived. They had to move forward, now. It was time to fix Cas, and Dean couldn’t afford to lose his mind.
The doctor was there, then, gently wiping dried blood from Castiel’s worst injuries. Dean looked up to get a feel for how bad the doc thought things looked, but the man kept a tight grip on his reactions behind a clenched jaw and focused eyes.
He huddled down and brought his arms and legs close for warmth, but shuddered anyway. Dean hated needles. Knives were fine, but needles? Why the hell were they so small and pointy? A good blade meant business, and you could see its intention from any angle. But a needle? It was sneaky. More versatile. Needles were like women.
Cas clenched and unclenched his left fist, hoping it would bring some feeling back. He would need to hold the water bottle to drink from it. He spoke around the dryness in his mouth and throat.
Unwanted, his mind recalled the first glimpse of the basement; Dean with his head rolled back, his mouth slack, pants undone. The succubus straddling Dean’s lap with a knife in her hand. Her rolling laughter as she dragged the blade down Dean’s erection, drawing blood.
“Shit,” Dean swore and dove for the bottle. He snatched it up and took several healthy gulps from it as if to reassure himself that there was still some inside. There wouldn’t be if he didn’t slow down, though. It was becoming strange that Dean hadn’t tried to share. It was also strange that he hadn’t untied Cas yet. The hunter leaned against the shelf along the wall and set the water bottle by his side.
“Holy shit,” she breathed. Then she opened her mouth and pressed it to the curve of his cock, moaning against him. Dean choked. He said he wouldn’t get hard, but fuck, that felt amazing! She licked his jeans with more pressure, paying particular attention to the wet spot.
Cas and Dean had both been stripped down to their final stitch of clothing: boxers for Dean and boxer-briefs for Cas. The men of this era wore long underwear beneath their clothes, so such flimsy and scant undergarments would seem foreign to them.
It didn't hurt. Not really. It felt like someone had punched him hard in the leg, and Dean wondered if he was wrong about what he thought happened. But when he raised his head and looked down his body, he saw that the knife went straight through his flesh and into the floor. When he attempted to move, agony lanced through his shredded muscles.
Despite trying to focus on the miracle that somehow he’d been communicating to Cas telepathically, his senses were being overpowered by the stench of vomit and blood, by stabbing pain and fear for his friend, and even that wonderful news couldn’t keep him from reeling back to the basement and to torture. The walls of the old man’s house faded into dark brick lit by dim bulbs. Dean shook his head.
Cas had finally, mercifully passed out, and Dean wished he could join him there in the nothingness. He longed to scrub the last several minutes from his brain so the animalistic sounds of Cas in agony would no longer torture him. But he couldn’t because one of them had to be strong, and right now it was Dean’s turn. So he breathed, blinked hard, and stayed conscious.
The growl came again, this time sounding more like a curse, and Dean pulled himself to his feet. He limped to the front door, and Cas realized with a bolt of dread that Dean was leaving. He almost called out, “Please don’t go,” but refrained and said instead, “Will you be back?”
Dean nodded. The thought of a doctor and medicine gave him another push of energy. He would crash hard—monstrously hard—when they had made it to safety, but hopefully not before then.
To his surprise, the doctor sat beside him on the bench. After removing his spectacles, he rubbed his eyes and sighed.
Castiel had grown used to ignoring the chasm of nothingness. Turning a blind eye to his defect had allowed him to endure life as a mortal, and time had given the gift of dulling the ache. But this raw agony felt as sharp as it had during the moment of separation from his power.
Miss Rose held up her hand. She glanced at Cas before saying, “I believe something about me makes the men uncomfortable. Is that a correct assessment, Mr. Cas?”
Some mysterious energy boost may have tugged him back from death’s door, but Cas didn’t have much blood left to lose.
The pleasure was exquisite—almost terrifyingly so. How could Dean ever come back from this? With worshipful attention, Castiel was ruining him forever and for everyone else. No one in all his years had ever given Dean a blow job on this scale. When Cas moved his head back to circle his tongue over the swollen tip, Dean’s knees buckled. Castiel bobbed forward and moaned, sending vibrations through Dean’s cock.
Dean stood. Cas saw his long legs stride around the room, but he didn't look above the man's knees, afraid of angering him further and losing him forever.
Dean had withdrawn behind a barrier, refusing to allow Cas to glimpse his soul like he usually could. It wasn't the first time Cas had received this look, this complete lack of connection. But Cas was tired and hurt, and he knew he'd made a mistake. The guilt coupled with the feeling of being alone made him wish he'd never let Dean run off on this hunting trip in the first place. He should have done more to calm Dean down before he left alone and angry. But he let Dean go, allowed Sam to convince him that Dean probably wasn't even going hunting but getting his dick wet instead, whatever that meant. Against all his instincts, Cas let Dean leave. Then he heard a tiny prayer and raced in after him without a plan or backup or power. He had almost gotten them both killed.
“Told you not to move,” said the elderly man perched above the angel. “You’ll hurt yourself worse. And your friend isn’t going anywhere.”
Before Dean had passed out moments ago, and his eyes met Castiel’s, the ex-angel had wanted to cry with relief. Words had sprung to his mouth—words like, “I’m so glad you’re here; I thought I’d lost you; I don’t know how I’d live without you.” But Cas had shut them down and averted his eyes like Dean had asked.
Cas looked downward then, toward his feet. His heart hammered in his chest, reminding him of every wound along his body that still leaked blood. He was making himself bleed out faster. If he lost consciousness, that would mean Dean would have to carry him to safety. They'd be caught.
“There, there,” cooed the old man. “Just a couple more sips of the ole relaxer. Atta boy. Nothin’ to worry about now.”
“I see.” The doctor’s voice was deep. His searing gaze burned Dean’s skin. “And did he make a sling for your arm?”
Dean became like a stone in his shock and fear. He couldn’t function beyond breathing as he waited for Cas’s response to the insane demand.
The hunter’s eyes closed. His jaw clenched, his brow furrowed in concentration, and Cas listened hard but heard nothing. Dean opened his eyes and gave Cas a pleading look.
But his head? That was a complete disaster area. Dean could admit to that. No shrink would know what to do with him, and he’d never open himself up enough to confess his feelings. But as soon as Cas had stumbled in to rescue Dean, the demoness had realized that most of Dean’s fears, hopes, and desires led straight back to Cas. And since that moment, she had been flaying and stripping each nerve raw.
If it hadn't been used to gouge crescent moons deep into his thighs, he might have loved this knife. The handle fit his grip as if it were custom-designed to do so. It was heavy for a smaller blade and shone as if polished, which was strange as his blood should have been all over the thing.
“It’s Jamie,” answered the young man as he shut the door. He smiled down at the sight of Castiel on the bench and exclaimed, “You’re lookin’ plum good there, Cas!”
Cas choked and brought his left hand up to his face. Dean longed to hold those trembling fingers again.
That alarm in Dean’s mind pitched even higher. His pulse pounded so hard, the pain of it surged through his stitches and the swollen, recently re-set bones in his left hand. Cas must have noticed Dean’s heightened mood right away. The angel met his gaze and nodded as if to reassure Dean it would all be okay. Dean wished that would help him feel better but it didn’t. He wouldn’t find any rest, not while that red-headed woman was under the same roof. She wasn’t to be trusted, and that much was certain. All that remained to be seen was the level of threat she posed.
Bits of conversation reached Sam across the open expanse from the mouths of men on their way from the mine. Mumbled exchanges of “Later, Walt.” “Rest up, now.” or, “Hi to the missus,” but nothing more reached Sam’s ears.
Dean kicked the leaves and went tumbling backward. He struck his head on a tree root, and the impact brought tears to his eyes. But it was frustrated despair that kept them there.
But there were still the weapons in his boots. If the demoness kept her attention on his face, he might be able to shift enough to grab another knife. Then he could stab her in the head.
Doc exhaled slowly and said, “Jamie, bring a blanket.” Cas stayed where he was, both hands planted on the edge of the table. Jamie left the room. Doc turned back to the counter to clean off his bloody needle and stash the other supplies. Dean cried silent tears behind his arm.
“Christ almighty,” Doc swore. “I knew it was a miracle you both survived, but now I’m wondering if you ain’t angels or demons yourselves.”
Cas closed his eyes. “And you saw when I—she—when we almost—when I wanted—?” The heat from Cas’s stomach climbed up his body and burned his cheeks. He took a gasped breath and blurted out. “I’m so sorry you saw.”
But Dean did not explode. When the lightning vanished from his body, he was left invigorated. The world spun as he bolted upright, ready to fight or run. It was then Dean realized how very fucked he was.
The young man with blue eyes looked over Cas’s head in concern before kneeling closer to reply, “You’re in Ensley, Alabama, friend. Looks like you been robbed and stabbed. Did you have a horse?”
“Best we tie him down,” said the Doc as he retrieved a metal box from a cabinet by his wash basin. “He’s gonna feel the needle and wake right up thrashin’. Won’t do him any good to have me stitchin’ what don’t need stitching. Jamie, there are some towels in the bathroom what ought to do the trick. Get ‘em for me.”
Rose entered the front room. Her steps were light over the wooden floor and made almost no noise, but Dean jumped as if a bomb had gone off the moment she approached.
but the doppelganger situation was a bomb to disarm later. Right now, Dean was conscious and unattended. It was time to think.
Cas pressed down with his body. He looked at Dean and saw tears streaming from his eyes. On his lips, furious swear words formed and fell away to more silent shrieks as Doc continued to stitch him up. Dean’s fists pounded on the table. Jamie cursed.
“Sit up,” Dean insisted, already dragging Cas upright against the wall. Cas bit his lip to keep the howls of pain inside. Dean’s voice was flat as he explained, “We have to change out of these bloody clothes. She can probably smell us, and if we’re going to move, I want to give us the best chance of not ending up as succubus snacks. So strip.”
“‘Course not,” replied the huskier tone, “but you think the boss wants an honest weigh man working the line?”
“Bring that here,” instructed the white-haired man to the younger stranger. The stranger placed the tin cup in the older man’s wrinkled hand, and the cup was placed to Castiel’s lips.
With his hand and a teetering motion, Dean indicated he’d given his best guess, but it might have been a little more or less. A lot depended on the events of the Succubus-as-Dean and Castiel after they were out of his sight. But Dean felt the passing of each minute of his life as Castiel lay unmoving and bloodied on the floor of the basement, and he knew that was at least six hours.
The mirthless sound of the angel’s chuckle made Sam’s blood run cold. Suddenly his fear of the monster shifted into fear of a different kind, especially when he saw the hollowness behind the angel’s eyes. Sam’s throat felt thick. “Gabriel—”
Dean shot the man a look that caused Doc Emmerson to bark back, “I ain’t no fool and I’m sick of you treatin’ me as if I was. You boys got messed up with some banshee or warlock, it’s plain as day. Cas already told me you hunt evil so don’t go tryin’ to deny it.” Doc threw the rag onto his counter and dropped the needle into a basin. “I’ve known a hunter or two,” he said with a scowl. “And you’re all the damn same. Seen too many of you die for that fool glory you’re always chasin’.”
“You’re real clean,” observed the man, his drawl thick and deep. “And you look like you eat a cow a day.”
Cas closed his eyes. “And you saw when I—she—when we almost—when I wanted—?” The heat from Cas’s stomach climbed up his body and burned his cheeks. He took a gasped breath and blurted out. “I’m so sorry you saw.”
Castiel hated him. Of course, he would. The demoness had tortured him while wearing Dean’s face. But even before that, he had gone off alone. It was against everyone's wishes, but mostly against Castiel's, and Dean had gotten himself trapped. And because of that selfish decision, Cas had been tortured. And now Dean realized a cruel truth with mounting panic.
Castiel opened his eyes, but couldn’t see for many moments. He knew he hadn’t moved from the kitchen table—in fact, he was still tied to it—and as consciousness returned in earnest (and agony with it), Castiel longed for the escape of nothing. Then he heard his name.
"And you are going to watch." The demon crept forward. "But I'll be damned if I'll let you ruin my fun again."
“Now, talk to me, Mr. Cas. Those miners who found you are good men, but they’ve got big mouths and wild imaginations. Half the town’s gonna know about you and your friend by now, and everyone’s going to be worried about what’s lurking out there.”
Sweat made Dean’s body slick. Fever made him hot to touch. If Dean Winchester died here, a hundred years in the past and from a simple infection, Cas would never forgive himself. He would march into hell.
Dean made a wispy growl, then. The man’s lips moved, but Cas couldn’t read the words well enough. His throat tightened.
Dean took several sharp breaths, bracing himself. His grip tightened. In a few seconds, he would break his thumb. But then he heard the lock on the steel door slide back, and he stopped, his heart in his throat.
Cas stepped outside Doc’s house, but the sun was blinding. His eyes took forever to adjust, so he heard the panic before he could see it.
Dean struggled to maintain his focus as the waves of guilt kept rolling in to drown him, but then the best and worst thing that could have happened did.
Dean placed his hand on Cas’s chest, and it drew the angel up short. The touch was warm and grounding. If Cas had been upright, he would have leaned into it, but he was content to be underneath. Dean’s eyes hardened as he shook his head as if to tell Cas no. Guilt reared up and took the place of every other emotion. His expression seemed to say. “It’s my fault. Not yours.”
The succubus crossed her arms. Dean noticed the fresh blood again, and it made him seethe with rage.
Sam seemed caught off-guard. The angel blade slipped and pointed at the floor. His eyes softened and glanced down the woman's body. He furrowed his brows, confused.
The young man pounced on the lifeline with an enthusiastic, “Yes. I’m mighty glad they’re both alive. You and Miss Rose do great work. Real great.”
Her features shifted again, that same heat-off-the-pavement warp coating her body. He saw her eyes change color, flashing almost green across the dark room. Her hair shrank back toward her scalp, lightening into a tan blonde. Her skin darkened into a buttery tan. Her shoulders filled out. The woman was becoming a man. Her clothes were changing, too. Jeans. Plaid shirt. Bloodstains.
Dean heard the sound of something being shuffled around and placed on the ground, then several deep breaths.
All of this was too much. He was still too tired—that’s why he couldn’t shake this horrible feeling or the image of the succubus. He needed food and booze and a good night’s sleep and God Damnit, he needed Cas to
Now he just had to give himself an orgasm without using his hands. He thought he’d be able to if he just focused on the right thing, but all of his usual fantasies were turning him off, thanks to a certain she-demon. He tried imagining all types, shapes, and colors of women, different positions, situations, and fantasies. Everything made him think of the succubus, and she made him want to commit murder.
Doc Emmerson added, “Maybe it’s for the best. Talk of torture and all. Not much suited for young ladies.”
That painful thought was almost as distracting as the rock-hard monster crying out from his jeans, and Dean tried to shove both aside. A strange thing happened, though, when the two forces—his erection and the thought of Cas—combined. Dean didn't think he'd ever been so hard in his life.
If only his hands were free, he'd be able to jack off and come in under three strokes. Hell, if there were anything to press against, Dean would come with a few quick ruts. But there was nothing.
“Sorry, friend,” said the older man as he crouched beside Dean. “I didn’t mean nothin’ by it, I just never met someone like you before.”
The gagging sounds emanating from Castiel made Dean heady and weak-kneed. He thrust harder. Faster. Castiel’s mouth closed tightly. The heat and pressure grew painfully intense, now. Dean had to come. He couldn’t take any more.
“We need to get that wound cleared, cleaned and stitched.” Doc’s voice was firm and sharp. “Cas, you want a drink?”
Cas rasped, “I’m sorry I couldn’t rescue you,” and the guilt-ridden self-loathing that burdened his friend’s voice made Dean’s chest ache. Then Cas added a barely audible, “I tried.”
Dean chuckled, which would have surprised Cas years ago, but now he was used to the Winchester brothers laughing in the face of danger and impossible odds.
As Sam staggered uphill toward the road, he clutched the glowing vial of Gabriel’s grace and prayed they would all survive.
She laughed. It would be her downfall, because when she closed her eyes, Dean gripped the blade in his shoe, slid it free, and stabbed with all his might.
Dean groaned. His mouth watered. The thought of taking Cas from behind, gripping his hips, maneuvering his body, biting the crest of the man’s shoulder, and losing himself in the act of fucking the world’s most forbidden fruit was going to make him come in his pants. The next few seconds would have him exploding with his release. He imagined the angel crying out his name in pleasure, and that was it.
The doctor stood and looked down. “You don’t have to get into the why—but I need to know… what are your worst injuries? And Dean’s, too, if you know them?”
Dean grit his teeth and fought against the deep, overwhelming sorrow caused by the distance between himself and Cas. There had to be a way to fix it, but without use of his voice, how? And hell, even if he could talk, Dean would be just as likely to keep his feelings inside like always. He sucked at emotions.
“What was it?” asked the white-haired man. His eyes looked smaller without his spectacles to cover them. “Banshee? Werewolf?”
Cas startled as Dean’s hand lifted his chin. The angel looked across at Dean who mouthed, “What did I see?”
Cas hesitated. The words sounded bad. It was as if his request amused Dean. Maybe the depths of Castiel’s weakness did amuse him. The ex-angel nodded and kept his eyes downturned.
The demoness tilted her head and tugged on Cas’s tie, and Dean shouted at the top of his aching lungs.
He balled his left hand into a fist. Dean's right one was mangled, bloody, and swollen. It may as well be a puddle of jello for all the good it would do him. Moving on.
The ground was hard beneath a layer of fallen leaves. The air was crisp and the sky gray. With the forest at his back, Dean faced West where the last rays of a vibrant sunset painted the sky orange.
"Trying to what?" Dean snapped. His eyes fixed on Cas's shoulder. "To get us both killed? To gift wrap the upper hand and deliver it on a silver platter to that demon?"
Dean had to get out of the handcuffs. Then maybe he could get his ropes loose enough to reach for a knife on the table and get to work on the rest of his bonds. But to do that, he had to break his hand. That was the only way.
“And I hope you have,” replied Doc Emmerson. “But hope isn’t enough. Not with the way you fellas were dragged half-dead into my lap, here.” His blue-eyed gaze dropped to the floor as his voice lowered. “Last time I saw wounds as grave as yours, I was in a war zone.” He crossed his arms over his thin chest, his shirtsleeves rolled up past his elbows, and gazed at Castiel. “This wasn’t simple highway robbery. What happened?”
If there had been anything to punch, kick, or dent, Dean would have done so, but there was nothing but dirt road and sparse forest beyond the small porch. He might have screamed at the sky in rage, but his voice…
“No,” he answered. “And I have no idea where we are, either.” Dean’s blood-caked hands worked at the buttons of his shirt before he untucked it from his waistband. He withdrew a dirty water bottle from inside the fabric. It sloshed with the promise of water. Cas felt the sandpaper dryness of his tongue and ached for a taste. But Dean continued.
Dean had been a stubborn son of a bitch since birth, coming into this world a week later than any doctor had predicted, and he'd been doing things his way ever since. Giving up wasn't in his nature.
The first man put on a mocking voice to reply, “I think you mean a two-hundred-pound cart, there, Miner.”
Dean’s bottom lip shook. He kept his eyes squeezed shut, but tears slipped out and fell to the wooden table. Then his forearm swept across his face, hiding it from view.
Dean shook his head again, but there was something in the way he did so that was hesitant. Cas thought back to every word he remembered hearing during their brief window of open communication.
Jamie leaped away from the table, shaking out his arms as if they were sore. Cas pulled his weight from Dean and reluctantly removed his hand from the tangle of wheat blonde hair. Dean went boneless and collapsed to the table with a heavy sigh just shy of a whimper. Doc untied him, but Dean didn’t move.
Dean knew he couldn't shake Sam out of it from here, not without a voice. So he summoned all his willpower, all his strength, and prayed to whoever might still be up there listening to his prayers that he wouldn't pass out. Then he gripped the handle of the knife that curved through the meat of his right thigh, and he pulled with everything he had.
Dean’s mouth sagged in shock. He couldn’t look away. The woman’s eyes rolled back as she made a sound of pure delight. When she blinked and gazed up into Dean’s eyes, her pupils were dilated and her face flushed with color.
“Hm. Well, that would explain your, eh, clothes and underthings. We don’t have the newest fashions here.”
Cas’s brows sank even lower on his forehead. Either he didn’t want to reply or he was attempting to do so through their mental link.
“It’s just a dream,” Cas urged, voice breaking. He held Dean’s face with both hands. “Dean, please.”
Cas felt a different kind of pain, then. It was like something indefinable inside him shrinking. Withering.
Cold sweat slipped down Dean’s back. His mind was his own worst enemy, always had been and always would be. Usually, he could fight the voice of self-doubt, or at least push it down, but this was different. This wasn’t his voice. Hers had taken its place, stolen his voice even from his own head, and she was laughing as he pulled his hands away from Cas to spare the angel his needy clinging.
The piercing whistle from before must have indicated a shift change because out of the mouth of the hill, a dozen men came trodding out, all covered in grime and sweat and oozing exhaustion. They wore plain clothes: jeans, t-shirts, and oil lanterns on their metal helmets. The scene was straight out of some depression-era movie, but in real life, it didn’t seem so much bleak and nostalgic as it did horrifying. Sam’s logical mind short-circuited over both the likelihood and impossibility of what he was seeing.
Cas heard the liquor spill. Felt Dean jolt awake. Then a violent thrash indicated the first piercing of the needle.
The doctor approached both men where they sat. “Now, I know you’re still a bit dazed from your ordeal—whatever it may have been. I’ll try to make this easy on you, but we need to know who did this to you fellas. For our own safety, and the safety of our families. Understand?”
A wiser man might not have gone jogging into the unknown so unprepared. But Dean was doing even worse than that. His ineptitude went far beyond “unprepared.” He was shuffling ahead without a weapon, without a working right hand, without a voice, and little more than a vague idea of where the hell he was in the world. Dean was armed with insanity only, and that’s what kept him upright.
Seeing the world through the demon’s eyes, hearing his voice through her ears, it was messed up and disorienting. He could get lost between his reality and hers, especially because she was with Cas, and that was the only place Dean ever wanted to be anymore.
Then the woman was blocked from his limited view by a young man—the same young man who had helped carry Castiel from the woods. Slowly, Dean calmed down. He took a few deep breaths, and the world came into focus. It was morning. He was inside the doctor’s house still, stretched out on the kitchen table, and the woman who he had just screamed and kicked at was not, in fact, the succubus.
Dean tightened his grip on Cas’s arm and focused on the heat of the other man’s skin and how good it felt to touch him. The angel made a noise of confusion and pain, and Dean relaxed his grip for fear of summoning Castiel back to consciousness too soon.
Dean turned his head and nodded, thinking it the easiest way to explain why he couldn’t make his voice work.
The greatest lingering hurt from the ordeal was Castiel’s emotional wounds, but they weren’t because of the she-demon. They were no one’s fault but his own—a consequence of his sins and shortcomings. No less than what he deserved.
Through the grit of dried tears and the weight of exhaustion, Cas forced his eyes open. If Gabriel was here, perhaps something he had done could explain this phantom pain. But when Castiel blinked away the darkness and his eyes pulled the world into focus, there was no Gabriel. More alarming, everything around him had changed. No shed. No garden tools. Cas lay spread out on his back in an open forest scarce of trees. He seemed to be alone, not even the sound of birdsong to keep him company. The sun set beyond his feet.
Cas tried to speak but choked. It turned into coughing. His whole body was a map of everywhere the demoness had tortured him, and it lit up with fire. He couldn't help but whimper. He opened his eyes and saw Dean staring down at him.
"Dean Winchester," she stated. "I heard that you were insufferable, but I rather like that mouth of yours." She toyed idly with the paring knife in her hands. The rest of her torture implements lay on a table at her side. Save for that table and the chair Dean was strapped to, the room they occupied was an empty basement. It had concrete floors, work lights hung from low-hanging rafters, and a stuffy mildew smell that sank into everything.
“The woman had a spear. The spike was probably seven inches long and made of steel. My arms were tied above my head when she stabbed my shoulder. I assume she pulled the spear out the same way it came in, but I wasn’t conscious then so I can’t be sure.”
But right now, he stared helplessly at the hunter’s chest, drinking up every curve of muscle and every detail. There was the demon seal tattooed in black, the scars both old and new, the dark bruises on his ribs; and on his shoulder was the handprint that bonded the two of them in a way no angel had ever connected to man before.
The footsteps burst into running before both sets stopped as they reached Cas. Knees hit the ground on either side of him. Rough hands landed on his back. He tried not to cringe.
Soon after that first incident, Dean had lost count of his sexual encounters. Getting girls to hook up with him was simpler than he’d ever imagined. From one suck job to the next, not much changed besides the setting and color of hair at which he looked down.
And without thinking, Dean hurled himself forward. He ran out of the woods, screaming Cas’s name without making noise nor caring that he made no sound. He ignored the strange men and the fact that they both screamed and jumped back at the sight of him.
This declaration caused a look of absolute astonishment on the young man’s face that, under different circumstances, Sam might have found amusing.
The next time Dean opened his eyes, it was to behold the beautiful face of a woman with blue eyes and flaming red hair. He balked and jerked away. Something crashed, but the edges of his vision were too black to see anything besides the shock on the young woman’s face. He screamed at her to get away from him, but besides the tightness in his chest, nothing happened. No sound came forth from between his bared teeth.
Cas had to move. He couldn’t give up. The Winchesters never would. They had taught him so much. Given so much. If it was the last thing he did, he wanted to make them proud. Survival was life’s simplest goal, and he could rally for that.
"I am… rather warm," he replied. Hopefully, it was only hot in the shed and not a result of fever from infection. "But that's inconsequential. The succubus is more than a demon. I think she's a god."
Castiel said nothing in return, and the doctor leaned in closer. The breeze from outside the window blew cold.
was nothing compared to the sharp, stabbing agony of sometime before—when the wounds were fresher and his motivation driving and all he could think was
A hand pressed down on Castiel’s forehead, the weight and heat burning him. He tried to flee from the sensation but was too weak to move.
Cas watched Dean leave with a sense of dread coiling in his stomach. It went beyond their dire situation with the demon goddess, which Cas felt certain would get worse before it got better. He wished he could convince Dean to leave him here and get out while he could. Forget the water and just run. But he couldn't because Dean was already gone, and Cas was tied to a wall with a gag in his mouth.
But what the evil bitch had done to Dean… that was burned on Cas’s mind. The embers still smoldered inside him, scalding afresh every time he prodded the memories. He didn’t want to speak about what he’d seen. He wasn’t sure if he could. But the doctor ought to be told, for the sake of helping Dean. And maybe… maybe Cas needed to talk about it.
"You're already damned." Dean thrust the knife straight out into her lower leg. The blade stabbed straight through the meat of her calf after glancing off her shin bone. She shrieked and dropped the garden shears, but she did not bend. Her hand shot out faster than Dean's eyes could register its movement, and she had him by his neck and yanked him into the air.
Hallucinations came in waves and shadows. Shapes appeared on the cobwebbed ceiling. Orbs of light. Angel's wings. Cas imagined the face of one of his long-departed brothers.
The woman stepped closer to the table and replied, “Yes, Jamie. Thank you. I will need a fresh bowl and more water, however, if you please.”
Left alone, Dean tries to plan his escape, but lingering sex magic and fantasies of his favorite angel are a mighty distraction.
He rolled his head to the left. There was only forest floor as far as he could see—not that he had much of a straightaway to study. The horizon tilted upward into a gray cloud. He turned his head the other direction and saw nothing as his vision darkened. This was the side of his shoulder impalement, and it screamed at him. More than that, it wept. The ground beneath him grew damp.
as best he could, and the young man did so clumsily, keeping Castiel upright and tucked close to his side so Dean could take over the man’s weight when ready.
Dean’s hand wrapped tight around Cas’s thigh and moved higher up. The angel spread his legs and shivered. Dean deepened the kiss again, and Cas dropped his head back to let him. The world fell into nothing, along with all pain and fear and shame, and they kissed as if the action gave them life. And in some way, it did.
Castiel replied, “It—um—I don’t think anyone cleaned it. Unless the dem—woman did while I was unconscious?”
“He… he filled the wound with strips of fabric. He used his fingers and pushed them in. The puncture might go all the way through. I-I’m not sure. But it’s at least as deep and long as Dean’s first three fingers.”
Doc seemed grateful for half a second; then his expression fell into deep thought and an even deeper frown.
Sam had seen the fierce look in Gabe’s eyes. Heard the desperate tone in his voice. And the vial of angel grace clasped in Sam’s right hand told him there was some bigger picture. And the words, “Give this to my brother…” played on repeat in Sam’s head.
In his life, Dean had had his dick sucked countless times. He’d received his first blowjob in a public school bathroom from a girl named Tracy, who was in tenth grade and had braces. Dean had been fourteen. He hadn’t even attended the school. His dad had posed as a concerned parent to get close to the werewolf principal and had taken Dean along for credibility, then told his son to get lost and meet him back at the hotel in three hours. So, while John Winchester had hunted, Dean had pretended to be a foreign exchange student, and Tracy had made quick work of his introduction into oral sex.
Now at the top of the hill, the dirty air thickened into a cloud of dust. Lantern light danced across wooden posts that stuck into the rocky ground, all of them leading to one destination thirty or more yards ahead. A hole opened up into the side of another hill, the opening wide enough for ten men across. The sight of steel carts and rails, machinery old in design yet new in years, everything clicked into place across the file folders of Sam’s mind as he filtered through the data and came to an unsettling realization. This was a mining operation. A mining town. Coal. Of course.
“No, Doc, and thanks for askin’.” That last part was grumbled. “It’s these fellas we found on the road.” The older man gestured behind himself, and the doctor put on a pair of wire glasses with small circle lenses and flimsy rounded ends. They were the kind Dean had seen in old Westerns and period movies but never in real life.
“He doesn’t,” Sam said, “Not really. He’s blonde. Green eyes. About this tall.” He indicated Dean’s approximate height, which was still several inches taller than the old man.
He grabbed the thumb of his left hand with the finger and thumb of his right. His grip grew so tight that the cuffs seemed to shrink around his wrist. Several seconds passed with mounting dread. He thought through every moment that was about to happen, and he pined for step one of his plan, wishing he could repeat it for step two and three and...
Dean stood and moved toward the door. He grabbed a four-pronged pitchfork off a rack on the wall and held it tight in his right hand. He looked back over his shoulder, but not directly at Cas.
They both knew Dean could escape without him. He'd broken free of the demon's clutches once already, as well as freed Cas somehow. If the hunter didn't have to worry about getting Cas out too, he'd be fine.
“I figured that could wait, though, at least until we get some broth in you. Unless you think you might throw it up during the procedure?”
The hunter tilted his head the opposite direction as if to explore every facet of the angel’s mouth. Their lips lost contact but only for an instant, and even then, their tongues stayed pressed against each other as their kiss shifted deeper. Cas wrapped his hand around the back of Dean’s neck and encouraged him to never stop kissing him. He’d wanted this so long—far longer than he’d let himself believe. Maybe even before he’d pulled the man out of hell. But he never thought Dean wanted this too.
The coppery taste of the blood-soaked fabric made Cas gag. He nearly spat it out, but then--oh, then--he bit down for all he was worth. Dean was shoving a ball of fabric into the hole in his shoulder. Cas realized that he was thrashing, crying out loud. But Dean had an elbow planted on Cas's left shoulder, a forearm strapped across his chest, and all of his weight pinning him down. The ball of fabric in Cas's mouth kept him from biting his tongue off, but it did little to stop the uncontrolled cries of pain.
The pain would probably make him throw up again, but he didn’t have anything in his stomach to upchuck, so that wouldn’t matter. One of the metal cuffs would be free and clatter against the chair. His hand would be slick and bloody. He wouldn’t be able to touch any of the ropes right away and risk the succubus noticing his bloody fingerprints when she returned. His hand would swell, and he wouldn’t be able to grip anything. But it would be a minor break. It would heal quickly.
"Have something to say?" she asked as she tilted her head. She used the curved blade to lift his chin. "Speak up, Dean."
He felt himself go boneless. Saw the room spin and the lights fade out. This was the monster crash. Dean lost consciousness before he hit the floor.
“I’d say so,” she practically purred as she sauntered his direction. A look of excitement and triumph crossed her features. “I can smell that, you know,” she whispered, and Dean tried not to look as panicked as he felt. Her cold gray eyes zeroed-in on his crotch.
“I know you did,” Dean replied. He tugged on the rope, and Cas’s hands fell free to his chest. He cried out, shocked at the sudden pain, and Dean’s hand clamped down hard over his mouth.
it. Like his body needed water. At least, that’s what her magic made him believe. Refusing her advances was like murdering the sexual part of himself—which was a healthily sized section of who Dean was as a human, and he didn’t know how much longer he could keep refusing her when he’d been so close to orgasm for days.
Dean pulled himself up on shaky legs and took a determined step forward. Cas stiffened. He shifted to look at Dean from the corner of his eye, but didn’t rise or move. Dean’s right leg buckled, but he stepped heavier on his left and repeated the process until he was a foot from Cas. The angel had removed his tie, and a dark bruise lined his neck in its place. Dean ignored the other man’s flinch as he wrapped both arms around Castiel’s shoulders. Several silent moments passed. Cas didn’t bend or soften or even breathe. Dean held on tighter, too desperate to let go even though he knew Cas would have wanted to be let go. But then the ex-angel let out what sounded like a choked sob and turned his face into Dean’s shoulder.
“Fire you? Nonsense. They need every able-bodied man they can get. Just a few minutes more, then you’re free to leave.”
“I can’t baby you anymore, Cas,” Dean said, and the tortured angel felt a comforting warmth from hearing his nick-name. The warmth turned to ice when Dean added, “Take your clothes off.”
The doc hurried to the next topic of conversation. “How in the blazes did you men travel in this condition?”
But something about that body-print had his working hand flexing and closing. His adrenaline spiked each time he came across that smear in the grime. It felt wrong, and that scared him.
“Dean?” he rasped aloud. When there was no answer, he summoned a deeper breath and tried harder. “Dean?”
The succubus moved toward the door again, and Dean realized with a pang of fear that she was leaving.
"I don't want to do this," Dean said, sounding remorseful but determined as he reached above Cas's head. "But how can I trust you, Castiel?"
The demoness muttered something dark and ancient under her breath. Her irises glowed purple as the rims turned pitch black.
Dean’s eyes shone bright green, and Cas almost wished the man would look away to spare Cas from their spell. The hunter spoke, “Yes,” aloud and made no noise. He didn’t seem to be breathing. So, that quiet, intimate moment he had shared with Dean in the shack, the one in which Dean’s touch had lit up Cas’s skin, and they had been close enough to share breath—close enough to kiss and damn near almost did—that must have been what the demon had wanted Dean to see. What she had used to torture him.
He curled his hands to fists and turned away from Dean in the hopes of normalizing before any more damage could be done. In modern times, two men kissing might alienate them from the general public. In nineteen-twenties Alabama, it might get them both killed. Their safety lay in the hands of the red-headed woman in more ways than one.
Agonizing emptiness followed in its wake. Every hollow molecule where Castiel’s grace once resided cried out in phantom pain. The negative space, the nothing, consumed his awareness until Cas couldn’t feel his human body as his heavenly one struggled to comprehend the fact that he had no grace.
The shock that emanated from the man mere inches from Cas’s body was like a heat-wave, and Cas wanted to throw himself into it but he feared this confession would drive a wedge so far between them that no bridge could cross. His voice cracked.
“Now, don't try to move, son,” said a kind, stern voice. Warm hands pressed on Castiel’s chest, keeping him down.
The succubus was unexpected. She was strong, even more so than she seemed at first. Thinking of Dean trapped and tortured had clouded Cas's judgment. His angel mind was a flashing light in the back of his awareness crying out for reason and reinforcements and a plan. But Cas couldn't stop the surge of human emotion that roared up when he realized what the demoness had done to Dean, and what she still meant to do. His hatred for her and his fear for his friend made him act rashly. Stupidly. He'd gotten caught. He'd been tortured and used against Dean. Now the man Cas wanted to save was disappointed in him again. Rescuing
Dean would have nodded, but answering yes to both questions wasn’t the right response. So he shot Jamie a glare until the young man realized his mistake.
The mirage snapped into crisp focus, and Dean stared in horror at a living, breathing mirror of himself. The succubus knelt and looped Cas's arm over her shoulder. The angel grunted as his head lolled back.
“My shoulder. The hole goes straight through. And Dean’s—” Stomach acid threatened to work its way up the ex-angel’s esophagus. But this was important. “Dean’s—” Cas’s hands formed shaking fists. “The woman… she cut him. Along his… his…”
The demoness dropped to her knees and placed herself between Dean’s legs. He spluttered a curse, but she gripped his inner thighs and buried her face between his legs. She licked the wet spot on his jeans like a cat lapping up milk.
Dean huddles against the side of a house and Cas talks to the doctor, who may be more than he seems.
Cas did it for him. He had since the very first day they met, when Cas’s holy handprint burned like righteous fire on Dean’s shoulder. The man—angel—turned Dean’s crank like no one else. Yeah, the guy was clueless and misguided and almost ended the world, but all of that made Cas so much more… real. Way more real than any bar hookup. More real than any relationship Dean had ever had outside of family. And his desire for the angel had been growing, unwanted, in intensity for years.
That was Dean's voice. It sounded gruff and hoarse, but it was him, and that meant they were together and both alive. Thank Chuck.
Cas wakes up on his back in a shack in the woods with Dean. It seems they've escaped the succubus for the moment, but Cas can barely move and Dean is furious with him. But Dean isn't really Dean at all.
Dean’s mind went loose. His thoughts scattered, and when they did, the succubus’s influence poured into his subconscious. Her magic made him hornier than he’d been in his life. For days on end, he felt as though he would come at any moment, and it
Dean’s fists clenched and unclenched. He was sweaty, dry, and shaking all at once. He and Cas needed serious medical attention, but Dean wondered if Doc Emmerson even had the ability to fight infection. Both men needed stitches, but anesthetic didn’t exist in this time—at least Dean didn’t think so—which meant he’d have even more shit to deal with in the near future.
Dean secured the rope, lashing Cas's hands together with a series of loops and knots. "Tying you up," he answered.
“It seemed she had been waiting for someone to find them. She had traps laid and took me captive in an instant.”
Dean saw that Cas didn’t understand the implication, and he knew that the succubus was getting off on his innocence.
Dean bundled his hands to his chest and curled into a ball on the floor, like a dog, he thought. A wounded animal. Dean was cold and hurt so bad he didn’t know where his wounds were any more. He wanted to crawl onto the table with Cas, but he couldn’t bear the thought of accidentally hurting the angel any more than he had already. So Dean shook and held himself and tried to ignore the memories of the tortures—the demon—that had been the one thing to finally, after a lifetime of hunting, break him down to nothing.
Cas and Jamie deposited Dean there. As Cas stepped back, fresh blood dripped down his arm, and Dean, unmoving, looked pale as death. Cas would give anything to be able to fix Dean. Being powerless was killing them both in different ways at different speeds.
Doc sighed. “That’s because it’s hard, son. Not because it ain’t right.” The doctor stood with a groan and raised his voice to address everyone. “Now we gotta get him inside. That wound needs closing up. It can’t wait anymore. Jamie, help the men.”
Only, his shouting made no sound. Even his panicked gasps caused no noise. The demoness freed his neck from her grip and smiled down at him.
The hunter wasn’t willing to open his eyes. If he were to see Cas while feeling the man’s hand in his… that would open up painful possibilities.
Dean grunted. "Freakin' great," then Dean reached for Cas's hand. No, his wrist. He grabbed it tight and moved it to the center of Cas's torso before reaching for the other hand. He took the rope and tied both together.
All energy left Dean as he dropped to his knees behind Castiel’s blood-stained body. Dean lowered his head to his friend’s shoulder. There was nothing else, then. No forest, no other men. There was only Cas and Dean, and they were both still alive. Dean draped both arms and his torso over Cas as if to give the man’s body warmth, though Dean shivered himself.
Doc Emmerson’s hand froze with the glass of water halfway extended toward Cas. His eyes were guarded behind a shroud of practiced neutrality, but his mouth twitched downward. Then a moment later, he completed his motion. Cas took the offered glass of water. It was lukewarm, but that helped it go down easier.
"Open your mouth," he ordered, a bundle of fabric balled up in his fist. "This is going to hurt. I don't want your screams drawing her right to us."
"But--" Cas began before being interrupted by his own shriek of pain as Dean hoisted both his arms above his head. Dean's free hand shoved another strip of fabric into Cas's mouth to quiet him. His shoulder flared with new, white-hot agony.
Dean took his plaid shirt off. The collar sloped down the musculature of his biceps before meeting his pushed up sleeves. His forearms flexed as he tugged the shirt down and off his arms. Cas found himself entranced and lightheaded as Dean stretched his shoulders, wearing nothing but a torn and bloody, white-in-places undershirt. The man looked imposing as he towered above Cas. His hands gripped the collar of his shirt behind his neck and tugged upward.
“I’m sure you do,” replied the she-demon. “But I don’t have time. Not now that I have this new information to play with.” She waved Dean off with a flippant toss of her hand.
Dean sighed, then grumbled, “Yeah,” before coming to kneel beside Cas. The man smelled like mud and blood and tortured flesh. He leaned over the angel’s body and reached to untie the rope.
Sam’s gaze returned to the dark opening in the hillside. Smoke poured out of the darkness, and he felt more alone than he could remember feeling. He turned as a chill of dread fell over him. He called out to the young man and forced himself to ask, “What…what year is it?”
Cas huddled against the wall in pain and torment, slowly dying of his wounds and thirst, yet he didn’t put up any resistance when the fake Dean told him not to look at him. When he swore at him. When he ordered the angel to take his clothes off and said he couldn’t drink water until it was done.
"Are you okay?" Cas asked. There were more pressing issues to discuss, the demoness being high on the list, but Cas was weak and found that fighting his sentimental human side was exhausting.
His words echoed in the abyss of anticipation as time seemed to stand still. Gray eyes narrowed at him in suspicion. “Nineteen-twelve,” said the young man, then added a chuckled, “Last I checked.” His next words rang in Sam’s head and barely reached him through the weight of sheer panic. “You look like you’re gonna keel over.”
“In all my life, I’ve never seen a hunter with a lick of common sense, but you two might just take the prize. What the hell were you thinking cutting into his shoulder? You ain’t no doctor, boy. And the next time you decide to stuff a gaping wound full of rags, don’t forget to clean them! Infection’s every bit as deadly as blood loss.” Each frown line on the man’s face deepened, and for many harsh breaths, he seemed locked in his thoughts. Then he blurted out, ”Now listen here. Are you listening?”
Seeing the Succubus use her magic from a distance was nowhere near as intoxicating as when she used it on him directly, but even though she was trying to seduce Sam, Dean felt that same, sick pull toward her.
"Next time," she began as she bent low to speak and ran the knife along his face. "I'll make sure you can't interrupt our fun."
He was beginning to think he'd never leave this place, so Dean's first order wouldn't be hard to follow. The second one, however, was becoming troublesome with each passing moment.
Voices blurred around Dean’s head. Someone asked what happened, how they were found, if there was any hint of the robbers.
Doing so caused him to shift in his bonds. There was an explosion of white and red behind his eyes. The pain took over, and he lost track of his body.
Cas wasn’t sure how many seconds of dazed and fevered kissing passed before he realized he could touch Dean too, but it was too many, and he made up for lost time by using both hands. Dean’s chest was broad and strong, housing a heart that seemed to want to beat out of the man’s ribs. His bare skin was soft where it wasn’t broken, and as Cas’s left hand ghosted over the raised scar of his own handprint on the hunter’s shoulder, his right searched up Dean’s neck and caressed his stubbled jaw.
“Where are we going?” Sam shouted at Gabriel but could barely hear himself over the furious screeching of the succubus—or whatever the hell monster she was. Never in all his years of hunting had Sam seen a creature with eyes like molten pools of lava or a mouth that opened all the way to its ears. Maybe there was something in the lore, somewhere, but he didn’t think so.
A young woman stood in the doorway where Dean had collapsed. “Me too,” she agreed. Cas thought her name was Rose but wasn’t sure as he’d been half-conscious when she’d entered the house hours ago. Since then, the woman had been in the kitchen cleaning Dean up with the help of the younger stranger from the woods, and Castiel had remained on the wooden bench in the front room.
He struck out and sliced her arm, but the demoness threw him against the wall. His head made a sickening smack. His eyes slipped closed, but in an instant, he was back on his feet, though he had to use the wall to hold himself upright.
“I’m Cast—” He stopped himself. Since losing his powers, it felt wrong to be referred to with the name of an angelic being. “Just Cas. That’s Dean.”
“I have to go,” he said. He grabbed the pitchfork and a pair of garden shears off the wall. “Don’t leave, and don’t die on me,” he snarled before heading out the door and slamming it closed.
From the floor, Cas saw beneath Dean’s raised undershirt to the slash marks along his lower torso. Many were red and inflamed. A couple of the worst ones had yet to scab. Several of them stretched below Dean's waistband.
So Dean imagined a cold beer. A warm bed with clean sheets. No monsters. No end-of-the-world crisis. Sam safe in the next room with a book. Cas sitting at the foot of Dean’s bed watching cartoons on TV and asking stupid, adorable questions that Dean would pretend to find annoying.
"Sure I do," Dean replied with empty bravado, distracted by the pain in his—everywhere—but more so by the fact that Castiel wasn't waking up. The angel had been out cold for several minutes, but at least he wasn't screaming anymore, the anguished, high-keening cries, the gasped,
Cas blinked. Opening his eyes hurt. The light, dim as it was in the darkened room, stung. But no moisture sprang up to relieve the ache. He must be dehydrated. Dean, covered in blood and hovering over him with a scowl, was an alarming but welcome sight.
If only Castiel had never lost his powers! If only he’d been stronger or more prepared before facing down the demoness. This was his fault. He was more than useless. He had caused this. He couldn’t fix Dean. Couldn’t even help.
Cas had been right about the screaming. It was automatic and involuntary, but when he heard himself, he was able to shift into quiet whimpers. Then everything was still. His shirt lay in a heap on top of his jacket and trench coat. Dean’s hands rested on the crests of his shoulders, but no clothing separated his touch from Cas’s skin. It didn’t hurt, but it burned in a way Cas had never experienced before. He desperately wanted to look into Dean’s eyes.
“No courtin’ in my house,” he scolded, voice rough like a dog’s bark. “I ain’t got the stomach for it.”
Despite every effort to focus on forming a plan, Dean’s mind became stuck, as it had for days, on this overpowering need to get off. Trying to think of anything else was becoming a waste of time, and he didn't have any of that to waste.
She unbuttoned her shirt, revealing a hot pink push up bra and massive honking titties underneath. Dean's mouth went dry. He tasted copper and something else, a sickly sweetness that seemed charged with electricity. Her magic, he guessed.
Dean’s entire body pulled tight, starting with his balls. He gasped down air and bit back the scream that wanted to break free. His hands fisted, his eyes screwed shut, and he couldn’t breathe as he came hard enough to see stars.
"Shit," Dean hissed and shoved that knife into his other boot. He was free of the ropes, but another set of cuffs kept his ankles bound to the metal legs of the chair which remained bolted to the floor.
Dean’s head turned toward the old man, but his jaw flared, and he made no attempt to speak. Castiel felt the tension radiating from Dean’s hunched shoulders. The man’s breaths were tight pulls inward and short exhalations. It was a sign of deep frustration and often accompanied by physical bursts of temper. Cas ached to put a hand on Dean’s shoulder but feared such an action would only irritate Dean further.
The doctor laid a hand on Castiel’s good shoulder. “I doubt that, my boy. Anyone could see you’re special to each other.”
Before Sam could comprehend, the angel pulled two items from nowhere. One was a small, clear vial, the other was a knife. Gabriel opened the lid on the vial and used the knife to slit his wrist.
"No!" Dean shouted, stars erupting in his vision and bile crawling up his esophagus. The demon gave him a final grin, one he'd seen on his own face a thousand times in motel mirrors across the country. It was the shit-eating, 'I'm a handsome devil,' expression, a self-inflicted mask and lie that got him out of the room and socializing with the real world when he knew any more solitude would turn him into a shell. It was a grin that flashed cockiness, confidence, and hid all manner of self-loathing and doubt. But on the demon's face, it was the biggest lie of all, and it scared Dean senseless because it was
Words spilled from Cas in a rush. “Dean—h-he looked barely alive when I showed up. Didn’t even know I was there. I don’t think he knew he was there, either—or the woman. He was close to death, but she brought him back, somehow. So he could see.”
He put himself in the path of an older gentleman whose dinged-up helmet sat askance on his head. The man looked up and startled with an audible, “Ah!” His feet retreated a clumsy step back at the sight of Sam, who attempted to make himself smaller by pulling in his shoulders and less frightening by lowering his chin and widening his eyes. When he spoke, he made his tone soft.
“Why’s that?” he asked. “Miss Rose is a damn fine nurse. And her bedside manner’s far better’n mine.”
But they were both free and alive, and that fact helped dim the pain. Dean may end up hating him, but at least he wouldn't be suffering at the hands of the monster. It was enough. Cas knew that Dean's tolerance of his presence was more than he deserved.
The more Sam thought through various scenarios, the more he realized the overwhelming likelihood of Gabriel’s aim having been off. The angel was weakened after running from the succubus and giving Sam his grace. And on top of being exhausted, Gabriel had looked scared. Distracted. It’s possible he had tried and failed to place everyone in the same safe location. Maybe he had missed by miles, but hopefully nothing more. It was likely this would be a different kind of hunt than usual. One not for monsters, but for brothers: his and Gabriel’s.
Cas shouldn’t think about Dean’s body. He reminded himself of that often. The man was… a man. And while Cas knew precious little about humans, he knew that men and women were the natural pairing. He also knew that Dean was a big, big fan of women.
"No," he said. "I'm not. But we're both free." His hands came down to grip Cas's trenchcoat. They ripped the material apart from the shoulder down to the waist. He added, "No thanks to your stupid heroics."
“Don’t worry,” she said as she opened the door. “I know you're lonely down here all by yourself, so I’ll let you watch this time.” With a smirk she added, “Maybe you can come on yourself for me again.”
“You boys get ten minutes to sort each other out, then I need to start stitching up one or t’other of you fellas. And I’m gonna call on Miss Rose to help.”
“Damn stubborn,” groused the older stranger from the floor as he tried in vain to rouse Dean with gentle shakes. “Coulda killed himself. Left a trail of blood from here to Hag’s Cross.” The stranger gave up trying to wake Dean, instead laying him flat on the floor, and shifted attention to Cas. “What’s your names?”
White light trailed from Gabriel’s wrist into the vial. Gabriel’s expression turned pained as his skin paled. The vibration all around them shook the ground beneath their feet, made debris crumble from the walls and ceiling. Gabriel had stopped running, and Sam stopped with him. He asked in a softer tone, “What are you doing?”
When she ran Cas's shoulder through, and he'd cried out like nothing Dean had ever heard before, Dean felt desperation he'd only known a few times before, namely when he thought Sam had died. Feeling those feelings about Cas was intense. Hiding them from both the angel and the demon was one of the hardest things he had yet to endure. Now when the succubus approached Castiel, it was without any weapon. Dean thought that was a good thing at first, a chance that she was giving up on using the defenseless angel as a torture device. She gazed at Dean.
“Well, we’re in a tight spot, fellas,” Doc announced. “Dean, how about you try sitting up? Go slow.”
"Oh, baby," she drawled as she hiked up her skirt, revealing shapely thighs wrapped in black stockings and a garter belt. "I'm going to leave nothing of yours untouched." And then she sat on his lap, straddling him. Dean, handcuffed to the metal chair at wrists and ankles and bound with ropes everywhere else, could do nothing but hide his reaction. That's what she wanted: for him to be aroused by her. Once that happened, she would satisfy him, feed on his sexual desires, and kill him in the act. He'd encountered her type before. Sex demons were a little rarer than vampires, but they weren't usually this demented. Torture was strange for a succubus. So was the fact that she had him trapped. And Cas, too.
The pain was manageable. An egg-sized knot on the back of his head was the oldest of his injuries. The next recent ones were the bruises on his face and ribs from various blunt objects. But the most problematic wounds were the cuts from day three.
Even hours later, the pressure from Cas’s lips lingered on Dean’s, as did the taste of him on Dean’s tongue. The scalding heat from the blue eyes across the room may as well have been a bright neon sign flashing,
Cas repeated this mantra to fight the darkness that clung to the walls of his mind. It wasn’t long ago that he didn’t sleep at all. Now it was all he could do to stay conscious.
It was like having a door slammed in his face—if that door was a freight train and “slammed” meant “completely destroy.” Dean couldn’t breathe.
The sky was growing dark, and the older man headed forward along the path. Dean followed but looked over his shoulder at the younger man struggling to carry Castiel’s weight over one shoulder.
Dean wanted to say a million things, but all he could do was shake his head. Then the door opened, and the old man with the wire glasses entered the house with his hands full of brown paper bags. He glanced at Cas and Dean before greeting Miss Rose, who Dean had forgotten was there.
Ough, that was a selfish thought. Dean hated himself for it. He also hated the fact he couldn’t let go of Castiel’s hand, but the angel had slipped his fingers into the spaces between Dean’s, and nothing had felt so good in over a week. While white-hot flames licked up and down his thigh, the power of Castiel's firm, constant touch against his palm rivaled the sting, and Dean
Dean’s unfocused gaze floated over the angel’s face before his eyes rolled back in his head. Cas caught Dean as he lost consciousness.
“Um—“ Miss Rose’s voice was a squeak and her eyes had yet to blink. Cas didn’t know what to say. He’d never kissed before, much less been caught doing such a thing. What was the protocol?
Doc Emmerson made a shushing sound. “That’s all right. I think I understand. You don’t have to say it. Thank you for telling me. Seems like something your friend might be too stubborn and proud to admit, himself.”
Dean ignored him. He wanted to ask where this doctor was and why the men hadn’t just called an ambulance, but without his voice, he couldn’t. So he followed the lead of the old man in front, never slowing down.
“Well, that was stupid,” mused the doctor. “Where the hell’s he plan on going? Probably won’t make it ten feet without passing out again. Both of you lost enough blood it’s a wonder you didn’t die. And since I have your attention and since we’re on the subject, are you aware there’s a good heft of material stuffed inside a gaping hole in your shoulder that we’re gonna have to remove?”
Well, fuck that. Dean was getting out of the Succubus torture pit, he was finding Cas, saving his life, and killing the she-demon. And it would happen in that exact order.
Cas lay stunned, the physical pain muted at Dean's shocking loathing. But Cas remembered the man's prayer as clear as anything. It had been a soft, whooshing sound. A quiet, pitiful whimper. A last resort. A grudging need. But it had been sincere, and against all sense, that prayer had reached Cas. He had heard it and followed it back to Dean.
A repeating image of the spear going through Cas flashed before Dean’s open eyes, and it staggered him. He gripped the angel’s hand and the edge of the table to stay upright and rooted here instead of there. But as he looked to the doctor, the short horror film of Cas being impaled repeated on a loop. His anguished howl pierced Dean’s eardrums, echoing. Dean trembled.
Castiel’s eyes opened. He took a shuddered breath and moaned. Then his gaze found Dean’s. A bright, warm light like nothing Dean had ever known lit up his insides with joy. Cas was alive. They might be back in time, but at least they were together. But before Dean could smile or express anything at all, Cas shifted his eyes away.
The ropes scrunched up to the roundest part of his shoulders. Dean pushed with both arms as hard as he could outward, and the ropes dragged up his biceps. They released their hold, and Dean used his good hand to pull the massive bundle of woven cord off over his head.
The demoness launched the pitchfork at him like a javelin. Dean threw himself to the ground. The garden weapon clattered against the chair as he hit the floor, but his knife remained firm in his left hand and hidden from her view. His legs twisted as the cuffs kept him pinned. In his boots, the hidden blades sliced him, but not enough to cause alarm.
Dean nodded again. The old man’s obstinance and temper reminded him of his dad, and the grief of that loss hadn’t hit him so hard in years but it was drowning him. Then the doc was gone, slamming the front door behind him. Cas remained unconscious, and Dean was alone hundreds of years before everyone he knew had even been born. Alone, save for the succubus laughing in his mind.
Without his voice, there was no way to tell Cas that what had happened outside of the torture basement wasn’t really him.
Silence followed. Castiel’s thoughts slipped to Dean and wondering where he went. If he was okay. If he was angry at Cas or just disappointed in him.
The high-pitched voice burst into a raspy laugh. “What in the hell did you just say about the mother of God?”
Miss Rose seemed to Castiel like the type of woman who would not be phased by such a thing. In fact, it appeared the implication that she was too delicate for tough conversations irked her. She lifted her chin and replied in a terse tone, “I’ll check in with you in a few hours.” And without further discussion, Miss Rose left the house.
Dean obeyed, crashing to the floor, both hands still up on the table and reaching for any piece of Cas to hold: a shoulder, an elbow. The why and how of sharing their thoughts was a mystery but however it worked, he didn’t want to lose it. He couldn’t go back to how it was, alone and screaming into the nothing with no way out and no good way to express himself beyond glaring and stomping and head-shakes. He and Cas were all each other had in this hell, the only people who knew how screwed they were, and each other’s only hope of salvation. That’s if there was any salvation to be had at all.
Alone in the room with the woman, Dean felt his body shake, and he suspected it had little to do with his physical weakness. It wasn’t that she looked like the succubus. Not exactly, anyway. It was just… too close. She moved a cautious step forward, and Dean climbed down from the table. He wasn’t running away, he was just looking for Cas.
Dean’s heart rose to his throat. Tension closed his airway and stung the backs of his eyes but he would not cry. Cas needed him to be strong. The feel of the man in his arms, even through the veil of the quilted blanket, was more comfort than he’d had in months. Castiel’s hair smelled crisp like fall leaves. His broken, choked breaths on Dean’s skin caused such inexplicable yearning. It crossed Dean’s mind to sit on Castiel’s lap, but he couldn’t bring himself to do anything so feminine, so he knelt before the man and looked up into his eyes. Castiel bit his lip and turned his head away. Dean gripped Cas’s hands, and Cas tentatively glanced at Dean.
It had been five days since food, two since water. A few of the cuts from day three had been so aggressively deep that they still bled if he moved too much. One on his right thigh oozed dark red. His lips were cracked, his mouth felt scraped out by sandpaper, and delirium was becoming a problem.
Words eluded Cas, and his throat became so tight he doubted he’d have been able to speak. So he kept shaking his head.
Cas glanced sideways at the unconscious Dean. One of the men from the road was pulling Dean’s body upright while the other stranger was returning with a tin cup of presumably water.
The front door burst open, bringing with it the cold breeze from outside and the young man who had rescued them days earlier. James? John?
“Move.” Doc’s voice was gruff and terrifying. Cas shifted aside as the old man dropped a cup of water on Dean’s face. It did nothing. Dean shook harder. It sounded like his lungs were about to collapse.
"You're lucky I'm so patient," she said as she propped her leg on the chair. With her free hand—because, yes, the monster was strong enough to hold him by his neck with just the one—she tugged the blade from her leg. "Now be a good dog." She threw Dean onto the floor. "And lay down," she commanded with her hand pressing on his neck. She straddled him at the waist. He fought to get out from beneath her, but she didn't budge an inch. Her hand was like a metal shackle pinning him by his throat to the ground, and she wielded the knife above him.
Gaining new readers and going through your comments are the biggest motivators for sure. Thanks so much!
Cas tried to find any level of comfort by shifting in his seat, but none came. He winced and spoke through a pained grunt.
Sam and Gabriel storm the Succubus's lair in the hopes of rescuing Cas and Dean, but things go awry.
His wounds hadn’t healed—he knew without checking—but something had given him a boost. Likely, that same thing had called for his grace, and Castiel’s “muscle memory” had made him try to use that non-existent limb. Thankfully, the pain of that particular torture was fading into the background where Cas kept it out of reach.
Dean considered himself an open-minded deviant. He liked it rough. Denial play was fun. But this was literal torture, and he was unraveling from the pain. His balls had been kicked with steel-toed boots and hurt less than this. His straining erection ached. Even the muscles low in his stomach felt pinched from the lack of release. His prick begged to be touched. It was ready to explode.
Dean had rarely ever been so close to Cas. He reminded himself that he still wasn’t, not really, but even if it was through a demon’s eyes, he still saw a thin vein pulse an uneven rhythm up the pillar of Cas’s neck, and it still made his dick twitch. He saw the goosebumps on the man’s skin as the demoness trailed her hands along his chest. She had left Cas’s tie on around his neck, and Dean knew that detail was for him alone. The bitch grabbed it and choked up on it, making the circle of blue fabric tight around Cas’s neck. And Cas, his eyes downcast, had his mouth open to catch whatever air he could.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered. “I thought I could but…” He balled his hands into fists. He wore his shoulders like earrings. “I can’t take any more blood.”
It didn’t work. Of course it didn’t work. Dean couldn’t hear him, and Cas had no heavenly power to make him. But the nightmare, whatever it was, was making Dean worse. Cas had a sense that this was not an ordinary dream, but something to do with the she-demon. Dean looked like he was in the midst of torture even now. He needed to be woken up. Cas had to do something.
Dean heard his own voice curse at Castiel, and fury raced up his spine like an electric shock. He ordered the man not to look at him, and Cas
The world twisted as the demoness moved forward into the shack. It was nauseating. Dean felt trapped inside her body and seasick with the uncontrolled motion. She kneeled, and it seemed like Dean was mere inches from Cas, but he was still so far away. He couldn’t feel the other man, smell him, or touch him. He could only look through the eyes of a demon and wish that this had never happened.
“Well, if I was a biscuit I’d be good and buttered.” The doctor looked exhausted as he sunk down to the bench beside Castiel. “But save your flattery,” he instructed the coal-covered man. “What is it you want if not to court my assistant?”
“No,” Sam hushed, even as he fumbled a sideways step and reached out a hand for balance. “No, just tired.”
"We have to stop this bleeding," Dean said. "Before I can move you. And we should move soon. She's still out there."
The hunter turned to look over his shoulder at the doorway. When he saw the woman, he startled and lost balance, and Cas didn’t move fast enough to catch him before he knocked against the nearest chair on his way to the floor.
"All this fighting," the she-demon said. "When we could be making love instead. Doesn't make any sense."
Her eyes flew wide as she looked him up and down. For a moment, she appeared frightened and backed up, but then seemed to realize her prisoner remained chained by his feet. She stepped forward, tightening her grip on the pitchfork and garden shears.
No. What Sam wanted was to keep looking for Dean and Cas. But he knew if he was going to get through this—if any of them had a chance of surviving and reuniting—it would be because they were all smart. So he choked down the panic, the bravado, the urgency and desperation that called him to keep going full steam ahead until he found Dean and Cas and figured out how to get everyone home. He caged the parts of him that would likely get him caught or killed and summoned his better sense. The steady warmth from his jacket pocket helped ground him, and he answered.
The mirthless sound of the angel’s chuckle made Sam’s blood run cold. Suddenly his fear of the monster shifted into fear of a different kind, especially when he saw the hollowness behind the angel’s eyes. Sam’s throat felt thick. “Gabriel—”
Doc Emmerson stomped into the room with a half-empty glass of what might have been liquor or water, but judging by the sheen over the old man’s eyes, Dean would put money on liquor.
Dean stopped his soundless swearing. He gritted his jaw. His eyes shut tight, probably because the needle was piercing his skin again, but they opened moments later and searched for Cas.
The old man sighed and mumbled not-quite under his breath. “Why doesn’t that surprise me?” He stretched his bowed shoulders and took a deep breath before grousing, “Well, if you two die I can take comfort in the fact it was your own damn faults. But do try to stay breathing.”
No! Cas bit his cheek to sharpen his mind. He could not give in. There were too many questions. He had to piece together the puzzle, determine if Dean was safe, and then maybe he could let go.
Dean staggered in his mind, swaying where he knelt. It was all disconnected. He had been sent back in time before, but nowhere near this far. Not under these circumstances. Synapses fired and gave out signals, but nothing in his body responded.
He squeezed his eyes tightly shut, as though expecting a blow.  Then he nodded.  “Yes.  That’s why I had to go to such lengths to get it for you, because it was already part of a defense contract.  I was trying to save you, Dean, but it was wrong!  It was so wrong, and I’m so, so sorry!”
Dean swallowed.  He shifted in his chair, feeling self-conscious.  “I told you I was starving,” he mumbled.  “The only reason I robbed that store was because I was so hungry.  But you don’t want to hear that.”  Dean went back to eating, moving marginally slower than he’d been.  He watched Cass from the corner of his eye.
“It’s a salvage yard, not a junkyard!” Bobby Singer yelled.  His eyes were wild between his battered ball cap and his scruffy beard.
Ruby pushed open a smaller gate leading into a garden and stopped.  “On your own from here,” she said.  “Time to let your boyfriend go, Meg.”
Dean caught up with his brother in the hall.  It was clear Sammy wanted to talk, judging by the way he was waiting and brightened when he saw Dean.  Dean caught him by the arm and moved him until he was sure they were out of range of Cass’s hearing.  Then he had his brother and was shoving him roughly against the wall.  “You stupid shit!” Dean hissed.  “You put together a daylight kidnapping, on a public highway, of a top-level Roman Enterprises executive, while you’re hallucinating?  What the hell were you thinking?!”
“To who?!” I countered.  “What, you idiots actually think you can sell me?  That’s what this is about?!  I’m not a robot, alright?  I’m just a soldier, enhanced by the government!  I’ve got cybernetic components, but my body’s human!”
“It’s alright,” Castiel declared.  “They had to keep him under for the medical nanites to flush the infection out of his system and stabilize him from the blood loss and shock.  Then they took him right into surgery before he ever woke up.  He won’t be upset.  He doesn’t know he lost his arm, so it won’t matter!  Chances are, he’ll never know!  Dean will wake up, and he’ll have two arms, and he’ll never know one of them’s cybernetic.  Then he can go back to being my bodyguard, and everything will be back to normal!”
“Did you think I didn’t notice the holy oil on the ground from the moment I walked in here?” the Trickster snarled.  “I knew you would try something like this, Ketch!  It never had to be this way.  I would have talked to you, had you only listened.”
Four months later, Dean Winchester held Castiel in his arms as he leaped from the roof of the Heaven building.  But they never hit the ground.
He went through drive-throughs and stopped for gas with Cass’s wings carefully covered in the stolen sheet.
“Bullshit,” Winchester repeated.  “A partnership is where two parties have equal, or at least similar, power.  But human vessels and the angels that take them don’t have that.  To prove it, I’d like you to answer my question.  How has the human you’re wearing been since you took him?”
Gabriel had looked ready to faint at any moment, but now he suddenly came to life.  “That’s what you care about, Naomi?  Our brother could have been tortured, killed by terrorists, or he could even be dying right now from a stray bullet, and you’re worried about the news coverage?!”
I snarled, jerked myself free, and came at him again.  Dean and I had sparred frequently when we were growing up, but I’d never really tested him since we’d both been drafted and augmented.  I knew I was strong, and my height gave me reach on him.  But the prick was Special Forces.  A few blocks, some well-aimed hits and a leg sweep and I was down on my stomach, my arms twisted up behind my back.  He gave them a jerk, making me yelp.  “Sammy!  I did not come here to fight you!”
“You know I’m in,” Bobby added, wincing as he got back up with popping joints.  “After all you and your team did, I’d give you a kidney.”
“I wasn’t referring to that crazy old man,” Azazel corrected.  “I was referring to an even crazier ex-soldier I believe you recently were acquainted with.  Goes by the name of Castiel Novak?”
Still, Ketch was glad he’d selected Nicholas as his partner for this mission.  Along with his reputation as a formidable operative, Nicholas was a crack shot, nearly as good as himself.  Plus, Ketch could keep a close eye on him.  The man was functioning perfectly, keeping close to Ketch so they could cover each other as they waited for another pair to blow open the entrance.
“It’s just a scan of your collar,” Castiel assured.  “Security will scan it, match you to my ID, and you’ll be permitted to go anywhere I can go.  Executive laborers have free reign.  Eventually, I will have you performing various tasks, but not today.  Today, I just want you to watch and learn.”
Of course, Bobby offering up his salvage yard as collateral for Dean’s bond had been heart wrenching.  Naturally, Dean would appear for his court date, but Bobby barely knew him.  He had no guarantee Dean wouldn’t run off, leaving Bobby to lose everything.  It was touching that Bobby had so much faith in him, but Dean felt as though he now had something to prove.  Bobby believed in him.  Dean needed to be worthy of that.
Next to him, Bobby was hanging dangerously out the door.  Lucifer and Michael shoved the two bleeding figures of Cass and Chuck to him.  Others were piling into the truck.  A short, brutal firefight broke out in the back when some Roman Enterprises men attempted to infiltrate the truck.  Charlie blasted one of them in the face.  Luc simply threw the second out the back, where he vanished beneath the wheels of Sam’s moving vehicle.  Bullets were still flying, pinging off of the sides of the truck.  But Cass and Chuck were safe in the back.
Dean couldn’t believe what he was hearing.  He was giving serious thought to jumping across the table and launching himself at Dave, just to knock the smug look off of his face.
It wasn’t until much later that Dean learned that the truck itself had been loaded down with explosives, far more than had been in the package inside.
Alfie pushed a disappointed Luc and Mike out of the room.  “No more spying on our brother!  He wants his alone time with Dean, he’s going to get it!”
Dean must deal with the fall-out of Angel's actions, but his worsening condition is creating a new set of problems
“Actually, this network isn’t bad,” Gabriel called, earning himself a double-take from Charlie.  “the biggest thing slowing it down is the halfwit redhead sitting like a spider in the middle of it, trying to spy on us.”
Naomi’s lips pressed into a thin line.  “As you wish, of course.”  She glanced over at Dean.  Dean winked slyly at her.  She quickly looked away, returning her attention to Castiel.  “Either way, you simply must increase your productivity. Even a five percent increase would potentially mean millions in revenue.  Regardless of who you choose as your bodyguard, if you simply agree to max out your processor times in your lab, you could...”
Dean absently stroked the wristband he wore, his eyes on the matching band on Castiel’s wrist.  “Let’s pretend for a moment that I’m not a hot, sexy, super-intelligent Angel, and start explaining this like I’m a barely-literate ex-military bodyguard who only just graduated high school.  Then I might have a snowball’s chance in Hell at understanding it!”
“Research?”  Gabriel cocked an eyebrow.  “Your requests for data from my section have slowed to a trickle!”
“Oh!  I’m sorry.” Castiel let go of Dean’s hand, saw him wince again, flex his fingers, and rest it on the bed.  Full integration.  Good.  The prototype cybernetic arm was exactly that - a prototype.  It had performed flawlessly in testing conditions, but this was the first time such an advanced limb replacement had ever been used in the field.  Along with working as well as Dean’s natural arm for ID scans, it perfectly mimicked living flesh, with full sensation, skin texture, warmth, even a pulse that kept perfect time with Dean’s heartbeat.  The fact that Dean was complaining about it being sore meant that his nerves were nearly finished integrating.  And Castiel had spent the last half an hour jacked into a hidden recessed port on the underside of the mechanical limb, adding in finger and palm prints from the Angeli Quinque security banks, dotting the skin with freckles from his own memory banks or educated guesses based on his other arm, and programming detailed analysis of Dean’s natural skin tone so that the limb would tan in sunlight and fade with less exposure.  It was some of his best work.  Angeli Quinque stood to make millions from it.  Well, they’d just have to wait until Castiel’s labs created another. It shouldn’t take long.  Castiel still had the full specifications in his computers at his lab.
“Michael knew,” Luc grumbled.  “He says he was brought in because he needed to screen laborers for illness from the dome so he could direct the auctions.  He wanted the worst ones for the labor camps, either the violent ones who would kill each other off or the sick ones who would die quickly.  The strong, healthy laborers were directed for the inner dome.  Those were the ones who would be taken with us when we left the dome.”
That made Dean laugh.  He started walking again, and Castiel absently followed. “Can I pry, ask what Samandriel used to do for you?”
It's possible for the conscious mind to suppress many of the effects of trauma.  That's not always the case during sleep.
Dean made his usual fast work of his food so he could get on with his morning routine, get packed, and get back on the road.
Rooney exchanged a glance with Angelo.  “Dean, I don’t blame you for having doubts.  Trying to see things from your point of view, not knowing who to believe, I suppose I can understand, to a point.  You, um, have feelings for Novak?”
Dean immediately knelt over the woman and started chest compressions, trying to remember the CPR classes he’d had when he’d briefly worked as a lifeguard at the city pool.  “Come on!” he urged.  “Dude, do you have an AED?  Get over here, I need help!”
Castiel stayed where he was.  He held Dean’s hand, watching him sleep.  Time slowly ticked by, minutes measured only by Dean’s steady breaths.  Eventually, he heard his siblings return.  There was a bit of arguing downstairs.  Then Gabriel was gently knocking on the door.  “Cassie?”
It took me a moment of confusion to realize the man was speaking of Castiel.  Well, now that I thought about it, the coverings I’d created for him could potentially resemble some sort of dress.  “Yes, sir!” I called before Cas’s gravely baritone could give anything away.  “I’ll get her in.  Much appreciated, sir.”  Perfect. If anyone asked this guy, he’d say he saw a man and a woman.  One less chance that we’d be tracked.
The words rang with the clear sound of truth.  Cass’s hand was warm on Dean’s cheek.  It was somehow comforting.  It took Dean a while before he realized that he was leaning onto the hand, that he’d reached up his own hand and covered it, holding it in place against his cheek.  He’d even let his eyes close a bit!
“Because someone arranged for you to get out of the Senator’s home.”  Ketch chuckled, seeing the look on Dean’s face.  “Dean, I’m sure you did everything you could to help Novak rescue you, and I’m aware of his reputation.  But it seems clear that Novak got you out without any back-up because Turner was already injured when he came for you.  My orders were as follows.  When you went to bed, there was to be a silent alarm on your door.  There were to be two guards stationed at each exterior door.  Every hall has hidden cameras that were to be monitored at all times.  But starting from the day before you were taken, those orders were changed.  There were only two guards in the entire building, no one was watching the monitors, the alarm on your door was turned off, and so were the cameras.  When I questioned the guards, I was informed that these orders all came from me, and were part of an elaborate plan that involved Novak taking you out.”
“Yes, Samandriel was good!  But I’m a monster, I’m a murdering monster!  I killed Samandriel, Lucifer, and I deserve everything that happened to me since then because I took him away from us all!  I’m the monster that killed Samandriel, and now we’re all nothing but machines!”
Mom eyed Dean, as though noticing him for the first time.  Her eyes lingered on his gold veteran’s pin with its enamel black-out backing.  He was eyeing her back.  When he saw her eyes on him, he nodded.  “Ma’am.  I’m Dean Winchester, Sammy’s brother.”
Dean swallowed hard and fastened his seatbelt.  Somehow, he had a feeling that maybe the police might have been a safer option than jumping into this man’s car.
“Yeah, that’s right up Dick’s alley, alright,” Dean growled.  He was suddenly wishing the man was still alive, just so he could pop Dick right in his smug mouth.  “Ok.  So I go get it.  What do we do if they don’t believe Dick sent me?”
Dean closed his eyes.  He could almost hear his father’s voice, mocking him.  The pain he was feeling now was all too familiar.  Last time, he’d been locked inside a small closet, not able to stretch out.  At least here, he could move.  That was better.  Right?
Dean doubted that, but said nothing.  Castiel clearly was upset, and believed what he was saying.  Dean had his own thoughts about Naomi Novak.  Then he straightened.  “Wait a minute,” he called.  “Cass, where’s your family now?”
Sammy didn’t answer.  He watched as Dean picked up his father’s hunting knife, attaching the sheath to his belt.  “Just be careful, ok?”
“So it would seem.”  Dean kissed the top of Cass’s head, earning himself another sleepy grumble.  “Any idea what time it is?”
An alert sounded, drawing Castiel’s attention to his indicator bar.  To his dismay, he saw that he was nearing the top of his new security limits.  No!  He was so close!  “Computer! Override authorization Samandriel one seven!” he called.
Even a day ago, Dean would have believed that whole-heartedly.  Now, though, he couldn’t be sure.  Still, he had little choice.  Cass’s hand was firm on his arm.  He wasn’t actively hurting the teen, but Dean would have little chance of twisting free easily.
“You’re saying that you brought a violent convict into this house,” Naomi began, “before you made sure that your own family had protection from him?!”
Castiel got up and stifled a groan.  His headache had improved with sleep, but was still very much present.  The pain behind his eyes would likely only get worse.  Castiel retrieved his pistol and returned it to the ankle holster.  Then he got up and began to make the shitty coffee provided by the motel.
His eyes moved back to his companion.  Angel was sitting on the bed in the motel room, staring moodily out the window.  Truth be told, Dean realized, Angel hadn’t wanted to be assigned to Dean any more than Dean had asked to be chosen.  The son of a bitch was just following orders.  Dean certainly hadn’t done the poor bastard any favors.  Now he honestly believed that, if demons didn’t kill him, his own fellow angels would, just so Michael could take Dean.  What kind of asshole was Michael, anyway?  It wasn’t like Angel didn’t try his hardest to do his job!  If he’d simply dragged Dean to Michael, he could have just fluttered off to his next assignment.  Instead, he’d tried to talk to Dean.  Look at the results.
I didn’t either, but I had no time to think too much about it.  Cas was still in a panic.  Now he was screaming at me and Gabe, begging us to not let him be stolen, begging for Samandriel, and the entire time, over and over again, he tried to stab us with his missing blade.  Gabe looked sick, and I didn’t feel much better.
But then Bobby stood up and my angel was there, kissing me fiercely.  “Are you sure about this, Dean?” Cas asked anxiously.  “Your enhancements were never designed for this.  I can’t promise it won’t be painful!”
“Wait, no offense to Dean, but why can’t we just take care of Cas ourselves?”  I’d expected the question, but it was Luc, not Raph, who had spoken.  “I’m happy to take care of him!”
To his surprise, Dean laughed.  There was no humor in the laugh, which made Castiel frown.  “That’s funny,” Dean said.  “It’s hilarious that I’ll ever be given any sort of choice in anything as long as I’m in this house.”
Lucifer was scowling when he came in.  “These performance evaluations are a bitch and a half!” he complained.  “I’m only halfway done!  Who has time for this shit?!  Cas, where are you on yours?”
That earned him a kick in the ribs.  Dean grunted again, propelled onto his back.  Then Gordon was on top of him, straddling his body as he rained blows onto Dean.  Dean did his best to shield his face, swinging whenever he saw an opening.
Castiel eyed him.  Then he tentatively reached out and touched the band on Dean’s wrist, his eyes moving to the matching wristband on his own.
“I have no intention of sacrificing him!” Ketch snapped, finally showing a touch of temper.  “I’m perfectly capable of protecting Winchester.  And while I will admit that, if it came down to it, I would absolutely sacrifice him in order to capture the Trickster, there’s little chance that...”
Their chance came about because of the chaos caused by job transitions clashing with Chuck’s responsibilities.  He had to go sign paperwork on a day when Michael, Lucifer, Naomi and Gabriel all had their own tasks.  Only Castiel was left to deal with moving.  Each of the Novaks was due to be in a different location at the same time, but there weren’t enough bodyguards to go around.  Castiel, naturally, announced he’d be safe driving with Dean and dealing with Crowley and graciously volunteered to be without a bodyguard.  Chuck didn’t like it.  Gabriel liked it even less.  But in the end, Cass got his way.  For a space of two hours, no Roman Enterprises bodyguard would be watching them.
Castiel sagged, nodded.  “I’m sorry.  I still don’t understand why you don’t want more of what we shared, but I will respect your decision.”
It was like watching a train crash in slow motion.  At the sound of the deputy’s voice, Dean turned, started back towards the angel.  The waitress grabbed his arm and yanked, forcing him to stumble back.  Then two more people were on Dean, another waitress and a man dressed as a cook, all intent on dragging Dean into the kitchen.  Meanwhile, Angel was getting to his feet with an irritated look in his eye.  Dean’s mind flashed back, hearing Angel telling him that threatening an angel was punishable by death.  Already, Angel’s eyes were starting to show the telltale blue glow.
“I mean my job is to keep you here, and safe,” Castiel reminded.  “Bringing you to Detroit to face Lucifer?  That’s completely out of the question!”
“Samandriel.”  Castiel looked down, shifting a bit on the ottoman.  “What I asked you to pass on to him?  I had hoped that it would trigger his memories.  Our history together led me to believe that, given the right phrase, a nudge in the right direction, he might understand.  If he had only done as I’d hoped, we might have been able to track him down and rescue him.”
“This project, I need my full computation ability to pull it off.  And now that Lucifer is going to let me have it for twenty-four hours?  I can do this, Dean!  I can make it work, and then...”
Tran was staring at me.  “H-how do you know all of this?  How can you know so much about me and my son?”
“Benny, why don’t you see what you can find out about the tunnels leading out of the dome to the farmlands?” Bobby ordered.  “Charlie, get the jewelry off of these two and then work with Castiel to see if you can find out anything more about that transport.  Sam and Dean?  Finding people who don’t want found is pretty much your specialty.  So get to work.”
The green eyes softened, Dean’s hand rising to gently stroke his hat over his plate.  Castiel sighed and closed his eyes, leaning into the hand.  “You’re not gonna lose me, angel, ok?” Dean was saying.  “We got two things going for us here.  One, those friends I talked about?  They’ve got years of experience at getting around under the noses of Angeli Quinque.  If there’s anyone who could get an Angel out of that hellhole, it’s them!  And if that doesn’t work?”  He raised his wrist, showing off his wristband.  “We have a back-up plan!”
Ketch had him by the arm and was gently steering Dean out of the room.  “A bullet proof vest will stop a bullet, but it won’t do much to spread the impact over a wide surface,” he explained.  “Nor will it stop a knife thrust.  So it’s fairly common to slice the vest in a few strategic places and insert the metal plates.  Trust me, if someone takes a shot at you, you’ll be glad for the precaution.”
Even Alfie was watching now, a goofy grin on his face.  Luc and Mike were watching in awe-struck wonder.  Raph was sniffing and dabbing at his eyes with a handkerchief.  But my eyes locked with the amber eyes looking up at me.  As Dean continued to sing, Gabe stepped closer, reached for my hand. I closed my own around it, held it to my chest.  My other hand moved to his waist.  His went on my shoulder.  And then we were swaying as if on instinct, our eyes locked with each other.  Dean, I’d realized, had opened the door.  By unknowingly revealing the truth about his relationship with Castiel, he’d given me permission to finally, finally let my brothers know the truth about me and Gabriel.
Dean didn’t like it.  But the temptation of getting the collar off was too much.  “Alright,” he reluctantly agreed.  “Let’s get this bad bling off of me.”
Castiel registered Dean’s gasp of dismay, the mocking from the guards.  But his attention was locked on Dick Roman.  Roman’s eyes were filled with a familiar fire.  He licked his lips, looking Castiel up and down.  It was obvious the man wanted him.  Roman proved it with a nod.  “You and me, Novak.  Think you’ll enjoy this, Winchester?  One way to find out!”  He pushed Dean towards his guards.  “Take him upstairs.  Make sure he’s got a clear view of the bed.”
“My head hurts,” Dean complained.  “Why does it always have to be this stupid spy bullshit?  How the hell do you people live, knowing every time you turn around someone might just stab you in the back?”
Cass shook his head.  “If Dean wanted to run, he had the chance.  And at this point, I don’t know that I have the right to stop him if he decides he wants out of things now.  I can’t expect to help him when I don’t know what’s going on myself.”
Ignoring Dean’s sputters, Roderick headed towards headquarters, where the delivery truck was rolling to a stop.
“Yeah, I think I see what you’re getting at,” Sammy said slowly.  “It’s the same type of thing, isn’t it? Because Alfie can’t control minds, but he can alter how any Angel feels or reacts to any given situation!”  He turned to Gabriel.  “Gabe, I’m going to ask you a question.  And I want you to say the first thing that comes to your head, with one exception.  Do NOT say ‘It needed to be completed,’ alright?  Now.  Why did you change your mind about Project Chimera?”
“Dean, if you’re seeing this, it means I’m probably dead,” Sam said in the recording on the data chip.  “I’m recording it on a chip I hid in Gabe’s comb, after the wedding vows I recorded for him.  Normally, I’d believe it’s the one thing Gabe would never let go.  But Gabe’s been influenced, had his emotions altered against me.  They all have except Alfie, so just to be sure, I’m going to instruct Gabe to give this to Cas after my funeral as my final wish.  Cas is so fussy about his hair that he’ll use it all the time and you’re bound to see it.  It’s fancy enough that I hope you’ll ask about it.  If he gives it up, you’ll know for sure that my angel’s been corrupted. Because I know that you’ll come into Heaven’s Angels after me, Dean.  And you’ve got to find this!  You need to know what I found out.  It concerns two people, and the first is Naomi Shurley.”
“I don’t give a shit,” the candidate wheezed.  This second impact with the ground seemed to have caused him some breathing difficulties.  “I don’t care if you want me for the platinum archangels of Heaven or some standard class button pusher.  I don’t want to be an angel vessel!  Why can’t you understand that?”
My coworkers exchanged surprised looks.  “Did that damned thing finally break?” Barney asked.  He started towards the front and looked out.  “Oh!  The gate’s open, who left it open?  Aw, shit! Dean, where’s your boyfriend?  He didn’t go out while that gate was open, did he?”
Ok.  Opportunity missed, but it was hardly the end of the world.  There would be other chances.  Dean would let Cass down gently, of course.  The man had been hurt, after all.  Maybe Dean could help?  Give him some pointers?  Granted, all Dean knew was how to attract women, not men.  Still, Cass was a good-looking guy.  Surely he couldn’t have that much trouble attracting someone!  Dean could help.  He’d build up Cass’s self-confidence, get him set up with someone decent, and everyone would be happy.  Then he wouldn’t be too disappointed when Dean managed to escape.
Azazel’s smile turned into a grimace.  “I’m afraid we’ve gotten off on the wrong foot.  I’m here...”
“That’s why she didn’t get promoted,” Dean realized.  “Because the rest of the winged dicks didn’t want her doing it.  But Michael wants me so he can come down to put a stop to it, right?  So why are you keeping me away from him?”
“Here’s the thing.”  He draped an arm around Castiel’s shoulder.  “When I stomp our brother’s face into the ground, and believe me, I am going to beat him this time, I’m going to have to convince the rest of our brethren that they should all fall neatly in line.  Can’t have any pesky rebellions like the one you started springing up.  But see, you did start a rebellion, Castiel.  One that actually proved capable of stealing and keeping Michael’s vessel from him for a while.  That, I have to admit, is pretty impressive!”
Sam rolled his eyes.  “Don’t you get it?  Roman wants us to turn on Novak and start fighting each other, just like the news is saying we’re doing.  But if we start fighting each other, Roman will swat us all like flies.  And if we kill Novak, or ransom him back?  Then we will never know what is really going on!”
It was done.  By this time tomorrow, Sam Winchester would be an orphan.  Fortunately, he had a qualified adult ready, willing, and able to step in.  Lucifer opened the search engine on his computer and began searching for information on how best to soothe a grieving teen.  When Sam got the news, he’d need comforting.  Lucifer intended to be ready.
Cass let him up.  “Thank you.”  Cass was wincing, rubbing at his temples.  Apparently, he really did have a pounding headache.  “And thank you for helping me earlier.  I’m so sorry about that,” he continued, waving towards the destroyed television.  “I must have frightened you terribly.”
He frowned, his eyes flickering as his computer ran the figures.  Then he nodded.  “It could, potentially, bring the load on my own nervous system down to a minimum of 10%, well below the 15% threshold I’d have to maintain to prevent overload.  But we’d still need to obtain a velocity that’s a bit more than we did the first time.”
Dean kissed him back.  “I love you, too.  Believe me, there is nothing in this world that I want more than to just stay here, in your arms, for the rest of my life.  But Cass?”  Dean caught Castiel’s hand, reached it up to the collar at his throat.  “I can’t live like this.  I can’t just walk around, knowing I’ll be shocked enough to incapacitate me if I move more than a set distance from you or my central hub.  I can’t wake up every morning, looking at your family with their remotes in their hands and wondering if I’ll be shocked that day.  I can’t go back to your office, keep my head down and be a docile servant...”
Dean had never experienced anything like this.  Cass’s hands were everywhere.  He kissed Dean again and again.  He thrust deep into Dean.  Dean’s cock, between their stomachs, was leaking, creating its own lube as their skin rubbed together.  Cass was panting.  “You feel amazing, Dean.  You’re everything, all I’ve ever wanted!”
“Alright, then put me under and go to town.  The synthetic skin will heal, but try not to mess me up too badly.  Now you’re going to see some things in that arm that don’t exist yet.  And they work by connecting through my nerves back to processors implanted in my brain. A quick x-ray will show you where.”
“Because he wasn’t getting an answer!”  Dean shook his head.  “Listen, Bobby can come with me.  There’s no reason I should go in there alone.  But has it occurred to anyone here that maybe we don’t have to torture Cass to get him to help us?  I pushed a lot of his buttons after he took me, but he never actually hurt me.  I think, if we just give him a chance and let him know Michael still doesn’t have me?  He might be a lot more willing to work with us.  At any rate, what have we got to lose?”
The soldier behind Dean tripped over him, which tripped the one behind him, and so on until the ground was covered with groaning, cursing soldiers.
“Not far.”  I looked ahead and brightened, seeing the town ahead.  “You can just drop us off at the edge of town, sir, no need to go out of your way.”
“This is Dean,” Cass had explained, barely getting out of the way before Rufus shoved his way in.  Apparently, Cass was accustomed to this behavior from Rufus.  He appeared completely nonplussed as he closed and locked the door behind the older man.  “He’s with me.”
