Which is why she smiles and tells Obie there’s none left for him as she takes out the last one and allows her uncle to shuffle her past flashing cameras and cheering SI employees.
Toni crumples the burger wrapper in her hand, gaze flickering over the tops of the reporters heads. Rhodey stood in the back, a small encouraging smile on his lips.
“Oh, hey,” Toni says, like she didn’t just watch the woman cut through the crowd and plant herself in the open space by Toni’s side.
Steve stares, immobilized by everything that’s just happened and unable to stop DUM-E from dousing the crash site with his fire extinguisher.
“So, Tony,” Bucky suddenly says, and Tony swivels around to face him. “Any reason aside from being the help for the help that you’re assigned to this political caravan?”
Had Steve known what the road ahead held for him...well, he wouldn’t change anything, but he would’ve definitely guarded his heart a little more.
Steve blinks down at the floor, wondering how he ended up on all fours through the ringing in his ears. Then he idly realizes he’s heaving in shallow breaths.
"What is it?" Howard carefully takes the disk and squints as he held it under the desk lamp Toni had on.
Now, she’s changed. She felt it the moment she stared at her own last name in that desert right before it exploded in her face. She felt it as they shoved her head under water time and time again. And she felt it as Yinsen’s life slipped from his eyes.
“Are you sure you don’t need that, honey?” Howard rasps, and Toni smiles as she steps forward into his open arms, careful with her hold. He looked older and way more frailer than the last time she saw him. God, it must’ve been hell on him, the past couple of months.
Toni shrugs. "You heard Obi. I'll make an appearance, let the press know that I do not, in fact, have PTSD, and that I am not going anywhere. That it'll take more than this to make me disappear."
It was honestly pure chance that the Knight Captain and his close circle all found themselves back at their old training grounds, the place having been forgotten during the war. Then it simply became a nightly thing. Sometimes not all of them show up, but there’s never only one person tending the fire. They wordlessly made sure of that.
“Not like I planned it, kid.” He pauses, gaze intent on hers. “How’d the board take to you shutting down the weapon’s division?”
Steve looks away from her reflection to meet her gaze, eyebrow cocked as he continues to smile. “Like this how?”
“Oh, well, thank you.” The doors start to close. “You gonna show me what you’ve been working on while you’ve been keeping low?”
"And we were having such a moment," Toni sighs, not quite successful and in keeping the smile off her face.
I really shouldn’t be writing another fanfic...but it’s 2:53 AM and I don’t make good decisions when I’m sleep deprived soooooo
After leading the gray mare out and closing the stable doors behind them, Steve swings himself up onto Val’s back and gives her neck an affectionate pat. “Ready, big girl?”
Christine shake her head, and the movement finally snaps Toni’s attention back to her. The blonde has a disbelieving smile on her face. “ I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker.”
On the other side of the balcony-turned-barbecue area, Pops was watching Dad with puppy dog eyes as his husband brings yet another stack of Captain America comics
Toni yawns again and only allowed Steve to lead her under the covers of her bed because she’s too lazy to tell him off. “Damn right,” she says as he pulls the blanket up to her chin. Her eyes begin to droop. “And don’t you forget it.”
Steve gives her a look in return as she goes into the kitchen. “You really think you’re not going to get a full security detail from SHIELD? The not-so secret organization your father helped make and currently ran by your aunt?”
“Oh my god,” Steve shakily breathes out, allowing his head to drop back down. He’s no longer hyperventilating but his heart is still racing, so he shifts to sit on the floor before deciding it’s better to lie on his back. He lets his eyes slip shut and focuses on trying to get his heart to return to normal.
“Steve.” Howard’s voice is raspy and tired, slow with each syllable. “I need you to come to the hospital.”
“Toni,” this time, Steve grips her gently around the arms and she steadily ignores the tingles that run up and down her body at the contact, “tomorrow, please. Your dad’s fine. He’ll be more awake and lucid tomorrow. Come on, let’s get you cleaned up and maybe hunt down something to snack on. Did you even eat lunch?”
Steve opens his mouth to say that she’s right, of course she’s right, but she spins on her heel and retreats back down to her workshop, her back ramrod straight and head held high, leaving him to let out another harsh exhale. “Shit. Way to go, Rogers.”
JARVIS doesn’t say anything else and instead starts the fabrication process just as she had asked. Toni smiles before she pushes herself up from her work bench, reaching for her mug of cold coffee before heading over to the kitchenette in the corner of her workshop to fetch the Saltines.
Lady Potts laughs quietly behind a dainty hand. “Sir Carbonell and I simply wanted to see how the preparations are going. And, Sir Carbonell would like to extend his gratitude.”
Steve smiles and makes his way back into the kitchen, rattling off what he thinks he’ll need. “It’s a simple enough dish that I’d be surprised if you’re missing something.”
The next thing Howard knew, short arms were clinging around his neck in an almost suffocating hug. "Thank you, daddy!"
As an adult in her late thirties with a best friend who’s been in the military for the whole of his adult life, Toni understands that it was trauma. The memory of crashing the plane into the ice and ultimately freezing...it was too fresh in his mind.
“Ah.” Steve had thought as much. This has been an issue since the end of the Great Civil War. “Still refusing to come out of hiding and join us mere mortals here in the capital, huh?”
Toni gives into the urge to hug him because there was a time in that cave she left behind that she thought she’d never get to see her scarily competent PA ever again. He’s way too qualified to be Toni’s glorified babysitter, and if she was a decent human being, she’d have found a way to give Pepper a job he deserves. But she’s never claimed to be decent. So she kept him by her side because she’s selfish and knows that starting any type of relationship with Pepper outside of their professional one (and their surprising friendship) could only end in disaster.
Obie was understandably less enthusiastic as her. He was the one dealing with the board after all, and simply saying, “Green energy,” wouldn’t smooth out all the ruffled feathers. So she promised to lay low and leave the board to him. Which worked out great in Toni’s favor.
a traveling circus. So, I have some experience. All this to say, I’m not the only one who thinks this is a little fishy, right?”
Steve regrets it the moment he steps out of the car and walks around amidst the flashing lights to open the driver's door for Toni.
"I was gonna put it back together afterwards," Toni reached for a small steel circle the size of the watch's face with odd pieces soldered unto it and held it up to him, "but I can't figure out how to make more space to fit this."
It's been a week since the Avengers banded back together under the ammended Accords, and Peter still doesn't know how to feel about Pop (it has been two years), but in the moment, he was sympathetic.
Toni woke up with a gasp after flashes of agonizing pain, bloody hands, foreign shouting and ringing in her ears.
In the dim light of the tavern, Steve can just barely make out the red making Tony’s cheeks glow, but it’s unmistakable. It could also just be the ale, though if Steve were to go by the way Tony had suddenly gone fidgety and refused to look at anyone but Rhodes, he highly doubts it.
Stood at the end of the dock to the Stark-Roger’s lake house, Dad and Pops watched each other while Thor (who’s slowly gaining back the muscles he had lost) spoke on about the hardships and trials and eventual rekindling of the two’s love as the officiator of their vow renewals.
Toni stares at the design of Mark One, the memory of donning on its’ pieces still fresh in her mind, Yinsen frantically helping her before eventually giving his life. She manipulated the hologram, tilting open the face plate, removing the bulky chest plate and chunky outer armor, tossing them into the equally holographic trash can.
Toni hates being in a wheelchair, but her Honey Bear gave her one of his patented mother hen looks (one that rivals Steve’s) and she had no option but to sit her butt down. Rhodey wheels her towards the lowering ramps of the C-17 with Steve at his side.
"Oh, really?" Howard chuckled again and helped Toni back up on the bench when she struggled to haul herself up onto it, before perching himself next to her and dutifully looked at the small gears and screws she points out to him and– "Is that...Toni, did you take apart the watch Obie gave to me last Christmas?"
For some reason, Toni finds his words amusing as her lips quirk. “I’ll show you when I get somewhere with it.”
With jerky movements, she reaches out, jostles the table and caused the cup to topple over. She looks to the man again, gauges his non reaction to the racket, before she reaches further towards the jug next to where the cup had been and comes to an abrupt halt when a sharp pain tugged at her chest.
“Captain,” Rhodes says and Steve appropriately shifts his gaze over just as the other man places a hand on Tony’s shoulder. Rhodes meets his eyes gravely. “I know he looks shifty, talks too much, and definitely doesn’t inspire anyone to trust him–”
He looks up just in time to see Peggy turn the corner, so visibly frazzled in a way he’s never seen before. Even when they found out that Hydra was still alive and right under their noses, Peggy was cool and controlled. Right now, however, she was anything but put together. Oh, she was still as beautiful as the day he met her, but the worried purse of her lips and misty eyes said it all.
Shame that he was assigned to the Prince as soon as they got back, so Rhodes had left after the victory celebrations for his new post.
It was a breeze tiptoeing out of the house and into the stables now that Steve had done it so many times over (i.e. since he got back), and because he kept Valkyrie as his steed even after the war, it was even faster getting her all saddled up and ready for another ride into the night.
Rhodey huffs in amusement and sweeps an arm in her direction. "Look who fell out of the sky, Miss Toni Stark."
Captain America doesn’t roll his eyes, so Steve settles on a bland smile. He knows how Toni feels about the spandex. It’s been upgraded, but she will never let him live it down. “Stealth suit. I want your input for some lightweight armor and the design, of course.”
“I saw you once, you know,” the man continues, “at Bern. You were giving a speech about integrated circuits–”
Toni fixes her shirt and gives the reactor a glance. “Destroy it. Incinerate it.” She taps on the new reactor in her chest.
“Miss, might I suggest sleeping?” JARVIS, her AI modeled after the butler himself, chimes in softly. “And maybe consuming something other than coffee?”
It’s a solid inquiry. Toni needs to stand up. “Uh, I- I had my eyes opened!” She walks around to finally stand behind the podium. “I came to realize that I had more to offer this world than just...making things blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacture division–” all hell breaks loose as the reporters stand up in unison and Obie comes around to try and do some damage control, but Toni keeps going, “–of Stark International, until such a time that I can decide what the future of this company will be, what direction it should take, one that I’m comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country as well.”
Toni tries to play it cool, tries to calm down the roaring in her ears as she shakes her head. “I didn’t approve any shipment.”
Especially these days, what with taking care of the Hydra/SHIELD mess. How she had allowed it to fester and grow without ever realizing it will be a burden she will always carry. But she’ll be damned if she didn’t take care of it before the good Lord takes her home.
“I’ll take a vacation once we’ve finish cleaning up Hydra’s mess,” Peggy says with a laugh before ending their call.
Toni starts to smile just as she catches Dummy start to move out of the corner of her eye. She quickly raises an arm out towards him. "No– AH-AH-AH!"
Steve frowns and opens his mouth to speak when the door was opened and Howard stood on the other side, leaning heavily on his walking cane and looking as if death warmed over. However, there was still a spark in his dim eyes. “It’s very convenient timing, if you ask me,” the man says gruffly as he leads them into his office. Obviously, his hearing aids were working just fine.
“Put that on the table over there,” Toni gestures to a metal tray full of tools and gears, “that is irrelevant.”
Toni looks down to her chest and huffs, a wry smile twisting at her lips. Steve doesn’t think there’s anything funny. “They saved me, actually. They needed me alive so they made do with what they had to make sure the shrapnel stays away from my heart.”
Steve has a lot to be thankful for, but he will forever be indebted to His Majesty, for had he not thrown the full support of the crown behind Peggy’s decision, he might have not met her on the battlefield. Sure, maybe he would’ve met her eventually, but he just knows it would not be the same. Their meeting had been fate.
Steve hums and doesn’t stop himself from giving in to the urge to pull her into his arms. Toni makes a surprised sound but she doesn’t protest. Instead, she’s wrapping her arms around Steve’s waist and allows him to bury his face in her unruly hair. He says nothing, but he doesn’t need to. Toni, despite the years they’ve been estranged, understands him anyway.
Toni doesn’t like being handed things, but she closes her fingers around the glossy papers, trying to comprehend the conviction in Christine’s gaze. Then Toni looks down and everything narrows down to the first picture.
The short pause does not escape Steve’s notice, so he sighs heavily and shuts the front door behind him and strides towards his bike. It really shouldn’t surprise him the the AI would be a little cross with him for upsetting its creator. He straddles the seat and lifts his helmet to slip it on before coming to an abrupt halt.
“It is somewhat my business, though,” the young man says, nudging at Rhodes’ side with an elbow and an amused quirk of a dark brow. “They’ll be guarding our caravan after all. If they’re not all that up to the task, then I need to know so I can make adjustments for my own safety.”
She gives him a smile. “You’re eyes are red,” she says upon reaching him, tilting her head back to meet his eyes because Pepper is ridiculously tall. Taller than Steve even, but lanky. “Tears for your long lost boss?”
Steve takes that as his cue to step forward while Rhodey moved aside and waves at the medical crew to hurry up. Steve kneels in front of Toni and takes her hands into his, peering into the abyss that is Toni Stark’s doe eyes. “It’s me, Bambi.”
Until he hears the familiar not-engine sound from earlier followed by a loud crash that has Steve jackknifing from the floor in time to see the suit fall through the ceiling and land on top of the Shelby Cobra, destroying the vehicle beyond repair.
The group starts to chuckle and Rhodey continues to try and do damage control. "Don't do that, don't do that."
Shit. "This..." Toni averts her gaze because this is not how she saw this conversation going, "is not for the military. I'm not...doin'..."
“So, what do you need my great expertise with?” Toni looks down at the screen as Steve turns it towards her, displaying a rough draft of his uniform. Expect the tones are darker, more muted and something Steve’s been mulling over for a while now. “You need fashion advice?”
Toni waves him off, grabbing two bottles of water from the fridge. “Semantics. I don’t need security.”
Steve smiles to himself as Peggy regales Toni with stories of the few new recruits they still trust after the fall of Hydra/SHIELD and the shenanigans they continuously found themselves in. For the rest of lunch, Steve enjoys himself, basking in the sun and the presence of the two women with him. The great food was just a bonus.
Peter didn't witness when Clint got his, but he saw the evidence that he already did when he visits the compound again with the minions in tow to give Laura some well-deserved time off, and Dad greeted him with a hug and a cheek-kiss and the archer didn't even blink, just returned the gesture.
There was static in Peter's ear which he was well acquainted with now to distinguish it as Doctor Strange's sigh and not a fritz in the comm line.
“Yeah.” Natasha replies after a beat. “I wanna see what has them so desperate enough to go digging through shifting sands for whatever it is Toni made.”
She’s all amiable smiles and friendly waves as she steps out, one tanned leg after the other before handing over the keys to a valet. She quickly brushes down the fabric of her black dress, making sure the shimmering skirt settles just right as it flutters around her ankles. Her strappy heels has her head coming up to his chin when she finally straightens up, tucking a matching black clutch between a bicep and her rib while she wraps her other arm around Steve’s.
When there’s not an immediate response, Steve looks away from the shelf of ridiculously expensive booze to Phil’s contemplative face. He’s known the man since he joined SHIELD but Steve’s never been able to fully read Phil. “That bad?” he ventures, apprehensive of the answer.
The sun is hot on Bucky’s back, and underneath all the layers of clothes he had “borrowed” from the unfortunate goon of the Ten Rings, he’s sweating profusely.
(Two weeks after that, Peter walked in on Dad giving Pops a quicks smooch on the lips, eyes never leaving his phone as he was leaving for a business trip to Japan. The smile Pops sends him had Peter giving a thumbs up over Dad's shoulders as he got his own smooch on his temple.)
Steve pauses at the last step of the stairs and looks back up to the second floor of Toni’s Malibu home before answering Peggy, “She seems more distraught over Howard than the fact that she was held in an Afghanistan cave for three months. I don’t know if that makes me feel relieved or more worried.”
“I’m looking into where they could’ve acquired their weapons,” Howard tells them, and Steve has to set his mug down or else he’d crush it. “I have Toni’s assistant and AI looking into it.”
“No, it wasn’t,” Toni replies in a frigid tone, and when Steve returns his gaze to her, she’s glaring a hole into the table, lips pursed and jaw tight. Then she snaps those deep brown eyes back to him and stands. “But I never had anything to prove to you, Steve.”
Toni slowly nods, suddenly weary. “Lunch. Okay...I should get everything done by then. JARVIS, how’s the fabrication–”
Steve doesn’t jump like Potts when Toni gives the reactor one sharp tug that disconnects the wires from her body, but it’s a near thing.
So, she rarely eats anything fast food. When she does, however, Burger King was her go to. And she never shares.
But Pepper’s in the back sitting down as well, murmuring something back to Rhodey who was just as confused as everybody else, and Obie sitting down next to her, a solid warmth that reminded her of summers spent in the garage with Dad and Uncle Obie...and she can do this, because her family’s here. Dad’s probably in one of the private rooms watching the conference. She needs to do this because of her family. To keep them safe. To keep everyone safe. From her. From the things she’s made with her own two hands. She needs to start washing them of the blood of those innocent soldiers with her in that convoy, and all the others before them who died by her weapons.
Peggy slips her arm with Steve’s and explains as they walk, Edwin falling into step on his other side, “Not as much as I want to. We’re still cleaning up Hydra’s mess from last year, so our resources are still limited. Connections we once had in those areas are gone, and a lot of our agents are still hidden.”
He waits for another twenty minutes before finally moving the genius to lay down across the couch. After tucking the blankets firmly around her, Steve packs up his things and leaves Toni to her z’s.
Afraid was the right term because after going even higher, something happens. One of the rockets in Toni’s feet pops and the suit appears to shut down and Steve’s heart drops along with Toni as she begins to free fall back down to earth.
It was logical, Toni thinks later as she stares into the fire back in her “cell” while her fellow prisoner taunts her with words of encouragement as she tries to breath, and wraps the scratchy blanket tighter around her shoulders.
Pants that were too baggy on her legs was pinched up around her waist, a dirty tank top clings to her top like a second skin, and a jacket was wrapped around her head and hung down to her chest in a makeshift covering as her hair whipped around in the wind.
“You know I was naive before, when they said, ‘Here’s the line. We don’t cross it. This is how we do business.’ If we’re double-dealing under the table,” Toni trails off as she watched Obi, her
She looks away as guilt so heavy tugged at her damaged heart. It could’ve easily been Rhodey who was blown up by her weapons. What have she done?
Her breathes came out in harsh, short exhales that she could see in the cold air. A shiver runs through her body as she stares up at a dark ceiling of dirt. There was an orange glow off to her left and a weak flickering of artificial light off to her right. Someone’s whistling, there’s an annoying trickle at the back of her parched throat. Gingerly, she reaches up to her face and chokes when her fingers catch on a tube traveling up one of her nostrils. Suddenly panicked, she pulls on it, gagging and gasping but not stopping until the whole damn thing came out. Who knows what the hell they’ve been feeding her.
“So what’s changed?” Steve grits out, clinging to the roiling rage in his blood, because he doesn’t want to address what’s twisting his insides into literal knots.
In the split second after she pressed the hand control buttons, Toni is airborne before her world tilts upside down, pain explodes across her knees and shoulders, and she’s back down to earth.
Her lips are still chapped and Toni wets them with her tongue before rolling the bottom lip into her mouth, her gaze flittering back down to her lap. She nods. “I know. But...maybe not now?”
Toni wiggles a bit in his arms which he understood as her silent request to be put down which Howard complies to. Once back on her feet, Toni reaches for his hand and tugs him towards the table. "I was making something for you!"
Steve reads some emails, composed a few replies, read up on Nat and Clint’s recent missions, assures Rhodey that everything is fine, before Toni’s excited
It took Dad a while to start giving the "Rogue" Avengers kisses again after the whole Accords debacle.
. Has it really been seventeen years since he first caught wind that the Winter Soldier was one James Buchanan Barnes? And now...
They settle on the old thing, all lumpy yet strangely comfortable and Steve’s pretty sure it’s the same one she had in her dorm at MIT.
They finish the rest of their breakfast in relative silence and Toni helps him with stacking their dishes together for Steve to take back up to the kitchen. She keeps the large mug of coffee with her, though. Steve deposits the plates in the kitchen sink before dashing up the stairs to his room to grab his laptop, notebook, and tablet and heads back down to Toni’s lab as casually as he can. No need to tip Toni off to his “evil” plan to get her to at least take a power nap.
Next to him, General Margaret Elizabeth Carter chuckles under her breath, ruby lips curved into a smile Steve has loved for so long. “No, not really. Just that it’s always precious seeing you watch over your men like this.”
But as he had told Peggy, he has taken an oath, and if he wants to keep the peace, he has to set a good example and be courteous to the Prince else he’d “accidentally” throttle the young man.
Steve raised a hand to wave as he keeps an eye on the duo as they make their way through the crowd and towards the doors.
Toni's own hands shook as she gently takes her father's into both of hers, heart squeezing in pain as she feels just how frail he is. How much of her memories of Howard involve his strong, reliable hand? He never raised it against her, instead using his palm to soothe her whenever sobs wracked her body, his fingers to correct her hold on tools, and his grip to guide her to magical places. It has been a hand that she can always take a hold of and know that her father will be there for her no matter what.
Nobody says anything for a long while. Thor adds more firewood to the fire, Loki turns a page, Bucky pulls a knife out of thin air and begins to flip it around, Sam scribbles on the ground with his confiscated stick, and Hawk resumes to throws more twigs into the fire, never once missing the center.
As it happens with all her projects, Toni easily loses herself in the work, volleying half-formed thoughts and potential solutions with JARVIS via texts and hand gestures. Then her eyes flicker towards the separate screen she has JARVIS playing the news on and gets stuck reading the subtitles.
Sighing, Steve sits up in his too soft bed, slips off the too soft blankets from his legs, and ignores the too soft slippers his manservant has left out for him to use and sets his bare feet on the cold hardwood floor.
Instead, he pretended not to notice how Toni would always stick to him like a magnet whenever he was around and kept on pretending that he wasn’t enabling her crush by caving every time she turned her doe eyes on him.
Toni wiggles a bit in the boots, idly wondering if she made them a bit too big. “We’re gonna start off nice and easy. We’re gonna see if ten percent thrust capacity achieves lift.”
“Planes have wings,” she says to Steve as he’s lifting her from the floor, careful so he doesn’t slip.
“There’s our troublemaker,” Obie laughs bending down to accept Toni’s hug. “You haven’t made working easy these days.”
"Okay, we're good." Toni quickly sets her arms back to her sides and...stabilizes, hovering near-perfectly with minimal struggle even as she does another turnaround.
“Take care of yourself, okay?” he murmured against her skin before he took a deep breath and went back to his bike, this time not sparing another look behind him, using all of his self control when Toni’s wreaked sobs trailed into the night and was drowned by his bike’s engine.
“I’ve made a breakthrough.” Toni joins him in front of the stove and dutifully takes the bowl he hands over to her.
Steve snags another towel up to dry his hair with and speeds out of the room to grab said phone. He only questions why Howard is calling him (and the fact that he’s awake apparently) for a split-second before he’s answering, “Howard?”
“...Looks like some kind of mask,” Natasha finally says. “Cap and Rhodey picked Stark Jr. up not too far from this location...how much do you wanna bet that whatever they’re digging up has to do with Toni?”
Gently, Peggy nudges Toni’s chin up to meet her eyes and the younger woman complied reluctantly. Peggy says, “It’s not your fault, Toni. Your dad and I? We’re old, love, these things happen to us, okay? He’ll get better and when he does, I’ll help you convince him that closing down the weapon’s division was a good move, yeah?”
Steve’s world froze. No. This wasn’t like being in the ice. This was like being in molasses. He could see Nat slowly, so slowly, rise from her crouch in front of Bucky, no doubt seeing the way he had suddenly gone still.
There had been a too soft rug under his too soft bed once, but Steve had it removed else he goes crazy. There is only so much softness a man who’s been on the battlefield for ten years can take.
Steve keeps an eye on Toni out of his peripheral as she reaches into the toaster and plays hot potato with a slice of garlic bread before dunking one end into her stew.
Peter was sweaty and tired. But it was a good tired. It was a testament to a well-spent afternoon testing out the new web shooters with Dad in the lab, and taking it out for a test run in the simulation room.
Her dad had been taken to a hospital where he remains stabilized but unconscious. Toni snuck in during the early hours of the morning, bribing the front desk and spent a good two hours just staring at her father as she held his hand. She hadn’t been able to follow him right away to the hospital due to all the reporters and had instead hidden away in the reactor room, staring up at the behemoth that now say in the middle of her chest.
"Nope." Toni's smile widens as she feels Steve's questioning gaze on the side of her face. "I found this spot by chance when I was looking for a place to build my house. I thought about building it here as soon as I saw the view, but then I saw that cliff, and I couldn't get it out of my head. Everyone who saw it said I couldn't do it, that I wouldn't be able to make it stand for even a year before it collapses into the ocean. But I did it."
The man steps into her office in a flutter of black leather and a straight back. Peggy has long since made the man stop saluting her, but seeing him physically stop himself from doing so despite all these years, still amused her.
Wipping at his neck with a face towel, Peter grins. "S'long as you keep the instant kill mode in there, sure."
They’ve already reached the elevator but instead of pressing the call button, Toni turns around to face Stane. Steve presses the button.
“Toni, the Board has rights, too.” Stane gives her a pointed look. “They’re making a case that you and your new direction isn’t in the company’s best interest.”
He got the message, but he really did not want to talk to Howard right now. Not after years of no-contact. Even when they pass by each other in SHIELD hallways, not one word is exchanged between them. Right now, riding the high of finding Bucky, yet exhausted to the core, Steve didn’t feel like getting into another screaming match with Howard, since the last one they had resulted in slammed doors and Steve leaving the Stark mansion in the dust of his motorbike.
The "usual table" was out back in a small garden, cordoned off by a tall hedge of creeping vines that kept the outside world away while allowing the sun to shine down upon them. Peggy was sitting under a beige umbrella, daintily sipping at a glass of something as she reads a book. She looks up upon their approach and smiles, closing her book before she stands and holds out her arms. Toni slips her glasses up into her hair and Steve drops his hand from the small of her back as she steps into Peggy's embrace. He turns to the hostess while they hugged and asks for two glasses of ice-cold water and a bowl of any fruit appetizers they had. Your choice, he told her with a wink before turning back to the other two women. He helps Peggy back into her seat first, with Toni keeping hold of her aunt's hand before he turns to Toni and pulls out her chair.
Pepper was obviously taken back by her sudden show of affection, but it took him only half a second to react, his own arms wrapping around her body fiercely. Though he’s still very gentle with his touch. Pepper’s awesome.
Howard shifts forward in his seat and types something into his laptop. “You’ll meet with him tomorrow as soon as you touch down in Afghanistan. I have a plane ready for you as soon as you’re ready to go.”
-” A sharp buzz comes from the heart monitor and Toni’s body jerks as Potts panics and Steve feels his shoulders go stiff. But then everything returns to normal with Potts apologizing profusely as Toni says, “Sides, that’s what I was trying to tell you earlier.”
He slowly takes off his gloves and places a hand over her knee. Her eyes flicker to him and finally focuses on his face. “I’m sorry,” he says, “I didn’t realize it was that bad. Have you had a doctor look at it, at least?”
The side-eye glare Steve sends her is quite impressive and tells her that Steve is not at all in a mood. Toni couldn’t find it in herself to be defiant.
"Thanks," she replies under her breath, refusing to watch as he leaves her standing in the middle of the hanger, an empty pit forming in her stomach.
Toni doesn't answer, slipping behind the wheel instead and Steve scrambled back into the passenger's seat as she starts up the engine. She had slipped a pair of aviators on and mutters, "Just peachy, Cap," before peeling out of the Air Force parking lot like the hounds of hell were nipping at the tires of her sports car.
Howard hands him the tablet. “These...are the shipping manifestos over the last...thirty years of every Stark weapon that has ever been made. At first glance it looks correct. In fact, it is. However, upon a much, much closer look, well. Once I found the pattern, it was easier to find and identify.”
The question, though delivered innocently and with nothing but child-appropriate curiosity, stabbed at Howard's heart. Jarvis and Ana already gave him enough scathing glares everytime he left for another expedition to last him a lifetime. Still, he tried to smile at Toni as he answered, "I don't know, pumpkin."
“Right,” Steve says before he turns her around by her shoulders and starts nudging her towards the stairs. “To bed with you, Stark.”
A man Rhodes holds in high regard and is fond of, who seems to be brimming with confidence, can apparently hold his own in a war, and who’s obviously uncomfortable with compliments...Tony Jarvis.
“Thor, we really need you to settle which one of us is your favorite archer,” Bucky interrupts what they all knew would no doubt turn into another infamous Odinson’s Brothers one-sided bickering because Thor was too straight forward, and Loki too used at dancing with his words.
"Want to fiddle around with some upgrades for Karen next, kiddo?" Dad asked as they step out of the elevater and unto the common floor. He had stripped out of his track suit's jacket and had tied it around his waist, leaving him in a black tank and the nanite housing.
Toni shakes her head. “No. No doctors. I can’t trust them not to spill no matter how many NDAs we make them sign. I can’t risk the public, or God forbid, all the others who want me dead to know. Plus, it’s stable and the infection is expected. It’s easily combatable.”
A few beats of silence goes by where they just stare at each other, gauging each other. Toni knows how this game goes, and so does Christine. “You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction?”
And Steve's too if she's to go by the man's impressed whistle. The sky is vibrant, the clouds white and fluffy, and the waters crashing below them is a gradient of blue to green as far as the eye can see. Toni will hate herself later when she's scrubbing the smell of salty air out of her hair, but that's for future Toni to deal with.
Seventeen years ago, Steve had stormed into the Stark mansion and had a screaming match with Howard about his weapons because Steve just got back from a mission that went FUBAR involving Stark weapons that wasn’t theirs. The argument spiraled out of control after that and with a warning to Howard (“One day this’ll blow up in your face, Stark, if you don’t do something!”), Steve stomped out of the other man’s office and almost barreled right through Toni. She had been nineteen then and already shadowing Howard as she prepared to take over Stark International. It rubbed Steve in the wrong way possible in that moment. The little girl he watched grow up was soon going to start leading a weapons company and he hated it.
Steve watches with mild horror and a lot of concern as Tony’s coughing fit transitions into a full-belly laugh, ale running down his chin. “Oh, my gods!” he cries gleefully. “I can see that! I can clearly see it! She would!”
Across the sea in a small Italian cottage overlooking a clear, quiet beach, a Stark phone buzzes with a message on the bedside table. It’s drowned out by the sound sighs, shared soft kisses, heady groans, choked off moans and the slapping of skin against skin.
Steve paused, memories of watching over Toni’s slender shoulder as she typed and drowned in coffee coming into the forefront of his mind before he shut them down and says, “Right. And the search party?”
He comes back to Toni’s home a few hours later and is surprised to find Virgil “Pepper” Potts sitting in the living room tapping away at a tablet as some loud mouthed man rages on the TV about Stark Industries no longer making weapons.
There’s a brief pause before the AI says, “No, Captain. Though, not for a lack of trying. Would you please bring her down some breakfast when you get back?”
Howard was perched on a barstool next to her, eating his own cookie with a mug of coffee and a pile of unopen mail that he doubted he'd be able to make a dent in even if he had all afternoon to look through it.
There are only a handful of things that can make Steve Rogers speechless, and he can count them all on one hand with fingers left to spare. A glowing blue orb in the middle of Toni’s chest is something he can add to that count, it would seem. She’s sitting on the bed, eyes gaunt, cheeks ruddy from sunburn, legs, all scratched and bruised, dangling on the side and dressed in a backwards hospital gown that affectively left her sternum exposed; a very scarred and infected sternum. Maybe under normal circumstances Steve would’ve been embarrassed to see the edges of Toni’s breast, but he was so fixed on the mangled mess of her chest that he couldn’t really find a rats ass to give.
Toni smiles. Her pride and joy sticking out the side of the cliff in a big middle finger to everyone who said she couldn't do it.
And with that, Rhodes ventures through the crowds to get to the bar, leaving his...friend to gape after his back.
"I understand, but I need you to trust me, Pep. This is–" Toni shakes her head, looking out past the pool and at the darkening skies. "This is wildly different from anything I've ever done before and I need you, I
“Captain,” JARVIS says, low enough that it isn’t too much for his ears, but not too low that he can ignore it. This is Steve’s own fault.
"No, what you need," Rhodey says, enunciating her words like he was talking to a five-year-old, and it stings, "is time to get your mind right."
They stop outside a heavy, mahogany door Steve hasn’t seen in ages, and Peggy curves her red lips up at him, “We’re not completely blind. She was taken by a group called Ten Rings. We have plenty of reason to think they’re affiliated with Hydra.”
Rhodey is smiling, nodding along like she knew he would because this is Rhodey, of course, he would get it. "We about to make a whole lot of people around here real happy-"
Even after he and Howard had their fight and he stormed out of the mansion (out of her life, tearing her heart in two and bringing all the pieces with him) like the hounds of hell were nipping at his heels.
Steve watches as a short man, dressed in scholarly clothes, beard white as snow to match his shoulder-length hair, and glasses so thick he couldn’t even make their eyes, shuffled through the crowd and stands before Steve.
“Woah, woah!” Steve halts her progress by stepping in front of her, hands up by his shoulders. “Visiting hours will be over by the time you get there, and when I left, Howard was sleeping. You can go tomorrow.”
"Careful!" He warned as Toni slid down from the bench, rucking the skirt of her flowery dress in the process. Howard winced at the sound of tearing cloth. Ana will not be happy. But his little girl didn't seem to notice as she dashed towards him, arms akimbo. He stopped in his steps to bend down and scoop her up into his arms with a small grunt. He wasn't getting younger and Toni was getting bigger by the day. "Have you been down here all morning?"
"Yup!" Toni replied proudly with a huge grin, showing off the small gap between her front teeth and completely unaware of the panic that has arrested the Stark household since her "disappearance."
“I saw young Americans killed...by the very weapons I built to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I...” she takes a breath, “had become part of a system the is comfortable with zero accountability.”
Steve makes quick eye contact with the other man over Toni’s head as she slots her arm through his again. Something passes across Stane’s face but it’s too quick for Steve to read so Steve nods a silent greeting instead and brushes it off as Stane’s general dislike for Steve. There really is no love lost between them.
Much later, after talking with Obadiah and going through papers for Stark Industries while trying to work out a rough timeline for his next expedition, Howard whisks Toni away from the Jarvises, an idea blooming in the back of his head.
Steve isn’t sure how he feels about that. But he nods because it’s Peggy whose calling the shots. “Alright.”
“I just don’t want this winding up in the wrong hands...” she spins the stripped blue print. “Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good.”
Tony makes quick work of polishing off the rest of his ale. He slams the tankard down on the table and hastily rises to his feet, saying, “Yes, well, it was good meeting you Captain, and present company. I’ll see you next week. Rhodey you were right, the ale is good here, now let’s go! So much to do, so little time.”
The hologram of the new reactor blueprints floated in front of her in doubles and Toni knows it wasn’t supposed to do that.
Peggy sighs again, sitting up straight once more before she shakes her head, “You know very well I can’t answer that, Barton. Our not-spymaster doesn’t believe in keeping in touch whenever she does these sorts of things. So whether the King had ordered her to find out where our missing Lords and Chancellors had holed away themselves, or something else entirely, I cannot say.”
It wasn’t until Steve chose a random key from the motorcycle options hanging on the wall that Howard finally spoke. “After you get Toni back,” he says, “let’s talk.”
She still couldn’t get the look of frantic fear in Steve’s eyes when she finally lifted herself from the wreckage of her landing out of her head. The image is at the forefront of her mind as if it had frozen there. When the as the last time she saw him like this? There’s a fuzzy memory from way back when he first came out of the ice, but not since.
The sand shifts under his feet as he digs, seamlessly blending in with the others around him. In his ear, Natasha’s voice is clear. “We have some activity.”
Toni’s vain, ask any of the tabloids that dedicate pages to her vanity. Too bad for them, Toni is human enough to admit to it. She likes being fit, she likes looking good, and she likes that people find her attractive because of those factors.
“The future of air combat. Is it manned, or unmanned? I'll tell you, in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot's instinct, his insight, that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious and discern its outcome, or a pilot's judgment.”
"What I don't get," Clint's voice sounds in his ear, "is why Cap gets babysitting duties while we go on a recon mission?"
"I don't know, sweetheart, should he?" Dad asked with a saccharine smile as he retrieved a popsicle from the freezer.
"Is there something...familiar about that dummy, Tony?" Pops asks with a constipated look twisting at his mouth as he braces his hands on his hips.
He steps forward, hand out to reach (Toni, her shoulders, anything to assure him that she’s breathing– alive–), stops and swallows the sudden knot in his throat. “What did they do to you?” the horror was clear in his voice and he couldn’t look away.
Stane clears his throat with an uncomfortable grimace. “The Board,” he continues softly, “is claiming a Post-Traumatic Stress, they’re filing an injunction.”
The landline rang just as Toni opened her mouth to ask yet another question, and Howard thanked whatever diety was out there for the interruption. He loves his daughter, truly, but sometimes, it's just hard talking to her, because even after five years, Maria's ghost still hovered over Toni with her beautiful smile and doe eyes.
He showered Peter in them since day one, and those who got them were honorary Starks. Like Uncle Rhodey, and Aunt Pep, or Happy. Then the Avengers happened and he saw Bruce get one, then Natasha, then Clint, then Thor (which the God of Thunder took as an invitation to just sweep Dad up into a kiss everytime he felt like it) and finally Cap (because he was still Cap back then and not Pops).
A knock echoes in her silent office and Peggy checks the time. Fury, then. She had asked JACOSTA (Toni’s gift to SHIELD after they discovered Hydra) to alert Fury that she wanted to speak with him as soon as he arrived. She had gone ahead of him yesterday to their California base to get a head start on things.
“Good, good.” King Howard nods, shares a look with his wife, the says, “I’m glad you think so, Captain. Very glad, because you’ll not only be able to see the results of Sir Carbonell’s mission, you’ll be able to see it happen first hand.”
“Remove it?” Toni’s brows twitched up as a laugh, broken and dark, leaves her lips. A travesty of her actual laugh. Steve hates it. She reaches up to tug at the hospital gown’s neck and her eyes are wild when she stares at him, then through him. “There’s no removing this, Steve. The moment you take this out, I die! Sure, maybe not immediately, but definitely before the doctor’s can get to the shrapnel. It’ll be a slow, torturous death, and I’ve had enough torture for the past three months so I think I’ll pass on
"You're in trouble, little girl," he called out and had to stop himself from laughing when said little girl jumped in shock.
Potts grimaced. “Not any more than what we’re already dealing with, thank god. It was getting too much really, so I decided I’d get more work done here.”
Toni wants to laugh, so she does, but it probably came out as an ugly huff if she’s to go by the concerned furrow of Steve’s brow. Right. She needs a nap. She shakes her head. “Yeah. Maybe just a little tired.”
"Okay." She turns around at Dummy's whirring behind her and finds the bot raising his extinguisher. "Please don't follow me around with it either 'cuz I feel like I'm gonna catch on fire spontaneously."
“Thanks, Phil.” Steve has enough sense not to rush through the crowd, but he avoids eye contact and mutters apologies under his breath when he has to step around or nudge a person aside.
This time, she lifts over four feet into the air and before Toni could stop it, she begins to swing around the open space in a small circle that turns her back to U before she starts going backward. Toni grits her teeth and forces herself to not panic too much as she hovers across the floor, swiveling her head around to keep track of her surroundings. But then she starts heading for the cars.
"Wanda's gotten one! And she's a late comer, too! Hell, the Vision gets one every morning! You playing favorites, Stark?"
Stane flicks a look in his direction but isn’t given the opportunity to answer as Toni says, “We knew the stocks dipped forty points, we knew that was gonna happen.”
“I think it’s a great first step, Your Majesty. I look forward to the fruits of Sir Carbonell’s endeavor.”
“I’m trying to turn this thing around but you gotta give me something. Something to pitch ‘em.” And  Stane says. Then he points toward Toni’s chest where Steve knows the reactor is hidden safely under her clothes. “Let me have the engineers analyze that. You know, drop some specs–”
Steve immediately feels a stab of guilt and he exhaled harshly, shutting his eyes. “I’m sorry,” he says, “that was unfair of me.”
“So when the going gets tough you just run away? What happened to being Captain America and jumping out of planes without a parachute?”
“Wouldn’t dream of it!” Toni laughs over her shoulder as Steve steers he back down the carpet towards the entrance.
Toni sniffs, laugh watery as she says, “I’m not. Allergies from all these damn flowers in here. Why’d you have to go and get a heart attack like that, dad?”
His legs suddenly feel like jelly so he turns and drops himself into the co-pilot seat. Clint gives him cursory glance, but goes back to watching the jet’s controls. “What do you know?”
“My dream died the day I found out you cuss more than the director, you know?” Phil says, completely straight-faced before he points towards the far balcony. “They went that way. Potts wanted some air. I think he panicked.”
“I’ve run out of words to describe normalcy on the third night, didn’t you notice?” Hawk flicks another twig at the fire, making it arc high in the air before landing perfectly in the middle. The fire crackles and pops, sending embers swirling into the sky.
“I do still call you Stevie,” Bucky points at him. “I refuse to call you Captain unless we’re in front of His Majesty.”
Peggy takes a deep breath. “I apologize, that was uncalled for. But, you also should know better by now, Hawk. I make no excuses for Anthony, but that child has been through a lot in his own way, and I would appreciate it if His King’s Knights would not alienate him on his first day back in the capital.”
"It's supposed to light up the numbers and clock hands," she explained, already reassembling the watch. The small screw drivers were just the right fit for Toni's hands.
Steve loses track of time as he sat on his bike, eying the horizon and letting his mind wander as the sun went on its merry way, painting the sky in orange and yellows as it went down and made way for the stars and moon to fill the its spot. Then Steve’s ears picked up on a rumbling sound, not quite an engine and unlike anything he’s ever heard before coming up the driveway that went down into Toni’s workshop. In a blink of an eye, something fast and silver shoots out and up into the sky, making Steve hop off his bike and stare after it with a gaping mouth.
Despite the gelatinous liquid dripping from his quivering hands, Potts was looking down at Toni with such tenderness Steve felt like a Peeping Tom from witnessing such a moment.
Reporters from every media branch crowded around the podium, watching every one of Toni’s movements, hands ready to take notes, recorders rolling and camera’s zooming close. Toni ignores it all and lowers herself to the steps leading up to the podium while Obie started the press meeting. He trails off when he realizes Toni wasn’t standing next to him.
King Howard watches them with amusement. “Captain, with our new lands, there is a lot we must do. You know this very well.”
She makes it to the dining table without any incident and Steve joins her after fixing his own bowl and brings the rest of the garlic bread with him, sliding into the chair across from Toni.
He hands over her tray of food, making sure she’s all settled before turning to his own to dig in. There’s silence as they eat and Steve is half-way through his eggs when he realized this. It’s silent. It was silent when he walked in, too. His gaze snaps over to the boot that DUM-E was prodding at then swallows the bite in his mouth. “What are you working on?”
As a ten-year-old, Toni didn’t understand the way Steve’s face twitched while his eyes went distant and he quietly thanked her for the offer but declined.
“Right. He just so happened to have a heart attack after I announced that I’m shutting down the biggest money making part of our company.”
is right because they didn't see what I saw out there and I won't have any more blood on my hands. This will not be the Stark legacy."
Howard’s face had slowly morphed into an unreadable mask during her tirade and had now settled into carefully blank though his gaze is troubled. By what, Toni can’t say for sure and she’s woman enough to admit to herself that it’s a little terrifying. She never liked it when she couldn’t tell what Howard was thinking.
She hums before flicking her glasses back down, just as the valet drives their ride up to them. “I’m glad.”
With a heavy sigh, Steve reached into the third pouch of his utility belt, and pulls out his SHIELD issued Stark phone, lets it ring one more time before answering.
“Where are we?” Toni asked after her eyes roam around the crude room they were being held captive in.
Rhodey shuffles a bit to make space for him, but doesn’t let go of Toni’s hands. Instead, he drops a kiss to her knuckles and keeps his lips pressed there while Steve joined him on the floor. Toni stares at her lap, anguish twisting at her beautiful face, and Steve feels a little guilty for the relief that floods him because at least her face was no longer blank; no longer neutral as if she had nothing left in her.
“Emphasis on the annoying,” Rhodes adds. “I’m grabbing us a drink. Captain, can you watch this little hellion for a moment? I don’t trust him not to cause more trouble.”
“You’ve really gotten better at cooking,” Toni says after a while of silence. She’s nearly finished with her bowl. “You used to be such a disaster in the kitchen.”
This is how Steve finds her, hours, maybe just minutes later. Toni wasn’t really paying attention as  all her brain power was entirely focused on different ways she can help stabilize herself in the air.
Three hours later, she woke up, groggy and with a headache. Steve was a saint because he had coffee brewing and he handed over her favorite large mug full of glorious caffeine with only a little frown of disapproval. So they spent the rest of the afternoon in her kitchen as Toni checked some emails, glared at Rhodey’s contact on her phone, called the hospital to check up on her dad, and touched bases with Pepper over a video call, all the while Steve puttered around, tapping away at a laptop at times or putting something together to snack on that he pushed in Toni’s direction.
It took Dad a month to replace his right arm, retrofitting his nanobots to act as a prosthetic, and while Doctor Cho did her best for Dad’s face, there were still obvious signs of the scars the infinity stones left on his face.
“Why would they?” Hawk scoffs. “He brought a lot of disgrace to the Royal Family. I wouldn’t want to see his face either.”
Toni nearly snorts into her scotch. “Fuck. Warn a girl next time. You can’t say shit like that when I have a drink in my hand.”
“Neither I from you,” Steve tells her easily. He couldn’t even think about hiding anything from Peggy. “So, what else is there that has your shoulders still so tense?”
Lady Potts smiles pleasantly and turns back to Steve. “Captain, I have asked Cook to prepare food for you and your men, so please stop by the kitchens for lunch.”
Stane says, “Who do you think locked you Starks out? I’m the one who filed an injunction against you...It’s the only way I could protect you.”
“Recovering back in New York. Jarvis said he’s already threatened to fire him a dozen times for making sure he keeps to the doctor’s orders of bed rest.”
However, this was the first team barbecue since the Avengers banded back together, and Dad...well, Dad's still riding the petty train and Pops is in full-on brood mood. He's growing out the beard again.
Bucky looks up from strapping on his gloves at Natasha who directs the question to the room at large. She's standing opposite the bench he sat on of the military plane Fury had found for them (apparently, the Quinjets don't take too kindly to sand in her turbines), checking her weapons.
“Right.” Toni finally says, and without taking her eyes off of Potts, gives her glass to Steve and pats Phil on the shoulder. “Well, you gentlemen talk whatever it is SHIELD agents talk about and I’m gonna go talk to my assistant about...something.”
“Just tinkering with an idea,” Toni says, and out of his peripheral he watched her twirl her fork in the air. There’s bags under her eyes, but there’s a spark in her gaze, a clearness that’s never present when she’s just tinkering. If the lack of music wasn’t already proof that this—whatever it is—is something big, then
Steve nods and returns to his job as the two nobles begin to walk down the length of the multiple carts lined up along the side of one of the many warehouses of the castle.
A patented Captain America Is Mildly Disappointed In You sigh makes Steve’s ridiculous upper body slump forward, before he’s looking back into her eyes with his equally as ridiculous bright blue eyes and says, “Alright. Come on. Get this stuff off of you then it’s straight to the bathroom. Why did DUM-E spray you, anyway?”
“Let’s take a picture,” Stane says instead, arm wrapping around her waist. It feels too much like a snake coiling about its prey but Toni insured it, stone-face as she dutifully faces the camera. Her arm is on auto-pilot as she settles it between Stane’s shoulder blades. “C’mon, picture time.”
Toni smiles, shaking hands with a couple of the guys in front before saying, "Speaking about manned or unmanned, you gotta get him to tell you about when he guessed wrong in spring break. Just remember that, spring break-" out of the corner of her eye he could see Rhodey shaking his head with a rueful smile, "-nineteen eighty-seven. That lovely lady you woke up to-"
“Just wanted to say to take care of yourself.” Steve braces an arm over the car’s roof, effectively blocking the sun with his ridiculous shoulders. “And next time, do ride with Rhodey.”
Toni takes one last mental check of everything, taking in a fortifying breath. She really doesn't want to get flung at another wall. "In three, two, one."
Toni  snorts. “Glad to see your poker face is still shit, Steve. Don’t treat me with the kid gloves now. What else to you want to say?”
Steve has seen and been around Toni’s workshop back in New York over the years and to see her workshop now is no less awe inspiring. It’s all sleek angles and organized chaos of an engineer. In the middle of it all, Toni sat on an inclined chair, wearing shirt with a cut so low it showed off the reactor in her chest and the wires taped just below her collarbones hooked up to a heart monitor. Potts typed in a code on a holographic screen next to the door.
This must’ve been the wrong thing to say because Toni’s face hardens, frustration bleeding through her words as she says, “I’m being responsible! That’s the new direction. For me– For the company.”
Sighing, she slumps against him, all traces of the General gone as her head leans against his neck. Once upon a time, this had flustered Steve, turning his face into a poor imitation of a ripe tomato, but all manner of propriety had been thrown out the window on the battlefield. These days, they have to worry about how close they are in each other’s company.
He doesn’t really get a chance to reply as she was already walking around to the drivers side and thanks the valet for his services. Steve let’s himself back into the passenger’s side and they were once again speeding back down the road and towards Toni’s home.
Next to him, Morgan, his little sister (because he has one now, holy shit, he’s an older brother, he shouldn’t be crying next to his little sister!) squeezes his hand in comfort. He looks down to her and finds the five year old watching him with concern.
Over the last three months of Toni’s disappearance, Steve had gotten to know JARVIS over Stark Pads that Pepper Potts made sure they always had as they searched the desert for the inventor. For a moment, his worry for Toni was overshadowed by his pride for her. He was there when she was still theorizing about AIs, filling the notebook he brought back from Paris as a souvenir for her with lines of code, formulas, and other notes that Steve knew many would love to get their hands on.
SHIELD doctors) were looking him over and assessing just how much damage Hydra had done to him and how they could undo it. The prognosis wasn’t very enthusiastic and they suggested that Steve keep his contact with Bucky to a very minimum. At least until he’s recovered enough.
So he swung his leg off his bike, closed the short distance between them and shucked off his jacket to wrap it around her trembling shoulders. He never intended to hurt Toni, the thought never even crossed his mind. But he needed to leave.
“About as bad as you can expect,” the older man sighs, just as the sounds of heels in marble reaches Steve’s ears.
Howard Stark hobbled forward to meet her as Rhodey and Steve assists her off the ramp, where she immediately pulls a face at the stretcher being wheeled her way. Steve was quick to catch on and politely waves it away.
Toni hums and accepts the tablet Steve hands her along with the stylus, the drawing app already open. She stared at his draft for a minute longer before she starts to sketch. Steve patiently waits for thirty minutes as she flicks the stylus over the screen, long strokes, then shorter ones, before settling the folded blanket that he found by the foot of the couch earlier around her shoulders. JARVIS helpfully turns down the temperature and kicks the AC into gear. Toni’s eyes are at half-mast not long after, and Steve is confident enough that she’ll fall asleep within the next couple of minutes that he goes back to his own work.
Toni looks down to her chest. “Was. It’s an antique now and I need your help to instal this new one. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. Just ran into a little speed bump.”
That was how Obie found her and that was how Toni showed him how she intends to guide Stark International from then on. The reactor works and that had just opened so many doors for her and the company. Green energy was the way to go.
Peggy’s eyes are sharp as Nat’s blades as they cut from the blades to the archer. “Watch your tone, Hawk. I am aware of the stories surrounding the Crown Prince, and while I am not his keeper, he is still my family and I will not have you repeating
“What–” Steve abandons that train of thought and runs toward the driveway. The door remained open so Steve hurried down. “Toni?! What was that?! Toni?!”
Steve sits in the uncomfortable hospital chair across from the door to Howard’s room, foot tapping against the floor to the music he had playing in one ear while he stares down at the book in his hands, half of his mind absorbing the letters as the other half catalogs every little sound and scent in the hallway.
Pepper is waiting for her beyond the edge of the plane’s ramp, standing tall beside her father who’s leaning heavily against his walking cane. Behind them, Happy and Jarvis were waiting by their respective cars.
"Of course," Pepper chuckles, giving her hands a squeeze before pulling back. "Now, I need your signatures for these documents."
The lead man in the group steps forward, and holds out his arms in a travesty of a warm welcome. He speaks, jovial tones filling the silence, and when he finishes, he gestured to the man next to her who hesitates and translates, “He said,
Then the explosion happened. It was big and pinged clearly on radar. Rhodey was on radio in an instant and Steve agreed to check it out before the words were even out of the other man’s mouth.
The fire extinguisher droops with the bot but Toni pays him no heed, shifting a bit in the boots to get more comfortable. She's nervous, her hands are shaking, but she's also excited. Back in the cave, there was no room for such luxuries as it was a matter of life and death. But here, back in her home, she can let herself be that four-year-old who excitedly ran up to dad with the circuit board she just finished putting together.
“JARVIS, where’s Toni?!” Steve quickly asks, heart pounding in his ears. He wasn’t so out of it that someone snuck past him, right?
They were in the middle of figuring out how to fit a solar panel in the watch without risking its aesthetic when Howard brings it up to her.
He moves away to reach for something and continues, “Here, want to see?” He holds a small, glass bottle up and shakes it’s contents. “I have a souvenir. Take a look.”
“No but seriously, why are you here?” Toni asks after taking a proper sip of her drink. Steve keeps an ear in the conversation as he looks around to see if he could flag down one of the servers carrying around little finger sandwiches.
She had followed him after he steadied her, her steps hurried as she tried to keep up with Steve’s infuriated march, talking a mile a minute, and though Steve wasn’t listening, he could tell she was trying to get him to calm down. But nothing anyone could’ve said then would’ve calmed him down, so he kept on marching until he bursted through the front double doors and quickly got on his bike.
“I don’t really trust a lot of people right now, Pep. So when it comes down to it, you’re the one I’m gonna go to...and I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
“Colonel,” she interrupts just as he’s about to continue, approaching the group. “Why not a pilot without a plane?”
“I mean me on the company’s behalf–” She looks to Potts and sees the frown on his face, “–being responsible for the way that– wow, this is great.”
Toni spots Stane just a few seconds after Steve and she taps his arm. Steve appropriately slows down so Toni could give her greetings to the man. She easily cuts in through the conversation Stane is having with a gaggle of reporters saying something about having a great quarter or something.
Bucky carefully eyes the man running towards where Raza, previously thought dead, stood, and handed something over to him.
(Don't let her professional mask fool you into thinking she isn't being petty to Pops in her own way.)
“Of course you are,” he says in the way that borders on placating and judging. “You’re Toni-fucking-Stark.”
Now Steve’s really confused. Rhodey is the second most protective person of Toni, Steve wouldn’t be surprised if Rhodey pulled all of the best doctors on base just to check on her. There’s something fishy going on and Steve wasn’t about to let it go.
Instead of answering, JARVIS opens a hologram in front of him and displays a satellite feed of…a silver suit of armor flying through the night sky. Steve doesn’t bother picking his jaw up from the floor as the suit, no, Toni, rockets past the Santa Monica pier and over the building before she shoot straight up, higher and higher. “JARVIS, what is she doing?”
Dazed by the sudden request/order, Toni can’t do much but nod, really. Not that she’ll deny it anyway because she had already done it. The Ten Rings are dead, Yinsen took the blueprints to his grave, and she hadn’t let any of the doctors see her. When she got back, she had JARVIS clear the web of any pictures that has been taken of her upon her return that may have even hinted at the reactor in her chest.
Just then, an eye-hole in the metal doors slid open and a man shouts from the other side in a language Toni couldn’t understand. Her fellow (presumably) captive dropped his ladle and rushes over to Toni and harshly says, “Come on. Stand up. Stand up! Just do as I do.”
“Alas, shield brother, you ask of me the impossible,” Thor replies, the usual beginning to his usual speech whenever Bucky or Hawk brings the subject up.
Steve Rogers stood outside her front door, hands stuffed in the pockets of his jeans, and looking for all the world like a H&M model with a blue shirt two sizes too small stretched dangerously across his broad chest, a leather jacket tucked in the crook of one arm and a pair of aviator glasses pushed carelessly into his blond head of hair.
Startled, Steve whips around to find an unfamiliar young man standing over him, smiling, mischievous blue eyes watching him from under a fringe of black curls with amusement.
“Ah.” Steve recalls the surprised look she throws his way when Peggy has casually mentioned calling in to check on their friend. “Yeah. Sorry, it slipped my mind. We got the news that you were taken right after we found him.”
Howard ruffles Toni's wild, brown curls with a fond smile before looking at his work table. "What were you doing down here anyway?"
“Ah, forgive me, Captain,” Tony sighs after a moment as his laughter dies down, wiping at the corners of his eyes. “I have had the immense pleasure to meet the General a couple of times. But please, your answer–
Then he got a call from SHIELD right as they finished cleaning up the kitchen and Toni shooed him away to his temporary room. He gave her an apologetic smile and a quick forehead kiss before dashing up the stairs with his laptop, taking two steps at a time.
Steve stops himself from smiling because that was such a Toni-thing to say and he hopes—prays, really to a God he’s not so sure he believes in anymore—that his Toni was still somewhere in this new woman that sat before him, forged in the fires of war that he never wished for her to see.
Toni breathes, realizes she couldn’t take a full breath, stares at the black and white picture of the weapon she built meant to save the lives of American troops, not take them, and thinks back on the soldiers who had already died trying to keep her alive, pictures a world where her weapons were in the wrong hands...
Steve gently shakes his head, unable to hide his grin as he says, “It’s quite alright, Lady Potts. One of my men had temporarily lost his hearing for a while so we all had to learn the Signs to communicate with him.”
“I’d like to open up a new project file indexes as mark two,” she continues, mind fully back into work mode. Rhodey’s rejection still stings, but she has to do this no matter what. She pulls up the digital blue prints of Mark One and, with a guide pen, leads it over to the hologram table.
Potts opens his mouth to reply when another tablet that was propped on the coffee table chirps and a picture of Toni looking all professional pops up on the screen. Potts quickly swipes at its screen and Toni’s voice filters through, “Pepper, how small are your hands? Never mind, that was a stupid question. I need you down here.”
And that was the last thing Steve says to her as the medical crew bundled Toni up and whisked her into Rhodey’s helo. Steve waves them off from the ground before turning to his crew. Their newfound enthusiasm that stemmed from finding Toni was palpable and Steve intends to use it. “Alright,” he claps to draw their attention. “Let’s go check out that explosion sight. That’s no doubt where Stark was held hostage, so I want to see the place for myself.”
“Oh hey, Steve!” Toni gives him a little wave and only then did Steve notice that she was holding what appeared to be another arc reactor.
The thrusters engage and Toni finds herself a good foot in the air. Toni barely stops herself from exclaiming in triumph, focusing instead of balancing herself as best as she could with the hand repulsors. She looks to U's camera, then around the 'shop, not quite shaking the surrealness of the moment as her heart pounds loudly in her ears. Finally, after a few more seconds, she cuts the powers and lands on her feet with a metallic thunk, nearly losing her balance.
Mindful of the wires attached to the arc reactor, Toni carefully twists to flip a switch at the back of her hips, eliciting mechanical hum as her equipment came to life. “Okay. Activate hand controls.”
“Turns out, the only thing that can blast through a Stark vest, is Stark made material.” Toni shrugs as if everything is fine and dandy despite the shadows behind her gaze telling him otherwise. This is not the same Toni anymore. And really, how could he expect her to be?
“In public, the press, Toni.” Stane wraps an arm around Toni’s shoulders while Steve stops the urge to scoff.
When Toni doesn’t immediately squawk indignantly, Steve looks up from where he’s tearing a slice of garlic bread in half to see the woman watching him with furrowed brows and a look in her eyes that Steve had seen many times before on TV.
"There's a party I wanna go to." Toni stands, stretching out her back and neck. "If you don't have a suit I can have Cherry, my stylist, drive one over. Just gotta have JARVIS give her your measurements."
So I stumbled across this manga called Barbarities and one of the main characters reminded me so much of Tony is terms of character design. There was a short secret identity plot in the first chapter, but that was enough to get my brain going and before I knew it, this happened...
with His Majesty to leave the capital when moral has been steadily rising since their Highnesses return. It’s like they want the people to be as miserable as they are. Oh, what I would do to get my hands around Lord Stane’s greasy neck and just shake him until something clicks in that empty sphere he calls a head! But as it were, they still refuse to tell us where they had gone into hiding!”
Steve tries not to glare too hard at the not-young man and grumpily makes his way around to the open seat next to Hawk.
Toni's little head snapped up so quickly, Howard felt a phantom twinge in his neck. Big brown eyes sparkled with hope. "Really?"
Still, it’ll be a lie if he says that this Toni, sitting before him with her shoulder slumped and a thousand yard stare, does not unsettle him. It’s selfish, he knows, but he really wants the loud, vibrant woman he watched grow up back.
He was about to start the engine when he came to an abrupt halt because, finally, something Toni said filtered through the angry haze in his mind.
“I’m sure, dad,” she assured him softly, breathing in his familiar and comforting smell and pretending she doesn’t feel the wetness against her neck. She smiles. “I’m home.”
“Oh, please,” Toni says, scoffing as she steps aside to let him in, “let’s not pretend Peg’s doesn’t have a colorful vocabulary that makes you and I look like saints in comparison. And you haven’t answered my question.”
She’s vaguely aware that Obie has nudged her away from the podium, but she didn’t fight it. She walked right on through the crowd and towards the door that lead towards the fire exit, Obie’s voice following after her as he tried to placate the press.
It’s an unusually hot spring day, so they weren’t wearing their full armor, but they were all still burning. Some had already thrown aside their tunics, Bucky had removed his left glove, and Steve was close to striping his own clothes off.
“How do we remove it?” he asks a few seconds of silence later. His voice is rough with emotion and he clears his throat.
They don’t say anything else and Toni allows herself to be ushered towards her car, though she stopped to hug Jarvis and her father one more time before she ducked into the backseat. Happy had just slid behind the wheel and Pepper was buckling in when there’s a tap on Toni’s side of the car.
Eight minutes and twenty-one seconds later, Toni slumps against his shoulder, snoring quietly where her cheek is mushed against his bicep. The tablet is on her lap and the stylus hangs limply from her fingers. Steve is careful to extract the devices from Toni’s person.
“Hey, I’m just the messenger. Pegs is on her way.” Steve shrugs and accepts one bottle when she held it out to him.
(Something tells her it’s a mental breakdown but she shoves that little thought back into a box and pushes as far back as she could.)
No one answers because it brings them back to the reality of normalcy. Steve could practically see the cloud of defeat hanging over their heads.
“This isn’t a game, Toni,” Potts protests even as he reaches into said socket, long fingers disappearing into the opening quickly followed by the sound of thick liquid moving about. Potts almost gags. “Oh god, there’s puss.”
“Captain, this Sir Edward Carbonell, a lawyer and distant relative of my wife. Sir Carbonell, the captain of my Knight, Steven Grant Rogers.”
He said his good-byes to Peggy and Edwin, and Howard walks him to the garage in silence. Steve suspects that the older man wants to say something, so he keeps quiet, but when they arrive at the vast expanse of the underground Stark garage, Howard still hasn’t said anything.
Steve looked like he still wants to say something concerning the situation, but at the last second, sighs, letting the subject drop and goes along with her change, “I went to visit your dad.”
can come up with?” Hawk flicks yet another twig from his seemingly endless supply towards Bucky, it’s trajectory set on hitting him on the forehead, but Bucky swats it away with his stick, sending it into the fire just before Sam snatched the sticks away from him.
Then he’s gone, leaving Toni there on the steps under the scrutiny of the media, stiff and unseeing.
Howard’s eyes widen so Toni pushes on, “I was thinking this could be where we go next. Go green like no other company in the world can even dream of. I know we can do it, especially now with more manpower to focus in the energy department. My estimate is in two years we can fully supply green energy to a tower as tall as the Empire State Building, but right now I can’t be sure because you’re not saying anything and I really need you to say something, pops.”
She gives him a tight hug, and Steve breathes in her familiar scent of roses and peppermint. “What do we know, Pegs?” he asks as they pull away.
Toni smiles to herself as she watches her best friend from a good distance. He’s clearly got the full attention of the group of pilots. But it’s her time to shine now.
Steve glances back at Sir Carbonell. He looks nothing like Queen Maria, given he can’t really tell what the other man looks like under his beard, curly hair, and thick glasses. Still, he’s shuffling again and he’s hunched in on himself. Steve could hardly imagine him talking about the law to anyone. Still, King Howard hadn’t gotten to where he is now by trusting people who couldn’t get things done. If he’s assigning such an important task to Sir Carbonell, then Steve must trust that Sir Carbonell could get the job done.
"Uh, Dad, Doctor Strange, I think I found how to stop these things," he called in, "but I don't know how."
So I’m not quite sold on the “argument” Steve and Toni had so I might go back and rewrite it later, but I just really wanted to get this chapter out so here we are!!
Steve remains still as Toni says, “Huh…quite surprised you know that, or anything at all, about me these days.”
There was a picture, as if Toni needed to see to know what they meant. Still, she looked and her translator says, “This one.”
She and Howard were heading somewhere for Christmas when they were attacked by the elusive Winter Soldier. It was dumb luck that Steve found out what Howard was carrying with him and drove after the man, catching up just in time to see a masked man pulling Toni by the neck out of the mangled car.
They share a quick hug and exchange cheek kisses. Steve can see the shift in Toni’s smile, the curve of her lips relaxing just a tiny bit but it’s enough for Steve to see the genuineness.
(Peter refused to call it an arc reactor. He was more than happy Dad didn't need it to live anymore, thank you very much. It helps though that it can sit over clothing.)
“Oh!” Toni immediately drops the towel to start unbuckling at the straps across her shoulders. “You should’ve led with that! Let’s go!”
“–and he’s saved my ass more than a couple of times over the last decade. He’s useful in a tight spot, quick on his feet, and if you learn how to properly utilize this kid, you’d find your life on the road a little bit easier.”
It doesn’t take Happy long to bring the car around to her and when he gets out to open the door, she knew something was wrong. His face is stricken as he says, “Boss...your dad just had a heart attack.”
Nat hugs him and Clint throws him a salute which Steve returns. Then he’s off and watching as the jet lifts off and disappears into the night sky. When he turns around to the gate, it was already opening and the familiar stature of one Edwin Jarvis was standing at the front doors. Steve jogs up the drive and greets the butler with a handshake, taking note of the weary slump in the man’s shoulders.
And just like that, Steve’s already on his next mission. He types in a number in his phone and waits for the other person to answer.
Howard had his head turned in her direction, eyes blurry from sleep but his hand was reaching out, weak and shaky.
Steve shakes his head, unable to stop himself from smiling, and relaxes back in his seat. The car may be a little cramped for him, but the seats were comfortable. "Whatever you say, Toni."
Stane chuckles, tucking his hands into his pants’ pockets. “I should’ve figured. How’s Toni been doing?”
"Don't do that." Rhodey turns back to his men, chuckling as well despite himself. "Give us a couple minutes, you guys."
A petty Tony Stark was not someone you ever wanted to cross paths with, and it seems his Pops is unfortunate enough to be on the receiving end.
Steve simply quirks a disbelieving brow at her and pulled up Rhode's contact in his phone, fully intent of asking the other man for answers Toni is obviously not going to give. "Su-ure, Toni."
Steve strides in with his squadron behind him, and what portion of the court that had returned to the capital watch them with curiosity, whispering amongst themselves. The throne room is as grandiose as Steve last remember it to be, all marble and stone with the Kingdom’s banner hanging from every pillar in gold and reds, and at the head of it all, His Majesty, King Howard sat on his throne, while Her Majesty, Queen Marie sat next to him, and behind her stood Peggy. They were all regal as ever, Their Majesties dressed formally, while Peggy wore her uniform.
“JARVIS, you up?” she says into the familiar quiet of her workshop, already tapping away at her desk.
The man doesn’t even look down but he doesn’t need to. Toni’s heart sinks. “Have you seen these pictures? Huh?”
“Yes, please,” Steve says with a grin and allows himself to be steered around the kitchen as the AI tells him where everything is.
The glass door opens automatically, making Toni look up from whatever she and DUM-E were working on. Is that a boot?
If it wasn’t for the serum, he wouldn’t have heard her. Wouldn’t have heard the vulnerable tremor in her voice, and wouldn’t have turned around to see her standing on top of the steps leading up to the doors, her wild curls drifting in cool night’s air as it drifted around them. She was dressed in nothing but an oversized MIT shirt that hung just above her knees, her feet was bare, and her lithe arms were wrapped around her shivering body. If that already didn’t make a pitiful picture, her eyes would’ve taken the cake. They were wide, scared and hurt and Steve found the fight leaving him in an instant.
Steve looks up to find Rumlow holding a smaller box with a scowl on his face. He stops before Steve so he can check the label plastered across on its lid.
Toni takes the information in as she zips her borrowed jacket up to her neck and spots the camera up in one corner pointed right at them and very much working if the red dot was anything to go by.
“That is a huge understatement,” Rhodes cuts in. “Should’ve seen him. He was down on all fours, nearly prostrate–”
“Don’t freak out, please. I had limited options on how to keep shrapnel away from my heart and this was the best solution I could come up with.” Toni hopes the explanation could somehow soften the blow of seeing the reactor. She unbuttons her blouse and slowly reveals the device to her father. “It works and hasn’t blown up on me yet.”
“Of course it is.” Toni wipes at her face and arms. “I wouldn’t have stuck it in my chest if it wasn’t. And anyway, where did you run off to?”
And that was that. She only had one more call to make. She picks up the landline on her desk. The phone rings two times before it’s answered. “How are you today, Bucky?”
“Isn’t she always?” Steve shrugs, keeping an eye on the vehicle until it turns away from his sight. When he turned back to Toni, he finds her already staring at him. “What?”
“Has no one ever taught you manners?” A familiar voice says, cutting Steve’s question off before the young man was yanked back by the pony-tail at his nape. “Not even a minute, and you’re sticking your nose in someone else’s business.”
“Turns out you’re my new mission,” he says, taking in the open floor plan of her Malibu home. He nods. “Nice place.”
Steve manages to get away from the mess DUM-E made and briskly walks over to the couch. “JARVIS...does Toni have a concussion?”
He couldn't see Wanda's face but he saw her wipe at her cheeks before Dad smiled and leaned in to give her forehead a kiss.
Steve doesn’t answer. Instead, he finishes off the rest of his ale. Next to him, Bucky does the same. Around them, the tavern is bustling with its usual nightly festivities, the smell of alcohol mixing with pipe smoke, and loud off-tune singing.
Peter didn’t really care (neither did Pops and Morgan). Dad is alive and well and renewing his wedding vows with Pops as the rest of their friends and family watched on, Peter’s back from being dusted, and he has a little sister!
He squeezed the hand on her knee and she immediately reaches for it. Steve allows her to hold it and watches as she stares into his eyes and says, “You have to promise though...you’re the only one who’ll read it. Not Aunt Peggy, not Fury, and definitely not my father.”
“Just don’t know who to trust right now,” she tells him, and that...that probably stings even more. With Hydra/SHIELD, her kidnapping, and all those Stark weapons...she’d be a fool not to be suspicious even if she doesn’t want to. Ignorance is bliss, and she’s been ignorant for too long. “‘Til further notice, why don’t we just keep it all on my private server.”
She trails off because Rhodey's shaking his head, a disbelieving smile twisting his face. "What," he asks, "you humanitarian now, or something?"
There was a pause then a quiet chorus of ‘Miss Stark’ goes around while one guy raises his own. Toni recognizes him and points. “Hey, Ben.”
“Day eleven, test thirty-seven, configuration two-point-oh. For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety.” Toni pins the bot with a look. “If you douse me again and I’m not on fire, I’m donating you to the city college.”
carries over from the other side of the ‘shop. Steve tears his eyes away from his phone to look where Toni had her arms up, as if in victory, followed by JARVIS saying, “Congratulations, Miss.”
Without another word, Steve strides purposefully across the linoleum floors, gearing up for a speech because while she might be fine, Steve would rest easier knowing a professional had taken a look at her and give her a clean bill of health. He knows Howard would appreciate it, too. He reaches the door in no time, and nods at the two soldiers guarding it, backs ramrod straight. He goes to open the door when an arm blocks his action. Steve turns to the soldier.
She’s only vaguely aware of this, however, her mind too occupied to really settle on any one thing while she strides into SI’s California HQ and heads straight for the podium already set up for her in the lobby, mindlessly returning people’s ‘welcome backs’ and handshakes. Tesla bless Pepper.
Hawk points at Steve and Steve already knows the words that are about to come out of his mouth. “He’s the mom to General Carter’s dad on the battlefield.”
Toni’s falling and Steve can’t do anything to stop it. She’s up there and he’s down here, and he can’t reach her.
“I can give you a list if you need it.” Lady Potts offers. “I’ll have it on your desk by evening. I will not budge on this.”
Toni points to the bot. “Dummy, look alive. You’re on standby for fire safety. You,” she swivels around to address the other bot holding a camera, “roll it.”
“Now I just need you to reach in and lift the wire out,” Toni says breathing deeply as relaxes back into the chair. “Your fingers are about as slim as I need them to be and if my hands were longer I’d do this myself but alas, here we are, so go for it.”
Steve shifts his gaze towards Bucky, meeting his old friend’s eyes. Nat followed suit, then touches Steve’s elbow, her grip firm through the kevlar. “I got him, Cap. Leave him and the rest of Hydra to us, and focus on Stark junior.”
But then, in that moment, straddling his bike as he looked up to where Toni watched him with tears in her eyes, the autumn sky dark above them, Steve knew this was one thing he needed to deny her.
“I’m learning to fly, Steve,” she replies, seeing no sense in lying about this specific situation. “Turns out, the arc reactor has a bit more
On the tablet, he watches a news reel of Howard Stark being wheeled in a stretcher from the SI building and into an ambulance. Toni was nowhere to be seen, though Rhodes and Edwin was among the crowd, helping the security guards clear a path for the medical team.
I actually planned on having Steve be there to hear the news of Obi’s double-dealing, but I realized, this moment, where Toni’s world is falling apart and she’s realizing just how big this whole thing actually is, she
The man follows her gaze then smiles again and says as he goes back to his cooking, “That’s right. Smile.”
“And I need to see the cargo for myself.” Steve taps Rumlow’s box. “This goes in the third cart over.”
“Worried, definitely worried.” Peggy sighs on her end and Steve can see her rubbing at her temples in his mind. “I managed to get a group together to search the site of where Toni was held so I expect some news from them anytime now. I’ll send their report to you as soon as it arrives.”
In his haste to get to Toni ASAP, he had forgone shopping for clothes for his extended stay so with that added as a P.S. to his note for Toni, Steve rides off to the nearest Goodwill. Which turns out is pretty far away but Steve would rather spend more money on gas than he would on clothes. Just one of the things he never got over in the twenty-first century.
Sir Carbonell visibly perks up, and though Steve can’t see his eyes through his thick spectacles , or his mouth through the thick white beard that framed the lower half of his face, Steve thinks that Sir Carbonell is as delighted as him.
At that point, Steve was ready to snap. It was hard keeping his cool, and he could tell Rhodey was in the same boat as him. Howard wasn’t faring better. He looked more and more like he was on death’s door step with each video call Steve made to report another day of dead ends.
When they landed, the base was a flurry of activity and Steve immediately pushed his way through the throng to get to the medical building where he comes to an abrupt halt. He expected it to be as busy as it was outside but instead of the rush to provide Toni Stark with the best medical care they can offer, doctors and nurses alike stood around, nervous and confused. They all turned towards him in perfect sync when he burst through the doors.
Thankfully, Toni spies Steve making his way through crowd just as the other woman reaches her side with a sly smile. “Wow. Toni Stark.”
Dumbfounded, but not that much, Peter copied the gesture then nodded wildly before rushing to his room as quietly as possible.
“That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, and it’s keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart.” The man smiles at her but it doesn’t reach his eyes.
“Oh, get off your high horse for a minute Rogers, and listen.” Howard’s words were as sharp as ever, but there was a tremor in them that stopped Steve from tearing the man a new one. A sound that he’s only ever heard when Howard talked about the dearly departed Maria. “Someone took Toni.”
Peggy gives her late husband’s picture on her desk an apologetic smile. “You’ll forgive me for this, won’t you love? I know you’d understand. Just keep watch over me.”
“Yes, yes, you are.” He presses a long kiss to her cheek, then brow before pulling back. She loops her arm through his and allows him to walk her back to Pepper, the strawberry blond man waiting patiently as ever.
The clouds in Bucky’s eyes bled out as his gaze goes to Steve, clear and intent as he picks up on Steve’s mood, like he always used to do when they were still kids and blissfully unaware of their future.
“You have something to say, General Carter?” Steve asks, quietly so as to not overlap with Thor. Though he doubts he could ever compete with the other man’s booming voice, but still. He was raised with some manners.
Toni doesn’t answer, her gaze stuck to something on the other side of the room. Steve tracks her line of sight and ignores the slight twinge behind his lungs when he finds Potts. The man is sharply dressed in a blue suit that’s obviously been custom-tailored for him.
His steps are silent as he moves around to get changed. If he didn’t know that Coulson would nag him about going out in his sleepwear, Steve wouldn’t bother getting dressed, but alas, his manservant had made such a fuss the first night that Steve had vowed never to even step foot outside of his bedroom without being properly clothed for company.
She turns her head towards the sound and finds a man standing with his back towards her and guiding a straight edge razor down the side his neck. His whistling does not falter. Her throat screams for relief when her gaze catches into a small metal cup sitting on the edge of a wooden table next to where she lay.
He stirred something in a pot above the fire he had going. He looks up at her with a raised brow, almost mocking and very passive. “What did
"Just stand down. Something happens, then come in," Toni adds as she steps back in place and addresses the room at large, "And again, let's bring it up to two-point-five! Three, two, one."
"Yeah." Toni paused, letting herself look at the man that she has considered family for a long time. The man who didn't stop looking for her when everyone else lost hope. Her brother. She couldn't think of a better person to share this project with than him. "Rhodey, I'm working on something big. I came to talk to ya. I want you to be a part of it."
Rhodes grins. “I got the General on my back, fret not, friend. You, however, well...keep an eye out on Tony for me. He tends to make things go boom sometimes.”
Peggy nods. “I have, and whatever the media or your own head is telling you, it wasn’t your fault, Toni.”
With a huff, she leaves her bed, tugging on an old MIT sweater over the cami she wears to bed and a pair of joggers, before heading down to her lab. The lights are out in Steve’s borrowed room when she passes by it.
“A joint force between Army and Air Force lead by Colonel James Rhodes.” Peggy daintily wipes at her mouth with a table napkin. The name brings a memory of a fourteen-year-old Toni clinging to the bicep of a barely out of his teen’s boy with a smitten smile. “You remember him, don’t you, Steve? Sweet young man who took care of Toni in MIT. He was in the second convoy.”
However, as soon as the elevator opened into the Stark-Rogers floor of the compound, all hopes of flopping unto the couch was dashed when he spotted Pops' feet hanging off the arm rest. Dad still wasn't letting Pops sleep in the same bed as him, so Pops either took residence in one of the guest bedrooms, or the living room couch.
For the next week, Steve and his men work hard to prepare for the journey, while the castle prepares for those who were accompanying Sir Carbonell’s people. Steve does not once sees Tony amongst them, and when he voiced this to Bucky, his friend had shrugged and pointed out that it’s an unusually large caravan so it will surely be hard to spot someone who’s supposed to be the help for the help.
