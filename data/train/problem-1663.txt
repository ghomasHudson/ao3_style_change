Sherlock was still for a moment before John heard the squelching of the cream and felt Sherlock’s hands on him. Sherlock was oddly conscientious about it, spreading the cream in great vertical stripes down John’s back with his large hands, right from his shoulder and hairline to the waistband of his trunks, as if making sure no inch of John’s skin would be left unprotected.  Used to mates slapping on cream on the shoulders haphazardly with one or two cursory rubs (nothing that could be considered as putting the romance into bromance!), it was a bit unusual, to say the least. Nice though.
Sherlock leaned against the window and thought on this new intelligence of Molly’s.   'How can I suffer myself to be deluded by hope,' said Sherlock, 'and, because Count Wilkes is not yet arrived, feel a momentary happiness? Alas! That he will come is certain—it is weakness to doubt.'
John’s jaw works. “I don’t know. Maybe.”
“This competition wide open Kate. The gold and silver medallists from London retiring after those games, not back to contest their medals, our own John Watson coming second to this man at the world championships, let’s see how he does now… very strong beginning with this handstand sequence.”
a scene at a ball!  We love those!
'You have hoped impossibilities then,' replied Moriarty, with a grim smile.
“0.185 of a point is quite a lot in Gymnastics,” said John. His eyes shone over the rim of the teacup.
They were now so near the fire, which had long flamed at a distance on the blackness of night, that it gleamed upon the road, and they could distinguish figures moving about the blaze. The way winding still nearer, they perceived in the valley one of those numerous bands of banditti, which at that period particularly haunted the wilds of the Pyrenees, and lived partly by plundering the traveller. They were preparing their supper; a large pot stood by the fire, over which several figures were busy.
'None, Monsieur, unless you have a mind to try your luck yonder,' replied the peasant, pointing to the woods, 'but I would not advise you to go there.'
He had continued thus for a considerable time, when, amidst the uproar of the storm, he thought he heard a voice, and, raising himself, saw the chamber door open, and Molly enter with a countenance of wild affright.
Attempting to regroup his dignity, Sherlock strode towards the table, trying to look as stately as possible with an armful of trainers and duffel bags. Dumping everything in a pile, he perched on the edge of one of the bar stools and observed John carefully making his way towards him, teacups rattling a touch on their saucers, mouth pursed with concentration. Reaching the table, he placed the beverages down, looking inordinately pleased with himself at managing to deliver them safely. “I assumed milk?” Sherlock nodded – “Sugar?”  With the air of a magician, John reached into the left pocket of his hoodie and extracted some sugar sticks, placing them on the table. “But wait!” he said “there’s more!”, proudly producing a silver teaspoon. Sherlock grabbed at the sugar and spoon. “But wait!” John cried again, “There’s
'Ah!' said Holmes, with a deep sigh, 'are we then so near Le-Blanc!' He appeared much agitated.
Some weeks passed in the course of customary visits, during which nothing remarkable occurred. Sherlock was amused by the manners and scenes that surrounded him, so different from those of France, but where Count Wilkes, too frequently for his comfort, contrived to introduce himself. His manner, figure and accomplishments, which were generally admired, Sherlock would, perhaps, have admired also, had the Count forborne to persecute Sherlock with officious attentions, during which he deduced some traits in Sebastian’s character, that prejudiced Sherlock against whatever might otherwise be good in it.
Judging by the chorus of ‘oof!’s as the bus lurches to a halt, John isn’t the only one who was distracted by the lights. The building looks amazing, all lit up against the trees and the backdrop of Christ the Redeemer at the top of the mountain.
Of the several persons who had appeared in the hall, here was Douglas alone: but Sherlock's alarm was soon after heightened by the steps of some one in the corridor, who, he apprehended, brought a message from the Count. In the next moment, Molly appeared.
Caterina soon returned with the wood, and then, when the cheerful blaze once more animated the room, and this servant had withdrawn, Sherlock asked Molly, whether she had made the enquiry bade her. 'Yes, ma'amselle,' said Molly, 'but not a soul knows any thing about the matter: and old Carlo—I watched him well, for they say he knows strange things—old Carlo looked so as I don't know how to tell, and he asked me again and again, if I was sure the door was ever unfastened. Lord, as for me, I am all astounded, and would no more sleep in this chamber, than I would on the great cannon at the end of the east rampart.'
He walked a while in the gardens, arranging his thoughts; he saw John amiable and intelligent, and Monsieur Mycroft neither the one, nor the other. The remembrance of John, however, brought with it many very painful emotions, for Sherlock was by no means reconciled to the thought of resigning him; and, Monsieur Mycroft having already shewn how highly he disapproved of the attachment, Sherlock foresaw much suffering from the opposition of interests; yet with all this was mingled a degree of delight, which, in spite of reason, partook of hope.  Still, what should occur when they should next, if ever, meet again was an occurrence impossible to deduce.
“I’ve been swapping them ‘round the village for you, since you were collecting them,” says John by way of explanation. “I thought you might like them.”
Sherlock meets an unexpected person in the grounds of his home.
While he waited for the appointed hour, a message was brought, importing, that Moriarty could not see him, till the next day. Molly said, she fancied the Chevaliers were going out to the wars again, for the court-yard was filled with horses, and she heard, that the rest of the party, who went out before, were expected at the castle. 'And I heard one of the soldiers, too,' added she, 'say to his comrade, that he would warrant they'd bring home a rare deal of booty.—So, thinks I, if the Signor can, with a safe conscience, send his people out a-robbing—why it is no business of mine. I only wish I was once safe out of this castle; and, if it had not been for poor Hopkins's sake, I would have let Count Wilkes's people run away with us both!'  Sherlock was silent, inattentive, absorbed in thought, and passed the whole of this day in a kind of solemn tranquillity, such as is often the result of faculties overstrained by suffering.
“And speaking of experienced competitors, we cross back to the parallel bars to see John Watson’s routine. Watson of course coming second at the World Championships last year in this event to Moran who we saw score a 15.8 in the previous rotation. Here we go, John Watson now, third man from Great Britain on this apparatus….”
Sherlock frowned. “And are you being…safe?” John garbled out, immediately cursing himself for his awkward phrasing.
Sherlock, with trembling hands, now opened the small package, that had been pressed upon him; but faint hopes of aid were dashed when he saw only a few fruits and a small flask of wine.
The Holmeses are there in their little family group, all clutching onto comically large takeaway coffee cups. Lestrade is cheerily waving, half-dragging John behind, who suddenly knows what at least some of those texts were about.
“Oh, I’ve heard of that. Is that the prison with riots a few years back?” chips in Lestrade.
“Nothing to be embarrassed about, dear! Not in London, there’s all sorts round. Mrs. Turner next door’s got married ones,” she says, dropping her voice to a whisper by the end of the sentence.
'Count Wilkes! do you know what you say?' said Douglas.
'O yes, sir! there is Benedetto plays the great drum to admiration; and then, there is Launcelot the trumpeter; nay, for that matter, Hopkins can play on the trumpet;—but she is ill now. I remember once'—
Mycroft looks across at her with an extremely insincere smile. “Oh, am I happy too? I haven’t checked.”
'Pray, Mrs. Hudson, cease,' said Sherlock, wishing to interrupt this ill-judged, but well-meaning harangue; Mrs. Hudson's loquacity, however, was not to be silenced so easily. ‘I have set out a supper for you.' Sherlock waved his hand—'No,' said he, 'let it remain. I am going to my chamber.'
And I their toys to the great children leave:
“Well, all seven then.” The man really was an idiot.

'My dear sir, do not think so gloomily,' said Sherlock.
“No!”
'I live for my family and myself,' said Holmes; 'and I know only happiness.'
Sherlock was silent, and he left the room.
'If every man deserves the title of impertinent, who admires Monsieur Sherlock,' replied Douglas, 'I fear there are a great many impertinents, and I am willing to acknowledge myself one of the number.'
“Moran taking the silver in the High Bar final just yesterday – and that was a lovely full turn, held very nicely on the one rail – and another full turn – coming into the underswing work, an important part of the routine, he is the only one in the world to be doing that particular underswing there. And there’s the above bar element – and into the dismount – big double front to stick.”
'Where are you, my son?' said Holmes, as he stretched forth his hands. Sherlock had turned to the window, that his father might not perceive his struggles; he now understood, that his father’s sight had failed him. When he had given Sherlock his blessing, and it seemed to be the last effort of expiring life, he sunk back on his pillow. Sherlock pressed his hand to his father’s forehead; the damps of death had settled there, and, forgetting his resolutions for a moment, his tears mingled with them. Holmes lifted up his eyes; the spirit of a father returned to them, but it quickly vanished, and he spoke no more.
Like a ballet dancer’s, John mused. “Is that what you wear in competition, too?  Like a ballet outfit?”
'It suits our purpose,' replied Moriarty, with a mercurial change of mood, 'and IS a noble edifice. You know not, it seems, by what mischance it came to me.'
Sherlock thanked him, assured him that he might be assured of his discretion, and entreated him to dispatch.
In another long chapter (lay in stocks of your beverage and snack of choice), visitors arrive at Musgrovio.
When they were alone, he held out his hand to his son, and fixed his eyes upon his countenance, with an expression so full of tenderness and grief, that all Sherlock’s fortitude forsook him, and hot tears cascaded over his cheeks. Holmes seemed struggling to acquire firmness, but was still unable to speak; he could only press Sherlock’s hand, and check the tears that stood trembling in his eyes.
Shall Spring to these sad scenes no more return?
“I shall tell her you send your felicitations, Sherlock,” said Victor, although he seemed uncertain, questioning.
It was obvious to Sherlock that it was John whom he had seen at night in the gardens of Bakersfield, and that he had been observed there by Monsieur Mycroft; who now passing from one painful topic only to revive another almost equally so, spoke of the situation of Sherlock’s property, in the hands of M. Motteville. While Mycroft thus talked with ostentatious pity of Sherlock's misfortunes, he to rendered Sherlock fully sensible of every cruel mortification of his situation, as he was to be considered as a dependant, not only by his elder brother, but by his brother’s servants.

Here we are back where we started: the Maracanã Stadium, to put the cap on a fortnight of sports, crime, and love.  Merry Christmas, all.
“Yes, Mummy. I had heard.”
“Well, Kate, here we are at the half-way point in this competition, and it has not disappointed! Uchimura taking the early lead over Verniaiev after their first event on floor, but the Ukrainian battling back and outscoring Uchimura on the next two events and currently in the gold medal position. The Japanese star in Bronze medal position and our own John Watson currently in the silver medal position with three rotations to go.”
“I don’t have one. I barely know him. I met him…” John thinks back “ten days ago.”
John is bent almost in half now, bottom pointed right at Sherlock as his legs tap out behind him. Sherlock is helpless. Stranded by reason. Destitute of logic. Bereft of any capability to do anything other than watch John’s bum bounce in time to the music.
“That’s not what people normally say,” Sherlock mused, eyes following the leaping Belarussian team out on the floor.
An hour passed before Molly appeared at Sherlock’s chamber, who then came weeping and sobbing. 'O Hopkins—Hopkins!' cried she.
“We go first to Watson, first up on the floor. Can you do, it John?”
Let's have a squiz at some of the uniforms an infrantryman of the period might have worn (not much room to hide a weapon in them their pants, hur hur hur):
‘I need not recommend it to your prudence, Sherlock, to endeavour to conciliate his kindness; I know how this will grate you, but you will find an easier time of it if you are successful in this endeavour.'
,” John interrupts. “You can’t expect me to swallow that.”
“Yup,” she replied, scrolling the screen with her pinky finger.
“No, I’m serious. They show off your calves. Really.” John looks up at Sherlock, feeling the first cold tendrils. “Why didn’t you meet me at the bus? Did you, did you not want…” John trails off, throat thick.
And in a few more beats the car is pulling away, disappearing ‘round a corner.
'This is very strange!' said Sherlock.

“One minute and twenty-three seconds, to be exact.” One minute and twenty-three seconds of utterly incomprehensible drivel concerning people Sherlock cared nothing about.
Also, I had go back and change a character's names from an earlier chapter - the Marquis de Villeroi is the Marquis de Lestrade now. That's the only change, I just want you to remember that in another few dozen chapters or so ;)
One night, on which a council was not held, Morstan came in great agitation of spirits, and dispatched his confidential servant to Moriarty, who was at a Casino, desiring that he would return home immediately; but charging the servant not to mention her name. Moriarty obeyed the summons, and, on meeting Morstan, was informed of the circumstances that occasioned her visit.
It was now twelve o'clock. As he closed the casement, he heard footsteps on the terrace below, and saw imperfectly, through the gloom, several persons advancing, who passed under the casement. He then heard the clink of arms, and, in the next moment, the watch-word; when, recollecting the command he had overheard from Moriarty, and the hour of the night, he understood, that these men were, for the first time, relieving guard in the castle. Having listened till all was again still, Sherlock retired to the bed.
Victor is still looking at his phone. “
Sherlock pouts a little, feeling John bristle behind him. “Well, I’m not the one clubbing my team members, although that is perhaps because I have no team members… still, psychopath seems a bit harsh, wouldn’t you say?”
With some difficulty, Molly led him to the bed, which Sherlock examined with an eager, frenzied eye, before he lay down, and then, pointing, turned with shuddering emotion, to Molly, who, now more terrified, went towards the door, that she might bring one of the servants to pass the night with them; but Sherlock, observing her going, called her by name, and then in a soft and plaintive tone of voice, begged, that she, too, would not forsake him.—'For since my father died,' added he, sighing, 'every body forsakes me.'
“and Sarah Sawyer…”
Sherlock listened in vain hope for the name of John. Mycroft spoke in his turn of the delights of Venice, and of the pleasure he expected from visiting the fine castle of Moriarty, on the Apennine; which latter mention, at least, was merely a retaliating boast, for Sherlock well knew, that his brother had no taste for solitary grandeur, and, particularly, for such as the castle of Musgrovio promised. Thus the party continued to converse, and, as far as civility would permit, to torture each other by mutual boasts, while they reclined on sofas in the portico, and were environed with delights both from nature and art, by which any honest minds would have been tempered to benevolence, and happy imaginations would have been soothed into enchantment.
“Well, Irene, Watson beginning now, pushed so hard in the all-around to come away with the bronze, let’s see what he can do.”
'How does your comrade account for it?' said Sherlock.
Of love, of joy, of peace and plenty, where,
Sherlock continued to play till a gentle tap at the chamber-door roused him. It was La Voisin, come to say, that a confessor from the neighbouring convent was below, ready to attend Holmes. The confessor remained alone with Holmes above half an hour; when Sherlock was called in, he found Holmes more agitated than when he had left him, and he gazed, with a degree of resentment, at the friar, as the cause of this; who, however, looked mildly and mournfully at him, and turned away. Holmes, in a tremulous voice, said, he wished his son to join in prayer with him, and asked if La Voisin would do so too. The old man and his daughter came; they both wept, and knelt with Sherlock round the bed, while the holy father read in a solemn voice the service for the dying.
Soon after this period, his anxiety was awakened by the indisposition of his father, who was attacked with a fever; which, though not thought to be of a dangerous kind, gave a severe shock to his constitution. Madame Holmes and Sherlock attended him with unremitting care; but his recovery was very slow, and, as he advanced towards health, Madame seemed to decline.
'I am not superstitious,' said Moriarty, regarding his companions with stern displeasure, 'though I know how to despise the common-place sentences, which are frequently uttered against superstition. I will enquire further into this affair.' He then left the room; and his guests, separating for the night, retired to their respective apartments.
“I don’t have friends,” Sherlock spits.
“Enjoying yourself?” Sherlock sneers.
He turns groggily to his left. Sherlock and the man are circling around a large air-conditioning unit. There is talking, but the words arrive slowly to John’s ears. The black-clad man makes a sudden feint left and John notices a metallic flash in his hand; John’s brain sluggishly registers
Soft tinkling down the moss-grown hill;
“You’re breaking my heart,” John said conversationally, running his hands over Sherlock’s bum, watching shivers spreading like ripples over his lover’s skin. “What are you going to do about it, I wonder?”
with them in lieu of the more typical flowers.
John held up the phone, clearing his throat and feeling horrifically obvious as he looked at Sherlock and Mary standing at arm’s length from one another, Sherlock a little further from John. “Ok,” he said, positioning them in the centre of the screen. “Go”.
The portrait well the lover's voice supplies;
“What?” said John, on the back foot once again.
Sherlock made no attempt to reply to this speech; he knew it would be useless. Mycroft laid the Count's presents upon the table, on which Sherlock was leaning, and then, desiring he would be ready early in the morning, bade him good-night. For some time Sherlock sat so lost in thought, as to be wholly unconscious where he was; at length, raising his head, and looking round the room, he retired to an armchair; not to sleep, for that was scarcely possible, but to try, at least, to quiet his mind, to think of the friends whose life he was saving through his sacrifice, and thus to collect strength of spirits sufficient to bear him through the scene of the approaching morning.
Fixing his gaze on John, Sherlock placed the phone on the counter and with a flick of his long fingers, sent it skidding along the countertop back to its owner. Unfortunately, he must have miscalculated the angle
“Listen, what I said before, John. I meant it,” Sherlock begins. “I don’t have friends. I’ve just got one.”
And then John had stormed off into the building with not even a backward glance and Mrs Hudson had wittered on about having a little domestic in the elevator and upon reflection it occurs to him that that is, perhaps, what has happened.
The figure raised its head but suddenly started away, and glided down the terrace. He watched it, for a long while, passing swiftly in the moon-light, but heard no footstep, till a sentinel from the other extremity of the rampart walked slowly along. The man stopped under his window, and, looking up, called Sherlock by name and asked if he had seen any thing pass. On him answering in confusion, that he had; the sentinel said no more, but walked away down the terrace, Sherlock following him with his eyes, till he was lost in the distance.
John looked out to the crowd again, trying to hide his smile. “So, uh…how did you get started in this sport anyway?”
While he paused, the figure came opposite to his casement, and was stationary. Everything remained quiet; he had not heard even a foot-fall; and the solemnity of this silence, with the mysterious form he saw, subdued his spirits, so that Sherlock was moving away from the casement, when, on a sudden, he observed the figure start away, and glide down the rampart, after which it was soon lost in the obscurity of night. Sherlock continued to gaze, for some time, on the way it had passed, and then retired within his chamber, musing on this strange circumstance, and scarcely doubting, that he had witnessed a supernatural appearance.
To relieve, or perhaps to indulge, the pensive temper of his mind, he bade Sherlock fetch the violin he knew how to touch with such sweet pathos. As Sherlock drew near the fishing-house, he was surprised to hear the tones of the instrument, which were awakened by the hand of taste, and uttered a plaintive air, whose exquisite melody engaged all his attention. He listened in profound silence, afraid to move from the spot, lest the sound of his steps should occasion him to lose a note of the music, or should disturb the musician. Every thing without the building was still, and no person appeared. He continued to listen, curiosity increased by a remembrance of the pencilled lines he had formerly seen, and he hesitated whether to proceed, or to return.

John looks up as a metal tray clatters down next to him.  “Oh, g’day Bill,” he said absently.
'Yes, sir, but do pray open it.'
is an extremely swish hotel, if you'd not already assumed. This conversation takes place in this rather special dining space:
“All of it, John,” came the response.
Sherlock was again confused, and again hesitated what to reply; he felt most acutely the difficulty—his isolation did not allow a single relative, or friend, to whom he could turn for even a look, that might support and guide him in the present embarrassing circumstances. Monsieur Mycroft, who was his only relative, and ought to have been this friend, was either occupied by his own amusements, or so resentful of the reluctance his brother had shewn to quit Bakersfield, that he seemed totally to have abandoned Sherlock there.

“Oooh, nice one,” said Mary, looking at her phone with satisfaction. “Mike, are you on Instagram? Sherlock?”
'O Lord! they say the room is haunted, and has been so these many years.'
The sound of carriage wheels brought a troop of servants to the great gate, where Holmes alighted, and from which he led Sherlock into the gothic hall, now no longer hung with the arms and ancient banners of the family. These were displaced, and the oak wainscotting, and beams that crossed the roof, were painted white.  The heavy walls were hung with frivolous ornaments, and every thing that appeared denoted the false taste and corrupted sentiments of the present owner.
'Aye, ma'am, Hopkins said much the same thing of me. Good God! said she, Molly, what is to become of you, if you are to go running about the castle among all these drunken Signors?'

A spin on one leg, the ball rising up his body from the floor to his above his head that emphasises all of his slim height. The splits. John bites his hand, teeth sinking into the meat of his palm.

Bill extracted his face from the two-handed hold of his lady companion. “Bloody hell, John!

Sherlock is quite sure, as it happens. He is of course a genius, but that’s hardly necessary in this case, not with John’s horrible teammates constantly droning on about how many women he has had casual intercourse with. He sticks his other toe into the tights and rolls them on.
Monsieur Mycroft, to whom these remarks were sometimes addressed, because they supported topics for trivial conversation, seemed indefatigable in his attempts to depreciate John, towards whom he felt all the petty resentment of a narrow pride. 'I admire the lady,' said he, 'but I must condemn her choice of a partner.' 'Oh, the Chevalier Watson is one of the most accomplished young men we have,' replied the lady, to whom this remark was addressed: 'it is whispered, that Mademoiselle D'Emery, and her large fortune, are to be his.'
In that moment it was apparent; ‘it is Signora Morstan, then’.
“Don’t bother,” said John, raising his teacup to his lips.

'By heaven this is too much!' suddenly exclaimed the Count; 'Signor Moriarty, you treat me ill; it is from you that I shall look for explanation.'
. His projections were shamefully inaccurate. First the Romanian and then the Russian each scoring over 1.5 points over his calculations. His study had been incomplete. The rulebook had been child’s play to understand (curse his mother for looking at his hair) but he’d had insufficient study of the competitor’s routines (Mrs Hudson confiscating his laptop from the ceiling – curse her twice!). At this rate he would be reduced to finding out the score as the judges posted it, like some sort of, of…
“I did!” Sherlock gestured at his civvies, loose black tracksuit pants and a t-shirt decorated with a design of honeycomb and a bee that hovered above his right nipple. “I didn’t know you actually meant to go in the water!”
Sherlock turned back to face them, sharp on his heel. “Very well,” he said, leaving John’s head spinning at the sudden change of tack.

John cleared his throat. “You can run but you can’t hide @johnhwatson! Got you with my @requin ribbon! Love this @britishgymnasticsofficial team! #medal #rio2016 #olympics #requin #TeamGB #rythmicgymnastics,” John finished up.
'No, sir, I am only a wanderer here.'
Sherlock looked back upon the road they had passed, John was seen, at the door of the little inn, following them with his eyes. He perceived Sherlock looking, and waved his hand; and he returned the adieu, till the winding road shut John from his sight.
'What do you waste time for, there?' said Barnardine with an oath, as he approached the horsemen. 'Dispatch—dispatch!'
He hasn’t quite made up his mind before the bus pulls up and they’re all blinking in the bright glare and the others are waving him goodbye as they head to the spectators entrance; John and his coach heading back around the building to the athletes’ entrance for the final time. Lestrade is tugging his sleeve, dragging him further round the building to – oh.
Soon Sherlock’s hand thrust the small tube at John’s side. No sooner had he taken it than he felt Sherlock turning behind him, presenting his back. John flicked up the lid at sniffed at it – Christ, it even smelled pricey, like citrus and mangoes and - he sniffed it again - kind of rainforesty? John was suddenly conscious of Sherlock shifting in front of him and he quickly squeezed out a generous measure and began rubbing it in, attempting to be as careful as Sherlock had been.
Sherlock seemed to stiffen slightly and looked out over the crowd, obviously going to make no response.
t, John thought.
“Sherlock?”
Violet tuts. “Oh dear, yes I’m sure they’ll be very excited!  We are terribly lucky to be here with our Sherlock, indeed.” Her youngest son stares up at the ceiling, teacup and saucer in hand.
'May I be allowed to ask what is so distressing?' said Madame Petitbois, who was struck with the rueful countenance and doleful accent, with which this was delivered.
“I fence,” replied Victor, looking down at John.
“I beg your pardon?
When he reached the carriage he found Holmes restored to animation. His father renewed his enquiries for an inn, and concerning the chateau in the woods. 'The chateau cannot accommodate you, sir,' said a venerable peasant who had followed Sherlock from the woods, 'it is scarcely inhabited; but, if you will do me the honour to visit my cottage, you shall be welcome to the best bed it affords.'
Sherlock seized a pause of Mycroft’s voice, to speak. 'Dear sir,' said he, 'but will not this serve to irritate the Signor? will it not provoke the harsh treatment you dread?'
“Yes, completely boring,” says John, eyebrow raised. “In just the same way that it’s

'He is taken care of,' replied Moriarty hastily, 'I have no time to answer idle questions.'
As his thoughts were so occupied, the barge stopped at a flight of marble steps, which led up the bank to a lawn. Lights appeared between some pillars beyond the portico. Moriarty sent forward his servant, and then disembarked with his family. They found Mons. and Madame Anderson, with a few friends, seated on sofas in the portico, enjoying the cool breeze of the night, and eating fruits and ices, while some of their servants at a little distance, on the river's bank, were performing a simple serenade. Sherlock was now accustomed to the way of living in this warm country, and was not surprised to find Mons. and Madame Anderson in their portico, two hours after midnight.
Having reached his own apartment, where no blazing wood on the hearth dissipated the gloom, he sat down with a book till Molly should come, and a fire could be kindled. He continued to read till the light was nearly expired, but Molly did not appear. Gloomy and fantastic images came to his mind. He looked towards the door of the stair-case, and then, examining whether it was still fastened, found that it was so. Unable to conquer the uneasiness he felt at the prospect of sleeping again in this remote and insecure apartment, which some person seemed to have entered during the preceding night, his impatience to see Molly, whom he had bidden to enquire concerning this circumstance, became extremely painful. He wished also to question her, as to the object, which had excited so much horror in his own mind, and which Molly on the preceding evening had appeared to be in part acquainted with, though her words were very remote from the truth, and it appeared plainly to Sherlock, that the girl had been purposely misled by a false report: above all he was surprised, that the door of the chamber, which contained it, should be left unguarded. Such an instance of negligence almost surpassed belief. A thousand deductions tormented his strained mind; he clutched his hands to his hair. But his light was now expiring; the faint flashes it threw upon the walls called up all the terrors of fancy, and he rose to find his way to the habitable part of the castle, before it was quite extinguished. As he opened the chamber door, he heard remote voices, and, soon after, saw a light issue upon the further end of the corridor, which Molly and another servant approached. 'I am glad you are come,' said Sherlock: 'what has detained you so long? Pray light me a fire immediately.'
With a sinking feeling, he turns over the red thing he’d seen from the ground, to see the embroidered ‘Team GB’ winking up at him. He looks at the tag on it, but knows before he sees the name inscribed on the luggage tag, that it belongs to one tall, gorgeous, but possibly very stupid, male rhythmic gymnast.
Whether Sherlock deduced a rational cause for this phenomena, or not, he certainly was relieved from much terror by discovering this man to be only a soldier on duty, and it immediately occurred to him, that it might be the mysterious figure, who had occasioned so much alarm on the preceding night. There were, however, some circumstances, that still required explanation. As far as he could judge by the faint moon-light, that had assisted his observation, the figure he had seen did not resemble this man either in shape or size; besides, he was certain it had carried no weapons. The silence of its steps, if steps it had, the moaning sounds, too, which it had uttered, and its strange disappearance, were circumstances of mysterious import, that did not apply, with probability, to a soldier engaged in the duty of his guard.
. The Sunday of Victor-bloody-Trevor’s fencing match.  “Mm,” said John through tightly pressed lips. The door opened and John marched through, fishing in his pocket for the keys. Once inside, John flicked the switch on the kettle as behind him he heard Sherlock open the laptop and settle on the couch.
'Let me lead to it then, by asking a question’ said Sherlock, his mind racing.
He went to pass on, but in the next moment, the sound of heavy gates of the portal opening was heard, and then the clattering of horses' hoofs in the court, with the confusion of many voices. Sherlock stood for a moment hesitating whether he should follow Moriarty, who, at the sound of the trumpet, had passed through the hall, and saw through the door, that opened beyond a long perspective of arches into the courts, a party of horsemen, whom he judged, as well as the distance would allow, to be the same he had seen depart, a few days before. But he staid not to scrutinize, for, when the trumpet sounded again, the chevaliers rushed out of the cedar room, and men came running into the hall from every quarter of the castle. Sherlock once more hurried for shelter to the hall’s balcony, and thence in pursuit of old Carlo, who he found bearing some fruit and wine for his master.
He looked up, with a sensation of horror, to the east turret, near which he then stood; a light glimmered through the grates of the lower chamber, but those of the upper one were dark. Presently, he perceived a person moving with a lamp across the lower room; but this circumstance revived no hope, concerning Mycroft, whom he had vainly sought in that apartment, which had appeared to contain only soldiers' accoutrements. Sherlock, however, determined to attempt the outer door of the turret, as soon as Barnardine should withdraw; and, if it was unfastened, to make another effort to discover his brother.
'Holy Maria! Yes, no, yes. I am sure it is a picture—I have seen it, and it is not veiled!'
John desperately wanted to know; he wanted to ask about what happened in France and why Sherlock left the ballet and who is Victor to him?  But the spell would be broken;
Your nephew,
Sherlock tosses the ball up in the air, leaps across the floor, landing on hands and feet, pelvis raised up in the air before the ball falls out of the sky and Sherlock catches it between his knees. In one sinuous movement, he is up and leaping across the floor, ball bouncing along the way.
When the hour arrived, in which the remains of Holmes were to be taken for ever, he went alone to the chamber to look upon his father’s countenance yet once again; and with his back pressed to the wall of the room; he recalled his father’s advice not to become insensible; he felt its lie and its cruelty.  Caring was not advantageous.
'Was it for this, Count Wilkes,' said Moriarty, in a cool sarcastic tone of voice, 'that I received you under my roof, and permitted you, though my declared enemy, to remain under it for the night? Was it, that you might repay my hospitality with the treachery of a fiend, and rob me of my family?'
Sherlock was bored by this discussion, but the tedious affair was at length settled by John, who drew the hostess aside, and desired that her sons should have the bed of skins designed for him, for that he would wrap himself in his cloak, and sleep on the bench by the cottage door.
These lines were not inscribed to any person; though Sherlock was undoubtedly the satyr of these shades; but it seemed beyond reason that any person acquainted with him should ascribe an ‘angel-smile’ to Sherlock. Not even his own parents would be so generous, he considered wryly.  The poem was therefore dismissed from his thoughts; he had other concerns in his books and his chemical studies.
Slowly, deliberately, and with iron clad self-control; John straightens up, takes his tray, says “Good night” to no one in particular and walks out of the dining hall.

As he sat musing, a peal of laughter rose from the terrace, and, on going to the casement, he saw, with inexpressible surprise, two ladies and a young man, dressed in the gala habit of Venice, walking with several gentlemen below. He gazed in an astonishment, till the group passed under his casement; and, one of the strangers looking up, he perceived the features of Signora Livona, with whose manners he had been so much charmed, the day after his arrival at Venice, and who had been there introduced at the table of Moriarty. This discovery gave Sherlock some perplexity - there was something so extraordinary in her being at this castle, circumstanced as it now was, and evidently, by the gaiety of her air, with her own consent, that a very painful deduction arose, concerning her character.
“Oh, look, there he is!” Violet sits up in her seat, waving enthusiastically down to John’s blond head below.
Adjoining the eastern side of the green-house, looking towards the plains of Languedoc, was a room, which Sherlock called his, and which contained his books, his drawings, his musical instruments, with some favourite birds and plants. Here he usually exercised himself in his studies, cultivated only because they were congenial to his taste, and in which native genius, assisted by the instructions of Monsieur Holmes, made him an early proficient. The windows of this room were particularly pleasant; they descended to the floor, and, opening upon the little lawn that surrounded the house, the eye was led between groves of almond, palm-trees, flowering-ash, and myrtle, to the distant landscape, where the Garonne wandered.
John reached out and grabbed Mike’s hand, staring into the round face of his friend. “Mike, it’s bullshit what happened. Everyone fucking hates it. Her Olympics might be fucked. But don’t let it fuck yours too. Like Lestrade says, get in the tunnel. You can’t look back in the tunnel, you can’t look around. You can only look forward.” John raised a finger in front of his face and Mike stared at it, caught between hypnosis and alarm. “Get in the tunnel, Mike. It’s tunnel time.”
Poor Sherlock is really having the Worst. Year. Ever.
In the next moment old Carlo appeared with Moriarty, who was anxious to discover by what servant the keys of the castle had been delivered to Wilkes, on the preceding night. But this man, though he was too faithful to his master quietly to see him injured, would not betray a fellow-servant even to justice; he, therefore, pretended to be ignorant who it was, that had conspired with Count Wilkes, and related, as before, that he had only overheard some of the strangers describing the plot.
: Sherlock witnesses a terrible spectacle as he continues to seek proof of Mycroft's fate.
'All this is very distressing!' said Monsieur Mycroft, with a profound sigh.
'You can never hope any thing from Moriarty,' said Wilkes, 'he has used me infamously, and my vengeance shall pursue him. And for you, Sherlock, for you, he has new plans more profitable than the last, no doubt.' The gleam of freedom, which the Count's former speech had revived, was now nearly extinguished; and, while Sherlock's countenance betrayed the emotions of his mind, Wilkes endeavoured to take advantage of the discovery.
John turns, but the Holmeses are gone, swept up in the exiting crowds.
John follows him very closely out of the lift; he’s half-pressing Sherlock into the door to his room as he opens it. Sherlock’s eyes flutter closed, it feels as if only the top half of his lungs are taking in any air; he stumbles a little as the door opens and he enters into the room. He turns to face John, who is heading into the bedroom.
Sherlock's thoughts returning to the figure he had seen, 'It cannot be a person, who has designs upon the castle,' said he; 'such a one would conduct himself very differently. He would not venture where sentinels were on watch, nor fix himself opposite to a window, where he perceived he must be observed; much less would he beckon, or utter a sound of complaint. Yet it cannot be a prisoner, for how could he obtain the opportunity to wander thus?'

‘I am, indeed I am, unequal to this moment,' replied Sherlock with a shuddering breath. ‘I do not know how to command this situation.  I cannot go with you; I cannot go with my brother and his husband. But yet I must’.
Sherlock stares out the window, feels the beginning of a dull flush creep up his neck. “No,” he says tightly.
'Well! brother, fine speaking signifies little. I am willing, in consideration of our poor parent, to overlook the impropriety of your late conduct, and to try what your future will be.'
'Well, signor!' said Monsieur Mycroft, 'I protest you are a Frenchman; I never heard a foreigner say any thing half so gallant as that!'
Sherlock dismissed Molly for the night, and sat then, musing upon his own circumstances and those of Monsieur Mycroft, till his eye rested on the miniature picture, which he had found, after his father's death, among the papers he had enjoined him to destroy. It was open upon the table, having, with some loose drawings, been taken out of a little box by Sherlock, some hours before. The sight of it called up many interesting reflections, but the melancholy sweetness of the countenance soothed the emotions, which these had occasioned. It was the same style of countenance as that of her late father, and, while he gazed on it on this account, he even fancied a resemblance in the features. But this tranquillity was suddenly interrupted, when he recollected the words in the manuscript, that had been found with this picture, and which had formerly occasioned him so much doubt and horror. At length, he roused herself from the deep reverie, into which this remembrance had thrown him; but, when he rose to undress, the silence and solitude, to which he was left, at this midnight hour, for not even a distant sound was now heard, conspired to make him wary in the extreme. Molly's hints, too, concerning this chamber, simple as they were, had not failed to affect him, since they followed a circumstance of peculiar horror, which he himself had witnessed, and since the scene of this was a chamber nearly adjoining his own.

Molly took the handkerchief from her face.
Bill stares glumly into the pile of McNuggets.
'O that the Count had resembled every other person, then!' said Sherlock bitterly.

John abruptly recalls that they are in public; the others are in team uniform; in a dining hall full of athletes, no less. Athletes even now paused mid-mouthful, forks hanging in space as they look on eagerly.

John nodded, feeling slightly ashamed about the bright yellow bottle he’d picked up at Asda for £3 before he’d flown out.  Still, needs must. “Here, can you do my back?” he said, holding it out to Sherlock and turning around.
The man made a vague hum of agreement, looking above John’s head at the crowd as it wound through the serpentine barriers, slowly being funnelled out to the stadium floor. “Rings or the High Bar?”
Molly hastened from the room; and Sherlock prepared for this unexpected flight, as fast as his trembling hands would permit, not perceiving, that any change in his situation could possibly be for the worse. He had scarcely thrown his books and clothes into the travelling trunk, when, receiving a second summons, he went down to his brother’s dressing-room, where he found Moriarty impatiently reproving his husband for delay. He went out, soon after, to give some further orders to his people, and Sherlock then enquired the occasion of this hasty journey; but Mycroft appeared to be as ignorant also, and to undertake the journey with more reluctance.
“Just a spectacular day’s sport, one of the highlights of these games, one for the ages, what a nail-biter, the adrenaline is absolutely coursing through my body Irene and I am spent, SPENT.”
'What could it be, but the noble offer of Count Wilkes,' said Moriarty, pressing his thigh against Sherlock’s.
“Sherlock Holmes, I am not your porter!” she cries, dropping her cargo.
Hatefully, some of his confusion must show on his face, because Mike starts making little shooing motions at him.
“Getting underway here with a beautiful inverted cross… moving through these strength positions, holding each for the full two seconds required… Murray of course an Olympic veteran, taking the bronze in the horizontal bar apparatus in London at the last games….”
“John, shut up.”
'Ah! it is a desolate place now,' continued La Voisin, 'and such a grand, fine place, as I remember it!' Sherlock enquired what had occasioned this lamentable change; but the old man was silent, and Sherlock, whose interest was awakened by the fear he had expressed, and above all by a recollection of his father's agitation, repeated the question, and added, 'If you are neither afraid of the inhabitants, my good friend, nor are superstitious, how happens it, that you dread to pass near that chateau in the dark?'
Let those deplore their doom,
disappointment.”
'In spite of Moriarty!' cried Sherlock eagerly: 'what is it I hear?'
Sherlock said he hoped not, but this expression of hope Molly thought implied fear, and her own increased in proportion, as Sherlock endeavoured to encourage her.
Sherlock, though he smiled at the mention of this ridiculous superstition, could not, in the present tone of his spirits, wholly resist its contagion.
Moriarty, when he removed his husband to the turret under the improbable suspicion of having attempted his life, had ordered the men employed on the occasion, to observe a strict secrecy. To this he was influenced by a double motive. He meant to debar Mycroft from the comfort of Sherlock's visits, and to secure an opportunity of privately dispatching him, should any new circumstances occur to confirm the present suggestions of his suspecting mind. With his consciousness of the hatred he deserved, it was natural enough that he should at first led him to attribute to Mycroft the attempt that had been made upon his life; and, though there was no other reason to believe that he was concerned in that atrocious design, his suspicions remained; he continued to confine him in the turret, under a strict guard; and, without pity or remorse, had suffered his husband to lie, forlorn and neglected, under a raging fever, till it had reduced him to the present state.
Wilkes's face was overspread with a momentary crimson, his eyes sparkled, but he seemed endeavouring to conquer his emotion, and replied in a calm voice, 'Since you are interested for my safety, I will regard it, and be gone. But, before I go, let me you say, that you wish me well,' said he, fixing on her an earnest and mournful look.
MACBETH
Mike swallows his mouthful and looks at him with a knowing little smile. “There’s tea in the room over there,” he says, pointing. John is suddenly stricken by terrible thirst and makes a sound of inexpressible longing. Smiling, Mike makes a shooing motion at John, and then picks up all the remaining canapes.

Sherlock was silent, unable to form a reply.
Mary pales.
Holmes lingered till about three o'clock in the afternoon, and, thus gradually sinking into death, he expired without a struggle, or a sigh.
Still with that smile, John slides one hand up his chest (rectus abdominus. Pectoralis major) and over his shoulder (deltoid), takes a gentle hold of the strap of his leotard and slides one arm out of it. Sherlock’s chest feels peculiar. John slides the other arm out of his uniform and rucks it down his body, arranging it neatly on his hips (rather low on the hip) and walking closer on the bars. It reveals a patch of purple bruising, shot through with red scrapes, the sort you might get trying not to fall off a rooftop. Sherlock wheezes in a breath of air.
(See the end of the chapter for
The dawn now began to tint the horizon, and to break upon the shores of the Adriatic. Sherlock did not venture to ask any questions of Moriarty, who sat, for some time, in gloomy silence, and then rolled himself up in his cloak, as if to sleep, while Mycroft did the same; but Sherlock, who could not sleep, undrew one of the little curtains of the gondola, and looked out upon the sea. The rising dawn now enlightened the mountain-tops of Friuli, but their lower sides, and the distant waves, that rolled at their feet, were still in deep shadow. Sherlock, sunk in tranquil melancholy, watched the strengthening light spreading upon the ocean, shewing successively Venice and her islets, and the shores of Italy, along which boats, with their pointed latin sails, began to move.
“Kate, hard to imagine a more rousing finale to these games. Young John Watson finishing with a punchy routine there, sure to leave everyone satisfied.”
They walk quickly back to the GB building, John breaking out into a laughing run when it comes into sight. Surprised, Sherlock starts to run behind him, blood pounding as he remember this; other days, nights, running back to this place. But as John looks at him, breathless and happy in the lift up to the eighth floor, he’s not sure what will happen this time.
John frowned. “Well, ah, I think Bill’s got the room bagsed,” he replied in confusion.
Molly began to talk further upon the apparition, though Sherlock made no reply. As he mused upon the circumstances of the figure having stationed itself opposite to his casement, he was again inclined to believe it was John, whom he had seen. Yet, if it was John, why did he not speak, when he had the opportunity of doing so—and, if he was a prisoner in the castle, and he could be here in no other character, how could he obtain the means of walking abroad on the rampart? Thus Sherlock was utterly unable to decide, whether the musician and the form he had observed, were the same, or, if they were, whether this was John.
'All in good time, ma'am; all this I heard before at Venice, but what is to come I never heard till to-day. This happened a great many years ago, when Signor Moriarty was quite a young man. The lady—they called her Signora Irene, was very handsome, but she used to be in great passions, too, sometimes, as well as the Signor. Finding he could not make her listen to him—what does he do, but leave the castle, and never comes near it for a long time! but it was all one to her; she was just as unhappy whether he was here or not, till one evening, Holy St. Peter! Monsieur,' cried Molly, 'look at that lamp, see how blue it burns!' She looked fearfully round the chamber. 'Ridiculous girl!' said Sherlock, 'why will you indulge those fancies? Pray let me hear the end of your story, I am weary.'
John flicked through his phone – Mary had posted the shot with Sherlock from yesterday. “Practice makes perfect with #sherlockholmes! @britishgymnasticsofficial first male #rythmicgymnastics competitor!  #noreally #imserious #TeamGB #rio2016 #olympics” and then the usual bunch of emojis, finishing with a little rainbow at the end. John scowled at the phone. Well that seemed… rude, unnecessary.
Olympiad were on.
'I have no reason to doubt either,' replied Sherlock. 'Of the first, indeed, I cannot doubt, but I have not deduced anything of the latter, and I entreat you will tell me all you have heard.'
Moriarty was alone. 'I sent for you,' said he, 'to give you another opportunity of retracting your late mistaken assertions concerning the Languedoc estates. I will condescend to advise, where I may command.—If you are really deluded by an opinion, that you have any right to these estates, at least, do not persist in the error—an error, which you may perceive, too late, has been fatal to you. Dare my resentment no further, but sign the papers.'

Sherlock, disgusted with this show of dramatics, was about to withdraw from the corridor, when a message from Moriarty commanded him to do so, and also that the Count, if he was not already gone, should quit the castle immediately. Indignation flashed from Wilkes's eyes, and flushed his cheeks.
“Oh!” John said, feeling on firmer ground. “Are you collecting them?”
John, perceiving it necessary to vindicate Sherlock from such a design, explained, that the purpose of his own visit had been to request an interview with Moriarty; but his explanations were answered with severe rebuke; Mycroft lamented again, that his prudence had ever yielded to what he termed compassion, and added, that he was so sensible of the folly of his former consent, that, to prevent the possibility of a repetition, he had committed the affair entirely to the conduct of Signor Moriarty.
One such evening, having successfully extricated himself from accompanying his brother out, he thus withdrew to the pavilion.  His thoughts were with John, of whom he had heard nothing since his arrival at Tholouse, and now that he was removed from him, and in his uncertainty, Sherlock perceived all the interest John held in his heart. Before he saw John he had never met a mind and taste so suited to his own.  Monsieur Mycroft had of late told him much of the dissimulating ways of men and of Sherlock’s own undesirability, and the possibility his brother might be right; and John wrong in his esteem of Sherlock was sufficient to harass his mind with anxiety.  Sherlock found that few conditions are more painful than that of uncertainty as to the merit of a beloved object; an uncertainty, which he would not have suffered, had his confidence in his own opinions been greater.
'Well, Molly’, said Sherlock, bored by this subject ‘it was very prudent of you not to mention it then: be as prudent now; the subject is an unpleasant one.'
'At this moment, indeed, I feel more than ever the value of the retirement I solicited.’ Sherlock snapped.
'Twenty years, sir, or thereabout, as they tell me; I know it is a long while ago.' Sherlock continued to gaze upon the portrait.
John sighed, absentmindedly rubbing his shoulder. Gymnastics had been his life almost as long as he could remember – and in less than seventy-two hours he’d be finished his last competition and his gymnastics career would be over. If he was lucky, a few years of flogging breakfast cereal or toothpaste while he studied…would that pay the bills?  Or was it a career of professionally getting shot at?  John chewed on the side of his thumb, looking down at the vaulting platform below.
John was a stranger to the gradual progress of scheme and intrigue, against which he could not be on his guard. He had not been accustomed to receive ridicule, and he could ill endure its sting; he resented it, and this only drew upon him a louder laugh. To escape from such scenes, he fled into solitude, and there the image of Sherlock met him, and revived the pangs of love and despair. To forget himself and the grief and anxiety, which the idea of Sherlock then recalled, he would quit his solitude, and again mingle in the crowd—glad of a temporary relief, and rejoicing to snatch amusement for the moment.

“Oblige me,” John said, making clear there would be no discussion.
“Pish!” Sieger says over the hum of the hand dryers. “There’s plenty of space near us, you must come back with me. Vi has been looking out for you, you know.” The look he gives John indicates that no-one ever disappoints Sherlock’s mum. Not without, and this is very clear in the look, Consequences.
Sherlock could not look at these presents, and made a last, though almost hopeless, effort to interest the compassion of Mycroft, who, if he did feel any degree of pity, or remorse, successfully concealed it, and reproached his brother with folly in being miserable, concerning a marriage, which ought only to make him happy. 'I am sure,' said he, 'if I was unmarried, and the Count had proposed to me, I should have been flattered by the distinction: and if I should have been so, I am sure, little brother, you, who have no fortune, ought to feel yourself highly honoured, and shew a proper gratitude and humility towards the Count, for his offer. I can assure you, Sherlock, you will not meet with many such suitors as the Count: every other person would have turned upon their heel, and left you to repent at your leisure, long ago.'
Sherlock, whom Molly had now infected with her own terrors, listened attentively; but every thing was still, and Molly proceeded:
.  Women after my own heart.
I leave that flowery path for eye
“Seems a bit quiet, doesn’t it?  Thought they’d be a bit flashier,” remarked Mike to his right at the end of the routine. “Think all those ribbon drops are more of a worry though,” replied John, flexing the expertise gained from a half-hour’s spectating.
“And the double front half there for the dismount, Kate, and look at the height on that, textbook dismount, and Kate, that might be enough. Some deductions there certainly in some of those handstands but that was a much more difficult routine than we’ve seen from Watson I think ever, he’s certainly pulled that one right out of his hat.”
