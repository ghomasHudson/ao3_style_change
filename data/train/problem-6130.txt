"So, your name is Antonio, right?" Steve asked, making sure to pronounce his words clearly enough for the boy to understand, but not too clear to make it too obvious and make the kid feel stupid.
"It's nothing," he said, slightly embarrassed. Languages had never been very hard for him, no one had really praised him for it, except for the Jarvis couple.
"But, but you never understand me," Tony whispered, another tear escaping his eyes as he curled into Steve's protective hold. The voices could never get him when Steve was holding him.
Tony blushed and muttered something under his breath before getting up to wash his face. But Natasha had one more question left.
"Alright. Yeah, I guess you're right," he agreed, a little awkwardly. He was reluctant to leave knowing Tony might be uncomfortable or unsafe in there, but there was nothing he could do without any proof. "Well, goodnight."
"Leave it," Tony's voice shouted from the halls. Peter made a 'sorry' motion towards the spilled coffee before speeding off after his mentor.
"Really?" He said, gesturing with his hands. "How many times do I have to tell you, Dum-E, I don't drink oil," Dum-E made a beeping noise, somehow causing Tony to sigh again.
"What?" He couldn't help but ask. Tony still didn't look up, rubbing at his face as he wracked his brain to a way to avoid this conversation.
Tony made a soft noise in his sleep as he shifted to lean into Steve's warmth a bit more, shifting around a bit before settling comfortably against the big soldier. Steve smiled goofily and decided he wasn't complaining.
Thank you all so much for all the kindness I received on the first chapter! It really means a lot to me.
Steve was kneeling beside it, his hands hovering above Tony's lifeless form as if not sure if he could touch him or not. Peter carefully approached, praying to no one in particular as he kneeled down and put a finger against his mentor's neck. He closed his eyes and held his breath as his fingers softly touched Tony's neck. He breathed out a sigh of relief when he felt a gentle thudding against his fingers. He did realize it was too slow.
When they were seemingly done, Peter put it back on his wrist with a smooth motion as Tony put the target, which was a simple cup, back on the table. He gave Peter a thumbs up and went to stand behind him. Peter again took a deep breath, again followed by a similar motion and a string shooting from his wrist. Only this time, the cup didn't fall on the ground. This time, it was stuck against the wall by what seemed like a spider web. Steve thought it had looked a lot like a web-grenade, as it wasn't attached to a long string it usually had.
Antonio carefully took a seat, curled into himself slightly to make himself appear even smaller than he already was. Ms. Hill started talking at the front of the class but Steve was focused on the conversation between his childhood friend and the new kid.
Steve bent down to gently take Tony's head and place it on his lap. He softly stroked some blood-soaked hair from the billionaire's forehead.
"Good," the assassin said suddenly, getting up and ruffling Peter's hair. "Now, while they talk that out, I suggest we do the
When Tony greeted him in the lab, neither mentioned it. Tony seemed so relaxed, Peter didn't feel right asking about the moment he and Rogers had shared. He supposed the two must have become friends, despite their history.
"I've heard it's Tony," Tony replied softly, smiling kindly. Peter gave a quick smile back, more a tilt of his lips. He bit his bottom lip, clenching his eyes shut as he looked down. Tony gave him a concerned look, gently reaching out. "Hey, Peter," he called softly. "Can you take my hand, please?"
"Please, put down," the small brunet said softly. Bruce put the plates on the counter. Immediately, Tony walked over and took the plates, walking back to the table to set them down. Bruce frowned at the sight in confusion.
"It was right after I had brought you home. Clint commented on how much you apparently look like me. Wanda, she- well let's just say she was in a bad mood."
"Y-yes. I mean, no-" he stuttered, a blush coloring his cheeks. Tony gave him an amused look, his brown eyes twinkling. "I mean, I heard some noises from my apartment -I live below you- and I was just- I just wanted to check- to see if you're, uh, alright?"
"Hey, Tony?" He called softly. Tony's big, red eyes met his as he sniffled softly. "How about we just watch a movie until the others come home, does that sound okay?" Tony nodded and maneuvered himself over to sit in front of the TV while still somehow keeping his grip on Steve's shirt. They watched Disney movies for the rest of the day until the others came home with a lot of cheerful noise, which died down when they saw Steve and Tony on the couch.
"Steve?" He croaked softly, blinking his eyes back into focus. He saw Steve's relieved face staring back at him, holding his hands firmly but gently in his own. They weren't strange hands. His eyes weren't the dark, threatening orbs of his scattered memories. His words weren't slurred and painful towards him. He looked worried, and he seemed to care. Of course he cared. It was
Tony didn't want to be weird. He wanted to be normal, just like the other kids. He didn't want to be smart if it made people run away from him. He didn't want bigger kids to pick on him. He didn't want his
"Hey, please," he panted, the hand pressing painfully on his chest. "Please, stop," he begged. He didn't know what he'd done wrong, so he didn't know how to make it right, either.
After homeroom ended, Steve spotted the new kid standing by the wall, staring at his schedule with a frown, clearly confused. No one seemed to be willing to help him, and when the boy looked around with slightly panicked eyes, it didn't seem like he could ask for help, either. Quickly, Steve approached him.
"Bye, Tony," Steve waved back, watching the door close once again. He sighed, shoulders slumping as he looked at the hard wooden door. He knew Tony was behind it, but he didn't know how to make him see that Steve was there for him-
"As soon as the doctors discharge you," Steve said sternly, all too used to Tony sneaking out of medical prematurely. Tony groaned dramatically as he leaned back into the pillows, looking exactly like the Tony Stark they all knew and loved.
Steve didn't know what to say. He didn't like how Tony sounded. It's like he was a whole different person. It made Steve's stomach churn, a heavy feeling settling in like stone.
"Peter, I would suggest you calm down before entering the main area," Peter heard F.R.I.D.A.Y say from her spot inside the walls of the compound. Peter could swear she was resisting a chuckle, if that was even possible. Well, it was Tony Stark, who knew...
. Sure, Tony had been the cause of tears to her innocent boy, but more important than that, he had made a smile as big as the universe appear on the teen's face, just by saying something as simple as
"You asked me to alert you, sir. I am alerting you, sir," FRIDAY simply replied with her most emotionless voice, causing Tony to come to a halt, making a face.
"Oh, you have science! There's a really nice kid in your class, Bruce. He will gladly help you if you ask."
"No!" Tony said, louder this time. Steve took a physical step back. He'd never seen the usually so cheery boy get angry.
"You didn't let him down, Steve," Nat said gently. Steve was surprised, he'd expected her to get mad at him. "You can't just make yourself love him, that's just not possible. And Tony's smart, he knows that too. But Steve, Tony doesn't hate you."
"I'm sorry," Tony sobbed, giving up on the futile effort of sounding American. It wasn't good enough anyway.
, Steve," he whispered brokenly, and Steve felt a wet spot forming on his shirt from Tony's tears. Tony never actually cried, getting defensive and snappy instead. So Steve knew Tony was really tired, and really sick if his emotions got the better of him so quickly. "I don't want to let them all down, you know? But no matter how hard I try, I just can't do it, Steve. I can't do it..." He broke off into soft sobs that had Steve's heart break and he quickly pulled the smaller man against him, holding him close.
Steve immediately started yelling through the comms but Peter was frozen. He looked into the distance where he knew his mentor was, currently fighting for his life. He didn't know how much time passed, it all seemed to go so fast, but at the same time, it was as if everything was moving in slow-motion.
I'm so so sorry for always leaving you guys hanging, it's just hard to get myself to write this story. But I still love it, so I wanted to get something out before the year was over.
echoed around in his head. He decided it was just in a friendly matter and he quickly grabbed his backpack and sprinted up the stairs. This was one of the most surprising things he'd seen in his life, and he'd seen aliens attack New York.
"Don't forget to breathe, kid," Tony said with a completely straight face, which only made Peter laugh harder. And, to be fair, Steve's face was hilarious.
"Follow me," Coulson said before leaving the principal's office, Tony hurrying after him. They were silent on the way there. Tony was a bit confused but also too shy to ask questions. Soon they exited the large school building and were walking across the open space Tony had spent lunch with Steve and the others. Once they reached the other side, Tony saw staircases leading towards what looked a lot like apartment doors. Some students were milling about on the stairs or crossing over to each other's rooms. Coulson led Tony up two staircases and two doors down, almost at the end of the hall, before they came to a halt in front of door 203. A quick look told Tony this hall started at 204 and ended at 200. He figured that if he crossed the bridge-like connection between this hall and the next, it would continue counting up.
"Well, guess I'll leave you two to it," Clint said, starting to get up. Tony grabbed his arm, stopping him. He was looking at Steve with steel in his eyes.
Peter tensed, Cap rarely called the billionaire by his first name in battle. It was usually just 'Iron Man'.
"Very mature, Buck." Bucky just shot him a stupid grin before resuming his paper ball-fight with Natasha, another one of their friends.
"Do you speak more languages?" Natasha joined the conversation. Tony seemed to turn a bit shy at talking to someone he didn't know, but he nodded anyway.
"That's it, I'm taking you to the vet," Tony decided out loud, grabbing Ana's leash. He hesitated as he saw her vest before deciding it wasn't necessary, leaving it behind. He walked back to his dog, talking softly to her. He didn't know if he was reassuring her or himself. He picked up his phone to look for the nearest animal shelter, sighing in relief when he saw there was one not too far away.
"No," was all he said. Bruce was just wondering if he'd said something wrong when the teacher demanded their attention. Soon enough the boy was over it and back to his cheeky old self, mixing Italian with English as he talked about science. By the time they were halfway through the period, Bruce too had forgotten all about it as he allowed himself to be frazzled by the young boy's genius. He was almost sad when class ended and they were instructed to get their dorms ready and meet their housemates.
"Sir, there is an alert of a troublemaker causing trouble in the city," FRIDAY alerted the three people standing in the kitchen. Tony sighed, putting down his coffee.
"I'm out," Loki said suddenly, laying his last card on the table and showing his empty hands with a smirk.
"Oh," he said intelligently, blinking up at the door and the shiny letters saying 'Principal Fury'. Bruce knocked on the door, and Tony was surprised to see Ms. Hill when it opened. She looked at Bruce in silent question, who redirected her gaze to a fidgeting Tony.
"A dorm is where you live when you're not in school. You have your own room, and you share your kitchen and living room with four other kids in your dorm. Don't worry, everyone has switched dorms since last year so you're not the only one who has to adjust."
"Alright, um," he thought for a second. He seemed to have thought of something as the tips of his ears turned pink and he scratched his neck (which Tony didn't find attractive. At all). "I guess my most embarrassing moment must have been when I told my crush I liked him,"
"Oh, right. Sorry." Steve jumped up, unlocking the door. Nat gave him an unimpressed look, one eyebrow raised. Steve didn't even smile sheepishly, just dropped back into his bed. Natasha frowned.
"Hey there," she said. Steve grunted in return, not fully trusting his voice. "So... I saw what happened. That was pretty dumb." Steve scoffed.
He shot up straight when he heard voices from the room on top of his. He heard noises there more often- he knew who lived there. He'd met the two college boys when they just moved in. One was about Steve's age, big and slightly rude. Steve remembered his name being Ty... Tyson? Tiberius! That's it. Tiberius Stone. The other was younger and smaller and kind of cute. Tony, he remembered. They argued at times, and Steve heard their voices through the thin ceiling. But this time, it sounded like the boy, Tony, had been crying.
"Hey," he greeted. The boy looked up at him, then looked around as if Steve might be talking to someone else before realizing Steve'd addressed
Too worried to fall back asleep, he got out of bed, tiptoeing through his room to put on some more presentable clothes, suddenly hyper-aware of his looks. Shaking his head with a sigh, he left his apartment.
"I can drive him," Steve offered immediately. He still felt guilty for not noticing Tony's absence earlier. Tony was always so on time for their shared classes, he should've checked it out sooner. He wanted to do what he could to help.
"Hey, are you okay, Tony?" Steve asked again as Tony's frantic gaze kept scanning their surroundings. He looked... Scared.
"Excuse me?" He asked, unable to keep the grin out of his voice. "Did America's golden boy do something illegal?"
Tony hesitantly closed his eyes, subconsciously leaning into Steve's warmth as he focused on his breathing until it slowed enough that he could take a full breath. Gently, Steve pulled him into his arms, whispering a constant string of what he hoped were calming words in the boy's ear until his breathing had returned to normal and his tears were reduced to sniffles. Neither pulled away, even as Steve spoke again.
Peter hurried over to flop down on the couch, taking a bowl with snacks on his way there. He offered Tony some, who was quick to refuse.
"Why do you hate it so much?" She asked. "When people call you dumb. Why do you hate it? You're the smartest person I've ever met. Why are you still so bothered by that lie?"
Hill nodded and disappeared into one of the other rooms. Fury got up with a grunt, moving one of the paintings of someone Tony didn't recognize, revealing a large safe. He punched in a code and opened the safe to reveal rows of keyholders, most of which were empty. He took out one set of keys, closed the door and covered it back up with the painting. Noticing Tony's stare, he explained.
"I'll call you in sick. It's not like you'll miss much, aren't you ahead at pretty much every subject?"
Tony didn't really know what he meant but nodded anyway, hoping that was good enough. Fury held out the key for him to take and Tony hesitated. Fury raised an eyebrow.
"Well, that was quite something," a feminine voice from behind him said. Bucky laughed at Natasha's words.
"Tony, you don't have to do this for everyone," he said, his fingers still playing with Tony's curls. "It's okay not to be okay, sometimes. Everyone has their limit, and it would be unfair to ask you to cross it. So don't, Tony. Come upstairs with me, we'll lay in bed and I'll give you
By the time he arrived at the scene, paramedics were taking care of the injured as firemen tried to put out the fire. The young web-slinger saw the Captain's shield on the ground, its owner already in- no,
He was vaguely aware of someone talking to him but the sound was muffled as if he was hearing it from underwater-
The only thing that had been able to calm her down enough to think straight again, were his abilities. His amazing reflexes, his so-called 'spidey sense', his fast healing- it kept him safe from the worst. Of course, she had been
The kiss lasted way longer than necessary. When they finally pulled back, both men were grinning as their foreheads rested together.
"Hm?" Steve hummed in response, his hands carding through Tony's hair, mindful of the injury on the man's head.
Steve didn't know what he'd expected to see when a customer came in at 7.00 in the morning, but a cute, young man with wide, brown eyes and tousled hair was definitely not high on his list of expectations. He'd actually been openly staring until the man stuttered out a polite question.
, even if he didn't know where that was. Something about the hospital made him feel uneasy and alone.)
Tony turned around and felt like he was going to cry. Right there, pillow in his hand and with a shocked look on his face was none other than Steve.
"Yeah, it is. Point is, if you talk to someone about what's bothering you, they can help you with it." He said carefully, hoping his message would come across.
Steve impatiently rode the elevator up to the second floor, feeling jittery. He shivered in the cold air of the apartment building, tucking his hands into his vest pockets. The doors opened, and he walked over to the room he knew was Tony's, hesitating. Was this an invasion of the boy's privacy? Surely not, he assured himself. He's just checking up to see if he's alright. He took a deep breath and knocked.
Tony's eyes widened and his breath got stuck in his throat. He failed. He hadn't been able to learn proper English after all. He just sounded
under his breath as he clung to her. She gently rocked him back and forth as he cried, stroking his back and gently playing with his curls.
"Mr. Stark, don't go in!" Peter exclaimed, just barely dodging a random loose robot-arm one of the metal creatures had thrown at him in clear desperation.
Steve smiled down at his sleeping beauty in his arms, a warm feeling in his chest. He placed a tender kiss in the engineer's curls, inhaling his sweet scent.
"Of course, Tony. Anytime," Steve assured him kindly, resisting the urge to just lean forward and kiss him. "And until you're ready to talk about it, well... I guess it must've just been the wind."
"Fine, kid," he said. Peter crossed his arms, giving his mentor an unbelieving look. Tony couldn't help but chuckle at the sight, but it quickly faded again and he ran a hand down his face. "We should, ehm, you know, just get going with eh-"
Natasha opened the door to Tony's dorm, knowing that's where he would go. She quietly closed the door behind her and made her way towards Tony's room. The door was ajar, and she pushed it open, expecting to see the young boy on his bed. She didn't expect to see him frantically throw his clothes into his suitcase, furiously wiping away the stubborn tears from his eyes.
As the friends grow closer over the next few weeks, they find out more about Tony and Tony about them. They quickly found out he was basically a genius, loved building things, was prone to get in trouble, shy but brave, and fiercely loyal to those he let close to him. He was also intent on helping out his friends in any way that he could, so he'd offered to help Steve with Maths. Steve, wanting to do something in return, had offered to teach him English. He was amazed at how well Tony was picking it up. Even though he still made mistakes in his grammar, his vocabulary had expanded immensely and he could easily follow conversations.
He was greeted by a comically large Christmas tree that took up so much space it honestly boggled his mind as to how Tony had gotten it inside. “Tony… you do know it’s August, right?” His tone was dubious - it wouldn’t have
“No,” Steve said firmly. “You’re not starting the day with more cookies, you can have breakfast and we’ll see if you can have another one later.” The sweet tooth the damn kid had was mindblowing. Nat was already starting to whine, but Steve shook his head again, already heading towards the corner of the living room they’d designated as a play area for her. “Nope. No tears, that doesn’t get us treats, right? Right. How about some blocks, carrot top?”
stunned him to find out Tony had gotten too involved in a project and just forgotten, but it would have been cause for concern, to say the least.
“So you believe Captain Rogers to be a competent parent?” the judge clarified. She had gentle eyes, too. Steve thought that she must have seen a lot, working these kinds of cases.
“Well, if he wants to blow all that progress, it’d be a shame,” Bucky said with a grin. “Personally, I value our friendship- ow!”
“I’ll come in a little,” Steve assured her. “Just a minute, go eat.” When she’d bounced away, Steve turned back to Tasha. “I know this is a lot to take in,” he said.
“Mm, is that so? When will that be?” She adjusted her glasses. “I don’t ask for my personal curiosity. My reservations about granting custody to you are mostly about the risk that your very team and title surely must incur.”
Nat folded her arms over her chest - god, it was so strange to see his mannerisms mirrored in this funny kid - and tapped her foot. “How long are you gonna think about it, Dad?”
“The...the thing is,” Steve said, muddling through the words. “I don’t know how to be a dad.” Tony didn’t say anything, and Steve kept going, pushing the words out like bullets from a wound. “I have no idea what doing it right looks like. My dad was an alcoholic shithead who beat the fuck out of me any chance he got, Bucky’s dad died in the war. Wasn’t like I had an abundance of chances to learn from example. I just - I love her and I want what’s best for her. I don’t know if that means me.” Silence stretched between them. “Tony?”
Tasha just stared, taking in the little girl who was both herself and not. “Hi,” she managed to say. “I’m… Natasha.”
Ian did not understand the whooping and cheering, or why everyone was so thrilled about a piece of paper - but he could see Nat laughing, and Papa smiling, and he could feel Daddy hugging him tight, telling him that he was loved, sweet boy, and Ian smiled too.
When Steve looked around at his family, when he held his husband's hand and listened to their kids laugh, he felt a peace settle over him, and it was
Steve kissed him until they were both breathless, and when the kiss broke, Tony wiped the tears off Steve's cheeks with gentle fingers. “The tree has to go,” Steve choked. “But yes.” His brushed gold ring was made from one of Tony’s suits. Tony’s was made in the same style, brushed vibranium scraped out from the shield Sam had inherited.
“Captain, you’ve gotten glowing comments from everyone here,” she said. “I don’t want to downplay how much I take that into account but I do have some concerns. Would you classify yourself still as active in your role, ah… Avenging?”
“Well, I have a really nice deep conditioner I use every few days. I’m not an animal,” Bucky said, as he tied his hair back up. “Still good for lunch next week?”
Tasha knelt in front of them. “They did that to me, too,” she told the little girl. “But I survived it. You did too.”
” he murmured, cradling her as he carried her back to her bedroom. “Deep breaths, babygirl, you’re okay.”
hi all! wow, what a pandemic we're having, on top of other things :{ yikes. hopefully you enjoy this chapter :)
Tasha leaned her head on his shoulder. “All I ever wanted was to belong somewhere loving and safe like this. That’s why this team...why it’s so important to me.” She exhaled, wiping off her face. “I guess if parent trapping you and Tony is what it takes,” she teased.
Steve suppressed a groan, but Nat’s head perked right up. He didn’t love the idea of her starting her day with a load of sugar...but still. Clint had been her best friend. He wanted to know her, even the miniature version of her.
Nat blinked at him grumpily, turning her face against Steve’s chest. Steve grimaced sympathetically. “It takes a bit to get used to,” he agreed. “Nat, say hi.”
“If I don’t get to punch Barnes, nobody does,” Sam said. “I deserve to punch him more than anyone here. Also, it’s a bad example for Nat, she’s punchy these days.”
He couldn’t see Tony’s face, but he could feel the other man slump against him, his nose pressed against Steve’s back. “Ugh,” he mumbled, his voice muffled. “Am I really the bad guy for not wanting to see her get flipped on her back?”
.” Steve smiled a little, carding his fingers through her hair to undo the tangles. “You’re good and safe in here.”
Nat still had bad nights, here and there. The frequency of them had dwindled dramatically, but it still happened. It was technically Tony’s turn to get her, but Steve rolled out of bed when he heard Nat’s scream. Sometimes Steve was still the only one who could calm her down, and judging by the pitch and volume, it seemed like tonight might be one of those nights.
Steve smiled at Pepper, trying not to think about how fucking awkward it was to hang out casually. He knew he ought to be more of an adult about it by now, but what was he really supposed to say?
Their looks of pity throughout the days confirm it all. No wonder why they have been acknowledging him and interacting with him. They’ve been friendly. They’ve been talking in hushed voices and keeping him company. This wasn’t the case back in the tower—back before they knew what they now do. Back then, it was
Tony gasped. The words had felt like a soothing rain that put the fire out and soothed his heated, blistered skin. All he wanted was to bask in its droplets as they felt like gentle kisses, and this is how he found himself hugging the soldier and holding onto his red cotton clad figure as he sobbed.
His blurry vision could make out Tony’s body moving to lay by his side; his wet cheeks could feel warm hands cup them and wipe the wetness away; his ears could hear Tony’s soft voice speak words of comfort; his heart could beat a little steadier through the panic upon the sight of the glowing blue.
Steve, Clint, Bruce, and Natasha exchanged looks of concern, with Steve’s face not being entirely surprised since he had already known of the abuse Tony went through during his time in Afghanistan, but it did break his heart to hear Tony cry in his sleep for his captors to not hit him again, to not touch him again, to not rape him again...
Clint and Thor were in the library room searching for a photo of the young version of the genius but failed. “We should break into his room already,” Clint moaned in defeat as he made his way to the living room.
Blinking a few times, he could see that the figures were not of Middle-Eastern men, but of the Avengers. He looked down to his lap in search for the car battery he was sure he was holding, turns out he had ripped a hard pillow open. The man holding on to him was Rhodey, who immediately removed his hand from atop the arc reactor upon seeing Tony’s unseeing, glazed eyes focus again. The mental turmoil wore the brunet down, and he slumped against the wall as he heaved. “Tony?” Rhodey tried. “You here?”
“Let me guess, business in Gulmira plummeted again. They diverted from the contract recently, didn’t they? That’s why you bombed them?”
No amount of work binges or movie nights with the rest of the team could distract him. Resorting for alcohol had struck his mind, but then the reminder of him doing so well so far without a drop of that stuff quickly silenced the former thought. The days went by awfully slow, but he counted his resistance of self-destructive coping mechanisms as small victories, and in his head, Steve was cheering for him.
Summoned by her name, the little girl came flying across the room, only stopping short when she caught sight of the stranger. Steve beckoned her closer. “C’mere, carrot top. I want you to meet somebody.”
“No,” Tony interjected, “there’s evidence they tested the weapon before they used it and they say ‘desired results’ enough that it seems like they had to have known what it did, and maybe even tweaked it a little.”
As she strode out of the door, he was struck for a moment, thinking that if Peggy and Pepper had ever gotten to meet, they’d probably have liked each other quite a lot.
Nat was pouting moodily, and protested with a loud ‘niet’ as he set her down. Sensing an oncoming fit, Steve sat crosslegged so she could curl up in his lap like an angry cat. Nat sat on his knee and set about taking every toy in the box out. Clint came and sat nearby, helping take things out of the box with her.
She liked the safety of the curtained-off space the same way Ian did. Steve climbed inside and pulled the curtain shut so Nat could catch her breath. Steve held her snuggled up against him, her hand holding on tightly to his shirt. She still shook in his arms, sometimes, and it never failed to break his heart. Steve kissed her head and told her he loved her, hummed to her softly until she calmed down. Steve tucked the blanket in around her as she hugged Widow tightly to her chest.
“Okay, Ian,” he said, closing the last book. “We’re not gonna do any hallway wandering tonight. You’ve got your cozy bed, and you’ve got to get some good sleep if you’re gonna keep up with Nat tomorrow.”
May didn't even know how he had come up with that but left the teenager to freak out in peace, walking down the stairs to make them some food before he would be picked up. She was happy with the way things had turned out, she just wished Ben had been here to see it. She wasn't a big fan of Stark at first, interrupting their little lives. It had been hard for her to get around well enough to feed all of them, especially when Ben died. So when Tony Stark had come barging in with all his flair wasn't really what she had been looking for. The only reason she didn't ask him politely to leave, was because he seemed to make Peter happy. And a happy Peter was a happy May.
"Where's the emergency?!" Yelled Steve as he ran into the lab, a fire extinguisher upside-down in his hands. He stopped dead in his tracks when he saw two pairs of brown eyes looking at him, both men raising an eyebrow at him.
"He-help!" He yelled, stumbling back up again and yelling at the paramedics he knew were on the other side of the brick hill. "Help me, someone's injured! We need help!"
When she'd finally gotten hold of Happy, she had yelled the poor man's ear off (she still felt bad for that), and demanded to speak to Stark. When she was finally done screaming, Happy had answered in an emotionless
"...and this is the communal area," Peter finished, finally done with his tour. None of it struck Tony as familiar, but he wasn't too worried. Especially when Steve was holding him protectively by his side like that.
Tony didn't seem to fully understand but he didn't protest when Steve put a protective arm around his shoulders and gently guided him towards the doors. Steve kept softly talking to him as it seemed to calm the boy down, even if he didn't understand.
Tony protested weakly, although he barely got a word out of his mouth before he was coughing again, leaning into Steve in exhaustion.
He probably would've listed up more, but he was cut off by a coughing fit that shook his entire body and had him groaning in pain once it was over. Now Steve knew why he was sick.
Happy just shook this head, mumbled something under his breath and drove the car around. He had already forgotten about the boy before he had even disappeared out of sight.
"What?" He squeaked. He closed his eyes, giving himself a mental face-palm and cursing his voice in the foulest language he could conjure up in his pure mind. "I didn't call anyone, what-"
The kiss ended but the couple didn't break apart, Tony nuzzling his face in the blonde's neck as the soldier cuddled him close. Peter felt a smile forming on his lips as he watched how relaxed his mentor was in Steve's arms. He looked happy. And a happy Tony was a happy Peter.
It was such an innocent question, yet it was the last push Steve needed to rush over and drop himself in the chair by the bed, cradling Tony's hand softly in his own.
They were juniors this year, and so that meant they were a very adult class. So when the teacher was late, they started throwing papers at each other. You know, like adults do.
"I'm Tony. I don't remember shit, and I'm very confused. Think you can help me out?" Tony asked casually. Peter gave a wet laugh.
Tony stopped with whatever he had been doing, laying it back down on the workbench as he turned around, seemingly thinking it over.
The last part was mumbled softly, but Steve and Peter both had super hearing, and they easily caught what he'd said.
"Wa- how?! This is the first time you guys played this game!" He screeched. "How can you win from me already?!"
"Operation wingmen is ago," Clint said dramatically. Bucky and Natasha smirked, watching through the window as Tony laughed at something Steve said, looking far more comfortable than he had since he'd walked in.
There was a soft knock on the door which had both men look up. Steve was standing awkwardly in the doorway, looking way too much like a kicked puppy.
I'm so sorry for not updating for so long, I just got really sick and I had to catch up with a lot of schoolwork so I didn't really have time to write. Don't worry, this story is still active. I'm not sure if I like my writing style in this particular work but excited comments give me motivation :)
"By his father?" Steve just nodded. He knew Bruce understood, more than any of them. Bruce muttered a shaky "oh, God," under his breath, covering his mouth with his hand as he looked down. Even Natasha, usually so unreadable, had a sad look on her face. She gently rubbed Bruce's arm, knowing this news hit close to home. None of them wanted to see their new friend suffering and the news was hard to take. Surprisingly, Clint stood up first.
"Tony, do you understand the game?" Steve asked kindly once he noticed. He was surprised when Tony bit his lip, fiddling with his hands as if he was...
This caused Peter to look back, stumbling over to the two as fast as he could. Tony was breathing shallow, uneven and uneasy breaths, but it was an improvement from the lifeless look he'd had before.
That's when Natasha got it. Tony was insecure about his accent and the grammatical errors he made in English. Steve pointing it out to him, calling him
“That’s never going to happen again,” he promised her, giving Tasha a confused look as he comforted the little girl. “You’re safe here. I promise.”
Pepper and Bucky were laughing in the kitchen together, and Tony looked absolutely peeved about this development in their relationship.
“God, Nat’s already ruined there,” Steve griped. “Can’t count the number of times I’ve cussed a blue streak in front of her. Sometimes because of her. She’s gonna sound like a sailor before she’s in kindergarten.”
Humming, Clint nodded. “Damn, yeah, didn’t think of that. Just let me know if it gets better and you think it’d be okay to send her out to the farm, we’ll always be okay to take her.”
“Nat,” he sighed, setting down the dish he’d just dried to face her. “If this is something you really want to try, Papa and I are willing to listen and think about it.”
“Nothing? Nothing, Tony? I am a hundred year old combat vet living in a special operations team base with no experience at all with kids. This is - I am - they’d be crazy to even listen to me.”
Having her back felt like the last puzzle piece falling into place. Tasha was a natural with Nat and Ian - due to practice with Clint’s kids, she insisted. She and Bucky began to develop a real friendship, beyond their scattered memories of one another. The Bartons came up on vacation, and Ian was thrilled to see Aunt ‘Wawa’ again.
God, how was he ever supposed to get mad at him? “Hugs first,” he agreed softly, pulling him into his arms. “I love you, little guy.” Steve snuggled with him until Ian’s body started to go limp with sleep. Steve kissed him goodnight and tucked him in, hoping that he’d be more inclined to stay in bed tonight.
She didn’t seem to think any of that, crossing the room to give him a hug. “Steve! I’m great. Good to see you. You seem like you’re doing well.”
“Nat, how about you go have some breakfast with Ian and me?” Tony suggested smoothly, patting Steve’s shoulder as he stood.
Tasha was sitting in the living room on a couch, hunched over a tablet. Steve had only ever seen Tasha cry once, when they’d thought Fury had died. But sitting here now, half-curled into Clint’s lap, her eyes were red and her lashes were wet.
Clint nodded a little. “I’m glad you didn’t, but I don’t blame you for being freaked out. A kid is...y’know. A lot. Even if you’re planning on having one. Especially if you’re not.”
Nat had done surprisingly well in kindergarten. She was a little old for her class, and would turn seven a few months into first grade, but her ‘late start’ in life had made Steve hesitant to send her early. Besides, Tony told him, November birthdays were always either the youngest or earliest. And, more importantly to Steve, she was thriving. She’d made some friends and had done well picking up her letters and numbers and shapes. Steve hadn’t worried about that. She was a smart girl. Maybe too smart for her own good.
Sorry for how long it's been between updates! I got graduated, moved somewhere new, and started a new job :0 It's been a bit of a ride.
They laughed and swapped ‘my dumb three year old’ stories for a while, but all Steve could think about was how much he felt like he’d dodged a bullet. Even in her cranky post-nap whining, Steve brushed the knots out of her hair and wondered why he felt like he’d almost lost something precious. She’d turned his life into a mess, a goddamned mess. He constantly was worried he was going to ruin her. He couldn’t do anything without thinking about how it would affect her. He barely thought about anything except the kid fate had slapped into his incompetent hands.
Clint laughed. “All kids are a little messed up. When Cooper was four, he one time looked me dead in the eye and said ‘if the house burns down, all of mommy’s flowers will die’. Out of the goddamned blue. It was like something out of a horror movie, I swear,” he chuckled. He glanced at the open door of Steve’s suite. “But yeah, she’s… at breakfast, I kept watching how she’d jump if anybody put down a glass too hard. She’s...seen some stuff.”
They’d handcuffed the girls to their beds. Steve knew that deep down somewhere, but he’d forgotten. Maybe because he didn’t want to remember. His stomach sank. He had hoped maybe she’d forgotten it all - but then, maybe that had been too much to hope for.
Even after a night of sleep, Steve still felt like he’d held onto the end of a live wire for too long. His whole body was fried and burned out and numb all at once. He and Tony brought Nat and Ian into the kitchen for breakfast when they woke the next morning. Most everyone else on base was awake, despite the early hour.
Steve just nodded. “I… kind of know what you mean. I always thought my life was supposed to be a certain way and then…” He shrugged, his eyes lingering on Ian as the little boy banged his spoon on the table, and on Nat, who was jumping up and down in front of the toaster while Sam smirked at her. “I thought that I wouldn’t get to have a family like this either.”
Steve shrugged and rubbed at the back of his neck. “I still don’t really know what I’m doing, but...I don’t know. She’s learned a lot more words, she’s way better at communicating. And my one friend doesn’t scare her into screaming anymore. I can leave her with Sam, or with Tony and she’ll be okay for a few hours. They can’t really put her to bed, but that’s been okay so far. I don’t know. Some stuff still sends her...into a dark place.”
“Yeah, Daddy,” he chirped. His fingers stroked gently over Toy the elephant. Ian nuzzled his face against Steve’s shoulder. “Cuddle and hugs first?”

Clint glanced over at him, setting the mug down. “We could take her,” he offered. “Laura and I. If you wanted. At this point, one more won’t make it that much crazier.”
The hearing wasn’t as dramatic as Steve had imagined - maybe he had just watched too much TV. A judge read a brief review of Ian’s case, and then brought up the few witnesses that could testify on Ian’s condition and Steve’s fitness as a parent. Dr. Aliyah was first. Her testimony was confident and concise.
I'm planning probably 4 more chapters after this to wrap up this story! Let me know what you think so far, I always appreciate hearing from you!
Tony snorted, shaking his head. “No. Very much not.” He crossed the room to sit on the coffee table in front of them, lowering his voice before speaking again. “He’s one of the men who was trying to reboot the program.”
Everything seemed to be settling into place - except for one key detail. While Tony and - god bless him, T’Challa - had arranged some fake papers for Nat, organized an equally fake adoption from Wakanda, and gotten Steve listed as her very real guardian, Ian’s situation was still undecided.
“No experience? What about the girl you adopted from Wakanda over a year ago?” Tony smiled. “Steve. They’re not going to take him away from us. Also...if they try, I’ll grab him and fly out. We can live on my island.”
“The gun,” Bucky said, whispering the word ‘gun’ so Nat wouldn’t hear it, “they shot her with is definitely partly alien, but Stark figured it might have come from some sort of healing chamber.”
Tasha ignored him. “They can’t. They couldn’t keep your family away, and they weren’t strong enough to hurt you too much. You’re stronger than them.”
Nat raced down the hallway towards Steve’s room, so fast and so set on her destination that she ran right into his legs, falling down and starting to sob afresh.
“Sam explained, I just...wow.” He took a few steps closer to her. Steve wasn’t sure if he looked heartbroken or just shocked. It was definitely a big change, and they’d been so close for so long. “Hi. I’m Clint.”
“Cookie pwease,” she said, reaching further for it while still keeping a hand gripping onto Steve’s shirt. “Cookie
Steve shook his head. “No, Tony, that isn’t -” He stopped, restarting again after a second. “That’s technically true, but we didn’t know until weeks ago. I found him when we found the other girls. He was - just this tiny little thing, half dead.”
Dr. Aliyah came again to do them, and since Nat now associated her with candy, she was pretty excited to see her. She took the shots better than Steve thought she might, though it could have been because of how expertly the doctor misdirected her attention.
“I figured,” Clint said slowly, “the best way to explain was to show her. I hope you don’t mind, I borrowed your home video collection.”
Nat blinked at him owlishly and laid her head on his shoulder. He stood in her nursery for a while longer, rocking her slowly back and forth and trying to remember the words of a lullaby.
If he was going to believe anyone in the world was going to pull a stunt like that, Steve would believe it was Tony.
“Would you believe Pepper and Bucky helped me get this tree in here without you noticing?” Tony murmured, grinning.
Pepper chuckled quietly before standing again. She kissed Tony’s cheek. “Stop being a spaz. I’ll get in touch with a few people about - I’ll call you later, I’ve got to go.” She smiled a blindingly white grin at Steve that made him highly suspicious he’d been being talked about. “Bye, Steve.”
Steve felt worse than he had the night before he was scheduled to get Erskine’s serum. He couldn’t stop pacing, hands wringing, struggling just to keep himself from spiraling into panic.
They did have a team briefing that night after Nat was asleep -- run by Tony and Friday in almost equal parts, with Sam interjecting his opinion as an uncle from time to time. Steve learned a few more things people did to baby-proof their lives (much of them wouldn’t work on Nat, who’d sharpened a binder clip with a rock until it could cut through stuffed animals), but mostly he felt guilty about the fact that he’d been endangering Nat and he hadn’t even realized. A few more decisions were made, namely to vaccinate her, since they had no idea what her health record was actually like. She wouldn’t like having to get the shots, but Steve remembered polio far to well to not take the precaution.
“I’m glad to hear your team is helping, and happy to see her attachment to you is much healthier,” the doctor agreed. She was quiet for a little while longer before speaking again. “That dark place may always be there, Steve. I have hope that in time she’ll forget most everything, but there’s a chance that may not happen. She’ll just need to be strong enough to live with it.” She touched Steve’s shoulder and got a wave from Nat before leaving.
As they stepped into the kitchen, Steve found that their numbers had grown. Clint had come home. Clint stared at Nat for a few long moments, one hand over his mouth.
Things are gonna get steamy in the very near future... in the meantime, let me know what you think about this chapter & the fic so far! Your support means so much to me :)
“Ian was given a very rough start in life,” she said. “When I compare notes from his doctor at CHOP, and even the first few times I met with him, and look at the boy he is now, it’s like an entirely different child. He’s adapting very healthily, he’s gained social skills, psychological resilience, and he’s learned how to live with one hand. Removing him from his family would devastate the progress he’s made.”
“You really don’t use any product?” Pepper asked, feeling a piece of Bucky’s hair. “You have such great natural texture.”
before continuing. Bucky came to sit silently beside Steve, handing him a tablet with several files pulled up.
And yet, given the opportunity to give her away to someone who loved her, someone who was a good parent, who knew her and could care for her probably better than Steve could...the thought of letting her go was like the thought of ripping out his own liver and kicking it off the Brooklyn bridge.
Steve was last to go, hands nervously squeezing the wooden bench as the judge turned to face him more fully.
“Steve, listen. I don’t know shit about having a good dad either. I remember as a kid just wishing that he’d spend time with me, that he’d show me he loved me, that I was worth something to him.” Tony rolled onto his side to meet Steve’s gaze in the dark room. “You love her and you want what’s best for her? I don’t know what more a kid could ask for.”
Clint’s smile turned a little sad. “She’s okay. She’s safe. She’s just not...here,” he said. “Viz helped me find her eventually. He’s with her now.”
Tony, on the other hand, was infuriatingly calm. He sat on the bed, watching Steve pace back and forth as if he was watching a very slow, boring tennis match.
Normally, Steve would try to be more patient with him, but Tony had been acting funky, and he was dead sure it had to do with Pepper’s lunch dates with Bucky - who was being an absolute asshole about it.
. He had spent so long believing he would always be alone that there were nights he still woke up expecting the bed to be empty and cold. It was hard, sometimes, to really trust that this was his to keep forever. But as he lived in each day of the forever he’d fought for and fallen in love with, it got a little easier. He'd always been something of a wanderer, a man with a fight but nowhere to belong.  He'd spent nearly a whole lifetime frozen in ice, and woke up even more alone than before.
to be that strong. He wanted to give her the privilege of being soft, the privilege of being vulnerable. Steve knew that steel core was in there, but he’d be willing to die to keep it covered with whatever innocence Nat had left.
Bucky smiled his most charming grin. Steve had seen it used more times than he could count. Its success rate was devastatingly high. The only time he’d seen it fail was when Bucky had foolishly attempted to use it on Peggy. “Any time you want, doll, I’m free.”
Her words lingered with Steve long after she’d left the base. He knew that the Natasha he’d loved was one of the strongest people he knew, but because she’d had to be. She’d been forged in hell and pain and danger and had come out strong as hell. He’d grown up getting beaten nearly to death by his own father, and it had made him strong too. He didn’t want his carrot top to
Steve knew Clint had always felt at least a little responsible for Wanda. He was the one who’d gotten through to her, who she’d gone to for a lot of different things, especially after Pietro had been killed. Steve pulled fingers absently through the tangles in Nat’s hair, smoothing out the ringlets.
“See me,” Nat confirmed. She poked at the screen with a chubby finger. “And that’s baby bruver Ian ‘cept he didn’t talk yet. And that’s Papa. And Daddy. We got Ian from the hospital,” she informed her elder self. “And now he talks.”
Sometimes, he still a little bit wanted to punch him. But not enough to keep him from curling up in Tony’s arms.
He woke up more often than not because Nat was climbing into his bed. She’d done it with screams at first, but it had just become part of her routine now, as she pulled herself up and tucked herself under his arm to wait for him to get up and make breakfast. Steve kissed her head.
Steve felt Tony practically vibrating beside him, surely full to the brim with things to say about security protocols. “Very soon, your Honor. Both of those things can imply risk...but they can both offset it as well. I can’t think of a more safe place to be than surrounded by my particular group of friends.”
Clint’s whole expression brightened. “He’s amazing. He’s actually not much younger than Nat. Maybe they’d get along. He’s a funny little guy, makes the best expressions. He keeps the older kids laughing. His favorite thing right now is saying ‘uh oh’ anytime me or Laura cuss. It’s hilarious. Reminds me to watch my mouth around him.”
Let's all give Tony a hand for being a grownup capable of processing emotions! Maybe Steve will learn from him (ha).
Whether it was because he was a dad or just because he was good at kids, or maybe some part of her connected with him, Nat took to Clint right away. She still wanted Steve close, but as they played on the floor, she even let Clint touch her without protest. And for a first meeting, that was pretty amazing. He read Nat a few books while Steve made her breakfast, and she obviously seemed to like him. After lunch, when Steve had tucked her in for a nap, Steve closed her door to actually talk with him.
Still, no matter his thoughts on Tony’s holdups, they had to present a united front. Ian and Nat were far too diabolical to face outnumbered.
Steve nodded. “On one of the leaders of the program, as a kid. Yeah.” He glanced at the little boy, who Clint was now goading to finish his yogurt. “At the time, though, he was just a little guy who needed help.”
A child psychologist who had interviewed Ian went next, and briefly described his findings. Nothing abnormal to report, though the boy was quite shy when Steve left the room.
“How about you ask nice?” Steve suggested. “‘Uncle Clint, may I have a cookie please?’” Steve nudged her a little, trying to goad her into being at least a little less hostile.
“You’re the most incredible person I’ve ever met. Every day, I’m awed by your strength, your compassion, and how much of yourself you can give, to me, to our kids, to our friends… Steve, I promise that every day, I will try to be better, for me, for our kids and for you. I promise to keep loving you with everything I have.” Tony smiled a crooked playboy smirk that was only betrayed by the soft adoration in his eyes. He opened up a small box, that held a very simple set of rings. "Steven Grant Rogers... wanna get married?”
“I promised you then that I wouldn’t let any problems we had effect Nat or Ian. But I also promised to give you everything I’ve got. I don’t think I realized how much I would have to give you. You still challenge me, Steve. Sometimes I wanna punch you in your pretty mouth,” he said with a chuckle, “but even then - you always see my full potential, and you make me want to be the best version of me. I want to make that promise again to you, cause I love you.”
“We were really anxious for you to get home,” Steve said. “I wanted to pull you out of your mission right away when this happened.”
Arms overflowing, Nat couldn’t reach out to take it, but still piped up with its name. “Birdy. Tweet tweet.”
“As long as we need to. Don’t whine - negotiate. Come up with some good reasons for you to do jiu jitsu, and if they’re good enough, you might change our minds.”
Tony chuckled, hugging Steve from behind and touching kisses to his shoulders. “She’s always been a little monster.”
“Don’t get used to it, Tony. I’ll still kick your ass during sparing sessions,” Natasha smiled mischievously as she sipped on her smoothie.
A sane part of his brain does recognize that a better life requires a better state of mind—something that he is pretty far from. He recalls the list of therapists SHIELD suggested he considers one to meet, but he isn’t ready to take that step yet. He does wish his brain was wired in a way that didn’t scare him of everything. Because Tony Stark was always scared and paranoid, which is why he stood a little straighter than everybody else, or why he had to dominate the room by shooting snarky and sarcastic comments, or why he had to wear obnoxious sunglasses indoors so people wouldn’t see his eyes wander about the room in fear and anticipation of danger coming his way. Tony simply believed that if people didn’t know he was scared, they wouldn’t be able to hold anything against him.
Steve looked around him as the voices of his teammates blurred out. He grew fond of the billionaire genius, and watching such scenes unfold right in front of his eyes hurt like a bitch as he is unable to jump into the screen and rescue the boy from this—to hold him and tell him he would never be ashamed of him. He wanted nothing but to tell him to not grow up into the man he knows today: the man who hides behind a paparazzi smile and arrogant comments that always held the hidden remark of
“Fine. Whatever. But just to let you know, I’ve got a lot on my fucking plate right now. I’m dealing with too much of your shit. I may be CEO, but you own this damn company. So act like it. Not only that, but SHEILD has not been off my back for months now and I can no longer put them on hold. Whatever happened with you and Agent Fury today has been adding to my—”
He inserted the tape but didn’t press the PLAY button, which suddenly looked as if it were challenging him.
The team erupted in laughter at that. Clint calmed down from his laughing fit to say “Yup. You really are the coolest AI ever. Created by the coolest guy ever.”
“Peachy,” Tony coughed. He got a piece of paper and pen out of his jeans’ pocket. His hands shaking and his eyesight blurry as he wrote down the plan.
“Hey,” Tony smiled, but then realized his voice is cracking and his head is throbbing. He reached his hand behind him, and felt the warm blood around his healed, bruised skull. “What happened?”
Tony wanted to run back to the roof, but then he would be sat next to Steve’s cold and shaking frame. He would be sat next to a man reliving his nightmare over and over again through the night. And if Tony could give a home to the American hero, he sure as hell could make the effort of getting him the damn blanket.
“What a nerd. He looks, what? Four? Maybe six if I'm stretching it. Can’t he play with normal toys or something?” Clint stated.
“I won!” Tony giggled as he landed above the smiling soldier. Steve was hyperaware of the position they were in. Tony has braced himself on his hands and knees above Steve. He was all smiles and giggles before his mind caught up to their position as well, and Steve waited for him to scurry away.
Steve knows why, and he doubles over the floor as he cries furiously in anger and shame and longing. He longs for the genius brunet who has been the ever-present warmth for him. Who has guided and maneuvered him through the future with ease. Who always made him giggle and blush to himself with snarky, sarcastic comments—though Steve refuses to admit he likes them. Who has programmed JARVIS to protect him just as much as it protects its creator. And Steve knows exactly why Tony hasn’t told him.
“Yeah, it is, it is.” He didn’t even bother getting a cup of coffee. The area around the arc reactor hurt him quite badly, and random shots of pain surged through his heart every now and then. He lazily slumped against the kitchen table and groaned.
He knew that part of him missing out on so much on getting to know the Avengers or for them to know him much earlier was due to how so little he talked about himself and his feelings. Talking about technicalities of his work and science seemed far more important, but now he realizes that he could’ve been spared so many awkward situations and misunderstandings if he just
Clint absolutely loved spending time with Tony. All he ever did was laugh and learn cool science stuff, which he learned is called Physics. He had come to learn that him and the engineer shared quite a similar music taste, and often linked his playlists to Tony’s as he napped in his cloud-like vents.
Peter stared back into those brown eyes with a look that screamed 'busted'. Tony sighed but couldn't help but chuckle a bit. He really had grown fond of the boy, that was for sure. But just the thought of becoming Howard scared the living crap out of the genius. As if he could sense it, Peter stepped forward, kneeling next to the chair the billionaire was seated in. He placed his soft hand on top of Tony's hardened, scarred ones.
"Nah, you're jus' terrible at this game," Bucky shrugged, nodding towards Clint's full hands and showing off his three remaining cards. Clint growled. He was clearly going to say something back when Tony interrupted, spreading his arms out over the table.
Steve walked into work with a smile on his face, laughing at the excited barks the dogs made at his entrance. The clinic's resident dog, Dodger, rushed up to greet him, jumping up against him. He greeted all the dogs separately as he did every morning, giving them their respective foods.
"She- um, she said I'm- I'm practically- um, 'raising' you, how I'm becoming, eh, my... dad," Tony said, looking down at his fiddling hands in his lap. Peter was taken back for a moment. His mentor never stuttered. Tony Stark was never nervous. And the way he'd said 'dad' told Peter enough about their real relationship.
"No, of course not," Steve agreed with a smile, serving him a generous amount of pancakes. Tony prodded at the stack with his fork.
"I actually kinda like it," Steve tried. Tony just stuck out his tongue as he moved away. Steve just chuckled, accepting defeat.
Thanks again for all the amazing feedback, it means so much! Make sure to check out my accounts on Wattpad (MarvelBishes) (Starker4Life) and my Stony one-shots that I have here on ao3 too.
Without waiting for a response the teenager was out the door again, heading off to who-knows-where. Tony mumbled a quick 'finally' towards the ceiling and threw the covers back to sit up straight. Steve was next to him in no time to support him.
Tony shrugged, winking at Peter before slowly slinging his legs off the couch and sitting up. His face was scrunched up with the effort, and he gladly accepted the helping hand Steve lend him. He made a move to put the book he'd been reading on the table nearby when Clint grabbed it and put it on the table before the brunette could. Tony shot him a look, telling the spy he could have done that himself, but Clint just smiled back with a smug "You're welcome,". Tony huffed and muttered something under his breath, but Clint knew he was actually grateful. Tony leaned back into Steve's side.
Steve closed his eyes, the feeling of past events replaying in his mind as tears rolled down his cheeks. What if he didn't wake up this time? What if that small pulse just gave out and Tony was-
"Well, time to get to work then," Steve commented with a content sigh before turning to meet their customer.
So they let him be. They simply told the teachers he wasn't feeling well and made sure to leave the boy enough food when they left. Every day, they would try to talk to him through the closed door, but the boy only ever opened up to accept the food they offered or hand them back his dirty dishes.
The same three people came back the next day, Steve looking as excited as Tony felt at seeing him again. It wasn't long before he was in the car, resisting the urge to press his face against the window, fascinated by everything rushing by outside. His mouth fell open when he noticed the car had stopped.
"Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine," he assured Steve, who seemed satisfied as he walked back to the living room to call the others for dinner. But even though Tony seemed fine, there was a sense of 'wrong' that kept nagging at Bruce. He decided that pressuring Tony into talking wasn't the way to go about the problem, but he hoped Tony would at least talk to him about it.
"Guys!" Steve looked up from where he'd been staring a hole into the table while in thought to see Bruce walking in with the biggest smile Steve had seen on him in weeks. Bruce had been having some trouble with his anger issues lately, so Steve was happy to see a smile on the boy's face. "You won't believe what news I've just received."
"Let's go upstairs, yeah?" He suggested calmly, not entirely sure as to how far gone Tony was exactly. "We can put a Disney movie, and I can make us both some soup."
"Bye Mr. Steve!" He yelled towards the only man still in the kitchen before disappearing around the corner. Steve chuckled to himself. Peter and Tony were basically the same, especially if Tony showed his brown curls like that. He shook his head, grabbed his coffee and made his way over to the main area. He sat down next to Natasha, who was still sitting there, Clint opposite of her.
"Tony, be honest with me. Does it hurt?" Steve asked gently. Tony bit his lip, clearly hesitating before nodding softly. "The doctor might be able to help with the pain if you show him what's wrong."
"Mhthr sfhark ifs fwiwawy weffing w-" he tried to explain, but was cut off by aunt May, who gave him a stern look.
"You okay, Tony?" He asked in a gentle voice. Peter noticed and turned the music off, saving his and Tony's work and sitting on the workbench. "And don't say that you're 'fine', because you say that every time,"
"I feel your anger, brother. But this is not the way to help Anthony!" Thor tried, keeping his voice as soft as he could. "We must help him now that we know of his suffering. Getting angry will not do him any good, you know that." Loki avoided his gaze, his lips pressed together in a thin line. He knew Thor was right, which was new- usually Loki would be the one to talk his brother down from a rage-, but he was just so
"Guys, this is Tony," Steve said. "Tony, these are my friends. The loud one is Thor, the guy next to him is Loki, and the one losing is Clint."
Peter turned around triumphantly towards Tony, who laughed and clapped in his hands before giving the boy a high-five. They both walked over to where the cup was sticking to the wall. Tony gave it a gentle tug, but the glass didn't come off. He pulled a bit harder but it still didn't budge. Apparently, that was what they had been hoping for as they smiled at each other in triumph. Tony clapped the kid on the shoulder, pride in his eyes.
I don't know how to express how grateful I am for the support on this silly little story. You all made me so incredibly happy this year reading all your comments, they really meant so much to me. Stay safe, and I'll see you all next year ;) <3000
"Another foreign exchange student, that's so cool! Nat, Thor, and Loki were, too. Have you lived here long? Do you even speak English? Can you understand what I'm saying at all right now?"
Meanwhile, Steve was explaining the game, Crazy Eights, to Tony who nodded along to his words to indicate he understood.
Smiling to himself, he got set on Steve's schedule. Through the glass window, he made brief eye contact with Ana. She winked at him. He smiled. She was on board.
"Well, important... Stuff..." Tony replied, groaning at how stupid that sounded. "Just let go, please,"
"No, that's the thing!" He explained excitedly. "He never lets anyone in there apart from doctor Banner, who is still missing, by the way, and so that's, like, a big deal!" He rambled.
He started walking towards the kid's next class, making sure the boy followed him. Which he did, albeit hesitantly. He looked tense as he fell into step slightly behind him. Steve decided to try and make him more comfortable.
Tony smiled and muttered a soft "thanks" before shouldering his backpack and following Bruce out the door. They walked together through the hallways towards principal Fury's office, chatting softly about science. When Bruce stopped outside of the office, Tony seemed to snap out of a daze, as if he forgot they were walking somewhere.
Peter comes back the next morning to have an awesome day with his favorite genius superhero in the lab
Tony's home and it's time for some team relaxing. Of course, a little spider comes along to join in on the fun. But maybe Peter gets a little more than he was expecting...
"Can only girls like boys?" Tony asked tentatively. "Because I see people in boats from my window, and I one time see two boys in boats. And they kisses too. And two girls. Can boys love boys, and girls love girls?"
" Thor would've flinched at the tone if it weren't his brother. "Anthony got abused, kept it to himself and was forced to deal with the trauma
He dropped from the vents into the hallway, knocking softly on Tony's door. He heard a soft mumble and Clint took that as an affirmative. The Archer pushed the door open softly, finding Tony in the same position he'd seen him in while he was lurking in the vents.
There were bruises all over Tony's slim torso and arms. His ribs were painfully prominent underneath the olive skin and lean muscles. Of course, Tony's black eye was courtesy of the battle ram that was Schmitt's fist, but none of these seemed to be any of their work. They looked older with a disgusting shade of purple and yellow.
dad, but that's just my opinion, of course. Anyway, I'm- I'm not your son, sir. I, uh..." Peter seemed to be at a loss on how to get himself out of the hole he'd dug himself. Tony stared at him for a moment before bursting out laughing. Peter seemed taken back at first but was soon giggling along.
"Mr. Stark?" The young Spiderling asked softly, tears soaking his mask. Tony slowly blinked his eyes open, staring up into the sky with wet, brown eyes. Steve gently shook his shoulder, softly talking to him to gain his attention. It worked as the genius turned his head ever so slightly, his glassy eyes staring up at him.
"Steve," Tony croaked out, happiness flooding his system. Before he knew what he was doing, he'd attacked Steve in a hug, gripping him tightly. Once he realized what he was doing, he quickly stepped back, embarrassment flushing his cheeks. "Scuse," he apologized. Steve laughed and pulled him back in.
One, Tony Stark had given Peter a proper suit, that, unlike his onesie, was able to protect him. The AI noticed things when Peter didn't and the stronger web shooters were safer for slinging high up than his own home-made ones.
They only managed to stop scuffling when Sam walked in, waving his arms and injecting himself between them to break it up.
“I guess I do, huh?” Tasha tilted the screen so Nat could see. “I was just watching this video of you and your family.”
Nat grabbed a pad of paper from the desk and marched off to her room. “I have lots of reasons, you’ll see!”
thanks for everybody who's stuck with this fic despite the long break in updates! all of your reviews inspired me to keep writing :)
Steve sat beside her to watch. It was the highlight reel Tony had pieced together - near the end. Tasha must have spent all night watching.
“I know you’re nervous about the hearing, but it’s like I keep telling you, there’s absolutely nothing to worry about.”
Steve eagerly latched onto the change in topic. “The doctors didn’t even know if he was going to survive the infection at first, from when they took his hand. The Red Room - they just left him to die when the new hand they tried to put on him didn’t take.”
“It’s been a rough few days, Barnes,” Tony said. His hand in Steve’s was a constant, steady presence, and Steve didn’t miss how he stayed within reach, how even when he moved his hand away to set Ian down by his toys, he stayed close by Steve’s side.
Tasha tilted her head in confusion, and Bucky lifted his hand from the other room, silvery palm up, fingers wiggling.
Clint shook his head, and he scuffed his shoe along the floor. “I don’t think she’s ready for that yet.”
Nat eventually fell asleep, though Steve stayed in the backseat, afraid she’d be scared if she woke up alone - and strapped to something no less. She napped until they arrived at the base, and woke up cranky, scowling out at the world with as much fury as she could muster. Steve carried her inside.
He blinked a few times, feeling his whole chest tighen like a giant fist had closed around it. “Oh. Uh. I don’t know. I think Nat wouldn’t handle that well.” Steve found his heart racing, searching for a good reason to turn down the way out he’d been telling himself he needed. “She- um. The doctor we took her to told me about the attachment issues Nat has, being away from her would be bad for her, wreck her trust issues back up again.”
"Coming, kid," he called before walking over to Steve. "He's going to eat a horse," he sighed, letting his head fall on Steve's warm chest. The soldier chuckled, putting a hand on Tony's back and letting his other one play with the billionaire's hair.
Tony nodded enthusiastically. "Sì, he live not far. I still no know how I thinks to get there though," he said, frowning a bit. He called Hulk over, who entered the room with his leash already in his mouth, his tail wagging. The boy and the big dog had bonded immediately after meeting and Hulk loved to walk with Tony.
By the time Peter fell silent, Tony was already on the verge of hyperventilation. He had no idea what the boy was talking about-- for all he knew, Peter could have just threatened his life or something.
"I see," was all he said, the lack of judgment in his voice momentarily shocking Tony, who was deeply disappointed in himself for not only letting himself be pushed around but also
. He'd never felt this kind of rage before. It was tinted with something else- worry? Fear? Concern? All of the above? He couldn't tell. But it was making him see red, unable to think clearly.
"Well, you have us now," Bruce offered. "I'm sure you can talk to some of us. I would listen, and I'm sure Steve would, too."
"I'm afraid he was the victim of another hallway assault," Peggy answered for him and the doctor nodded.
And just for clarification: Tony's thought process is, of course, in Italian, but I can't speak Italian and I'm sure most of you can't either, so it's just written down in English.
"Right. And the pit bull around 2 PM, that little ginger cat around 2.30, and the husky between 4 and 5."
"No, Tony, please. I want to talk about this." Tony swallowed heavily but sat back down. "Tony," Steve said firmly, trying to meet Tony's eyes, who was stubbornly looking anywhere but at the blonde's blue puppy eyes. "I- I'm flattered that you feel that way about me, I really am. And I love you too, just not in
"Are you... are you my family?" He asked, hesitant in a way Tony Stark rarely ever was. Steve resisted the urge to let out the slightly inhuman noise he was sure would've come out of his mouth, seeing the Parkers tense behind him.
"Come on, Tony. I'll drive you." Tony jumped off the bed, happy to go with Steve, even if it was to a hospital, which was definitely not a fun place for Tony.
"Right. Now, kiss, you idiots," he exclaimed, hauling him and Tony off the floor and pushing the smaller man into Steve, who caught him easily. Tony smirked and kissed the tip of Steve's nose before lowering down to his lips. Steve happily kissed him back, his hands on Tony's waist.
