. I picked the band because Jared Padalecki has mentioned that he imagines Sam listening to them. I picked the song based on
“I need to help Tessa with getting everyone back, but you boys have fun!” Becky gestures to the other woman in scrubs, helping a woman with a walker get the tennis balls stuck to the legs over the threshold and into the air conditioning. The bubbly blonde pecks Chuck on the cheek and bounces toward an elderly man with a cannula running to the oxygen tank on the back of his chair.
They linger for several long, joyous minutes until Castiel pulls away and insists they need to leave. Dean straps his guitar across his back and gathers Castiel into a tight hug before they turn on the outside light and make their way to the transit station.
They make their way to the main entrance and Castiel continues, “I’ll send you questions once I get back to my desk, and thank you for today, and all your help. I’m not sure I could do it alone.”
Dean rubs his hands together at the sight, gleeful, and snakes past him to grab plates and frosty mugs from the freezer, setting them on the table that separates the kitchen from the living room. The table is sized down for the two of them, but there’s a leaf hiding inside that allows for seating for six. Dean goes back for two beers, uncapping them with the bottle opener on his keys and pouring them into the glasses. He has Dean spoiled on frozen mugs. The first time he pulled them from the freezer, Dean’s eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. Dean places the empty bottles into the recycling bin under the sink, and they walk together to the table, Castiel with the sliced pizza in his hands. Dean pulls the towel from Castiel’s pocket and lays it in the center of the table, so the pizza stone doesn’t scorch the wood, and they each take a seat across from one another.
“Charlie didn’t mention it, but the Board has asked you and Chuck to lead the summer program. If it goes well, they plan to extend it as an after-school program. Do you think you might be interested?”
When they meet at the transit station, Castiel watches Dean do a double-take and he isn’t sure why, but he smiles to himself, all the same, placing his coffee change in the guitar case and making plans to meet at the museum at noon. The song Dean plays while he awaits his bus is lovely and he recognizes the feeling of it, if not the tune itself. He boards the bus feeling warm all over and hums it for the remainder of his journey.
Dean only uses John’s tape deck on rare occasions - he’s happy listening to the same box of mullet rock for the rest of his life, thank you very much.
The lobby slowly empties, a buzz of excitement leaving with them until only the museum staff and Dean are left.  Castiel turns fully to him, a wide smile gracing his face.
Maggie Zeddmore storms over to her adopted brother and grabs him by the arm, hauling him back from Castiel and Dean. She’s the only woman in Ghostfacers, and Dean has informed him she’s the only true bard in the group as well.
Dean has never been to an exhibit opening, let alone played one. He feels nervous but doesn’t want to trigger Cas’s anxiety, so he’s been keeping it to himself. Sure, he unloaded to Sam earlier this week, but his brother has always been good at talking him down from the ledge. Now though, as the bus draws closer to the museum, he can’t stop his leg jiggling or the compulsive way he wipes his sweaty palms down his thighs. A block away from their stop, Castiel reaches across the narrow gap between them and takes his hand. He wants to recoil from the touch, afraid of getting Cas’s hands sweaty, but the finds Cas a soothing comfort to his frayed nerves. He squeezes Cas’s fingers and they keep holding hands off the bus, down the street, and up the stairs to the museum’s main doors.
“You knew my mom?” Dean knows his face is scrunched in an unattractive twist, but he can’t wrap his head around what Chuck is saying.
“Hello, Dean,” he says, squinting into the afternoon sun and smiles at the musician who has just taken the first of the steps up to the museum.
After the hunters had retired to their rooms, Dean found himself alone in the bunker’s kitchen, rinsing beer bottles; not quite ready to call it quits. He was full of pent-up energy and he knew that if the housework kept till morning, the bunker would never be clean again. He made two laps of the trafficked areas and came back, arms laden in dishware to his favorite angel, elbow-deep in soap suds, his trench coat slung neatly over a nearby chair. Dean set the dishes next to the basin and grabbed a towel, happy to save his fingers from pruning.
Dean pulls his phone from his pocket and opens the latest email from Castiel. The list is a few names and the locations where each musician plays. Charlie grabs the phone from Dean and scrolls through the list, eyes alighting on one of the names.
He admits to himself, alone in this shrine, surrounded by his creations, that perhaps Becky was right about his ending…
By the end, the brothers are giddy, the rush of the performance warming them. They never play together, haven't since Sam left the family band, and Dean feels a sudden pang of longing. When he looks at Sam, he sees his emotions reflected back to him. Neither are willing to break the spell though, and Dean packs his dirty dishes, Sam reaching to place everything back in his desk drawer. Dean moves out of the guest chair, bends to pick up his guitar and the stool, and turns away from his brother.
“Yeah, maybe to you,” Dean mumbles and sets his fingers back to the strings. Sam leans into his space and grabs the guitar by its neck. Dean, unwilling to risk damage to the instrument, lets it be taken from him and set on Sam’s other side.
“Dean, we can’t keep doing this every year,” Sam grumbles, assembling an elaborate vignette of their last werewolf hunt with red felted elves. He grimaces at the jolly mischievous face and adds more corn syrup blood to its imaginary fangs. That’s going to stain.
Claire has moved since he last saw her, though she’s still on the same block. She’s set up on a bench showcasing a real estate agent’s smiling face and is seated on the backrest, feet planted on the seat. Her small case is open next to her feet and the leather jacket she’d worn the day before is draped over the back of the bench. She’s wearing a tank top and dark-wash jeans with holes in the knees. She’s playing with her eyes closed, her hair pulled into a side ponytail, and when they get within shouting distance, she opens her eyes and spots them, even though both Castiel and Dean are silent. She stops her strumming as they approach.
“C’mon doofus, help me get these chords right,” she bickers, picking up her lyre and strumming a soothing melody that has everyone in the parking lot feeling warm and cozy. She winks at Dean and an unspoken agreement passes between them on sharing the burden of bardic inspiration during the day’s events.
“I smell turkey legs,” Dean exclaims, already making a beeline for the barbeque smokers set up on the opposite side of the parking lot. Castiel laughs, following a few steps behind to shamelessly admire what he can see of Dean’s rear end behind his guitar. He’s so distracted he hardly notices the large white van as it pulls into a nearby space, it’s side door slamming open, three of the five Ghostfacers spilling out into the lot. He hears Ed Zeddmore before he sees him, hollering across the lot.
Castiel dashes from the bathroom to his messenger bag hanging from the coat rack next to the front door, and pulls a notebook from its depths. He opens to the middle of the book where he keeps his exhibit ideas and finds the blank page for Charlie's. It's mocked him relentlessly for more than two weeks, so it feels fantastic when he finally pens something there for the first time:
They sit on the bench for several hours, reminiscing, trading stories, laughing and crying in equal measure. Castiel is silent, save for polite laughter and never stops touching Dean. When the sun begins to set, Becky joins them, slightly subdued once she catches the nature of their conversation. She and Castiel make plans for the exhibit opening; he invites the seniors who can make the trip to opening night, and she exchanges contact information with him.
“I’m amenable to that,” Castiel smiles and they stand to make their way to the front of the restaurant.  Castiel insists on paying and Dean gets the tip and they part ways on the sidewalk, Dean heading to the bus stop and Castiel to the museum. Both with a newfound lightness in their steps.
He has had a very hard time keeping his eyes on anything but Dean. Dean, who has managed to pour himself into leather breeches, a loose brown tunic layered over a linen blouse, the sleeves of which are pushed up by buckled bracers protecting his forearms, and dear lord, the chainmail, draped so casually over his shoulders. He’s an actual dream if Castiel’s honest with himself.
When he finishes, and Cas wipes his eyes and the applause finally dies down, Cas turns his microphone back on and turns to Charlie, who stands at one of the tables with Gilda, their heads tilted toward one another in adoration.
He turns back toward the café, not wanting to show sweat during the interview when he’s drawn down a side street to the next block at the sound of strumming.  It’s not a guitar, the chords are too bright. When he rounds the corner, he sees his ear was right, it’s a ukulele, played expertly by a young woman he would place in her late teens. A shiver breaks down his spine and the hair on his arms rises. He doesn’t recognize her song, it’s something original, and he sticks around until the last chords have dissipated into the universe. He jogs across the street to her, digging into his pocket for the ten-dollar bill Castiel had given him that morning and places it into the girl’s case, a miniature of his own.
“Yeah, try and make a stop every few months. Mostly, I travel around though. Been just about everywhere in the U.S. Mom homeschooled us growing up, so I didn’t have the traditional upbringing. But, man, I wouldn’t trade it for nothing. That rush, when you know you’ve hit the right notes, that you’re really getting your message across, touching lives. Nothing beats it,” he’s feeling wistful now, lost in thought, a little high on remembered performances.
“You were ill,” Cas says. Unreadable, as usual. “The internet said I shouldn’t leave you alone. Or on your back.”
Then a humming, a bleating, bleeding out through tightly-pressed lips that couldn’t keep it in: a jaw wired shut by shame, or duty, or one of Dean’s other usual reasons for being. On its heels came a strange, high, pain sound, then another. A shocked sound, surprised, dismayed. It quivered and fell, quivered and fell, like Jell-O down steep stairs, and Sam realized — with a feeling like having swallowed a too-big ice cube — that Dean was sobbing. Not
He’d never heard Dean cry. Which was not to say he hadn’t known when Dean was crying. Dean didn’t cry infrequently; he just did it in absolute, unwavering silence. The actual sound of it was a shimmery rustle of bedsheets (too fast and shallow in rhythm to be the
“Dean," Cas says. Then a pause. "You’re wondering why I’m in your bed,” comes the growl, eventually.
And then there was another category of unwanted sounds. The sounds of too many things against Dean’s skin. A flat hand. An open palm. A near miss, a landed punch. Knuckle on bone, knuckle on meat. The belt. The buckle. The shocked, breathless aftermath of John chewing his little heart out on some hotel sidewalk. The hitch of a nightmare sigh. The turn of pages while he waited out the night, wide awake.
And then this, too, fell to waste like a sandcastle in the tide. What swelled in its wake was a poorly constructed whisper, supposed to be quiet and close, but Dean’s timbre colored too far outside the lines for that. It quavered. It went louder and softer, volume not really under Dean’s tight control, but clearly none of this was.
At some point, Sam brings a girl over — but just once. The way they look at each other, Dean knows Sam won’t be renewing the lease on their little two-bedroom.
Cas listens. Cas obeys. Dean’s face hovers next to him, Dean’s voice passes instructions through his ears, and slowly breathing gets easier, and eventually existing feels normal again.
Cas doesn’t doubt him. But this isn’t about ‘easier.’ There’s no way to make a Mal’ak box easier. There’s no way to send Dean off to not die, ever. It’s the opposite of Cas’ job. Cas brings Dean
Dean goes to the wedding and smiles a lot more than he’s used to, until his face hurts and he sucks the open bar dry to make it stop.
,” Dean admits. “I don’t feel like giving whoever’s listening-” he rolls a finger toward the heavens “—the ammunition.” His lips press together, maybe between his teeth. “But I owe you, for a lot. Before I go.” Dean’s gaze picks up again, startling Cas at four paces. All the little lines around his eyes, fine as feathers, come out with his defensive squint. “Or, we could just…leave it where it is."
“The internet is wrong. A lot. Get used to it.” Dean rolls off the bed and stands beside it, crotchety on his knees like an old man. “I'm seriously okay now. Look,” he says, touching his fingertips to his nose, alternating.
All the lights are off in Dean's room except for the TV. It’s a small old set boosted from a shitty motel too cheap to replace it, which means that somewhere in middle America there’s an empty spot on a pressboard bureau, a wall socket missing a plug, and a bill that’ll never be paid on a credit card that doesn’t exist.
It’s a three-letter word but he slurs it. Fatigue, not alcohol. Alcohol doesn’t touch Dean like it used to (though that doesn’t stop him from drinking).
“Hey,” Dean says, almost under his breath. He murmurs lies in a tone that’s also surprising. Cas wonders if anyone else has heard it, in the history of Dean. "It's gonna be okay. It’s gonna be fine.”
He gets to an intersection and his foot stalls on the pedal. Not one of them in the car - not Dean with his hand on the stick, nor Sam tucking his windy hair into place in the passenger seat, nor Cas hunched forward from the back with his elbows ledged on the seat corners -  has has any idea what to do next.
Cas is ready to. But then there’s this moment of long, deep darkness, when everything is the flicker of television and the sounds of a car chase, and Dean’s face is gray in the light and his eyes shine up more than they should, and Cas catches the faint press of Dean’s chin trying to keep his mouth from flexing, and Cas remembers with sudden clarity what’s been too easy to forget (because Dean's made it easy, on purpose, and because the threat of loss has cornered Cas inside himself, selfish and jealous):
The room gives him a collectively blank look. Just as he’s about to school everyone on a solid decision, Cas beats him to it.
“Have lunch with ‘im every day since I got into town,” he stops short of telling Castiel about their text battle that morning, unwilling to admit how much he’s been anticipating the last several hours.
He once again begged off the question, and the pair spent another twenty minutes talking until Charlie hung up for baby Anson’s bedtime routine. He had opened his messaging app and tapped Dean’s name at the top of the list to type out an invitation.
He’s walking to one of the cafes on campus to pick up their food when his phone buzzes twice in his back pocket. He swipes over the screen and pulls down his notifications menu, tapping on Her Majesty and opening his text thread with Charlie.
“Cas here works at the Folk Museum a coupla blocks that way,” Dean indicates, jabbing a thumb at Castiel, then over his shoulder. “He’s got an exhibit coming up an he’s looking for buskers to interview.  Think you might be interested?” It’s not how Castiel would approach her, but it seems they’ve bonded telepathically over lunch, and she readily agrees to help them.
Castiel opens his mouth to ask more questions, but he’s afraid of broaching the true reason for this heart-to-heart. The part of him left from before he met Dean wants to keep his next question locked away, but the part of him that has changed because of the man sitting across from him takes a leap of faith.
Just before noon, Castiel spots him, looking both ways before crossing at the light to the museum. Dean can’t see Castiel, and he gets a moment to watch the man as he looks up at the building, draped in banners displaying their current exhibits and mouthing the titles to himself. Anael appears at his side, startling a little at her presence. She has a sly look on her face, red lips tipped up on one side.
“Guitar. It’s kind of a family thing,” he offers. “I gotta lunch thing, but do you play here often? I’d love to hear more of your work.”
“Nah, he’s too busy serenading his new lady,” Dean admits. “Caught him with a second-hand guitar last week. You shoulda seen him. Turned redder than a tomato.”
“I know. You’ve gotta play when the mood takes you. It was the same way with mom. Remember when dad got pissed at that English dude, Ketch, who kept showing up to our shows? Flashing all his money? And mom started coming up with original material and dad got so pissed, he punched the guy and we had to leave town in the middle of the night?”  Dean nods his head emphatically and they share a laugh. Dean motions for Sam to return the guitar and he hands it over, thumbing their initials.
“How ‘bout we get a few sandwiches and go see Claire? Maybe we can bribe her into talking with cold cuts?” Dean offers with a boyish smile. He makes everything effortless and Castiel is immensely grateful to him at that moment.
He’s already felt it from the handful of students he teaches in the park, his words and instruction shaping the power of their music. He’s never felt a connection to the Words of Creation as strongly as he has since putting down roots here, with Cas. His parents would have been elated by the entire prospect. He takes a moment to close his eyes and give thanks to the gods for all he has gained in these few short months.  When he opens them again, he’s staring into the depths of the ocean, buoyed by the love reflected within Cas’s eyes.
On a break, he texts Sam, insisting they have lunch. It feels like forever since they shared a meal, and he’s keyed-up with the need to share all their good news.  Sam texts back that he’s free and Dean counts the seconds until noon by the beat of his songs.
"Mhm," Sam grunts and finds himself a beer in the kitchen. He returns with a bottle for Dean and says, "Who's the lucky sap that's got you acting all squirrely?"
“It’s not an obsession, Sammy,” Dean grumbles, dejected. “It’s probably too early to admit to anything, but,” he cuts off to sigh and rubs a hand over his face, leaning deep into the couch cushions. “Look, there’s this guy, ok? I haven’t told you about him because it’s still new, but I’ve seen him every day since I got into town and he’s been… supporting me, you know?” Dean ends on an explosive sigh and waits for his brother’s reaction. He risks a peek at Sam and sees him speechless, eyebrows in his hairline, utterly flabbergasted.  “So yeah, man. Maybe you’re not far off the mark.”
"Hey, hey, woah. That's cool, Dean," Sam mollifies with his hands raised in surrender. A grin splits his face and Dean feels his own mouth quirk up in unbidden mirth once again.
“Something on your mind?” she asks after Castiel has set his bag on its hook and booted up his computer.
“Anyway, when they got around to having us, they got it in their heads to form their own little Partridge Family. First instrument I ever learned was the tambourine. Sounds lame, I know, but man was I cute. Stole the show every time.”  He feels more relaxed talking about his family and settles back into his seat.
“The invitation is there, if you change your mind,” Castiel offers kindly and turns his chair back to face his computer.
“Hey, man! No touching,” he gasps and tries to jerk away from Chuck’s grasp, but the man has him pinned in place by the shoulder. Castiel makes an abortive step toward them, but Dean knows he won’t throw a punch if this goes sideways. Chuck stares in awe at the small horned mask in his palm, running his thumb along the ridges and planes of the figure. Chuck’s eyes snap to Dean’s and he stops struggling, caught in their depths. Castiel has one hand poised to reach for the older man when he opens his mouth to speak.
“Thank you for coming over on short notice,” he says, once the pizza is served and their mouths are burned.
“Could there ever be something…more?” He can’t look Dean in the eye and settles for staring into the kitchen over Dean’s shoulder.
Humming, Castiel replaces the watering can on its shelf and nearly has a heart attack at the wailing squeal behind him. Clutching his chest, he turns with wide eyes just as Charlie runs to him with open arms. She flings herself into him and they go careening into his desk, its contents wobbling dangerously.
He spends the morning assisting Anael with the quilt and she reveals she’s been doing her own research on several performers in the surrounding area; it seems Castiel’s enthusiasm has rubbed off on her, too. When Castiel grabs his wallet and travel notebook before noon, Anael makes an excuse to go up with him to the lobby and he kindly doesn’t call her out on wanting to see Dean for herself.  She chats for a few moments with the volunteer at the front desk as Castiel tries not to pace the entryway.
He flicks on the remote to Castiel’s modest television set and selects a streaming service.  All the “pick up where you left off” shows are documentary series, so he selects a nature show, and figures they can ease into this new turn of their relationship. An episode on big cats plays as Castiel walks back to the kitchen to refill their beers in the spare set of frozen mugs and in most ways, it feels like any other time he’s stayed to decompress after a long day before heading back to Sam’s apartment.
They laze around in bed for nearly a half-hour, touching and kissing one another until Cas’s phone alarm chimes in gentle tones and they each roll out of bed to get ready for the day. They trade off in the bathroom and Cas goes first, leaving a spare toothbrush on the sink for Dean to use. He comes out to the kitchen to a bed-rumpled Dean holding a steaming mug of herbal tea which he accepts with a kiss.
“Dean Winchester,” Chuck whispers his name like a prayer, reverent. “When Becky said it was...but I didn’t think - I mean. Wow. It’s you.”
He takes the Tupperware container from Sam and opens the lid, revealing a thick roast beef sandwich with a side of horseradish and a little cheese wheel. He claps his hands and rubs them together excitedly like some greedy banker in a B-movie. Lifting the sandwich, he takes a too-big bite that puffs his cheeks like a chipmunk. Sam rolls his eyes.
His morning tasks complete, Castiel sets about booting up his desktop and logging into the hard drive Charlie left him. He is grateful for her superior organizational methods, and quickly finds the project file for the upcoming music exhibit. He's lost in thought, jotting down potential ideas and doesn't hear the museum's preservationist enter the room.
Castiel feels a pang of disappointment, but carries on, “I would still very much like your input. Even if it’s just a jumping-off point. My cell number is on the card.  If you’d still be interested in lunch, let me know.” Castiel wonders if that last bit sounds like a flirtation and is once again mortified.
Once they’ve both settled, he spots the Bradburys in the eclectic mix of people. The deeper they venture into the museum, the more faces he’s able to pick out: several of his students have made it, along with Chuck, Becky, Tessa, and Joshua. There’s a space cleared near the entrance to the exhibit hall with a few amplifiers and microphones and he drops off his guitar, eager to mingle with his friends and loved ones. Castiel peels off a few minutes later to join Charlie and a few other museum staff to begin the evening. He snags a program from one of the cocktail tables.
Dean hands over the microphone and helps them settle in, winking at Maggie and thanking her for keeping the boys away from Charlie. Once everyone is set, he joins Cas and the Bradburys and enjoys the rest of the night. At some point, the crowd decides to make the lobby into a dance floor, and Dean pulls Castiel into his arms, swaying to the beat of the music. Ed invites Claire and Chuck to join them on stage and tries to get Dean to join in, too until Maggie pulls him back from the microphone, letting Dean continue to lead Cas around the dance floor.
They’re back at the museum before Castiel is ready to say goodbye, so he offers Dean a grand tour of the place, leading him from room to room, noting the artifacts that make Dean’s face light up: a sculpture made entirely of car parts and a hand-carved wooden mask he admits reminds him of Inigo Montoya.
“Music through time, with a section on local community involvement. It’s still in the planning stages, but I’d like to know how you got started as a musician and what goes into your performances.” There. Back on track.
Despite the fact that each private hot tub is big enough for six people, there’s only a single queen bed cabin attached to each. This means that Sam has to take a private room to himself in the adjacent hotel. Not that he’s complaining even slightly. It means he gets to relax to himself, sleep un-harassed, and wander through rooms without fear of walking in on something gross.
They take the east road first. There’s more in that direction, assuming Cas is heading off to get a car or some other, vehicular form of transport. Assuming he’s not just planning to walk until he runs out of America.
This isn’t supposed to be about Dean. It’s supposed to be about Cas, making sure he’s safe, providing him with the means to take his own revenge.
“Something like that.” Dean agrees. “What happened here anyway? Poltergeist? Haunted mugs? Greek werewolf taken against our crockery?”
“But,” Lucifer doesn’t need to steal from Cas to summon up bitterness here. He lets his own well up, that rich, jagged resentment from a millennia locked up and alone, caged and derided by one he loved. Maybe that’s a bit thick for the situation, but he knows it’ll resonate with Dean. “You should probably know that I’ll be pretending it’s because you care about me. If that makes you uncomfortable, I’d suggest you pursue other options.”
On one monitor, he reads over his notes from his interview with Dean, and on the other is the file list for Charlie’s hard drive. He finishes proofing his notes and opens a folder titled Research from the hard drive. Inside is a plethora of information on the museum’s existing collection, including write-ups on each of the instruments Charlie is planning to display. He minimizes the file list and opens the internet browser, doing a quick search for “Bardic Tradition” and spends the remainder of the afternoon researching his part of the exhibit.
Then, they’re both laughing and joking, and Sam hauls himself out of his chair to give Dean a bone-crushing hug.
He’s taking a quick break to stretch his fingers and unfold the girl's latest creation: a fat bumblebee with a dotted flight path, when he feels a tingle race down his spine, goosebumps raising the skin at the back of his neck. He tucks the drawing with the others in the breast pocket of his flannel, nestled amongst his guitar picks, and settles his guitar, eager to catch the first glimpse of his not-favorite, favorite blue-eyed commuter.
He should never have come back from purgatory. Shoulda let that be a clean break, left Sam to his dog and his almost wife and just stayed out of harms way, doing what he does best. Killing shit.
"You need to go," Sam’s tone softens, and he lets go of Dean, steps back. "And you need to make your peace with this. Make your peace with the fact that Cas is dead and nothing either of us do will bring him back."
“I think maybe the programming he fought off as an angel has finally got the better of him as a human. I mean, Naomi had him kill Samandriel – maybe this is an extension of her plan.”
Listening to Dean talk about the future like he’s planning to stick around for it. Fuck. It’s a good feeling.
Dean shrugs, he’s not familiar with the titles of the books. Hasn’t read most of them, didn’t really feel the need to, what with having suffered through every miserable goddamn inch of them.
Cas wakes up the moment Dean’s weight shifts and he panics a little at first, not used to having someone else in his bed. He doesn’t have enough time to do more than jerk his eyes open before he recognises the broad back in front of him and he relaxes again. It’s Dean, it’s safe. Things are okay.
He feels a hand on his shoulder, starts into awareness as a deep, male, beautifully, hideously familiar voice greets him
“We already know that.” Sam replies slowly. There’s something he doesn’t understand here. Something subtle and nuanced that Cas and Rowena know and are being deliberately obtuse about revealing.
“Something troubling.” Cas pauses, trawling for the right words. “I don’t think his dreams are anything to do with the Mark.”
C'est fin(ish). There's an epilogue coming on Thursday that's 99% porn, and then two paragraphs after the porn of putting a neat little bow on the story at the end of the chapter, but we are, for the most part, done here. :o
Cas folds his arms, engages his death-stare. The one that makes you glad he isn’t an angel anymore, because having all your body parts un-rent is such a nice feeling.
It doesn’t really matter though, because he’s barely able to focus. All he can think about now are all the things waiting for him in the forest. There might be two bodies here, but out there, they are beyond measure. He could rage and rampage around that forest until the day the earth dies, for all he knows.
Unlike last time, the angel they’re searching for isn’t hiding under the bed. He’s lying on top of it. There’s an angel blade speared through his chest so viciously that it pins him to the mattress, done post-mortem, and the outline of wings drawn out in blood on the sheets – a mockery of the usual charcoal flare.
Cas is on his feet and alert before he’s even really had time to process, as the smoke swells from a dribble to a flood.
“You’d have been so pissed off with me if I’d said that to you. You’d have frowned at me and spouted some nice flowery crap that should be cheesy but made me feel better anyway.
“I dreamed I was high.” Cas admits, and the taste of blood in his mouth feels like a fitting accompaniment. Sharp and wrong but oh so wearyingly familiar.
And let’s face it, Dean knows he’s to blame. He took his eye off Sam, was too busy being worried about Cas, all fucked up and hurt by Rowena, and Amara and all her creepy, horrible bullshit. He didn’t see the warning signs with Sam, didn’t even notice how bad things must have been getting.
Sam can see his chest rising and falling, so he doesn’t let himself panic. He just picks Dean up, settles him on one of the motel beds, on his side. He unlaces his boots, pulls a blanket over him, and turns off the lights.
“I need to return to heaven. I’ve been gone too long already. Summon me when you decide his fate. If he is to be killed, then there is information I must extract first, and if not, I’ll still need the information, but I will also need to purge some secrets from his head before he’s locked up.”
“It shouldn’t matter that he nearly killed himself to help you. You shouldn’t need to know that to feel bad for treating him like shit.”
Cas doesn’t, though. All he wants is to get Dean out of the room so he can go chasing a hit. He starts to form the words, a request for a glass of water or something else more time consuming. And then he bites his tongue, hard.
Dean gets used to kissing Cas — old dog, new trick and all — and eventually, he gets used to much more than that. He turns sloppy, carnal and dirty: all teeth and sweat and unstoppable tongue, feeling Cas up with his eyes closed, sliding every part together to see how it fits.
“And it’s not just because of the box,” Dean clarifies. “Even without the box. Even if we just stayed here, business as usual. It’s this life, Cas; there’s just things you can’t have. Everywhere we go we make enemies, and they're just
He couldn’t pick out the words, but the tone was small and silencing — silencing not to Dean, whose litany proceeded unchecked, but to every other sound on earth. The blood in Sam’s ears, the electricity in the walls, the buzz of the hallway lights. The voice of heaven put a damper on the world, and in the sudden anechoic smother, Dean’s words jumped out at him in neon, flashing. They weren’t for Sam, but Sam jumped on them like a mine. He stole them, jammed them into his heart and forced them to settle there. They made peace: peace with the other sounds, the hurt sounds and pain sounds and the lack of happier sounds that Sam had wanted his whole life to be able to fix and hadn’t been able to come close.
“Didn’t know you could get lonely,” he says, sort of cruelly, because he doesn’t know what else to say, and Cas rolls away to the other side of the bed. According to the Old World Order, Cas is supposed to peace-out at this point in a conversation, to disappear in winged miff, mildly insulted and not compelled to offer up a decent sayonara. But things are different, now. Cas is living a human life, and there are no more peace-outs.
Castiel’s arms cinch around Dean’s chest, and Dean does all he can to keep his breathing in check, but between all the drunkspeak threatening to fly out of his mouth and the heart-attack-that-isn’t, something has to give. Fuck Castiel, Angel of The Lord. Dean didn’t ask for pity, never has, and being on the receiving end of Cas’ is like rubbing an onion in his eyes.
Cas politely declines. He rolls back in Dean’s bed (fully clothed, to Dean’s great relief) and says nothing.
“Please don’t go,” Cas says, in a voice he can barely command. This awful human feeling is just wrapped, entwined, in every piece of his body, tightening and tightening, and his words come out high and strangled. “Please, please don’t go. I’ll do whatever it takes,” he bargains. “I’ll find something-”
Dropping his mouth to Dean’s ear, Cas bites it, licks up Dean’s temple and listens to the tendons in his neck as he bends Dean’s head back, listens to Dean’s throat stumble over sound and tries not to wish so hard for him to open his eyes. Dean’s eyes, Cas knows, will be as dewy as his forehead, the same color as the earth before it turned into The Earth, and Cas wants to see them focus. Cas wants to see them
“I know,” Dean says quietly, almost comfortingly. “I know.” He reaches out to tug the corner of Cas’ coat (the one he never takes off, even indoors, and they’ve all just stopped questioning it) and lets his thumb hook in, under the sleeve.
And that thought leads to other, darker, more treacherous waters as Cas tries not to ponder the ethics of making sure Dean never finds out the truth behind all this. Because what he’d do and what Dean would want him to do are two very different things, and the only thing that would make him glad to betray Dean like that, would be a chance at keeping Dean happy.
This Thursday's chapter is half done and depending on how draining work is I might have to skip it too, but I'll do my best.
Dean stutters to a halt there, unable to carry on just now. He needs a moment to gather himself, needs some kind of intervention from Cas.
Sam is really fucking fed up of things that make no sense and that he doesn’t understand, but because he’s Sam, he makes it his job to try and change that. He’s methodical about it, taps his fingers against Cas’s chest, the place where Dean’s head is pillowed. The result is... interesting.
Dean’s face blanks, devoid of expression as the world plummets out from under him. His extremities are tingling and his stomach roils and heaves. It takes everything he has not to throw up on his shoes. He doesn’t even hear the next words over the ringing in his ears.
“I dunno, Dean. Maybe he just wanted to get a little space, clear his head. For all we know he’s on his way back to the bunker as we speak.”
Something touches his shoulder and he surges to his feet, lashes out with his fists. He connects solidly with something and keeps on punching, over and over and over. Whatever it is doesn’t flinch, doesn’t even try and dodge. Fuck, man. It’s gotta be something big, something powerful come to rip him into pieces.
She grins, the look of a raging pyrotechnic being given full excuse to play with explosions, hits the button.
He turns back towards the door, and as he does a flash of green catches his eye on the otherwise white bedspread. For a moment he thinks it’s going to be a letter, a fucking letter to break up with him, and he won’t read that, he can’t.
All the energy goes out of Dean and he slumps down on the bed. He knows he has to get the ball rolling on this, start saving Cas, but right now, he can’t make himself get up.
Dean brushes it off with a snort, starts fiddling around with the coffee machine in a blatant attempt to end the conversation. Sam’s not having that though. He’s still not entirely sure what’s going on, feels like he’s missing something, something obvious.
And one that isn’t going to be broken tonight, Cas realises, as Dean sighs, stands up and sneaks out of the room.
Okay, wow. Rude. How dare he not be utterly charmed. Dean returns sulkily back to his table and elbows Cas to try and wake him up and complain.
“Well according to an article I read on the dangers of— don’t fucking laugh. According to this article if you smoke alcohol it goes directly to your head and makes you like twice as drunk.”
Sam is glad for the rain, and the darkness. It makes it feel like just another hunt, another grave to be dug up and then filled. Not like the time when he’d taken a shovel and cracked earth in Pontiac, Illinois. It’d been unseasonably warm back then, even for May, sun glaring down on him the entire time. A beautiful fucking day to bury your brother.
Instead of fretting and buzzing around the bunker impotently, he makes himself sit down on the sofa next to Sam to watch dumb fucking junk TV. And if he sits a little closer than he usually would, so that one of his long legs is gently brushing Sam’s even fucking longer one, Sam doesn’t mention anything.
“Some people would pay to see me play with my gun and you get to do it for free.” He says with a wink, to which Cas smiles and rolls his eyes fondly. “But no. You’re gonna shoot wherever you want – on the target, around the target, whatever – and I’ve gotta try and get a hit in touching it.”
He runs his hand along Cas’s side. He grunts, tries to bury his head in Dean’s shirt, like he wants to burrow down in there and never come back out.
His first thought is police, his second thought is maybe it’s someone with a camera and a mic and when he opens the door they’re gonna point at him and laugh and yell GOTCHA. Okay, maybe that’s not exactly something he expects, maybe that’s more just wishful thinking.
“Cas, I know you’re not in a good place right now, but I need to ask you some questions.” Cas doesn’t give any sign he’s heard, but Sam carries on regardless. “Can you remember the name of the angel who did this to you?”
“I mean, you can tell them about the necklace, maybe don’t tell them that I used it to cast a spell on you.”
“I’m gonna get him so fucking drunk, make him get something real embarrassing.” Dean says, grinning.
Cas nods, a slight smile in lieu of a thank you. Neither of them says anything for a while, but there’s a soft-edged sort of tension in the air, a feeling of a conversation only half had.
Possibly, Charlie thinks. We don’t know why he went after Cas, but she’s betting it wasn’t random chance – and from what little Sam has told her, the angel went to great lengths to torture Cas as thoroughly as possible. Sounds like a hell of a vindictive bastard.
“Nothing.” Sam says, before she can say anything. She looks at him, surprised, but doesn’t contradict him.
"So… Did you? You know," Sam trails off with bouncing eyebrows, mimicking a cheesy approximation of bad porn music.
“Dean, this is awesome!” Sam exclaims, holding Dean away from him by the shoulders. There are unshed tears in his eyes and Dean isn’t sure when this little celebration turned into something serious, but Sam steps away and runs a finger beneath his eyes and offers quietly, “Mom and Dad would love him.”
Dean always gives the prankiest gifts, but every year, Sam holds out for the one time he might get something actually thoughtful. This year’s package is in a hefty box that feels, well, squishy. He doesn’t want to open it, but Dean counts down from three, ripping Christmas paper revealing two plain white boxes. Sam knows Dean’s getting a new gun cleaning kit, but his own gift is still a mystery.
There’s a good amount of foot traffic on the street: students heading to and from classes, folks dressed in casual suits and skirts going for drinks after work, parents with their kiddos on their way to the museums and parks nearby. Each group slows as they pass Dean and Claire, an odd couple for sure, but no one passes without a smile or dropping their change in Claire’s case.
“Becky Rosen,” the woman titters in a high, enthused tone. “How can I help you, gentlemen?” She leads them toward the edge of the parking lot, closer to the park where several large trees shade them. Castiel has clammed up, so Dean carries the conversation for them, explaining the exhibit and concluding with their desire to meet with Chuck for an interview.
When Bobby called with a salt-n-burn in Snowflake, Arizona, Sam and Dean hadn’t given it much thought, just packed extra rock salt shells for the shotgun and gassed up. Now though, crowbar held aloft, Dean wished he’d asked more questions. He flicked his lighter into the pile of robes and chains, breathing hard and focused on his task. Sam limped into the room crowbar ready, just as the flames started to engulf their vengeful spirit. It may have been comical under different circumstances, killing the literal Ghost of Christmas Future, but right then, they were just happy to be alive.
“When we first met, I gave you the change from my coffee and you smiled at me. I went to work that first day and managed to review all of Charlie’s notes on the exhibit which I found daunting, until that point. Every day, I dropped my change, you smiled, and I got more work done than I had in a month.
ring out through the speakers for the forty-seventh time that night. Dean, in all his red-flannel, perfectly-coiffed glory growls at them from the karaoke stage. They shut up and endure the two minutes of auditory torture.
Dean loves watching the transit station slowly yawn awake, filling up with all sorts of people eager to begin their day. He tries not to choose favorites among his audience, typically moves on to the next city before that happens, but Joshua keeps him tethered, and there's a little girl who darts away from her mother, through grown-up legs, right up to his case and drops a little scrap of paper inside each morning. They're little pictures: a bird, tree, and globe.  Yesterday’s drawing was his absolute favorite - his mother's guitar, complete with Sam and Dean's initials that the boys scratched into its body with a small pocket knife when they were six and ten. Dean had spent the rest of the afternoon writing her a song.
Castiel manages to underestimate how sneaky Charlie can get when she thinks he’s hiding something from her. He has caught her trying to hack his work email, and after a conversation on boundaries in the workplace, Castiel locks himself in the men’s room upstairs and laments to Dean during a frantic phone call, that he’s not sure he can do this anymore. Dean reminds him that he booked Ghostfacers outside of his work email, that they’ve only spoken over the phone, and that there is no real reason for Charlie to find out about their surprise.
Thirty minutes later, they bid Claire farewell, and make their way to the museum. Castiel has a dozen pages of notes and six more names of local buskers to interview. Dean takes the list from Castiel’s hands and promises to speak with them if Castiel will email him the list of questions.
Dean’s eyes widen and his lips part, leaving him looking stunned. It’s over in a flash, his expression smoothing to something carefully blank, but hopeful as he asks, “What is it you want, Cas?”
Castiel lifts the messenger bag from around his shoulders and hangs it on the hook inside the workroom door. The large table is covered with the instruments that will go up for installation next month. There’s already an empty space where the first set has been carted away, up to the exhibit hall on the main floor. It’s been blocked off to the public with a banner displaying the upcoming exhibit. The guitars, flutes, and drums will be displayed adjacent to the quilt Anael restored, the exhibition space rather limited given the niche subject of their collection.
It wouldn’t be so bad if the King of Sinful Sots didn’t subject the audience members to each of the Grinch’s horrific descriptions, but you can only have termites in your smile, or your brain filled with spiders so many times before you go crazy.
“Seriously, though, Dean. It’s been forever since you had someone. Maybe this'll be good for you,” Sam claims when they finally calm. “What’s his big quest anyway?”
He rounds the corner to the kitchen and barrels into Dean, who grunts, stammering, eyes drifting above the doorway.  A blush spreads across his cheeks. Castiel kisses him quick and sweet. Dean tastes whipped cream and pumpkin pie, and Cas can't help but tease, "We don't need mistletoe to kiss, Dean. But on the other hand, it is rather festive."
The statuesque woman looks momentarily taken by surprise but quickly recovers, a genuine smile turning up the corners of her mouth.
Dean breathes deeply and Castiel watches the place where Dean’s amulet is hidden beneath his shirt emit a gentle, pulsing glow. Castiel researched the amulet after their first meeting with Chuck. His notes are still in the file, but he remembers it as a talisman, a sort of channeling device for the bard’s power. With his suspicions confirmed, it’s easy to fill in the blanks, explain the unusual charm Dean possesses.
He knocks out a staccato on the office door and doesn’t wait to be let in, turning the knob to bombard his brother with an over-eager smile. Sam jumps a foot in the air from the racket Dean’s made but settles once he sees who’s in the doorway.
“I’d like that,” Castiel says simply, giving Dean a smile that shows his gum line, even though he’s always been self-conscious about it, but Dean beams back at him and he feels warm all over again.
With everything set for Charlie’s exhibit and the woman herself back in action, Castiel goes back to his regular routine. He highlights items in the collection on the museum’s social media sites and tries to throw in an instrument every now and then to keep the public’s interest in the upcoming exhibit. He meets with local researchers and students, showing them textiles and pottery and providing reading resources and support for their own projects.
“Thanks, Cas,” he says into the microphone they have set up in the space cleared for the performers. “This one’s for you.” He winks and strums a little louder, playing through all the songs he’s written for Cas over the last nine months. He usually watches the crowd while he performs, paying careful attention to the emotions passing between them and him, but tonight, he only has eyes for Cas. Cas, who is staring back at him with his ocean eyes brimming with tears. It makes his heart soar and his amulet warm with the love between them.
?" Sam chucks a pillow at his head and both brothers spend the night reminiscing about all the pranks they played on each other as kids, including the month Dean woke Sam up with that particular song every morning before sunrise.
He shifts his weight, so he can get a hand between them, running his palm along the planes of Castiel's side and stomach. He's close to his goal when Castiel grabs for his wrist and drags their hands away. Cas breaks their kiss to breathe out, "Just this, ok?"
Seated next to Dean at table 6, Cas faces the wedding party with his usual perplexity. He’s propositioned by more women than Dean can count: his big, sad eyes just reel 'em in. Sad eyes at a wedding is like some kind of magic sex potion. Dean knows this, because the longer the night goes on, the sadder Dean gets, and the more drunk girls ‘accidentally’ fall into his lap. He sends them on their way with a smile that isn’t one, really, and tries not to feel as alone as he does. He doesn’t bring girls home anymore. Hasn’t for a while.
“Anything,” Cas says, which Dean knows (from experience, decades of it) isn’t true. There’s shit-tons he can say to Cas that won’t make Cas feel any less lost in the world. Dean’s been saying that kind of stuff all his life. Hearing it, too. And he doesn’t have it in his heart — he doesn’t have it in him, anywhere — to pass that bag of nothing off on Cas. So he goes the other way, instead: he dives right off the pier into the ocean. Because fuck it, right? That’s what Cas wants; that’s what Cas gets.
Besides, he’s followed his kid brother’s example and gotten himself a job. Liquor distribution, apparently, pays for two nice bedrooms and a bath: two bedrooms, not one, because Cas comes with him. He's taking fucking forever to adjust. He still doesn’t have a job. He can barely buy groceries. And Dean's pretty sure, at this point, that he’s
Sam had questions, but they could wait. He couldn't remember the last time he'd felt so goddamned close to deceased. He staggered down the hall with an almost rudely curt “you ok?” spoken sideways, as he passed them. Dean gave him a nod, looking as fucked as Sam felt.
“You don't understand. I’m- I’m not sure of my ability to allow this to happen,” Cas clarifies, and now Dean stops. The hand on Cas’ shoulder tightens.
Sam turns off his phone when he leaves on his honeymoon, which throws Dean for a gut-wrenching loop. The only other times they've been no-contact, Sam's been dead, dying, or at college.
There’s no way Cas takes him up on that, and Dean knows it. He creases a small smile into his face and sits back again, straighter, but exhausted. Cas finally reaches the little chair at the side of Dean’s bed and balances, rather than sits, on its very edge.
“Do you feel better?” Cas ventures. Dean decides that Cas will no longer be allowed to watch daytime television. Not when this sort of touchy-feely Dr. Phil mumbo-jumbo is what’s making it into his head.
There were sounds Sam knew that he wished he didn’t. Squishes, squelches, slaps. The sound of sex for money, and sex for free. A man behind the bar. A man behind the hotel. Women absolutely everywhere. Fake moans. (Were they all fake? Because when Dean got off by himself, he might as well have been dead.) Dirty talk, pet names, murmurs of approval: all different, every time. It was weird, wasn’t it? That Dean didn’t have a default? He seemed to manufacture the whole thing from scratch every time, from pitch to act to vocabulary. It was weird to Sam that he still didn't know — not that he
He’s been working a real-person job for just over a month when he starts skipping out on family dinner. And yeah, Dean’s aware that sloppy takeout's not worth much, but it’s
Every morning after, he finds Cas playing guardian angel in his bed, and past the fourth day, Dean stops bitching about it, as long as Cas leaves quickly and quietly and doesn’t ask him to talk about whatever it is that’s wrong.
Cas doesn’t like ‘okay’. It feels like he’s being dismissed. Shut out. Like Dean’s giving up on him. And the look on Dean’s face doesn’t help any. He’s focused down and away, like he can see the skin under his hands, the swallow in Cas’ throat.
When he wakes up from a string of paranoiac drunken nightmares, it's still dark. He tries to turn over onto his back like that might help the spins, but runs aground on something butted up between his shoulder blades.
happy — I would’ve done it thirty years ago. I’d do it now. I’d do it yesterday. But I can't. He's here. We're stuck." He chews at nothing. "I love him. I can't not. He knows it. But he’s died more than I’m willing to remember, and I promise you- I
for any way in. Any weakness, Cas, any little crack in the wall.” He looks away for a minute. “If you have something, it goes bad. Mom and dad. Jessica. Lisa and Ben. Even Sam and me, I mean, how many times…” He drifts off. “That’s the lay of the land, here, all right? If it means something to you, it’s gone.”
But, “No,” is all Dean repeats, until Cas stops making empty promises. He finally gets Cas’ eyes clear and lets his thumbs rest on his cheekbones, the back of Cas’ head braced in his fingertips. “Listen to me,” he says, trying to anchor Cas’ focus, moving into his jumpy gaze. “No matter what happens, I need you to keep it together, alright? I need you to be here for Sam.”
Then Sam heard Cas for the first time since he and Dean had gone into the bedroom together. Cas was hard to hear. His holy-gravel voice blended too well into the mechanicals, the furnace, the fridge, and sometimes Sam wondered if he only spoke out loud when they were all together. Ever since Cas had left his mark on Dean, it felt like half of what he said was silent, and beamed directly into Dean’s head.
Cas gets used to the human weirdness of sticky skin, of noses where they shouldn’t be, of full-body contact and the perilously heavy grinding that Dean likes. It’s nice to be dragged down by the baseness of of what Dean wants: nice like being lit on fire. After thousands of years living in a junkless Heaven only to be set free upon Dean’s earth, Cas can’t get enough.
“Yeah,” Dean sighs. “I know.” On his breath, resignation rolls over cold, like talking about the box is worse than the box itself will ever be. He stirs again on the bed, shoving himself up against the headboard. “C’mon, then. Let’s get this over with.”
Cas’ whole chest jolts, heart to ribs to spine. Hearing it put so concretely is a misery. Dean will be under the water. Dean will be at the bottom of the ocean. In a box. Completely alone. Cas suddenly slips out of breath and tries to gasp it back, and can't. His head fills like a brick, and his shoulders grab up like wings, trying to force air he doesn't need into a body that doesn't technically live, until Dean’s hands comes down on them.
Hurt shines out of Cas’ eyes at his tone, and Dean seems surprised, and relents. He doesn’t say anything in apology, but he gives Cas a deliberately softer look of exasperation and hopes he’ll settle for it.
“I get it,” Dean says. “Believe me, I get it. I told you; this doesn't make it easier.” He firms his grip and gives Cas’ head a little shake, so small. It’s an instruction:
“It’s just me ‘n my brother, Sammy, now. He’s gonna be a big-shot lawyer when he’s done at Stanford. Quit the band before we lost our parents though.”
“Hello, Angel,” Charlie replies on a snorting laugh, stepping away from the door to let the men inside.
He stands in front of his bathroom mirror, squeezing toothpaste onto his toothbrush, and realizes that he's humming. He suspects he may have been for most of the day. It's the song from the man at the transit station. Wildflowers and honeybees. He drops his toothbrush in the sink with a clatter. He flinches at the sound, spits out a mouthful of suds and rinses out his mouth.
"No, bitch, just got up from a nap," it's a bald-faced lie and they both know it; Dean never sleeps on his back. Let alone uncovered. Even when he doesn't have a blanket, Dean uses his flannel to cover as much of himself as possible.
“Yes. There’s a man, Dean Winchester, who performs at the transit station I take into work each day. I asked him for lunch, to get his perspective on street performers as modern-day bards.”
That night, Dean lulls himself to sleep with the song he wrote for the blue-eyed man, the quilt pulled high over his shoulders.
After an hour, he’s decompressed enough for a brief conversation. He turns his desk chair to face Anael and offers to the quiet room, “The interview went well.”
She sends a gif of Buffy Summers spinning a stake and Dean can’t help it; he snorts, right in the middle of the cafe, all the tension draining from his shoulders. He shoots her back a gif of Spike posing for the cameras and decides to embrace this newfound turn of luck. He rides his high all the way to Sam’s office and never once feels self-conscious about the people around him.
“Who’s the most relatable character in a Christmas movie?” Claire asks everyone gathered around the fire in Jody’s living room.
In addition to his regular group of friends, Dean also has a dozen students in Palo Alto who meet him at Robles Park after school to learn the guitar. Castiel helped him set up the ad on the local community board, and Sam has been nothing but encouraging.  It is by far the most rewarding thing he’s ever done, and it’s helped bring some much-needed stability to his life. He has a feeling his parents would be proud of him.
“I couldn’t resist. It’s one of Charlie’s absolute favorites, and she said the same thing the first time she visited the museum,” Castiel explains, wiping tears from eyes with the back of his hand.
He meets Castiel outside the Arts Guild where he’s just finished meeting with a man named Cain. They walk together to the park from there, and Dean tries not to be jealous of the older man while Castiel gushes over their shared love of honey bees and how the man invited Castiel to his home to see his apiary. It’s hard to be upset though when Castiel beams up at him with his bright blue eyes. He is such a goner.
The night before Christmas, all through the Bunker, guests grooved to Zeppelin, partaking in hunter’s helper.
Becky opens her mouth for another run-on sentence when the small group of seniors break into polite applause.  Becky takes the card and bounces off to meet Chuck. Dean huffs out a sigh and Castiel turns to him with a bemused look on his face.
“Uh-huh,” he's still not sure what’s going on between them, but Chuck’s eyes drift down to his throat, his right hand coming away from Dean’s shoulder to root his amulet from beneath his shirt.
Waiting for Dean to return his text had been some sort of torture, but just before he decided to head to bed that evening, Dean texted him back:
is haunted, but also can’t be sure. He shoves the box back onto its shelf and jogs up the stairs to find Dean already halfway through
“Anael, one of my co-workers, sent me a list of local artists this morning. It seems there’s much to be done all of a sudden.” Castiel grabs the bags with their food from Alfie since Dean carries his guitar on his back and the pair make for Claire’s usual spot.
Castiel wakes early on the morning of the exhibit opening and takes the opportunity to kiss Dean awake. They spend an inordinate amount of time tangled under the sheets, until his alarm goes off and they get themselves up, sated and happy, to share a shower. Dean makes them an extravagant breakfast of bacon, eggs, toast, and jelly. They share kisses between bites and go over the plan for the day. Castiel works a full day and the exhibit opening isn’t until five that evening, so Dean will be able to give his guitar lessons and get home in time for them to change before heading back to the museum.
“Dunno. I mean, I think Claire impacted you, too. But our bond might overshadow what you get from the other bards.”
“Smells awesome, Cas,” Dean announces, stepping through the arched doorway into the kitchen. The room is all dark cherry cabinets and full-sized appliances, and it’s Castiel’s favorite room in the place. He always makes an excuse to feed any company that’s present.
He almost forgets to be nervous in the face of what feels an awful lot to his heart like Dean is coming home.
once when he was twelve before he stated setting traps in the family home. His parents were shocked to say the least. They had no idea when Ed watched the film – they thought it was too violent.
"For the girl, dude. Get your head out of the gutter," he mutters taking a drink from Sam's water bottle, which he quickly snatches back and places behind his desk.  Dean distracts himself by unwinding the red wax from around the cheese wheel, popping the entire thing in his mouth at once. Sam snorts at Dean's expense and finishes his veggie stir fry.
He sets a bright teal bag on the work table, adjusting it a bit so as not to disturb the contents inside. He boots up his desktop computer, and jiggles the mouse to wake up the monitors, then picks up the watering can to give all the plants a quick drink.  He’s thinking about how beautiful Dean’s freckles look in the early morning light, and how the bard has moved in with him a few weeks after they made things official.
Antlers tangling in the overhead lights and rear end knocking over a bookcase. In hindsight, perhaps giving Sam a cursed firearm from the Men of Letters’ box of junk wasn’t the best idea. But when you wait until Christmas Eve to get your giant baby brother a gift, what the hell do you expect, really? As Sammoose turns to charge Dean, fire in his eyes, he thinks maybe another skin mag from the Gas ‘n Sip would’ve sufficed.
“Please read over the highlighted parts? I’d like to know if any of what that says is true,” he requests, hesitant. He watches Dean skim over the passages he found in Charlie’s notes, back before they knew each other’s names. “I know it sounds crazy, but I think it…fits. Somehow. That you might be a, an um…”
“So get this: Garth invited us to Secret Santa again,” Sam announced, waving the gaudy invitation and setting the rest of the junk mail on the map table.
Sam isn't expecting anything so personal from Dean and it shows clearly on his face. Dean picks up his guitar and plays a chord. "Whaddaya say to
“All the same, I’ve come across something in Charlie’s research that I’d like your opinion on,” he continues. Dean’s eyes dart to where his hands are shaking, and he clasps them together to hide his nerves.
He’s reading an article on Parisian troubadours and recalls the handful of times he’s attended Moondoor events at Charlie’s behest. He had spent most of the day in the queen’s royal tent set-up near the tree line of the local community park. She had led a fierce battle with thirty soldiers against the villainous Shadow King and arose victorious once more. The occasion had been marked by a great feast where turkey legs and veggie burgers were grilled over parks and recreation-approved fire pits.
Lisa Braeden was a woman Dean had met on his way through Cicero, Indiana twelve years before. She was a yoga instructor, beautiful, and made a habit of hanging out where he played at the edge of the Gas ‘n Sip parking lot. He stayed the entire summer. It’s still the longest he’s ever spent in one place. Sometime in late August, she came banging on his motel door in tears and confessed that she was pregnant.  He was willing to stick around, do the right thing, but the timing was all wrong. She’d been with a long haul trucker the month before Dean rolled into town, and she was certain it was his baby. She called the other man and he was on his way and she couldn’t see Dean anymore. He checked out of the motel the next morning with a broken heart and hadn’t spoken to her since. He thought about the kid all the time though, wondered what it might be like to start that apple pie life someday.
Castiel steps out of the bus doors and waits on the platform as the bus carries him away, he lifts his hand to wave and Castiel returns the gesture, the distance growing until the bus turns and Castiel disappears from sight. He fingers the amulet around his neck with renewed fondness until the bus pulls into the stop near Sam’s apartment. He pulls the guitar case strap over his head and feels the weight of the instrument ground him.
Sam trudged through the door, freshly showered and eager to collapse into bed, maybe sleep for eight to ten years. The banshee they killed in Iowa had put up a helluva fight.
Dean stares down at the phone, shocked at her words. He’s still contemplating how he wants to reply when the dots bounce along next to her name. He decides to wait for her to finish.
He all but blurts out the accusation.  It’s not the phrasing he wants to use, not the direction he wants to steer the conversation. Dean finishes rinsing the plate and shuts off the tap, turning slowly to face him, eyes searching his face. He’s flushed, can feel his cheeks burning under Dean’s gaze until his eyes dart down to the pages he holds in his hands.  Dean pulls the towel from beneath the pizza stone and wipes his hands carefully. Dean looks to be stalling. He wonders if Dean somehow knows what's on the page.
Dean uncaps the bottle and takes a drink. He doesn't want to tell Sam about Blue Eyes, and he really doesn't want to admit to spending the last six or so hours crafting his best work to date. It's strange how easily the man has gotten under Dean's skin.
"I assure you they're all softballs," Castiel tells him with a grin. "To start, the idea for the exhibit belongs to my good friend, Charlie. She's the curator for the museum and wants to showcase some of the more exotic instruments we have in our collection. Part of our mission is to tie in all exhibits to the community in a significant way, and Charlie left that part of the planning for last. I recently inherited her project, and our interaction yesterday inspired me to delve into the idea of street performers, like yourself, as a sort of modern-day bard."
Castiel is supposed to be cleaning the chimney, not in anticipation of Santa, but because he'd noticed a slight burning smell the last time it was lit and put the task on his self-imposed Honey-Do List. The colloquialism makes him smile, thinking of the bees that helped heal his mind.
“All right, you three, enough work. Let’s play,” Gilda chides, and pulls Anson into her lap so he can help her roll the dice.
They each sit, and Dean wipes his hands down his thighs as Castiel flips the corner of the papers up to a dog-eared point, then smooths it down again. Neither have made eye contact. The silence stretches between them. The air conditioner in the living room rattles.
Castiel feels lighter than he can ever remember on the short walk to the museum. Anael perks up when he gets down to the basement, eager to hear about the interview. He isn’t quite ready to divulge his feelings though and makes a polite excuse of needing to type up Dean’s answers while they’re still fresh in his mind. She gives him his space, threading a needle and making precise stitches along the loose hemline of the quilt.
Dean spends all his free time over the next few months running down leads on local musicians and meeting with Cas for morning cups of coffee, afternoon lunches, and weekend evenings with Charlie and Gilda for game nights and babysitting Anson. He replaces Sam’s couch with a queen-size hide-a-bed and makes himself comfortable, starts pitching in on rent, and Sam stops asking him over for lunch at Stanford. It seems he’s met a woman named Madison, another legal TA, who occupies his office hours these days.
Castiel shifts his canvas grocery bag higher on his arm and takes a deep breath. He spares a glance at Dean, and the pair are still staring at each other when the door swings open on its hinges, revealing Charlie in all her bubbly, exasperated glory. Dean and Castiel each jump, shoulders knocking, and the bag slips down Castiel’s arm to be deftly caught by Dean. They’re a little frazzled, and Charlie is eating it up with a spoon, thrilled that her best friend has been rendered nearly useless by the man next to him.
“Anson makes for excellent company. Isn’t that right, sir,” Castiel asks, bouncing the toddler on his hip until the boy wriggles out of his arms to tear off into the kitchen.
“I did,” Cas affirms into the microphone as Ed and Harry join Dean on stage. “Please welcome to the stage, Ghostfacers.”
“Are you alright, man?” Dean is starting to worry, he can tell and it’s throwing him from the speech he had prepared before texting the musician to stop by.
He clicks through the open tabs of the browser until he finds the article he’d found earlier in the day and reads under his breath, “
The Ghostfacers finally relinquish the stage to Chuck, who brings the atmosphere back down in an easy transition and the crowd disperses to walk the halls and reap the rewards of their hard work. Castiel tucks himself into Dean’s side and watches everyone interact with different instruments they’ve set up for public use. There are photos of each of the local buskers, taken while they perform with placards of information. One wall displays a large map of Palo Alto, pins carefully placed, marking all the places the musicians can be found.
