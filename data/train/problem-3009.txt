“Yes! He’s working really hard on it,” Dean hissed back.
Cas hoped Dean would enjoy the museum as much as he did. Or at least not hate it. Cas felt surprisingly anxious as he stood outside SFMOMA waiting. He shouldn’t be this nervous. He’d spent plenty of time with Dean by now. But this was a date, an actual date, and Cas had suggested it.
Dean returned the salute and thoughtfully sipped his beer. He remembered listening to those songs as a teenager and revelling in the fact that John Winchester, straightest man in the world, would unwittingly play rock songs with guys singing about—as far as Dean was concerned—anal sex. It felt like there was a subtle rebellion in reframing the narrative of those lyrics in a way his father was sure to disapprove of.
They both sat there in awkward silence for a moment, clearly uncertain what to do after this declaration of familial affection. Then Gabriel’s usual smirk slid back into place.
Hauling a broken old car across the state definitely hadn’t been the easiest solution. Even if Bobby hadn’t known any local scrap dealers or mechanics, it only would have taken a few calls to get someone to take it off his hands instead of paying to take it home with him. But he knew what the Impala meant to the boys, especially Dean. Bobby still denied it, but he’d saved the car for him.
Dean snorted, but he was rather partial to hot women who kicked ass too. He watched the chick in the metal bikini as a brunette came over and kissed her on the cheek.
“He didn’t fall for the honey trap some other PI set up with a woman!”
“Yes, thank you.”
“It’s hardly an orgy’s worth,” Cas said, tilting his head.
Dean was the one that John had really been pissed at when he’d lashed out at Sam. Generally, John just wanted someone to take his frustrations out on and it didn't matter who. It wasn't that often that he got violent. Dean knew not to annoy him and to keep Sam out of the way when he was drinking, so he figured he could handle it. He did handle it, for years, until he messed up.
“You call it that because it’s where we go when we’re not hunting. It’s ironic,” Cas explained.
Plus, Dean knew the places Cas liked to eat, and they were generally the places he liked to eat too. And, given Gabriel’s reaction to the vegan pancakes and the insane amount of sugary syrup he was currently consuming, his choice of venue probably wasn't going to be some shitty health food place. So, only a quarter of Dean’s family brunches would be inedible instead of half of them. It was worth welcoming Gabriel into the fold just for that.
As it turned out, Dean hadn't done a lot more to Cas when they got home. After the drive back, the initial adrenaline and urgency of their first encounter had ebbed and Dean wondered if he ought to be taking things slow. He had taken Cas to his room and slowly stripped him out of his clothes, most of his clothes anyway. He had left their boxers on. They had gotten into bed and simply cuddled. Cas had seemed happy just to be close to him and Dean, well, Dean Casanova Winchester had actually been hesitant to take things further. He was kind of nervous... a lot nervous... sort of paralysed by fear in fact. Being God's gift to women didn’t really guarantee also being God’s gift to men, or, more specifically, to Cas.
“Well, technically, it was a ‘Church’,” Cas said and managed to make the accompanying air quotes extra sarcastic. “We didn't pay taxes anyway. But in practice, it was pretty much a cult. We had the whole charismatic but authoritarian leader thing. We were encouraged not to socialise with anyone outside the Church and expected to shun those who left the Church or didn't follow the rules. And there were a lot of rules. Rules and hate were pretty much the defining tenets of The Blessed Children of God. It was sort of like Westboro without the picketing.”
“Mmm hmm,” Sam murmured in a sceptical tone that made Dean want to punch him through the phone. “Look, I don’t have time to play referee between you and your husband right now. Can you just hang tight for a few days? I’m on the witch’s trail. I’m close but if I pull back now, we might lose her.”
thought he was a killjoy, that must make him some kind of joy serial killer.
“Of course I know him- he's your husband! Wait, you don’t know him?” asked Sam, flummoxed.
Cas smiled at him and then went back to watching the players with a thoughtful squint. Dean moved closer and sat wedged against him, shoulder to shoulder with Cas’s warmth spilling over into him, for the rest of the game. He shot Cas glances every so often to see his reaction if something interesting happened on the field. But mostly, he just sat and watched the game and appreciated having a normal day with an extraordinary husband.
“She doesn't take anyone seriously.”
“Me too,” Dean said and bent to kiss Cas.
“Hey,” Charlie said suddenly. “Don’t Led Zepp have an album called
“Cas, Cas,” Dean cried.
Dean kissed Cas after he rose. It was just meant to be a quick peck on the cheek but Cas grabbed him and licked deep inside his mouth. He knew Cas could taste his own come and there was something about that he loved. Getting Cas a little dirty made him seem more touchable, like he wasn’t so far above Dean that it scared him sometimes. When the kiss broke, Cas made a move as if to kneel himself. Dean wasn’t usually one to discourage Cas from any indecent acts he was willing to engage in, but there had to be a limit, didn’t there?
Dean stood in front of his open fridge for a while until he could practically hear Sam’s voice snarking at him for letting all the cold air out. What to make for breakfast? Bacon was a given, but he didn’t know if he wanted scrambled eggs or pancakes to go with the best meat known to man. He tapped his fingers thoughtfully on the top of the fridge door.
Dean should have known better than to admit anything, especially when Sam was home. He should have been paying better attention to John’s mood, but John had only had a couple of beers. He was at the relaxed stage of tipsy, rather than the mean stage of drunk that Dean knew to watch out for. He should have remembered that John’s mood could turn on a dime, though, especially when he’d been drinking. It didn’t take much for him to get angry, even when he wasn’t six beers in.
We’re filming it locally. That’s why I moved. We’re thinking of doing all our filming out here. It’s cheaper than LA without having to go all the way out to somewhere like Vancouver. I mean, who on earth wants to film in Vancouver?”
want to.”
“Yeah, I know,” Cas said quietly.
“Worry,” Cas finished. “More than you need to.” He pressed his lips to Dean’s softly.
The latest was whether George R. R. Martin would ever actually release the next

“Well, well, well, look what the cat dragged in,” Meg said when Cas entered his own kitchen half an hour later.
“Then what do you do on Christmas?”
“You think Cas gave you a love potion?” Sam sputtered. “Are you serious? If he’d put some love mojo on you, don’t you think you’d actually love him? And, I don’t know, maybe know who he is?!”
“Me and Meg too. I was so annoyed. I mean it’s the twenty-first century and, what, the twenty-third on
“Happy Christmas, Cas,” Sam said as he handed over a small cylindrical shape covered in Santas.
on Monday. No, that wasn’t right. He knew he couldn’t have seen him. But Cas had
Halfway to Dean’s bedroom, Cas got impatient and shoved Dean up against a wall and started kissing him again. Dean moaned loudly. He loved this. Man or woman, there was something that was such a turn on about having a partner take charge. And sure, sometimes Dean was the one taking charge, and that did it for him too, in a different way, but, God, right now, this was exactly what he wanted, someone to shove him up against a wall and kiss him hard.
“How about you?”
He was feeling strangely disconnected. All week, he’d thrown himself into work, bringing home projects to focus on in his off-hours, trying to minimise the time he had to dwell on the incident. It had worked well enough until the weekend when the thoughts he’d been trying to escape closed in on him. They'd been building momentum for days, so when they caught up with him, the resulting crash was worse than if he’d just confronted them head-on to begin with. But he didn’t want to think about what had happened, he really didn’t.
“What tally?” Dean asked.
“I better get going too. Someone has to keep an eye on this one,” Gabriel said, jerking a thumb at Sam, “or he’ll spend the whole day buried in briefs—and not the fun kind!”
Once he’d caught his breath, Dean drew back to look at Cas. He was wearing a satisfied smile and Dean trailed his fingers over his lips, cherishing that joy. His heart felt full of feelings he couldn’t name. Dean didn’t know that he was crying until he saw a teardrop fall on Cas’s cheek and realised that it was his own. He swiped it away with his thumb and hid his face against Cas’s shoulder, mumbling apologies. Cas squeezed him, tight and reassuring.
“Yeah?” Dean asked and he could hear a hint of pleading in his own voice, like he needed to know how much Cas wanted him more than anything.
There was a picture of Ed and Lorraine Warren, what looked like a newspaper clipping about the DeFeo murders in Amityville, a rosary with onyx beads and silver crucifix, a miniature book about two inches tall that Meg had sculpted with modelling clay to look like the Necronomicon, an old wooden cross, a frankly adorable tiny ‘Annabelle’ Raggedy Ann doll that Meg had sewn herself and a statuette of Pazuzu from
“Would you like to go in?” Cas asked.
He was his own man now, not his father’s chosen, or his instrument, or his successor. And not his father’s victim anymore. His father had no power over him... well, except that which Cas gave him in his own mind and sometimes that was harder to throw off than the actual power his father had had over him. But throw it off he would.
“Do you really think she’s serious?” Dean asked when his insides had stopped doing a happy, little dance.
“What? How did no one you knew have a TV? Were you Amish? Did you grow up in a cult or something?”
“I know I don’t have to worry about her,” Bobby continued. “She’s not gonna come home knocked up because she forgot to take precautions. I can’t say the same for you two.”
fuck—we can do other stuff—but if you wanna, I’ll bottom.”
The most striking thing about the apartment was that the walls were covered in art. Both Cas and Meg were artists, so it wasn’t really surprising that there were a lot of pictures on the walls. Many of them were just prints of artwork they liked, but a fair number were their own work, paintings they’d done or sketches of tattoos they particularly liked.
The front door of their apartment opened straight into the living room, so Cas could see their guest when he glanced over his shoulder. Meg’s girlfriend, a tall, redheaded woman with a regal bearing. Privately, Cas thought she was rather haughty. But she made Meg happy, so Cas could put up with her attitude. Abby was wearing a dark pleated leather skirt, biker jacket, knee-high boots and her usual arrogant expression that Cas thought he saw soften slightly when she looked at Meg.
“No, but I’m the first one you’ve loved.”
Sam smacked his shoulder. “I’m calling you that because you’re being fucking dramatic!”
“So,” Cas whispered in his ear. “What do you want for Christmas?”
Please leave kudos if you liked it because I crave your validation the way Dean craves his father's approval! If you want to leave a comment as well, I'd love to hear from you :)
“It’s...it’s something all right, Cas,” Dean said and kissed him on the cheek, both because he was grateful for the effort Cas was making for him and because the gesture allowed him to hide his face while he got his expression under control. Dean was sure it would be the perfect gift for any meat lover who hadn’t almost suffered a terrible fate at the hands of a turducken.
Dean tried to concentrate, he really did, but being so close to Cas the whole day felt like drawn out foreplay. Admittedly, it was weirdly PG rated foreplay, but, still, Dean felt like his whole body was humming with sexual awareness by the evening. He’d wanted to get Cas back into bed since they left it this morning and the urge had only grown. Something held him back, not so much nerves anymore, he just didn’t want Cas to think this was only about sex, that that was all Dean wanted from him when it so much more. He wanted everything, he wanted all of Cas and he wanted to give the entirety of himself to Cas in return.
“It's pretty funny,” Sam said, doing a poor job of suppressing his own laughter.
Dean’s pocket vibrated. He hit answer, then held the cell between his ear and shoulder so he could keep scrambling eggs.
“You make a cute couple,” the guy said, looking over to the dancefloor where Cas’s erratic arm waving had cleared a small circle around him.
“No, but I suppose we could turn this installation into performance art,” Cas said and shoved Dean up against the back wall and kissed him fiercely.
There’d been a time when Cas had felt pretty crazy. He’d struggled a lot when he first left home. Well, he’d struggled at home too, but he’d done his best to repress his mental health issues just like he repressed everything else then. Cas had thought he’d be fine as soon as he left home. That no longer being around his father would solve all his problems. Turned out his problems were something he carried across the country with him.
“You know, you really can’t pull off that innocent look, Meg.”
“You go. I think I need a minute to catch my breath.”
“Anyhoo, I found someone dreamy too,” Charlie told him, pointing to a pretty woman on the other side of the room.
“Hey,” Cas said, drawing Dean even closer so his side was resting up against Cas’s chest. Dean leant into him because apparently this was another thing he got to do now, have Cas cradle him in his arms. One of his hands was gripping Dean’s hip while the other stroked soothing circles on his back. “How did your talk with Sam go?”
“I’m just... I’m so sorry I hurt you.” Dean felt devastated and vulnerable, so naturally he tried to make a joke of it. “Can I kiss it better?”
Maybe Dean didn't get the relationship, but it seemed to make Sam happy. Sam had worked so hard for years to become a lawyer and even though he'd achieved that dream recently, he'd immediately set a new goal. He was already focused on what he needed to do to work his way up in the firm and become a junior partner. It would be good for Sam to have someone who helped lighten him up.
“No, it wasn’t in the vows; it’s more of an informal undertaking,” Cas said, perfectly seriously. He seemed to be back to not being able to detect sarcasm. “You are a passionate man, Dean. I have just made a habit of being prepared.”
“That's Poirot. Pierrot is the sad clown archetype that was popular in old pantomimes. Plus, there’s ‘Threepenny Pierrot’, the Bowie song. Pierrot was one of his stage personas for a while.”
He turned around and nodded in another direction, toward a cute, young guy holding court at a table of laughing friends.
He’d gone to the museum a lot when he first moved to San Francisco. Cas hadn’t known anyone when he first arrived, and money was scarce. SFMOMA was somewhere he could go alone and visit the exhibitions that were free, which wasn’t all of them but enough that going was worthwhile. Even though he’d been alone, it hadn’t felt uncomfortable in the way that, say, visiting a bar alone would have made him feel and it was less lonely than staying at home was. He could hang out there for hours, enjoying the art and sketching if the mood took him.
Cas was looking at him with an intensity that was hard to see but equally hard to look away from. Dean wished he could accept the strength of Cas’s feelings, the strength of his own. He just wasn’t sure how. Anger was the only thing he truly knew how to feel. It was pure. It filled him up and consumed everything else. It was simple, it meant he didn’t have to feel hurt or hope. Hope was the hardest. He wanted to hope but he was terrified to do so. Scared to want things, scared to believe that he could have them, scared he’d mess them up if he got them. Maybe that was why he kept pushing Cas away. He was going to mess this up. Better on his terms, right? Push Cas to go before he realised how little Dean was worth and left anyway. He didn’t want to push Cas away anymore though. All he wanted was to draw him close. He wanted to take in the love that Cas was looking at him with and wrap it around his heart, where it would keep him warm, where he could keep it safe. Something of his fear must have shown on his face because Cas leant across the table and squeezed his hand.
“I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. She can be surprisingly sensitive. And the sweater’s actually pretty cosy,” Cas said, running his hand down the wool covering his chest.
“Okay.”
“Hello to you too.”
He writhed against Dean slightly, not having the leverage to thrust properly, as he clearly wanted to.
Talking about Dean’s job led to talking about Cas’s job, which led to talking about tattoos more. Then they discussed art, then books, then movies, then music... then they discussed positions.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas stroked his fingers through Dean’s hair as he looked up at him. Cas’s gaze had always been intense, but right now his eyes were burning through the last of Dean’s defences. Peeling back the layers of cockiness and insouciance that Dean normally hid behind. It felt like Cas could see right to the very core of him. Dean felt safe yet vulnerable at the same time. He knew Cas could be trusted with everything he was, but it was still strange to be this exposed. He was naked in a way that went far beyond taking his clothes off. Baring his body had always been something Dean was comfortable with, but baring his soul was new and terrifying.
Maybe he just needed a nap, but going back to sleep didn’t seem that tempting when he couldn’t curl his body around Dean’s like he had earlier this morning. And where had that thought come from? He barely knew the guy. Sure, he was hot... and funny... and interesting... but Cas was not a cuddler and he didn’t do relationships. He barely did two-night stands.
“Why? You said you're not interested in women like that, so here we are. Gay guys.” Dean gestured round the bar. "Gay guys as far as the eye can see," he said, looking at Cas very directly in a way he couldn’t quite decipher. Cas cursed the fact that sometimes he still-
“Want with you, want with you?!” The lights in the room flickered. A shadow of wings too big to fit in the little cabin blinked in and out behind the man. The binding fell from his wrists with a sizzle. “I am you husband and I want you to get in bed when I tell you to!” he snapped in guttural voice. It sent shivers down Dean’s spine. He wasn’t sure if they were shivers of fear or something else, and he didn’t know if it was the voice or what was said that caused them.
They lingered in the kitchen nursing beers long after the food was gone. Sam finally left the table around the time Dean and Cas started playing footsie under it. That was fine, he’d eaten all his turducken and two slices of pie, so Cas was happy.
Dean and Cas were still smiling at each other a minute later when the waiter finally bellied up to the table. The service there was as bad as the food. It was the same creepy guy as last time and Dean only just stopped himself from threatening to punch the guy in the face if he affirmated him again. He ordered the shitty vegan pancakes since there was nothing better on the menu, though without the bacon this time—vegan bacon was an abomination.
“How are you feeling?”
Dean stood by the bed in their room, smiling at a delightfully flustered Cas.
“Maybe we should talk about that later, in private,” Dean said, reaching out to pat Cas’s knee. Cas just nodded silently and went back to studying the picture, tilting his head in the other direction to look at it from a different angle.
Cas laughed, the sound rich and deep. “You’re gonna let me, huh?”
He felt worse for failing to feel better. Unresolved trauma, Ash had called it. Leaving the situation might work for some people. Just having space might be enough for them to heal. But that certainly wasn’t always the case, nor was that necessarily the likely outcome. A wound that wasn’t treated could easily fester, and ignoring it wasn’t a solution. Which was fine in theory, but sometimes he hadn’t been able to do anything but ignore it and that was a hard habit to break when it had been his main coping mechanism for so long.
Since his input into breakfast didn’t seem necessary, Castiel shuffled silently into the bathroom. Dean had given Cas back his phone when he found his own in his duffle yesterday, so he took it with him into the small room. He turned the shower on so he wouldn’t be overheard and rang Sam.
“You sit.” Cas pointed to the chair that Dean was still half in. “I’m cooking for you for once,” he said firmly.
“Right, okay, yeah,” Dean said, accepting the apology ungraciously.
I tried to stick mostly to art that’s actually at SFMOMA, but I just couldn’t help giving Dean and Cas a dark corner to go make out in. The shipping container installation is based on
Meg flounced out of the room, leaving the connecting door open. ‘Guided by Angels’ came on over the speakers and Cas looked at Meg to see she was fiddling with her phone as she walked over to Alfie. He wondered if she’d just added the song to her Spotify queue or it was a coincidence.
“Do you want a hand with that?” Dean asked, making a move to rise.
“Okay. Night, Cas.”
“Maybe I am a little peckish,” Dean admitted, in a conciliatory tone. “Thanks.”
Dean shimmied out of his boxers and leant over the side of his bed to grab lube from his duffle bag. He found himself wishing he’d brought a dildo with him too. There were a couple in his bedside table at home. He rarely bothered with them when he jerked off, but pretending a dildo was Cas's cock sounded even better than pretending his hand was Cas's hand.
Cas kept kissing him but shifted his torso away from Dean’s just enough to get his hand between their bodies. He stroked down Dean’s chest and stomach all the way to his hard length and then wrapped his hand around him. Dean thrust up eagerly into his fist. But he wanted more, he needed more.
“I'm bi, dude. I like guys and I like Cas and I'm bi,” Dean said in rush, words tumbling out of his mouth haphazardly.
“—in space,” Charlie finished. “Don't you worry, Captain Tight Pants, this dress will be getting an outing next time we go to a con. You can be Mal then. I always thought you were more of a Wash though.”
Dean grinned down at the screen.
Cas looked flattered by the question rather than embarrassed for him, so Dean didn’t feel like he’d messed up too badly. But asking the question like that did kind of make him feel like the ditsy, awkward lead in a bad chick flick. Cas put down his cocktail and leant towards Dean, cupping the side of his face with one hand.
He had a brief flashback to saying the same thing to Cas when he didn’t remember who he was, when Cas was just some hot guy he wanted to fuck. It was different now. His admiration wasn’t just superficial. He appreciated all the dimensions of Cas. The wisdom and naivety, the solemnity and joy, the never-ending love, the fierce determination to help people, to do good in this world, the laughter that was all the more special for its rarity, the jokes that were rarer still, the patience, the kindness, the closeness he shared only with Dean, his wild passion that was reserved for him alone.  And he was hot, hot didn’t hurt either. But, really, he’d take Cas in any vessel. Or he’d take him without a vessel and just damn well figure out how to be married to Cas in his true form, if that was how he chose to manifest. He’d take wings and a being the size of the Chrysler building made of unfathomable energy as long as Cas was his.
And finally,
“What about you? I can’t place the costume,” she admitted, sounding a little sheepish because, to Charlie, not knowing something was like admitting defeat and she didn’t like to lose.
Dean smiled widely when they got to the bar, not even caring that he could hear strains of another damn Taylor Swift song coming from inside. This was where he got together with Cas. They could play as much terrible pop music as they liked and he’d still love this place. He stood by the Impala for a moment and just watched Cas as he walked up to the door of the bar. Dean had persuaded Cas out of the trench coat for once- well, he’d talked Cas out of the trench coat rather a lot lately, but he’d actually got him to wear something else this time. Cas was in a pair of dark jeans and a green t-shirt looking entirely too cute.
“No, it’s very inconvenient,” Cas replied flatly.
“Damn right it is!” Gabriel said and held out his hand for a fist bump.
CW- Mentions of child abuse/violence.
“Of course I know that,” Cas said fiercely, taking Dean’s face in his hands and forcing him to meet his eyes, to see the sincerity there. “But I feel the same way; you can’t ask me to harm you if I can avoid it.”
Dean shook his head as he watched Charlie and the other woman leave. He turned back to the balcony, but the man with the tattoos was gone. Dean was looking around wondering if he should try to track the guy down when he saw Jesse and Cesar waving to him from a booth at the edge of the dance floor. Dean really wanted to find Mr Tall, Dark and Smouldering, but he also hadn’t had a chance to spend much time with his friends lately. So, only a little reluctantly, he went to rejoin them and have another drink.
Dean jolted awake, head throbbing but mind clear. He looked around him, assessing the situation, ready to fight if need be. He was in a cabin, not the bunker or a motel. At first glance, it was a small, rather masculine space, all wood and functionality, but on closer inspection there were a few froufrou little touches here and there. It had those little frilly curtains for one thing, and a cosy knitted blanket on the back of the love seat- the green colour of the wool clashed rather badly with the orange-based plaid of the couch. On the rickety little Formica table in the kitchenette, there was a small vase with a big daisy in it. It all seemed rather homey in a slightly haphazard kind of way.
The speakers had been silent since the last terrible strains of ‘Barbie Girl’ faded out. Damn, Dean really shouldn’t have played that on Spotify. He just knew it was gonna fuck with the algorithm and annoying nineties pop was going to keep coming up in his recommendations for the next month.
There’d been a time when it had happened regularly. Whenever he’d glimpsed a dark blond head on the street, his stomach had dipped, that nauseating mix of joy and pain warring inside his belly. The joy was irrational, Cas knew, because that blond head was never him, could never be him again. When his reasoning caught up to that fact, the joy vanished, leaving the pain sharper than ever.
"You're not just a memory, are you?" It's more of a statement than a question, but Cas answers anyway.
He told Cas as much.
But the way he says it now, wistfully, full of admiration and something else, has Castiel believing it's not just a friendly expression. Or maybe he's just hoping for something that isn't really there.
Dean blushes, kissing him again, this time a little harder.
"Yeah," Dean smiles fondly, "you did good finding that case, kiddo. I'm sure you'll do great."
Clearly he says the right thing, because the alpha above him growls and a red ring outlines his stormy blue eyes.
Dean stares at Jack in shock. "Uh. That's- that's great? Yeah. Uhm? Are you sure? You don't have to yet, it may take some time for you to trust me again-"
Dean stays still for a long time, stuck on the floor in half upright position. His heart is threatening to break his ribcage, pounding relentlessly in his chest. Gasping, he takes a deep breath, not realizing he had been holding it, and it breaks a dam. He lets out a single, despaired, body wracking sob that echoes in the empty room.
A crazy grin stretches across his lips - no, The Empty's - and it leans into his face.
"Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm sure you'd like to meet Jack."
"Listen, Cas," Dean grunts between thrusts, "if you're not alpha enough to fuck me with your dick, I will leave this goddamn house and find someone who c-"
Even if it feels hopeless when he hears Dean blame him for Castiel's death. Jack wishes, not for the first time, his father was here to help him.
"Too damn long," Dean mutters, not wanting to think about it.
Dean stiffens at the mention of the Nephilim, shame churning his stomach into knots. Castiel seems to notice, but he doesn't press Dean and Dean doesn't offer any explanation. For now.
"He manipulated him. He made him promises; said paradise on earth. And Cas bought it, and you know what that got him? It got him dead." Dean snarls the last part. Sam's face crumples, finally understanding what has truly been bothering Dean. Dean ignores the pity seeping into his expression, continuing his passionate rant. "Now you might be able to forget about that, but I can't!"
"What are you thinking about, little alpha?" Cas rasps, his voice even rougher after sex.
Sam clears his throat. "Uh, so Cas, where were you? Heaven?"
"Apparently it's where angels and demons go where they die."
Dean cracks a joke about the show they're watching with a big dopey smile, and Castiel's whole body shakes with laughter. Sometimes he just rolls his eyes at Dean's purposely lame humor, but he's not in the mood to tease. He lets go, enjoying the light-hearted atmosphere.
"No, I forgive you Dean. I believe you. Cas believes in you, so I believe in you. Besides, I just want to move on. I'm really excited about this upcoming case! I'm very happy I was able to help, and I can't wait to help even more."
Life wasn't always perfect, but they supported each other through the worst, and their kids had had a happy, healthy home, and grew up to be successful in their own rights. When Cas had retired, he and Dean spent the rest of their lives taking care of one another, and spending time with their family. Their old age couldn't stop each other from spoiling the other, and their love never lessened. Despite Dean's injury, and the changes that came with it, their life had been fulfilling, and their bond, profound.
"These make me very happy," Cas says, smiling at Dean. It makes his heart stutter, and warm affection blooms in his chest. Dean wishes he could tell Cas that his smiles make him very happy, and that he wants to spend the rest of his life trying to make Cas smile more.
"So, uh. I've been kind of a dick. I've been - I've been mean, and hurtful and I haven't exactly pulled out the welcome wagon." He clears his throat, making sure to keep direct eye contact with Jack despite wanting to look away in shame. "The truth is, despite my actions, I don't want to hurt you Jack. And I don't want to see you fail. I don't expect you to believe me right away, but I've realized I've been unfair towards you and placing blame for things you didn't do onto you, and I want to make up for that. I need to make up for that. You're...family, Jack."
"C-Cas, hng, need you here" Dean whimpers to himself, on the brink of more tears. He's so lost he doesn't notice the tightening of his balls and the swelling happening until his knot pushes between the sour cream glazed and the chocolate frosted donut.  Dean moans pathetically and collapses onto his back as the euphoria of orgasm moves through him and his cock overflows with cum.
Castiel can hear Dean's sincerity as he pleads for Cas's forgiveness, and the pride in his voice when he brings up Jack this time. He nods, pulling his hands away from Dean's grip only to entwine their fingers together. "I'm not the one you need to apologize to."
After that, it was official.
Dean's lips had trembled for a moment as he pictured his children in the same position he had been in growing up, and he had released a shuddering breath. All the things Dean had continued to struggle with, despite the therapy, were things he desperately wanted to protect his kids from. They were raising them to be strong and resilient, to rely on more than just their parents' money and be independent, but still know that it's okay to ask for help. They were teaching them the value of hard work, but also how to take care of themselves emotionally, and physically. It didn't stop Dean from worrying.
Cas knows when he's settled enough to continue, because Cas always knows, and sneaks a hand behind Dean's head to grab the lube stashed underneath the pillow that they prep for ruts. He leans down for another kiss on the lips, this one chaste, before he sits up and begins slowly rutting his leaking cock along Dean's. They can both feel the tug of skin and yeast as the donuts rub against them, the sour cream glazed and the strawberry and chocolate finally breaking apart from all the abuse the two alphas put them through. The vanilla, still mostly intact, stays in place.
Jack stops in front of the entrance, and pauses. "Originally, I was going to have Mary greet you. Especially to make up for my...my betrayal." He holds up his hand to Dean, who had attempted to reassure Jack he was forgiven. "I know Dean, just let me apologize again. Please. I know we had a rocky relationship, after I killed Mary. I deserved it. You deserved to be angry, and you deserved time to process it. What I did was unforgivable, and I know you tried hard to make me feel like family despite your grudge. It's okay. You've forgiven me now, I know, and I know you love me. I love you too, Dean. I still think of you as my dad, along with Sam, and - well anyway, I've prepared something else for you."
Castiel is fed up. It's been nearly a month of his friend avoiding him and making up excuses as to why they can't hang out. Castiel corners him in the kitchen that morning and demands answers for his friend's distancing.
Cas is so close, they’re sharing the same air. Memories of the earlier morning, only a few hours before, surface from when Dean woke with his arms wrapped tightly around Cas. Cas had still been asleep, thankfully. Cas’ face was shoved into his neck, his breath leaving feathery kisses. Dean managed to extract himself without waking Cas, but despite forcing some distance between them, Cas kept a clutch on Dean’s shirt.
So she had Kaia taped scrap paper over all the sex scenes. Then she stole sticky notes and highlighters from Jody and booked it to Kansas.
She turns to the little Nephil that koala’d on his side. “Who’s this little guy?” she asks, her eyes sparkling with curiosity and a little bit of betrayal.
Okay, but again,
Castiel adds, “But very much a parent to Jack.
Emma tightens her grip on Jack’s shoulder. These situations are always awkward. She can’t, in good conscience, let the child go without the proper proof. Even if it is inconvenient and the guardian has to go home to get the number, or has to get their ID checked at the office.

Sam: i cannot believe he is the gay sibling.
Cas: He Also Said It Was Cost Efficient, I Can Not Help But Agree. :)
Once they get everything settled, Jack flings himself into Claire’s arms. When she picks him up, he loudly whispers, “Did you really steal Baby?”
He watches Cas’s contact picture as it disappears and is replaced with a “call ended.” It’s a photo of him and Jack asleep on the couch, Jack sprawled out on top of Cas. They have the same expression when they sleep, their eyebrows slightly furrowed.  Shoving his phone back in his pocket, he momentarily abandons his task to ask his boss something very important concerning a toddler.
Dean opens his mouth to say something, anything.
Jack was working on the car while Dean gave instruction. She overheard Jack ask for his own cover-alls to wear, and she watched as Jack studied Dean carefully. Sometimes, mimicking his moves exactly.
Dean coughs awkwardly. “No, we’re not.” But now Dean’s thinking about how much he wants it.
Long story short, she asked all the right questions to all the wrong people… And when an 18 year-old boy, Josh, looked at her funny and asked if she was one of those Supernatural fangirls, she heard the Dial-Up noise somewhere in her head as her brain tried to catch up. “What?”
It’s always been Bobby. Dean’s been so obsessed about breaking the cycle, not being like John, he didn’t even realize he did have an actual father growing up. He isn’t continuing John’s cycle, but Bobby’s.
He shakes his head.
If Claire told just anybody what she was currently up to, they would probably call her insane. Or say she was lying. Which… Fair. Honestly she had lost track of the amount of times she’d had that thought, even if it had been less and less, lately. Her whole entire life was pretty fucking weird, so she was beginning to lose touch with what was and wasn’t normal.
“Sam informed me, that if you try to get me to buy 5-in-1 anything, that I must insist you do not ‘push your heteronormative toxic masculinity agenda onto me.’” The entire sentence was absolute horse-shit but Cas using air quotes for literally every word made it that much more ridiculous.
What?
“You were waiting up to make sure I went back to bed?” Dean asks.
“Why?”
“Um.”
“This ain’t natural man,” Dean groans out. “If my body was made to do this shit it would.”
Good lord, these are the people who raised Jack?
Dean looks away again.
He heard Dean’s laughter before he saw him. “Ah man! Who brought in the pimpmobile?”  Liam was currently wedged beneath said horrendous vehicle.
Cas: He Says, “Shut Up And Stop Typing Everything I Say To Sammy.”
Dean tries not to think about how he feels about everything for the rest of the day.
“Fine, I’m sorry or whatever but you’re still not off the hook about the kid thing,” she huffs.
to be wearing that day.
Cas looked to Claire, eyes asking for some help. She gestured for him to go on, because why the hell not. They already started this, in the middle of dinner. And it was painful to watch, but for fuck’s sake, she was going to get them together by the end of dinner.
John Winchester was all those things. But he was also good. He protected them, taught them how to protect themselves.
Cas starts out with some simple poses—child’s pose and downward dog, these Dean recognizes at least—Jack follows along easily. Dean tries to bite back his painful groans as he attempts for his body to do things it was not made to do. Then Cas lays on his stomach and grabs his back legs and Dean just about cries. He’s getting shown up by a toddler. Which, fine, Jack has more cartilage than him right now or something. That’s a thing right?
in high school apparently.
Sam leans forward, his hair is pulled back in a stupid little pony-tail. “I wish you could see what I see. What Cas sees,” Sam says. “You’re not Dad. Dad was neglectful, and shitty, and obsessed. And he shouldn’t have dragged us through what he did.”
“Of course, Cas.” Dean kissed the top of his head.
And by the looks on everyone elses’ face, they were disappointed too.
This time when Dean smiled, it was shy. Very rare to see him anything less than his usual confident, flirty self. “Thanks. Cas says so, but…” He rubbed the back of his neck. “Cas has been great--they both are. Kid’s a miniature-Cas, though, kinda funny. God, the two of them keep me on my toes.” He punctuated his statement by bouncing playful on his tippy-toes.
“Yeah? Well tell Sam he doesn't know a damn thing about anything.” Dean threw the bottle of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash mix into the slow filling cart. “Besides it’s ‘3-in-1’ not ‘5-in-1’ and it’s cost efficient.”
Hannah was pretty sure his name was Sammy. But she wasn’t positive. She said as much.
She flipped open the book to a marked page and began reading out loud. “
* * *
With Lisa, he was playing a part. Devoted boyfriend, and maybe-maybe not-father. With Lisa, he felt like he was waiting for something to happen. For something to pull him back into hunting. And he could never decide if that was what he wanted or not.
. “Although he did not compare us to them.”
“I did not shriek.”
So of course the scene brought Cas to his mind, but it doesn’t mean anything. He was just wondering what it would feel like: if Cas’ lips were soft. If his beard would scratch his face. How it would feel with his hands cradling Dean’s fa—
“I don’t know.” He imagines Jack shrugging his shoulders up to his ears. Dean laughs again. “What are you doing?”
Dean slaps the dough a little harshly. A quiet
Her smile falters only slightly, her hand stays hanging in the air. “I, yes, I am.”
“I apologize,” she says. And because she can’t help her curiosity, she asks, “Um, when I checked your daughter’s ID, I noticed her last name was also different… Novak?” Because why not? She is curious, and the meeting is already a disaster.
“Nah he’s single.” Liam took a confident swig of his beer. He said it as if he’s proud. Like Dean was one of him. He probably honestly believed that, as if he didn’t have a wife at home. As if Liam was half the man Dean was.
Cas doesn’t answer, interrupted by a customer asking about the lavender honey jars.
like him just as much as he wants to be like Cas.
She glanced around the table. Some of the novels were open, pink and yellow highlighter covering the phrases and actions. Pen and pencil filled the columns with words like, “Look!” and “This is very GAY!” Other books had sticky tabs hanging out, color-coordinated. Sam would be proud.
Sam: Dean’s a little bitch
This was based off a true story of mine. Will this become a series of traumatic mint-related events I pull from my own memories? Maybe.
Hannah approached them. They both held take-out in their hands. “Hi, can I help you?” She plastered on a fake customer-service smile.
Dean stays silent. They both do. His hands shake as he attempts to put the gun back together again. Sam takes the barrel and spring from him, and slides the pieces where they belong.
Dean stands.

Will continues, “Maybe you could settle something between us then.” He gestures between himself and Matt. “Which one of us is hotter?”
Dean tensed as when the cold, wet paper touched his skin. Jack’s finger pressed gently onto his face as he put the face mask into place. It smelled like oatmeal and lavender, and he wasn’t sure if he liked it or not.
“Ah, I see.” He tears the last piece of tissue away and inspects the brightly colored jar. “Strawberry, my favorite.” Dean isn’t sure if that is totally true. He kneels down to Jack’s eye level. “Thank you.” He kisses Jack on the cheek and Jack giggles when the scruff on Cas’ face tickles him.
Cas hesitated, still unsure. So Dean sighed, switched the cheap one pack of ten, to two of the much more expensive packs of five. Seeing Cas’ satisfied smile was worth it.
He creeps through the living room, carefully avoiding any odd discarded toys lying around.
Cas smiled and nodded.
“Right.” Not the reaction she expected, at least the other parents pretended to be polite.
He doesn’t go to Cas.
The man spoke, deep and gravelly. “We’re looking for--”
“When?”
It was Jack’s turn to pick. “Are you joining us?”
+ + +
The pair on the couch laugh, too. Eileen’s fondly watching Sam who’s concentrating on making the princess as accurate as possible.
“Well, thank you for coming.” She offers her hand again, this time Castiel takes it.
“Cas is definitely the name of his wife. He even said Jack was just like her.” Maggie stared bullets at Liam and Liam stared back, leaning in further. Every Thursday night they did this. Nobody really liked Liam, but Maggie always made it especially clear she would leave him in a burning building.
He wants it all, every bit of Cas. Every special moment, he wants Cas there, holding his hand. He wants to exchange sweet-nothings in the dark, in his bed. He wants to see Cas wake up, every morning in his stolen clothes, bed head, and incomprehensible grunts until Dean brings him coffee.
“I’m sorry.” There’s that phrase again.
He brings both their drinks to the kitchen island and sets them down, Cas follows.
The wind blows, and Dean wraps his jacket around Jack.
Dean chuckles, his heartbeat slows from its frantic rhythm. “Heya Jack.”
“Jack’s got this one show, I hate it, it's called
“Yeah with the cars.”
Cas, startled, gasped and inhaled the fucking toothpaste. Causing the poor guy to gag and start heaving over the toilet bowl. Dean filled the glass by the sink with water and rubbed soothing circles on his back until he was able to calm down. Unfortunately, now whenever Cas tried to brush his teeth or eat anything minty, he gagged and a few times vomited. It hasn’t been a good week for him. Dean promised to take him to the store and pick out a non-minty toothpaste and his own damn toothbrush.
.” James laughed, and waited for his signal. When Dean held a thumbs up, he started the vehicle. It purred to life beautifully and Dean smiled.
Dean’s foot makes dangerous contact with a small yellow and red car, and he loses his balance. The sharp clatter of the toy echoes throughout the dark and empty room. It rolls its way over to the small pile of plastic kitchenware and dinosaurs. Dean catches himself on the arm of the sofa, cursing under his breath and using his foot to sweep the post-mini-accident vehicle away from the pathway to the kitchen. Cas’ door was open when he passed by, but his light was off and the bundle under the pile of blankets unmoving. Jack’s, of course, is shut, but right next to Cas’ so Cas would hear him if he wakes.
“Better.” He smiled, but not at her. At a memory.
have an opinion on men. He does think that Dr. Sexy is, well, sexier than say Ryan Gosling. Not that Ryan Gosling is not sexy, but he just likes Dr. Sexy more. And he always prefered Han Solo to Luke. Both are good, but he just thinks Han Solo is objectively more attractive. And he can do the same about women… Can’t everyone?
Sunday morning, Dean joins Cas and Jack in the living room for their daily yoga routine that he normally misses due to work, or by finding something productive to do like fixing the bathroom sink that is not really broken.
“You’re welcome, sweetie. Come visit again!” Of course she says that, she suckered him into buying her product through his child.
The door to the break room swings open and a few of his coworkers stampede in for their lunch break. Their conversation carries itself into the room, loud and uninviting.
She rounds the car, and walks up to where Emma and Jack are standing. Emma notices a pin on her jacket, a small flag like the one on Jack’s in the same position. She hands over the plastic card. A green car-rider card, with Jack’s number. “This is it, right?” Then she waves her ID, saying, “Also, my ID
Dean nearly choked on his food, but saved-face by taking a big and painful gulp. Claire grimaced and gave Cas a thumbs up.
“Right.” Cas leaves the door open and gets into bed leaving one side unoccupied. “Just don’t wake me up later.”
“I’m fine, Cas,” Dean answers a little more harshly than called for.
? Dean made it his phone background anyway.
“Thanks.”
“No, Sammy’s my brother,” Dean says between laughs.
Alright, jumping right in then.
He clears his throat. “We gotta fix this though.” He gets him to stay still for just a minute while he makes the necessary adjustments. He begins rolling up Jack’s sleeves until they reach his elbow, the flannel stays unbuttoned to show off his band tee.
Dean doesn’t know if he was there for him or for Sam.
Claire smacked her palm to her forehead.
“Well he’s a good kid, you know,” Dean says. He looks over to the kitchen. On the chair, Jack’s sitting on his knees eating the eggs and sausage, the small purple fork held in his little fist as he semi-aggressively stabs his meal.
“No need to wait for me or anything, it's not like I slaved over dinner or anything.”
“Wait,” Cas went after him. “I apologize Dean it won't happen again.” The little shit was still smiling.
Because Dean doesn’t want to gossip about his problems right now anyway. He doesn’t need a pity party. He doesn’t need a fucking shrink.
He checks on Jack. Sleeping. Safe.
“Yeah last week, I came home early and they were watching it in the living room. They claim they fastforward over the ‘sex parts’ but it just don’t sit right with me.” Dean gestures for James to get behind the wheel. “They even had a stripper scene, Jamie.
“Yeah, uh, Jack’s school had some production thingy today.” Dean shifted the black and grey bag hanging off his shoulder, she guessed it held his work clothes. “It was cute. Kid nailed all his lines.” He had a smile that was different than all the ones she received. This one was clearly proud.
Later that night, Dean wakes up shaking. He pulls himself onto unsteady legs.
She gestured to his notes, where Cas had been scribbling frantically. He nodded and scrawled out.
She reaches for her toppled cup and begins putting the pens back inside.
“Fine, ask Dean,” Will turns to him and Kathryn. “Dean, who’s hotter, Scarlet Johansson or Blake Lively?”
“Wait. What?” On the screen it showed images of various book covers, all very poorly edited. “What do you mean ‘Dean’?” Not
She supposes it makes sense. It was his name before he married Dean. Perhaps he had Claire with an ex.
Dean’s still not looking at him, but he can feel Sam’s bitch-face aimed his way. Sam sighs. “My mistake then,” he deadpans, disbelieving.
Liam who constantly called Dean a “ladies’ man.” Who very clearly looked up to Dean and saw himself in Dean, found out Dean is gay, or bisexual. He found out Dean is married to a
“Afraid of what?” Dean asks, not looking at him directly.
“No,” Castiel says. Something tells her he’s wrong. “I am just confused on the purpose of this meeting. I am more than aware of how Jack is doing in class, he tells me.” Normally she’d scoff at that, because how would you know the kid was being honest? But also this is Jack, so she’d give him a pass on that. “I am only here because Sam insisted it’s what normal people do, and it’s better for Jack’s education somehow.”
Dean laughs quietly at Cas’ appearance. His hair thoroughly covered in white underneath Dean’s hands. “Looking good there, Jack Frost,” he whispers into the small space between them.
“Um. Why? I just mean that—”
As if on cue, Eileen made her appearance. Dressed in a bathrobe and fuzzy slippers, she clearly had no immediate plans to “go out.” Eileen took her spot in the chair, and ripped open the fourth mask, this one was supposed to be a llama. “Hi, Sam!” She said, once her mask was in place. She grabbed the remote and turned on the movie.
, before she left.
bounces his way toward the car. “Claire!”
decided to ditch me tonight.”
“I mean, heck.”
Later when Dean was showing Jack the car he’d been working on that day, Hannah reintroduced herself to Cas, who was sitting on a nearby bench, pretending to read. Instead he was watching his husband and son fondly.
in his pick up list.”
Dean feels heavy. His body is full of lead, and every emotion, every thought threatens to pull him under. To drown him.
Cas dresses Jack in one of the shirts Dean bought for him. Actually Dean’s favorite shirt he bought for him. A mini Led Zeppelin shirt that matches one of Dean’s, the very one Dean
Dean watched as Jack’s soul was torn apart and put back together again. It’s Dean’s fault, he put him there. He let Jack grow up to believe his only purpose was to be a good soldier. He let Jack think he deserved this. He let Jack grow up to be just like Dean.
She inspected the images again. The two men on the front looked kind of like Sam and Dean, if you squinted. If you described them to an amateur sketch artist this would be what you’d get. All you needed was two white men in flannel and there you go.
“What, Cas?” he snaps.
“Jack is a very good kid.”
Dean laughs outright. Castiel stares more. Okay, what is with the staring?
Dean grabs the bag and Jack’s hand. “Alright let’s go find your dad.” He then nods at the woman. “Say thank you, Jack.”
She tried not to stare too deeply in his green eyes, lest she get lost there. That shirt really brought out his eyes.
“It looks good,” Dean says. He nervously runs his hand in soothing circles around Jack’s back. “The gray hair suits you. Very salt and pepper-y.”
Dean snorts from where he’s seated shuffling through Jack’s graded papers.
“Cas, that’s not your fault and you know it,” he says, gently.
“Can I be Luke?” Jack asked excitedly. He looked two seconds away from ditching the table to go grab his lightsaber.
It doesn’t help Cas is wearing one of Dean’s shirts. One that Cas definitely wore to bed, and obviously hasn't bothered to change out of.
“I’ll figure it out.” Hannah took another sip. Their conversation took its natural turn to other things. But her mind found itself wandering back to Dean. She didn’t mean to. It’s not that his personal life was particularly interesting to her. But she considered them friends, and yet she didn’t seem to know too much about him. She thought his son’s name was Sammy, and his wife's name was Cas. But now she wasn’t sure. How could she have a whole conversation about what poetry she likes, and not know anything about them? She still didn’t know where Dean lived before moving to Lebanon. He said Lawerence, and “on the road” and was very vague about most things. She didn’t even know how he met his wife. How old his kid was. Was “Cas” short for something? Cassandra? Even when she wanted to drop something off to him, he would only meet her at a nearby gas station, refusing to give her his address. Maybe they weren’t that close.
"Me too." Dean smiles as he rests his head atop of Cas'.
"Burgers and beer, Sammy. Let's celebrate."
No. Not again. He wasn't going to lose Cas, or leave him behind again, not like had had the last time they had been in Purgatory.
"Awesome. Follow me."
mate. Dean's own alpha preens happily, knowing he invokes such passion in his Chosen, and enjoys the pain that blossoms in his neck as Cas' sharp canines sink into his flesh and draw blood. He's slamming into Dean now, hitting his prostate over and over in irregular patterns, and yeah, Dean definitely feels the full extent of his rut as he moves to meet each thrust, a difficult feat as the bed shakes violently. Castiel covers Dean with his body,
They let go together, climaxing in tandem. They're both silent as they catch their breath, and then Dean gets up to grab a towel and wipes himself down before gently cleaning Cas too.
Castiel growls low in the base of his throat, a frustrated sound that tells Dean he's getting close. As if Dean needs anymore help to reach his climax at the same time as Cas, the dominant alpha shoves a hand between them to grip Dean's heavy, aching cock, once again using the donut as a sleeve to stroke him with quick jerks. Dean's hole clenches around Cas with one last deep thrust as Cas impales his knot inside him just before it locks them in place. The alpha above him groans loudly in his ear as he unloads his spend in Dean, some of it leaking out and running down Dean's crack and onto the bed.
"Really? Do you think Dean can like me?"
Reassured that Cas isn't judging him, he relaxes and tells the alpha what he wants to hear. What they both want.
"Zombies!" Jack shouts, interrupting Dean this time. Looking at Cas, he leans in and whispers like he's sharing an important secret. "I know what zombies are now."
"And what about Cas?" Dean barrels on.
"I hope you are well rested, despite last night's rigorous activities," Cas says seriously, right as Dean is taking a sip of his coffee. He nearly does a spit take, trying not to choke as he chuckles.
Dean is enjoying himself. Netflix is playing in the background and he's buzzed enough to allow himself to relax into Cas' lap as they basically cuddle on the couch. It's been a while since he's let himself give in to the comfort of Cas' body, fearing he might combust, but he's content to push all that aside for right now and just live in the moment. Besides, Cas seems wound up about work, and Dean is pretty sure isolation is starting to get to him. He needs Dean right now, just as much Dean needs him, and he's already spent too much time hurting Cas for the sake of his own emotions.
"You started without me," Castiel states, "were you that desperate?" He asks, as the bed dips under his weight. He crawls towards Dean, grabs his legs and pulls them up, then spreads them wide. "And what's this? I was really looking forward to having a treat, Dean. What am I going to eat now?" Castiel ghosts a finger over Dean's sensitive head, and scoops up a bit of semen that he rubs between his fingers, before twisting the vanilla frosted donut in place.
"Knock, knock." Dean greets, and Jack looks up from one of Sam's borrowed laptops.
(Cleaning:)
Castiel wants to live in this moment forever. One kiss turns into two, then three, and then too many to count. They start slow and languid, the passion building up as they continue to make out and things become a bit more heated as Dean backs Cas into the couch. Cas falls back onto the cushions behind him, and Dean is quick to climb on top of his lap, straddling his thighs as they pick up where they left off.
Castiel supposes he's lucky. He works from home regularly, so he's able to continue working, using the daytime to transcribe recordings. He thought things would be different with Dean home, that they'd see each other more, but the man continues to elude him even in the evenings when he puts his work away for the night. It's frustrating, but more than that it concerns Castiel. He's worried Dean has discovered Castiel's feelings for him and is repulsed by the idea of them being more than friends. He wishes he could stop feeling this way for both their sakes.
A hush has fallen over the room, the TV in the background forgotten as he and Cas stare into each other's eyes. Dean's head is spinning as he processes what he just said. Fuck. That had not sounded like a friendly declaration, that had been a confession through and through. He could brush it off, act like he meant it as a friend anyway and Cas would probably believe him. His heart is thundering against his chest as the seconds tick by, waiting for Cas to do something; Laugh it off as a joke, push him away in disgust, demand an explanation - something other than stare at him intensely. He doesn't though. He just waits.
He takes another bite of the donut, avoiding the center as to not break the donut in half. Maybe if he paces himself, he won't consume all of them at once, but he feels any semblance of control slipping; the desire to stuff his face and stroke himself until he cums is overwhelming him as the seconds pass. Dean imagines the warmth of the cake in his mouth is wrapped around his dick, imagines Cas is finally home, licking the pre-cum leaking down his shaft up with his soft, wet tongue.
"God Cas, I love you."
Cas laughs softly, running his hands through his mate's sweaty blond hair and leaning in to kiss him on the nose.
love. Dean tries to do better everyday.
Dean's old now. Sam happily married his wife years ago, had one point five kids, all while running the comprehensive organization that had revealed itself to the whole of humanity once it'd become more successful and completely established. The world was still adjusting, but with some miracles (thanks, Jack), it was beginning to become more accepting. Dean could not have been more proud of his brother for all of his achievements, though Sam was right he couldn't have done it alone. Not without the cooperation and resourcefulness of everyone else involved. Still, Sam had pulled it altogether to create a well liked machine, and the entire planet was benefiting from it. Sue him for being biased.
"Fuck, yes," Dean breathes, and then their lips are pressed together. The lips Dean had been fantasizing about just minutes before are on his, and they're softer than he had imagined.
As the News on TV carries on, Dean faces the fact he can't run anymore. He can't hide from Cas. Not when the state had just declared all non-essential workers laid off, with a Stay-At-Home order in place.
"Castiel," Jack whispers out loud. It's both a promise and a plea, and the Nephilim is oblivious to the tendrils of power that call out and wake Castiel from death.
"Can I kiss you?" He asks in lieu of a reply.
Dean is emotionally exhausted, overwhelmed and scared, and he lets it out this time. If Cas is out there, if Cas is still alive, he needs to know that Dean isn't leaving him alone. So he spills his heart, praying to Cas, explaining his actions, and asking Cas for forgiveness.
Jack steps aside, clasping his hands in front of him with a proud smile on his face.
"No foreplay, I just want to feel you inside me," Cas groans, rolling his hips into Dean's hand. Dean laughs lightly and kisses Cas on the nose.
"Yeah, uh. Mind if I come in?"
"So you know I was never really gone." Dean rolls his eyes, and Jack tilts his head. Melancholy flickers in Dean's soul, and Jack must notice because he stands up straight. "Are you ready to see Heaven?" He asks, as if the hunter has a choice. Although, he wouldn't mind going to Hell, now that Rowena is in charge.
"I'm here now. How long was I gone?"
The years pass, and things change. Dean spends another year or so hunting monsters, the family business as usual, Sam and him side by side running an elite network of established hunters across the USA. Sam thrives in a leadership position and Dean falls in step behind him, happy to let his brother run the operations, letting him decide where he is needed on missions. Sam also revives the Men of Letters, except he renames it to Legacies of Eileen, and of course, women are officially accepted into the organization, lots of which come reccomended from Wayward Sisters, the operation started by Jody and Donna; Patience, Claire and Kaia will one day inherit the next generation  - Alex leads a mostly normal life, but still visits and keeps in constant contact with her family, who support her decision of leaving hunting behind.
So I know this is fast paced, but it's my first time writing a sex scene <3 It's not the best but I hope you get enjoyment out of it nonetheless <33
Jack's door is ajar when Dean approaches, so he pushes it open slightly to poke his head in and raps the wall with his fist.
Dean blinks, unable to believe what he's seeing. He stares at the lone figure standing next to the payphone, a spark of hope igniting within him.
Dean changed Cas, but Cas changed Dean. He saw Dean, the real Dean, under all the hurt and pain, under all the anger that constantly simmered beneath the surface of his skin, ready to burst and hurt the nearest person that tried to get close to him. Castiel descended through Hell and back, through Purgatory, through Heaven, through Death, and he did it all for Dean. He gripped Dean tight, and pulled him through his soul through all the shit Dean kept himself buried under, and reminded Dean that Dean is more than what has happened to him. That he is full of love, and deserves love. That he
Dean had been outraged by the proposal when his husband had suggested it. Anger had wrapped around him like an old friend, and shame had burned in his face and stomach. He had torn his hand away from his husband's grip, jumped up from his chair and paced the kitchen wondering where Castiel had scrounged up the audacity to imply that he was too crippled to work. Sure, he had been experiencing agonizing, localized pain that made his knees buckle, but he had argued he could still hold down a job.
Yeah. Next time.
"What was it like?" Sam asks, curious about this mysterious place the angel had resided.
Everything is going fine, until Dean cracks a lame joke about the show they're watching. Dean has had a couple of beers, he's tipsy, but he's sober enough to be in control of his actions. Yet the moment Cas' laughter fills the room, Dean's stomach swoops and his brain chooses that same moment to shut down and stop filtering his words. His heart is done being held back.
"Dean, I would ask you not to use such ableist language in our household. You know that kind of talk upsets me." His husband had begun, in his low, gravelly voice, referring to Dean's accusation of assuming he was 'crippled'. In another circumstance, that voice would have stirred a different kind of passion in Dean, one that would make him sink to his knees and coax a different kind of vocabulary from his lover. It was a voice that sounded like whiskey on the rocks; cool, refreshing, and rich, and enticed Dean into wishing he could swallow every sound Castiel would ever make.
"I missed you." Dean chokes, taking Cas's face in his hands and whispering against his lover's lips.
Castiel's voice rumbles, cutting through Dean's heavy breathing. The bedroom door clicks shut behind the alpha looming at the end of the bed.
Dean is a coward. He's been avoiding Cas for weeks with excuses not to hang out, making himself scarce from their shared apartment - all because he has to be such a Winchester and repress his emotions. Emotions that could threaten their friendship if Dean allows them to consume him. Cas can't know that Dean wants to be more than just friends.
Cas had known this, and would always know it. It's why he had suggested being a stay at home parent in the first place. Dean would have more time with the kids, and could avoid exerting himself, while Cas would work as he always had. His husband had not been trying to make him feel worthless, or damaged; instead he had been offering Dean a solution, with an outlet for his need to be useful for his family, and not damage his injury further.
After it's decided that they'll follow Jack's new lead in a few days, he pulls Jack aside to check in on him, letting Jack tell him what he's missed. They have a deep discussion, with Jack explaining everything in great detail, filling him in on the weeks he had been dead, and the timeline of Jack's progression. Jack has lots of questions and Cas does his best to answer them. It frustrates him that he had left Jack alone, but he tells himself he'll make up for it.
"You. And pie."
"No, I was in the empty." Dean looks at him.
"I am! Watch this." Jack rushes back to the table, angling his body so the older angel can see what he's doing. His hand hovers over a pencil he'd been using, concentrating until it levitates in the air. "I can move the pencil!" Feeling incredibly proud of himself, he looks at Cas with a satisfied grin. "Oh! And I found a case. A hunter's case!"
Life wasn't always perfect. Dean and Cas tried to always communicate instead of letting it build up, but sometimes they argued; they both got tired, they both burned out time to time, and sometimes one of them snapped at the other. But they were never cruel to each other - Castiel never held Dean's disability against him, even when he was frustrated, and Dean never accused Cas of being too tired for his kids. They made it work.
"I'm glad you told me the truth," Cas beams, snuggling against Dean as he climbs back into bed.
"Oh one more thing. Everything you see in there is real, Dean. And not just because you want it to be." He tries to  understand what Jack means, how he can see anything like this, but everything turns white and even though he hadn't moved from his spot, he knows he's somewhere else now, with no door to turn back to.
"Hey," Dean whispers, squeezing Cas's hand. "Don't think so hard."
Castiel takes a cautious step forward. There's a look of disbelief on his face, as if he doesn't understand his own presence. "Yeah, I was. But then I annoyed an ancient cosmic being so much that he sent me back." It was a dry attempt at humor but without the context of Cas' experience it fell flat. The Winchester's looked at him in confusion.
"Whoa, Sam, he just got back. Can we save the interrogation for later?"
Dean wakes up slowly, eyes fluttering open as he becomes conscious. He stretches out his limbs, feeling happy and sated. A smile tugs on his lips as he rolls over to the middle of his bed, closes his eyes, and briefly considers falling back asleep. But he's suddenly alert and sitting up when he realizes it's just him in the bed and it fills him with a sense of 'wrong'. He swears he fell as leep with Cas last night, tucked into his side after some soft sex, and now he fears it had been nothing but a dream. Worse, what if Cas had regretted it and was trying to figure out a way to avoid Dean forever -
"You're not coming?" Dean asks, eyeing the door suspiciously.
- walks away. He wants to tell him he's sorry for the things he said, reassure Jack that he
"Dean, mom chose to take that shot at Lucifer. That is not on Jack." And yeah, he knows Sam has a point, but this isn't about their mom. Dean wants her back more than anything, but at least the last he saw her, she was alive. Their mom was raised a hunter, she can hang in there until they reach her.
"No, Dean. You've been acting strangely every time Jack is mentioned and now I understand why. There's no excuse for your behavior. I know you were hurt. I know you were scared, and upset, and in grief. But this needs to stop and it needs to stop now. I can only hope that if I hadn't returned, Sam would have eventually gotten through to you. Thankfully, we won't ever know because I am back, and things are going to change. You will make a legitimate effort to accept Jack, and you will not continue to treat him like a threat until he actually does something to warrant it, which if I have my way, he will not. He is my responsibility. We are partners Dean, but I will not force you to take on the role of his parent if you do not wish. That being said, he is
"You're mine Dean, only mine. No one else will ever fuck this ass, not in this lifetime. Nor the next. I will find you, and I will remind you who owns you, mind, body and soul and you will remember me. The man who loves you and cherishes you, who craves you, who fucks you with a doughnut on your dick."
"I love you too, Dean."
Cas chuckled against his neck. "Oh, Dean. I will admit I was upset, but I know this must be hard for you. We'll get past it." Cas had then pulled back to look Dean in the eyes. "I love you," he had whispered, pressing his lips against Dean's. Dean had smiled into the kiss, returning the sentiment with an, "I love you too, sweetheart."
"That sounds lovely, Dean."
Sam looks surprised by his declaration, but it's Dean that asks first.
Cas is tucked into the corner of the couch, one hand thrown over the back and his other on the armrest with a beer in his hand. Dean is lying beside him, sprawled across the length of the couch with his head in Cas' lap, sipping from his own bottle. It's not an unusual position for them being the close friends that they are and Castiel is grateful that they've resumed their usual physical contact. It feels normal, and after being shut away from the rest of the world during a pandemic he needs something normal to cling to.
“Can we go now? Some of us want to be home for dinner,” he grumped.
“‘I don’t understand that reference.’”
It hadn’t been easy growing up with an alcoholic father who’d neglected him and Sam. They hadn’t been a happy family even before the final fight that had resulted in Sam and Dean moving in with Bobby.
“Draw me like one of your French girls,” Dean said in a husky voice. He’d kicked off the comforter and he proceeded to drape himself sideways over the bed in a suggestive manner, head propped up on one hand, legs stretched out.
“Come get your eggs!” he yelled over his shoulder with forced brightness.
Cas finally wrenched his eyes away from Dean’s face to look down as his body stiffened and his orgasm hit him. He watched as his cock spurted thick ropes of come over Dean’s own dick and torso, marking him.
“I have no idea what that is.”
“What did you do?” he asked.
“Sorry,” Cas said after, while Dean was still floating in a post-orgasm haze.
“Take me, Cas. Take all of me.”
They had never convinced anyone new to join the Church. It didn’t seem like they had done anything meaningful at all. He wondered if his father had ever expected them to achieve anything on those assignments.
“No, thank you. I have to go.” Cas gestured uncertainly to the door.
Still utterly gentle, Cas added a second finger. He explored slowly until he found Dean’s prostate and then focused his attention there, steadily massaging it as he moved his fingers in and out. Cas moved away from Dean’s mouth to leisurely kiss his chest, as he fingered him. He peppered light kisses across the expanse of skin. Dean cried out when his lips found a nipple and he kissed and nipped and sucked on the sensitive nub. Cas’s lips and hands were both soft but insistent, the continued gentle touches steadily ramped up Dean’s need until he was completely desperate for Cas.
“I’m not sure that would really fit the aesthetic of my other tattoos,” Cas said laughing, and then, more thoughtfully, “Language is so strange. How did we get from a bundle of sticks to gay men?”
Charlie put her beer down and stepped away from the counter. Grinning, she held her arms out and did a little twirl so Dean could appreciate her costume from every angle. She was wearing a fluffy dress with a gathered cream bodice, short pink puff sleeves and a huge floor-length skirt with a cascade of chiffon ruffles that went from cream to peach to pink. It looked amazing and entirely impractical.
Dean chuckled and moved forward to rest his forehead against Cas's. “Always,” he whispered across Cas’s lips. Then shifted to give him a hand up. “Let's go home, there’s a lot more I want to do to you.”
“You’re awake,” growled the guy from the picture, who was apparently there too.
“Well, I guess everyone loves the cock ring fairy. Like the tooth fairy but even gayer.”
“And I you,” Dean replied with equal ardour.
would be worth watching. Charlie was all in, but Dean hated prequels on principle.
“What's an otter?” Cas said, sounding puzzled.
“Right, right,” Dean said distractedly and moved out from under Cas to grab condoms and lube from the bedside table.
"Wonderful... that was wonderful, darling-”
“I’d like that.”
Would you like to do something tonight?
“Still into Xena, huh?”
He sounded embarrassed, like he’d been caught doing something he shouldn’t, but Cas was flattered. Not everyone thought being a tattoo artist was a meaningful job, and it meant something to Cas that Dean was interested in his work.
Cas looked like the conversation was giving him a headache, even though Dean was pretty sure angels didn’t get those.
“Oh yeah?”
“Uh, no, just Ca--”
Jack answers for him. “I’m working,” Jack states, “like daddy.”
And that’s where Cas finds him, hands covered in flour as he rolls out homemade dough.
+ + +
The woman looks pleased, like he’s her most important critic. “I’m so glad you like it.”
Jack has his favorite toy car, a Hot Wheels purple Lamborghini. It spent the car ride “driving” across the window of the side door and did some very impressive flips landing on Jack’s thigh. But now its  are stalled, as Jack clutches it tightly in his little baby fist, his attention turning toward the loud garage.
Dean’s cleaning his guns on the island countertop, when Sam finds him a few hours later on his way out for a run. Sam sighs and instead goes for the coffee finding it empty. The machine whirls back to life as Sam starts a pot.
Jack piped up, “What’s
James shook his head. Trying to will the annoyingly catchy theme song that had plagued his psyche for the last 3 hours out of his head. Unsurprisingly, just like the last twenty times, it didn’t work. “My 16 year-old, yeah I can get her to watch some good movies with me, but my 12 year-old?” He tsked. “She watches them shitty disney shows that make you want to blow your brains out.”
“Okay,” Dean smiled.
“Oh, does Sa-- uh Ja--I mean. Does your kid like cars?” Smooth, Hannah.
He kept the mixtape in his pocket. Okay, so not unpacking this right now. “Mixtapes are a romantic thing you doofus. Classic flirting move! Especially in the 80s which is where Dean lives mentally.”
“We talk about our kids all the time. I know all about the kid. And I know about his wife.” This was James.
Back home? She must be older, or possibly a half sister who stays with another parent sometimes.
Dean feels his face flush when Cas instructs him into his next pose, breaking him from his thoughts. Cas has him reach down into a downward facing dog. Dean wants to make a joke, but between the compromising position and Cas’ hands on his back, skin to skin where his shirt had ridden up, his brain stops working. Cas has one hand on his lower back, so close to his waistband and the other is resting on his stomach, keeping Dean’s back straight. He starts to feel a little self-conscious of his soft tummy.
Cas says something under his breath that Dean doesn’t recognize.
“Dean is as dense as you. Staring won’t work.” She held up Cas’s notebook paper. “You have to flirt back. Speak his language.”
Dean isn’t wearing a flannel that day, he’s wearing his blue work button down with the company logo over his Zeppelin shirt, and he’s wearing work-boots. But Jack still looks like a miniature version of him. He’d be lying if he said his heart didn’t absolutely melt.
“‘Well’ what?” he snaps. His head is throbbing and it's 10am on a Tuesday and he’s having an ongoing sexuality crisis and all his coworkers think he’s married to a man.
“No, you’ve definitely got your information twisted,” James said. Liam glared at him. ”His name’s Jack, he’s in High School.”
“This just…. sucks.”
+ + +
He isn’t just playing a part. He chose this. He chooses this everyday. He gave up hunting to stay with Cas, when Cas told him he was going to raise Jack. He
She pulls Jack’s folder out and passes a stack of papers to the non-distracted dad. Castiel stares a moment longer before grabbing the papers and looking through them.
Dean gets to work on the vehicle. Sometimes fixing cars is the only thing that makes any sense to him. One would think getting lost in a task so familiar would help distract him from his thoughts, but it has the opposite effect on him. Being there, underneath a three thousand pound vehicle, sweat pouring down his back, it’s the only place he can actually think clearly.
Johnston’s eyes widen slightly before schooling his expression. He looks from Cas to Dean back to Cas, who is bent over awkwardly hugging the child who attached himself to his knees.
He stays seated on the creeper seat. He already feels the eyes of his coworkers on him, at least seated he has the car to block the majority of the view.
Liam voiced her thoughts. “No, I think he said his name is Sammy.”
Cas narrows his eyes, this time at his husband.
“Uh sure, Cas.” He finished his beer off, not making contact. “Who’s who in this, uh—” he gestured between them, “—scenario?”
Claire gives her a side glance. Clearly she doesn’t care for the teacher, even though she
“Cas,” Dean breathes.
Jack holds tightly onto his hand as he leads him around to all the different cars. Jack oo’s and aw’s at every car, all equally amazing to him. He asks a bunch of questions.
And to himself he muttered, “And it's time efficient too, asshole.”
“Hello!”
She glances between the two, both looking at her expectantly. “What does—?”
When Hannah finally recovered she held a hand out. Cas took it, his grip was strong. “Nice to finally meet you.”
Dean spun his beer nervously on the table.
“I did not understand the reference at the—”
just because you’re afraid.” Sam’s halfway out the door, when Dean stops him, because he has to know.
Before he can fully catch up, Cas is walking in the door, and Jack frees himself from Dean’s failing grip. He runs to Cas, shouting “Daddy!” Cas barely has time to prepare himself to the 30 pounds of pure momentum crashing into his legs.
“You let him work on Baby?” Maybe he was in high school.
, and Cas did not get that memo.
Cas raises a disbelieving eyebrow.
Jack is smiling the whole time she’s buckling him into his car seat. When Claire moves to go back into the driver’s seat, he waves wildly. “Bye Miss Brown!”
Maggie tapped her nails on the desk distractedly.
She was saved from further embarrassment when Dean gestured to his bag and said he had to get to work, but that he’ll see her around. She watched him make his way to the restrooms. When he was gone, she dropped her head to her desk. She gave herself one minute of self-pity before pulling out her phone to text Jessica about it.
“Really, I didn’t—”
“I’m not,” he says weakly. He finishes taking apart the gun, the pieces are spread across the towel he laid down. He doesn’t try to put it back together yet.
And there it is.
Cas looks away. “You had another nightmare.”
“Cas, have I proven it enough now? Dean’s been flirting with you for years. He likes you.”
Cas answers by pulling him in again. He mumbles out a “I promise” and “I meant everything” and “of course I’ll stay” in between kisses.
He looks back down at his food. What
Probably relieved, right? Less awkward, maybe.
“No, Cas is a

“Claire informed me, you like to use references—specifically couples—to flirt.” He pulled out a book from out of his coat pocket. “She showed me evidence from Chuck’s books.”
The kids are sitting around waiting for their respective parents to pull up. Some are in circles talking, others who tend to wait longer have books pulled out reading.
But he also left them for days with hardly enough money for food, Dean would never do that to Jack. John gave Dean a gun and said “take care of Sammy” cause if anything happened to him, it would be Dean’s fault. Dean was just a kid, who was there to protect
“Cause I’m not.” He finally says.
“Nah I wouldn’t let him keep that piece of shit around.” His hand paused at the headlight. Liam thought of the man who dropped it off. He had grumbled and acted as if taking his car to the shop was Liam’s fault. And begrudgingly referred to the Lincoln Continental as his wife’s car. Despite Dean’s earlier insults, he touched the car as if it held meaning. “Now he’s got a minivan. Says it’s safer for the kid. Whatever, he looks like a soccer mom.”
Johnston waves a dismissive hand. “Why don’t you introduce me to the missus.”
Dean’s heartbeat picks up. Cas is standing there, in front of Dean, saying these—these words and looking at him like
He clears his throat. “Sorry, Cas. I know losing your grace is a sore topic.”
“Yeah yeah. Just don’t let our customers hear you insulting their car.”
Dean never knows how to answer that question. Cas said before, “He’s your son as much as he is mine.” And Dean has answered the question in the past with, “He’s my kid.” Or if Cas was there, too, “He’s our kid.” But it always feels like admitting it makes him too close to his father. He just can’t do that to Jack, he can’t be Jack’s father. Dean’s so fucked up, he can’t push his issues onto the boy just because he so desperately wants to be a dad to Jack.
Cas did his little squint that she found kinda adorable. Like a confused puppy. “I would think you would be Han Solo. You’re smart, smug, devilishly handsome. And I have rescued your ass.”
“No,” he says too quickly.
But reading a published novel about her pseudo-dads—one of which was an angel possessing her bio-dad’s corpse—and their very real experiences… Yeah, she knew for sure that was pretty fucking weird.
Dean doesn’t say anything either, just slides underneath the covers. No snarky comment, no
Did she just say that outloud?
Dean touched his shoulder gently, Cas relaxed into his touch. “You had a bad experience with mint, it’s a part of being human.” Dean offered Cas a smile, he didn't return it, he didn't even look at him. “Everybody has something they can no longer eat because of a bad experience. Hell, I can’t eat tuna fish anymore after me and Sammy got food poisoning when I was ten.”
Cas: He Would Also Like To Inform You, That The Shampoo Is “3-IN-1” Not “5-IN-1”. I’m Quite Unsure Of The Difference, It Seems Like “5-IN-1” Is A Better Deal, Am I Incorrect? ^.^
“What’s wrong?”
than with Lisa.
Emma waves back, still a little put-off by the event that just occurred. She wouldn't say she was disappointed by meeting a member of Jack’s family, just confused. Then again, this is just his sister. Kids her age tend to be rebellious and reckless. Jack may turn out like that for a little bit, too. Though she can’t see Jack like that at all. But then again, he is just a five year old.
Hold up.
His boss walks over to greet them. Dean follows. His stomach is still doing somersaults and his brain is taking a temporary smoke break, but his feet lead him toward the two celestial beings.
“Dean?” Cas’ voice carries softly from his room. “Are you okay?”
He doesn’t come to a decision.
As if Dean has a side now.
“You’re home early,” Cas states.
Cas looks at him funny. “And this is a good thing?”
“Yes, I can see that,” he says, bluntly.
Cas sat next to him, his face mask was already on, and his eyes were closed. He looked relaxed. Almost serene if it wasn’t for the fact that the face mask was supposed to look like a panda, but instead had him looking like that dead chick they had to gank a few years ago.
“With me?”
“I, uh—well of course I did! It’s a western!”
Sam busted out laughing again, his side salad forgotten. Jack looked confused, trying to follow along. “Chuck’s books?” Jack asked.
Cas narrows his eyes. “What did you do?” he accuses.
Claire found the series at a secondhand book store. Well, multiple secondhand books stores. She pieced together the collection, accidentally buying one book twice. ”Because you’ve been with Dean for over a decade, and it’s getting ridiculous.”
“Hey, Dean.” She twirled her pen in her hands and fluttered her eyelashes. Damn, she might as well say,
Dean studied him for a moment. He opened his mouth, but aborted whatever his response was. “Right, uh, well. I’ve got Sammy doing that for me anyway. Kid can’t mind his business.”
Jack doesn’t just want to look like him. Jack wants to
“No.”
And it’s weird. It is weird, right? Grown men don't just sleep in each other's bed, that's—that’s
“I’d offer you a cup but I think your heart would explode,” Sam says.
Cas shakes his head. “I’ll be outside.” Cas grabs his beekeeper suit, which means he’s mad at Dean because it’s widely known Dean doesn’t go anywhere near the apiary. Dean’s rule when he first built it for Cas was that it was far enough away to keep Jack safe, and that Dean never had to go near it. So now Cas goes there when he doesn't want to talk to Dean anymore.
“Is this your kid then?” Will asks, looking at his lockscreen, which is of Jack from back when he turned one. ‘Ain’t right, having two dads. He’s gonna end up like you.”
. Dean turned, Castiel had his phone in his hands typing furiously. The little shit tricked him. “
Kathryn slides his phone over to him. “God, what are we? In high school?”
She gripped his shoulder. “You know they kissed right?
“There you have it, Cas.” He turns to the other man. “Now are we done?”
“Dean, I am trying to figure out if our son’s school is haunted and you are not helping.” Cas stares at Dean and he stares back.
Dean has always had a terrible habit of waking Jack when he sleeps. Ever since he was an infant. He couldn’t always help it, he would just forget. He focused on whatever book or show he was watching, he’d laugh or tell Cas something at full volume. Both hearts dropped at the sound of distant crying bleeding through from the next room over.
“I have no doubt,” Cas says with a soft smile. Right. Cause Cas can be normal about this apparently. Because getting mistaken as a couple is not the worst thing in the world, right?
Sam: time efficient my ass
Maggie’s horny ass honest-to-god choked. “What? Really?” Maggie almost slammed her drink down.
“Please. You do not have a concussion.” To be sure, she checks his eyes. “As usual I’m right.” She sits down and digs into her meal. “All’s forgiven.” She says around a mouth full of food. “Except you have to show me pictures of Jack.”
“Uh, Cas,” Dean’s voice shakes. Because he needs to hear it. “When you said, you know, did you mean--Cas, I can’t lose you. I need you to promise.” His voice, wavering, barely audible. “Promise you’ll stay.”
Castiel states, “Yes, he is.” His eyes turn from the posters on the wall to her, narrowing.
Jack shakes his hand and his head. “No.”
Cas shakes his head. “It’s different, as an angel. You don’t experience things the same way, it's all big picture.” Dean remembers when Cas was disappointed he couldn’t enjoy his favorite foods anymore, ‘molecules’ he had said. “I wanted to
“With my supervision. Of course. But he’s a natural.”
“I feel it’s my fault they are back.”
They came back sporadically. No rhyme or reason. He’d go weeks fine and then another one would come. Slowly, they became more and more frequent, like the dam was slowly breaking, spilling a few drops first before the whole thing flooded washing away every good thing he fought so hard to keep.
“Good. Dad said you would show me the cars,” The teen--Jack or Sammy--got straight to the point. He wasn’t looking at Dean, or any of the others. He was just staring at the red BMW to his left. His hand twitched like he was ready to get his hands on it, but knew better than to touch without permission. Hannah suspected if he wasn’t holding all that food, he would be all over it.
Are they messing with her?
“Dean,” Cas’ shoulders fall.
Claire stayed for dinner. Dean made the best burgers ever, so of course she was staying. She already took a bite out of hers before Dean even sat down.
.” She dramatically gagged then pointedly looked at Cas.
“I wouldn’t suck either of your dicks if you paid me,” Dean says. Which sounded a lot less gay in his head, but the stricken look on Will’s face is worth it.
Dean’s brain is working overtime right now. “Cas,”
Cas continues to stare.
“Dean!” Hannah raced over to where Dean had been packing up for the day. “It’s Thursday night. Are you joining us at Johnny’s?”
Maggie eyed her. “Cas loved the books, thank you again for the recommendation.”
“Shut up,” Sam says as he picks out a new crayon.
“What are you doing?”
“Thanks for lunch, Kat,” Dean says, as he grabs his stuff and leaves. He steps over Will as he goes, and he’ll probably have to deal with that tomorrow with his boss, but he doesn’t care. Not now.
Cas was picking at his fingernails while he eyed options. His face was pink and he looked everywhere but at Dean. “I just… never had this problem before”
“I’m telling you I asked the guy, he said he wasn’t married,” Liam huffed.
But now Jack is two and a half and is on a permanent sugar rush despite banning sugar from his diet. One bowl of icecream for dinner, an overly hyper Jack at eleven at night, a very tired Cas, and a lecture about nutrition from Sam all added up to Dean being cautious about the meals he serves the little tyke.
“I’m sorry,” she says again, suddenly remembering what the woman said. “But earlier, you were talking about stealing a baby…?”
Jack turns and wraps his arms around Dean’s neck, when he kneels down to his height, and gives Dean a sticky kiss on his cheek. “Goodbye.”
Dean snorts. “Shit, fine.” He leans forward and looks at her. “Has anybody died recently?”
Dean prays Cas missed the implication.
Cas accidentally eats mint-flavored gum and Dean makes BJ jokes.
The corner of Cas’ lips turns up, “Thank you.”
Dean starts chucking various dishes in the stainless steel sink.
Dean huffs and finishes cleaning the kitchen. He collapses on the couch and puts the TV on low and listens for Jack.
The dark haired one stares her down, ignoring her outstretched hand. “Are you Miss Brown?” he asks, gruffly. His voice is deep and deadpan.
“Uh. Yeah.”
Sam: No Cas it is not better, and tell him he has Charlie’s hacked credit card so theres no excuse for him to be dense
But Sam’s right. He shouldn’t have dragged them through his shit. They shouldn’t have had to learn how to protect themselves, Dean shouldn’t have had to protect Sam, that was
“Good morning Miss Brown,” he says. He’s wearing a bumble bee t-shirt under a denim jacket. His bright yellow canvas shoes match his t-shirt and the yellow knitted hat pulled over his ears. His nose is tinted pink from the cooler weather.
She blinks. “Died?”
?” She threw the book across the table. “Why am I just now hearing about this? Why isn’t this in the books?”
Dean makes grabby hands at the papers and Castiel passes them over wordlessly. “Is that all?” Castiel asks.
If Jack had full control of his powers, he would have broken through the seat belt and been halfway to the door by now. In fact, Jack had used his powers to unbuckle himself before, but Cas had realized before Jack was aware he was free. He hadn’t figured out how to do it again, luckily, but Dean’s still wary.
His fears still grip his heart and refuse to let go. Every single time Cas has died, every single time he lost him or almost lost him replays in his dreams like some fucked up compilation video. Probably titled something stupid like Dean’s Top 10 Biggest Fucking Failures.
Cas doesn’t respond when he knocks quietly on his door, at least not verbally. He does reach over to move the comforter in an open invitation.
“You have a son?” She tried not to sound too disappointed.
“Daddy gave me money.” Dean feels a pang in his chest.
Cas: Dean Asked Me To Text You That. He Also Says “It’s Time Efficient Too, Asshole”
“Okay? That’s it?” She watched him carefully write out,
“Hello,” she says as she approaches and holds out her hand. “You must be Jack’s parents?”
“Oh right.” Of course, they just talked about this last week. Hannah even helped recommend him some poetry books for a gift idea. “I really hope Cas likes those books, Mandy says they're her favorite, but I wouldn’t know a difference. Big plans tonight?”
“Shut up.” She kicks his leg, halfheartedly.
Sam tilts his paper toward him sheepishly. It’s a princess outline, Sam’s colored in her hair brown and her dress earthtones.
Which is
Emma actually has car-rider duty that afternoon, for once. She normally only does mornings, but she switched with Mr. Tate since he had a doctor’s appointment.
It’s in between customers, when things quiet down, that Dean speaks just above a whisper, “I think a coworker called me old yesterday.”
“Fine. Text him this,
“Actually, I don’t,” she hums and pulls something out of her bag. “Here,” she tosses him a bottle of ibuprofen. “You might wanna stop coming to work hungover, sorry, but those days are behind you.”
“Because they don’t need cars. They live in bamboo forests, and all their food is there already.”
He reemerges just a moment later.

“Dude, shut the hell up, we’re not— I didn’t mean it like that.” Dean shakes his head, gripping the counter. “I meant, I started—they came back.”
Ah, so he was married. Or at least in a relationship with the kid’s mom. And the way he talks about her, about them both… Clearly a devoted family man. Damn. Why is that so hot?
“No, he’s in High School and it’s Sammy.”
Dean sits in the kitchen with a cup of coffee that went cold a while ago. He doesn’t seek comfort with Cas, he doesn’t deserve it.
to stay with Cas. He
“Not like either of you had a chance with either one anyway,” Kathryn says.
“Well that didn’t answer any of our questions.” Maggie piped up.
Jack holds up two fingers with the hand not currently holding his toy car. “This many.”
Okay, that last one might’ve happened. Dean’s brain is still fucked up over his boss mistaking Cas as his husband. Cas.
