Hamish smiled and scooted closer to lean against his dad.
an idea. Start-up money,” Sherlock grinned, striding over to run a finger along the bare mantelpiece He felt a sudden stab of homesickness for the skull, the Cluedo board, his vast book collection, and most of all, his violin.
Sherlock shot daggers at John, but didn’t say anything as they headed down the stairs and got in the Gregson’s waiting carriage.
“We’re fairly certain the Doctor had something to do with your…genesis, but we’re not sure. How old are you?”
“Don’t….move…” He said lightly in John’s ear, watching Sherlock the entire time.
PREPARE FOR A CHAPTER DUMP!! Imma finish posting this TONIGHT. have the whole fic. RIGHT NOW. That's right.
“St. Bart’s, please,” Sherlock instructed the driver. With any luck, Molly would still be there working.
“Right. It doesn’t feel like we met him this morning.” John clicked off the light and curled in next to Sherlock, resting his head on his chest. “He fits us. It’s odd…” He closed his eyes, already feeling himself beginning to drift off.
He sat back, straddling John’s thighs, and shrugged off his own shirt, carefully tossing it aside, then began caressing his hands through John’s hair as John slid his trousers down his hips and kicked them off.
As soon as Mrs. Hudson was gone, Hamish burst out, taking a croissant. “An animal? Do you think it’s a fox? Can I come look?”
“We’re going,” Sherlock growled.
“And so modest,” John grinned, rolling his eyes and stood, grabbing the sandwich plate.                   Sherlock unfastened his violin case. He hadn’t played all month, other than some halfhearted sawing for a couple minutes at a time. “Being humble doesn’t suit me. Why would I have any desire to parade around acting like a moron, when I’m clearly not?”
“We want you to, Hamish,” John said. “But things are…complicated.” He looked up at Sherlock, unsure how to explain their predicament.
“Angel. In the flat. Debating whether to leave or to stay where I am. Maybe if I back against the wall. I don’t know if there’s more than one.”
Hamish looked at Sherlock sitting in his chair and cocked his head to the side before sitting up and drawing his own knees to is chest. He steepled his fingers as well, mirroring Sherlock.
Sherlock seemed to be memorizing the flat. His eyes scanned over everything—the skull, the bookshelves, John’s laptop, the dirty teacups on the tray teetering under stacks of old newspapers, the bullet holes in the wall. “I hate not knowing. When we’ll have to go,” Sherlock said.
John wondered if Mary had seen anything. She did seem to be giving Sherlock and him a strange look, but it quickly faded when she saw Hamish playing.
By the time Jim awoke, John had laid him on his bed, and it took him some time to remember what had happened. The pain in his shoulder was a convenient reminder, especially when he took deep breaths and the skin pulled at the wound, worsening the pain.
John was on the edge of an orgasm, writhing in his kneeling position and struggling against his handcuffs. God, if he came in his trousers, he would die of shame.
“Hamish, what happened to you?” Craig asked.
? It’s not a suitable activity for a doctor
“Does crime interest you, Mr. Holmes? London has plenty to offer, I’m afraid.”
Sherlock grudgingly bit into the sandwich, sinking onto the sofa. He turned what teh Doctor had said over and over in his mind. “I would say it’s impossible—but we’ve seen that time travel is possible. …Whatever remains, however improbable…must be the truth,” he muttered to himself.
"I have a bit more experience than the 'London Investigation 'N Detective Agency.'" Sherlock said the name with derision.
Once they were halfway decent again, John rolled to face Sherlock, his hand tracing along Sherlock’s ribs and around to his back, tracing the spine with his fingertips. It was relaxing to watch Sherlock’s body unwind once more, and his eyes slowly droop as he picked up John’s free wrist and kissed it.
John clenched his jaw. “Fine. I understand. But it’s not going to come to that. And even if he won, do you really think he’d accept a trade anyway? He plays by his own rules.”
Sherlock moved his hands up to hold John’s face and looks him in the eye, fighting back tears himself. “You haven’t forgotten, John, you
That proved to be impossible. Jim’s hands were rough on John’s body, yanking off his jacket and grabbing at his shoulders. He bit at John’s lips, his tongue forcing its way inside John’s mouth. He kissed John into disorientation, pushing him backwards until he nearly tripped over the staircase.
"Mycroft, what do you know about Torchwood?"
John was equally startled to realize that some part of him welcomed the closeness and the warmth at his back. As he slowly fell back asleep, he could almost imagine it was Sherlock wrapped around him, that he was safe at home on Baker Street.
“You could always chew tobacco, boss. It would turn your teeth a lovely brown,” John said drily. “Maybe it would instill fear in your enemies.”
It took several moments for Mary to understand. “Oh! You…but he’s…a man.”
“They're alive, Mary…they’re
“But—“ she stepped out to question them, but they’d already moved down the stairs of the apartment, locking the door behind them. John grabbed Hamish’s hand, who in turn took Sherlock’s.
is the only you one need to care about pleasing, and you are, obviously, as he won’t shut up about you.” He turned the page of the paper with a loud snap.
Mycroft smiled and the brothers finally caught each other’s eyes. Mycroft cleared his throat and stood up straight, remembering himself. “There’s so much left I never got to say. My brother—“ He cleared his throat, cutting himself off. “Well, perhaps if it’s best if I don’t say it.”
The Doctor’s steely expression softened and he ducked under the angel to face Sherlock directly. His voice was an almost reverent whisper. “Sherlock Holmes. You’ll just have to trust me. I’m the Doctor.”
"Oh, bored enough to pay him a visit personally instead of sending your sniffer dog out?" John asked dryly.
He stepped toward him, enjoying the unnerved look creeping into Sherlock’s face.  “What fun would
“No. This is ridiculous. Insane. It’s illogical. If that
Sherlock exchanged a look with John that equal parts incredulous, shocked, and amused. "It's a magic trick, then…it must be."
It was only a couple minutes’ walk to the café, but by the time Sherlock arrived, Jack was already at a table with a coffee. Sherlock couldn’t help coveting a time vortex manipulator of his own.
That was somehow worse than turning himself over to Jim and letting himself be taken. John pulled him closer to him by the edges of his shirt, then began kissing at his neck, biting lightly under his ear, then nibbling on the earlobe itself, which got a positive response.
killing her.“ he dropped his voice to a serious deadpan. “I’m sure she could provide…other services. And your landlord, your
John smiled at that. “A good, strong name.”
Hope flickered in Hamish’s eyes once more. “Questions about what?”
John grinned into his pint glass. “Maybe next time we see him—if he ever turns up—you can ask to vivisect him. Maybe his species is fine with that.”
“Sherlock, it’s just a game, behave,” John muttered. “Your turn, Hamish.”
Sherlock’s nostrils flared and John’s fists clenched and they walked on in silence past merry bands of pedestrians, joggers, dogs, and families.
“Ahh, you’re Dr. Watson, like from the stories? You write up the adventures?”
“I do miss the city sometimes, if that’s what you mean.” John leaned down to kiss then bite Jim's earlobe, an area John had learned is a sensitive spot for Jim.
“We just—I think we both want to know about him,” John said. “What’s he like? What does he like to do?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, annoyed. “I didn’t know the idea of me wanting you alive and unarmed would be so offensive to you.”
John was bothered by how much this reminded him of Sherlock, but was also somewhat pleased to know that Jim trusted him enough, or at least his medical opinion, to do what he said. John gave him three more days in bed, partially because he needed them, but partially so Jim was out of his hair, and Jim begrudgingly obliged.
John wondered as he felt the waves of pleasure hitting him. Why was Jim giving him pleasure while punishing him? His thoughts and his groans were cut off as Jim gave another yank to the rope around his neck.
“I want to be a detective too—or a doctor. Wouldn’t it be great to cut people open and see what’s inside?” Hamish turned to John. “Do
don't have clearance there. I'm not even entirely sure what goes on there, but it's one of the most secure places in London."
"Changes his face? You mean a different man takes on the persona of the Doctor?"
“--But then you will have a run-in with creatures that send you back to permanently live in Victorian London, thus rewriting history. So this is draft one, so to speak: you’re seeing a London that won’t exist when you disappear, because you—both of you—will be famous historical and literary characters from a century before. And this is one of those fixed points in time that
He would have to convince Jim that he liked him, that he
“I’m running a favor for Dr. Filton. He requested the scan,” John said.
idea, John! I just—I just held a chunk of tarmac with a face in it! It's insane! It's all insane!"
He shoved John backwards, forcing John to fall back onto the sofa. He haulted himself to a sitting position, glaring up at Jim. He restrained himself from leaping up and strangling him; he needed to know where Hamish was, and until he did, he’d have to play along.
“It’s good. Jim is telling me what stuff is true and what stuff is false that they think is true!”
“Pipe?” Doyle took a break from writing to pack a pipe of his own, offering a second to John.
Hamish stood as well, then looked up hopefully at John. “Will you…both…tuck me in?”
“Near Portobello Road, on some side street close to the park. And the box was just…there on the sidewalk.”
“What an eccentric flatmate he must be!”
That slowly began to change, however. As John worked any shift he could take at the hospital, Sherlock enrolled Hamish in school and spent his days helping with petty crimes that gave the police moderate trouble. They were crimes so petty that he wouldn’t have bothered with them in his old life, but he had to build a reputation somehow. It helped somewhat. Some police began accepting Sherlock when he popped round to Scotland Yard to offer advice, since they were quickly catching on that he was always right.
“Oh. Dear, I’m sorry to bring it up.” Mary looked bashfully at the floor for a moment.
He caught John’s horrified look. “Oh come on, you’re a
can we have a son?”
John murmured into his mouth as he kissed him, “You son of a bitch. I’m right here.”
doctor. And I won’t be going tonight. I’ll be looking after you.”
“Does that mean my babysitter will be returning tonight?” Jim asked, eyeing John.
John let out a furious, pained groan, blinking back tears as Jim thrust in a few more times before coming himself, not pulling out until his erection had completely disappeared.
“I’ve got him. He’s fine—he’s all right—everyone’s fine, John.” Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, pulling him up against him, not having any intention of ever letting go of him again. His voice cracked as he held on. “394 days…394 days since I’ve been able to do this.”
“Sherlock, were you
John stared down the blackness of the barrel for a few tense moments before he finally reached behind him, pulled out the gun, and dropped it to the floor. He raised his hands up, stumbling away from Jim. If this was how John was going to go out, he wanted answers. “
“The statues move only when nobody’s looking, right?” He clarified. “None of the residents has seen on actually move on its own?”
Sherlock looked at the Doctor with a new respect. He understood entirely why the Doctor hadn’t told him and John about the plan; he would have done the same. No sense getting someone’s hopes up if there was a chance it could fail. Sherlock looked down at Hamish, who was still clinging to him. He would hardly consider Hamish any sort of failure, however.
“Tact, Sherlock,” John muttered.
Jim grunted and nudged the body with his shoe, annoyed. “Grab his legs.”
John turned his head to look at him. “There must be a way out of this. What if we smash the angels to bits? What if we don’t blink?”
"Faith? He's not a god, is he?"
“Of course I think about him. But I would rather have him safe and unbothered by you than running for his life or dead. It’s better this way. And I’m coming to realize…” John leaned over to bite Jim's other ear. “You can offer me things he couldn’t. You keep me busy, make me feel needed. He was always trying to protect me.” John was disgusted to realize this was all true, in a way.
Sherlock and Hamish waited on a bench near the door as John approached the front desk. St. Bart’s was a large hospital, even now. Surely there had to be some sort of job vacancy.
Mary knocked forcefully on Sherlock's door. It was, as it had often been for the past few months, locked. “Mr. Holmes? SHERLOCK! Open up!”
All my Mycroft feels.
anything? Jane, if I’m asking too much, then I will find another way, but I have got to get back to my…wife. And I have to get Hamish away from this man, before he becomes like him. Jane…please…” He gripped her shoulders tightly. It had been ages since he’d been able to tell anyone what was going on in his mind, and admitting how desperate he was now almost put him over the edge. It was everything he could do to keep from collapsing.
“Who’s Arthur Conan Doyle?”
thorough! …but then again, I suppose I don’t actually know that’s what you were doing…but, John…” Jim stopped thrusting, staying inside him and leaving John panting until he pulled back hard on the rope around his neck, forcing his head back. John gave a strangled moan as Jim leaned over, his lips touching John's ear as he said quietly, “
Jim stood and began buttoning up his shirt. John didn’t think he was going to answer, but when he reached the last button he said, staring straight ahead, “Because my father was ‘sir,’ and I—“ Jim’s eyes flashed dangerously as they met John’s. “—am NOT that low-life, drunken, belligerent scum bag.”
“We should go, then,” John said. Once they were out the door, he turned to Hamish. “All right, what did Sherlock tell you to snitch?”
Sherlock was grinning ear to ear. John knew he should be angry with the boy, but he was almost impressed.
He heard Sherlock stomp up the stairs and burst into the room, growling. “The thing’s indestructible!” he growled. “I couldn’t even scratch it.”
"Will you help us, then?" John asked eagerly.
The most infuriating part of it all to Sherlock was that if they had been sent back to 1895 during their first run-in with the angels, they never would have met him. What
! JAMES MORIARTY! DID YOU KILL MY SON, YES OR NO?!” John’s voice came out utterly desperate and commanding, his eyes flashing. All fear had left him. If he had no chance of seeing Hamish or Sherlock again, then there was nothing left to fear.
John took a deep breath, staring down the hideous piece of stone in front of him. “Always.” He gripped Sherlock’s hand tighter. He would follow this man anywhere. “On your signal.”
Sherlock impatiently glanced at the time. “Why can’t this man
"What, with that device on your arm? Let me see that." Sherlock seized his arm and began to examine the manipulator. He'd never seen anything else like it. "How on earth does a 'time vortex manipulator' even work? How do you know this Doctor in the first place? How do you contact him?"
John glanced sideways at Sherlock. As annoyed as Sherlock was pretending to be, John knew he was thrilled. Finally, a
Aaaand we're off to 1895 at long last!!
A man with floppy brown hair, a prominent chin, bowtie, tweed jacket, and scuffed boots stepped out of the kitchen munching on a carrot. "Hats." He looked at John and Sherlock thoughtfully, then pointed an accusing finger at Sherlock. "Did you know there are lungs in your refrigerator? I hope you weren't planning on eating them. They give you horrible indigestion." He added, almost as a sidenote to himself, "I am never going back to Pluto," then aloud once more, "Love your landlady! Almost makes me wish I lived in a flat. Almost."
“Yes, of course I’m alien. If you were in Italy I’d sound Italian. The TARDIS does a marvelous job translating,” the Doctor said absently, pacing. “Why are you here?
"Oh, the Doctor exists. And sometimes I can even track him down," Jack grinned.
“…and I don’t know if you
“Thank you, Mary,” John said gratefully.
Sherlock let John drag him to his feet and begrudgingly followed him outside, muttering about the need for cigarettes.
John was quick to notice that he was the only man not wearing a hat. Sherlock still had his deerstalker on, remarkably. He must have noticed that he would look less conspicuous with it on than off.
Sherlock only smiled at that, staring ahead, so Hamish settled back in his chair, sighing. His eyes followed a passing doctor. “That man’s got a secret, hasn’t he? Look at how he’s holding that folder.”
Mary rested a hand on his shoulder, a lump in her throat. She tried to clear it and to keep her voice steady. “I’m…I’m sure everything will turn out all right. If anyone can find them, you can. All those stories John’s told Mr. Doyle about you…if they’re true…everything will be all right.”
Jim considered this, as if he hadn’t already thought about it. “Mmm, no, I don’t think that’s true at all. I rarely get tired of prizes. Just knowing that
Sherlock and John grew used to the sight of the horrific angels trapped in their narrow flat corridor after a couple days, although they were a nuisance to skirt around. They were brainstorming ways to get rid of them without breaking the angels’ eye contact with each other as they were walking home when they saw a blue phone box parked outside of Speedy’s café.
It was invasive and overwhelming, and even while John struggled to breathe as Jim’s tongue ran along his teeth, as he sucked at John’s tongue, John felt a warm arousal beginning. Jim knew how to kiss. He knew how to vary the pressures and how to move his lips just right to make John moan against his will.
Jim picked up speed, sending the headboard slamming against the wall. Despite the pain, John felt his arousal increasing. Jim was making a conscious effort to hit John's prostate, pleasuring him.
“And you’re a lucky one, kitten.
The next night, John called Harry, who asked lots of questions, accusing him of being very vague. It frustrated him that he couldn’t get more specific, but he’d had to leave it as it was.
He had hoped this comment would pacify John, but the man was on a roll with his rant. “No, no! Of course you didn’t! It’s all, ‘Adorable blog, John!’ ‘Shut up and have some jam like an ordinary person, John!’ ‘I’m not going to tell you when I’m in mortal peril because I have to protect you, John!’ I’m not some tiny hedgehog that needs coddling, you know! Sometime you make me feel so…so…so less of a man. Weak.”
John refrained from talking too much to preserve his voice, but he hugged Hamish as often as he could, and after dinner, which was dominated by Hamish’s conversation—Jim was absent—John told Hamish how proud he was of him.
Hamish looked in wide-eyed alarm between Sherlock and Jim, baffled. “Da—Uncle Sherlock, stop!”
” Jim snapped in a threatening voice that threw John off-guard for a moment.
trying to do?”
John stepped inside and sighed. “Well…no.”
“I’ll never stop hating you,” John said. The heavy opium smoke was getting to him, clouding his brain. He was finding it harder and harder to stay conscious. He was vaguely aware that Jim had sidled in to sit beside him, gripping his shoulders to keep him sitting upright.
Sherlock fell to the floor to sit, and stared lamely at his violin. His voice was dazed. “He took them, Mary. He took both of them.”
“You can’t bring yourself to say it, can you? ‘I’m Sherlock Holmes, I don’t find people attractive, I’m too
John’s hair stood on edge, even though he’d been expecting the sight. Hamish yelped in surprise and squeezed his dads’ hands tighter.
He cleared his throat and stood to wind a striped knit scarf around his neck that Sherlock had never seen before. “I’m off to meet some men from the hospital. They want to attend a show and smoke cigars and swirl brandy and the like. Should be…interesting,” John said. “Save me a bit of supper, will you, Mary?” he called into the kitchen.
Jim continued to lean against the wall, eyes narrowed, wetting his lips. He finally shrugged away from the door frame and slowly walked towards John, dragging his nails across the back of John's shoulder as he circled him. He drawled, “You're a smart man, Dr. Watson...”
“We’ll need a description of him, as accurate as you can make it,” Sherlock said.
Hamish gave Doyle a knowing look as he handed over the gravy boat a bit unsteadily. “We’ve been in Liverpool for the past few years.”
“Istanbul, 1927.” Jack looked out at the busy road. “Nice to have a break. The city’s a bit hectic that year.” He smiled at Sherlock as he sat back down. “Boy, that face of yours just gets prettier every time I see it. How’s your hunt for the Doctor?”
Sherlock looked up at him calmly, feigning ignorance. “I assure you I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
timeline…he could be in 1775 by now, for all we know.” It drove John mad. They had
“Maybe I will, John,” Jim said, clicking the cylinder back in place, removing the safety and stroking the barrel against John’s jaw, then pressed it against his cheek.
John pulled away slowly. “Stop it…you’re making me blush.”
John removed his bowler as he stooped to enter the opium den. It was difficult to see far into it, as it was so dimly lit and full of smoke.
John smiled genuinely for the first time since Hamish had been home and squeezed her shoulders affectionately, fighting back the urge to kiss her on the cheek. “All I need is for you to receive and send letters—they’ll be addressed to you, and outgoing ones will be addressed to a fake relative of yours in London—I’ll arrange everything so that Jim never finds out. And it won’t be for a few months, after I go to London…if I can get there. Thank you, Jane.
many girlfriends, Sherlock? What will it take to convince you that I’m not lying?” What would it take to convince
, Doctor Watson?” Jim giggled, his hand clawing down John’s thigh and around to his bum. He prodded his finger inside of John, brushing it teasingly against the prostate. John felt a surge of pleasure hit him and he gasped and bucked up.
Sherlock watched him, silently tapping his hand against the wall it was resting against. “John…I need to ask you a strange question.”
Jim's eyes went dark and he took a step close to John so that they were nearly touching. His voice dangerously low, Jim said, “Yes or no.
Sherlock set down his violin and tightened the hairs of his bow. “Choosing to utilize my intellectual prowess doesn’t make me a dick. I can’t help that the vast majority of people are idiots.”
“What do you think?” He longed to put his jumper back on.
John left for his room, and by the time he’d returned in his pyjamas, Moriarty was in bed with his back facing John. He’d left enough room for John on the other side. John crawled carefully into bed, wondering what on earth Jim was thinking at the moment.
Hamish’s eyes went wide and he swung his head back to John, hoping he’d deny it. “…Dad?”
Jack did the same, looking him up from head to toe. "Sherlock Holmes." He extended his hand to shake. "Hellooooo. Tall, dark, and handsome! Be still my heart. And who's this?" He smiled at John.
“We’re all going to cram into your box while you find a book? I’ll wait here, thanks,” Sherlock sniffed.
“Fudge doesn’t make me smile. Treacle or otherwise.”
“Don’t snore,” Jim said, leaving off the threat to stab him.
Jim stayed where he was, silent for a moment. “What's your angle, John? Honestly, I'm curious, because I'm having a hard time figuring it out.”
Sherlock smiled despite his loathing of the hat, then ripped it off and tossed it at John, who put it back on the angel.
“I wondered if you would be able to, one day, send some letters for me.” He held his breath as he waited for her reply.
John finally found his voice as well. “You’re—you’re really him. My God. What do you mean, 1895? How did you find us?”
“Goodbye, Sherlock.”
, it felt amazing to hit him. He could beat him for all eternity.
“Beg for me, slut,” Jim snarled, clawing an oiled hand across John’s bum.
Hamish was right, the cards quickly showed, and he was unabashedly elated at winning. “This game’s brilliant! It’s like what Dad does, right?”
"Regenerated?" Sherlock waited for clarification.
“Where have the wife and kid gone off to, Sherlock?” Jim asked, his voice nasal and taunting. “Bright little Hamish and his dear doctor dad?”
do that, Dad?”
Crimes can be committed anywhere. You, little Hamish and I can relocate and Sherlock can live a life of peace and safety. The decision is up to you. If you agreed to become my employee, I would pay you handsomely, and of course Hamish will attend only the best schools.” Jim paused to let this sink in, then dropped his voice to an icy snarl. “
“Well…” Sherlock cleared his throat, which felt unnecessarily tight, and John hastily got up to fetch a glass of water from the kitchen. “There’ve been…signs…”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, but nodded stiffly. “Of course.” He grabbed the hat and pulled it on.
The next morning, John woke up as Jim was still sleeping. He was lying on his stomach, his face turned towards John, breathing softly. John studied the face of the sleeping psychopath for a moment. It looked like such a harmless face when dormant.
Sherlock glared down at Hamish, but sighed and said with some difficulty, “I’m…sorry. Forgive my rudeness.”
much more fun than I thought you would be… Now. Get the fuck off of me.”
Jim didn’t say anything, just sat up and watched him before getting out of bed himself, a mixture of confusion, disgust and curiosity on his face, confusion winning out.
"That's what Elton meant when he wrote on his website that the Doctor could 'change his face,'" Sherlock murmured, lacing his fingers. "Fascinating."
much better than the ones at school!” The fridge—“Are those…fingers? JAM!”, the angels—“Why’re they wearing silly hats?”. He grabbed the deerstalker off one of them. “Dad! You’re that detective, the one who fake-died! Put it on!”
“Definitely worth it,” John said. “That was…amazing, Sherlock.”
for you? Help you make plans to kill innocent people, to kill
“Why do you sleep in my room every night?”
“And I believe you, of course I do: here you are, living proof. But it’s still wrong. It’d be like if Lord Nelson was living down the street. It’s in the
He watched Hamish closely. Hamish frowned a bit, thinking, then turned to John. “So you two are time travelers? Amazing! Can I come with you?”
Jim giggled and stepped backwards toward the door. “No, you won’t. John, Hamish, and I won’t be seeing you ever again. Isn’t sharing fun? I should’ve thought this up
John shook his head and answered blandly, “No, sir. He’ll be dealt with.”
John came over with his tea and settled in his chair. “I used to. I was actually a doctor in the war, but I was shot and sent home. That’s how I met your dad. I needed a flatmate.” John smiled to himself. He couldn’t help but wish things would stay like this. If only they could stay comfortable in their own time period, solving crimes and helping their son grow up in the world they already knew well.
“Destroy the statues and your disappearances will stop,” Sherlock said again. He looked uneasily back at the statue before turning to John. “We should go.”
Jim boredly scanned the room. “I miss the skull motif. It was such a nice touch.”
“Never one for speeches,” Sherlock snorted, relieved that the teary moment had passed. He looked over his brother a final time. “Goodbye, Mycroft.”
John snorted at his overdramatic take on the recent lag in cases and scanned the paper. “Another police disappearance. That’s…three this month?” He looked up from the paper expectantly.
“Glad we’re on the same page,” John mumbled into his mouth. “For once.” He sighed and looked at the disarray of the room. “Maybe…maybe we should get up—“ he suggested reluctantly.
What had John expected? A compliment? Some act of mercy? He had asked for this, John reminded himself. He had to play the part. He rolled back into a kneeling position, then braced his hands against the bed, forcing himself to relax, trying not to think of the pain. John hoped Jim would ease in somehow. It was impossible to tell what he’d do.
“It’s hardly an ideal situation, but our lives have fallen into a striking pattern of far from ideal situations lately, so it’s hardly productive to fret about it.”
happen, or, as I said…rip in the pocket of the universe and everything goes a bit mad, or madder than usual…”
“You were born in the late 1970s, grew up here, moved to London,”
“Sh-Sherlock—” John stumbled backward, hand to his mouth, too afraid to approach the figure. He couldn't be real. He couldn't be.
Hamish laughed at his dads’ bickering, looking at everything with dinner plate eyes.
After a particularly loud cry through the gag, Jim yanked on the rope around John's neck, forcing John’s head to snap back, the rope cutting off his air supply to silence him. The pressure released after a few seconds, leaving John breathing hard through his nose, but the pain at his throat remained.
That all changed when Jim pulled away and shoved him against the bed, nearly sending him teetering over. “No need to go so soft on me, kitten,” he said, then grabbed a fistful of John’s hair, yanked his head to the side, and bit his neck, hard, grinding his hips against John’s obscenely.
“Thought as much.” Jim leaned forward to take up one of the hookah’s long pipes and inhaled, holding the smoke in for a moment before blowing it John’s way. He muttered, more to himself, it seemed, “So predictable. Consistant. Take a family member, get a result.”
“Will somebody please tell me what’s
?” He wound back and punched Jim as hard as he could in the chest, knocking Jim backwards into the wall.
“Still, I think it would be wisest to prepare, in case the Doctor’s predictions are right,” Sherlock reasoned, tossing on pyjama pants and sliding into bed.
Sherlock took a deep, shaky breath, then nodded. John squeezed his hand.
"If anyone would know something about some secretive government branch that deals with time-traveling alien doctors, it would be my dear brother," he muttered to John as he waited for Mycroft to answer.
He turned, wide-eyed to look at John and Sherlock.
the last time I’m going to see you?”
!” John spluttered.
“Do you really think this is a good idea, Sherlock?” John whispered as they followed Lestrade up the stairs to the apartment.
“Kill him,” Jim said flippantly.
Sherlock looked over to John, then turned around to face the cellar door. Hamish kept a tight grip on his fathers’ hands as they climbed the stairs and stepped into what used to be—or what
“Not unless it becomes necessary. It’s an experiment I’ve had on the backburner for a while. I need something so I don’t completely languish away in stagnation.”
here…here in front of him, forced to watch it all…that makes it even better for him. The man he respects the most in the whole world, watching him succumb to his dirty little pleasure. What could be more humiliating than that?” Magnussen said, his cold eyes turning to Sherlock.
Sherlock leaned over to observe how the man clutched the folder to his chest. “Yes, indeed. Knuckles white from gripping it so hard, sweat visible on the forehead.” He looked over at Hamish, impressed. “What else can you see?”
Jim rolled his eyes. “Oh
As Sherlock positioned himself carefully over John’s hips, John realized, wide-eyed what was going to happen. God, he was going to have to do everything he could to stop himself with coming immediately.
“It said so on your identity card. That’s one of the reasons we match.” He pushed a stack of clothes back into the suitcase. “Why’s
Sherlock’s mouth dropped open at the sight of the violin case, lost for words, then sprung from his chair, accepting the case from John. He set the case on his chair to carefully open it. It was a beautiful instrument. Sherlock ran his fingers along the taut strings and the varnished wood before gently picking it up. “John…how did you…?”
Sherlock rushed in to examine the large stone angel, its wings folded and its head buried in its hands, as if it were weeping. He touched it hesitantly. It was stone, absolutely. The entirety of it was stone. How could a stone
to come! If you don’t like the way I work, then you are more than welcome to leave.” He stood back up and circled around the other body.
Without further explanation he tossed the phone to John, and John listened to each of the messages, each from the same woman.
feel if every time she came into the room she holds
“We’re recently been enlightened in our view of how time works as well,” Sherlock pointed out. “But even if our DNA
John stared at him. It had only been a month and a few days since he’d last seen him, but Sherlock looked so different, but even now John wanted him. Whatever John had prepared to say to him was lost, and he could only stare at him.
John looked up and to the left, pretending to rack his brain. It was probably best not to mention Dougherty. He doubted merely talking to him would get him in trouble, but it might raise suspicions. The man wasn't exactly in Jim's immediate ring of men. “Nnnope, I think that's it,” he said, surprising himself with the casual tone he managed to pull off.
“John,” Jim nodded a bored greeting and sank into his desk chair.
“What will you miss the most?” John asked. He glanced at the electric kettle and the light switches. He hadn’t even thought about electricity until now. How much electricity did they have in 1895?
John watched Sherlock carefully as a strong hatred for the Doctor bubbled up inside of him. Here everything had just been getting so perfect. Sherlock and him, finally together…it wasn’t unfair.
Jim disappeared, and John breathed a sigh of relief. All things considered, he’d gotten off easy. Bored Jim was the worst kind of Jim; bored Jim carved patterns into peoples’ eyeballs with a knife or set animals on fire or sat down and wrote out an elaborate, disturbing plan that would desecrate all of Ireland if he chose to put it to work.
John, touched to the core, looked into Hamish’s big eyes and nodded. “Yeah, you go change and we’ll be up in a bit.”
“I don’t look hilarious, I look…dapper. Right, Sherlock?”
“Well,
“Pollution, poor hygiene, and poorer sewer systems,” Sherlock said.
For the next few days, John avoided the flat. Sherlock didn’t try to contact him for help with cases, unsure whether to be relieved, since it spared them both of embarrassing, awkward conversations, or hurt. Hurt, Sherlock decided, was an absurd thing to think. So what if he’d been wrong? So what if John had rejected him? It wasn’t as if he felt anything for John. He buried himself in his work and experiments, trying to get rid of the echoing question John had posed that night. “You don’t…feel anything for me, do you?”
“Well, of course they don’t move on their own, freak, they’re
Jim. John felt dizzy. Jim couldn’t have. Not Hamish. Please, God, not Hamish. “Thank you…” John said faintly, leaving in a haze. There were two main possibilities, as far as John could see. Jim could be withholding Hamish from John as punishment. Perhaps he transferred Hamish to another school, a school where John couldn’t visit him. John shook his head bitterly. Of course. It was what Jim had always wanted: a protégé. What better way than to remove John’s influence altogether?
John shook his head. He’d thought up a lie for this in the cab. “My household recently suffered from a fire. I had been operating a business from home, but that’s all gone now, so I thought I would offer my services to the hospital. My papers were burned in the fire, but I can pass any medical test you give me, I assure you.”
“Sherlock—don’t,” John said. The idea of statues moving on their own was absurd, but he had no mind to try and test Sherlock’s theory, especially after what the Doctor had told them.
Sherlock glared up at him, pressing his fingertips together. “Creatures. The angels? You think that…
“Sherlock, be honest,” John said after a moment, crossing to stand in front of Sherlock, who was now beginning to play out a slow, sad melody. “The whole angels thing…you don’t really buy, it do you?”
The search at Notting Hill was fruitless. Sherlock texted a city maintenance contact to see if any police boxes had been sent or relocated to the area, or if he'd heard of any other reports concerning police boxes, with no luck.
“Romantic” was not a word that agreed with Sherlock. He had removed himself so far from anything of the sort for decades, but now, he was frustrated to find, his mind kept drifting back to the kiss. It had been so short, and so
Jim held himself inside for a moment, waiting for John’s muscles to stop spasming around him, then began to pump in and out of John at a fast rate. “Sherlock’s loyal pet—giving me a treat out of his own free will. Did Christmas come early, kitten?”
to do! You can
Jim continued to sit up in bed, glaring down at John. “Get in.”
Sherlock slapped the newspaper onto the dining table in 221B Baker Street, making the housemaid Mary jump.
. Think you can handle that?”
“If you don’t want to watch, and I sincerely hope you don’t, I suggest you read the paper,” Sherlock murmured. “Not that there are any worthwhile crimes to read about,” he muttered.
“John never did admit to you that humiliation is one of his greatest turn-ons, did he?” Magnussen said, bending over toward John and splaying his nimble, sweaty fingers over John’s hair. “Then again, why would he? He never told his wife…”
Everything John had noticed with fleeting glances about Sherlock seemed magnified now; the tendons at his neck, leading down to the dip of his collarbone, his nearly iridescent pale skin, his piercing eyes, which were now locked with John’s.
“One place more.”
“Yes,
think we’re a couple?” John asked. Granted, they were now, but they hadn’t been for very long!
This was his one chance. He had to try. John surprised himself by walking over to grab her shoulders and saying urgently, “Jane. Are you married? Do you have any children?”
“Ooh, no thank you. Bad for the health, you know,” John laughed, then immediately realized his anachronistic error.
John wasn't prepared for the fist to his stomach, which sent him doubling over, gasping. Jim wandered behind him, slowly trailing a finger from one of John's bare shoulders to the other, then without warning grabbed John's neck, forcing him upright.
Mary blushed at his rude gaze, then dropped her eyes to the floor and nodded, her voice barely a whisper. “What’ve you done with John and Hamish…sir?”
, John?”
“Yes. Aliens. Aliens, Sherlock. You can’t think…I mean obviously this man is a bit mad, right?”
“Not forget, I just don’t see you in order…apparently,” the Doctor said, perplexed.
John nodded, nervous. He’d never killed anyone he’d known for Moriarty before. John followed the still shirtless Jim downstairs in case he had more tasks. John had eaten with, chatted with, and worked alongside O’Seanassy. He wouldn’t call him a friend, but he didn’t relish the idea of killing him.
“And other times he seemed like he was five! I don’t think it would be possible to sit down and have a proper conversation with him,” John said.
One weekend, Jim and John visited Hamish at school, which only refueled the fire inside John. He began growing antsy and considered risking his lie to ask Jim about London if Jim didn't bring it up soon. John didn't have to worry for long, though.
move! Instead of repairing the friendship, he’d now most likely ruined it for good. John was about to apologize when Sherlock lunched back at him, dropping his cigarette and pressing his mouth against John’s, desperately grabbing him.
The tailor raised an eyebrow but said, “A fine fit. Bowlers suit you, sir.”
“So, what else do you want from me? I’ve loved you far longer than you’ve loved me, and I still get this feeling that I’m being fickle—it’s really unfair.”
Jim didn't even notice that John had called him “sir” again, but picked up a vase and chucked it against the opposite wall with a cry of rage, where it burst into pieces. “
“All right?” John whispered.
Sherlock looked up from his notes to look out the window, snorting in bitter amusement. “
like everyone else?
“Definitely.”
“Oh, he trades...he’s just creative about it. If you’ll recall, he traded yours, Mrs. Hudson’s, and Lestrade’s life for mine...although I imagine that
“I told you that you wouldn’t like it. Now, if my calculations are correct…” The Doctor glanced at his watch again. “You should be getting a call soon. Make sure you talk to Arthur Conan Doyle. He’ll be very interested in your stories. Try not to be too…modern with the details. And good luck.”
John’s instinct was to leave Jim to rant until he felt better, but it occurred to him that perhaps Jim wanted to voice his complaints to someone. And John was the only one he could complain to. John sighed and sank into a wing-backed chair facing the sofa.
“Every horse can be broken,” Jim drawled. “It’ll be nice having a doctor on call,” he mused.
John kissed him back eagerly, wrapping his hands around Sherlock’s sides and feeling his prominent ribcage. “Did you eat at
John about-faced subconsciously and left. He found the man and did the job, making an effort not to dwell on it. He didn’t let himself wonder if the man had a family or not. He’d kept his distance. Just another body, he’d thought.
John glared at him, then grabbed him by the neck with both hands and kissed him forcefully, making Sherlock’s knees buckle as John pushed his mouth open with his tongue, then pulled away to murmur, “I’m right here.”
“Did you see the box at all that night of the Blitz?” John asked. As absurd as the story was, he found himself becoming engrossed.
Hamish sniffed and nodded, wiping his nose off on his sleeve. “Are—are we going to live here now? Is this…Professor Moriarty’s house?”
John turned bright red, then hastily changed the subject. “You said you don’t have a mum and dad. Are you an orphan?”
He gave her a final look of gratitude and a short nod before leaving the kitchen, thinking. He had, for the most part, gained Jim’s trust as far as a job was concerned, but if Jim was ever going to let him go to London, he would have to believe that John had put Sherlock out of his mind entirely.
of you. And...and your…secret is safe with me. About you two.”
can this be real? So much of it
They reached the main foyer, where the classmates were all glaring at Hamish for making them wait. Hamish, unperturbed by his classmates’ angry looks, turned to face John and Sherlock and stuck his hand out. “Sophie says it’s polite to shake people’s hands when you meet them, but I think it’s a load of rubbish. Why should have to touch people straight-off when you meet them?”
“Dad. You’ll never guess what we found out,” Hamish grinned, crawling onto his Dad’s lap.
much for sending your lackey to tell me the news.” His grin was tight. “How predictable.”
They had enough money to hire a cab to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital. John felt much less self-conscious in his suit. In his long coat and his hat, Sherlock didn’t look absurdly out of place, and Hamish was only a boy, so some odd clothing choice could be explained away by a number of possibilities.

Lestrade nodded. “All six were residents of Barrington Arms, and they just
Sherlock could see it, and that was the worst thing. John clearly wanted this on some level, but on another level John’s hatred for Magnussen was burning just as strongly much as Sherlock’s was.
“Yes, that’s right, have a good laugh,” John said, although he couldn’t help smiling a bit himself, especially when Sherlock grabbed a bowler hat from a stand and set it on John’s head.

don’t call them that,” Hamish said. “And Wilfred came to visit me over my birthday last year. Although I don’t know if it’s my actual birthday or not.” He frowned at his sloppily folded jumper and shook it out to start over. “Do
He finally withdrew John from his mouth very slowly, leaving John sweating and writhing and straining at the belts hold him back. He watched as Sherlock peeled off his own trousers and pants, then Sherlock met his eyes.
John could see the knife handle poking out beneath Jim’s pillow, but even so, he was able to roll over and fall asleep much faster than he had the night before.
“Although if we managed to fend the angels off and stay here, you might have to put up with people walking on eggshells around you for the rest of your life,” John pointed out.
John gasped and tensed his back, but nodded for Sherlock to continue. He slowly spread his fingers, trying to stretch the opening a bit.
Jim didn’t arrive until 7 pm. John was sitting, drumming his fingers on his knee in the drawing room and pretending to read a book.
John stalked up to him. “What the
The next morning, Sherlock woke up curled around John. He checked his phone on the dresser for the time, but it had died during the night, so he slipped out of bed with minimal movement so as not to wake John.
“Not true. My father wasn’t exactly a great role model. Why do you think Harry took up drinking? Dear old Dad taught her all his best tricks.” He kicked off his shoes and pulled off his jumper.
Mary shuddered, stepping away from him. She kept her head down, too terrified to look him in the eyes. “N-no, sir. He’s upstairs, sir.”
.” He pulled on his waistcoat, turned to leave, then looked back at John. “Hamish’s school goes on holiday starting next weekend, so if you don’t want me alone with your son, I suggest you hurry.”
“Absolutely. When do you fancy?”
Sherlock winced a bit, then grinned. “I got into a bit of a scuffle, but I got him—nothing is ever new, crimes are only recycled with small variants here or there. I talked to a few bystanders, did a bit of footwork. It was hardly difficult. Similar to the aluminium crutch case, actually. Also, I met a DI from the Yard—Gregson. And—“ From his coat Sherlock pulled out a weighty bag of coins, and John laughed in surprised delight. “There was a reward out for our Belgravia Slasher as well. It should tide us over until the money from your job comes in.”
“Worth a try,” Sherlock said. “I know pick-pocketing Mr. Doyle isn’t the ideal solution, but we look like a group of nutters in our clothes. No one is going to give you a job if you’re dressed like that, John, no matter how talented you are. Now that we’ve got
changed things for reasons I can’t understand yet.” They headed back to the TARDIS and stepped back inside.
John found himself hardening, disgusted at how readily his body reacted to someone as loathsome as Jim. He shuddered and pressed his back up against Jim almost involuntarily.
Jim let his eyes slowly slide down Mary’s figure and back up to her eyes, wetting his lips. “Sherlock warned you about me, did he? How considerate.” He raised an eyebrow and stepped forward, pushing his way inside. “Is he in, love? I’ve got some rather interesting news concerning Doctor Watson and Hamish.” He let his eyes wander up the stairs before turning them back on Mary, his gaze suddenly harsh.
“Sherlock, we’re a bit baffled here—there’ve been six disappearances from Barrington Arms in Brixton, and the witness accounts are telling us nothing. Would you mind popping round? I’ll text you the address.”
why you keep me around, isn’t it? The short, dumpy-looking ex-army doctor makes the tall, mysertious detective look all the more striking by comparison! I’m the Robin to your ‘Hat-Man,’ the bachelor to your boffin. That’s just fine! It’s fine!”
“Ugh, a life without texts. Actually having to bother talking to people,” Sherlock grumbled. “And what’ll we do with a fridge? Where’ll I keep the blood and the thumbs?”
“You’re acting like a
?” John asked breathily as Sherlock groaned and arched his back to press his chest against John’s.
Why hadn’t he just believed John and left it? Why had he felt the urge to prove it?
Sherlock hadn’t expected to see John reading the classifieds the very next morning, however. He tried to hide the paper when Sherlock came down, but he wasn’t quick enough.
John was healing slowly. He stopped doing push-ups every day. He stopped carrying a pistol in his coat. He explained to Hamish why he had to lie to him, and though it was difficult, John explained to Sherlock how he had gained Moriarty's trust.
ever called you ‘dumpy-looking’, least of all, myself.”
“No, it’d be useless. An utter waste of time,” Sherlock said, pausing to drink a large portion of his pint. “I would love to take a scalpel to that man and dissect him. Now
“Dad, what’s going on?”
“If you still want me on the cases with you, I’m more than game. I just can’t—“ John couldn’t torment himself anymore. He had to move on, to try and find someone else he could latch his affections onto. He realized now that he’d been doing that very thing during his entire residency at Baker Street, as evidenced by his string of failed relationships and bitter ex-girlfriends. “I can’t be what you want me to be, and you can never be what I—“ John stopped himself and finished, matter of factly, “I’ll let you know when I find a place.
” Sherlock snarled.
There was muttering from the other line, then the buzzer sounded and the door unlocked itself. As they went up the stairs, John asked, “Are you sure you want me here?”
“Wait, how do we know that you didn’t read my blog then make that book up yourself, and bring us here for your own bizarre…alien agenda?” John offered up.
John cast Sherlock a warning glance.
“Jim, I went to the school. He’s missing, and I know you did something. And I know you did something to Sherlock too.
“Can I go with you?” Hamished asked, sitting bolt upright.
Sherlock and Hamish watched the blue box whir and fade from the empty street corner. They returned home to John, who had gotten home from the hospital and was in his chair with a newspaper.
“Oh God…” John groaned.
“And a consulting detective killer, too. Although I hope never in the literal sense,” Sherlock said, giving John a light kiss before disentangling himself and standing up.
John moaned a bit louder, hungry for more. He pulled down the zipper to Sherlock’s trousers, then slid his hands over Sherlock’s slender back and into his trousers, grabbing at his bare skin. Sherlock felt delicious, but he jerked away from John’s touch, reaching behind him and grabbing John’s wrists, slamming them up against the bed above John’s head.
Sherlock couldn’t decide what was more irritating about the Doctor—the fact that he was impossible to deduce anything from, or the fact that he spouted nonsense every time he flapped his mouth. “You
Sherlock was still staring at the wall. It looked the same as it did before, but he could still see where the glowing cracks had been in his head, their precise lengths and curvatures.
it was fun. Victorian London was a shiny new toy to play with. It had new places to see, new people to kill, new items to steal…but you know something, Sherlock? Things never change…” Jim’s voice rose and he paced to the window. “
John rolled his eyes. “There are loads of crimes out there. Every day we get people into the hospital, bloodied up from muggers, and I’m always seeing pickpockets. Just yesterday a bank was robbed! Or are all of those too
—for you, only to find out you had gone and let yourself get shot—I would’ve dug you up and killed you all over again.”
come until I tell you to.”
Jim crossed to the door to knock, but Hamish had already poked his head out at the sound of voices. Jim gave John a meaningful look as Hamish ran to give his dad a hug.
After a minute longer, Sherlock stuttered. “St-Stop!”
“Yes, I saw,” he said testily.
Sherlock played a final note before dropping the violin from his shoulder. “Do you really want to learn?”
“ Good…because I’m not going to just stop being myself because you think I’m a ‘dick.’”
century as home, since he would never see it again, and subconsciously pulled John closer, glad that he wasn’t alone. He studied John, whose eyes were now fixed off into some vague spot in the distance.
John shook his head.
“A couple times—in the army, but never…never like that.”
“Goodness, do be careful!” Doyle said, catching Hamish, who quickly regained his balance and backed away. “Sorry—I didn’t mean to…”
“Good! I’m going home. Come back when you’re through being an insufferable raincloud,” John countered, then headed for home, now in a stormy mood himself.
"Well, he was positively fawning over you," John grumbled. "Shameless!"
Sherlock snatched up the paper, hungrily reading through the article, an expression of annoyance creeping onto his face the more he reads. Finally he drops the paper back onto the pile. “Drabble, all of it. I see the quality of journalism hasn’t changed…from Liverpool,” he amended hastily. “I’m going out tonight.”
At first John had suggested they just find another a scan of a patient with an aneurysm and change the name on the chart, but Sherlock had insisted on having his brain scanned and superseding another scanned image of an aneurysm onto it, on the basis that “Mycroft would know” if the scanned brain wasn’t his. John hadn’t asked questions.
. What do you think
John tried, he did. He clenched his wrists above his head, trying best not to move, but now Sherlock’s lips were trailing down his chest, his tongue flicking at his nipples, and his hands were slowly peeling off John’s pants, freeing his erection.
The Doctor rang the bell of 221B Baker Street, and a young woman answered the door. She took in the strangely-clad men. “May I help you gentlemen with someone?”
have given him the impression that if he doesn’t do what I say, I will kill you…
“The average person can only go without blinking for an average of one minute,” Sherlock said, unbuttoning his shirt and hanging it back up.
"It's not. This is all me. It's not such a bad existence, you'd be surprised." She looked adoringly at Elton. "And I have him."
“Doctor, when will we see you again?”
“We’d become a cold case,” Sherlock mused, as if reading John’s thoughts. He let out a long sigh and finally said, “It might be the most logical thing to…say goodbyes now. Just to be on the safe side.”
“You’re insane,” John gasped as Jim collapsed next to him. He was quivering all over. That had been one of the most terrifying experiences of John’s life, but he’d had the most mind-blowing orgasm along with it. It disturbed him to think that Jim had given it to him,
find a wife soon. I hardly can blame you for entertaining the idea.”
“London in 1895!” The Doctor crowed as the TARDIS lurched to a halt. “Full of mystery, you’ll love it! The gas lamps, the opium dens, the aristocracy and the beggar class, all mingling together with pickpockets, murderers, secret societies, crimes galore! …all we have to do is see if we can track down Mr. Doyle.”
Jim’s grin was slow-spreading, and he took a step towards John, then another and another, forcing John’s back against the wall. His hand darted to John’s throat and slammed him hard against the wall, his face devilish.
“Can we meet? I have some questions.”
John grabbed Sherlock’s hand as he strode over to the map to scope the exhibits. “Which room d’you reckon has the fewest people?”
He wavered unsteadily on his knees, still gripping John, then slowly pulled out of him. John collapsed onto his stomach, catching his breath. He rolled over, wincing a bit. “Oh my God…”
?” He corrected, then unhooked the scarf from his shoulders and leaned forward to give John a slow kiss, teasing John’s mouth open with his tongue.
younger than us. But…”
The Doctor looked up at central TARDIS column fondly, rubbing his hands together. “So, dear, what do you think? New passengers?” He ran around the console and began flipping switches. “Hang on to something! Next stop: 1895!”
Did he? Sherlock had long prided himself of eradicating any detrimental sentiment but over the past few years, John had burrowed persistently into Sherlock’s heart. It would be illogical to deny that he cared for John. That much was evident. But romantic feelings?
“Ohh, there are some things humans aren’t ready for. Spoilers, to quote a friend of mine.” The Doctor smiled and stood up, and Sherlock rose to join him, forcing himself to be satisfied with this non-answer. The three began walking back towards the console room.
Mrs. Hudson looked between the three of them, then turned to the doorway and popped out, saying, “I’ll go down and fix you up some cakes.”
“Ugh. Sounds unbearable,” Sherlock grimaced. “Still, it’s likely our best bet. I’ll need you to fake a scan. Mycroft will want evidence. Think you can get us into an MRI room?”
“And where the HELL have
John tormented him for a bit, trailing his tongue lightly up and down the veins and moving his hand up to fondle his balls, giving them a quick squeeze.
There was another possibility of course, one that John dreaded to think about. “I will slit your son’s throat,” Jim had growled in John’s ear. He shuddered. His sleep had been plagued by nightmares about Hamish. The dreams were mostly all the same. John would hear Hamish scream, and he’d run through what felt like glue to get to him. Sometimes the location varied. The ending never did. He always arrived too late, finding Hamish dead and bloody on the ground.
“Now, if you could.” Sherlock gave him the date and time. “I know it’s late, but there’s a café across the road that’s open.”
“I don’t know…it would seem an impossibility, if we hadn’t been in 1895 an hour ago.” He checked the time on his phone. “…More than. The Doctor should be back by now.” He drummed his fingers on his chair for a moment, then lept up. “To hell with waiting for him! Since when do I need
Mary laughed and pushed Hamish’s curls from his eyes. “No worms tonight, love. I’m making your favorite. Steak and kidney pie.”
Jim lowered the gun slightly, genuinely confused. “Hamish is missing?”
John leaned down to give Hamish a tight hug. “That professor Moriarty? I don’t care how nice he seems.
why I keep you around.”
? Honestly, you sound like you’re a Londoner, but it’s as if you three dropped out of the sky! Pass the gravy, if you could.”
Jack set his coffee down and his smile dropped away. “You listen to me. If the Doctor tells you to do something, you do it. He always has everyone’s best interest in mind.”
“Are we doing the right thing?” John whispered to Sherlock as they waited. “I mean, he
He could hear Sherlock sitting across from him, and he could smell the cumin and tea quite strongly now. “I hope you’re not going to drink that,” John said from behind the paper.
cheer you up?”
"Who is this, and why don't I already know you? Anyone with a baritone voice that sexy is definitely worth knowing."
Sherlock couldn't help but smirk a bit at this. "Both in the chest cavity?"
He reached up and undid the belt nearest to him, letting John undo the other. John let his arms drop for a second, exhausted, then finally untied the scarf and cleaned off his stomach, tossing it to the floor. He rubbed his raw wrists and closed his eyes until he had regained his breath enough to say, “You—you did a number on me there…” He laughed tiredly, then examined one of his wrists, sucking on a very raw part where the buckle had rubbed against his skin.
Jim drew back, mock surprise on his face, his mouth forming an “O.” “That sounded like a
John couldn’t even meet Sherlock’s eyes now, and after a moment’s hesistation he awkwardly lowered himself to his knees on the pavement, feeling like a complete fool.
Sherlock quirked a half smile, then handed Urusla back over to Elton and rubbed his hands together. "What can you tell me about the police box? Is it is his? How does he move it around?"
“We’ll be down in a few minutes,” Sherlock said.
century, I had assumed you and Dr. Watson both would be out of place, clearly not for that time. That was not the case.”
London still? But the cab curtains were drawn, so he sat back in the seat and looked at Jim, keeping his sorrow hidden behind a neutral mask.
Mrs. Hudson turned to look at him in alarm. “Why, what’s the matter, dear?”
Sherlock grinned a bit, recognizing the narrowed-eyed, calculating look the boy was giving them now. Obviously he had put together a few observations. Clever lad. John blushed furiously, turning to the nearest glass case to check his reflection. What had given him away?
“Won’t we stick out? Our clothes aren’t exactly…accurate,” John pointed out, hurrying to keep up.
“Oh, God, that’s right, we’re back to Imperial system,” John groaned. “I think I had to learn about that in primary school. What is it, 21 shillings to a guinea?”
your father, and he does
“But we didn’t come here to talk about John, did we?” Magnussen stepped over John’s toward Sherlock. “Let me show you where I keep my files…” He said to Sherlock, guiding him inside, leaving John still bound, gagged, and panting on the terrace.
“Sherlock, I can’t, I don’t want to go—“
“Yeah, me too. Technology, that is. Not so much the bombs or the Westwood.” John missed, funnily enough, jumpers. They certainly existed in 1895, but he’d never seen anyone wearing one. Jumpers must be homemade things wives made for their husbands. Maybe it was a rural fashion. He was surprised to feel his mouth twitching up. It had been a while since he’d thought about something that didn’t involve death or crime or how much he missed Sherlock and Hamish.
Hamish stepped forward. “You’re a
Jim kissed John back, pushing his head back onto the pillow. He pinned John’s arms and shoved his tongue into John’s mouth. John gave a small moan in surprise. “…Good morning,” he murmured.
The two disappeared into the kitchen, and John approached Sherlock and murmured, “Do you think she saw us?”
How does James Junior sound to you?”
“I was…a mistake?” Hamish asked.
He rocked Hamish back and forth in his embrace, feeling worse than when Sherlock had “died.” That had been a cold, empty space, and this was a hot burning thing that consumed his insides, rage with no viable outlet.
Magnussen gave a light giggle. “See, I love this. He doesn’t know what’s coming next, and he is wrestling with how he feels about it. You can see, can’t you? How his little brain is struggling with it all?”
John pushed his fingers further inside, carefully, then let them rest there for a moment. “Are you all right? We don’t have to do this. I don’t want to hurt you.”
John eyed Sherlock suspiciously, who was smiling in amusement.
John shoved him lightly, mock-offended. “I’m not
"Aliens. Time travel. This is mad. This is absolutely mad," John said.

"It's his time machine, don't you know? That's how he travels around!"
“Thank you, Mary. I’m amazed you managed to pull something like that together on our tight budget.” John had reduced the shopping budget and had cut other corners to save up for Sherlock’s violin, but Sherlock hadn’t noticed or minded the potato and cabbage-centric dinners of late.
“Oh-“ John’s breath caught as he realized how fucked it up was that he still defaulted to subservience, then he pushed aside the thought and laughed. “All right!” He slid his tongue up to Sherlock’s navel and kissed just above it before sitting up. He was halfway in the process of making Sherlock roll over when he changed his mind, steering him so that he was lying on his back once more. He slid off Sherlock’s trousers completely, then stood on his knees to shakily remove his own.
Tears were pouring from Hamish’s eyes as he searched John’s face. “Are you sure, Dad? How d’you know it’s not a trick? How d’you know he isn’t faking it, like last time?”
remember…Professor Moriarty is
“Molly, she called, and I—“ John stared at him in a daze, fumbling for the things he wanted to articulate. He wanted to say that the past month had been miserable, that he wanted back in, that he wanted Sherlock in his life in whatever way it took. He wanted more than anything to say that he loved him, that he loved him more deeply than he’d thought it possible to love anyone. “I—I um…” John’s words were tangled and refused to come out. He finally mumbled, “Oh, sod it all,” and, in a swift movement, stepped forward, grabbed Sherlock’s neck, and pulled him down to kiss him.
Elton welcomed them inside and led them to the kitchen, chattering the whole way. "I was really surprised when you called—the LINDA page hasn't had any hits in ages. I've considered taking it down, but I thought it would be better to leave it up so people would know what can happen when you go out looking for the Doctor. He's wonderful, of course he is, but I think he's almost too…big for humans to be around. His life is too dangerous…did you watch my vlogs?"
flat—Hamish was waiting.
John’s heart leaped. This was his chance. He could take Hamish and leave! But Moriarty’s men might think it was him. Was it worth the risk? John suddenly had vivid images of returning home with Hamish only to discover that Sherlock had already been killed. Or heading off to the school and finding that Hamish had been killed. His stomach lurched.
Jim spun towards John, grabbed his shoulders and slammed him against the outside of the building. “You
” Jim was cackling like a madman now, frotting against John and running his hands all over John’s body.
“The hired help,
“Goodbye, Jim,” Sherlock said cold, then turned away, spinning John with him and towing how toward the door, where Hamish was waiting.
There was a pause in the conversation. Sherlock strained his ear against the door, but no voice emerged for several moments.
He grinnd and rubbed his hands together, approaching Sherlock and John as if they were celebrities. "Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson! I had to come find you and ask: Why aren't you in 1895 where you belong?"
Sherlock raised an eyebrow to Molly’s question. “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you. This time I won’t be coming back—neither of us will. We will, for all intents and purposes, be dead.”
But at nights, alone in bed, thoughts of Sherlock would return, either in bad dreams or those dark, quiet spaces before and after sleep, and it was all John could do to keep from breaking down. He maintained his stoic demeanor outside, but inside it felt like Moriarty was already breaking him down, piece by piece.
Sherlock dropped his arm and threw the gun to the floor. His gray eyes stared down at Moriarty’s dead body and finally met John’s. He was blinking as if he, too, couldn’t believe his eyes. “John...?”
Sherlock stalked into the room, slamming the door. He was fuming as he looked at John. “If you’d like your eccentric flatmate to move out so the happy couple can continue in peace, let me know,” he said, his voice venomous.
The small, strange family gathered together in front of the crackling fire as Hamish recounted his unusual history and creation, Sherlock leaning over John’s chair to wrap his arms around his shoulders from behind, Hamish nestled in his lap.
The Doctor shook his head. “Your flat is a museum because it, and you, are famous. Everyone loves Sherlock Holmes!”
Craig looked between them. “You
"He's a very lucid man, and well-to-do,
“Yeah, by about two months,” John said, disbelieving. He’d almost forgotten about the Doctor.
Sherlock turned to Hamish. “The only one who can see is
“It got dirty. You were always complaining about it anyway.”
"Oh, I wouldn't say nothing, John," Sherlock said calmly.
“Stop it,” Sherlock snapped.
“You threatened him?” Sherlock stepped closer to Jim.
“What’s he on about?” John muttered, leaning towards Sherlock.
John hefted the rug and body through the back door. He had already arranged for accomplices to dispose of the body. He met them in the alleyway, paid them their sum, then returned to the kitchen.
Sherlock leaned down until their noses were just barely touching. “I don’t recall telling you that you could touch,” he breathed.
John’s mind flickered to Jane, the housekeeper. He jumped from the chair and went to the kitchen, where she was busy chopping vegetables.
"That's good, John, very very good!" Sherlock clapped excitedly and stood up. This was one of the slowest-moving cases he'd had in a long while, but it they were getting closer, ever so slowly, to uncovering who the Doctor really was.
“I’ll tell my dreams to piss off, then,” John muttered.
proving it?” Sherlock took another step towards him.
“You know, John, someone of your stature shouldn’t have three pints in less than an hour.”
“Charlotte, then, she’s one of the missing people?”
he was good at what he did.
“It’s hard to explain. Some outside force could make us leave for good,” John said.
, let alone a ten year old child.”
“Nothing specific,” John said.
Sherlock swelled with pride, but raised an eyebrow at his son. “Is he right- or left-handed?”
When they returned home a few days later, Mary was at the door, astonished at the hardened soldier who rushed to give her a hug. In their flat—John savored the space—221B,
John slipped his hands behind Sherlock’s coat and grabbed at his bum, pulling him closer. “Just realized…there are probably security cameras in here,” he muttered.
John touched Hamish’s shoulder. “Tracking alleyway slashers is hardly suitable activity for an eight-year-old.”
John tightened his grip on the suit lapels and stared into Jim’s soulless eyes. He had never felt such loathing for the man. “I could kill you right here, you know. I don’t need a gun, and there’s nobody here to see me. Now. Where. Is. My. Son?”
John eyed Jim’s desk and grabbed two more bottles, running to the front door. Jim stumbled after him desperately trying to grab at them. “
"Which name?"
Sherlock ran his fingers over his own name printed on the cover, frowning at the absurd illustration of a gaunt man with a pipe and a deerstalker hat. “Beekeeping?” he muttered distractedly, then began flipping through the pages. “’A Study in Scarlet’…this is just like—look, John, Irene Adler—“ he passed the book to John. “
“I love you John,” Sherlock whispered, then leaned back onto the bed, pulling John on top of him, still kissing.
“Hamish, go to our room,” Sherlock whispered “It’ll take far too long to explain you to our landlady.”
Sherlock ground his teeth and bored his cold gray eyes into John’s before saying coolly, “I didn’t realize I was such a burden to you. Don’t worry, I’ll be gone by the time Mary comes back to prepare dinner.” He headed for the bedroom, fully intending on packing up. If John didn’t want him anymore, he wasn’t about to stick around.
“What—what did he mean?” John finally asked.
“Because it’s a
John cried out at the feeling, shocked and disgusted at having Jim’s semen inside of him. Jim was either too exhausted to notice that John hadn’t come, or maybe he just didn’t care. He collapsed on the bed next to John limply. John collapsed as well, wanting nothing more than to take a shower and then to disappear into nothing, but he had no shower, so he forced himself to lie next to Jim. He even went so far as to wipe a bead of sweat from Jim’s forehead as Jim caught his breath.
Doyle frowned down at Hamish and his odd clothing, skeptical of the boy’s reading ability, but tickled that he was taking an interest in his passion. “I’ve written some adventure stories and some histories.”
John opened his eyes groggily and found himself slumped over in the seat of a hansom cab. Moriarty watched him from the seat across. “Welcome to the beginning of a whole new life, Johnny,” Jim said, brushing his knees against John’s.
“Yeah, cheers for that. It was good thinking,” John said. “But I might be unemployed if they find out I took an MRI for kicks. MRIs are rather expensive. But you know what?” He stopped, looking around the street. “I don’t really care. I feel like I have a terminal illness myself. Like I’ve stopped caring what other people think.”
John cast Hamish such a stern and desperate look that Hamish closed his mouth and obeyed.
“We are, as of now, unemployed. We’ve just moved to the city, but we hope to have jobs soon.”
…mm, sends shivers down my spine!”
, Mycroft.
it. Deep down…it’s so much better than being the glorified sniffer-dog of an ungrateful detective.”
“Yeah, but their friend who gave me to them says my dads’ll come back for me some day soon. It’s all a load of rubbish, of course. People can’t have two
Sherlock burst into laughter himself, unable to contain all the confusion. They were both too overwhelmed to say anything coherent until the Doctor returned with a battered copy of
John waited with his pistol tucked in the back of his jacket. When O’Seanassy arrived home, John asked him to take a look at some strange papers he had found in the study. When they entered, John let O’Seanassy go first, wasting no time in shooting him in the back of the head before he could turn around.
And here you are, it’s really you.  But you don’t...make sense.”
“Sherlock, you’re being ridiculous! This isn’t even up for discussion. I’m not some fickle berk who’s going to run off with someone else, so stop being such a self-pitying mope.”
“Look at the publication date…this one’s a reprint from the 1960s!
“I’m Mary,” the maid said, meeting John’s eye. Sherlock looked over. She appeared to be roughly five years young than him, although it was evident she’d been a maid for all of her adult life. She had already been married, and quite recently, it would seem, as there was the faintest hint of a ring’s tan line on her left hand. A widow, then.
Hamish bounced up and down. “Wrong! You’re wrong! It was Colonel Mustard in the kitchen with the candlestick!”
All three squeezed their eyes shut at the same time.
“Jane, do you have a mop I could use?” John asked, glancing at the small smear of blood that had leaked through the rug onto the kitchen floor.
It was a very sulky ride back to Baker Street. Hamish was angry and glum the rest of the week. John and Sherlock pulled him out of the school and enrolled him in a less prestigious school closer to Westminster, where he could come home every day.
keep promises, John.”
John gives him another kiss, lingering, almost reverent, before sliding his lips down and brushing them over Sherlock’s skin as he crawled down the bed toward Sherlock’s cock, his lips finally meeting it to slowly lick up its length.
little writer friend, could be offed next if you persist. Also, know that if I hear that you’re not behaving, I’ll kill John and send you his face in the post. I don’t
“Listing them all would be a tedious process for both of us, John. Remember, on that first day, I asked you…”
John pulled Sherlock into a kiss, glad for the privacy of their flat. “Be careful. I wish I had my service revolver.”
“Of course. I imagine he’s in Cork by now, or en route. Do you trust me to make the trip, sir?”
“Your father is…dead.”
“Could Mycroft help?”
“We’ll be learning together, I suppose,” Sherlock said, moving to his knees in front of Hamish.
They wandered in confusion down the street, past residential areas to a street with more shops, finally finding a menswear store. Once inside, they quickly learned that most suits were tailored on request. When they explained that it was an emergency, the tailor frowned and took John’s measurements, disappearing into the back and appearing with a suit that he thought might be a close match.
Sherlock gave him a sad smile. “Right.” He cleared his coat pockets of his keys, wallet, and phone, which would be useless in 1895, and stashed his magnifying glass, whatever food would fit in his pockets, and an antique telescope he might be able to hawk for some money.
That was a sobering thought. If he and Sherlock disappeared, there would be no closure, no explanation. At least with death there was finality, there was closure. When people disappeared, there was that constant feeling of waiting, of uncertainty. There were few people that John was close to, but he would hate to put those he was close to through that.
“You’ve been doing well with the patches,” John reminded him.
If it had been on behalf of anyone else, John would’ve walked away and left her in peace, but this was
John felt a hand brushing through his hair, then he slumped into the sofa, giving in to unconsciousness.
Jack leaned in and looked around the mostly-deserted café. "Do you know what happens when a human absorbs Huon energy from the heart of the TARDIS?" He took in their blank looks. " Of course you don't, from what you've said, you don't even know what the TARDIS is yet. Long story short, I died and I was brought back to life and now I can't die. I can't. I mean, I've been killed a bunch of times and I'll come right back." He smiled sadly. "I'll outlive the Doctor. And he's seen a lot of years."
dads. That’s not how biology works,” he added confidentially, looking very proud that he knew this.
John fell into silence and found himself wanting to know everything about Hamish. Whether he plays football like John had, or whether he sat inside with a microscope during recess like Sherlock must have done. He wanted to see the boy’s room. What did he keep on his bookshelves? What sorts of things did he draw? He couldn’t help hoping, against all odds, that Hamish was actually somehow their son.
John moved out a couple weeks later and settled into a tiny flat in Islington, feeling much as he did when he came home from the war: alone and alienated. He abandoned his blog and picked up any extra shifts he could at the clinic, beginning to work fifty, sometimes sixty hours a week, despite the fact that he didn’t really care about the extra money. He checked his phone every day, just in case Sherlock needed him for a case, but there was never any terse message signed “SH” in his inbox.
Jane gave a short “Oh!”, then there was a brief silence before she called out, “S-sorry Mr. Moriarty, Dr. Watson—” She peeked around the corner. “J-just dropped a platter, is all.” She disappeared and John buried his head in his book once more.
A smile tugged at the corner of Sherlock's mouth as he looked around the room. He had noticed some of the candles had gone missing. “Hello.”
.” Before he realized what he was doing, Sherlock was holding Mary, sobbing on her shoulder. Mary grabbed him back, crying as well, sharing his relief and sorrow and moved by his rare display of emotion. “I know sir—I know!”
Magnussen ignored him, beginning to rub between John’s legs carefully and deliberately. “You see how he struggles with it? That’s the best part,” he said, watching John’s face earnestly.
At that moment, their door burst open and Mary stepped in anxiously.

One morning John went to grab a mug from the cabinet and stared at a bag of dehydrated mice. “Nice addition to the teacups in there, Sherlock, the shriveled mice. Is there a vampire cat that I should be worried about?”
“I don’t think we’ve seen the last of them, John,” Sherlock said. “The Doctor rattled on about holes in the pockets. He was set on sending us back. It seems—inevitable. The only good thing that I can see from all of this is that it would seem that even if someone is sent back, this world continues as is. It doesn’t pivot specifically around the existence of any specific being. If we get winked out of existence, at least that doesn’t mean there will be some sort of apocalypse here. Everyone will just keep on living. We’ll just be gone.”
“We’re in a-a
Sherlock focused his eyes on her with mild difficulty. His voice dripped sarcasm. “And what
“Well that depends, John…I don’t like to just…
“Probably.” But Molly didn’t move. She stood her ground and watched him. “You don’t look fine, Sherlock. You’re obviously
John raked his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, a bit forcefully. “You never gave me any sign!”
John shuddered as Magnussen’s fingertips trailed down his face, and Magnussen laughed lightly, his fingers trailing down John’s body, lower and lower.
Sherlock unsteadily crawled next to him and collapsed as well, unable to speak. John searched Sherlock’s eyes, then touched his arm, as if to make sure Sherlock was really there. He looked him up and down. Sherlock, naked, next to him in bed. This was really happening. “Had you ever…with a man?”
John impatiently grabbed the mug. He didn’t feel as if they’d resolved the conversation quite in the way he wanted, but he had gotten his point across, at the very least. John slid the mug across the counter to Sherlock a bit too vigorously. Sherlock fumbled to catch it a second too late and it tipped and spilled down his shirt.
I would like to have some predictability. Sherlock…
John sent it off as soon as he could, then eagerly awaited the next one. The postal service was excruciatingly slow, but soon he and Sherlock had a steady correspondence.
A preoccupied, blonde-haired man opened the door. “Mary, I told you, no callers, not while I’m writing.”
want me!” Jim’s voice was rising to a manic level now as he seized John legs and shoved them up on Jim’s shoulders, pushing John’s knees against his chest and leaning down to hover his face above John’s, grinning at his tortured expression.
Sherlock wondered where this rant from John was coming from. Had he been bottling this all up for a long time? Sherlock had several suspicions about John, but he’d never brought them to light for long, in fear that it would put a strain on their friendship, which he deeply valued.
“Mm, I lucked out, then,” John said, stretching. He felt exhausted. Too much had happened in the last 48 hours.
“Yes,” he whispered, forcing himself to keep his eyes level with Jim. Could Jim see the terror there? He had to.
Once inside, Jim led John up the stairs and pushed open a door to a large furnished bedroom. “That’s yours for tonight. Hamish is across the hall.”
“You said yourself, you’re not that drunk.”
Jim rolled his eyes. “You’re no fun at all. You don’t like puzzles like Sherlock. Straight to business, aren’t you, Doctor Watson?” Jim’s eyes glinted before he sighed and examined his nails. “To answer your question, Hamish it at school. Right where he should be.”
?” Sherock opened his mouth to repeat the question, but John hurriedly said, “No, no…don’t.” He forced a laugh. “No! No. What…why do you…uhh…” John clenched his eyes shut for a moment, then looked at the carpet. “What made you think that?”
Mary came back upstairs, empty-handed. “I explained your situation to Mr. Doyle, and he’s invited you all to join him for supper.
Sherlock sidled up beside him ad hissed quietly, “Are you sure you wouldn’t rather stay here chatting up Mary?”
The next day, John and Sherlock had snuck their way into the MRI room at St. Bart’s, locking the door behind them.
After John buried his bitterness about Jack's blatant flirting with Sherlock and Sherlock's ambiguity towards it all, he tried once again to wrap his head around all the information that had been thrust into his brain over the past few hours and weeks.
"Duncan could just be senile," John said. It seemed to John the most likely solution. Not elaborate or exciting, perhaps, but plausible. "Or maybe he has a faulty memory."
John stepped toward him and wrapped his arms around him. “You didn’t lose me.” He sighed into Sherlock’s shoulder. He was exhausted. He felt like he hadn’t slept in days, and the fatigue of paranoia felt much worse now that that blissful moment of temporary relief had vanished. “Will this ever be over? I’m so tired of running.”
“What do you mean 1895 is right around the corner?”
“Inspector Gregson’s here. The British Museum’s been robbed! They want you to have a look.”
John tried not to shiver as he stared into Jim's eyes, which had dilated even wider than usual, the pupils eating the irises and making them appear pure black. It was now or never. He would do it for Sherlock, John told himself. Anything to see Sherlock again.
Not satisfied, Mary walked over to him. “What are your favorite dishes, Mr. Holmes? I’d happily prepare them if you gave me the chance. It’s just that…not many people turn up my cooking like you do, and I’m here to make you happy.”
Hamish broke into sobs and Sherlock hugged them both, together for the first time in almost fourteen months, pressing his cheek against Hamish's head. “We're here, we're here now.”
“You’re going to be a much better father than I will,” Sherlock said as they went into their own bedroom.
Sherlock clenched his jaw, then rose. “Goodbye, Jack.” He turned his coat collar up and headed back to the flat. He and John would have to go back to Baker Street tomorrow and come up with a new plan, since their time-traveling intergalactic acquaintances were being no help at all.
He felt Jim climb to his knees behind him and grab John’s hips. “Well, this certainly was a surprise, Johnny-Boy.” Without warning he pushed himself in. John was unable to hold back a shout of pain. It had been months since he’d last had sex, and it hurt even more than he’d anticipated. He clenched his eyes shut and dug his hands into the sheets.
John rolled his eyes. “Great logic, boss.” Jim was too drug-addled to do anything to him at the moment. He settled onto the floor.
“I suppose you’ll be wanting a housekeeper then. I’m glad to provide my services. I’m experienced, and my rates are reasonable. I’m a fine cook, Mr. Doyle says so.”
Mycroft’s eyebrows raised.
are they following us?” John wondered.
John blinked at him, confused, then rose to his feet a bit unsteadily. “Cute. Really cute. You should’ve stayed dead, Moriarty, quit while you were ahead, because this is just pathetic.” He moved toward Jim, ready to seize him up and choke the life out of him, to break every bone in his neck and be rid of him forever.
“Since the Doctor never warned us, I think we can do whatever we damn well please,” Sherlock said.

He tossed it to Sherlock.
“Mmm, and let’s not forget he problematic detail of two men raising a child in the 1890s. A child have ‘two daddies’ turns heads in 2012,” Sherlock pointed out.
to the edge!”
“That’s it, then,” Sherlock murmured. “You take your eyes away, you blink—then they take you. Make you vanish.”
“Now that’s better, isn’t it? Comfortable? You’re not going to kill me, John. I’m sure you
"Is there anything else you can tell us, or are you going to stand here and flirt the rest of the afternoon?" he snapped.
Marlene eyed him a bit suspiciously, but retrieved the file all the same. “Bring it back as soon as you’re finished.”
“Hardly…I didn’t have any reason to.”
“A police call box? Aren’t those all torn down now?” John asked.
"I need to go there. Where is it?"
Sherlock was far from gleeful at facing the Doctor again—all of his past run-ins seemed to end up with enormous upheavals—but he was dying for answers to questions only the Doctor could give him.
“And he already has a doctor looking out for him,” John pointed out.
Mycroft narrowed his eyes, nodding, and studied his brother’s face. “Those scans John showed me were fake. Obviously. I’m assuming that you have constructed this lie for a good reason, although why you ever thought I wouldn’t notice is beyond me. So, Sherlock, drop the aneurysm charade. Is this
John slipped inside a changing booth and pulled it on, feeling odd buttoning trousers without a zipper, and even odder as he buttoned the waistcoat and thought about wearing it as part of a daily ensemble. He slipped the coat on, which was a trifle long in the arms but altogether passable, and stepped out for Sherlock’s approval, leaving his modern shoes on, deciding they weren’t horribly futuristic looking.
John began laughing. It was all too absurd. “No! You think I’m just going to come
Mary shook her head. “It’s fine. You’re welcome to join Mr. Doyle in the parlor whenever you’d like. Dinner will be in an hour.” She gave a quick curtsey and headed out the door and down the steps.
John nodded slowly, reaching for his gun. He had never seen this man before, but he looked familiar nonetheless. Then it dawned on him. “Are you an…O’Seanassy?” he asked, but before he could fully finish the question, the man had whirled up and punched John in the face, wrestling the gun away from him and training it on his forehead.
extremely comfortable, probably the most comfortable bed John had ever been in, but just as he was beginning to drift off, Jim turned over to whisper, “If you snore, I’ll stab you.”
Jim gave John a disgusted look before rolling forward and getting to his feet, breathing hard. He dropped onto one of the sofas and glared across the room, arms crossed over his chest, then clawed his fingers through his hair, mussing it from its slicked-back style. “This century is
John met his eye steadily. “You mean to say you don’t find it believable that I want to please you? I
"Sherlock!" He called.
John met his thrusts as they found their rhythm, growing increasingly fast and forceful. It wasn’t going to take him long at all to come, he knew. He tried to hold out as long as he could, but then Sherlock hit his prostate and he nearly lost it.
John let himself be ridden, staring up in breathless wonder as he tried to think of anything more hot than Sherlock at this moment, impaling himself on John, his face screwed up in utter pleasure. John clenched his hands into fists and cursed the gag—he wasn’t going to be able to hold on much longer.
“I need a break,” Sherlock said. “This is—“
John found a chink of hope. Of course, Sherlock would come and find Hamish and him, even if John wasn’t able to run away. “Sherlock will find us. He always does.”
“He’ll never miss it! I’ll not have you starve. It would hardly be Christian of me to do any different,” she insisted, then hurried downstairs.
“I was just reading some
“Well, you’re an idiot, John, because that’s not going to happen,” Sherlock said dismissively.
John tensed up at the sound of his name on this strange man’s lips and picked up his pace, aiming for the thicker cluster of people ahead. “I don’t think that’s any of your business, mate,” he muttered and pushed into the crowd, hoping to lose him.
.” John's voice was a hollow monotone. “I don’t care anymore, Jim…just tell me what happened and I’ll go peacefully. Fucking give me the gun and I’ll do the job for you. Just
John moaned and twitched, then whimpered in torment as Sherlock ran his tongue along the length of John’s cock.
“Sherlock Holmes, Dr. John Watson, and this is Hamish.”
They fell onto Sherlock’s bed, yanking off each other’s trousers, their legs becoming entangled and their mouths never straying far from each other’s.
John bit down a laugh as Sherlock glared at the boy. “It’s all right, Hamish, your dad’s just a sore loser,” John said, leaning in to whisper, “I beat him every time and he can’t stand it.”
Sherlock stepped over to Mycroft and snatched the book from him, snapping it shut. “Do
“Oh, Sherlock Holmes. Did you honestly think I was gleefully sending you back into the past, wrenching you from the life you knew and loved because it

“They’re obvious enough for the
Sherlock was shocked into obeying, struggling to a sitting position.
“Because you do,” Hamish said over his small steepled fingers. “Are we going to find crimes to solve, Dad?”
“He doesn’t seem too worried about living in a different century,” John said.
John swallowed. Of course he would go back. Even if it drove him crazy.
“Did you bring your medical certificate?”
“I do. Of course, I just…I wish I knew what was going on.”
“Not at all. We’re still growing used to the idea ourselves,” Sherlock said, putting some convincing emotion into his voice. “We’re all Hamish has now, and it’s difficult to make ends meet.”
second name
Sherlock faltered. He knew the logistics of sex, even of gay sex, but he had no idea where to begin. “I’ll follow your lead,” he finally conceded, groping into John’s trousers to feel his hardened cock.
“Would you like to see his room?” Craig asked.
John nodded, unsmilingly meeting Jim’s eyes. “Yes. Body’s taken care of as well.”
Hamish had brought back an invitation that “cordially invited” parents to attend the school over the coming weekend.
“But you get off on it, don’t you? The danger of it all. That’s why you do your job without complaint. You
When Hamish pulled away, he looked at John. “When do we leave?”
Jim released his grip on John’s throat, and John made his way up the stairs, feeling his boss behind him. He was terrified, shaking even. John never shook.
Jim pushed Sherlock off, brushing off his suit and straightening his tie. “Easy there—hand tailored. Bet you weren’t expecting this, were you?” He smiled down at Hamish and tousled his hair. “A
John blinked at him sorrowfully. He wanted desperately to sleep, to wake up and have this all melt away as a strange, terrible dream. “Will I get to say goodbye?” he repeated.
given some rather unfortunate news.”
Sherlock stared at the floor dejectedly. “You need to leave.”

John stared, agape. "That…that is not possible."
“It’s beyond me, it’s a waste of our breath,” Sherlock said, and both men smiled.

“Well, of course. There are four of us,” Doyle frowned.
now. Science equipment is rubbish, though.”
The case had already consumed Sherlock, it was clear. He continued to fervently pace back and forth, tapping his fingers together. "There was another name that I heard, but I can't figure out the significance. My research has turned up nothing."
“It’s hardly your business anyway,” Sherlock muttered.
“I’m glad
“You mean I won’t see you again? Ever? When? When is this going to happen?”
“The ‘Professor’ strikes again! Insufferable con won’t even let his
“Right,” John laughed when Hamish was done and he had let it all sink it. John looked up and back at Sherlock. “Anything else unusual happen today?”
John nodded, not meeting his eye. Of course. Stupid. Jim had thought of everything,
“So find someone better,” he couldn’t help but burst out.
He answered after the fourth ring.
John, unable to believe he was about to share a bed with Jim Moriarty, stood up hesitantly and slid into the bed, keeping close to the edge and watching the back of Jim’s head warily.
“Goodness, you haven’t any
“Mm.” Sherlock tossed on his pyjamas crawled into bed. “Yes, he acclimated much quicker than I expected. The whole thing is inexplicable. I just want answers. The whole boy is a complete mystery, yet I feel I already know him inside and out.”
“Fine then. It’s done. Jim.”
“Why on earth did you need a Bichon Frise?!”
The poor boy—who chose that name? Bet it was you, Johnny.” He grinned at John, who lunged at him.
“You got it? Even without the papers?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock needed a distraction. He pushed up closer to John, sliding John’s coat down his arms and prying John’s mouth open with his tongue, then let it explore along John’s teeth and pushed it against John’s tongue.
John gave a needy moan, and he was mortified when his hips pushed forward into the touch. He was soaking Sherlock's scarf with his saliva, and he bit down on it, vowing not to make another sound.
?!” Sherlock demanded. “
me? I had to save the universe, but I wasn’t about to give up on saving
Sherlock groaned loudly, pushing his hips up, reveling at John’s touch. It had been so long. “God—“ Sherlock clenched his pillow in his fists as his breath hitched.
“We could tell them and still try to avoid the angels. Who knows? I could have a ‘miraculous recovery,’” he snorted. “So, then. Aneurysm would be easiest. They can go off at any time, but they don’t have an expiration date.”
Sherlock grabbed onto John’s shirt and pulled him into the bedroom, kissing him the whole way, refusing to let him go. Once inside, John pulled Sherlock down onto the bed, clawing at his back. Sherlock didn’t waste a moment in grinding his hips against his, then began unbuttoning John’s shirt.
in the first place?”
“But what makes you think you can keep
Sherlock murmured into John’s mouth, “Oh, shut up. As if you haven’t been a complete flirt. Proper Victorian housemaids don’t kiss their employers without some form of approval. You’ve been leading her on since you got here.” He ran his fingers through John’s hair, pausing to kiss him more deeply, then mumbled, “Idiot…”
much more fun…
Sherlock’s mouth twitched up for a moment. “Of course, let me get my coat.”
“It’s not a think like what I do,” Sherlock muttered. “As you’ll quickly learn if you delve into detective work.” He glanced at the time on his phone. “It’s nearly nine. Isn’t that a normal bedtime for a nine year old?”

Once in the bedroom, Jim slammed the door shut and began pulling off his tie.
Hamish shook his head excitedly and Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “The 9
Hamish came downstairs to find John and Sherlock pulling on their coats. “Why’re you putting on your coats?”
He struggled to meet Jim's light, conversational tone as he lied, “I went the pub for a drink or two with the lads, had a bit of a walk.”
Hamish dropped his eyes. “I know you’re busy, and that I’m only here on weekends.”
John smiled. “It’s easy….I think. Just follow my lead.”
“Where’s a fucking phone when you need one?” he growled. “I need to yell at someone and I
Sherlock shook his head. “
He leaned forward and whispered in his ear, “Let's see if we can't make this a little harder...”
“I know! But there was last week. Came out of nowhere, it did. And disappeared just as suddenly! I went back a few hours later and it was gone.”
John paced to the window and saw a gay couple holding hands. He got an idea; a stupid one, but it was silly enough that it would distract them for a bit. “Remember how we talked about missing public tolerance to same-sex relationships? Don’t you think we should take advantage of that tolerance while we can?”
Sherlock pulled him close and kissed him again, and murmured into his mouth, “Always.
“Grandpa Wilfred!” Hamish said. “I still visit him! And Aunt Donna—she’s so funny. Then after that I went to live with the Williams’.”
want to please you. However much I hate my situation, I’ve accepted that it’s not going to change. If I can do good work for you and keep you happy, then we’ll both benefit, I figure. And I’m also… I’m lonely.” The last part wasn't a lie at all, John realized.
Jim used his free hand to shove one of John’s legs farther up, angling himself so he could hit John’s prostate every time, overwhelming him with pleasure. John was riding toward one of the most intense orgasms of his life.
Sherlock was beginning to smile wider now, and John rolled his eyes. "Here we go…"
“If you want to make yourself useful, go to the kitchen and order us some dinner.”
everything. Like Sherlock.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at her word choice, full well that Mary knew they were more than friends, but he didn’t press the subject. If Mary chose to share the information with anyone, it could ruin them.
don’t even know how I would start to go about bringing me down…I am
John laughed a bit regretfully, the reality of what was to come hitting him anew. “Right. I don’t imagine Victorians would respond too kindly to two naked, sexed-up men randomly appearing in the street.” He rolled over and groaned at his clothes, which were crumpled and sprawled across the room. “Getting dressed requires moving, doesn’t it?”
“His characteristics match us perfectly, John,” Sherlock whispered. “What do we do?”
“You can’t be serious,” John said, stepping over and snatching the bottle away. “Jim. This is childish.”
“Not long after Hamish was born.”

“Oh, they don’t care about
John began to weep too, unsure if it was his son’s tears or his own worries that he might never see Sherlock again that sent him over the edge. “Hamish, he’s gone—all right? He’s gone.” He pulled Hamish to him and hugged him tight, sobbing now. Sherlock really was gone. Not dead, but gone all the same. “And I don’t know what’s going to happen to us now. Just please,
That night, Jim fucked John to make up for lost time, and the whole time John thought the same thing over and over: Sherlock had his letter. Sherlock knew he was alive and safe. Well, alive anyway.

Craig, nodded, confused, then sat down on the sofa, setting Alfie on the floor.
“Just pretend like you belong! That’s what I do. Works every time! Well, 9 times out of ten. …Maybe 7.”
“I'm saying, boss, that I would offer up whatever made you happy, and that if what makes you happy pleases me as well, then so much the better.”
Jim clucked his tongue. “Ohh, Johnny-Boy...what makes you think you could ever stop me? Hamish and I are rather good friends, aren’t we?” He smiled, snake-like, down at the boy.
Sherlock wrapped his arm around John, and quoted Hamish from earlier. “We match.”
“I didn’t mean to, honestly.” John gave him a light kiss. “I guess I need to turn down my charms. It won’t happen again, and I’m sorry. Satisfied?”
“Mm. Like a bed?”
“Did you explain that Hamish is your son?” John asked, and Sherlock snorted.
Sherlock gave him a disparaging look before they both finally broke down laughing.
“That’s what we’re trying to determine, Craig. Mind if we come in?”
“John’s working, Hamish at school. Obviously. If you insist on the idle chit-chat, I’ll have to toss you out. Don’t bore me.”
They stepped into Hamish’s room. Hamish was waiting in bed, sitting up expectantly. John sat on the edge of the bed, smoothing the covers as Hamish lay down. He tucked the blankets up to his chin and moved a hand over Hamish’s hair. Hamish closed his eyes, looking utterly peaceful. “Goodnight, Hamish. See you in the morning.” John kissed his forehead.
“As entertaining as all of that was, he still broke into our flat and tried to convince us that we ‘belonged’ in a different century.”
“He never told me his name or anything…but I need to know how this is possible. That’s why I’m hiring you,” Duncan finished, swallowing.
John was making his way home from the clinic on foot in the hopes of conserving some money. He was wondering irritably how Victorian Londoners kept their feet at all between the uneven cobblestones and the lack of arch support in their shoes, when a ruddy-faced man began walking in step alongside him. John cast him a worried, sideways glance, expecting a panhandler. The man grinned at him, showing him a multitude of missing and rotten teeth. “Ho, there, Dr. Watson. Where yeh be off to? Baker Street, I’m expectin’?”
people react at death, but people will care. They’ll have questions, they’ll want to stop it.”
John gave his son’s shoulder a squeeze. His eyes wandered from Sherlock to the fire in the grate and the snow out the window. “Yes,” he agreed. “It’s good to be home.”
for that matter, I’m trading myself in for you. He wants
, Dad—either of you!”
“Please
“Well, he’s got your nose. And your earlobes, and your gait…the way your feet turn out when you walk,” Sherlock countered. He thought this over. “It is highly improbable, John, but what if he really is our son?” He had never given the slightest thought to children. “I’m just glad he didn’t have to be raised by us.”
“Mmm,” Sherlock grunted, rolling out of bed and standing unabashedly nude in front of John. He wore his skin like a well-tailored suit, and John couldn’t help admiring him in the late-afternoon light.
Jim tilted his head playfully. “I was just
“What’s going on?”
"Sherlock! There you are- this man's been asking for you- he just let himself in. Showed me his badge- the inspector of—" she turned towards the kitchen. "Sorry, dear, what did you say you were the inspector of?"
“Sorry about that,” he said bashfully, not meeting the doctor’s eye. He turned and jerked a head to the still bent and panting John, indicating him to get going.
He moved slowly, not only to torture John, but to give his muscles time to relax around John. He leaned forward as he grew used to the feeling of John inside him, supporting himself by balancing his palms on John’s chest. He gasped as he angled himself so that John was pressing up against his prostate. It was an entirely new feeling, and his mouth fell open as he hit the spot again, beginning to move a bit faster.
John stayed hunched over, his arms cross tightly across his aching stomach. He had no idea what Moriarty was getting at. “He was your…gunman,” John said warily.
“Have you talked to John recently? Why did he leave?”
“I won’t be,” Sherlock said.
Mary sighed, finally giving up, and bobbed a curtsey. “If there’s anything else you need, I’ll be tending to Mr. Doyle downstairs,” she said, and disappeared.
Craig sat down and pulled Alfie onto his knee, casting a loving eye on his as he began to speak. If he cared for Hamish half as much, John thought, then the boy had been in good hands. That relaxed him somewhat.
“I swear, if you touch a hair on his—“
Sherlock set Hamish back down. “With any luck, I’ll have caught a criminal before the night is out,” he said, then tossed his scarf around his neck and flew out the door and into the dying London light.
Sherlock didn’t answer as he removed his coat, hung it up, and went to his microscope. He didn’t put a slide underneath it, he just stared through at the illuminated white spot underneath. “John…I’m sorry that I…I had thought that you…” He clamped his mouth shut. “I should have believed you.”
Molly blinked. “Is that…supposed to mean something? Something sensible, I mean?”
Sherlock took an involuntary step back. “How—
John closed his eyes, separating himself from the experience. He kept his mind task-oriented, focused on a good performance, trying to keep his emotions folded away somewhere safe. From the way things were going now, he could keep things gentle and low-key.
“Professor Moriarty! What are you doing here?” Hamish looked at him, then back to John. “Where are we? Where’s…” he eyed Jim and remembered to say, “Uncle Sherlock?”
Sherlock paused for a moment while he considered this proposition before finally telling the date and time. "There's a café on Baker Street called Speedy's. Can you meet there?"
Hamish’s eyes widened as John talked, then hopped off the bed and, to both John and Sherlock’s surprise, grabbed them around their waists to hug them.  His voice was muffled he buried his face in Sherlock’s side. “I
“I’m sorry, what term do you prefer Pet? Colleague? Lover?”
“I didn’t fancy going out today. Is any of that blood yours, boss?”
“Do you want me to take care of Cassey, sir? I mean, Jim?”
try and pin this all on me! You spend virtually all day,
“Impossible to say, John,” Sherlock said, never faltering from his music. “But with all that’s happened in the past few months, I think it would be very unwise to rule it out as a possibility.”
“Of my
Jim kept his hand tightened at John’s throat as he began pumping, the roughness from the lack of lube creating a mixture of pain and pleasure.
“I’m thinking a heart condition, but Mycroft would see through that immediately—there’s no history of heart problems in our family. There’s always the possibility of a brain tumor or aneurysm.”
“I wasn’t aware ‘being friendly’ included shoving your tongue down other people’s throats! And don’t you
A security guard strode in. “Are you Hamish Holmes-Watson?”
“1895…” Sherlock repeated, reflectively looking at the color of his ale as he held the glass up to the light. “God, John, we were
Instead, he heard Molly step closer and lower herself to a sitting position. He irritably opened one eye and turned his head toward where she was kneeling to look at him at eye-level.
“I can tonight, if you’d like,” John offered.
our son, but 1895 is going to be a whole new life for us. What we going to do when you’re on a case and I’m treating patients? I don’t imagine we’ll be changing our whole habits just because we’re in the past.”
The Doctor sat across from him and John leaned his back on the mantel, arms folded. “I said before that you two didn’t make sense, that your lives were in the wrong time. I was wrong—sort of. This place that we are now, it’s sort of a pocket in the universe.” Apparently unable to sit, the Doctor rose and began pacing, rattling off, “Like a secret pocket full of histories about to be rewritten. Wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey, and all that.”
Jim’s eyes groggily slid open, then narrowed at John, whose face is only a few inches away from him. “…What.”
Mycroft gave a choked, wet laugh. He was holding back tears as well. “And how’d that work out for you?”
, I’m ruggedly handsome—a ladykiller. Obviously.”
“Ooh, right on the money, Sherlock—“
Sherlock chuckled lowly. “I almost didn’t recognize him at first…if he keeps this up, in a few years, he’ll be taller than
Jim groaned louder, then seized the hair at the sides of John’s hair and yanked his head back and forth, fucking John’s mouth, then shoved John away, shuddering as he came over John’s shoulder.
,” Jim spat. “Do you know what I did to my babysitters, John? Back when I was tender young boy?”
“Hm. We’ll have a great deal of work to do,” Sherlock frowned as John and Hamish stepped in.
“Has it not occurred to you that
“Do you work next Saturday, John?” Sherlock asked, handing over the invitation.
ago!”
John kept struggling, pulling his wrists against the belt, unsure of whether he wanted to get free anymore or not, but finding it felt good to try. He couldn’t stop writhing and bucking against Jim’s every touch. It was an addictive madness, sending hot fury through every particle of John’s being.
“We’ll be fine here,” Sherlock said, unfazed by Molly’s confusion.
“Are there any others?”
John stopped over to the dresser and yanked out his pyjamas. He turned to leave, stopped, then turned back to Sherlock. “Sherlock, be honest- are you
“When was the last time you saw me, Doctor?” Hamish asked.
Mary came in a few minutes later with a piping bowl of soup and another bowl of potatoes. She’d been employed as their housekeeper for several months now, and had learned that Sherlock could be blunt or hurtful or distracted, so she tried her best to stay out of his way. “I hope you like the soup,” she said, knowing there was a sizeable chance that he wouldn’t touch it.
“You mean, die?”
“Sorry—old habits.” He handed Jim his shirt and helped him pull it on—movement in his shoulder was still restricted. “Can I ask why you hate the title…Jim?”
“To Lambeth.”
John watched Jim's back, terrified, until he was sure Jim's even breathing was genuine. He slipped from the bed and limped to the corner chair, trembling. All things considered, he told himself, he had gotten off easy this time. He was alive. Sherlock and Hamish were alive. That was all he could ask for. But the plan—the plan was ruined.
“Good God, do you and Duncan
Sherlock shuddered, clenching his teeth, trying not to cry out, both in pleasure and anticipation. John took him in his mouth, slowly at first, gripping Sherlock’s hips with his hands and stroking the hollow place above his hipbones with his thumbs as he pulled in deeper, sucking and increasing the pressure of his lips.
John pulled away and muttered a string of obscenities after him. “Well, so much for tolerance,” he grumbled, then sighed and caught Sherlock’s eye. “Anywhere else you want to go?”
“Whose son is he? He looks a bit like both of you,” Mary said.
“I love you, John,” Sherlock sighed, pulling John toward him and drifting off easily.
“There’s medication to help with the headaches, but there’s always a risk of clotting, and surgery’s just not an option.” John was finding it extraordinarily difficult to look Mycroft in the eye, but reasoned that if the situation was real, he’d find it hard anyway. “I’m sorry, Mycroft.”
John felt electricity course through him. He opened his mouth a bit wider, meeting the tip of his tongue with Sherlock’s briefly, then finally kissed him more deeply, letting his tongue explore Sherlock’s mouth, inhaling sharply and grabbing Sherlock’s back a bit tighter. As he came up for air, he breathed, “I missed you. So much.”
John sucked in a large breath and sunk into Elton's chair. It was all too much, too crazy.
“Oh. Make them up on the spot, do you?” John snapped. He fuse was far too short today.
“Hamish, would you like a cup of tea, or some cocoa? I’ll fix you some,” John said, moving to the kitchen. He needed something to do to calm his nerves.
The Doctor’s face looked grave, those deep-set eyes in his young face looking very old. “I can’t tell you. I really very sorry. Stay together when the angels come. And—never thought I’d say this—make sure you blink!”
“You’re missing the point! Time simply doesn’t
“What do you want?”
that you took Hamish?” John lolled his head over to look at Moriarty. He felt sluggish and stupid as he watched Jim return to his spot on the sofa and look over at John hungrily.
?” The Doctor looked like he’d just eaten something bitter. “See, this is absurd. You two aren’t supposed to be...
“I’m okay,” John rasped. “I had an accident, but I’ll be fun. How was—“ John stopped to cough and clear his throat. “How was school? I missed you.”
“I hear you’re the best, which is why I came to you. You’re going to tell me I’m crazy…but I swear I’m not.”
“Why don’t you be a good boy and hand over that pistol stowed in your jacket?” Jim asked sweetly.
"Sounds like a good use of time to me…" Jack smiled, then he winked at the waitress clearing up their mostly unused table. "Thanks, beautiful!"
They continued walking, their knuckles brushing against each other’s as their steps synchronized.
"What year am I in? It's 2012. When and where can you meet?"
Mary’s eyes widened as she turned back to Sherlock. “Oh! The one you jumped off a waterfall with?”
Mrs. Hudson was bustling around in their flat.
“Where’s your mum and dad?”
Sherlock rolled the dice. “This is completely unrealistic. This game should at least present you with the possibility that he committed suicide. He can’t be
John gave a muffled moan through the gag, but it was so firmly jammed in his mouth that the sound came out as unintelligible noise. He wrists were already sore; Jim had tied them uncomfortably tight. He was trembling, and despite his horror and discomfort, he realized he was hardening. His fetish for danger had distinct disadvantages.
The doctor and the detective couldn’t help but smile quietly and swell with pride for Hamish.
“Do you know where he is?” Sherlock said, letting go of the railing.
to work on a case? John, Google ‘Arthur Conan Doyle.’”
Sherlock clawed at John’s back and bit at John’s lip, sucking on it. “You can have me, John.” He raked his nails through John’s hair, and as John kissed him back, he yanked on Sherlock’s trousers, sliding his hand inside to grab his erection, massaging along it as he worked down the trousers with his other hand.
“Well said,” the Doctor said with admiration, and Hamish looked up at his Dad with grateful eyes, leaning in on the upholstered sofa to wrap his arms around Sherlock’s middle.
“Mmm, it’s fine,” Sherlock said distractedly, taking a bite of a croissant.
John snapped, “We’re
“God—sorry,” John mumbled, looking for a dishrag.
When Sherlock returned home, John was just sitting down to dinner, and Mary was sitting in Sherlock’s usual spot. John immediately reddened and Mary stood up, embarrassed. “Sorry—I didn’t think you’d be home in time,” John said.
Jim tilted his head back, exposing his prominent Adam’s apple, which John licked and sucked at, then traced his tongue down to the hollow under Jim’s throat, his hands sliding under Jim’s shirt to caress his bare skin.
time a case comes up!”
“What do you intend to do with that?” John asked, although he had a fairly good idea. His heart was pounding.
And what if he wasn’t wrong? John thought, backing up until the backs of his knees hit the couch. “Why…why do you have to prove it? Why can’t you…take my word for it?” His voice grew lower as Sherlock stepped closer.
"Torchwood," John repeated. "What do you think that means?"
It doesn’t matter if you loved me first! I am here
“Hello, Mr. Holmes! I got your number off the website, and thought you could help me. These statues appeared in my house—I didn’t have them ordered or delivered, they were just—there. I asked around and nobody knows where they came from. Nobody saw anyone deliver them. And the thing is, they’re quite big. Two big stone angels in my living room...they give me the creeps, actually. Sorry, my name’s Charlotte, Charlotte Hayle. If you can help, please call back.” She gave her address, some Brixton apartment complex called Barrington Arms, and her phone number before the message ended.
“Yeah, but you could always, you know…do an x-ray.”
“I can see you in the oven reflection, you know,” Hamish said slyly. “Also, this toaster’s highly inefficient! Do you know how I know? I can feel the hot air all over my face, which means heat isn’t being conserved properly. Plus the knob is sticky and it’s really old.”
It was barely a flicker of the eyelids for both of them, but when they stared at their angels again, they were directly in front of each man, inches away from them.
Molly slapped him spontaneously, then gasped, as surprised as Sherlock. “Sorry! But…but you can’t just shut me out like this. Now sit up!” Uncomfortable with the forced authority in her voice, she tacked on a more hesitant, “Please.”
Sherlock wasn’t listening. He was frowning at his phone. “Three voicemails, John—“
“I ate tonight. I’ll be good for a few days.”
As John disappeared, Sherlock wondered miserably if he had just lost his only friend.
“Night, Dad.” He cracked and eye open to look up at Sherlock. “Night, Dad.”
The Doctor switched off his device and they disappeared. “Proof enough, detective?”
Sherlock felt John’s mouth open, and he pushed his tongue into John’s mouth, tasting him and exploring. John moaned and pushed his tongue against Sherlock’s, making both of their pulses quicken.
“What do you want, Sherlock? It’s not often you visit me at home.”
Mary smiled to herself as she saw to the soup in the kitchen, and Sherlock gave the roll a spiteful glare. “Perhaps you’d be happier with Mycroft. The two of you could flit about town consuming nothing but pastries to your heart’s content,” he snapped.
John pressed his head to Sherlock’s chest, and the room was silent, except for the dying pops from the fire and the night wind at the window glass. John finally looked up at Sherlock, who was also still awake. “This is going to be an interesting life, isn’t it?”
. I can find my own way around…besides this is all so
for two men to have a child. And neither of us would have willingly elected for having a child at any rate.”
Sherlock was growing bored. He had, one evening, when he was tired of talking to his skull, unearthed a long-buried bottle of opium pills, and had taken a couple to make the time go faster.
“I’m aware of the risks, John. At the very least tell her that there’s someone else. Make it clear that there is no way you and she can ever work. I don’t—“ Sherlock gritted his teeth, not wanting to admit the truth, but finally said quietly, “I don’t want to compete for you.”
Jim's face contorted into a furious, threatening smile, then he frowned, pursed his lips, disbelieving. “'Bumped into him,' did you? Hm. That’s interesting.”
"A vague name's not much to go on," John pointed out.
“Oh—erm—“ The doctor looked at John with some shock and embarrassment. She muttered, “Just wanted to know who was in here,” the hurried off.
She gave the statues and the two men another confused look before conceding and leaving for her downstairs flat. Sherlock could see out of the corner of his eye that John had his eyes on the statue as well. He reached out for John’s hand and took it in his, giving it a squeeze. It felt reassuringly solid and warm. John was still here. Even as he stared down the statue, Sherlock felt a wash of relief.
"Jack Harkness?"
Sherlock continued to stare off into the distance without noticing, eventually moving his steepled fingers up against his lips, and Hamish did the same, pretending to stare off into the distance.
? How would
“Yes. As
Jim smiled placidly. “It was
Sherlock cast John a sideways look. This wasn't quite the reception he'd expected.
"Over and over?" John repeated. "I don't follow."
“Yes! Exactly! The angels feed off your energy and send you back into the past so you can live yourself to death. Inconvenient, of course, to start all over, but with you two together…well you’ll get by. I
One day, John came home from a rough job to hear Moriarty yelling at Jane in the kitchen. For a panicked moment he thought that Jim had found out that she’d agreed to help John, but when Moriarty came out, John could see he was just in one of his bored rages and braced himself.
"We need to find him," John finished up. "If he exists…"
“Ha,” Sherlock said dryly.
“Am I wrong?” Jim shoved the gun as far in as he could, making John cry out and gag on the metal, relieved when Jim finally pulled it out. He licked his lips as he waited for John’s answer.
there someone I should be talking to? What is it?"
“Take a day off,” he said when he was finished, and disappeared down the stairs.
Once inside their flat, John dropped onto the sofa. “Y’know, it’s not fair, you running around trying to protect
Sherlock’s heart dropped, but he succeeded in maintaining his cold, masklike expression. “Why bother keeping me alive at all then? Why not kill me now? There’s nothing to stop you.”
” he snarled.
John peeled off the last of his clothes and stood awaiting orders. Maybe the ropes were only set out as a threat. Maybe he wouldn't actually use them.
John already felt lightheaded from the smoke, but he didn’t waste time in stalking up to Moriarty and yanking him to his feet by his lapels. “Where is he?
“Nine and half,” Hamish said.
Hamish came around to the idea when he learned that the school, despite being a boarding school, was in London, and that he could come home on weekends.
“Have you not grasp of the concept of ‘being on time’?” Sherlock demanded.
John stepped forward and handed it over, then turned to head upstairs, eager to change and be out of Jim’s way.
? An ex-soldier who hate you, under your control?!” Sherlock laughed wildly. “The Master must have forgotten a few brain cells when he restored you, Jim.”
“Eleven. And there’s one more thing: when I saw him last week, he’d just stepped out of this blue police box: the old-fashioned kind that you don’t see any more…I don’t know if that’s useful at all…”
"Right…" John rubbed his forehead. "Maybe there are…spots he likes to frequent? Places he's turned up in over and over again?"
, Sherlock, this is
Sherlock pulled out jumper after jumper from the boxes. “I think 58% of your luggage is dominated by jumpers,” he noted, stopping to breathe one in before he tossed it on the bed with the others. “You can tell a lot about a person by cataloguing the contents of their wardrobe.”
For the next hour or so, John and Sherlock were silent as they trekked back into their flat, sinking down into their respective chairs to process everything.
He wanted to write a letter back to Sherlock now, but he didn't have any news to share and hated furthering the risk on Jane without good cause. John had spent the past month getting to know Moriarty's men, going to to drinks with them, never prying, but finding out snippets of their lives and motives over pints and poker games.
And indeed, at this moment, Hamish was pursing his lips in a decidedly John Watson way as he thought. “You don’t know what you’re talking about, do you? You probably just wanted to come in here to kiss some more.”
Evenings with Hamish were heaven. They read books and John croaked out stories, his voice growing stronger every day, and every night they curled up to sleep. The week passed much too quickly.
John raised his eyebrows. “Something wrong, boss? I promise, I passed gun assembly with flying colors in the army.” He looked at the array of pistols on the table. “Of course, those were
for you?”
With that, he turned and trotted down the staircase. John and Sherlock heard the hum and whirr of the TARDIS as it disappeared, but neither of them bothered to go to the window to watch it vanish. They were both coming to terms with what was about to happen.
“Really?” Doyle raised an eyebrow. “You’re the first doctor to tell me that tobacco has an
Mary looked around. “Don’t you have any items that need moving in, sir?”
Sherlock watched him in sick fascination as he explained this impossible theory. “You’re mad,” he said.
“How did they follow us?
Jim adopted a bored drawl, his voice dripping apathy. “Well, he had it coming...the man had stamina, but he was never the brightest. Easy to manipulate.” He twisted his mouth into a cruel smile. “Love is such a detriment to
“Fuck off, ya poofters!” Some youth yelled, clipping them on his way past.
as well.”
He had just done something he’d told himself he never would. He had expected to feel upset with himself, but instead he felt a deep happiness bubbling inside of him. All this time…and it had always been John. It was so blatantly obvious now that he was astounded all of this hadn’t happened before.
"The wild goose chase continues," Sherlock sighed as they left the embassy, unfolding the piece of paper she'd scribbled on. "Time to call Jack Harkness."
Jim gnashed his teeth together. “Get. In. The bed. If you aren’t going to leave, you are going to sleep in the bed so you’re not stiff and sore and off your game. So.
“This isn’t some man from a story. He is not only a danger to John and Hamish, but to you and Arthur as well, and will risk others’ lives without a second thought if he thinks it will help him get to me. If he comes to the door and no one is here, or even they
possibly Hamish, although I’d really rather prefer to keep him around…you know…” He frowned up at Sherlock mockingly. “…Teach him some tricks of the trade, raise him as my own. I might have to change his name, though. The name
“Mycroft! Let me in,” Sherlock called into the buzzer.
John only had to thrust up once into Sherlock before he erupted into pleasure, yelling into the gag. Sherlock came simultaneously, shooting onto John’s stomach. Panting, he unsteadily lifted himself off John and rolled to the side, pulling the gag from John’s mouth as John lay limply, trying to regain his breath.
Hamish pursed his mouth like John and furrowed his eyebrows like Sherlock. “I can’t tell,” he finally admitted after scanning the man again.
Hamish pulled John over to the table to show him a thick stack of glowing school reports, research activities, Latin class readings, and biology sketches.
“Dad…can I sleep in your room tonight?”
“We’re not going anywhere,” Sherlock growled. “Do you trust me?”
“Trust me, he is—but he’s done it hundreds of times, solved loads of cases for the police,” John said.
“You were perfect,” John whispered.
Mycroft laughed heartily, making Sherlock roll his eyes. "Even
"I can see why you warned us to keep away, then," John said, rubbing his eyes to make sure he was seeing Ursula correctly.
The name was unfamiliar to Sherlock. He glared at Moriarty for a moment before taking a deep breath, collecting himself, the straightening, looking his nemesis over coolly. Hamish stuck his head around Sherlock, still confused.
A young woman stepped into the room, looked up and nearly dropped the tea tray she was holding, gasping loudly.
Sherlock handed him his phone, then lay down on the table.
Once Mrs. Hudson had bustled off to the kitchen, brushing tears from her face, Sherlock ordered John to call Mycroft. John reluctantly agreed, and Mycroft agreed to send a car around, which took John to Diogenes Club.
“Will it hurt?” he asked.
Frightened by what would happen should Jim wake the next morning with him not by his side, John quietly stowed the letter in the inner pocket of the waistcoat he had set out for tomorrow and slid back into bed next to Jim.
“I’ll sleep in your room if I have to tonight, Jim. To make sure you don’t take anything else.”
Sherlock surveyed the living room, then seat across from Craig in a worn floral chair. “How long has Hamish been in your chair.”
“I’ll have to come with, sir. You understand,” he said, letting go of Hamish’s arm.
idea. “Oh, God…” he murmured, then began slowly pushing in and out.
They continued down the sidewalk, stumbling a bit from their shaking, uncontrollable laughter. When they finally did regain their breaths enough to hail a cab, Sherlock was dialing Mycroft.
As they slid into bed, John remarked, “I can’t believe how quickly Hamish trusted us, as if…he grew up with us. He’s so comfortable around us.”
A few rattles, whirs and shakes of the TARDIS later and they were back in 2012, confirmed by John, who lurched to the door and looked around the much more familiar version of his home street. John must have had a shell-shocked look about his face, for the Doctor stepped over and clapped him on the shoulder. “John Watson! You magnificent man—how are you holding up? 1895 too much?”
“No—I’m fine, do it,” Sherlock said, taking a deep breath through his nose.
“You tried to
“I’m just saying, if I disappear…don’t worry about me. I’m fine. Also, I love you."
“No need to wait until morning,” Sherlock said. “One of us will stay here and watch, the other can go down and try to dismantle it.” He strode over to the fireplace and grabbed a fire poker. It was hardly ideal, but it was a start. He stepped over to stare at it, giving John time to blink. “Ready for another go? I’ll head down. We can switch off.”
one survive a plummet over a waterfall?”
As callous as it sounded, John knew he was right. “We can’t both ‘die’ at the same,” he pointed out. “Nobody would believe that.”
“Why does
They bid Elton goodbye, still stunned by the woman in the concrete slab. John suggested they walk a bit before catching a cab. He most certainly needed air. "Sherlock. Just…what are we dealing with here? Because I just saw something impossible back there and now we're chasing a time-traveling alien."
Hamish laughed and hugged Sherlock around the neck. “Love you, Dad. Don’t get hurt.”
Sherlock’s jaw dropped at the sight of the console room. He blinked a couple times, then raced back outside, running the circumference of the phone box, then back in again. “…It’s bigger on the inside…” he murmured.

“Would you care if I wasn’t?” Sherlock asked coldly. “You didn’t have a problem displacing John, Hamish and I.”
“Not well.”
Jim sneered down at him. “
“What does it matter?” Sherlock said irritably, sinking into his chair.
“Are you cooking dinner again, Mary? Food at school is

“A real housekeeper,” John said. “She hardly knows what she’s in for, looking after
John felt a bit emotional at the thought of Hamish being shipped around from place to place, never being with a family long enough to call it home. Sherlock, though, was busy trying to sort out the sordid logic of it all.
John laughed a bit too. “Faking your own death
“Not recently. I’m sorry,
“Ooh! I’m flattered.”
“That’s a very inaccurate phrase, being ‘on’ time. You can’t—
Jim growled in fury and lunged forward, seizing John's neck once more and pushed his head back to the mattress, pressing down on his throat and pushing his face so close to John's that their noses were almost touching. “If you have a question, you ask
One day, he came back from discarding a body with some of Jim's other lackeys to find Jim in a rage. John and the three other men held back by the door, none of them wanting to approach him while he was in one of his moods. Finally, John took a hesitant step towards Jim, who had just overturned his desk and kicked a hole in the wall.
“You do enjoy playing with cosmic forces, don’t you?”
“Mr. and Mrs. Williams?” John clarified.
It was obvious what Jim wanted. John yanked on his tie to pull Jim’s mouth to his, kissing him firmly, then lowered his hands to pull at the waistband of Jim’s trousers, bringing him closer. If he closed his eyes, maybe he could pretend he was Sherlock, if only for a moment.
“Ah! Sir Arthur Conan Doyle…fascinating.” The Doctor flashed his psychic paper and stepped inside.
Sherlock began muttering to himself at breakneck speed, touching everything he saw. “Kaluza-Klein Theory? String theory…? It must be a holograph, or a—a—black hole of thermodynamics—“ He grabbed the Doctor. “What is this? How is this possible? We’re inside a bloody
“They do mosaics and stuff right? Or are they frescos?”
Sherlock stared at him in shock for a moment, then shook his head. “Hamish, I can understand that. He likes you, and of course you would want to keep your rival’s son. As a prize, as a protégée—“
effect! I’ve always heard it’s good for the constitution.
.” Sherlock rolled his eyes and tried to push himself up, but decided it was too much work and settled for propping himself up on his elbows. “Don’t you have something better to do?”
“We’ll understand if you want to stay, Hamish,” John said, wrapping an arm around the boy’s thin shoulders.

John stood on his toes to kiss Sherlock, unbuttoning his coat as he did.
Hamish nodded, picking up his suitcase and looking around his room. “Will I get my own room living with you and Sherlock? How long are we staying in
ago! If anyone enters or exists this building in the next hour, consider him dead. Ta-ta!”
Jim dragged his nails slowly down John’s chest and torso. He seemed unable to hold back his greed from John’s body, wanting all of it at once. He shoved John’s legs apart and kept them firmly pinned as he kissed and bit along his hip, coming torturously close to John’s cock, but avoided the actual area.
John was doubled over, clutching his stomach and trying to breathe. When he regained an ounce of breath, he clouded over with rage. “You want me to fight back?! Is that an

another Sebastian, it would just be terribly convenient.”
Sherlock’s eyes flashed in excitement and he cocked an eyebrow at John, a smile spreading on his face. “Care to accompany me, Doctor Watson? It could be dangerous.”
Sherlock’s eyes were hard as he stared with malice into Jim’s. He enunciated firmly, “As long as John and Hamish are alive and I am alive, Jim, you will not be able to rest.
