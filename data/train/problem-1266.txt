“You asked for it.” Wrapping his hand around Sherlock’s cock again, John paced his strokes up and down Sherlock’s cock with his thrusts in and out of Sherlock’s body.
"John…” Sherlock looked like he wanted to comfort John.
“What? You mean like this?” He pulled out of Sherlock’s body until only the tip remained inside and then with one quick snap of his hips he bottomed out inside of Sherlock’s body, actually physically moving Sherlock a little bit farther towards the head of the bed.
“I am. I never see you during the day. Mostly at night.” John replied softly, still not quite believing what he was seeing. A quizzical look crossed Sherlock’s face, but he dismissed John’s comment.
With his hand that was lubed up, John continued to work Sherlock open until he was able to easily take three fingers, all while he continued to gently roll and fondle Sherlock’s balls. By the time that Sherlock was ready to take John’s cock, he was a groaning whimpering mess. His dark curls were clinging to his forehead, sweat beaded on his brow. His fists clenched in the sheets so tightly that John thought Sherlock might rip the fabric.
“Yes dear I did. Are you quite alright?” Mrs. Hudson looked concerned.
“There’s not going to be a fucking next time. You are not putting me through this again. If you put me through this again, die and then do this whole coming back thing, I’ll kill you.” John’s voice was all anger and steel and commanding and it gave Sherlock goosebumps. “Got it?” John snarled, his voice authoritative and commanding.
“I was so close, and Jesus Christ I didn’t want it to be over yet.” John tried to even out his breathing. “I’m not going to have our first time in this chair. It’s a great chair but I was thinking more along the lines of having it in the bedroom.” John explained, Sherlock breathed out a sigh of relief.
“Hello John.” There was a fond smile on Sherlock’s face was John stood there and stared at him. “I suppose you’re surprised to see me aren’t you?” Sherlock questioned. John moved to the empty chair, his empty chair, opposite Sherlock and sat down.
“Well obviously I didn’t!” John had moved and was now pacing back and forth across the room in front of the couch, looking very much like he wanted to pace a hole in the rug.
Feeling very much like he was going to explode right there, right then, into his pants and Sherlock’s hand, but knowing for a fact that he didn’t want it to be over yet.
“You bastard! Couldn’t you see that I was losing my mind!?” John collapsed into his chair, his whole body suddenly tired.
Knowing what he was asking for and being too worked up to care about edging Sherlock along, John swallowed Sherlock’s erection down to the base.
“John, please…”
“Sherlock I’m going to…”
“Yes I do. Her name is Mary. She’s a nurse. I met her at the hospital.”
“You are something else.” John stroked Sherlock’s cheek, his thumb trailing over those high cheekbones, a pink flush obvious in his pale skin.
Finally, after two more coats of lube for both of them, John was ready.
John couldn’t help but smile to himself on his way into the shower. It had turned into a full on grin by the time he rinsed his hair, and he was almost laughing to himself when he peeked into the living room one last time before going to bed. It hadn’t moved, and John stayed for a few minutes to check it was still breathing. John climbed into bed and smiled at the ceiling for a while, too excited to fall asleep. It was still raining outside, but he didn’t mind. For once, he was thankful for the rain.
“John,” he said, frowning at the magazine.
He took a fork and his plate into the living room to sit on the floor next to Fawnlock, just enjoying his company. He’d eaten half of his meal when he realised how silent it was. When he lifted his head, Fawnlock was staring at him again.
with you and your
Ah. There.
He gestured at the pile that had been collected at the door. It didn’t follow his hand, just continued to stare up at him from under white-tipped lashes.
A sharp knocking on the door had them both jumping out of their skins and pulling apart.
Harry’s fists clenched and unclenched. “Look. You’re smarter than I am. You always have been. Even if you’re not great at everything, you’re competent, and you’ve always been reasonably successful if you’ve put your mind to something. Rugby, clarinet, science, history: you’re
“We will remember them.”
Sherlock sighed. If John kept on like this, he’d wake the entire ward, and then he’d be sent away just as Harry probably had been. So, instead, he did what seemed to be the easiest and fastest thing he could think of to solve the problem. He pulled John down and kissed him, hard, on the mouth.
“It’s Remembrance Day,” Sherlock said after a long bout of comfortable silence. His tea was half gone but John hadn’t seen him move once.
that people read my blog, isn’t it, Sherlock?”
“How long before the psychologist?” John asked, adjusting his blankets and sitting up a little more.
It sidestepped its way into the living room with an armful of souvenirs from its search, all the while sticking to the walls. John watched it keenly as it skirted the room, and, even though he wanted to, didn’t offer it a bag. He didn’t want to scare it away. Maybe if it realised he wasn’t a threat, it would come again.
After all, how
“He keeps saying he wants to be a soldier,” Sherlock muttered to her, his face grim.
“I was at home on that night, sir.” John’s expression went stony.
Right then, Sherlock’s knuckles passed over him in
Then he glanced to the left at the few odds and ends on the mantelpiece, trying to notice something he didn’t already know would be there. A dusty photo of someone he didn’t recognise, a piece of evidence in the form of a locket that he’d kept hidden from the police for a favour, and a pink headband. Where did these things come from? He looked across to the right, noticing another photo of someone he didn’t recognise. This time the person was in uniform.
you ungrateful shit, so just leave me alone!”
“Your date,” Sherlock reminded him.
“No, it’s not,” Moran frowned, crossing his arms. John wondered how he managed to look so offended, and decided very quickly that he was insane. It was the only sensible explanation.
“I’m trying to help you.”
“Are you crying?”
“Oh, just, um, Harry. My sister, she told me about an Italian restaurant in Marylebone a couple of years ago. She said it was a posh one, so it’s probably just about on the classy side of cheap.” He smiled. “I’ll text her, one second.”
Fawnlock’s vocabulary, although widening rapidly, was still limited. As he picked off a vine and chewed at the end of it for a moment, John had to assume he was getting a snack, and he waited. Then Fawnlock pulled the vine from his mouth to reveal a mulched-up tip. John frowned, but continued his silence as Fawnlock started to lick the mush into a pointed shape. His disgust turned into proper confusion when Fawnlock started blowing on it as they kept walking.
John raised an eyebrow. “I think that’s supposed to be a question.”
“No, soldiers are supposed to be smart. They have to be able to predict exactly when and where they need to be paying attention, and organise appropriate surprise attacks and strikes on enemies. They need to be able to work in a team, and lead a team, which means understanding all sorts of things about other people, and common sense. They need to be able to think on their feet and decide what’s best for their team at that time.” Why, yes, Sherlock definitely was going to use John’s ‘dream’ against him. If it was the only way to make him understand his own worth, they would be using it.
What didn’t make sense to him was how when he pulled at the thing, the head in his hand lifted with it. He frowned and tried to tug it out again. Once more, the head came up with it. John frowned harder and felt down to the bottom of the rod, where, after a few poked with the pads of his fingers, he figured out that whatever this was, it was attached. He had another feel – no glue there, either. John sat back, this man’s head still resting in his hands. He used his free hand to roll him back over so he was lying on his back. Then he took the torch and directed it at his head.
“John, can you hear me?”
“But maybe you just
The next question came quickly. “Where were you on the night of Monday 11
“He’s staying,” John said, and he looked at Sherlock. “Stay.”
Eventually, both of them had to pull away for a breath, and John flopped back with his arms spread. He chuckled warmly.
“If I get stabbed tonight, I’m going to be so pissed off with you,” John muttered, stalking past Sherlock and plodding off down the road. Sherlock grinned at the back of his head but said nothing.
“Something that
John looked confused, and he shuffled closer to Sherlock, not wanting to make their relationship status obvious but still wanting to comfort him. “I know you do,” he said softly, “but I’m fine, I really am. I’ve been in more dire situations than this.”
John swallowed hard and changed the channel to another one he hadn’t heard of before. Maybe it was the same one, actually. There was a different show airing – how was he supposed to know? He got up and made coffee, sensing he’d need some to survive this for much longer, and checked his phone while he was waiting for his kettle to boil.
“John!” Harry screeched, still trying to pull from their hands. “John, get out here!”
He stopped short as he approached the cottage. Lights were flashing. Why were the lights flashing? He put his bags down and crept up to the windows. The light stayed on. He swallowed where he was crouched and sat up a little, trying to see inside. He could hear things, now, things shuffling. No smashes or struggles. Light footsteps on the creaking floorboard that he knew to avoid in the hallway.
The servant nodded and left quickly. Mycroft reached down, opening the secret drawer in his desk and replenishing his false alpha scent before pulling on his coat, gloves, and scarf, grabbing his umbrella on the way out.
“As are you. Please, Gregory, another. Stop taunting me.”
“Something not good, I take it,” said Sherlock, came over and sat on the edge of the bed.
“Did something happen?” Frowned Sherlock.
“Your room, then, so we don’t sully the waters.” He leaned in and nibbled his ear. “I want to make you cry out with pleasure.”
“Is that it all?” Mycroft asked, not bothering to look at him.
“Sherlock. Enough,” Mycroft sighed. “Please. It doesn’t matter. We’re married, remember?”
Mycroft looked up as a servant stepped in. “Sir? She’s getting rather impatient.”
“You’re disappointed.” Sherlock picked one bottle up and chucked it in the fire. “As always.”
“That it isn’t happy,” Sherlock said quietly. “That both parties stray….That your wife knows and does not care about your predilections.”
Mycroft bit down, feeling sick as he marked his brother, caused him the pain that a beta would biting an omega.
Mycroft squeezed his hand. “We’ll see when we get to your home.”
“I’m gonna go to him,” John nodded, and turned down the hall and up the stairs. He tried Sherlock’s door, finding it unlocked and opening it, getting hit with a wave of scent. “Oh god. Sherlock,” he breathed. “Sherlock, do you...I know. Do you want me?” he asked, gripping the doorframe, seeing the omega rutting against his pillow. “Sherlock.”
Greg bit down on his shoulder, knowing that it would be covered by his suits. He pounded into him almost like a wild creature in his chase for release.
“I’m listening, aren’t I? Master Holmes listens, I’m certain.”
By the end of the night, climbing into his carriage, Mycroft knew that he was in a great deal of trouble. The entire way home was spent thinking about the Inspector, imagining things that weren't appropriate for mixed company, though Mycroft attempted to stop himself, failing quite quickly, and though he wouldn't admit it, happily. “Sherlock?”  He called as he entered the house. “We need to speak.”
“Hnnngh!” Sherlock let out a groan, John’s eyes flicking up from where he had his mouth full of cock to gaze at Sherlock’s face. His smooth skin was flushed, dark curls sticking to his forehead, eyes screwed shut.
“So it is.”
“So, I see you’ve got a girlfriend again.” Sherlock observed. John glanced down at his person, wondering what gave that away, but not really caring, because it was Sherlock and even if John knew that this wasn’t really Sherlock, just something John’s still recovering but still traumatized brain had concocted, it was damn good to see him.
“You as well.” Sherlock grinned at John. They lay there in companionable silence for a while before his breathing deepened and John knew that Sherlock was asleep. Feeling exhaustion in his bones, John quickly followed suit.
“Oh, oh, oh, John, John, please!” Sherlock begged. “I can take it all, please, please John!” Hearing the urgency in his cries and knowing that he probably wouldn’t last much longer, John rolled his hips and with one quick snap forward, he was fully seated inside Sherlock. Tight warm heat engulfed his cock and John felt his eyes close, eyeballs rolling back in his head. Knowing that if he moved right away, he’d just cum and be done, John froze for a minute, willing the tingling in his abdomen to fade.
"What is it John?"
“Oh you like that do you?” John grinned, the breath of his words ghosting over the tip of Sherlock’s swollen and leaking erection.
There was the sound of a drawer opening and then some rummaging around and then a bottle of clear liquid landed on the bed next to Sherlock’s hip. John gave it a look and then grinned around his current position of sucking on the tip of Sherlock’s cock.
“Mmm…” Sherlock hummed happily as he leaned over to place a kiss on John’s lips.
“Everything is fine Mrs. Hudson. Just a slight disagreement.” Sherlock assured her.
“Are you sure you’re both fine Sherlock?” Mrs. Hudson asked. Sherlock, in typical Sherlock fashion, rolled his eyes as shock and realization ran through John’s body like a livewire.
“I have dinner reservations with Mary. I’ll be back though. That’s a promise. Bye Sherlock.” John gave Sherlock one last glance and sad smile as he crossed the threshold and made his way down the stairs, his brain not registering the confused expression on Sherlock’s face.
“Legs,” he said softly, patting John’s thighs with his clean hand. John obediently spread his legs a bit further, gave Sherlock enough room to get his hand down there.
She was leaving after the school year, John recalled. Leaving to get married and move to France with her husband, who owned a boat and was also a French teacher. John had decided long ago that he didn’t like him. He often found himself thinking about Mr Hart (John’s tutor had never mentioned his name, so the nickname had stuck for him, no matter how inaccurate it was always going to be). Mostly, Mr Hart was where his mind wandered when he was suffering – to stupid Mr Hart and his selfishness and all of the rescues he was stealing from John by taking Miss Hart away.
“It’s alright,” the man said, pushing him aside. “We’ve got him, step back.”
John’s face softened slightly – emotional confessions from Sherlock always made him go all gooey – but it was clear he still didn’t understand exactly what was being said by the way his shoulders drooped. “We are friends. We can stay friends if that’s what you want. I told you, I’m not going to force anything on you, I want you to b—”
Fawnlock gave him an odd look, but let the flowers be. Then he slipped his hand into John’s and started leading him back to his camp. John hoped he wasn’t holding on too tightly.
Eventually he gave in and searched “faun”. He went straight to the images this time, and the first two were human with ram horns and goat legs, but the third seemed promising.
John’s head was hanging down, his chin back to his chest. The tears were rolling endlessly down his cheeks, but his shoulders hitched occasionally with sharp, stuttering sniffles. “Why?”
“Wh-what? What are you—John!” Sherlock was standing before he’d even realised that John had hold of his wrists.
“Right, there’s a unit on their way. How old is the victim?”
before he realised what a ridiculous notion that was. He could have left his front door open and gone away for a month and the worst he’d get was chilly bed sheets. It did, however, take a while for him to remember he had company, and while he figured it out he sat and listened.
Sherlock hummed dubiously but kept his next comments to himself. Nobody else on the whole planet seemed to realise the magnitude of how much the newspapers really got wrong or, sometimes, just plain lied about. It was endlessly frustrating but he’d given up having this argument with John a long while ago. After finishing off his reading he flicked through the rest of the articles with disinterest (falling in love with a man twice her age, inspirational story on how she overcame domestic abuse, competition for a free holiday in Prague) and tossed the magazine over his head. He laced his fingers together behind his head and closed his eyes, a deep sigh blown over his chest. He’d been up for hours now, and although he wasn’t tired he always appreciated time to rest his eyes – and wait for tea.
Sherlock gawked at him. “Really? What else did he say?”
“Limits?” Sherlock breathed, kissing down John’s chin and along his jaw as he waited for a reply.
“What?” John laughed, sitting up and muting the television. “She can get anyone to a party, she’s that sort of woman.”
“Hey,” he said. “Do you like me?”
“After lunch,” Sherlock announced as he walked back in twenty minutes later. “We’ve got about two hours.”
And he did count this as his first kiss. He paid no attention to technicality. This was the first time he’d kissed someone and enjoyed it not for the satisfaction of knowing he’d achieved it, but simply for what it was; a kiss. His first kiss, with John.
“Just be careful. For me. Please.”
Eventually, Sherlock had to pull back. John was going like he could go on forever (the expression on his face certainly said he missed having Sherlock so close) but he wasn’t so patient. He wanted John. He wanted to show him that this day didn’t have to be a depressing one, filled with sad memories and mourning. He wanted to show him that there was more to celebrate than all the friends he’d lost. It had to be today so he could remember it as today.
Fawnlock obediently followed John to the sofa. He tried to stay sat at John’s feet, but John was having none of it, and pulled Fawnlock up onto the seat with him. John flicked through the channels until he found one that worked. Luckily it was a not-too-bad crime drama series, and he hardly noticed that as time wore on, Fawnlock slid more and more into John’s body until his head was resting against John’s shoulder, his antlers carefully positioned over his chest and by his head and John’s hand keeping up the delicate combing.
“Oh? What society is that?” John raised an eyebrow.
“Are you alright?” he asked as he moved, looking Fawnlock over. “Did anybody come? Anybody at the door?”
Harry gave her brother a decidedly unconvinced stare. “Did you finally come out or something?” she asked bluntly. “That why Dad went apeshit?”
“Well, your part of the date has been spectacularly boring so far,” Sherlock sighed, leaning back in his seat.
“Ninety-six hours? Is that… That’s four days.”
“Thank you,” he said softly, patting his hand. Fawnlock didn’t reply, but kept a very serene expression on his face the whole time. He looked conflicted. John frowned. “What is it? What’s wrong?”
“All I wanted was to give you something else to remember for this day,” he said, almost inaudibly.
To fucking Mr Hart, right now, as his scarred shoulder ached from being pressed so hard against the door to listen to his dad and his sister eat their Sunday dinners, because he had to hear that she was okay.
“Couldn’t even change the pictures?”
“Need some sort of idea, John. I don’t want to mess this up.” Sherlock brought one hand down and began unbuttoning John’s shirt.
Hide the paper. SH
John shook his head, trying his best to keep track of Sherlock and not spiral into a panic attack. “F-fuck.”
John awoke with a start and batted instinctively at his face, where he’d felt some sort of bug hit him. Once he’d blinked everything into focus, he was greeted with the sight of a ball of scrunched up paper settled innocently on the seat next to him and a kidnapper sniggering in a decidedly not-innocent way in the front seat. The car had come to a stop.
“If they did, would you ever have gotten here in the first place? Honestly. Think before you speak.” Sebastian looked offended. He pulled open a drawer and lit a cigarette, looking even calmer than ever in the presence of John’s rage. “I told you I’m a professional.”
John grinned. “God, you’d bloody hate her. She’s… She’s an extrovert, let me say. She’s very nice, though.”
The chorus vibrated amongst the gathering, and then a bugle sounded from somewhere towards the bandstand with the Last Post. Eyes closed and heads dropped, and Sherlock, for once in his life, thought about the compassion and respect that people could show when they tried. He thought about how beautiful humanity could be. Nothing could atone for the horror that the World Wars had been, but, by God, could humanity try. It was beautiful.
He didn’t care what they’d ask of him. Let them throw what they could at him, he’d do anything. Anything to keep Fawnlock safe.
John’s heart sank as he hung up the phone. His hands were bound again before he had time to realise what was happening, and he was being gently ushered back towards his cell. When he had been returned he tucked himself back under the blanket and covered his face with his hands to wait for this hearing that would most definitely send him to prison for a crime he didn’t remember committing.
A little grin spread across Moran’s face. “Dead serious.”
The rapid crunches that had gradually been decreasing in volume suddenly stopped altogether. John stayed still and then changed his mind, straightening his posture as he listened hard for any more sounds. He didn’t hear any, but he did see those huge antlers appear. He could see only an inch of them as the faun hesitated, and then the rest began to appear. It was just as he’d seen from the kitchen, but this time the faun looked much less defensive and much more worried. John frowned.
“It’s all right.” Mycroft stood, and went to the door.
Mycroft went where he was guided, laying back and shedding his towel.
Mycroft tightened his grip on Greg and opened to him with a quiet moan.
“Still. Sounds important.”
“We do have another spare room,” Mycroft said quietly. “If you wished. It wouldn’t be questioned.”
“You're welcome. Here's my card if you need anything else, sir.”
“It appears so.” Mycroft nodded. “But before you do.” He pulled Greg back in, kissing him gently. “This will all pan out.”
Lovely smile. “You're more than welcome.” He took a sip of wine, watching his companion.
“Did you have separate bedrooms?”
Greg quickly stripped, putting his things in the cubbies, noticing Mycroft’s posh suit. He stepped to the bath and carefully got in opposite of Mycroft, giving him room if he needed it. The man was gorgeous, splash of red hair on his chest, pale skin shiny with sweat, even in the dim light. He looked younger here too, bared to the world.
Mycroft cupped his face, kissing him gently.
Greg nodded. “I gave John permission in his heat.  Didn't realize they'd bond and this too. If you want to blame anyone, it's me.” He held Mycroft's hand.
“I’d noticed.” Sherlock  alighted from the carriage, going in ahead of his brother, propriety be damned. “Do you really think he’d let me work with him?” Sherlock asked once they were both safely inside.
“Yes,” Mycroft groaned, rocking up to meet him with a stuttered moan. “Gregory.”
Mycroft reached out, wrapping his arms round Greg’s shoulders and his legs around his waist, pulling him in a bit faster, a bit rougher, wanton and wanting.
“They’re...brothers. But the bite?” John asked. “How are they bonded?”
Mycroft held Greg close, running his hands over his back.
“Gregory informed me of a certain fact, little known, about what happens when a male beta and male omega bond,” Mycroft replied, looking over at his brother.
“He won’t. Care to come along now?”
Mycroft signaled the waiter as he sat. “Do you know what you want?”
“Germany, to start.” She handed him a folder.
“Then we’ll deal with that when it comes.” Sherlock met his eyes. “How are things with the Inspector?”
“It’s not a true bond. It’s only for appearances. Mycroft told me the story once, of exactly why, but right now you have a choice to make. You could go to him. I know he’s been watching you and you him. He’s never truly lain with an alpha. And Mycroft says he will not bite him again, afraid of hurting him. Or you could leave. But if you do leave I’d beg you to keep the secret.”
Sherlock relaxed incrementally, panting against John. He could feel the knot pressing against him and offered his throat on instinct.
“It has been a very long time since I've found someone I could trust,” Mycroft replied. “And even longer since I've found someone as  attractive as you.”
“Yes, of course.” Greg led him upstairs and pushed open a door. “This is my wifes. We only have one servant and the girl doesn’t live here. Today is her day off.”
“I..if I go to him now, it's wrong,” John said. “I don't know if he wants me.”
Sherlock looked up and was caught by the sight and scent of the compact alpha. “Morning.”
“Yes. Since the first,” said Greg honestly. “You’ve got amazing eyes.”
“I have an idea. It'll cause a scandal, but I think you both can weather it.”
“We can all be happy, less a little scandal,” smiled Greg. “It’ll all be okay.”
Greg stretched and sighed. “I know. When can I see you again?”
“Mycroft. Not Holmes. Not if you wish to kiss me.”
“I’ve missed you too. So much. John’s been fretting, but I bet you can find him a suitable position in another part of town. I told him if you were angry with anyone it should be me.”
Master Holmes,
John nodded slowly. “Why do I feel as though whatever you’re going to tell me isn’t going to be welcome?”
“Yes, of course it’s all right,” said Sherlock, giving Mycroft a look.
“Certainly,” John said faintly, following Sherlock out.
“But you are here too,” Mycroft said. “I know you hate this, brother.”
“Message, sir.”
Greg swallowed and stepped into the room, closing the door behind him. Oddly there wasn’t much alpha scent in here. “May I join you?” He asked.
Sherlock followed as Greg turned out of the alley. “You find my mate attractive,” he said quietly.
Greg took a deep breath. “This can go no farther than this house, John. It would ruin lives if it did.”
“Would you like me to look into it?” Mycroft asked gently.
Greg couldn't help a bit of sadness in his smile. “To family.”
Sherlock curled up. “It's not as if I'm going to get pregnant.”
John gave a possessive growl, and nipped at Sherlock’s neck, pinning him. He knocked his thighs wider apart and then pushed, breaching the omega fast and hard.
“That’s it? Not even going to ask anything about me?” John asked, turning as Sherlock made to leave.
Greg kept kissing, letting Mycroft guide him where he would.
“No, they’re fine. Sherlock’s just worried about Mycroft leaving,” he said, finding it an easy lie. “Just making them some tea.”
Anthea glanced at the stairs. “I understand you have boarders now. You could warn them.”
“So hot,” growled Greg.
Sherlock cried out, full for the first time, almost too much and still not quite enough. He muffled his cries against John's shoulder, overwhelmed by the powerful alpha and his scent.
“Well, I am supposed to be dining with another, but he hasn't shown either, so certainly.”
“Goodnight Mycroft.” Sherlock retired, trying to think of how he could possibly get his brother some happiness.
“I was, yes,” John replied. “A spare room would be nice. I don’t have much from my pension, though.”
Something sad flashed in Mycroft’s eyes. “Fine, thank you. We’ll discuss that at a later date.”
“Sherlock,” Mycroft said quietly, bile pooling in his stomach. “You can’t. You know the dangers.”
“Not at all Mister Holmes. How is your mate?”
John went back down the hall, only giving a small thought to why Greg had been in the room with them, but deciding it was better to let some things lie.
Greg spread himself for him, moaning softly.
“You’re staying right here in my arms tonight,” murmured Greg.
Sherlock stepped into the room and closed the door behind him, locking it, though he didn’t think Doctor Watson would come knocking unless he was certain something was wrong. “I can smell you panicking, Mycroft, what happened?” He frowned at Greg, looking between them.
Mycroft nodded. “Yes….That could work. And no one would be the wiser.”
“Too long. Not that long for me, I’m afraid.” Greg nuzzled his throat.
“Any requests?” Harry asked, tucking it into her pocket in replacement of her phone, which had just chimed. She looked down at it. “Oh.”
“You told me not to be a doctor!” John cried, pressing his face against the wall. He didn’t have the strength for this. He shouldn’t have called. “‘n anyway, I’m joining the army, I’m gonna be a soldier. That’s what you wanted. I don’t understand.”
“You don’t have any idea where to take me,” Sherlock deduced with a smile. He slid his hand back into John’s. It was a lot warmer than it had been earlier – but, then again, they’d been chasing that last drug dealer for a while. John’s hand curled around his like another glove.
“What?” John frowned again, now more annoyed than anything. Why couldn’t he just tell him, for God’s sake?
He considered offering a walk around the shops or a stop at a café but then John would know that something was up, and later on he’d get the piss taken out of him for trying to do something kind. That was always what happened. Today he left it, staring down at the pavement all the way home and growing to accept that he’d probably have this strange yearning in his chest for the rest of his life. It had flared today when he’d taken John’s hand, but he’d get used to it just as he had the softer feeling.
Sebastian shrugged again. “My office.”
He’d read about it in magazines and heard it in some films he’d heard John watch with his girlfriends. They described their first kisses as suddenly seeing clarity, knowing exactly what to do and who to do it with.
“John,” he grunted, hips pushing into John’s waist so he could press down against something solid. He groaned gently. “God, John.”
“May I take you to bed?”
“Oh, John,” Sebastian breathed, putting a hand to his heart. “I’m wounded to think you’re still not listening to me. After everything we’ve been through.”
John looked up at him, a goofy grin on his face. “We’re going for a walk in the park?”
?” Sherlock looked one part outraged and two parts shocked.
“H-he’s in shock,” Sherlock said, his voice barely a whisper. Nobody heard him. He tried to push through. “Please, don’t, he’s scared. He’s scared.”
John didn’t seem to realise that he hadn’t actually made any room for Sherlock at all, but he didn’t mind. With another smile, Sherlock stood and bodily lifted John, hefting him from the bed and setting him down a bit further over. To his credit, John didn’t make any noise at all.
The older man gave him a tiny smile. “You had a panic attack. Everything’s alright now, but we’re going to take you to the police station in the ambulance to make sure you’re alright.”
Sherlock looked very flustered. He shuffled awkwardly for a moment, wishing he still had his coat on so he could sink down into it. “I… I assume you want to keep this exclusive, too,” he murmured, unbuttoning and doing again the buttons on his suit jacket. “Not exclusive, I mean. Wrong word, perhaps. I meant… Quiet. Keep it between us.”
He waited for a few seconds, hearing scratching and steps but no voices. Then, out of the blue, he heard someone pick up the phone. No voice came.
John smiled tightly. Of course she’d assume that was how it had happened. Still, though, he hated it when people spoke about his dad like that, and Harry always seemed to be the first person in line. Despite everything, his dad remained the reason he was still alive.
He shone the light around a few times, but it didn’t seem to be awake and if it was it hadn’t noticed.
“I’m never safe around you,” John muttered, but he shuffled closer to Sherlock anyway when the cold, dry wind hit his face. “God, it’s freezing.”
A quick check of his hand suggested that his tremor was still present, but who the hell cared when he could bloody
Soon enough they were both on the edge again. John’s arm was moving intermittently and he was clearly trying not to go first. Sherlock’s face was red and his features were all tensed as he pushed in, again and again, each one a wrench to his balls but his willpower too strong to let it get to him.
John sat up. He took a tissue from the bedside table and wiped down his front (and his back) before rolling over. He was smaller than Sherlock but was still quite proud of how fully he managed to spoon him, one arm sliding around his waist and the other over his shoulder to hug his chest.
John let that slide. He closed his eyes with a shallow sigh, exhaustion taking him. Surely Sherlock wouldn’t mind if he had a little nap. “Where Harry’s gone?”
“And hey. Son.” John listened – he couldn’t remember the last time his dad had called him that. “Get some help.”
They stayed in that embrace for a while before Mycroft kissed his head again and pulled away. He straightened his suit and sat back, and it looked for all the world like nothing had happened. “I’ll allow you tomorrow off school to keep him company, but after that you must obey the visiting hours along with your school hours.”
“Calm down, John, it’s okay. You’re okay.” Sherlock shuffled closer immediately and put his hand on John’s back. “John, listen to me. You’ve only got one lung working properly at the moment. It’s not safe for this to happen right now. Follow me, follow my breathing. You’re alright.”
“Yoo… Mung,” it repeated, a little more confidently. It looked at its hand and concentrated very hard, pulling it into the same shape John’s had been in. He pointed at John. “Yoo-mung.”
“I’ve got you a badge for you in my pocket, I’m using Lestrade’s. It’s just up the road here, keep an eye out.” Sherlock lifted his drink and gestured to the end of the road where, on the right, the houses stopped and the street opened out on one side.
It was relief, and it was excitement, and it was so utterly and completely right.
"I don't need help," John said defensively, and the clean side of his face blushed pink to match the injured side. "I'm fine."
Sherlock stared at him. It was obvious that John couldn't think very well right now – perhaps he needed some guidance. "Did you go to hospital?"
He hadn’t gotten a reply, but he hadn’t really expected to. John had turned out to have a lot more work to do after he’d accidentally gotten he and his
The silence was uncomfortable and uneasy on Sherlock’s side, but every time he looked at John he seemed contemplative. He supposed the man had no idea of Sherlock’s metaphorical squirming, but he had to be glad for it. He hated awkward conversations that tried to fill awkward silences. They were worse than the silences themselves.
On Friday, during school, his teacher had called his dad. John hadn’t been there, hadn’t had any idea about it at all until he’d gotten home, been smacked over the head with a strong fist, and locked in his room.
“Thank you,” he mumbled as he accepted the drink. It was cold against his fingertips, and not at all a pleasant cool when combined with the chill of the concrete slab that was his bed, but it soothed his throat somewhat.
John wasn’t surprised when he didn’t get an answer, but he hoped that maybe he hadn’t spoken loud enough.
John made a face at him and brought the oxygen mask back over his mouth. He needed some help catching his breath after all of the talking and eating – and, besides. Now he had a real reason to get better. Now he was going home with Sherlock.
“Calm down, John. Calm down. Deep breaths. You’re alright, hon. Hey, it’s alright.” She took his hand and held his mask in place, but her eyes were focused on something at the end of whatever piece of stone he seemed to be lying on. “Deep breaths. Easy. I know it’s a bit scary, but we’re going to help.”
“Dad’s an abusive, hateful drunk who got what he deserved, especially if the police were telling me the truth.” She looked down at her lap, and then rested her chin in her hand, her elbow on her knee. “You did good, I guess. I’d probably have killed him first, and
“I know.”
He smirked and then went on, continuing to squeeze a third finger in. He had to pause for a while longer this time while John got used to it, and, where the others had taken just a minute or less of slow pumps for the burn to fade away, three fingers took a little longer. Sherlock was getting incredibly impatient, especially now that he knew how to make it feel good and each moan John gave him wound him up a little tighter.
“And Sherlock Holmes,” the man beamed. “God, my girlfriend and I love your blog. Your first case is still my favourite.”
rub down, but I’m the wrong way up.”
Wells sat back. “Are you certain, Dr. Watson?”
was hurt. He needed medical attention. With an unhappy sigh, John scooped the man up and then picked up his torch.
Sherlock sighed. “This isn’t the kidnapping, we’re going to find a dealer.”
The nurse handed the gown over and stepped out for a minute to dispose of the dirty blankets. Sherlock got to work untying the strings at the neck and lower back of the gown John had on, and soon he was pulling it away from John’s front and staring with wide eyes.
Sherlock laughed softly. He wondered how long these effects would last, because he was supposing now that he could get used to them. “Goodnight, John.”
By the time John sat down he felt a bit better. John brought the remote with him and changed it from the new not-quite-a-comedy show on a channel he’d never seen before to the BBC News at One. Sherlock rolled his eyes and excused himself for a moment.
“Yoo-mung.”
“You won’t have time to read all of those before we go out,” John mumbled in a vague attempt to get him to put them back.
“Then we’re practically on equal grounds.” He looked down to Sherlock. He stroked his hands through his hair. “All the way.”
“Could what, John?” Sherlock pressed. He wiped the tears back with his thumbs. “What did you say?”
“Actually, forget coffee. I’ll have a hot chocolate, thanks.” With a teasingly broad grin, John smacked both hands down on Sherlock’s back and walked him to the line. “Take your time. It’s toasty warm in here.”
“Oh, John,” he gasped, feeling horrible for squeezing him in such a tight hug the night before. John’s skin was a murky palette of brown, purple, green, yellow, and red. There were scratches and bruises all over every inch of his skin that was covered with clothes, in various stages of healing, and they leaked underneath the white bandage wrapping his crushed rib cage. “Jesus Christ. I’m… so sorry.”
He was focusing on that when he realised Sherlock was staring at him. He looked up and cocked an eyebrow, wondering if maybe he was supposed to have said something else. “What about it?”
“Fucking hell, Jim, I thought I told you to wait until I fetched you,” John heard him mutter.
“John Watson?”
“You wouldn’t have let me do it – but thank you for at least pretending.” John smiled tightly, and then his little smile accidentally spread into an excitable grin. He reached for Harry and pulled her in for another hug. Harry hesitated for a moment, and then John felt her hands on his back.
Sherlock smirked. “I wasn’t talking about a date by normal standards, John. Don’t be ridiculous. It’s as if you don’t know me at all.”
it. “I am,” he said proudly. “I know you don’t believe him, but I know him. Just… be open-minded.”
“The customers. It’s a bowling alley, looks functional – where are the bowlers?” John pushed the door open, revealing a staircase. He just managed to swallow an inconvenienced groan, and began to climb.
John tried to swallow, but what felt like a large majority of his saliva ended up down the wrong hole and he ended up choking instead. Sebastian chuckled again at the reaction, still tossing his playthings from hand to hand. Once John felt a bit better, he held his hands out.
On the second day, John wanted to go to town. He had a working leg and a topic to read up on and a new drawer of vegetables to buy. The only thing stopping him was his strangling excitement from his discovery that he wasn’t on his own any more, and that was bloody fantastic.
John was relieved when Sherlock pulled his trouser legs back down. His ankles had been getting cold. “Yes, a whole street away and watching me get stabbed. Thanks, I feel much better.”
When he gingerly opened the door, a policeman was staring back at him. “Dr. John Watson? Police. I’m arresting you on suspicion of murder.”
“Yes, this again,” John said firmly, hitting Sherlock’s hand, still clasped in his, down onto the mattress.
“Everything alright?” Again, no reply.
He put the tub down with a content sigh and closed his eyes, hands rested on his stomach. “God. That was amazing. We need to get that again.”
The condom slipped all around in Sherlock’s hands. He had to open it with his teeth in the end and even then the thing would hardly go on right. John sat there and laughed at him and, eventually, he had to turn away and do it while John’s little giggles weren’t discouraging his shy erection. After what felt like an eternity he settled over John again, one hand still down between them to help line his cock up with John’s arse.
The silence crept back between them. John wasn’t sure whether to be thankful or not; he was pleased at not having Sherlock’s sympathy, because although he’d been a veteran himself, he, personally, felt like it was stealing thunder to make the day about the present. It was a day to respect and honour the past. His own past wasn’t a part of it.
Sherlock didn’t know what to say. “You’ve never started screaming in the middle of the night on a hospital ward before.”
Oh, dear.
John had gotten awfully breathless again. So had Sherlock, just from the faint brush of the head of his cock over John’s hole.
He tried “half deer half man”, which got him a lot of people suggesting things like satyr, and centaur, and one person saying faun, which, according to the next answer, was wrong. He knew centaur wasn’t right. Satyr turned up a picture of a human with ram horns, which definitely wasn’t right.
Or perhaps he was excited about what he was implying.
Sherlock lowered his magazine to his stomach. “Are you certain you’re in the right place emotionally to begin a relationship with me?”
“You’re DI Dimmock for tonight. Use your powers wisely.” Sherlock smiled and John snorted at the name and picture on his ID.
“Excuse me?”
Sherlock almost laughed. “Oh my God, John. Oh my God. It’s okay. Everything’s going to be okay.”
“Hey!” John pulled away and scrubbed his hand over his head. Fawnlock looked confused.
John heard another faint snort of laughter. He stood up and jogged down the rest of the stairs just in time to hear Moran mutter, with a smile in his voice, “Fucking knew it.”
Sebastian’s eyes widened with his next little smile, lit up at the exciting little piece of trivia.
"No," Sherlock said, turning his head to look at John. They'd cleaned him up since his dad had gone to bed but it was obvious he was still in pain and completely out of it. "Your shoulder okay?"
It was safe to say that the moment had passed. They were standing a foot apart now, John staring up with his eyebrows twisted in confusion and Sherlock staring down with his eyebrows in his hair in shock.
“Yep, go on. Just have a check for me.”
pillow. This concrete slab was freezing, and he was too tired to ask for a blanket, but he tried to get some sleep. The anxiety of his night had worn him out so much he was certain he could feel the bags under his eyes getting heavier each time he blinked.
Sherlock sat up with a major huff, practically stamping his foot on the ground. “John, why do you ask me
“Sherlock,” he answered, eyes still on John. “I’m his boyfriend, Sherlock.”
The journey was agonisingly long. His bum had gone numb after just half an hour on the hard plastic, and his hands only responded with a dull tingling sensation as he tried to move them, not to mention the ache in his back from having them held behind him. There was a partition between him and the two officers in front, but he tried asking them anyway.
“Okay. Good.” He smiled slightly. “It’s alright, I’m here now. I’m staying.”
“I don’t need ‘ny help,” John insisted, his weak voice implying quite the opposite.
God knew how Sherlock’s earlier grinding hadn’t felt as serious as this.
John opened his eyes to find Harry staring at him, a thoughtful and stormy frown clouding her face. He shrugged and tipped his head back again. “I cook what I need. It’s fine.”
Harry smirked at the deep blush crawling over John’s face. She’d only been here a few minutes, and already she’d picked up on it. In truth, it wasn’t even her brother that had tipped her off: it was Sherlock. The more she battled her way into conversation, the more protective he got. He’d moved closer to John. He was glaring at her. If looks could have killed, she’d have been charred to cinders last bloody week.
He craned his head and managed to see the barest sliver of the hallway, along with the tall figure in the shadows from the bedroom that was repeatedly lowering its weight onto the floorboard.
“Hm, then perhaps this will jog your memory a bit.” D.I. Wells sat forwards again and leafed through the file, pulling out a black and white CCTV image. He pushed it across to John.
Sure enough, the police were there soon after, and John agreed with Sherlock’s story. He also tacked on a few bits about how the boys were so drunk they’d turned on each other to explain away their other injuries. The officers didn’t seem to have any idea who they were, luckily, and they were allowed to go home and get themselves collected.
Sherlock scoffed. “If any of the comments she’s left on your blog are at all like her real self, I’d rather keep well away. Thank you for the thought.”
“Harry!” John cried again, hitting her arm. She’d said it on purpose, he knew. She’d known Sherlock had been asleep. “It’s fine, Sherlock. Honestly, he was alright. I was just checking on him.” He turned and tried to smile. “Trust me.”
It was almost calming to be able to think of normal things like bruises, actually. The last week or so of his life had been a whirlwind of events that he was still mostly convinced he’d hallucinated, especially considering his newfound insanity. For God’s sake, he’d managed to forget that he’d bloody
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth perked into a little knowing smile. He allowed himself a tiny grin, hidden behind the magazine, and then wiped it off before lowering the article to his chest. He peered over to John, taking in his clothes (meticulously ironed and plucked about to his own satisfaction, as usual) and his hair (not particularly styled, but there were clearly attempts at neatening it up a bit) before picking the magazine up again.
“There it is,” he mumbled, pulling his hair again but this time to bring him down and kiss him. Sherlock rubbed over the spot again and he moaned gently into the kiss. “Alright, that’s enough playing.”
With a frustrated sigh, he slammed his book shut and left it on the table by his chair. He tried the TV again – still no signal. He listened for a second, and, yes, it was still pissing with rain. How wonderful. He considered putting the kettle on to boil again, but it didn’t seem worth it. He’d already tried to see how many cups he could make in five minutes. There was a tally on the back of an envelope still left on the kitchen counter.
“Your hot chocolate,
John tried a polite smile. “Um. Yes, please. I wouldn’t mind one.”
This time, Sherlock didn’t bother spending his lacking mental energy on translating John’s babble; the drugs were beginning to talk. “Go to sleep, John,” he said with a chuckle, “you’re high. Enjoy it while it lasts.”
Police station, ambulance… Oh, of course. Murder. Jesus, this was messed up. He closed his eyes again until he felt less nauseous and then sat up straight with a little nod. In response, the paramedic helped him up and into the back of the ambulance, officer trapped by his side.
Oh. “What?”
“They’ve assigned him a social worker, a therapist, and his own personal police officer. My brother will be pushing to have him housed with us,” Sherlock replied blandly, still scrolling aimlessly along the screen of his phone.
“On standby? What?” John shook his head, refusing to look at Jim as he snorted again.
“Anywhere up to ninety-six hours,” came the reply. John blanched.
“Dad?” he breathed, his knuckles white around the phone. “It’s… it’s John.”
He finally managed to unlock it after giving in and sitting his patient under the porch, propped against the wall. John gave him an anxious glance once he’d turned the light on. Eventually he risked it and went to grab a towel that he draped over the sofa before picking the man up again and laying him on it. When he stepped back to look at him properly… This wasn’t a man. Not a human man, anyway.
He watched as the wind beat ruthlessly through the trees, saw how fast the clouds were going. His thoughts drifted along to the faun. He hoped it had somewhere warm – which was ridiculous, because it had obviously been surviving for a while.
“You keep saying that,” John muttered, still not sure he believed it. “Professional what?”
John held up his hands again. The faun shuffled on the spot uncomfortably.
John gulped down the rage balling in his throat at the growled chuckle that came in the next pause.
(See the end of the chapter for
John almost collapsed with relief. “Yes, God, yes. Thank you. Thanks so much.”
“Excuse me?” John leant forwards as best he could. “Where are we going?”
“I’d meant maybe reading a psychology book, or actually making an effort to talk to someone. Not some gossip magazines.” John flopped back against the sofa and rolled his eyes.
fault? Everything he and Sherlock had been working on for days was in mind of the eventual goal of getting John to understand that
like a date. Not a conventional one, by any means, but still a date, and he was enjoying himself. So was John, hopefully.
John spent a few minutes tracing his fingers over the sharp spikes of the bone, just watching. Watching Fawnlock was always interesting; he wasn’t sure why. After a little while Fawnlock sat back on his heels and leant against John. He looked satisfied. With a little smile, John stroked his hand down and combed his fingers into his damp hair, trying to smooth it out a bit.
"Tell someone," Sherlock said, not at all phased.
“You chased him to Watson’s place.”
It creaked again.
John rubbed Sherlock’s stomach gently. This time it was Sherlock that broke the peaceful silence.
There was silence, and then Sebastian puffed out a snort of laughter. “Come on, tell me.” A beat. “Alright, I’ll work it out. Oh, don’t look like that, I’m just as smart as you. Don’t even think about it.”
“This is the police, what’s your name?”
“Right,” John murmured, taking a step back to let Moran lead the way. He glanced over towards the deserted streets, wondering how far across the open road he’d get before he got shot.
John’s father was being kept in custody at Lestrade’s station until further notice, apparently. John rubbed his eyes, then, sniffing again.
Sherlock’s eyes widened.
“I’ll be gentle.” Sherlock’s cheeks tinted pink at the promise, and John smiled.
even from all the way back where he was. He called the police as the victim’s best friend, in shock and stuttering, and they lapped his descriptions up and promised to send a car straight away.
John hummed and then grunted. "Don't need anyone."
It wasn’t that John begrudged her getting off lightly. Of course he didn’t; she was his sister, and he loved her. It was just that, sometimes, he wondered if she actually saw how bad he had it. The evidence was right in front of her, and she was warning him how badly he’d get shouted at. It was surreal.
“No, John! I’ll
“Excuse me?” Sherlock choked, flabbergasted by the suggestion in her voice and face.
Could he unlock him now? Could he fucking unlock him now, after admitting that he’d used a fake name to break into a court and was now releasing a prisoner that was already on charge for murder?
John’s dad came to pick him up at seven o’clock that evening, and he didn’t touch him or say a word to him. No surprise there, really. He got scared when John was hospitalised, he always did. He’d leave off for a day, a week, until he was sure that nobody had worked anything out, and then it would all start up again. John ate his biscuits and hid them behind his bedside table, his evening calm for the first time in months.
a right sob story if you step back and look at it. Seriously, change the names, put it in third person, and tell it to yourself. It’ll put a whole new perspective on things for you.”
Wells brought out four more photos. John swallowed hard as these were placed in front of him, one by one, each depicting an unrecognisably mangled body. It was difficult to tell which of the many and varied wounds and blows had been the fatal one. He closed his eyes for a second to push away some irrelevant memories and then looked through them.
“You what?” John really couldn’t believe this. Sherlock stared at him all the time, especially when he wasn’t feeling well, but this was the first time they’d ever really spoken. “Why?”
“Wh’t’s happ’ning?” he whined.
The stranger boy stayed propping John up as they hobbled inside together, Harry closing the door not-so-gently behind them. She left her coat and bag on the floor and turned around to find John tucked safely under the few blankets he had, and the stranger sat on the bed, legs swinging.
“No. Be straight with me. I’m not in the mood today. Is that your real name?” John spoke in a very measured way, trying to keep calm and not kick this man between the legs.
“Sherlock,” John wheezed, rubbing his eyes. He waved a hand between the both of them. “Friend from school. Harry, my sister. Sherlock, Harry, Harry, Sherlock.”
“Twice,” John said, as if replying but actually continuing his train of thought. “Two times,” he reiterated, that time to remind himself what ‘twice’ meant.
“Oh,” he said instead. John knew that he knew, but was mostly just glad he hadn’t said anything. “I haven’t been since… Oh, I don’t know, 2008, maybe. I think I’d lost my poppy, gone to buy another, and simply gotten caught up in it all.”
“Pasta. Shouldn’t be too difficult.” He paused. “You know I don’t know any expensive restaurants at all, right?”
His case wasn’t called for two hours. He was sat in a little room with a single chair and a window and told to wait, hands still bound. A supervised toilet trip was offered, which he politely declined. Not long after that the door opened again and another police officer he didn’t recognise beckoned him over.
Moran took a second to breathe before he began. “My name is Sebastian Moran. I’m here under the alias Tim Foster. I stopped your hearing and stole the keys to your handcuffs because I have a little deal to make with you, and, whether you like it or not, you’re coming with me. So you can either give me a smile and thank me for being such a generous person and having the mercy to release you, or you can continue to be an irritating bastard and I’ll just shoot you into submission and drag you with me.” He said it so easily, as if he hadn’t just pulled out a handgun and wasn’t tossing it between his hands in an odd juggle of keys and illegal firearms.
He approached slowly, making sure to keep his footsteps audible but not loud, and it still startled. He’d heard the noises coming from the kitchen, and so went down the hall to that doorway first. It looked different. Very different. Especially with the deer-man trying to cower behind an open fridge door. The sight was not helped by the mugs hung over his antlers. John smiled.
Harry laughed under her breath, and John felt Sherlock stroking the back of his hand with his thumb. He rolled onto his back again and let the silence calm them all down after the discussion. His head, however, was roaring. Harry wasn’t really very good at keeping in touch, and tended to be a lot more of a free spirit in comparison to John. He had no idea when he’d get to see her again, but still, he didn’t want to tell either of them that he’d spoken to his dad the day before. Sherlock definitely would have been furious at him. So… maybe a different approach.
“Jesus Christ Sherlock! IT’S NOT OKAY! NONE OF THIS IS OKAY!” John screamed, slamming his hands down on the edge of the desk by the window.
Lube.
To say that John is surprised the first time he sees Sherlock, is an understatement.
Sherlock thanked whatever deity that existed that John wasn’t wearing a cardigan over his shirt today or a vest underneath, the smooth skin of John’s chest becoming exposed more and more with each button that came undone. Feeling the urge to touch and kiss and claim, Sherlock pressed his lips against where he knew John’s heart was located and after a gentle kiss to the skin there, Sherlock bit down while simultaneously dipping his hand into John’s pants, his warm skin coming into contact with the velvety soft skin of his erection. He dragged his thumb across the head of John’s cock and then rubbed his hand down over the thick length, John’s pre-cum as lube.
“What’s wrong John?” Sherlock’s voice was soft, terrified that he’d done something wrong as he released John’s cock.
“Sherlock? What’s going on?” A concerned voice spoke from the doorway. Both men turned to look.
Sherlock’s pale eyes were wide and frantic. His fists unclenched from the sheets and wrapped around the lapels of John’s still open shirt and he yanked John down so they were eye to eye.
“You’re a smart and talented man John Watson, the fact that you still retain all your skills and knowledge does not surprise me in the slightest.” John chuckled at Sherlock’s remark.
“I have. Thought I’d be rusty, but was pleasantly surprised by the fact that I’m not.”
“Oh god yes John, like that.” Sherlock let go of John’s shirt and gripped John’s shoulders.
“I had a very rough day Sherlock. Nothing went right and I lost an ER patient.” And I’m vividly hallucinating my best friend, constantly.
John went from rarely visiting 221B Baker Street to visiting every chance he got. Because every time he was there, he got to see Sherlock. According to his mind, Sherlock only existed at Baker Street.
“Sherlock, stop, stop, you’ve got to stop.” John gasped as he yanked his hips back away from Sherlock’s hand, yelping when Sherlock’s grip didn’t lessen in the slightest and John’s hip yank caused him to inadvertently fuck into Sherlock’s hand, hard.
“You’ve been spending a lot of time there.” Mary commented one afternoon when he told her where he was going. “What happened to your vow to never go back?”
“So, that means that you, you can see him too?”
Pleased with this reaction, John swirled his tongue around the tip of Sherlock’s cock before taking him all the way to the base again. His non lubed hand delved between Sherlock’s legs to gently roll and fondle Sherlock’s balls.
“Yours is closer.” John reminded him.
“Next time!? Next time!?” John stalked forward and slammed his hands down on the arms of Sherlock’s chair, his smaller hands covering Sherlock’s, his nose only millimeters away from Sherlock’s, his dark blue eyes locked on Sherlock’s pale ones.
After two weeks of visiting and hallucinating Sherlock in public places, having had a bad day but still unconsciously needing to see Sherlock, John visited Baker street on his way home from the hospital.
“Yes.” She confirmed. John started to get lightheaded as he felt like his entire world came crashing down around him. He licked his lips and took a deep breath.
Gently rubbing his finger back and forth across the little bud there, John gave it a few strokes before slipping his finger inside. Sherlock gasped and arched his back up off the bed, a hand leaving its position fisted in the sheets before slamming back down onto the bed with a loud thud.
“You said his name!” John yelled causing Mrs. Hudson to jump and then nod.
“John what are you talking about? Of course I can see him. Sherlock is standing right there.” Mrs. Hudson pointed to where John could see Sherlock standing. A manic giggle escaped John’s lips sending Mrs. Hudson scurrying down the stairs as he realized that he was indeed still sane. He whirled around to face Sherlock.
John yanked Sherlock’s black slacks and black pants down around his thighs, not bothering to yank them all the way off as what he was interested in was currently hard and standing proudly at attention.
“Oh god!” John yelped and bucked his hips into Sherlock’s hand, his lips leaving Sherlock’s so he could cry out, his hands clutching the back of the chair for support. A wave of possessiveness, a feeling Sherlock was very familiar with when it came to John, rushed through Sherlock’s body and he took advantage of his current position to nip at John’s neck. Fingers of the hand that wasn’t busy with John’s cock started working on the buttons of the dark blue button down that John wore.
“You’ve taken to caring for people again. Putting your skills to use.” It wasn’t a question, it was a statement. John nodded.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
Knowing exactly what to do with that, John popped the cap, drizzled some over his fingers and without his lips leaving Sherlock’s cock, he spread Sherlock’s legs (pants long since discarded) and pressed a single lubed finger against Sherlock’s tight entrance.
“Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, John!” Sherlock was actually whimpering and it was right in John’s ear.
“It’s real. It’s all real, you’re real, you’re you, you’re here! Oh my god.”
