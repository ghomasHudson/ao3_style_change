Dean strode towards him with purpose, not wanting this to last any longer than it had to, but Alastair raised a hand and froze him in place.
“What are you, the kink police?” Dean said.
“Say yes to Michael,” Zachariah said. “Just as Sam is Lucifer’s true vessel, so too are you Michael’s. We had worried that the forces of hell had damaged you too greatly to be a true vessel, but Michael says otherwise. For some reason, he appears partial to you, even despite your recent, er,
“Oh, phenomenal,” Dean said, snorting. “You’re telling me we could have stopped this, but now it’s too late and fucking
“Hmm,” Dean said.
“Michael sends his regards,” the angel said, in a light growl. Beside him, the second angel smote another demon, and the demonic ranks spread further, some running for the trees and others using their comrades as body blockers.
The Christmas Eve drinking game Sam had referred to turned out to consist of Gabriel shouting out a random lyric to a Christmas song, and whoever came up with a sufficiently dirty way to finish the lyric got to pick a person to take a drink. It was a clumsily conceived game, but thanks to the general drunkenness of their company, Gabriel’s never-ending repertoire of Christmas songs, and Dean and Jess’s creativity, the game went smoothly, with Sam taking the vast majority of the drinks. They ended up calling it quits when Sam’s attempt to stand to get a glass of water ended with him on the ground, with drunk and cheerful “merry Christmas”s exchanged all around. Gabriel grabbed Castiel before he could complete his escape.
“Uh, Smith motel, off the I-75 in Georgia,” Dean said, and no sooner had he finished his sentence then Cas appeared, alarmingly close to him.
“Cas… you can’t,” Dean said. His chest was hurting, and his heart was screaming at him not to tell the truth, to let Cas believe that they could get out of this one intact, but he knew he couldn’t just pretend, not to the angel. “Death told me I can’t escape again.”
So why did you even make him an option, then?
“When they’ll get married?” Gabriel said.
“Well, E. Coli is serious,” Charlie said.
“Oh,” Dean said, and held out his arms. “By all means.”
“I said not to move,” Cas said, forcibly removing Dean’s hands and licking down the side of his shaft. “I’m busy.”
The studio audience
“Shut up,” Cas growled, pressing his lips back against Dean’s. Dean slid his hands down Cas’s back, trying to be subtle as he encouraged the angel to press against him, to grind against him. He was hard, he had been nearly since he’d first touched Cas, and now he realized the angel was as well. It made no sense that Cas, a multidimensional being, could participate in something so human as sex, but then again, it also made no sense that Dean Winchester had walked straight out of hell and back into life, so Dean supposed that in a certain way it
The door opened to reveal a scowling old man with a massive shotgun in his hands.
“Another average day, then,” Dean said, cracking his knuckles.
determine the fate of the world. For anyone just now joining us, let’s get re-acquainted with our remaining contestants.
“Yes, Dean, I, a twenty-story celestial being, can safely enter a roadside bar,” Cas said.
Feeling embarrassed, Dean lapsed into silence again. He sat against the unyielding wall for a while longer, so much longer that he lost feeling in one of his legs, before trying again.

“Get out?” he murmured.
say--” his voice deepened slightly, matching John’s exactly “-- Son, I’m real disappointed in you. I raised you to be a hunter, and you insist on this ridiculous rebellion -- why? You’re supposed to be the good son. You’re supposed to be there for Sam.”
“And it smells good enough to make the mothball smell just a little bit less bad,” Dean said.
“Give them time,” Dean said. “Once I leech all your warmth, they won’t be so cold.”
Castiel took that insult with an almost imperceptible roll of his eyes.
MICHAEL
Dean ground his teeth, trying to tune Alastair out, trying to remind himself that the face he was wearing wasn’t really his father’s, but it was nearly impossible to not get sucked into the farce at least a little bit.
Doesn’t matter. Why don’t you fill the audience in on your more
“Jo, you and Charlie can get the garlands and the decorations,” Sam said. “Which leaves… uh….”

is on the loose?”
“Of course,” Cas said in a dead tone. Dean privately hoped Cas never used that tone on him -- he wasn’t usually intimidated by the angel, but then again, Cas typically didn’t speak to him with such a lack of inflection.
Cas poked his head in. Charlie noticed him immediately and ran in for a hug, squealing all the way.
I have to pick one? If I pick one, you’ll let us all go?
“Demons up to something big?” Dean said. “Got any idea what?”
At first, Bobby sent them out on the same types of basic demonic cases, but as hunters across the country began stepping up to help, and Alastair became more of a concern, they came to the agreement that finding Alastair’s new vessel had to be top priority for the Winchester brothers. There was alarming radio silence from him for around a month, during which Sam and Dean did everything they could to pick up his trail, and to track down a weapon that could kill him. Ruby was certain that Sam was strong enough to kill him, now, but Dean wanted a backup plan. He was in favor of trying to track down the Colt, which had last been seen in hell but could, hypothetically, make its way back to earth.
“Perhaps,” Cas said. There was an awkward moment of silence, and then he disappeared with a soft flapping sound.
“Truthfully, it doesn’t matter to me,” Cas said.
“Better smell or taller, Dean?” Cas called.
“Let’s go get smashed,” Sam said.
“I like this park,” Castiel said. “And it’ll be easy to see anything coming.”
GABRIEL
“Because there’s a fucking apocalypse, that’s why they’re back,” Dean said. “And look, I can’t speak for any of the other angels, but as for Cas, man, there’s nothing to worry about. Dude’s all bark and no bite.”
“I don’t know,” Sam said. “Death can probably make as many new bodies as he likes.”
“I’m sorry for that,” Cas said.
“Hey, your loss was entirely your fault for thinking they’d get it together sometime during the
“Let me go,” Dean shouted, though his voice sounded feeble and small compared to Michael’s hopelessly deep one.
What to do now? How could he change himself the most?
“Stop it.”
Death would actually help us?
It wasn’t just Gabriel’s argument that made Castiel so certain that The Plan needed to happen, right now -- there were also a series of logistical concerns that made this Christmas the perfect time.
Castiel pulled his arm out of Gabriel’s gift. “I’m going to bed,” he said sternly. “And you are not going to interfere in my love life.”
The door opened to reveal Gabriel, with Sam peering out from behind him. A rush of sound from the party upstairs accompanied them. Cas hoped that meant that at least
To Dean’s relief, Cas did not appear to be uncomfortable by the events of the previous night, nor did he appear to be angry at all or keen to talk about it. He supposed that the prospect of trapping an archangel would probably be enough to distract anyone.
Cas ignored his arms and pressed a hand firmly on the center of his chest, and Dean felt a searing, cutting pain down the sides of his ribs. The sensation was gone in a second, and Dean lifted his shirt to see inked symbols he couldn’t recognize going down the sides of his torso. Cas offered the treatment to Sam as well, seemingly as a second thought, and Sam nodded without making eye contact.
“Are you trying to ask me if I’m attracted to men or women?” Cas said. He was only messing up his tie further, the more he tried to pull it off, and Dean compulsively reached out and untied it for him, letting the straps drop back on his chest.
“Just go find Dean,” Sam said.
“I guess,” Dean said.
Dean sighed, preparing to shift back into drive and head to the other cemetery, but then he spotted something.
“Oh, look!” Charlie said. “It’s snowing.”
“Now’s good for you to get on with it,” Dean said.
Cas thrust in and out slowly, an expression of total concentration on his face as his eyes fell shut. Dean ground into him, helping the angel find the correct angle and moaning loudly when he did. Cas’s hands fell to his hips, gripping tightly as the angel picked up the pace. Dean felt a warm thrum of arousal as his prostrate got drilled repeatedly, and sank pleasantly into the sensation.
“Really,” Dean said, bowing to put his own lips to Cas’s neck. Cas smelled amazing, which Dean had never had occasion to notice before. He wondered how long had Cas smelled amazing.
“So that you could surrender to them,” Cas continued, his voice loud and echoing unnaturally, even though they were outside and such a reverb shouldn’t have been possible. He moved to push Dean, but instead of hitting him, he flew them to another place Dean couldn’t hope to identify, a place with thick, succulent trees, a spongy ground that cushioned their landing, and a background symphony of chattering monkeys.
“Sammy!” Dean shouted.
The passenger side mirror gently imploded at that, as if Cas’s guilt wasn’t already obvious enough.
be real. How could I have possibly gotten out? How do I know this isn’t some elaborate torture device? It’d be pretty smart, you can’t deny it… trick the tortured souls into having hope again, and then just crush it.”
“Yes, after forty years, I might be finally beginning to learn how to handle Gabriel,” Cas said, and immediately felt like he may have jinxed himself.
“Please, Cas,” he breathed.
“It’s too late for your brother, you fool,” Zachariah said. “Lucifer cannot be denied. Do your part and say yes.”
An hour later, Dean and Cas were
It seemed that this question, more than anything else, finally began to convince Bobby that Dean was himself.
Beside him, Sam was gaping and quiet.
“Sam,” Dean said. “Sam Winchester.”
Giving up on the mind-power bullshit, Sam reached out and plunged the demon knife into Alastair’s chest. Once again, it barely had an effect, though Dean did feel the wall holding him shudder a bit.
What the hell? You guys want the world to be [BLEEP]ing leveled?
Without another word, she smoked out of the body. Dean watched her go, wondering if it was worth the effort to attempt to restrain her, but before he could decide, Sam was crushing him in a hug.
“My powers
not be in hell any more. Hell could have coffins, and dead trees, and flat land that extended forever, and innocent people whose heads needed bashing, but Dean had never known hell to have cars. The demons were a little bit behind the twentieth century, still.
Cas pulled at Dean's arm and forced him to turn so that they were standing alarmingly close. He was still looking at him with that
specifically,” Sam said. “Maybe he was just guessing that he’d see us again in the future?”
“Believe it or not Dean, there are others like me out there,” Ruby said. “Most demons have taken Lucifer’s side, but there are some of us who recognize that following him is a horrible idea, some who are spying for us.”
No, this is real, Dean. This is inevitable. How can I convince you…?
“Uh,” Cas said.
“I’ll see you in hell, Dean,” Alastair said, a smarmy smile on his face. “We have so much to catch up on.”
“We have three hours before I have to get Jess from the airport,” Sam said. “Bobby, where is that star you said you had?”
“Why would you want to know about hell?” Dean said, widening the pit he’d made in the table. “Hell is hell. The place sucks ass. You want to hear me complain about how I was trapped in a place that sucked ass for a hundred years?”
“The tattoos work,” he said, barely a breath away. If Dean swayed even an inch forward, their noses would touch. “I couldn’t find you.”
“Though,” Sam said, grabbing his sleeve, “wasn’t there just
“Would you like to hear about which natural disasters my brother has caused today?” Michael said. “Or perhaps how he managed to annihilate an entire garrison of angels with no effort?”
It was dark out, but the Christmas lights provided enough light so that they could see the thick, fat snowflakes tumbling down to join the old snow already covering the ground. Finally, the snowy weather that was promised was being delivered.
So, what, he wants me to pick… Lucifer? Does it matter to him at all that Sam still hasn’t said yes? I’m not the only holdup here.
“Well,” Dean said, looking over at Sam. “This is a lot, even for us, huh?”
Firstly, Castiel was up for tenure within the year. He didn’t know if he’d get it or not -- he had a strong publication record, but a few people in the department seemed to hate him, and while he’d mostly had success in recruiting and mentoring his grad students, a few had ended up quitting. But regardless of if he got tenure or not, this was essentially his last opportunity to move universities. Once his research program really got going, it would just not be feasible, so if he wanted to live in the same city as a certain person who he may have had unrequited feelings for for twenty years, this was his last chance to make that happen.
They banged their heads against the figurative wall for weeks. Even low-level demon activity seemed to be dying down, for reasons unknown. It was getting difficult to find minor demons to interrogate.
“It doesn’t matter what he thinks,” Dean said. “What matters is what
“Just one,” Dean said, thinking of Cas.
Like everything else, the way to Bobby’s came back to Dean as he thought about it more. By the time he was pulling up to the lot, he’d become convinced that he must have gone to Bobby’s from every single direction in the continental U.S. -- how else could the random patch of road connecting rural Minnesota to South Dakota seem vaguely memorable to him? He knocked on the chipped door to the house, nervously reminding himself that this person had clearly been a friend, because why else did he feel so immediately familiar with all the sights and sounds around him?
They got the tree attached onto the Impala with some minor angst from Dean (“It’s going to scratch the paint, Cas
“The Colt won’t do anything against so many demons,” Dean said. “We could die fighting, but even if we take Alastair down, who’s to say one of his cronies won’t finish the job?”
“Bullshit,” Bobby said. “There’s no such thing.”
CASTIEL
“You’re not staying there, Dean,” Cas said, and Dean shivered at the intensity of his expression. “I'll make a deal to free you when it's done.”
GABRIEL (archangel, deeply powerful), walks slowly through the mansions's Mediterranean garden, addressing an adoring audience. This is the second-last week of DEAN WINCHESTER (the Bachelor)’s journey to find love. Three contestants remain.
“Here's what we will use tomorrow,” Cas said. “Holy oil, which I retrieved from Jerusalem last week. Spray paint, to ward the building. All of the materials needed for the summoning spell. As Gabriel is currently in this town, it should be a more potent spell than usual.”
The fact that I memorized the entire "I rebelled for this?????" speech on accident...
it seemed to say.

And thirdly, for somewhat mysterious reasons, the Winchesters were planning a Christmas reunion of friends this year. The idea had been born the previous Christmas, when Dean had been alone in a random city, talking on the phone to Cas about how dumb it was that they were both alone, together, on this most festive day (Dean would never show it, but Castiel knew that he did actually try to celebrate Christmas every year, though not usually in the conventional way). Castiel had idly suggested getting together a group of everyone who didn’t have many blood relations anymore (a lot of their friends, sadly) to celebrate all together, and Dean had enthusiastically jumped on the idea. Castiel had watched throughout the year with mild surprise as various details kept coming together -- Bobby Singer said they could use his house, if they did all the cooking and cleaning, Charlie would be able to make it (her girlfriend’s family needed time to warm up to her), Jo could get time off from work, Gabriel, sadly, could make it… it really seemed to be happening.
“Is now really the time for this conversation, Sam?” Dean said.
The sun was too much. It was so much that Dean couldn’t do anything at first but slam his eyes shut and cover his face with his arms. But after a few moments of confusion, he was able to straighten up cautiously, and assess his surroundings through squinted eyes.
“So,” Sam said, turning back to Dean. “How’d you get out?”
Gabriel, I swear to god, if you don’t let me go--
” Dean whined. “Are you going to make me beg?”
“Sure we could have,” Dean said. “Put Lilith in a Devil’s trapped coffin and throw her into the middle of the Pacific. Good luck killing an immortal demon who’s at the bottom of the ocean. Problem solved.”
“Ooh, can I come?” Charlie said.
“Right,” Dean said, remembering himself. “I was exaggerating.”
a bit like Cas, too.
“You… what?”
“We rescued Dean from hell because we had work for him,” Cas began. “I wasn't told much. I wasn’t sure what exactly the nature of the work was. My superiors in heaven certainly knew more, but even they didn’t have the details of the coming storm. We just knew the demons were planning something big, and Dean needed to be on earth again.”
Okay, I’ll track Death down. Thanks for the tip. Can I go now?
What is this? Is this actually a real TV show? They can’t actually air something like this, right? Did Gabriel make this up?
“Come in!” Dean said. Cas pushed the door open and Dean’s eyes widened. “What happened?”
“It’s fairly serious, Dean. We will need his help,” Cas said, rubbing his temples with his fingers. Dean noticed that he looked exhausted, more exhausted than he’d ever seen the angel look. There was blood all over his trenchcoat, and a weariness in his expressions.
GABRIEL
“Okay what?” Dean said.
Transition to the next scene. SAM/LUCIFER stands in the middle of the rose garden, holding a rose.
The man sighed, and looked to be thinking about something. He muttered something under his breath, something that sounded a bit like
“What do you mean--” Cas said, voice abruptly cutting off as Dean finally sucked him down for real, slowly relaxing his throat and moving down until his lips were nearly at the base.
Cas was forced to concede, especially when he was cruelly reminded how expensive Christmas trees had become these days. For the past several years, he’d celebrated Christmas alone, not bothering with traveling to his family or purchasing a Christmas tree. The most recent year, feeling depressed by how un-cheerful his holidays always seemed to be, he’d bought one of those Norfolk pines all the hardware stores had this time of year, but it had only served to make him more grumpy about the holidays. Being locked into his little apartment with his dying Charlie Brown tree made him realize how empty he had voluntarily made his life, by continuing to work until the eleventh hour, never making time to see his friends, and never managing to have the courage to tell Dean he wanted things to change.
“Oh, I dunno,” Alastair said. “Sometimes I just get these
Days passed, days in which Dean only existed during the brief periods of time he had to talk to people for cases. He snapped into reality just long enough to charm the people he needed to charm, and then he snapped right away the second he was alone again, going back to hell in his mind. He barely stopped moving, going from one case to the next without bothering to keep anyone up to date on his position, taking out demons and the like without blinking. The moments of silence and stillness were rare and short, but each one still felt a century long while he was in them.
“That’s very kind, Sam,” Cas said. Was Sam family-zoning him on Dean’s behalf? How did Sam know that Cas needed to be family-zoned? Hadn’t Cas been subtle about his true feelings? Well, perhaps not…
“Well, the people in the town would have died if I hadn’t stopped you,” Dean said.
“Hello, Dean,” he said, looking at Dean like he was both slightly angry and confused by him. “Do you remember me?”
“Hunting demons,” he said, throwing his shoulders back slightly as he said it. “It’s pretty much all I’ve been doing. Ruby has been helping.”
It doesn’t matter if he’s not ready.
“It is,” Dean said. “But you volunteered to wrap our presents, remember? I needed you to wake up so we could get it done before we decorate the tree.”
“No,” Cas said. “He said his friend Ruby was nearby. She picked him up.”
Sam rolled his eyes and shook his head.
Well, that’s just not true. I mean, he’s acting like Lucifer now, because your

“My name is Zachariah,” the man snapped. “I believe you recently entrapped my superior.”
“I’ll eat it just to spite you,” Jo said.
“We would have heard about him by now though, right?” Dean said. “I mean, I’ve
“Dean’s no coward,” Castiel muttered.
“Oh, Dean-o, everything I do is for a reason,” Alastair said, the demon’s gruesome face breaking slightly through the visage of his father. “Hey, what do you think your father would say now, if he could talk? Do you think he’d like that stud in your ear? Do you think he’d like to hear about what you did in hell?”
“Yes,” Dean said. “But would Jo?”

Still nothing.
A few facts:
“Is that not amenable to you?” it said, looking wholly unconcerned by the knife at its throat. If Dean wasn’t mistaken, the creature seemed a little sad, but not in the way souls in hell usually were -- it looked as if its hope had only just been crushed, rather than been annihilated years prior.
Sometimes, he lasted a little longer in his efforts to be “healthy” and stop "self-sabotaging.” On those days, he’d go to some random, cheap-looking food place, and force himself to eat at least two meals, trying to make up for all the food he usually couldn't eat due to his total lack of appetite. Or he’d get a motel room that paid by the hour, just for the opportunity to stand perfectly still under the lukewarm shower water and feel a sensation besides crushing doom. But he started steering away even from that after he accidentally caught a glimpse of himself in one of the gaudy bathroom mirrors and saw that a huge chunk of his hair had gone completely gray. He touched it idly as he examined his reflection, wondering when and how that had happened. Then his reflection began to make him nauseous, so he broke the mirror and left out the window.
“You, hopefully,” Dean said.
They made out for a while longer, rolling around on the bed like teenagers who didn’t know or care to do anything else, before Dean decided to take matters into his own hands.
to swarm an army of demons, fight our way to Alastair, disarm him, and shoot him with his own weapon, all before midnight tomorrow, when the ritual is meant to take place?”
“Why don’t we hear this news that you wanted to tell us, huh, Cas?” he said, smiling encouragingly.
day would be the day he got it together and accepted his fate. Those plans would always die whenever the last of the previous night’s alcohol burned away and he was left to face the reality of his situation with no buffer, no distractions. Then he would tell himself that he
“Hey Cas,” Dean said. “Not saying that I don’t know how to cook meat, because I do, and I don’t need a recipe or anything, but just in case, will you Google what the internal temperature of a prime rib is supposed to be?”
“They’re dating now,” Cas confirmed.
,” Dean said, laughing. “Are you trying to hit on me?”
Dean collapsed to the ground in what would surely be his last act, keeping his eyes masochistically trained on Alastair’s smarmy face. Seconds ticked by, Dean's gaze growing foggy. There was a sudden crashing sound, one Dean barely registered, and Alastair's expression changed abruptly from smug triumph to what looked like actual fear. And before Dean could see anything more, blazing white light came rushing in.
“The plan
His feet led him mindlessly around the perimeter of the first floor. There was no sign of Dean anywhere. Cas was just about to go upstairs and check there when he saw a lone figure sitting outside, picking at the label on a beer bottle and wearing a woefully inadequate jacket. Cas went to the linen closet to grab a heavy, aged blanket and stepped outside to join him.
“It’s starting,” Alastair said.
“And, uh, Bobby. And Charlie. And… Benny.”
“We’re practically besties,” Gabriel said.
“Not a damn thing,” Dean said. For some reason, his instincts were screaming at him to omit as much of the truth as possible. “Except the angel finding me. And, uh, pulling me out.”
“So what’s this plan, then?” Dean said. If the demons had some big plan, it couldn’t actually involve him, right? Maybe with all the fuss about the “plan,” they could conveniently skip past the part where Alastair and Dean knew each other.
“Oh, god,” Dean said, sitting up. “Who gave the angel a phone?”
“Think more weapon-based,” Dean said wisely. “Hey, wouldn’t it be funny if I got Jess this camping chair?”
“Gabriel and Michael are working together to defeat Lucifer and bring paradise to earth,” Zachariah said.

“Let me put my earring in first,” Dean said, fishing through the plastic bag of items from the drugstore. “What do you think, the black stud or this fake diamond?” He’d picked up the latter because he thought it was hilarious, but the bald man didn’t seem to share his sense of humor, simply rolling his eyes and making a gesture with his hand. The black stud flew into Dean’s ear.
“Yes, you can,” Cas said, his eyes boring into Dean’s. “I know you can, because I’ve seen you there.”
“YOU ARE PRAYING TO THE WRONG ANGEL,” a voice said, a voice so loud and deep that it echoed around Dean and seemed to be coming up from the floor, down from the ceiling, in from each of the darkened walls. Dean felt himself vibrating slightly, as if his body was recognizing the voice in a way that his mind couldn’t.
a real one with relationships and feelings and a penchant for cracking jokes at inappropriate times. A ghost of that person was still in Dean now, but he couldn’t imagine how to actually become who he used to be, or even anything close. He had died for Sam, so he must have cared for him deeply, more than he cared for himself, but thinking of that level of devotion now, Dean couldn’t help but just feel… tired. How had he managed it?
“Woah, hold up, I’m with Cas today,” Dean said. “We already had planned to go gift shopping together.”
“Seems dramatic,” Dean said. “Aren’t we all on the same side, here? Why kill us?”
Rationally, Cas knew that people tended to display their feelings for others when they had them. People tended to ask out other people who they were attracted to, or, in Dean’s case, they tended to relentlessly hit on them at bars. Rationally, he knew that he was behaving like a middle schooler, reading into all of Dean’s eye contact and body language and innuendos like he sometimes did when he was being a little more hopeful than he should. But the irrational part of his brain would absolutely not give up the ghost until it had to. So he’d be telling Dean the truth at the Christmas reunion, for real this time, without chickening out, and he’d move on from there, easy as can be.
The rest of the day passed in a whirlwind. The main bedrooms had been made habitable, but that didn’t mean that the entire downstairs
“I’m sure we couldn’t have stopped it, Dean,” Sam said, breaking his silence with a grim, toneless voice. “If the angels couldn’t…”
“Totally fine,” Dean said, though Cas could feel him flinch reflexively. “I love having your icicle feet to keep me cool.”
It was a very nice offer. The nicest offer that Dean had.
“No,” Cas said, sighing. “Nothing else will help us tomorrow.”
right? I just got off a case, man.”
“Hey,” Dean said, surging up to kiss him again. Cas kissed back enthusiastically, evidently enthusiastic to participate in something he now knew how to do. “Don’t be embarrassed. It’s hot.”
“I would also not say no.”
“Dean, there are children around,” Castiel said, though his point was probably weakened by the fact that he was laughing along.
” Dean said harshly, lighting his match and dropping it onto the ring of holy fire. Gabriel watched the ring of flames spring up around him with an expression of amusement.
Cas looked away.
“You can leave,” Sam said. “I just thought it would be best if you understood better what happened up there.”
“Wow, sounds like you guys were crazy back in college,” Gabriel said, a little too casually. “So, you all made out with each other? Including… Cas and Dean?”
“I’ll get it for you,” Cas said. “It’s your Christmas present.”

But then, something happened. One of the souls on the rack spoke to him, spoke in words beyond the pleading cries he was used to.
I had mentioned a few chapters back that I was going to mostly stick to posting a chapter a day.

And then, just as Cas’s lips touched Dean’s, and he registered that Dean’s lips were about as soft and gentle as you might expect them to be, based on their appearance, and he started to wonder about other aspects of Dean, like what his hair would feel like in his hands and what his arms would feel like if he were in them, the door banged open.
“Well then,” Cas said. “What are you doing New Year’s?”
If there was a time to act, it was now. Dean didn’t have a watch, but it had to be nearly midnight, and Sam was still nowhere to be found.
Yeah, I guess, consider yourselves spoiled. I’m not about to join up with the devil and become a demon, thanks.
“Sam, run!” he shouted. As he peeled past Sam, his brother also broke free and followed after him. Alastair was strolling behind them, clearly considering running to be beneath him.

“Alcohol helps you forget the things you’ve done wrong,” Dean continued, nudging the pitcher towards Cas.
Dean stalked the aisles, shoving a bunch of water bottles into a tote, as well as some things he only remembered about once he saw them -- PopTarts, Coke, Milky Ways, Cheetos -- memories from another life. Eyeing a car outside that looked easy enough to jump, Dean headed for the door, then doubled back as if he’d only just forgotten something.
Dean really did deserve more credit than Cas had been giving him lately. A part of Cas had still seen Dean the way he had been when they first met -- intimidating, cocky, overzealously committed to no commitment, and the type of person to always subscribe to arbitrary “rules” that would allow one to always keep one’s hookups at an arm's length. But Dean hadn’t been that way for a long time, it was obvious now. Dean had changed Cas, that had always been clear, but Dean had changed himself too.
Gabriel’s old crush on Sam returning, and felt the familiar dread associated with any time Gabriel’s sex life became a topic of discussion.
“No abandoning,” Gabriel said. “The story just got good.”
“That sounds like a big problem,” Dean said. “I’m not really sure what you expect me to do about it, though. Or why you bothered to kidnap me to tell me this.”
“What can we possibly do against so many demons?” Dean mused. “The only thing we can do to get close to Alastair is to get ourselves captured, but that doesn’t seem like a good idea.”
“Not yet,” Dean said. “Cas did say something about me being the 'righteous man', but that’s all I know. I think that's all he knows, too.”
“I’ll let you get changed,” Cas said, forcing his face into an awkward smile. It didn’t seem to fool Dean.
“Sammy, look,” he said, pointing to a new entourage of demons approaching the original ten.
“Well, we’re not calling it a ball, per se,” Gabriel conceded. “We’re calling it a holiday party with formal attire, music, and guests. Or something. But, you know. Similar end result.”
“Well, we have to,” Cas said. He was starting to feel as though he was saying all the wrong things. How had he walked into this closet so casually, only to feel such tension all of a sudden?
“But thanks,” Dean said, shooting him a wink.
“I just think it’s a pretty interesting coincidence that angels return to earth for the first time in centuries, apparently, and at that same moment, Lucifer just so happens to rise, Dean,” Sam snapped.
“You may be overselling them,” Cas said.
It was almost a relief when the door to his room opened of its own accord and a trench-coated figure walked through. Dean looked up, free to move around now that the sound was gone, and took in the messy hair, the blue eyes, and the serious expression that was walking through the door, acting like the blown-out remains of the room around him was nothing new.
“A good question,” Cas said. “We’re not sure of the answer. That’s why we need you.”
,” Dean said with great satisfaction. “Do you want to have carnal relations with me, Michael?”
actually all make perfect sense.
treasured friends from our collective pasts are apparently making the time to come to the party, isn’t that nice?”
“Why are you laughing?” Cas said. He couldn’t help but laugh a little too. Dean’s laugh was so infectious.
“You’re just now noticing?”
Dean was drunk enough that he didn’t immediately register that the man somehow knew his name already. His tolerance was high, but three shots right in a row would take it out of anyone.
“I am an angel, as I told you,” Castiel said. “But to easily communicate with you, or any other humans, I am forced to take a vessel, like this one. Though this one is… more temporary than most.”
The angel took a deep breath, and appeared to come down from his sudden rage just enough to carry on the conversation, his false smile returning.
The rest of the afternoon passed better than expected -- Jo’s alcoholic eggnog helped Cas relax about the coming events a little, and Bobby’s skills in the kitchen helped smooth over the components that others were not so good at. The prime rib was looking good, thanks almost entirely to Dean and just a little to Cas.
“What was that?” Cas asked in a daze. Dean had to laugh.
“I can’t believe you’re back,” he said in a rush. “I tried everything to get you back, you know, but nothing worked.”
“So does this eggplant,” Dean said. “Where did you get this one, Gabriel?”
Immediately, Dean pictured Sam saying
Bobby froze, a wooden stake he’d put on the desk rolling off and clattering loudly onto the floor. He didn’t seem to notice.
You’re not changing my mind here, Gabriel.
- Dean was in hell, but the world above went on as usual, for the most part. Ten almost-normal months passed during the hundred years Dean was in hell.
“Probably shouldn’t,” Dean said. “Just picked up a case in Tennessee. Looks like some of those ghost-demons Cas was warning us about.”
Dean glanced at Sam in alarm, wondering if he had heard the archangel as well, but he was passed out, head bobbing limply against his shoulder. He wanted to try to wake him, see if he could hear it too, but before he could even consider it, the presence was gone, abruptly as it had come.
“Oh, you wouldn’t,” Dean said, turning Cas’s face towards his and leaning forwards to kiss him. To his relief, Cas kissed back immediately, leaning into Dean and reaching out to cradle his head in his nimble hands. If his enthusiasm was anything to go by, Dean had to assume that Cas had, in fact, been wanting to repeat the experiment for quite a while, which was interesting. Dean hadn’t thought it was possible for an angel to actually want to have sex with him, beyond that random fluke when they both thought they were about to die, and the realization that it might
Dean held out his hand, letting Bobby draw a shallow cut on his palm. Bobby stared at the innocuous cut for a few moments.
bringing the tree back. We can decorate the tree tomorrow morning as a fun Christmas Eve activity!”
“Oh,” Dean said. “You work for Gabriel?”
“Dean, I did
“The plan wasn’t supposed to happen yet,” Cas said.
Dean glared, feeling a bit tired of hearing that from supernatural entities with less-than-pure motives.
Nope, just your life!
“I can’t believe you’re alive,” he said. “I thought Alastair had you for sure.”
“Hey,” Dean said, smiling wider. “Catch.”
“Well, in a way,” Cas said. “You’ll see.”
“This is a trap,” Dean said.
Dean had a lot of experience with being trapped by supernatural entities much more powerful than he, but that didn’t mean that he was good at handling it, especially knowing what he knew about Sam. He wasted the first hour or so running around the room, looking for an exit he knew he would never find. He wasted the second and third hours being deliberately silent, glaring at the pristine white walls as if they were Zachariah, challenging them in a battle of wills. He wasted the fourth hour kicking the walls and yelling at Zachariah, screaming for him to come back and partake in some hand-to-hand combat, like a real man. During the fifth hour, he tried a tactic he’d never been able to use in hell.
GABRIEL
CASTIEL
“Goodnight, Dean,” Cas said, watching the door to Dean’s room close behind him. It was still early, so Cas guessed that Dean wouldn’t go to sleep for several hours yet.
The body that a senior demon had put the soul in suddenly stiffened, its eyes lighting up blue. Dean stepped back reflexively, pointing the axe he was holding at it. Nothing like this had ever happened, and Dean didn’t know what the protocol was. Nor had he ever seen anything with eyes that color -- black and yellow, sure, but never such a glowing, celestial blue.
took you so long?”
need my help,” Gabriel said.
GABRIEL
“Do you have a pen and paper?” Dean said. It took him a few tries to get the words out -- his voice wasn’t working completely right, probably because he hadn’t had a drink of water in around a century.
Sam shouted in frustration, clearly no longer used to demons using him as a toy after whatever “training” he had been doing with Ruby. Alastair turned back to Dean, licking his lips, and Dean felt his blood run cold, so cold that even the hot anger coursing through his veins was forced to take a backseat to fear.
, Sam?” Dean said, the familiar need to chide his brother for doing stupid shit returning instantly.
“And Cas,” Jo said.
“No, I was hoping you could come help,” Sam said.
“Okay, it’s like this,” Dean said. “I haven’t been able to figure out, since I got here, if this is real or not. Everything about it seems real, except for the fact that it
“But now you do,” Dean said.
“Hey, did you know that
Well, he’d see it more as breaking his chain to Lucifer and restoring the world to its natural order, but, yeah, it should accomplish the same thing. Really, raising Death could be Lucifer’s greatest mistake. Could actually lead to his downfall, if you take advantage of it.
No, not Castiel, he’s just a front. God, could you
It had gotten dark by the time Sam and Ruby arrived. Disoriented and not used to afternoon naps, Dean struggled back into consciousness. Cas seemed to not have the same problem, snapping back up as if in an exaggerated wakefulness designed to mock Dean.
“That’s why you need alcohol,” Dean said, getting the attention of the bored-looking bartender and ordering a pitcher of beer. He steered them towards a corner booth and sank into it, Cas taking the seat across from his a little more tentatively. The bartender dropped the pitcher of beer off with hardly a second look.
“Anything could have--” Bobby began.
to,” Dean said. “I only kiss people who want to kiss me.”
“Now, Cas,” Dean said, continuing to give gentle, teasing licks up and down Cas’s length, “You’ve gotten lucky. I’m pretty good at this, so you just go crazy, all right?”
“We believe that Lucifer has located his true vessel,” Zachariah plowed on, with the tone of a frustrated professor who had given the same lecture dozens of times already. “Did you know that more powerful angels have less options for vessels? For me, this middle-aged salesman was one choice of several. For Michael and Lucifer, only humans from very specific bloodlines can sufficiently contain their power. Lucifer is closing in on his, so Michael must also find his. He remains in heaven as we speak, amorphous and unable to fight on earth.”
“Your dumb little powers won’t work on Alastair,” Dean said dismissively. Sam was constantly bringing his "powers" up, and looking at Dean like he was expecting him to start yelling at him just for
“Of course,” Castiel said with a smile.
“I don’t have any wrapping paper,” Cas realized suddenly.
“No,” Cas said. “But most angels aren’t so sympathetic towards a boy with a demon best friend and demon blood in his own veins.”
“Hey, Cas, look, they have free popcorn,” he said, taking off for the popcorn machine immediately.
“Amen, sister,” said Dean, who was lounging against a large cushion he’d pulled off the couch.
“She’s helping me,” Sam said haltingly, clearly still shocked. Turning back to her, he said, “Ruby, maybe you should get out of here for a second.”
“Oh,” Cas said, stepping back. “My apologies.”
.  “High-powered demons rarely kill each other without reason,” he said slowly. “Of course we want the adversary dead, but we know they’re planning something, something significant enough that my kind has been ordered to walk the earth for the first time in centuries. But we don’t know
“Are you kidding?” Dean said. “Needlessly extravagant parties have huge potential for fun. Can I talk in a fancy accent the whole time? Can we engage in aggressive PDA and make the rest of your department jealous?”
“Was this plan made during your cute little sleepover?” Gabriel said. It wasn’t his custom to get up before midday, but clearly the opportunities to bother Castiel were making the early start worth it in his eyes.
“Sam owes us so big for this,” Jo said, collapsing gracelessly to the floor. “This girl better be the freakin’ Queen of England, after all this effort.”
“Great,” Dean said. “So we can do whatever we want, right? We should do something fun if we’re going on a death mission tomorrow. What do you want to do?”
“Now they're correct,” Castiel said. Dean reached up to feel his left arm, where the handprint was, and noticed that it was still there. He tried to think of a non-accusatory way to ask Castiel why he hadn’t healed that particular scar, but his brain wasn’t moving as fast as he thought it used to, his first time on earth.
“Don’t,” Cas said. “Just… it was jarring to watch you die. That’s all.”
“It’ll hardly affect us,” Dean said. “I’m sure it’s barely alcoholic.”
“Are you sure?” Dean said, his eyes already falling shut of their own accord.
“Fast at what, Cas?” Dean said, his voice breaking slightly. “There’s nothing else I can do. I… I’m not strong enough. I can’t go to hell again.”
“Nah,” Dean said, looking right back. “It’s just… I guess I’m used to being the one saying that line.”
Sam scoffed. “You don’t understand Ruby, and you’ve never even tried to.”
Picking Cas only prolongs the inevitable.
They walked through the remainder of the party like little children with a horribly disguised secret. A lot of people had left, but their friends were still in the living room for the most part, Gabriel having moved on to torturing Benny, Sam sitting next to Charlie and letting Jess sleep on his shoulder, Kevin Tran still dancing around like a hyperactive hamster.
- Dean went to hell to save a brother whose name he forgot around year eighty-eight.
“Then you’ll need a plane ticket to Boston,” Cas said. “I hope you’re not tired of needlessly extravagant parties, either, because my attendance at the university’s New Year’s party is allegedly required.”
“Again?” Dean said.
,” Dean said, shooting him a glare. “I was going to say pep talk. Don’t need one. I know what I am, and it’s fine.”
need to be careful.”
But miraculously, Dean seemed to find it funny. He started laughing again, and Cas started laughing along with him. The tension was still there, but it had gotten friendlier.
“Yes,” several people said, in tones varying from pitying to condescending.
Of course it had already occurred to Dean that he should try to find Sam. In fact, a deeply forgotten part of Dean’s brain had started screaming
“Oh,” giggled Lisa. “Sorry. This isn’t the bathroom. Carry on.”
“We’d just bring you back,” Zachariah said.
“Yeah, I’m back,” Dean said.
“I don’t catch your drift, no,” Cas said, loosening his tie. His hair was disheveled, his eyes were crinkled in the lasting smile of the very intoxicated, and his tone of voice was somehow lower and more alluring than usual. He had never seemed more human than he did in that moment, with his socked feet on the dirty motel floor, two layers of jackets discarded, and his drunken hands trying to pull off his tie.
“I should leave now,” Cas said, eyeing the door with a slightly panicked glimmer in his eyes. “I’ve been gone too long already. But I can ward you against any other angels with Enochian symbols, if you'd like.”
“I can see the future, Dean,” he said. “That’s what’s going to happen. Would you really rather become a prince of hell than say yes to Michael and usher in an age of paradise?”
“Whose orders?” Dean said. The invisible wall hadn’t let up yet, but Dean was feeling more desperate to break free as Alastair got closer to his brother.
One night, after Dean had just finished a case in rural Georgia, he received a distraction in the form of a phone call. He had been hovering unpleasantly on the edge of sleep for a few hours, so reached out quickly to answer with only mild annoyance.
GABRIEL (con't)
“I don’t lie to you,” Dean lied.
This is a dirty joke.
“Then I guess we’ll have to be fast,” Cas snapped.
“It’s nice that he cares so much,” Cas said. “This may be our most Christmas-y Christmas yet.”
“We should probably try to do something
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, GABRIEL? WHY DID YOU PUT ME IN THIS STRANGE BODY? SHE CANNOT CONTAIN ME FOR LONG. I DO NOT CARE FOR THIS FARCE.
“Hey, we can’t just take that weirdo’s word for it, right?” Dean said. “He was saying all kinds of crazy shit back there. Like, who’s Michael? What’s that about?”
Sam also ended up causing his fair share of tense moments, surprisingly. The sparse, poorly fleshed-out Sam from Dean’s memories was basically a saint, hanging onto Dean’s every word, always making the morally correct decisions, and smarter than Dean, to boot. Dean had to wonder if his memory was faulty, or if Sam had just gotten stupider since Dean had been gone. The kid trusted Ruby to a truly incomprehensible degree, despite Dean’s constant dissent, and snuck out (presumably to see her) at least once a week. Arguably even worse than the sneaking and the lying was the fact that Sam was so bad at hiding it. Had he always been so transparent?
, Dean,” Sam said, for the upteenth time. “You can’t say no to an
“Yes, that’s what that means,” Dean said.
“He might not have known we’d be
The place was gaudy and visibly grimy, making it inherently familiar to Dean. Room 34 was at the very end of the hall, slightly more private than all the others. Dean knocked loudly on the door, half expecting no one to answer, but the door was quickly opened by a pretty brunette girl.
They pulled up to the drive to see a concerned-looking Bobby Singer and a deeply frazzled Sam trying to hang up Christmas lights. Bobby was on the ground looking up as Sam tangled a large string of white lights atop a tall ladder.
“Well, you’ve forgotten Gabriel, but as he is currently attempting to seduce your brother, I feel that you might be off the hook for that one,” Cas said.
“I want to be with you, Dean,” Cas said. “I haven’t dated anyone seriously since I’ve known you not because I don’t want to date at all, but because I only want to date
“You have to say yes to me,” Michael said, smiling kindly. “You can’t return to hell, Dean. You won’t survive the journey, and you will only suffer for attempting it.”
“Lots,” Dean said.
“Me and you,” Gabriel filled in cheerfully. Castiel could almost
“Rendezvous, now,” Sam said over the phone, sounding depressed. “I think I figured it out. I told Bobby what I know, he’s looking into my theory.”
“I found out what the plan is,” Cas said, looking away. “It’s not good, their plan. We need another one. So, we find God, and get him to stop Lucifer.”
SAM/LUCIFER
“How do you have so much shopping to do?” Jo said. “How many people do you even know?”
“Dean and Charlie, you’re in charge of the tree,” Sam said.
As they finished removing the dust and dead spiders from the room Charlie would be claiming (and shoving the actual important things Bobby would yell at them for throwing away into the closet or under the bed), Castiel was filled in on the plan for the next few days. It appeared that Jessica, Sam’s girlfriend of a year, wanted to be with him on Christmas, but couldn’t be away from her family for the entire time. Therefore, she was arriving on Christmas Eve, giving them one more full day to get everything ready for her arrival. This, the 22nd, was reserved for removing and hiding as many concerning or incriminating items as possible. Tomorrow, the 23rd, would be for going into town, finishing Christmas shopping, and the purchasing and setting up of as many Christmas decorations as the house could realistically be expected to contain. Christmas Eve itself would be when Sam was scheduled to have a mental breakdown when the place inevitably still didn’t look half as nice as Jess’s parent’s house.
“Sammy,” he said, shaking him gently. “Sammy, we need to get out of here.”
“Lilith?” Dean said, wondering if he was remembering correctly. “Like, sent-me-to-hell Lilith? The Lilith Sam's been trying to find for months?”
“How soon Cas forces Dean to get a cat?” Sam said. “Which last name they decide to take?”
A month or so after the Samhain incident, Castiel returned to talk to Dean, again while Sam was conveniently out with Ruby.
“Okay, fine, Dean and Cas, you can get the tree,” Sam said. “Then do your gift shopping
No! I mean, yes I am, but no, I’m not willing to fight either of my brothers. That’s just not
that John brought up Sammy, we can segue into you getting yelled at for allowing your brother to become Lucifer’s true vessel, won’t that be fun? Do you want to get us started off with that?”
Two black-clad demons cut into Sam’s arms at the same time, collecting the blood into two identical glass vials. Dean rushed forward on impulse, desperate to try to revive his brother, but three demons came from behind him to hold his arms back, leaving him flailing.
“It’s not Dad,” Dean said, taking another turn with the binoculars. “I don't think Dad's in there. It’s just Alastair. But... he’s in Dad.”
“Any of these could be simple possessions,” Sam said, rifling through a local newspaper. They were at the only diner they’d been able to find in town, sipping coffee and trying to act like federal agents off duty.
“Is that right?” Cas said.
“And even if you did want that,” Dean said, finally turning to face Cas. “If you did want that, I told him that after nearly twenty fucking years I wasn’t about to have our first kiss be this awkward, forced moment in the middle of a bunch of other people. Not after we successfully dodged having it be in that gross-ass closet in college.”
“Some people prefer sharp blades,” Alastair said, thick spit dripping down his face. He didn't even bother to wipe it off. “I think blunt blades are so much more fun, though. Takes more time. Really lets you
With a final burst of strength, Dean burst through the wall and sent himself flying into Alastair. His advantage was that Alastair was clearly not ready for the tackle, falling right over and taking Dean with him. His disadvantage was that Alastair played dirty and quickly had him pinned against the floor with the help of his demonic influence. He put the blunt blade to Dean’s throat. Distantly, Dean heard Sam yelling.

In fact, these researchers had worked closely with my clients in the past, so there was truly no excuse for the oversight. Two--”
by the sensation that Dean didn’t even have to pretend -- he barely even noticed the taste, and Cas’s possessive hand behind his head was strangely arousing.
“Probably better smell,” Dean said. “Bobby’s place hasn’t smelled good in decades. I know for a fact that Sam’s buying a metric shit-ton of candles, but they can only do so much.”
“Of course,” Cas said. “It’s your room.”
What’s a fantasy suite?
“Very good,” Dean said, leaning in to kiss him again.
“Do you think Sam wants a Douglas Fir, or a Noble?” Cas called after him.
“Again,” Sam said, turning to Cas and trying to win him over with a smile. “We really owe you, man.”
“Don’t know why he had to tattle to you,” Dean muttered.
And I didn’t see him, or hear of him? If it was this easy to raise Lucifer, why did it take so long?”

“Ah, this is your way of trying to seduce me, isn’t it?” Dean said, smiling salaciously. He knew he had Michael. “Do you know what me and Cas

Cas and Dean trudged downstairs to lend their support.
“How about this for Bobby?” Dean said, holding up a can of bear spray and giggling to himself. They had been doing this for a while -- seeing who could find the most absurd gift for the remaining people they needed gifts for.
“You start on the bows,” Cas said, wrestling with the horrible glittery wrapping paper they had been forced to buy.
Dean stood up blindly, and immediately fell onto a nearby object, vomiting uncontrollably. He pushed himself up again to see that he had just puked all over the impala, parked right where he had left it, as if nothing at all had happened.
“Hello, Dean,” the man said, his hands clasped primly together. “Are we having a little breakdown?”
Eventually, shivering slightly, they pulled apart. Dean started laughing.
a divine entity, need I remind you.”
“I knew it,” Dean said.
“I told you, I never needed to,” Cas said, shrugging impatiently out of his shirt.
Sometimes, when Dean looked into Cas’s eyes for long enough, he swore he could see them swirling, swirling with the same blue light of the angel’s true form. Tonight, he could nearly see the tension in the angel’s eyes, as the moment lengthened. Dean licked his lips subconsciously.
“Kiss without tongue?” Cas said.
“Were you sleeping, Dean?” Cas said. He was looking out the window, out towards the dark junkyard. Dean checked the time -- nearly three AM.
“I might have an idea,” he said.
like my new boss’s, you know. It’s really quite poetic how that happened.”
“We should turn in, too,” Dean said. “Sam has a truly alarming amount of things planned for tomorrow.”

“You are a clever man, Dean Winchester,” Cas said.

to impress her. Cas could tell that affection was underneath his every complaint, though, so he guessed that Jess was probably as great as Sam was making her out to be, and worth the effort.
“I got it, Cas,” Dean breathed, pulling back to jack him quickly, as Cas appeared to be rapidly losing his rhythm.
Guess again.
“The angel of, yes,” Sam said.
“Come
“Siobhan Flannigan, this is the FBI,” Dean called. “We had a few questions relating to the disappearance of your son.”
“You can tell me later,” Ruby said, slipping away.
“I need to go speak with someone,” Cas said. “Be very cautious until my return.”
“I AM MICHAEL,” the voice said slowly, dragging out each syllable to be unnaturally long. “YOU ARE MY EARTHLY FORM, DEAN WINCHESTER. I HAVE WATCHED YOU FOR ALL YOUR YEARS. I KNOW IT TO BE TRUE.”
Dean swore to himself and threw his phone across the room, breaking it against the motel wall. It was stupid to throw a phone against a wall, stupid and pointlessly destructive, but then again, so was life, so why should Dean fight the urge to destroy? He’d fought it for his entire past life, and he’d gone to hell for all his troubles.
“She is a very interesting person,” Cas said, unsure where this was going.
“What happens now?” Cas asked, letting his head fall onto Dean’s chest.
“Hold up,” Dean said, sitting up all the way. “Cas, you thinking what I’m thinking?”
It turned out that the only way to handle the demon ghosts was to exorcise them, which would have been all well and good if they would have all just let themselves be herded into the giant devil’s trap Dean had made. Unfortunately, the demon ghosts seemed to delight in hiding in the most random of places, just out of range of where they’d be affected by an exorcism, and then jumping out and trying to kill Dean again just after he thought he’d finally gotten them all. Dean had gone through four rounds of exorcisms when Cas appeared, grabbing a ghost Dean had missed by its incorporeal hand and smiting it.
The guy flailed, eyes casting towards the landline on the wall. Dean picked up a nearby stapler and used it to smash the phone, and the guy let out a small whimper.
“Hmm,” Cas hummed again, sucking idly at Dean’s tip. “What if I just want to do this?”
“A divine entity who wants to fuck me, apparently,” Dean said, grinning.
“Oh, don’t worry about the Antichrist, Dean-o,” Alastair said. “It’s, er…” he glanced at the pot, holding up the Colt casually. “It’s too late for him. But it’s
“The ghost-demons can still kill people,” Dean said. “That not glamorous enough for you?”
He was mad all of sudden, mad that Sam had just expected him to pick up where they left off before hell, mad that Sam couldn’t understand that things could change, mad that Sam had been choosing a demon over him this entire time all while trying to make it Dean’s fault. He hadn’t called Sam in days by this point, and now that he was finally talking to him, he was longing to be alone again for some reason. How he could be lonely in one moment and furious at his brother the next, Dean wasn’t sure, but he was feeling an unignorable urge to burn it all down, to make Sam as mad as possible.

SAM/LUCIFER
What would John say about how Dean looked now? His upper body was covered with tattoos, his hair was growing longer, he had started wearing his protective charms around his neck again. John had teased him about them so mercilessly, claiming they looked like girly jewelry, that Dean had stopped wearing them and forgotten about them for years until, freshly back from hell, he’d found them tangled up in the back of the glovebox.
“Oh no,” Sam cut in. “Are we talking about law again?”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean said. He'd just been brushing his teeth, and put his toothbrush down and straightened up to meet the angel's eyes. “Got another town you’d like to smite?”
“Cas, you don’t have to,” Dean said, but when the other man wrapped his hand around him, Dean was unable to hide his positive reaction.
Cas let himself be dragged out of the motel room and onto the sparsely populated streets of the town. There wasn't much to see, but luckily, after a few minutes of walking, a mostly-empty bar appeared, run-down and with half its sign missing, but still unmistakably open.
“That was my true form,” Castiel said. “Being in hell grants you a rare opportunity to see it. Normally, humans can’t ever see what you just saw.”
Cas’s weird reaction aside, that had been a good day. Every time Dean managed to save someone, he felt like he was inching closer to evening the scale. He certainly wouldn't live long enough to actually atone for all the souls he'd damaged in hell, but as long as he was working on it, he was able to get through the day in one piece. So saving over a thousand people in one go let his conscious rest for a whole afternoon, during which he and Sam went to a pool hall (without Ruby, luckily), and dusted off their hustling skills. Sam had gotten much better during Dean’s time in hell. Dean had gotten much worse.

A demon who had been standing attentively at Alastair’s side came forward silently, showing him a fancy pocket watch. Alastair nodded.

“Of course I'll go with you,” Cas said.

“Next Christmas,” they said at the same time.
“Are you okay, Cas?” Dean said, trying for a gentler tone.
“Your lack of respect is appalling,” Zachariah hissed. “Did you learn insubordination from your rogue buddy Castiel, or were you born this way?”
person. It really was pathetic that despite all the people Cas had attempted to date in his twenties (before he’d given up and lost the will to date anyone besides Dean), a man who he’d technically never even kissed was still the man that he thought of the most.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ah, thanks,” Dean said, wiping it away. “I don’t
“Lie down,” he said softly. Cas protested at first, but seemed to understand when Dean bent to slowly unbutton each button on his dress shirt, looking into his eyes as he moved lower and lower. With his other hand, he reached down to the bulge in Cas’s slacks.
“Sexy Santa deserves to go front and center,” he loudly declared, hanging up the shirtless Santa in perhaps the most visible spot on the entire tree.
“At least you were
“He didn’t,” Cas said, forcing himself to sit up.
Sam looked uncomfortable at that, so Dean interrupted.
“Is it not just demons being demons?” Dean said, feeling a compulsive need to try to lighten up the situation even though it was glaringly obvious that the situation was not light and could not possibly be.
GABRIEL
Cas pushed open the door to his room, and was accosted by an alarming smell. He flipped on the aged light to see that the room, which had appeared so clean before, now had a heap of junk from the other rooms mysteriously piled onto the bed. Approaching the pile, Castiel noticed a dead mouse and what looked like the remnants of a stink bomb.
“Oh, no, don’t worry, Cas,” Dean said. “We can just say it was a one night stand. No hurt feelings whatsoever.” He held out his hands in an appeasing gesture.
“Um,” Cas said. “Am I allowed to leave this room now, or…?”
Cas mused, as Sam got up and walked away, leaving the door wide open behind him. Was that really such an option? He supposed it finally, kind of, was. He’d already experienced the rejection he’d been fearing for so long, so it was hard to imagine that anything else would be able to really hurt him.
“Fuck,” Dean said. “I thought if I lured him out--”
“Lights are up out there,” Dean said.

“I rebelled for

Who will this devastatingly handsome, morally gray young man pick? Will he succumb to the allure of Lucifer? Will he start feeling righteous again, and pick Michael? Or will he, masochistic as ever, attempt to pick Castiel, and remain human as the world slowly slides into decay? Stay tuned to find out.
“He escaped as well,” Cas said.
Dean pretended to discover the “case” to hunt Alastair on his own after Cas left and Sam and Ruby came back. Sam didn’t understand why they had to hunt Alastair, nor did he seem to have a good grip on who, exactly, Alastair was. But Ruby understood immediately, and tried to convince Sam that it was a bad idea to go after him. Hence, Dean and Ruby entered an awkward standoff in which they both pretended not to know the details of what was happening, as Sam wildly misinterpreted everything.
“Don’t injure yourself, my Lord,” Alastair said.
“Um, all of your family,” Cas said. His voice sounded weird, even to his own ears.
“Oh, you mean the apocalypse? What’s the point of that?” Gabriel said, his smirk faltering slightly. “It’s our whole plan, you know. Stage a Big Bad Apocalypse, pit Lucifer and Michael against each other, cause so much damage we force God to come out of hiding. You ask me, it’s not going to work, but why bother fighting it, you know? At the end of the day, I’m a bleeding heart. I just want my siblings to get along, and if having a
“Were you going to say chick flick moments?”
“Hey,” Dean said, sparing a glance over at him. “I guess you might not know me that well yet, but I kind of specialize in stopping things that should be impossible to stop. Screw Gabriel, screw God. We’ll figure it out.”
Cas sighed, and moved to stand directly across from Dean and Sam. “You may want to sit down for this,” he said, gesturing at the bed.
I’d certainly say that it does! Now, why don’t we jump right into the Fantasy Suites portion of this week, starting with our front-runner, Castiel?
“That does look lovely,” Cas said, looking at Dean’s work. “Maybe you should have been the one to do the wrapping.” His own most recent attempt was looking more like a blob than anything else, with the
“We would like to know that, as well,” Cas said. “The cause of death has been impossible to ascertain, but after investigation, we have a lead on who we believe did this.”
“Guests?”
“Hell,” Castiel said.
The doors opened again, this time smashing against the warehouse walls without so much as a touch, and Alastair strode confidently through them. Sam started to say something, but Alastair just rolled his eyes and flung him against a nearby tree, where he slumped to the ground, knocked out. Dean heard something crack, and hoped Sam hadn’t broken anything major.
“Of course there’s a reason, Cas,” Dean snapped.
“We should play a drinking game,” Gabriel suggested.
“Now’s good for what?” Cas said, smiling devilishly.
Around them, the other demons were moving, some just acting as a wall and others moving around the other hostages, drawing on the ground and carving into their skin.
You really expect me to just believe you that Sammy turned, without any proof?
Sam raised an eyebrow.
“You want to be with me?” Cas said, his brain short-circuiting.
MICHAEL
“The top part should be okay to leave off,” Dean said.
“Cas is here!” she said.
Date card…? Oh, god.
“It just usually has a different implication,” Dean tried to explain.
Oh, Dean, of course I do. I want you to say yes to Michael. Until I defeat him in combat, he’ll never see that my way is the right way. He’ll never stop trying to destroy me. I wish he could see reason, but he can’t, so unfortunately, you have become a very important puzzle piece. I need you to fall into place. Can you do that for me?
