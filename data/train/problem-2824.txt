“Oh, Dean,” Charlie says sadly, looking up at him with wide, green, tear-filled eyes.

Castiel bites the inside of his lips to try and stifle the grin that threatens to erupt at Dean’s last few messages.  It’s not fair for someone to be
Still grinning, Dean’s only answer is to pull Cas back down on top of him, capturing his mouth in another kiss.
the LARPing buddy I wanted to set you up with last year.  You know, to which you replied, ‘Charlie, you can’t just set me up with the one other gay man—”
“Jessica,” Cas greets, moving in to claim his own hug and actually ending with a kiss to her cheek, the smooth bastard.  Since when does Castiel, Angel of the Lord, give

Hearing Cas unknowingly echo CJ’s words from the night before he started work at the coffee shop had felt like a sign from the heavens. It was almost two months ago now, but few enough people have expressed their faith in Dean over the years that he’s damn well gonna remember it when someone does. When he found Cas staring at him like he was about to move in for a kiss, well, Dean wanted it, but it wasn’t Cas he wanted it from. He knew then that as long CJ is in the (metaphorical) picture, there’s no way he could ever start anything with Cas. It wouldn’t be fair to any of them.
The kiss is soft and brief.  When Dean pulls away, he looks at Castiel, who asks, “What?”
At first, Castiel had wondered why Raphael had appeared in the form of a vessel...and not his True Form, until he realized the archangel must not have had a choice. He isn’t sure if angels and demons here are limited to the form they died in by the nature of this place or if it’s something The Shadow does intentionally, to keep them feeling small and powerless. If it’s the latter, he supposes it might be effective for angels like Raphael, though it won’t have much impact on Castiel.
, Dean. Money’s not everything. Especially not to Cas. The scandal gave him the push he needed to leave, but the truth is, he’s not meant for that world. Never was. He needed a chance at a different kind of life.”
to do. He hadn’t given the kitten a name. Names are permanent. Names imply belonging.
“Keep this nearby in case we need more,” he advises.  Cas nods and sits the bottle next to him, where it won’t be in the way, but will still be in easy reach.
Dean whimpers.  Fucking bendy-yoga-sex-god is going to kill him.
“Yeah, I know,” Dean says defensively once he finally lets go. “Just don’t be gone too long, okay?”
“I won’t,” he says with a smirk, “as long as you don’t give me reason to.”
Missouri waits.
That’s all we’re ever going to be.” Castiel tries to keep his voice from sounding as bitter and brittle as he feels.
Cas nods shakily as they each wipe at their tear-stained faces. “And we should spend time with Jack. Unfortunately, he won’t be staying. Though I have convinced him that occasionally visiting his parents doesn’t count as ‘interference.’”
Looking between Dean and the scattered mess around her, Claire reaches one chubby fist toward Dean, opening it to reveal a gummy Cheerio.
Castiel continues working through the rush, taking orders and serving Dean’s pastries as Linda makes a steady stream of lattes, macchiatos, and cappuccinos next to him. They’ve only been selling Dean’s baked goods for a couple of weeks now, but it’s clear that the new additions to their menu are very much appreciated by their clientele. Mornings are always busy for a coffee shop, of course, but they’re easily selling double the number of pastries they used to sell with their coffee and though Castiel rarely works the afternoon and evening shifts any more since he starts work at four in the morning with Dean, the numbers tell him they’ve seen a big uptick in business during those hours as well.
Chuck’s face darkens. “Ah, yes. The bastard child of my two subpar creations: humanity and angels. I hear it’s the desire of every parent that they not outlive their child. It’s not really a sentiment I ascribe to personally, of course, but what kind of benevolent God would I be if I didn't oblige my children?”
As always, a huge thank you to beta extraordinaire,
Dean’s been at the coffee shop for nearly a week when a familiar red head of hair bounces through the doorway and spreads her arms wide.
“That’s good,” Castiel says, clearing his throat.  “I miss her so much.”
Dean closes his eyes against the truth in those words. Cas’ love for Dean might have given him  new life, but it’s a life Dean was careless with.
“Oh, I… um, sorry. Of course.” Cas blushes his time as he steps out of the way and motions for Dean to come in. “I apologize, Dean,” he says as he leads the way down the narrow hallway and out into the shop, “I didn’t mean to…” Cas trails off, seeming to second-guess whatever he was going to say, replacing it with, “I’m useless before coffee.”
“Are we gonna talk about how many Taylor Swift songs you know, Winchester?”  Claire counters and Dean can actually
“I’ve got you, Sweetheart.”  Dean tightens his loose grip on Cas cock slightly as he inserts the tip of a finger into Cas’ entrance.  Cas starts to tense up, but Deans soothes him back down.
Indeed, they will be staying home for Christmas this year, especially with Sam and Jess’ eight-month-old, Ella, to think about. While Dean is a little sad they won’t be able to fulfill their annual Christmas tradition of gorging themselves at Bobby and Ellen’s, he’s still incredibly excited for the holiday. After all, this is his first official Christmas as Claire’s dad.
to an accounting position. Best part is, that’s probably what kept him out of jail when it all went belly up. He was far enough removed from the top that the investigators could believe he didn’t know anything.”
“Sorry there, kiddos! The Xerox is down and it’s made my life one big poop storm this morning! Now, who’s got the answer to question one?”
Dean jerks upward, nearly braining himself on the dryer he’d been reaching into, when he feels the sudden press of his husband’s denim-clad erection against his ass.
Dean explains the box and rice-sock arrangement to CJ, who approves.
Ignoring the unspoken jab at his sacrifice, Castiel stares at her expectantly. “And now that you’ve got me here...are you finally going to tell me how to kill Chuck?”
Suddenly, the God trap springs back into place, white-hot grace racing across the burnt ground. Jack’s own power settles, the pain of trying to hold back Chuck’s onslaught on his own easing enough for him to look up.
“Caaaas. I’m bored,” Dean whines, lying across the sofa with his feet propped up on his not-boyfriend’s lap.
“So, whether you want to call it a friendship or a relationship or something else, I’ve been committed to you for quite some time. And during that time, that commitment has been...tested. Many times.”
Crowley steps squarely into Winchester’s space and somehow manages to look down at the man despite a 4-inch height disadvantage.  His tone goes from cool to icy,
“Looks like my ride is here,” she says to Sam as she pulls out her phone. Sure enough, she has a text message from Stevie: “In the car. Charlie on her way in.”
“Why?” inquires Sam with a tilt of his shaggy head.  “You don’t think he’s interested?”
smiling fondly at Castiel as he sighs and picks up yet another paper to grade.
The part of Betty that remembers being just a lowly reaper and not the embodiment of eternal demise startles involuntarily as amber eyes that shouldn’t be able to see her bore into her anyways. She lets out a huff of irritation, partially at the angel, but mostly at herself. Uppity flyboy.
Dean scoffs. “You mean do I miss coming home alone to my shitty one bedroom apartment? Uh, no.”
“Creating
Flashing her gummy baby grin, his baby declares, “Da!” She reaches for Castiel, who scoops her into his arms, puckering his lips as she lays a slobbery, open-mouthed, “kiss” on them.
And now. I truly hope you enjoy this extra long (and that's not
anything. Not really. CJ is just his friend. His incredibly sweet, somewhat socially awkward friend that has no idea what he probably thinks are just honest and straightforward observations happen to be some of the sweetest, most romantic shit anyone’s ever said to Dean. Especially anyone who wasn’t actively trying to get in his pants. And he definitely has no idea the mess that’s making of Dean’s head.
Sam’s eyes go almost comically wide, if anything about this could be fucking comical. “Right,” he breathes.
Rushing to the door, Castiel feels a surge of disappointment when he looks out the peephole to see an empty hallway.  Just to be certain, he cautiously opens the door and steps out into the hall, sagging in relief as he sees Dean sitting slumped against the wall next to his door.
“But what about CJ?” Sam hisses in a whisper that Dean is certain can probably be heard in the next trailer over, let alone the bathroom several yards away. “Are you two really over? The way you talked about him, Dean, I really thought you guys had something. You’ve
Cas’ eyebrows shoot up in pleased surprise as Dean sinks to his knees on the cold tile floor. He’s going to regret this when he’s back on the ice running training drills tomorrow morning, but for now, there’s nowhere else he’d rather be. Widening his stance, Cas uses both hands to grip the black-streaked marble behind him. Smirking, Dean slowly unties the drawstring on Cas’ sleep pants before lowering the elastic waistband. His mouth waters and he bites his lip to hold back a groan at the way Cas’ heavy, more-than-half-filled cock bobs free between them, lilting slightly to the left, conveniently angled toward Dean’s lips. A few firm strokes from Dean’s right hand brings Cas to full hardness with Dean smirking up at him from below.
Mouth dropping open and not taking his eyes off the screen, Ash smacks them both on the shoulder and gestures frantically at the monitor.  They nod, seeing exactly what he means.
“Right. So, I guess I better not waste any more time, huh?” Dean breathes deeply. “Better say it now...in case I don’t get another chance.”
, which makes Dean laugh as he recounts his and Cas’
under the influence of pain meds.  See you later, Dean!” Jessica smiles at Castiel and waves at her future brother-in-law as she exits the room with substantially less drama than Gabriel had.
Sighing, he fills the coffee filter with the heavenly smelling grounds of his favorite brand, one of the few areas in his life in which Dean doesn’t skimp, pinch pennies, or compromise. He’s been surviving mornings on coffee since he was nine-years-old (thank you to the excellent parenting skills of John Winchester) and he’s had enough shitty, off-brand motel coffee to last him a lifetime. So yeah, coffee is the one good thing in his life Dean allows himself to have without guilt or regret. Well, coffee…and now Cas.
Charlie sighs. “Fair point. Well, maybe he’ll come back into the pet store and I can put in a good word for you.”
“Don’t talk about Fight Club?”
idea. Sure, Dean had been planning to ask him out too, but the fact is, CJ had done it first. He asked Dean out, then stood him up. It doesn’t make any sense. Naturally, he’s gone through all the worst-case scenarios: maybe CJ was hurt. Maybe he’d been in a car accident. Or maybe he’d fallen down the stairs and broken both arms. Or maybe it was even worse.
He’s been around for her last two Christmases, of course, but those were different. That first year, he and Cas were just friends, albeit friends who were stupidly in love with one another. Last year, Christmas arrived shortly after Dean had moved into Cas’ apartment. Things were great and they both knew they were in this for the long haul, but they hadn’t actually talked about what Dean’s role was in regards to Claire. Cas had made Dean Claire’s primary emergency contact at daycare though, replacing Gabe’s name with his, and Dean had thought that pretty much said everything he needed Cas to say on the subject. He was content.
good boy.  Cas had been solid and heavy in his mouth and tasted salty on his tongue and Dean fucking loved every goddam minute of it, because the sounds Cas made as Dean had inexpertly sucked him were out of
He looks back at Dean, only to find Dean’s eyes already on him.  His green eyes glow in the dim light coming from the twinkle lights behind them and Castiel’s breath catches in his throat.
To the amazing
“I...hadn’t really thought about it like that.” Huh. Betty hadn’t thought that brow could furrow any deeper. Good thing this kid doesn’t have to worry about age lines.
“Why don’t you just pay attention
Dean blinks. “You speak
“That would never happen,” Dean answers immediately.
“Cas isn’t some kind of rebound is he?”
Thankfully, Coach keeps it short. As much respect as Dean has for the man, neither of them really seem to know what to say to the other when Coach isn’t calling him a princess or prom queen (or, on one memorable occasion, a quinceñara) and asking him if this is his first day playing hockey. Plus, Coach seems a little nervous under the watchful, hawk-like eye of his pseudo-mother, a sentiment Dean can wholeheartedly sympathize with, but finds entertaining nonetheless.
“This might be hard for you to believe,” New-Billie snarks back, “but this song isn’t actually about you.”
for their actions, like any well-written character. Most need to feed to survive. Some are driven by a quest for vengeance. Leviathan crave power...order and authority with their own vicious twist. But these...the Shedim. They hurt, and rape, and kill...and not necessarily in that order...just for the pleasure of it...the carnal satisfaction. When I created them, I thought that was too simple...too boring. But now...now I can appreciate the terrible purity of it. Magnificent.”
“What does he do?” Dean asks, more because he wants to learn as much as he can about Cas’ history, not because he actually gives a damn about Douchey McDickface and his career.
Even more powerful than the first, the second blast rips the hunter and angel apart, throwing them both to the ground, several feet from their original positions. Castiel would think they were experiencing an earthquake, if such a natural phenomenon could make the very air vibrate with menace.

“Relax for me, sweetheart. I’ve got you,” Dean croons in his ear and he does.

His asshole husband just chuckles quietly and pushes the door closed behind him before turning the lock and stepping into Dean’s personal space, reaching around Dean to run his hands across his still-bare chest and abs.
“I…oh,” comes the disgruntled response as Gravel Voice glances at Dean and then quickly looks away to turn the dial for his burner down from the high setting he’d used for boiling the water and butter to the medium-low it needs to be for cooking the flour paste. He and Dean both stare at the scorched pan, crispy brown lumps of flour sitting in far-too-little oily water, now that much of it has boiled away.
“It was good, man.  We’ve got a sweet little ’69 Sting Ray in the shop right now that’s gonna be a real looker when she’s done,” Dean says exuberantly, then drops his voice and adds, “I almost hope we’ll still be here then, just so I can see her all dolled up.”
There is more work to be done, but for now, your icing, flour, and glitter-covered author is ready with another chapter about these two idiots and their much more intelligent feline sidekick. Also, I'm really glad some of y'all don't have my home address, because I think glitter bombs were a real possibility after that cliff hanger! 😂
Cas gestures to the tv and Dean scoffs, “
Castiel had kept each answer as short and perfunctory as he could make them, and yet it felt like Missouri had read novels in each begrudging sentence.  The most difficult question to answer though, had come after Castiel was already feeling raw and drained from revealing far more in one sitting about his less than ideal childhood than he ever had before.
“Congratulations.  I’d hate to have to put you back in it if you hurt that boy of mine.”
Castiel is relaxing on a crisp fall night, floating above the pond on the outskirts of town, admiring the way the still water reflects the moon—an almost perfect match to the glowing orb above, and yet made from something entirely different—when the breeze finds him, carrying distant shouts and the acrid smell of scorched wood.  A growing sensation of dread rushes alongside Castiel as he follows the pungent draught. He stops short when he comes upon the Winchester house, alight with flames, their orange-red glow casting wicked shadows on the darkened earth.
Pulling his stained white apron over his head, he tugs his phone from the pocket of his jeans again to check his waiting messages from Sam.
“Castiel,” Dean says slowly.  “Awesome. So, where are we? I mean, I know where we are, but how?”
Though Castiel may not have a particularly...robust catalog of experience to draw from when it comes to kissing, he can’t help but think even if he did, kissing Dean would outshine them all. Dean manages to lead the kiss without making Castiel feel like he’s being pushed or rushed. He takes, but never more than Castiel has to give. And when it comes to giving...oh, does Dean
“Plus, since Alice in ONEderland,” she annunciates, holding up a finger to signal the number one, “is a popular first birthday party theme, you could always do that for her party and reuse her costume!”
Dean grins as Sam splutters, “Did Dean
“All I’m sayin’ is that Winchester’s hooked up with pretty much every single female teacher in the school, except for old Mildred Baker..”
“If you’re sure,” he replies uncertainly.

Castiel swallows.
“It’s a
“I feel human again,” he says to where he can see Donna’s silhouette on the other side of the white shower curtain.
Grinning, Dean traces and X over his heart with one finger, “Cross my heart.”
Thousands of nights with him aren’t going to be enough, Dean’s pretty sure.
He imagines being back in bed with Dean, this time with both of them undressed and Castiel not injured, but whole and healthy.
If it weren’t for the fact that Cas is both his boss and so far out of Dean’s league that attempting an actual conversation with the guy (one that doesn't revolve around baked goods at least) would be like showing up to the World Series with a Wiffle bat, Dean would be a fool
“Oh, so you
Cas licks choux-crumbs from his fingertips, humming happily.
uncomfortable Cas is feeling must be showing on his face because as the silence stretches on between them, Dean’s eyebrows seem to raise of their own accord and his expression slowly begins to shift into an amused smile.

“Hey now,” Dean whispers, looking up at the wilting branches.  “None of that. ‘S not your fault, Cas. It doesn’t matter what they say.  You’re the best damn thing about this place. You and Sammy.” The poplar leaves twitter with Castiel’s pleased embarrassment and Dean chuckles.
Looking up from his conversation with Eileen, Sam shrugs. “It seemed kind of...redundant, since Jack is sort of ‘in’ everything anyway.”
Not just a crush.
“I know…”
Dean lets out a whimper as Cas nips at his lobe before pulling away from the wall and taking Dean with him, his fingers hooked in the other man’s belt loops.  Pulling their hips flush together, he plies Dean with one more breath-stealing kiss before suddenly spinning him around by the hips and pulling the slightly taller man back against him.  Dean feels Cas’ lips hot on the back of his neck; Cas’ erection pressing firmly against his ass and he fights the urge to press back into it.
“Yeah, me too, Cassie,” Dean says, stopping and releasing his grip on Cassie’s waist.  Hands in his pockets, he offers her a smile of his own. “I’m sorry it’s over.”
“Can I ask you a question?” Dean interrupts his introspection, casting him a sideways glance as he shapes the beef into round, even patties.
you last night.” Dean pulls back slightly to admire a blooming bruise on Cas’ collarbone.  “And I think I need to fix that right goddamn now.”
“Mmhmm,” Bobby hums disbelievingly.
“How do we know you’re telling the truth?” Sam asks grimly. “I want Eileen back,” he takes a deep breath, “more than anything. But if you’re just using her to get me to cooperate...if you don’t come through...” Sam’s voice is iced steel when he answers, “It won’t just be some other Death’s memories of me killing you that you’ll have.”
Aching for his friend, Dean claps a hand on his shoulder and asks loudly, “Who’s ready for some barbecue?  I’m starving!”
“We were friends first, too,” she adds, “but then...”
before the intersection?”
which Castiel is fairly certain means Charlie has somehow managed to secure university funding for her own personal army of computer hackers. Right now it’s just her, a burnout genius named Ash, and some overly anxious freshman called Kevin Tran who’s nearly guaranteed to have a bleeding ulcer by his twenty-first birthday. Even so, Cas is a little terrified of what the three of them get up to during their monthly late-night meetings in Charlie’s off-campus rental house, surviving off energy drinks and Doritos as they steadily dismantle corporate America from the inside-out.

“Better now,” flirts Gabe shamelessly, “did you miss me?”
“—you know in Overland Park and expect that we’ll live happily ever after.  That’s not how life works,” she finishes in her best imitation of Castiel’s gravelly voice.
“It’s fine.” Jody rolls her eyes. “Bobby and Kaia are supervising.”
“You mean my True Form?” he asks and Dean seems to come back to himself, rolling his eyes.
to see Cas.  He needs the comfort of his best friend and he needs Cas to know how he feels about him.  Besides, if Cas is just going to shut him down again, might as well get all the rejection over with in one day.
This, though, this kiss had been something different, something unexpected. It was gentle and comforting and soft. It wasn’t a taking kiss, the kind with motive or intent, meant to seduce or tease.
Dean smiles.  Even if he doesn’t get to see Cas again, Dean’ll take any excuse to hang out with his little brother.
the idiotic smile creeping across his face, but he’ll be damned if he can help it.  He’s just so damn proud of Cas.  The guy has been through some real shit the past few months, but he’s worked so goddamn hard and Dean’s thrilled that it’s paying off.
Shaking his head, Dean looks between the two of them, “I swear, you two would starve without me.”
A large metal clang from above tells her she’s not about to find out right now, though and as expected, Jack cuts off as heavy footsteps sound on the stairwell across the open space.
He laughs when Cas pokes him in the side. “Dude. Don’t poke my love handles. Your freaking brother is making me fat. Is that your evil plan? Make me so fat no one else will want me?”
Crossing the room in long strides that look far more fluid than they did the last time Dean saw him, Cas presses a steaming mug of black coffee into Dean’s hands before taking a step back to lean against the dresser that’s been moved back to this side of the room, since Cas no longer needs space next to his bed for a wheelchair or walker.
“This?” he asks the baby, dangling the shaker just out of reach.
Castiel shrugs. “Wasn’t my news to share.”
“In fact,” Crowley presses on, ignoring Dean’s contribution to their ‘conversation’ entirely, “it seems that sometimes you’re so tired you don’t even make it back to your hotel room at all and have to borrow someone else’s clothes in the morning.”
“Be right back,” he says, grimacing a moment later at the tacky come covering his stomach as he stands and walks to the bathroom, really glad they still have an hour or so before Sam gets home. After cleaning himself up, he leaves the bathroom to find Cas waiting for his turn.
Dean Winchester SENT:
Fortunately for Castiel, what shreds of dignity he has remaining to him are spared as Dean is distracted by the return of both Jessica and Gabriel, Jessica with a clipboard in her hand and Gabriel with a chocolate bar in his.
“Dean, stop hovering.”
Glancing at his reflection in the now spotless glass stovetop, Castiel grimaces.  Gabriel may have a point.  Claire is an excellent distraction when she’s home, but while she’s at daycare, he has nothing to keep his mind off his impending return to work.  He’s already scrubbed every kitchen surface within easy reach and had been debating the wisdom of attempting to get on his hands and knees to clean the oven when his phone rang.  A change of scenery for the evening might not be a bad idea.
As Claire spreads her homework out on the kitchen countertop, Dean begins chopping vegetables for tonight’s dinner.  He’s just finished frying up the ground beef and onions when he hears keys in the kitchen door.
“I should thank you, though. Your...confession—” She lets the word hang in the airless void between them. “—saved me the trouble of letting Dean kill me with my own scythe. Letting him strike me once was enough of a blow to my pride.”
Ellen raises an eyebrow at him.  “Ratty jeans with holes in the knees are
The two teachers exchange satisfied grins.
Dean clears his throat and turns toward Cas, a faint blush staining his cheeks, “Screaming baby or not, having dinner with one of my best friends and his awesome kid and then watching movies all night sounds like a pretty perfect Saturday night to me.”
“Dude. No,” he says, gesturing instead at Baby. If Dean’s having this conversation, he’s going to have it on his own fucking turf.
even, had tried to kill the man?  Dean hadn’t wanted him
Well, Dean can certainly do that.
“Aaaaaaaaack!”  Claire releases a sudden and shrill screech as she reaches from her highchair toward the dining room table, causing both men at the table to start violently.
“Hey there, princess,” Dean coos to the baby who seems uncertain about being in this near-stranger’s arms, “your Daddy needs you right now.”  Claire’s eyes light up as Dean resumes his position on the bed, depositing Claire between them.  She immediately crawls toward Castiel, giggling and cooing as she pulls herself up on her knees, chubby hands bracing herself on Castiel’s chest.
It turns out CJ is a huge
Frowning into his freshly poured cup of coffee, Dean reminds himself that he still doesn’t know what Cas’ plans are for after graduation. He knows that Cas doesn’t want to leave the Chicago area though, is afraid of starting over somewhere new. Starting over though, that’s something Dean excels at. God knows he’s had to do it often enough in his life. The only thing keeping him from applying for ME jobs in Chicago is the fact that Cas told him his own career prospects in the area are fucked thanks to his app-stealing dickbag ex-boyfriend.
Avoiding Dean’s eyes, he says quietly, “You can hardly be blamed for not seeing what was deliberately hidden from you.”
Abruptly, Missouri turns to face the neatly ordered shelves of pancake mixes and bottled maple syrups.  Boxes of Bisquick, Aunt Jemima, and Jiffy stare at them, Mrs. Butterworth judging Dean silently from her place of honor on the top shelf.
“I have to go see Dean,” Castiel attempts to rise to his feet, but is stopped abruptly by Jo’s hand on his sleeve, hauling him back down to his seat with surprising strength.
,” Dean grits out, “I just want everything to go well. That’s all.”
“What’s so funny?” Castiel asks, narrowing his eyes.
“Is a word in the English language, yes, though not one I generally choose to acknowledge, except of course, when it comes to the ladies,” Gabriel waggles his eyebrows theatrically, “in which case, no means no and consent is sexy.  Remember that Claire-Bear,” he says glancing at the toddler in his rearview mirror, who is contentedly flipping through the pages of a board book version of Pride and Prejudice.
“Did we break him?”  Charlie stage whispers to Gabriel, bringing Dean back to the present and startling a laugh out of him.
“Never,” Dean says automatically, then turns to face the TV so Cas won’t catch his blush, “So, uh,
“I have to go into the shop later today,” Cas answers, “But I don’t have anywhere to be this morning if you’re okay with me hanging around.” The hopeful look he’s giving Dean would be enough to make Dean change just about any plans he might have had.
to have that.”
“It’s... a lot,” Castiel settles on after a moment.
“As…generous as that is, you might be willing to make an exception, but I’m not.”
“Dean.” In response to the tug on his arm, Dean looks where Cas is pointing, seeing Baby parked on the road alongside the field, shining in the afternoon sun, ready to carry them back to the bunker.
back?” asks Cas.
Today, 9:19 PM
Castiel shakes his head, the lump in his throat making it impossible to talk.  He didn’t.  He didn’t believe Lydia, not really, but Dean will never believe that now.
“I heard Dean’s prayer,” Chuck answers simply and Dean feels his face heat as he remembers the prayer he made just last night, as he watched his husband sleeping peacefully in their bed, his angular features softened in the pale light of the moon through their bedroom window.
Dean snorts. “Pretty sure we’ve established that you’re the exception to all my rules, Cas.”
“And I think
Bobby snorts.  “Always do.  How else would I ‘ave survived bein’ married to you this long?”
-Ciara
Dean straightens up, clutching Claire to him with one arm, while swiping at his eyes with the other. “Well, we wouldn’t want that,” he counters weakly, “tears of blood might scare the kiddos.”
“I thought you’d never ask,” Cas quips. Dean would have a witty comeback for that, he swears, but it’s kind of hard to sass with someone’s tongue rammed down your throat. Instead, he focuses on kissing Cas back, giving as good as he’s getting.
“Yes.  I didn’t have childcare.  Thank you for making my appointments earlier.  I’m driving myself now, so it’s much easier to get here during the day, while Claire’s still at daycare.”
When the poplar leaves turn green and the summer grasses grow tall and wild on the hill, Dean spends nearly every day with Castiel.  Some days, it’s just Dean and Castiel and they fly Dean’s kites—Dean launching the kite in the air and tearing down the hill to create enough lift for the fabric to catch the wind and climb into the blue.  On days when the natural wind is lacking, Castiel helps, of course. Sometimes, Castiel takes the kite through impossible barrel rolls, twists, and rings while Dean cheers. Other times, Dean pulls on the kite’s string in a way that makes the kite do its own loops and dives and Castiel twines himself around the kite, dancing with it in the sky.  He isn’t sure which kind of day he likes the best.
Dean turns from the TV as Netflix switches to the next episode, the familiar theme song playing in the background.
Shrugging, Cas explains, “Sam’s fiancee, Eileen, has a gluten allergy. Dean’s doing cupcakes so he can make a gluten-free recipe for her and other flavors for everyone else. I’m not sure which though. Apparently Sam is being ‘an indecisive pain in the ass.’” After vegan-Madison and nut-allergy-Jess, Dean’s become rather skilled at adapting his recipes for diverse dietary needs. He has a feeling, however, that unlike the others, Eileen’s presence in their lives isn’t going to be outlived by her menu additions.
And Dean is happy.
, Cas,” Dean whispers. “I love you too. I promise you I do.”
“Yeah. Yeah I do, Cas. I just fucking
He looks back up at Cas and waits for his response. When Cas nods in understanding, Dean takes a deep breath. He closes his eyes to steady himself briefly before opening them back up and looking Cas in the eyes. “Cas, I love you,” Dean says quietly. “You gotta know I love you too.”
Castiel died thinking Dean didn’t love him too.
“I’m not going anywhere,” Castiel says softly, sitting next to Dean on the edge of the bed.
Cas. I’m your best friend you ass! You- you can’t just tell me you love me, immediately die and leave me alone, and then not fucking
, it says in softly glowing neon cursive above the building.
Maybe it does. Maybe the reason he feels so empty is because his heart somehow breaks a little more every time he thinks of Cas.
He stares at Castiel, who frowns and steps inside, moving his grocery bags to one hand and closing the door behind him with his other. “Dean?”
“I’m well aware of that fact,” Cas responds, a small smile on his lips. Smartass. “Jack got me out.”
“It’s alright, Dean,” Cas says, cutting him off
Cas’ hands come up, cupping Dean’s face. They ground him, steady him. Cas is here, and he’s
Jenna nods. “Just give me a call when you’re ready, hun,” and then she’s gone.
, but Dean can’t be mad at it. He just needs to keep going.
One of his ribs definitely feels like it’s broken, and it hurts to just breathe, but all Dean can think about is how peaceful Cas had looked as he stood there to leave Dean for good.
” Cas begins.
“I was able to fix your rib, but I- I’m low on grace. I can try to remove your fever though,” he says, standing up and coming closer.
Dean. You’re killing yourself,” his voice isn’t judgemental, just sad.
“Several weeks,” Cas responds and Dean starts.
“Dean-“ Cas starts.
He almost missed it, he was so lost in thought, and he barely caught the tail end of Jenna asking the stranger what she could “-get for you, dear?”
When Dean wakes up he sees Castiel sitting on the foot of his bed and starts to tear up automatically. “Fuck,” he curses under his breath.
And Dean’s not going to waste any more time.
He used to enjoy the taste of whiskey. Maybe he still does. But he never really lets himself taste it anymore. He drinks to get drunk, to feel the burn of it as it slides down his throat and to lose himself in the haze of alcohol as quickly as possible.
And then he gets angry.
He isn’t just talking about the food. Not anymore.
Not when Cas tilts his head slightly and their noses slide together until their lips finally meet. Dean sighs into the kiss and it feels like everything finally slots into place, the missing puzzle piece in Dean’s life where it belongs. Kissing Castiel feels like coming home.
Almost instantly, Cas is there, an arm wrapped around Dean’s waist and a hand on his shoulder, keeping him upright.
In a fit of anger, anger at himself, anger at God, anger at Billie, anger at the Empty, anger at Cas, anger at fucking
He begins to sob, the pounding of the rain outside and the booming of the thunder drowning out his pathetic noises of heartbreak as he mourns.
“Good,” Dean says, and then he reaches over with both hands, wrapping one around Cas’ arm and cupping the back of his neck with the other as he pulls his angel into a kiss.
He cuts off that train of thought with a scowl to himself.
“Cas, listen-” Dean began quietly.
“You were wrong, Cas,” he says. “What you want, you can have it. You can have me. You’ve
He’s halfway through eating his pie when he can’t do it anymore. Not with the way he could feel Cas watching him contentedly, fondly.
“So you didn’t hear my prayers?” Dean asks.
Cas chuckles again and shakes his head. “It only tastes like molecules to me. I’ll get a to-go box for it and you can finish it for me later,” he says, and the ‘later’ in that sentence fills Dean with joy.
Not long after, the sadness had turned to anger. Anger at Cas, for making the deal in the first place. For loving Dean so much it killed him. For telling him and then leaving before Dean could say it back. Anger at Jack, for dying and causing the deal, for becoming God and not bringing Cas back, for leaving Dean just like Cas had, just like Sam.
He packs his stuff with only what he needs. His hunting gear, some clothes, and a sturdy pair of boots.
He kicks off his shoes and curls up on the bed, tears blurring his vision as the thunder rolls outside and lightning flashes light up the dark room in occasional pops of color.
He thinks to himself.
good pie, especially for being just regular apple pie, and was probably the best apple pie he’d had in years. Mentally, Dean decided to give Jenna a large tip.
They aren’t over. There’s going to be a “later” for the two of them.
Castiel smiled softly and the sight of it brought endless relief to Dean. And when Cas responded with “Yes. Hello, Dean,” the relief doubled until it flooded over Dean so completely his hands began to shake.
He hears footsteps walk over, but he ignores them. They come closer until the stranger sits down on the stool to the right of Dean.
Dean frowns. “How did you-” He begins.
still rings in Dean’s ears.
More often than not, he’ll put a gun to his head or hold a knife against his wrist, wanting to just end it all.
He doesn’t know what he’d say even if he did pick up.
He wanted to look over, he did. He wanted to see for himself if it was really Cas. Or if he was finally going crazy. But he couldn’t move. He was frozen in his spot.
What right does he have to hide in the comforting blur of alcohol? Castiel died because of Dean, and Dean didn’t even have the courage to say it back before he left.
It doesn’t feel like home anymore.
He barely registers the blankets being removed and a cold washcloth being put to cover his forehead. Too cold. “I should’ve stopped you,” he whispers, feverish and delirious. “I shouldn’t have just stood there, Cas. I’m so sorry.”
seeing Sam happy with Eileen only hurts him.
Dean runs his hands down his face with a sigh. Nothing makes sense right now.
And still, no Cas.
Dean doesn’t answer.
It shatters into pieces, and with it goes Dean’s anger.
When Jenna comes back with a mug of coffee and a smile, Dean nods thankfully, but shakes his head when she asks if he’s ready to order. “I just- I need more time,” he says.
Several weeks into his self-destructive spree, Sam calls.
“I didn’t- I don’t know where we stand now. You didn’t respond, Dean. I have no idea how you feel.”
there, Cas.” He feels a tear fall down his cheek, but he isn’t ashamed. He’s allowed to feel upset. Cas won’t judge him.
He’d lost it a little, had cried and cried and cried for days. Begging and pleading and praying. But Cas hadn’t come back.
He feels tears begin to well up in his eyes and he scowls to himself.
“I’m beginning to wonder if frozen pastries were really that bad.”
“Cas, that couch was already secondhand when I bought it, ‘bought’ being a stretch here, considering I traded a six-pack and a large pepperoni for the thing. Its ass-prints have ass-prints, there’s a mystery stain on the middle cushion, and it smells like someone’s great-aunt Mabel died on it.”
Castiel tells Donna about Claire’s upcoming visit and they spend the rest of his OT session amiably trading baby stories:  Castiel’s about Claire, of course, and Donna’s about her niece, Wendy.  Before he knows it, he’s wheeling back to his room while Donna walks at his side, pleasantly surprised at how energized he still feels after his session, especially given how badly he had suffered yesterday.  He’s relieved to know that Garth was right the day before and his increased pain had just been a temporary setback, not his new normal.
Grimacing, he drops his arm from Lisa’s waist, giving her an apologetic look as he says, “I can stay for bit, but I’m taking Cas to his physical therapy appointment at eleven and I should probably go home and shower first.”
Dean’s still feeling that single word reverberate through his chest when Cas continues, “I think about your eyes:  the same color as the tree leaves surrounding you as I looked up through that shattered windshield.  I think about your voice: so protective when you refused to leave me as they cut off the roof.  I think about the feeling of your forehead pressed against mine through that awful tarp.  I think about how you made me feel safer and more cared for in that one moment than anyone had made me feel in my entire life.  And that was before I even knew you.”
“You misunderstand me,” Castiel says quietly. “I know how many different ways humans can love, Dean. And that’s how I meant it. All of them.”
“I do want to tell you though, Dean.  I want you to know why I reacted the way I did that night.  I know I’ve told you bits and pieces about my relationship with Bart, but there are things I didn’t tell you.”
As he finally senses Jack stepping away, he takes stock of his new form. Dean was right. On the one hand, he feels better than he has in years...all the little aches and pains of daily life having disappeared. A myriad of discomforts so minor they’d faded into the background of his existence as a human are suddenly noticeable in their absence. He feels more alert and energized than any amount of sleep or coffee could produce in his human body. And beneath it all runs a thrumming current of
Cas’ hands trace along Dean’s abs, making his stomach curl and shiver in anticipation, but when they fall to rest on the button of his jeans, Dean inhales sharply and freezes. Noticing the reaction, Cas immediately pulls back, sitting up and moving Dean off him with a gentle smile and gentler hands.
“Sap,” Dean whispers against his lips and the snarky retort he immediately starts to formulate is lost when a lubed finger begins teasing at his entrance.  Dean traces the puckered opening in firm, but gentle circles with the pad of his finger, pulling something that sounds suspiciously like a whine out of Castiel.  He can’t help the way his hips push down against the mattress, chasing Dean’s finger.
Raising an arm to block the pillow Cas swats him with, Dean huffs a laugh, “A pillow fight?  That’s your big comeback?  Where’s that acclaimed Ravenclaw wit, huh?”
In fact, Dean would bet the Stanley Cup he won two years ago that Crowley is the reason those pictures exist in the first place. He’s probably had someone following Dean for months now, ever since Dean finally agreed to an interview, just waiting for him to slip up. And Dean had been so careful… until last night. Last night, when Cas had been just as intoxicating as the whiskey. When they’d left the party together, instead of taking separate cars the way Dean normally would. When Dean had chosen an easily identifiable t-shirt to borrow, instead of the plain gray one sitting next to it.
Still sucking marks into the back of Dean’s neck, Cas runs his hands up Dean’s fitted black t-shirt, before trailing them down his arms, closing a hand around each wrist.  As he lifts Dean’s wrists, Cas’ voice is quiet but frim in his ear, “Hands on the walls, Pet.”
that he must have an age.
not the bed scene you were hoping for, but it was cute, right?
One side of his mouth quirking up in a sad half-smile, Cas chuckles. “Don’t get me wrong, it had its perks. It was nice to be able to afford my…hobbies, without having to worry. And not having to clean my own toilets or do laundry were certainly plusses.”
Seeing an angel’s true form might burn away a human’s eyesight, but Dean’s pretty sure seeing the love in Cas’ eyes is going to burn away every part of him...strip him bare to his very soul.
To Cas’ surprise, his coffee-fondling accidentally drags something else out of the cabinet as well. A folded stack of papers and a white envelope hit the countertop next to Cas’ favorite of Dean’s coffee mugs, a chipped
“The asphalt.  The lamppost.  The lettering on the Snack Shack sign.”  Feeling still unsettled, but under control again, he’s suddenly very aware of Dean’s palm pressed against his, warm and dry.  Dean’s calloused fingers wrapped around his own.  His heartbeat starts to pick up speed again and he feels an entirely different kind of anxious fluttering in his stomach.  Who knew the gastrointestinal system was so expressive?
Leaning down, he kisses Cas soundly before pulling back far enough to murmur, “And because you have a great ass.”
to see Cas, he’ll look like an even bigger loser than he does pacing this hallway.  If the man doesn’t want to be bothered, Dean will just send his best wishes wish Jessica and get the hell out of Dodge.  Dean runs a hand through his short, spiky hair on a sigh and rubs the back of his neck, looking up when he hears the ding of the nearby elevator.  Cas’ brother Gabriel steps out of the elevator, looking surprised to see Dean for a moment, then rearranging his features in a smirk that manages to look both amused... and a little dangerous.  Dropping his hand by his side, Dean narrows his eyes slightly at the older man’s approach.
It’s almost a shame to wake them, but needs must.  With another snap of his fingers, the figures begin to stir and Chuck calls out merrily, “Wakey, wakey,” adopting his patented nervous smile.
When glaring at his screen for a solid thirty seconds does nothing to elicit a response from Sam, he finally huffs and slips the phone back into his pocket before washing his hands and rejoining Benny on the line, dropping the fries for his next order in the deep fryer on his way to grab two of Ellen’s secret-recipe beef patties so he can make the best double cheeseburger in a 200-mile radius.
they said,
Gleefully he jumped up and spun in place to see his surroundings. The wildflower field continued to his left, hills bouncing up from the flat ground. To his right, the maple and oak forest. The air was warm, like summer, clouds above him in the celeste sky moving slightly towards the forest, like they were urging him on.
“You’re awake, and looking relatively lucid,” Castiel says.
“Dean, I don’t understand,” Cas says slowly, “there isn’t any pie le-” and then the look on Dean’s face must sink in, because he cuts off with a slowly growing and a little shy smile. “...yes,” he says finally. “I would like a taste.”
He drowns himself in whiskey and bourbon to drown out the memory of Castiel’s blue eyes, red rimmed and lined with tears that he’d never seen fall before.
“Barely,” Dean responds. Everything hurts. He feels like he’s freezing and melting simultaneously.
” Dean croaked, voice wobbling, painfully close to cracking.
The waitress, a sweet looking woman with long, wavy, dark blonde hair and deep blue eyes approaches Dean from the other side of the bar. “What can I get for you, sugar?” she asks with a warm voice, rich with a soft southern accent. It reminds him, inexplicably, of his mother.
Dean throws the empty whiskey bottle at the wall.
Dean swears he hears the sound of wings flapping right before he falls asleep, but it’s probably just the rain anyway.
Cas’ eyes widen slightly before his expression softens to something so fond it would probably make Dean uncomfortable had it been coming from anyone else. “I know,” he says with a smile that’s almost a grin.
Dean feels sick. Well, more sick than he already is.
Cas is wearing a matching grin. “Hmmm,” he says with mock thoughtfulness. “I’m not sure, I think we should do it again, so I can have another taste.”
He thinks as he decapitates a vampire.
Nowadays though, Dean just felt numb. He drove around Baby with the hope to bring some life back into his life, but nothing helped.
A couple days after they’d won, after Jack had left and Sam had reunited with a newly brought back Eileen, Dean had broken down in the bunker.
in his chest.
So Dean drives. He drives all around the country, hunting things until his bones ache and he’s beaten and bloody, and drinking his thoughts away in shitty motels afterwards until he passes out and forgets.
“Dean. You’re awake,” says Cas. And
Cas’ hold on him tightens. “You’re not dreaming, Dean.”
Eventually though, his fever breaks. He still feels like shit, but when he opens his eyes to his empty motel room, his brain feels a lot clearer.
He's snapped out of his stupor by the sound of the bell above the door chiming to indicate someone else entering.
It’s an empty promise, and he gets the feeling Sam knows it too.
They meet again in the middle for another kiss.
” he hisses. “You don’t- you fucking- Jesus
He thinks back on his fever, trying to figure out who helped him, but it doesn’t clear anything up. If anything, it makes him more confused.
sorry.”
“Cas, listen, I-”
But he can’t ever go through with it. He doesn’t want Castiel’s death to be in vain. He can’t kill himself outright. Even if Castiel will never know.
He wanted to get some pie - the place was literally named for its pies - but that was mainly out of habit rather than actual desire. It’s been hard to want any of the things he used to enjoy, not since…
“Hey,” Dean says, and he reaches out and grabs Cas’ hand. “There’s no need to apologize, man.” Dean’s grinning too, and, distantly, he figures he should probably make an effort to stop calling Cas “man” and “buddy”, considering the fact that he’s in love with the stupid angel.
“No,” he says sternly, looking stubbornly down at his half-eaten slice of pie. “No, it’s not Cas. It’s not alright, and I need to say this.”
” Castiel says, his name barely a breath, hardly a whisper. He sounds awed.
It opens, and in walks a fucking ghost.
He knows his whiskey bottle is too close to empty to be fully satisfying, there’s definitely not enough in it to make him black out, but it’s all he has left right now so it’ll have to do.
He’s been driving around the country, searching for something he knows he won’t find. The thing he wants that he knows he can’t have. He lost his chance.
And Dean suddenly understood. Cas didn’t want to talk about it yet. He didn’t know how Dean was going to respond. He wanted to have this first, just a quiet, peaceful moment.
He grins at Cas and squeezes his hand before turning back to his delicious pie.
Still, his heart isn’t really in it.
And it was Castiel. Undoubtedly. He had the same messy hair, the same stubble, the same beautiful blue eyes, same dirty trench coat, the same stubbornly crooked blue tie.
Nothing makes sense right now. Maybe he’s still dreaming.
That makes sense, he supposes. It’s barely 3 AM and the diner is plopped in the middle of bumfuck nowhere. The only other signs of life in the area are the long winding road outside and the shitty old gas station a few miles back.
He wonders as he wallows in whiskey and misery.
There’s no mistaking that voice.
At one point he thinks he sees his mother, at another John is sitting by his side, telling him he did a good job, that he can rest now.
Somehow, at the end of it all, they win. They beat God, and things are returned to normal.
He doesn’t think about how it’s kept in the same place that he’d kept Cas’ old trench coat when he’d walked himself into the lake, doesn’t think about how this is a much more fragile, and much less permanent token of what he had.
The flood of warmth the action brings Dean, as well as the hesitation in Cas’ eyes, brings Dean to squeeze their hands automatically, reassuringly.
“Dean,” Cas interrupted. “We’ll have plenty of time to talk, I promise. Just eat your pie.”
But they aren’t. Cas is still dead, and Dean feels like the only one who’s still grieving. The only one who didn’t get their happy ending. “I will, Sam,” he says.
He sits up in bed and is surprised to find he can breathe normally without any pain. Dean’s pretty positive he broke a rib on that hunt, so this is weird.
“Lose me? Dean, I’m right here,” Cas says and Dean’s tears begin to fall.
He unscrews the top hastily and starts drinking quickly.
“Don’t go, Cas,” he pleads. “Please don’t leave me,” he reaches out and grabs the sleeve of Castiel’s trench coat. It feels so real, and that just makes it hurt more.
Then he hears the sound of the motel room door unlocking, and he looks up sharply, watching the door.
“I’m sorry,” he chokes out, over and over and over again. “I’m so sorry, Cas.”
Jenna smiles sadly at Dean. “There are some things a mother just knows, and heartbreak is one of them.” Her eyes are understanding, and painfully blue - too close to Castiel’s eyes for comfort. Dean looks away. “You look like you could use a slice of pie,” she says, handing him a paper dessert menu, specifically made for this week. “They’re all made from scratch, and made from the heart. Take all the time you need, honey. I’ll be back with a cup of coffee for you, it’s on the house.”
Cas chuckles and the sound warms Dean up from the inside out. “My apologies, Dean. It seemed fitting and I figured you’d appreciate it.” Cas ducks his head slightly, avoiding eye contact, though he’s still smiling.
The bottle is empty too soon, and now Dean really has to suffer. He’s all out of alcohol, and not drunk enough to forget anything.
But he doesn’t stop Dean when he leaves.
He heads to the bar and sits down on one of the stools.
his voice hurts to hear.
Those few days were fueled entirely by anger in Dean’s opinion. He knew, deep down, that the anger was caused by love, but he didn’t want to think about that. Because if Cas was right, if he was right about Dean then there really wasn’t any good reason why Dean had never said anything.
Dean has trained himself out of holding any hope.
With a cursory and habitual glance around the diner, he realizes he’s the only one here. At least the only customer.
me enough to fucking call me when you come back alive.”
And more depressed. Because from what he remembers, the person who helped him still stubbornly looks like Cas.
To be honest, Dean doesn’t quite know why he came here. Maybe he needed a break from the drive.
For the first time since he’d died, Dean sees Cas’ expression turn hesitant. “I wasn’t sure you’d want to see me,” he admits quietly.
“We tried. Sam called you several times but you didn’t answer.”
“Oh look, our pie,” Cas said, cutting Dean off as their slices of pie were placed down in front of them.
“What? Why didn’t-?”
Jenna’s words soothe something raw and stinging inside Dean, and he offers her a small smile as she heads back into the kitchen.
Dean doesn’t remember much after that.
“What?” Dean’s heart sinks into his stomach. “
The Cas in Dean’s head says something back, but Dean can’t hear him. He can barely hear anything. It’s too cold.
He ends those nights with tears and murmured prayers into his pillow. They always end with “I’m sorry”s and “I love you”s and whispers of “Please come back, Cas”.
Cas,” Dean snaps. “You fucking
Castiel frowns and does his confused little head tilt that Dean has always secretly found unbearably cute. He realizes, suddenly, that he doesn’t have to keep that a secret anymore, and the thought makes him smile.
It’s been about a month and a half since Dean left the bunker, nearly two months since they won, and a little over two months since Cas died. And still, Dean can’t get Castiel’s last words out of his head. His blue eyes still haunt all his dreams, the smile on his face as the empty took him away is there in Dean’s mind’s eye every time he closes his eyes, his voice as he said
Dean lets out a shaky breath and pitches forward slightly, wrapping his arms around Cas and burying his face in the crook of his neck as he hugs him tight. “Please tell me I’m not dreaming, Cas,” he whispers, clutching tightly to the back of Cas’ trench coat.
“I’m sorry,” Dean chokes out, vision blurry with tears. “I’m so fucking sorry, Cas.”
Eventually, he ends up at a diner.
But mostly, Dean had been angry with himself. For not saying it back when Cas told him, for just standing there, for being the reason Cas died, for being too stubborn and too scared to say anything sooner, back when he’d had the chance. He was angry at himself for not being everything that Cas apparently thought he was.
He looks over the menu with a tired sigh. Not too long ago, Dean would’ve killed to eat here. All the pies sound awesome, and something about the waitress makes it very clear she puts effort into her pies.
But Cas is still gone. And it doesn’t really
Dean’s eyes widen and he tosses off his blankets, quickly getting out of bed, only to stumble on legs that haven’t been used for days.
God, Dean is in love.
And for the first time in what feels like forever, Dean doesn’t feel empty anymore.
It should be scary. Saying those words to Cas. He’s never said them to anyone before and actually meant it, not in this way.
But it isn’t. It’s as easy as breathing. Saying it to Cas feels as natural as driving Baby. It feels like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders. Suddenly he understands how just
“You kno-?” Then Dean gets it. “Oh you little shit,” he laughs. “You did
There’s never any response.
When they pull away, Dean is still grinning. “Well?” he says. “Did you like the taste?”
Jack leaves a few days after they win. He doesn’t tell Dean where he’s going or when he’s coming back, and if Sam knows anything he’s not telling. But that doesn’t really matter.
could make Cas so happy.
He stumbles into his motel room, dripping wet from the storm raging on outside, and throws his keys on the bedside table before immediately going for his stash of alcohol.
“Cas I’m sorry,” Dean interrupts, and he slides one hand from Cas’ shoulder up to cup his cheek. Cas’ breath hitches audibly. “I’m
Dean feels irritation flash through him briefly, the diner is completely empty, and Dean’s positive he’s radiating “leave me alone” vibes, but for some reason the stranger decides to sit next to him anyway.
It was
All the hesitance in Cas’ expression melts away, and he practically beams at Dean. “You should finish your pie, Dean,” he suggests softly.
Sam calls again and Dean still doesn’t pick up. He calls again and again that night but he doesn’t leave any voicemails so Dean doesn’t call back.
He grabs the bottle of whiskey and sinks down onto the bed, wincing in pain that he knows he deserves. He peels off his soaking wet jacket and tosses it in the corner of the room. He’s cold as fuck, and he knows he could get sick if he stays in these wet clothes, but Dean honestly doesn’t care.
“It matters to
Ah. That explains it. Dean is hallucinating. He’s sick and imagining Castiel. “No,” he rasps quietly, and Castiel stops moving. “No, don’t. I- I don’t want to lose you.”
“How long have you been back?” Dean asks, his eyes roaming over Cas’ body almost frantically, taking him all in. Everything he thought he’d lost for good, back. Here and whole and
It’s after he finishes it that he gets an idea, and he grins. “Hey Cas, you wanna taste it? It’s pretty good.”
“I love you,” he whispers into his pillow, wet with rainwater and tears. “I love you too, Cas. I’m
