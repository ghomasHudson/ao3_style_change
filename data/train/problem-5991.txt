"We'll see," Peggy said calmly. No one stopped Peggy when she was set on something, a fact Steve should have learned by this point. For all that Steve was the trouble maker of the group, he suspected that his role would soon have been usurped had Peggy been caught in most of her misadventures.
Tony sighs. "I guess you'd better." He climbs out of bed, revealing that he's wearing nothing but a pair of red silk briefs, and grabs a robe from inside the wardrobe. "I'm sorry, but I need coffee before I try to deal with," he waves his hand at Steve vaguely, "this. But I will be back and I will be a supportive husband and everything once I'm caffeinated, I swear. Do you want one?"
"Alright," Fury said, regaining the attention of the room. "You're going to say to your partner what you want to say to whoever pissed you off last. No holding back. Tell them exactly what you think. Verbal abuse only, please."
"You okay?" Tony asks.
"Who else would I be talking to?"
"No, I mean," Steve clenched his hands around the plastic chair seat, "I mean you. You're making me angry."
Until Bucky found it.
Steve, as he has been doing for the past forty minutes, thinks about the Tony he remembers. Thinks about Pepper and Sharon, about the Accords and Bucky and Zemo, Ultron and Tony's parents, and can't wrap his head around the idea that in this world Tony and Steve had come through that as a married couple. "Are we happy?"
The next day Steve was woken up by Bucky's walk of shame, followed by a newspaper to the face.
"That and worse," Tony confirmed. "The issue is raised every single time I do something the board or the press or whothefuckever don't agree with. Apparently I'm a self-destructive narcissist with severe mental health issues."
"Do you want there to be groping?"
"How?"
Tony flails for words for a second. "Was that before or after she messed with my brain to get me to create him, then worked for him to try to destroy us all?"
He really should have remembered that the Maria Stark Foundation, the major donor for the center, was under the purview of one Tony Stark.
A petulant part of him wanted to ignore everything Strange had said, annoyed that the man had virtually promised answers and then given none. But the question of why someone would do something like this to him was a valid one. It seems highly unlikely that any of this is an accident. But how could this possibly benefit anyone?
Tony rolls his eyes. "I'm not sure why I thought you'd get that reference. Nevermind."
Steve stares at him helplessly, unable to verbalise exactly what's going on, the horror of waking up in a world he doesn't recognise for the second time striking him dumb.
Tony rolled his eyes. "Fine."
No one but him knew how it could have been. How fully they failed.
Tony tilted his head. "They are people, you know. And like most people they have tastes, not some generic ideal that applies across the board. Sure, not everyone is attracted to all body types, but all body types are attractive to someone."
“Oh.” Steve didn’t know what to say for a moment but Coulson chuckled, then he got up.
Uhm yeah.. I didn't mean to tease.. Sorry lol..
"This is not rejection, I'm not rejecting you." Steve said, then his hand went to the nape of Tony's neck to finger the collar. "As a matter of fact, I find you very attractive. You're gorgeous, very smart with very strong spirit. I just want to do this right."
Damn. He had history with this Banner guy? But now Tony was just too curious to pass this bit of information up.
“Do me a favor and tell it to Colonel Rhodes too.” He said and Pepper snorted,
“Shh.. It’s okay. It’s alright.” He told Tony and ran his fingers through the artfully tousled black hair. To his dismay, Tony sobbed into his shoulder. He wasn’t crying, it was more like a hiccup or a gasp, telling Steve that Tony was trying to catch his breath. Steve could feel his heart hammering where he held Tony close.
Tony whistled and looked at Steve. “Thanks big guy.” He said, half mocking, then pushed Steve’s heavy arm off of himself to get up and Steve let him.
"If Tony will let me, I'd like to take him out again. Properly this time," Steve confessed.
It was fun in the end. Needless to say, Bucky did an appalling job of being a wingman and ended up seeing Steve to a cab before leaving in another direction with a leggy brunette whose name Steve didn't catch and probably wouldn't get to hear again.
Bucky manhandled him into taking off the shirt he was wearing. "Buy something nice yourself and you can wear that. Until then, this is what you've got."
Steve nodded and pointed his gaze back at his food.
"Bucky doesn't like spicy food," Steve explained.
Nebula looks ready to say her piece as well, but Tony glares her into submission and continues talking. "Whatever. The point is, I won't let you handle the stones because I don't trust you. I don't trust what you'd use them for. Now, if you want to take someone else's place and let them off without the risk to their lives, go ahead. But I'm in the centre."
Steve and Natasha set off immediately to find Tony, carefully ignoring the curious and threatening looks the various aliens on board the station send their way. Natasha somehow blends in seamlessly as always, despite them being the only humans on board. Well, presumably apart from Tony. Steve on the other hand, feels more self-conscious than he has done since the serum.
"Yeah?"
"Fine, just... bear in mind I'm fine now, okay?" Tony says. He turns his own attention to the album and licks his lips. "So a few years ago Pepper got hit with this tech virus. Made her all glowy and hot, in ways even Pepper isn't usually glowy or hot. I found a cure and in the process, figured out how to manipulate it, make it safe. So I used it on myself so I could have the reactor removed."
"I'm sorry, it wasn't... I don't know how it got that far," Steve said.
Tony pulled away altogether, which was pretty much the opposite of what Steve had intended. "Steve."
"And how did he know he had clearance?" Steve asks. He had asked Bruce at the time, but other than a small smile and a shrug he hadn't got an answer.
"How did you put this together?" Steve asks in wonderment.
"Something like that," Steve said. He had a feeling it was his fault for all his low self-esteem fuelled angsting as a teen. He may have said a few times that he thought he'd never find anyone who wanted him. At the time it was true, his teens years weren't fun, but now? He wasn't in the healthiest place when it came to self-esteem, but he wasn't that bad. Dating Peggy had helped a lot in that regard, as had finding purpose in art school and his volunteering. He might never be at ease with the way he looked, but he liked himself now.
Steve frowned. "I do volunteer with the homeless."
Steve nods. "Who else?"
"Great," Steve said and had no idea what to do next. They'd agreed to make out, but now what? How did they... How did he... Was there a way to make this feel more natural and less painfully awkward?
His breakfast was long cold by the time he emerged wearing the new clothes, that fit disturbingly well. "There. Happy?"
"I can see more clearly here. Fewer distractions. Not to mention if there had been anything more I could do for you, the majority of it would have been done here," Strange says. "That and you were the only Avenger who hadn't paid me a visit here yet." He grins. "I do like to finish collections."
Steve frowns. "Bruce?"
Steve laughed. He looked down at the remainder of his drink and thought 'what the hell'. He threw back the last of his drink and stood up to join Tony. "Don't say I didn't warn you."
"Steve," Tony says, leaning in, trying to get eye contact again. "Hey, it's okay. I'm not... I'm not expecting you to be on board with this, us, when you don't remember any of it. I know things are rough the way you remember them. We'll go slow. I'll remind you why we're together, but I won't push."
Tony looks at Cho and Strange. "Inconclusive."
Steve cleared his throat and wilfully ignored Tony's existence. "It's just always got to me. People always go one of two ways, 'oh look he's adorable let's patronise him' or 'man, isn't he hilarious thinking he's a tough guy, let's mess with him'. If I have a problem people just brush it aside and pat me on the head, sometimes literally."
"Okay, let's get this show on the road," Tony says and they all reach for their stones at the same time.
"Fine. Whatever. Sell them on Ebay, donate them to a shelter, I don't care," Tony said. "Please not the Salvation Army though." At Steve's crossed arms he sighed. "Look, I don't mean to brag but I am rich as hell. Buying these was the equivalent to dropping my change by accident at the bar. Taking them back would more of a pain in the ass than anything. Just... take them. Do what you want with them. Wear them, don't wear them. I don't give a shit."
Steve sniffles.
He isn't at all surprised to see on the emergency broadcast channel, the only one still currently running with any consistency, saying that S.I is organising emergency power and accommodation for those who need it, power and equipment for the emergency services, and a list of other facilities and resources . It's not a PR piece or a news item, not a story, just an update on where people can get help. For once Steve gives some thought to how much effort that must have taken, how much work Miss Potts and the newly returned Tony must have put into it to get it all up and running so quickly. He wonders if Tony already had contingencies in place for a disaster of this magnitude, and then with the thought is convinced that he did. Tony's been predicting this for a long time. That's what Ultron was all about after all.
Nebula steps forwards. "I have not held one, but I have had exposure to the stones for years. I only need to survive long enough to undo Thanos' work."
"We may as well use everything at our disposal," Strange says and turns to Tony. "Bring him to the sanctum when Dr. Cho has finished her examination." With that he strides out, cloak swirling behind him in a way that it shouldn't be able to do in a small, windless space.
"We do work well together, you ass," Tony grumbles but surprisingly doesn't rise to the bait. Instead he drains his coffee and gets back out of bed. "Clearly keeping you calm and rested is a no go. Do what you want, but I'm restricting you to the mansion until we get you checked out. I'll be in the workshop."
"Oh shi-! What! No fair! You made me drop them!" Tony craned his neck to try and see where the pennies went, as if he could reach out and place them back under his figers without dropping any other pennies.
"OW!!!"
"Good. That's a good decision." Steve said, sounding extremely serious. Maybe too serious for the situation but Tony appreciated not being mocked.
The big hand gently caressed his bottom from his lowerback to the back of his thighs as the captain spoke. It was sort of hard to pay attention, Tony was sure Steve had been very diligent about keeping tally anyway. Not like he was going to protest. 14 didn't sound that bad either. He'd taken way worse.
The hand on his bottom started to pet in circles that moved lower. Tony merely hummed in appreciation.
“I remember going to MIT. My father was angry about something but that’s nothing new. I know he’s gone now, don’t remember how. Then..” his eyebrows furrowed.
Steve blushed furiously but hugged Tony back just as tight.
It would have been fine if this was just a fling like so many others. If Tony had jumped into bed with Steve for a night of fun and parted in good spirit the next day, it would have been fine. But somehow this was not what was going on here. Steve had been fooled into thinking he could make a proper sub out of Tony, worthy of care and consideration.
Tony opened his mouth to protest. 6:30!? He'd have to wake up at 6 at the latest! What kind of cruel punishment was that!?
“I hardly needed to Captain.” Coulson looked at him again and this time the calm smile only annoyed Steve further.
“I like that idea.” He said, then with his knees pushed Tony’s legs open to settle between them.
With a last, very light slap to Tony's butt, Steve left him there and returned to the couch to do god knows what.
. He couldn’t leave his room!
“He tried to kill Tony.” Steve nodded in understanding.
Steve had to try not to grind his teeth. So this was what it was going to be like between them now, a pissing contest. Steve knew, considering where Tony had knelt all evening, there was no real competition but he would respect Tony’s choices. And to be fair, he could understand the colonels concern after finding an alpha in Tony’s house, who had just told him he had spent the night after learning Tony was an omega. No matter that the said alpha was the colonels childhood hero.
“Heavy with my child.”
Tony pulled his shirt off rest of the way, slowly, thinking. Could he really go that low? Did he want to?
Tony swallowed before asking a little nervously, “Really?”
After Fury was done with explaining and assigning work, he dismissed them with a nod and a swirl of his leather coat he left the room. Natasha turned to discuss something or other with Clint and Bruce was up and out of his seat, clearly intending to follow Tony to catch him for a chat. Since Tony had left the room in the blink of an eye, running off while looking supremely casual about doing it.
"Tony."
“Then I take it you already told him.” Steve said through gritted teeth.
“Half past eight.”
“Maximum for the next half an hour.” Jarvis answered.
“An asshole you mean?” Tony had asked and Pepper had answered, “That’s a Tony Stark trait, not an alpha trait. I don’t think you’ll have a problem with that.” Tony had pouted and Steve had laughed.
Steve didn't deserve this. He didn't deserve being stuck with Tony because Fury needed a sucker to stick Tony with.
"That's not the point. The point is for you to try and obey. Also if you learned to cook, it wouldn't be a completely useless skill for you. Now don't make me repeat myself." Steve gave Tony a look and left the kitchen.
The last was said in such a casual tone, like Tony was commenting on the weather, it took a second for Steve to process what Tony had just said. He must have looked surprised because Tony stopped chewing for a moment.
Tony sighed but didn’t move away from Steve, to Steve’s great, selfish relief.
How much more degrading could this night get? But not wanting to find out, Tony nodded.
"I'm going to spank you now Tony. I know you've said it's ok in your check list but this is not just going to be a couple of swats. I'd like to confirm your consent. What's your color?"
“If it’s any consolation we still liked you. I’m sure Steve did too. Despite the bickering and the ignoring. Now come on. Bed time.” She pulled him toward the bedroom by his hand but Tony resisted for a moment.
Steve stood up abruptly, feeling a little dizzy.
“What if someone comes in?”
"Gods, come on.. I'm gonna-"
Steve opened his eyes, was Jarvis speaking?
Semi transparent shower stall was closed and Steve could see the dark form of Tony huddled on the floor of the stall. Other than that everything looked normal. He pulled the stall open to see the omega sitting there, hugging his knees, his gaze fixed on the wall. He still had his pajama bottoms on and they were soaking wet.
"Your volunteer dominant will be with you in a moment Mr Stark." She said in a voice that communicated clear disapproval.
At that the omegas eyes snapped open. "What drugs?"
“Please sit down.” Pepper told him, sounding exhausted. It was the ninth time they were having this exact same conversation. “There is nothing you can do. He clearly went out of his own volition. He will come back. How stupid will you feel if he just went out to pick up donuts?”
"Seriously?"
Steve let out a breath over Tony’s head. “It’s alright. I know you Tony. You’re always curious and not really good at following orders. I’m not exactly surprised. Don’t worry about it.” Then he gently pried Tony off of his chest to look into his face, one hand carefully cradling Tony’s jaw. He felt his heart miss a beat when Tony leaned his head into his palm ever so slightly. His cheeks were flushed, and he looked at Steve with bright, scared eyes.
“Clever move Capsicle.”
Since I've been getting comments about how the situation here might be dubcon, and how some readers are worried that Tony might change as a result of Steve's treatment of him, I want to put a disclaimer here that applies to both this chapter and the coming chapters.
"I'll take it this time, less attitude next time." Steve said. Fuck, but the guy wasn't going to let Tony get away with anything.
Of course, Tony wanted his orgasm so he ended up making Steve the sandwich as he'd asked. He made himself one too since the pasta had had to go to trash. It was actually polite of Steve to even have eaten it, considering how awful it had tasted so Tony tried not to resent him too much.
Steve stood up to greet him.
Oh yeah, he was supposed to be the maid. Not very pleased with his next task, Tony got up from where he was kneeling being hand fed, he gathered the boxes, carried them to the kitchen and dumped them in trash.
He felt himself flush and when Tony’s eyes lazily opened to look up at him, with superhuman effort Steve pulled his fingers back, embarrassed and undeniably aroused.
“No what?” Steve frowned.
Tony shook his head. Then he stopped to think about it for a moment.
"Suit yourself."
Steve's eyebrows rose, but he kept smiling.
"Do you want me to?"
Steve froze on the spot for a moment. “His name is Colonel James Rhodes.” Steve said but his voice was tight and Tony immediately picked up on it, suddenly serious, he pulled his head out of the pizza box.
He was such a fraud, pretending to submit to this gorgeous, innocent, young dom, just so he could get his. He'd always looked at Steve and seen Captain America. Always in charge, in control... But in the end Steve Rogers was just a kid trying to do the right thing. He made mistakes like everyone else.
Tony's head whipped up at that.
He plucked the box out of Tony's hand and shut it in his fist, then swung Tony up by his hand to wrap his arms around him.
Coulson nodded.
"Do not move." The Captain instructed, and left Tony on the bed, flat on his back. Tony, very impatiently listened to him cluttering around the room, no doubt placing the cock cage on the sink to be cleaned and preparing for whatever evil torture he had in mind.
He couldn’t get air into his lungs. He was suffocating.
Then he realized how Tony might take what he was saying, he wanted to offer some sort of reassurance but he couldn’t think of anything truthful to say without traumatising Tony further at this moment. He couldn’t tell Tony that it was okay, he didn’t mind being Tony’s alpha, because, there were just so many things wrong with that even if the sentiment was true. He couldn’t tell Tony they weren’t talking about the matter of Tony’s alpha at all but about a secret that was much harder to digest…
"Honestly... I don't know."
"I have no choice now do I.. " Tony commented.
The burst of Tony’s arousal scent in the air was almost dizzying, but Steve still needed verbal confirmation before he let go completely.
Pepper silently shook her head, her blue eyes wide.
"Good, that's good Tony. I'm very proud of you, very pleased that you took your punishment so bravely."
Tony could only watch him go, jaw slack.
"I know you don't see me as your dominant yet. You still think of me as your field captain. This week is meant to help change that. For us to get to know eachother in a different way." The fingers curled in Tony's hair and pulled, Tony went with the pull until he was guided very close to Steve, still between his spread legs. Then the hand in his hair pushed his head down to rest on one knee and Tony gave into that too. Rogers' cock was straight in the line of his sight in this position but the man didn't seem to be hard. Tony couldn't decide if he was releaved or disappointed.
"Uh, no I'm not. I thought you didn't want me to."
Sorry for the long explanation inside the chapter, it wouldn't fit in notes but based on the reactions I got, all of it had to be said. Other than that, thank you for reading.
Steve was reading the newspaper (printed on actual paper) and drinking orange juice. When Tony walked in he smiled his genuine best. Tony had no idea what time it was but Steve looked showered and tidy, very put together.
But this wouldn’t do. He could smell Tony’s growing arousal and knew, just from the scent that Tony was one of those omegas who got wet when they were in heat. Steve licked his lips, he couldn’t wait to taste all of his prize. They needed to move.
"I fuck up too Tony. And I know that the casualties stay with you. A person who never makes a mistake is a person who doesn't do anything. Don't you think you deserve to be appreciated for all the good you've done?"
DISCLAIMER;
"Whatever you want." he replied.
There was a round of greetings as the agents acknowledged him, one or two of them still green enough to look star struck, looking like they couldn’t believe their luck, having lunch with both the Iron Man and Captain America. Steve decided to make an appearance more often on the juniors floors.
Tony’s writhing subsided and his eyes cleared a little at the question but his hips were still restless. Still it looked like Tony was considering the question.
He jumped into the ambulance and saw the look on Coulson’s face just before the doors were shut. Then he turned to look at Tony. Tony was looking at him with clear relief. Steve smiled at him and tried to swallow the ominous feeling that told him the situation would get much worse before Tony got better.
Steve pushed Tony away gently, putting him at arms length,
“What else do you remember?”
Tony’s eyebrows rose.
Steve didn’t listen to the rest, he pivoted on his heel, he could already hear Tony’s voice, trying to answer and explain, drowned out by whoever was yelling at him. Tony’s voice was trembling.
Tony didn’t answer. The more mundane pieces of the timeline wouldn’t have made as big an impression as the terror, Steve understood. He wished he could give Tony back everything he’d lost. He missed Tony as he was before. Then again, holding Tony like this, with Tony open to him, was something he’d never get back once the memories fully returned. He felt guilty about taking pleasure in Tony’s suffering. Now that he was starting to remember, Steve would have to control himself, he needed to start pulling back.
In the next breath Steve was turning away to take the bottle where ever he'd found it.
Tony sounded croaky and not at all his usual, confident self.
He didn’t dare pull Tony out of the car to lay him down, in case they needed to move fast and get out of there. So he awkwardly reached over the console to find the catch in the suit that would let Tony out of his metal prison. It didn’t take long to find it, the cool bumps of the armor was unfamiliar under his fingers but he didn’t need light to find the release point. The armor opened up, pushing Tony almost out of the seat and jarring him while it opened clumsily in the tight space, various plates folding and pieces falling.
"Tony, no, I can't.." Steve started but the omega interrupted him.
“Thank you.” He said and sipped it. He didn’t get the chance to have a taste of Tony’s fine collection so he savored it. Not that he usually liked to drink, but in this case, it helped, even if only psychologically.
Steve frowned.
"It's ok Tony. You just had to say it." Now Steve looked away, turning around to walk around the room, pace with his arms folded over his chest. "I can talk to Fury. There were other doms available. With high enough clearance. I can try and get someone more experienced for you. Maybe just convince Fury to send you the files so you can choose.."
Steve’s eyes widened in surprise. Tony sounded just so disappointed. This was bad. Really, worse than what Steve had first thought all through the car ride.
"Fine. But whatever this is right now, is not over."
The dom gave him a small, close lipped smile, with crinkles appearing at the corners of his eyes. Not for the first time, Tony thought the guy was unfairly handsome.
"I said language. I don't really mind your attitude in the field but in here, my submissive is going to be respectful at all times."
Steve’s hand reappeared again, this time holding a piece of chocolate. Tony opened his mouth but when Steve made to pull back, he sucked Steve’s fingers in, chasing the remains of the sweet with his tongue, cleaning and thanking him silently for the food, while he tried to remind Steve what he could have from his omega. Tell him that he’d be willing.
Tony's heart leapt a little because suddenly he realised the answer wasn't 'no'. He actually found himself unsure if he wanted the punishment or not. Of course he didn't want to endure something painful or tiring or humiliating or uncomfortable, especially if it didn't lead to shattering orgasms. But on the other hand, he felt guilty. He felt like he'd done something he shouldn't have, not because of any rule, but just because it hadn't been fair.
"You first." was all Steve said.
“Dr Banner is coming to SHIELD R&D? I thought he had his own lab.. somewhere else.” He finished lamely and looked at Tony as Tony kept standing in front of his desk, instead of going to kneel next to Steve’s chair as he had been getting used to do.
Steve glared at Tony but Tony looked unfazed. “I don’t know. You tell me.”
"Steve?" Tony asked after checking his math for the last time.
“You really managed your first day very well. Considering what you had to do.” Steve sighed. “You’re a very smart and capable man. I’m always impressed by what you do, what you can do...” He said. Words that he usually wouldn’t utter in Tony’s presence, had Tony been his usual self. It was easier to compliment the genius when he was kneeling there quietly and leaning on Steve in many senses of the word. When his massive ego wasn’t in the room to gloat or mock Steve for saying it. “I can’t begin to imagine what it must be like to pretend what you are not. You handled it well. As well as could be.” He amended himself. “Me or Pepper, we never would have asked you to do it, if it hadn’t been something you’d chosen for yourself. I don’t really mind that you tried to sneak information. Curiosity is in your nature. By now I know you well enough to know that. And I don’t blame you for it.” Then he cupped Tony’s face in his palm, and didn’t make Tony close his eyes again when they opened to look up at Steve.
“Please.” He said, just the single word, full of need.
“I ordered some chicken, and dumplings. You like it fried if I remember right?”
At 6:30 am Steve walked into the apartment, clearly returning from an intense run. He was soaked with sweat and still breathing a little hard. Usually, he would be showered and dressed by now but Tony guessed today Steve felt like an extra-long run.
"This is at least better than that canned stuff." Steve said with an earnest smile before continuing to eat.
“I’m going out.” Steve said for the tenth time as he jumped to his feet.
“Starving.” Tony said and mirrored Steve on the couch, only with the whole box in his lap.
He tried to suck on air then felt his legs give… He was in the lab. Not adrift in vast emptiness, falling. He wasn’t falling. Banner held him up and eased him into a chair.
"Yes sir." Tony said in that fake accent again. Steve's eyebrows lowered into a frown.
"You remembered... some things?" Pepper asked tentatively from behind Steve, "What sort of things exactly?" Her voice was a little higher than normal.
Tony remembered everything, Steve couldn't get over the fact, and Tony still wanted him. Wanted to marry Steve even, be his omega, officially, in the eyes of god and government. In the eyes of..
"You'll appreciate the anticipation when the time comes."
“Pepper already told you he didn’t. It’s not like you weren’t expecting this.” Steve said a little angrily. He hated seeing Tony embarrassed over something he couldn’t control.
"What are you scared of?"
The R&D had been in a bit of a panic last day or so. No one had stopped to explain Tony why exactly, but people had been moving their projects out of the department, trying totake an absence of leave and basically doing their best to get out of there. But when he had insisted on getting an answer why everyone was trying to get out of work, he had only received nervous looks and polite answers along the lines of “Oh, I’m not scared. It’s just, you know..” I think I may have the flu, the 6th floor has better coffee machines, the labs are poorly lighted here, I’ll be visiting my grandma.. Or any other bullshit reason.
Tony's hands instinctually went to his crotch.
“What.. what are you doing?”
Bruce was talking, but suddenly Tony wasn’t hearing. He remembered the view. Manhattan under the bright sun. He knew what it felt like to fly at high speeds. Chasing… Chasing something very important. A nuclear bomb. Two million people.
Steve led Tony to his own little office, nothing more than a desk and a door that closed. Which was all he needed now. He felt Tony shiver under his hand and realized his grip was a little tighter than would be comfortable. As soon as he closed the door, he let go and to his mild surprise, Tony sank to his knees, shaking.
“I was about to ask you the same thing.” Steve returned, then lowered his voice, “What’s going on Pepper, where is Tony?”
"I know! But he chose to be with me! He did choose it!" Steve exploded. "And I'm losing my mind here, trying to understand if he changed his mind.. If he regrets ever touching me! I don't need your misguided bullshit on top of it!"
“Sir-”
Steve sighed. Maybe he should have gotten Tony to read the reports that Coulson was compiling a little earlier. Or maybe it’d do Tony some good to meet Bruce before reading about the Hulk. The first time they’d met, Tony sure hadn’t been afraid of the quiet scientist. Steve wasn’t worried about how Tony would judge Bruce. But meeting a friend was more likely to jarr his memory than reading on paper what his team had been like. He had decided to give Tony more information on the Avengers anyway, Bruce Banner in his all calm, zen presence was a good start as any.
He couldn’t get Tony under hot water to warm him, the shock would be too much. What he needed to do was dry Tony and keep him warm under the bed covers.
"What do you want me to do?"
"Oh now you're locking me out? It's ok to keep Tony out of the loop because he's a collared house sub now?" Tony stood up, "I am still Ironman in case you forgot. If I'll be locked out, why am I even doing this?  I don't need to take this bullshit!" his hand went to his collar to take it off, rip it off, whatever it takes.. But then Steve and Barton were both next to him in a flash.
"Shit.." Tony breathed out.
“What? Why are you all awake and chatting and drinking coffee in the middle of the night??”
Tony woke up in the middle of the night to the covers sticking to his body and sat up in bed to throw off his shirt. He could feel sweat starting to bead on his hairline at the back of his neck.
“Then everyone can see who you belong to.” Steve growled and bit the unmarked side of Tony’s neck as a pushed a finger in.
"Nothing. I didn't do anything." He said through clenched teeth. In his emotionally exhausted state, heavy with guilt, he couldn't exactly summon up the indignation to speak up for himself but he also couldn't give ground to an alpha who he occasionally couldn't help but see as competition.
Oh. The trash pile, of course.
“Captain Rogers, I’m sorry to disturb you sir, but Agent Coulson is in the building.”
“Who knows?” Steve asked and Pepper snorted,
"Doesn't really sound like begging to me." Steve started to turn away and Tony panicked.
"You know I imagined sucking you off so many times." he said to the tip of Steve's cock.
Tony opened his mouth to do just that, but then,
“Are you offering me cocoa J?”
“Captain.” The Colonel walked in, looking around, probably expecting to see Tony, then he shook Steve’s hand.
"It is for the cursing. I told you I can not let you get away with it."
"You'll never hear me complain about breakfast for dinner." Steve smiled.
Steve himself sank down to one knee next to him and pulled Tony to his chest this time, like he had wanted to do after the incident in the mess hall.
Steve sighed. “It’s all in the past now. What’s important is he can control it now.”
The big, warm palm cupped Tony's cock and the little guy tried to twitch.
Was he willing to go there? If he wasn't, was there any point in saying red? Why not just use his safeword and get out of the whole deal?
Of course Coulson knew Pepper wasn’t really Tony’s omega. It was an open secret, just for the press. They hadn’t even bothered to pretend for SHIELD’s sake. But the question was such a justified one, Steve felt tongue tied for a moment.
“But SHIELD’s doctors..” the colonel tried, Tony bulldozed over him,
"Why I'm merely complying with my masters wishes sir, you see he has recently acquired a butler for himself."
And everything came to a halt, dead silence ringing in the room following Rogers' booming command. It was only broken by Tony's breathing.
“No. Just the.. I don’t remember what happened next. The memory is like.. It’s like I remember dying.” Tony said the last sentence in a whisper barely loud enough for Steve to hear.
Sometimes, in the deep darkness at night, Steve stroked himself to images that would make him blush in the light of day. He imagined Tony sneaking into his room, reassuring Steve that he belong to Steve, right here and now, that Steve should fuck him, claim him, brand him and make Tony his. Fantasy!Tony would tell Steve that after he claimed Tony, if Tony’s memories returned and Tony pushed him away, Steve could just hold him down and fuck him again until Tony yielded, accepted the truth, accepted that he was owned. Then Steve would do exactly that, covering Tony’s smaller body with his, pushing him down into the sheets and kissing him, brutally, taking everything from Tony and making him his omega, fucking him with slow and deep strokes of his cock until Tony begged him to let him come.
Thor considered him a moment. "I do not know what Anthony has done to secure your dislike, but I must tell you that I would advise you talk it over with him. He is a very generous and humorous man, I am sure you can put your grievances behind you."
"Oh." Steve almost rocked back with Tony's words. "Oh, I..."
Steve fought back a sigh of annoyance. "Then I'll respect his decision."
Tony winces. "I can't picture that going well if I'm still fighting space monsters."
"How was your trip?" Steve asked, and pretended he couldn't see Bucky facepalming in his peripheral vision.
"It's the clothes," Tony said right by his ear when they were all inside.
Steve looked down at the newspaper in his hand. There was a story about Tony that Steve lacked the context to understand, and a picture of Tony outside the club the night before. Steve could be seen to the edge of the picture.
Steve finally turns away from the breakfast bar to look at Tony properly. "Let me train with the team, read old mission reports. I'll catch up."
Tony smiles a little at that and when he speaks his voice is soft, full of pain and painful understanding. "I know. And I won't push. But I'm not giving up, not yet. I know you can feel that way because you did, and it made us both happy, so unless you're dead set against it I'm going to keep trying. If I have to let you go then I need to know that I did everything I could."
"But?" Steve asks.
"So don't deploy me against the Maximoffs. Just let me fight with the team against the other threats," Steve says. "You can debrief me before every mission, make sure we're on the same page. I need to be out there!"
Peggy shot him a quick glance. "And?"
The 'Family Album' is a collection of stills taken by Tony's HUD, photographs by the team themselves and the general public, news items, and even a couple of voice clips recorded over the comms.
Steve laughed. "I guess that's one upside of this whole thing. If by some miracle Tony forgives me and agrees to go out with me then there'll be at least one area of dating I'm more experienced than you in."
"We know," Nebula interrupts. "He held an infinity stone and he survived. That's why we need him."
"Your friend really that pushy with the women?" Tony asked.
Tony shrugs. "Some would argue we couldn't do worse than the last guy that had them."
Strange circles him, scrutinising him. He finishes up back in front of Steve. "There are differences. But if you are indeed from a parallel world, it must be one incredibly close to this one. Have you had any previous experience of inter-dimensional travel?"
Bucky looked him over. "What point? That the reason you lost that girl's number and didn't even try to talk to the next one is because you've got a crush on Tony Stark?"
"Cool?" Steve asks, incredulous at Tony's use of the word.
They chatted for a while, Tony flirting on and off and Steve trying to ignore the fact Tony wasn't anywhere close to rejecting him so far. It was easy and fun, and Steve was getting a little drunk by the time he realised a couple of hours had passed along with more than a few drinks.
Another eyeroll. "I thought we already established that you were never gone."
"What would you like me to scan for?"
"True," Tony says. "But Loki would have plenty reason to pretend that Thanos managed to off him when he didn't. The whole thing could have been a trick to stop Thanos from actually killing him. You can't say it wouldn't be in character. Did you actually get a good look at the body yourself? Poke it a bit?"
"I am. I'm very, very excited. Extremely excited," Tony argues. "And once I've had coffee I will prove just how excited I am."
"I..." couldn't argue with that. Steve reluctantly met Tony's eye. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said those things."
"I don't know who half those people are," Steve admits. "What about Wanda?"
Angie never picked fights.
"Tony?" Steve takes a breath and runs his hand through his hair. It's shorter than he remembers. He hesitantly lets his hand drop to his face. His beard's gone, too. "What the hell is going on?" He mutters to himself.
"I might bid on one or two things," Steve said. He didn't have much money to spare after his clothes shopping spree, which made him feel pretty guilty, but he was planning on at least bidding on all of the kid's paintings. He scrutinised Tony while he was eating his fruit pot. "Why are you being nice?"
Steve resisted the urge to contradict the therapist.
When they face Thanos again he seems... content. Like he really did save the world instead of destroying half of it. He smiles at them benevolently and Nebula twitches.
The next session was worse. Tony seemed to be deliberately picking on Steve this time, even though he never spoke directly to him. Fury shot the occasional glare when things get out of hand, but mostly just let it slide.
Bucky looked him over and turned back to the fridge to pull out the rest of the ingredients he needed. "It looks like you already did the job for me a few times over."
"I know you're trying to be a good friend, but sometimes you just make me feel like I'm hopeless. You keep trying to set me up with people who are blatantly uninterested and then you won't just let it drop," Steve ranted. "It's like an obsession with you. What's wrong with me being single? Why are you so convinced I'll be alone forever if you don't set me up? It's not real good for my self esteem that you're so desperate to get me hooked up because you're so convinced I can't get anywhere with women by myself! I found Peggy by myself, didn't I?"
Steve flipped him off and tried to get his sleep ridden brain to understand the words on the page. In the end he gave up. Tony lived a life so foreign to Steve that he couldn't even understand it by reading it from the papers. He got out of bed, not bothering to get dressed immediately for a change, instead heading to the kitchen for breakfast. Lunch? Brunch? Whatever it was when you've not eaten but it was past midday. He was halfway through peeling a grapefruit when the doorbell rang.
"Why, Steve Grant Rogers, are you trying to get into my pants on our first date?" Tony held his hand over his heart as if affronted.
"Seriously, she thought you were cute, you had it in the bag if you'd actually opened your mouth," Bucky ranted. "I thought you wanted to meet girls? Stevie, you can't get girls to like you if you don't talk to them!"
With everything that's happened, Steve is finally welcome in the USA once more, but it's a bitter homecoming. Every street is near empty, all but a few businesses are shut. There's devastation everywhere he looks, from vehicles whose drivers and pilots were the victims of Thanos, to rioting and looting and protesting as people demanded knowledge from a government who didn't have the whole story themselves, to simple neglect as the world came as close to stopping it's spin as it would before its eventual end.
"Hmm." To Tony's surprise Steve was out of the couch and back to stand next to Tony's head again.
"No no no-"
There was a bit of puttering then a low, old fashioned blues tune filled the room.
Steve shook his head. Then why would Tony run away like this? So suddenly.. As soon as his heat was over.. Because there was no explanation for the situation, was there? He had forbidden Jarvis from telling them where he’d went. He hadn’t left a note, no nothing.
"Yeah sure. I want to see if you're wearing underwear."
Something sparked in Tony. A mix of affection, pride, gratitude, indignance and something unfamiliar. Oh he'd make Steve happy alright. He could do much better than this.
Tony gripped his hair this time to pull the alpha down for a kiss.
Tony shrugged, then pointed to an especially young looking boy in a badly pressed suit.
He took a step toward the alpha and finally pulled out the tiny box he had been fiddling with in his pocket. Then he knelt on one knee and held the box out, opening it with slightly trembling fingers to reveal the smooth gold ring he had bought. He had been in a hurry when he'd bought it half an hour ago, and he wasn't sure if it would fit. And he didn't know what he would do if Steve refused him but jumping in with both feet... It was the Tony Stark way. He would deal with what came after.
“I.. Tony.. I was trying to help you. Do you remember what happened last night?” He asked cautiously. Jarvis had intervened before the hypothermia had reached truly critical levels but Steve didn’t know what sort of damage the cold interruption to Tony’s heat might have done.
"Uh.. I wasn't a virgin exactly. I fucked my fair share of betas and omegas." Steve felt a rumble rising from his chest at that but Tony went on, "But you were my first. First alpha who got to enjoy my ass."
"Steve?"
Tony already knew the answer but he was used to ignoring unconvenient truths. So instead he just blew his nose rudely into the tissue. Steve didn't even flinch.
Tony hummed in answer. Then cocked his head a bit, contemplating the beautiful body before him,
“Don’t be ridiculous Tony. The Colonel came straight from the airport to see you.” Then he lowered his voice a little, “Be polite.”
"Go me." Tony said under his breath. Then turned to look back at Steve.
But there was nothing. Absolutely nothing, no sign that Tony had clutched at him and pleaded, almost got raped, writhed in agony as Steve watched.. No sign that Tony was angry that his secret had leaked out. Not even contempt. Tony didn’t even ignore Steve, at least no more than usual. He made his usual inappropriate jokes, strutted around  and was generally both terribly annoying and amazingly brilliant.
"Thanks."
"Wait!"
"I suppose you didn't mean that?" He asked with a smirk.
“It’s my fault. Somewhat. I didn’t think. He was taking drugs…”
"I feel it all the time. Peeing is awkward." Tony answered but when Steve looked up he said "But it's not pinching or anything."
"No." He answered, then with a guiding hand under Tony's belly button he pulled the sub's hips back.
Long awaited? :D After 40k words.. Omg..
Steve was sitting in his spot on the couch again and once again the fireplace was blazing. The heat behind Tony's naked back was familiar this time. He stepped forward to present the cock cage to the dom.
Steve sighed a breath of relief. Tony was going to get well. It was a bit worrying that he hadn’t yet spoken but it could be the shock resulting from the clash of Tony’s heat and the hypothermia. The omegas body was struggling with hormonal imbalance on top of the cold.
“Tony, this Colonel James Rhodes. Remember I told you about him before? He’s a friend of yours.” Steve told him and Tony nodded.
They sat in silence for a moment then Tony said, incredulous, “That guy!?!?”
“Tony?”
"Yes but you startled-"
When Pepper put the phone down with her shoulders slumped, Steve grabbed his jacket for the ninth time.
“They left a little detail out of the memo then, he is still Tony Stark, Iron Man, a member of the Avengers. I suggest you try a little harder to remember why Director Fury ‘coddles his spoilt ass’. Come on Tony.” He turned to Tony then, and grabbed him by the shoulder. As he lead a meek and subdued Tony out of the room Banks was muttering something that sounded like superheroes and his ass.
After the Colonel left, Steve had sent Tony to get showered and dressed, so Tony did. He wished they could just stay at home for one more day but Steve seemed to think it’d still be best for Tony if Tony didn’t spend his days at home, isolated form people other than Steve. Anyway the alpha probably had work to do. He couldn’t sit around all day with Tony.
"Uh, we're staying at your place? Me too?" Tony asked dumbly.
Still thanks so much for reading! And again.. Sorry:(
"Hmm, I could, couldn't I." Steve murmured, then placed a very chase, dry kiss on the most sensitive spot on Tony's neck, right where his neck met his shoulder, causing Tony to break into goosebumps. But then the hands, the breath, the hardness at his back was gone.
Then the video opened and Tony started skipping ahead furiously, freezing with his hand hovering above the touch screen when the timeline showed Steve’s naked back stepping into the shower stall.
“Tony.. Tony..” There was so much blood, he couldn’t see, was it too much? His fingers moved too frantically to be gentle on the back of Tony’s head to find a wound but thankfully they encountered none, until his fingers swiped over a cut, too high above Tony’s temple to be noticed at first glance, easily hidden under the helmet. He swore, that could be dangerous, though he didn’t know how deep it went. There wasn’t enough light, and he wan’t about to dig his dirty fingers into an open wound.  He had to keep going, find what else was broken or ruptured, if there was any internal bleeding or any major fractures.
"I'll freeze your cock just a little bit, for trying to manipulate your dominant." Steve smirked, then he started to raise the shower head from Tony's feet to his ankles and then knees.
If he called Rhodey, Rhodey would understand. He could call him, Rhodey would be annoyed of course, he was probably very busy. But he was also the only alpha he could drop his guard with. If only a little. Tony could tell him what happened. In fact he should tell Rhodey what happened, the colonel needed to know who was privy to the information that Tony was an omega. But after that, Rhodey would ask him if he was ok in that deep, calm voice. He would care. He would tell Tony that it would be alright. He would tell Tony that he’s going to talk to Steve if needed, that he was there for Tony. You’re alright. You’re fine. Everything is fine.
“Alright?”
But of course she was right. Tony would hate that Steve had found out his secret. And Steve had nothing to say to that. He nodded a goodbye and stepped into the elevator.
Steve nodded, but didn’t look relieved. They said their goodbyes, Steve told Tony that he could call at any time, then left. Leaving Tony feeling alone.
Tony was going through his decision in his head, kneeling on the cream colored fur in front of the fireplace when Rogers walked in  from the open kitchen. There was a moment of silence in which Tony kept his head down, obeying the order he was given a little bit too late. Do not look up without permission.
Steve sighed and Tony felt a pang of disappointment. But then the Captain was talking again.
“Oh.” Tony sounded confused, so Steve rushed to reassure him.
Which was easier said than done. Tony was locked up in his bedroom now but his distinct scent lingered in every corner of the top floors that he used as his home. And not the expensive cologne but the scent of the omega heat. Steve had never smelled anything like it.
Steve stood there for a moment, trying decide if he should really follow up on the issue or let Pepper be. Then some old lady dripping with gaudy diamonds jostled him out of his contemplation,
To his dismay, it seemed to him that Pepper looked even more stressed when he appeared rather than relieved to see him.
Tony looked up to see the Captain opening cartons on the coffee table, he realized how hungry he actually was.
“He probably has an omega. Or several. A horde of omegas with big boobs and endless legs.”
The shower though, was complete and utter hell.
“Pepper.. What if he-”
It made Steve unable to deny that Tony in fact would have been happy as an omega, if Obadiah Stane hadn’t fucked him up this bad. Now that Tony was clinging to him, no matter how subtly, Steve felt truly responsible. And more than that it called to the same instinct he had the evening of the fundraiser. Possessiveness, protectiveness and the satisfaction of having an omega that looked up to him. All those feelings were wrong, Steve knew and Tony would push Steve as far away as possible the moment he recovered his memories. But for now, Tony walked around all carefree and over eager for any kind of praise out of Steve’s mouth. He was trying not to push Steve into anything, since that day in the hospital when he had said “I know you’re not my alpha” and sounded so disappointed about it. But every little gesture of submission from Tony pushed a big red button in Steve’s psyche that said “He is yours! Go claim him! What are you waiting for!?”
“Jarvis?” Steve finally asked. Jarvis knew what Steve was asking him.
Steve knew, somewhere deep down, that the irony in that was funny, but he didn’t feel much like laughing.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony gulped slowly, his adams apple bobbing under Steve’s palm, and relaxed into Steve’s hold. Only then Steve dared to move his thumb in a slow caress below Tony’s ear, soothing his pulse.
He pushed off the wall he was leaning on to make his way toward them to ask what was wrong but got waylaid by people who wanted to shake the hand of Captain America in return for the donation they had made. He didn’t want to be rude but he pushed them off as fast as he could. By the time he reached Pepper, Tony was nowhere to be seen.
Tony had settled down and had stopped kicking but when Steve looked down he was looking up at Steve with huge, scared eyes.
“I don’t know.” Pepper said, “But I’ll find out.”
"Dig in, I've already had breakfast." Steve said with a satisfied smile.
“Are you alright? I mean, I was trying to see if there was any pain, or anything broken, I can’t see in this dark but you took a pretty hard hit.”
He had decided not to take another day off, as there would be no point to it. One week alone hadn’t helped Tony adjust, more wouldn’t either. He had caught up with the tech, now he needed to catch up with his environment. No matter how unpleasant, Tony needed to learn to interact and pretend, very fast. And now that Steve would be there for him, he hoped it’d make things easier for Tony. If he was honest with himself, it had been a stupid move to leave Tony to his own devices on his first day back.
Tony looked down at the bottle and Steve who was crouching next to his thighs and closed his eyes.
Anyway, my fic ignores all that in either case. I am so not up to tackling such massive issues. So here's some more everyday drama. Please enjoy.
Tony stayed. His breath stuck in his throat in anticipation, everything about his dom's demeanor now suggested that he better obey with less sass, or else.
"Uhm.." Tony started again, unwilling to interrupt but it only made sense to remind his dom, "I could give you a blow job?" His eyes flicked up to Steve's face, only to find the captains eyes closed, his lips slightly open.. His wet eyelashed looked thick even through the stall door, Tony thought he looked like the dirtiest, most sublime wet dream he could ever hope to have. "The uh.. The no gag reflex thing? Remember? I could make it really good."
And subsequently, he had never felt his orientation so undeniably before either. Like he had a place in the world. He felt secure and sure of himself. For once, he knew where he should be without a doubt and it was right here.
Steve worked methodically, checking circulation, tightness, the knots, as he went along. He very efficiently tied Tony's wrists to his ankles with Tony's face on the bed, leaving his ass raised high for the pleasure of his dom. It felt a little humiliating, and not just the position.  The way Steve worked at his craft felt like Tony was a very precious piece of material that Steve was working into a statue. No will of his own, no need to ask his opinion. He was only there to be shaped.
"I have some excersises in mind for you today. I don't imagine you'll like it at first but-"
Steve took his time kissing the disheveled genius, letting go of his doubts and anxiety, letting his animal self take over. And what he most wanted to do was to breathe in Tony’s sweet scent without guilt or self imposed restraint. He didn’t need restraint anymore. He would never hurt Tony, he would only have him, make the omega his. His instincts were protective as much as they were possessive.
Before Tony could give an outraged reply he went on, “And it was hard to miss the way you looked at the captain. No need to worry though, it was only noticeable because I know you two well.”
"You can rest for a bit now." The dom lead Tony over to the pile of mats next to the mirrors and Tony sat down. He nodded, his hands limp in his lap. Fingers kept carding through his not very clean hair. And it felt good.
Tony, was just standing there, in front of the elevator, in a pair of casual jeans and a jacket, with his red glasses pushed up into his hair, a bunch of papers hanging slack in his hands and staring at Steve with his jaw on the floor.
“You came back through the portal right as Natasha closed it. You were unresponsive but Banner caught you in the air.” Steve smiled a little. “Then you woke up and asked for shawarma.” He hugged Tony a little tighter, his hand dropping from the omegas throat. “You were fine. You are fine.”
I did my research for this chapter. Meaning, I looked at wikipedia, thats all... So if you know about how body temperature works, please let me know and I'll totally fix the numbers. But even if they are wrong, I'm sure you'll get the general gist of the situation. Still, I appreciate corrections.
"I was drunk."
"Who are you?" He asked.
Someone needed to take the trash out, it was almost full, and starting to smell. Tony also knew how the recycling plants worked very well, so he knew he'd have to at least rinse the stuff before putting it in recycling. After that his mind engaged in how to do things, and how to do them right. So after his 5 minutes were up and Steve wandered into the kitchen, Tony had emptied the trash can, washed and put the boxes in recycling and had started to go through Steve's recycling pile, creating 3 seperate piles, while thinking about how he'd need a better system for #7 mixed recycling.
Tony immediately grabbed it and threw it open.
"I am sorry." the dom spoke, looking at somewhere below Tony's chin. Tony realised the cap wasn't just avoiding his eyes, he was looking at the collar. "That was my fault. I shouldn't have let Clint come in. You weren't ready for that. I never meant to make you feel like you were excluded or treated differently because of your collar. I never meant to embarras you."
"Not another word. Go to bed. " Steve bit out.
Steve smiled. "Good. Now Tony, I told you I'll always help you obey me if you have trouble obeying an order. So remember, you can always ask for help."
At least he had lost his tail, no tracks meant no following teams. He opened an unlocked door and hid to regroup and strategize.
"You want to suck my cock Tony?" he asked. Tony licked his lips, and adjusted his position. He very badly wanted to plaster himself all over the glass stall, but he'd been told to kneel and he really didn't want to be kicked out of the bathroom now.
But he forced himself to breathe and settle, he knew this game. Steve would probably work him up to the brink of orgasm but not let him come several times until he got bored and fucked him. So he quieted, trying to show Steve that it was ok to keep moving, get on with the program.
“Tony..” Steve slapped his palms on the door in frustration but there was still no answer. So he grabbed the door handle and pulled.
Steve wanted to tell her that there was something odd about Tony. Something wrong. But he couldn’t start that conversation in front of the nurse. Then when Pepper went inside and Steve made to follow, the nurse gave him an apologetic smile, told him Ms Potts was only allowed as she was Tony’s omega, listed as family. Well. That was still sort of good news. It told Steve that at least the doctors here hadn’t realised Tony was an omega. He was on record everywhere as an alpha and apperantly during his time in the hospital Tony hadn’t given them any reason to doubt it.
"You've got to be shitting me!"
“Hold it. I know. It’s for my own good etc..”
It hit Steve like a ton of bricks then.  Tony had said “But I thought..”. He had thought Steve was his alpha.
"Did anyone physically hurt you or threaten to hurt you, or threaten a loved one, a family member? Were you in any way unable to say no without harm to yourself or anyone else?"
"Rogers, I'm serious! Come on, you can't be that cruel!"
Steve stood there waiting tensely for the few minutes it took Tony to appear, when he did, his hair was mussed from sleep, gray pajama bottoms that Steve had put on him the previous evening riding distractingly low on his hips. He was rubbing his eyes and dragging his bare feet as he walked in and made a bee line to where Steve was standing. For a moment Steve thought Tony would kneel again, or hug him, or do something that would scandalize the colonel but Tony spotted the man and stopped. His hand dropped from his face and he looked between the colonel and Steve for a moment.
"Tony!" was all Steve could say before Barton gently pushed him aside, Steve let Tony's wrists go and let himself be pushed.
When he started to sound choked Steve hushed him again and didn’t resist the urge to press a kiss to Tony’s hair this time. He had seen Tony in so many different situations, in battles, against enemies that seemed much stronger than they were, in foreign territories, amongst the wealthiest and the most influential people in the country.. Never had he seen Tony act anything other than cocky and supremely confidant.
Tony breathed deep and hard in relief. His cock was all shrivelled now, trying to climb back into his body, but he couldn't care less about that right now.
“Steve.  I like you. I believe you are a good person. But you do know that I have an army of the best lawyers in the country and that I can take you for everything you own then make sure that you’ll rot in prison even through your unnaturally long life, Captain America or not. Right?”
"Margarita" Tony answered.
“No no. That’s not what I mean. Not the fundraiser. Damn it Tony.”
Tony's sobs started to trickle down to hiccups and he pushed away the shame that tried to barge in. He was a grown ass man, cuddled and crying in the lap of another man. The feeling of embarrasment was there but for once Tony didn't let it in.
"Disrespect. Disobedience. Language. Attitude."
He was completely exposed, nothing to hide, for once. And for no other reason then Steve wanted to look at him. His hole twitched, now much more conscious of the gaze that traveled over his body when his focus shifted from urgency to compliance.
"Coulson. Really? I didn't think you even liked the guy, the way I've seen you growl at him. Which was sexy by the way. I never thought you'd choose him as your bestman."
Steve sat back and ran his hands through his hair without realizing he was smearing Tony’s blood into his own hair. He sighed.
"Uh well, I don't know why that would make you slam Rhodey around but.. Um I remembered I had some things I had to take care of. So." Tony shrugged.
