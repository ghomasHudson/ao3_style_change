"Then sleep. If you can't see it, there's a bed a dozen steps away from you against the wall." He had no intention of coddling Stark. It was actually rather gratifying to watch him unable to function at full capacity. Then again, it would be a good deal more gratifying to see him at full power and still unable to lash out or retaliate the way he truly wanted to. "I'll have someone bring food. When you wake, you can eat." Catching the look of reserved surprise on Stark's face, Loki laughed aloud. "I told you: I intend to use you. If you are starved and sleepless, I suspect that you will not prove particularly entertaining."
Tony groaned into the more passionate kiss. It didn't have the same crushing weight of need and restrained power that he was used to, but it felt amazing all the same. When they drew apart, Tony was panting faintly. "Bed... Gotta get into the bed," he decided breathlessly, half tugging Steve toward the bedroom. He broke away when they stepped through the door, tugging his shirt off and tossing it to the floor before he looked to his lover. He hadn't missed Steve's uncertainty a moment before, or his nervousness when he'd swapped shirts in front of Tony that morning. Tony settled on the edge of the bed, hands beside his hips and a surprisingly patient look on his face. "If you get nervous or anything, tell me. I don't want you uncomfortable," he said gently, though in truth he was anxious to have Steve naked and pressed against him.
Clint nodded, though he didn't look terribly convinced. He didn't like the idea that Loki might be left alive to do who-knew-what the next time he managed to talk his way out of prison. "You'd think his brother could loan me some arrows. Their weapons work on each other, right?" he wanted to know. "Or is it all like Thor's hammer? Can't pick it up unless you're special?"
The words explained a lot. No wonder Logan looked like he was having some kind of breakdown. "I'm sorry. I'm sure things will settle down for you two. Things have been crazy even for this place." The spark between them was obvious even just seeing it in passing. Steve had faith in love to overcome a lot worse than times of stress. "Just stick it out." He put a hand on the man's shoulder. "It'll be worth it. As long as you two have known each other, I'm guessing it's not the first time you've disagreed."
Clearly pissed, Sabretooth yanked the arrow from his eye - dragging a respectable amount of soft tissue with it - and managed to squirm out from under the Hulk's foot. The green monstrosity swiped at him, but he nimbly avoided the attack. Glowering at Steve with his good eye, he scooped up Mystique's limp form. He smirked, baring sharp fangs. "Just gettin' started, boyscout. Wait 'til you see what Loki's got planned..."
Tony let out a soft, shaky moan at the friction. Like his partner, the mortal's arousal was building gradually, but the god had a way of touching and moving that still managed to draw light jolts of pleasure and soft sounds of the same from him. //Jesus, he's good at this,// Tony reflected, his hands sliding over the long, lean body before him. He broke the kiss to move his lips along Loki's jaw, down his throat to his collarbone. As Tony licked and sucked at the pale, blue-tinged flesh, his fingers followed the lower line of his partner's abs down to his waistband, teasing at the barrier of fabric lightly.
The woman was on her feet in a second and flinging her arms around Tony's neck. "If you ever," she said carefully against his skin, "ever do anything like that to us again, I will kill you. Honestly kill you." Pepper took a shaky breath and squeezed her eyes closed before finally drawing away. She gave Steve a hug as well, observing with a smile, "You're looking better already."
Darien was pretty sure someone sounding as sexy as Nat did in that moment should be illegal. If he hadn't already been working to get off, he would've started then. He bit his lip to keep from making any sound that might interrupt the pair. The truth was that he wanted to see the end of the show too.
Though he was rather thoroughly wrapped up in his beer, Clint finally took note of the underhanded ribbing he was getting. "Oh, I know how to dance," he said, not bothering to lean back and give the other two more space. He lowered his voice slightly, his expression turning sly. "It's just the kind of dancing that's pretty similar to foreplay."
Coulson nodded his agreement. "It's not a scientific method to gauge by, but it's a start." Until they had a better strategy, it was something. "I keep trying to get Fury to say something about Thor. He won't. It's a bad sign."
Nat was more than aware that she'd been put in a position of playing baby-sitter in their particular group. Loki had wounded her by hurting the people around her. Clint and Coulson had suffered far more directly. They frankly still weren't sure how the latter was up and walking around. "The difference is that this time we know. We also know that we can beat him because we have. Even when he had an alien army behind him." The redhead gave a casual shrug. "This should be cake."
Logan relaxed as another drink was set before him, then turned his attention back to Steve. "Not drinkin' anything?"
Fitz lit up like a Christmas tree at the sight of Bruce by Jemma' side. "Brilliant! We were worried that, well, that you wouldn't- but, brilliant!"
"It is. In case you haven't noticed, things are going very poorly at the moment." He'd been thinking of confronting Fury for months, and it finally seemed like the time had come to stop waiting. "Director, we're both grown ups. I don't believe in miracles or fairy tales, which is why I know I should be dead right now. It's why I know you're hiding something important. If there's any chance that whatever put me back in one piece could reactivate the serum, I think now would be a really good time to stop playing coy."
Tony's head lolled drunkenly, and he barely managed a murmured "Yeah," as he got on his feet. His legs quaked dangerously, while his entire body followed suit. He was shaking like a puppy left out on a cold and rainy night. He could not even begin to process what had happened. His mind whirled with the events, but one thing was abundantly clear: he had confessed his true feelings for Steve over a broadcast channel. How could he ever face him again?
That was all the cue it took for Steve to take the helm. "Agent Coulson, you're with Widow, Hawkeye, and Logan." If anyone in the world could hope to keep Logan in check, it would be Phil Coulson. Barring that, Natasha wasn't likely to let anyone step out of line unless the situation called for it. "Mr. Summers, would you be willing to take point here with Fawkes, keep us up to date on the big picture?"
Fury bridged his fingertips together and slouched back casually in his chair, counter to everyone else's tense postures. "Loki's not one to go it alone. He knows he can't stand toe-to-toe with his brother, or with us. He knows a regular army wouldn't work," he glanced at Bruce, "and he knows that he can't easily drive a wedge between the bunch of you, so he's got to have a different strategy."
Bruce cringed. Clint looked more like a wounded animal than a person, cornered and terrified. He could relate to that on a very uncomfortable level. The scientist gently slid a hand onto Clint's shoulder. "Clint... Thor's not going to let him hurt anyone, and you don't need to hurt him. He's a prisoner. You don't kill prisoners in cold blood. That's not you," he insisted quietly, relieved when Clint seemed to relax and nod faintly, settling back on the edge of the gurney. "He did help you."
"Safest with you," Steve muttered against Tony's skin. He couldn't seem to talk himself into stopping long enough to say more, not with Tony twitching and gasping against him. He'd thought he would never hear those sounds again or feel the heat of his lover's body. The idea alone drew a ragged groan from Steve as he pressed himself in more firmly against Tony. He knew eventually that he'd need to give Tony enough room to breathe properly. Eventually. In the meanwhile, Steve nipped and sucked at the already-red skin.
Phil suspected he looked as stricken as he felt. He really didn't mind putting his own ass on the line. Most of the time he could stand putting Clint and Natasha in the line of fire too because he trusted in the plans they made and in the strength of them both to overcome what the universe threw their way. Being confined with Creed was something else, and the thought of what he might do to Clint worried him on a deeper level than he'd expected. It was a grenade he honestly couldn't throw himself on without risking Clint's life as well as his safety. No matter how good a job Clint was doing trying to look as if he wasn't in searing pain, Phil knew. He knew, and he wanted to stop it so much that he could hardly breathe. "Clint," he said, hoping to draw the man's attention away from the blood and away from Victor. He knelt down, not daring to move in closer no matter how badly he wanted to. "Look at me."
"As long as you're there," Clint decided. He felt a little pathetic being so clingy, but he didn't want to let Phil out of his sight. He wasn't sure if it was protectiveness or insecurity, but he wasn't in the mood to figure it out at the moment. The confirmation that Tony was dead made him feel even less inclined to leave his handler's side. It hurt. While he was by no means Stark's biggest fan, he knew how it had to have affected Steve. And it hurt on a more personal level, too, knowing they'd lost a teammate. The fact that Steve would be getting back to normal and that Nat was off kicking some Asgardian butt was small consolation. With a heavy sigh, Clint shoved himself out of the bed and went to clean himself up a bit in the bathroom before locating some of his street clothes that he'd left in a pile in the corner. Once dressed, he located his gray hoodie and tugged it on over everything else. It was reassuring somehow being so thoroughly covered.
Though there's nothing super harsh, there are definite homophobic leanings during the press conference. Reporters are dicks.
"That's weird, Nick. Never wanted to hear you say 'spanking'." Tony took a bit of satisfaction from the twinge of annoyance on Fury's face.
Coulson tried not to let the remark get under his skin, but it was an important reminder. He could have been Clint's father or close to it, and the idea wasn't exactly a comfortable one given how often his thoughts about Clint headed straight into the gutter. Instead of putting anymore thought into it, he tried to focus on finishing up and plating dinner for them. "Hopefully it will meet your high standards. I know it's no blue box macaroni," Coulson teased as he set the food down on the table alongside Clint's salads.
Phil shifted first, kissing the top of Clint's head. "I could put on a movie. And you are staying the night," he added to Natasha, "but I have a king size bed. You don't need to sleep on the couch." He smiled wryly. "No one's getting laid for awhile, so you might as well be comfortable." He supposed it should've sounded crazier than it did, but somehow crazy had become their default. Natasha staying with them made as much sense as anything else they'd done. He knew it would be a comfort to Clint, and frankly he didn't mind the idea of a little extra back-up either just in case.
"You missed the whole 'the world wants to speak to you about'... er, well," Clint cleared his throat and suddenly felt like there was no way he could avoid shoving his foot in his mouth.
"No, just clarifying." Phil let his arm slide across Clint's chest, seeking intimacy more than establishing possession. "As long as I get to keep mine, it's fine."
Obviously annoyed with his less-than-perfect landing, Bruce grunted as he finally disengaged from the chute. "You'd think SHIELD would've come up with some no-tangle ones or something," he groused.
"Nevermind," Loki replied, waving the words away as though they didn't matter. He rarely said anything inconsequential, but Stark wasn't likely to ever let him close enough to know whether it was true or not. Even if he did, his friends never would. It was stupid to think of it. Thor had never trusted him or put in any true faith in him. Frigga had, perhaps, for a time, but even her dreams had ultimately been hung on Thor's shoulders and not his own. "It's nothing for you to worry about, Mr. Stark."
"Shh, it's okay. It's okay, Coulson. Phil. You'll be alright. We'll be alright," Clint soothed, trying and only partially succeeding at keeping the tremor from his own voice. It was like getting punched in the throat to see the man so traumatized. It was hard to breathe, to think, but Clint made himself. Phil needed him to keep it together, because his handler was obviously struggling with that right at the moment. Clint gently slid his hand behind Phil's head and leaned in, pressing their foreheads together. "We're still alive, and we're gonna get out of here eventually, so we have to hang on, okay?" He swallowed hard around the lump in his throat, unsure if he believed the words.
Tony rolled his eyes. "It's not sorcery, you big idiot. First? Doesn't exist. Second? You're a dick. Third? He was actually kind of hoping to join the team."
"Then passage you shall have, my lady." The gate keeper's expression never changed, but Sif would have sworn she could see a hint of a smile in his eyes as he opened the bridge to take her to Midgard and, hopefully, to the Avengers.
Clint raised an eyebrow, then nodded and sighed. "Yeah, yeah. Living in Fury's dry zone. I notice he never cuts Tony Stark off," the archer pouted. "So, since Logan might suspect something if I show up and hang out in his suite, any ideas how we're gonna watch him?"
"Mind?" Logan grinned faintly as he grabbed Scott's hips, holding him away a little so that he could thrust lightly into the other man. "Think I might lose it a little if you don't do somethin' soon," he said, loosening his grip on his lover. His hands stayed in place, though, as if to remind Scott just who was ultimately in charge.
Natasha helped Steve find his feet and got the door, bumping it open with her hip. She cast a pointed glance at Coulson, who immediately texted word to the medical staff to close in and be ready with a stretcher.
"Tash, no maiming other agents," Clint said with a smirk. He arched an eyebrow at her. "I can tell what you're thinking, and it's not okay, because if you start beating people up, I'll have to throw in, too, and then Fury's gonna throw us both back in the cell block." It was one thing to imagine the word getting out to the main team. If everyone else knew, Clint was going to find out who in medical had blabbed and roll them up.
Even Darien's breath caught at the sight of her pale skin against the leather encasing Clint's muscular legs. The two of them were living pornography - he just wished Nat was a little less female. //Then again, if it was that hot I probably would've cum in my pants already.//
Clint pulled Phil's hand to his mouth to press a kiss to the back of it and smiled ruefully. "You know, once I got out of containment, they actually did try to put me with a couple other handlers. When they still thought you were..." It was his turn to remind himself not to crush Phil's hand. "Well, let's just say, I might've gotten myself labeled as Ward 2.0. Apparently, I was too hard-headed. Or maybe I just didn't wanna hear anyone's voice in my ear telling me what to do." The archer had never been a follower. It was the entire reason Nat was alive and working for SHIELD. It was the reason he'd gone through three handlers prior to getting assigned to Coulson and the reason SHIELD had been on the verge of having him 'put down.' But Phil had given the archer the stability he'd never had, someone to depend on. And that had made it a lot easier to deal with - and eventually oddly enjoy - being told what to do. At least when Phil was the one holding the reins.
Feeling Tony sinking inside him was, simply put, perfect. Steve's eyes fluttered closed, his lashes dark against his cheeks. He let the loss of his sight focus the sensation in until all he felt was Tony. He could smell the man's cologne and a hint of sweat, he felt the small centers of pressure as Tony's fingers dug into his hips, and Steve relaxed into the couch to just let himself enjoy it. He'd been eager to have it, and Steve didn't want to miss cataloging a single sensation in his mental library. "Gonna paint you like this later," Steve murmured, "the way you look... just for me."
"Scott... Nnn... fuck, yes," Logan rumbled, thrusting into his lover, his hands bracing on the wall to either side of Scott's chest. He pressed his forehead to the wall beside Scott's head, reveling in the press of their bodies and the scent of sweat and sex that filled his senses. It was difficult to keep any sense of rationality about him as only thoughts of fucking Scott filled his mind. The man had an effect on Logan that was truly primal, and it was everything Logan could do to keep his wits in any sense when Scott was wrapped around him in every sense of the word.
"C-contrary to popular belief, turnabout is actually really mean," Tony pointed out breathlessly, his fingers pressing against the wall as if doing so would somehow help him retain his grip on reality. Seeing Steve Rogers kneeling on the floor, looking up at him with darkened blue eyes, was almost enough to make him lose all his sanity. Knowing that Steve wouldn't relent until he'd had his revenge, Tony finally managed, "I think you were gonna suck me off... but if you changed your mind, I'll be needing a straight jacket."
Phil reached up, briefly tracing his fingers over Clint's bicep. "I think you'd look good with some art. Your arms are gorgeous. Anything that draws attention to them... well, wouldn't be so bad." He shared a smile with the other man as they drifted toward one of the side stages. "Want to grab a spot in the shade for awhile?" There were few trees in the field serving as a makeshift stadium, and the idea of curling up under one of them for awhile with Clint settled in against him was tempting even with so much left to see.
It occurred to Tony distantly that it was an oddly affectionate compliment, but he was too focused on the present situation to really analyze it in-depth. The genius could multitask at a lot of things, but when it came to sex, he had an uncharacteristic degree of focus. Besides which, Tony could feel his climax nearing, and one hand reached down to wrap around his own cock as he watched Steve's face. The man's fair skin, flushed with arousal and exertion... his face fixed in an expression of arousal... his full lips parted with pleasure... Steve looked like the archetype for every Greek god that had ever been thought up. //And I get to play with him,// Tony reflected, smiling briefly only to have the expression wiped away as another wave of arousal surged through him. "Fuck..." he gasped, tensing.
Thor frowned. "It could work. You clearly have a strong heart, friend Hawk, since you are not obviously aching to have the hammer with you right now. But if you wield it again, that could change."
Beneath the table, Phil let his hand stray over to give Clint's a quick squeeze. He felt his shoulders relax at the touch, at the gentle reminder of Clint's presence. That was all it took. "I think it will definitely be a fitting tribute," he agreed quietly.
Thor couldn't help but pity Loki a little. His brother was earnestly trying to make up to the Avengers, but there wasn't a clear path to doing so. The thunder god moved to stand behind his brother, not as a threat but as a show of solidarity. He kept his hands to himself, though, not wanting Loki to feel like he was about to get roughed up or as if he was being patronized.
"If you start to sing, I'll punch you, adamantium skeleton or no," Scott grumbled in return, though he smirked a second later. "Yeah, maybe being a total dick to you was the same. As it turns out, maybe I was just desperately sexually repressed and subconsciously knew that you would be a really good option to take care of that." He leaned in and kissed Logan thoroughly only to sag back down onto the bed, exhausted. "I need sleep."
That was most definitely a personal question. In fact Steve was fairly certain that it was personal enough to step over some sort of line well past personal. He almost refused to answer but thought better of it. He'd more or less just asked Tony if the man had slept with someone other than Pepper recently, and he'd answered without hesitation. Would it really be fair not to be just as honest? It seemed like Tony was trying to help and understand. That was a good thing for them as teammates and maybe even friends.
Tony looked up and grinned, then dove in for a heated kiss as his hand deftly unfastened Steve's slacks. He lightly teased the man's swelling cock through his underwear before his fingers snaked in to wrap around the pulsing flesh. The billionaire groaned and ground his hips against Steve at the sensation of the thick cock pulsing in his fingers. It was almost frightening how much simply touching Steve or being near the other man turned him on. Tony wasn't used to feeling as if he'd completely lose his mind just by being close to someone, just by thinking about them. It was more than just hormones, much as he liked to tell himself otherwise. //Stop thinking... stop it...// Focusing more thoroughly on sensation, Tony drew away from Steve's lips only to start working his lightly stubbled throat, moaning soft words of encouragement and arousal.
Scott almost cautioned her against it, told the woman that he was hoping to stay out of things for awhile, then subsided. It didn't matter. They were enjoying themselves, and besides, being out of the line of duty for awhile didn't mean forever. "Thanks." He took in the grouping on her target and nodded his approval. "That's impressive."
Logan had to fight to keep his head. "I... You gotta... lock me up, Coulson," he grated out, his hand clenching at his side. Adamantium blade tips glinted in the room's lights as Logan wavered between keeping his cool and doing the unthinkable.
"Yeah, and maybe a little something stronger to go with it." Clint should have known from the start that Phil would be able to detect his presence. No matter how adept he might be at his profession, there simply was no concealing himself from Agent Coulson. "Before you say anything, I'd just like to reiterate I know you're more than capable of taking care of yourself." Clint fixed the other man with a steely look, his brow furrowing as he added, "But I'm not leaving you alone with someone as dangerous as him."
"I think if I knew that, I'd be a lot less of a mess," Scott answered with a snort, "but maybe. I just know I should figure it out." He knew how it sounded, how it was. He was talking about walking away from the only thing he really knew how to do. "I should learn to tend bar or something. I don't think SHIELD will appreciate me hanging out here if I'm not doing field work." He paused. "I guess there's paperwork. I can probably file things, maintain the motor pool or something."
Clint wanted to squirm under Coulson's scrutiny. He felt his pulse spike as he gathered his thoughts to explain. "I... the hammer for one thing," he said. "And... and Loki." He wrapped his hands around his coffee mug as if holding onto it might somehow keep him on an even keel. "He... I don't know what that new staff does, but he was going to either kill me or p..." he swallowed hard, "...possess me again. And you." He took a shaky breath, taking a few more seconds to gather his thoughts as he stared a hole through one of the walls. He finally looked back to Coulson. "If it hadn't been for the hammer, both of us... but... we were on the plane, and I could already feel it eating away at me." He stared at his coffee. "Not sure I'm more afraid of losing my teammates or losing myself." It had been more terrifying, he realized, that it had been Coulson. His handler was the one person that Clint was comfortable with aside from Nat. The two of them meant everything to him. The idea that he wouldn't have been able to save Phil without the hammer was utterly terrifying.
“It means that as soon as they’re willing to let you go, Agent Coulson will get you back to the suite. I don’t want you stuck in here.” What had happened to Bucky wasn’t his fault, and even if the suite wasn’t exactly freedom, Steve wanted Bucky to at least feel comfortable. “This whole thing, it’s gonna take a lot of getting used to for everybody, but we’re going to figure it out. You’re still my best friend.” Seeing him shaky and uncertain disturbed Steve. Bucky had always been the most solid, stable person in his life. “You’re used to fixing everything for everybody, but right now you’re the one who needs help. Let us take care of you.”
After submitting the report, Logan shut the terminal down, stood, and stretched, then quickly returned to the living room. He raised an eyebrow and smirked faintly at Scott, crossing his arms over his chest. "Alright, paper work's done. You were sayin'?"
Loki had no such qualms. He bent and snatched the hammer in one smooth motion, throwing it toward his brother without concern for whether Thor would actually catch it or not and pressed his hands to the side of Barton's face before the archer had a chance to retaliate. "Forgive me, Mr. Barton, but I didn't think you would be as amenable if I asked nicely."
Steve covered his face with his hands and groaned. "Tony..." He couldn't bring himself to really scold the man when it was ultimately the reporter's fault for invading their privacy. He sighed and fixed his date with a level stare. "So is she really?" Steve broke into a smile and  looked up at the sound of yelling. "I guess that's a yes. People in glass houses need to learn to stop throwing so many stones." It was frustrating that they were the subject of so much scrutiny simply by virtue of being attracted to each other and wanting to explore it. He felt sure that there had to be more important things going on in the world. "You're an awful influence. Really. I should care that his marriage is falling apart on the phone in a middle of a restaurant... and instead I'm kind of thinking he deserves it."
Steve took a seat right next to the billionaire and found himself progressively more worried by the fact that Tony wasn't talking. Tony Stark, the man who never shut up, wasn't talking. He opened his mouth several times to break the silence but always ended up shutting it again. What could he say? Of course Tony blamed him for what had happened. Of course Tony felt terrible. There was nothing to say. By the time they reached headquarters, Steve's stomach was in knots, and he didn't even have the strength to protest when Natasha insisted he help Bruce instead of following Tony. Instead they parted ways in the hall as Tony was taken one way to detox and Bucky was taken another. Bruce was in charge of finding out how bad things were and whether there was any chance of finding the man he had once been inside the Soldier.
"You should be careful with him, Tony," Steve cautioned once Logan had left the room. "He likes you alright so far, but there's a lot of cracks already started. You push too hard, you're bound to break something." He didn't want to see Tony get hurt or Logan end up in a SHIELD holding facility because he'd gone off on their resident playboy genius. "Tell him everything, but tell him when he asks." Some things Logan didn't remember might be for the best. Certainly Steve could allow that there were a few things he wouldn't mind scrubbing from his memory, and he knew Tony had more than his share too. "I'm gonna go see if we can help get him some new clothes or anything. You coming?"
Clint managed to slip back to his room without anyone catching him running around in barely more than his tighty whities, and he was soon dressed in a loose-fitting charcoal gray hoodie and jeans. When Coulson arrived at the door to the cell block, Clint looked far from pleased. "Looks like they've revoked my access. I guess Fury didn't like your report about me and the hammer. If I had to guess."
Jemma smiled, though it faded into something like a wince when she suggested, "Everything?" The young woman laughed and took a sip of her hot chocolate. "Honestly, I'd love to hear anything you remember. We have some files, things that people have gathered from Thor or Loki, but it's all piecemeal, and not very satisfying. It's an alien world! What was the Bifrost like?" The bridge sounded absolutely awe-inspiring even when reading between the lines of a rather dry report.
Steve let out a shaky breath and then smiled. "Yeah, I think I did." It was easier to fall to his knees than to stay standing anyway, so Steve reversed their positions with as much grace as he could manage when he was drunk on pleasure. Even when he was face to face with the other man's bulge, Steve took his time. He nipped at the inside of Tony's thigh and mouthed at the hot press of the man's cock against the fabric. Finally Steve unfastened Tony's pants with agonizingly deliberate movements and followed by dragging his boxers down. He licked a long stripe over the head of Tony's cock and smiled. "Now what was it I promised?"
Clint watched the whole ordeal, too horrified by the gun's effects on Steve to feel even the slightest hint of relief that Nat was better. He felt like he should say something, tell Steve to stop. He bit his tongue, though. If that was anyone's job, it was Tony's.
"Not too fast," Phil cautioned. He couldn't look away. He couldn't do anything but watch Clint's beautiful lips parting to take him in like he didn't have the slightest bit of hesitation. It struck him that Clint had probably been a porn star in a past life to look so beautiful on his knees. "But don't stop." Stopping would have resulted at best in him losing what was left of his mind. Clint looked as dazed and stunned by the whole situation as he felt, and that was comforting to see. "You are so incredibly hot..."
Steve had taken the bait and all Tony had to do was reel him in. "From time to time," he went on smoothly. "Does that surprise you? I can tell it does. I suppose someone with your old fashioned values would find the idea shocking." Tony smiled, enjoying teasing Steve far more than he was willing to admit. "We'll have to see that you broaden your horizons. I mean, I can understand how awkward it must be to feel out of sorts all the time." He continued to scrutinize the other man and decided to push the boat out a little further. "Since you hail from a more innocent time, mind if I ask you a personal question there, Cap? Are you still a virgin?"
Natasha stiffened at the news, her gaze narrowed. She tensed and then sighed, leaning against the wall. There were a lot of potential reasons, a lot of explanations. "Let's keep that between us for now," she finally decided. Steve didn't need to hear it unless Tony had been forced. Even considering the implications of the alternative, she didn't hope for that. "Right now let's all be happy he's alive. We can worry about him having terrible coping skills and making awful life choices later." Natasha pushed herself off the wall and started back toward the elevator. "You should rest too. I can spell Scott giving Lady Sif something to do. You boys deserve the downtime as much as anyone."
The words had sent a chill even through Jemma's body. She could barely imagine what the loss felt like for Bruce. "We won't have it done in time for this round, but if he decides to keep using the suit, we can certainly see what can be done with integrating things, perhaps even... well, perhaps modifying the suit that Mr. Stark was working on. He's left some notes, a few bits of programming. Stark Industries owns most of it, but I suspect that Ms. Potts might release a thing or two for the sake of keeping Captain Rogers safe." They'd reached the tower, but Jemma was reluctant to pull away. "If you... it sounds silly, but if you need anything? Just come by. I'll probably be in the lab half the night anyway. I find I don't sleep a great deal before days like tomorrow."
"To Fury," Steve affirmed with a curt nod as he rose. He stopped himself short of holding out a hand to Tony. He knew from experience that holding hands with the suit wasn't entirely comforting, and he'd been plenty unprofessional about the whole thing already. Not that anyone had said anything. Not that they would. Still, he preferred to keep at least a shred of dignity. He flashed Bruce a smile. "Get some rest, do your paperwork. Tell Dr. Simmons that I'll check in with her as soon as I'm able. I'm sure Jarvis will make sure she has the readouts in the meantime." He turned to Tony and the smile brightened considerably despite the duty ahead of them. "Ready?"
Coulson could feel a strange, humming energy singing through his arm. He knew without trying that if he wanted to, he could have swung the hammer and taken out the closest wall. Instead he dropped it onto the pedestal like it was burning his hand and took a step back. "I think Howard Stark was right for once," he informed Clint grimly before taking another step away from the thing. "No one touches it if they can help it," he informed the closest researcher, a sprightly girl who didn't look half old enough to be in such a sensitive position.
"Telepathy. Grey's got some mild telekinesis, Xavier's got some other, more expansive abilities that he keeps very much on the down low." Coulson glanced sideways at Clint, wondering if the agent would have been so brazen if he'd known what the pair could do. "The people in that mansion could tear the world apart if they chose to. It's a testament to the kind of people they are that they don't. They choose to help, to try to fight the fight the right way." It was hard not to respect Xavier even if Coulson thought he took his nonviolent principles too far at times.
Clint's smile waned a little and he poked at his beer bottle. "Maybe." It seemed a little weird to invite the man in for a fuck while Nat was still being held prisoner by a god who was basically a big old bag of crazy. It felt even weirder to think of possibly having Darien around just to talk to. He glanced at Coulson. "If I do that, what're you gonna do to keep from going crazy?" It occurred to him that he really didn't even know what Coulson did in his spare time, or how he would distract himself from losing his marbles over the whole thing. //He could just be trying to get you to go home and let him get on with his life,// Clint reminded himself.
The kiss did more to ease Steve's panic than anything had since he woke up, and the water soothed his parched throat. "Okay. I just... don't... you don't have to stay. I want you to so much, Tony, I love you, but you don't... you don't have to." It was selfish, and he knew it, throwing in words of affection even while he was trying to absolve Tony from the promises they'd made to each other. He wanted to hold Tony close and know that they would never have to be apart. He also knew that no one on the team, no matter what they'd read in a file, would be able to understand what a mess he really was without the serum. With that said, Steve subsided for a moment and let Tony replace the oxygen mask.
Steve looked a little goofy in the shirt, but it made Tony grin in an absurdly adoring fashion. "I like it," he said, nodding his approval. It had been a little jarring to see Steve shirtless, but reassuring as well. Tony had been worried that he'd freak out somehow, that he'd handle it all the wrong ways, but it was fine. He tugged Steve up into a slow kiss, trying to get used to having to lean down to capture the blonde's lips. It still felt good kissing him, though. No change in size could ever alter that. Tony smiled. "Love you."
Over the comm, Steve informed them, "Widow, Hawkeye and Agent Coulson will be on the ground with you in a minute. Bruce, it's time to let the big guy out to play."
Relieved to be taking Steve out of there, Tony grasped the wheelchair handles and did as he was told for once. Knowing the tower as he did, Tony managed to whisk Steve back up to his room with no one the wiser. The moment he got in the door, he leaned down and kissed Steve slow and deep before drawing away. "Welcome home," he said with a smile and a grand sweep of his hand. "Need anything to eat? Coffee?"
"I think I'd be okay with that." He liked the way Tony's eyes were shining, and he liked the taste of the wine on his tongue. Steve took a seat on the couch and patted the spot next to him. "C'mon, it's lonely over here." For however long they had before Loki surfaced, Steve wanted to be as close as possible to Tony. Once they were done with the wine, he intended fully to climb into the man's lap and not leave it until he absolutely had to. "And chilly without you. You don't want me catching cold, right?"
Phil ducked his head to hide a broader smile at the image of Clint chasing down mythical monsters on Asgard.
Scott couldn't really agree. He wasn't sure he could have killed his own brother. He'd read the files, and he understood why Thor had shown mercy. Given the outcome, it had probably been the wrong decision on a million levels, but it was a decision he would have made in the same place. "Fury wants to touch base in a few hours, once Steve has a chance to... to rest. Want to go back to your room until then?"
He gave Bucky a bit of time and space before making his way back to the infirmary. As usual he had a pile of paperwork to get through, and besides that, he doubted Bucky was feeling entirely happy at the news that Steve was spending his night out with Tony. “Mind a little company?” Phil inquired as he shifted the curtain to one side.
"Just for that..." She rested her elbow on Clint's shoulder like he was there solely for her comfort and nodded her approval of his continuing to speak. "Go on."
His breakfast was cold on the roll around table by the time Tony woke, but he still forced it down. He was already feeling a good deal better. Sore, but better. Noting that his IV was empty and that the nurses were gone, Tony started working to pull the lines out of his arm. He'd had enough of sitting still. //Didn't even have any real internal injuries... this is ridiculous.//
In the commotion, Coulson had managed to get to the shelves. He grabbed Steve's shield, flinging it in the man's general direction and knowing it would be caught or retrieved shortly. He wasn't a coward, but he wasn't stupid either. As probably the most physically fragile person present, giving himself as a target to Loki a second time would be an unforgivable distraction for the team. He caught sight of Bruce huddled in the corner and doing what looked to be deep breathing exercises. "We need you in there. This isn't a lot of space, but we've got Asgardian weapons in play now. Clint has one, and I don't know if he can handle it. We need to contain this."
Small amounts of plot, heavy dose of smut - in this case, Victor/Loki. Not your scene? You can skip this one without missing a lot that will mess up continuity for you.
"I think it's a good idea. The agents watching them didn't really talk to either of them before, so they won't notice the changes," Coulson said.
Logan teased for only a moment more before he lost the restraint he needed to do so. With a slight shift, he sheathed himself in his lover once more, grunting his pleasure. His hands tightened on the man's thighs as he withdrew only to slam forward hard once more, seemingly having forgotten his intent to keep things slow and easy. "Fuck, you feel good," he growled as he continued the rough, steady thrusts.
With anyone else, Phil knew he would have hesitated to strip down. He was bruised and battered, and seeing that made it feel more real. It was good for the healing process. He knew that intellectually. Less intellectually, he wanted to take his meds and hide away from the pain. Instead he dealt with things in what he felt was a slightly better adjusted way. He curled up in bed and let himself get wrapped up in Clint's comforting warmth. He couldn't resist kissing Clint's forehead and thanking god silently for the fact that they could still touch each other without flinching. It meant that with time and effort and space, they would get to a better place. Clint was absolutely right. "Sweet dreams."
"I like that plan," Tony decided, curling his arm under Steve's head to toy with soft blonde hair. He sighed. "Of course, you know that he'd just send Nat in through the window or something equally creepy-spy-like if he wanted to get in touch. Then again, throwing the phones in the wood chipper would make it clear just how little we want to hear from him. Maybe he'd avoid bothering us unnecessarily." He let his head fall back against the couch as well, turning his face so that he could press his forehead to Steve's. "Maybe I'll bring a bottle of vodka to distract Romanov if he sends her to find us."
Once he'd gotten cleaned up, he moved back to the waiting room. He was so exhausted that he fell asleep almost as soon as he stopped moving, his head propped back against the wall.
Fitz' expression of disgust at the familiar address evaporated for a moment at that thought. "And apart from the science-y checking, I'm assuming Captain Rogers vetted him, yeah? Things that only, uh, they would know?" He didn't want to know a single one of those things, but it seemed fair.
"You don't know that," Tony snapped irritably. He wasn't mad at Coulson, but he was at the end of his ability to stay polite and quiet. "This... this is some Asgardian techno-magic shit, and none of us really knows what it is. We're cavemen with rail guns, and we just reverse engineered that... that thing overnight and on zero sleep." His voice softened as his eyes fixed, unseeing, on the wall next to Phil's head. "We don't know what it's done..." That was it. He'd created something that had obviously hurt and might kill the man he loved. Tony was used to using himself as a guinea pig when he'd come up with a new toy, but this... He wasn't sure if it was harder to deal with not knowing the gun's effects or with knowing that he was a big part of creating the gun in the first place.
"You... are going... to give me a heart attack," Tony murmured as he pressed a few kisses to whatever part of Steve he could reach without really moving too much. "Or brain damage. I'm not sure how long I'm supposed to be able to live with this much blood below my neckline." It was frustrating, sure, but the teasing was also rather endearing. In a maddening way. "Damn you and your discipline."
Tony grinned sarcastically. "Oh, good. Is this going to be the same fantastic timing as with the Hydra weapons, or...?"
Coulson accepted the offer with an apologetic smile. "I'm sorry for interrupting, but I was hoping we could speak."
Logan followed Scott's blast with one of his own, staggering as the weapon drained him further still. "Son of a bitch," he grated, struggling to keep his feet under himself. Loki, though obviously worse for wear, was still standing. "Stark... I don't... think this is working."
At that Coulson chuckled as well. "Like you said - I've seen worse." His own sex life had never been quite so adventurous, but he certainly wasn't about to judge Clint for the choices he'd made. They weren't bad for the team or for Clint. Safe, sane sexual encounters with willing partners wer a reasonable way to pass the time. "What you do on your own time - and who - is your business. SHIELD doesn't care, and I sure as hell don't as long as you're careful. I mean that on all levels." Given Clint's proclivities, Coulson had made it more of a priority to check on the man's medical results more regularly. He held up a hand to ward off any protests. "Before you call me 'dad' again... I worry about all of you. It's very literally my job."
"I called him," Scott answered with a roll of his eyes. "I didn't ever exactly have to do the tenure track at Xavier's." It was an easy lie to sell simply because it was, in part, true. Proving himself to SHIELD was strange when he'd been so used to being accepted outright at the school. "I was kind of hoping to skip a grade or two."
“We won't give him a choice. Thanks again for the coffee," he added to Darien, earning a wave in return. Once they were out of Darien's earshot, Phil observed, "He's cute. And the coffee is excellent." He knew that Clint wasn’t just hiding his face because of his hangover. The hoodie was another wall to block out the world.
"So are we, ma'am," Steve broke in, holding his hand out. He saw her hesitate, but soon Sif clasped his forearm, and he returned the gesture firmly. "I'm Steve Rogers. This is Bruce Banner, Natasha Romanoff, Melinda May, Logan, Scott Summers, and Nick Fury. We're the Avengers."
Steve didn’t look so sure, but he crossed over to the bed anyway and tried to smile. “How are you doing?” He didn’t know what Coulson or anyone else had been obligated to do to keep Bucky down.
Clint looked surprised. "How long have we known each other? I had no idea you wore glasses," he said, reflecting absently that they looked good on Phil. Kind of appropriate, all things considered, though Clint had to fight back the urge to make a 'dad' joke. "No need to apologize. I mean, who're you dressing up for?" he asked as they approached the ticket kiosk.
"It saves my sanity," Phil answered. He caught sight of the look on Clint's face, contemplative, and it wasn't too difficult to follow the progression of his thoughts. "The only time I ever thought of transferring you was about a week in. Tense op, and you didn't listen to a damn thing I said. Then the really annoying part was that you did everything perfectly. Everyone got home without a scratch, and it was perfect." He threw some bacon in a pan and then started chopping things up to throw into the eggs. "So I hung in there. Fury wanted me to give you up after you brought Natasha in. He was furious. I had seen the intel, I heard the chatter... you did the right thing. That was the only time he ever asked. I was angry enough to get a raise out of it."
In which Loki plays games, Logan makes questionable choices, and Scott gets a gift that may come with strings attached.
Logan tensed, his pulse skipping a beat as he stared at his coffee cup. His mind raced, reaching for ideas of what to say or do in response. He wanted to just grab Scott and drag him right back into the bed, but that wasn't compatible with Scott’s hangover. Finally looking up, Logan nodded slowly. "Alright," he said. There was an awkward pause as he tried to remember the other profound things he was going to say. "I guess I just wanted to make sure. People say a lotta stuff when they're drunk. I didn't wanna hurt you. You've been through enough. Didn't wanna mess up us finally gettin’ along if it was just a six-pack talkin'." He shifted nervously. It was weird territory for him. He was used to either putting his sights on someone and getting what he wanted or getting shot down. There was never friendship or abductions hanging over the whole thing.
Coulson couldn't help smiling at that. "I appreciate your enthusiasm. The best lead we have at the moment is a trade cell that seems to be operating in New York City - one of the outer boroughs. We don't have any reason to believe that Mr. Summers has moved through there specifically, but it's the closest point of contact from where he was taken, so it's our best bet for information." The man's smile stretched a bit wider. "How are you at undercover work?"
"Jarvis, we're going to have to talk about you stealing my thunder," Bruce said, still grinning ear to ear as the AI acknowledged him with a tacit "of course, sir." Pleased that the good news was enough to cure even Fitz's sour puss, Bruce looked the data over, eyebrows raised. "That's amazing." He clapped both of them on the back with a big grin. "He's not gonna be thrilled to have his ass saved by a couple of rookies, but... well, you two saved his life. That's pretty damned amazing," he repeated.
Tony frowned. While he had a ridiculously good memory, he hadn't read every last thing in Logan's file, but there was some filename or headline or... something that was bugging him. "There's something. If Loki can access Logan's missing memories... I have a feeling we may be in for trouble. I guess I'll have some reading to do while I get better." He sighed. "Any chance of you smuggling a Big Mac in here for me for lunch? One more carbon patty from the cafeteria and I'll scream."
The next thing Clint knew, he was quite literally being dragged from his sleep. Creed had him by the ankle and was tearing him away from Phil before Clint could even get a bearing on where he was. He'd kicked the mutant in the face before he really remembered where he was and got a bead on what was happening.
Clint felt panic threatening again, and he took a few deep breaths in a semi-effective attempt to calm himself. What did Logan know? What did Loki want with Nat? And where the hell was Thor when his brother was on Earth causing problems? Clint knew he should have been more worried about the former and the latter, but all he could really focus on was Nat and whether they'd actually be getting her back. "Phil..." He almost never called Coulson by his first name, but it seemed weird to call him anything else as he confessed, "I don't wanna think about what he'll do to her to get that information."
"What madness is this?" Thor burst into the room, striding over to Steve and glaring at the image displayed before him. He had witnessed torture before, but he had never seen the likes of this in Asgard. Stripping someone of their dignity and displaying it in such a way was revolting. "Those who took him shall pay. We will tear them asunder!" Thor's muscles bulged, and the thunder god looked fit to reach right through the screen and smash the figure intimidating Tony.
"Too much," Coulson answered. He felt and sounded as tired as he did upset. "He started it. It doesn't matter. When you're on the clock, I expect you to think with the head on your shoulders." For a moment he looked down at his clasped hands. "I wouldn't have expected you to put yourself before a member of the team that way." Looking up again, he met Clint's gaze. "If the tables were turned and Logan did that to Natasha, how would you feel?"
Tony smiled his satisfaction at the confession, shifting his hips back to line himself up before he slowly pushed into the blonde's body. He took it slow, not wanting to hurt Steve. He hummed his pleasure as his hands tightened on the blonde's hips. "You feel so good," he murmured. "So tight, Steve. Fuck..." He began slowly rocking his hips, sinking a little deeper with each shift.
While Tony wouldn't have consciously listed 'being told what to do' as one of his turn-ons, Steve's commanding tone of voice certainly served to raise goosebumps on his skin and distract him from typing in the code right. It took him a few tries before he managed. "Third time's a charm," he muttered. Jarvis started to utter a greeting to them. "Jarvis, get lost for awhile."
"Good!" Tony smiled, moving a little closer to Steve and hooking a finger through one of the man's belt loops. He then approached Logan, one hand out, and tilted his head and raised an eyebrow as the man shied away. "C'mon, you're probably gonna need to be okay with me touching you. Or was making eye contact a challenge? Do I need to let you sniff my hand? Help me out, here."
Loki bit back a retort. The truth was he didn't feel much like talking. The burning stretch of Victor's cock was good. It was even better combined with the renewed grip of his claws. Instead of calling the mutant out on his choice of words, Loki managed, "You talk far too much." Forehead pressed against his own arm as Victor drove into him, Loki pushed back, demanding more. Perhaps after they both took the edge off, something a bit less hurried might be enjoyable. If he decided not to throw Victor out of his room. //We'll see how the evening goes.//
Bruce followed him out. “Well, we got some of the tests in. Looks like we’ve got the worst of it out. He should be in the clear with the drugs tomorrow. At that point... at that point, some of the stuff that’s fuzzy right now may start coming clear. That’s good for us since it may mean information that could help us find Hydra and maybe bad for him since I doubt this is the first time they’ve asked him to do something pretty horrific.”
"I'm not damaged," Clint growled, thumping his fist on the table, then calming a moment later as Coulson put his foot down. Clint scowled in a way that made it clear he disagreed. "Who're you going to give it to? Tony Stark?" he scoffed. He glanced at Steve pointedly, then back to Coulson. "You're being awfully protective of me. If it comes down to it, I'm probably the most expendable. Besides, whatever sort of 'holes' there might be in my defenses, the hammer seemed to patch them up just fine."
Steve considered how much he wanted to say and finally decided he needed to talk to someone. Nat was absolutely out of the question, Coulson was already almost as upset with him as Fury, Bruce was an uncertain equation on the best of days, and Thor had been out of touch for long enough that Steve had mentally written him out of most equations. "Yeah, I guess it is." Steve took a sip of his own steaming mug of coffee before he decided the best way to proceed was to plunge right in. "Tony and I recruited someone the other night, a guy named Logan. I'm pretty sure that should have warranted a memo too, but the Director was a bit sidetracked. Anyway, we recruited him. He and I hit it off and we ended up going out to dinner. We bumped into Tony, told him we were going to a club. We sort of got hijacked," Steve confessed, "but the club was fun. A little too much fun, maybe."
Coulson hesitated and then shook his head. He caught May's eye and shrugged. "No, it isn't. There are weapons, salvaged tech, and... and a few prisoners deemed too dangerous for-" Coulson paused and put a code into a pad on the wall, "for release. Just letting the guards know we're friendly," he explained with a nod to the number pad. "Otherwise they'd be up here in about ten seconds with guns at the ready. I'd like to leave with the same number of holes in my body I have currently."
Coulson pulled off the ear protection and sighed as he sagged against the counter. "Better than that, I just ran out of paper to shoot." He offered Clint a smile and sighed again. "It's nothing. Well, no, it's not nothing, but it's nothing because he won't tell me anything. It's something. It's maybe even something really, really important." Knowing that needed more clarification, he explained quietly, "Whatever is letting me be up and walking around right now... I can't help thinking that might help Steve too."
Clint smirked. "No *permanent* injuries... Means a few broken bones would be okay, right?" he asked with a broad grin. "'Cause those heal. Seriously, though. I can deal with the rumors and the assumptions. If you can." He still meant it, but he was relieved that Phil didn't want to keep their relationship under wraps. He liked the idea that he wouldn't have to watch every word he said or make up cover stories for their dates.
Steve sighed, wondering if they would all get hazard pay for chasing elephants around the city. Not likely. "Alright, we'll split up and- duck!" he finished as a bullet hit the ground by Bruce's feet. He turned to see a blue-skinned woman slinking out of the shadows.
It was Phil's turn to look almost bashful, going slightly pink at the ears and smiling. "Okay. Good. Then I don't think there's anything that you should be scared to talk about." He was satisfied to hear that Clint was staying of his own volition and not out of some misplaced sense of doing right by Natasha. "That said, I think we probably do owe her a drink or something." Phil couldn't believe she'd seen the potential when it had been so off the map for him. "I'm really, really grateful for the chance." He knew it wouldn't be the same as whatever life Clint had hoped he'd find someday with Natasha, but he hoped that it could still be something satisfying for both of them given the opportunity.
Steve arched an eyebrow. That was either a recipe for disaster or an outright lie. He found it difficult to picture someone who could be as offended by the idea of being controlled as Tony Stark. It was nothing short of a miracle that he managed to keep in line as often as he did. "And Director Fury actually read his file?" Steve asked with obvious skepticism. Of course he had. The man had summoned Steve down himself - well, via Agent Hill, but it still counted - and the blond sighed. "Alright, it looks like we have a plane to catch. If Fury wants him in spite of all this, he has to be something pretty special. He couldn't help wondering why Fury wasn't sending Natasha. The redhead could talk most men into doing anything she wanted. //He really must be a tough sell.//
Tony shut his eyes, unable to even glance in Steve's direction or acknowledge him. The drug continued to affect his mind, making him nauseous and lightheaded. Tony did not trust himself for the first time in his life. Any second he might blurt out his feelings for Steve or dissolve into an uncontrollable fit of sobbing over the assault. He steadfastly refused to do either. Tony was vaguely aware of Thor raging around the room, eager to wreak havoc and being reluctantly calmed down. If only his own problems could be solved that easily. He caught a whiff of Steve's scent and nearly lost control of himself. Biting hard on his tongue, Tony barely managed to swallow the words he'd already confessed what seemed like hours ago. Then the memory of Winter Soldier came flooding back in bits and pieces, and Tony's body reacted accordingly. He started to tremble all over again, and felt bile rising to the back of his throat.
"I thought you might want to have a bit of time to dress and eat something. I have scheduled evaluations for you each in an hour."
"You know Bruce?" Steve inquired with surprise before looking back over at Tony. "Yes, he does. Actually, they're pretty close." He'd even experienced the odd twinge of jealousy at how easily Bruce and Tony interacted. When they got off on some tangent about mechanics and engineering, Steve could only look on, utterly lost. He poked Tony in the side with his free hand and pointed out, "You smell like a still. I'm surprised you can even tell what the bar smells like anymore." Steve took the opportunity of Tony protesting to slide his cell phone out and call a cab. As much as he hated constantly being virtually tethered to the device, it certainly had its moments of convenience. "We'll be on our way in a second." Steve tossed a fond smile at the man currently leaning against his side and told Logan, "He's actually brilliant."
The move caught Loki entirely by surprise. He actually froze for the briefest of moments, utterly baffled as Stark's lips collided with his own. He had expected a fight, resistance to the end. Instead he found himself kissing an apparently willing Tony Stark. The man's lips softened against his own. Stark was kissing him. It was unmistakable but still startling enough to take even him by surprise. Loki didn't let his shock stop him from pressing into Tony's personal space and taking advantage, however, his cool fingers rising to trace Stark's jawline.
"Fuck... fuck," Clint growled, surprised and thoroughly turned on by how desperate the man beneath him was. Reaching down, he urged Scott to rise up on his knees and lean back, and Clint looped his arms under Scott's and laced his fingers together behind Scott's neck. Holding him tightly against  his body, Clint started thrusting hard. He didn't worry about trying to last, trying to draw it out. Scott obviously wanted rough and hard and fast, and Clint was more than happy to oblige. "Remember," he hissed into Scott's ear, "you don't cum until I say so."
The god disappeared, taking with him the spell that kept Natasha silent. She let out a stream of curses in Russian and then took a deep breath. "Idiot. Even if he does what he promised, how do you know that's all he'll do... to either one of you?"
Clint was looking for paper towels to mop up the coffee he'd spit all over the counter - Phil had guessed accurately - when the agent mentioned the arrow pajamas. Clint froze, his hand on a paper towel in the puddle of coffee. "They... they make those?" he asked, trying to absorb the idea that he had his own merchandise and that Phil Coulson might be wearing it.
"Made it," Scott answered with a wan smile. "No body to pick up." He met Logan's gaze and added, "I know I keep saying this, but thank you. All that crap before you left... it was stupid. I'm not saying you weren't stupid too," Scott added, "but you... you loved her. The whole thing didn't have to be a mess like it was." He sighed and shook his head. "Not that it matters right now. What does SHIELD need to know to find these guys and shut down every last cockroach running around the operation?"
It was impossible to stifle the soft gasp that the squeeze and the mental image inspired. "You are way less innocent than everyone thinks. You might even be downright dirty," he murmured, sliding his hand down Steve's chest and between his legs to stroke the blonde's cock. He licked his way back up to Steve's ear, his voice dropping to a low growl. "Which just makes me want to fuck you harder, use you like I know you want me to." As if to prove his point, he drew slowly back and slammed his hips forward.
Steve laughed and held Tony tight for a few seconds more. "I love you." He drew himself up to full height - not exactly an impressive thing anymore - and took Tony's hand as they walked down the hall. People were going to stare anyway. He saw no reason not to give them the full show. Steve's fingers twisted up with the other man's, and that helped. It helped to have Tony still by his side and still looking at him like he mattered. Entering the conference room took his breath away for a minute, but Steve managed to return Coulson's warm smile. He was suddenly glad that the man had been there in medical. Coulson already knew, had already seen, and was passing him a file with a few forms needing signatures like it was any other meeting. "Thank you," he said with genuine gratitude as he took his usual seat next to Tony and tried to avoid Fury's gaze for the most part.
Coulson's gaze narrowed for a moment but he apparently decided not to take the bait. "Isn't who you made out with on the dance floor. He isn't part of this issue."
The note of concern in Clint's tone wasn't lost on Phil. "Drink a little, read a little. Maybe sleep." It was an apt description of most of his nights. After his resurrection, his status as breathing hadn't been a secret, precisely, but it had seemed cruel to go looking for his cellist when she had already done her mourning. She deserved more than he could offer given the life he led.
The archer hesitated a moment, then nodded in agreement. "Alright." He took a deep breath, then moved in to shoulder some of Creed's weight. The mutant's scent washed over him, and it took several carefully controlled breaths to keep Clint from throwing up. "Let's get him downstairs," he grated, his free hand closing around the handle for reassurance. Clint was relieved to see that some junior agents had brought them a gurney to dump Creed onto for the rest of the trip. He wasn't remotely interested in hauling the mutant all the way down to the cell block on his shoulder.
Logan shook his head. "They got enough of a picture," Logan decided, pushing himself to his feet. "When they figure it out... If they do, then we can talk with 'em. Otherwise, they can stay outta our business." Logan was starting to get irritated with the whole situation. While he hadn't exactly expected SHIELD to give him all their secrets, he couldn't help but feel that Fury's cloak and dagger routine was a little counterintuitive when it came to holding a team together.
Steve had been caught on the edge of reaching out for the man, of apologizing for hurting his feelings or bringing up a difficult topic. Instead he ended up standing frozen in the doorway with his mouth hanging open. It took several seconds to fully recover, and Steve was still bright red as he made his way back to the front door to retrieve his things. He had no idea how long Tony would be gone, but he was beginning to wonder if moving in was really the best thing. They barely got along as it was. How could some weird, inappropriate crush really help anything? It couldn't. It just gave Tony fodder to torture him, apparently. Steve wondered if he was that transparent or if Tony was just pushing buttons until he found out what got under his skin the fastest.
“In that case, you get as many home cooked meals as you want,” Steve answered with a broad smile. It was hard to believe they’d actually taken the step from light flirtation to actual dating, especially given the circumstances. He briefly closed a hand around Tony’s, then let the contact go so that they could both eat. “My mom taught me to cook when I was little. A lot of stuff around the house I couldn’t really help with, but that didn’t involve a lot of heavy lifting.”
Oblivious to the bloodshed but most definitely not to the sight of Tony half naked, Steve decided it was a good moment to let the boys figure it out for themselves. "S'pose there is plenty to share," he agreed, bright eyes dark in the shadowy room. He drew Tony into a lingering kiss to keep the man from saying anything else that he might regret later on. "Let's get in bed." While standing was working just fine for the preliminaries, Steve knew it would get awkward fast. Thinking ahead, he decided to go ahead and slip out of his jeans before reclining on the comforter with a hint of a smile and an obvious bulge tenting his boxers. "You boys going to join me?"
Clint tensed at the suggestion. "It saved my life," he snapped reflexively, then froze. //That wasn't me.// Shaking faintly, he put the weapon down on the floor of the plane between his feet. His hand tingled as he forcibly let it go, and he rubbed his hand on his pant leg as if trying to rid himself of the feeling.
Scott didn't believe the words at first. He stared into Logan's eyes and could read everything there. A harsh breath left him, and he sagged into Logan's arms again. "I love you too. I think... even before Loki, and all this... I think... I think I pushed too fast. I wanted to be normal and okay, and I don't think I'm okay yet." His eyes fell closed, but he felt oddly at ease discussing so horrific a subject because he was discussing it with Logan. If he hadn't run yet, he wasn't going to. "Getting closer doing this, though."
It was hotter than he'd expected sitting on a bench in plain sight with Logan more or less fucking his mouth. Scott was breathless inside of sixty seconds and ready to climb onto Logan's lap like by minute two. He broke the kiss with a groan and settled twitching fingers on Logan's face. "You do absolutely horrific things to my self control. I really, really like that about you."
"Not as often as you'd think. Some days this," he pointed to himself, "still feels like a loaner." Steve grinned and easily lifted Tony up to straddle his lap. "Now how about you tell me where the lube is - and don't even try to tell me Tony Stark doesn't have lube stashed in his car - and I'll see about getting you just as ready as you've got me." As he spoke Steve began almost absently nibbling at Tony's neck. The man smelled heavenly. Steve was sure there was some sort of expensive cologne involved, but even beneath any chemical enhancement, Tony just plain smelled good. He tasted good. The heat of his body felt good. More than with anybody he'd been with in a long time, being with Tony felt strangely easy - the very last word he would have ever associated with a relationship of any kind involving Stark. //Calm before the storm,// a less optimistic voice sounded in his mind.
Logan turned his head, his teeth clenching on the cigar in his mouth. The pair carried a faint smell of gunpowder and machine grease, reminding him a little too much of other military personnel he'd dealt with. The blonde looked like a poster-boy for Uncle Sam from about seventy years ago, and the other guy looked and smelled like he had too much money and spent too much time in a lab. Neither profile put Logan terribly at ease, especially since they'd somehow found one of his hiding places and made it a point to plop down next to him at the bar.
Natasha allowed herself time to enjoy every last quake of the climax before she returned her attention to Clint. "Now I want you to fuck me, and don't even think about cumming until I say that you can." She waited until Clint gave a nod of confirmation before spreading her legs wide and inviting him to crawl up between them. Often Nat preferred less traditional poses, but for the night she was satisfied to watch Clint's face as he fell apart. The sight of his eyes naked at the moment of release was something to see. "And don't you dare take those pants off." Nat's toes ran up over the leather.
Always one for dramatic timing, Steve chose that moment to step into the room. His step faltered at the grim looks on everyone's faces and the sound of his name. "Uh, told me what exactly?" Neither of the young SHIELD scientists would so much as look at him. They were stoically pretending to work on something at the back of the room. He was moderately certain the computer they were pretending to work on wasn't even turned on. "Okay, somebody's going to need to fill me in because I apparently missed something." He spotted the new schematic floating in the air and perked up a bit. "Is this a new design? Something to help us use the hammer?"
"Mm?" Clint blinked a little, then shook his head. "Well, the fact that I sleep in your office when you're not there aside." He rolled into his side, pressing himself against Phil and throwing an arm and a leg over the man. "I was talking," he yawned out, "about something way dirtier. But I don't know if I should tell you yet. Maybe I should tell you later. As a surprise. Around the third date."
Scott stuck close by Logan to keep the way clear. The man was breathing - barely - and that was about it. He tried not to let himself think about everything else that was going on around them. With their master gone, he noted that many Brotherhood members were retreating. "They're clearing out." They'd heard Steve, but he belatedly realized that Coulson's voice had been notably absent during the encounter, and was still silent. "Coulson, where are you? Barton?"
Bruce, meanwhile, nodded his agreement with Steve. "I can at least throw the flag if he starts overdoing it. But I might have to call you in to get him to settle down. I have to confess, I have absolutely no control over him," he said, remembering his attempts to convince Tony he needed sleep when they'd been working on Loki's staff. The man had been borderline delirious and still refused to even sit down for a few minutes. Hearing the loud scrape of metal on metal, he looked up to see Clint pushing the hammer away from himself. Seeing how shaken the archer looked, Bruce shook his head. "Yeah, I'm not touching that thing. I have a feeling it wouldn't mix well with my other half. I'd say use gloves, but I don't think it works that way." He didn't dare say it out loud, but he had a feeling that if anyone had to handle the artifact for scientific purposes, it'd have to be Tony. //Steve won't like that.//
"You don't deserve it." She let her thumb stroke over the back of Bruce's hand in a gentle, soothing gesture. "Or we all do. It's better that we remember that we did our best." Jemma knew that if the same situation presented itself again in the same way, they would all make the same calls, or ones close enough to them that nothing would change. They had done their best with what they had. "With any luck - and I believe we've earned a bit of that - it won't be a problem for much longer."
Clint nodded, gladly taking solace in the touch. "Thank you," he whispered, voice rough and shaky. He knew it was an odd sentiment, but he'd needed the reassurance on a level he couldn't quite grasp. He'd wanted it to be Phil. He'd wanted it to be the man he was pressed against in that moment to be the first one to have him like that in years. "It was supposed to be you."
Simmons recovered a few seconds after the door closed, and she ducked her head, blushing and smiling widely only to find Fitz frowning at her when she looked back up again. "What?" she challenged, eyes narrowed. "Pick your words very carefully, Leopold Fitz."
Simmons could see the wheels turning, and she cautioned firmly, "Focus. First the healing." Her voice dropped, and she murmured, "Then we'll see what else we have time for before he remembers we've got this." If they were successful, the whole thing could be wrapped up quickly and then, with even more luck, Steve would keep Tony distracted so that they could keep right on working on slightly less above board projects. More loudly, she said, "Thank you! This should be a great help."
Coulson watched Clint carefully for a moment before dropping his gaze back to the monitors. "I can handle this if you're not comfortable with it." Frankly he wasn't comfortable himself. It was a strange thing, an invasive thing, but one he knew was necessary from time to time. "I can call you in if you're needed to deal with any complications or I have the opportunity to address Mr. Summers by himself." Coulson certainly preferred to have Clint available at short notice in the event that the meeting happened. He didn't want to get jumped by an angry Wolverine halfway through. It was harder to have a civil conversation without a spleen.
Logan sighed his approval and rested his arm across the back of the bench, his hand gripping Scott's shoulder. He lightly teased his lover's full lips with his tongue, then pressed further. He was glad Scott was comfortable with a little PDA. It felt good to know others could see that Scott was his.
Though Coulson's shoulders were so tense he wasn't sure he couldn't have relaxed if he was paid to, he managed not to say any of the inappropriate things he was thinking. "Well, we're here. Dr. Simmons, I thought this might be a good time to check Agent Barton's vitals."
Logan managed to make a few of the guards hesitate just by showing them the claws, but they didn't pause for long, flinging themselves at him. Not particularly wanting to kill folks who were more than likely just misled, Logan retracted the claws and settled for pure fury and adamantium-laced punches, grinning more broadly than was at all healthy as he fought. He paused at the sound of an enraged roar, though, and he and his assailants turned their eyes toward the other side of the fracas as the Hulk loomed up and flung a few guards across the room. "And that's why you don't start with the little guy," he said, breaking the jaw of one of the distracted guards. Gentlemen's rules were for friendly barroom brawls.
Scott didn't really notice the staring at first, but finally he glanced up and caught Logan's gaze. He broke into a dopey grin. "Enjoying the show?" He hadn't really considered the idea that he was stripping in front of someone he'd made it pretty clear he wanted to sleep with. //I definitely made the night more awkward.// The gentlemanly thing to do would have been to return to the living room or get a suite of his own. Instead he climbed into the other side of Logan's bed and relaxed almost at once thanks to the soft surface and the comfortingly familiar scents surrounding him. "You gonna lay down or just, like, stay up and creeper stare at me all night?"
"We don't, you insubordinate jackass, but you two are drawing entirely too much attention to yourselves. The last thing I need is to have to run off the Enquirer and Star Magazine. Bad enough Vanity Faire and CNN are always-"
Clint couldn't help but smile a little at that. He burrowed a little closer to Phil - if that was even possible - and pressed his lips to the man's throat. "I think I'll be alright with that, considering I don't think I'll be okay with us getting separated, either." He shifted, looking up at Phil before leaning in to press his lips to the other man's. He stopped a second later, though, brow furrowing. "It... it's okay, right? I mean, I know that..." Creed had certainly upended the idea of intimacy for him for a good while, but the mutant hadn't kissed him. A small mercy. Clint felt comfortable doing that much right then, and he was hoping Phil would feel the same, but he realized that all things considered it might be a bit much. "If it's too much, just tell me."
"Phil's more private about that kind of thing," Natasha answered simply. "What happened with us was a one off. Normally he'd consider sleeping with an asset decidedly unprofessional." Given that he was currently off doing god only knew what with Clint, she knew it seemed counter-intuitive. "I'm hoping things with Clint will be a little different. They both deserve something different." She wasn't in mourning at the potential loss of one of her favorite bed mates. Whether the three of them came to an understanding or not, Natasha wanted Clint happy a lot more than she needed to get laid. "What about the two of you?"
"He's sure," Pepper broke in before Tony could answer. "He spends far too much time here alone. If you can get him out of that lab for even a few hours a day, it will be well worth it." Apparently satisfied, Pepper grabbed her briefcase from where she'd dropped it by the door and gave them a wave. "Have fun picking out a room!" she bid Steve before heading back out into the world.
Tony felt his pulse quicken at the thought. The kissing hadn't hurt, either. "No, but I want to," Tony said, his voice a little deeper than it had been a moment before. "Hopefully it's hot, sweaty, and takes up at least half my day." He was really beginning to loathe the stitches. "And remind me to 'thank' Logan's brother when I get better for interfering with my sexy funtime."
"It will, ma'am," Steve agreed solemnly. Expression still strained, Steve managed, "Everybody come back okay?"
Steve considered that, taking the beer gratefully when it arrived, and finally answered, "Let's just say there haven't been any opportunities that felt right." He'd been attracted to one or two people since his reappearance in the world, but Steve had never been good at quick and easy. On the rare occasions he gave in to such momentary impulses, he tended to feel more guilty than sated the day after. Turnabout was fair play, and Steve looked Logan over. "What about you? I think the waitress would be just as happy to take you home, but I haven't seen you slipping her your cell phone number. Safe to say you're unattached?"
"Until we understand it," Bruce agreed with a nod. "Maybe some sort of nanotechnology? Or even integrated genetic modification. But it seems like they actually have to have some preexisting latent ability with it." He brought up a tablet and pulled up everything SHIELD had to date on Asgardians. "It's hard to tell. Most of our instruments can't seem to comprehend their technology. Not really. Closest we got was Hydra's tesseract weaponry, and even they were just monkeys with cigarette lighters when it came down to it."
"Yeah, well, if you took the blindfold off, I could've been a lot worse than a chainsaw," Scott pointed out as he took the prompt and slid smoothly over to straddle Logan's lap. It was warm and comfortable and really pretty perfect. Given his headspace, Scott knew SHIELD hadn’t been wrong to be cautious. He could have killed someone. As much as he hadn't exactly wanted to hurt anybody, if he'd had a shot at getting to Logan and they'd given him an opening, it could've gotten ugly fast. "Besides, we were both a mess. We probably would've been more of a mess together." He kissed Logan soundly to remove any sting from the words. "I like this better. I like it being really us."
Not used to Tony being serious, it took Steve a second to process the words and the quiet sincerity behind them. He blinked and then found a smile that warmed him up from the inside out. “I’m grateful you’re here. I’m grateful we’re getting a chance.” He was even grateful that he still had Bucky, even if the man was hurt and broken and had a long way to go before he would recover even in part. Glancing around at the apartment, he shrugged. “It’s going to be interesting. It’s still new. We just got set up, and… well, it’s new.” Given Bucky’s tentative mental state, Steve had no idea what it would be like sharing a space - even if it wasn’t so much sharing a whole space as having a common area with their own separate bedrooms and bathrooms. “Haven’t roomed with anybody since Buck and I were kids. Of course, then it really was rooming together. No suites, no privacy.”
"Maybe." Bucky wasn't entirely convinced. He hated what he saw the mirror; a former shell of himself scarred and haunted by past deeds he could not remember. Bucky somehow doubted a haircut and a change of clothing would erase all that. Still, he appreciated Coulson's suggestion. He found himself glancing around the room, feeling as if the walls were closing in. "I don't know what is it about places like this," he confided, meaning hospitals in general. "It makes me feel... like something bad's about to happen." Bucky's stress level grew along with a seemingly never ending paranoia that everyone was plotting against him.
"I feel special. I'd feel more special if you came back with a burger and wearing nothing but a bow," Tony pointed out, tugging Steve close again. He stretched upward - tugging on stitches that reminded him how bad an idea that was - and nibbled at Steve's throat. He knew he was probably pushing his lover's tolerance for PDA and public appropriateness, but it was damn hard to keep his hands off the other man so long as Steve was within arm's reach.
It was hard not to feel his heart warm at the words. The truth was that the majority of reactions that Coulson expected were people wondering why a man fifteen years his junior and gorgeous as hell was actually dating him. He couldn't quite resist brushing his fingers against Clint's when he passed the Gatorade back. It was strange and new - odd, really - to have someone else see them as a couple. After everything they'd been through, it was really damn nice. "Thank you," Phil echoed earnestly. "We'll be out of your hair soon. We have a ride coming." His internal clock told him that they probably had a good fifteen minutes or so until air support arrived. Maria might have believed that there was no immediate danger, but she'd send an agent or two anyway. It was just the way she was. Not that Phil really minded. It was a day when someone being overprotective of them sounded kind of nice.
Logan, fairly thoroughly distracted by the kisses to the most perfect spot on his ear, almost didn't register the sentiment. "Like hearin' that," he decided, running his fingers through Scott's hair. He nipped lightly at his lover's shoulder, careful to keep the contact gentle as he trailed his fingers down Scott's stomach once more, lightly teasing at the waistband of his boxers.
"Yeah, figured," Scott answered, "but thank you. I appreciate the lack of bullshit." He felt oddly at ease with Clint. Scott suspected that was mostly due to the fact that with the exception of Logan, Clint was the first person he'd been entirely honest with since Loki came to him. "Do you mind if I ask you a very personal and completely inappropriate question?"
"Okay? That just happens to be my favorite." Tony paused as he stepped inside, glancing toward the ceiling. "Jarvis, you haven't been divulging all my secret to Captain Rogers, have you?"
Subdued, Clint shoved himself up, leaning against the cell wall and trying to let the cool surface calm him. He was pretty sure he'd just narrowly avoided a concussion. Seeing Victor pressing Phil against a wall, though, made it hard for him to just sit there. He worried with the cuffs on his wrists, but they were something bizarre and obviously not of earthly origin, as he couldn't even find a hinge or seam in them anywhere.
Logan raised an eyebrow but didn't argue. He was pretty sure, in fact, that he would have rather Scott not get in the line of fire again anytime soon. The man had been through enough, and Logan couldn't help but feel protective of him for that fact. He was quiet for a moment, holding Scott close and relishing the contact. "You do what you gotta do, darlin'. I think you're the one who knows best what you've got to take care of."
Bruce smiled. It was nice having someone around that didn't treat him like a live grenade they'd lost the pin to. "Considering I broke Manhattan all by myself, I feel safe in saying that two of the other guy might pose a significant liability," he said, prodding at the formula. Simulating the next try indicated it would create a deadly chain reaction in Steve's immune system. He sighed. "This is so much harder than it should be," he muttered to himself in frustration.
Darien stroked himself slowly along with Clint's desperate moans. He'd never actually jerked off live to one of his lovers fucking someone else. It was hotter than he would've expected.
Clint nodded his agreement. He didn't point out that Phil would need a run through medical, too. They both would. For some serious antibiotics, of nothing else. Deciding it didn't matter, he leaned lightly against his handler and smiled faintly. "And I'm gonna be curled up next to you, wherever you sleep," he decided, starting to feel the fatigue as it sank on that they were safe. He glanced at the store clerk, remembering she was there. "Thanks again, uhhh..."
"That's not entirely accurate, sir... but I'll be happy to ask." He pulled out his cell. They didn't have a lot of time to lose. As he waited for Stark to answer, Phil found himself hoping the man was on some pretty good drugs.
Clint followed Nat quickly into release, his cry of pleasure mingling with hers. Gasping for air, he sagged to the side, flopping bonelessly into the mattress. Still gasping, his eyes drifted to where Darien sat and he smirked faintly before closing his eyes. He needed to get out of the sweat soaked leathers, but at the moment standing sounded like WAY too much effort. "Fuck, I needed that," he panted, feeling sleep tugging at him already. He tensed bodily at the tone of the comms system, though.
"Forget? No." Logan seemed to consider for a moment, then offered, "I'd be willin' to keep it to myself in exchange for beer, though."
"Bruce is just being dramatic," Tony scoffed. "I'll be fine. I've got a backup loaded in the plane if this happens to not work. But it will. The nanomachines orient on the bracelets, attach to the arc reactor, and organize themselves into a suit. No worries." When Bruce continued to give him the "disappointed dad" look, Tony rolled his eyes. "C'mon, man, it's not like everyone who experimentally injects things into themselves has weird things happen to them."
Bruce glanced up and smiled faintly. Fitz-Simmons were actually really good. He also knew Stark cared nothing for grades and degrees and everything about results. "I'll just have a mocha. Just however they normally make it is fine." He made sure Tony wasn't looking before he mouthed, "No Irish," on the off chance that Simmons thought it'd be a good idea to actually do what Tony said.
"I'm feeling pretty good, actually," Clint remarked with a smirk. The archer had stopped moving forward, but he kept his eyes on Loki, swinging the hammer idly.
His dreams were a mixture of the usual violence, nightmares of Scott being abducted, and far more intimate scenarios involving the other man. In the last dream, a hooded figure in green threatened and mocked him while Scott was tortured, and Logan jerked awake. He was pressed tightly to Scott, his arm curled around the man as if expecting him to be snatched away. Logan's eyes darted around the room as he fought to separate dream from reality and calm himself back down.
Thor nodded his agreement. "That would be well, Lady Widow," he said, settling tiredly back into his throne as the guards warily returned to their posts. "I am afraid that, owing to my brother, I have not been myself."
Tony managed to pout drunkenly as he put the bottle away. "Hey, I'm not the one who appointed me the guy who gets drunk for the three of us. I definitely remember that *not* being me."
"It's perfect," Phil answered, cupping Clint's face and returning the kiss, gentle and undemanding, something sweet and pleasant to remind them both that there was more out there than what Creed was capable of. "I'm not going to let him take this way from us." They had just found one another on a romantic level. It had been huge for Phil to allow himself the luxury of connection. Until he'd started talking to Clint, he hadn't realized how long it had been, how many years since he let someone in that close. "Kissing you, holding you, being close to you? That's not something I'm going to give up."
Well into the night, Bruce finally nudged Tony with a stylus. "Hey. It's after ten. Go get some rest," he said.
"We all need some sort of entertainment, Stark," Loki hissed in reply. The comment had cut in a troubling fashion, and he didn't want to let the man get under his skin. It was supposed to be the other way around. He breathed deeply to calm the tremble within at the idea of how lonely he really was. "The deal is made." It took little effort even in his weakened state to reach out to Creed. //Let them live. Do what you will with them otherwise, but they live.// Loki was certain that Creed would obey. The man was impulsive and at times foolish, but he was a good soldier in his way. Magneto hadn't been wrong about that. "You still think that someone's going to rescue you, don't you, Stark? Do you really think that they would risk their lives for your body?"
Tony grinned. "Wonderful." He made sure that the waiter got them paid out and tipped a ridiculous amount and an autograph - "Thanks for not being a pain.-Tony Stark" - and lead Steve casually to the valet stand outside. Once in the car, Tony took a few casual turns that were definitely not aimed at getting them home before pulling into a mostly-empty parking garage. He threw the car into park and placed his hand on the back of Steve's seat, giving him a smoldering look and a faint grin. "Y'know, I'm not sure I'm ready to go back to the Tower and risk Coulson interrupting my fun," he said, trailing off and leaning towards Steve invitingly.
The second blow from Steve was enough to dislodge Victor Creed from his perch on top of Tony, and the man immediately turned his attention on the Captain, swinging a handful of adamantium at the soldier. He got a bit of a shock, though, when the claws struck Steve's battle-scarred shield. His surprise didn't slow him down more than a split second. In fact, the surprise served to fuel his rage, and Victor latched his hand over the edge of Steve's shield and used the leverage to vault over the barrier and take a swipe at the blonde Avenger.
"There. Maybe Bobby and Hank and some o' the others could keep watch here if they're not all about headin' off the planet."
Logan could hear the discussion over the rest of the bar, and he raised an eyebrow, wondering now if it was just par for the course for the Avengers to have random threesomes. He glanced at Scott. "Guess we snuck out with the wild bunch," he observed with a smirk.
"I'll be fine, Tony. I promise. I'm not leaving you." Steve kissed the man gently. "I love you... and you're going to teach me how to do this so I can help our friends, okay?"
Logan held Scott tight, glad that the man hadn't asked any awkward questions. It meant he didn't have to choose between lying and telling Scott something that would just leave him feeling guilty and probably angry at Logan, to boot. "Sorry I didn't mention it sooner. Just... I wasn't sure Loki was tellin' the truth about the whole thing, and I didn't wanna get your hopes up." He smiled a little. "We should try it out, though. Go for a picnic or somethin'."
Natasha nodded her agreement and offered the faintest of smiles. "Nice shirt." It wasn't the time for levity, but it wasn't the time to close all the shades and lose hope either.
"He's useful, though," Natasha allowed, "and smarter than he seems. Not in a personal sense. On a personal level, he's actually worse with other human beings than I am. I didn't know there were people like that." She knew how to work people over, how to manipulate them, but Tony Stark was one of the few people she knew who were as consistently awful with relating to others as she was herself. "Thank god for Steve or he might not be able to introduce himself without getting slapped half the time."
Below, Scott held his ground, sticking close to Logan. He knew his primary mission was to keep Logan alive long enough to do what needed to be done. He visually cataloged the mutants present. Sabretooth would be their biggest threat on that count. Mystique he could keep back, but even his abilities would only keep Creed from closing in for so long.
Though he still wasn't sure he understood the extent of what was happening, Coulson knew that Steve having his doctors at his side was the best thing and nodded before sitting down next to Stark again. He glanced at the other man. If Coulson felt uneasy at the news, he couldn't even imagine what Tony might be feeling.
Logan opened his mouth as if to answer, then subsided. He glanced at Scott. He knew there was something more than what he was being told. Barton's presence made that much obvious. "You oughta know that archer buddy wouldn't have any better chance o' stoppin' me than you would," he growled, then moved toward the door. He gave Scott a quick glance. "I'll get back to you on dinner. Not feelin' real hungry right now."
Knowing that she didn't make empty threats, Fitz sighed heavily and trudged over to the cot in the corner, curling up on it and muttering under his breath about the suitability of dating genetic experiments.
Logan glanced at Steve. The tall blonde seemed unlikely to leave Tony, and Tony seemed unlikely to leave the bar anytime soon. Reluctantly, Logan climbed on a barstool a space down from Tony and told Danny to get him a beer, figuring he'd be marginally less likely to perforate Stark if Steve was sitting between them.
Steve tried to blink away the tears and only succeeded in sending them falling down his cheeks. Relief was the silliest possible thing to feel in a moment like that, but he felt it just the same and more or less fell against Tony, sobbing without reservation. He'd been terrified that somehow in the space of a few days, he'd managed to lose the man despite him being alive. There was no chance of speaking. He couldn't. The pent up emotions were too much, the relief was too much, the hurt was too much, and Steve wanted nothing more than to cling to Tony until he could remember how to breathe again.
Steve smiled back, the corner of his lips quirking upward. “You might feel a little differently if you’d met me back then, but… thank you. I can’t say I ever did anything like graduating college before most people hit high school, though. You aren’t the only one who’s done some file reading. All that stuff I said when we met? I was wrong. Really, really wrong.”
The sound of the door interrupted any potential answers, and Pepper swept into the room with coffee and a bag that smelled of freshly-baked pastries. "JARVIS told me you boys had a sleepover," she informed them with a smile. "I thought you might need a little pick-me-up if you had a long night." She smiled at both men, pressing a kiss to Tony's cheek and greeting, "Good morning, Steve," before setting the items down on the table in front of them. "I'd stay and keep you company, but I'm afraid that somebody has to actually show up to Stark Industries meetings."
"If you ain't helpin', we're gonna figure out a way to do it," Logan returned, folding his arms across his chest. "I've already died a few times tryin', and one of us died for good."
Logan stared at the other man longer than might have been entirely smart before looking up at J. "Ten thousand."
Tony's brow furrowed earnestly. "Considering your history, I can see where looking at him would kind of make you a little angry, so I don't think anyone would blame you. Well, I wouldn't, since I'm the only one who knows. And I'm sure the rest of them can chalk it up to sibling rivalry." He was starting to feel sorry for Loki on a pretty deep level, and that worried Tony. //Seems a little early for Stockholm syndrome.//
For his part, Logan untwisted his fingers from Scott's only to pull the man against him and rest Scott's head on his chest. "You let me know if we need to go home early," he said, tone firm but gentle.
Clint's phone had gone off a moment after Phil's - a sure sign it was work-related - and he looked up from his attempts to retrieve his own copy of the message. "Well... I guess that's not the worst news we've had lately," he decided, relaxing back into his lover. He still held a bit of tension in his spine, though, as he leaned against Phil. "Dammit, can't someone else save the world for once?" he groused, trying to focus on anything else and failing miserably. "I vote we build a blanket fort and refuse to come out until this blows over."
Loki felt his stomach twist as he gazed on the scene. It was so easy to see the threads of it all, to see who was attached to who and how. The curly-haired boy was in love with the girl, the girl wanted Bruce, and that seemed to be mutual. Stark was in love with Rogers, and Rogers was looking at the man like he'd hung the moon. Loki found himself staring at the floor just to keep from throwing up on the perfectly kept laboratory. "I'll continue standing here and making everyone feel awkward, shall I?"
"No, I don't have to," Clint replied, lifting his eyes to meet Coulson's gaze, "but I want to, and I'm going to keep right on watching your back." No argument from Phil would dissuade him. As far as Clint was concerned, Bucky Barnes was a constant danger to Coulson and everyone within the building. Unstable and a match for Cap were a recipe for disaster. Why Phil felt the need to take responsibility for the Winter Soldier baffled Clint. He could only surmise it was out of some misguided loyalty to Steve. A small shake of his head, and Clint reached for a flask he always carried. "Here, I'll bet you could use a little of this, too." He poured some of the contents into his mug, followed by Phil's.
Clint snorted softly. "Yeah, I think he needed therapy when he got here. Speaking of which, shouldn't we be checking that video feed? Or just checking on Logan himself? I feel a little nervous not knowing what he's doing or where he is. Like he's going to show up and stab me. Pretty sure we're not friends," he said, though he didn't really seem concerned. "Also, how the hell are we supposed to cure him? Somehow, I think hitting him in the head with a scaffold railing won't work."
Phil's eyes closed at the words. He knew exactly what Clint was thinking. He'd thought about it himself. Stupid as it was considering Clint's capabilities and the fact that someone just as competent would have replaced him, the thought of Clint and Natasha going out in the field and never being there to back them up still woke him up at night. He supposed he just wanted to feel needed and useful, but it was also the idea that anything could happen. Anything could happen to Clint, specifically, and he needed... he just needed to be there. Quietly, Phil confessed, "When we get home, it might be awhile before I can be more than a few feet away from you and feel comfortable."
Natasha stuck with her usual - vodka on the rocks. She didn't see the point in disguising alcohol as something fruity and sweet when it wasn't. It was some variation of beer all down the line otherwise. "I'm not sure if you're pacing yourselves or if I'm the only one who's got any balls."
Logan started walking, giving a faint shrug at the question. "Good guy, if a little weird 'n' nerdy. It’s disturbin' how much he seems to know about what goes on around here." He moved into the kitchen, pleased to see they were alone for the moment. He made a beeline for the coffee maker and started a pot before digging out some eggs and bacon. "Ain't much of a cook, but I haven't screwed up the eggs 'n' bacon thing yet. Unless you want a fruit salad or somethin'. Then you're on your own." It was more along the lines of their more traditional ribbing, but Logan didn't feel the animosity behind his words that used to be a given.
"No, Jarvis, it's fine." Talking to the computer was odd, but it made him feel closer to Tony. He liked that a lot. "What did you want to show me?" He felt his throat closing up at the sight of the clutter. There were half-full coffee cups, some with various colors of mold clinging to their insides. More electronics than he could identify littered every surface. He saw no fewer than a dozen completely ridiculous-looking things that might well have been robots, and a toaster that looked like it was being modified to some state that made Steve frankly uneasy. It looked as if Tony could walk in any second with a snarky remark and a smile. "Jarvis?"
Anyone who has watched Sci-Fi's Invisible Man series back in the day will recognize that I shamelessly stole Darien Fawkes from them. I don't regret it, but I'm not tagging Invisible Man since this is a wholesale bastardized version, plus he comes and goes and isn't a steady char here.
Tony wanted to be angry. He wanted to yell at the god, beat him until he dropped the charade. Instead, Tony couldn't help but feel broken, pained. Even if Bruce and Simmons managed to find a way to restore Steve to his proper self, Tony knew he wouldn't live to see it. And if they didn't, Steve was suffering twice over thinking Tony was dead. He shivered, biting back tears and halfway tempted to try and take some sort of comfort in the illusion Loki was offering. "S... stop... Please..."
"He's an amazing friend," Steve countered. He was grateful to the man for his kindness and for being there for Tony when he couldn't be. "But I can do industrial strength coffee." He found himself watching Tony intently and searching for any signs of tension or uncertainty. "Think there's a chance they'll let me get away with hiding up here with you for a day or two? Facing everybody right now... I just... I'm still progressing. I'm not sure how to tell the team they're in the market for a new leader yet."
"It's a worst case scenario," Steve agreed quietly. Try as he might to be casual about everything, Steve doubted even Tony relished that particular thought. "You know the other options aren't good when somebody trying to take over the world sounds like a good way to go." He met Logan's gaze firmly. "It's important you know what's going on. If this is too much, I don't think anyone's going to blame you for leaving, but I really do hope you're willing to stay."
“No need to be sorry. I don’t think many of us would be in better shape after going through what you’ve been through. Actually, I’d wager that we might be a lot worse off.” No matter how much blame everyone else was levying against Bucky, it was clear he had pulled plenty of guilt onto his own shoulders. “The truth is, Captain Rogers asked me directly if I’d keep an eye on you. Even if he hadn’t, I would have volunteered before it came to drawing straws. For one thing, I think it’s unfair to blame you for something that was done to you. For another, well… I assume that Captain Rogers has been too kind to mention it, but I was a bit of a fan growing up. Not just of him, but of the Howling Commandos. I’ve known who you were since I was a kid.”
Clint raised an eyebrow. "You? Really?" He was pretty surprised. Granted, he wasn't exactly aware of all the details of Steve's history besides the "wimp gets serum, kicks ass, gets frozen, thawed out 70 years later," overview the Director had given all of them. "Well, it looks like you're dating and then some now. Or something. I dunno. I'd say wait it out for awhile. I mean, it sounds like you can at least connect with the new guy." He paused. "But... really? You and Stark? I always kinda figured you'd be more interested in force-feeding him a fist sandwich..."
"Jesus, I thought we were done talking dirty to each other," Clint breathed, then grinned at the other man. "But you're right; I definitely won't leave after that. Really, though, you already ruined that likelihood when you fed me the first time. Once I know where to get things that aren't field rations or frozen dinners, I tend to keep coming back." It was baloney, of course. Clint might not have always had time to do so, but he had the money to go to the cafeteria or around the block to get something better. The comfort of watching Phil cook for him and the security of sleeping on the man's couch had been more than enough to have him hunting excuses to come back for more. //Guess now I have a free pass. And I don't have to take the couch anymore.//
In which Loki enjoys one of his strange bedfellows, and Natasha is a little too strong-willed for her own good.
Steve smirked. "Luckily for you, I like both kinds." Mostly he found that he just liked spending time with Tony. "I really am gonna take you out, though. Proper date night. Just as soon as the world's not ending. Maybe we can even take a few days off, go to the beach or something..." The idea of Tony all to himself, just the two of them off in some tropical locale, was fantastic. "Every now and then, I'd like the chance to not share you with anything or anybody."
Natasha met May's gaze briefly. "I'll go. Agent May should stay here in case word comes in about Barton or Coulson." They were still keeping an eye out on the channels, but she knew that it was a long shot in a lot of ways. If Loki had them, they wouldn't be seeing them anytime soon. If ever. At least she knew May cared almost as much as she did about seeing it resolved positively and seeing Loki gutted. She explained to Sif, "Loki has two of ours." Her eyes narrowed. "He killed another."
"That is a very reasonable request," Natasha agreed, though she also pushed the water closer to Scott, "as long as you have some of that too. I won't be there to enjoy it, but morning after puking isn't sexy."
Out in the hallway, Clint took a step back as the door opened, giving him enough room to fire if he needed to. He nimbly dodged when Logan tried to shove him. "Don't push it, hairball." In spite of himself, Clint flinched slightly at the metal rasp of Logan's claws being bared. He knew he ultimately didn't stand a chance against the feral mutant. Not at this range.
"I'm very glad to hear it. Though I think I would've hated to see you insane if this is you all put together," Phil deadpanned only to break into another grin at the warmth of Clint's leg resting against his own. It surprised him to find that such small gestures, thrilling as they were, happened to be easy and comfortable instead of terrifying and awkward. "Now I just need to get promoted so I'm legally allowed to keep secrets from you again. It could come in handy if we're together a long time."
Natasha rolled her eyes. "I'll get it." She padded over and grabbed the remotes, surfing through the menus as if she did it every day. Once the opening crawl for Spaceballs started, she tucked herself in at Clint's side again. "Just remember, if you cop a feel, we'll both hurt you." It wasn't a serious threat, of course, but Natasha knew that it was important to be clear. She wasn't there to get in the way of what they had. She just needed the comfort of being close too.
"Yep," Tony replied, staggering a little in the armor as he tried to track his opponent. The blue skinned woman had more or less completely slipped his mind as he tried to figure out the best way to extract Steve from the beast that was trying to kill him.
“Hey, I don’t mind,” Bucky was quick to reassure him. “You’re a good leader. Always have been.” His features darkened, and another bout of melancholy settled over him like a storm cloud. “Only wish I could’ve been around to help you.” Bucky had learned all about the Battle of New York while he’d been recovering. It was staggering to think of what had happened, and that his best friend had been front and center during the entire fight. “Maybe if I ever get my head sorted out I could join you again?” he offered hopefully. “Y’know, be like old times?”
Xavier nodded, looking grim. Skimming a few of Clint's thoughts from the surface of the man's consciousness, he couldn't help but feel even more worried. The things Loki had done to Clint were troubling at best. "Erik wouldn't likely jump on board with this 'Loki' of yours unless he thought he could use him."
The Hulk gave Loki a cocky smirk, reaching for him until a blur of motion distracted him, a punch landing just under his eye, then his stomach, then the back of his head in quick succession. A tall, lean figure with a smarmy grin and silver hair seemed to materialize in front of him, and he growled irritably. "Puny mutant." He swiped for the man, but the mutant disappeared and then reappeared just inches from his reach.
While Fitz looked utterly uncomfortable thinking about Stark and Rogers together, but Simmons' expression softened. She could imagine all too well after seeing the aftermath of the whole thing. "Sir? We've got all the figures we need, and we'll all need to get a bit of rest tonight. If you wanted to check in on Captain Rogers... We all worry, Sir, is all," she explained, trying to make it sound as if they needed the information as much as Tony. "A bit of dinner, some rest, then we're all back in the game come the wee hours of the morning."
"Thank you," Steve answered earnestly. He felt better knowing there was someone amongst his companions that he could talk to about the whole thing without being judged. "I guess we sort of went on a date," he finally ventured. "There was dinner with Logan, then dancing with Tony, so... altogether it was sort of a date." He couldn't help but shake his head and chuckle. "I guess I'm a few decades past worrying about what my parents would think, so I'm probably in the clear."
By the time a nurse came in to show him to Tony's room, Steve felt sick to his stomach. He'd ignored every call from Fury and only answered texts from Pepper. Still Steve forced a wan smile when he saw Tony stretched out on the bed. "Hey... how are you feeling?"
"It is," Bruce agreed, daring to take advantage of the proximity and slip an arm around Jemma's waist. Maybe it was moving too fast. Probably not by regular person standards, of course. By their standards, maybe. But things in SHIELD had a way of going south on a regular basis, and he'd be damned if he didn't take a few liberties in case he didn't get to have that second date for a long time... or ever. "I'd be interested to see how things work out in the field. Good news is, looks like the suit will help Jarvis keep an eye on him even while he's away."
"Of course not, sir," Jarvis' clipped tone answered, "only those you've deemed suitable for me to share."
"The hammer is of Asgard. It does not matter who holds it in your ridiculous realm," Loki spat, letting go of Tony's hair. The man was in poor shape. Indeed he was barely alive. "The weapon... it killed your friend, not that he will remain so. It should certainly have killed you, shiny suit of metal or no." He paced slowly on the floor in front of Stark. Fear rolled off of Stark in waves, and he was physically in no shape to protect himself. He had only his wit and his silly jabs. It was pathetic. "I think that what you can do for me is submit. You're of no help to your Captain now, but you can be of help to the Hawk and Agent Coulson. I've given them to one of my companions as a treat. If you play nicely, perhaps I'll see that he leaves them breathing... not that they'll want to be once he's done."
Tony felt Steve losing a little of his careful control, felt the kiss turning almost bruising. He didn't care. He needed everything Steve had to offer. In truth, a fair part of the parade of women he'd had around lately had been to try and distract himself from what he really wanted. He couldn’t shake the worry about things going the way they had with Pepper. Impulsiveness had, as usual, won the day with Tony. It was too late to hold back. Drawing back to speak-and because he was pretty sure he'd lost circulation to his lips-he panted, "Touch me. Don't make me beg." Another pant. "Please."
"Upside is now you've got as much of it as you want. No waiting, no interruptions... well, until Fury decides he wants us. I'm guessing he'll wait until Steve's vertical." Thinking about what Steve was going through made him hold on a little tighter. He could so easily have been in the same place that it was terrifying. "Scared me. I know you recovered last time, but I kept thinking about... if you didn't." Scott's breath caught at the idea, and he breathed carefully through the pain. Before the mission, Scott honestly hadn't let himself consider the idea of Logan not coming home. After, watching everyone grieve, he'd been confronted rather brutally with the idea.
Steve considered sitting in the control room and waiting to hear from the team. He honestly did. For a full five minutes, he stood in the hallway outside. His feet started down the hall before he realized he'd made a decision not to go inside. The last time he'd been sitting in one of those chairs with a pickup in his ear, his whole world had come crashing down. It wasn't a feeling Steve was eager to repeat.
At the sound of Tony's voice, Steve roused himself from a light nap. He rose from the bed with a smile and made his way into the living room with a smile on his face. "Hey, stranger. Sorry, kinda drifted off for awhile." He'd forgotten how intensely exhausting it was having a body that couldn't handle doing everything he really wanted to do. Catching the worry on Tony's face, Steve gave a shake of his head and moved in closer. "I'm fine. Just tired. Less tired now that I got some sleep. How about you? Need something to eat? I slept instead of eating dinner, so I could make us something."
"That may be how rumors get started, but denying them is how they spread," Natasha answered smoothly as they took a seat at the first open table they found. She ate quietly to better hear the buzz around them. Everything was pretty standard, and she let herself relax. At least the medical staff was being as discreet as they were supposed to be for now. By the end of the day - likely the end of their closed-door meeting - the rest of the Tower would probably know. "Looks like we may not have to kill anyone just yet. Or injure them. Oh, well. At least it means we won't be late to the meeting."
Tony flicked a look at Clint that told the archer that he was well aware of what he was doing, then scowled at Nat. "Look, this isn't just about you. There are three of you who need to be fixed or spend the rest of your lives in these cells. Or just be put down. Either way, the reason we're all here is because the team's decided that that's worse than... than..." Tony clenched his jaw and swallowed hard, trying his best to keep it together. "Just shut up and take it."
Tony blinked, furrowing his brow. "I'm sorry? That last bit kind of sounded like English, but I didn't understand a word of it." He shrugged, thoughtfully chewing his food for a moment. "Maybe I should read up on my forties vernacular. But I'd definitely put off that research for extra dessert at home," he decided, looking dead serious. Catching the waiter's eye, he gestured the man over. "Something rich and decadent for dessert." He flicked a glance at Steve as he added, "Maybe... drizzled with chocolate."
