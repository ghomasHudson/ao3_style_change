“He must have been so scared,” Sherlock said, dissolving into tears once more.  “He was all alone.”
“I want you to wait right here, kiddo,” Greg said after helping Bunny wash his hands.  “Papa’s going to get some things from the car, okay?”
“Do you have to go potty now, ladybug?” Papa asked.
“I couldn’t hold it,” John said between laughs.
Mycroft shrugged and guided Sherlock’s hand away from his mouth when he tried to suck his thumb again.
Mycroft was done with Sherlock’s antics.
Mycroft had made a mistake in neglecting Sherlock, and Greg had made a poor judgment in bringing John to the crime scene.  But at least this time they hadn't needed to traipse around back alleyways of London and dingy pubs looking for the drug-addict detective and his volatile best friend; the kids had stayed put, had even asked for help in their own ways.  There would be future struggles, but, at least for the moment, Mycroft and Greg had John and Sherlock clearly in their sights, and, little by little, they were making progress.
Sherlock sighed, understanding why Mycroft had brought up a story Sherlock had only vaguely remembered.
Sherlock was glad he was not punished, was once more reminded that Mycroft always knew exactly what Sherlock needed in the moment.  If Mycroft had suggested that Sherlock slip lower, maybe he should trust his older brother’s instinct.
John nodded, and was unable to keep a bit of frustration from his voice when he next spoke.  “I gave him the new one,” John said, slicing tomatoes for sandwiches.  “Exactly the same.  But he said it didn’t feel right.  Then he threw it across the room, which is why he’s in time out.”
“Tell me what you’d like to buy at the store,” Papa said in his most encouraging voice as he handed Bunny a dishtowel and plunged his hands into the soapy water in the sink.
Usually, Sherlock barely knew what day of the week it was, nevermind their plans for the following week.  It figured Sherlock would want to launch into a conversation about future plans just as John was beginning to find the correct direction for the blog post.
He had knotted the drawstring tight around his waist to keep the pull-up out of sight, but now it was giving him trouble and was far too tight to yank down over his hips.  It didn’t help that his vision was getting blurry as his eyes filled with frustrated tears.  He felt himself leak into the pull-up and gasped, yanking on the ends of the drawstrings in a desperate attempt to get the knot to budge.
At the moment, as they pulled up to Mycroft's flat and Papa began to come around the car to pull open his door, kiss his forehead, and wipe his tears, nothing else mattered.
He wanted Mycroft.  Why hadn’t Mycroft come instead?  He knew it was irrational, knew Mycroft had an international responsibility much more important than John at the moment, but he was in an irrational mood, and being back home at Baker Street made him long for quiet and comfort, and he didn’t care what was rational.  The pressures of the case seemed all the more draining now that he was finally back in his flat.
He stayed until John had fallen asleep, telling him what he could remember of
John swallowed and did not speak for some time.
“I’m not playing in the stupid outside,” Sherlock said, defiant.
It was a tight squeeze to fit both boys in the tub, and often Sherlock kicked out at John when he felt he was crowding his space, but history had proven it was impossible to keep Sherlock entertained and happy while Mycroft bathed John alone, so the only solution was to bathe them together.  Baths when Sherlock and John were little were more about calming and comforting than they were about cleanliness, so it had never been a problem that they were not always exactly effective.
“Don’t get up,” Sherlock breathed.
Greg noticed a grimace and a shifting of the kid’s hips.  It wasn’t surprising; they’d been working non-stop since just after breakfast.  Even Greg had started to feel a slight need, morning coffee making itself known.
Sherlock nodded, swirling a hand in the pile to mix the two puzzles and then setting to work separating the combined pieces by color, atomic number, or station name: periodic table to one side, tube stations to the other.  He was attempting to occupy his mind, and John wanted nothing more than to help him along.
Sherlock grunted.  He’d begged to go despite his parents initial reservations, at that point still desperate to fit in with the other boys in his class, still believing he could be like them if he tried hard enough.  His Father and Mother had eventually come to the conclusion that it would be good for him to socialize with children his own age, and were pleased that he had received an invite, which he never had before.  Sherlock had been too embarrassed to tell them that every boy in the class had been invited, too afraid they would rescind their consent and make him stay home.
But Bunny paused, and suddenly looked uncertain.
“What do you mean, kiddo?”
“Oh, my little Bunny,” Mycroft whispered into John’s hair, cheek resting against John’s head.  “If it’s all too much that’s okay.  There’s a spare cot in the closet we can make up and put in Sherlock’s room, just in case.   But Uncle Greg and I think this would be a good idea, just to try.”
“Bunny, do you want to use your pull-ups?”
“Even so, it’s my job to look out for you and to understand what’s best for you.  This morning, I didn’t follow through on that job.”
“I know you’re a big kid,” Mycroft said, following John’s gaze.  “But I think it might be a good idea to wear a pull-up for naptime, just in case.  How does that sound?”
You've all left such wonderful comments--they're so encouraging to me.  Thank you!  I'm about to go to sleep, so I don't have time to respond to them all right now, but I promise I will start to respond as soon as I can tomorrow!  For now, please know that you're all so appreciated.
John sat up and breathed to come back to himself, rubbing a hand along the back of his neck.
However, he could see defiance just behind the boy’s eyes; Sherlock was clearly waiting for any excuse to kick and scream.  Mycroft needed to tread carefully if he wanted to get the boy changed and back into bed without incident.
“Something not so good has happened,” he said, adjusting his tone.  “And I have to go in.”
If John were honest with himself, he knew as soon as he stepped behind Greg into the abandoned warehouse that he had no business being at a crime scene in his current state of mind.  Yes, he was adult at the moment.  But he could feel the fuzziness around the edges of his consciousness, the vulnerability that had settled over him last night and was persisting in sticking around despite his attempts to shake it off.
He did not know whether Sherlock remembered Victor Trevor or still conceptualized Redbeard as a dog, but he was hoping he could perpetuate the myth of the pet a bit longer with his insistence, whichever the case.  There was a bit of doubt in Sherlock’s expression when Mycroft turned his attention away from John, but the man did not refute Mycroft’s statement.
Uncle Greg and John’s Daddy shared another look when they both found themselves in the bathroom once more.
“All we’re saying is whoever killed him probably did the poor guy a favor,” Anderson said with a pointed smirk to John as he stepped back into the bathroom, proud of himself for the irony.
He let his thoughts go fuzzy as he forced himself to focus solely on the pain, on the humiliation, and on the release of tension.  But when Mycroft’s hits began to decrease in power, Sherlock whined in the back of his throat and shook his head, which was pressed into the crook of his brother’s elbow.
Mycroft paused to take a breath, knowing any further shows of exasperation would simply lead to a full-on strop from Sherlock.  It wasn't exactly fair of him to chastise the boy, but he was tired, and he knew very well the boy had made the conscious decision to stay where he was and wet himself rather than get up to use the loo.  He made his way to John’s closet, where he rooted around in the man's ageplay items until, thankfully, he found a spare pull-up.
"Bunny, you know you can talk with me or your Daddy about anything that's on your mind, right?" Greg asked, not feeling entirely comfortable having left the subject unfinished and still wondering whether what he thought he had heard was what Bunny had actually said.
“I could have done that for you,” Sherlock said, breathing heavily after they’d collapsed back onto the bed.
Sherlock shrugged, averting his eyes and mumbling about losing track of time, about not knowing he had to go and Mycroft not reminding him and then not realizing he needed changing.  He sensed he was only adding to the list of things that were disappointing Papa, and he felt like crying again.
“Finally!” Sherlock said as he scrambled into the kitchen, all sign of his previous tears disappeared.
Of course the man hadn’t been able to leave him alone, of course he had pushed himself in to take his old seat at the table he and John discussed ageplay matters, never mind that John had not requested his presence.  When had Mycroft ever been cognizant of correct timing?
Generally, their chats occurred in the middle of the night, in the space for John which existed between little and big.  John had been exhausted, however, and Mycroft knew he would sleep a full night.  It was why he had slept himself on the sofa in John and Sherlock’s flat before waking with the sun and preparing both tea and orange juice.  He hadn’t had to wait long.  The sun was not fully risen by the time John stumbled into the kitchen, hair mussed and face lined from sleep.
“What about it scares you?” Greg asked, squeezing the boy’s knee again to encourage him.
Bunny shook his head.
But Sherlock was too far gone to obey.  He slammed his feet against the back of the driver’s seat and hit his fists against the car door and the seat beside him, then kicked over the bag of kid’s toys Mycroft had left on the floor between Sherlock and John’s seats.
“Yes and no.  Sherlock regressed as a way to deal with the high levels of stress he had been feeling.  Because he was in the midst of withdrawal, he was needier than usual, and he became more childlike, yes.  But this younger side of Sherlock is certainly nothing new, and wasn’t at the time either.  I allowed us to simply fall back into the routines we had when we were much younger.  I’d read of regression therapy and the benefits of ageplay in the past, and encouraged it with Sherlock.  He needed to feel taken care of for a time.  He needed a break from the stress of taking care of himself, something he quite frankly has never been very good at.”
“They’ll likely leak,” Mycroft said softly once lunch had been eaten and Sherlock had been put down for his nap, “But with an extra insert they just might do the trick.  In any case they’ll give him enough to experiment with to keep him in headspace for more time than he might otherwise be likely to, while also cutting down on laundry.”
“Oh, alright,” he said with a smile. “But not for too long.  I don't want you closed in with all the dust and debris up in that attic all afternoon.”
“I’ve taken the rest of the night off,” Mycroft said as Sherlock typed incessantly.
(new ficlet "Brother Knows Best" was uploaded recently).
Sherlock nodded, but did not move from his place.  It seemed clear the boy was fighting between wanting independence and wanting to keep Mycroft and Bunny company, to watch the interactions between them without fully inserting himself into the roleplay.  Mycroft turned back to Bunny.  Extra attention would only send Sherlock away.
“How’s about this?” Greg said, and he was holding one of John’s pacifiers close to his mouth.
“Goodnight, Mycroft,” Sherlock said as he rolled his eyes at his brothers pedantics.  “Wake me when Christmas is long over.”
“Stickers?” he asked.
“Good boy,” Mycroft praised, and he took Sherlock’s breakfast dishes and the now dirty washcloth into the kitchen as Uncle Greg told Bunny they’d have a wonderful time.
The attic was little more than a large crawl space--the roof was peaked and the walls very short; Sherlock had to duck when he wasn’t standing directly in the middle of the space.  For this reason, the boys climbed around on their hands and knees, yanking on the handles of the old steamer trunk Uncle Greg had left open, elaborate fabrics spilling over the edges, as they pulled it to the middle of the room.
He found his brother where he’d left him at the kitchen table, the bag of crisps they’d been snacking on cleared away but a fresh beer left before Greg’s chair.  His brother said nothing as Greg settled in the chair and opened the beer with a sigh, simply glanced at him with an eyebrow raised.  The expectant expression was familiar, one his oldest brother had given Greg time and again while they were growing up, prompting Greg--always comforted by the knowledge and experience of his big brother--to share secrets and tell tales he otherwise would have guarded close.
Bunny had been a bother and a burden for almost two whole days, and now he was just adding more trouble by wanting to wear girls’ pull-ups and play with dolls.  Why hadn't he realized until that moment just how bad of a boy he’d been?  It was no wonder his Daddy didn’t want to buy him more pink pull-ups or let him wear his new nightgown.  He didn’t deserve them.
Aligning himself to Uncle Greg had the twofold benefit of allowing Sherlock some of the comfort he was desperate for while also allowing for the possibility of a jealous Mycroft.  He stood from his chair and hurried to Uncle Greg’s side, where he pressed himself against the man, holding onto his ratty t-shirt to keep him close.  They were too close for Sherlock's comfort, but Mycroft was watching, so he cuddled closer.
Sherlock allowed himself to be led to a kitchen chair, where, after a hesitation, John told him it was okay to sit down despite his soiled trousers, and then guided his arm to lay atop the table.  He told Sherlock to wait there while he went to retrieve the first aid kit from the downstairs loo.
The boys have certainly had a lot of conflict over the course of a short amount of time, but that's not surprising given that this was the first extended time the four of them have spent ageplaying.  I'm looking forward to letting them have a cute and relaxing last night at the lake house before they pack up and head back to Baker Street.
“Just to clean up,” John said, voice firm albeit a tinge amused, shutting down any hints Sherlock may be dropping about other activities they may get up to in the shower.  “It’s best if we talk before Mycroft and Greg show up on our doorstep.”
“Make it better, Mycroft,” he whined, sniffling through his tears and unsure whether he wanted Mycroft to make his illness better or to help him overcome his lingering hesitancy to be as little as he needed to be.
“Of course,” Mycroft said, reaching down to pat John’s cheek.  “You’re still my big boy.”
“You’ve been squirming around desperate for the last half hour,” Mycroft argued, struggling as Sherlock tried to push him away.  “You think I don’t know when you’re at your limit?”
“I will, Myc,” Greg said, and, when Mycroft did not release his hold on Greg’s now knotted tie: “You just worry about the baby.  I’ll look after him.  I promise.”
Mycroft had distracted John with warm milk in his sippy cup and bedtime stories, but John could not help but feel alone and adrift without Sherlock in the bed beside him.  John could hear the detective prattling on to Uncle Greg across the hallway, in the blue and green bedroom, and he wished he were with him in the purple room, lying next to him on the bed.  The lake house was new and scary; John was afraid of sleeping alone.
“Can I come with you?” John asked.
“Ironically enough,” Sherlock continued, seemingly unaware of John’s amused staring, “the items you were drawn to in childhood were those that Harry herself rejected as she struggled with her own questions of sexuality.  Your predilection likely stemmed from an unconscious belief that your sister’s life was easier than your own and a subconscious desire to therefore claim for yourself all that Harry was given as the female, and youngest child, of the family.  But there’s an interesting point to be made given Harry's sexuality and the dichotomy between---”
“Sherlock, bud?” John called.  “It’s John.  Can I come in?”
Bunny nodded and skipped towards the fridge, where the stickers were held to the stainless steel surface with a variety of colorful magnets.  On the fridge, Sherlock could see what he hadn’t noticed before: Bunny’s chart already held a mermaid sticker in its first box.  Bunny must have used the loo that morning, maybe around the same time Sherlock had peed in his pants.  The thought sent Sherlock’s cheeks blazing, and he buried his face once more into his arms crossed on the table.
He made his body as small as he could, feeling vulnerable and scared dressed in nothing but a sodden pull-up he had just wet and sitting in a puddle from where it had leaked onto the floor.  He was going to get in trouble with Daddy, and Uncle Greg would say I told you so for making him wear a pull-up, and Sherlock wouldn’t want to play with him anymore.
Sherlock, arms still crossed as he eyed Greg and Mycroft through a furrowed brow, shrugged.  Mycroft shared a look with Greg which conveyed the struggles he’d been facing with Sherlock’s moodiness since arriving.
Sherlock smiled and lay his head against Mycroft’s forearm where it rested on the center console, a sign of affection and gratitude.
“Potty now,” he said, sounding as if he were ready to cry once more.
Okay, anyway: **WARNINGS** this newest chapter does feature NSFW play between John and Sherlock.  They are fully adult but the scene is basically all diaper/wetting play, so fair warning if that's not your thing.  I'm also sorry that I didn't come back with a cutesy ageplay chapter like I know a lot of you would have probably hoped for.  What can I say? apparently the lack of human connection over quarantine has put my mind in the gutter.
“I’m going to put Sherlock down for a little nap, Bun,” Daddy said as he hoisted Sherlock into his arms.  “I’ll be right back down.  Be a good boy until I get back.”
“Sherlock, everything alright?”
“Ask her to play something else?” Sherlock suggested after a moment.
“Your four minute timeout has been extended to a five minute timeout,” Mycroft said when Bunny was quieting and had peeked over his shoulder back towards Mycroft.  “If you don’t wish it to extend to a six minute timeout, I suggest you pass over the remote.”
, Mycroft told Greg.
Mycroft checked his phone once more.  He knew Greg and John were not attempting to be intentionally vague; holidays were inherently busy, with little time to get away and communicate with those outside the immediate circumstances.  Even so, as much as he’d deny it, he knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep until he knew his boyfriend and his kids were all okay.
“Don’t run on the stairs!” Greg called after the boy with an amused chuckle.
Wow, has it been a while since I've updated.  I'm realizing that this time of year is always such a tricky time for me--I've had a tough time finding motivation to write and, when I do write, I've been plagued with doubt about being able to convey what I'd like to in each chapter.  As a result, I've been dragging my feet about updating.  But you lovely readers deserve an update, and I made it a point to get something updated before going to sleep tonight.
"Call Mycroft," Sherlock breathed.
Also, thanks so much for all your love on my other stories--Weekend at the Lake is now up to over 20,000 hits!
“There will probably be a lot of people there,” Mycroft warned, kneeling down and holding out a fresh pair of cartoon underwear for the man.  He wanted to ensure John knew what he was signing on for.
“That’s a good boy,” he said, and Sherlock ducked his head against the praise yet accepted a shark in each hand with a small grin.
John did not deliberate for long.  He had worn pull-ups from time to time while adult, particularly because Sherlock was well aware that they were of interest to an adult John for an entirely different reason than they were to the child Bunny.  But this was not about arousal; it was about safety, about comfort.  He cleared his throat and, running a hand along the back of his neck, nodded towards the pull-up before casting his eyes down to the floor.  At least he hadn’t had to say it out loud.
“Good boy,” Mycroft smiled, no longer operating with sarcasm and feeling guilty for attempting to make light of John's feelings.  He reached across the table to pat John’s hand.  He crossed into the living room and grabbed two highball glasses as well as the bottle of bourbon.  He needed to discuss logistics with John before they began, and the presence of alcohol would bring John back into his fully adult state while also allowing John to escape a bit of the embarrassment Mycroft could sense he was feeling.
“And she took…?” John asked, hovering in restless anticipation over the kitchen table between the Holmes brothers.
The only response Greg received to his suggestion was the door shoved against his face as Sherlock pushed it closed.
But being the big brother was harder than being the little brother.  Being a good big brother took a lot of watching, thinking ahead, and accommodating.  Bunny didn’t know if he had the energy to be the big brother while his throat hurt and his eyes and nose were all runny from what Papa had called a “nasty head cold," not to mention while suffering from an extreme lack of sleep and a confused, doubt-filled mind.
Mycroft’s impulse was to stay and keep an eye on Sherlock, particularly given the fact that the consulting detective was clearly refusing to acknowledge any residual pain the memory had brought up.  But he needed to act in accordance with the story as it stood.  A dead dog stolen away and potentially harmed by a neighbor child was distressing, certainly, but not any particular cause for extended alarm to the extent Mycroft would have felt had the truth about Eurus been revealed.
“Need him, Daddy,” John said, voice quiet.  He was feeling a bit non-verbal at the moment, struggling against the adult thoughts trying to enter into his mind which were currently difficult to process.  He hadn't meant to call Mycroft "Daddy," worried that Sherlock might hear, not ready for Sherlock to know, but he was feeling a bit too young not to signal to Mycroft how much he needed him.
John released a breath Mycroft was sure the man did not realize he had been holding.
“I think I managed to convince Anderson not to take it further for the moment,” Greg explained.  “I reminded him that any investigation would bring his own professionalism before the incident into scrutiny, which seemed to at least sober him enough to question the effectiveness of pressing charges.  Donovan took him to get checked out, and promised to follow-up.”
Mycroft was pleased to find himself in the midst of a calm moment at the lake house.  Sherlock had fallen into a light sleep at the kitchen table where he sat in Mycroft’s lap, and Mycroft, knowing Sherlock must not have slept for longer than fleeting stretches of time the night before, was hopeful that once John and Greg had left to run their errands, he could get Sherlock back to bed for some much needed sleep.
"What's wrong, Sherlock?" he asked as Sherlock scrambled around.
Four months had passed, and John had been settling well into his role as Sherlock’s little brother.  They had been making progress with John feeling comfortable enough to stay in headspace for longer periods of time and Mycroft, catching on to John's need to process verbally, had been through numerous conversations regarding the rules and treatments which worked best for John when he was in little space.  Mycroft, for his part, was intrigued with the prospect of having to navigate a new relationship with its own regulations, and he had been enjoying the new challenge of caring for two littles instead of just one.  He took pride in the progress John had been making.  John still disliked being little in public, so the trip to the zoo had been one planned for just Lestrade and Sherlock.  Mycroft expected to spend the morning alone with John, who often took to an age of roughly three to six years old, always a bit younger than Sherlock’s chosen age each day.  But when Mycroft was woken up to Sherlock’s insistent excitement far too early in the morning, he found a shy John tugging on his dressing gown and asking if he could go along to the zoo as well.
Sherlock cried.  He didn’t want to be out in the open where the monsters could get him and where he could see the evidence of his accident in bed.  He was feeling bad because he knew it hadn't really been an accident, and he was supposed to be a big kid.  He needed to be somewhere safe and quiet, so after checking for monsters--a task which frightened him so badly he could feel a new trickle of urine wet his now cold and heavy pull-up--he crawled into the closet and, crying, hugged his stuffed toys to his chest.
“Let’s try the loo now that lunch is over, Bun,” he said, meeting Bunny at the sink, where he left the plates.  He gestured for Bunny to take his hand, then began to lead the boy out of the kitchen and towards the hallway.  “We want to make sure we stay dry, right?”
Hi loves--hope you're all doing well!
“Let’s save your new nightgown for bedtime, huh, Bunny?” Uncle Greg asked, coming up behind him to place a hand on his shoulder.
“Papa? Mycroft?”
It was the first time John had called Mycroft Daddy outright instead of calling him by his first name, and his stomach fluttered with nerves thinking about what Mycroft’s reaction may be.  But, as ever, the man seemed unphased.
“He doesn’t need judgement,” Greg said.  His tone of voice was sensitive to Mycroft’s concern, yet it was also firm, assured.  “Who’s to say there’s anything abnormal about John wanting to wear nightgowns?  We let Sherlock traipse around pretending to be a pirate, which many people would call less than normal.”
“I said, ‘We should pick a movie that won’t scare the baby,’” Bunny explained after he’d finished cleaning his teeth and had spit into the sink.
Greg paused to think over Mycroft’s statement for a moment while he chewed a large bite of chicken.  It sometimes took him a moment to get on the same page as the man, but he had learned over the years the signs which helped him follow Mycroft's trains of thought.  “You mean you think John’s a switch?”
“I’m dry,” Bunny said, his cheeks pinking.  Sherlock could see he was shy, too.
They were in luck; the women’s pajamas section seemed just as preoccupied with bright colors and cartoon characters as was the girls’ section.  For once, Greg felt grateful for nostalgia marketing and society’s preoccupation with infantilizing women.  Bunny wandered, eyes on the floor except for furtive glances up at the items in the section.  It was only once Greg found an oversized sleep shirt with Ariel and Flounder from The Little Mermaid on the front that Bunny seemed to forget his self-consciousness.
Bunny blinked awake and pushed herself up onto her elbows.  Papa was sitting on the end of her bed, still dressed in his work clothes.
“Love you, too, ladybug.”
Eventually, however, Bunny’s bladder was too full to keep from shifting back and forth on his feet as he followed Sherlock's orders to cook the captain’s dinner--shark meat, Sherlock said, from the shark he had captured single-handedly.  He started to cry, feeling uncomfortable and out of options.  Sherlock ignored him.  The bunny was confused, stuck between his own needs and the desire to be a big kid and please his big brother.
“Good boy,” Greg said, knowing Mycroft would not approve of praise for the lapse in potty training but wanting to relax the kid as his first priority.  “Let’s get you cleaned up, love.”
“You’re mean,” he accused, face hardening.  “I’m going to tell Papa on you.”
“Would you like to come sit and talk for a minute?” he asked, and Sherlock, chewing on his fingers with his head ducked, nodded before crossing to him and taking a seat.
“I’m not sure how much he’d want me to share,” Greg began, conscious of speaking for John when the doctor wasn’t in the position to make decisions about what was told.
“Seems like someone could use a bib,” he said, gently teasing.
“There’s someone here who’d like to say a little something to the Bunny if he’s up for it,” Greg said as Mycroft took the clothing from Greg.  He could see the man had passed along a clean pull-up as well as a pair of underwear, perhaps anticipating that Bunny may be too upset to follow the rule of pull-ups after an accident, as he had been after his daytime accident the day previous.
“Alright, buddy,” he said, shifting the car into park and taking off his seatbelt in order to turn himself fully towards the kid.  “Talk to me.”
“Eldest child,” Mycroft reminded Sherlock.  “Statistically, parents most favor discipline and structure over indulgence in direct correlation to the birth order of their children.”
There were footsteps on the staircase, and John stepped into the living room, toweling his wet hair.  He was dressed in jeans and a sweater, and quickly seemed to read the mood of the room.
Bunny thought for sure Mycroft would be able to feel the heat from his embarrassed cheeks as he nodded again.
Sherlock took a running leap onto the bed, but Bunny merely crawled up on the foot of his bed and then on his hands and knees until he was next to his Daddy, who pulled him close and kissed the top of his head.  He could see Sherlock, next to him, making his alligator chomp on Uncle Greg’s ear.
Lestrade smiled, perhaps with a touch of sadness that John had seen from Mycroft whenever John showed that he didn't believe himself worthy of care.
Sherlock shrugged, but then caught Mycroft’s skeptical glances and self-corrected into a nod.  As much as he wanted Mycroft to help him and forgive him and pull him into his lap for a cuddle, he was not ready to relinquish his pride just yet.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and cleared his throat, obviously uncomfortable about having this conversation with his big brother.  Bunny turned to glance up at Mycroft, perhaps confused as to why the man still had his hands pressed against his ears, but Mycroft kept his hands firmly on either side of the boy’s head.  John may have taken part in some rather adult acts with Sherlock, but Mycroft was not about to let Bunny hear something so sexually charged.
Mycroft stood from his chair and moved to the other side of the table.  He nudged John to a standing position, took his seat, and settled the smaller man down onto his lap.
went unspoken, but the sentiment of repetitive betrayal did not go unnoticed.
But, as he thought through the day’s events, John was not entirely against the idea of losing autonomy more often.  It was a feeling he had experienced on rare occasions while in headspace, most notably during his trip to the zoo with Uncle Greg, and the after-effects of such a complete lack of control had never been entirely negative.  John’s emotional breakdowns prompted by such complete helplessness were freeing; when he came back into himself he often felt nothing but a quiet yet electric contentment.
Mycroft could have put up the fight to force his brother into wearing protection--after all, the boy had wet himself--but he knew any argument he might propose would become null unless Mycroft also forced John into pull-ups for also having had an accident.  And he did not feel that would be the best for John’s confidence at the moment.  John was looking up at him fragile and needy.  If Mycroft asked John to wear pull-ups, even if he simply dressed him in one, John would acquiesce without a fight.  But the boy would be affected by the choice, would think Mycroft did not trust him or that Mycroft truly did think, like Sherlock, that he was a baby.  So he simply allowed Sherlock to dress himself in underwear and the rest of his chosen clothing, and he fished around the drawers for a fresh pair of Harry Potter underwear and some comfortable clothes for John.
“Sherlock, love,” Greg said as Mycroft made his way to the fridge and he spooned fried rice onto each plate in turn, “Tell us about reindeer.  Could a red-nosed reindeer exist, do you think?”
“I’ll be good!” he gasped.  “I’m sorry!”
“Very funny,” Mycroft smirked, sarcastic but fond.  Lately, Mycroft had been insisting that Papa eat a bit healthier, much to the disappointment of Papa.  “Come here and tell me what you’d like on your sandwich.”
“Pull-up, Papa?” he asked.
Hopefully this isn't too inconvenient for everyone--I figured this would actually help to keep things more organized moving forward!
Mycroft was prepared for arguments and stropping, but when Sherlock turned his head over his shoulder to glance at Mycroft, it was with gratefulness.  The boy nodded, and his eyes were nearly pleading as a hand travelled to press against his crotch.
“And I don’t think you’re a baby,” Sherlock said.  “And I’m sorry for teasing you because I don’t like it when people tease me, either.”
Uncle Greg and Mycroft shared an amused look.
“You’re such a crybaby,” he said.
Generally, the work kept his longings at bay, distracted him enough to leave the pull of soft clothing and colorful pacifiers by the wayside as he raced against clocks and allowed himself to be absorbed into minutiae.  But there had been whispers of need as their last case was winding down, and,  in the lead-up to the prospect of Christmas at his parents’--a Christmas at his parents’ without John--Sherlock had no longer been able to ignore his desire to be small.
Mycroft paused.  He couldn’t very well put an end to potty training when the entire weekend had been planned for experimentation with it per Bunny’s request.  Yes, Sherlock had admitted he found potty training to be difficult, but Mycroft should have known the boy wouldn’t give it up simply because it caused him distress.  There was competition to worry about, and his status as older brother.
“You’re hurting me,” he said, accusatory.
He sneezed and rubbed his nose on the back of his wrist.  Maybe Mycroft was right and he and John were actually coming down with a cold.  And even if it was only the suggestion of illness that, at the moment, was causing Sherlock to feel congested and foggy, if John truly was sick, Sherlock certainly wasn’t immune, not after making out for so long the night before.
“Are you coming home?”  John asked, shifting from foot to foot on the kitchen linoleum, wishing Greg would stop looking at him.
Now, aged down and seated at the kitchen table in Daddy’s lap while Papa pointed out the details of their very own potty training charts, Bunny felt less sure about the whole idea.  Sherlock had spent the morning fighting against headspace and was in a grouchy, pre-teen mood.  Bunny had dropped into an emotional, clingy headspace as soon as the opportunity arose, but was feeling nonverbal and very young.  He was nervous, afraid of what he had gotten himself into and unsure of his young self after so many long weeks of staunchly remaining adult.  It was all a bit overwhelming.
Greg kissed the boy on the forehead.
Sherlock did not respond, either not having registered John’s question or deliberately choosing to ignore him.  He was draped in the chair, legs thrown over one arm and head tilted back against the other, staring up at his mobile and twitching a foot restlessly.
Sherlock nodded, but Mycroft turned to John.  He did not trust Sherlock when it came to meals and food consumption; the boy was known to lie about having eaten.
“I don’t want to play a girl’s game with you!” he said all at once, throwing the clothes back towards Bunny as he shouted.  “I don’t like girls and I don’t like you when you’re not normal!”
And then he was being lifted from the floor and into his Papa’s lap.  Papa sat on the floor at Daddy and Sherlock’s feet and Bunny clutched fistfuls of his shirt as he cried into his chest.  Papa was making soothing noises and rubbing Bunny’s back, and, for a moment, Bunny felt grounded and safe.
It was painful to watch Sherlock attempting to distract himself from acknowledging the conversation of that morning.  What was worse, John knew from experience that Sherlock could not continue in the way he was for much longer; he would soon tire of insulting strangers on the internet and begin searching for more dangerous distractions.  John needed to intervene if he were to keep Sherlock safe and his actions contained.
He shifted in his seat, pressing his legs together as his bladder pulsed.  Lately, any time he was forced to wait around with a full bladder had him veering towards headspace, wrapped up in thoughts of pull-ups and accidents.  John cleared his throat and shifted to sit a bit taller, reminding himself that he was a grown man.
Sherlock hoped his jiggling about would be misconstrued as excess morning energy, but Papa seemed not to be fooled.  Sherlock tried to squirm away from the diaper check, removing his hands from his crotch to push Papa’s away, but Papa was quick.  He squeezed a palmful of wet diaper before Sherlock could stop him.
“Fine,” Greg said.  “I just need to take a minute away from your misbehaving son.”
Mycroft told Greg he would see him later that night, then hung up the phone.  He hoped Greg was right, and found himself wandering into the guest rooms Mycroft had begun setting up for each of the boys at his house, two small rooms not far from the master bedroom which had an adjoining door that could be propped open to allow the boys to move freely between each others’ room without needing to go out into the hallway.
John cared far too much what others thought, placed too much stock in other’s opinions.  It led to stress and an anxiety Sherlock hated to see the man suffer through.  Sherlock wanted others to find out about his ageplay just as little as John, but, were it to be discovered, he wouldn’t waste more than a passing thought for the opinions of those who were rather insignificant in the grand scheme of his life.
It's such a relief when a chapter comes easily and I know the exact direction I want to take the narrative.  This one was basically fully formed in my mind when I sat down to write it (a super welcome relief after the past 4 or 5 chapters of this story, which felt a bit like pulling teeth), and, as a result, you're all getting an update much earlier than expected.
The days following Victor’s disappearance had been some of the darkest of Mycroft’s young life, certainly the darkest of young Sherlock’s.  There were nightmares and tearful breakdowns and, when it became clear Victor was not coming back, a span of weeks where Sherlock did not speak or sleep and had to be forced to eat.  Even if Sherlock had not yet come to realize that Redbeard was no more a dog than Eurus was a neighbor girl, the residual darkness would be hard to escape.
“Bun, come on and eat when you’re ready,” Greg called from the other side of the bathroom door, and John felt a stab of panic.  He realized he was standing in the bathroom, arms around himself, in nothing but a pull-up and his Gryffindor pajama top.
“I should have told you earlier that John and I had entered into a new dynamic,” Mycroft explained, hands folded on the kitchen table over yellow and blue pieces of jigsaw puzzle.  “I was the one who convinced John the timing wasn’t right to inform you, despite John’s--and Greg’s, for what it’s worth--better judgment.  I understand how jarring it must have been for you to have learned of the relationship in the way that you did.  I’d like to make it up to you, and I can start by honestly answering any questions you may have.”
“Sherlock doesn’t quite understand why you like the things you do, because close-minded people have told him those things are not for boys.  But, guess what?”
Lots of upfront warnings that this chapter is NSFW and is primarily smut.  Both boys are fully adult while fooling around, but if you're in this just for the ageplay (which is more than okay!), you'll likely want to skip this chapter and join us again next time when the boys are feeling less frisky.  We'll get back to your regularly scheduled ageplay programming soon :)
John blinked up.
“Five years old?” Mycroft confirmed, and Sherlock, looking sheepish, nodded.
“Then go right ahead, Bun.  Someone insisted on brushing his teeth a third time,” Uncle Greg sighed as Mycroft and John entered the bathroom and John pushed his pants and underwear to his ankles while he sat on the toilet.  If he were feeling less young he would have been embarrassed to be naked in front of everyone, but instead he revelled in the way it made him feel even younger.  Potty training boys couldn’t be expected to wait for the loo.
Mycroft gave him ten swats on his bare behind, beginning harsh and getting lighter as the boy squirmed and began to whimper.  Bunny wasn’t used to spankings in the way Sherlock was; Mycroft didn’t want to hurt him more than was necessary to impress upon him the gravity of his poor decisions and to settle him into the type of needy, compliant headspace that would allow John to accept care for the rest of the day, if they were lucky.
“I don’t…” John was breathing heavily, blinking up at Mycroft at last.  He turned to glance at Greg, whose brow was furrowed as he began understanding that something was going on, and then back to Mycroft.  Mycroft did not look away.
“Small,” John said right away, clearly not needing to think hard for the answer.  “Vulnerable.  Safe.”
“But what if they were just being nice?” he asked, social anxieties and insecurities clearly at the forefront of his mind.  “What if they never look at me the same?”
John was rather relieved to leave Mycroft in the master bedroom to preside over Sherlock.  Not only was there no one better at reading Sherlock in headspace than Mycroft, but John had to admit he was not against a bit of separation from the man after the events of last night.  Both Mycroft and Greg did their best to treat him and Sherlock as adults when they came out of headspace, but there was always the risk of residual caretaking.  John was feeling embarrassed enough about the events of the night before; he didn’t need to chance additional self-consciousness by hanging around Mycroft as he punished Sherlock.
Mycroft nodded and ordered Sherlock over his knees.  It was a bit of an awkward fit in the back seat of the car, but with Mycroft in the middle seat and Sherlock’s legs bent at the knees to come up against the car door, they were quickly situated.
The adult part of him in the back of his mind began thinking maybe he should age up, that the only way to keep from being more of a bother would be to get big and take some time for himself to process his emotions.  He tried to pull himself out of the vulnerability and sadness swarming in his mind.  But the thought that he’d disappointed his Daddy in some way, that he’d let both Mycroft and Sherlock down, kept him needy and scared.
Mycroft glanced at Greg as if needing confirmation, and Greg provided it with a nod, again communicating through little more than a look and a quick hand gesture that he’d explain everything later.  He would intervene were Mycroft to refer to Bunny as gendered one way or the other, but, for now, as Mycroft took a seat on the couch and allowed Bunny to curl up on his lap, he could see that their currently oldest child was content.
“Thank you, Uncle Greg,” he said into Greg’s chest.
For a reason he was still struggling to work out, John continued to be plagued by thoughts of his father.  The memories had first emerged that morning, spurred to his consciousness by the embarrassment he’d felt after letting Mycroft care for him the night before.  John did not speak often about his childhood, and although details had been recalled when they had been dealing with issues of Bunny’s gender identity, for the most part John had vowed long ago to leave that aspect of his life behind him.  Harry was the only family he had left; there had been no need to keep the memory of his father alive after his death.
John wasn’t sure what had woken him until he saw the overhead hallway light turn off and realized Mycroft and Greg must be going to bed themselves.  There was a domestic contentment to the entire scene: Sherlock dozing next to him, stuffed alligator clutched to his chest and hair mussed from his pillow, Mycroft and Greg readying themselves for bed down the hallway.  John could not help but feel safe, grateful for the lifestyle he had fallen into.
“I’m sorry, Bun.  Papa doesn’t have any pull-ups right now,” he said.
Mycroft ran a hand down his face with a sigh.
“I should get in the shower,” John said.
Mycroft gave a laughing sort of scoff, waiting for Greg to continue.
"Sherlock?" John stood from the arm chair and crossed towards the dark haired man.  "Are you hurt?"
“I’m on my way to one member of my family as we speak,” he said, sincere in the warmth of his tone.  “Besides, this will give me a chance to introduce you to the good old Lestrade clan.”
When Daddy did come to check on him, Bunny started to cry, and even though Daddy had done his best to get him ushered into the hallway loo as discreetly as possible, Sherlock had seen and, pausing in his strop to glance towards Bunny, had teased.
“Papa?” Sherlock asked, sitting up on his knees so he could lean close and whisper into Papa’s ear.  “Are you sleeping?”
“I would never force something like that onto you,” Mycroft said.  “But It seems to me that you’re interested in them, and that only the fear of what others would say discourages you from taking them.”
“That doesn’t count!” Sherlock screeched.  “That was just in case, you said!”
I hope you're all doing well, and I'm sending positive vibes for a wonderful rest of your week!
“It can be scary when someone is taking care of you in a new way, huh?  But we can pretend it’s just like when I take care of you and Sherlock whenever Mycroft is called away.  And that’s pretty normal, right?”
“You’ve earned yourself a very long time-out when we get home,” he said.
“Hey there, Lock.  Who’s your new friend?” Mycroft asked, pulling Sherlock onto his lap.  “Did you have a good time with Uncle Greg and John at the zoo?”
“Do what?” Mycroft asked, voice soft.
“All set, kiddos?” Papa asked from the driver’s seat, twisting over his shoulder to glance back at them.
Mycroft placed the boy to sit on the counter of the sink cabinet and, after wetting a washcloth, reached to wipe the tears from his face.
He picked up a piece of ceramic and checked the sharpness of the edge against the pad of his thumb.
“A rusty old saxophone,” John said, leaning up against the headboard as he draped his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders.
But Sherlock was watching.  Even beneath the sheets the room was filled with enough afternoon light that Bunny could see the interest on his face.
He turned on a political talk-radio station as he pulled away from Baker Street, feeling a sense of accomplishment knowing that he’d successfully managed to get Sherlock out of the house without more than a bit of token protestation.  It had been far too long since he’d been able to spend any significant length of time with his brother, and while his heart worried for John, he was content to know that Sherlock would at least be in his sights for a few days.
Thanks for your kudos and comments, lovelies!  I could use some love and encouragement this week if you're feeling up for commenting--definitely a rough few days but I'm doing all I can to stay positive!
“‘I gotta be big?” he asked, peeping up at Greg, worried.
“I went already,” Sherlock mumbled, pressing the heels of his hands against the tears threatening to fall.
“It all happened quite long ago, Dr. Watson.  No need to over-dramatize now that it’s out in the open.”
But half an hour and another unanswered phone call passed, John stamping his feet to keep out the chill of the December day.  It was below freezing, and the clouds dark; he knew snow was expected.  His phone pinged with a text message, but it was only Greg, asking if he’d made it safely to his sister’s apartment.
But the commotion had clearly been loud enough to have caused Papa concern, because he was suddenly in the bedroom, crossing to heft a tearful little Sherlock into his arms.
“I’ll do my best,” he said.
“Do I gotta be punished for peeing in the car?” Bunny asked when he pulled away from the hug.
“Hey, hey, what’s this?” Mycroft asked, pulling Sherlock closer to him.  “Come here, ‘Lock.  It’s going to be okay.”
“I’m not John-John,” John mumbled.  “I’m Bunny.”
“Let’s get you all cleaned up, ladybug,” Mycroft said after releasing his hands from where they were pressed against Bunny’s ears and leaning to kiss his forehead.
“...And then Sherlock realized it must be a female child involved,” John was saying, verbose in his chagrined state, “because you hadn’t been hesitant in the past to have him associate with women while--”
Mycroft rolled his eyes, smirking at his boyfriend’s mimicry, but flicked on the telly and began scrolling through their movie options until he found something appropriately young and colorful.  He passed Greg the baby bottle of juice he had prepared earlier, then helped Bunny switch their pacifier for a sippy cup.  It was only a matter of minutes before Sherlock, tilted against the armrest as Greg fed him his juice from the bottle, was asleep.  Bunny was not far behind, dozing against Mycroft’s chest almost as soon as his sippy cup was empty, after less than half an hour of the film.
Sherlock was galloping around the flat, but he was clearly still following the train of conversation.
five years old, it can be hard to let yourself
Sherlock was not about to let himself be led into the humiliation of corner time and an afternoon nap.  Moving sharply, he stopped walking and bent his knees in an attempt to duck out from beneath Mycroft’s grip.  He managed to get his shoulder free, but Mycroft had somehow anticipated the move and used the opportunity to take Sherlock by the arm, which gave Sherlock far fewer options.  He was trapped, and Mycroft was squeezing his arm in a way Sherlock knew he couldn't loosen.
“Ariel or Elsa?” he asked, holding out the cups, each decorated with familiar images from The Little Mermaid and Frozen.  “Cups with covers only come in the Disney princess variety in this house, I’m afraid.”
“Papa, do you know what we named rabbit?” Bunny asked.
“I’m fine,” John said.
“Greg?” Bunny asked while he was being led across the hallway.  Greg hummed to show he was listening.  “I want to get little again,” John said.
Bunny could see his Daddy wavering.
“Yes.  But tell me why, sweetheart.” Mycroft said, his tone of voice softer, encouraging John to voice his needs as always.
Sherlock immediately opened his mouth to speak, but Mycroft held up a hand to silence him.
Greg had known it would be a challenge for John to remain adult given the stress of unfamiliar circumstances and the memory of his sister’s rejection.  There were only so many hours he could be expected to put on a brave face given the sheer amount of effort required to navigate the over-saturated social gatherings of strangers.  Greg was surprised he’d lasted as long as he had, and knew he had his mum to thank for keeping John mostly adult until they’d left for his brother’s.
Sherlock was pulling on a pair of dinosaur underwear.  Mycroft raised his eyebrows.
John emerged from his bedroom, dressed in jeans and a sweater.  He nodded at Mycroft, seemingly having trouble making eye contact, before following Greg downstairs and into the kitchen, where they would wait for Mycroft’s next word.
Mycroft shook his head.
A quick update because you've all been waiting--I hope you're all well!
“As is generally the case with my brother,” he said, “It appears the appeal of slipping lower has been eradicated now that it would not necessarily suit his present needs.”
Sherlock leaned forward to lay his head on Mycroft’s shoulder.  He took his thumb into his mouth, and was grateful when Mycroft did not tell him to take it out when he started to suck, sensing that Sherlock needed the comfort at the moment.
Bunny ducked his head and began to eat, not acknowledging Papa at all.  He’d taken precautions to keep Sherlock from teasing him, and now Papa had gone and called him a baby girl name.  Didn’t he see that this older Sherlock was different than yesterday’s little Sherlock?  Didn’t he see that this Sherlock didn’t like it?
“Used to go to places like that,” Bunny said, and Greg was grateful that he was close enough to hear the kid’s whispered phrases.
“I’m sorry, poppet, but there are a few final loose ends that need to be tied up here.  I promise I’ll be back as soon as possible, probably as early as tomorrow, and then I’ll spend as much time with my little boy as he wants.  Are you with Uncle Greg?”
It had all just been too much at once: Greg arriving before John and Sherlock had even gotten out of bed, the man settling into caretaker mode immediately as he cooked them breakfast and roused them awake, John slipping down seemingly without a second thought and leaving Sherlock alone with his doubts and worries.
“Thanks, ‘Lockie,” he said, keeping his voice as warm and easy-going as possible.
Warnings for a fairly intense spanking in this chapter.
Mycroft was speaking more openly with John than he perhaps ever had before, and John did not take for granted the trust the man was placing in him by telling him the truth.  Mycroft seemed grateful for John's ever-attentive presence.
And then Sherlock was alone, grasping for the pacifier and burrowing under the sheets.  He pressed the soother into his mouth and hugged his dinosaur to his chest, running his chin along the soft red backplates.  New tear streaks formed along his cheeks as he blinked his eyes closed.
“Yes, bud?”
Greg smiled, brushing the wet hair from the the boy’s forehead.
As always, feel free to let me know what you'd like to see next :)
“I don’t want you to,” Sherlock said, crossing his arms on the table and burrowing his face into them.  “I don’t like you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
What was more confusing was why John kept thinking back to the day when he wet himself at the zoo, why he felt excitement when he thought about the wet spot he had left on the couch the night before.  But John did not feel entirely comfortable chatting with Mycroft about wetting himself, especially because, deep down, he knew there was another element to this desire, something far from childish.
“First things first,” Greg said after cranking the heat up in the car and buckling his own seat belt. “I bet you could use the loo, huh?”
Mycroft cleared his throat.  His brother knew what was required for a proper explanation.  They had decided on parameters long ago.  Sherlock sighed, stomping his foot in a show of aggravation.
“John? Where are you?”
“No,” he said.  “There was a slight moment when he began to age up, but it was clear he wasn't ready to come out of headspace yet.  He needs more time to process what happened and how he’s feeling before he’ll be ready to chat.”
Mycroft nodded and pulled John in for a hug.
Bunny clambered over Sherlock’s legs to leave the car, and the boys got tangled in a mess of limbs for a moment before Greg reached and yanked Bunny from the car by his armpits, smiling.  He coaxed the pacifier out from between Bunny's lips and slipped it into his pocket.  Bunny looked distressed for a moment, but Greg took his hand and told him he could have it back as well as his lion right after they used the loo and got some food.
They spent the next ten minutes in front of the window, looking out onto Baker Street as Sherlock slowly moved from short-sentenced quips to prattling on about their neighbors and the occasional passer-by.  It was only when a woman passed by walking her dog that Sherlock became quiet once more, pausing in the midst of a discussion of late-night traffic patterns to hide his face against Mycroft’s shoulder.
He sat on his free hand and set about coloring more carefully.  He refused to allow his thumb to wander up towards his mouth just because he was feeling sad.  Now wasn’t the time to let himself be littler than Bunny; he had to be bigger if he was going to keep Bunny and Papa from ganging up on him.
Bunny took the cup from his mouth and blushed, glancing down to the tile floor.
“No matter what,” Mycroft said, taken aback a bit by sherlock’s train of thought and praying it wasn't a sign of something Sherlock himself had been contemplating.  Mycroft patted Sherlock's thigh to signal that he was finished, then helped the boy back under the sheets and his dinosaur comforter.
But he found himself unable to begin the conversation he knew needed to be had.  Was he supposed to apologize for his behavior in headspace earlier that day? Should he explain that he and John had talked, that they were once and for all okay?  Did Mycroft expect him to be completely okay with the Daddy and little boy relationship he had formed with John?  Sherlock picked at the edge of one of the children’s band-aids on his hand.
Maybe it was less than adult to allow himself to bask in just how good it felt to have his effort acknowledged, but John was too exhausted from the emotional strain of the day to give it much thought.  Greg’s hand on his lower back, however, made him long for cuddles and his baby blanket.  He stepped away from the touch to keep himself from the pull in his stomach telling him to collapse into Papa’s chest with a needy whine.
John patted the bed next to him.
Mycroft took a deep breath which he released slowly.  They had both messed up spectacularly, ignoring warning signs and losing sight of their kids in the landscape of work. Now, it was their responsibility to put it right.
But as he began to gather the laundry, he could not help but catch the pad of his thumb on a cold, damp patch on a pair of Sherlock’s trousers.  It was then he noticed the smell, and sure enough when he ran his hand along the inner seams of each pant leg, they were wet in a very telling pattern.  He found a pair of what he knew to be John’s jeans in the same state, and sighed.
“Why do you want to wear one of the new ones, Bunny?” he asked.
“Worried it will unhinge old memories, more like,” Sherlock said, clearly interested in following the facts through to their conclusion.
Mycroft, for his part, seemed to have deduced what was wrong as John stood frozen in the purple room at the lake house.
“Who, love bug?” Greg asked, pausing with the sheets balled up in his arms.
Sherlock had been sullen around Mycroft for weeks, blaming him for the slip up, but Mycroft had refused to humor his brother’s anger.  Instead, he simply called Greg to visit the next time Sherlock was spending the night at Mycroft’s.  John, having given his okay to the plan only reluctantly, worried the man may be shocked out of headspace, but Mycroft had assured him the embarrassment would have the opposite effect on Sherlock, that Sherlock coming face to face with Greg would actually push Sherlock deeper down in age.  Mycroft had been correct, and the night had ended with Greg putting a giggling Sherlock to bed.  How Greg could keep Sherlock consistently giggling Mycroft would never fully understand, but the bond between the two had been solidified with Greg's dinosaur growls and pirate impressions, and Lestrade from that point forward had become, much to Mycroft’s bemusement and adult Sherlock's distress, Uncle Greg.
“Sherlock’s rules?”
“Unclear,” John said, reaching to rub at a wet spot on Sherlock’s pajama pants.  “You may have to run a few more experiments before coming to any conclusions.”
“Want to see the zoo ducks,” John said, tugging down on his pajama shirt as Mycroft guided him to step out of his pajama pants.
“I just want him to feel free to be himself in headspace,” he said.
“Serves you right for pissing on me,” Sherlock said.
He swiped at tears as he scrambled from the bed and bent to examine the shards of ceramic and the exposed filaments of the broken light bulb.
He was relieved when he heard footsteps on the staircase and approaching the room down the hallway.  He needed to pee, and he needed Papa or Daddy to help him escape Sherlock’s glare.
I'm looking forward to the next story in this series, and can't wait to get started!
Mycroft nodded, and, after dropping his coat off on the coat rack, followed Greg to the second floor and into the bedroom Mycroft had set up for Sherlock.  The duvet cover Mycroft had found for Sherlock’s room was a nautical map covered in sailing ships following dotted lines showing each ship’s trajectory, and there were throw pillows shaped like boat anchors and whales scattered on the bed and the windowseat.  There was even a treasure map rug beneath the desk next to the window.
He nodded, then drank deeply to offset the guilt pricking the edges of his mind.  It was only the second time in the presence of John and Greg that Sherlock had allowed himself to drop as young as he'd been that day.  The detective had obviously been signalling his need for attention, and John had ignored Sherlock’s needs in favor of his own.  He hadn’t let his boyfriend have the care he desperately needed because his behavior had forced Mycroft and Greg to place John and his crisis of identity as their highest priority.
Sherlock was most susceptible to self-harm and destructive behavior when in the midst of a let-down after a case.  It often took Sherlock a day or two after finalizing logistics and processing the events of each case to begin feeling little.  Sherlock was not about to suddenly want to slip younger just because John had been stressed about wetting himself.  And if John abandoned Sherlock by slipping into headspace, who would be around to make sure Sherlock was handling the post-case boredom without resorting to his self-destructive tactics?
But John was not in a position to let the man’s carelessness slide, and he was on his feet with threatening epithets in an instant, body posed for fighting.  The younger man held up his hands and apologized again, but John lunged, and soon found himself in the midst of a shouting, scrambling bar fight.
He was feeling smaller than he had all day, and all he wanted to do was curl up in bed with Dimitri and his pacifier and hide under the blankets.  But he had to get rid of the evidence before Mycroft or Papa came to check up on him or sent Bunny to call him for lunch.  He stood--shuddering when dribbles of liquid pulsed down his legs--peeled off his soaked socks to keep from spreading his mess, and crept to the door, which he opened slowly.  He peered into the hallway, checking that the others were still downstairs.
“You know the rules,” Mycroft told Sherlock as he twisted the lid onto the cup and placed it on the edge of the tabletop, where he knew it was in Sherlock’s eyeline.  “Timeout only begins when you’re settled and calm like a big boy.”
"Mycroft, what is going on?" John could not keep from asking.  "I've never seen him...regressed like this, I--"
“Hey, buddy,” Mycroft said, and John pressed his face harder against Mycroft’s shoulder, either embarrassed or still feeling as if he’d let Sherlock down--likely both.  “Everything okay?”
Mycroft stood and lifted Sherlock into his arms.
“Get some rest, kid,” Uncle Greg called as he flipped off the light and pulled the door closed.  “We’ll get through this.”
“Greg and I have plenty of clothes for little Sherlock and for Bunny, but if you're going to insist on staying big, pack what you’ll need,” Mycroft said.  “We’re leaving in half an hour and, judging from your states, you both need to eat something before a long car ride.”
“John and Sherlock,” he explained, thrown-off by the way in which past conversations with his big brother--delicate conversations about girlfriends, boyfriends, sex--reverberated into the current moment.  “When they’re small.”
“You’re doing well,” Greg whispered when dinner was finishing up.
Sherlock knew that Greg was just as saddened by Sherlock hurting himself as Mycroft and John would be, but somehow Papa never let him feel as if he took it personally when Sherlock hurt himself.  He reacted almost just as if Sherlock had wet his pants or spilled his juice, dealing with the issue logically, step-by-step until the problem was handled.  It was why Sherlock had called him, why he had been so desperate for his help.
Mycroft, sighing, nodded.  "Just this once.  And don't tell your brother," he said, and John agreed quickly, although he felt a twinge of guilt over all of the secrets he and Mycroft had lately been keeping from Sherlock.
They’d been working so many long hours that neither of them had much time to consider the stark contrast between their current activities and those of the past weekend.  They hadn’t paused long enough to realize they’d been neglectful in terms of taking care of themselves--barely sleeping, keeping extremely late hours, eating only fast-food and unhealthy takeaway when they could even be bothered to eat.  Even if John did feel, in the early morning hours as visions of gruesome deaths remained on the inside of his eyelids when he tried to sleep, that things were not quite right, or that maybe it was too much too soon, he did not have the time or energy to acknowledge the feelings.
“Sherlock,” John warned, signalling his lack of patience for Sherlock’s fibs.
After dinner, Uncle Greg suggested a movie to calm them down, and guided John over towards the cabinet beneath the television, telling him to choose something.  John shyly held out Beauty and the Beast, and Greg smiled widely and encouragingly because it appeared the boy was nervous about his selection.
Uncle Greg put Sherlock to bed in the spare cot while he began stripping the twin bed of the wet sheets.  He used the dry edges of the sheet to sop up the puddle of urine pooled on the plastic mattress cover.  The cot was too short for Sherlock, and his feet hung off the end.  There also wasn't a mattress cover on the cot, and Sherlock worried about what would happen if he wet the bed again.  Uncle Greg and Mycroft had made up the cot in case Bunny got scared in the night, the memory of which only made Sherlock think about where the Bunny was actually sleeping.  He felt something more than sadness at that moment, he felt anger.  Angery because Mycroft was his and because the Bunny was supposed to come sleep with him if he got scared, not with Mycroft, and because the cot didn't have a stupid babyish mattress cover on it because Bunny didn't need that like Sherlock did.  Nothing seemed fair.
Greg’s mum seemed to assess John for a moment before taking the dish towel from her shoulder and setting it on the dining room table.
But Sherlock stomped off with a laugh, saying only babies had daddies, and he left his little brother in the mud.  The bunny would be fine; he would no doubt be found by an overprotective and worried Mycroft.
Mycroft hummed a gruff acknowledgement as he took his seat again at the table, but otherwise did not respond to Greg’s suggestion.  He was still hopeful that Sherlock would see the error of his ways and confess to his deceit on his own terms.  He would not admit it aloud, but there was something of pride in his refusal to put an end to Sherlock’s piercing guilt--he thought he’d raised Sherlock better than this, thought the boy understood the implications of dishonesty.
Sherlock blushed for what felt like the hundredth time that day, but he nodded.
Had they been in Sherlock’s bed, the mattress would not have been of concern; Sherlock’s plastic mattress cover had been securely tucked onto his bed long before John had even moved into Baker Street.  But John was not prone to bedwetting while he slept, except for the occasional accident while in headspace.  They almost always shared Sherlock’s bed when they were little, and, as such, John’s mattress was unprotected.
“I, ah,” John seemed to realize just how he must look and yanked the sheets to cover his half-dressed state.  “I’m alright, now, Mycroft.  I’m sorry I asked you to come.”
It was only a moment after the showed had been turned off that Mycroft heard Sherlock’s shouting.
“Oh, love bug,” Greg said, cupping the boy’s chin.  “Let Papa get you some medicine, poor boy.”
“I had chicken nuggets and Sher’ock had a hamburger,” John said, rubbing his face against the back of his arm.
Sherlock found the puzzle piece’s rightful spot and fit it into the partially-completed puzzle with a satisfied hum.  He could feel Mycroft's eyes on him.  His brother had been sitting still in his chair, waiting for Sherlock to focus on the matter at hand.
He tried not to worry about his pacifier as he was led to the bathroom, but when he pushed away the sadness of losing it, he was left with unresolved thoughts about the looks Sherlock had given him that morning.  As much as he told himself Sherlock’s opinion on what Bunny wanted to wear and play with didn’t matter, the fact of the matter was that he wasn’t confident enough in his little personality to shake off his older brother's judgement.  Sherlock was too important to him; he looked up to him too much.  As he washed his hands and brushed his teeth while Daddy held his blanket and his rabbit, he found himself glancing in the mirror and then down at himself to gauge whether or not he looked as silly as Sherlock had seemed to think that morning.
Mycroft would have made the kid give up his comfort items in the midst of punishment, but Greg couldn’t bear to leave him without some semblance of familiarity, at least for the moment.
headspace, hadn’t acknowledged the small feelings that had been pricking the corners of his mind all day.  Sherlock gave in at last, and, with a sigh, nodded against Mycroft’s shoulder.
"Where is he?"
“We’ll call you for lunch,” Daddy said, and Sherlock’s chair scraped against the lino as the moody boy stood to leave the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft nodded, unable to keep from eyeing the darkened patch of urine on the sheets from Sherlock's earlier wetting.
Bunny shrugged and then nodded, attempting to put on a brave face, but he soon dissolved into tears once more.  He had been so happy just a short time ago, confident and glowing with a sense of self.  Now, he couldn’t help but feel that he’d ruined everything, that what he loved most about being little was being threatened.  All he could do was cling to his Papa and cry, closing his eyes and wishing he could start the day over again.
“Can Daddy help you get all cleaned up?” Mycroft asked, wanting to let Bunny set the timeline.
“I don’t want to be anywhere other than right here, bud,” Greg said.  “Besides, it helps me relax, too.”
“Pull-ups are okay by me,” Mycroft smiled, and Uncle Greg ruffled his hair to signal his own agreement.
Sherlock shut him up with another kiss, tugging him towards the bathroom.
Sherlock’s gaze was back on the footwell, feet shifting nervously, and Mycroft could see that his cheeks were pink with embarrassment.
John reached over and threw an arm over Sherlock's shoulders, clearly grateful for Sherlock's acceptance.  Sherlock turned and buried his face into his dinosaur, yanking the comforter up over his head and squirming away from John.
“Then we need to go inside for a time-out,” Mycroft said, placing a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder which the consulting detective attempted unsuccessfully to shrug off.  “And, after your time-out, a nap.  It’s clear the lack of sleep from last night has left you overtired.”
“And he worked as a…”
The man forced his eyes open.
Mycroft spun in his seat to stare at Sherlock in shock.
Greg nodded.
“Food’ll be right out, hun,” she said before returning to the other end of the bar.
His heart beat. He was too adult to ignore the bit of guilt he felt knowing he was contemplating willingly peeing himself all over Greg’s backseat, but he knew that, were he ever to question John’s motives, Greg would understand.  Papa just wanted his boys to be content, and John knew wetting his pants in the backseat of Greg’s car would almost certainly settle him quickly into an embarrassed, snivelling headspace.
Sherlock squirmed a bit in Mycroft’s arms, the words hitting a bit too close to home.  He’d been told the same thing after punishment far too often.  But Mycroft patted him on the thigh and Uncle Greg ruffled his hair as he came to stand behind them, and he settled.
Sherlock lay back against his pillow and nodded.  There was a flash of adult cynicism on his face which Mycroft knew had to do with Sherlock’s own self-consciousness about his wettings, but luckily the man overcame it and settled back into his younger state of mind.  “Won’t call John-John a baby, anymore,” he said.
“Yes,” he said.  “You’re a boy who likes mermaids and bunnies and unicorns.  Just like there are girls who like pirates and cars and dinosaurs.”
Mycroft stood from the table, clearing the cups and saucers.
Sherlock blinked up at him and wiped his tears eyes with the back of his hands before leaning forward to press his face into John’s sweater.
, the thing taunted.  He could hear it breathing a chortling laugh as he sat, soaked to the skin in quickly-cooling urine.
“I care very much for him,” John said, and wondered just how much Mycroft knew about the romantic relationship he and Sherlock had settled into.  The fact that his boyfriend was now inviting him to---be what? His father? A second older brother?--was more than enough to bring John pause.
He was pleased to see that the boy did not shy away from him now that he was not attempting to take him out of the car, instead burying his face into his chest as he pressed against his side and cried.  But Bunny was wriggling and grabbing himself, and Greg knew they were out of options.
“I’d say we might just have another little on our hands,” Greg smiled.  “If you’re ready to take on that additional responsibility, you should talk to him, Myc.  John’s clearly a man who’s seen his fair share of pain.  A little comfort might go a long way towards alleviating some hardship.”
John knew he should refuse; he was a grown man.  It would be some time before he’d even be able to consider slipping back into headspace.  But he and Mycroft had been through this before, and as much as he didn’t want to admit it, there was a comfort in knowing he would not be left alone.  If he told Mycroft to leave, he would curl up on the floor with a blanket and force himself to stay awake until morning, too exhausted to clean himself up and too terrified of the reappearance of images to allow himself to rest.  He knew because it had all happened before, long before he’d begun ageplaying.
“Alright, bud,” he said.  “But you should come in to use the loo.  I’ll stay with you the entire time.  We’ll go right in and right out.”
“Why are you crying, bud?”
John simply gaped up at Sherlock, a question unformed in his expression that, luckily, Sherlock could decipher.
“Sherlock.  Listen to me,” he said, guiding Sherlock by the chin to look up at him.  “I love you very much, and I love your brother very much.  My relationship with Bunny will never replace  or change my relationship with you.  My role as Bunny’s Daddy does not alter the fact that being your big brother is the one of the most special parts of my life.”
“I’m afraid that’s another impossibility,” Mycroft was saying, leaning back in his office chair.  “But, really, what did you expect?”
Bunny whined in the back of his throat and shook his head as he attempted to squirm away.  He didn’t want to have a chat or to stand half-naked in the cold bathroom.  He wanted to get dressed and be put back to bed, and he wanted the memories of last night’s nightmare to stop encroaching on his thoughts so that he could get some sleep.
Next chapter will have all the boys back together, again :)
I'm debating between doing an in-depth christmas day at the Holmes house vs. the Lestrade house for each pair or just glancing over their mornings in order to get them all back to Mycroft's for their own Christmas celebrations.  Let me know which you would prefer!
Sherlock was playing with legos in the living room when Bunny and Daddy reached the kitchen.  Papa Greg was setting plates down on the table.
But Greg did not respond, and there was a catch in the kid’s throat when he next spoke.
Sherlock watched Mycroft and Uncle Greg share a look.
Edited for continuity after "Uncle Greg and Little John" was updated.
Greg wished John had taken the opportunity to latch back onto his little headspace; there was a way in which what John could most do to help the situation would be to slip back down and stay Bunny.  If John stayed adult and Mycroft could not know that John was being cared for emotionally, Mycroft would be worried about both Sherlock and John instead of primarily focusing his attention on Sherlock.
As soon as Bunny smiled and blushed, Sherlock knew he’d said the right thing.  He reached out and took Bunny’s hand, pulling him close until he was lying beside him once again.  He lay his head on Bunny’s shoulder, and let his hand grab onto a fistful of Bunny’s nightshirt.
“Because Daddy’s a meanie,” Bunny mumbled before he could censor himself.
“Your brother was just teasing,” Mycroft said, and John nodded.
“I’m a big boy,” he sniffled to the Bunny, who had rested his head on his shoulder.
Mycroft sat up in bed, casting aside the book he had been reading since he’d brought Sherlock upstairs to bed.  He’d heard his parents come up to bed some time ago and had quickly flipped his bedside light off to keep them from knowing he was still awake, rolling his eyes at the sheer childishness of it all yet barely breathing again until he’d heard them settle into bed in the next room and had turned his light back on.
“Did he age up to process with you?” Greg asked.
Bunny nodded, climbing from Daddy’s lap and scrambling towards Papa.  He pressed himself against the taller man, needing the contact, and Papa hugged him close as they used magnets to stick first Bunny’s and then Sherlock’s chart up onto the stainless steel of the refrigerator.
The doctor nodded again and looked down at the floorboards.  John seemed to consciously not be making eye contact with Mycroft.
“We should get you settled into some clean clothes,” Mycroft offered, stepping into the room as he decided to take matters into his own hands.
“There’s some jealousy, I suppose,” Sherlock said after a moment, glancing down into his pint.  “Only natural.”
Bunny laughed, rubbing at the now-dried tear tracks down his cheeks as he nodded.
John glanced up in shock.
“There’s nothing wrong with wanting any of the things you feel drawn to, princess,” Mycroft continued.  “As long as they don’t hurt yourself or anyone else.  When you feel like a girl, you have every right to be a girl.  And when you want to be a boy, you can be a boy.  Your Papa and I care most that you’re happy and yourself.”
“Let’s let them be,” Greg had said when Mycroft attempted to remain close to the two men.  “They deserve some privacy.”
“Don’t like potty training,” Sherlock said all at once, leaving Mycroft wondering whether this was a new topic of conversation or an extension of their last one.  “...‘s too hard.”
They had been through this before: the twisted memories of the trauma John had seen on the battlefield, the suffocating nightmares.  All a part of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, his therapist had long-ago explained, the nightmares a symptom just like his anxiety and dislike of enclosed spaces.  But the nightmares generally happened while he was fully adult; they were usually kept at bay by the contented calm of his younger headspace.  It was almost worse when they happened while he was little, because they never failed to remind him of the deepest pains of his adult life, shifting him far too quickly up in age and leaving him rather unmoored.  John slipped out of headspace as he slipped away from the bloody, horrifying images.
“Then that’s what we’ll do, Bun,” Mycroft said.  “We’ll need to keep you in pull-ups all the time, then.  Is that what you want?”
“Come here, kiddo,” Daddy repeated.
Mycroft was quiet for a moment, and Bunny knew it was to allow him the space to speak up, to elaborate and explain exactly what it was he wanted.  Bunny was sleepy and warm pressed against his Daddy, and a part of him wanted to allow himself to drift off and finally take a nap.  But a larger part of him knew this was his chance to ask for what he wanted, and his Daddy always told him he needed to voice his needs.
“Sherlock, what’s wrong?” John asked, and Sherlock could see the man hovering between headspaces, John’s protectiveness forcing him out of his young headspace for a moment.  It was clear the man was attempting to decide whether Sherlock needed him to age up.  Sherlock did not want to cause John any further stress.  He’d already put him through enough these past three days; John deserved the release that came from innocence and lack of responsibility.
Sherlock stumbled up the front steps, swiping rainwater from his forehead and out of his eyes.  He burst through the front door of 221 Baker Street and climbed the stairs to Apartment B, slamming the door back against the wall when he threw it open.
“He’d been addicted at uni?”
“Yes,” he said, and, just like that, Bunny was gone.
Mycroft could see that Greg was not going to waver, that the man was too uncomfortable about the prospect of having to spank their little bunny to follow through on any punishment of the sort.  Mycroft only wished Greg could see that, more often than not, the boys acted out because they were struggling to accept or deal with various aspects of their headspaces.  Spankings settled them into a vulnerable place where they were more able to accept love and affection, exactly what Bunny needed at the moment.
Greg slammed the door shut and circled around to place the shopping bags into the trunk.  By the time he had taken his own seat on the driver’s side, Bunny was crying in the back seat, his thumb in his mouth.
“Oh alright,” Sherlock said, nodding towards the front windows.  “The lot of them passed by half an hour ago.  Prattling on and on about their insufferable victory.  Balance of Probability.”
Mycroft lifted the man into his arms, an action Sherlock was always jealous of and which prompted another taunt of “baby, baby, baby,” from the older boy.
John’s cheeks were pink once more as he swallowed the bourbon Mycroft placed in front of him.
17 hours and 8 minutes, but at least the next seven to eight of those could be spent closed away from the others--nine if he pretended to sleep in, a ploy that wouldn’t work on Mycroft but could very well work on his parents, who were far less familiar with Sherlock’s sleeping patterns.
Bunny, reluctantly, obeyed.
“Italian.”
“I don’t know how to say it,” he said, and Mycroft stepped towards him, placing a hand on his shoulder.
Sherlock had to pee. He'd woken up suddenly after dreaming of sitting in the back of a classroom in middle school, unable to leave to use the loo, and when he blinked his eyes open he immediately brought his hands between his legs, conscious of the pressure in his bladder.
Mycroft met his gaze, eyes soft and understanding, but Sherlock could not let himself register his brother’s comforting presence without going to pieces.  So, he stuck out his tongue and then pressed his face once more into his arm.  His brother’s comfort had somehow become temporary, ready be taken away at any time.
Sending Bunny kisses as always.  <3
“Not a baby,” Bunny whispered, barely audible around the nipple of his own pacifier as he scampered into Sherlock’s room.
“It’s unsafe for both your brother and yourself,” Mycroft said, raising his eyebrows as he waited for an explanation.
Sherlock shook his head, ready to protest.  Mycroft had been far more patient than his busy parents had ever been.  He’d helped Sherlock, had been there for him when he was struggling to make sense of keeping his pants clean.   But Mycroft held up a hand to keep Sherlock from interrupting.
Papa and Daddy praised the beauty of Bunny’s perfectly colored picture of a pink ship on a purple ocean, then Papa ruffled Sherlock’s hair as he leaned over Sherlock’s page.
“Okay, Daddy.”
He began to cry when the coughing was finished, wiping his mouth.  He didn’t want to be sick, and he hadn’t really wanted to get little.  Now he was both, and there were too many feelings to process all at once.
John couldn’t help but look at Greg with worry, the part of him allowing his adult mind to slip away afraid at the prospect of being without his blanket.  He sat on the edge of the bed and took his plush lion into his lap, stroking its fur.  Not having the opportunity to cuddle with his blanket, knowing he hadn't taken care to make sure she'd been out of the way when he peed his underpants, made him want her all the more.
Bunny had been gathered up in Daddy’s arms and comforted as she cried over the nasty words from Sherlock, Papa stroking her back as Daddy shushed her and told her it would all be okay.  She felt insecure and pained and hesitant to remain a little girl, but it had been a hard few days, and it felt like a lot of work to shift into being a boy at the moment.
“I pinched Bunny,” Sherlock said, voice tinged with remorse.  “And I pushed him out of bed.”
Uncle Greg smiled and helped him into the bathtub.
Mycroft was beginning to get impatient.  Clearly, his brother was hiding his younger headspace even more than he originally thought.  It was one thing for Sherlock to stubbornly refuse Mycroft’s help.  It was another for both boys to have been young enough to wet themselves and not to have admitted to Mycroft or Greg that they were little until John broke down due to a bad dream.
Mycroft barged into 221b Baker Street on a bright and sunny Thursday morning, toting his overnight bags and followed by a half-asleep Greg who was clutching a travel mug of coffee and clearly attempting to mask his fatigue after being woken so early.  He dropped a grocery bag in the kitchen before heading down the hallway.
John nodded.  “But it’s...embarrassing,” he said.
Sherlock’s cheeks pinked, and he whined, but kept talking.
Mycroft lifted him off of his lap and stood him up beside the bed.
“You can leave, now,” he called into the kitchen, where Mycroft was washing dishes.
“I have to go,” he said.
Bunny crossed his arms and ducked his aching head, his chin resting on his chest.
“Did you get far in your video game, champ?” Papa asked as he tucked into his lunch, obviously attempting to draw Sherlock into the conversation.
Greg pulled into a rest area and parked at the far end of the parking lot, where there were very few scattered cars.  He and Mycroft, after setting the child locks to keep Sherlock and John inside, got out of the car and shared a quick conversation.  Sherlock could catch his name and “Bunny” spoken on their lips when they turned to glance back at them, but otherwise the men stayed turned with their backs to Sherlock, more than likely for exactly the reason that Sherlock was skilled at reading lips.
"John? What is it?...Watson? Tell that brother of mine my patience is wearing thin, as it has been with him for the past month.  He knows as well as I that his recent behavior--"
Bunny was wearing new pull-ups, different from the ones Sherlock wore when he was bigger.  Bunny sat up on his knees to show them off: purple and pink and flowery.
Edited after "Little John and Uncle Greg" was posted to make up for some continuity issues :)
“Yes, Bunny?”
Mycroft hummed.
“He’s the bad guy,” Sherlock mumbled around his sticky fingers, nodding his chin towards the screen of the telly when John sat down next to him with his own breakfast.
“I don’t need to talk, Mycroft,” he said, knowing the man on the other end of the phone call was saying more with his silence than he ever could with words.
Bunny scooted closer to Mycroft when the Marley brothers appeared draped in chains, resting his back against the base of the couch so he could press his cheek against Mycroft’s knee.  The boy looked adorable in his red and white striped one-piece pajamas, nursing his favorite pacifier as he cradled both Willa the rabbit and his baby blanket to his chest, and the solid presence of the kid leaning against him grounded him a bit, for which Mycroft was grateful.  He may have been a loss of exactly how to care for Sherlock while they were away from home and avoiding the notice of their parents, but knew how to show up for his kiddos here in London.
“Of course,” Mycroft said, finding himself just wanting to comfort the man.  He reached across the table and patted John’s hand, signalling with the endearment that John could slip completely if he needed to.  He pulled a pen and pad of paper from his suit coat’s breast pocket.  “Just as soon as you settle on a safeword.  Write it down for me, love.”
Sherlock rubbed his eyes as he groaned and blinked awake.
Greg was out of options, concerned when another car pulled up a few parking spaces over and cast glances towards Bunny.  Wanting to protect his boy’s privacy, Greg closed Bunny’s door and walked around to climb into the backseat through the other door, closing it behind him and shifting over until he was in the middle seat, where he could gather Bunny close.
"Lock, are you okay?"
Sherlock’s mobile pinged with a text message as soon as Mycroft pulled onto the highway, and he wrestled it from his coat pocket.
Sherlock could not take it any longer.  Papa was so understanding and Mycroft was so close, and Bunny, sitting watching him from where he’d been helping Papa with the puzzle, had clearly already forgiven his pinching.  He’d spent the entire day lying to them all, and the heavy pull-up between his legs was a sinister reminder of his shortcomings.  Sherlock’s face fell, and he started to cry.
“And Bunny was a mermaid who helped the pirates find the treasure,” he said as he chewed, prompting Mycroft to remind him not to talk with his mouth full.
Very much hope you're all doing well!
Sherlock compromised: he turned to face Mycroft but simply crouched down where he stood at the edge of the lake, eyes turned toward the ground.
There was silence on the other end.
He could tell Sherlock was not any better off than he was; heat was radiating from his big brother’s body from beneath the blankets, and Sherlock’s cough was rough and pitiful.  Willa the Rabbit had fallen onto the floor at some point during the night, but Bunny was too warm and miserable to reach down to get her, although he wanted her desperately.  He wanted his Daddy and his Papa to come and make things right.
“Need you, My,” Sherlock said, feeling a bit vulnerable as his brother failed to drop his professional demeanor.
John climbed up onto his seat and hugged his lion to his chest.
“How can you be sure?” Mycroft asked.  “Isn’t it just as likely that he’s using this as an alternate little personality, as a way to keep from fully finding his true self in headspace?”
“Yes, that’s exactly what I’m going to do,” Mycroft asserted.
“Good to see you, little bro,” another said, wrapping him in a one-armed hug while balancing a wide-eyed toddler on his hip.
Sherlock turned around to face his big brother.
“Mycroft, I--”
“Okay, Daddy,” he said, leaning over to kiss Mycroft, who, after rolling his eyes, kissed him back with a smirk.
five years old.  Sometimes there are voices in your mind that tell you you shouldn’t be five years old.”
P.P.S. Come visit me
“What do you say we get your little bare bum into the tub before your goosebumps get goosebumps?” Mycroft asked.
Greg ignored John’s protests, beginning to pull out of the gas station.  If the kid was upset about even having the suitcase close-by, he must really be fighting against headspace.
It was true.  Greg’s family was not exactly picky when it came to welcoming people into their homes, but they had clearly been enamored with John.  Even if they hadn’t sought Greg out to tell him how wonderful they found the man, he would have known from their eagerness to interact with him, from the stories and jokes they shared with him, the hands clapped on his back when they said their goodbyes.
“What’s that, baby?”
“I told you we didn’t have to reserve this for little space,” he whispered, and then released his bladder, pissing forcefully into his trousers.
Greg surveyed the treehouse, leaned back to observe the height of the four trees at its corners, and then nodded, still smiling.  A moment later he took in a deep breath and held a hand towards John.
Sending you all Bunny kisses :)
“Well chosen,” Mycroft said, a comment John pointedly ignored.
“Sherlock can’t open my presents, Papa!” he said, suddenly animated.  “Santa brought them for
Helping with dinner seemed to be a relative term for the Bunny, who enjoyed pointing to various items whenever Uncle Greg asked “what next?” but otherwise stayed attached to Mycroft with his head against the man’s shoulder.  John was clearly non-verbal at the moment, a stark contrast to the babbling diatribe they could hear from Sherlock in the living room, where the detective narrated dark and detailed storylines of piracy.
He was pleased Sherlock was no longer barricaded inside the bedroom down the hallway, but his nerves had returned when Greg pulled him upstairs and away from his injured brother in order to allow John and Sherlock space to chat.  The pain from Sherlock’s injury had sobered him, but Mycroft had still been able to sense his brother’s pain and anger beneath the surface of calm.
Sherlock let his head fall back against John’s shoulder.
Hi, loves!
“Even if he pees and poops his pants?” Sherlock yawned, clearly fighting sleep once more.
“We’ll never get a taxi otherwise,” Sherlock said, and John acquiesced.
“Because I need you, Daddy,” John said around the thumb he’d slipped into his mouth.  And that would have to be good enough for now.
"Sherlock, I don't have the proper local anesthetics to numb your arm.  You need to be stitched up in at least two places."
“I keep telling you you aren’t letting yourself go deep enough into headspace,” Mycroft said, shaking his head up at John as he acknowledged his shift in mindset.  “Your adult self shouldn’t be this close to the surface all the time.”
Thus began the summer of Mycroft’s strict regimen for toilet training.  He implemented timed trips to the loo and a system where Sherlock earned checks on a chart for every dry morning, afternoon, and evening.  The checks could be converted into trips to the science museum or bike rides with the sports-averse Mycroft.
“No, Daddy!  I’m ‘wake,” Bunny said at once, sitting up and once again rubbing at their eye.  “Wanna movie!”
John blinked up at him.
Greg laughed full from the belly, which set Mycroft laughing as well.  There was comfort in the lightheartedness after the ordeals of the day, knowing the kids were safely asleep upstairs and that he had Mycroft to himself for the moment, the humorous, genuine Mycroft the man only allowed himself to be while alone with Greg.
“I wanna come,” Bunny said, his voice far closer to defiance than usual.  “But I wanna wear jammies.”
As it was, he didn’t have the energy to care that he was being insensitive.  All he knew was that he had tried to be accepting of Bunny but had only become confused.  All he knew was that she had teased him and was telling him what to do, and that he didn’t feel big enough to understand what that meant.
To say that Mycroft had his hands full getting Sherlock to make it through Christmas Day was an understatement.  His little brother had chosen to fight headspace with snarkiness, and was taking out his frustration and lack of confidence on their poor parents.
“So you felt confused because Bunny was acting differently then when he was a boy?” John clarified.
John was almost surprised when Sherlock did as he was told.  He removed Sherlock's coat and cast it onto the back of his chair before carefully rolling the man's blood-stained sleeve to his elbow.
“I know that intellectually, yes.”
“Bun, are you still feeling like a boy, today?” he asked, pausing in the doorway.
The pull-ups rarely held full wettings, and because Sherlock was eager to continue resting with Mycroft, he forced himself to find the older part of himself for just a moment, and stopped the flow of urine before he began to leak into his pants or onto Mycroft’s lap.  He had released enough that he was no longer desperate to go and could simply relax himself against Mycroft, feeling the wet warmth of his pull-up pressed up against him.
But John didn’t have the words to explain that it had all been too much over the past few days, that he still hadn’t had time to process his thoughts from the weekend, that the contrast between the weekend at the lake and being little for so many hours on end and being adult and chasing murderers with Sherlock was too great.  He couldn’t tell Mycroft he’d been fighting to stay fully grown, that he just wanted to cuddle and suck on his pacifier but his adult mind had told him he’d had plenty of that over the weekend and he needed to be big.  He couldn’t put into words the way his relationship with Sherlock felt different, now, that there were unspoken questions and concerns neither of them had found a way to bring up.
John blinked up at him.
He had his Mycroft back, and he planned to keep it that way.
He tried once more to yank his hands from Daddy’s grasp, but Daddy clucked his tongue and tightened his knees around Bunny’s legs to keep him in place.
“I’m wearing a pull-up, Mycroft,” Sherlock whined.  “Isn’t that why you forced me to wear one?”
“Feel a bit better?”
Mycroft had placed himself behind the desk on the far side of the living room, knowing he had correspondence to answer and potential political headaches to keep from coming to fruition.  As much as he would have liked to take off the entire day to care for the boys, he hadn’t properly planned for the boys to be young at the moment, and there were a few loose ends he needed to take care of in order to prepare for the possibility of extended time with them young.
“Yeah,” Bunny said through a yawn, reaching to hold his pacifier in place when it threatened to tip out of his mouth.  “Big boy, Papa.”
He needed to take a shower, to get dressed in dry clothes.  Perhaps cold water would settle him  a bit, ground him back into himself.
Sending love and bunny kisses!
Sherlock groaned.
“Which is unfortunately inevitable,” he said, shifting to allow John to edge his way out from under the soaked bedding and off of the mattress.  “Don’t they have anything better to do with their lives than interfere in ours?”
Sherlock groaned and, stepping across the room, punched the wall.  He grabbed his hand as the pain shot through his fist, cursing and bending over with his hand pressed against his stomach.
Once John was settled into the tub, pushing bath toys down into the water to watch them float back up to the surface, Mycroft turned to help Sherlock undress.  Generally, the boy liked to undress himself, but that afternoon he stubbornly refused to undress without Mycroft’s help, obviously feeling either left out of the attention John had received that day due to his accident or still upset over what he viewed to be the unfairness of his recent time-out.  He stood fiddling with a plastic shark bath toy, making no attempt to undress himself.  When Mycroft guided him by the hips closer to where he kneeled, Sherlock glanced down with a sigh.  Mycroft unbuttoned Sherlock’s trousers and revealed a very wet pull-up.  He said nothing, because Sherlock was very clearly waiting for his reaction and Mycroft did not want to throw the boy into a fit.  Luckily, John was absorbed with the bath toys and did not seem attuned to what was happening next to him.  John would never tease, but if Sherlock even thought John looked at him strangely after an accident, he would strop and complain.
“Goodnight Sherlock,” both Mycroft and Greg said at once.  Then, as if both sharing the same thought: “Goodnight Bunny.”
Mycroft smiled; He would never admit to thinking so, but John would make an adorable little.  The idea had been in his mind since the day Sherlock had shouted that he was a bigger boy than John.  He had done his best to assure the man that he was there for him, although Mycroft had been too cowardly to simply come out and ask the man how he was feeling.  He was forming a bond with the doctor, that was for sure, but Mycroft hesitated when it came to expressing his feelings of mutual friendship for the man.
Mycroft shook his head.
“I’ll be fine,” he said, opening the car door and removing himself from the passenger seat before Greg could pry for further information.
“I think so,” he said.  “I need to talk to Greg, and, as much as I hate to admit it, I probably owe Anderson an apology, but it could have been worse.  In multiple ways.”
Bunny sniffled and knuckled a tear from his eye before it could fall.
Mycroft nodded.
John opened his mouth once more, but she held up a hand to silence him before returning to the trunk at the end of the bunk bed.  She rummaged around until she'd found an old black and white plush dog, which she placed on the mattress beside him before leaning down to kiss his forehead.
John nodded, scooting from the far side of the treehouse to take Greg’s hand.
Bunny took the pacifier from his mouth and let it drop onto the bed next to him.
“Do you remember when we were kids?” he asked, taking a seat on the far end of the couch from Sherlock.  “And you were eight or nine, maybe, and had been invited to a sleepover for some classmate’s birthday?”
Guilt settled deep in the pit of his stomach.  He shouldn’t be lying to Papa, not when all Papa ever tried to do was make him and Bunny happy.  He snuggled close to the man, then remembered that he was wearing a secret pull-up, and shifted his lower half away from Papa’s closeness.  It wasn’t likely the man would have noticed, but Sherlock wanted to be safe.
“Right,” John said, half listening as he read back his last sentence and edited out a misplaced modifier.
The man across from him glanced up with a bit of irritation, not enjoying the fact that John had halted him just as he was beginning to trace the origins of Scotch.
But in order to stay even remotely aged up, he needed a distraction.
“John?” Greg asked, shrugging.  “I think he’s a great caretaker for Sherlock.  That's what I think.”
“He told me, sweetheart, and that wasn’t very nice of him,” Daddy said, guiding the nipple of the baby bottle away from Sherlock’s lips gently.  “Sherlock, can you apologize to your brother for being naughty?”
I will do my absolute best to have the next chapter to you all in a much shorter amount of time!  I'm too tired to respond to comments right this moment, but I promise I will respond tomorrow after getting a bit of sleep :)
Sherlock pitched a fit.  He screamed and yelled and clawed at Mycroft’s hand in an attempt to free himself, even going so far as to lean over and bite the man on the wrist.  Mycroft was speaking calmly yet forcefully, repeating words Sherlock didn’t bother to comprehend as he threw himself onto the ground in tears.  He could still feel Mycroft’s grip around his arm, steady and unwavering, but in a moment it was gone and he instead felt himself lifted from the ground.  He kicked and flailed as he realized Uncle Greg had shown up in time to wrestle him bodily into the lake house, screeching about stupid Mycroft and stupid naps and not having pushed the stupid baby Bunny.
“Let’s have a nice chat,” Mycroft said. “And then we’ll get you to sleep with your brother before nap time’s over.”
Bunny scooted back on the mattress away from Sherlock and glanced down at him with a look Sherlock was too little to understand.  Sherlock fought the urge to yank Bunny back down to lay beside him, where it was comfortable and warm, but even if he couldn’t understand what Bunny was thinking, he could tell that Bunny wanted to tell him something, and Mycroft said he needed to listen whenever someone had something important to say.
Sherlock nodded, eyes closed as if already falling back to sleep, and John sat up to fish around in the nightstand drawer, where he knew Greg had put Sherlock’s favorite pacifier.
John begrudgingly agreed, if only because he could at least find a change of clothes and might even have time to squeeze in a shower between completing what he could only assume would be asinine tasks that Sherlock would expect him to complete without question or hesitancy.
The prospect of Mycroft’s arms around him sounded like the most appealing situation in the world at the moment, and John felt surprisingly as if he might cry from the sheer fact that it was available to him just down the hallway.
Greg had assumed Sherlock would immediately slip down into his youngest headspace after his time-out and the tears of the morning, but it seemed the boy was currently at his usual age of five or six--younger than he had started the morning but still not as young as he had been the day previous.  Greg would need to check with Mycroft regarding what was best to do in the current situation, whether they should encourage the boy to slip younger--as he had expressed wanting earlier that day--or whether they should simply let him be.
“Bun?” Mycroft tried, “Ready to get up and head to the lake house?”
Sherlock scrubbed sleep from the corner of an eye.  He felt a little older than he’d been the night before, somewhere between his youngest self and his usual baseline of seven or eight.  His slightly older headspace meant he was more capable of speech, but it also meant he was more attuned to the frustration he felt over finding only Papa in bed with him.
“Thank you, for, ah...you know, last night,” John said.
Feel free to send along your requests for what you'd like to see next, and don't forget to check out my ficlets/ramblings about Sherlock on my Tumblr,
“He knows better than to lie to me while in headspace,” Mycroft clarified, standing to carry his mug to the kitchen to rinse it out in the sink.  “I just wish I knew whether this was a deliberate request for a spanking or something else entirely.”
“Oops,” Bunny said, pretending it had all been an accident, and his Daddy lifted one eyebrow but turned back to Sherlock, who Bunny could see was getting sleepy.
The fact that Greg had a spare pacifier in the glove compartment that he offered to John as soon as they had turned onto the main road should have soothed him, but instead it set him off into hitching sobs, the dwindling prospect of being found out releasing him from any hold he had on his adult headspace.
“Can you come back right away and then stay with me, Daddy?” he asked, cheeks pinking.
But introducing a sister into the picture--one who, despite Sherlock’s current age would be more often than not the younger sibling to Sherlock, just as Eurus was--had the potential for disaster.  Ageplay was a coping mechanism for Sherlock, a time for him to escape the stress and turmoil of his constantly moving mind.  It was hard enough for Sherlock to allow himself the release of being truly young.  This had the potential to change that, to alter what it was Mycroft and Sherlock had been practicing for essentially all of Sherlock’s life.
Mycroft placed a pot of water onto the stove and set it to begin boiling for the pasta.
“That is precisely what I’m saying,” he said.  “Besides, I can’t risk him...interfering.”
“You can be as young as you’d like this weekend, kiddo,” Greg explained.  “I know it’s been a hard few days.  Let us take care of you, yeah?”
Mycroft cleared his throat and leaned towards Sherlock.  The best case scenario would have been that a false memory would have come to light, some asinine remembrance about the rather unfortunate nanny who had tormented Sherlock with her refusal to leave him be.  But he’d known it was a false hope; his brother was too perceptive to not have ascertained something at least tangentially tied to Eurus.
“Did you bring any pull-ups, kiddo?” he asked, rooting around in Sherlock’s bag.
The confusion John had felt had not dissipated despite his reckless drinking the night before.  The worry and guilt he’d felt when leaving Mycroft’s had returned that morning as he'd stepped from the shower and the reality of the day and their upcoming reconciliation with Mycroft and Greg settled around them.  He could not help but be reminded that it was, after all, his fault that Sherlock had felt compelled to pull himself out of headspace, his fault that Mycroft and Greg had been so on edge.
Mycroft was still standing outside of the bedroom door, then.  Sherlock had no sense of time apart from the level of the rising sun outside his window, and he had never been very skilled at reading anything from the patterns of the natural world; his was an intellect that made great use of technological advances.  He had no space in his mind for that which could easily be determined by the glance of a clock or mobile.  Even so, he assumed it had been at least two or three hours since he had pushed the dresser up against the door to barricade himself inside the bedroom.
“Not over there,” Sherlock said.  “Sit here, with me.”
Silence once more.
Sherlock’s hands were on his waist as John’s mouth found his boyfriend’s, and John could not help but snake his own hand down the front of Sherlock’s trousers, which had now gone cold and clammy.
Mycroft could see when Sherlock’s uncertainty shifted into determination.  His body became still, and he shook his head.
The game was a complicated series of negotiations which involved Sherlock explaining in long detail the rules of the pirate code onboard his ship.  Bunny tried his best to follow along as he was ordered here and there, told what to say and how to act.  They fought against competing pirate crews and rode out a nasty seastorm, but when Bunny pretended they had found mermaids, Sherlock shushed him and told him that hadn’t really happened.
Mycroft took Sherlock to the master bedroom, hoping eventually to get Bunny to nap with Sherlock in the larger bed, where he knew both of his boys would be content and safe, and neither would be alone.  Luckily, two nights of barely any sleep and a younger headspace made for a pliable Sherlock, and it took only a diaper change and a back rub to get Sherlock down for a nap.
“Why don’t you tell me what you want to say to her, and I’ll pass along the message, okay?” John asked.
Mycroft may not have understood Sherlock’s words, but he had caught onto Sherlock’s distress, and despite Sherlock’s feeble protests, he lifted the slighter man into his lap and rubbed his back while he cried.
“I brought my little princess a present for being so brave and honest,” Papa said, lifting her from his lap to place her beside him on the bed.
“Look after him closely,” Mycroft said as his fingers worked methodically and skillfully.  “Get him to stay in the car if you can.  He’s not far from headspace, no matter what he tells you.”
“Sherlock,” Mycroft sighed.  “If you’ve been feeling young, it’s not healthy to keep pushing that away.  We’ve talked about this before.  You can’t keep ignoring what you need.”
Mycroft smiled at the Bunny and signaled for him to close his eyes and tip back his head so he could rinse his hair.  He let Bunny squeeze a bit of shampoo into the palm of Mycroft’s hand before he spoke.
“Bunny’s not entirely okay, no,” he said, continuing to practice transparency.  “She will be, but I think she has some questions that she needs answered before she can feel safe again.”
Sherlock grunted non-committedly, waited for Lestrade to close the door behind him, curled up into a ball on the cot as he shoved his plush toys onto the floor.  He lay with eyes wide open, knowing he would spend the rest of the night awake, adult mind back full-force, flooding his consciousness with worries and self-doubt.
“Sherlock, can we play something else?” Bunny asked after what had felt like hours of playing at pirates.  The shirt Sherlock had told him to wear was itchy, and he was tired of pirating.  The game made his head hurt; there were too many rules he was expected him to remember, and Sherlock kept criticizing him for making mistakes.
Mycroft nodded and guided Sherlock’s pacifier between the boy’s lips.
“I’ll wear one if John does,” he said.  “We’re both just as likely to slip down in mindset, we’ve both been consuming copious amounts of liquids in the past twelve hours.  After all, it is a long car ride in a rental, John.”
But it was clear that, despite the laziness of the day--a laziness Greg and Mycroft had agreed was needed in order to settle the boys into headspace and guide them back into the routine of ageplay after the turmoil of their last extended session--Sherlock was struggling to build up more than a fleeting interest in any of the activities.  Bunny kept pestering him to play, suggesting new games increasingly tailored to Sherlock’s interests--hide and seek, dinosaur attack, pirate ship, scientists--but Sherlock shrugged the younger’s attention away, moody and petulant.
Greg knew he could grab what they needed and be out of the store in twenty or thirty minutes, but he also knew John could benefit not only from the experience in public while little, but also from the time outside of the lake house, which had, over the course of the weekend, definitely become a space where Sherlock’s needs had been put first.  Greg wanted John to feel cared for and looked after as well, and that meant it would be beneficial to take some alone time with the boy.
Sherlock crossed his arms with a huff, twisting from Mycroft to face his window.
Mycroft let Greg take over rationalizing with Sherlock.  It was clear the man was responding with far less stubbornness to Greg’s suggestions.
John shrugged non-committedly, and if they had more time, Mycroft would have pushed to find out exactly what John was feeling at the moment.  As it was, Greg had knocked on the door to ask if they were ready to go, and Mycroft could hear Sherlock whining that he’d been woken up early only to have to wait around for the others to leave.
“Tell me a story, Papa?” Sherlock asked, and from over his other shoulder Greg heard a mumbled “yeah, story, Papa,” from a yawning Bunny.
Sherlock’s nickname had morphed over the past few weeks into an alter-ego of sorts, the name for John when he was little.  Even Mycroft had come to adopt the moniker.
The thought gave him pause, and he sucked in a breath as he began contemplating what would happen if Bunny couldn’t forgive him.  The prospect sent him into a panic.  He loved Bunny; he always had.  He didn’t want this new version of Bunny to change everything he had come to know, but he certainly hadn’t planned to make her sad again or to make her question who she was like he had at the lake house.  Mycroft was always saying he had to think before he acted, and now Sherlock would pay for his stupid impulsivity if Bunny didn't accept his apologies.
John nodded, but was unable to keep from ducking his head, afraid Greg would read into the pink tinge coming to his cheeks when he thought about the fact that he’d been very close to wetting himself, and that his pants weren’t exactly dry beneath his trousers.  He shifted his coat until it covered his lap, afraid the wetness of his pants may seep onto his trousers if he weren't careful.
“You start,” John prompted.  It was a game they played whenever John cared for little Sherlock, one that had begun months ago, on a night John was exhausted from caring for a very needy and mischievous little Sherlock who had not wanted to go to sleep.
That said, it's always bugged me that this story was left incomplete, and I've definitely missed writing fanfiction.  I've taken a stab at writing a new chapter for this story a few times, but it's only in the past two or three days that I've felt I finally have something that I think is okay enough to post.
“Mycroft?” Sherlock asked, sitting up a bit and rubbing the sleepiness from his eyes.
John could tell that Mycroft was analyzing him, deducing his inner conflict and attempting to gauge whether to push him towards a conversation or allow him to process on his own.
Mycroft sighed.  “I wish I could, buddy, but I have an important phone call this morning that I need to be here for.  You can go to the zoo with Sherlock and Uncle Greg, or you can stay here with me and later this afternoon we can go to the park.”
“That will have to be Bunny’s decision, bud,” he said, twisting the top back onto the now-refilled sippy cup after diluting the juice with some water to keep Sherlock’s sugar intake down.  “You just worry about yourself.”
The impulse to rail against Greg’s ministrations was instinctual rather than spiteful, prodding Sherlock into becoming little more than a swearing, glaring lump under the sheets for the better part of the morning.  If he had been a man more prone to processing emotions, he would have identified the impulse to reject care as an avoidance tactic, a way to protect himself from the stress he was feeling about the plans for the week.  As it was, half in headspace and too wrapped up in his own frustration and anger to deduce the origins of his bad mood, he found contentment by residing in irritability.
“I’m fine, Sherlock,” John said, “Nothing’s wrong.  I just woke up because Mycroft and Greg are going to bed.”
They pulled into a service station, Greg stepping out to fill the car with gas while John was sent inside to find the loos.  They weren’t what John would have called clean--Sherlock would have certainly refused to use them, already having a generalized aversion to public loos--but John did not have the luxury of being particular at the moment.
“Sherlock?” he called, sitting up as he rubbed sleepiness from an eye.  “You awake?”
Bunny was sulking in the backseat of Papa’s car, arms crossed and feet perched on the seat so he could press his knees against his chest and make it more difficult for Daddy to fasten his seatbelt.  He had thrown Willa the rabbit into the footwell alongside his cast-away pacifier, and was currently glaring at Daddy, who was climbing into the passenger seat after placing Sherlock and Bunny’s overnight bags into the trunk.
He didn’t want Papa to go.  He wanted him to cuddle him and tell him it was okay to be a little girl today.  Crying made his throat hurt, he couldn’t breathe through his stuffy nose, the tile floor was cold against his thighs and stomach when his nightshirt rode up, and he felt alone and needy.  Everything was just too hard.
“Speak up, brother mine,” Mycroft said, forcing patience.
The boy turned his reddened face towards Greg, who wiped away a few stray tears with his thumbs before leaning to press a kiss to the boy’s forehead.
“Bunny was being bossy,” Sherlock said, unable to keep a bit of defensiveness from his tone.  “She’s not...I mean,
“You should have told me, Bun,” he said, guiding the boy to the toilet at the far side of the bathroom and helping him with his pajama trousers and rather sopping underwear.  “Nothing to be ashamed of.”
Sherlock had tried to speak when they’d reached their flat, tried to provide his own breed of comfort, but John had ignored him, casting the man’s coat off and retreating to his bedroom, where he was currently huddled beneath the blankets in nothing but a t-shirt and his soaked briefs, pushing away the encroaching thoughts that his thumb might provide him a bit of comfort, that his plush rabbit was only a few steps away, closed in the closet.
Greg smiled, kissed him again, and then held out the Santa hat he’d taken off before heading into Mycroft’s office.
“John,” Greg began.  “We’ve got this covered. You don’t need to--”
When he didn’t see her, he took out his mobile to give her a call, not particularly surprised when she didn’t answer.  She often made large-scale plans for themed dinner parties and multi-course meals when company was visiting, and although she rarely pulled them off without John or someone else stepping in to take over the multitude of steps she had forgotten, it was endearing that she made the effort.  He left a quick message, telling her he had arrived and would be waiting whenever she’d finished seasoning whatever ridiculous dish she’d chosen to serve alongside the overly decorative desserts.
“I think you and Mycroft should have a nice chat tomorrow, hm?” Greg asked when Sherlock had calmed a bit.  “Your brother loves you more than anything, bud.”
They had spent their evening without children discussing the circumstances surrounding Mycroft’s worry, and although he had not told Greg everything--leaving out the fact that Eurus was alive and utilized for the government’s gain from time to time--Mycroft had discussed the Holmes children’s childhood in far greater detail than he’d ever hoped would be required.
He pulled his hand away and cleared his throat once more.
“If you don’t understand how your behavior impacted others this morning,” Mycroft said, quirking an eyebrow at the kid, “then maybe I need to lengthen that time-out significantly.”
Sherlock yawned, and Mycroft knew the boy would not have patience for the conversation much longer.
And then, voice no-nonsense once more in order to provide the boy with the structure he so desperately needed: “Alright, into the corner to think about what you’ve done.”
John cried because he wanted Mycroft.  But he also cried because Uncle Greg was being so nice to him, and wasn’t judging him, and didn’t mind that he had yelled, and had let him choose dinner, and had put out his lion, and didn’t seem to think he was a baby even after he had more than likely seen his pacifiers and could see how much John liked his new baby bunny blanket.  And he knew he shouldn’t want Mycroft when Uncle Greg was doing just about everything right. But he did.  He wanted him more than perhaps he ever had, and that hurt.
“We’ll see,” he said.  “But now, it’s time for bed.”
As soon as Sherlock was carried upstairs and placed onto his bed, however, his eyes fluttered open in confusion, and, seeing that he was no longer being held, he began to cry.  Mycroft shushed him and quickly gathered Sherlock back into his arms, but after such a jarring wake-up, Mycroft knew that any attempt to get Sherlock back to sleep would prove futile.
But it seemed Sherlock’s sleepy complacency had dissipated, for as soon as Daddy turned the channel away from the dinosaurs, Sherlock broke down.
Sherlock nodded and made his alligator walk up to Mycroft’s shoulder.  “His name is Greg,” Sherlock giggled.  “Uncle Greg named him.” He clacked his own teeth together as he made the alligator's mouth open and close in front of Mycroft’s face, then jumped out of Mycroft’s lap to bounce over to Lestrade, who was leading John by the shoulder as they entered the kitchen.
“I’m afraid not, bud.”
Papa sighed and Bunny was passed from Daddy’s arms into Papa’s.  Bunny whined a bit, wanting his Daddy, but he was soon snuggled up in his Papa’s grasp and content enough to close his lips around his thumb and rest his head on Papa’s shoulder, simply pleased to have the comfort.  He didn’t want to have to take care of himself today, not while feeling so sick.  Papa rested his hand on Bunny’s forehead, testing his body temeprature just as Daddy had earlier.
This chapter took an interesting few turns that I wasn't expecting, so I'll be interested to hear your thoughts.  I've been in a strange mindset myself for the past week or so, so I think that may have impacted the writing this time around.
“Can you take his temperature and give him some pain medicine for his head and throat?” Daddy asked.  “I’ll check on Sherlock.”
“You’ve got a point there, kiddo,” Uncle Greg said, and Bunny bounced because Uncle Greg's body shook with his laugh.
“I was mad at you,” Sherlock said with a shrug.
“Even if you hadn't been in headspace," Mycroft assured him, "there’s nothing to be upset about.  It happens.  If anyone saw you it's likely they assumed you were sick, as you would assume if you saw another man wet his pants in public.”
Sherlock shrugged and wiped at his eyes, pulling absentmindedly at the fur on Dimitri’s tail.  He wasn’t sure where to begin.  He was guilty about peeing his pants and nervous about the training chart and hungry from refusing to eat all of his lunch, not to mention still feeling awkward in headspace, self-conscious and feeling like he was taking up too much space.
Bunny was blinking up at Sherlock, clutching his plastic mermaids in his hands.
“Go away,” he sneered as he crossed to sit in the chair at the opposite end of the table from Mycroft.
“William Sherlock Scott,” Mycroft boomed.  “Come here right now.”
Sherlock took a bite of salad and then, after he made a face, spit it back onto his plate.
He’d been doing well.  He’d had days when the depression threatened to overwhelm him, when it stifled the positive thoughts and left him huddled and alone even when he had company.  But he hadn’t hurt himself, not in months.  Mycroft had been keeping tabs, checking when he thought Sherlock wasn’t looking.
Sherlock had been ready for a tantrum all morning.  Uncle Greg had been able to prevent them so far--making Sherlock toast when he refused to eat the cereal Mycroft placed on the kitchen table, suggesting the compromise of Wellies and a sweatshirt when Sherlock refused to wear the jacket Mycroft held out to him before their trip outside in case the rain came earlier than forecasted--but Uncle Greg had needed to take a phone call from work, and there was no one to stop Sherlock from pitching a royal fit over the idea of being forced into time out and then forced into taking a nap if Mycroft were to force the issue.
