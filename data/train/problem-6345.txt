It took several moments of gasping for his breathing to resemble normal again, and his sight to slowly make sense again. The details in front of him were blurry, but coming back like a camera being brought into focus. Steve was right there in his face. “Oh god,” he managed before pushing the man away and heaving. Stomach emptied, he laid back and promptly passed out.
Steve remarked lightly. He wasn’t worried. Tony hadn’t gotten too drunk since they’d gotten engaged. The genius seemed to only get past buzzed when he was upset or depressed.
- the tendency to sin innate in all human beings, held to be inherited from Adam in consequence of the Fall. The concept of original sin was developed in the writings of St. Augustine.
When a client asks Jessica Jones to find her missing husband, she thinks it's just another Tuesday. There was no way for her to know her investigation would lead her to a serial killer.
Of course the thought had floated through his mind before he could stop it. Bad thing always happened when he thought that. As if on cue, his periphery caught a figure standing off the side of the road, barely noticeable outside of the streetlight’s beam. It was probably a child given the stature, and they looked cold and alone. Tony lamented the loss of his solitude as he pulled up beside them.
Thor was next, followed by Natasha and Phil, and lastly Bruce. They all woke to the smell of bacon and eggs wafting through the tower. Steve had cooked up a large feast, knowing he wouldn’t be the only one who would awaken hungry.
This time, he blamed Pepper. He really, really did. And of all months to get kidnapped, October was really the most inconvenient, he had so much work to do. Couldn’t villains at least try to schedule things around his life? November. November would be a great month to get kidnapped, Tony decided. No big SI commitments, no holidays he cared about, the weather wasn’t great…
He took off without looking back. Clint would not last long and there were a lot of bots left. Doom’s weapon also looked nearly completed. This couldn’t be how the Avengers went down, not to Doom of all people. They’ve fought much stronger. Tony needed to end this
Tony snorted, and Steve was so thankful to have him back. That sobbing shell of pure pain had not been his husband.
The archer shook his head in disbelief, returning to his work. When Tony put it that way, it seemed almost logical, but Tony always managed to make crazy things sound logical. The man had burned himself with sparks from a device he needed to live like the risk was a non-factor. He was bringing this up next time Cap or Phil tried to harass him for being reckless. Tony made him look like the most cautious man alive. He decided to put the image of Tony pulling out the reactor out of his head. It was playing over and over in his mind, and Clint wouldn’t have thought he’d be so affected by a simple action like that, but to him it had looked akin to someone stabbing themselves or something. And that was his friend, his family member. All of the Avengers probably subconsciously equated the blue light in Tony’s chest with him being alive.
Tony almost wished the man would go back to avoiding his gaze, because those puppy dog eyes filled him with guilt.
Frank, Lisa, and Frank Jr. settled into their usual balcony seats. It had become a comfortable routine, coming for years. The children behaved, even though they got bored, and often fell asleep before the show was over. Frank had no problems taking care of the children, it didn’t matter what the other men said about him being whipped. His children were just as much his world as Maria was, and he loved to take care of them. Life seemed like a dream compared to the lonely nightmare he had been living before Maria. He couldn’t have imagined how well it would turn out. This was the matinee, so Frank knew the story already. He knew exactly when his wife should have entered the stage.
That was what brought Tony and Bruce here now, test tubes of their own collecting samples as well as large bags to pack away and tools they wanted and snapping photos of what they couldn’t carry with them. A lot of the objects reminded Tony of Chitauri technology crossed with Asgardian tools. He couldn’t pinpoint what exactly led him to believe that; he would have no way of pointing to any one trait that made him think of aliens and Asgardians, but it was currently a working theory.
Natasha walked in first, the other Avengers filing in behind them, bringing some more chairs. Everyone looked like they hadn’t slept much either, though probably more than Steve. Natasha handed him a Stark tablet pulling a chair up beside him. At Steve’s questioning look, she explained,
Agent Coulson was looking down at Tony from behind the kneeling Captain. Tony saw the gratefulness in the man’s eyes and it had all been worth it. He was on a stretcher and Steve wasn’t pulled away. Tony finally let his eyes slide shut, and the world went black.
Wade said quickly, leading the way in the same direction they had been walking for what seemed like forever.
Steve tried the same, and when Tony mouthed another phrase, instead of Steve needing to read his lips, the words appeared before his eye. The screen was only holographic, and he could still see the outside world beyond the glowing blue words.
Steve stared at the genius in shocked horror. What was he talking about? He caught Tony when his eyes rolled backward and he crumpled suddenly.
Norman wouldn’t let him escape that easily. He knew Tony could handle plenty more abuse before he had to worry about the man dying on him. He’d get his information.
He rubbed the offending shoulder as he stretched it. Steve was grateful that the makeshift knapsack fit around him, though it was tight. He had a broader chest than Tony. Tony looked up at the tree above him thoughtfully.
He watched Schmidt turn away from him. The man began pacing slowly, his hands behind his back. It reminded Dracula of what he used to do when deep in thought, back when he was human and felt a need to move about. That was a long time ago, and now he often sat still as a statue while he pondered existence.
And Dracula was holding him with one hand wrenching his head to the side, mouth wide and ready to sink his veins into Steve’s neck. The whole thing had happened so fast, Steve wasn’t sure when they had ended up right next to Tony.
She cursed? It sounded to Tony like the tone someone usually used when saying a curse word, so he could only assume it was a word that had no english translation.
The unibeam wasn’t as bright or powerful as usual, but it did the trick. Tony kept at it until all of the children were through.
Steve said confidently. Tony put his faceplate back down. Steve knew him too well at this point for Tony to hide his anxiety from his expressions. If it took about half his power to get here, the battle better be quick.
Tony was laughing and enjoying himself again, previous conversation with the Lieutenant long forgotten. He handed the ring over and the two started gushing about Steve’s taste. Steve was still thinking about the previous conversation, so he was a little startled when the two of them were looking at him expectantly.
Taking everything in stride as usual, Phil just raised an eyebrow, looking down at his inebriated friend. Tony saw the way his lips twitched, though, and he grinned, victorious. An almost smile! That was basically the equivalent of a guffaw from Phil Coulson.
Slowly being bled to death was not one of the ways Tony wanted to go out. Maybe an explosion, or some kind of disintegration ray, something cool, but not bleeding out. It sounded terrifying; there was far too much time to contemplate the coming death.
Tony blinked. Xavier had been in his head? Saw all of, well, that pain? God, no wonder Steve looked so stricken. He couldn’t imagine what it must sound like explained allowed. Hopefully Professor X had been skimpy on the details.
They sat in silence for a long moment, each looking up at the lunar eclipse and thinking about different things, but all about family. Peter let out a soft sigh.
The man fired and an EMP hit Tony, shutting down the suit and the arc reactor immediately. The searing pain ripped through his chest as the shrapnel started moving again.
cutting right to Tony’s core. That was the problem when someone knew you as well as Ty knew him, they could use your fears and weaknesses against you.
The walk back the next morning was slow. Tony had to take a few breaks, but these injuries were child’s play for them. They were still able to joke around and have fun while they walked.
Clint shrugged. It was something he had definitely thought about, but he preferred to deal with problems as they came. Tony was the one always stuck in the possible futures.
He placed a hand on Bruce's head and closed his eyes. From what Clint could tell it looked like they both entered some sort of trance, but their hair started to defy gravity. It only lasted about a minute and Bruce's eyes snapped open.
Strange looked off into the distance for a moment, seeming to decide something, then looked back at Steve, his expression suddenly blank.
Clint's breath caught. How many times was he going to have to have magical people in his head? His experience with Loki still felt like a raw wound. He nodded his understanding anyways with the others. What choice did he actually have?
But Tony wasn’t conscious anymore. Steve couldn’t do anything besides lower him to the ground and move any objects away when the seizure started.
Tony’s bright and cheery voice entered the kitchen. He had just come from the lab. Steve watched his boyfriend cross the room with a skip to his step. The man didn’t even reach for the coffee, pulling out orange juice out of the refrigerator instead. Steve narrowed his eyes. Something was definitely up.
he replied dizzily. Tony teased at his tip with his tongue, and Steve hissed. His hips bucked before he could stop them, but Tony smirked up at him, victorious. He had Steve at his mercy in five minutes tops every time.
Bruce just nodded in amazement, looking at Doctor Strange. Steve and Strange were looking at him expectantly, though, so he sighed.
Tony wasn’t sure how to take the way Steve’s face crumpled, and the fact that his head was suddenly laying against Tony’s head while he cried. So Tony just played with Steve’s hair and waited. He knew what being the one waiting beside a hospital bed felt like. Eventually, Steve came back to himself.
Steve’s eyes snapped open and he looked a little out of it for a moment. Then he turned to look at Clint, taking in Clint’s expression. He nodded and carefully climbed out of bed, following Clint to the kitchen. When Steve sat down, Phil set down coffee for each of them.
His hand met the end of the bed. He wasn’t in his bed. Tony sat up, blinking when the harsh hospital fluorescents assaulted him. Right, the drugs.
Tony and Steve hadn’t succeeded in their nap either. Dr. Strange studied each of the Avengers like they were interesting paintings, and the room was awkwardly quiet. Tony refused to believe that Strange didn’t make everyone uncomfortable on purpose. He saw through it. Stephen Strange acted just a bit odder and just a bit more mysterious than he actually was so people would let him stay isolated. That was Tony’s hypothesis anyway; it was similar enough to Tony’s antics when he didn’t want people getting close. He had yet to have the chance to test the hypothesis (his plan was to get the sorcerer drunk).
How was he supposed to respond to that? These two were idiots when it came to dating and communication, so he always had to step in before they made too big of a mess because he cared about them. He had somehow become their go to advice person on relationship matters which was just nuts considering he had no one. But this? No one could possibly answer that. He had no answers. He’d give anything to be able to look Steve in the eye and say ‘no, it won’t be. This is the last time,’ but he can’t. There’s no way to know that and statistically speaking it’s improbable. He slowly sank into the chair opposite Steve.
Tony’s mouth twitched as he watched his brilliant son expertly diffuse a situation. How had he gotten lucky enough to meet a kid like this, and for the kid to choose him as a father?
he blurted out. It was utterly insane. Of course Tony hadn’t thought of that! The fake phobia had been going on before they had even started the prank competitions. He suddenly felt much better about the whole thing. His observation skills and planning wasn’t at fault, Clint was just insane.
Tony didn’t ask questions. If JARVIS felt the need to alert him, it wasn’t just a minor injury. The elevator was fast enough to throw him off balance but he remained upright. When he arrived, Natasha and Clint weren’t far behind. The scene in front of him didn’t make sense. Steve was sitting against the mirror, chin against his chest, clearly unconscious. Behind him, Tony could make out the blood smeared on the wall from his head.
he pulled them into his arms so he could walk quicker. At least he was strong enough to still lift the both of them. He descended the staircase swiftly, scanning the lobby. There was an usher at the closed door, and a guard at the external door.
He sounded so heartbroken and guilty, how could Tony not spill every secret he'd been holding thus far? Tony expected to be pushed away, ignored and left to die. But, instead, he was hugged tighter and pulled closer. At first, he didn't understand the apologies that spilled from Rhodey's lips, but when he did he wriggled far enough away to look at his face.
Which was fine, really, Tony was not desperately missing the tower and his friends. He didn’t need to see Steve in the flesh just to breathe sometimes. The fact that the team was doing missions without him didn’t send him into panic attacks or anything. He only had two more countries to visit anyway. He’d be warm in bed with the love of his life soon, he kept reminding himself.
he patted the bed beside him, scooting over. Steve climbed in, wary of the man’s wound that he definitely hadn’t noticed yet. Tony hummed, nuzzling into Steve’s neck.
He gave his wrists a tug, testing the strength of the rope and knots that had his arms tied behind the hard wooden chair. Not much give there. He tried to move his legs against the ropes, only to realize his legs were actually being held together and to the chair by a metal contraption. The cold metal against his legs with only his slacks in between was a surprise, and it brought him more completely out of his stupor.
Kimmel clearing his throat startled them both back to reality. Steve blushed a deep scarlet that matched his tie, and Tony smirked at how swollen his lips looked.
Tony pushed the lava cake around his plate, watching it slide in a fudge trail. Steve knew he hadn’t really touched his meal either. Finishing his own slice of pie, he leaned forward to catch Tony’s attention.
They watched the words appear on the screen. Tony made another motion and pointed to each of them in the room, making keyboards for each of them.
Steve tried his best to lower Tony gently until he was prone. They kept the broken limbs propped up in their odd angles with pillows, but there was no way it was comfortable. The distinct lack of medical staff made it surreal. Tony was hooked up to monitors, but nothing to fix anything. Steve sat down in the plastic chair to the left of the bed, holding Tony’s hand. His phone buzzed in his pocket.
The last goon went down, and Tony’s landing was rough, as he took a knee immediately. How many times had he been hit. He lifted the faceplate as the woman approached him.
Of all things to cross Steve’s mind, he was thinking about how much Tony hated other people to see his chest. It was a useless thought. Phil had never wished more that he knew anything about the medical field besides first aid. Clint ignored the pain in his side as he sat up to look across the room. Phil glared at him, but he didn’t care. He needed to see his friend still breathing after that. He had just been thinking about how he might prefer being in the hospital while Tony was stuck there too, but then things had gone to shit so quickly.
With Tony sitting in a bed in medical, broken leg stretched out in front of him as he leaned against Steve, a medical doctor, Doctor Strange, and Wanda Maximoff were standing in the doorway.
he sounded desperate. Tony stood and brushed himself off, motioning for the sorcerer to join him on the couch. Perhaps this was a dream. It was definitely strange enough. Ha. Strange.
Something is living in the basement. The problem was, Tony couldn’t figure out what. The tower’s basement was just one large room housing the giant arc reactor that powered it, and Tony’s emergency backup arc reactors. No one could even access the basement without being Tony. JARVIS had bio scanners and everything. So how in the world was something living in the basement?
she commented as Thor entered the room. Natasha always took a keen interest in Thor’s fashion, so she noticed any tiny changes in his everyday appearance. One of her favourite pastimes was playing dress up and makeover with Thor, partially because he was the only one who let her, and partially because it was just so entertaining. His massive demigod body managed to look good in everything from speedo to ballgown. It was also no secret that his hair was the most luscious of the group, which allowed for a myriad of experimentation for style.
look, and it wasn’t helping. The one that said ‘oh, poor Tony, the freak.’ This was his family of freaks, he wasn’t supposed to feel like this here. He thought this group was finally a place he could feel like he always belonged.
Tony took another look at the roaring beast, his quiet and meek friend transformed beyond recognition, and had a sinking suspicion that Hulk would have no trouble crushing the armour like aluminum foil if he really wanted.
Peter tried to make his voice deep. Tony’s grin was so wide it hurt. They were all laughing silently, watching the scene unfold. Peter was so cute it was hard to remember the subject matter.
The slight rustle in the leaves above Clint only happened during a breeze, so he thought nothing of it. Just once, he heard a sudden rustling noise, but when he looked up, a bird was flying away into the night. There was no reason to expect anyone out here. It was an impromptu trip. So when the branch just behind him made a cracking noise, he moved on instinct, decades of training taking over in an instant.
Clint asked, herding them into the portal. Strange nodded, and he closed his eyes. The portal began shrinking.
He had to believe that. Mr. Doll still wanted the money, right? He wouldn’t get it if he killed Tony.
Phil stood alone in the room, letting the day wash over him. He understood what Clint was going through, how terrified he was of losing any of the Avengers, though he’d never admit it. Clint’s real family had never really been there for him, and the first couple months at the tower, Clint closed himself off to avoid getting close to anyone. These people were the only people who have ever cared for him; watched his back; could be trusted. He knew that Clint was furious at the fact that he couldn’t help right this very instance, so he had to get some of that frustration out. He’d be alright when he came home to collapse next to Phil tonight.
he kissed Tony again, savoring the coffee taste. Tony returned to the news on the tablet in front of him, holding out his empty mug towards Steve. Steve shook his head fondly as he refilled the coffee before moving to make his second breakfast.
Luckily, Tony was able to stand in the shower while Clint scrubbed him, and held himself steady against the wall. He followed Clint’s commands silently, looking more and more exhausted by the second. When Clint finally got him into bed, he curled up into a tight ball and groaned.
It's about time we made it to the evil mastermind of the whole fic. TW for torture in this chapter, but I don't think it's super graphic. If you have specific torture triggers you want to avoid like method-wise, you can ask me in the comments and I'll let you know specifics, just don't want to spoil it for everyone else.
Clint never took it personally, their relationship was fine as it was. Friendly rivalry and casual fun defined most of it, but they both knew they’d do anything for each other.  And if he was being honest with himself, he wasn’t sure he wanted a Tony Talk. There’s no way he would escape without revealing himself as well, and there was a reason only Nat and Phil really knew him. Giving people your trust was a very dangerous game. Whenever he thought about trying to be more open, Barney’s face haunted his dreams to remind him that even your brother can turn on you.
Please comment with your thoughts on the existence of Bigfoot, or any other cryptids for that matter. I love cryptid talk.
This is a "let's deal with everyone else before we can get back to Tony" chapter. I love writing everyone as important characters in this big family, but it is hard to balance so many characters in one fic. I didn't want the whole thing to be Tony, Tony, Tony just because I love him so much. They're all SO important to me.
Welcome to the beginning of things going wrong. I used one of my fave marvel villains here, but he's not in the movies, so if you really want to know more about him and you don't read comics, you can look up his Wiki. It's not really important, I just love him.
Natasha was nodding in agreement. Tony thought it was just because the two of them were buddies, so she always sided with him.
Said minions backed off, whining like scolded dogs as they left the room altogether, the ones still standing. Strange made a flinging motion, and Nightmare landed in the throne, hard, but he didn’t seem able to stand back up. Strange must have saved up just enough power to defeat the demon, not counting on Morgana making him more powerful, because the sorcerer suddenly slumped, falling through the air. Tony dove, catching him just in time before he hit the ground.
The ride to the hospital was excruciating. He fidgeted, knowing that they couldn’t move any faster. Natasha handed him a tissue and Steve stared at it, confused. She sighed and gently used it to wipe away the tears he didn’t know were there. He gripped Bruce’s hand, probably too hard, but Bruce didn’t mention it.
She handed one over, watching carefully. He silently handed her each part, focusing on the task at hand. It took longer than it should, because his hands were shaking and his vision was blurring at the edges. He could hear his own breathing getting harsher, but she thankfully didn’t point it out.
Of course, all trips end one way or another, don’t they? He knew it wouldn’t have been easy, but damn. The wizard and Tony had made an okay team and made a good plan with the space team. It was all following the plan until Quill was punching Thanos and who was this Gamora? When it fell apart, Tony was left with a bleeding side and no idea what had happened. The wizard had given the stone up for Tony, and he looked over at Strange. Strange refused to look at him instead of staring up at the sky. Peter’s as confused as everyone, and he looks to Tony for guidance. It was quiet, which was why it was even worse when everyone slowly went up into dust. He was alone, with his kids ashes in his arms, and his last words echoing in his ears.
James Barnes sitting in the middle of Tony's workshop. Why was it always Tony? He tapped his desk, cast a glance to the monitor that showed him his lab, and looked around the room. For whatever reason, there was a dead man in his lab, who'd done something to Jarvis because so far Jarvis hadn't responded to him. He'd wondered if he should call someone, but Barnes hadn't done anything yet and Tony may be a genius but he did dumb things. So, he went down and oh boy was it a good choice.
Tony found himself in the doctors the very next day, first thing in the morning when it was practically empty. Jarvis's hand was steady on his shoulder, warming his body from the lack of both his mother and father. They'd said they were too busy, but he knew they were disappointed in him, they always were. But, the doctor said nothing and Tony was escorted into the room. When he left, the awe he had when he thought of Captain was no more. It was more of an empty feeling like something should be there, and as the years continued it was only filled with negative emotions. His father spent the rest of his time avoiding Tony and mentioning the Captain near him. The second his father had the chance, Tony was shipped away to MIT four years later. Tony couldn't blame him, especially when new flowers threatened to choke him. When they died, he could only mourn the people he wished they'd have been.
He starts waking up in the morning and taking an experimental breath before anything. So, it's no surprise to him when one day he wakes up and it feels like something is stuck in his cavity. It feels like someone just signed a death sentence for him - but it's not surprising. Because, when Tony thinks about it, he doesn't want to get rid of the flowers. He can't tell Rhodey - he's turning eighteen soon and Tony won't put that on him no matter how much he wants to - but he doesn't want to lose it either. Plus, he's kind of fond of the bloody Alstroemeria and Chrysanthemums he coughs into a tissue whenever Rhodey worries over him.
The first time Tony saw Hanahaki - believe it or not - was from his father. He was the epitome of steel, unmoving and harsh even to his own son. In front of the camera, he was a perfect father and loving husband, but he was the opposite at home. Maria and Howard rarely spent time with each other let alone their son. Of course, that didn't stop Tony from trying to get their attention when he grew older. Instead, he was taken care of by Jarvis and kept busy. It was a shock when Tony stumbled upon his father in the lab at four years old. He wasn't supposed to be there in the first place after he'd broken something important when he was a baby, and Howard had lashed out. Small bloody footprints were left after him as he stumbled across flowers stripped Carnations and Daisies - following the sound of choking. The closer he got the more he grew scared, but even when Tony was little he didn't let fear stop him. Howard was doubled over a file - Steve's file he found out later on - coughing up blood and beautiful flowers.
In came Thanos - Tony hates being right, he hates the way his chest constricted out of panic and fear at the sight of the aliens. Everything was falling apart, and he didn’t even have the fucking guts to call Steven Rogers. How pathetic was he?Pathetic enough to not realize just yet, that the kid would get involved. Pathetic enough that he couldn’t even send the kid home properly. If he died, it’d be on Tony and Tony’s well aware of this. Looking at the kid with fear, worry, and everything in his chest hurt. But, the longer he looked the more he saw himself in the kid and he finally realized what type of love the flowers in his chest were for. The relief crashed with new horror, and he didn’t want to see the outcome of this trip.
It was bad luck and irony that had him develop Hanahaki for the same man as his father, only four years later. Tony grew up on stories of Captain America from his father. Stories of his bravery and how Tony was unbelievably different from him. It was the only time his father spent any time with him, and Tony would take those few moments. Even when he turned on Tony and spoke of how much better Steve was. Even if Tony was only eight, and nowhere near a grown man. There was jealousy, but there was also the great feeling of awe.
It took Rhodey to convince Tony to get rid of the flowers, it was always Rhodey. He'd come in when Bruce and Tony were discussing something in great length. Tony didn't know what had set Rhodey off: maybe it was Tony's hand movements as he spoke or the light in his eyes, maybe it was the way Tony looked after Bruce even as Bruce turned away to busy himself, or maybe it was the peak of a bloody handkerchief hanging out the back of Tony's pocket. Whatever it was, he pulled Tony to the side and held his arms as he looked into Tony's eyes. It was the same look he'd had when Tony had flowers for him - hurt and worrying swirling around in them and...disappointment. That's all Tony seemed to do.
When a child is born, every parent is given a warning and a pamphlet. Children are naive and fickle, especially when it comes to things like love. Due to this, they are extremely vulnerable to Hanahaki Disease. Parents are warned to watch their children closely - and monitor crushes they develop. It's recommended to make sure it remains that way - simply crushes. Children can't properly reciprocate love, the only option is to remove it with surgery if it develops.
A new horror, because that was his mom and dads car driving down that street. Then, that was Bucky's arm around his
Tony figures when his dad ships him off to MIT - Tony can't blame him, at this point he wants to be rid of himself - that he'll be fine. After all, in a highly sought after school with kids older than him, who's there to fall in love with? He gets roomed with a seventeen-year-old named James - he nicknames him Honeybear to be an ass but seems he's gotten used to it. Everything, or as everything as it can get for Tony, is going fine.
But, then a jet was crashing into the helicarrier, there was yelling and roars and rage, so much rage. There was no time for Tony to think about what he wanted to do with his flowers. He was fighting, gods suddenly existed in the world, and now he was standing in front one.
throat - an arm he'd touched and edited himself in the comfort of his home. Yes, Barnes was his quickest flower yet. He'd choked and coughed, smacked Steve's hand away, and spit the flower up in front of both of them. Guilt and sadness were painted on Steve's face, and anguish on Barnes's because he knew. But, none of that mattered because that was his mom and Steve knew.
So, he starts doing his best to watch after Tony without risking his grades. Honestly, Tony appreciates it and absolutely hates it at the same time. He knows he's in danger when his heart flutters when Rhodey throws a smile his way. It's dangerous and reckless to keep going this way, but distancing himself won't help. Either way, close to Rhodey or not, he's in danger. The first time he slipped under Rhodey's radar, he found himself cornered in an empty classroom. If he went back to the door that afternoon with a limp and bruises, who's fault was it but his own? It only takes a few more incidents like that, before a few worried and confused looks from Rhodey, drew him right back.
He was more cautious with Bruce after that, even if he knew the flowers couldn't grow back after being coughed up. Bruce came back to the tower after Tony invited him back - guilt, hate, and shame burned in his veins when Bruce looked happy to see him. They went back to their routine, even if things weren't the same. Sometimes the conversation would trail off, glazed over eyes would wander to the other as they thought, and touch was limited. It was for the best, at least that's what he believed until he walked in on Bruce coughing bloody Gladioluses onto the floor. He'd tried to help but:
The email would’ve slipped through the cracks if Tony hadn’t told JARVIS to monitor for every single phrase that could possibly be construed as a threat. The email address that sent it was a meaningless string of characters, and the subject was an inconspicuous
Steve’s voice was getting louder and he had to reign it in. He hadn’t meant for that to come spilling out.
he realized. God, he was ashamed to be called a genius. How had he not thought about the the big electromagnet embedded in his chest. Of course it was pulling the bullet.
A gun shot rang out, and everyone spun to see the new arrival. Phil was standing in the doorway to the gym, eyes wide and gun pointing at Thor. His bags were beside him on the floor, indicating he had just arrived. The bullet bounced uselessly off of Thor’s skin, leaving only a shallow mark.
Tony waited to make sure he was finished. He had never really thought about it that way. He was so used to these threats, had been getting them since the kidnapping started when he was a small child, that they had come to all seem trivial to him. Attempting to see it through Steve’s eyes, Tony would also never forgive himself if Steve kept a death-threat from him then ended up dead. He’d spend eternity wondering if he could have stopped it. He pat his leg to indicate for Steve to sit in his lap. As usual, the man rolled his eyes, scooped Tony up, sat down, and kept Tony in his lap instead. One of these times, Tony was hoping Steve would be distracted and would let Tony be the one on bottom. Sure Steve weighed more, but Tony was far too curious as to what would happen.
Tony finished, closing in on MODOK, dodging his blasts. He fired a small missile, knowing it would miss but definitely get his attention.
That was a good question. So many things and nothing at all. He wanted to drink himself to sleep, shoot until his fingers bled, sit at Tony’s bedside, have passionate, rough sex, and also sit and stare at a wall doing absolutely nothing. He looked up in surprise when he felt Phil tugging his arm.
The portal Loki opened beneath them, with no warning, dropped them from above ground. The god of mischief looked very pleased with himself as everyone picked themselves off the ground, grumbling.
Steve laughed. Peter was blushing now, but happy the night had turned around again. They ate and talked, and Tony played catch the grapes with Peter while Steve judged. It was a good night. Tony decided he should look into more astronomy excuses to take his family on night time picnics. Getting away from the tower was good for them.
he whispered in Steve’s ear before going back to his dinner as though nothing had happened. Steve might just pass out from how red he was getting. Tony tried to keep his expression innocent, only grinning in victory inside his head.
Clint agreed but he waited for what Tash had to say. She always had better ideas than he did. She stood quietly for a moment before giving a slight nod and sitting right there on the floor.
Steve chuckled as he popped the rest of the piece into his mouth. The pieces were only about the size of Tony’s palm, but they were quite dense. They really were very good. They finished them off pretty quickly, washing down the stickiness with gulps of hot chocolate. Steve was actually surprised when he reached into the box but there were none left.
Tony had a lot of experience with being captured and tortured unfortunately. He was kidnapped a few times as a child, a side effect of being the child of a famous billionaire. Then there was the kidnapping in Afghanistan which was done by this guy’s men, so what’s the worst that could happen?
Jessica Jones should’ve known things were too easy when the trail of evidence was so obvious. It started as a simple missing person’s case, the usual ‘oh please I haven’t seen my husband in days’ sort of thing that nearly always turned out to be a cheater run off with the mistress.
he trailed off into a mumble at Steve’s look. Right, not the time. He was too exhausted to be thinking clearly in his defense, and seeing Dr. Stein had caught him off guard.
When Tony finally woke a day later, he was afraid to open his eyes. He assumed he was still in the Mandarin’s mansion, and maybe if the Mandarin thought he was unconscious, he’d stop hurting Tony. The longer he was awake, the more aware he became of the sounds around him, though, and those included the familiar sounds of a breathing machine. So he was in medical. He slowly opened his eyes, and luckily the lights were dimmed. He hated waking to bright, fucking white lights. He slid his eyes to the right and saw Steve, watching him carefully. God, the bags under Steve’s eyes. At least he wasn’t a block of ice.
She pulled a knife out from one of her sheaths and pressed it to his throat, but not drawing blood just yet.
Okay, Steve breathed. This would work. He would give himself up and Dracula would give up Tony. Then Vision could get Tony to a hospital quickly, while the others saved Steve. It would be risky, but it would work.
They practiced for hours. Tony was surprisingly promising for a novice, but he struggled to hold the arrow back without shaking, which made aim difficult.
Tony Stark was a madman. Clint couldn’t believe he was only just now finding out. They had lived together and worked together for years, but he had never imagined how mad the genius was.
Clint could understand the reaction. This random stranger was talking about mind magnets and knew their names. Plus she may have just found out that her roommate was actually an intergalactic hero.
Tony put the car in park, and made sure to make his moments slow as he exited the vehicle. The last thing he wanted was to scare the poor girl. He approached with his hands raised, so she knew he didn’t have a weapon. Maybe in the light, she’d recognize him from TV.
he approached. He knew by now that sometimes Tony was so in the zone he didn’t notice Steve enter, so he was prepared for no answer.
Strange groaned, but opened his eyes and stood, holding onto the armor’s shoulder for support. He didn’t speak, clearly struggling to stay conscious, but he did open a portal in front of them.
Tony said from the back of the group. It was a minimal use of power, and the grateful sigh of relief that came from the party was worth it. Strange did throw a sharp look across the group, piercing gaze narrowing as he met Tony’s eyes. Tony didn’t need telepathy to see the warning there; he nodded as an acknowledgement. That seemed to satisfy the sorcerer for now.
Tony turned to lead the way, but the room spun as he turned. Suddenly weak, he dropped to his knees. He turned back to look at the man, who was crouching now to keep a hand on Tony.
The trust that had taken them so long to rebuild after Civil War was shattered again. Steve couldn’t even meet Tony’s gaze anymore, and being around any of Tony’s friends made him want to curl up and die. There were so many secrets and lies between them all for the Illuminati, and it wasn’t worth it. Following their plans to destroy other worlds… What had he been thinking? Tony never learned or grew wiser, his mistakes just did more and more damage. He regretted who he was to the core.
She and Steve shared a look of understanding and ran to their friends while Hulk started smashing everything, which sufficiently distracted the small amount of men left. Natasha had made it to Clint and Steve was a few feet away from Tony when the Mandarin appeared in a swirl of cape and smoke, slowing Steve for only a second. Unfortunately the Mandarin was gone with Tony again before Steve’s shield had reached him, and it bounced from the wall back to Steve’s hand as Steve stood where Tony had been a mere second before. Steve wanted to scream in frustration or cry or something, but he had another teammate who needed him right behind him, so he pushed the pain of helplessness away for the time being, bringing on the numbness and drive of a soldier.
JARVIS explained while Tony studied the scans. How had he not thought of the gamma rays! He was learning so much today, it was hard to remember that all of this was a bad thing. Tony loved learning about a whole new subject to study. Vampires were fascinating. The experiments he could do if he just got his hands on a minion were endless.
He strode out with a wave of dismissal behind him. Natasha made for the interrogation rooms while the rest of them mingled behind.
He tried his best not to sound like he was lying, but the look Tony gave him indicated that he wasn’t very successful.
No one had anything to say after that. They all knew it was true. For some reason this genius was willfully ignorant enough to always think self-sacrifice was the only way. Steve was starting to think Tony wanted to die, at least subconsciously. He obviously didn’t like his life enough to protect it. Steve should have been a better boyfriend for Tony, maybe then he would want to keep living. Just more ways Steve had failed to protect another loved one.
Tony pulled away, heading towards the elevator with Steve following. He needed to mainline some caffeine.
he said carefully. Why did he sound like he was walking on eggshells? Like Tony might blow up at him?
Thor’s spiel was met with silence. Bruce’s shaking hand set down his tea, and the soft clink on the counter sounded far too loud.
Bruce said, standing. He knew Steve would feel obligated to do the dishes if someone else didn’t volunteer first, even though he had been the one to cook all the food. The tired and worried men gave him relieved smiles, and hurried off to shower and leave.
he breathed, not sure himself if it was genuine or a joke. Maybe it was a little of both. He let his eyes close and went back into the warmth of sleep.
Steve looked at Tony’s eyes and saw that he was being honest. He wasn’t disagreeing with what Steve said and he wasn’t trying to trick him so he could escape the conversation either. He looked like someone had just flipped his world upside down, which made Steve’s chest ache. How long had Tony been living under this illusion that he needed to make up for every last death his weapons had caused? That kind of burden is impossible to bare; it’s no wonder he behaved the way he did. He knew Tony wouldn’t change overnight, but he hoped getting this issue out in the open would at least begin a change in Tony so that he could be happier. That was all Steve really wanted.
That… was a believable story. He wanted to think that people wouldn’t believe it, that his friends wouldn’t think so low of him, but he wasn’t delusional. Everyone knew he was unreliable. No matter how long it had been since Tony had pulled a stunt like that, there was always the air of anticipation for when the billionaire playboy would fail them all again. He was suddenly exhausted, resigned to the situation.
Steve felt butterflies in his stomach. It was a feeling he thought would fade with time, but dating Tony felt permanently like being a love-struck teen. He didn’t need to sing above a soft rumble, the small cave’s acoustics making everything louder.
Bruce sat in medical, waiting. It was all he could do. He needed Tony to be alright and he needed it like he needed air. He knew logically that he hadn’t actually done anything to Tony, but he needed to see Tony alive to believe it emotionally. Plus that was his best friend in there. He needed him alive because he needed his best friend. Bruce felt the tears well up again, and he dropped his face to his hands. Tony was so good to everyone. He never deserved anything like this. How many times was Bruce going to sit in a hospital waiting with baited breath to see if Tony makes it out alive yet again? This was the second time in the same month. Bruce had to watch as so many of his team members were hospitalized over and over, especially Tony. It was never Bruce. He was too invulnerable as the Other Guy. Just once he wished it would be him instead. If anyone deserved it, it was him.
he broke off into a fit of giggles. Captain America could giggle. Strange would never have guessed it.
to follow them. The conflicting desire to scream and call the Avengers was merely a dull buzz in the back of his mind compared to Dracula’s own desires ringing loudly through his head. The suit formed around him while Dracula transformed into a bat. The flight to Transylvania took almost no time.
He gestured to the new lab equipment he had actually just ordered for Bruce’s lab, but hadn’t had the chance to show him yet.
A wave of dread washed over Tony. People wouldn’t be looking for him if they thought he had a reason to be gone.
The Mandarin's face twisted into a hideous mask of hatred. He punched at the bubble while one of his rings glowed, and Tony could see a ripple effect on the bubble where he hit. He was shouting but there was no sound from out here. Tony watched in fascination as Strange started chanting a prayer of sorts and the man in the bubble panicked. The panic didn't last for long as he slowly fell to his knees, then prone and still.
he tried. The flight strategy was not enough, he realized belatedly, when Hulk jumped upwards and caught hold of Tony’s right leg.
Zelma, on the other hand, had something very… off about her. Her psychic vibrations were something Strange had never come across. She seemed to be a normal human, with no powers or sorcery, but there was something causing a scattering of her thoughts, and draining her life force. He stored that information away for later, honing his focus back onto the spirit in the room talking to Barton.
Steve was blown away. He spun slowly, making sure he could still see the rest of the lab as well as the glowing words.
They were two weeks into Tony’s experiment, and things were going fantastically. Tony hadn’t slept a wink since the first injection and he felt better than he’d felt in years. In fact, the team was starting to get suspicious, especially Steve.
the spirit spoke. Clint felt like he might pass out, forgetting entirely about the rest of the room or the mission at hand. He hadn’t heard his mother’s voice in so long, and it felt all consuming. If you had asked him if he even remembered what Edith Barton sounded like a week ago, he would’ve told you he had no idea. He had accepted the loss of even the memory of the woman long ago, hating his father for her death. The man was such a worthless drunk, it had definitely been his fault when they died in the car crash. She had been a meek woman, unwilling to stand up to Harold despite the fact that she clearly cared about her sons.
Maybe this had something to do with a traumatic experience. Steve knew there was still plenty about Tony’s childhood that he never talked about.
The rest of the room watched them with baited breath. Even Peter seemed to pick up on the privacy of the moment and held his tongue. Tony held his best friend’s gaze. He had no issue with Peter hearing these things, his son had unfortunately heard worse. Wade Wilson’s past was pretty terrible, and the two of them seemed to attract all the children from broken homes at school. Tony liked to assume it was Peter’s amazing kindness that brought the saddest children to his side, seeking comfort. The kid’s heart was so pure and giving. Tony was only worried about Bruce.
They were like that now. The two of them could often communicate a lot without a single word. Tony was begging him not to do the trade. But how could Tony really expect him to risk Tony’s immediate murder? There was always the possibility that Dracula wouldn’t hold up his end of the deal and Tony would die anyway, but Steve thought it unlikely. Dracula was a lot of things, but he had always been a man of his word. Plus, the king tended not to do things that didn’t directly benefit him. What could he possibly gain from killing Tony? Steve wiped a stray tear away. All of this was too much.
The battle was not going well. Whatever Victor von Doom’s newest update to the doombots was, they were proving much sturdier than usual. It’d be fine if there weren’t so many. Each Avenger was swarmed with bots, trying to fight off several at a time just to survive. Doctor Doom himself was using the distraction to set up a scary-looking weapon that would probably destroy New York or something. Hulk and Thor were fairing a little better than the others, but Hulk needing to stop and fight his body’s attempts to morph back. Apparently an unrested Bruce could not hold Hulk form well. It made sense.
After everything that had happened in previous Octobers, Tony no longer let his guard down. Really, he never let his guard down at all anymore. They had far too many powerful enemies to be even remotely careless. So Tony always had the suit. Steve had been furious, well really all of them had, when they found out Tony had injected himself with untested nanobots for his bleeding edge armour design, but in the end it worked so they got over it. Personally, Tony thought people had been far too caught up on the ‘risk’ of it all, it was his tech for god’s sake. They should trust his tech more.
Coulson spoke, dry as always, so Tony couldn’t tell if he was serious. The way Clint whipped around in surprise told him that Coulson wasn’t joking.
Everyone watched with rapt attention. This had gone on much longer than the others’ checks. At this point, Strange was levitating an inch or so off the ground. Clint looked over at Steve, who looked like he might vomit out of nervousness.
p>Realization dawned on his face and Tony shut his eyes. He had been waiting for the day Steve realized what this was actually all about for Tony. He couldn’t say it aloud, so he had had to wait. This was the inevitable conclusion. Now Steve would remember that Tony was actually a mass murderer and be horrified; he’d realize that he couldn’t be with someone like Tony. Tony steeled himself for the blow.
The night of the opera was better than Frank could’ve imagined. Sure, his cheap suit was nothing compared to what the other patrons were wearing, but he felt good. An usher showed him to his seat, where he was going to get to watch an actual opera. The story was beautiful, and Maria’s character was the love interest for a tragic hero, but she secretly was toying with him while she pursued another man. It was devious and lovely, and Frank laughed louder than he should at the jokes, but it felt good. Maria definitely looked right at him during one of her parts, and he knew then, this was the love of his life.
Tony suddenly felt kind of cold. Was he so transparent that an eight year old could read him like this? He had never wanted Peter to be the one teaching everyone else how to be. It was his job to teach Peter, but he often found himself learning more than teaching.
Neither of them seemed to be aware of it as they watched Steve with rapt attention, waiting for more. It was easy to forget that Steve used to be so fragile. He just seemed invincible most of the time.
Dr. Nicholson eyed him seriously, and Clint just knew the woman had seen him moving around during Tony’s episode or whatever it was called. He nodded, making sure he looked properly scolded.
As the milk came to a boil, he turned around in Steve’s arms, planting a kiss on Steve’s nose, earning a funny face when Steve wrinkled his nose.
Iron man was still standing but the reactor was dim and flickering. Clint might very well be dead soon if not already and Tony was going to die if the reactor failed and he couldn’t take this. He made it to his boyfriend’s side in time to watch the armour land flat on it’s back. Steve couldn’t see Tony’s expression when he lifted the faceplate, his tears leaving everything blurry. The reactor finally went dark and Tony arched his back, gasping.
Steve couldn’t help but laugh. Vision always asked if people wanted him to share his ideas or do a solid plan, as though someone might say no.
even Phil Coulson, Agent-no-fun, joined in. Tony should just accept at this point that his life was not in his control at all anymore.
I've given up entirely on this being timely, but I am trying to finish it up, because I have other much bigger projects to work on. This was a hard prompt for me, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . I promise to finish eventually for those of you that are still reading! Kudos and comments give me life and motivation.
he moaned. People weren’t meant to deal with this much at once. There was a reason Tony pushes things away to deal with later, one at a time, preferably with alcohol handy. Steve was still talking to someone on the phone, but it all seemed distant. The dead Steve on the table in front of him, a ghost of the past, seemed far more real.
Tony looked so lost for a moment, eyes glassy, but he blinked and he was fine. Clint could almost believe he had imagined it if Tony didn’t take a long drag from the flask he brought.
for October spookiness, they had started talking about childhood memories. The group of kids hanging out together and exploring in the movie had generated the perfect casual nostalgia they rarely got, where the happy memories lie without the painful ones.
he snarled. His voice almost had a sound of distant thunder behind it. The supernatural really gave Tony the creeps.
she murmured into the receiver. She wanted to seem natural, not stick out of the crowd. If she yelled the way her nerves wanted her to, she would’ve been spotted by any potential pursuers immediately.
bend the rules, Wade Wilson was the man for the job. He wasn’t sure why he could, Peter was usually such a stickler for rules, but when Wade set them on a path of mischief, it always resulted in laughter and a good time. Plus there was something extra fun about having a shared secret they could allude to later.
It was amazing how Coulson’s entire demeanor and tone changed immediately as soon as official business was put away. He stood and gave Tony’s leg a reassuring squeeze.
That stopped Clint short. Wait, what? I was blind, Strange. Are you telling me that was real? he refused to acknowledge the fear in his voice.
The door to the lab slammed open and Darcy jumped. Thor was standing there in his full battle armour and the look on his face was terrifying.
Shaking his head, Steve headed for the door. He was supposed to spar with Natasha today, and he probably shouldn’t smell like sex for that. For her sake.
All sense of time was lost, Tony sobbing into the empty room. He wasn’t sure how much more of this he could take. He could handle most forms of torture, had far too much practice with it, but whatever this drug coursing through his veins was another level. Tony often felt separate from his body when things became overwhelming; he could dissociate and let the pain happen to someone else. This, though, came from inside him. His own blood had become the torture weapon used against him, so every beat of his heart the pain seem to start anew. There was an intricate web of heated barbed wire sawing outwards from his center.
but he cut himself off with a gasp. The arc reactor rapidly grew brighter before a flash of light that somehow became a halo that rippled outward like a raindrop in a puddle. He had to shield his eyes, but when the light was over, all the doombots were lying on the ground uselessly, and Doom was shouting. Thor seized the opportunity and crushed the weapon.
Natasha let them past, then had the nerve to call out his ego then disappear off the goddamn planet of the earth. Even when he'd found out the truth and tried to help, Clint spit in his face and - wasn't it his own choice to be here instead of with his family - and Sam,
"You think he'd want this Tony?" Rhodey was begging now. "I didn't want you to die because of me, do you think he'd want you to?"
Seeing him in action as they bustled around the lab made him tingle and grin. He couldn't help how more relaxed the doctor looked when they worked - whether it was from Tony or being in a more natural environment. It was amazing, and he knew right then that this flower would bloom quickly. Relief and irritation raged a war within him when Steve entered - relief for distracting Tony, anger for even showing his face. Proving him wrong about Shield brought Tony nothing but happiness, especially when Bruce backed him up.
Then he was falling, he could feel glass in his back and see the droplets of blood in front of his eyes. Tony was tired, he was so tired of blood, but there was no rest for the wicked and his armor closed around him. He had honestly thought he'd die in space, alone and freezing. Endless darkness had floated in front him forever, only interrupted by the nuke going off and flames. Somewhere he had looked forward to seeing if space would suffocate him first, or his flowers.
James Buchanen Barnes - the shadow of Steven Grant Rodgers. Or, he was the shadow of Steve in Tony's eyes. As well as his father's eyes - after all, he wasn't Barnes's friend, he was Steve's friends. In his father's eyes, he was one of Steve's closest friends and this directly clashed with Barnes being Steve's best friend. A best friend Steve took on ever mission to hunt down a Hydra base, who had a need for a famous mechanic on such a ride? But, maybe Tony's view and information on all this was bias. After all, he got all this information when he was seven or so from a drunken father in a dark lab with broken objects all around them. There was also the fact that Tony may or may not have gotten some brain and liver damage sometime in his twenties from the alcohol. But, he was still a genius and still very much alive so what did that matter?
Or, that's what he hoped would stop the flowers but he should've none - not even strong, beautiful, Pepper could stop the flowers from coming back. The doctor was so nervous and jittery when Tony had first met him, and even though the smile on his face when Tony complimented him was small, it was there. It made Tony
Their friendship remained strong, and they move on as best they can. If sometimes he catches Rhodey watching him with this sad look to his eyes and the tilt of his mouth, he says nothing. If Rhodey catches him smiling at him with more than a little happy twinkle in his eyes, he says nothing and they ignore it. It works for them, and Tony would have nothing more or nothing less.
The kid gets better, keeps doing his friendly spider business, and Tony keeps an eye on him. Probably not as close as he or the kid wants, but he has Happy on it and Tony trusts Happy. But, he makes sure to read whatever Happy sees him, and ignores the smile that graces his face when he hears the kids up to something. He fucks up, he eventually does, but how could he not? The kid had gotten into something he shouldn’t have, and he wanted to be Tony for god's sake. He took the suit away to protect him, and tried to ignore the voice in the back of his head and the slight tickle in his chest at the hurt in Peter’s eyes.
The kids here are jealous assholes, he ignores them for the most part and scoffs. He was Tony fucking Stark - no way in hell would they be able to keep up with him. At first, it was just him ignoring their snide comments, a hand or two shoving him, it was fine he was fine. But, eventually, Honeybear sees it and doesn't take kindly to it. By kindly, Tony means he's never thought someone punching someone in the face could be attractive. But hey, Rhodey makes it look good, damn good.
Howard wasn't happy - when during one his few sober moments when he was telling a story about the Captain - when Tony started choking. Something tickled the back of his throat, light and unnoticeable if you weren't paying attention. Tony had ignored it, and later that night when he had a small coughing fit, he saw nothing wrong just yet. It was only after another story from his father, that the signs really showed. Howard had been drinking while he told the story, and at the end where he told Tony he'd prefer Steve over him he hit Tony to the ground. But, Tony wasn't in pain from the slap, the pain blossomed from his chest until he heaved and coughed. Bloody Lilacs and Delphinium decorated his palms, and he heard his father's breath hitch. But, he didn't hit Tony again and instead stood and left the room without a word.
But, he lived and it turns out not only had he been spared a kiss, but the Hulk had snatched him from the sky. He wondered if his flowers would bloom for both of them. Of course, he was shocked when Bruce accepted his offer of staying in the tower - temporary, Bruce had said, and he repeated it to himself mentally. But, no matter how temporary it was, pride built in his chest and the flowers closed around the reactor. As time went along, Tony hated himself more and more.
It had taken a long time, and that time was nothing but pain. Moments where he couldn't enter his lab, or he'd remember and choke around his love. There were times he didn't want to get out of bed, as he turned away from Pepper's touched because hate for himself may scorch her. He knew why most people got the surgery instead, trying to have the flowers die on their own were way more painful. Eventually, after limited contact with Bruce - even with phonecalls - one morning he rushed to the bathroom and choked for an hour. A large, bloody Freesia stared up at him from the toilet water, and he watched it drown as he flushed it.
from the inside out, and he smiled around the slight burn in his chest. Even if Tony did want to put more distance between him and the doctor, it seems it wasn't meant to be.
He was rambling - back to James Barnes, or Bucky, which ever you choose. Tony didn't know much about the guy, Steve rarely spoke about him and when it did it was during vulnerable moments when Tony felt wrong asking questions. Moments when Steve's face was so soft and his eyes downcast, with his voice so quiet Tony thought it would carry on the wind. Sometimes it did, sometimes he'd stop midsentence and stare off into the distance long after you'd taken your leave. He hated when Steve did that, hated how something curled in his gut other than burning jealousy that this was the man his father loved and not Tony himself. But, James Buchanen Barnes was dead, Howard Stark was dead, Steve and Tony were like cats and dogs, so everything was the same.
He nearly dies the moment he hears about his parents' death. It sends him spiraling into shock. There's not enough breath coming into him, and he passes out from hyperventilating. When he attends the funeral, there's so many unfamiliar faces and fake smiles. He takes comfort in Jarvis and Obidiah's presence and places flowers on his parents grave. They try to take him out of MIT, but he insists on one more year. It'll be his last time to see Rhodey, he doesn't have long left. It makes him happy to see him again, and he's glad Rhodey doesn't walk on eggshells around him. The teachers do, they coddle him and suffocate him. In comparison, the students get harsher and eventually Rhodey starts walking Tony to every one of his classes.
Tony had admired Bruce before he'd actually met Bruce in the flesh. There weren't many people with intelligence to rival his own - not to toot his own horn or anything. Granted, the first article of Bruce's he read, he hadn't thought much of the man. He wouldn't blame himself, it was only the first of many articles to come. When they kept coming, he kept reading and kept getting more intrigued. As much as he'd loved to meet the man, he wouldn't. In his current state - drunk, partying, and with more than one woman hanging off his arm - all he would see from the man was disgust, he had no doubt.
He supposes, watching the snow fall down on him as cold seeped into his bones in a Siberian bunker, he deserved all of this happening to him.
When the man disappeared, Tony mourned as stupid as that fucking sounded. He didn't know the man personally, hell all he knew was what he got from the articles. But, he knew the man's mind and he mourned the loss of that intelligence. Even when he felt the faint tickle of something at the back of his throat, he didn't worry. Bruce was just an idea in his mind, not a physical thing the flowers could latch onto. If he'd ever met the man personally, he'd have worried. Especially, when years later after clawing his way out of Afganistan, when he no longer has a heart but instead a piece of metal in its place.
Tony let him go. The very next day, Bruce had his bags pack and even though they hugged, Bruce avoided his eyes. He promised he'd be back, once everything was passed, but Tony knew lies when he heard them. He'd been hearing lies since he was little, but maybe it was for the best. They kept a distant friendship up after that, not the close friendship Rhodey and Tony had kept up. It made him wonder if they could've been something if Tony had tried to change himself for the better. But, even that distant friendship ended eventually. They created Ultron together, things went terrible, and must Tony ruin everything he touches?
No one can tell Tony he didn't try, and for fuck's sake he literally hadn't done anything this time. The man wasn't there a majority of the god damn time. When he did appear, he sat in his lab and watched Tony work like some goddamn ghost. He was quiet, didn't ask for anything, and Tony didn't pay him any mind. Really, all Tony had done was make sure there was food and tinkered with his arm once or twice. But, still the flowers persisted and Tony choked and spit around them. Anytime a full one came up, he crushed it and threw it away. No, he wasn't angry at Bucky but at himself. Was this how it was going to be? Coughing up flowers for anyone and everyone that fucking looked his way?
Tony knew full well that he was rambling, but he wanted to talk about anything other than last night. He was sure everyone was already calling it his ‘relapse,’ and they were going to make a much bigger deal out of it than necessary. What had they expected, really? That Tony would stay sober forever? If they thought that was likely then they didn’t really know him. At any sign of trouble, Tony will always turn to the bottle and disappoint everyone else, it’s who he is and he had accepted it, why couldn’t they?
he really didn’t know why they were here. As much as he liked Pepper, they didn’t tend to talk one on one, not since the whole mess before he and Tony started dating. That… if Pepper hadn’t been there to clean up the mess, Steve didn’t know how bad it would’ve gotten.
he smiled, sitting up and propping himself against the headboard. The heaviness in his limbs and slight slowing to his thoughts was familiar enough, not dissimilar to being buzzed.
When Steve went down to the gym, Thor was already there. Steve looked at him from the doorway, curious. He looked like he was meditating. His body was still, his eyes closed. It was odd; Steve didn’t think Thor could be still. He was always so energetic. His eyes snapped open, and Steve felt the blush at being caught staring. Thor didn’t mention it though, just hopped to his feet excitedly.
he was concocting a strategy. Thor always turned right to spin if you got behind him. If Steve could get him to go for the turn and manage to roll and pop up in front of his left, Thor would be wide open. He’d have to be very fast. Speed was his friend against a bigger opponent.
Tony finished his answer, smiling over at Steve. Steve resisted the urge to lean over for a kiss right then.
He rasped. He could feel the palpitations starting, and he clutched at his chest unconsciously. Tony felt like he was spinning, but Steve must’ve been carrying him, because he was suddenly looking up at the robotic arm that could replace the wiring. JARVIS monitors had activated, because they were a steady stream of loud beeping in his ear.
The old woman’s smile was missing several teeth, and Amora wasn’t certain how the woman seemed to stare right at her when her eyes were the milky white of the Midgardian blind, but she was confident in her response.
The man wasn’t even afraid of spiders! What the actual fuck!? He swept the screen away with a scowl. Maybe Clint had fooled them all. He was actually more of a genius than Tony and just played a dimmer character all these years. If Clint was actually a genius, the only use Tony really was was his money.
Steve stuttered, lifting the pad so the camera view was on Tony. It had taken long enough to get used to talking to JARVIS at the tower, it was even more disconcerting on a Stark tablet. It was kind of like video chat, but the other person didn’t have a face.
Steve said, strained. He tugged on Tony’s hand, but the man had no qualms about following anyway. He hated talking to reporters as much as Steve did. He just hid it better.
Foggy thought it was a great plan. Sure the Avengers generally stayed out of Hell’s kitchen, letting the local heroes sweat the smaller time villains and organized crime, but he had no doubt they’d help if asked.
Phil let him create a gap between them. He had learned over the years when to give Clint space. When they got to bed tonight, though, Phil would show him how much he'd always be needed and useful. At least to Phil he would be.
Clint nodded curtly, not saying anything. Phil came around the chair and looked into the archer’s eyes, and saw the storm of emotions Clint kept reigned in.
This year, SI was working on an international project that took more oversight from Tony than usual. He was meeting with leaders around the globe to hammer out details of the Global Clean Energy Project (GCEP) and how it could fit into each country’s laws. More of them had issues with government contracts with electrical companies and oil or coal burning industries than he had initially thought. Between Pepper, the lawyers, and him, this October had been one long world-tour of legalese and diplomacy.
Steve scratched at the back of his head, not having a good response for this. He had kind of been hoping it would never cross Tony’s mind to ask.
The camera view flipped and Steve was looking at himself for a split second before averting his eyes. He didn’t think he could stomach the sight of himself right now, his self-loathing being so strong at the moment.
Clint nestled into Phil’s side with a contented purr. JARVIS and Steve would keep Tony safe for the rest of the night.
A wave of nausea and pain sent Tony to his knees and he opened the face plate, trying to get more air.
Peter scooched over until he was wedged between the two men, forcing them to adjust. The blanked was all messed up now, but nobody cared. Peter pointed up at the blood moon.
Tony slid across the table, rolling as he hit the ground and popping up in the hallway. There were a few options for him, and he might’ve made the mistake of running straight into Thor, but the demigod gave himself away by laughing loudly in his enthusiasm for the game. Tony saw the lit up red vest in time to dart right, heading for one of the two staircases on the floor. That answered his question as to whether or not he was the first Bruce found. Tony began running up the steps, taking them three at a time. He made it up to 32, but decided it was time to venture onto the floor, a little out of breath but still wanting enough energy to dodge and dive if need be. Tony had to admit, although begrudgingly, that the workout of both mind and body was nice without the pressure of serious injury or death.
The rest of the night seemed to be going by in the background. Steve just followed his partner’s lead, making small talk here and there, dancing, clapping, showing off their relationship, etc. Something at the back of his mind was bothering him, but he couldn’t quite place it, so he pushed it aside and focused on Tony. The billionaire was in his element, as much as he was loathe to admit it. Tony Stark was a socialite as well as a shut-in engineer. Tony liked to convince himself that the rich celebrity persona was all a facade, and a lot of it was, but Steve could tell that the man also felt at home at these events sometimes. Now if the world worked Tony’s way, there’d only be one or two events a year, but if all of them suddenly disappeared, Steve thought Tony would probably miss it more than he expected.
He made his way down to the lab where they thawed Steve the last time, hoping that's where Phil was. As he rounded the last corner he saw Phil leaning against the wall, his head tilted back and eyes closed, just outside the door to the lab. He looked exhausted.
Waking up in a medical room for the second time in one day was disorienting. The fog over Tony’s mind wasn’t natural, and he slowly concluded that he had been sedated. Opening his eyes slowly, he might’ve panicked if he hadn’t been surrounded by his family, Steve’s hand in his.
Tony yelled at the top of his lungs. It echoed through the lobby over JARVIS voice announcing Natasha’s victory.
Bruce stared at him again, Tony could see it was him, though he was still big and green, but Hulk shook his head suddenly, snarling, and Bruce was gone.
she said graciously. Didn’t want to tease him too much. Some men get nasty if you embarrassed them, and she was not in the mood to be antagonistic tonight.
Turns out the 26th floor is one of the Stark industries conference room floors. There were no meetings scheduled today, so he luckily would not have to worry about explaining his odd attire and appearance to any employees or stock-holders. Tony used to remember where everything in the tower was, but 62 floors took up a lot of space in his mind. Since the Avengers only really used the top 10 and he knew the bottom 3, there was a lot in between that he just didn’t bother with. He might remember Pepper mentioning that there were some cafeteria floors and some display floors for his cars, but who knows. Originally the idea had been to rent out space to businesses, but, once the whole Tony is Iron Man secret was out, no sane business owner really wanted to conduct business in a tall supervillain target.
He screamed. She caught the shovel easily where he had aimed for her head. He gaped at her, surprised, and she smirked as she crumpled the metal with her hand.
With that, she took the already filled out discharge papers from Agent’s hands (maybe he wasn’t a complete traitor) and looked them over.
JARVIS opened the door to the lab and Clint stepped in. It was fairly dark, as only half the lights were on, and they were only at half power. He didn’t see Tony so he walked further in and looked around. He saw the slumped figure against the wall and panic set in immediately. He quashed it when he realized JARVIS would have been more urgent if Tony were passed out or having heart problems.
He wasn't sure Tony was going to make it but he would try his damndest. Tony was an old friend and seeing him like this was rough, especially when it was because of a scumbag like the Mandarin. He gently told Tony that he was going to be alright while he did a quick internal check, magic running through his hands, over and through Tony's body, and back into himself. He hoped to all the Gods that he wasn't lying. Tony's lungs were collapsed and he was a wreck internally, and he had lost a lot of blood. On top of that he had burns all over.
Steve’s eyes were boring into him and he squirmed uncomfortably. Something told him there wasn’t going to be an easy way out of this conversation.
Tony watched Steve. He hadn't known he had said anything aloud. At least the others didn't know what he was talking about if Steve didn't until now. Tony didn't know what to say to comfort Steve though.
Clint said, scanning Tony’s body with a practiced eye, cataloging his condition. Steve knew Clint’s way of showing love was threats and insults. He bent down and kissed Tony’s forehead, then backed into the corner, waiting for Phil.
Before Steve knew it they were walking into a small deli that was overcrowded with clutter. There were Christmas decorations still out, and too many tables and chairs. Steve noticed a large mural on one wall of what looked like maybe Jesus in Nazareth? If it was, Steve was impressed because this depiction was more accurate to what Jesus probably actually looked like, according to that special Steve had watched on the History Channel (Steve really enjoyed the history channel, and used it to catch up on recent history). At the churches he’d been too, Jesus was always white with long flowing hair, which didn’t make sense for where he was from. His admiration for the mural was interrupted as Tony beckoned him over to the display counter, where there were rows of delicious looking desserts Steve had never seen before.
he spoke quietly, which for Steve, was his version of ‘you better give me the right answer or I’ll explode into an unreasonable angry soldier.’ Tony knew him.
She watched in helpless despair as he pushed the raw emotions back, and the far away sadness returned. Her mortality, although he wasn’t technically immortal, was always a sore subject. Thor was a positive, often happy man. Yet at the same time, he was a wise and old demigod, young for a demigod but much older than humans. With this wisdom came that far away sadness that Jane was pretty sure most people couldn’t see. Only sometimes could she push it away.
That explained the cold. Illusion spells, though? He’d have to ask more about that later though. He didn’t understand how that had made his three capable teammates unable to neutralize the Mandarin themselves instead of everyone needing to depend on Strange. Magic is so confusing.
The process was the same, and yes, her hair definitely defied gravity, it was cool. She didn't show any emotion though and Strange didn't say anything, he just looked vaguely uncomfortable.
Thor paused for the gasps he knew would come before continuing. He knew the day this secret was revealed would come, but had no idea when, nor how much it would sting to let his teammates know he had already known. He had sort of hoped Tony would tell first, though he suspected the man’s memories may have been wiped.
Steve yelled after them as they took off into his old neighborhood. He reached over to lace his fingers through Tony’s.
As the applause died down, Steve realized he couldn’t back out of this now. He got down on one knee, ignoring the way the audience began screaming in excitement. Steve was focused only on Tony’s reactions. The brunette’s confused look slowly morphed into a scarily blank face, but Steve could see the fear in the man’s eyes mixed with anxious excitement. There was so much there in the brown eyes, and maybe this had been a horrible mistake. Steve held his breath as he pulled the little box out and opened it.
