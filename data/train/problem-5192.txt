"Oh, zhe zime? It's like four forzyish?" Vanessa tilts her head, she looks back at him and shrugs. "Zhree chapters ago it was four o'clock so I'm jus guessing."
"I'll take one" Dean calls after her.
Tim nods hungrily. He takes a seat next to Sam, as Dean fills a plate with bacon and pancakes and slide it to Tim along with the syrup. Tim eyes the food suspiciously. "How do I eat this?" He asks, tilting his head slightly.
Cass bit his lip and broke eye contact. He looked up at the ceiling, blinking rapidly. He looked back down a few seconds later. “I don’t care what you think of me, Dean. but I’ll stick with Sam and Bobby and their ‘figments of hope.’ It’s better than watching you die.”
“Oh, come on” he whispered, “I’m fine.”
Dean was silent for a moment, searching the angel’s tear streaked face. “Cass… what’s going on?” he whispered.
“I’m sorry Castiel... There’s no mistake. I gave you time, because I’d hoped you’d come to me on your own. I had no idea, you weren’t even aware.”
“There’s so much blood… why is there so much blood!” he stared, mesmerized by the amount of blood on Cass’ body. “Sam!”
“Oh, you know what? Blow me Cass.” Dean yelled angrily.
Minutes of silence followed Dean’s outburst. He sat heavily back down in his chair. Cass looked upset and avoided facing him. Sam was staring at his brother in shock.
“All the wounds you had.. it was from your interrogation…”
Cass appeared back in Dean’s room, to find Dean pacing angrily.
Cass followed him out, smiling when Dean introduced Cass to Sam as his husband. Sam smirked. “Alright Dean, but I’m going to flex that I knew about your kid before you did.”
“I need to speak with you” the angel said drawing nearer to Cass.
He pulled in a shuddering breath. “What.. what’s to happen to me now..?”
Cass bit his lip, “I’m pregnant…”
Cass hummed into the phone as his vision blurred. “ah there’s a… there’s a... oh, ah.. Sam.. I see… Sam…”
Cass gripped his chin, digging his nails into his skin, forcing Dean to face him. “After all we’ve been through, Dean... After I left Heaven, after all I’ve done for you..” He stared deep in Dean’s tear-filled eyes. “Don’t make my time with you worthless… Don’t do that to me…”
“What the hell Dean! What the. fucking. hell!”
Cass lasted a few more seconds before he was screaming Dean’s name and came against him. Dean fucked him moments longer before thrusting deep and spilling inside the angel.
Cass stared back at Dean, sadness filling his face, he could see it in Dean’s eyes as well.
“It’s Dean” Sam whispered. He looked at Cass. “Dean’s the father… isn’t he?”
He used Dean’s lack of energy to drag him into an old alley. He slammed the man harshly into the wall.
Dean stared at Cass in confusion. “Cass what are you..”
“Abominations of the planet… yeah.. I know…” he trailed his fingers lightly over his stomach, he had yet to show. “Can’t I just get rid of.. this can all be over…”
Dean looked back up at the angel “Cass you have to listen to me-“
Sam stared at him in disbelief. “Cass you can’t be serious.. You should have seen him when you disappeared. Dean cried for months... And I never see him cry… and he was just as depressed this last time you left.” He gripped the angel’s chin. “And I can’t remember the last time Dean hooked up with anyone. I wondered why, but I know now... You mean something to him, Cass… You have to tell him…”
“Woah, woah” Dean said catching him before he fell back down “Take it easy, Cass.”
“Oh.. well at least he’s back… thanks Cass”
Sam was smirking on his chair. He raised his hand to try and cover his laughs.
Dean swallowed as he stared into Castiel’s face. “I don’t have any other choice Cass..”
“Feels good doesn’t it Cass.”
Cass shook his head. “I’m not hear to listen to you right now Dean.”
“Cass, you’re back did you-“ Sam stopped midsentence when he saw Dean draped over his shoulder. “What the hell happened to him?”
Dean wiped the blood from his nose and looked up at the angel. “What…“
“I don’t care, Cass as long as I’m on the run with you.”
Dean slammed the window shut and threw himself onto the bed just as Sam came to the door. Cass positioned himself resting on the desk to avoid certain speculation. Sam shook the lock a few times and before Cass could decide whether to leave his post and open the door, Sam had picked the lock and threw himself inside.
“What the hell did you do to this, boy?”
“Dean… aghh.. get off me.. I’m going too…”
“Or what!? Gonna kill me!? You wouldn’t do that!”
Dean’s face lit up and he cocked an eyebrow. “Well Cass, I do think I have you flustered for once… Seems like quite the night for it.”
“Cass please..”
“…God’s name, and begging in the same sentence… from you..? Hell that’s perfect Cass..”
“I’m pregnant, Dean…”
“Hey, hey, hey calm down… Dean.. Hey come sit down..” Dean was getting overwhelmed. Sam put a hand on his shoulder and led him to the chair next to the bed Cass was on. “Hey, you with me?”
“It’s ancient rule that in the case of Nephilim, both the celestial and mortal parent must die. Nephilim are too dangerous to be let into the world. And with the promise of death, they are less of an occurrence.”
Dean smiled and he went in, kissing Cass softly. His pace didn’t slow as he moved against the angel’s lips. He grasped Cass’ hair as he bruised the man’s lips.
Happiness filled him, when he heard Dean’s voice. “Dean…” he whispered. “ha… I missed you…”
“Oh, yeah?” Dean said, turning back to look at Sam before quietly closing his book and setting it aside with the reading glasses on top. He made sure to not disturb Castiel's form and focus as he got up and walked over to the dinner table, grabbing a slice of pizza from the box.
With a grunt, Sam lifted himself off of the chair and took a few test steps around. He could only feel the dull ache of a sprain now. “Better. Thanks, Cas.” Sam clutched onto his abdomen, the flannel of his once blue shirt now being soaked up with his blood. “This isn’t too bad. Take care of Dean, I'll get this.” After years of being on the road, he had gotten good at stitching up his own wounds.
“How many are we talking here? Ten? Twenty?” asked Dean, halfway through his slice of pizza.
“Alright,” Dean said, flashing a bright smile at both Sam and Castiel. “Let's show them who the real alphas are.”
“Cas,” Dean started before cutting himself off with a grunt as Castiel rolled up his undershirt and grazed his bruised chest.
“Cas. Look at me.”
His coughing fit snapped Castiel out of his trance who immediately appeared by Dean's side, hands on Dean's hunched over back as a water bottle appeared on the table where there hadn’t been one before. “Are you okay? Drink something. This is why you should not inhale your food. Humans must chew food thoroughly before it goes down their esophagus.”
“And we’ve done research on silver bullets and werewolf lore for the past week,” Sam continued. “I think we’re ready.”
Bones were easy for Castiel to fix. A few snaps here, a few shifts there. It was like a jigsaw puzzle; no matter how badly splintered off the bones were, he could put them back together. Human flesh, on the other hand, was an entirely different category. There were soft bumps and ridges, pores and blood vessels to account for, and soft planes that contoured the face that he could not replicate well enough no matter how hard he tried.
Castiel felt Dean move from the chair and followed his movement, allowing both of them to stand to their full heights. He could feel Dean smirk against his lips as he stood a few inches taller than him— a fact that always seemed to amuse him to no end whenever he noticed it. Dean held onto Castiel’s face with both of his hands, pushing them forward until Castiel's legs pressed against the table behind him. He slowly sat down on the table, never breaking the kiss between them as one hand continued to hold Dean’s jaw and the other grazed across his shoulder. He didn’t want to let go. He didn’t want to think for a moment that he would lose the warm feeling of Dean’s skin beneath his fingers— that there would ever me a moment in time without him by his side. Dean slid his hands across Castiel's body until they rested on the table on either side of Castiel's legs, keeping them both of them steady as Castiel's fingers brushed against the hair at the nape of Dean's neck.
at me.”
Castiel decided to focus on Sam first since his injuries would be a quicker fix. He rolled up the cuff of Sam’s jeans and placed both of his hands against his ankle, quickly miracling and healing the broken bones. Stepping away to give him some space, Castiel asked if Sam could walk with ease.
Dean felt his pizza go down the wrong pipe.
as they savored the moment. They stayed in that position for what felt like an eternity, listening to the sound of each other's breaths mingling in the air around them.
“Shh,” Dean said, finally breaking his focus and noticed his glasses that had fallen down his face. He pushed them back up his nose before shifting in his seat slightly to get comfortable again. “Don’t disturb him. He's on angel radio.”
Castiel opened his eyes, letting his hand trail down from Dean’s face to his sides, carefully avoiding the tender parts of his ribs. “Yes. I suppose this is conclusive evidence.”
“There is only one alpha per pack of werewolves,” Castiel responded, allowing himself to be wrapped up in Dean’s arms as he continued to discuss the social dynamics of werewolf packs. Dean simply kept his bright smile on his face and rested his chin on Castiel's shoulder as he let the angel ramble away, letting the sound of his voice soothe his fears.
Gently, he laid Dean against the back of the chair, attempting to focus on what he did best first. He unbuttoned Dean's shirt with steady hands, but his eyes betrayed him. Dean could read the fear and sadness that swam in Castiel's blue eyes. He had years worth of practice interpreting his looks and how to read what he attempted to hide. Even with one eye swollen shut, Dean could see what Castiel was trying to hold back.
“Anyways,” Sam started, clearing the space on the table to make room for the pizza boxes and attempting to organize some of their notes. “I think I found a lead on the werewolf situation in town.”
Castiel looked up at Sam but continued to rub soothing circles on Dean's back. “He could die.”
Sam stood with an expression that fought between amusement and concern. “Did you just miracle him a water bottle?”
“Angel radio?” Sam repeated, placing a few books and the two boxes of pizza he had carried with him onto the messy dining table. “Are there other angels out there?”
“Guys come on” Sam interrupted. “Can we figure some things out before you two already get back to your bickering.. Who’s after you?” he said addressing Cass.
Dean didn’t respond and cried to Sam, clinging to him, needing to know that he wasn’t just going to disappear like Cass.
Cass couldn’t help it. He kissed Dean back, moaning softly and grasping at the man’s back. Dean had quite the way to overcoming Cass’ morals and rules.
Cass took a step over to the bed. “You could say that.” He looked curiously around the room.
“Calm Down?” he said turning to face his brother. “Next time I see that godforsaken angel I’m gonna kill him. If he survives those… angels! I will murder him…”
“Nuh, uh” Dean gasped, gripping Cass chin and forcing him back. “Look at me Cass..” he breathed heavily, “You’re going to watch me baby. Watch me as I fuck you…”
“Go tell him, Cass. Tell him everything.” By the time he finished talking Cass was gone.
“Dean..” he gasped “they’re going to be here soon…”
Cass merely whined as his body was overwhelmed and overstimulated with Dean’s massive dick and speed. Cum escaped from between them at a much quicker pace. Cass was upright this time, so it made sense. Cum was dripping all down Dean’s cock whenever it appeared out of Cass. It was making its way all over the desk and on the papers and books they’d thrown on the floor.
“Sorry” Dean muttered, trying not to let Sam see what had happened.
Dean waited a few more seconds before pulling out from Cass’ body. hot cum that couldn’t be contained inside him, dribbled out and onto the sheets. He rolled over next to Cass and drew him close. The sheets beneath them were soaked, but they didn’t care. Drenched in sweat and smiling, Dean pulled Cass in for a kiss.
Dean went down once more before pulling off. Cass collapsed deep in the sheets, his legs trembling slightly.
“I should have been there,” Castiel said, voice breaking as his emotions squeezed at his chest and burned at his eyes.
The kiss was gentle at first. Dean didn’t want to scare Castiel with the sudden movement. After a moment, Castiel responded, lips moving against lips, and allowing himself to breathe Dean into him. The kiss quickly became more and more desperate. Castiel pushed out all of his fears and worries and received nothing but love to flood back into him. Neither of them had been the best at words, and Dean needed Castiel to know that he was safe now, that he was okay. He needed him to know how important he was and how much he needed him— how much he loved him. Even if he said as much every day if not every other day, it was never enough. He needed to show him when his words couldn’t get everything across the exact way he wanted them to.
"Well, I wouldn't ask that from you."
"An angel eh? Nice to meet you," Daniel says. "I'm Daniel, Vanessa's dad."
"Oh, you betcha, never permanently, of course. One time I brought in twin hunters and they got into a fight with a vampire and a poor pool table got the worst of it." Vanessa's lips curl into a small smile as the not particularly fond memory loops in her head.
Pluto purrs as Dean starts lightly scratching in between his large ram horns. "Anything else we should know about you? Do you have more dragons? Any...umm...half horse half fish shit?" Dean asks.
"Did you not want one?" Vanessa raises an eyebrow.
"He didn't want blood again?"
Vanessa opens her mouth to say 'it's fine' but she then realized that he probably had to look through her entire dresser to find them. "Did you go through all of the drawers?"
"Are you sure?" Vanessa asks, as soon as Dean nods Vanessa moves back to their original position and starts delicately rubbing her face into Dean's neck. A quiet hum comes from Vanessa as she places a gentle kiss on his neck, she smiles as she feels him shiver underneath her.
"Sure, maybe it was just a bird," Sam says before laying back down. "Chicken little," he mutters.
He forgets all about her hands that we're on his hips until they sneak their way past the band of his boxers. He groans softly when he feels warm hands firmly wrap around his shaft. He pauses on what he's doing to Vanessa and allows her to flip himself onto his back and her many pillows.
Cass was full on crying at this point. “I don’t know if I can, Sam… it’ll get him killed…”
“What happened Sam!”
...............
Sam sighed in relief, “Well that’s good to hear.. oh.. uh Cass.. where’s your trench coat?”
“I’m alright, I just- I need a minute with Dean…”
Dean was lying on his back staring at the ceiling of the bedroom. He’d forgotten about this room. He and Sam used to visit Bobby when they were younger and stay together in this very room. Back when things were simpler.
“You ready for me baby?” he asked as he positioned himself at the man’s entrance.
“You pray too loudly” Cass mocked, pushing his sword through the praying man’s chest.
Dean smiled and pushed into the smaller man. He went all the way in, pressing his chest against Cass. He could feel the movements of the man’s chest as his moans filled the room.
“Just can’t get enough of me can you Cass?”
Cass started gathering the books and papers strewn all around the desk. He grimaced. “Uh Dean.. a lot of these are… well.. wet…”
“It’s okay, Cass.” He comforted. “We’re going to be okay...”
“It’s feels so long, Dean. It feels like I’ve been running so long.. I’m so tired.. I just want to stay here.. I want to stay here.”
“Yeah Cass, where’s your trench coat?” Dean asked him
“Then make me understand!”
Cass turned and locked eyes with Dean, “Listen, I’ve managed to piss off some very powerful people and excuse me, but I will not lead them here. So.. let me go.”
“Promise me!... Please Sam..”
Dean let out a breath. “Is that why you’ve been gone for so long… you didn’t want to tell me..?”
“Castiel, stop.. Heaven already knows of your condition.. I just wanted to be the one to break it to you…”
“Yeah I know.. you just- normally you always wear a... trench coat.”
Sam paused. “Why don’t you talk to Dean. He cares for you Cass... He can help you…”
Dean looked up in fear as the man fell bleeding to the ground, “Cass, come on!” he turned to flee, before Cass caught his shoulder and pulled him back. Cass punched him squarely in the nose, making Dean go dizzy.
“I got that much.. but why?”
“Cass I would never... ever let my brother die.”
“I need him Sam! I need him here!” Dean cried. “He left cuz of me!” tears were running down as he shook Sam, trying somehow to make him understand.
“Like hell I-“
He was wrong. He thought seeing Dean, would help him see he was making the right choices. But instead, seeing Dean brought up all of Cass’ suppressed feelings. It reminded him of the dull ache in his heart. How lonely he was without him. He let out a long breath, as he stared at the father of his child.
Dean looked over. “uh.. we spilled some water on them.”
“That’s right baby. Cum for me. I want to feel you. Scream for me while you do.”
“FUCK YOU CASS! YOU-“ he was silenced by Cass punching him in the face. Dean’s head slammed into the wall. He groaned in pain before Cass punched him again. His head hit the wall with every punch delivered. Then Cass took him roughly by the neck and threw him to the ground.
“No” Cass said locking eyes with Dean, his expression completely neutral. “It was surprisingly uneventful.”
“I’m so sorry, Castiel. I never wanted this for you… but Nephilim…”
“Cass…?” Dean murmured, gripping the angel gently.
Dean took this as his cue to go back in and explore the man’s mouth. Cass moaned softly into the kiss, his hands slipping under Dean’s flannel and pressing into his back.
Cass’ hands came to rest on Dean’s chest. He hesitantly started working on the buttons of his flannel. He needed to feel the heat of his bare chest. He pulled apart the shirt and melted into the man. He ran his fingers across his hot muscles, caressing and pressing into him.
“Maybe we spilled juice on them! Come on Cass try and help me out here.”
Hundreds of emotions filled Cass’ body. He felt sick. His thoughts brought him back to Dean and he quickly blocked them out. This can’t be happening.. it wasn’t possible…
Dean slammed harder and harder into Cass. Cass was a complete mess of moans and whimpers. He clung to Dean’s neck as the man laid claim to him. A loud pathetic noise escaped him and he came all over the desk and Dean’s chest, adding to the mess on the floor and to Dean’s flannel.
Cass let out a breath and nodded, “thankyou…” He looked over to Dean, then back at Sam. “Can I have moment with him please..”
Cass blinked back tears and nodded.
“Aghh.. God… faster Dean… please…”
“What-“ ohh… Cass’ eyes widened and he threw himself out of bed. He stumbled a bit before finding his pants and hastily putting them on. He looked over at Dean who was doing the same thing.
“Yes, Cass. I’m happy it’s you. I want to be with you, and I’ve just been waiting for you to come back so I could tell you that..” he gave Cass a small smile.
“Dean its not your-“
Cass wet his lips. “It appears that I am… pregnant…”
“Oh, shut up, you did this to yourself.”
He didn’t much remember the trip back to the hotel room, but he remembered seeing Dean. Leaned over him and worried. He passed out before much else.
“I don’t care, Castiel.. you’re mine until then.”
Cass cocked his head, “Did I embarrass you?” he said noting the red pallor of Dean’s face.
Cass groaned and Dean picked up speed fucking him harshly. Dean slammed into him over and over, pushing himself as far inside Cass as he could with each stroke.
Dean’s eyes widened. “Cass…” He blinked before letting go of the angel’s wrists.
“Dean…”
“I’m not letting you go anywhere.”
“Go?” Sam asked incredulously, “Cass, you look like a cutting board, you’re not going anywhere.”
Cass whimpered softly and curled up under Dean’s chin. Dean smiled and held Cass as tight as he could. “I love you Cass…”
Dean opened his mouth to say something, but Cass stopped him with a hard punch to his head, knocking him unconscious. Cass caught him in his arms. He held Dean close, tears escaping him as well. Laying his head on Dean’s shoulder, he let the tears fall onto Dean’s jacket.
“Don’t you test me Dean Winchester.”
Cass lifted his watery eyes to Sam and nodded.
Cass had gotten to his knees in front of Dean and was fumbling with the belt. He looked up at Dean in disbelief, “You just told me-“
“Are you serious Cass? Angels? Why the hell would you piss off.. the fricken angels?”
“Then put me in danger, Cass, as long as I’m here to protect you.”
Cass’ face remained neutral as he stared Dean down, with a hint of confusion passing through.
Cass drew in a sharp gasp when he felt Dean’s hard length push up between his legs. He dared not look down. He could feel the heat of Dean’s body against his. The heat of the thing pushing against his pants.
“I- I can’t let you do that Dean..”
“I disappointed him…” Dean whispered into Sam’s chest. “How could I do that….”
He pulled in a long sigh, before pressing his fingers gently to Dean’s forehead, waking him up.
Cass groaned and he felt himself losing focus.
Tears fell from his Cass’ eyes. “.. You cant just kill me…” he whispered. “Please…”
Dean turned to look at the man, “You don’t trust me Cass? I’m hurt.”
“I really have to go.”
Cass gasped in surprise at his new position. He could feel the heat between his legs as he pressed against Dean. He shifted against the heat, before he felt soft lips press against his neck. He tilted his head back, giving Dean better access. Cass moaned feeling himself get harder. Dean’s fingers made it under his trench coat and shirt and ran lightly across his back, holding him close.
Cass materialized outside of Bobby Singer’s house. He shook off his dizziness, blinking back tears and looked up at the windows. Dean was here. He approached the door and ran a hand down his stomach. He had just barely begun to show. He didn’t know if the cause was him being an angel or what. He had never been pregnant before.
“It’s a personal matter and none of your concern.”
“Sam! Sam he’s not moving!”
Sam searched his face before standing up. “Alright Cass.. But if you ever need anything, please talk to me.. okay..?’
“Dean” he whispered in realization. Ugh. He laid back against the bed. He had to leave before Sam and Bobby came back, which could be any minute. He untangled himself from and Dean and dropped to the floor. he searched for his pants and slid back into them. He stood up and started buttoning up his shirt. He looked over to the bed and flinched in surprise to see Dean staring at him.
Cass kicked him hard in the face knocking him back down. “Truth is; you just want to die, Dean. Tired of life, tired of the job, tired of the fucking apocalypse. If you can spin it so you do a good deed on your way out, then hell you jumped at the chance.”
“I wasn’t serious!” Dean yelled as he pushed Cass’ hands away. His face was bright red as he put his belt back together.
“You are literally perfect Cass.” He whispered “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
Cass reached out and stroked Dean’s cheek. “Don’t try and look for me, Dean…”
He leaned over Cass’ body and started pulling his coat off him. It took minutes of careful work, trying not hurt him, but Dean finally got it off. Sam returned just as Dean stared in dismay seeing Cass’ shirt completely soaked in blood.
The angel looked down on him in pity. “Don’t make this harder than it is Castiel. You’re already looked down upon as an angel already. But I.. I happened to like you. Wanted to give you a second chance..” he sighed “You’re not making me look very good, Castiel.”
“Never thought I’d see the day I’d get to fuck a fucking angel” Dean grunted through his fast pace.
‘Well duh, Dean”
Dean took a few deep breaths. “What happened to him, Sam? Who did this?”
While he waited for Sam to come back, he moved his chair closer to Cass. He looked so vulnerable laying there. No power or strength visible in his eyes. Dean wanted to cry, looking at his angel. There was so much blood. Practically covering every part of the man.
“He’s just unconscious, Dean.”
“Sam…. I didn’t mean-“
Dean’s smile overtook all his features. He looked quite nice with it. Cass hardly got to see him smile anymore. Like a real smile.. he missed it..
“Cass I-.. I cant…” Dean whispered lowering his head.
Sam nodded and lifted Cass gently so Dean could peel off his shirt.
“Who’s the father, Castiel?..”
Cass pushed harder against Dean’s throat. “I don’t care what kind of shit Michael ‘needs to do.’” He spat “I care about you Dean. I care whether you throw your fucking life away for.. for this.”
“Cass!? Cass, where the hell are you?”
Sam’s mouth fell open in shock and Cass refused to look in his direction.
“Calm down Sammy, I’m right here.” Dean called from the bed.
“No. no tell me what’s wrong.” Dean said pulling Cass back to his chest.
“I- I have to go.” Cass muttered trying to get out of Dean’s grasp.
Dean rolls on his heels as locks from the inside unlock. The door opens and a drop-dead gorgeous bright pink-haired woman pops her head out. Her beautiful chocolatey brown eyes look them up and down before she croaks out "What?"
Dean whips around to look at Vanessa, his short hair is combed to perfection, he is wearing a pair of sweat pants that are definitely not hers and a Led Zeppelin t-shirt that could be hers. "Morning gorgeous," Dean says with a smile, he turns back to the sizzling food as Vanessa takes a seat next to Sam.
He shrugs and walks over to the couch and says "couldn't sleep, probably will when the potion runs its course" they sit down on the couch, Vanessa grunts and starts scratching her legs.
"I can never understand how you do it," Dean mumbles as he shuffles his way into the kitchen. Making his way towards the partly full coffee maker, Dean pours himself a cup and adds a little bit of creamer to it.
"Fine. Go grab your stuff, let me wake up first," Sam sits back up again, rubbing his eyes.
Vanessa holds her hands up "sorry jeez, " Vanessa turns to the last vampire, her face is drenched in tears, her knuckles bloody from fighting.
"Of course, there's a bookshelf in the kitchen and plenty of beer and chips to last you till we get back," Vanessa says as she puts something in her shoe. She walks towards the door and looks at Dean.
She makes quick work changing into fresh black panties and deep plum purple leggings. Vanessa turns around to find Dean dressed in a brown undershirt with a red flannel over it and blue jeans.
Dean clears his throat and walks to the driver's side pretending as if he isn't freaking out on the inside, he slides into the car and shoves the keys into the ignition aggressively. He drives out of the motel parking lot and starts following any sign that has the word zoo on it.
"Almost every time, dragon heart don't do shit," she says as she flips herself onto her back, "we were thinking about heading to Maria's to celebrate," Vanessa tells Bobby.
Sam and Dean take a seat at the fire pit as Vanessa gathers wood to put in it, she snaps her fingers, and all the wood catches on fire. Dean sighs and looks up, while it's only sixish? The sun has started to set and the almost full moon rises. Dean watches Vanessa turn on all the pool lights, the fire outlining her silhouette.
"Wow," Dean says as he watches one of the gray wolves worm their way closer to the others.
Dean groans when Vanessa puts her awfully warm mouth on the tip, she swirls her tongue around it, making him leak precum into her mouth. "F-fuck, " he whimpers and he runs his hand through her barely brushed pink hair.
Vanessa looks away from his gaze and past his head and onto a lamp, it has so many flowers on it, Vanessa starts mentally counting the flowers instead of responding to Castiel.
On the left side of the bed is a slightly open door, hoping that's the closet, Dean sets the bag of goodies down at the door and swiftly walks to the closet. He opens it to find that it is a bathroom and closet, he quickly finds what he needs and closes the door.
"Could you not get to sleep?" She slightly tilts her head. Dean shakes his head 'no'.
"Uhh, Kansas? It's not Oz," Dean nervously jokes, the man focuses on him harder.
"B-Bobby, uhh, send me any information you find about people falling out of the sky," Sam says before hanging up and stuff his phone in his pocket.
"What would that be love?" Dean asks, his voice poisoned with lust.
"Why do you have a German accent?" He mumbles, collapsing back into his pillow.
"Show us what it is," Daniel says before Vaness holds it up to her chest.
"You might wanna wash them, they still reek of vampire blood," Vanessa says as she scrunches her nose.
Vanessa sits on one of the couches, waiting for Dean to finish eating. She ignores the protest from her stomach and tells herself that she'll just eat whatever they catch; which helps a little.
"You're probably one of the best singers I've ever heard," Dean steals a glance at Vanessa.
Vanessa starts to put more of him in her mouth, taking as much of Dean's large cock in her warm mouth and barely down her throat. Pleasure surges through Dean as she starts to move her head up and down sucking gently and using her wonderful tongue. "Fuck Vanessa, " Dean grunts.
"But, that doesn't mean it's a no. I'll just have to think about it Dean, for right now I'm hungry, so I am going to grab something to eat and probably not look your brother in the eyes until maybe tomorrow." Vanessa pats Dean's chest as she stands up.
"C'mon Dean," Castiel grabs Dean's hand and pulls him towards one of the many entrances, making Dean nearly trip on the stairs in his hurry. Castiel has Dean open the door, in fear that he'll rip it off.
"Alright, I brought three, last time I only brought one when we needed at least two for your tail," Castiel says, he gets down on his knees and starts rubbing a towel on her scales, making sure not to go against the grain.
"Sounds good, I'll come," Bobby says as he walks towards the coffee table and picks up the book he was reading.
"Well if you're going for the big boys like a Phytosaur then yeah, but most of Texas was underwater when the dinosaurs roamed so it won't be that hard," Vanessa glances back up to Dean, his face is a feeble shade of red, probably from putting so much energy in to keep afloat, Vanessa couldn't imagine not being able to breathe underwater.
"You can smell it?
Everyone in the living room perks up at the sound of someone groaning/cursing as they stumble down the stairs.
"Joggin'. I told him the best route through the neighborhood, goes uphill and down," Daniel hums. "Did you want eggs, Dean?" He turns his head to see Dean's nod.
Dean shakes his head no. "Ah no, he left to get us lunch, he left late to be back by the time you woke up, but he'll be here soon."
"Is that it?" Sam points to a long sword thats on display on the TV stand.
"You're sooo soooft," Vanessa slurs, running her fingers through Castiel's dark hair, she hums as one of her hands trace his jaw.
"It's something that we do to 'claim' each other or show that we love each other, I didn't mean to do it to you without your permission," Vanessa says, blushing even more.
Soon Dean finishes making the rest of the pancakes and bacon and puts them in the fridge, but not before stuffing his plate with as much as he can fit. He slides into the seat in front of Sam and sets his plate down, drowning his pancakes in syrup before he begins to eat. "Any plans for the day?"
"I'll do whatever you want birthday boy."
"Munker?" He groans, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.
"Well, we'll both get cleaned up, then we shall go and rescue Dean," Sam says "we have plenty of dead man's blood for all of the vampires, so you and Cas will go for most of them while I'll go for Dean."
All the color has been drained from his face, and Vanessa is sure that if he opened his eyes, they'd be a dull green. His short brown hair is drenched in sweat, the only thing that tells Vanessa that he's alive is the fact that he's breathing.
"Be a morning person," Dean says, leaning against the counter, taking a sip of the hot coffee, he sighs before speaking again. "So has our guest awaken yet?"
"I thought you might like bees, I probably should have asked, but I was sure you'd like them."
"I should, maybe he'll be more of a fighter than Pluto is," and with the mention of his name, Pluto crawls into the kitchen curiously.
"Me too" Bobby adds.
Dean takes his seat and sandwich next to Vanessa as Sam comes shuffling into the kitchen and takes his seat next to Vanessa. "I expected Cas to be back by now, " Dean says taking a big bite of his delicious sandwich. After the first few bites, he realizes how hungry he is, which is a relief that the potion is working wonders.
As they make their way downstairs, Vanessa remembers when she first got Pluto and Malachite. It felt like only a couple hundred years ago when Lir surprised her with Pluto's pale blue egg as her dad surprised her with Malachite's neon green and black egg. That was such a fun hatchday, and it was so long ago but Vanessa still remembers.
"Ready to go?" He asks. Tim nods and stands, adjusting the sweat pants as Dean leads him to the Impala. "Now this is Baby be gentle, we're gonna drive you to our home," Dean opens the back door for Tim. "Get in."
Panic courses through her. Vanessa quickly lays back into bed and grabs the books she had the other night and puts the book into her lap.
"And the case in Texas the victims were killed in locked rooms with no signs of someone breaking in over two months and the third was hanged from a flagpole," Sam says before Dean adds "so a ghost? That's easy enough."
"Ah, you must be Dean and Sam!" A man says, Dean quickly looks him up and down. He is a few inches shorter than him with very dark brown hair and the same colored eyes as Vanessa.
"The rest is probably ours," Dean scratches his head. He lifts a bag with blue tissue paper on it onto the coffee table.
'Can you get me a fish sandwich?'
"What happened the other day tends to happen every other week," Dean admits, his smiles shrinks.
Vanessa cuts him off. "Of course you can come, I don't do much for it, my dad always comes over and makes me do things with him, so it'll be fun."
"Oh, sorry, I wasn't sure," Dean rubs her back, scratching her occasionally, making her hum.
Dean quietly pulls out the shoe box and pulls off the lid, the first thing that he sees is a beautiful gold necklace that has the biggest and reddest ruby that Dean has ever seen. Under it are very old pictures of what Dean assumes to be Vanessa's great-great-great-grandparents? Her great-great-great-grandma looks just like her, or it could be the fact that Dean hasn't had any coffee or tea yet.
"You're a twin?" Sam asks as he shoves more of his food in his mouth.
"Dammit!" Vanessa yells again, kicking a rock into the street. Her headache from all the spells starts to fade away as Vanessa rubs her temples.
"You just drank five!" Dean says as he reaches for the half-empty bottle that's in her hand.
"And you?" The waiter turns to Tim, who doesn't say anything. "He'll have the same as me," Dean gestures to his brother. "Except with chocolate milk," Dean finishes with a grin.
"Well, if you wait long enough, I can cook it for you."
"It was just a dream Vanessa," someone whispers in her ear.
"Understood," Sam says bluntly, popping in a tape automatically, turning up the music louder than normal. "Bobby called again," Sam says lowly as Dean starts to head out of the gas station. "He said he's coming to the bunker, he'll be there in a couple of days."
"Or, I can just eat it right now," Vanessa replies, but she doesn't. Instead, she holds her dying fish and Dean's fishing pole as he runs to grab the cooler that he keeps in his car. Once all the beer is removed, Vanessa places the trout in and closes the lid.
Vanessa runs down the stairs, summoning more blue balls of energy, she runs into the living room, expecting more people to send through the walls. But she finds someone familiar on the couch, curled into themselves. She turns on the light and blinks for her eyes to adjust. "Sam?" She guesses as she obliterates her balls of energy. "Sam Winchester, is that you?"
"Whatever it is, just do it."
"Hey, I'm not dumb!" Dean protests.
He is currently driving to the house where they first met, Dean is very excited to see her again but also very nervous because she said that her dad is visiting her.
"No, I don't think so," Sam replies.
Sam gasps and pretends to be offended. "I would do no such thing!"
Every picture and drawing showed is in detail and reminds Vanessa of a bird's wing. Seraphim only have one pair of wings and they can come in a range of colors, the one that they've captured had smaller wings that were a rich golden brown.
Dean glances up to the rearview mirror, Tim is happily crunching on his cereal, not even listening in on what he and Sam are saying. Chewing on his bottom lip, Dean's gaze turns back to the road ahead. "I'm not really sure what he could be," Dean sighs. "And I don't even know where to start."
"Oh, uh, 's where they keep a bunch of animals, not like pets, they keep 'em in nice habitats," Dean explains. For the last ten minutes of them driving in complete silence, he has been having trouble focusing on the road. His thoughts keep turning from his memories of Bobby taking him and Sam to a zoo while their dad goes out on a hunt, to thinking about the angel right next to him.
He nods, he takes off his suit jacket, showing where his wound is. She licks her lips as she unbuttons his shirt and tries not to stare at his some of his stomach muscles. She ignores the creeping blush as she starts tending to his wound. Cas's isn't as big as Sam's, but it looks like he's been stabbed by something. She sloppily spreads the healing salve and hovers her hand over the wound, muttering a healing chant in Latin and using her magic to heal him as fast as she can.
Her hair once fully pink is now only pinkish-purple on the bottom, starting where her ear lobes would be while the top is a very dark brown almost black. Vanessa moves a strand of hair out of her face and behind a fin, or what Dean assumes is her ear. She has dark bags under her eyes and her usual dark tan skin seems a lot paler than normal. Vanessa is currently wearing a plain grey t-shirt that is a few sizes too large with black baggy sweatpants.
"Sounds good, if I can't, can you put me to sleep?" Dean asks, rubbing his cold arms. Castiel nods and watches as Dean walks inside, past the blazing fire and into the warm house. With all the lights off and all the closed curtains, Dean can still almost perfectly see in the dark, which is the only fun perk of almost becoming a vampire.
Vanessa doesn't drive her cars very often, but when she does, it's always to impress her friends, and was Dean impressed! His whole face lit up as he walked around the car to look at it, he kept shooting question after question about the car.
Vanessa slowly wakes up again, opening her crusty eyes to find that she's still in Castiel's arms and wings, but the sun is up and is peeking through the hotel room's curtains. "Mmm," Vanessa shifts in his arms, trying to push him away so she can get up, but he just pulls her in tighter.
Dean puts the keys into the ignition and smiles as the engine rumbles. He rummages through his cassette tape box and puts on the first one he grabs, which happens to be Metallica's black album. He hums the song as he backs out of Vanessa's empty driveway happily, hoping to find a nearby store that is open and still sells fresh fish.
As soon as the door closes behind him, Dean rests his back on it and takes a deep breath, the cold Bunker air makes him shiver as he pushes against the door as starts towards the kitchen, not spotting his brother anywhere.
"Dean you're already on the road, don't turn around just for me," Vanessa says, shifting her phone from one shoulder to the other one, she stuffs her big black luggage into the trunk of her purple 1967 Pontiac GTO. She could have just taken Castiel's offer of flying to the hotel but Vanessa wanted to see Dean's face when he saw her car.
A little bell jingles as they step into the well-air-conditioned building, the smell of hot dogs and coffee hit Dean pleasantly, immediately they head for the little snack aisle. Dean grabs a little bag of beef jerky and leaves Tim to grab a drink. The cold air from the gas station's fridge makes Dean shiver as he grabs a soda then turns around to not find Tim where he left him.
Dean blinks at her in confusion. "Oh, I meant the smell, " he says with a small smile, "I've seen worse ingredients before, a little spit and hair isn't gross, "
Dean nodded and offered her a small smile. "Uh, yeah. Sure, no problem. Let me get laced up and I'll meet you out there?" Naomi nodded and walked away, gently running her hand over Castiel's shoulder before she walked out onto the ice.
Castiel's eyebrows shot up and looked to Michelle. They shared a knowing nod as she ashed her cigarette. "I think that's all we need, Dick. We'll be in touch."
? I'm gonna stay for a while and help out, man! Looks like you're gonna need it." Sam made his way half up the porch before Dean shot into motion and followed his brother. He rounded on Sam and slammed his back against the door, trying to lean against it casually. Sweat gathered at his hairline and he reached back to rub his neck nervously.
"What. Is that THING. In MY POOL." Dean slapped his palms down on the counter that was covered with taped down business cards and fliers.
"Cas, you have legs," Dean said dumbly.
Dean’s eyebrows raised as he turned his had back towards the bar. “Holy shit. Cas?”
"Wait," Dean sat up in his seat and stared at the other man. "You---you guys sell drugs?"
"Dude, you're human. You gotta have some too."
Dean captured Castiel's lips in a wet, searing kiss as he continued removing his jeans.
That seemed to satisfy Dean which made Castiel relax.
"Is she---"
“On what, Cassie? The wall of moss you call a door?” Gabriel walked up behind his brother and whistled through his teeth.
Dean felt a pang of nervousness and guilt thread it’s way through his bonding mark. “We don’t have to go,” he whispered. “I can shift and peck those asshole’s eyes out and we can go back inside and practice.” It shocked him a little when he realized he really meant what he said.
Castiel kissed the mans ear with a chuckle. "If you must." He rounded the corner and poured them both a cup of coffee, sliding one across to Dean. "The Romans will need to be dealt with soon," Castiel sighed into his cup.
“I don’t feel well either,” Dean groaned, curling in on himself. “I think—fuck, Sammy something’s wrong.”
"Heya, Castiel. It's good to see you!" Cain pulled him in for a hard hug and a pat on the shoulder. "How ya been? We're so glad you could make it this yea---Oh, I'm sorry, was I interrupting?" He glanced to Dean who was still sitting on the bed.
Dean’s brain finally clicked into gear. “I can—uh, hang on.” He quickly walked out from behind the counter and into the little bathroom in the back. He checked his reflection in the mirror before scooping up a towel and heading back out into the front room. The man was facing away from Dean, looking out into the raging storm. From this angle, Dean was able to see the gorgeous curve of of the mans back that lead down to a sinfully shaped ass. He turned when he heard Dean coming up behind him.
decide when you're ready."
Ellen walked back into the room and slammed a pile of books down on the table. "Get readin'. I'll make more coffee."
“You’re calling yourself part of the Winchester’s family?” The redhead barked a laugh and leaned down to the Gabriel’s ear. “You’re nothing to them. You’re a pathetic excuse for an angel and they only use you when they need something.”
Dean picked at the scale absentmindedly, his eyes traveling up Castiel's arm and wondering what ones would come off next. Only a few patches of skin were shining in the light and casting a pale green light across the top of the water, the rest was smooth and tan.
“Kink-a-what?”
"Wait!" Alfie screamed. Dean froze, hand mid air. "Wait," he panted. Dean dropped his hand but still held pressure on the pick. Alfie looked to Castiel and sighed. "Someone approached me last month, didn't know who he was. He said he was looking for information on Michelle. I told him to fuck off at first but three other guys came outta nowhere and---," he closed his eyes and shook his head. "They said they'd buy the guns cheap and I could skim the rest in return for tabs on her."
“Hey,” he said, placing his hand over the witch’s, “it’s fine. As long as they keep the food and ale coming, I don’t have a problem with staying.”
Castiel reached down and began stroking Dean's cock, pumping him until he was fully hard. "After you I make you come."
"I'm going to be blunt, Dean. I have a lot of money and I need to keep up appearances when I go to business functions. I'm tired of my family and...coworkers trying to set me up with random people I have no interest in. I would pay you, handsomely of course, to be my romantic partner. In return, you could pay for your brothers tuition and housing, plus whatever else you desire."

"Castiel?" a voice called from behind the door followed by a sharp knock.
“Dean?”
"You should--," Castiel's eyes flashed towards the bed, "let's get you into the bed. There are more blankets and I'm sure it's far more comfortable than the chair."
Dean whined as he watched Castiel's hand wrap around the head of his cock, smearing his pre come down his shaft. He closed his eyes and cried out as he came over Castiel's hand and onto the table.
Castiel's eyes widened. "You don't---I can tell her you're not feeling well---she isn't very---"
"When is the last time you talked to Sam?" Castiel asked without looking back. He pushed open a door that lead down a dark flight of stairs. He reached up and pulled a long string, lighting up the lower half of the room.
Castiel ran a hand through his hair, a very human thing to do Dean thought, and sighed. “Dean Winchester, you are too important to be killed in this war. I—my father has
Dean grinned at the phone and watched another bubble appear on the screen.
A whoosh of air was felt by all in the room as Rowena raised her hands, directing them toward Dean's back. He stumbled and tipped forward into Castiels arms.
"Rowena," he muttered into her mass of hair. "I've missed you so much." Dean watched with wide eyes as the two embraced each other, gently rocking from side to side. Rowena peeked over Castiel's arm and sighed, patting his back.
“So you like brewing?” Dean asked as he sprinkled rosemary into the pot.
“You—” Sam ducked lower when a fireball flew over head. “Who the hell are you two and why do you have my brother?” he asked, holding the knife to the other mans throat.
"What? What is it, Cas? You can tell me," Dean promised.
Cas takes Deans hand and stands on shaky legs, letting himself be lead into the dark corner of the basement.
“He’s staying with me,” he growled.
“Oh thank God,” Dean breathed out before pulling Castiel close. “There’s another tradition on New Years, too.” Dean raised an eyebrow and nodded his head towards the phone still sitting on the table. It was panning through Times Square showing couples kissing in the streets surrounded by confetti and streamers.
Castiel blinked as the familiars words registered. “Oh, yes.” He stood quickly and went to the cupboard. He pulled out two bowls and grabbed a hard loaf of bread on the way back to Dean.
Dean blinked and shook his head. “Yeah–yeah, ‘course, Cas. You wanna–um, come in. You can—just–come in.” He gestured towards his too dark room and closed the door behind the angel who walked hesitantly inside.
Dean eyed it with and tilted his head. “Is that a new phone?”
him do anything. I---wait. Why am I defending myself to
“Dean?” he whispered.
Dean pays the bunker a visit.
Castiel hung his head. "I'm fine, Sa---"
“Must you do this Gabriel,” Castiel sighed.
“Why do you love me?” She reached up and ran her fingertips down his cheek.
They are the oldest, dustiest, most ancient pair of headphones Dean has ever seen. He tilts his head back and laughs. Hard.
“Wha—what’s going on.” Gabriel sat up and rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand. He yawned and looked around the room, eyes finally landing on Dean. “Castiel!” he yelled.
“Yeah, of course we’re friends,” he waved a hand in the air. “I love her like a sister. But the day Sam met her I knew. I
"Me too," Sam mumbled as he scrubbed a hand down his face. "Dean is not going to like this when he wakes up."
She glanced to Castiel, then her eyes landed on Dean with a smile.
Dean?”
"What?" Cas' eyes finally reached Deans. His words sunk in as he watched Dean walk towards him.
Castiel smiled and picked up the check. He pulled a lighter and his cigarettes out of his pocket and flicked it the lighter, setting the piece of paper on fire. He plucked a cigarette out of it's pack and held it to his lips, lighting it off the checks' flame. He took a long drag and winked at Dean.
Dean turned towards Castiel with a glare. “How do you know my name. Who are you?! And why the FUCK am I naked?”
Dean shook his head and tossed the crust of his sandwich towards the garbage. He groaned and let his head fall backwards when it missed.
“I could say the same for you,” Castiel said in a gravely voice that made Dean shiver. He looked over his shoulder and caught Dean staring at him as he pulled his shirt over his head. He turned fully and took a step towards the half dressed familiar.
Dean sighed and tossed his phone on the couch. He couldn't get his mind off Castiel and his stupidly gorgeous face. He did say that he could talk to him any time if he had questions, so Dean picked his phone back up.
“Do you, now,” Castiel’s voice was deep and sultry. Dean didn’t want to know where he’d learned how to talk like that. He stepped up to the siren, tilting his head. “Sorry, but my boyfriend doesn’t share.”
Dean let his fingers sink into the coyotes pelt. He hated this part of the market, but humans loved their rugs and scarves made of fur.
10:45 AM.
Sighing in defeat, Sam let go of the door and shook loose from his brothers death grip. "Fuck, Dean. Fine," he grumbled, rubbing a hand over his wrist.
“Oh, Gabriel, leave the poor man alone,” a silky voice purred. “I seem to remember you being just as bad.”
"Oh. Thanks, Cas," Dean mumbled, offering a small smile.
Dean just...stared.
"I'm here, sorry. Uh, yeah, I mean, we can meet and...talk. Just kinda wonderin' what this is all about. Not every day you have a stranger say they have a job for you," Dean huffed.
Dean cleared his throat and watched the witch visibly shake. “It’s a banishing spell,” he offered. “Basically, the witch sends the offender to another dimension. Do you need help with that?” he asked, pointing at the jar.
me do it. I’m so sorry.”
Rowena caught the look in Sam's eyes and scoffed. "It is possible for men and women to be close without ripping their clothes off and mating on the nearest flat surface," she chided. "Though Castiel and I
the new Capo Alfie was talking about.
Underneath were giant, gourmet-looking burgers, complete with an enormous amount of bacon.
"But they---," Castiel could hear Deans bare feet pacing across his hardwood floor. He knows Dean paces when he'd worried about something. "They treat you like crap, Cas. It fuckin'
you, angel," Dean almost moaned.
"What?" Dean asked dumbly.
"Oh so you finished the roof? No shingles then I guess." Ellen crossed her arms and leaned against the door jam.
"Naomi is," Castiel sighed, "old school."
Until one night, Sam woke up and padded down the bunker in search of a tall glass of water. He flicked the kitchen light on and gasped. He patted himself down, instinctively searching for a weapon. When he realized he was in his pajamas, he grabbed the closest thing which happened to be a beer bottle. He smashed it against the counter, turning it into a knife.
Castiel smiled warmly and reached up to hold Dean's chin. "You're so---good," he whispered in awe. He pulled Dean closer by his jaw, licking his lips and staring at the younger mans mouth. "I look forward to eradicating that one day."
“Shit,” Dean took a drink of his beer and smiled. “I forgot all about Meg Masters.”
"Fuck yes," he hissed, taking hold of Cas' hair. "Suck my fucking cock, Cas. Fuck. Fuckfucfuc---" he shouted as he felt his orgasm rip through him. He folded in on himself, leaning up and keeping Castiel's mouth pressed against his groin. He reached down and pressed his hand to Cas' cheek, feeling his cock through the stubble.
Sam smiled fondly and scratched Charlie behind her ears. “Come on, Charlie,” he said lifting her as he stood. “We’ve got a ritual to finish before midnight. See ya later Dean.”
“Y–yeah. You can kiss m—”
Dean watched as his friend snuggled down into the blankets, his hair already sticking out in every direction. He sighed and sunk deeper into the bed fighting the urge to reach over and smooth down Cas' hair.
Castiel held him tight, giving Dean everything he could. Adoring, relishing, savoring and absolutely for the first time–loving. He was loving Dean and Dean was letting him.
The witch ran his hand up and down her back with a smile until she released him. “You’re welcome.”
Castiel leaned his forehead against Dean’s, sighing as he let his hands drift down his friends back. “I missed you, too.” Castiel looked up through his lashes, a shy smile spreading across his face. “Dean?”
"So good," Castiel breathed out. "So perfect for me, Dean."
Sam winced and pulled away. "That's not an option." He headed down the hall towards his bedroom and slammed the door.
Castiel's mouth parted and Dean felt a tongue slide across his lower lip. He tightened his grip almost painfully in Cas' hair, breaking the kiss by pulling his head back
Cain barked a laugh. "He never does. That boy can be a real asshole when he wants to be."
"What's he do?" Dean asked, hating the way Castiel's demeanor changed at the mention of his brothers name. "And who the fuck names their kid
Dean rolled his eyes and walked over, taking an empty glass off the bar.
"Is that---did you make a pie?" Dean's eyes widened.
Castiel stopped fidgeting with his coat and dropped his hand, letting the demon intertwine their fingers. He hung his head and nodded.
Castiel dumped their things just inside the room as Dean brushed past him. He shucked off his coat and shivered. "Goddamn freezing rain," Dean huffed as he blew warm air into his hands. Cas tilted his head as he looked around the room.
"There weren't a lot of memories with you in them, but I do remember that" Castiel muttered.
Castiel thought.
you," he growls.
"Consider it done." He ashed his cigarette in the crystal dish in front of him. "Anything else?"
“I’ve been away for so long that I forgot.” He looked at Dean with his eyebrows knit together. “This is our coalescence ceremony.”
“Converterent alica, sic faciam illud!”
His feet carried him forward without his knowledge. His hands felt the angels coarse stubble prickling his fingertips. His heart thrumming in his chest. His throat burned with words threatening to slip out.
Dean swallowed thickly and nodded.
“More complicated then gettin’ our asses handed to us every day ‘n night?” Benny reached up and snapped the branch off and tossed it to the side. “Come on cher, fess up. You got it bad for the angel.” He held his hand up in defense as Dean turned to glare at him. “It’s obvious, Dean. You ain’t exactly subtle. Goin’ ‘round here yellin’ at anyone who’ll listen ‘Where’s the angel?’ and choppin’ their heads off when you don’t get the answer ya want? Look, I get it. Killin’ is necessary down here but, buddy, you’re goin’ straight up feral lookin’ for the guy.”
“November 24th, 2018-
“Oh, little one, don’t worry. I’m sure he’s improved since we last met. Would you mind doing me a favor? You see, I’ve been in this cell for so long and I’m
there. I pulled out my knife and started swinging." He shuddered at the thought and closed his eyes. "We tried Dean. We really did. I got a few of 'em and Bobby did what he could but--" A sob caught in his throat and his shoulders slumped.
His hand reached for the door handle, hating the way it felt in his skin.
"I talked to Cas. You're going to Niagara with him."
“What is it?” Dean rushed over and looked past the moss to see six men in full armor on white horses. One held a flag that had a large silver cross in the middle with a snarling wolf on either side.
“You’re So Fucked,”
They quickly shot apart as the door opened and Charlie strolled through.
Naomi sighed and leaned against the desk. "Castiel, I know you hate me, but could we please have a conversation with you maintaining eye contact?"
Dean shook his head and reached to turn the heat up. "Should'a said somethin', man." He cranked the heat and smiled wide at Castiel. "Can't have my sweetie gettin' chilly, can I?"
Dean nodded along, still watching the couple across the street. "Then she touched your cheek, it turned blue and you lived happily ever after," Dean bobbed his head back and forth, rolling his eyes. Bobby smacked him upside the head and clicked his tongue.
Searing, immense, debilitating pain. His limbs were weak and trembling. His head throbbed, blurring his vision. And
“Please,” Castiel smiled, holding out the flowers, “call me Cas.”
drive me crazy. Never been like this with anyone else,” he whispered.
thought you'd be gay."
When he get’s home, all he wants to do is drink his coffee in peace, and maybe shove his headphones on and blare Zeppelin.
Cain looked back and forth between Castiel and Dean with a grin on his face. "You don't say! Hell, it's nice to meet you Dean. I'm Cain, Cas' step-father." He shook Dean's hand with a wide smile growing on his face. "Cas, here, has never brought anyone home before. I'm so glad you're here."
"But me what?" Dean's voice wavered slightly.
He swallowed hard and eyed the thin man in front of him. "Adam's got nothin' to do with this. He's just a kid. Dick didn't raise him in the life, he doesn't know---"
"Castiel! It's good to see you." A balding man stood and rounded his desk, holding out his hand.
Dean bit his lip. “Fuck. Ok, I’m sorry,” he mumbled, tossing the book onto the bed with a sigh. “I–I found your diary–”
He stood there, shifting from one foot to the other while Dean stared.
Sam crossed his arms.
"I know you want to find him, that's the Winchester way after all. But, Moose, you
Castiel demanded in a low growl that sent a ripple through the hut.
“Well, shit, cher. I didn’t know nothin’ about that.” Benny sat up against a tree trunk next to Dean and let out a groan. “Hell,” he huffed. “Can’t even imagine what that was like.”
"The worst," Dean said playfully, leaning over to kiss him as his stomach decided to growl.
"Michelle," Castiel reached out a hand, "good to see you again. It's been too long."
The man lifted his head slowly. "Damage is already done. It won't matter if you kill me." He turned to Dean and faked a pout. "Poor baby boy, you have no idea what you've gotten yourself into." He turned to Castiel and squared his shoulders, lungs sucking in their last breaths. "Make it quick," he hissed to Castiel.
Dean reached a hand back and squeezed Castiel's thigh lightly, panting as they both came down from the highs. He winced as he felt Castiel slip out of him, only to smile when Castiel peppered his back with soft kisses.
Castiel’s head whipped up, his hand stalling. “You never told us your name,” he accused.
Castiel shook his head. "No. No, she'd never."
of them," Michelle said, waving a hand in the air. "Just Alistair and his closest confidants. Adam may need to be dealt with."
“Yes, it was a wonderful day,” he whispered.
"Cas," Dean pleaded, his eyes returning to their normal green. "Please, angel, make them stop."
With a tug on the elbow, Gabriel pulled his brother to the other side of the room.
Crowley was mindlessly tapping his fingers across the books on the library shelf. He pulled one out and scoffed before shoving it back. "You know, you Men of Letters really should update your archive. These---"
Castiel let out a strangled breath as his chest heaved, immediately missing the warmth of Dean behind him.
Castiel scoffed and rolled his eyes. "Please," was all he said. He opened the shop door and let Dean go in first.
"What---"
It's early morning, the sun is barely over the horizon but it's casting a pale yellow light through the dining room window that Dean has still yet to replace. It flooded the floor boards and stretched over the dusty area rug that a pair of bare feet are standing on. Bare feet that weren't there twelve hours ago.
Dean stood and walked towards the door. He opened it roughly, his knuckles gripping the handle tightly.
"Dean?"
Dean rolled his eyes and shrugged the man off. “You gonna let us know why your dad called us here or just keep us in suspense?”
“Get out, Dean! Get out!” Castiel shouted, walking up to Dean and shoving him backwards. Dean stumbled out of the room, confusion etched across his face as the door slammed in his face.
“Great,” Dean beamed. When he suggested that they test the bonds Castiel was reluctant at first, but with Dean’s incessant pestering, the witch finally gave in. The only stipulation was that Dean had to be in his familiars form because he was stronger that way and could hold out longer.
associates, Michelle?" he interrupted, turning his head over to scoff at Michelle. The other men at the table snickered as they watched Dean stuff his hands into his pockets.
Dean swallowed hard, eyeing a sawed-off shotgun that reminded him of his dad. "Not---not for a long time. Maybe...ten years?"
Sam huffed a laugh. “We’ll be back in a few days anyway, jerk.”
Castiel sighed, rubbing Dean's shoulders lightly. "Let's not think about it anymore tonight. Michelle is coming over for dinner and drinks in a few hours and there's something very important I need to do before she gets here."
Shaking, Dean huffed through his nose. "I'm nothin' to him," he said, voice wavering. "Just a piece'a ass. He'd rather kill me himself than let you run the business. He barely knows me."
"If they're coming for Castiel, why aren't they here already? I mean, they know where he lives right?" Sam scooped up the last bit of his chili with a slice of cornbread and stuffed it in his mouth.
The snow is falling from the night sky and landing softly on the ground outside the bunker while they decorate inside. Dean is reaching up into a corner of the bunker, batting cobwebs out of the way so he can hang a sign that says “Happy New Year!” in gold, glittery writing.
Castiel and Dean work on being a fake couple.
“Is that true?” Sam asked Castiel.
o hours later, Dean is pacing the apartment trying not to sweat through his shirt. He’s dressed Cas’ favorite Aerosmith shirt and his torn blue jeans Charlie said his ass looked “almost good enough to attract a lesbian” in. The apartment is dimly lit with candles on the table and a box of fresh pizza sitting between them. He’s fixing his hair for the tenth time when there’s a knock at the door.
Castiel hung his head and stepped around Dean, standing next to Sam.
“I learned that the first night Dean stayed at my hut.”
“Dean, everyone, this is my sister Anna. Anna,” he held out a hand towards his familiar, “this is Dean Winchester.”
"I'm afraid not, Dean," Michelle said as she snuffed out her cigarette. "And after tonight, you're a part of this now."
"Alright," he said simply.
talked to him like this. Hell, he barely even spoke to him.
"I did what I had to do. You killed---" she swallowed hard and glanced to Dean. "You killed the only thing I ever truly loved," she whispered. The witch holding Ellen shifted on her feet and narrowed her eyebrows. "She was my
"Yes, Lucifer. Boyfriend. Is it really that strange?" Castiel asked as he brushed past his brother and into the kitchen.
They kissed for a few moments, between smiles and light laughter. Dean's arms snaked around the angels waist as he sighed, pulling away gently to rest his forehead against Cas' shoulder.
"I will. And Sam? Take care'a yourself. Don't get lost in tryin' to find Dean and forgeta eat a damn salad or some shit," Bobby huffed.
Castiel nodded again.
The humming stopped and the woods were dead silent.
Castiel's eyes were jet black, his lips kiss swollen and slick. His chest was heaving and his talons were scratching at the denim fabric covering Dean's thighs.
"Bout time," Ellen grunted as she hoisted a black duffel bag onto the dining room table.
“Just what?”
Sam groaned and pinched the bridge of his nose. “You can wear one of your grown up t-shirts or something ok?”
"I do, but he's not ready," she said crossing her arms. "Wait until everything has calmed down and we'll talk then, Dean." Her eyes flicked to the door then to Castiel, indicating that the meeting was over.
Dean swallowed hard and took a deep breath before he opened the door.
"Yes well, then she'd expect me to bring him with me." Castiel frowned as he spun his block in his hand.
"Six! Five!"
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Castiel says around the rim of his cup. He watches as Dean smacks Sam upside the head and plucks a cigarette out of his hand and puts it to his own lips. No one should look so good doing something so disgusting, but hey, it’s Dean. He can make anything look delicious. Smoke billows from his nose as he smiles over at Cas.
"Uh. Hi," he said barely above a whisper.
A grin spread across Deans face. "Hell yes," whispered.
Alistair smiled and looked at the blood oozing from Dean's shirt. "Oh he's right here, but I gotta say, Cas, I'm not sure how much longer he's gonna be conscious."
"So it really doesn't matter," Dean scoffed, running a hand through his hair.
The witch sighed and rested a hand on the side of the doorway. Dean watched his face contort and his shoulders hunch.
“I know what you mean.” He lifted the sleeping cat to his chest and stood from his chair. “I think we should get going.”
"Ell, quit it." Bobby looked up at her over his glasses before taking them off and tossing them on the desk. "I take it you met Castiel?" he asked as he straightened a stack of papers on his desk.
“Redo,” Castiel immediately says.
"Miss you Cas," he whispered, reaching out to touch it. He ran his finger across the man's cheek before sighing and continuing down the hallway.
Charlie blinked the tears from her eyes and sighed heavily as the fog dissipated. She bounded over to the witch and hugged him tightly. “Thank you, Castiel,” she cried into his shoulder.
“It’s alright. Father wont stop sending them until I agree. It’s better to just go now and get it over with.” Castiel held up his hand and signaled the soldiers to wait as he walked back into the hut. He opened a small door and pulled out two shirts and a pair of pants. “Sam hasn’t returned with your things yet. Would you like to borrow this for now?” He held out the shirt and pants to the familiar.
Castiel cupped his familiars face and pulled his eyebrows together. “I know you are. So am I. But I have to do this.”
Castiel bit his lip and shook his head. "I don't know what I did to deserve you. You're so loyal so quickly."
“Cassandra? Babe, where are y—Oh, hey guys. M’I interrupting somethin’?” Dean tiredly rubbed his eyes and walked over to kiss Cassandra on the cheek.
"Need 'nother one over here," Chuck slurred, pulling Deans attention from the check.
“Correct me if I’m wrong, but I thought you were the one who liked things up your ass? I’m more of a top, myself.” Castiel watched Dean’s eyes widen before he let go of the counter and took a step forward. He backed Dean against the wall and braced a hand against it, blocking his roommate in. “What’s the matter Dean? No witty retort?”
“Right now, yes! Can you please leave?” Castiel almost shouted. “I’m---”
The Impala shifted as Castiel slowly slid out.
Castiel swirled the brown liquid before taking another drink. "So, Dean, how are you?"
he thought. Dean
“Cassie, I think this bird might be cursed. I think when you touched it, it infected you, too. We have to get it out of here.” He walked over to the bird and scooped a hand under it.
With her free hand, Lisa brushes her windswept hair out of her eyes and Dean catches the huge diamond on her ring finger glittering in the morning light.
Castiel took Dean's hand properly and held it high, clasping it in his own before snaking his arm around the younger mans waist. He let Castiel lead, and to his surprise, he only stepped on his foot twice before getting the rhythm down. They smiled at each other as they made their way around the floor, very aware that everyone was watching them. Dean didn't seem to care, let 'em watch.
he thought.
Castiel tossed the bowl of glass into a hollowed out stump by the sink. “Have—have you ever been away from Lucy for a long period of time?”
He turned to Dean who was still pressed against the wall.
“Yeah, I got it.” Dean shoved off the counter and headed towards the door. He peeled off his shirt and hung it on a nearby twig sticking out from the wall. He pushed past the curtain and sighed into the cool night air. He looked up into the sky and watched a flock of birds pass overhead. The thought made his stomach ache a little.
“You were patient most of the time,” Cas smiled, looking down as Dean interlocked their fingers.
The clanging sound of metal and screaming echoed throughout the battle field. Both army’s were losing men at an alarming rate, soon to be wiped out completely. The war in Heaven spilled down onto Earth and obliterated most of the northern hemisphere within a week, leaving little time for preparations to be made.
"There's my good boy," Dean smirked, his black eyes wild with greed. Stepping forward, he shoved his cock into the angels mouth with a groan. "What're you waitin' for?"
"I suppose I could just give it to your mother," Castiel tilted his head.
Castiel's breath hitched in his throat as he ran a hand through Dean's sweat soaked hair. "You didn't. This has nothing to do with you, I promise. Everything will be ok." He shifted under Dean's weight and pulled him upright, grimacing when Dean let out a pained moan. He cradled Dean's head in his hands and softly kissed his split lip before resting their foreheads together.
They didn't get to talk. After Dean had the single most amazing orgasm of his life, Gabriel knocked on their door and demanded that they meet him downstairs to "Check out Lucy's fucked up face".
"Cas, it's ok. You're home now," Sam whispered, trying to calm the angel. He pulled away and held the angels face gently. "Do you want anything? Water? You hungry? How about a shower?"
Dean pushed the door open and was bombarded by thumping music and the smell of sweat and alcohol. There were people gathered on the dance floor, writhing to the beat enough to make Dean blush.
Dean pulled away, breathless and smiling.
Dean gulped. “Vaguely. Why?”
“Ladies and gentlemen,” Chuck called out over the crowd. He held a hand in the air holding a silver goblet full of wine. “It is an honor and a privilege to introduce my son, Castiel, the witch of Splitwood Grove and his familiar, Dean Winchester.”
Castiel opened his eyes and stared at the gravel under his feet. "You---," he stopped himself before he could finish. Dean didn't like backtalk. Dean didn't even usually let him talk.
"In it for the long haul," Dean nodded, scratching the back of his neck. "Don't plan on making it a habit of fixing up houses here and flippin' em if that's what you're worried about."
Movement in the hedges caught the corner of his eye. He gripped Castiel by his pants and pulled himself upright, looking off into the patch of woods across the lawn. In the treeline stood a tall figure, the flames from Michelle's car flickering off his face.
"It's our best bet," Ellen nodded. "We'll head out early tomorrow morning and see if they're there."
**WARNING**
Castiel gave Sam a soft smile and nodded. "Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Dean."
The familiar burrowed deeper into the blankets and shook his head, tightening his grip on the witch’s hip. A sharp intake of breath made him open his tired eyes. The first thing he saw was a pair of blue eyes with orange sparks flickering through them. He grinned and pressed his fingers roughly into the witch’s hip as he rolled his hips forward.
“No. No that’s not—,” he wobbled a little before getting his footing. “You take the couch. I’ll sleep on the floor.”
Cas sat the book down and cracked his knuckles. “Now, it’s been a while. Might be kinda rusty. Ok, how about…”
Castiel skated up to Dean as he watched his mother and brother fly around the corner together. "So?"
Rowena and Sam smirked.
“Yes, sorry. Just distracted. Shall we?” he asked, nodding to the TV.
"I help you," Dean finished.
Castiel's hand snaked down Deans waist and made quick work of the skinny leather belt in his way. He plunged his hand inside, trailing his fingers over Dean's boxer briefs.
“We have to. Dean’s in there and who knows what they’re doing to him.”
those things to you. You can't just be ok with it. It's wrong!"
A dark, long haired woman turned around and smiled. "Castiel! Oh, it's so good to see you! How have you been?" She pulled him into a hug and rocked from side to side. "I've missed you! How's the bakery?"
All at once, Castiel's body was covering Dean's, pressing him down into the mattress. Their mouths working against each others messily as Dean's fingers raked through the witch's hair. Castiel rolled his hips against Dean's and gasped when he felt the friction.
"Jesus H Christ, can't you wait a damn minute?" Bobby growled as he opened the door and ushered Dean inside. "Didn't think you'd get here so fast. You better not be speedin' in this kinda weather, boy."
“January 24th, 2019-
"Shut up, Alfie," Castiel growled.
He didn't remember closing the distance between himself and Lucifer. He didn't remember the crunch of his knuckles across Lucifer's cheek. He didn't know Lucifer had landed a punch right on his nose. He didn't realize Gabriel and Cain were trying to pull him back until he heard Castiel's voice.
Cas scowled at Sam. “Yeah. And no grown ups is ‘llowed!”
A smile broke out over his face as he stepped inside.
Dean woke with a crick in his neck. His leg was asleep and he was facing away from the tub, a pale yellow wall staring back at him. He groaned and rolled onto his back, feeling it pop against the hardwood floor.
Dean has an interesting conversation with Castiel and debates his future.
“I can’t do this.” Dean’s head hit the steering wheel as he groaned.
Dean shrugged. "You're off to a good start." He grabbed a waffle and bit into it, ripping it in half.
Dean nodded, trying to his his smile as he slid the refreshed beer to Chuck.
“How. Far. Did you get?” He took step towards Dean.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Dean’s eyes went wide as his roommate held him still and slithered his mostly naked body against his own. Their sweat slicked chests rubbing together made goosebumps rise on Dean’s skin.
Also get.ready.for.touch.starved.Castielllllll omg
He felt Dean squeeze his hands before he returned it to the steering wheel. "Yeah well, I've never seen anything bad in you, Cas."
"Boyfriend." Dean said loudly, just as Naomi walked into the room. "Not just friend."
"Curses, hexes, fucking werewolves?" Dean's voice raised an octave. "And you two," he waved an accusing finger between the two, "hunt them."
“Vodka tonic and a whiskey with a beer back, please,” Castiel purred.
The woman smiled and held out her hand. "Ruby," she purred.
Raising his arm, he wiped his cheeks dry with the sleeve of his shirt and sniffed, trying to regain his composure. He opened his eyes slowly, the floor blurrily coming into view. He turned his head, checking behind him for any sign of the angel.
Gabriel dropped the spoon and stared at his brother. “It’s for a
Dean tilted his head and furrowed his brow. "After what?"
Dean stood and pocketed his phone. “Now or never,” he whispered to himself. He knocked on Castiel’s door before opening it a crack. “Cas?”
was inscribed on the left side with Castiel’s name was written on the right.
My stomach feels funny. I checked in with Sam and explained my symptoms. He laughed at me and said that what I was feeling were ‘butterflies’. I don’t understand. I didn’t eat any butterflies, and if I did, my stomach acids would have dissolved them. I’m going to ask Google what it means.
Dean holed himself up in his room for the rest of the day. Castiel knocked once, letting Dean know he’d most likely be in his room for the rest of the night working. He grumbled his response from the other side of the door as he paced the room.
Dean bit his fingernail anxiously.
Shrugging, Dean smirked. "Shouldn't have fucked with my man," he said, poking Cas in the side.
“Nope. Everything’s peachy,” he snipped, taking another drink of beer.
"Oh--yes. Sorry. Yes, I'll---" he walked over to the car and opened the door. His eyebrows pulled together as he stared at the interior before turning back to Dean, lips pressed together.
"Adam has shown a lot of promise in the past year. He doesn't require too much assistance these days. Besides," Castiel ran his nose over the soft skin under Dean's ear and smiled, "I missed you."
Castiel's breath caught in his throat as he worked his slick hand over his cock. He kissed Dean deeply as he pushed slowly inside, giving Dean time to adjust.
Dean licked his lips and lowered his eyes to the witch’s mouth. Something in his chest pulled him closer to the witch, standing mere inches apart now and Dean’s head was swimming with unknown emotions. His bonding mark aching as it sparked to life.
The maid cleared her throat which made him look up from his paper. His piercing blue eyes locked onto Dean, staring for a moment before folding the paper and setting it on the table. He rose from his seat slowly as Dean tried to remember how to breathe.
Alfie whipped his head to the side, breaking Dean's hold on his face but said nothing.
“She started showing sings of immense power. She got upset with her chambermaid and froze her to the floor. She screamed so loud once that every candle in the castle blew out. The most worrying thing though—”
"Sammy what the hell?" He reached over and yanked his brothers wrist towards him. "Where'd you get that?" He was holding a long serrated knife with something engraved into the blade.
affection. If you're worried about it."
“You don’t know me anymore,” Castiel said darkly. He clenched his fist and watched his sister double over in pain, gasping loudly.
“Yes, a little I suppose.”
"Lucifer's wife. She helps keep him in line, she's a very sweet woman," he explained as he began unbuttoning his shirt. He tossed it to the side and stood, turning to face Dean who was in the middle of putting his sweatpants on. He couldn't help but stare at Dean's bare chest as he pulled the soft cotton over his thighs.
Gabriel poked his head up over the shoulder of a blonde haired man. "Or you could wait for me to respond! What the hell do you want, Winchester?"
“Yeah?”
"Fuck," Dean whispered, admiring the way Cas' eyes sparkled in the sunlight.
Dean cocked his head to the side, watching Alfie's face split into a grin, teeth red with blood.
The day started off fighting with Sam because he forgot to buy coffee. He NEEDS coffee, and Sam knows this. He had to suffer through Sams’ spiel about how “smoothies would be better”, and “you’re too dependent on caffeine”. Says the moose who requires fucking kale to function properly.
"That's my good boy," Dean smiled while returning the gag to Castiels mouth.
"I'm not sure what you eat for breakfast so I had the cook make a little of everything." Castiel took the cover off the tray, revealing bacon, eggs, toast, waffles and fruit that Dean pointedly ignored.
Rowena bowed her head with a smile. "So you did, and we thank you for that."
Before Dean had a chance to speak, Cas moved Dean behind him with a sweep of his arm. He held his angel blade chest high and pointed it at the person in front of him. “Leave. Or you can join your brothers fate,” he growled, gesturing to the bodies strewn on the ground.
Castiel laughed out loud and tossed Dean the towel. He pulled out his wallet and plucked out a card. “Kinbaku. Look it up, then,” he shrugged, “give me a call if you’re still interested in peeling my clothes off.”
"I got ya, Cas," Dean promised, immediately stroking him and rocking his hips into him. He felt Castiel slip his hand under his boxers, carefully gripping his cock. "You ain't gonna hurt me, Cas." Dean growled, jerking his hips forward. "C'mon, baby." Capturing Castiel's lips in another kiss, they stroked each other quickly, groaning and panting into each others mouths.
was keeping me from rising in the ranks. Dick wouldn't dare look in her direction, let alone go above her head. But now," Alistair hissed as he stepped up nose to nose with Dean, gun shaking in his hand, "he doesn't have a say. That pathetic excuse of a man is in little, itty-bitty pieces and tossed over the side of a ship by now. His little bitch of a son is next."
"Cas," Sam sighed. "He can't
Adam jumped in his seat. "Dad, I---"
"She spoke to you?" Castiel hauled Dean upright, hands gripping the collar of his suit jacket. "What did she say?"
So, that's where Dean finds himself now. Behind the bar slinging beers and vodka tonics to bachelorette parties and college kids.
Dean learns what Castiel does for a living.
“Haven’t you ever heard of knocking?” Castiel sighed.
Dean rolled off the couch and onto the floor. He raised his hand and swatted in Cas’ general direction.
“Hello, Dean.”
Gabriel blew a raspberry into the air. "Yeah right. Mommy's golden boy doing something
sorry Dean.”
“We can just stay in here and wait them out. We obviously don’t have to—”
“A little? Cassie have you seen the way you two look at each other? It’s like no one else in the room exists.”
Castiel smiled and licked his lower lip, sharp fangs shining in the sunlight. He shook his head and pushed away from the edge, smoothly gliding across the top of the pool. Dean watched as Cas closed his eyes and flicked his tail, sending water shooting into the air. His human skin glistened in the sun and his hair flowed around his head in a dark halo. His eyes traveled down Castiels' body (because come on, there's a freaking merman in front of him. What's he going to do- not look?) and landed on the spot where skin met scale. He briefly wondered where all his more human parts were when he was met with a face full of water. He sputtered and coughed, pulling his shirt up to wipe off his face.
Castiels eyes darkened as he pulled Deans pants down around his thighs. He bent down and took the head of Deans cock into his mouth, sucking hard.
He scooped his phone off the floor and dug in his pockets, fingers trembling as he dialed.
Castiel shook his head quickly. “No I’m fine, thank you,” he lied. He set the jar down and turned to face Dean. “I have no idea what I’m doing,” he confessed. “I’ve never—I haven’t even fostered a familiar before. I truly don’t know what I’m supposed to do.”
Sam ran both hands down his face. "You're fucking kidding me," he whispered to himself. "It's HELL, Crowley. How can you have nothing?"
on the other end of the phone. "Would you be willing to meet me sometime? I have something I'd like to talk to you about and I'd rather not hash the details out over the phone."
A week goes by, and every night Dean prays.
he loves Castiel. He'd never do what you did. I'm going to get that mark off you one way or another and you're going to spend the rest of your life making it up to Castiel."
Meg raised an eyebrow. “Yeah? And how many of those times involved panties and a butt plug? Oh, Clarence you’re a lifesaver.”
For weeks the army recruited men and woman who were either brave or stupid enough to take on the angels that were desolating the lower states. The war was quickly heading north when Dean Winchester was called into battle.
"I--I'm---" Panicking, Castiel brought the snowball from behind his back and plopped it down on top of Dean's head, smashing it into his hair. He watched as Dean closed his eyes and nodded his head slowly. He ran a hand through his hair and gathered what little snow he could. "Alright," he said calmly. "So this is how it's gonna be?"
Letting his head fall back, Castiel stared at the ceiling and sighed. "Yes. That's what happens when someone is gay. They date men." He rolled his neck and popped the cap off his beer.
“You,” Dean whispered.
Gabriel perked up and smiled. "I did. Isn't he the best?" he asked, lightly punching Dean in the shoulder.
"Shit!" Castiel hissed, bending his knees to try and move with the box.
Chucks hand felt limply to his side. “Your mother was in shock. She asked Amara why she did it. She said she ‘wanted to see a how her insides worked’. Your mother and I thought it was misplaced curiosity—”
Dean gulped down the waffle in his mouth and nodded. "You'd---you'd have to kill them, too."
"No," Dean backed away. "No. You're wrong. That's not---," he shook his head and pointed to the picture of his dad in the Impala.
Castiel bit his lip and tossed the pieces of paper into the fire, watching as they sizzled and frayed. He glanced to Dean, heart immediately quickening when he saw the orange bonding mark sprawled across his chest. It made his matching marks tingle under his skin.
Dean looked up at her and raised an eyebrow. "Uh,
"So what did this guy do?" Dean asked, slinking down in his seat. The tiny Camry had nothing on the Impalas bench seat, but it didn't exactly blend in so he was forced to ride in this piece of crap.
