“Well,” he begins, making a show of placing his cutlery down on the edges of his plate as if he’s about to take them on an epic journey of love. “My darling Jimmy approached me at work and told me that he’d like to get to know me better.”
“I can’t see anything,” Garth answers on a huff, “It’s too dark.”
Over the years, they've gotten increasingly crazy.
? A gun, possibly? Though the microwaves might be able to house a little peashooter, no chance of a Glock or anything of actual use. On top of that, there has to be at least sixty microwaves now along that back wall,
The crowd erupts into cheers again and Dean hands off the mic to the referee right as his opponent’s music kicks in.
“Glad you asked.” Dean quickly refolds Castiel’s ticket to freedom and replaces it in his left ass pocket. Not that Castiel is watching of course. “We want to prove through the use of rapid-scan mobile observations that the traditionally regarded hypothesis of tornadogenesis is wrong.”
“And alcohol too!” Charlie grins, neatly stealing the whiskey. “Since he’s the only legal one amongst us.” And with that she’s dancing off with the alcohol, holding it high like she’s about to perform a ritual.
Do you like scary movies?
Cas goes first with the crowbar and Dean follows straight after, shirt riding up, exposing his stomach, resulting in him getting scratchy twigs snagged on the loose waistband of his jeans (he thought he was flying, he wanted to be comfortable - this is anything
Cas definitely doesn’t miss this time as Dean steps back and he sprays Nick’s body with bullets.

in them.”
Although the road is littered with debris from the surrounding forest, enough areas have been swept clear by the wind that Dean can see patches of gray, cracked pavement. Weeds, wild grass, and even a few saplings are growing in the fissures.
, Dean needs a drink. Or ten.
Not true and not fair; there’s never been anybody but Dean, but Castiel will let it slide, because this is Dean’s moment.
Currently, nobody he cares about is in danger. Which means there’s absolutely no fucking reason on hell or earth for him to venture into this creepy-ass hotel.
“You’re an asshole,” Dean tells him. “That shit ain’t funny, Cas.”
“Anything else you didn’t think to tell me - anything you didn’t think important, Cas? Maybe something related to the fact that you’re taking Nick not being dead exceptionally well.”
Which leaves witness protection or ghost.
. But he only sees darkness.
There’s a split second, a crackle of
**Present Day, The Fucking Rainforest**
Cas curls his fingers into the waistband of Dean’s pants and yanks them down around his knees, letting them fall the rest of the way to the floor. Dean squeaks, then squeaks again when his bare ass touches down on the cold laminate worktop.
They really did pick a hell of a time to finally get their shit together; right before they’re not gonna see each other for a couple of months.
So Dean does as he’s told and climbs into bed with his roommate. Both of them are only in their boxer-briefs this time, and where there was cloth before, this time there’s just miles of overheated, sticky skin. Dean imagines that if they lie like this long enough, it’ll hurt to pull apart.
Before either of them have time to blink, Dean pivots on the ball of his foot and sinks the shine of the blade six inches into Bartholomew’s abdomen, slicing his stomach open as he tries to get away, mouth open around his surprise.
. But obviously not, because Dean’s married and Cas doesn’t wanna be tied down; he enjoys his freedom to come and go as he pleases far too much to even consider staying with Dean.
Nick gestures with his gun, “Kick it over here.”
“So, remind me. Who are these guys?” Dean asks, strolling between the rows of melted slot machines, lit only by the narrow streaks of light slanting down through the ceiling. The whole place holds the smolder of fire and burnt manmade materials. It’s pretty unpleasant and Dean’s mildly concerned that they may never get the stink out, but that’s mostly Gabe’s worry for the moment.
The only reason he’d be going anywhere near his family this summer is purely for Sam.
Dean strips out of his soiled clothes, leaving them in a heap on the bathroom floor. He turns the shower on and steps under the water once it’s at the right temperature.
Goddammit, Dean's gonna fucking
"She’s seen more zombie movies than Leo DiCaprio has Oscar snubs, but no, I'm not willing to take her opinion at face value. Which is why we need to speak to someone, Cas. Figure shit out."
here.”
of yours.”
Castiel turns away, pillowing his hand underneath his head, staring up at the webbing of cracks in the dining room ceiling.
Still, the whole thing drags, not helped by Cas glaring daggers at John for a large amount of the ceremony, unable to take Dean’s hand on what should be a pretty proud day in their lives. It’s dumb, but Dean hates his dad a lot in the moment, hates him for intruding on Cas and Dean’s little bubble, for making Dean remember that there is a world outside of them, and it’s not always going to be welcoming them with open arms.
ruin his wedding day.
that’s obnoxious. “I asked you a question. Why do you have this?”
“Son, I’d do as he says.”
All Castiel wants in return is respect.
“Gonna have to do better than that, man. Is it ‘cause my back isn’t turned? Can’t get in a cheap shot from this angle?”
Luckily, one of his classmates — after all, they
Benny eyes her suspiciously. “I know what I am to you really, Bradbury,” he drawls, fresh out of the bayou, and Dean’s already drawn to this guy’s natural warmth.
Though Dean wishes they could really hammer the point home, by writing ‘I’ll never let you go’ in his blood — the precise shade as the lipstick on the mirror — but judging by the wary expressions on the sea of faces, that likely wouldn’t be well-received.
Dean starts at the very beginning. Where pretty much everything to do with him and his husband stems from; the bedroom.
A first-year anniversary may traditionally warrant paper, but Cas is all about the surgical steel.
The least Dean can do is meet his husband halfway.
Sharp pleasure under his skin like needles, Dean squeezes his eyes shut. Forces himself to focus on anything other than the way the pressure is building all over again, inevitable and inescapable.
Not that he’d be much use for torture. All his brain contains is weird shit like the kinks and penchants of various serial killers. Like BTK’s creepy bondage selfies. Or Bundy’s make-up fetish. No important details like where the nuke codes are.
And if they do, then Dean doesn’t wanna know them.
The next time, it’s Castiel again, and Dean’s dick responds accordingly.
It makes a hell of a noise in the still of the night, but Dean reaches in with his bound arm and unlocks the door. “Problem solved,” he mutters.
Dean lets his head fall against the beam at his back, tipping his face up to the rafters. “Jimmy found out about us.”
“Er,” he starts, chewing on his lower lip. “I’m gonna go to the library before class, so we can talk as we walk, but if not, I’ll catch you tonight?”
“Yes!” Her eyes flash, the green becoming brighter and if Dean didn’t know any better, he’d think that the phrase ‘green-eyed monster’ was coined exclusively for her. “If I can’t have him, I don’t want anyone else to.”
A muscle in Dean’s jaw tics. “Damn it, Cas.”
Dean pushes himself up onto his elbows, kicking his sweatpants off the rest of the way and about to get started by himself when Castiel comes over to the foot of the bed, now relieved of his underwear and wrapping Dean’s wedding tie around his fist like a boxer getting ready for a fight.
“Shit,” Benny mutters, a split second after it’s happened, “Dean--”
“Go!” Cas orders. On the floor above, Chatterer appears, dragging a hooked rod through the drywall, bisecting the wallpaper, snagging photo frames and sending them crashing to the floor. “Close the configuration!”
Before Dean can act on impulse and suck the tip of Cas’ thumb into his mouth, Cas is drawing back, putting distance between them like he knows what’s about to happen and is keen to avoid it at all costs.
“Uh huh. One sec.” Lots of clacking, then, “Brush Creek. Just outside of Riverton, where the old Route 66 runs by.”
He’s gonna look back and see Dean and
His accent is straight outta the Bayou and Dean finds himself warmed by the misplaced chivalry. Not many people have stuck up for Dean over the years, so he appreciates anyone who makes the effort. “Thanks, man. But I got it.”
And if they didn’t? Well, it’s too much to think about right now.
“You invoked us,” Pinhead intones once the nausea-inducing display settles down.
Silence drops like a curtain at the end of a tragedy and everyone stops. The sudden collective attention on Dean burns hotter than the fires of hell.
hard for him. He loves Meg too. Just not in the same way or to the same degree.
, where he never should’ve left.
Dean reaches for the jug-vase, turning it over in his hands. Behind him is silence. No more click-clack of the keys.
Pushing up on his forearm, Cas reaches across Dean to rummage around in his nightstand drawer, hopefully for fuck-me supplies, rather than a moving haiku he’s written about Dean’s soul or something equally tear-jerking-but-not-conducive-to-Dean-coming.
branch out a little and at least give this shit a try.
, am I right, Cas?”
Un-fucking-likely with all the extra booze he drank just to survive the flight. Sadly, they do not have their own jet a la Criminal Minds. What they
Dean chokes on his mouthful of booze, coughing and spluttering into his fist as it tingles and burns down his throat. His eyes water and, if he wasn’t busy dying, he’d be glaring daggers at Charlie.
Cas and Dean only fit one of those three criteria - hopefully, Jason would pass them by.
“We warned you what would happen if you tried to cheat us,” Deepthroat tells them, her voice still the same papery scrape even over the noise.
something, he was the only one who stepped up. Who knows what that fucking psychopath would’ve done if Cas hadn’t put a bullet in him when he did?”
There was a reason for that.

“Suck my dick, Dean,” his usually quiet and unassuming husband orders.
Charlie’s quiet for a moment as she reads. “Uhhhh, according to the report, a father and son duo were out there fishing when they stumbled on Zack’s body.”
of the supernatural, but as soon as things get a bit dicey, it’s easy enough to chalk it up to a bear attack (see: custard monster). But still, people try. And this particular club has been going for centuries, so on any given night, there are plenty of humans attempting entry, only to get turned away.
Charlie snaps a picture.
“We were going a bit far, so I commented that I hoped we wouldn’t get lost. Cas didn’t reply, just kept on walkin’ like he was on a grim parade or whatever. I kept followin’ him.” Benny scrubs a hand over his jaw. “And then he turned around and said that I needed to leave you alone, Dean. I asked what the fuck he meant, but he wouldn’t say. We separated, peed, then I couldn’t quite figure out my way back. The last I saw of him was when I turned my back to piss and heard him movin’ around behind me.”
Whatever he actually wants to do with Dean, 'cause that's the insane part. Who writes "I'll never let you go" except hair metal bands and psychopaths with bad intentions? What is this guy hoping to get out of it?
Does the fact that he flunked an elective or two matter then? Like, really? So his exam results from the winter finals were less than stellar. He’ll just take some make-up tests, or whatever. It’s no big.
I still owe you 32 cents, but we’re getting closer!
As they move away from Cas’ Maserati (because like fuck were they putting fuckstick Balthazar in Dean’s Baby), the blood and viscera slop from side to side of the container beneath a cover of hastily-applied cling wrap.
As far as first kisses go, it’s perfect.
It’s a point of pride, yanno?
She tugs at his jacket. “Dude, come on. The next load of students are coming in.”
But the absolute number one rule is that you don’t break kayfabe. It’s a career-killer. Even if you’ve got a torn pectoral, a broken ankle, fuck, even if you’ve been set on goddamn fire and have third-degree burns, you do
“Who discovered Mcnally?” Kevin asks.
Silently willing Dean to just believe in him, in them, Castiel traces Dean’s jaw with the muzzle, edgy fear in Dean’s eyes, but there’s a ravenous gleam to them too that Castiel more than appreciates.
In the safety of a room he only visits when he's run out of underpants to turn inside out or apparently when he’s having a crisis of conscience, Dean leans against the washing machine, and blows out a frustrated breath.
Skin sliding against skin, feeling the thick stretch of Castiel’s cock inside him with a thin layer of lube slicking the way, Dean’s riding that knife-edge of pleasure and pain, but in the best way possible. It’s hot as fuck, pinned down as he is, rendered completely immobile, caught on his brother-in-law’s dick, the cradle of his tattooed hips smacking against Dean’s ass with every thrust, stealing the breath from Dean’s lungs with the sheer force of it.
Injecting 15 CCs of fluorescent liquid into the young man’s brainstem, Castiel cradles his head.
Jimmy studies him. It’s not as intense as Cas’ all-consuming stare, but it still makes Dean feel like a butterfly pinned to a board. “Okay,” he says eventually, apparently finding whatever he’s looking for in the side of Dean’s face. “Okay.”
Nothing, zilch, nada. Cas doesn’t even pretend to not hear him. There’s no reaction at
When Dean discovered his husband bloody-faced and gnawing on his breakfast, he didn’t dare step closer to assess the mess. Call him squeamish or whatever, but he just stared, slack-jawed, from a distance. Now that he’s up close and gawking down at what was a fully-fledged man a couple of hours ago, relegated to chunky soup and a few barely recognizable body parts, he’s right on the cliff’s edge of an existential crisis.
Dean will never tell a soul that he’s kinda disappointed by that.
He’s up and out of the kitchen in the opposite direction from his son, hoping to hunt down Balthazar and-or Gabriel.
If it turns out that there’s an alien roaming these hallways, trying to assimilate them all, then they’ve got bigger problems.
“You okay?” Benny asks in a low voice.
He receives a bruising pinch for that one.
Sitting at their tiny kitchen table, Cas is writing his practice LSAT answers on Dean’s bare arm.
The door behind tree-man opens and something is whispered in his ear by a monster with scales instead of skin. Again, not even second-glance worthy. Probably a Krasis hybrid.
“Yeah,” Jimmy confirms as Dean enters the living room. There’s a bottle of Jack open on the coffee table, lid twisted off and flung somewhere, no doubt. There’s no tumbler. “I’m surprised he left it behind when he disappeared, because based on my research, it’s worth a fortune.”
Despite his lack of skin, he’s more recognizable now, which actually makes it worse. His humanity marks just how badly he has suffered alone in another realm, making it all that more real and tragic.
Dean retreats to the kitchen to lick his metaphorical wounds.
“Fuck my face,” Dean compromises, “Want you to. Need you to.” Cas has never left him hanging before (outside of edging, at least). He knows that he’ll be taken care of once they get back to the hotel room. Right now, Dean just wants to give Cas as much pleasure as he can, to show him in front of everyone that he belongs to Cas.
Truth be told, he never imagined that shit of Garth. Out of all of them, he’s probably the most loyal, the one least likely to stray.
“Not always,” Cas corrects, sipping at his second cup of coffee. “Sometimes — like in this movie — it’s the ex. Conveniently coming back after years to exact vengeance.”
Dean’s not dumb. He knows that traditional, run-of-the-mill relationships don’t often involve murder and a desire to bury yourself in each other and never come up for air. He knows to a degree that the way he and Cas behave ain’t exactly gonna get them on the cover of ‘Whitebread Relationships Weekly’, or whatever, but they’re not hurting anybody (except those that deserve it), so what’s the harm?
They sit in a pleasant, companionable silence. Despite Cas’ insistence that Dean ruins everything by talking (something Dean proved him wrong about last night), he’s actually content to just exist like this for a while.
Dean sets to work padding the injured appendage with underpants, socks, and the rest of his flannel. He unbuckles his belt and pulls it out through the loops. Then he retrieves the two branches and positions them on Cas’ leg, using his belt to tie everything together.
Realizing that the next set of classes is starting, and therefore the quad is rapidly emptying, Dean turns his rage down a notch, leaves it on a simmering boil. “So apologize. Then get the fuck outta here.” He raises his chin defiantly, hoping that the quiver in his voice is only in his imagination.
Dean pushes the doorbell button, half expecting some Sisters of Mercy to play or Lurch to answer to the door, but neither happens. The bell makes a perfectly average, if slightly out-of-place (and therefore jarring) sound, and the dude that answers it is far from terrifyingly tall, shambling, or lugubrious.
Still. Dean’s not backing down. No matter how badly he wants to roll over and show his belly. “You and Meg. Ever been a little more than just ‘very good friends’?”
Reaching his destination, Dean finds a gap in patrons waiting to be served and leans on the sticky countertop, not quite tilting his hips, but knowing he doesn’t need to in order to get this guy coming over.
about me. Why you were so weird around him.”
Cas’ half-smile turns whole. “Anything for you, Dean Winchester.”
So yeah, Sammy doesn’t get it, even though he was there. But these guys almost do. And that’s why they're family.
Claire shrugs, a curl of blonde hair falling over her shoulder. “I dunno. Everything I know about zombies, I got from the movies.”
“Yup.” Dean reaches into his back pocket, unfolds it. Nick hesitates and Dean slants him a coy grin, “Notarized just like I promised. You gonna come get it or what?”
The one good thing about having — what essentially amounted to — a traveling doomsday prepper for a father was that Dean knew how to handle himself from a young age. It was a skill that proved invaluable for protection against hungry-wrong stares and palms that strayed a little too low under the pretense of guiding him through crowds or moving him out of the way.
“—I know who you are!” Balthazar interrupts, suddenly far too chipper for 3 a.m. But then again, he is in Paris. He was probably up banging some impossibly beautiful chick. Or dude. “Cassie’s told me
“I wish I could tell you,” Cas responds, full of blue-eyed earnestness. “But I have no answers for you right now.”
In a last-ditch attempt to assuage the guilt and perhaps explain himself to a couple of guys who are just as done with all this shit as Dean is, he mutters, "I thought once you got married, you stopped counting the dating ones? I thought they didn't matter anymore."
The thick, wet, nasty sound of Cas fucking Dean’s face, nudging his dick further and further down Dean’s throat, is obscene in the small room. A mix of precome and spit drools down his chin, and Dean’s back to fighting for breath again, breathing through his nose as he and Cas maintain eye contact.
All he’s got weapon-wise is an empty saucepan.
And with that, she sashays away, winking at him before she disappears back inside, leaving Dean standing there gaping after her.
“Yeah, but that’s
He almost face-plants his husband’s softening dick as it slips from between his puffy lips, but he forces himself to roll away at the last second, thanking those same entities from before that he and Cas had the foresight to buy such an unnecessarily large bed.
“How very forward of him,” Amelia says with a slanted smile in Jimmy’s direction.
“You too,” Bartholomew says, hands on his belt.
It’s nine months and eighteen days since the empty took Cas.
For Christ’s sake, Dean didn’t even get his fucking hotel. That’s like, literally the least Cas could have done for him at this point.
Cas’ sheets smell like him, earthy and masculine, and Dean buries his face in his half of the pillow. Behind him, Cas is completely still, barely breathing. Dean can feel him against all the places they touch and it feels like
He’s in his best suit, standing next to Cas in his. They’re waiting in the lobby of a chintzy Vegas hotel to speak to the board of directors of the freakin’ mafia.
It’s dark by the time they pull up outside their house in Castiel’s new Maserati.
As soon as they’re back at Castiel’s room, before the door is even closed, Dean’s crowding him up against the wall, hands in his hair, slanting their mouths together. Castiel moans into the kiss as Dean works his belt open, shoving his unbuckled pants down around his thighs. “Gonna fuck you,” Dean promises, nipping at Castiel’s kiss-swollen bottom lip with the sharp points of his teeth.
Kid’s gotten real savvy since he became God, apparently. Real good at dealing with the Empty too.
Dean’s not ready and neither is Nick.
that handsome Louisiana native? The one you disappeared into the forest with?”
They gather up their things, then trudge past the side of the car. “Where to?” Garth asks, holding a flashlight.
Except for the one taken tonight, when he was leaving the pool with Cas.
Right before he takes a bite of his burger, Cas replies, “Where would you like me to start? With the bullets, the vase, the paperwork, or you telling one of our associates to ‘suck it’?”
“Cas?” Dean catches Cas’ wrist, pleads with his eyes, hoping to convey that it’s okay. Whatever happened, Dean’s here.
Dean can hear the sibling annoyance in Castiel’s voice when he replies, “I did not start it! You did. Poor Balthazar is still finding salt in his clothes, Raphael won’t go near a jeweler, and Michael? Michael’s terrified of mirrors, thanks to you.”
So, maybe Castiel is projecting his own issues, just a little bit. But he can relate to the movie monster, can see why he might be considered a monster himself from an outside perspective.
He has visions of a Jason-style massacre going on outside the car, whilst he carries on, oblivious.
“That’s it,” Cas murmurs, appreciation thick in his voice. “Dean, you’re so — fucking,
to go first?”
Literally or metaphorically.
It’s pretty convenient that Nick knew for a fact that they were gonna be away from the house today. If they hadn’t stopped at the castle, they’d be at the airport now, probably over forty minutes away.
Between the moon and Cas, lunacy is setting in, and Dean finds himself leaning back into this like their years apart never existed.
the early hours and they’re all running on fumes). This is the part of the job that isn’t shown in 42-minute-episodes on CBS.
So, of course, he deflects.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean tells him, all unrepentant sinner.
Still, he’s gotta pay his rent this month, so he schools his features. Feigns professionalism. Best customer service face on, Dean responds, “I see.”
“A loophole of sorts. A back door.
Usually, it’s when you take home a dude with questionable facial hair or a chick who is very obviously already naming the kids she’s planning to subpoena child support for. Often, you ask it when you’re stuck in the kind of dead-end job where a customer tells you to find what’s causing a clunking sound when their car stops or moves — is it the engine, the bearings? (Nope, it’s a fucking bowling ball in the trunk.) Sometimes, you ask it when you’ve done something shitty-and-or-stupid, like cheating on your significant other. And then there are times like now.
On the upside, there’s a high likelihood that they’ll all be dead by the end of the week, so there’s that.
“Smooth,” Dean acknowledges. Reluctantly, he kinda likes the guy.
Something flickers in and out of his eyes when his gaze meets Dean’s.
with you until the end of the fucking line, Cas.”
"Why don't we find out?" Balthazar reaches for Castiel’s waist in an attempt to draw him in closer.
happen – he needs to not fall apart here – so he thanks them once more, and rushes back to Cas.
“Oooh,” the demon uses the tip of the First Blade to scratch casually at its shoulder. “I’m lovin’ the peacock display and all, but nah. I don’t think I will.” It winks at him. “Maybe if you asked me
“Such wit,” Cas declares dryly.
Which is one of many reasons she is not allowed a(nother) car, and coincidentally, precisely why he's not eager to leave his aforementioned clone and his id-oriented zombie husband alone together.
"Are you ever gonna tell me what's goin' on with you and angel eyes or not?"
So Dean’s inkling was right: they were bluffing. Praise be. But also,
“Supposedly.”
Sadly, he doesn’t manifest as a supernatural being capable of gutting someone with a hook, just as an overly-tired gangster’s husband capable of bitching someone out from ten paces.
The phone calls have been getting more and more frequent, and Dean would put it down to the same worry his and their mutual friends are exhibiting, but it’s
“Michael’s been with me since the beginning,” Cas says quiet but firm, not meeting Dean’s eyes, “He’s never been anything other than loyal. He did not deserve to die like that.”
The intensity is back again, and Dean has to look away. Can’t cope with the way Cas is looking
Nick’s stare is so intense that it feels like it’s perforating Dean’s soul, “So you want to play that game, do you -  Who’s had it worse? Do you know what it’s like to have to hide yourself away for
, the owner. Says he’s got instructions to make sure that you sign for it.”
?” He sucks the head into his mouth, reveling in Cas’ pleased gasp, the way his knees cinch around Dean’s rib cage, stomach muscles fluttering. Dean traces one of the thick veins from root to ridge with his tongue, watching Cas’ reaction the whole time. It’s gorgeous: Cas panting, breathing uneven, squirming on the bed, head thrown back into the pillows.
“Hello,” Castiel says, all polite-like, in a voice that’s a good octave lower and a twenty-a-day habit rougher than his twin’s. “Dean.”
“Nothing to fix, Jimmy,” Dean tells him, back turned as he rifles through his drawers for a clean shirt. “I’m not some broken toy or a fucking charity case.”
Dean kisses him again. And again. Frantic little touches that do nothing to convey the emotion behind them.
Cas — a half-step ahead of Dean — stops at the intersection of corridors. “Which way?”
Instead, he silently collects his clothes and returns to Cas.
Dean turns to Benny, who’s relaying some of Charlie and Garth’s recent antics in the hopes of enticing Dean and Cas to start attending horror aficionados meetings more regularly again.
“Another joke?” Castiel sighs.
Cas lifts his head up off the pillow, goes to shake his head, then thinks better of it, says, “No. Thank you.”
Which simply ain’t an option. He’s not losing Cas ever again, and well, he doesn’t particularly wanna lose Jimmy either right now, ‘cause thanks to his dumbassery, they’re on a bigger time crunch, meaning that Dean doesn’t have the time
“Hello, Dean.”
Benny follows after her, leaving Cas and Dean standing shoulder to shoulder. Dean’s the first one to voice what they’re both thinking. “So, this is gonna be fun.”
Bratty and defiant and in the mood to get fucked to within an inch of his worn-thin sanity, Dean tempts fate by saying, “Maybe I will.”
There are a lot of rules in professional wrestling. By kissing Dean in front of sixty-five thousand people, his boyfriend of thirteen years – his husband of five – just broke rule number one on his first night in the biggest wrestling arena in the world.
It’s Garth’s turn to speak, which he does with the wide-eyed terror of every creepy-as-fuck kid in a horror movie. “Dean, look.” He points down at one of the postcards.
“Shit, sorry—” Dean begins to say, stepping back, but then he gets a proper look at the guy, and embarrassment quickly slides into dread.
He leaves the latter on the porch.
to be him.”
irresponsible and dumb. Even for him.
“It’s all right,” she says. “We won’t disturb him. He’s totally out of it until the sun goes down.”
Another good reason they shouldn’t have split up.
Castiel fumbles for his money with listless hands, “Yes.”
The night he spent in Cas’ bed is the best night’s sleep he’s gotten, even before the stress of exams and a fucking stalker got added to his already dire-in-love-with-my-roommate situation. But he’s too chicken to ask if he can climb in with Cas again, ‘cause what if Cas says no?
Done, Dean zips up and makes his way back to the clearing. Cas and Garth are already there. As Dean puts his toothbrush away, Charlie reappears, grumbling about nettles. She sits down on her sleeping bag just as Benny emerges from the trees, sans shirt, which he’s carrying in his hand.
Dean takes a delicate sip of his wine before continuing with his story. “We ended up talking for a long time while I was on the clock.”
The pictures are arranged in the discovery order of each body, oldest to newest. So far, three bodies have been found, but that doesn’t mean there aren't more skeletons stuffed under bridges and dumped in waterways.
It’s kinda sweet Cas was so worried that he ran straight out after their phone call, but if any of Dean’s stuff is missing or their RA gives them crap over it, then Cas will owe him
Claire leans forward in her seat, hands on the salesman’s headrest, menacing in a way that doesn’t take years of practice, just an innate ability to be far too scary for a seventeen-year-old. “—Or what? What will you do, huh?”
Dean follows over pretty much straight away, shaking apart around the orgasm that he didn’t know he needed, slicking his fist and the sheets below with creamy white, all while Cas levels fucked-out praise at Dean’s talented mouth.
Cas lifts his hand away, before bringing it back down a little harder, connecting with a sharp smack.
Cas attempts to soothe away the decade-and-a-half of hurt between them with his lips and tongue, kissing more deeply and pressing closer to Dean,
“Though, I may just search for a new place off-campus and see if I can get a year-long rental. It’ll save the hassle of having to keep moving,” Cas adds, picking at the icing on his second donut.
“F-fuck,” he shivers out, standing in water that covers him up to his neck.
With the scent of Cas curled protectively around him, it doesn’t take Dean a long time to start to feel sleep creeping in around the edges of his consciousness.
The right thing.
Still, he catches Cas’ heated gaze again as he walks backward into the dining room with the cooler so Cas can go forward, and he figures that it’s probably not the craziest decision he’ll be making tonight.
Dean licks his lips, and his voice is small, but determined when he speaks. “Have you ever loved anyone so much that you just don’t care about anything else? You just
Just like you’d assume from a single glance.
So when the guy inevitably approaches with the confident swagger of someone who clearly doesn’t take rejection well, Dean braces himself.
He could probably look it up, the information is public knowledge and easily found, but it’s a mark of respect that he’s asking Dean directly rather than digging around behind Dean’s back. Dean appreciates it. “Four,” he answers. “But we did travel through Kansas a couple of times after that.”
"Maybe?" Cas huffs haughtily —
“How the fuck has this gotten turned around on me?” Benny’s voice goes up at least half an octave. “
. He should probably be a little more sensible, so he rubs at the itch on his jaw, wets his fingers and adds saliva to the blood mix there, making a show of pretending that he’s grossed out by whatever’s caked over his stubble.
“Or to keep us from leaving,” Cas adds.
“I have my moments,” she responds, and, reading between the lines, Dean gets it.
There’s no way that they’re not having thrones installed. It just has to happen now.
“Dean?”
Together, they roll, grasping and shoving until Benny comes down on top of Dean, his shoulder blade catching Dean in the chest.
It’s stupid, but Dean always looks forward to their standing Tuesday night study date.
Still wheezing, Dean makes the grabby-hand motion, and Benny tosses him a beer.
. Dean’s gonna come without a hand on his dick. He can tell it’s gonna happen, even though it’s not something he’s ever experienced before, always needing some kind of stimulation, and he’s almost panicking at the raw edge of pleasure, the pins and needles, the white-hot spark of pain.
“It’s just ‘cause it’s closed to the public, that’s all,” Garth informs them, but doesn’t sound entirely convinced himself.
“Me either,” Garth says, producing another bag of Cheetos from his duffel.
Sam’s not afflicted with the same damage, but that’s mostly ‘cause Dean went hungry so his little brother didn’t.
“...What
Fuck.
but Dean can tell it’s there, “Apparently he’s some kind of delivery driver now?”
“Fuck,” Benny blurts, seconds before he throws a punch that barely connects with Dean’s shoulder. Dean laughs.
“Take it,” Dean prods, leaning forward further, reluctant to stand up in case someone thinks he’s trying to abduct a kid using cheap carnival junk.
Dean yells. A garbled mix of surprise and profanity, as he flails blindly, instincts kicking in half a heartbeat too late to be effective, and he’s pulled inside the changing room.
“What about pushing her down the stairs?” Balthazar says as Dean cuts the engine to the crappy little car because his Baby is just too memorable to take the risk.
He follows the path, eyes darting this way and that, but there’s no sign of either Benny or anyone with a camera at the ready.
Barely anyone notices; just some of the nearby dancing couples, who move out of the way rather than help. Their apathy is actually beneficial in this situation, even as Castiel resents them for it.
Even though every honed instinct is telling him to hide, to not test this man so soon, Dean stands his ground, watching with bated breath and a tremble in his bones.
Jimmy narrows his eyes. “Are you sure? Since the wedding, you’ve been… I don’t know, moping? And now you’re—” He gestures in the air with the slice of steak on his fork. “—agitated.
Dean stays outside for a while, trying to parse out the truth in her words. It’s a fruitless endeavor, because the space his brain uses for thinking is far too preoccupied with simply replaying her words on a loop.
Cas’ mouth twitches into a smile and Dean knows what’s going to happen even before it does. This time though, he has absolutely zero problem with it.
“Maybe it’s a Shining kinda deal? Why she went mad, I mean,” Dean shrugs. “Blood in the elevators and stuff.”
Definitely.
“Fuck,” Dean snarls, frustrated and chastened, “I guess I’d better find that fucking karambit then.”
It’s complicated, because Dean wants to be loved for who he is, but at the same time, he wants to be desired. He wants to feel safe and respected, but also be spanked and tied up. Unfortunately, he has no idea how to articulate that to Jimmy, who balks at the word “ass” and thinks that golden showers are something only the super-rich have access to. Yet, with Cas, he didn’t need to say a word. Cas just
Like he’s both lost and found.
“Hey.”
Though he’d never admit it aloud, it’s become a guilty pleasure of Castiel’s in the last three years.
Shoving down his irrational jealousy, Castiel aims for casual and most likely falls several miles short when he asks, “What about Benny?”
Dean laughs, perfectly psychotic. “Y’know what? I don’t care. I killed one of my best friends tonight. I killed him because there was a chance that all this might’ve been his doing, but now that I know it’s not? Makes no difference. Know why, sweetheart? He hurt Cas, and he was threatening to turn us in for the Ketch murder. So what do you think I’d be happy to do to
“Cas,” Dean catches his fiancé’s wrists, halting his movements, “I’m so fucking sorry about Michael. I know you and he worked together for a long time. He must’ve meant a lot to you.”
Benny blanches at the reminder.
Dead bodies? Surely he would’ve found Cas by now if that’s the case?
There’s probably some in the dryer, but to get there, Dean’ll have to Takeshi’s Castle himself around Amelia.
Returning an awkward, tight-lipped smile of his own, Dean shucks out of his jacket, and drapes it on the back of his chair. He probably should study, but it’s late and he’s tired through to his bones.
“No,” Dean says, but this time, the denial is shakier. “Look, it can’t be him, it just can’t.”
The less he knows about this endeavor, the better. That way, when the court-appointed shrink tries to decide whether he’s an insanity case or not, he can say with complete honesty that he did it for love, your honor. Simply went along with it, ‘cause, well, just look at him with a gun in his hand and Dean’s best interests in his heart, isn’t he just the prettiest thing ever?
Cas doesn’t pay his entrance any mind, effortlessly holding Benny in place against the desk, one hand around his throat, the other pressing a gun to his forehead, expression life-threatening and avenging, fury written into the tautness of muscle and the tic of his jaw.
this place open to?”
“It has to be him, then,” Garth concludes. “I mean, back in college, he just dropped off the radar, right? One day, he simply stopped. Like the Zodiac. And he was never heard from again. So why can’t it be him now? It
Her delicate eyebrows hit her hairline before she relaxes into her fallback smirk. “I know where the bodies are buried. Which brings me neatly to my next point.” She leans down into Dean’s space, alcohol on her breath, the scent of her sickly sweet perfume cloying. “Please bear in mind that Castiel is my friend, and if you do anything, and I mean
“Dean?” Cas says again, coming into the room, blue eyes surveying the pulled-out drawers and empty closet hangers.
Jesus fucking Christ, the guy followed them the whole way round?
summon them? What if we just get the fuck outta here?”
Dean holds his breath in his lungs while they wait for her to leave. As soon as the front door closes behind her, he slings a half-hearted punch into Cas’ upper arm. “You’re a dick,” he says, but he’s smiling.
Usually, Dean would go all green-eyed monster, but he’s tryna be a good boy and not let his jealousy and possibly unhealthy attachment get in the way. Especially not on Cas’ special night. Instead, he spends the night skirting around the edges of people’s conversation, attempting not to let his gaze wander back to Cas.
“The others?” Cas repeats, his expression darkening dangerously, like clouds over California. He puts the untouched coffee on the nightstand, nudging his cell to the edge. “Who? Jo? Benny?”
In the next second, Dean catches the slick sound of skin on skin, of Castiel swearing under his breath as he jerks himself off. Dean wishes he could turn over and watch, ‘cause he bets Castiel is magnificent right now, firm muscles bunching and coiling with every pass over his thick cock, a gorgeous sweat-sheen to his skin, a possessive and triumphant expression on his handsome face.
And friends drag each other to horror aficionados meetings. Plus, Benny did say he should bring Cas along.
. But frankly, none of that shit on Cas’ list is Dean’s fault. If Cas wasn’t a sleep-depriving, taciturn ass, then the bullets, the vase, the paperwork, etc., wouldn’t have happened, and if Zachariah wasn’t such a pompous little prick then he wouldn’t get put in his place.
It’s six months after Cas’ death when Dean dreams again.
“I’ll get the drinks in,” Benny leans in close, scent of earth and iron, “Anything specific you want or should I surprise you?”
He nods, distractedly. Gabriel is almost back to their table with what looks like two large boards of shots. Dean has always cited getting drunk as a good method for alleviating problems (whilst simultaneously creating new ones), so Castiel is willing to give it a go.
Okay, that’s
Dean’s eyes fly open.
“What?”
Since the wedding, Jimmy’s been trying, been touching Dean more, but as soon as Dean gasps with pleasure, Jimmy pulls back, so afraid of being like Dean’s ex-johns, so afraid of what it means to want another man like this. But he’s
Abruptly, the bulb explodes, its filament burning unearthly bright for a split second before it fizzles out and there’s a ‘pop’ in the quiet of the room.
A couple of toilet rolls get left behind.
After that, it becomes a regular thing. Once or twice a month Dean and Cas meet up in a swanky hotel to fuck.
“Charlie never liked me,” Meg replies with a callous shrug, and Castiel hates her. Just a little.
“I brought flashlights, a huge case of water, some beer, an entire cooler of food, snacks, eating utensils, a camping stove... I even brought one of those portable BBQs. I thought of everything. Did you not see all the crap in the trunk when you were loading up your bags at the airport?”
At the foot of the porch, Dean stops, waiting for one of the others to go first and check the lobby for homicidal maniacs. Benny obliges, trudging up the stairs, all Spongebob Suckerpunch-pants in his squeaky, water-logged shoes, followed closely by Charlie with her hair matted flat to her scalp.
count for something, no matter how furious Dean is.
“Call it what you want, but if you don’t start telling me why you’re here and what’s in that truck then I’ll throttle you myself.”
“It’s called gaslighting, sweetheart.”
“Hello, pizza boy!” He leers. He glances down at the small pot of garlic sauce balanced atop the pizza box. “Ohhh, he thinks he’s so fucking funny. Just for that I’m gonna find one of those medieval spells and go thirteenth century on his ass.”
Pinhead smiles. His teeth are foul, discolored and coated in a film of grime. “It doesn’t matter. You must come with us.”
He walks at his normal pace, not following, just… going in the same direction. Even though Dean’s closing the gap between them, the jogger seems mercifully unaware of Dean’s presence; unhurried and at ease.
Cas like this. Fragile and raw. All Dean wants to do is touch him, be close to him, take comfort in him, give him comfort. But they can’t. Not yet.
A series of clangs starts up. It’s rhythmic.
?” Dean retorts, happy to let the guy think he’s got the upper hand for now. He turns his head just enough to catch Castiel’s eye. Even in the low light, the blue is bright and pretty as fuck. “Nobody goes jogging at two am, not unless they’re looking for trouble. Or somebody to murder.”
Eating their food, they start walking to their sophomore class together, Dean — like the gentleman he is — propping the building’s main door open for her as they make their way to room 3110 for their lecture on isentropic processes.
“Plenty,” Dean answers honestly. In his line of work, it’s pretty much a requirement.
They start the trek back down, discovering a few more detailed dick drawings on the way, and, in the grimy corridor beneath the stairs to the second floor, they find some old phone booths, the receivers dangling by their cords. Charlie snaps a photo and then lifts one of the phones to her ear. “No dial tone.”
“So there’s only like an eighty percent chance that the somebody who so thoughtfully cleaned up for us is here right now,” Dean says. “Awesome.”
Jimmy’s wide-eyed, panicked attention switches to his twin. “‘What’s done in the dark will come to light’,” Jimmy quotes, visibly clutching at straws in lieu of the nearest bible. “This is what you deserve, Castiel. This is what God thinks you deserve.”
Dean pulls away, tries to catch his eye, “You okay? I’m sorry for bringing it up, I just—” he cuts himself off, pauses, regroups. ‘Cause, this needs a little more finesse than his usual bull-in-a-china-shop approach. “You mentioned once that they’re the reason you know what to do when someone’s having a panic attack, and I dunno. I sensed that there was a story there.”
Which is strangely appropriate.
“Err, guys?” Dean says. “What the fuck are you talking about?”
Dusting off his hands, Cas pushes to his feet. He gingerly steps over Balthazar to come face to face with Dean. “I know this is difficult and I’m sorry for putting you in this position, I really am. But I have to believe that you’re with me in this.” He pauses, looking away and swallowing hard. “Your first concern was for me getting caught. It didn’t even occur to you to turn me in to Jody.”
That wasn’t quite how it turned out.
“More than humans are capable of handling.” Castiel intones gravely, though Dean watches as he tilts his head, twin flares of blue narrowing as he considers something, as he considers
“How did you find us?” Cas interjects before Dean can get to grips with a suitable comeback.
Jimmy doesn’t say anything for a long moment, seemingly weighing up his options. He’s subdued when he says, “I know something’s going on, Dean. I’m not stupid. I just thought that— I thought that with the move, we might be able to start again. Whatever you were up to in Chicago might not follow us here.”
It’s apparent that Cas is starting to fray a little around the fringes when he insists, “You didn’t tell him that. You promised—”
“When he touched down in Illinois a couple of weeks back. He didn’t say anything about the box to me, the sneaky little fucker. Probably knew I’d tear him a new one over it.” The line crackles as Balthazar blows out a frustrated breath.
regretting dragging his heels about hiring a professional, because now he’s the sucker who has to clean this shit.
She looks at him like he’s stupid. “I don’t like it.”
“We could find some help,” Benny wheedles. “There’s a chance that we could find a phone or somethin’.”
Most of Dean’s decisions are made by three body parts: his dick, his stomach, and his heart (usually in that order). The last one has fucked him over today and his dick ain’t exactly got the best track record either, so it’s time to listen to his stomach.
Like he’s stuck in some time loop from fifteen years ago; perpetually twenty-six, even though he’s forty-one and his left knee creaks when it rains.
Tyrus looks pained, “So you’re not gonna help me?”
After all, this Christie-style denouement
, is it hot, the command lodging somewhere deep inside Dean, making him flush all over with arousal.
“Your boss did all this...for a
He slides his thumb across the screen, leaving crumbs in its wake. “Cas?”
It’s the worst-best thing, Castiel’s skilled tongue inside him again, fucking Dean into incoherency. It feels amazing against the raw jangle of his post-orgasm nerves, but it feels awful for the exact same reason.
A bear, maybe.
It’s nothing but fucking and everything but fucking.
“Right. Yeah. Okay,” Dean chokes out. “I’ll um, leave you to it. Sorry.”
The clean-up this time is easier. Cas has been thoughtful and dismembered the corpse so that Dean doesn’t have to wrestle an entire body into trash bags.
Because they burned all those photos. Along with Arthur Ketch’s body.
It’s not like he’d listen anyways.
The seed is planted, and Dean nods, numbly. “Yeah.”
Doesn’t mean it’s not soul-crushing when there are no new notifications.
(Oh, and the icing on this multi-tiered shit cake? Turns out, that pearlescent puke had been dripping from the sinks too, right down the back of Dean’s shirt collar during his emotional scene with Cas’ body, and
His fist stops mid-air, knuckles red.  A muscle in his jaw tics.
It’s not new information. From the ligature marks on the other victims, they’ve known that the copycat is killing the victims where he leaves them, rather than killing them elsewhere and dumping their bodies as John Winchester did.
Jo looks like she wants to smack him again, but counts to ten and thinks better of it. “Fine. But you’re calling him right here and now. I want to make sure you actually do it.”
“It’s okay,” Dean manages around the lump in his throat. He swallows it down, along with the tattered remains of his stinging pride. “I’m just gonna go. I’ll catch you later, alright?”
Nobody’s speaking in the boardroom either, so for a long moment before Dean opens his eyes again, he’s of the belief that God might’ve actually stepped in and smote - smited? smitten? - everyone else in the room.
Dean arches his back for more, harder, deeper, as Cas’ fingernails sink into the flesh of Dean’s ass like he’s searching for bone. Tears tracking down his cheeks, Dean’s orgasm is wrenched from the recesses of his soul, and he comes, spurting over the wall, raw edge of pleasure and clench of muscle agonizing as his balls draw up tight, not a hand on his dick.
Yep. It sure fucking is.
But then the elevator doors open to a couple intertwined so tightly around one another that they may as well be one person. They spring apart when the doors start to close again, the pair of them flushed and giggling and obviously completely smitten.
Cas does the same, and together, they begin to move it. But in their haste, a half foot or so away from the hole, the container tips over onto its side, and with the flimsy cling wrap being absolutely no barrier at all, Balthazar oozes out onto the ground.
He probably won’t. It’s much more fun to watch Cas do it.
And dear death too, 'cause this is gonna be a petite mort to remember and wet dream about for the foreseeable future.
Dean can see the soft bulge of Cas’ cock in his clinging underwear and he wants nothing more than to lean forward and repeat their earlier encounter. He doesn’t, obviously, ‘cause whilst they’ve done this exact thing in less-than-ideal places, somehow when Cas is injured and there’s a maniac loose in a deserted hotel, it feels perhaps just a little
Luckily for Tyrus, he barely even blinks, just shakes Dean’s hand as well. “Nice to meet you, Dean.”
Benny’s brow creases. "He's not with you?"
“I know you’re in here,” Dean says, ironing the tremble out of his voice as best he can. “Show yourself, whoever you are.”
“Fuck you,” Dean says and means it wholeheartedly. And then he’s stalking off to hide somewhere because there’s absolutely no way that after that performance he isn’t going to get kicked off the show.
Either he’s some kind of superhero, in which case, why isn’t he in downtown Manhattan right now instead of laid up in a hospital bed, or he’s incredibly fucking lucky.
He thinks about Jo’s last moments a lot. What did she see? What did she feel? The cops have yet to track down the driver who plowed into her at seventy miles per hour in a thirty miles per hour zone.
Blurring the boundaries like only they can, Dean blurts it all out as Cas fucks him hard enough to jar his bones. “I love you, Cas, I love you so much, I’m sorry.”
It’s why nobody else could even hope to understand. It’s why being here, where there’s no distractions, nothing but
“Gabriel,
is how Dean should respond in the face of such weighted honesty. But instead, he hurriedly shoves Cas’ shirt at him. “I’m just gonna…err, grab some clothes for myself. Be right back.”
He won’t be able to forget anytime soon. “Yeah.”
“What’s going on?” Dean asks, clutching Castiel’s shoulder as he casts a glance sideways, catching sight of Garth sprawled out face down on the floorboards, slack expression turned toward them. He lets out an anguished-sounding sob. “Jesus fucking Christ,
It certainly
Staring at Dean’s chest, Cas seems to be considering something. Dean’s about to remind him that his eyes are up here, but before he gets the chance, Cas is pressing the ice to Dean’s left nipple.
Apparently, the interaction was enough for his stalker to deem it an affront to his claim on Dean or some such shit.
“Hi,” he says again, trying to quell the knee-jerk panic by leaning into the knowledge that Cas is barely fifteen feet away from them.
Dean was gonna punch Balthazar in his smug, European, trying-it-on-with-Dean’s-husband face.
Dean picks up a decimated bag of chips. The remainder spill out onto the floor, “Who the
Cas’ half-smile is sharp-edged and beautiful. “No, you didn’t.”
“Another three, maybe.”
, somehow. In a way that killing Ketch never did.
Holy shit, Cas is a fucking vamp. And not the blood-sucking variety either.
A hot spike of jealousy goes through him. Even after all this time.
Dean used to consider that one of those schmaltzy, Hallmark-type sentiments that romanticized relationships forged through a college roommate algorithm and a shared passion for destroying your liver in the most creative ways.
“Don’t shower,” Castiel murmurs, stroking under the curve of Dean’s ass. “I want you to feel my come on your skin when you marry my brother.”
He’s eaten through all the meat Dean bought last night, but each mouthful became increasingly less satisfying than the last.
And then there’s nothing but a yawning chasm of disappointment ripping open in his chest. ‘Cause everything is exactly as they left it. No Cas or Benny.
— Dean’s a jittery, caffeinated mix of confidence and nerves as he heads upstairs.
It’s still too early to request that the victims’ families come in for an interview, so instead, they call up Charlie to find out what she can. Which is nearly always more than the families either know themselves or are willing to disclose.
Which means that he ends up internalizing his messiness. For the intervening six days, Dean wavers between excited nerves, terrified nerves, and excited terror. He wrestles with his conscience, wondering what the hell he’s doing; he’s not a cheater, never has been, but Cas is everything he wants, everything he needs. Jimmy… well, Jimmy had Dean to himself for eighteen months. If Cas had been born first, met Dean first, things might’ve been different.
Dean hurries after him, catching up and they walk side by side up the stone steps.
Because Cas truly is the love of his life. There’s no escaping that.
Behind him, the fire crackles, casting everything in a hellfire glow. The shadows on the support beams jump in time with the flames, flitting over the well-worn floorboards, walls and ceiling.
“Of course, Dean,” Cas says and his eyes glow that ethereal blue, burning brighter and brighter, until it fills Dean’s vision and that familiar high-pitched squeal rings out, crescendoing into something that feels like it’s gonna burst Dean’s eardrums at the same time as the blue blinds him. Cas’ voice is gravel-rough and strained around the edges when he orders, “Close your eyes.”
Dean tries not to think of Cas upstairs, doesn’t wanna run the possibility that these chucklefucks are telepathic on top of everything else. It’s no use though; his mind is consumed by Cas’ injuries, the pain he described being put through again and again, all in the name of some higher experience for these world-hopping assholes.
“Well, I can assure you that we offer top-tier service. It would be unwise to settle for anything less than the best in these circumstances. You wouldn’t want to end up with a botched job.” He leans forward in his seat, stage whispers, “Some of these other more established firms are resting on their laurels if you ask me. Their customer service could certainly do with a little recalibration.”
Dean brushes the crumbs off his shirt and lap, onto the floor, where Miracle is more than happy to play vacuum. He slides off the bench seat, rises to his feet, glancing around, bracing for Lucifer to pop out at him.
“Like he was watching you. Watching
“Just in case anyone’s watching,” he explains quietly, “we’ll make it look like we’re actually leaving.”
Warmth sprawls in Dean’s chest. His grin aches on his face.
“Lisa yelled it at me as she was tossing my shit out of the bedroom window.”
“Dean, Cas!” Jody’s voice is closer now, maybe a couple of steps outside the kitchen door.
Garth pulls the Grand Cherokee into the lot and cuts the engine. Benny immediately swings his door open, and everyone else follows suit, glad to be out of the claustrophobic space after such a long drive.
“Uh-huh.” Dean says, “Figures. Well, he cheated on me with practically everybody within a five-mile radius. His sous chef, the busboys. I don’t think there was anyone at his restaurant who hadn’t had a taste of his dick as well as the gumbo, so y’know,” He shrugs nonchalantly, “Maybe his opinion about me ain’t exactly the most reliable source. Considering he seems to have twisted it in his mind that I left him for Cas, which no. Me and Cas was just a happy accident. One actually brought about by him stealing Cas’ money. I won’t tell you the whole
“No,” she agrees, taking a sip of her drink. “You just never agree to meet up in the first place.”
Dean’s pretty sure he’s the king of it at the moment.
A cheap thrill zips through him at the thought. Something primal in him is screaming
For any legal concerns, please cont-
Dean counts to three before he swings his flashlight around the doorframe.
“You fucking
Dean feels his eyebrows hit his hairline. He doesn’t even wanna know how their adorkable son who has ducks on his jim-jams knows that shit. Cas, however, apparently does. “What do you know about it?”
Meg fills in the gap. “You’re just digging for information on him because you have no respect for his boundaries?”
All these sensations, so much sensation. Dean’s never felt this much, never been
He hasn’t told Cas yet because he’s still struggling with the spaces between the stilted words they’re barely saying to each other. An awkward ‘hey’ here, a self-conscious ‘will you be needing the room tonight?’ there.
It’s not
Charlie isn’t due to arrive and pretty him up for the big day for a couple more hours and Sam’s expected even later, with the rings and transport to the venue.
“Being dead makes you horny, huh?” Dean jokes, and yeah, it’s probably too soon, but instead of scolding him, Cas fucks past Dean’s lips, crown of his cock bumping along Dean’s soft palate.
“Please,” he begs, voice breaking over the word, “Gonna come, wanna come when you’re inside me.”
. There’s gotta be a way out of this. Even if the Cenobites really don’t know about Cas’ escape, it’s only a matter of time before they do. And then? They’ll drag Cas back to whatever hell dimension they’ve stepped out from. It’s not definite, ‘cause like Cas said, who knows whether they can chase down escaped prisoners without the usual invitation via puzzle-solving. But it’s not like Dean can ask  —
Which begs the question: just what are they raising money for?
On his way to grab some lunch, Dean pays a quick visit to their gun cabinet.
It turns Dean’s crank like nothing else.
“Cas...I can’t, okay? I just can’t.” Dean’s thin voice catches at the end.
There's a rumor about the dude who lives at the top of the hill in the old Novak house.
“Yeah?” Benny seems pleased to hear it, but then his expression drops a little when he catches sight of Cas’ palm casually resting on Dean’s thigh. “You were both at that party last night?”
Dean feels fundamentally changed. As though there’s a black spot on the core of his being, seeping into the fibers, a stain of red wine that’s slowly baking in until it’s just
There’s a small sound at the other end, a shuffling. Dean can just about make out the low murmur of another voice in the background. “You’re the only one who calls me that.”
— and so Dean frets in silence.
Castiel blinks, surprised. “Well, yes.”
Again, things could be better.
Which is at least half the point. Whether the bigwigs and bosses know it or not.
“You two have a lot to talk about,” Dean says with a shrug that suggests equanimity, even though the hands behind his back are shaking. “Can’t have either one of you leaving.”
Fuck. Dean wanted to lick it off.
out of his husband on occasions when he gets really heated about watercress sandwiches or whatever. Abruptly, there’s a click, and Dean’s eyes open to the sight of the puzzle box in Jimmy’s hands, halfway to being solved, enabling him to slide a part of the box open, revealing new intricacies.
“I’ve killed many angels,” Castiel tells him, impatience growing along with the steady hum of his incredible power. This thing should be terrified, should be crawling on its knees, begging for forgiveness. But it’s not. It’s watching him carefully, not awed, not scared, just… curious.
Instinctively, he sprints out of the clearing toward the voice, branches scratching at his arms as he shoves through the trees and springy saplings. The beam of the flashlight darts everywhere as he jumps and pushes on, most likely signaling to anyone watching precisely where they are, but he can’t bring himself to care. He just needs to get to Cas.
‘CALLING ALL HORROR AFICIONADOS
They show their faces at a couple of horror aficionados meetings, but it’s kinda awkward; the atmosphere heavy and tense with things unsaid. Charlie is overly nice, like a 1950s mom tiptoeing around their shared psychosis; Benny frowns whenever Cas leans in just a little bit too close to Dean (which Dean writes off as Benny being grossed out by them); and Garth puts his foot in it by exuberantly saying, “Hey, it’s nice to see you both — it feels like you’re too busy for us these days!”
He walks aimlessly in the stream of people outside, following the backpack in front of him, wandering past the siren call of the takeout places stuffed full with hungry students.
It buys Dean enough time so that when they pull apart, hand over Jimmy’s heart, he explains, “You said it was your mother’s, so I was going to surprise you by having it professionally deep cleaned.” Dean’s got a bag of tricks, from when he, well, used to turn tricks. Such as the perfect pitch to talk a client down from a ledge. “You ruined the surprise.”
Cas considers this, “One of our gun cabinets isn’t far from here.”
Castiel would beg to differ.
Dean makes a choked sound, but doesn’t dare move. He holds his breath, waiting to see what Cas is gonna do next, flinching with every touch to his overheated skin, sweat trickling down his sides.
Jimmy’s expression crumples. “Dean, I—”
“How very late-stage capitalism of you,” Dean mutters wryly.
Because he just can’t lose it. He can’t lose Cas.
Cas switches the song off with an irritated flick of his wrist, right as Dean’s yelling out, “Let the chaos reeiiiiiiignnn!” which are the
Yeah, Sam’s got a girlfriend again. The first since the mutually-destructive disaster with the vet, and Dean’s both proud and pleased. Even as his heart aches for something he'll never have.
“We keep this up, we might as well sleep on the front fucking lawn!” Dean calls after Cas in a harsh whisper-yell, but he gets no response.
“I’m all packed up, so I’ll sort out the hotdog water,” he shakily tells the others, as he pushes to his feet, not waiting for any responses.
