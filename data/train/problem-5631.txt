The pounding in his head is getting louder and louder, his eyes are hurting so bad, he’s still aching all over, he’s hungry, he’s
“What?” he mutters, completely out of his depth, feeling breathless all of a sudden.
“He kept me alive, for one. You’d think for someone who was so adamant in killing us he would have done it at the first chance he got. I was vulnerable.” Natasha muses, echoing Tony thought’s so closely it almost makes him break out in hives.
(You know I will.)
Tony’s steps are unsteady and his body uncooperative, even if with each step he takes, his blood begins to flow with more force to his unused limbs, his lungs getting used to the odd air inside de building, his hold on Nebula’s shoulders more certain than limp by the minute. It’s like his entire being is restarting after shutting down unexpectedly, and he should feel better—
“Not everyone.” Thor mutters. “He could have killed me, but he didn’t take the chance.”
“Bring him another one. He’ll like it.”
Tony takes in a deep breath, clearing his throat.
Steve has never been to Tony’s workshop before. He approaches it with cautioned steps, like he’s intruding, when he finally reaches the bottom of the stairs and witnesses something he’d never seen before.
The next morning, there is a little sunlight.
And it is,

A friend?
Rogers shakes his head. “Something called the Outriders. Gigantic ships of them. We were in a tough spot, but we could hold them. And then suddenly… This huge alien steps off a portal with a Gauntlet in his hand, and he goes through us like we’re invisible.”

He cannot trust SHIELD as he once did.
“Look.” Bruce starts. “What happened to you out there—”
And before any of them can ask him
Not if, when.
“I know.” Steve replies, just as softly. “That’s why I’m here.”
And it does.
“That’s right.”
“He didn’t. He knew he would get it back.”
, falsely arrogant, and Steve smiles as he leaves, looking back behind his shoulder, and the sight of Tony
The mention of Tony’s name makes Steve’s chest ache, unpleasant and uncomfortable, the phantom bird trapped inside his ribcage hitting against the barriers of bone, its wings flapping wildly in frantic despair, afraid of a threat unseen but unable to escape.
She doesn’t know.
He can’t sleep.

still is a little bit in love with Steve Rogers.
Tony snaps his head to the side in a reflex of suppressing his flinch – but not fast enough that Rhodey doesn’t catch it.
“You made me an armor, Tony.” Pepper argues. “Isn’t that what that was? The armor that came for me in the hospital? An armor, for me.”
But Steve’s not stopping. So Tony isn’t either.

But the reality is much harder to accept when it arrives. To be faced with the necessity of it, with the obligation of
Steve doesn’t want to speak.
“Where’s your boss?” Tony asks, because if no one else will,
He swings his legs to the side of the bed as awkwardly as a plastic doll, limbs locked with the unpleasant, fading sensation of muscle cramps, his bones heavy and balance altered by his unnatural posture. Nebula is forced to help him up again, ducking a little so she can wrap her hand around Tony’s wrist and pull it over her shoulders, her other hand wrapping around his back and settling right below the line of bandages across his torso, steadying him with almost military precision. Seeing as Nebula broke the heart monitor, the only sound echoing through the hall is Tony’s harsh breathing, the grunts that escape his lips when his sides ache just a little too painfully, his body too cold not to protest with the strenuous movement after so long just laying still.
“I’ll try my best.” Lang says, with incredible sincerity. Deeming this his opportunity, he stands, and shuffles with difficulty past Nebula and Rhodey, who have not backed off from their places; and with some adjustment, escapes to a more favorable position in front of the brainstorming board. “So what are we looking at?”
“How does that help us stealing the stones from Thanos? He’s got all six.” Rocket bitterly complains. “Are we gonna get them one by one?”
Daughter, huh.
Now it’s all what?
It’s true.
“We will.” Tony assures. “FRIDAY is working on finding surviving SHIELD agents and bringing them all to comms. Aren’t you, FRIDAY?”
(They have a limited water supply.)
“I made pancakes.” Steve says, after an unbearably long time, turning around with a plate

He might not sleep at all.
“No.” Pepper softly interrupts, placing a hand on his wrist. “You need to go upstairs. Thor said he would be back soon. They’re gonna need you there.”
Nebula to talk about something that isn’t all the horrors Tony is imagining he will find outside. “How didn’t you get attacked when you showed up, with me dead on your arms?”
Barton doesn’t argue, which is thankfully more civil than Tony would have hoped before, especially when it came to defending Wanda, but he does say, “You didn’t seem to mind fighting next to her when Thanos came. Or Ultron.”
“Where did he take you?”
Just more collateral damage. More and more and more, more casualties, more guilt, it never fucking
“Not when these Stones are concerned.” Thor shakes his head. “I don’t believe that. I saw him, I saw… I saw enough to believe what Maximoff showed me was more than a simple trick to defeat us.”
He doesn’t know what has happened to the world, outside this small, silent, fake shell of protection Nebula has crafted for him.
The others still haven’t said a word.
The questions come up all the way to his throat again, squeezing his airways, flooding his mouth like alcohol bubbling up his stomach, but they never truly leave his lips.
He can’t grip Nebula’s shoulder any tighter. His fingers are so
“We all hurt each other.” Steve justifies, sorrowful.

, at least.”
Jarvis’ whole body sags a bit in relief, and he repeats, his voice dripping with emotion. “Thank you, Ms. Carter.”
“You want honesty?” Tony asks them, voice rough and snappy, raw, the words clawing his throat in resistance all the way up from his lungs, but he forces them out anyway.
He only wants to
“…Eight?”
This is not a fight. Pepper is simply… She’s just
But FRIDAY has no answers for him. Neither has Nebula. Either of them has answers.
“’HYDRA will rise again’, he told me.” Ms. Carter said, looking at a far away point in the horizon, her face turned to the window as if she was in deep thought. “And he believed those words when he said it.”
He won’t pretend he understands what exactly goes between Wanda and Vision, and what kind of feelings keeps bringing them closer to each other.
Howard is giving her a tiny piece of her baby back. To keep safe and hidden, so no one can hurt him anymore.
He doesn’t look up, but he can feel the others moving. He can feel their stares. The sensation is similar to a thousand needles poking his skin, sharp and shallow,

And every other night, they fall into bed together.
Steve averts his gaze to the floor, trying to be discrete with the way he shuts his eyes tight and groans, forcing the invasive thoughts away with such force he feels physical pain.

(Huh.)
Tony doesn’t know how to wait. How to sit still. Even when the situation is dire and nearly hopeless, and sometimes it
Nebula mutters something that sounds awfully like
He doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know how, because he wasn’t there. He imagines Pepper inside the gala, alone, beautiful in that blue dress, like a work of art made living under the soft lights, and he thinks of her, waiting worriedly for him when he never came back, taking off back to the workshop after Obie –
“You got it.”
“Yes.” It’s all he can say, because he has no other words to describe whatever the hell is this mess growing inside of him like a volcano about to explode.
“Is there any way to knock him out?” Lang inquires, looking at every single one of them expectantly.
“We need to close your wound.” Nebula says, voice low and pensive, carefully analyzing the stain of blood that has seeped into Tony’s shirt; Not big enough to be a concern, but still possibly dangerous. “Where is your medical equipment?”
The elevator reaches the entrance floor with a smooth movement, a noise so sleek when the doors open to allow them passage that it’s almost inaudible. They don’t need to go far. They find Thor standing on the entrance lobby, halfway to Natasha, who is standing by the lounge’s entrance with a look in her face that seems a little too scared, a little too distressed, and Tony nearly asks her why out loud, before he realizes that in his hand, the one that’s not holding the axe, Thor, in his armor, just standing there in the middle of the lobby, has an enormous

“It’s no matter, Captain.” T’Challa nods at him, taking a step back and putting some distance between him and Natasha, putting his hands behind his back in a relaxed manner. It’s clearly on purpose; He’s trying to make himself look as unthreatening as possible, which is probably for the best, because Steve and Natasha are both acting like cornered animals, ready to throw themselves at each other’s throats at the slightest chance. “Miss Romanov and I were finishing our conversation.”
That sort of thing tends to put things in perspective. Time included. So time, time is something Tony understands, in some levels, but

He deserved it, he supposes. It’s not like this just happened to him, unbidden and uncalled for, because Steve can pinpoint exactly what were the choices that he made that brought him here. He can count them all, and he can tell exactly where they overlap and where they turn into a goddamn snowball, just piling up on top of one another until it exploded into this mess. He’s not ignoring it anymore. He can think about it, clearly and unmistakably, and even if it’s not

And maybe… maybe I should have read the damn document I did that for. I should have. But I didn’t, and now it’s done, whatever, but if I have
He brings it home. Puts in the west wing study, the one which has been mostly empty for the last few years, forgotten when Maria’s plans to build a study for Anthony fell through. He makes sure no one will see him arrive. In a couple of hours, he rearranges the house’s electrical circuits, makes sure the whole thing is safe and absolutely impenetrable, and builds it back up around the centerpiece. The star of the show.
“So what makes you believe this might be true?” Rogers lowers his head, the motion somehow making his gaze seem even sharper, even more piercing.
(Half machine.)
As they board the Quinjet, Tony slips back on his glasses, sighing in a small sensation of relief when FRIDAY’s voice echoes in his ear, proper, determined and familiar, and he resists the urge to rub at his chest, especially when Nebula is watching him like a hawk all the way to the boarding site.

“It’s…” Tony gapes, feeling horribly exposed. “It’s not like that, with us.”
All Tony has to draft comparison are the years of alcohol-induced haze, and the shame he pretends he didn’t feel the next morning, even though he couldn’t remember doing the things he did.
“You told them?” Tony asks Rogers, half in surprise, but with an edge of sharp judgment sneaking into his words without his permission.
And Tony broke them too. Natasha made sure Steve remembered that. The very presence of Tony in that bunker, the fact that he came to them, weapons lowered, voice soft, open heart— he broke the Accords. Because he knew Bucky hadn’t been the one to blow up the UN conference in Vienna. He came to make things right.
Tony groans harshly.
“Yeah.”
Tony squeezes his eyes shut.
But Tony will never say a word. He will never say anything that will help Bucky go free. Much like the rest of the world, Tony has gone silent in face of what it is left of them, raising his walls so high that no word on the subject will even pass through his lips. All that Steve has heard of him is about the Accords, about the future for the Avengers, about Spiderman or War Machine or Vision or Iron Man. Never about the rest of them. As if Tony can’t bear the thought of speaking their names anymore.

Even with Sam’s help, even after Bucky’s face had been recognized by some bystanders during their fight on the highway and his name was being mentioned all over the news, Steve spent almost two entire years without seeing Bucky anywhere.
“I did not agree with this, Mr. Jarvis.”
“That’s not news, I never sign the paperwork on time.” Tony complains, though he knows it’s not the best argument. “And I don’t spend all day with Steve and the others. But Avenging takes time, and that time has to be spent on… Avenging.”
It was… It was unsettling, in the most nerve-wrecking and volatile way possible, all madness and raging emotions and an explosive reaction he just couldn’t contain.
Her lips give only the smallest of twitches, but there’s so much emotion in the movement he can’t look away.
“Do you know what those mean?” Tony croaks weakly, looking over his shoulder to look at the looming presence with him on the ship.

His dreams had been big, and his heart had been empty. He needed something new to create, someone new to love.
. Tony has no idea. This entire thing is not making much sense to him right now. He needs a break, he needs to eat and sleep, and maybe tomorrow this whole thing will be a little less impossible, a little less outrageous than it is right now.
Sam makes a sound that seems like a low, exasperated whistle. “I’m glad you give speeches better than you lie.”
His eyes are bright, shiny. Wild.
“I’m picking you up— FRIDAY is picking you up, ok?” Tony unhelpfully explains. “She’ll be there in…”

They lay down and curl around each other, unable to stand to be apart when so much has already stood in their way for the previous days, and they both fall asleep almost instantly; To a fitful, distraught sleep, the first of many in nights to come.
Pepper lets out a sob, that drags and scratches her throat from the sound of it, the dry heaving and the shallow breath, and she covers her mouth with her hand and turns around to hide her face, but not fast enough that Tony can’t see the way her eyes well up with tears, not fast enough that he doesn’t see the pain he’s causing her, that it won’t haunt him until the day he dies.

“I thought you would say that.”
“The Soul Stone.” She says, and all eyes snap to her, like ravenous beasts at the sight of scraps, too eager to hear information about this Stone none of them have ever encountered – until the look in her face comes into focus, and they all sober up instantly, like a bucket of ice water has been doused on them. “Only my sister knew where it was. It had been hidden since the beginning of time. All I know is that Thanos forced her to tell him, and he took her with him to find the Stone. When he came back… She wasn’t with him.”
“The Raft.”
“Right away.” FRIDAY quickly assures, and she brings in yet another projection into the room, bright, colorful flashing images blinking one after another in quick speed as she reviews the footage as fast as she can right before their eyes, in a blur of jagged motions and distorted, fast-paced sound streaming in from the speakers, muted sensibly by her before Tony even needs to ask.

They sweat and shiver, a paradox of reaction between the flaming impulse of their predicament and the total and utter lack of preparation for the weather, the glacial bite of the lightless night catching them all off guard, their clothes all too summery and light for what Tony suspects is a below-40-degrees temperature outside.
“I’m sorry. It’s not – You’re right.” Barton heaves, surprising the hell out of Tony, whose eyebrows shoot up his forehead so quickly it’s almost like they have a life of their own. “I swear I don’t want to fight, I
“The world decided we don’t get one. Not before we fix what we’ve already broken.”
“Well, it’s for charity.” Natasha shrugs. “Just checking if Steve wouldn’t like to pitch in?”
He didn’t think he would get attached to anything in this new century because inside, he was still living in the old one. He always felt like an outsider, looking in on a world he couldn’t understand, that moved too fast – and for a man like him, moving too fast is like having his greatest nightmare coming to life.
Bucky stops in his tracks, looking up at him, his blue eyes wide and soft, just like he remembers from before. He smiles, slow and shy, with just a little hint of mischief, a smile that is so
“We found the problem with the ship!” Rocket says, but he doesn’t sound happy about it – he sounds annoyed. Tony thinks this might just be his default state, but still, he can’t help to interpret it as a bad sign. “Turns out wasn’t the engine – it was the moron inside the engine! And he says he knows you, iron guy!”
. It is nothing too serious, nothing involving blood or any kind of objects, but it does mention some unhealthy behaviour and unconscious self-harm in Steve's part, such as neglecting his basic needs and seeking risky and painful experiences, and it's always important to be careful with your mental health. So please, be safe.
Tony twitches at the chance to be unnecessarily nosy, fishing for a diversion so desperately is almost funny to watch him fumble. “You need more art supplies? I can get you more art supplies.”

Wong doesn’t look very pleased by the idea, but he nods, knowing he has no choice. “You have to be careful.” He warns, very serious, pointing to the books in Barton’s hands. “The warnings come after the spells.”
To be fair, Tony is too, most of the time. If it’s – it’s a bad idea, it’s a bad idea to stay here, and it’s obvious, and he should

Nice to know this isn’t a situation Natasha considers critical, but Tony would beg to differ.

God, I absolutely hate how the MCU just used the Accords as a way to propel a conflict with Bucky as a center piece, like he was nothing more than a mere object for which Steve and Tony are fighting over. I know the movie is entitled Captain America: Civil War, and not Avengers, but still. Bucky deserves much more development than that, let me tell you. The Accords, by themselves, bring to the table a discussion that's so damn important - and they just glossed over it for the sake of a brawl in a parking lot. Nice going, MCU, real classy.

"Then don't."
He needs to tell her.
“Not necessarily for the radiation.” Bruce suggests. “Maybe just the heat.”
Tony didn’t bring her here for this. She knows that, right? This, Dum-E and U, this is a coincidence. Tony’s not taking Nebula in like a stray kitten or anything like that, like he’s adopting her or something, because he knows Nebula would

past all the despair and the hurrying and the fretting, because Tony asks her “Where are you!? Are you okay!?” at the same time, they both equally terrified, and it is a long, panicked moment before either of them can stop to even think, let alone stop for long enough for the other to speak.
Fuck, isn’t that awful? Isn’t that proof enough of how fucked up they are?
“And we’ll just wait?” Tony asks, a little baffled.
It’s nonsensical of him to focus on such a thing.
“Definitely not.” Tony agrees.
“I don’t think we’ll have a choice.” Cap somberly admits. “But things are going to get ugly. There’s too many of them – we scare them off too suddenly, they’ll hurt each other when they escape, they’ll trample and swing all over the place, and we have no way of giving them medical aid without any access to rescue services.”

He’ll do it all. He’ll adapt to whatever Tony throws at him.

But it doesn’t work, does it.
Steve is a man who drives himself forward through sheer will and strength, by the raw, burning desire to right the wrongs and help those who have no one else. This kind of drive is not quiet, is not easy – it is hot and it is explosive, fueled by feelings that sometimes border too close on anger, by unconformity and insolence, the refusal to any sort of surrender in face of the enemy. How did they not see it? Did they not see it in the slouch in his posture, the weight on his shoulders, the weariness in his eyes? The beard on his face? Steve is using it to hide from the world as much as he is using it to hide from himself, because he looks at a mirror in the mornings and he feels

“Hey.” Barton says, like someone is pulling his teeth out with a damned plier.
Steve makes a wary pause. “So she didn’t tell you?”
Tony has imagined how this moment would go. Over and over and over again. He tried not to, but he did – and right now, despite how they made rounds incessantly inside his brain in those nights went the memories became just a little too much, when he looked over his shoulder expecting to see a person standing there and found only emptiness, every single one of those fantasies are scattered and scratchy, itching at the corners of his mind with uncomfortable static, a radio transmission too broken to rely any information across.

Better yet – he starts to leave, but then he stops, he turns, and unexpectedly, he kisses Tony.

But they are all getting him off guard. They are all fighting him. They are making him question himself, and he can’t stop hearing Tony’s voice in his head, always in his head, but never on the phone, the phone is always silent, and Steve doesn’t know what to do—!

So she panics. She does, indeed, when one day, out of nowhere, Tony’s screen goes entirely black mid-conversation and it won’t turn back on.
(Shit!)
“But will you stay?” T’Challa asks finally.
“He would have to lose.” Nebula growls. “Or come so close to losing that he would rather destroy them than to let his enemy win.”

He took me apart, piece by piece, and left me there, pulling at the parts like I was nothing but a circuit he could destroy. I… I didn’t tell him anything. He wanted to find Gamora, and I didn’t tell him how. But he found her anyway. Probably in Knowhere. He must have captured her after he got the Reality Stone.”

He turns to them like a prisoner awaiting sentence, expecting judgment, and sorrowfully, he says, “Loki took it, when we escaped – and Thanos took it from him, when he attacked our ship, and… And killed him. Killed my people.”

someone that Steve might have liked to have beside him in battle, and he felt like he would regret forever for not having the chance to tell Tony that.
Tony is not sure how exactly those words sound when they leave his mouth, but from the look on Rogers’ face, it probably doesn’t sound like he thinks they did. Rogers’ neck goes back a little, his eyes going hard and his mouth twisting in what looks like a very painful grind of his teeth, so quick that Tony can’t even feel his defensive instincts kick in before Rogers’ expression goes a little slack again, covered in a muted sadness that Tony can see from the crease of his eyebrows, before he says:
Rogers says nothing. He doesn’t even open his mouth.
“What?” He babbles, hoarse and breathless, the word barely a whisper.
“Captain Rogers asked me why you weren’t listed as an official Avenger.” Nick says, with all the casualness only a person as smug as him can have.

“I mean, if I read them and I think they’re bullshit, I just won’t sign and… And I’ll give up the suit, I guess.” Scott says and Steve can almost hear it as he shrugs. “Not my favorite idea, but I’ve had worse. Honestly, at this point… I’d give up anything if it meant I can go home and see my daughter on her birthday.”
He hadn't imagined Tony Stark would be like this.
But that voice, Tony would recognize anywhere. “Rhodey?”

“What’s that got to do with a Tree of Life?” Barton asks, expression twisted into wary disbelief.
He wants to be here forever. He wants the world to disappear, just for a while, just so he can lay here next to her and let her take whatever comfort she can take from him, from having a warm, solid body laying next to her own, to have her hand held, to have someone else in the room to remind herself that she is not alone. Sometimes that helps. Tony can count in one hand the number of times he has ever seen her this vulnerable, to melt in his arms not out of affection but of fear, and he hates that he has one more to add to the list. And now, they no longer have the luxury of a pause to breathe or the soothing voice of a therapist to help her unravel the irrational things her brain might be telling her after experiencing a traumatic event, which Tone knew she’d done, despite the fact he never did.
“In theory, yes.” Wong concedes, after a thoughtful pause. “But not without a price.”
She’s right. But because Steve is not one known for pulling punches, nor for being very sensible when he’s so high strung as he is right now – as he’s been the last few… years, really -, he blurts his next comment the same way he would blurt an insult, or an order, or both; accusing and unflinching, eyes sharp on every detail, every tell, an even though he merely speaks, the silence makes it seem like a shout:
“Ross is not the Accords’ executioner, Steve.” Natasha growls, but she doesn’t correct him. “Out of all of us, Bruce was the one who felt the weight of every casualty the most. He would have seen the necessity for the Accords, even if he didn’t sign them. And if Ross was the one to present them to him, he would have refused and

“It’s worse than you can imagine.”
He has imagined it soft and kind. He has imagined it hard and angry and bitter. He has imagined it mute, and he has imagined it loud and roaring, and relieved, and resentful, and grateful and tired and desperate – and all possibilities in between, and none of them had ever felt right. He’s not sure what he had wanted to feel. He had wanted to feel different things at different times. Or maybe… Maybe, a small part of him, had wanted it to never happen at all.
A new message pops up:

Steve doesn’t reply, but his jaw is locked tight, and Tony fears he’ll shatter his teeth.
Steve makes a pause to consider the offer, and the oh so heavy weight it carries.
“Not sure if the same person, but the same forge.” Thor clarifies. “Nidavellir is the mightiest forge in the universe. The Dwarves were experts in both metalwork and spells – their knowledge, combined with the power of the star that fuels the forge, creates the strongest weapons ever known.”
On top of the center table, there is a broken broom, a white, dusty cloud of old foam, and a fire extinguisher.

since they last been together.
Tony doesn’t know why.
Tony does acknowledge how dangerous it is, to pretend the ashes aren’t a huge concern, but he has to make a call. Deep inside him, he knows he’ll never be able to halt the intrinsic, almost visceral instinct to protect people, to throw all other priorities away in favor of making sure the civilians are alright – and he’s going to try that first, always, because that will always be the thought at the forefront of his mind at all times.

Steve pauses, and he looks at Tony with such an intense gaze Tony can’t look away. “And she misses you. We still talk about you sometimes.”
But he didn’t want to take the chance and hurt him.

Bruce’s eyes widen a bit, like he’s

When they first met, long before Steve was even out of the ice, the Winter Soldier shot Nat right through the belly. He was the protagonist of Natasha’s bedtime stories as a captive under the KGB, stories that were not about monsters in closets or under the bed – but monsters armed with guns and knives, that are stronger than her, more skillful than her, and to stand in their way would mean death. Steve remembers the first time she told him about the Winter Soldier, and he can remember how
“Wait,
“And did you call?”
He had never wanted to see her shoulders slump as they walk towards the bedroom, to watch her shuffle by the bed awkwardly, as if the nervous energy inside her won’t let her sit still, despite how tired she obviously is, and to see her hesitate to sleep, like he once did, like he knows, so deeply, how it feels.
Ultron says, and with the sound of a distant explosion, the audio suddenly cuts off, and the workshop is drowned in tense silence.
“Comms.” Tony immediately replies. “We need to bring power back to the city. We need it for heaters, for water distribution, for everything. Filters, too!”
They are not good at this, at opening up. They have been taught how to fight back – never how to surrender.
Steve is not sure how to answer that, honestly.
“No.” Nebula admits, in a pained voice, and it

didn’t, but I also know you wouldn’t have minded.”
She knows it too. Natasha seems to know him far better than he knows himself these days, and he wonders what else can she see about him that he still cannot. Steve almost wants to ask, but he’s not sure if he’d like to hear whatever she would have to say. He doesn’t want to put her in that position.
“Sanskrit.” Bruce says, quickly. “I can’t read it, it’s a dead language, but they still use it in some parts of India, for religious texts.”
Tony gets up slowly, distantly realizing his wound now feels pleasantly numb, no longer stinging or pulling sharply at the edges, but he barely looks down at it as he asks, his eyes still locked on Bruce, “How bad?”
Because just like he can remember Natasha’s resentful stare and her harsh, accusatory voice, he can also remember her

Nebula looks at the rubble behind them for a moment, thoughtful and nostalgic, and then whispers, “Gamora’s sister.”
Tony is barely able to stand in his own feet. He wants to be angry about his own lazy disposition, about how tired his muscles feel or how his bones don’t seem to be strong enough to hold him up, too weak for even this simple task, but Tony knows, at least at the back of his head, that he isn’t twenty anymore; And he is without food, much water or proper sleep for over three days, and he has fought the universe’s biggest asshole during that same time period.
She doesn’t know.

“They are inside.” Jarvis exhales, almost whispering, feeling breathless and lightheaded. “Inside SHIELD.”

“What the hell do you mean?” Natasha asks, just a little too harshly.
“And how far did you think it would get?”
“I’m trying to! It’s no use if Tony won’t call! If he can’t reach out, it’s not my fault!”
“Not everything has to be something he must learn about. Videos are nice. He could have some fun once in a while.”
?” Tony asks Nebula, who nods curtly.
Thankfully, Thor breathes in deep and seems to back away a little, retreating into a less intimidating posture. “Not that I know of. But I haven’t heard from Valkyrie since their escape, so I don’t know.”
Tony throws one last look at Rogers, feeling on edge that Rogers just stares back, like he’s trying to make Tony understand something that Tony just can’t read, because he can’t read Rogers’ fucking mind and he has no idea what kind of game he’s trying to play here.
Whether you like Pepper or not, you have to admit that her relationship with Tony is definitely important to his character, and she is, effectively, one of the pillars of his story. I think killing her off with the snap or pretending she was never a romantic partner to Tony is, although effective, a dangerous play because it erases some subtleties that can only be observed if Pepper is present. So actually, what I have to do is not to eliminate Pepper from the equation, but to push her into a position that forces her to voice her opinions and position in a way that not even Tony's personal view or feelings are able to distort their meaning, for better or for worse.

Eventually, the chemicals and particles will rise to the atmosphere and they will block sunlight, which will kill the rest of the plants that are left, and it’ll slowly take down the entire food chain with it.

Does it soothe my heart completely, after what Civil War has done to us? No, it doesn't. And I suspect it doesn't for you, either. You might have gotten all the way down here with maybe some small amount of relief that Steve is finally more aware of the consequences of his actions and his guilt - but there is still a little bitterness at the back of your tongue, isn't there? Because at the end of the day, Steve learns but doesn't give in. He changes, but we ache to see him act on that change. It's better, but it's not enough.
Many things are Steve’s fault.
He speaks of the men, at first. The army. Safe territory, ground they had already lightly trodden – a safe bet, but one Tony’s far too eager to accept. Maybe he’s also the stupid one here. But he would never deny Steve a willing ear, or a hug, or a kiss, not when Steve asks, not when Steve offers.

Tony gives him a cautious look. “I didn’t say it was a bad date.”

When Tony is standing there, in the middle of this charred scraps, black dust beneath his boots and the smell of burnt metal on his nose, with his helmet pulled back so he can feel the nearly unbearable heat of the cabin, a sharp contrast to the biting cold of the world outside this explosion site, so he feels the dirt sticking to his face, the disgusting feeling of his hands sweating cold beneath his gauntlets – he looks at the floor of the plane, to the burnt bodies of those who didn’t manage to get out on time, Tony remembers why.

We're gonna start with Thor. Consider this a part I. With a sprinkle of plot, and lots of introspection, let's gently pry open a discussion that, at first, might look like it begins and ends here - but believe me when I say it doesn't. Thor is much more intelligent that most people would give him credit for, and canon has made him a mess of a character, different portrayals as movies went by making his character a very layered, very interesting puzzle to unravel; so it's gonna take some time, but without a doubt, it will be worth it.

Thanos. He was the one who sent Loki.
He doesn’t know much about Lang, he’ll admit, besides their brief interactions in Leipzig and inside the Raft – which is… troublesome –, and the repo the general news reports from Lang’s appeal trial. Reports only of course, because even though the Stark Industries Legal team backed up both Lang’s and Barton’s trials from the sidelines, Tony never actually went down there and met them during their standings. What good would it do? Even if Tony knows Lang would have definitely reacted better than Barton – or less aggressively, truthfully speaking –, Tony kept his distance, just in case. So they never interacted much. He doubted his presence would’ve been appreciated anyway; The legal team had done what it needed to do, and Lang had gotten his reduction of sentence, placed in house arrest, and everything had been fine.
Perhaps he should feel slighted. At first, he did.
Tony has seen chaos, the kind of chaos that happened when a frightened city runs in despair as alien attackers fall from the sky, but that’s – this is not the same. These people – they are beyond any semblance of rationality or solidarity, not caring about what happens to the others so long as they get out of the way; It…

“C’mon.” Steve calls her, after they’ve watched the jet leave discreetly, barely making any sound at all as it took off. It flew beautifully, as all Wakandan jets do, and they all kept staring at the sky where it had disappeared into for far too long.
It’s a fair assumption, too. Tony doubts anyone would have come down without being prompted – no one ever did, before. It was an unspoken arrangement between him and the team, sort of. Never really discussed, but it was just how things had developed – the workshop had remained Tony’s sanctuary, neutral-ish ground between his SI business and his Avenger life, and whatever interaction had happened between Tony and the team, it mostly had occurred in the upper floors, never down here; with, of course, the exception of Bruce.

So whatever it was made of, the Kree probably have more!”
Steve is in the workshop and Tony is incredibly sleep-deprived.
“Go hit your own robot!” Steve complains, but at the same time, he throws his shield again, and not only it hits Tony’s target, but also the poor, innocent robot to his right, in the other free lane.

are on the other side, with tight expressions and stiff stances.
“Relax, I’m just pulling your leg.” Tony backs down, trying to sound playful. “I know I’m not the easiest person to deal with. And I talk a lot. Sometimes, when I shouldn’t. But that’s okay! I got it out my chest and you took a nap, all in a good day of work. Doesn’t actually matter if you weren’t listening.”
he sounds, scratchy and dry, like he just swallowed sandpaper. “Where are we?”
The blue being shifts and grunts, as if they’re getting up from a sitting position, after God knows how long since they both fell to the ground and just stayed there. Tony wonders, distantly, if they can cry. If they heard him, as he did. Even if it’s stupid, even if it’s of no consequence now, Tony feels his neck burn with embarrassment, with the old, familiar shame of being caught vulnerable, especially by a complete stranger as this Guardian.

Steve raises his eyes and locks his gaze with Sam’s, like he does when he feels too small.
“I am quite certain there’s only one person in the world who knows what to do with this. You, Ms. Carter.” Mr. Jarvis says, quiet, and Peggy can only give him a saddened smile, a pleased yet sorrowful thing, that makes her chest a bit tight with gratitude.

, Bruce called him, says.
“I need to go out there to know for sure.” Tony explains himself to him, hoping that’ll give him a little comfort, a little assurance that Tony isn’t ignoring this, he’s just delaying it a little to gather more information on it, so they’ll know what to do. Because that’s all this is. Tony has been outside for no more than an hour, at most, and despite the hellish scenery he saw when they escaped the hospital he was being treated in, he hasn’t even starched the surface of how vast the destruction of Thanos’ attack had been. He saw the fire, he saw the body—
“Down the hangar.” Rogers offers, with military efficiency, and for all it’s worth, Tony is unbearably thankful by how easy it is for him to fall back into the priorities, at least this once. “Cameron Klein hasn’t reported anything new on DC. The crowd seems to be gone, but it’s been raining since we left. He says it shows no sign of stopping.”
“It’s their instinctual response. They won’t politely ask what you’re doing there, if you just barge in with a gun, when they’re not expecting. If they don’t want you there. They just shoot back. Because they can’t take the chance you won’t shoot first. More so when you’re military.” He takes in a wet, choked breath. “I couldn’t go back to make sure the people who helped me were okay. There was this girl, Martina – If they suspected she helped me, and if they thought I had something to do with the unit that invaded the slum, they could have taken her, to try and make her talk. She could have been hurt, and it would’ve been my fault.”
Pepper stays silent for a long minute, until she says, in a rush of breath of her own:

He still remembers. He’d been sitting in the dark in his living room at the Tower, nursing a half-empty glass of whisky while she’d been away in Dublin for a week-long discussion with some investors. The common floor was still full of glass and broken furniture, from when Ultron’s first attempt of an attack at them had trashed their after-party glow and disrupted the only relief Tony had in her absence. There was no JARVIS to fill the silence anymore. FRIDAY wasn’t the same. So he sat there and drank, alone, when the news came in, and in the middle of a report of what had just transpired in Sokovia mere days before, one of the commenters, with an incredibly sharp sense, had mentioned that
Now that the floodgates are open, let's hit Steve right where it hurts; and let's see what exactly does it take to turn this man from the person he was when he left that bunker, to the person he became when the war came around, once again knocking at his door, demanding to be let through.

Steve huffs out the shortest of laughs, weirdly smug.
Everything that he pulls in – it just dissolves. Leaves him bare.
Thor has nothing to do with this. Thor hasn’t done anything wrong to Tony, ever, and he doesn’t deserve Tony’s bitterness, just like Bruce hadn’t. Tony is just… taking it out on the people who have never done him harm, and he needs to

“And if he does,” Tony proceeds. “We might be even a step closer to solving this. But for now, while he’s gone, we do what we can on our side.”
And Steve knows he and the younger Bucky share a… very specific view on how to deal with their problems. Which means: suck it up, and do it. Maybe in a less aggressive and more motivational way, but that’s the gist of it. And Steve knows. Despite what Tony thinks, he’s not

But if Rogers says
She is not asking his permission. She is not even asking his opinion. What she is asking for is his support, but Steve suspects she’ll go through with it even if she doesn’t have it, because this is the choice she has made. Whether or not she realizes how deep her feelings for Vision run, she has decided to act on them, and she is telling Steve this not as his subordinate, only as his
“Neither did I.” Thor admits, and his voice is so sincere it doesn’t even occur to Tony to think he might be lying. “My father kept many secrets. The existence of my sister and her location was one of those secrets. When they were revealed, the destruction caused by them cost me greatly – far more than my hammer.”
Maybe he is afraid. Maybe. Desperate for touch, for anything but violence, but unable to stomach a compromise – so he chooses Tony.

Peter deserves better than this.
“Still not seeing a point here.” Tony says, petulant.
But this, Tony will admit, is kind of his fault.
And it doesn’t get easier to hear it from someone else’s mouth other than his own thoughts. Good to know.
(She lied!)
It doesn’t bother him. Not because it was something carved into him when he finally joined the army, because it really wasn’t – he was always like this. Focused, driven, to the point of being stubborn to a fault; making himself tall in all the ways his body wouldn’t allow him, refusing to be shoved over and ridiculed by something so fickle as appearance when his heart had so much more to offer.

These two don’t know how to do that, so maybe Tony can help them. Maybe they can all help each other.

Tony knows better than to believe Pepper is breakable, but he also knows better than to believe she is invulnerable. Tony knows her far too well. Tony knows what she’d probably done in these past two days – he can see it in his mind’s eye; Pepper, panicking under a calm expression and reigning in her own anguish so well that her hands wouldn’t even tremble. Tony heard it in her voice over the call, the strength and leadership that never truly stops lacing her tone because it’s such a big part of her, the instinct of being a protector too great to be suffocated, even by her fear.
“SHIELD records state Dr. Zola died in 1972.” FRIDAY swiftly informs, precise and direct, enlarging the picture of the scientist to draw attention to it, and she brings up a cutout from what looks like the scan of a medical report, stating Zola died in November of 1972, of lung cancer.
“We have some news.” He blurts out, sounding only a little desperate, which is good, because it almost hides the absolute thunderstorm that rages inside him at the very same moment. Almost. But Steve is sure Natasha can see it in his eyes, the agonized relief, the shameful reprieve, “About the new Reactor.”

“Possibly.” Thor says, after a long moment of hesitation. “Yes. But not enough for a second snap of fingers.”
Tony has never wanted him to just disappear or be gone from existence. He’d wanted many things, but never that. So yeah, he’ll give, he’s kind of glad Rogers is still alive, because Tony really doesn’t want this all to go down to one more regret he’ll add to his never-ending list, one more thing he’ll have to shove down and pretend it doesn’t hurt for the rest of his days, especially now that he can’t even count with the help of bitter alcohol to wash off the taste from his tongue.
Tony can hear his blood roaring in his ears, loud and chaotic, deafening, and past it all he exhales shakily, nearly a sob, and answers her back.
“No.” Tony laughs. “We’re friends, Pep. Just friends.”

Tony’s eyes go wide, and he exhales harshly in a shudder, and startles a bit when Pepper suddenly moves on the other side, her faceplate sliding up again, to show her mildly surprised face inside. “So?” she says, pretending this isn’t just as overwhelming to her as it is to everyone else. “Any more complaints?”

But when Tony didn’t come back, and Happy was gone, and the world held still and stopped breathing, terrified and hopeless — That’s always the moment when Pepper raises her chin up high and squares her shoulders and takes hell by its reigns and beats it into order. It’s what she does. Pepper is the neat, strong hand that guides people to the quickest way to safety, because her mind has the sharpness for business but her heart has the compassion many in her position lack, and it shows, because if the world is tilting out of its axis, Pepper is never afraid to be the one to step closer and hold it together for as long as she can.

Truth is, there’s a big part of their lives that just doesn’t overlap no matter how hard they try. A Venn Diagram, that grows larger and larger as they fill their lives with things as the years go by, but so very little of it actually meets the contact point between their individual circles. Tony’s half is filled with Avengers business and upgrades to the suit and meetings with Ross and remodeling the Compound and… Peter. A chest that Tony kept filling and filling with items collected from a world he promised he would step out of when given the chance because it would make her happy. And her part too, it grew beyond places Tony could reach. She kickstarted the September Foundation and the entire new segment of medical aid and prosthesis through SI after Extremis, and her projects became grander and grander until Tony’s participation in them started to diminish because of time management, and the gap just… grew. It was small, but it grew. And it kept growing.

He can see the whole extent of the wing, jutting out from the body, where the white paint creates a sharp, terrible contrast to the black soot that covers the cabin.

“We were so lucky to act freely for as long as we did.

For anyone who might be freaking out about my posting schedule as we're getting closer to Endgame - I hope to bring at least another chapter before the movie launches, which I'll be seeing in the release date in my country, April 25. The next chapter is already in the works, with a big section already written, so it should come considerably faster than the previous ones. We'll continue to talk about Pepper and her influence in Tony's life and decisions, and her own development and story arc, now that she is, inescapably, part of the consequences of Tony's superhero side of life.
As always, please stay safe, I hope you are all well, and I will see you all in the next one <3

“You jumped inside a spaceship,” Rhodey says after they’ve finally stepped back inside the Compound, and it’s a recapitulation as much as it is a reprimand, and his crossed arms and worried brows tell Tony he’s not escaping this without a proper explanation, maybe not even then. “With no backup, no plan, and no way of communicating.”

“What we did to Vision was to fix the connections that were broken or were never attached in him, because Ultron never got the chance to do it.

Vision seems concerned with Steve’s silence, and he makes a motion like he’s going to lay his hand in Steve’s shoulder to console him, but the movement is halted before its even halfway through. Then, he says, his voice as gentle as it was when he whispered to Wanda when they left the apartment room together. “Don’t take this as a sign of indifference, Captain. Mr. Stark is only trying to assure that our meetings occur in the safest way possible. It is by no means a rejection.”
He could never forget what Tony looked like, but in this moment, Steve feels like he’s seeing him for the first time in his life. This is what it feels like – to come
"Stark." He says, and his voice has no emotion to it. No anger, no warmth, no nothing. If not for the use of his name, Tony would almost think Barton doesn’t recognize him.

Tony doesn’t know how to deal with that. He needs time,
He knows it well, intimately, as one would know a lover or a friend; and he knows better than to underestimate it or believe too much in it. Even when you win, every casualty feels like a loss.

Winning or losing seems very different, but in many ways it’s not, and he thought he knew that. He thought he knew war was useless.
Tony had missed him during the mess with the Accords. Just like he had missed Bruce. Tony had missed them both, for so many reasons, but now, mostly because he had believed that of all of them, as a

The reason why is far too complicated to explain. And he

but… It’s… something. It’s something, and Tony can’t grasp it, not fast enough, and it all gets drowned in the determination of favorable results of calculations, in the pressing ticking of the clock as the crowd screams and bellows, shaking the bars, and Tony makes a split-second decision before anything worse can happen, and nods sharply.
Despite his enhanced hearing, Steve doesn’t actually hear a word they are saying to Tony, the blood rushing inside his temples so loud it reminds him of the train in Italy, when Bucky fell, the echo of imminent danger and hurt he can’t identify when he’s deep into his nightmares, just a trigger to a physical reaction that has become harder and harder to justify over the years. He hears the vague tones of a voice he hasn’t heard in years, and that alone is enough to trigger a reaction so strong that makes him break into a cold sweat, the uncertainty of what lies beyond the false safety of the jet’s walls too overwhelming for him to reign his irrational response in.
Small enough to fit inside his chest. In his heart.

It’s exactly what Tony had imagined he would be like, to be honest.

They’re not even Nazis, they’re just common people, and even the slightest moment of distraction means civilian casualties, and that’s everything Tony has been fighting against for literal years. It’s what they destroyed their team over. They have weapons but they can’t
