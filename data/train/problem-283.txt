“It makes no sense.” The detective mumbles to himself. John keeps quiet because he’s good at it. Sherlock frowns at the ropey thing again then twirls about, “John.”
John looks around in mild confusion. “Okay, Sherlock is in there,” he points at the hangar, “Then where is Martin? He was just beside me.”
Sherlock thaws, spins on the spot and narrows his eyes at her, everything about his expression saying
Thomas has been coming here to this room every so many days, at least I think they are days, but I don’t know. Every time he does the same thing, never touching me any other way. It is the only time there is no pain, no hunger, no angry-sounding words. Just…whatever it is. Sometimes it makes me remember Momma, but mostly she is nothing more than a dream I can no longer see. When I do sleep, there’s nothing but darkness.
Martin is getting fed up with closing his eyes in one place and waking up in an entirely new one. He’s done this more times in the past week than he’s ever done in his life and it is beginning to tip-toe the line between ridiculous and redundant. This time, at least, the silently staring specter of Sherlock doesn’t scare the shite out of him.
From where he stands opposite his partner, Sherlock nods his agreement as he reaches out to run his hand down the center of the now split in half bench seat. All three pieces of wood are cracked down the center, the lumber splintered into thousands of bits. As always, though, John can see clearly that Sherlock’s onto some detail about it that makes it more than it seems.
we saw some helicopters and oh, did you see the people in the
Sherlock nods. “Apparently in some circles, Weres are considered unfortunate, with their absolute need to shift. Shifters are like the crème de la crème.”
Part of Sherlock wants to tell John
Pulling his attention back to the task at hand, Sherlock quickly scans the area, ascertaining that he is correct in thinking that Martin’s kidnappers are being kept busy by John. Cautiously, he makes his way to the airplane parked in the center of the hangar whilst Sherrinford is walking the perimeter of the room, double checking that Sherlock’s theories about
Sherlock waves a hand in the air between them. “You were not scheduled tonight.”
“Do you think you’ll be able to get home if I convince Hercules it’s time to get out of here?” She snaps open the big pocketbook in her lap and hands him an airline ticket. “I know you can’t leave yet, there’s no date on this one. I’m not thrilled about leaving you, but I don’t know what else to do.”
“Lestrade!” calls the dulcet tones of one Sally Donovan from the opposite end of the never-ending corridor.
John can hear the pieces of the puzzle shifting into place in Sherlock’s mind. Inside his own the sound is one he’s sure the tectonic plates make as they shift over the planet, if it were audible to human ears: a smooth grating as the plates ease up against one another and finally rest, never realizing the great marvels they’ve carved out in their wanderings, such as deep lakes and mountain ranges. John waits until Sherlock’s inner whirling dervish slows, yet the singing vibrations left over buzz down their Link and John feels the adrenaline rush all the same—but it’s different now, too, as if they are sharing both the high of the puzzle and the steady drumbeat of the march that is a call to
Finally turning to face his brother, Sherlock narrows his eyes and watches Mycroft warily as he strides to the door, looking ridiculously put together for this time of night. There’s no possible way that Mycroft has any inkling what Sherlock had planned for later, because he didn’t even know it himself until just now. He frowns, going over that absurd little speech in his head. He wants to argue that he’s not a real cat in the first place, only a human with the ability to assume the feline form and personality…until he realizes that the argument is utterly futile.
“Yeah, well, you look pretty normal and you did say you were a doctor, after all…” The paramedic crosses his arms over his chest, unprofessionally forgetting his duty to the men in the plane.
“Just a case. George told me that Richard is a top-billed drag queen at one of the city clubs. George thought he’d try it out, but Richard thought he was being upstaged and now Lestrade has a murder on his hands.”
Higgins and the man is like, oh, I don’t know, ninety-three years old? He’s only owner of the airport in name, not day-to-day stuff.”
“It’s like riding Pascale, Papa!” she shouts at Sherlock.
John pats Sherlock’s side, a simple request that he turn over; he strokes Sherlock’s chest and runs questing fingers down the sparse happy trail before answering, thoroughly enjoying every single quiet groan and intake of breath he coaxes from the detective.
“He doesn’t know you.”
(They all look ridiculous.)
for auld lang syne.
John shrugs inwardly as Sherlock strides evenly into the sitting room from the loo. He reaches down and gently rolls Sophie into his arms. The little girl sighs and scrunches up her face but does not wake fully. John thinks she’s absolutely beautiful and whispers as much to her as he brushes a soft kiss on her forehead. As he adjusts her in his arms, Sherlock’s expression is calm, open and John can’t help but smile.
In his whole thirty-three years of life, Martin has not spent much time with children. One glance at those huge green eyes gazing intently at him from beneath silky curls and he has to admit that he’s completely smitten. Sophie captures his attention so completely that he didn’t even realize John was taking pictures last night until after the third one.
Mycroft drops a kiss to their mother’s head. She puts her arm around his waist and brings him close to her, still holding Sherlock’s hand in the other.
“I think you’ll be alright, it’s too late to try and do much more than clean it, which I’ll do as soon as we get back to the…”
“What the hell?” Mr. Thompson asks from the bed. He’s thinking that the next time he breaks a toe, he’s going to splint the damned thing himself and be done with it. Weird enough that one doctor is looking at him like he’s a bug under glass, but to have this tall, skinny man with the crazy hair doing it, too?
in Sherlock's direction.
Douglas feels the heat creep up his neck and over his face. Really, what can he say to that? “I admit that I find Martin attractive. However, he has talent. Trust me. When all this is over and we can go home—did I even mention that he’s from Fitton, for God’s sake?—just give him a chance. Will you do that for me?”
It doesn’t take him long to make the mental leap.
Martin is enthralled. He walks up to the craft, touching the metal with his fingertips as if he’s afraid it will break; he traces the Holmes Manufacturing logo, then reaches up and pats her bow-shaped nose as he passes. He whistles.
Once again, John is struck by the idea that neither Mycroft nor Sherlock have mentioned their eldest brother to the youngest one. Surely Greg knows about him by now.
“They’d been haunting our house since my first case two years previous. I made the mistake of calling in an exorcist, who only made everything worse. Granted, he managed to force out the twisted spirits of two children responsible for their parents’ and their own deaths, but in doing so he also gave them free will.” Sherlock finally stops speaking and drops his hands to his sides. His expression is one of a man who has just been gutted with a butter knife when he turns to face John fully.
Mrs. Hudson shushes me a bit, but I shake my head. This is tough, but not the worst thing. “Bryan’s back was bowed where he’d curled up around her all night. It just…it wasn’t enough.”
John actually smiles. “Well, then, I guess that makes two of us then.”
(Right. If that made no sense, just pretend Sherlock is mind-palacing.)
“Besides, I hear our baby-baby brother is in town, too. You could have at least invited me to the family reunion.”
“Good morning, Uncle Martin,” the little girl says cheerily, enunciating each word properly.
Oops, John thinks, that one got away from me. Sherlock is now peeking at him from beneath the noted curl, his eyes glimmering mischievously in the mixed light of the lamps. John is frozen on the spot, caught out, his channels wide open and obviously broadcasting
Martin nods, glad his brothers have ignored that statement for the time being. Douglas gives him a soft kiss and Martin turns to follow the others, blushing madly.
Sherlock nods. “Agreed. Your wife was in contact with some unsavory types, then?”
She leaves and does not return, instead taking solace in the bottom of a bottle for being the last surviving member of her family; silently forgetting that her brother is by no means no longer among the living.
Next to Douglas is Sherrinford’s wife, Atlantea. John thinks that if one of the Veelas from Harry Potter were to ever come to life, she’s one of them. A cascade of white-blonde hair falls down her back past her waistline; she is easily as tall as Sherlock, her eyes are icy blue and her expression one of quiet joy as she studies her husband where he stands on the opposite side of the mantel to Mycroft.
“Douglas?” Martin queries, turning in his chair. He gulps, “Guess you heard that then, huh?”
Sherlock sighs wearily and when he speaks, his voice echoes in the garage-like room. “I think that would be unwise,” he says to the stranger, then turns his back on the man and addresses John.
There’s no answer but he can soon see why that would be. All of Sherlock’s considerable feline prowess is being used to hold his body aloft in an oak tree that was probably already ancient when the Knights of the Round Table were first organized. The Cat is far up in the high branches, hissing and spitting and doing his level best to claw at the Osprey who seems hellbent on knocking him from his precarious perch.
Martin is stretched out on the floor in front of the sofa where Douglas sits, his hands resting on the top of Douglas’ socked feet. He’s no longer wearing the plaster cast on his leg, but a lighter walking cast, and he has to keep his foot propped up as much as possible, even this far past the injury. Mycroft had offered a couple of small pillows for the task and Martin accepted them graciously, glad to get off it for a while.
Sherlock answers him by pushing himself off the bed with his hands and tilting his head in order to cover John’s lips with his own.
“Ouch!” Martin exclaims and Sherlock grits his teeth.
“Shut up, House.” Wilson steps closer to the door, completely ignoring the older man sticking his tongue out at his back. He holds out a hand in the direction of both gentlemen. The shorter of the two takes it and gives it a firm, sturdy shake.
Soon they are in a morgue across town from the airfield, staring down at an otherwise unnamed healthy petite brunette female. Outwardly, her body is virtually unscathed, her manicure intact, face unblemished. John notices no contusions on her; she’s even without the light bruising like the ones Martin suffered yesterday. That is to be expected though: corpses don’t bruise. However, one fact they didn’t have yesterday has now been made perfectly clear:
John is in his chair with his feet propped up on the coffee table, made possible by the fact that he’s pulled around to face the sofa, a thick old book on his lap. After two hours of flipping through the yellowed pages and scrutinizing the curly handwriting inked in green there, he’s beginning to get a headache. He stretches his arms until his shoulder pops loudly, causing Sherlock to open one eye and regard him as if he cannot believe that John’s body would dare interrupt the important tangent he was about to jump on.
Sherrinford shrugs and puts his helmet back on. He makes to pull down the face plate then seems to have second thoughts about it. “We’ll do lunch tomorrow. I’m not due out of here for the next forty-eight or so.”
“So, then, Doctor Stamford, I’ve got to ask, what does all of this research mean in terms of modern-day religion?”
John leans rests the back of his head on his chair, his arms relaxed on the arms, then closes his eyes and thinks about the past weeks. It’s an effort to remember as much detail as he can for the blog, as well as an exercise in organizing his own thoughts. It’s no mind palace, of course, but he’s learned that the practice is worth the effort, especially during those times when Sherlock begins a conversation right smack in the middle.
“It’s probably not the most comfortable, but it’s the best we can do at the moment. Somebody go get us a stretcher.” John leans over the table, checking Ambrose’s pupils while House actually acts like a doctor and takes the unconscious man’s pulse.
“Yes.”
in it. She hands them out and nods her head in Sherlock’s direction.
Sherlock frowns, still only looking at John.
Sally shrugs. “He seemed like he needed it.”
“Mycroft, it is
,” Sherrinford huffs in irritation, “I keep telling you, it isn’t possible. T. Higgins is
, she thinks immediately upon spying the two men in the room.
After a stretch of terse silence, John dares take a peek: Sherlock’s messy curls are the only part of his head sticking out overtop his knees.
“Thank you,” she says.
“Right,” Captain answers, one leg swinging off the edge of the table he’s perched on.
Mycroft nods, “Not at all Doctor Watson, take the time you need.”
Dammit. They really need to discuss this, but…
“Alright then, Grant, so far you’ve told us that your husband withdrew quite a bit of cash,” here John fails to suppress a shudder at the amount that Grant’s been so casually talking about, “from your joint account. Apparently some of that money is his?”
Before he can turn over that particularly vexing question, Sherlock’s mobile vibrates on the kitchen table. He fetches it to find two text messages, one from Mycroft with Mrs. Hudson’s information and the other from John Watson.
, because you know, you all fucking rock! Around my house, no one ever gets my jokes! I’m surrounded by (wait for it, it’s a doozy)…
“Young lady, I’ve no idea what you are thinking, forgetting to put your feet up! I’m sure John has told you a dozen times if not more that you’ve got to keep the circulation in your legs and it will keep your ankles from swelling.” She tries hard to sound so stern, but honestly, it doesn’t work at all.
Martin stifles a loud laugh that threatens to spill from his lips. “In some ways it’s a godsend, because once Mycroft decides you are under his wing, he sometimes can be sort of stalkerish…but in a good way.” He flaps a hand in the air dismissively and laughs at the absurdity of it. Douglas laughs with him. “I guess we are the quintessential British men, though, John had to remind Sherlock to hug me.”
“No, Sherlock. I know it doesn’t matter to you because you have oh so many people to talk to all the time, but you…you’re all I have! How can you just go off and leave me like that? With nothing but your body lying here and I don’t know if you’re alive or dead!”
and it was all…too much. The second sting of misery as he fought to close his Shield down as tightly as possible; the desire to
Of course, there’s not much else they can do from here, since both of their mobiles have been confiscated, though apparently not Sherlock’s lock-picking set because the brilliant idiot is now using them to pick at his fingernails.
John frowns up at him.
The quiet affection plus the warm brew in his hand is doing wonders in calming John’s mind. “Think he can do it?”
Douglas chuckles into his hands, thinking for sure he sounds like some sort of nutter.
“Aunt Mable still looking for me?” The Were asks in a voice like candied velvet. The familiar tone catches John off guard; a deeply seated darker emotion begins to stir in the back of his mind.
“Could you give me a minute?” John asks Barkley. The other man nods and licks orange powder off his fingertips.
“Starving,” John quips.
It seems to do the trick because Sherlock steps back and Ambrose looks up enough so that Sherlock can fully see his face, though he remains twisted as if to ward off blows.
John comes so close to dropping the boiling hot tea kettle on his own foot that he doesn’t see Sherlock move until the taller man has one hand splayed out on his chest and the other wrapped around the handle of the kettle. John tries to pass the incident off with a shiver and a jaw-cracking yawn even as he leans into the heat of that broad palm on his chest.
“Oh, John! It is so good to hear from you, I was so concerned when you…” it is not polite to say
“No, but I’d like to get to know the live one a little better.” Douglas is too late to stop the words that come out more cockily than he’d intended—not that he intended to say them out loud in the first place. Well, now they’re out there and he can’t take them back—at least it’s good that something about John just makes him think he can share the truth with him.
“It’s the only way you would have known I was in town. Did she come to you looking for me?” Victor starts again as if the conversation were simply on pause, his expression nervous.
Sherlock and Sherrinford are speaking to one another in low tones, effectively giving John the space he needs to work through the craziness. It has taken years, but Sherlock finally learned to shut up when John gets that special glazed look in his eyes. Apparently, Sherrinford understands that without being told.
Well, it’s like this. I work for this detective who lives here in London, except for that time he had to leave, but he’s here now and I don’t think he’s going anywhere like that ever again…anyway, I’m sort of like the ‘ears and eyes of the city’…or at least that’s what he says; yet he calls John the ‘romantic.’
and John is positive that having their family around him is helping, too.
Douglas comes to with a thumping headache; he’s aware enough to turn the ignition on the golf cart. Though his hands are shaking badly, he manages enough control to know that he’s got to find Sherlock and warn him of what must be happening inside the guard shack. He hesitates for a few seconds but he doesn’t hear any particularly strenuous sounds from inside so he makes up his mind and backs away from the shack and hightails it towards the various hangars and Quonset huts where he and John left the two Holmes brothers earlier.
Sherlock blinks rapidly, gripping John’s hands in his own. “Thank you,” he manages. Behind him, Ophelia smiles warmly.
They don’t speak again until the car pulls to a stop in front of Speedy’s. John gathers the Cat in his arms, cradling paws with extended claws on his palms so that the nice leather of Mycroft’s car doesn’t fall victim to any more territory-marking behavior.
And then Sherlock is right there, long fingers digging into the denim covering John’s thighs, lean body pushed against John’s chest and their lips together somewhere in between. John grunts under the suddenness of Sherlock’s shift in movement, raising both hands to cradle the back of his head, fingers tangling in the soft ringlets there.
John reaches for the cardigan and slips it on, ignoring the scrubs. “Thank you,” he says gruffly. “Won’t be here much longer.”
. John hands Nova down to him and she goes through her entire greeting routine again. I’ve got the distinct impression I’ve just found her a new home, but it’s probably best to make Sherlock think it was his decision. John cocks an eyebrow in my direction. All I can do is shrug and wish that I could feel the smile I’ve plastered on my face. It feels too fake, so I let it drop.
Monk!
Waves of color encompass the entire place: bright waving banners of orange, yellow and red. To John Watson, it is like being in the middle of a massive, raging fireball. He can only imagine what the plethora of sights and smells are doing to his partner. The smell of fried dough and the laughter of children hang heavy in the air. A fighter jet swoops by overhead, howling as it flies by and rumbling the tarmac beneath the soles of his trainers; the slight wind it kicks up causes the material of his walking shorts to flutter against his legs.
For the smallest instant a hint of pink touches Sherlock’s cheekbones then he pulls back, still eyeing John closely. “As Ophelia told you last night, Mister Watson, Mister Norton’s spirit is lingering here out of a misguided attempt to protect his wife. The best thing you and the rest of Michael’s crew can do is an exorcism. He’s as much a fool in the afterlife as he was in this one. You may leave now, with my blessing.”
Sherlock hums and turns back to his phone when it pings. Finally, after two minutes, he thrusts it into his pocket with a rumbly growl. Reaching for his coffee, he sips it, frowns and gently replaces it, casually sliding it to the farthest edge of the table.
“I’m happy,” he tells her. Sophie plops herself down in his lap as there’s a quick knock at the door.
Ophelia glares at him a little because what she’d rather do is actually smack his arm like she does her brothers, but there’s no use in attempting to hit something less than solid, a lesson learned early in their acquaintanceship. “Jimmy, you know there’s no one like Sherlock. He says he only uses that stuff to shut down the voices in his head.” She rests her hands on her hips and turns her attention back to her brother.
John sighs and realizes he’s merely standing in the hallway in his pajamas with teeth that desperately need to be brushed and stubble that needs to at least be scraped at to be made presentable. He tucks his hands into the pockets of his dressing gown and shuffles towards the bathroom so to break the backlog of these uncomfortable thoughts. In times like this, there is nothing like a good, old-fashioned routine.
John reaches for the Cat but it’s too late, they are out of the old office; he can still hear footsteps on the stairs, getting closer as he lunges for the door, his head spinning from the pain of what he’s sure must be a broken nose. Using their link to Reach out towards Sherlock, he is discouraged to discover nothing but a white-hot rage; he realizes that he deserves it as much of it is aimed at him. He hangs his head, a wave of chills and nausea cresting like a wave through him. The last thing John hears is the sound of glass smashing somewhere on the floor above them, Victor howling like he’s gone rabid and a concerned voice asking John what the hell just happened here; as the fog takes over his mind, it occurs to him that he has no idea what the man’s name is.
Martin fights against the pain for a moment and attempts to look over his shoulder. The security guard who helped him out the exit door of Sherrinford’s hangar comes into view as he rolls Martin to his other side using his feet for leverage.
“That’s…that’s incredible.” John stammers.
(Oh! Hai! Didn’t realize you all were back already! Heh. Wanna know what I was doing? –does shifty eyes-)
“Yes. There is a bit of weight to it.” Mycroft says carefully, his eyes wider than usual. “Ophelia, hello.”
They walk across the grounds towards the hotel, John thinking and Sherlock quiet.
“Well?” John asks as Sherlock drops down beside him on the bench.
John stands dumfounded for a moment, realizing that not only did he fail to actually do anything, he also completely forgot to ask Sherlock how he knew what was happening. Shaking his head again, he starts looking for a cab.
Mid-afternoon in London is always the same: when the sun is shining in any manner, people are everywhere. John shouts for Sherlock again, knowing it’s a useless endeavor as his voice barely carries above the din of chatter, honks of automobiles, the loud engines of busses and even the muffled bark of a small dog tucked into a lady’s handbag somewhere.
“I was trying…”
Sherlock stops short of the downed bi-plane and John rushes past him, pushing him out of the way. Immediately, Sherlock turns and holds his arms out, stopping the general public from getting in the way. A tall, broad-shouldered older man is jogging towards him, claiming to be a medic. Sherlock sees through the lie but has already deduced that that both the pilot and the wingwalker need help, so he allows the man past him. Sirens fill the air as the safety crew heads towards the crash.
Mummy nods, her eyes flashing as if hurrying him along.
“Edward Norton?” Mummy asks, rhetorically. She taps at her tea cup with a long, well-manicured fingernail. “Could you be referring to Eddie?” Tilting her chin, she indicates a tall, frail looking gentleman over in the corner. He is dressed in a WWII uniform, though Sherlock cannot make out the details.
Sherlock tries to scream, to plead for reality, but his voice is gone, lost in the smoky wind kicked up from the ferocity of the flames licking greedily at the walls surrounding them. Ophelia twists in his arms, her body all scales and sinew as she grips his shoulders, claws sinking in to her fingertips, raising bloody welts. Sherlock doesn’t question his lack of clothing, only his inability to save his little sister.
The next text he gets is an affirmative reply. Sherlock says he will meet John at a small café about three blocks from the park where he is now. John smiles, tucks his phone back into his pocket and starts walking.
Sherlock sighs, cracks one eye and even rolls it. “No, John,” he drawls.
Sherlock stays on her heels so as not to lose sight of her in the room suddenly densely populated with figures. She sits down in a white chair next to a small round table and Sherlock takes the other one. Mummy snaps her fingers. Before she’s finished the motion, however, she seems to have conjured up a small pot of tea and two cups.
John Sends, but doesn’t turn around and look back.
Janey?
In the comfortable silences that fall into the natural rhythm of their conversation about the case, John picks out the soft susurrus of Sherlock’s coat swishing gently against the backs of his legs, the easy tap of their shoes on the pavement, and even more importantly, the contented, vibrant hum of their Link. It’s all made easy because there aren’t many other people around tonight, most choosing to stay in where it’s warm.
With that, Mike gives him a polite goodnight and heads towards the door. Before opening it, though, he turns back to John. “John, be careful with him, alright?”
“Look,” Sherlock nods towards the floor. A layer of dust covers the wood, though it has been stirred up by footprints.
She’s stretched out on the sofa in the sitting room and suddenly the world is filled with colors. Perhaps she can rainbow to catch up and Sherlock will digestives listen and he will share purple with her all the chaos in his silly brain his super swift treacle intelligent mind that mushrooms and pizza and American telly I like rock and roll on the jukebox Mummy what’s this for? It is cold in here and I need to build a fire… red fire is so pretty…thank you Jimmy, you can be a good help chocolate bars Sherlock always knows what pudding we are going to say before we say it…did I tell you orange Mycroft said sometimes not the truth our dead uncle and…
Not such a straightforward answer to John, though he can sense his partner has seen right through it. Victor taps his fingers against the tabletop.
John clambers down off the boulder, every limb stiff, not moving fast enough. It’s like trying to swim through cold marmalade. He knows he’s screaming, calling out for Toby as he pulls his ruined body towards the tree line. He stabs the cane down a little too hard and it sticks in the soft turf beneath a pile of last year’s leaves. John falls to the ground, but only for a moment and he’s pulling himself back up on the wooden stick. It snaps and a cry is torn from his throat to the heavens above, where blue sky has turned to grey. There’s an answering cry, a terrible, pitiful sound and the feeling that some god has reached into his heart and rent the beating organ in two as it is forced from his chest.
Sherlock’s story cuts off abruptly as his eyes take in the newcomer, who seems to only be seeing the detective.
John finally manages to clear his mouth long enough to sip at his tea. “I don’t even know where to start. Grant, Victor or the circus?”
“I don’t
Sherlock huffs and rolls his eyes. Martin looks embarrassed, as he still feels new here.
Sherlock mumbles something that Mrs. Hudson doesn’t hear, his expression far away. She reaches up and grabs his shoulder, squeezing as hard as she can. Apparently it is enough to get his attention. He finally meets her eyes, his fringe hanging willy-nilly over his forehead, his eyes filled with so many emotions at the same time that she would be hard-pressed to name them all.
John shakes his head, visibly relaxing in their nearness. Sherlock cautiously rests his hand on John’s hip and sighs. He hasn’t liked forcing himself to not touch him.
Grant’s mouth turns downward almost comically, but the man looks quite crushed, feeling the dismissal coming on. He shakes his head. “It isn’t just the money, Mr. Holmes, you understand. It’s just that I
“Oh no, you aren’t getting out of it that easily,” John playfully swats at Sherlock’s lovely behind as he half-drags Sherlock to the door, only noticing the cocky smirk playing over his lips as he turns to close the door behind them.
“Sherlock that is starting to worry me. Give me something to go on. Your dead parents aren’t stored back here or anything are they?” John tries for a bit of levity, but Sherlock’s expression changes from one of pain to horror, though his answer is anything if not cryptic.
, thinks John. Sherlock grips the arms of his chair and makes to stand up.
Sherlock is on his knees…
Finally, John goes eerily silent. He is no longer attached to any of the machines when the nurses and the doctor step away from him. John angrily glares at them, the scarlet of his face broken only by the glittering of tear tracks and the stormy blue of his eyes.
Sherlock’s rational side knows it should hurt; he knows that the fire should be burning him but the only thing he can feel is the weight and the pain of guilt. Redbeard is crying and baying, having given up on barking either minutes or hours ago. Time is meaningless here as is life.
so he simply orders John to do what he wants.
“Ophelia?” he asks, his voice raspy, eyes cracked open against the weak winter sunlight.
Wilson chuckles and Greg laughs.
You know?
Sherlock impulsively wraps his arms around John’s shoulders and drags him in tight, pressing the injured man snugly against his chest. Sherlock curls over him so that John’s face is against Sherlock’s shoulder, Sherlock’s nose buried in the hair above John’s ear.
Ophelia frowns at Sherlock as John stands up. Sherlock frowns right back. He can feel his sister’s ire but decides to ignore it.
: stacks of papers, books everywhere, his and his laptops, and random detritus from whichever case just ended plus the addition of a new one or sometimes more than that under way. There’s nothing pinned to the wall over the sofa at the moment, just the yellow smiley doing is job by hanging there and trying to make everything better.
John understands the expression plastered on Douglas’ face all too well. It is the look of a man who fell so hard and so fast that he’s had absolutely zero chance to analyze it. John saw it on his own face in the mirror so many times in the first few months of his acquaintance with Sherlock that it gives him a strong sense of kinship with the other man.
First, let me tell you that I had posted 'some' of this story about a year ago but as far as I got with it, I couldn't make it work and I fell completely head over heels in
Back home with the tea made once again, John is seated comfortably in his chair, patiently waiting on Sherlock who has locked himself in the loo.
him?' All night his dreams are haunted by laughing children, lonely old ladies and vivid green eyes staring right into his soul.
Later, the hour virtually unnamable, John fiddles with the kettle without actually ever turning it on. He blinks quickly, attempting desperately to keep the memories at bay of a past threatening to obscure the present.
“Name’s Douglas,” Douglas allows as he pulls himself up and over the wing to get to the front seat, following the blond-haired man who seems to know what he’s doing.
“I know. We need to talk…but…” He asks in a low voice as he points at the door.
“Apparently you don’t believe he had a secret, then?” John asks, not looking at her but staring at the two devices in his hands, the EVP reader in his right and the EMF meter in his left. Lines and squiggles are dancing over both screens. “How is this possible?”
House! Turn off the porn. (I had no idea you could do
Sherlock shifts back a couple of paces so that he’s leaning against the chrome bench. He sets the safety glasses down behind him, accidentally knocking off a clear plastic container that clatters loudly against the floor. John visibly startles, giving Sherlock a glimpse into his exhausted mental state.
The onlookers turn back to their breakfasts while they make their way to their table occupied by Martin and Mrs. Hudson. Martin is wearing one of John’s old soft army T-shirts and a borrowed pair of khaki shorts. Mrs. Hudson is dressed in a flowery blouse that oddly matches the skort Sophie has on. She’s tried to tame the little girl’s hair, but the curls are pulling out of the pony tail every which way but the right one.
“How?” John is openly staring now; he shakes his head against the onslaught of information, replaying what he had gleaned from their physical contact while still out cold.
“Two to three weeks. Whoever did this held her captive for that long.” Sherlock glides around the autopsy table then leans over the woman, arms spread, weight resting on his gloved hands. John’s eyes meet his from opposite ends of the table; John can tell Sherlock is imagining all sorts of horrors that can be done to a human being in that amount of time.
“Good,” Barkley pats the back of Martin’s head roughly then leans back to inspect his handiwork. “You are a cute little bastard, it’s too bad I don’t swing that direction,” Barkley mutters as he tightens up the shoulder strap. “Well, it’s been a good day for me, I think I will be seeing you in a couple of hours when it is time for your act!” He starts to climb down, then hesitates and pops back up.
“Awww, don’t be like that.” Ophelia states as she drops off the back of the couch to the cushions below, crossing her legs. “I’m tired of seeing you so alone.”
Douglas reaches over and grasps Martin’s solid forearm, not hard, but enough to let the other man know he appreciates what he’s trying to say. He gets the impression that sometimes Martin has a hard time getting out what he means.
“It’s awful,” Sherlock complains prissily.
“Good evening,” the older girl says. She reaches up to brush back a ginger curl that’s fallen down over her face then lets her fingers trail backwards through a long ponytail.
“I love Grant, Mr. Holmes, with my entire heart. I would never steal from him.” Victor is explaining in a no-nonsense manner when John is able to give the conversation his undivided attention.
House watches closely and thinks about spreading something
If that’s the case, that makes him the oldest member of this odd circle, he’s sure of it. Even the eldest one is still younger than him by a few years. He shakes his head. Deep in the back of his mind, where voices like Carolyn’s live, there’s a tiny whisper of what could possibly even be
“Oi!” John calls out.
? Dad, did you see all the flags? And there were these people! They had a dog in a baby carriage!”
John opens his eyes and stares at the roof of the ambulance. It takes a few seconds for the memory of what’s happened to rush to the forefront of his mind; the knowledge arrives along with a new throbbing on his forehead, right over his nose, bad enough to make his eyes water.
When the fingering almost pushes him over the edge one last time and he decides that he can’t take it anymore, he nudges Sherlock’s shoulders with his hands then slips them down to finish undoing the zipper on Sherlock’s leather trousers. The position is a bit awkward, but he manages to do it without pulling out any pubic hairs or hurting either one of them. Sherlock exhales at the feeling of the cool air and John’s palm on his dick simultaneously. John strokes him three times, tightening his fist with every stroke.
John nods, a sharp tilt of his chin, showing that he understands time is of the essence, then crosses the small space and takes his chair, resting his arms on the side of it.
“It’s fine,” John says, holding Sherlock’s gaze with his own. They step away from one another and Sherlock looks away. A faint glimmer of light catches twin tear tracks on his face; he goes quiet and seems to be calculating something.
Stretches, he’s glad to find that he didn’t tip over and fall out of the chair this time. Frowning at the window then the front door of the small house his parents lived in prior to their deaths, it suddenly occurs to him that he’s alone. One day they’re going to have to do an experiment and find out just how far Ophelia can travel without him.
Then what, Douglas? He asks himself. What then? He certainly isn’t getting any younger and he is man enough to admit that in his past romances there has never been one that affected him in the instantly visceral way that seeing that waif thin agile little ginger up on the wing of that plane did. The confusing tangle of emotions seems to swing between a great desire to throw himself between Martin and the rest of the world or throw him down and have his way with him in front of the rest of the world.
For a moment, the Cat studies the Owl. It seems that he is as disinclined to answer as ever. Mycroft hisses lightly.
“Mmm…baby you say the sweetest things to me.”
“Well, fuck,” he bites between his teeth. It looks as if he’s well and truly stuck. With nothing else to do except to make an attempt at keeping his mind from thoughts he has no desire to examine at the moment, John gets off the bed and starts pacing the room, holding his arms stiffly at his sides, fingers tightly clenched into fists. As much as he fights it, when he starts thinking about why he’s here, Toby’s eyes flash in the forefront of his worried mind and all he can do is hold on against the inevitable comparisons between his partners that are forcing themselves to be made.
“So, it appears you’re related to one of the most almost-famous men in England.”
Feel sorry for him, because when he wakes up in a few moments, he’s getting pounced on by House
“Yes, ma’am,” Mycroft doesn’t quite mutter as he quickly vacates the chair.
Victor drops down on the ground next to him, leaving only enough distance that they aren’t touching. “What’re you reading?”
“A face?”
“John.”
“Right. Am I missing something?”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Really, John, you should have gone to bed much sooner, then you would be more alert this morning.”
him say it. House smirks but says nothing, choosing to stay behind his desk at the moment (or until something
In his bedroom, John pulls on an old long-sleeved t-shirt and a pair of worn pajama bottoms. He grabs the paperback he’s been reading off his bedside table, thoughts turning again to the memory of Sherlock telling him bluntly that he doesn’t trust Sherlock. Which he could argue until he’s blue in the face…save for the fact that Sherlock is right. Well, partially, anyway. John sighs, rubbing his hand over his face. There are two very big things that he doesn’t really want to share just yet. One of them is big enough that he barely lets himself think about it, banishing it from his mind as quickly as it appears. The other one is simply that he keeps finding that he wants
Sherlock acknowledges them all, one by one, taking note of the name badges his subconscious has chosen to add to their clothing, the styles of which span decades. He weaves between them, finally stopping in front of a stately, elegantly attired white haired woman. Her name badge has two sets of numbers written on it: her birthdate and the day she died. Two important times Sherlock knows so well he doesn’t really need to see them.
It has started to drizzle some and John has almost had enough walking for one night when a flash of blue-red-blue-red lights and a screeching siren catch his attention. He quickens his step and checks down several alleys before he finds the one cordoned off by an investigative crew. He wanders closer and closer towards the yellow tape barricading a floodlit area in the corner where two big buildings meet. From his current vantage point, which happens to be facing directly into a pair of enormous lights that are set out on the ground. The steady but gentle fall of rainwater could easily be diamonds the way they catch the bright beams.
John wonders if the man knows what those long, dark eyelashes and eyes the color of fine jade are doing to him. And that mouth. God.
John’s attention is recaptured as Sherlock shifts again, his cheek resting against John’s leg and the rest of him curling about like a long, lean plant seeking sunlight.
John accepts this. “Right then. Back to now. I’m not ignoring that, understand, I just see no reason to make you relive it at the moment. You’ll tell me if and when you’re ready, yeah?”
John squares his stance, opening his arms wide and balancing on the balls of his feet, wholly prepared to bear hug and wrestle the man to the floor in as efficient a manner possible. The shifter throws a wrench in that plan, however, by veering sideway, tripping over his own feet and falling directly over the Cat.
Somehow between the nausea, a telephone call to his employer, and a staff doctor flitting in and out of the little room, Sherlock remains with his back against the wall, an elegant, unmoving sentinel. After what seems like hours, but is only about forty-five minutes according to the clock, he finds himself alone with his brother for the first time in almost twenty years.
(Trust. Me.)(I’m really not.)
The old woman stands over by the wall and watches me clean myself from the basin I get after I eat the soup. I’ll save my bread for later, she lets me do that. The old woman never says anything at all. Nothing about the night or the days or the lack of
So I bought myself a cuppa and I remember looking at the remaining quid and wondering what I was going to do with it. I stuffed it into my pocket and walked to the meeting place. A little while later, right in the middle of the crowd that just parted around us like water goes around a stone, on the street he’s showing me a photograph of the guy I’m supposed to look out for. I look up to him and into those funny-shaped and funny-colored eyes and he’s looking right back at me.
Mycroft doesn’t exactly sigh. “I have been talking about
“Sounds great!” Douglas grabs Martin’s hand again but this time doesn’t quite let go, holding onto it for longer than necessary.
He hopes it never does. “Sorry to change your plans,” he says to Greg.
“Did you find anything?” he asks, pulling back from Sherlock but not letting go of his arms.
It is hot. The colors are burning.
!) are happily sipping coffee and watching their respective geniuses. Watson is perfectly accustomed to his genius’s brand of ‘normal,’ though he has to admit, it’s always entertaining to see someone else’s.
“Well, then, Doctor Stamford, we will continue this rather fascinating conversation in tomorrow night’s episode of Aliens Were Here First…”
Sherlock blinks up at her for a second as if he’d forgotten she was there. “Oh,” he says, standing up to pull the chair over for her. Its metal legs squeak a little against the floor and John’s eyes fly open.
“Come here, girl,” I call to the red and white pup. She scrambles across the floor, her fat little belly swinging and her ridiculous tongue lolling out the side of her mouth. Sometimes I feel sorry for her, I mean, come on, who crosses a bulldog with a lab in the first place? I don’t think that story’s quite true, though, ‘cause there’s got to be some other weird terrier-thing in there, probably a dachshund or some such, she’s got such dainty paws.
Sherlock eyes John’s tightening fists, choosing not to answer, searching for words yet after all this time, some things defy them. “We got them all out.”
“Relax, John,” though his tone is soft, there is no mistaking the command beneath the words.
John desperately wants to touch. He reaches out and white lights flash around him as a mayfly the size of a horse with transparent, tissue-thin wings hovers in front of his face for a millisecond, the meaningless associations plunging his mind back down into darkness.
For almost the entirety of the next week, Sherlock is kept busy doing what he does best: unraveling crimes. Right beside him, John is kept busy going between being whatever the detective needs at the moment and a few scant hours at the clinic. With all of this activity, there’s little time to discuss more than stolen jewelry, the method of killing someone with a brass doorknocker, paperwork for the Met, and the age-old question of ‘is this really coffee or did you get it out from beneath a truck?’
Sherlock reflects on how easy it is to destroy everything they’ve been building up between them in forty-eight hours. He gazes back at John, this time not schooling his features into the ‘I don’t care’ expression; instead he leaves himself wide open for whatever attack John needs to make upon his person. Sherlock will not fight back, not this time. To his ears, his own shaky exhalation is proof of his shattered world view, his ruined self-worth and his devastated heart.
“Someone take this, I can’t stand the feeling of it anymore! I need to bathe now, let me out of here.” Ambrose cries.
“Yes, Sherlock. Yes,” John says out loud, since he is unable to piece together any coherent thought as Sherlock fingers him into oblivion.
“I don’t have too much to tell you, other than Daniel Hudson was fifty five when he was executed in Florida for the brutal stabbings of four university-age females.”
to do it. As it swings open, the daylight catches on the only plane inside and a look passes between them. A rumble overhead reminds them that the show is in full swing and there is only so much time to waste. They don’t speak when Sherrinford steps back to allow Sherlock the first look into the hangar.
The Cat stands up on his hind legs in John’s in order to bump his head against the bottom of John’s chin. John smiles at him and strokes the silky fur down his back. With the other hand, he retrieves his tea in order to take a sip of it. Sherlock purrs as he’s curling up. He gives a very human-sounding sigh and John rests his head on the back of the chair, preparing to Accept whatever Sherlock is going to show him.
Sherlock snorts. “Near enough.” Ophelia flips him the bird and does her best impression of Mycroft’s weary expression at the same time.
“I…I don’t…” he stutters, the expression on his face one of utter terror.
Sherlock shakes his head, straightens up then slowly folds down to his knees, gripping John’s thighs. He clears his throat with a frown against the obvious pain. After a moment, he explains with a whisper, “Belarus. Berwick. The Osprey is Barry’s brother, Damon.”
Mike Stamford, John’s boss and long-time friend, is the original founder of LOPNI: London Paranormal Investigation. When people ask him what that means exactly, and they do because John is the kind of bloke that everyone talks to whether he’s in the mood for conversation or not, he does his best to explain that they visit alleged hauntings and do their best to retrieve any scientific proof that spirits exist.
and never brought to mind?
After a moment, Wilson decides that he better go and see what is going on with House and gives the others a nod. Captain stares after him, thinking that it is possible he’s the only American left in the room.
(Really? Neatly? God, that is so very British of them. Let’s face it, the Americans would run in there screaming like the cowboys we are and telling everyone to ‘get down or we’ll shoot!)
Yeah, right. Like Sherlock’s ‘
Sherlock pushes him towards the chairs and busies himself with the tea. “Most of the girls have family who have been searching for them. Though there will be no one to stand trial against, there will be an official ruling of the case that will allow them to receive counselling and such.”
Both boys fall silent, Sherlock in the bed, Mycroft standing behind their mother with his arms at his sides.
Out of morbid curiosity, John follows him. Sherlock looks up from the tome he’s holding, gives Lestrade a nod then completely tunes everyone else out.
The pleasant melody of John’s giggles fills the empty spaces in Sherlock’s heart the way he’s believed for so long that nothing ever could; it penetrates his sterling defenses, chips at the icy layer he’s carefully molded into place around him—a transparent shield that people can clearly feel and mostly misunderstand. It has never been about keeping people
(Here’s where the narrator breaks in again…I ship an awful lot of ships…but I just can’t ship Wilson/House…because House is pretty much, well, a slut. Wilson needs a partner that is a bit more
“Ignore him, John,” Sherlock rumbles.
leaves you physically and emotionally drained.
“John,” Sherlock intones, his voice low and deep in the fresh silence of the flat. He doesn’t touch the other man, but reaches out a hand as if he’d like to do exactly that. “John.”
“Actually, you know, I really would. My street clothes are in the plane…” Martin covers his mouth with his hand. “How bad was it?” he asks around his fingers.
John shakes
going to work.)
Douglas interrupts her, “Carolyn, he can fly. I saw enough of that insane landing Monday. I think I can trust putting my life in his hands.”
“Bloody hell,” John states in a bland voice that actually sounds much less so than he feels.
“Sherlock, none of that.” John says without turning around.
John knows that’s almost like being told he’s
“I’m hale, John,” Sherlock says aloud, voice cracking. The normal hum along their Link has changed its tune, from a constant mental vibration to an in and out hum-buzz-hum that reminds John of the struggles of a bird trying to break out of its eggshell.
Sophie has planted herself in Martin’s lap. He is sitting in the center of the sofa bed with the covers pulled up over his chest. Sophie, Martin, and Sherlock remind John forcefully of a bunch of vultures waiting on their victim to die so they can pluck his bones. He silently thanks whatever deity is listening that Mycroft is otherwise occupied or this poor sergeant would never have a chance. Not with this crowd.
John eyes the girl child’s teeny white tootsies and smiles.
Sherlock nods his agreement and lets her back to the ground. He holds out his hand to her and takes her little one in his big one. When he smiles softly at John, John wonders if the little fluttering sensation in his chest is ever going to stop.
“Charm people that way.”
“Daddy! Papa!” Sophie shrieks as she climbs out of her chair and runs across the packed dining room when Sherlock and John enter. People watch her as she crosses the floor and some of them even smile when Sherlock scoops her up into his arms. He nuzzles noses with her and she leans over to hug John’s neck, too.
Sherlock inhales deeply and brings his legs up to the table in order to cross them, getting into a perfect lotus position. He aligns his spine and closes his eyes, opening his own channels and Sending calm thoughts along their Link. He tells himself that he does not mean to pry, but he’s had no chance to test their Link, at least not the way John has, so he takes his time, counting the seconds by using his own heart as a metronome. There’s no way to actually ‘break into’ another person’s thoughts, which he already knows, but curiosity drives him on anyway.
The dormouse observes him a few minutes more, primly sitting up on its hind legs with its front paws under its chin. Long whiskers move back and forth as its tiny nose crinkles. With a tiny squeak, it leaves him. John’s eyes follow its skittering form as it scoots right through the open doors that on a closer inspection reveal the larger building around them to be St. Bart's Hospital.
“No, can’t say that I have. How do you pronounce it?”
“Thank you.”
That takes a moment to sink in. John sighs and drops back down in the chair he just vacated. “Who were they, then?” he asks, gesturing at the table top where Mary Beth had been sitting.
By the light of two more bare bulbs on opposite ends from where they stand, John stares around the room, clearly taking in how the back wall is missing, though there is most of another canvas tarp covering it. It crinkles and groans as a slight breeze from outside presses against it.
John is now shaking his head whilst the large man beneath the scrawny bum of the older woman is simply lying there, staring at the ceiling.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock half snarls as he jerks his arm away from her. “Go find something to do. I’ll be up…”
Sherlock looks over at him, shrugs then frowns. Before he gets the chance to say anything else, however, both men find their attention pulled to the house when another glass-shattering crack cuts clearly across the deserted yard. John is just beginning to consider the source of the sound, but, true to his inquisitive nature, Sherlock is already moving towards it.
“Yes. I trust him, Douglas,” John tells him, squinting a little and holding his hand over his eyes. “I think it’s that one.” He points towards a small building, a hut really, beside the entrance gate to the airfield.
“Oh, do carry on, gentleman. Seems like it was going to be a good show!” Victor booms.
“MJN is taking care of that for you, as well. Promise me you won’t party like a teenager.” She smirks.
John is quiet as he processes all of the information. Finally he stands up from the sofa, the doll still clutched in his hand. “Come on,” he commands without stopping to allow Sherlock time to argue or balk. He walks right past and doesn’t stop until he’s perched on a stool at the breakfast bar in the kitchen and Sherlock is opposite him.
Once Sherlock gets the door unlocked—at least that much has changed, because last time they were here, everything was wide open—he steps up to the threshold and turns towards John. The wooden door creaks on its hinges as Sherlock grabs it to keep it from banging against the side of the house.
loud enough to be heard in Wiesbaden.
Finally, after an indeterminate amount of time that may have been five minutes or five hours, they all wind up in front of another nondescript, plain, institutional-grey door.
John is probably going to laugh about that for an incredibly long time.
“Damned thing,” she mutters then finishes off the rather delicious tea, if she does say so herself. Moving from the table, she gathers her single saucer, single cup and her spoon and drops them into the sink to be washed after a while. There’s more important things to be seeing to today. Martha heads towards her bedroom to change into some more respectable clothes, what is it the kids call them nowadays? Ah, that’s it,
John gestures at the magnificent aircraft. “So what do you do, then?”
It is there, at the bottom of that forty-eighth hour that John’s limbs begin to tremble, his breathing comes a little faster, his pulse rate begins to climb…and then he furrows his brow and opens his eyes.
Sherlock, distracted, only gives John a cursory answer. “Worn,” he says.
“Sherlock, someone knowing you isn’t a good enough reason to poke holes in a tablecloth, and you know it. You wouldn’t do that at Angelo’s.”
“Let me pull you up on the map, John,” Dale informs him. “Ten seconds.”
“Oh, child, I’m so sorry,” Mrs. Hudson coos at me, tucking my face against her shoulder. Nova gives a little yelp when we accidentally squeeze her between us so I pull back a little and put the pup on the floor. She doesn’t go far, just next to my feet, whining up at me a bit as if unsure what’s happening.
A heavy silence descends over the room as Sergeant Barkley cruises through. Apparently, his own coworkers like him about as much as John does.
“We’ve got to go.”
It takes John a moment to realize that he wouldn’t want to hang around in a dusty old attic much longer than he needed to, either, much less one where he’d been imprisoned for a day and a half.
(He’s practiced this art a lot over the years…illegal military firearms for starters.)
Instead of the normal happy buzz he usually feels, their Link whirrs a bit; if John could see the colors he would insist on the one coming from Sherlock’s direction is icy blue. John turns that over in his mind a few times, curious as to why the detective is feeling so cold towards him at the moment.
Sherlock words stay put in his mouth because John makes a snap decision and decides the detective needed a kiss right then. Sherlock reciprocates, his hand slowly working its way up John’s shoulder, to the collar of his shirt and then to the back of his neck where it rests. As their kiss grows more heated, he takes the initiative and slowly moves his palm to the front of John’s jeans, not quite surprised in the least to feel the heat of arousal there.
Martin takes another sip of his wine then sets the glass on the table with only the slightest clunk. His hands are trembling.
“John.”
“Well, Mr. Richardson, I do believe it says that you’ve found what was missing,” a deep tone echoes his.
Mycroft chooses that very fraction of time to make an appearance in the sitting area. He halts two paces from Sherlock’s chair, staring at the violin bow as it seemingly bounces in midair. “That’s her, isn’t it?” he asks in an uncharacteristically small voice, visibly restraining himself to keep from pointing in the direction of the now twirling bow.
John Sends out as he dresses for the day.
John narrows his eyes and sneaks his hand around Sophie’s side, trying to get his sunglasses back as nonchalantly as possible. She squeals and pulls away, landing in a heap between Sherlock’s thighs. She’s fine but as soon as she sees that John’s got his glasses, her bottom lip sticks out and she makes
Together they share another laugh and John is still giggling under his breath five minutes later when they are redressed and he’s turned on the kettle and they can both hear the client’s footsteps on the stairs in the hall.
John groans under his breath again, throwing his head back. Sherlock takes advantage of the situation and attaches his lips then teeth to the side of John’s neck. John is a warm weight in his hand, his legs under Sherlock’s thighs trembling slightly from the pinned-down position. Sherlock studies his face, using the knowledge of his own body and John’s expressions to let him know when John is so very close.
Sherlock continues to stare at John, his brain going deathly silent.
John takes a long look around the room, noticing the coating of dust on what furniture is there, the antique wallpaper and the ceiling that could do with a fresh coat of paint. Three bookcases, one tall, two short still have a few old looking books on them. Even so, it seems too nice of a place to be empty. A stray thought occurs to him then.
His joyous laugh is apparent in his Mindspeech and Toby smiles back before wrapping her arms around his neck. He rucks her t-shirt up over her breasts and nuzzles close, thinking only of his joy in finding happiness in this almost-intolerable place. When they finally climb back into the bunk together, their Link hums and vibrates with happiness and he finds himself almost drowning in it.
“Have you met Edward Norton in your astral travels?”
, there haven’t been many secrets between them. Truly, he never really asked any straightforward questions about Sherlock’s family…and wasn’t that just the rub, right there? Very few times in their friendship did Sherlock ever really evade a direction question. John never really asked.
Is that little smirk actually a grin? John shakes his head. “Well, maybe ten years ago, but no thanks.” He brushes his knees off, giving his brain time to catch up. Best to ask the most important questin first. “What the hell was that thing, anyway?”
“Indeed.” Ophelia agrees, taking the seat Mycroft just vacated with an equal amount of grace.
The man nods and retrieves a pair of jeans and a green t-shirt from the depths of Sherlock’s bedroom. He slips the shirt on as he passes John, showcasing his build and a tattoo on his left shoulder blade that John recognizes as the Royal Navy insignia. The tattoo is relatively new, the dark blue ink still bright in places, the skin around the design red and irritated. Tugging the hem of his shirt down, he pulls a chair away from their kitchen table into the center of the room and sits down on it, expression openly curious, hands clasped together in his lap.
“Go quietly,” he whispers in a rough growl into John’s ear. John nods in understanding.
“Sherlock, get up!”
“I don’t know what the hell you’re playing at! He’s dead! He’s gone! Get out!”
(See?!)
Sherlock narrows his eyes as John’s entire frame begins to tremble. “It all makes perfect sense,” he says, pitching his voice to a quiet roar. He does not like the haphazard buzz of the Link right now, it is disconcerting. John is angry, but he’s angry for the wrong reason.
knows intuitively about Sherlock it’s that the detective obviously trusts
“I’m sorry?”
John’s eyes shine and he blinks several times rapidly. “I don’t believe you’d ever sell me up the river that way, Sherlock. In fact, I don’t think you’ve ever done anything remotely like that since.” When Sherlock indicates John is correct, he continues, allowing his channels to open fully now. “Good then. We are on the same page. Tell me what we need to do next and then I’m for tea, alright?”
“Five, at the moment.” He uncharacteristically answers. “John, I need to see that patient’s room again.”
Is the only warning Sherlock can give as he feels like he’s being pulled apart at both ends; there’s a push behind his eyes, alternately his body is nothing but heat before he goes cold and clammy and then, out cold, he falls forward against Victor’s chest. Somewhere in the back of his mind he hears a woman scream “Oh my God!” but he’s so far gone, now, he doesn’t even recognize his mother.
Oh wait, he’s not here.
Without another thought or sound, the Owl takes to the dark sky, leaving his little brother alone to ponder his next step; past behavior has shown Mycroft how Sherlock reacts to his older brother having a favorable opinion concerning any of the detective’s acquaintances, so this time he has made the decision not to interfere...at least until they give him a reason to do so.
“Go, John. We’ll be fine.”
“Let me try another way. The only reason why you couldn’t see ghosts is that you didn’t want to.”
Martin smiles at them. He really wants to talk to John about his date last night with Douglas, but he’s uncomfortable discussing it with Sherlock in the room.
A couple of lady cops showed up after that, including this lady with black hair and a snub nose. She didn’t seem very delighted when Sherlock came back to us, but then most people act like that around him. He said some stuff about ‘evidence’ and I stopped listening to much of anything after an ambulance pulled up. I got inside with the lady cop, she said her name is Sally, and she actually held my hand while she asked me a bunch of questions, most of which I couldn’t answer. I remember that I kept repeating, ‘it was dark and it hurt’ like some sort of mantra which really bothers me now, but at the time, I was out of it.
“I haven’t told you my name yet, John,” the redheaded girl says softly. She meets his eyes and he is taken aback to see tears there.
“So, you see, Mr. Holmes, my nephew has been AWOL for two months now and I was hoping…” Mable, their client, sobs politely into the pink handkerchief she’s clutching in her hand like a life preserver. “He’s such a gentle soul, there’s no way he’ll survive a Court Martial…”
John knows how close Sherlock is even before the side of his hand comes into contact with Sherlock’s tight balls; he’s more than ready to end this night and go home and collapse for about thirty hours. But, a promise is a promise and since Sherlock’s been more than accommodating about John’s little fantasies, he’s keen to give some of that back.
This investigation is not going well. Not at all.
“That’s not black paint,” John says aloud then takes a deep breath, smelling and almost tasting the lingering aroma of burnt wood.
“What for?” John queries.
an airplane—at least today—and was never a pilot,
Martin recalls last night’s conversations, allowing the Sherlock and John’s closeness wash over him. It is a balm to everything else that happened yesterday; certainly it doesn’t take it all away, but it isn’t hurting as badly, either.
“I concur,” Sherrinford agrees, his eyes on the padlock in his hand.
It was like this new freedom—even more than being free of everything, I suddenly had some cash in my pocket and a new respect for myself. I have my own place now. It’s small, but it’s mine and the most I’ve ever owned in my life. My biggest problem at the moment, though, is Nova. I can’t keep a pet there, so I’m here to see if anyone has any ideas. Or at least that’s the excuse I made up. Even I have to admit to needing a bit of comfort once in a while, I think I’ve earned a bit of it.
John agrees, though he’s not exactly sure how much help he’s going to be. “Do you mind if we hang out here a bit?”
Before he can say it out loud, Sherlock finds their positions flipped, John’s thighs bracketing his hips, straining erections pressed together. The pull of desire between them is the full force of the electromagnetic spectrum, a stop in time when crucial decisions are made.
Mike chuckles and some of the tension drifts away between them. He looks down at his watch. “I’ve got to be going, Molly, I’m really sorry to leave you with them like this. Let me get my class started and I’ll be back as soon as I can.”
“John, let me in. I know you're in there.”
Sherlock’s answer is multi-layered. John can clearly hear the detective’s natural elation at closing the case successfully, yet there is something
Sherlock mentally curls around their Link, not only Feeling but also Seeing the exact moment when John shifts back to the desert, back to that night. He does his best to Send Trust to John, in the event that the other man needs to know he’s still there.
1. great destruction or damage.
“The boy’s name is Geordie, John,” Sherlock mutters to himself as he wills the lights in the elevator to light up
“Take it easy there, Cinnabar, you can’t fly if you pass out cold!” Sherrinford laughs.
Sherlock returns his friend’s smile and quickly assesses the situation. “House, he’s been drugged. In as few words as possible, let me say he is ‘high as a kite.’” Sherlock points at House then at Monk.
“Yeah, we have a four-year old daughter named Sophie.” John tells him not without a hint of pride in his voice.
John shakes his head as if trying to put the new information in some sort of order. “Why have we never met?” he finally gets out, ignoring the obvious question about the Holmes family and names.
Martin shakes his head, ginger curls bouncing about. He laughs and it comes out rather strained. “I’ve always
“Not at all, Sherlock, I understand.” John starts to move away; the coldness of the distance making itself immediately apparent.
“The matter has been dealt with,” Mycroft informs them, his eyes never leaving John’s. He doesn’t even need to hear the words he’s sure John has spoken because they are written clearly in every line on his face, the tension in is spine and the new scuff on the toe of his right shoe. “Your help is appreciated more than you are aware.”
The third man, well, he just closes his eyes and hopes that by pretending he saw nothing that it will be true.
Sherrinford picks the lock with a professional ease Sherlock envies; mostly because his eldest brother did it in half the time it would have taken
He hesitates for a moment, considering the odd blankness that seemed to exist around the Osprey and the Eagle Owl that appeared out of nowhere, apparently a shifter dues et machina.
In truth, Sherlock Holmes is completely shattered and he blames no one but himself.
Sherlock pushes back in his chair and reaches out for his partner, wrapping his long arms around John’s waist and reeling him in, then plasters his face against John’s only-slightly soft stomach and sighs. John knows he’s like a puppy with a bone and if he doesn’t get out of the house soon, there are going repercussions that aren’t going to pretty.
“Yes,” Sherlock answers.
“If it helps, I can have copies uploaded to you by this evening,” Molly offers to Sherlock’s retreating form.
“Come on, Sherlock, surely up there in your gigantic brain you thought there may be some possibility.” John pokes at his temple with his index finger.
“You idiot, can’t you see that we are family?”
The detective hums lightly in the back of his throat, “and I, you, John.”
When John still doesn’t move, though he’s made progress, he’s got his shirt and his vest off, Sherlock gracefully raises himself up on his hands and scoots towards the left side of the bed, leaving an open space and a clear invitation, but on the off chance John has derailed completely, he Sends:
“Hello?” Martha gives up on the changing of clothes for the moment and sits down on her pink and purple flowered duvet in order to have a conversation. People are so rude these days, they never seem to take the time to just talk to each other, she considers as she straightens out a single wrinkle on her made-neat-as-a-pin bed.
John runs the flat of his palm from as high on Sherlock’s neck as he can reach, down the plane of his spine between his shoulder blades until it naturally comes to rest at the top of the painfully elegant swell of his buttocks. With the other hand, he grips Sherlock’s hip, dragging that plush behind against his erection, forcing a groan from his lips. Sherlock huffs a sigh as he arches his spine, seeking more of John’s heat while he reaches between them to fondle John’s sac, a move that rips a thick moan from John when he rolls first one ball then the other lightly in clever fingers.
“God, Sherlock.”John mutters.
Sherlock stares at it, then, realizing what he’s doing, blushes furiously and does his best to burrow into the book in his lap, saying nothing for fear his twisted tongue will betray his lack of experience.
Now, I’ve forgotten how to use language, any of them. I know Thomas is talking to me but I cannot answer back. It’s almost like I don’t understand any of his words, like they are coming through to me from a very long way away. The only thing more incomprehensible is the way he stretches out beside me in this smelly bed; he must not be a very tall man because his body is only a bit larger than my own. I worry when he puts his arms around me and pulls me in close to him. He never takes off his clothes. I hope they aren’t hurting him, too.
“Well, good morning, I wasn’t expecting you today, Sherlock. Are one of these yours? Well, I don’t mean yours yours, I mean are you here to examine one of the new ones?” Molly hangs her clipboard back on the wall next to the doors and gestures at the pair of bodies covered with white sheets on the tables nearest the sinks.
“Fuck. No.” Doctor Gregory House’s eyebrows threaten to jump into his receding hairline and the blue rubber ball he has just thrown bounces off the corner of his glass-topped desk and rolls across the floor to be stopped beneath the thin sole of a bespoke black leather dress shoe (UK size 12.) Long, well-made fingers pick it up and enclose it in a large fist.
Of course, John understands Sherlock’s particular brand of
Knowing full well Sherlock had to have been thinking about, or dreaming about…or in some psychic memory land where John cannot follow, well,
“How is she, Christopher?” John asks while Sherlock presses the button to send the lift down.
At the mention of those wonderful planes, Martin sits up a little straighter. Sherrinford shoots him a wink before he takes a sip of his wine.
They laugh until the waiter stops by for their order, John relieved and Sherlock just happy. The man grins widely at them and for a second Sherlock worries that he can Hear them, then he says ‘thank you’ and moves quietly along towards the kitchen. Sherlock relaxes a little more, soaking in the heat pouring off of John.
saying, and that is a very resounding
There in the hallway of the old Victorian, the melody crescendos: Sherlock’s deep purr of true merriment mixing joyously with John’s higher pitch, the sounds dancing with one another; the two men from very different walks of life lean against the wall together, shoulders brushing, creating a new combination as if they are unique instruments: strings and winds.
“Just call me Mable, Mr. Holmes,” she gets out between gasping sobs, choosing to ignore the fact that she’s already told him the same thing twice.
As he sweeps by our favorite British consulting detective…
“Would you…” John gestures vaguely from Sherlock’s head to his bare toes.
The world spins on its axis and the vacuum of space is taken up by white light; blinding white light that crashes around them like a tsunami; it slams against the walls to echo against Sherlock as if his body has just made itself into a radar…the blips on the screen in his mind all point to one person. The very foundations of Sherlock’s self-made fortress shake and tremble until some of the brightness fades away and he Reaches out carefully, a child searching in the dark for his favorite security blanket.
“What a wimpy little bitch you are, eh?” A man’s voice calls out from someplace behind him.
“So, what none of yous going even try? Doesn’t matter, I’ll take you down,” the Were drops his gaze onto John then to the Cat, “…then I’m gonna crush
They stay that way for a moment, soaking in what is happening. Back from the edge, John mutters, “My headache’s gone.”
With an exhale, Sherlock peels back the folded petals of the now-mostly dry shape that looks like a lotus.
Sherlock gives John his most ‘this is ridiculous’ glare and rubs the arms of his chair. He pushes off of it and strides out of the sitting room. :
John meets his gaze, the pleading look in his eyes and he can no more tell Sherlock not to say any more than he can control the tides. Brushing off a spot on a reasonably safe looking armchair, he sets the doll in his lap, crosses his legs and says, “Go on.”
“Sherlock, why are you still here? Greg was here hours ago with a new case.”
Sherlock takes one last lick and stands up, hiding the evidence and instantly dropping the sexy minx persona. John clenches his jaw and breathes through his nose just as a young mother with three tots in tow passes him, all three children looking right at Sherlock. He smiles at them, all honey and light.
Since that answer makes no sense, John leaves it. They walk without conversation for a few moments until they are standing in front of the cottage Grant described to them. John runs his hand over the back of the carved bench as they pass it, both men moving straight up to the front door as if they’re regular visitors and not complete strangers here.
“Hospitals don’t really have basements,” Thirteen pipes up, her eyes on Sherlock.
House and Monk continue on out of the room, followed by Stottlemeyer and Sally.
“No problem, we’ll catch up later.”
John decides pretending to read an upside-down book is pointless and drops it to the floor. He grins down at Sherlock who is quickly unzipping his fly now that the doctor’s full attention is on the detective. Long fingers deftly wind their way through two layers of fabric and denim-clad hips buck gently upwards into those dexterous digits.
“What?” Sherlock asks, a bit dumbfounded and though it is hard to miss, apparently rendered a bit slow by the misdirection of blood flow from his brain to parts much more southerly.
When he realizes that it is nothing, he falls heavily to his backside and forces himself to breathe slowly in an attempt to collect his racing heart.
“So, I’m gonna give you ten seconds to stop me from calling the local, uh, authorities," the deep voice booms out with a chuckle.
Well, at least he’s not bored, John thinks, picking up their order. He turns to ask Sherlock if he’s ready to leave and almost has a heart attack.
“What did I tell you this morning, Martin?” John asks, tilting his head in Douglas’ direction. He’s referring to the conversation they had while Sherlock was in the shower. John told Martin that it sounds like Douglas is already crazy about the younger man.
(Tell me at least one person gets that one…)
Sherlock settles them on his face with a nose crinkle and goes back to his reading. John lets out another sigh as he pops the case back into his pocket.
I can’t help it, I’m laughing again and so hard this time that a sharp pain lances its way across my side under my ribcage. I double over but the very idea of Billy Wiggins being a ruthless villain from a Batman episode is simply too hilarious to pass by. I can just see his dirty-blond hair sticking up like a weird topknot. God, I wish I could draw.
John contemplates the baggage storage and wonders how long it would take Sherlock to find him if he crawled through them. Maybe he’ll scoot over to the aisle seat and pretend that he doesn’t know Sherlock.
…and he knew before I did about the pregnancy and right then and there, I was sunk. My mouth went dry when I met his gaze again, because dammit, I’ve never been defined by the hours I’ve spent roughing it so I’m not about to be labeled as a
Mrs. Norton turns away from the hob where she’s fussing with a fresh pan of scones and grins at him. She’s got a bright pink oven mitt on her left hand. “Well, I’d like to thank you for the compliment, John, but somehow I don’t think it’s truly meant for me.”
Frustration mounts quickly and his newest fear is that he really is going to get his wires crossed. Striding across the room with purpose now, he stops in front of the door and lifts his foot, ready to kick it down. In the wee instant before it connects with the metal, however, the door is pushed open, resulting in nothing more than John landing hard on the tile on his backside.
It seems like it’s only been a few minutes since Barkley left him alone when Martin hears the snick of the door on the opposite side of the room open. He’s strapped into the pilot’s seat so tightly that he can barely turn his head to look around. Two different sets of footsteps approach and one moves away. Martin closes his eyes and offers a prayer up to whatever deity might possibly be listening to him that if he’s going to go out this way, please let it be quick. At least his aching leg has gone numb from the way it is wedged beneath his body. All he can hear for a few moments is the sound of his own heartbeat.
Of course, this ruckus finally enters the office and Sherlock looks up from his heinous heisting of House’s hapless hot hoochies with humongous hooters in time to grimace at certain parts of House’s anatomy that no longer seem so enamored of a certain copper who is most certainly not enamored of Holmes.
Martin has never really talked about this much to anyone, even those who were part of it, so it’s sort of cleansing to speak of it now, especially to someone who seems genuinely interested.
“The landing?” John asks him.
They are all finishing their meals when Mycroft joins them, but he’s not alone.
John opens his eyes, startled to see the white Dog with the blue eyes at his feet, pink tongue lolling out of his mouth, broadcasting loud and clear.
The Dog’s happy voice comes through, but it’s like listening at the other end of a scratchy phone connection. Even so, it’s clear enough and John is satisfied that they won’t lose each other.
Closing his eyes, John shoves all thoughts aside of Victor and Sherlock as young men and concentrates on the man as he is now, sitting on one of their heavily abused kitchen chairs, a bit out of his element. John holds onto that once-all-too-familiar feeling and accepts it as something they have in common outside of the Were most certainly watching the proceedings from the sofa. John can hear a soft mewl but ignores it as he Searches.
Neither man moves until John is standing in front of Sherlock, the coffee table pushed out of the way, his hands out to move the book from the detective’s lap. Gently, as if reaching across eons of time and space, he sets it on the table, out of the way. Then, Sherlock’s face is in his hands, their eyes are still locked and they are so close they are inhaling and exhaling nothing but one another. Echoes of the time they’ve spent together, so much time, dance down the Link, drawing them closer.
, though it is right on the tip of his tongue.
Sherlock is pacing the conference room like a caged panther. John is perched on one end of a long plastic table and Sherrinford is sitting on the opposite end of it. Both of them have their backs to the wall. They have all been speaking in low tones, but Douglas has been paying very little attention, instead concerned that no matter what they do it will be too late.
“Yeah, so have I.” John allows.
Grant frowns a bit, not quite derailed and a bit unsure. “Anyway, there were these noises coming from the place and then, then I saw
Dr. John Watson, formerly of Her Majesty’s army, now lies prone on a hard hospital cot and dreams, soldierly even in his stiff shoulders and tense hands. A blonde woman wearing a red coat smiles at him in these dreams, a slightly crooked smile, her eyes lit up with what could be love…and something John cannot identify. Vague impressions of a whirling kaleidoscope of colors spiral around him, when he looks down, he’s wearing a tuxedo and Sherlock is standing in front of him, wearing nothing except that complex expression he gets when he really wants to say something to John, especially something
John can’t hear much with his head half-submerged, but the unmistakable rumble must be Sherlock’s answer; he’s right beside them, on the off chance Sophie might wobble.
They move towards each other at the same time, their mouths meeting in a tangle of tongues and lips, their kiss growing more passionate and less tentative. Sherlock deftly unzips John’s fly and tugs his jeans down enough to pull most of his cock from his pants. With the thrill of discovery, Sherlock carefully wraps his hand around it and ever so slowly tugs.
It is fairly obvious to both Sherlock and John that neither of the other men are seeing anything but each other. Sherlock squeezes Martin’s shoulder once more and follows John out of the room. They are silent until the lift doors close with a thud.
“And Sherlock is, well, himself. He and John have a daughter named Sophie.”
When he finally gets it open, he exhales and hands over the ropy thing to Captain simply because the man happens to be the closest non-John in the room. He takes it with a frown. The tiny square of white paper that Sherlock is carefully unfolding now is much more interesting. He gets it open completely and it’s really no larger than a bean seed but there seems to be some writing on it. He huffs and hands it to John who reads it and shrugs.
. He gives the couple a wry smile then sets the coffee down in front of House and flicks the sitting man’s ear with two fingers.
Eventually someone hands out silly hats and separates the pile of children, half of which are asleep, from the sitting room floor. They all gather around and Greg turns on the sound system. They count down to midnight and everyone who knows the words sings Auld Lange Syne. Tobais and Alfred mumble the lyrics because they are clueless, though probably making up whatever because they are carrying on like loons; John, Greg and Sherrinford bring up the rear by singing the original Scottish words. Sherlock flashes a smile at John from overtop Sophie’s head where she’s passed out on his shoulder and John makes a big show of standing on tiptoe to kiss him when the clock on the old year runs out.
Faking inattention like a Jedi Master, John casually licks an index finger and slowly turns the page.
Later, John will admit to being lost in the sensation of Sherlock’s talented fingers but for now he knows he wants them to come together, so he hoarsely bites out, “No, together.”
“Please, John,” Sherlock whispers.
Perhaps unconsciously, John steps even closer and gets right back into Sherlock’s bubble, returns his face to its former position, huffs his breath over Sherlock’s mouth and says earnestly, “I can’t go back to what we had before.”
John pushes himself up off the floor from where he’s been stoking the fire, wiping his palms against his jeans.
“Well, that took long enough!” Mrs. Hudson exclaims as she bustles into the kitchen, wiping her hands on the pink, flowery apron she’s wearing. She looks over at the puffs then down at me and frowns. In an instant, she’s pulling out the other chair and lifting both my feet and carefully setting them down on the seat; she glares at my boots but doesn’t say anything. I know they aren’t the most stylish things out there, but they fit me well and the soles are tough enough to withstand the strain of being out in the street.
John doesn’t flinch, in fact, doesn’t move a muscle when House tells him flat out, “Monk is no friend of mine.”
Sherlock Sends, his Mindvoice achingly filled with wonder and fear of loss simultaneously.
Just a heads up that the rating for this story will be changing ;D Thanks!
“I can’t take you anywhere,” he complains as they head back towards the flat.
There’s a tap on his shoulder. House stands in front of him, back to his normal rumpled self.
“The what?” John finally has the presence of mind to ask.
Martha stays with them a few more minutes, finally gets around to asking John if he needs anything and fights back tears when he says that he just wants to go home. She leans over to hug him, stands and hugs Sherlock by bending over the back of the other chair then takes her leave.
Sherlock finally stops stroking but does not remove his hand. He turns his face to John’s and John pulls back enough to look him in the eyes. Very gently he runs his palm over the back of Sherlock’s head, barely touching his hair, yet it is enough that Sherlock exhales loudly and shudders against the almost-not-there sensation.
John watches them leave feeling like he’s missed something big somewhere, only he’s so far lost that he’s never going to figure it out. He shakes his head again, turns off the EVP device that’s been going apeshit in his pocket for the past ten minutes, then leaves the house. He has to stop at LOPNI headquarters and give his report before he can head home, but his mind is so full of intensely glinting green eyes that he doubts he’ll be able to concentrate enough to give a coherent rundown of the little meeting in which he just found himself taking part.
His brother’s svelte Mindvoice interrupts Sherlock more surely than if someone would have shouted and he rocks backwards on the coffee table, almost falling off of it. He scrambles for a hand hold and opens his eyes, blinking in shock at his brother.
“Yeah, I don’t think it’s just me thinking he’s being more of an ass than usual,” Wilson states as he pulls his stethoscope out of his shirt in order to check Ambrose’s vitals. Just as he lays the warm end against Ambrose’s chest, the patient sputters and returns to consciousness in the all-of-a-sudden-way typical of daytime soap operas and poorly written crack fanfic such as this one.
John is quiet, deciding what will be the best course of action. He could feign exhaustion, which would be true, but, the reality is that they are never going to be able to move forward into whatever their next step should be if he continues not
It takes John a full minute to count how many arms he can see…and even longer to realize that two of them belong to Sally Donovan…who doesn’t appear to be angry at House anymore. In fact, the way her left leg is wrapped around House’s waist, angry is certainly not the word for it.
John stops short, stuffing his hands into his pockets and shaking his head. His head!
“You aren’t smoking right now,” John states firmly.
Mrs. Hudson reaches over and squeezes Martin’s shoulder. “That’s just Mycroft’s way, Martin, dear. Think nothing of it other than he cares and wants to see you.” She smiles.

let anyone beyond it again.
“You…when did you?” His eyes go from John’s slick hole to his face and back again.

the door swings open and this time Sherlock’s brought the blond man from the crash site with him. Martin may not be the luckiest man in the world, but he is a Holmes and he isn’t stupid; even so with the concussion, it takes him a full twenty seconds to figure it out.
“If you don’t let me up, I’ll just pee on you,” John does his level best to sound serious.
“There’s two of them, probably a brother. Most likely a twin,” Sherlock announces apropos of nothing as Sherrinford pulls a dainty tool from the pocket of his jeans.
“Yes, I have nowhere else to be.” Martin answers, offering up a weak smile as the truth of the statement dawns on him.
and pou’d the gowans fine;
“You!” John and Sherlock accuse at the same time.
John knows that look, now, however, and understands that beyond the slight flicker of fear in his lover’s eyes that Sherlock is working out what is happening, his mind as fast as ever despite the circumstances. For his part, John feels physically frozen, limbs and mind so heavy as to be almost numb.
“Whatever it is, and I can clearly see it is
“Oh my god, I’m so glad you are sitting there right now. Don’t need Hudders getting an eyeful…” John snorts, attempting to control his laughter but it wins out and he giggles.

“Sherlock, step back, give him some space,” Lestrade says in his soft Papa Greg voice. (The one that makes
John can already see the boredom hamster beginning its trek around the wheels in Sherlock’s mind. Well, so far, Grant hasn’t really given them anything useful and Sherlock hates domestics.
John starts at the abrupt change Mycroft’s manner—from clipped and formal to awfully…would it be a stretch to call it ‘familiarly warm?’ He understands completely both the warning and the blessing made crystal clear and for the first time, John is permitted to see Mycroft as the protective older brother who is positively exhausted. Still hesitant at the quick turnaround, John merely nods, equally feeling the weight of the day…or possibly a halfway dozing consulting detective who is still only wearing a shirt, he isn’t sure anymore.
Sensing no danger, however, John turns on his heel to be greeted by Sherlock, in the buff, perched in his chair, long legs crossed modestly and an honestly surprised look on his face.
“I don't care!” Sherlock yells at the top of his lungs, pointing at Mycroft with a trembling finger that he doesn’t bother to hide.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow in his sister’s direction but does not turn his head or otherwise acknowledge the ridiculousness that is spilling from her mouth. After a few more minutes of this, he sighs. “What are you on about?”
As they climb into the back of yet another SUV, Sherlock has one more thing to say. “How do any crimes ever get solved here?”
After a moment spent taking stock of himself, he turns to where Ophelia has gone quiet, one hand over her mouth. She’s levitating slightly, about a foot off the ground, her entire body trembling. Her eyes, so much like her brother’s, are moving back and forth at a rate that would astonish anyone not already familiar with the pair of them, a fact made more astonishing that she seems so much more solid to John right now than she ever has before. John can even make out tiny variations in her hair color, see a mother-of-pearl pink tint to her fingernails that he’s somehow never noticed.
Surprisingly, that had been the last time he was near a large body of water that wasn’t the Thames or the Atlantic. He’s never been much of a swimmer, but he is confident when he’s in the water; ‘course he wasn’t much of an equestrian, either, until he’d moved up to what he calls in his mind as the Holmes-Watson manor.
John pretends to sleep.
A heavy stillness blankets the room. Mycroft can’t contain his disappointment in his brother’s silence; the lack of loyalty to the one person other than Mycroft himself who could be in Sherlock’s orbit without being torn to pieces—and even volunteer to be, at that. Awkwardly, keeping his eyes locked on Sherlock’s, Mycroft raises his Shields and pulls his pager from his pocket, making a rather dramatic show of being needed by his employer.
John has made a valiant attempt, in his mind anyway, to think around these strange ideas, though so far, all he’s done is send a text message to the psychic. The delay in the answer is probably the only answer he’s going to get, so he really ought to get up and find something worthwhile to do. He has to face the facts sometime and realize that someone showing up at your job a few times might just be a coincidence, after all, they move in the same circles. Just coincidence. Doesn’t mean anything. Certainly doesn’t mean Sherlock is into John…
“I wonder when they died?” he asks the presumably empty house, voice echoing slightly as it bounces off the bare walls. Instantly, as if conjured up by some unknown magic, Ophelia Holmes appears beside him, causing the EVP reader in his hand to vibrate like a hot tea kettle. John has to grab the EMF meter before it falls down to the floor below.
“Get over here.”
I have to give him credit, there’s only the slightest hint of a tremor under his voice. I appreciate that, even though he didn’t know Bryan well. Bryan was one of the few of us who didn’t actively work for the detectives, though he didn’t give any of us any grief about it, either. He said that he’d taken enough orders for the rest of his life, no matter how long that was going to be, he was going to live it as free as he possibly could. Which, really, what kind of twenty-three year old reasoning do I have to put on his fifty-five year old reasons?
Sherlock sighs and Martin can positively
It seems to be what Christopher is waiting for, an answer to a long-ago asked question. He nods sharply and when he turns to them, his eyes are shining with unshed tears. “She’s going to be alright,” he whispers, his eyes finding John’s.
” John retorts, “you’re not my type, and besides, Mycroft would probably have me taken out back and shot.”
Sherrinford has a good three inches on Sherlock’s height, and he’s even slumped down a little against the plane. To John, he looks like an older version of Mycroft with hair a few shades darker red, flecked with white streaks. He’s also got a lot more of it and it lays against his skull in soft waves, nothing like Martin’s or Sherlock’s curls. On his face is a white-and-red goatee, trimmed neatly. When he looks up, John sees that his eyes are a pale, frosty blue. Sherrinford waves at John with his left hand, and John clearly sees diamonds on the gold band around his third finger when they catch the bright working lights.
John regards me with empathy washing over his features; Sherlock watches me coolly, the only tell of sympathy his pursed lips; Mrs. Hudson, well, I can’t see her, but the iron grip around me has grown tighter.
He hauls her up out of the seat to give her hug but finds very quickly that she’s been confiscated by Greg, who is looking much less rumpled than he had a little while ago.
“Seriously, that was quite entertaining, John. You should do it again sometime.” Sherlock continues.
This chapter has been rewritten twice. I can't take it anymore, so here it is in its imperfect state.
“John, I am fine,” Sherlock grits out between clenched teeth. He is sitting sidewise on the the sofa, right leg tucked beneath himself and back to the armrest, shoulders rounded and head down, all the curls on his scalp falling over his face in the same direction as if they lack the will to fall the other way. There’s a pretty good reason for the wet-and-then-dried-in-a-hurricane-poodle look, however, and that reason is one particularly concerned ex-Army doctor. He sighs, perhaps adding a bit of a dramatic flair by pushing his head up into John’s hands a little, then decides that he’s not going to be able to fight John reassuring himself.
"The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend."
“I’m sorry,” Douglas offers, taken a little off guard.
“Sherlock, Mycroft will be here in a moment.” Ophelia warns her brother from her favorite perch atop the back of the sofa. All she receives in reply to her effort, however, is a pointedly unsatisfying grunt.
In the sky over his head, a ginger man in a tight black suit is waving to the crowd from the bottom wing of a bright red bi-plane whose make John doesn’t recognize. He marvels at the man’s nimbleness as he climbs up to the top wing.
“…and what did you see?” Sherlock is asking, body angled away from the doorway. He’s crouched down, running a hand beneath the bed. Early morning sunlight weaves its way from the bare window to gracefully highlight the amber tones deep in Sherlock’s raven curls. John blinks in an effort to hide the image from his own mind.
“Sherlock, what have you done?” Greg’s eyes widen in wonder as he swings his feet down off the top of his desk, the scone he was about to take a bite out of forgotten. Sherlock saunters into the DI’s office looking less put together than Greg has seen him, well, since his darkest days. Greg thrusts his cup of coffee into Sherlock’s hands as he closes the door. “Drink that, you need it.”
John keeps a calming hand on his partner as he pushes him away from the scene. Sherlock sags his shoulders slightly; it’s enough of a break in his usual armor that John knows he’s doing the right thing. He lets his grip loosen a little but Sherlock continues forward, his steps growing heavier by the second.
John is crashes over the detective and his jaw drops in awe.
(Yeah, boo! Hiss! I’m sorry, it was just
Sherlock actually takes a step back this time. John checks the expression on his face and is quite surprised to see the questions all but written there. He tilts his head but Sherlock’s already looking inward and doesn’t see it. After a few moments of being uncomfortably watched by Jolly Not-Green, Sherlock’s eyes snap open wide.
“I’ll leave the kettle, when you two are finished, just leave it there. After you go and talk to Grant and Victor, come on back and I’ll set you up for the night.”
An almost-familiar voice drawls from behind the mask in a half-bored, half-amused manner, “I’d ask what you’re doin’ here, but I think I’ve got a pretty good idea.”
“I know we’ve not actually talked about it, and I will not ask. Not you.” He pauses, dramatically taking control of the situation again. “I’ve done my best not to read it on you, but sometimes things are too obvious for me to miss. Somewhere deep down, you believed you couldn’t see the corporeal spiritual manifestations on this plane—yet you’ve been able to see and to sense Ophelia from the first time you were near her…so much so that you have unknowingly called her to your side.”
“Yes, Mummy, my apologies, but I’ve got to run. I wish I could
John Asks, always the gentleman.
“No, he could have been…”
“She’s right.”
(Cue the ‘dun dun dun’ music.)
When he succeeds in coaxing a deep, burry purr from Sherlock’s chest, he decides that enough is enough. With a bit of pressure, he quickly has Sherlock on his back, John balanced over him on both hands. He goes ahead and takes a taste of the skin on Sherlock’s neck, gradually working from little kitten licks to nibbles.
“Oh,” he says quietly as the puzzle pieces fall together.
“Oh god,” Douglas nods.
“Thanks, mate,” Murphy grinds out, his eyes watching John’s every movement.
John frowns and scoots backwards off of Sherlock in order to stand up. “Really?”
This time, Sherlock finds the laughter infectious and a small, shy grin cracks through his rigid facade. “I’m Sherlock,” he offers in a quiet voice.
Sherlock decides to trust his intuition and raises his legs, circling John’s waist with them and hooking his ankles together to firmly align their clothed cocks together. It is almost too much, almost painful and certainly not enough.
“We want to thank you for helping him.” Daphne addresses both of them with a turn of her head. Sherlock accepts her gratitude quietly, his eyes on the bed where Anya is moving a little.
They look at each other. Sherlock steeples his fingers and leans forward. John shrugs,
“I thought all the Vampires would be out hunting at this late hour,” Sherlock snipes as he does his best to appear composed.
The first job I did for Sherlock, he’d not even introduced himself, only produced a photo out of thin air after stepping right up to me in the park one day. I can recall it was Spring, but not much else. I saw the guy in the photo, did my best to remember everything about him and when Sherlock reappeared, he had this shorter, yellow-haired man with him. I told him everything I could and he palmed me a twenty pound note. The rest, as they say, is history. Or
Martin opens his eyes and the world tilts on its axis and that is just
Victor lets go of Sherlock’s shoulder immediately and moves back several feet. Sherlock finds himself regretting his words the instant they shoot past his tongue. For some reason he doesn’t like the disappointed look on Victor’s face. He scoots a little closer and copies Victor’s movement earlier by resting his hand on the other boy’s shoulder. There’s a visible change in Victor’s expression, something that Sherlock would almost describe as
“Oh, John, it’s already better than in my head,” Sherlock tells him honestly, voice dark and syrupy with lust.
“Yes, see what you’ve done to me, John? You’ve turned my brain into mu…phrumph…”
“Obviously,” John grins.
Well, that's all folks! I apologize for taking so long to finish this bad boy, just had to have the right motivation and the belief that there is Love that can outlive *anything* thrown its way! Thank you so much to all my readers, you are all simply amazing!
Sherlock asked me two questions that day; he asked me if I’d been taking care of myself and then he said, “Where did it happen?”
John is fairly certain he just felt one of Sherlock’s epiphanies. No wonder he always looks like he just had an orgasm.
The door clicks shut, leaving Sherlock and John alone to face each other through a leaden silence.
When the Days Are Cold
“John, she’s alright.” Sherlock strides through the door, his eyes effortlessly sweeping over the gaggle of machines that surround the girl lying amongst the tubes and pillows there.
“You’ve hardly changed at all, Cinnabar.” Sherrinford allows.
Sherlock leans over the plane and pokes about with his index finger until John can’t take it any longer.
“Daddy! Dad, Dad, Dad! Did you see the air-oh-planes? Oh my gosh! Uncle Mikey brought me this weird fried dough thing called a fumble cake and
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock?” is all he can get out because as they move forward, several more members of what John is sure must be a bomb squad rush in past them.
Sherlock looks down at the counter top. “I haven’t done it since you showed up at the crime scene.”
thought out of his head and moves closer to Sherlock who frowns at him in a knowing way but continues with his line of thought, “John, will you please explain to these ingrates that if I cannot
“I’m sorry Molly, I had no idea Sherlock was here or I would have taken John up to mine.”
Sherrinford stills then throws his head back and laughs heartily.
Desire. There’s certainly no shortage of it here if what is poking against John’s thigh is any indication.
With great control he takes a deep breath. In the mind palace, he firmly closes a door but does not lock it. In his subconscious, he’ll wear the antique brass key on a chain around his neck, yet, in the waking world, the key will be in the new melody they are slowly composing
“I’m already dead.” John’s voice is hollow, bereft of any of his normal warmth. The gun thuds to the floor with a sound too similar to the one from hours ago…the one he was never meant to hear.
“Doctor Watson?” the man asks with a frown as if unsure that John’s identity hasn’t changed in the past ten minutes since DI Lestrade told him who the injured man was and threatened him with pain of death if he were to let anything else happen to the doctor.
Sherlock slowly unfolds himself, still keeping his full attention on John’s face. He stands and takes three steps to the side of the bed.
“Well, I’m sure Sherrinford wouldn’t ask you unless he felt you’re up to it.” John answers, feeling rather paternal at the moment.
“It’s not the same, John.”
Meanwhile, Lestrade is being introduced and offered coffee. He is soon slumped in one of the other chairs, legs stretched out in front of him and looking every bit the exhausted copper.
John rolls over and peers at the clock on the bedside table through bleary eyes: 9:00 AM. He reaches out with his right hand and feels the still-warm space next to him where Sherlock had been a little while ago. A pleasant memory of an evening spent reminiscing and hearing stories of his partner’s younger years springs to his mind. He grunts sleepily and considers turning back over and catching a bit more shut-eye.
Sherlock nods once. “Mister and Misses Norton never had any children.”
He looks up in time to see a helicopter team, thinking that it is fascinating to see someone fly one of those things upside down. He sneaks a glance out of the corner of his eye at Mycroft who is gazing ahead as if trying to pretend that he’s interested in the show.
John suddenly remembers Irene’s house and a certain bulging American gunman ‘falling’ from the window in Baker Street
Sherlock’s answer is brief, the last constant drawn out into a hissing ‘s’ that ends as he swiftly changes, remaining on the sofa with his tail wrapped around his paws.
Sherlock forgets their names as soon as he hears them.
“May I?” she asks politely, echoing what she said to Greg a few minutes ago.
Staring down into the dregs of a miserable cup of coffee, Douglas is fairly certain he is going to have a heart attack. He is terrified for Martin and feeling just a little bit sorry for himself as well. It is just so unfair to finally find someone like Martin to have it messed up by this horrible escapade. Douglas steadies himself as he looks to the other men in the room, thinking it is selfish to worry about himself when two of them have lost their
Sherlock tilts his head in the man’s direction but doesn’t say anything. A curl falls down over his forehead as he scrunches his nose up and studies the floor.
“You really did fall,” John whispers into the freezing air of the flat before gripping the sides of Sherlock’s face and bringing their lips together, passion on the edge of pain, a hint of anger in clashing teeth, need in the way their bodies meld with one another’s.
Martin is quiet for a moment. “No, not really. Mycroft is some sort of diplomat, he’s married to a DI of Scotland Yard, which I just found out, by the way.”
“My name is Ophelia Holmes,” she informs him with a smile, “And I am here to help you.”
“I meant what I said,” Sherlock answers calmly as if his heart isn’t doing its damnedest to beat right out of his chest at John’s pronouncement. It is going to hurt to give up everything, yet he gains so much more than he stands to lose if things continue the way they have been. At least Moriarty is gone and will never be back to trouble them again.
He slowly rubs his cheek, gingerly exploring what will be a nasty bruise come sun up as he makes an attempt to Speak to John over their Link again; he can Feel the Link, but the comfortable hum normally present is a chaotic mish-mash of noise not unlike the ruckus of instruments being bashed against an amplifier again and again. The pain-filled din forces him to raise his hands to ineffectually cover his ears; he cannot even imagine what it sounds like inside John’s head right now. This is terrible, something he never wanted to bear witness to when he attempted…whatever it was he’d tried to do earlier that Mycroft interrupted. Not this: not this horrible, shrieking pain, the echo of John’s grief, the ghostly remnants of a Bond torn asunder.
At least when the men come to this room it is a little while that I am not all by myself.
“Why such a low amount?” House asks quietly.
(Yes, oozes. Watch our Sherlock pour himself on and off furniture…it’s highly entertaining. Makes you wonder if Ben does that at home in RL…now
John doesn’t answer, but whether he simply lacks the willpower or is too far gone remains to be seen. Sherlock shifts slightly until John’s cock, the tip dotted with precome, pushes against Sherlock’s flat belly with each thrust of his fingers.
The three of them wave at the others and head back across the grounds towards the hotel.
Sherlock finally takes a breath. Grant is gaping at him with his mouth hanging open like a fish.
“Thank you, Gregory.” Mrs. Hudson pushes through carefully, pausing a moment to take in the scene in front of her.
“So, to sum up this episode of Aliens Were Here First, let’s turn to Doctor Michael Stamford now. Doctor Stamford, can you give us a quick review for our audience so that no one’s confused at this point?”
“She likes you,” I mumble, sitting up. Nova wiggles down off my lap and makes a beeline for John. He smiles and picks her up. She squirms and wriggles and tries hard to lick the skin right off his face. I’m smiling for the first time in a while and I have to admit that’s one of the cutest things I’ve ever seen.
Once again, Ophelia is at the kitchen table with the three ghosts whose acquaintance John made last night. James and Janey offer him polite nods while Mary Beth gives him a smile and a funny gesture with her hands that he takes to be a wave.
Barkley merely snorts and makes snide comments under his breath with every word that comes out of Sherlock’s mouth. The officer stares coldly at Sherlock with every deduction he throws out about the woman. Just past her thirtieth birthday, two kids, a dog, a parrot, husband. She seems so normal, at least in John’s eyes.
Sherlock opens his eyes very, very slowly and takes in his very best friend. In the dim light from the window, his irises are almost feline. Even more slowly, he drops his left hand down to the floor; long, thin fingers run under the edge of the couch in order to bring forth a small, leather-bound notebook. “You can say
“Sherlock,” Ophelia calls out from where she’s quickly gaining on him. Her hair has gone wispy, long tendrils framing her face and sticking out from the rubber band holding her ponytail. She steps through the door as he starts to close it.
In that instant, John Watson believes he has gone insane. His heels dig for purchase against the bedclothes and he thrashes, finally succeeds in yanking the oxygen mask off his face.
“Go on, get your clothes. I know they aren’t far.” Sherlock prissily commands, managing to both look down his nose at the other man and wink at John at the same time.
and laughs like a loon.
The second report of paper outlines Roger’s sister, a thirty-seven year old female named Maya. Maya was also a Were, her shift was a Capybara, another large rodent found in the Caribbean and South America.
“There’s another one, John.”
John’s hand touches Sherlock’s where he’s holding open the odd little door. “Oh god,” he says.
Mycroft promptly turns as red as Martin.
“He’s fine, Jim, just rebooting.” John offers.
He knows better, though. It’s not like that had any type of long standing commitment. Just because someone happens to show up on every one of your cases for a few weeks doesn’t mean you’re dating or anything. Twelve weeks, to be exact. John quells his urges, however, reminding himself that he has no claim on this man’s time. He tells himself that interrupting someone’s work is childish and rude, and that’s all there is to it.
“Sherlock.” John closes his eyes against another onslaught of emotion at the very idea that he can let his thoughts be so freely
“Well, we got a call two days ago from the British Government,” John frowns when Sherlock does a loud, dramatic stage-snort. (Louder than a stage-whisper if you must know.) “Anyway, apparently this is a missing-person case, but I’m a little stymied as to why we needed to come all the way here to solve it. Sherlock often does these flat on his back on the couch at home.”
John laughs out loud then shrugs when Mycroft glares at him. John can read the admonishment in his expression. He shouldn’t enjoy it, but it’s so much fun when they all turn into teenagers for a little while.
Sherlock shrugs. John rolls his eyes, Greg doesn’t look too disgusted and where the hell did I put Mycroft? (Scrolls back up the word doc…) Mycroft is standing behind Lestrade now with one of those beautiful hands on Lestrade’s powerful shoulder.
“They didn’t exactly ask if I wanted the case.” Sherlock states.
. Try and take it easy on him.” John says.
As if. “Does it really matter?” Sherlock asks, pitching his voice low.
? (The way Mycroft holds onto his brolly or his copper…)
– Joyce Brothers
Sherlock doesn’t move from his position, though, merely bends his knee and places one foot flat against the brickwork. “It’s her,” he mutters.
In between long strides that eat up the pavement, Sherlock takes a deep breath, “I miss cigarettes.”
John’s fingers dig into his back, from either passion or pain, Sherlock is unsure. For a single heartbeat, Sherlock stops, mind and body waiting on John to say…what, he doesn’t know, but he is patient, even with the pulsing of their Link in his mind, shooting out dark green tendrils so thin as to be transparent, a temporal illusion proving the reality of what is happening.
“Alright, I’m going to be wrong, but what the hell,” John drops his eyes to the table and fiddles with the corner of his menu. “The footprints on the floor in that big empty room—none of them matched the shoes Grant was wearing yesterday.”
“Are you sure?” John asks Victor, ignoring Sherlock’s pleading expression.
John tears at the ruined t-shirt and manages to locate where the bullet struck Murphy. The doctor is lucky, because it looks as if the projectile managed to avoid his heart and lungs. John sits up to inform him of the fact when there’s a burning sensation in his shoulder and he’s thrown forward over Murphy. The last thing he remembers is the sound of reinforcements joining in the fire fight. Seconds before he goes completely unconscious, he manages to open up his Shield enough so that Toby can hear him.
As House sweeps past our favorite British
John, who has just returned to the room from the kitchen, has both hands wrapped around a tea tray on which he’s balanced their tea kettle, three cups, sugar, cream and a small plate of biscuits. He sighs as he places the tray on the coffee table, then Sends Sherlock a little bit of affection in an attempt to calm his nerves, which he’s sure are stretched about as thin as they generally may be expected to go before he snaps and begins deducing things about her she’s probably not prepared to share.
“Damn,” John hums, “Alright, we are not in the middle of a case.”
“I’m sorry,” he offers.
“What do you think, Arley?” Barkley asks his twin in a casual voice.
Barkley is down at the opposite end of the hangar now, pacing back and forth. Martin can’t make out every word, but he’s hearing enough to put the man behind bars for a long time. He has no clue who Higgins is and he wonders which one of his brothers is responsible for crushing Barkley’s plans. His best bet for now, however, seems to be to stay quiet and hope that someone has noticed his absence.
“John, I’m not trying to pry, mate, but you look a bit ragged around the edges,” Mike offers, tugging at his long coat, causing the buttons over his belly to strain a little.
Wright.”
Instead of answering, Sherlock gracefully leaps from John’s arms as they enter their flat. He stops in the center of the sitting room before John can get the door closed and changes. John hopes his eyes don’t really bug out the way it feels like they do as the now-very-naked detective turns to look at John over his shoulder. He does a little hip wiggle and strides towards his bedroom, disappearing into the shadows behind.
I’ll wait.)
The girl’s words give him pause. He wipes his hand over his mouth and regards the two of them. “What?”
John decides that Ruthie certainly told the truth, because how often do you see someone with smooth cocoa-colored skin and blue eyes the color of a sunny winter’s day?
“Sherlock, there is no such place as West Carolina.” Mycroft raises his left eyebrow a fraction of an inch.
Sherlock stills for a few seconds then wraps his arms around John’s naked body, kneading John’s buttocks with his hands. John rolls his hips forward, curious, but Sherlock shakes his head against John’s neck. John understands instantly, because he knows he needs a little more rest before going again.
“And you’re from Fitton,” Martin adds, impressed. “Why is it we’ve never met before?”
From his stubbornly held spot on the floor not five feet from John’s side, Sherlock regards John’s sweaty countenance, his trembling body and the V-shaped vein standing up in the center of his forehead over severely furrowed brows. Deep creases have appeared at the sides of his mouth; his bottom lip is puffy where he’s just bitten into it.
You know, because they were in the morgue.
John growls some under his breath in relief or utter need, he’s not sure which, as he suddenly discovers that he’s being practically shoved up the stairs and then through their flat door, then he’s on his back and Sherlock’s kissing him within an inch of his life. And even though this is a really terrible idea, considering he’d been out cold less than five hours ago, the way that lithe body feels over him and around him and pushing him against the floor…none of that matters any more.
“Look,” John says in his best captain voice. “My partner cannot help you. No one in the world reads a crime scene the way he can, I can confirm that.” He lets his tone soften around the edges. “However, he cannot: A. work a crime scene that no longer exists, and B. read evidence that has been washed away.”
“No, no, not really a face, not as such. Just a pair of
in any way, shape or form because Mycroft suggested it.
“What’s your name, then?” John asks as his knees pop when he kneels down to be at her level.
As the ground approaches, Martin knows that his only recourse is to relax into the impact. He doesn’t wear a parachute, because at four or five hundred feet it’s pretty much useless: no time to deploy it. Right now, though, he figures he’s got about five seconds before impact. He holds the stick as steady as he can with trembling hands until the first bump of the plane against grass. At least with a bi-plane, its landing gear doesn’t retract, so the tires do soften the blow a little. Even so, he’s jerked forward and slams his head on the instrument panel hard enough to knock him out.
He doesn’t have to go too far, casting about in the psi-darkness of his own mind until suddenly, there’s a brightness, a color that’s different from Sherlock’s…he latches onto it and a new warmth, not as comfortable as his Link with the detective’s, floods his system. Trying hard to remember things taught and long forgotten and secretly wishing he’d had time to prepare for today’s random weirdness, John forces the light to move into a single beam, blocking it off from everything else. Now he can clearly make out the brightest light that is their Link, separate but alongside this new, temporary one.
I was on my way to the park that morning when this black guy stopped me and handed me two quid. I couldn’t believe my eyes but I remember thanking him then remembering the scar on his face. Of course, I know that’s Joseph now, but at the time I thought I’d just gotten lucky because here’s this guy handing me money and not asking anything in return.
A little shiver runs down Sherlock’s spine at the word ‘home.’ He fights himself not to simply Change right there and curl up in John’s lap in order to sleep off his now full belly. Sherlock shakes his head but doesn’t move.
“How do you know I was even in there?”
The way Sherlock Holmes sent him away! Just bloody well dismissed him! As if he were an outsider, someone who knows nothing about the ‘other’ worlds that exist alongside…
“Sherlock, get over here.” John gets up and Sherlock takes his place. Sherlock drops an arm over Martin’s shoulder and hauls him in close to his side. Martin decides he’ll take what he can get and buries his face into the collar of Sherlock’s shirt and sobs. Sherlock’s fingers tighten around Martin’s shoulder and Martin knows without being told that he’s remembering the same thing Martin is: the way they were never allowed to say goodbye.
I do not excuse him in the least for his own part in all of this, and I won’t say that with any quadrant of my heart that I condone his behavior, whether it be then or now. That is yet another conversation we will be having, though I strongly believe he’s done with it. I saw something in his eyes last night, something new that I had missed and the only way I can hope to put it into words is to describe it as the burning ember of the will to live.
“Yes,” the detective stops and answers.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So,” John begins after a moment where they all regard each other warily. “My name is John Watson.”
“Think about it. Really. Then you would haven’t to be stuck here all day all alone. Imagine if he stays this way for the rest of your Christmas holiday? Hmmm?” Jimmy croons, the soft Irish lilt of his voice making her brain feel like mush.
” Sherlock informs him before opening his mouth and swallowing him down, big hands sliding beneath and pushing his hips up towards that elegant tongue.
“Talk to Martin, John, he’s dying to tell you about his
Across London, Greg's phone chirps out an obnoxiously tween-age warning for an incoming text message. Sherlock somehow fiddled with the damned thing last week and as much as Greg hates it, he has to admit that it is actually louder than it was before, so he no longer has the excuse of not answering the consulting detective’s messages because he cannot hear his phone ring. He sits forward and pulls it out of his trouser pocket, reads the text, fires off an affirmative reply and stuffs it back away. Greg then goes back to the worn, dog-eared paperback novel in his hands, ignoring the majority of the passers-by from where he is perched in a hard plastic chair outside John Watson's hospital room.
But that’s not entirely true, is it? John asks himself. Since Sherlock came home, as he prefers to think about the time Sherlock was
It’s really the only warning he can give and he’s ready to give a whole lot more now that Sherlock’s teeth are worrying his earlobe and there’s a deep sound vibrating through Sherlock’s chest and John can’t even think about anything anymore because like those balloons in that song, there’s going to be some popping around here and he’s about ready to beg…
By the time they make it down another corridor, this one strangely bereft of any hospital staff (cue the mysterious music)(which is funny), John is visibly shaking in his boots (funny? Not so much.)
John detests all of it. He spins around, ready for
. The thought of her being frightened of him because of that fills him with more emotion than he can name, though rage is at the top of the list.
. He blows across the top of the coffee cup he’s just pulled the top off of and makes bitter beer face after one sip. Scowling at the horrid brew, he recaps it and starts to set it on the bedside table.
“Hey, John, you ready for this?” Greg states happily.
When the urge to cry finally subsides, Martin takes a look around the tiny room. He doesn’t have his mobile; the doctor had been nice enough to allow him to use his. There’s nothing in here to read and he has no way of knowing if Sherlock’s just going to disappear again. Martin sighs, frustrated. Since he’s not allowed to go to sleep for a while yet, he can at least pass the time reciting airplane parts in his head.
Several bottles of water and an air show program litter the little round table between John and Mrs. Hudson’s chairs. Sophie is chattering happily with her face turned towards the sky. John leans down and adjusts her hat and she frowns at him.
(Would you consider that a
Victor shakes his head. “I’d rather not, if it’s all the same to you.”
“Why would you say that, John?” Sherlock asks, ignoring Victor for the moment; thrilled that his partner has finally been able to join in on the game. He can’t wait to pull one over on Mycroft, though the doctor may still have to practice to be
After a calming exhale, John answers. “I’m not entirely sure. With Toby, I never noticed how strong our Link was until she called attention to it…with you, it’s different. I’m not myself, right now, Sherlock, I owe you an apology for that. As well as this,” he says, carefully caressing the injured side of Sherlock’s face.
With sugar!
Watson, but stows it quick when he realizes he’s actually surrounded by people who could very easily kick his ass if they really want to.
“John?”
Sherlock leans his head down as John’s hand rests on the back of his neck. Their lips touch softly and John quickly takes control of the kiss, ratcheting up the heat by tens of degrees.
House manages to keep his mouth shut and crosses the room to help Monk to his feet.
“I’ve been given to think that I should not…”
. It’s going to be a long cab ride home, that much is certain.
“Anytime, John!” he calls out, waving one hand in the air. The supple black leather of his gloves has a definite shine beneath the street lamps.
Being alone has never been a problem for Douglas, but for some reason he’s chosen today to realize just how
“Damned if we know,” House quips sharply.
That’s one thing about Sherlock, he doesn’t normally actively
is, maybe he’s a little different? Maybe on a more even keel, emotionally, than Sherlock? Mycroft belongs in his own category: big brother, father figure…and that’s for more than just Sherlock. John has seen the man change in surprising ways just since he’s known him.
“Right, then, this shows that she was alive after some of these breaks long enough for them to begin knitting back together.”
face.
Martha knows well the signs of penance and doesn’t feel it is her place to forgive him. Of course, if anyone could ever pull something like this off, it would certainly be Sherlock and he would certainly return in much the same dramatic fashion. This time, though, there were higher stakes than even he reckoned for.
Mycroft isn’t going to be very happy about this most recent development; maybe he will send Greg to bail them out instead, since he was already making cryptic remarks about working on holiday; however much he didn’t complain about Sherlock’s cases the way he used to in the time before.
The deep green gaze alights on him and in that instant, John knows there’s more happening here than Sherlock is letting show. When he sees the realization dawn on John’s face, he smirks.
expression so John just goes right ahead and braces for getting run over by at least three hundred pounds of angry, bulgy giant. He never stops to wonder why it is that his life never passes by his eyes in moments like these.
Sherlock says nothing, else, however; the tightness in his jaw as he glances about again gives John the impression that he’s tightly reining himself in. With a curt nod, he stalks towards the back of the place.
Admittedly, John finds himself looking forward to seeing Sherlock more than actually doing his job, if he’s completely honest. He crosses his legs at the ankles where they’re hanging over the arm of the sofa and drops the hateful little meter onto his chest. He’ll close his eyes for five minutes and then he’ll check in with LOPNI HQ and report that total lack of anything happening. Again.
He taps his fingernails on his desk before he lifts his right index finger to his lips and begins worrying the cuticle with his teeth. It is a terrible habit, a holdover from childhood he was sure he’d left behind. With a single, swift yank of his teeth he’s got the tender skin bleeding.
“Enough, guys. Let the rest of us in on it.” Greg remarks.
Is it enough that I can admit it to myself if not yet aloud?
“There wasn’t any other way.” Sherlock states out loud.
He’s always been an incorrigible flirt and hopes he hasn’t laid it on too thick. Douglas worries a little as he makes his way back out to the show grounds to find his boss.
“Wait a minute,” John says aloud, “Whatever it is, I gave you my worst, right? So let’s be on an even keel here, alright? I’m not here to judge you, Sherlock, whatever happened.”
“John.”
“What are
Sherlock watches John closely, taking in every single detail of his new friend’s face, from the way a single wheaten eyebrow hair bends the opposite direction of the others to the beginnings of the laugh lines at the corner of his cerulean eyes. Still unsure of revealing
as soon as you feel like you can’t take any more, they do something horribly selfless that turns your life upside down; John will never say there was so much that didn’t hurt, but for the strength of their bond now, he would never change a single minute of his life. Because being alive with pain beats the alternative and all of the milestones in their lives he would have missed. Each one of those past pains has been soothed by the balm of an unusual—and mostly hidden—deep well of passion: both Sherlock’s and his own.
Martin, completely dumfounded, hugs the little girl back. His life has changed so much today that he is overwhelmed. Sophie pulls back and touches his cheek, then brings her wet finger up to get a better look at it.
This time there’s no stopping the tears. John’s mouth trembles when he makes the attempt and something in the region of Sherlock’s chest breaks. He surges upward, wrapping John in his arms and doing what he should have been able to do last night. John weeps quietly until he raises his head and pushing Sherlock away gently. He wipes at his face.

…But he’s not about to admit it.
John takes into account what Sherlock
There’s another voice intertwined with that of the screaming one belonging to the old house around him as with a bang like gunfire the rafters crack and split…that strange voice calling out, then there are gloved hands and a man in fire suit pulling him out but he’s screaming that she’s still in the house…she’s still in the house! What doesn’t anyone understand? He tries screaming in English, then French then Welsh and still no one is listening.
So, without further ado, I give you:
“Daddy!” Sophie calls out as she barrels into John’s legs. He grabs her in time to stop her from rolling down the stairs just as Greg grabs his arm to steady the both of them.
like Mycroft, which has the effect of making his husband snort and giggle like a naughty schoolboy.
but completely disregards Arrows and Bullets altogether, so as it is technically a Sophie story, it's not really about her, so I'm not adding it as part of that series. This story is quite simply about love and families. It is not necessary to have read Green Stars and Black Ice, but it may help you understand a little detail here and there about how Sophie came to be and the way Sherlock came home.
John is content and Sherlock is so much more himself now since things have begun settling into a routine; having a place to call home that is more than temporary is an amazing thing for John, and he knows Sherlock feels the same. Naturally, even Sherlock had to adjust once he came back from being
John feels like he’s just closed his eyes when his chest is hit by something light and busy. He slowly opens one of them and instantly wants to close it again because it feels like it’s full of sand. Of course, spending half the night discovering new Holmes and then being booked into a holding cell will certainly cause one to miss some sleep, without a doubt.
John enters the cantina through the side door, leaving Alan Murphy to finish one last fag by himself, since John keeps trying to quit. It’s been a busy day, plenty of injuries but thankfully not many casualties; as far as this place goes, then, that counts as a plus. Johns come straight from the medical tent, so he’s still in his tan scrub bottoms, but he’s pulled off his shirt so that he can mingle without looking too out of place.
The Owl spreads his wings wide and makes to launch himself skyward. Sherlock makes an odd noise that to a human would sound much like a cross between an annoyed hiss and a kittenish mew; he doesn’t use it often, and as such, it is a real reaction, not one of his cleverly crafted fake ones.
“It’s only been three days, Carolyn.”
Sherlock’s fingers tighten, his heart pounds and he knows his breathing has just sped up at the gentleness of John’s touch. Somewhere in the unorganized library of the mind palace, he adds a new definition of the word
“Here, let me get this around you,” John states mildly, pulling the comforter up around Sherlock’s shoulders. He is trembling now so John scoots around until he can rest against the headboard and hold Sherlock against his chest. For a while they are both quiet and John closes his eyes, but not before noticing that the digital clock on the night table reads 7:05 AM.
Sophie squeals, “Uncle Mycroft! I thought you and Uncle Greg got lost!”
Without looking to John, Sherlock asks her, “Possibly we need about five minutes.”
John doesn’t see any of these things, however, because he cannot seem stop himself from staring at the commanding figure in the doorway. A hush falls around them until Ophelia breaks it.
In a single graceful movement, the Cat leaps from John's lap to the floor and Shifts. Sherlock takes a seat on the sofa, never taking his eyes off John. John stares right back, Feeling the blank spot left in the story over their Link. He frowns.
“May I?” Martha asks, nodding towards the door and readjusting the bakery bag in her hand.
Sherlock shakes his head very slowly from side to side, clearly sensing everything John hasn’t said so far. “Go on,” he orders, standing and tightening the sash of his robe. He moves to the sofa, taking the seat closest to the arm. John moves to join him, thinks better of it and heads into the kitchen. Victor and Sherlock regard each other silently as they wait for John to return.
Mycroft digs around in his coat pocket until he finds a slightly folded up piece of paper. He holds it out towards Sherlock who takes it and spreads it out on the conference table.
Before I can answer her, I hear the voices of two men in the hallway. These two always stomp down the stairs as if they were firemen or elephants. Maybe firefighting elephants? I don’t know, but they make enough noise to raise the dead.

Before stepping through the door, however, Mycroft turns and offers a real smile to Sherlock. “Congratulations, kitten.”
“Well, I’d tell you to ‘get a room’ but I do believe you already have one.”
Curious, John shifts his weight on the desk. From this angle he can smell the food in the kitchen and he silently hopes it’s still warm when they get to it. Sherlock sees John’s eyes and knows his partner is hungry.
John chuckles into his tea as Sherlock regales him with the story of an abusive circus owner, a man billed as the ‘littlest strong man’ who dressed ‘primitively’ and did part of his act with a blow gun, plus a lovely six-toed lady. John is absolutely enthralled by the tale and wondering how much of it was just Sherlock bullshitting him when they are approached by a well-built, well-dressed man in a long camel-colored coat.
“Word?” John recrosses his arms over his chest and looks around the boxy cell before it comes to him, “Coincidence?”
“Well, you already know who I am, but this is my family.” He gestures towards the table and feels a sense of pride not unlike that of hearing the applause from the crowd after a successful show. Once again, there’s a round of pleasant murmurs and Douglas nods.
