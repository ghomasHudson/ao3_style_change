Mm, no. I don’t know what weird nonsense you cooked up with that soul bomb, but Jack here couldn’t use that energy if he tried.

Holding back?
THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY IS SLIM. IF YOU WISH TO LEAVE THIS PLACE, THEN GO INTO THE LIGHT.
A woman catching another woman’s eye across the hall--
Gee, thanks. He still in there with you?
Michael strolls gracefully down the steps and into the infirmary.
Sam and Dean exchange a desperate look-- Sam mouths ‘Jack’, and Dean grimaces. He’s not going to bring Jack into this unless he has no other choice. Before he can reply, however, Mammon drags him away.

Hey, I saw that!
Ugh. Don’t remind me.
We hear a familiar rustling that means an angel has just appeared.
Becky is typing at a desk table on her LAPTOP. We don’t see her face due to the positioning of the screen. On her desk are the Supernatural merch items and other set dressing from 15.04 ATOMIC MONSTERS.
CASTIEL
No. I’m still The Darkness, and you-- you’re still a stolen, second-hand energy cocktail. A
It is all I will need. With Dean as my vessel, I will be powerful enough to tear through and face the Empty myself. The Empty is weaker than it used to be.
END OF ACT FOUR
SAM (CONT’D)
Supernatural started as a story about two brothers.
I don’t think Jack likes using his grace unless he has to.
It sounds so simple when you say it like that. Where were you when I needed to hear it?
RUFUS
Man, I was worried I’d have to reheat your stuff. We really should get a microwave-- I mean, way the world is, we could basically just walk into a store and take one.
CASTIEL
We see The Empty looking confused at this tangent, and then-- Michael STABS his counterpart-lookalike through with the ARCHANGEL BLADE.
(darkly)
He leans over to plug in the charger.
ON JACK, GASPING. Castiel rushes once more to his side... the light fades from Jack’s eyes. He looks up at Rowena as his breathing slows.
Michael takes one look back at The Empty, stumbling towards him and shrieking in rage--
You wanna talk about it?

It never seemed to help his cooking.

Reality is beginning to break down.

MICHAEL
He lowers the rack using the lever, and the man drops closer to the fire--
A beat, as Castiel winces, and Amara raises her eyebrows at the impertinence of this human.
As it turns out, saving the world comes with a lot of complications.
Hence the need for modification. But it should be close enough-- we have the blood of a Nephilim, and we are trying to bring back the angel he considers a father.
But there isn’t a God, anymore. And hopefully, there never will be again.
MAMMON
Is everything okay?

CASTIEL
Yeah. That’s Dean.
Sam YANKS the gear stick into reverse and BACKS UP EILEEN’S CAR. Then he turns the wheel (and car) around, driving off-road.
DEAN (CONT’D)
How much power do you have? Enough to kill Chuck? Is that why he’s scared?
Jack needs to believe in himself, and his purpose. And containing the power is only half the issue-- controlling it is something else entirely.
(weakly)
A beat, and then Dean jerks violently away from the table.
The Winchesters give him a blank look.
Really? We going full ‘Fifth Element’?

I’m sorry I didn’t give you a better life. I could only offer you what little I had.

I don’t know, Jack. I don’t know why we escaped it, either. Maybe it’s something to do with you. But Dean-- Billie’s never liked Dean. Thinks he cheats death too often, or something.

Of course, it depends on Rowena’s spell work, too, and Jack. But I believe in their capabilities.

Bobby claps him on the shoulder, and nods in approval.
Dean stares at Chuck for a heartbeat-- and then in an instant, he’s turned away and is SPRINTING TOWARDS THE LAKE. But he doesn’t get far before--
Bobby glares over Dean’s shoulder in Jack’s general direction.
Bigger. Bluer. I wanted--
Castiel goes to reach to comfort Dean from behind... but then he falters and holds himself back. Uncertain of his place.

Behind Claire’s head, from her POV: Dean, looking across to Castiel, as he shakes hands with Bobby and Stevie and hugs Charlie tightly in farewell. Castiel looking back towards Dean as they leave, and Dean turning away before they can catch each other’s gaze.
Back on Dean, who lifts up the full pot from the sink and sets it on the stovetop. He grimaces as he does so, visibly in pain. He rolls his injured shoulder.
INT. EILEEN’S CAR – HIGHWAY – DAY
Sorry. I might need your help.
Dean blinks. Completely unnerved by that description.
Sam puts down his book on a side table.
(delighted)
Alex, please. Let’s try to have one night without an argument.
He pulls a phone out of his pocket, taps twice and then puts it to his ear. We hear the phone ring, as Dean--
Hi, Eileen.
Yes. I think he was interesting to my Father, at first. Even I was fascinated by him. What a curious thing he was, the one element moving so radically against what everyone planned for. What everyone wanted.
INT. CROWLEY’S LAB – NIGHT
Exactly. Alright, we’re going to start in the dungeons--
You’re an idiot.
TORTURE VICTIM
DEAN (CONT’D)
S’pose it could be worse. Right now, most people are still clinging to the hope of this being some sort of hoax, or at least some event that doesn’t affect them. If Jack hadn’t pushed back the calendar to when people disappeared, we’d have some real mass hysteria on our hands.

Just like foosball.
Jack, Rowena and Sam stare at the place where the portal was, and then at each other.
They stare at each other, and seem to come to some sort of an accord.
The Empty scoffs. Unconvinced.
Michael, Jack I need you with me as well. We’ve got to get this right, because we’re only going to have one shot at it.
He winces, remembering their previous argument. But Castiel doesn’t notice the negative association.
Open on Sam, rubbing his temple. Laptop open in front of him. Dean is pacing the room behind him. Castiel and Jack stand in a corner, looking a little out of place. Jody is leaning over the war table.
Never mind.
So he’s really dead this time?
Sam takes a second to relish the sight, and then blinks. Dean. He turns and runs out to the carpark.
INT. WAREHOUSE – NIGHT
More footage used from 8.22 CLIP SHOW.

Close on Jack, smiling as he says his farewells-- but also looking a little sad.
Cowgirl.
He hesitantly picks up a SHARP, LARGE KNIFE from the countertop, and stabs into it.
CAS! We’re running out of time! We have to go!
Stop reading my memories, man. It’s creepy.
I’m not sure he would appreciate me sharing that. I certainly don’t think he appreciated hearing it.
What makes you think I’ll accept your deal? I like my garden. I liked sleeping better, but there are some very pretty flowers here. Perhaps it wouldn’t be so bad to be awake... to cultivate my own Eden.
Yes. You’re much more like Cas.
stop Jack from using that power.
I appreciate your creation, brother. I just don’t appreciate you. You might have created this world, but you have no right to end it.
Stop! We’ll give you whatever you want!

Rowena starts SCREAMING-- Sam rushes to support her, as Castiel leans down before Jack.
FADE UP ON:
It’s fine, Cas. Look, I-- I should have given you more money to begin with. I wasn’t thinking.
Come on, Dean--!
Is a story real if we can feel it? Does a story have to be real in order to be true?
Sam makes a bitch face, and signs ‘He’s an idiot’. Unfortunately, Dean catches the movement.

He raises a fist and starts PUMMELING the Winchesters, who can’t fight back-- they go sprawling down, and he keeps hitting them when they try to get back up--
BLACKOUT.
Don’t.

He pauses, and closes his eyes. Searching for the right words.
Who possess fledgling souls, but souls nevertheless. What are demons, but souls tortured until they shrivel up and blacken? What are angels, but beams of light blessed, sometimes, with the spark of a personality? Compared to a human, those souls aren’t worth much. The true power is in the encasing grace and miasma. Well, unless you feed those souls love.

JACK (CONT’D)
So as I told Bon Jovi here on the phone, we got a ping this morning on that Azazel name. Couple of the boys were at the Rothschild Motel-- run-down joint, gets a lot of no-gooders-- and they heard a strange conversation between two of the guests. Something about demon blood and injections. We think it’s a new street drug. But the toxicology reports on the vics have come back clean, so...
CASTIEL
I-- yes. If that’s what it takes. And you?
Chuck shrugs.
Sam BURSTS IN THE DOOR, and sees Dean--
CLOSE ON OUR DEAN, who yells out in frustration as he punches THROUGH THE WALL and lets in a BEAM OF LIGHT--

Well, Castiel is sleeping with the fishes now.
Oh, let him help if he wants. Too many cooks in the kitchen makes for light work, right Jodes?

Here’s my question; if the kid can give those abominations a second chance, how come your Mom ain’t got a third go-around? He’s the one that killed her.
Please, Fergus would have only gone out swinging for your team because it meant he finally got one over on that wretch. The number of times we’ve whacked that venomous snake on the head, only to have him come slithering back...
Wait, so. These are the Winchesters?
Um, here. Let me help.

LUCIFER
So, is Jody’s lot making it back for the grand opening?
Dean remains awake. He picks up his WHISKEY TUMBLER and gets up from his armchair, shuffling out of the room.
He said it was only the ones who had enough for a soul, or something.
And the second woman ducking her head down and smiling bashfully.
He breaks off, smiling, and throws a duck some bread crumbs from his own portion.
Huh. You know, I never would have thought Cas would be the type.
WIDE SHOT of the same house. But now it’s empty... daytime. The party is a distant memory. We see an ADULT MARIE, moving through the living room. Looking for something.

A dirt track leads up to a small hill, at the top of which is a NEW ROADHOUSE-STYLE BAR. Castiel’s TRUCK is parked at its entrance. The front awning is lit up by a neon sign declaring ‘ROCKY’S BAR’, and the porch is lined with glowing mosquito lamps.

Footage from 2.01 IN MY TIME OF DYING, in which our Dean continues past ANOTHER YOUNGER SAM AND DEAN, this time outside a hospital room watching JOHN WINCHESTER being given compressions by a nurse. Dean pauses, turns to look back at his father, but as he does the hospital walls dissolve...
CHUCK’S HERE.
A beat, as Dean absorbs this-- and he immediately starts ADVANCING ON MICHAEL.
I can make my own choices, Sam.
THE EMPTY
(running his lines)
Dean shakes his head, chuckling. He hangs an arm over Sam’s shoulder and admires their work.
Last I checked, we don’t give up on family.
As I said, I know my Father. His weakness lies in arrogance. In ignoring what doesn’t interest Him, because He never thinks it could be important. That’s how I knew He wouldn’t be watching my movements, when Lucifer was busy torturing the three of you.
We’re uh, not playing that version.
CASTIEL
All well and good, but how do we get to the Empty in the first place? I’ve never heard of anything that could open a rift to that place.
He says, “be there in five”. Gone for

CASTIEL
And Dean realizes, in that moment, that what is between them isn’t delicate or breakable at all. He knows what he needs to say.
I mean, yeah. You guys did bizarre, unsympathetic crap all on your own.
Dean is fully aware that this is mostly just a way to get him involved... but he doesn’t mind.
CUT TO:
Jack is sitting on CASTIEL’S BED, looking defeated. He holds out his hand, as though about to cast magic. Frowning deeply in concentration. But nothing happens.
(disbelieving)
So how many we talkin’ here, fellas? A few hundred per state? A few thousand? We’re gonna need to give the local departments a heads-up.

ROWENA
In a church, where a bored ANAEL/SISTER JO is sorting money out in a cash box. She looks up as a shadow falls over her desk.
I’d say we should drink to that, but, well. Dean here never had very good grip.
(nonchalance dropped)
Ash walks over to the table from the bar, following Jack. He tilts his beer bottle towards Jack as he speaks.

Dean smirks.
A beat, as Death looks pointedly at both of them.

We open on Sam and Eileen on the couch in the Dean Cave, watching something on TV. Eileen is fast asleep and leaning on Sam’s shoulder. Sam is looking at Eileen adoringly... totally missing whatever’s on the screen.
Dean and Sam duck for cover and ROLL OUT OF THE WAY with a yell.
(a little surprised)
Jack’s not all-powerful anymore. He and Amara gave up their power to fix Heaven.
I think Dean would have said yes to anything to get Cas back. Maybe he didn’t think this through.

Does a story bleed outside the lines?
CHUCK
I’m... glad someone is keeping track. Anyway, I just wanted to check in. Thought I might grab a few mattresses and drag them into the study, so we can sleep. You should join us.
FADE TO BLACK.
Dean looks back at the HUNDREDS OF COPIES OF HIMSELF.
Nothing. Look, just take it, man, okay? I don’t need this crap on my conscience.
(flippant)
CASTIEL
handsome man. Think... Damian Lewis. Toby Stephens.
Well, the whole system is unfair, isn’t it? I mean, all monsters go to Purgatory, but then they just die there too? And what, that means-- people like Garth, they go there just because they were bitten?

JACK!
ROWENA

But do you think you can control the tornado? Redirect it towards Chuck?

Kevin, please, lighten up. You’re here because we’re throwing a little party.
Kid, you think you can hold this power? How long we got?
Well, sadly I can’t stay for long this time-- Fergus and I have been busy cleaning up on your behalf.
CASTIEL
Please, Dean. I’ve told you a million times to call me Janice. Come around tomorrow then, and I’ll put out some tea and cookies.
Okay.
Basically nothing. They won’t tell me what went down, but I’m not dumb. I know you and Sam and Dean saved the world somehow and that’s why we’ve got all this crap on our heads with the Fall or whatever.

Rowena smiles at Castiel. Slightly condescending. Not the first man who has underestimated the true reach of her knowledge and ability.
I would’ve thought you’d want to get back to Eileen.
She gasps, and races out of bed, down the corridor.
LUCIFER (CONT’D)
Sam and Dean look at each other. Clearly, they’ve thought something similar... but they aren’t going to question Jack’s decision in front of Bobby. At least, not

CASTIEL

Orders? Cas, you saw him. He’s drinking demon blood. It’s so much worse than we thought. Dean was trying to stop him.
Chuck sighs. Tired of all this fourth-wall breaking.

Michael enters, stopping short at the doorway. Glaring at Chuck.
Not-- listening...

On Dean, sitting in one of the adjacent armchairs. Watching them with a fond smile.
Oh my god. What’s happening?
Claire turns again, blonde hair whipping out behind her, and marches out of the garage.

We see his jaw twitch as he thinks hard about something. He downs the finger of whiskey he has, and gets up. Reaches the cabinet, picks up the GLASS DECANTER, and pours himself another.

Uh, sure. Glad to know you see it our way.

CASTIEL

Don’t ask me, dear. I’m just in charge of the souls that get sent downwards.
That’s a compliment ’round these parts. Come here, angel.

I’m not sure. The balance between the Light and the Darkness right now is tenuous at best. If Jack dissolves his own power--

Claire approaches him from behind, shoes crunching on gravel.
Chuck makes a casual gesture.
Now, is that any way to treat an old friend?

DEATH
Prove me wrong.
Uh. Hey. Jack, and uh. C-Cas. I dunno where you guys are-- are at, but--
Weakness? Dean’s the reason I’m here. How do you think I beat Lucifer? Hell, we beat God. You think I’m afraid of you?
Eileen looks at Castiel properly, and puts down the plate she’s finished drying. She taps Castiel on the shoulder for attention.
Listen, it’s a game. You’ve just gotta go along with it, okay? You have to want to win no matter what team you’re on.
(oblivious)
Crap.
ACT ONE
Quite the gift.
ROWENA
ROWENA
Ever’body get in right
Sam’s phone starts buzzing with a text, as does Dean’s. The two share a confused look.
WIDE EXTERIOR SHOT of the Bunker stretching out from the ground, lower levels breaking free to the surface.
Am I that obvious?
Azazel considers this.
Looks like it’s just you and us, angel. So-- tell me. You still able to drink us under the table now we’re dead?
A party.
Dean grabs Castiel firmly and throws them both through the portal. Their figures are LIT UP by the portal light as they go.
Hey, Sam. Sam. Come on. Wake up.
On Rowena. Surprised, and the slightest bit revolted.
We shall just have to take a deeper look.
I mean, I consulted some builders. I wanted this place to stay standing, alright? But most of it really was just me and Cas.
(a beat again, as he swallows)
I’ll get it. You have no idea how to navigate my laptop files, I don’t want you messing something up.
Sam runs to his side. Heedless of Chuck now, just needing to reach his brother...
After all the innuendos you made about Eileen the past year? No way. I think I’m entitled.

What the hell? I swear it had like ninety percent...
MUSIC (V.O.) (CONT’D)
I’m gonna ask Eileen to marry me.

CASTIEL
Jack and Dean share a look. Not touching that with a ten-foot pole.
He turns to Sam, a bit uncertain. He still doesn’t like the idea of Heaven, but no more Hell-- that’s something.
Yeah, we do. That’s why everyone’s here.
Balthazar dies, his GRACE-LIGHT filling the building.
Meanwhile Jack cries out, and starts shaking-- BLACK VEINS start CRAWLING UP HIS SKIN, his eyes UNFOCUSED...
(noticing their expressions)
I’m not God anymore, though. And sometimes, I wake up and I feel like I don’t deserve this. There are so many things I didn’t fix.

Eileen rolls her eyes, and gestures for Sam and his trolley to follow her.
Oh, and how do you know? Huh? He brought back a bunch of other demons that seemed just fine murderin’ people. What was the litmus test on being human, anyway? They all line up in pretty dresses and tell Death their greatest wish is world peace?
Of course you are.
(viciously pleased)
Hey, uh, everyone. Thanks for being here.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Where else would his home be?
He cuts himself off, and looks away. Dean watches this with all the comprehension, and horror, that recent events have given him. His counterpart, however, is oblivious... and intrigued. He puts down a pair of jeans he is holding, and advances on the younger Castiel.
But Chuck flicks his index finger. Effortlessly forces them back to their knees.
What. About. Him.
And why the hell should I believe that?
No better time for a Scotch.
MUSIC (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Despite Castiel’s instructions, he gets up to follow Castiel and Sam to the infirmary--
Then to Sam and Dean-- widening into a BATTLE STANCE. For all the good it will do them.
Dean glares at him. But after a beat, he leans under the counter and gets a beer out from the fridge. Flicks it across the counter to Sam.
ON SAM, drawing out a knife with one hand and a gun with the other. Knowing there’s no chance in hell he can stop them all before they get to his brother... but not about to go down without a fight.
On the Sheriff. Giving up on the papers on his desk to click through his computer files.
New CLOSE ON a photograph of
Jack said that, huh?

(laughing awkwardly)
AERIAL WIDE SHOT on the outside of the Bunker. The Waywards are saying goodbye to Castiel, Jack and Eileen.
(acerbic)
For the first time since Michael entered, Lucifer looks at Dean and Jack. But where’s--
Castiel thinks on this. He stares out at the lake, and throws bread to the ducks.
Dean gets out a bottle of beer for himself, and drags a bar stool out from under his side of the counter. He sits down on it, unscrewing the beer bottle cap as he does.
Yeah. I guess-- he does.
Dean is completely thrown by this response. Castiel seems to regret it for a second, but not enough to make him stay. He strides away towards...
(churlish)
CASTIEL
On Amara, expression slowly turning from disdain into open curiosity.
It would probably change the equation as soon as you discovered one, just to be petty.
Dean and Michael vanish again--
Don’t worry. My “soul”, such that it is, likes Adam much more than Dean.
Amara taking over Chuck’s eyes-- INKY BLACK. She regards Dean--
Come in.
MICHAEL
ROWENA
On Sam, laughing with amazement.
I want you to have it. Honestly, it was failing me recently. As though it was damaged. If you can use it without trouble, then perhaps that is a sign you’re more worthy of whatever scraps of power remain.
Uh, well. I got no right askin’ how that happened, and frankly I don’t wanna know, but... welcome to the family, I guess?
She glares at Alex. Clearly Alex is not out of the bad books for some previous party-throwing.
I am. Jack, I suppose, is something like an angel. He held on to my grace. I wanted him to. In case something goes wrong.
It’s a hunter’s bar, Dean. You’re gonna get a lot of people asking for beer.
You wanna know something? I begged Chuck to bring him back. I would have given him

Jody enters, and finds the kitchen in a strange state of tension.
I’m not sure what a Leviathan feels like, and I’m not sure I want to know. But I certainly felt some powerful, vicious beasts inside him. Honestly, boys, I got barely the faintest impression of what was going on. It was like standing in the middle of a tornado for a moment and trying to identify what kinds of debris were caught up in the vortex.
AMARA
--Cas wouldn’t want us to give up.

Uh, uh, uh. No, I don’t think so.

DEAN (CONT’D)
SUDDENLY, the WHOLE PLACE starts SHAKING. BEAMS OF LIGHT are beginning to crack through the darkness.
Sam throws him a FILTHY BITCHFACE.
Rowena finally looks up at Sam. Vicious, visceral pleasure in her eyes.
I doubt Dean has ever thought anything through. Especially not when it comes to that angel of his. Or his brother, for that matter.
On a much younger JOHN AND MARY WINCHESTER. Standing over a crib, looking down proudly at a young Sam. A toddler Dean is in Mary’s arms.
Dean looks up, aghast. The scene around them has frozen, and the younger Dean and Castiel are stuck in a tableau where we left them.
Oh, I’ve been filling their glasses with water for a while now.
YOUNGER CASTIEL
Then Chuck leans back, breathing deeply.
YOUNGER DEAN (CONT’D)
CHUCK is lying in a beach resort chair. Not a care in the world. Sun-bathing. Wearing sunglasses. Holding one of those TANNING REFLECTORS. We hear a radio crackle, and Chuck frowns. Lowers his sunglasses and looks up.
Right now, the wider world-- civilians-- they’re waking up to the reality of the supernatural. They’ll need all the help they can get reckoning with that.
MICHAEL
S’fine, Sam. I’ll get out of your hair. Find a case, or somethin’.
Nice try, Dean, but you’re hardly the first man to try that one on for size.

We don’t know that.

Uh, well. Congrats. But you know, you don’t get to sit in my car just ’cos you’re...

That phrasing catches Sam by surprise. There’s something about the way Jack spoke that makes him uneasy.
BECKY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
--a hardware store, lined with overflowing shelves.
Then keep a few, few enough that you can silence them when you need. Few enough that your energy won’t be wasted on subduing millions.
Michael’s my son but you don’t see me getting all telenovela about it. Speaking of which--
No, it’s fine. I s’pose Cas never moved in properly. He was always flying off somewhere, doing something, and I-- well, I figured he liked it that way.
CHUCK
Maybe Billie, or the Empty-- maybe they could have stopped him. Maybe we could have made a deal. But I thought it was her. And now... everyone is gone.

(exasperated)
ON DEAN, looking back with disgust.
--and they LEAP at Sam, who yells and starts FIRING HIS GUN at monster after monster--
ROWENA
Jack fetches the ball from the goal area, and then places it back in the center of the table. They continue playing the game.
A group of male fans shaking hands and exchanging numbers.
And I want that yard to be clear by the time I get back!
Cleaning up?
CUT TO:
On Dean, struggling not to react...
CASTIEL (CONT’D)
But nobody rules Purgatory.
’Cos I would have thought you’d be happier. Getting him back from the dead twice-- hell, what has it been now? Ten, twelve times?
(to Jack)
Dean looks away, upset, like maybe this wasn’t such a good idea after all. Whatever it is between them is so delicate it’s about to break. Then--
CASTIEL
The others are confused by this question.
Yeah, this seems like a sad person vehicle. Like--

Sam and Eileen, sharing Sam’s room. GETTING DRESSED. Sam is brushing his teeth over the sink. He turns around to smile playfully at Eileen with a MOUTH FULL OF TOOTHPASTE. Eileen turns away, rolling her eyes-- but she’s grinning. Fond.
CROSSFADE TO:
ROWENA
AZAZEL
See. This is why Sammy is my favorite. Always so smart.
Sam. You were just talking to a whole bunch of hunters in here. Telling them about how we need to work together and so on. So don’t you hesitate to call for backup, you hear me? Besides, the last thing the Association needs is its fearless leader going down a mere day after its first official meeting.

The Bunker’s nearly a century old. We were bound to run into problems sooner or later.
Remind me which code name that was, Sheriff?
It will work.
WIDE SHOT from behind Castiel and Jack, silhouetted by the sunrise. Still sitting at the edge of the shore.
The Empty is a realm of the afterlife, where souls are made material, and bodies are rendered immaterial.
I don’t even know if-- I don’t know how to--

On Dean and Jack. Realizing they just lost the best hope they had.
Dean snorts in disbelief, and then his composure cracks. He rubs his hand over his face to hide it.
AMARA (CONT’D)
DONNA
If we can find a way for Jack to absorb all that power-- all the souls, yes, but more to the point-- all of the angelic grace and demonic miasma stored in stasis--
What do you want?
There’s always a price.
ROWENA
comes back, Dean.
The last rays of the sun are peeking through the slats in the blinds. SHERIFF KEN stands at his work desk, the office otherwise empty.
He grins. With a little flourish, he indicates his new body.
EILEEN
Fine. Fine!
He looks across at Sam. They both know that was the wrong thing to say. Dean looks forward again and amends--
There’s a beat, which tells Dean all he needs to know.
YOUNGER DEAN (CONT’D)
No. It’s not your fault. Heaven was held together by-- as humans would say, spit, duct tape and prayer. Without the power of the angels to hold it together--
It’s different this time.

DEAN (CONT’D)
(waving him off)
The ROPE GLOWS WHITE, and then Rowena WHIPS OUT her RIGHT ARM towards the back wall-- channeling the power from Jack, it COLLIDES into the brickwork. A BLAST OF POWER STARBURSTS around the impact zone.
What I used to want was... peace and quiet. But now...
was the Michael Sword. Why did you give your blade to Sam?
Maybe I’m just not as optimistic as the rest of you.
The change can be... frustrating. When there are people you love that you can’t help anymore. But humanity has its benefits.
It’s me.
The monsters are PUMMELING SAM, and he gives out a WAR CRY--
(interrupting immediately)
We jettin’ or what?
Christ. Pamela, we’re going to need a whole lot more booze.
(rage subsiding into overwhelming, raw grief)
Dean struggles to parse Michael’s significant, meaning-laden expression.

You have both remade the afterlife once, and it has already had unforeseen consequences. I think perhaps... that this time, we should ask for some advice before we begin.
The others react with shock--
No. Look, I mean, there’s just been a lot of violence around here recently, you know? And my wife, and my kid...
Okay, Cas, I need to say something.
Dean looks down. Ashamed.
Sam draws a barstool out for himself, and Castiel copies the action. Once Sam is sitting down, he takes a moment to fully appreciate the bar.

It’s not the power, or the status, or even the ability to pulverize anyone that irritated me into atoms.

Alright, can we-- can we skip this bit? I don’t need to watch this.
You know Ash, when you called me in for an emergency meeting, I had no idea the emergency was serving drinks to an ex-angel.
If what you say is true, it’s an intriguing idea. Of course, you realize the kinds of things I’m keeping safe, don’t you? All sort of evil. More powerful than you. Maybe more powerful than that Nephilim. And if that child springs a leak, well...
Sam laughs, a little sheepish.
CASTIEL
He leans in and--

Yes. I... needed some space.
She’s in Heaven. Cas said she was at peace.
I just hope he knows what he’s doing.

A beat, in which Sam remembers that Rowena
WIDE SHOT on Ash, Bobby, Ellen, Jo, Pamela and Rufus in Harvelle’s Roadhouse in Heaven.
He leans down and uses his blade edge to delicately encourage Dean’s neck up. It’s an almost sensual act.
But if the spinach is there, we just work out how to open the can, and... Popeye’s our uncle. How hard can it be?
Castiel? Are you alright?
WIDE SHOT on the Bunker exterior. Amara walking down the driveway, away from the Bunker. Castiel and Jack follow close behind her.
You know Cas possessed me, right? It was seriously-- I can’t even describe it. Said stuff about how I was chosen, how it was in my blood, and that he could save my dad. So I just said yes. And then it was... Like a rollercoaster ride that just kept falling, and falling. I would have been screaming the whole time, if I could’ve opened my mouth. But even when I was out of my mind, I got glimmers of his thoughts. His feelings.
TORTURER 1
To prove this, Chuck waves his left hand towards Rowena, reviving her--
REVERSE ANGLE TO behind Jack’s head-- the laptop screen is partially obscured, but he’s watching an old ‘Star Trek’ episode. Sam enters from the war room.
WIDE SHOT of everyone in the room laughing.
CUT TO:
Death stares at them. One eyebrow raised.
Dean, recognizing the scene, starts running a hand over his face, pacing restlessly.
MICHAEL
BLACKOUT.
YOUNGER DEAN (CONT’D)
INT. MEN OF LETTERS – JACK’S ROOM – MORNING
Some minor notes and extras for anyone interested:
The-- souls. You told me, when Cas became God, it made him crazy. He couldn’t control it. Killed people. And I--
MICHAEL
Rowena and Amara took him to
(firm)
(checking them off)
It’s not about power. It never was.
ALASTAIR
I thought that was the plan.
. You Winchesters don’t understand the finer points of politics. I knew if there was a powerful being who had been summoned, there was a chance that being could be turned against Chuck-- if they weren’t enemies already.
I’m certain that my thoughts, my motivations... aren’t what He would write. He would have had me kill Lucifer myself-- and kill Jack, for that matter.
MICHAEL
CASTIEL
I lost someone important, too.
(looking at Castiel)
DEAN (CONT’D)
ON AMARA, determined. Unyielding and all-powerful. She walks towards him, one step at a time, until she’s close enough to touch him--
LUCIFER
As the light fades, we see MICHAEL has appeared beside Dean-- still wearing the younger John Winchester’s visage. He clasps Dean’s left shoulder. Dean winces, and flinches away from his grip.
Okay. I’ll, I’ll call you.
Dean insisted on trying a chili-based cocktail on the first day, and I lost the sensation of taste for a week and a half.
Everyone gets up at once-- but Castiel holds out a hand.
Then the younger Dean TEARS HIMSELF away, turning on the spot and stalking back towards the motel bed. He yanks open the duffel bag and starts rummaging about again.
Cas? Is that you-you, or are we--
JACK (CONT’D)
INT. MEN OF LETTERS – LIBRARY – DAY
ON EILEEN, looking at a shopping list while Sam and Dean bicker.
(with utmost sympathy)
She waves her hands in the air, and both Jack and Rowena’s eyes GLOW-- tendrils of light purple mist extend out from both of their bodies. Then BOOM! The tendrils CONNECT, and COALESCE into a THICK ROPE OF POWER.
Very well. If you believe this is the right thing to do, I will attempt to-- help.
EXT./INT. IMPALA – SHERIFF’S OFFICE – TWILIGHT
Suddenly, bursting through the BACK DOOR--
What-d’you-call-’em. Wiccans. You know, Satan worship, that kind of thing.
Uh-- yeah. May as well try it. Hit the books, watch some old movies. Chuck’ll be fed up in no time.
--but it carries straight on, ignoring her.
ON SAM, tense-- we hear the phone ringing just as we hear buzzing somewhere else inside the Bunker.
MICHAEL
Jack!
Recreate it.
Sam looks up at Dean. Tears welling in his eyes.
Back to Sam and Dean. Time has clearly passed since we last saw them-- sunset aside, the two are now wearing their FBI SUITS. A song is playing on the car stereo. The volume is low, the music barely noticeable background noise.
MICHAEL
He tosses the hex bag at Azazel.
That’s why I was

My whole life, I’ve been following the same script. Look after Sam. Save the girl. Hunt whatever evil thing was in front of me. And that stuff-- I was
Alright. It’s ready. Jack--

CLAIRE
CHUCK
Off Crowley, flaring his nostrils, radiating ‘You simpleton. You absolute buffoon’ with every fiber of his being. He flaps his hands in the air--
Awesome.
But how did you control them?
You know, you’re really rude.
(aghast)
The Empty sees this happening, and SCREECHES with fury.
(signing ‘sorry’ in ASL repeatedly)
ON CHUCK, crossing his arms. Casually considering his options. Picking the next ice-cream flavor to sample.
Uh. Let me pronounce this right-- Azazel? Is that it?

Dean, are you

In a mirror of 5.22 SWAN SONG, we get--
Castiel looks between Meg and The Empty, confused for a moment. Then the confusion clears, and he nods in acknowledgement.

He let his guard down enough to get drugged, got his guard down enough to sit there happily while--
What, it’s morning already?
SHERIFF KEN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
MUSIC (V.O.) (CONT’D)
SHERIFF KEN (CONT’D)
Off Dean and Jack, looking from Michael to each other-- as though debating wordlessly whether to trust their new guest.
I’d love to.
. It’s what we do.
CLOSE ON TORTURER 2-- DEAD. His eyes unfocus. Vacant.
Chuck was the one who kept bringing him back to life. During your Apocalypse, at least.
Babe?
Did you have a longer list?
It’s not much to go on.
Dean always said you were the one who snored.
Footage from 4.19 JUMP THE SHARK, in which YOUNGER SAM AND DEAN burn ADAM MILLIGAN--

DEATH
Dad took him back to spare me from that. Gave his life for it. So yeah, Cas is
‘street cred’.
As the two remaining ex-demons advance, she backs away behind a stone column. Fires again-- HITS ONE, who goes down-- then DAMN. Out of bullets.
You shouldn’t have that power. How the hell did I miss you?
EXT. KELLY’S CABIN – NIGHT
CLOSE ON ADAM, smiling at him. Affectionate. Familiar.
How is he?
Moose! I see your powers of perception remain as stunningly acute as ever.
Something like that. Whatever Jack is right now, Chuck is afraid of him. It’s why He sent Lucifer and I here-- why He told both of us to kill Jack. When I detected Lucifer’s presence on Earth, I realized what Chuck had done. Doubled His chances of success-- or at least, a good show.
EILEEN
Back on Dean, driving. A slight smile on his face.
But now there’s nothing left to create conflict...
the one advancing on Azazel.
WIDE AERIAL SHOT as THE IMPALA pulls into the Men of Letters driveway. The first light of day is breaking through the cloud cover. Scattered sounds of distant birdsong. It’s quiet... PEACEFUL. SAM AND DEAN WINCHESTER step out of the Impala, and the doors slam shut on either side.
Come on, Cas. What, she not your type?
He can’t say the words. But he doesn’t have to; Sam understands him perfectly.
TEENAGE BOY 2
So, what do you cool cats need from us, then? Advice? An eBay wish list?
Should we follow him?
ROWENA
The Empty screams, and rushes forward. Michael stands in front of Dean, and yells--
You’re
A DARK-HAIRED WOMAN, from the knife fight in the opening of 15.22 LET IT BLEED. The woman looks down at her. Smiling deviously.
He holds the door open, and Jack and Amara walk into the Roadhouse. As Amara passes, Ash adds an aside to her.
Dean digs his phone out from his pocket.

Sam flinches. He is surprised by this sudden question, with no idea where Jack found it.

Dean tries and fails to get to his feet. He struggles, half-crawling in The Empty’s direction, still clutching his throat.
Dean gets a goofy smile on his face, and then ducks his head. Clearly thinking about Cas.
Dean looks around, disorientated-- then he realizes where he is.
(amused)

Yeah, it’s-- fine. Just needed a break, to stretch my legs.
Ugh. I can’t wait to sleep.

He snaps his fingers, and A HORDE OF MONSTERS appear all around Sam and Dean. All types of species from past seasons-- vampires, werewolves, banshees, croats, rawheads, tulpas, wraiths, wendigos, Jefferson Starships... the works.

So, what is your grand scheme, hmm? What do you propose?

And we made our own family, too.
Kaia and Jack exchange a warm smile. Kindred spirits.
I hope she didn’t double up on any of the shopping!
(rolling her eyes)
MICHAEL
The Empty snarls. Fingers abruptly stop stroking-- and instead tighten violently around Castiel’s leg.
That’s right.
You’re just... leaving? That’s it?
But as time went on, it took on a life of its own.
But Chuck STOPS HIM with no effort, Michael seemingly frozen against his will--
(thrown by this choice of topic)
Sam and Dean exchange a baffled look. A talking polar bear???
What, no make-out? No fist-fight? You gotta give me something.

Seems like my Father only saw fit to bring back the characters He thought mattered. Which brings me to--
WIDE SHOT of a green, sparsely forested area. It’s scenic, peaceful... and totally isolated. Nobody around for miles.
Here’s a trick I learned from the Queen of Hell.
And we dissolve into--
Castiel turns, and sees ANNA MILTON behind him.
Thank you again for reading! I’m also on tumblr under this
Dean turns back around, dumps an assortment of bottles on the counter, and starts pouring them into a mixer.
Off Castiel, seeing him go. Frowning...
MICHAEL
DONNA
Another pause, this time even more awkward. Dean and Jack, distant on the bed. Unclear on where they stand-- on how much comfort to give each other.
Michael ignores her, seeing Dean and Castiel running towards him. Meg double-takes, then looks very pleased.
Mrs. B. How are the kids?
Maybe he isn’t. I mean, who knows what’s going on inside him? When Death put up a wall in my mind, I felt fine until it started... disintegrating.
Okay, you know what? I actually think I’m going to get my hands dirty. Need to vent my frustration. ’Cos you guys are
(sincere)
Off Dean, rolling his eyes-- but grinning.
Perhaps we all have disappointing fathers in common.

Whatever you choose to be... you’ll still be family.
ANGLE ON CHUCK, casually leaning in the doorway of the kitchen. Wearing Dean’s DEAD GUY ROBE. Looking like he’s made himself

A FLASH OF GRACE-LIGHT--

Sam laughs, despite himself, but quickly stifles it when Death turns his unamused gaze on him.
ON DEAN, frowning. Hand out to hold him back.
EXT. KELLY’S CABIN/LAKE – DAWN
I’ll fix it.
Yes. One by one, the strings would be cut, until the fabric of reality started unravelling. And at that point, I fear not even you and I would be able to mend it.
Oh. OH MY GOD.
She DISSOLVES into A SPIRAL OF BLACK SMOKE that seeps into JACK. Jack’s eyes shine with GRACE-LIGHT.
THE EMPTY (CONT’D)
ANGLE ON OUR CASTIEL. Tears now rolling down his cheeks.
A shot of Sam. Pensive.

I guess it always has to start somewhere.

Yeah, well.

Jack and Amara stare at him curiously. Then--
That... works?
CLOSE ON DEAN, breathing in his first fresh gulp of air--
Jack? Are you okay?
I know. I’m sorry for mentioning him, I just wanted to tell you what you told me.
Man, it’s freezing in here.
I am now.
Yeah, so... that whole witchy condom of power thing goes both ways.
Sam isn’t reassured by that at all.
I mean, you’re the angel, right? Cas? Bobby, Jo and Ellen always talk about you and your dumb JC Penny coat.

Yeah, well maybe I didn’t tell you the full story, Sam.

Patience says something snarky back, and Kaia, Alex and Claire dissolve into poorly-concealed giggles.
Yes sir.
No, I can’t, I can’t-- I can’t do it right now, alright, because--

we do?
I-- you ever--
KEVIN
Oh, come on, it’s not my fault Cas can’t handle a little spice.
Oh, shut up for a minute, Fergus!

POV SHOT as she looks at her palms. Turns over her hands, examining them.
END OF ACT TWO
And even though the memories will fade--

Was he wrong? Our whole lives, you’ve been following after Dad, doing what he told you to do. Looking after me, and hunting the things you’re meant to.
MICHAEL (V.O.)
AMARA (CONT’D)
I think I want to be human for a while longer.
--and sometimes for the worse.
Hunting, or Dad?
A beat, as they all look on Jack’s motionless form. Then, steeling himself, Castiel bites the bullet.
CASTIEL
I was Dad’s soldier, and then I was Michael’s Sword, and right up until the end I was Chuck’s plaything. You know how screwed up I was over Chuck. I’ve never felt like I was in control of our lives-- of
OVER THE SHOULDER MID SHOT of JACK, standing at the far end of the room. Staring at the TELESCOPE in the alcove. In the background, we hear the other residents of the Bunker as muffled, faint dialogue.
I hate this. We’re basically just regular feds now. What happened to good old-fashioned sulfur-sniffing? A little ‘Christo’ here and there?
CHUCK (CONT’D)
Explaining this to you will be a chore, won’t it? You see, your Jack wasn’t sure what to do with all those souls inside him. So he decided to give them a go at humanity.
CASTIEL

WIDE SHOT. Our Castiel looks on, distressed, as a BURST OF GRACE-LIGHT takes the scene to a WHITEOUT.
I don’t have demon blood anymore, but that doesn’t mean I’m powerless. It just means now
This place... it feels different. Separate to the rest of Heaven.
OFF SAM AND DEAN, exchanging a look.
AZAZEL (CONT’D)
That’s--
! Michael told me that Chuck had sent him to kill Jack, and I realized the boy must be something that Chuck himself couldn’t touch. So, I told him if he could keep the Big Man distracted, I’d do my best to work with whatever nightmare you lot had gotten yourselves into.
(confused, but grinning)
We always fight. I don’t-- I said something I shouldn’t have, and now it feels worse than before.
So lemme get this straight-- you’re giving
You really shouldn’t have come.

MICHAEL (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Everyone stares at Chuck as he rambles.
(to Sam and Eileen)
CHUCK
No. That’s not who I am...
Half-past ten. I understand it must be hard to keep track inside this place. The lack of windows... something about it is not dissimilar to the Cage.
Castiel stands watch over him, gravely concerned. He hears a sound and looks up to see Michael-- now again in Adam’s body-- enter the infirmary.
Thank you for protecting my wife.
Nah dude, they’re alien abductees. A hundred percent.
ROWENA
--‘Modern Family’ stuff just isn’t my jam.
Oh, that’s a shame, isn’t it?
A fresh start.
MUSIC (V.O.) (CONT’D)
A beat. Everyone looks at Ash. He stares off into the distance, focused on a distant thought.

MUSIC (V.O.)
Not this time.
(under her breath)
On Eileen, Donna and Jody chatting.
How did you self-sabotage this time?
Archangel blades? That’s not like you. You’d just smite Michael where he stood. But you didn’t, because you’re worried if you use the power required to do that, Jack will absorb it. And if he absorbs enough, maybe he can kill you.
The scene dissolves into--
ON SAM, looking up at the windows around them. Somewhat dazzled by the sunlight.
CLOSE ON DEAN. A mirror of the shots and expressions from the Dean vs. Dean confrontation in 3.10 DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME.
CLAIRE
(signing ‘I see you!’)
CHUCK (CONT’D)
And, also, we’re gonna be better at communicating. Set up the Men of Letters equipment with proper tech, bring us all into the 21st century-- have this place be open to hunters who need a halfway point. It’s all a little hazy right now, but Eileen--
Dean, staring at an open closet situated behind his door. Looking at a row of jackets and plaid shirts.
OFF DEAN, smiling back. ‘Go get her, Sammy’.
(angrily)
No. It’s having Adam’s thoughts in my mind, making biting retorts to your witticisms that only I could hear.
The memory-replica of Dean freezes. The Empty appears in front of our Dean-- reaches out and GRABS HIS NECK, choking him.
--but Jack thrusts his arm over the bowl of ingredients, and BLOOD starts flowing fast and thick into the bowl. Rowena closes her eyes...
MICHAEL
He’s awake.
(aggressive)
(indignant)
CASTIEL
--and he draws Jack into the GROUP HUG.
Bobby and Jody cast a sideways look towards Jack-- who remains perfectly attentive. Like an eager schoolkid.
A beat, as Jack frowns-- remembering that Dean has seemed out of it recently.
It’s fine, Dean. It’s not really what I--
Eileen blinks, remembering.
Castiel’s eyes go wide, and the music swells as--
CHUCK
Ugh. Boys.
Back where we left Sam and Azazel--
to be a way.

Well, what the clever boy has done is separate the souls from their power.

ROWENA
Well, you know me. Happy to provide the entertainment.
Yeah. Yeah, thank you.
(quiet)
MICHAEL
Immediately, LOUD SIRENS go off and the LIGHTS START FLASHING RED. Castiel and Jack look up in alarm. Amara simply looks bored.
Protect you.
She takes Michael and Jack out of the library. Sam and Dean are left alone together.
Yes, Sheriff. We got him.
No. Well, my Father let Lucifer create a Nephilim. I think He wanted an all-powerful evil for the Winchesters to face off against-- but then, as always, Castiel managed to surprise Him. You all did.
What? Ally? Oh, don’t be silly, dear. I know how the Winchester brothers operate. I just worry that I’ll go the same, permanent way as Fergus.
INT. THE IMPALA – NIGHT
Sam exhales. Relieved he’s not getting his head bitten off.
That was-- when I was young. When Castiel realized what I was doing, he taught me how to stop myself. I mentioned something to him that I had read from his own emotions, and he-- he told me there are some things that people don’t want shared, or talked about. He said that humans would consider it a violation to have obtained such knowledge without their consent.
Technically. I am sorry that you had Lucifer for a father.
I wish I could help. Being human, it’s so-- so limiting.
Nah, it’s not even a good adaptation. Let’s get ‘Lord of the Rings’ going,

No, not in God. In

No thanks to you. Get the cuffs on while they’re still down.
Amara ignores him, now focused on healing Sam.

Which M.O. is that, exactly?
Still, the boy has a point. You might want to stand a wee bit further back, just in case.

Hate to break it to you, but this ain’t a garden so much as a morgue.
Now that Dean is looking at him again, Castiel is nervous-- but he doesn’t look away. He’s never really been able to look away from Dean.
I don’t know what you did, but...
A beat, and then Michael gives a single nod.
(almost regretful)
ROWENA (CONT’D)
There’s a brief silence, as Rowena fiddles with the book she has propped open on her lap, and Sam stares very hard at the table between them. Then Rowena speaks-- deliberately casual. Still not looking up from her book.
EILEEN
MICHAEL
Yeah, I-- thanks.
Okay, I just-- need to say this, alright?
This is pointless.
Footage from 14.18 ABSENCE, in which YOUNGER SAM AND DEAN burn the remains of MARY WINCHESTER--
You could get every dead thing spilling right back out into that world of yours.
Crowley’s mouth SLAMS shut, clearly the result of a spell from Rowena.
They knifed him. Carved up his pretty new face. The name ‘Lucifer’ doesn’t mean what it used to, thanks to the Winchesters. So, I thought-- maybe little Sammy really did it. Outsmarted me, outsmarted more than one King of Hell, and finally crawled his way to the
As they separate, PULL FOCUS from the couple on to Dean’s face, which goes slack with shock--
Dean huffs out a nervous breath.
AMARA
I told you, it won’t be enough. Besides, I think Chuck learned enough about Jack’s new powers to not try something like that again.
Castiel walks towards the building. Amara and Jack wait a few yards behind him as he starts loudly addressing the Roadhouse.
MAMMON
YES! That’s what I’m
Winchesters? I thought-- they didn’t seem that tough, for the brothers who felled Lucifer and Michael both. You sure it’s them, boss?
Why-- why am I seeing these memories?
ELLEN
It’s true! And honestly, I’m grateful. This place is what’s gonna help draw hunters to the Association HQ.
(exasperated)
Dean hisses in pain. As he draws his arm back we see his KNUCKLES HAVE SPLIT. Then room shakes, and dissolves into--
The group turns to Eileen again. She looks pained. Eileen looks at Castiel, trying to communicate something but unable to say the words.
MICHAEL
AMARA
Yeah, like. Psychic powers.
CLOSE ON DEAN, grimacing.
Jack looks at Cas, pleadingly. Castiel shrugs.
ROWENA
You know, all those years ago-- right before the Winchesters sent us to the Cage-- you were trying to talk me into rebelling against His plan.
THE EMPTY
So, some angels and demons have half-developed souls. But what does this have to do with Jack?
The younger Castiel watches the younger Dean, unfathomably sad.
Blue Eyes. Let’s start the process.
Oh, come on. That’s good stuff!
THE EMPTY
(relenting)
Then YOUNGER DEAN and YOUNGER CASTIEL walk in through the door. Wearing the same clothes as they were in 9.06 HEAVEN CAN’T WAIT. They’re arguing, and the younger Dean swings around as soon as they’re both clear of the doorway and chucks his DUFFEL BAG on the bed next to our Dean. Then he starts stripping off his JACKET. Hangs it next to the door. He’s not looking at the younger Castiel.
CASTIEL
But that ain’t all there is.
As we dolly slowly into the library, we see others. Hunters we know from the 12.06 CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF ASA FOX talking with EILEEN LEAHY. CASTIEL talking with CHARLIE BRADBURY (ALTERNATE) and STEVIE. Finally, SAM AND DEAN WINCHESTER talking to BOBBY SINGER (ALTERNATE).
CHARLIE
If your boy hadn’t got me on board before, he certainly has now. Business-minded, this one.
Michael exchanges a look with Sam. There’s some shared history there, history Dean doesn’t have access to and never will.
Camera tracks Dean and Castiel, moving through the crowd-- following Sam out of the library. Others notice them, and start to move towards the war room too...
Michael finally turns to him. For the first time in a while, he looks utterly inhuman. Every inch an ARCHANGEL OF THE LORD.
ELLEN
Dean flinches. He addresses Michael without turning around, choosing instead to concentrate on lighting the stove.

This script series was conceived as a way to write an ending for the show that I could see them filming – what I thought worked best in the context of Season 15, and what I could more or less see them putting on air.

Oh, great, now even Jody’s fallen to it.

MID SHOT of Eileen discussing tactics with the other two, pointing at places on the map.
CLOSE ON CHUCK-- who blinks, revealing one GLOWING GOD EYE and one INKY DARKNESS EYE. We hear AMARA’s desperate gasps for air...

He flicks up his sunglasses. Stares at the tea. Then SMILES at the volunteer gratefully, accepting it.
Whether or not it works to bring Castiel back, if there’s a spell we can use to access the Empty--
Whoa, whoa, lady! I was just kidding! Or you know, I don’t wanna be ass-reamed by Dean when he gets to Heaven.

There’s strength in numbers. And change isn’t going to happen overnight, but it will come. We just have to keep telling people, keep proving that what we say is true. It’s our job to illuminate the darkness; people will turn away. People will be scared. But that doesn’t mean that we should shelter them, or ourselves. We need to have the truth out there.
They’re quiet for another long moment, as they each take a drink from their respective beer bottles.
No, you had a choice. You just made the wrong one.

, and also refers to the two main settings of the episode... and Dean and Castiel. Meant to parallel the title of 4.10 ‘Heaven and Hell’ (the one where Anna chooses to become an angel again.) And finally, adjacent to the lyrics of ‘Heaven is a place on Earth’, of course. I know I put too many callbacks and photographs in this one, but honestly, I’m a sucker for sentimentality (if you couldn’t tell!). I console myself with the fact that Becky wrote this episode, so saccharine fanservice is fair game. The Becky speeches were a continued conversation from Swan Song and Meta Fiction, but also inspired by Jack Rackham’s speech in Black Sails’ excellent finale.
Dean looks up, wide-eyed and murderous.
And we’re gonna splash out on motels, too. My back can’t take those lumpy mattresses anymore.
...Friggin’ angels.
KEVIN
I think you got that the wrong way ’round.
Rowena, Sam and Jack are lying on top of mattresses. They’re in semi-darkness, with a few candles providing light here and there. Books and snacks scattered on the floor around them. It looks a bit like a teenagers’ sleepover.
Oh? You found a special someone, Samuel? Tell me everything. A name, to start.
CASTIEL
Low, wide angle back on Sam--
Good suggestion.
So, he’ll do it?
U-- um. Th-- yeah, I mean. That-- of course--
Up to this point, Dean has barely glanced at him for more than a moment. But after this last statement, Dean stares at Sam for a long beat. Then he looks back to the road. Eyes straight ahead as he replies-- finally honest.
Thing is, we have no idea how many angels or demons were in the Empty to begin with. I mean, it’s not even just human history here. It’s all of Creation.
What does?
WIDE SHOT of the motel, and the scenes dissolve again-- this time re-forming into another motel room we haven’t seen before...
Castiel is already shell-shocked by this admission-- but Dean isn’t done.
I don’t believe it.
Fine, but you’re doing dishes for the next two weeks.
I’m supposed to ask you your question.
Dean and Cas glare at each other. Sam ignores their bickering, instead frowning down at their would-be patient.

He summons an ENOCHIAN SPEAR up from the ground, that PIERCES THROUGH MICHAEL’S CHEST. Michael GASPS.
No, it’s not quite as simple. The physics of Heaven have changed. For most people, it will work-- well, it will work like Earth. But nobody will get sick, or die. And everyone has all the time they need, doing whatever they want. With whoever they want.
