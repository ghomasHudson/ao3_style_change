“Wha-?” Peter must have misheard him.
Fury glared at them with but his gaze was calculating.
Their audience was screaming and going crazy but quieted down enough once the priest started talking.
It was older and missing a good chunk of the papers but it was the one in the same.
Yensen was the first person that came to mind as he usually did when he thought back to the arrogant man he used to be. The guilt from his death had lessened but, as soon as he reflected on that, the fresher sense of guilt burned into his heart and he dropped his head.
Tony flew them to a platform where Rhodes was waiting. Steve stared at the golden faceplate, wishing it would rise and reveal Tony. He could not believe it was him until he actually saw him. Tony landed and gently placed Steve down next to him.
There was a bell on the door that clanged, announcing his arrival to the employees. The front of the store was all windows and made the tiny store bright enough that Peter felt comfortable leaving his sunglasses on. A man came out of the back and called out, “Hello, how can I help you?”
“No…Did you say the Goblin?” Fury asked, his voice sharp and oddly quiet.
so he ate up all the notes available to him which led him to the shield that had been constructed for Captain America and the fact that it had been made out of
“What is happening?” Peter gasped.
It’d been real and
Tony winked at him and remarked, “I think they approve of you, beloved. It looks like half of these articles are about the ‘handsome’ stranger that caught Tony Stark’s eye.”
Wade touched his bare cheek and murmured, “Oh, yeah.” He stopped wearing the mask around Peter and hadn’t gotten around to putting it back on since he and Peter were
Tony lips did not pull away and were trying to smother him and consume him all at once. Both of them could barely breathe and had to gasp sharply whenever their mouths separated just enough to let some air come between them. Tony opened his mouth to him and his tongue plunged into Steve’s mouth to claim it as his own. Steve was beginning to slide down the couch and soon found himself laying on his back. Tony’s chest was pressed into his and his knees stapled his hips. He did not mind in the least. He liked the feel of Tony on him as he raged his assault on Steve’s mouth.
Peter walked into the lab, smiling widely, and stated, “It works like a charm!”
Peter kissed him and then whispered, “That was amazing.”
Wade’s grin was almost feral and that giddiness Peter had felt tingled into a thrill that shot down Peter’s spine with the velocity of a firework.
Steve stared at the ceiling, afraid to meet Tony’s eyes. He strangled the sheets beneath his grasp.
But was this really what his life was going to amount to?
Days since his waking, when the Americans finally arrived, it was almost like someone had declared it was the Fourth of July. The entire camp was bustling and everyone wanted to watch the ‘Sno-Cat’ as it approached, kicking up mounds of dirt and snow. The Sno-Cat was a dark orange vehicle with the same tracks as a tank and a huge, bulky, square body on top.
They both were sitting in the van waiting for them. Sam was in the driver’s seat and Tony was furiously tapping away on his laptop. Both of their tech armor was tucked away in the back where no one could see it as they drove.
“Yes, Natasha. I want to know,” Steve whispered, the tone of her voice making him slightly apprehensive.
Steve fell onto Tony with a light huff of a laugh but then pressed his elbows into the pillows on either side of Tony’s head and lowered his kiss more gently upon him.
So he rolled around aroused and restlessly with his hips involuntarily humping the air, looking for relief. He knew most of the images and actions his mind supplied would never happen but the ones he knew possible made his cock twitch. Namely, that they were probably going to kiss.
do that to Steve.”
Tony was different. He cared for Steve. He
It was midday and, even though Tony was feeling groggy from watching over Steve, he knew he would not get a moment’s rest until he saw the blue of Steve’s eyes again.
He didn’t want to give it to Eddie. He shouldn’t have to hand it over to Eddie. He could keep it. He could refuse Eddie. Even better,
“Replusor blast times infinity!!” Peter yelled and the tiny Iron Man’s fist glowed then punched the tiny Thor. The tiny Thor spun and hit the other toy with its hammer. The Iron Man hit the ground with a resounding crash.
amazing.”
As more oxygen got into his blood, he was able to think clearer and Steve started to remember what had happened. Peter…Venom…Mary…they all came back to him and, in his last moments, he remembered a second of pain and then nothing…
“No, but…” Steve paused not knowing how to voice his feelings. It drew Tony’s eyes back to his.
Pepper and Rhodey silently bickered how to put the projector together as Tony stared down at the model. His feelings for his father were a confused mess as he regarded the model. His father had done this for Tony, half of his notebook was dedicated to Tony.
In all of his relationships, he’d never had been affected as much as he was now. Not even when he lost his virginity from a man who pretended not to know him the next day…
Steve stared at the glowing orb and memories from his time in Norway came trickling back to him. He remembered hearing stories from the locals about the midnight sun. Parts of the world, close to the North Pole, had months of continuous sun. How north was he?
“I know…”
Steve shrugged and pressed a quick kiss onto Tony’s lips before rushing over to save the scrambled eggs.
Venom was dripping off Peter like water, revealing countless punctures and red,
In the lab, the boys hovered beneath the suit in its glass case. Harry was jumping up and down and Peter was excitedly pointing out parts of the suit and explaining what did what.
Steve shook his head and said, “It’s a long story on my part and probably an equally long one on yours how I ended up here. I just need to know two things.” Steve bit his lip nervously and asked the most frightening, “Is this – me being awake…is it temporary?”
Tony had to stop as he gasped shallowly. He pictured Peter screaming and burning under his hands. It broke his heart and Tony sobbed, “This might save Steve but I-I know this-this could kill – this could kill my son.”
Steve smiled warmly at him and whispered, “You can’t stay here all night.”
“In fact,” Tony added, hands pulling at Steve’s shirt. “You shouldn’t be wearing clothes right now.”
“…No, Peter,” she replied. “But he is more of a father in the five years he raised you than that man would be in a lifetime.”
“Sam has everything to do with this,” Tony stated, his frown growing deeper and his eyes adverted to the side.
Bucky was clapping along with the beat and whooping for Steve and encouraging him through his poor dance moves. Steve kept stumbling into Dum Dum and tripping over his own feet. It was quite a sight seeing such a large man have such wobbly limbs. Tony smiled despite himself. Steve’s clumsiness was endearing.
“Or woman,” Tony agreed without missing a beat.
His uncle’s expression became stony but the pain remained in his eyes. He murmured, “Excuse me…” And turned back to the elevator.
Wade raised his arm and then hesitated for all of three seconds before taking off his mask. He rubbed at his scalp as if to fix his imaginary hair and his blue eyes regarded Peter self-consciously.
“The ‘Look at Natasha’s belly I want another baby too’ look,” Tony replied, closing the grill cover. The last of the hot dogs were out and sitting on the plate beside the grill.
Steve dug his fingers deep into Tony's flesh, pulling them flush together, as he stated, “But this…I don’t need to adjust to this. We’re back together like nothing happened.”
Peter thought of the crumpled card in his bedroom again and he clenched the newspaper tightly between his fists.
Steve pursed his lips but then nodded and murmured, “Three days.”
Btw, I wrote a really fluffy scene that I was unable to squeeze into this chapter, it will appear next chapter, but I will be (eventually) posting a part of it on my
Peter chuckled and was looking at his friend in a new light. He replied, “No, this is alright.” He took another drink and decided, “You can even keep flirting with me.”
Steve ignored Agent Hill and ran straight to Coulson and embraced his friend tightly.
Steve paused with the blade stopping at the tip of his chin. He pulled the blade away and wiped away the excess cream before replying, “It…It's not real…more of a joke between us because of a silly rumor that was started at basic...do people really think it was real in the future?”
“Tony –,” Steve gasped, reaching for him.
Logan punched him lightly in the arm and grumbled, “All this serious and lovey dovey talk coming from you is weird.”
SI Online was an instant success. Soulmates were meting years before their original times and Tony was praised for his program. He turned from a rich nobody who’d inherited his father’s company to one of the most celebrated people on the planet. He was made Time Magazine’s Man of the Year and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, but none of that mattered to Tony…
“Be that as it may,” Natasha gritted. “Coulson is going to put you on babysitting duty. It is up to him whether or not you are watching the President or Barnes.”
James launched himself at her and grabbed her throat with both of his hands. His grip was crushing as he exerted his full strength. His face was ugly and pinched as he hissed to her one single word:
“Be back by 9,” Tony stated.
“Betrayed by my own boyfriend!” Tony gasped. Steve rolled his eyes at Tony then moved on to the next present.
“Where are my boys, Friday?” Tony asked his phone.
“Could it have been a stray bullet?” Steve asked breathlessly. This
“It’s okay, Peter,” his mom cajoled.
A beat of frustration rolled through Steve but he did not let it show. Instead, Steve clapped Bucky’s arm and said, “Thanks, Buck…We got any POW’s here?”
Peter shot his webshooter at the opposite building and swung away, breaking their kiss. Wade grinned and waved wildly as he flew away.
Why was he with that psychopath??
“Phil? His first name is ‘Agent,’” Stark haughtily corrected her.
Peter was still staring at the beaker but, with Eddie’s statement, his eyes widened drastically. It
“Yeah, yeah,” Bucky mumbled, knocking Steve’s hand off his neck. He teased, “Aren’t I supposed to be the one who does the nagging?”
“You know I was kidnapped by terrorists and it was when I created the first Iron Man suit,” Tony gasped against his shoulder. Peter shifted to escape Tony’s hold but Tony tightened his arms around him. Peter could have easily escaped, he must have been ten-times stronger than Tony, but instead he slumped into his hold and listened to him.
“Tony-,” Bruce gasped, his voice full of concern. “Are-Are you serious? Do you really have a son?”
It’d also been even longer since he last felt this urge to want to make someone laugh like Steve did as they danced.
was the one who could not truly love all of you.”
”In this future...” He paused, considering his next words. He couldn’t reveal too much or he might clue them into their deaths. He slowly continued, “In this future, Steve is thought dead but was really captured by Hydra and...” He gulped dryly as he imagined it and he met Steve’s eyes as he whispered to him, “They torture you...for years...they break you and make you their agent.”
“I want to get to know you better,” Peter agreed. He reached over and grasped Wade’s arm. He was glad for the mask as it hid his flush and he whispered, “My knowing you better will definitely make this more serious…But, if this is too fast or soon, you don’t have to…”
He turned off the phone before Jarvis could reply and grinned at Steve.
Peter really only noticed the difference when he left their workstation to collect materials. The others openly stared at him, making Peter feel like he was being singled out and examined like one of the samples he would stare at on his petri dish.
“We’ll go down to the tourist level of the Tower first,” Eddie murmured, his thoughts still with the experiment. “It’s the weekend so it should be plenty busy and we can monitor Venom with the crowd. Though… we need to get you some kind of disguise because as soon as people find out you’re Peter Parker they’ll be swarming all ov-…”
“I love you, beloved,” Tony whispered.
He bowed his head and pressed it into Tony’s chest. Just saying the words aloud were too horrible to speak, he couldn’t imagine if he really had to face a world where it was true.
Bucky continued in a whisper, “It got so bad that I began to imagine your inevitable death. It tore my soul to just envision my life without you. I prayed all night to God that he would save you.” Bucky paused and ran both his thumbs over the top of Steve’s hand, tracing the bones beneath. He whispered, “It was in that moment, I realized how much you meant to me. I realized how much I loved you…”
. And he wanted to know that his boyfriend and father could coexist and maybe even like each other. He wanted to know that what he thought impossible was now possible…but mostly, he must’ve wanted to know if this was really happening.
Tony chuckled, “You sound like Pepper.”
The building had been abandoned and, by the plant growth and decay, it had obviously been years since it last saw any human activity. The halls were dark and dusty and, wherever there was sunlight, there were plants growing out of the floors. The first few rooms he came across were mostly empty with the only signs of life being the paw prints of mostly rodents in the thick dust.
Steve wanted to so badly lie to Tony. He’d never done so before but…but this was a truth that he’d been hiding for so long…too long.
“The kid’s a squirt in my mind and will remain a squirt until the day I die,” Bucky countered. Tony nodded, agreeing with the Winter Soldier for once.
“CONGRATULATIONS!” Thor exclaimed, making Steve and Peter jump in surprise. Thor swooped in and grasped Peter’s shoulders. He stated proudly, “You are one step closer to becoming a man and a great warrior like your father! Revel in this celebration, my young friend! And may it be the first of many grand events to come throughout your lifetime!”
Tony smirked down at his lover and his reaction to the warming lube. Tony usually did not use them but he wanted to surprise the super soldier and surprise he did. They switched places so Steve was the one laying on the mattress and Tony was the one above him. Tony wanted to take the lead in introducing Steve to lubricant for the first time and his fiancé had excitedly jumped at the chance.
Tony coughed then sarcastically said, “Oh baby, call me that again.”
“That was actually why I came here. I couldn’t really talk to you about it because I was wondering how’d you like to join us on the patrol but Howard was here. Do you want to go as an ordinary soldier? Or Iron Man?”
The Red Skull stepped up to him and punched him in the gut, knocking all of the air out of his lungs. Steve gasped for breath and Schmidt stated, “The first step in destroying you is breaking your will. You will do as I command or I will hurt you…Say it.”
“You want me to put the hammer down?!”
“Oh my God,” Peter laughed.
Wade squeezed him lightly across the waist and murmured, “Shhh. No, it’s okay, Peter. I knew this going into the relationship. And, seriously, I don’t mind stopping, especially if you’re the end result." He practically purred the last bit and tightened his arms around Peter's waist. He continued, "But I’m still going to do mercenary work. It's how I make a living and I can't change that. I am willing to downgrade myself to the B-list with no killing but I can make no promises about hurting people or the legalities of my business…”
He took off the glove on his left hand and she saw the real reason why he did not have the implant on his left arm. His left arm was not flesh but metal…robotic.
“I have Peter’s file and can check in with you two later but…I think you two will pass the background check,” the Social Worker said with a smirk.
. Tony felt his eyes heat up again and his lips tremble, making his smile waiver. He embraced Steve again to remind himself he was really there and to hide his face in order to regain composure as he was overcome with emotion.
Despite how much he hated it, he wanted him to continue.
“Last night was a one-time thing,” Steve replied uneasily. “And I’m not any of those things…”
After around three hours of walking he finally arrived in Brooklyn and where his old apartment once was. The building had been torn down and in its place was a laundromat. He had been hoping to see the old apartments retrofitted but he was sadly disappointed. He stared at the new building for a long time remembering his old life in the apartment he shared with his best friend who was now long dead…even though it felt like he’d lost him only a month prior. For a while, he doubted he was on the right street even though he had confirmed it twice already. The apartment was gone and with it another connection to the past…
“Is there a date set yet for the parent meet?”
“Yes, through that and bank records, medical history, voting patterns, emails, phone calls, your damn SAT scores: Zola’s algorithm evaluates people’s pasts to predict their future,” Sitwell stated and shakily got to his feet.
There was a small vibration in the floor as the bay doors opened for Steve’s ship. He wouldn’t have noticed it if he had been paying attention to it.
! The Avengers are needed. I will do what I can on this end.”
Next time, Ch. 9: The Soldier's Orders
“What is he talking about?? What was this other Tony looking for? What else was he going to say?” Tony demanded of his AI.
“I’m so glad you’re alright,” Steve professed, burying his face into Peter’s neck. Peter once again ignored his body’s aches and wound his arms around Steve’s large frame to return the much needed embrace.
The world moved on and, now that everyone knew Tony was Iron Man, they were all clamoring for a piece of his suit, the U.S. Military specifically.
Natasha rolled the inside of her cheek between her teeth and regarded the Soldier. His stance and expression told her nothing. He probably could kill her in an instant and wouldn't even bat an eye.
Captain Rogers dropped his head and asked, “At what cost?”
Bruce and Tony seemed to be having a similar silent conversation except Bruce wore one, very readable expression that could be promptly read as: “Are you shitting with me?” Tony’s answering, haughty expression was “Shut up!
Bucky, however, interceded for them.
“Happy birthday, Peter,” Bucky murmured. Steve stopped trying to keep the balloons off the floor and ran over to Bucky and Peter.
Steve clutched his chest, not wanting to even consider it as a possibility.
Steve knelt beside him and gasped, “What happened??” Looking at the battery, Steve gasped, “What are they doing to you??”
“Promise?” Steve asked, smirking a little to try and defuse the situation.
“No, wait," Peter said, grabbing onto Wade's arms as the man slipped away. He stated, "Wade, I seriously have no idea what that was all about but, I know what’s underneath that mask and the whole reason I planned this was just to see you: your smile, your eyes, and, yes, your skin.”
“Father, I can’t, you’ve done so much for me already!” Steve gasped.
The next time Tony was unconscious, it was only for a few seconds.
Wade stared at his boyfriend’s sleeping form, panting lightly as his accelerated heartbeat began to dwindle. His mind was still racing to catch up from the horrors of his nightmare and it took him a moment to disassociate the present from the impossible reality of his dark dreams. Peter leaving and not coming back was just a part of the dream…as was the monster that had stood by the bed.
…” He gasped her name like a reverent prayer. Why was she saying this? Was it her or…or did she talk to Steve?
Steve sighed heavily and shook his head. He put his hand over his mouth, mindful of the number of SHIELD operatives in the room that could read his lips, and whispered to his boyfriend, “I thought he was over Natasha but he clearly is not. I offered to be there for him but he told me to drop it. I think he feels like he owes me too much already…I wish I could help him without making him upset.”
“And everyone we loved would be there, including you,” Steve said, pointedly to Peter.
Probably because he was holding onto his father’s skin cream, the first thing he dreamed of was the broad stretch of his father’s back as he concentrated more on his work than Tony. His father’s taunt back loomed in front of him like a fearsome, impassable wall. Tony reached out to touch him but the man struck him away and hissed, “Not now, Tony! Later! We’ll have all the time we need in the future!”
It was not too hard to hide it from everyone, even Steve. The first year in their relationship, Tony said he had to go to California for business and Steve, his wonderfully trusting boyfriend, believed him. Leaving Tony to feel like more of an ass as he guzzled down his three bottles of vodka.
“That he is,” Jarvis replied. “I have yet to find anything pertinent on the man.”
There was a collective chuckle from the small gathering. Steve was so happy that Bucky’s barb went unnoticed. His best friend had become ordained as a surprise for their wedding. It felt right having him there. He had been there at the beginning of their relationship and it seemed right to have him there as they took the next big step.
Steve didn’t wait for him to come to a complete stop. He slid out of the car as it was slowing to a roll and went straight into the tent with Tony in his arms. There were already some soldiers laid out on small cots, groaning or biting their lips as the medics looked over them. Steve’s eyes quickly spanned the tent and then fell on his friend. He practically sprinted toward Gabe and called out, “Jones! I need your help!”
“Don’t,” Tony hissed. Steve froze and bit his lip. The acidic burn of discord began to burn in his stomach again.
“And what’s the age difference between you and my dad again?” Peter countered.
The corner of Tony’s mouth twitched and he glanced up to Steve, meeting his eyes, as he said, “Just call her Tyler. Or better yet, call her Tyler-the-Liar. That’s going to be our campaign slogan.”
“Pops…” Peter murmured embarrassedly.
Barnes’ eyes had been focused solely on her until that moment. He followed her gaze and looked at the rest of them as if he was surprised to see them. He neutralized his expression but Tony saw the flicker of horror in his eyes. He hadn’t known the Red Skull had once had Natasha,
He regarded Tony shamefully and whispered, “I’m sorry for everything that's happened. I don't want to lose your friendship but we need to-to sit down and talk about us. I can't lose you too, Tony. Especially over a petty squabble.”
“Buck, he’s Howard Stark’s son, he was in the suit,” Steve stated, slipping out of the bed.
“…I hope that when we wake in the morning this all turned out to be a long, horrible dream,” Steve whispered on a heavy but sleepy sigh. Tony buried his face into Steve’s back and blocked his vision.
Tony gave Bucky his space for the rest of the day. He caught up on his lost sleep and then cleaned up his workshop. Jarvis kept him updated on Bucky. Mostly, the man was researching his past. He just did it in various areas of the house like he couldn’t get settled.
I have left of my old life. Everything and everyone else is gone. If I..." Steve bit on his lip as his emotions threatened to spill over. "...I can't destroy myself entirely."
Steve thought back to the bullet Bucky had shot into the Tower. It was the only other instance Bucky had “communicated” with them…What he was trying to tell them Steve could only…He flushed. God it was so obvious now. He and Tony were making out on the couch they were one step away from tearing the rest of their clothes off each other but Bucky’s shot had deterred them. Bucky said he had been always watching Steve, had he been watching them? Was the shot a way for him to stop them?
He waited, waited for the familiar, sharp pain that’d burn through his torso as the shrapnel began to move with every beat of his heart.
“I was glad to,” Steve truthfully replied. “How was the Colonel? Is he going to comply with your request?”
Steve silently corrected Tony in his mind.
“Is Peter here?” Tony asked, afraid to hear the about Peter or what their relationship had evolved into… Did he even want to see Tony?
Tony wrapped both his arms around Steve and whispered, “None of this was your fault!
The feedings continued and Peter found himself being chipped away with every death.
Peter frowned and looked off to the side as he replied, “It’s alright. Are you okay?”
Peter sleepily rubbed at his eyes and murmured, “Okay, this is okay.” He looked to Wade and confirmed, “Is it okay?”
Steve looked down at Tony’s waist and was surprised to see he too was aroused. Feeling a little better, he uncrossed his legs and let out a relieved sigh. It
“Soon? Maybe you guys can provide your more
Tony broke eye contact and felt guilty…what was he doing? A few stolen kisses and he was already imagining cuddling with Steve? He needed to put a stop to this before the future changed for the worse again…
“…But there might be a way,” Mary whispered.
They both went home to the Tower with their ties undone, Peter sleeping on Tony’s shoulder, and Steve holding a box of leftovers from the reception. They both paused in the living room. The last time they had been there was before they were married but everything still felt the same.
Wade seemed a little taken aback and his face twitched a few times like he had a hard time settling on a feature. Finally, the big guy shyly grinned and murmured, “Okay, Sta – T-Tony.”
find him.”
Was he awake? Tony whispered, “Steve?”
“Only if you're ready,” was Wade's instant retort. He wanted Peter like crazy but there was no way he'd ever take advantage of him.
Tony broke from their kiss and murmured, “Great Scott…”
Steve laughed and said, “Wow, hello. Look at you? Aren’t you amazing?”
”I’ll be fine,” Steve assured him and then hefted the circular tub up and onto his shoulder and held it there with the support of one arm. The water sloshed gently but it was only filled half way so Steve would need to do some serious jumping in order for it to get too sloshy. The tubs were army regulated and were only big enough for someone to sit crossed-legged in and made of lightweight tin so he barely felt the weight as made his way back upstairs to his room. It was a glorified bucket and it’s weight was light enough that even a regular soldier could handle it on his own nonetheless a super soldier.
“I loved you too,” he gasped, his voice broken and fragile in ways she had never heard before.
Steve sighed heavily and, to Tony’s absolute surprise, pulled away from him.
Brock hadn’t been at his apartment so Tony illegally tracked his phone and saw he was at another apartment complex. A quick search of social media helped them determine it was his girlfriend’s apartment he was staying in, in New Jersey.
“Okay, that may be a little different,” Wade noted breathlessly as pleasure surged through his entire body.
Tony so desperately wanted to listen in but, at the same time, was worried that if he did Peter would start going off on him again and he did not want to hear that from his son's lips.
They were Russian.
Death caressed Wade’s cheek and felt his flesh grow cold and stiff. As soon as her boney touch left however warmth returned. She sighed heavily, clearly disheartened and crooned, “I was not here for your love but
Smiling warmly at Peter, Wade murmured, “One can only hope…”
, and you have a drive in you that defies logical inklings.”
“What are we going to do about this…” Steve murmured more to himself.
Peter looked up at Wade and said, “You’re going to meet my friends tonight.”
Tony sighed heavily and Steve shot his husband a reassuring smile.
“Shall I dim the lights, Sir?” Jarvis asked.
Steve lightly ran his hand over Tony’s arm and smiled to himself as he imagined such a life with Tony. They had yet to have a chance to really sit down and talk about the future but seeing Tony at his side and still sharing his bed years from now sounded…perfect.
And it all came to an end the night Obadiah betrayed Tony.
Wade never jumped out of his bed faster and ended up dragging Peter to the bathroom to get into the shower faster. Peter laughed all the way and didn’t stop until they were both in the tiny stall with their bodies pressed together and Wade was kissing him. The water was hot and steaming around them but, somehow, Peter’s tongue felt even hotter in his mouth.
Cable rolled his eyes and grumbled, “There are probably paradoxes out there where the time traveling never occurs or Stark never goes to the past and those realities are filled with much less stupidity and drama.”
“Ultron hijacked the media networks so everyone already heard his dastardly plan. And basically, the entire world knows you’re a damsel in distress now,” Wade teased.
Tony gulped but his throat was dry and bobbed uselessly. He gasped to his AI, “J-J, you look different from when I last saw you.
“Howard –,” she began earnestly.
“I'm sorry for overly worrying,” Wade sheepishly murmured and he squeezed Peter’s grip. He whispered, “You looked like you were on the brink of death when I first pulled you out and it scared the shit out of me…” Peter could see the fear reflected in Wade's gaze as he relived the moment. Wade closed his eyes and continued, “Especially when..." Wade paused and took a shuddering breath before whispering, "For a while there, I thought you were going to go somewhere I wouldn't be able to follow…I thought you were going to die...”
Steve played with Tony’s hair as his boyfriend slumbered. They were laying on the floor of his lab, propped up on some pillows they had pulled off the nearby couch. They were still naked since they had made love and Steve was thrumming with a loving afterglow from the sex.
He went to leave but paused and looked to Mary. She was created to bring about Venom but she did not know better and despite that she still gave him words of encouragement. He could not hold it against her. The one at fault was the Goblin. He asked her, “Are you in pain? Is there anything I can do for you?”
“You have no idea,” Tony sighed heavily. He turned his attention back to Steve and, now that they were alone, asked, “What did Phillips want? Are we moving out?”
Tony wanted the others to delay the detectives and get in their way to keep Steve out of their hands for as long as possible but Steve would have none of it.
Every time he used the armor, even to just charge it, the core was tested and then more and more poison was pushed into him.
Steve palmed his face with a groan and sarcastically mumbled, “Never mind, I don’t want to be in the real world…I’d have an aneurism by now with the things you do…”
Steve felt his jaw slacken as it all came together. Guilt hit him and he whispered, “You and Pepper broke up not long after that…”
or just pop in any time!
Tony stared at him incredulously and then finally hissed, “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.”
Peter did the one thing he could do…he called his father.
see someone casually. Tony
Tony strolled over to the west wall where he had shelves  of books and other items. He looked them over, feeling the weirdest sense of nostalgia. From there he asked her, “How long do you think we’ll be here?”
Harry’s mom died a few years after he was born. Harry confided that after she died his father was never the same. He could barely remember her but he missed her all the same.
Tony closed his eyes and Steve’s eyes opened so wide they were probably popping out of his head. He pulled Tony’s hand deeper into his chest as if he was trying to make him feel his love – make him feel the reason to stay with him. Because, if he – if closed his eyes, if he left – he would take Steve’s heart with him and Steve could not possibly go on.
Peter avoided his bad side and just crawled between him and Tony. He gave Steve a half hug and then turned to Tony and gave him one too. He then crawled back and sat cross legged between them at the foot of their combined beds.
Century, this would be
Ultimately, he just chalked it up to being another oddity of the future and closed his search on gay marriages. He opened the art app on the tablet and the last picture he had been sketching automatically opened. It was of Tony bent over his suit, making minute repairs. Steve stared at the image, taking in Tony’s muscle tone, and then flushed.
He parked outside of the workshop walking behind Tony. Once Tony unlocked the door, Steve went and sat on the couch and Dum-e immidetly brought him his favourite juice he thanked the robot and drank it slowly. Than his phone buzzed and he unlocked it.
“Yeah, Rogers pretty sure”
“Do you know how much money I have? I will do all that for free, I’m a very bored teenager. “
“Its fine,  thank you” Steve said getting out of the car.
“Oh yeah sorry, I guess what I’m trying to say is I love you Anthony Edward Stark, I’m in love you been have since that day my car broke down. And I just want you
Tony is way good of a guy for him. He was just Steve, plain Steve but Tony . Tony was perfect, he was funny, charismatic, insanely smart, and just a good person that Steve just loved with all his heart.
Because perfect life would be with Tony in his arms.
“Wait Tony” He stood up, and Tony turned around.
“So I think your car is okay now, he made trough the operation” Steve gave Tony a small smile. “Could you please turn in the engine”
“I need to tell you something, and like you don’t have to say it back or anything, I know you probably won’t because you know you are Tony Stark and I’m well me.
“Hey are you okay?” asked a voice behind him, Steve jumped a little surprised and slowly turned around. “I’m sorry didn’t mean to scare you.”
Steve got in the car and turned it on, a beautiful sound was heard and both Tony and Steve smiled at eachother.
He wasn’t only tired because of the work. Today was possibly one of the worst days in his life. It started okay, he was very tired in the morning but that was usual. But then he came to school and his girlfriend off 2 years broke up with him almost immediately saying how she was bored and she needed someone new. He was barely accepting that when he got his math test results, another F which meant that he was officially failing both math and chemistry which was great exactly what he needed in life and then on top of that he had the worst practice ever. He was close to dying, apparently the coach was in the bad mood because he had a fight with his wife so he decided to take out his anger on the kids. It wasn’t unusual but Steve wasn’t ready for that kind of practice.
“It’s fine, I’m over it” he said turning around and leaning over the car, Steve saw that Tony was definitely not over it but he didn’t want to push it. But the story also made him like Tony somehow, he couldn’t explain it. But he suddenly felt this sort of feeling toward Tony that he couldn’t really explained so he ignored it and went back to exploring.
Over the time their friend groups merged into one big group, and they were all done with their behaviour. But they couldn’t really force the boys to talk about their feelings, because Tony wasn’t really a feelings kind of person and Steve was convinced that he would never be good enough for Tony.
“I’m glad”
They walked in silence towards Steve’s car. Steve hated Howard Stark, that man was just evil. He was rude to his son and to anyone who didn’t have a lot of money in their bank account. He would always yell, was never grateful and would complain about Tony. Steve couldn’t understand why? Tony was perfect. He wanted to punch Howard so many times when he would see Tony with a bruise or with tears in his eyes. Tony had to stop him many times from basically tearing Howard apart and Steve wouldnt regret it. But he made Tony promise to stay away, because Tony said its nothing and he could handle it. But it still didn't make the situation any better.
to know its okay if yo—“ his words were once again interrupted by Tony, but this time by his lips.
Im not joking
“Do you mind  If I look around a bit?” he asked standing up, this was incredible and he couldn’t just sit.
“It’s okay, yeah I’m okay beside the fact that my girlfriend broke up with me, I haven’t slept normally in days and I’m officially failing math and chemistry and my car just broke down” he let out a defeated sigh, “but yeah I’m just peachy.” he didn’t know why he just vented to a stranger but he felt like he would explode if he didn’t.
He stopped in front of the car leaning down, looking at it with look of concentration on his face. So Steve took the opportunity to look at him. Tony was wearing black high tops, black skinny jeans and an oversized hoodie, he looked really good even covered from head to toe. Steve was bi, he accepted that in his eight grade no one really knew expect his mom and his best friends Bucky and Natasha but that was enough and he never really had feelings for a boy expect for in eight grade when he fell in love with his friend Josh, but sence then he never felt any romantic feelings for a boy sure he loved watching them and he found a lot of them cute but he never had a crush on one again he ran after girls mostly.
He turns around to find a circle-shaped portal, one which his twin has just walked through.
destructive force behind it, and that he really should be smarter about this, as intriguing as it would be to find out what was different about Steve (and Tony himself, for that matter) in this reality, different enough for Steve to be worthy.
Steve’s eyebrows burrow a little and it’s clear he’s confused. Tony’s just as confused himself.
The pace Steve turns bright red can’t be healthy. ”Yeah, okay, we’re leaving,” 2012-Tony says, pointedly giving an unimpressed look at 2023-Tony. He just grins smugly, making Tony roll his eyes. ”Shut up,” he mutters under his breath and lets himself be dragged back to his own reality.
”W-What?” he crooks, and Jarvis answers him calmly as always with the pictures of the model. Tony eyes it, still unable to believe what he’s seeing. ”And… And the laws of thermodynamics apply?” ”The amount of entropy remains stable, sir.”
, to his face and that’s too much.
How do you even tell anyone about something like this? How to ease something like this into a conversation naturally without immediately sounding like he was trying to boast?
Still shaking his head he makes his way to the staircase leading to his lab, breathing in and out deeply and trying to send his guts the message that they wouldn’t be getting any that night, despite the lovely date and clear sexual tension between them. Steve isn’t ready, and Tony respects that. He’ll wait as long as he needs to. Hell, his impatience wasn’t even about sex at all (like the shoulder leaning -incident before had proved), he just wishes they could move on from the first phase of a new relationship to the next.
Tony opens his eyes confusedly. He has kissed Steve enough times to recognize his lips, but it can’t be him. There’s something scratching Tony’s lower lip, almost as if-
”…Our kids?”
Now Tony looks almost insulted as he finally lets go of his middle, prompting Steve to take a step back. ”Seriously, Steve, what are you on about?” His face, however, relaxes immediately after saying that. ”Oh, were they that impossible this morning? I know how it can be, if Harvey and Peter really get into it it’s such a pain in the ass to try to-”
who’s objectively the most handsome man Tony has ever seen, and not just handsome but insanely hot, too, and it’s taking a toll on Tony’s heart to be constantly so turned on. That isn’t Steve’s problem in the slightest, of course, but it isn’t like Tony can just turn it off either.
Finally, he speaks again but the words come out slowly and he, in turn, takes a step back. ”You’re not my husband.” Steve lets out a breath. ”…No, I’m not. We’ve been dating for like, six weeks, Tony. I am not your husband.” Tony doesn’t seem to listen, he just stares intently into his eyes.
Tony’s spinning in his chair, his mind rather far away from the work at his point as his AI makes the calculations. This is a long shot anyway, there was no way-
Maybe it isn’t traditional or as romantic as the exciting atmosphere the city has in the weekends, but it works for them for now; Steve doesn’t have schedules on Mondays since he usually works the weekends, flying around the world preventing crime with Clint and Natasha, and Tony has talked Pepper into organizing his goings so that he’s always free too. It was fairly easy to organize, and certainly a reasonable request when it came to Tony’s occasional whims, leaving Pepper as pleased as he was.
This can’t be real.
”When does the beard debut?” Steve stares at him for a moment longer before losing it and starting to laugh. Tony smiles at the visual - Steve is the most beautiful when he laughs freely like that. And being the one to make him laugh…
Mondays are their date nights.
He plays around with random ideas well into the am-hours. When he catches himself yawning, it makes him check the time: half past two. It isn’t even remotely late in his standards but he decides he’s done for the night anyway, not having made any remarkable progress in the last hour or so.
Steve Rogers. With a beard.
Shaved? Of course, is it really that surprising, he has kept his face clean the whole time he’s been on this century. And when has he ever told Tony to go to sleep? He respects his privacy, wouldn’t just barge into his workshop like that if Tony was sleeping. Yeah, he has mentioned it few times that it would do him good to sleep more and in a more comfortable space but he has never- Come to bed? Not go to bed?! What was that about? Wh-
Except that it isn’t Steve. Cause the man who has his hands on the bed both sides of Tony’s head, and is kissing him, and talking to him like he was supposed to know what it was about, has a beard.
Steve doesn’t say anything for a while and Tony can only pray that he believes him cause he has no idea if the suits will answer his call in this reality, and if Steve decides to start to hit things, for example his head, with the hammer, it’s not going to be pretty.
They do look like a fun gang. They look like a happy family.
Before he has a chance to decide on which it is, Steve coughs and takes a careful step towards him. Tony instantly opens his hands a little, making his body language as encouraging as possible as Steve takes another step and is completely in his space now.
”Of course he will. If this was my reality I’d do anything at all to come back, trust me.” Steve turns to look at him and a little smile makes its way to his lips.
”Steve, my darling,” Tony interrupts his train of thought again as he takes his hands to his. His voice is warm and he’s speaking slowly, like he fears Steve is not in a condition to understand. ”We have been married for seven years. We have three children. Harvey, Peter and Morgan. Remember them?” he says with his face a mixture of worry that he tries to hide as amusement.
Attempting to clear his head he slaps his cheeks lightly and blows off some air before stretching his hands over his head. ”Jarvis, give me the tesseract blueprints again.” ”At once, sir.”
He takes careful steps towards him and sits on the couch too, not too close though; from years and years of experience of Steve he knows he sometimes needs his space. ”If you wanna talk about it, about anything… I know I’m not probably your ideal person to talk to, especially right now, but then again I’m a good listener.” Steve shoots him a look and Tony sighs. ”… I am though, maybe not yet where you’re at
Steve bites his lips together, clearly amused by Tony’s nervous rambling, and that makes Tony feel at least a little better. ”Well, I’ll just head up by myself then. Good night and thanks again for tonight.” Tony coughs, trying to regain his composure as he gives a what he hopes to be a casual salute.
Steve lets out a stressed laugh. It’s too early for this.
but it’s clear he’s exaggerating. ”Some days more than others,” he settles on, but Steve knows he’s just pleased of Steve’s observation.
He jumps up too and in turn cups his own face and then points both of them to the hammer in his hand. ”Since when?!” is all he manages to crook out, and Steve lift an eyebrow, clearly surprised that this is where Tony’s concern lays even when he’s familiar with the hammer’s concept — and therefore, with the power it holds.
Steve lays his hands carefully to Tony’s waist, the touch uncertain before leaning to peck his lips lightly. Tony leans into it but his hands are sandwiched between them a bit awkwardly, landing on Steve’s biceps and creating an angle where he has to actually lean a bit back to land the taller man’s lips. Meanwhile Steve has clearly misunderstood Tony’s weird posture as a silent request to pull back and while he does just that they somehow manage to bump their noses together in a very non-romantic way.
Once he’s gone Tony brings his hands to his face. ”I’d offer you a ride?!” he mutters to himself under his breath, ”what the hell was that?” Like Steve wasn’t scared enough of some of this stuff without him making it weirder in every turn.
It’s silent for a moment before the woman speaks again. ”Harvey Stark-Rogers is an adoptive son of Anthony and Steven Stark-Rogers. He was saved from an orphanage fire during a mission little over six years ago by Captain America and has lived with his new parents ever since. He’s an older brother to Pet- Sir, your heart rate is going dangerously up. Should I call for aid?”
”Since when what?” ”You’ve been able to operate that thing?!” Steve looks down to the weapon of a demigod in his hand and shrugs. ”Since I woke up from the ice? What do you know about it? Are you questioning
he hisses at himself in his mind,
”You are a wonderful father, Tony,” Steve repeats, ”you never lose your patience with them. You’re always there for them. Just like you’re there for me, cause somehow you manage to be both an amazing dad but an amazing husband too.” Tony honest to god blushes, and wow, he can’t remember the last time that happened.
. You’ve told me as much yourself.” Steve doesn’t have the energy to react to what’s clearly meant as something to lighten the mood.
He sighs as he enters the workshop, sitting down in front of his desk. Time for some engineering to get his mind off Steve’s ass. He does it so frequently nowadays he could probably start calling it a hobby at this point.
It’s a nice picture.
He puts the folder down and picks up the one that was leaning against the first one in the shelf, but this time the shock factor comes in with the very first page.
”FRIDAY, give me yesterday’s log.” Steve frowns. ”Tony, it’s Tuesday, did you hit your head or-” ”Oh, right! 2012,” Tony suddenly talks over him, drumming his finger anxiously against the table and making Steve snap his lips closed. He has no idea what’s going on but that didn’t make him like Tony’s habit of interrupting everyone when he’s in the zone any more likable for him. He’s just about to voice his annoyance but this time Tony stops him before he can even start. ”Jarvis, give me yesterday’s security tape from this room.”
”Jarvis… Jarvis is a person now?” ”He is, indeed, now his own person by the name Vision Maximoff. You saw him just last weekend for Harvey’s 10th birthday party. Are you okay, sir?” Tony runs his hand over his face before blinking a couple of times. ”Yeah. Yeah, I’m completely fine, thanks for asking. Just one more question, Friday, was it? Who the hell is Harvey?”
Steve has put his arms around his neck and Tony automatically puts his own to his back, moaning as Steve moves in his lap. The super soldier smiles into the kiss and pushes Tony to lay back on the couch, their lips never parting. Tony has trouble keeping up with him. This Steve is so eager and willing, pushy even, and Tony absolutely loves it.
”Tony, what are you talking about?” Tony pulls away a little to get a better look at his face but still holding his waist. ”Are you okay, honey?” Steve lets out a noise somewhere between a gasp and a slightly hysterical snort. ”Are you?! We don’t have kids!”
Steve pulls away from the hug and Tony is fully prepared to say one of his trademark snarky comments, has one on just the tip of his tongue when Steve leans to kiss him, too, completely catching him off-guard. He makes a surprised yelp but instantly puts his hands to Steve’s shoulders, not letting him pull away instantly like the last time. Steve doesn’t seem to mind.
In a sudden epiphany Tony realizes that those are qualities usually attached to him. Could it be so that he had actually been a good influence on Steve? Made him happier, more relaxed and more content? The thought sent butterflies down Tony’s spine.
That makes Steve smile a little. He feels a lot better already, and even though the thought is still slightly mortifying, he knows what this Tony is saying makes sense and is true. This wise, brilliant man that has all the best qualities of his Tony and then some more. He can only hope the Steve in his universe is as good for this Tony as he is for him.
He turns his gaze back to Tony’s whose still looking at him. The look on his eyes isn’t pressing but encouraging, even though Steve still feels silly talking to this man, especially opening up to him, there’s something in that look that nudges him over the line he has drawn in his mind to protect himself, to protect others.
He starts to chop the banana, humming some radio hit stuck in his head for days now under his breath as he suddenly feels hands on his hips.
”Hey, it’s alright,” Tony says and scoots a little closer still so that they’re sitting next to each other now but still a polite gap between their tights, ”it’s okay to be overwhelmed. It’s okay to be lost, it’s okay to not be okay. But you should really talk to someone about it. Biggest problems arise from keeping things to yourself, okay, it’s much worse than crying.” ”But I’m the team leader! I have to be there for everyone, I don’t wanna add to their emotional package ’cause I need so much help just getting the laundry machine going!”
Tony’s having an amazing dream.
”Tony, listen to me,” Steve interrupts him, hands in front of himself like he’s afraid Tony will near him again, ”I really, really like you, and I think this has been going really well, but we have been dating for few weeks. If this is some Tony-esque way of telling me you want to… I don’t even know, get more serious, or actually have kids? I’m just not ready, I’m sorry if this is going too slowly for you but I thought-” It hurts to think Tony doesn’t have the patience for him to work things out, but he can’t really call him out for it, either. ”I’m just, not in the mood to even joke about this right now, Tony. I’m sorry.”
Tony turns towards the door to see not-Steve nearing with a worried look on his face. ”I’m fine, it’s just…” He’s cut off as Steve sits down to his lap, leaving him wide eyed and stunned and speechless but Steve acts like it isn’t a big deal (which it probably isn’t in this reality, then), just sits there like he had plopped himself to any part of the couch at all as he lifts his hand to his forehead. ”Your eyes look a bit sick but it doesn’t feel like you have fever.” Steve pouts as he speaks, he’s clearly worried for him, and Tony’s eyes are automatically drawn to the thick lips. He can’t help licking his own, getting Steve’s attention in turn.
”Jarvis hasn’t worked for you in years, sir.” A robotic female voice suddenly fills the room, making Tony almost jump out of his skin.
After Tony managed to calm down a bit (after rolling around in the bed and screaming into a pillow ’cause it smelled so much both like Steve and sex and that was definitely too much right now) he had sat up again and in a very, very calm and collected manner, thank you very much, asked Friday to first cancel the whatever meeting not-Steve was talking about (the other Tony would have to deal with the outcome of that, no doubt) and then ask her to call his husband himself. The one who had apparently just returned home.
The look on Tony’s eyes softens as he looks over at Steve’s completely lost expression. ”No, this is not a joke. I’m from 2023. And I’m guessing the Tony you know is stuck there, now. I’m sorry for the inconvenience.”
”You’re not making any sense.” ”I am though, kinda. That idiot we just watched there has meddled with something way out of his league and brought us all into this mess. Fuck, Steve’s gonna have my head for missing the date night, and I know he’ll blame me even though it’s all this idiots fault…”
”Yeah, okay, I think we’re done here. Thanks for working that out, by the way,” he says and points vaguely at the direction of the portal still rolling behind them. The other Tony smirks at him. ”No problem, kiddo. But please, for your own good, be more careful in the future.” Tony squints his eyes at him, not sure he was trying to make some dad-joke about their situation but it doesn’t really matter anyway, not when Steve’s lightly pulling his hand towards the portal and clearly more than ready to put this behind them.
There’s nothing Steve can do but nod dumbly, wondering what the hell his life has become.
Tony hasn’t even realized he’s hyperventilating before the AI points it out. He tries to sit up straighter and shake his head clear but it doesn’t help to make the situation any more coherent. ”Am I awake, not-Jarvis?” It’s silent for a while again, and Tony has no doubt that if a robotic voice could sound concerned, this would be it. ”Yes, mister Stark. You were woken up 37 minutes ago by your husband.”
of sex during that vacation, but something in his eyes seems different in a very beautiful way. It makes Tony smile, even if it isn’t really his Steve.
”What year is it?” Steve is exasperated. ”2012?” Tony’s eyes widen. ”Shit,” is all he mutters before he turns around and runs for the stairs leading to the workshop. Steve tries calling his name after him, getting really worried now, and has now idea but to run after him to make sure he doesn’t hurt himself.
”You really are Tony, aren’t you?”
Tony stares at him, eyes very much focused on the said lips. He’s super, super weirded out but also kinda intrigued. ”Well,” he starts carefully, getting Steve to pay attention to him again, ”if you really wanted to, I guess it wouldn’t
It’s quiet for a while, both of them deep in thought for a while, before Steve speaks up again. ”Oh, SHIELD did turn out to be a undercover Hydra organization, that was kind of a big one.” ”What?!” ”Yeah. Who could’ve seen that coming, right? But even that wasn’t that hard to deal with once we found out, we’re a great team and when we work together good things happen.” Tony could only nod dumbly.
Mister Stark didn’t provide an answer. He isn’t sure if he wants to know the wether. He doesn’t know anything at all that moment except that he has to suddenly lay down again.
Tony lays there for good ten minutes, just blinking with a blank face and staring to the ceiling, before he realizes there’s something in his ring finger.
”Oh that fool…” Tony mutters something under his breath and shakes his head lightly, ”that absolute fucking moron.” Steve turns to glance at the screen and finds it to be just Tony being Tony, talking about something Steve doesn’t understand with the AI as he designs some thing or another. He doesn’t understand Tony’s hard stance on himself. ”Tony. I’m about to call SHIELD to send someone to take a medical check on you, and I need you to be nice once they arrive.”
”Am I a good father, Steve?” Uneasiness tries to strangle his insides as Steve shakes his head in surprise and let out a strangled laugh. ”Tony,” he says and turns so that he’s completely facing him now, looking almost insulted by the question, ”you are an amazing father.” Tony let’s out a shuddering breath, one he didn’t realize he was holding.
He’s still staring at the man looming over him with wide eyes. The not-Steve giggles. ”I must’ve woken you up from deep sleep. How are you so cute this early in the morning?” Yep, that seals the deal. No way would Steve call him cute, at least without turning ten different shades of red in the process. This is some kind of a simulation. Or a fever dream. Or maybe Loki?
Instinctively he flinches from the hold and turns around, only to find Tony standing there with his hands up in surrender, an amused look on his face. ”Oh, did I scare you? I’m sorry, baby.” He brings his hands back to the blond’s hipbones as he speaks, smirk on his lips, and Steve feels lightheaded as all the blood from his brain is now giving his face a red cover. He’s so out of it that he doesn’t react in any way as Tony plants his lips to his and kisses him deeply.
Tony sees that Steve has calmed down and that makes him smile even wider. ”There you go,” he says and puts his arm around Steve to pat his shoulder. Almost unconsciously Steve leans to him slightly, prompting Tony to leave his hand around him. ”There you go,” he says again, ”hug it out. That’s what I tell my sons every time they fight over something dumb.” Steve huffs out a laugh.
”It suits you.” Steve looks smug as he grins. ”Oh, I know. Tony has made sure I know just how much he thinks it suits me.” Tony squints his eyes and sighs. ”I’m gonna call you thirsty-Steve from now on, just so you’ll know.” Steve just shrugs again with a wide smile, about to answer with something cocky, probably, when a sudden blow of wind surprises Tony.
As if he had forgotten he was there his eyes suddenly widen and he finally holds the eye-contact. ”Right, wait, first things first. I’m so sorry I groped you in the kitchen. I thought you were my husband, since you look exactly like him and were in the kitchen of our home but still, unacceptable.” Steve’s mouth falls open in frustration. ”Tony, for the last time, I’m not your husband!” ”I know! That’s exactly what I’m saying. But I’m not Tony either. Well, I am, but not your Tony.” Steve is starting to think he’s the one who’s mind is playing tricks on him, after all.
Tony furrow his eyebrows. ”I’ve never heard of her, which probably means that hasn’t happened in my reality. I should probably call Fury.” ”Yeah, you probably should. Anyway, after that things chilled down really nicely here. There were only dumb humans to deal with instead of aliens. So we ended up having quite a lot of free time. Tony and me had kinda had this sexual tension before that, already, and one thing led to another and…”
and demigods and men flying in iron suits when it comes to stuff to come in terms with.
So he pulls away from the kiss and puts his hands to Steve’s shoulders. Steve pulls away immediately, and Tony’s heart clenches when he sees the lost look on the blonde’s face. ”Wait, did I misunderstand? I’m sorry-” ”I’m not who you think I am.”
There’s a photo folder around his eye-height which draws his attention. He reaches for it and it feels weirdly real. He doesn’t let it bother himself as he opens the book. His breath is caught in his throat from the first page, already; it’s a picture of him and Steve, taken by the latter. Tony himself is kissing his cheek and Steve’s clearly laughing.
, he muses.
”Model created successfully.”
Tony almost falls from his spinning chair.
”Jarvis, are you familiar with quantum physics?” ”Very much so, sir.” ”Good. Hit me with Foster’s formula’s section six, matter’s energy output and exchange sub-model and then add in the mix Banner’s calculations from the New Mexico numbers compared to the ones from New York. Unite them and then put them into works with an arc reactor engine.”
“Well common I’m all finished we can go”
It was a comet
“Yeah, but I like Rogers better, and anyway you could give me your number?”
“Hey Sorry I’m late” Steve said once he saw Tony waiting for him in front of the school. “Bucky wanted to talk about something”
“Yeah I mean I love fixing stuff and right know I’m really bored so you are lucky guy Rogers, and like I’m kind of a genius so yeah I can tutor you math and chemistry if you want” Tony give him a small smile, and Steve was a bit shocked.
“Yeah sure no problem”
“Okay, well I can’t really help with the girlfriend problem or sleep, but I would suggest some coffee and maybe ice cream. But I can help with the car and your math and chemistry problem.”
“God, not you too.” he muttered quickly parking the car of the streets.
“Knock yourself out.” Tony said with a small smile, but quickly returning to Steve’s car.
He was pulled out of  his thoughts when his car started making weird noises.
whats the worst thing that can happen?
Tony took the phone not liking it, because he really didn’t trust when people  hand him things but he kind of trusted Steve in a weird way. He putted his number in and handed him his phone back.
He got out of the car opening the hood when he was hit with a lot of smoke. He swore loudly, punching his car with his leg. Anger was slowly starting to build in him. He could walk home but he was way to tired and he lived way to far away. And he also had no money for cab and the bus was long gone.
