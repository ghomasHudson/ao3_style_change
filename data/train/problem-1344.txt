He eventually noticed the other man’s not-so-discreet stare at him and inwardly cringed at the part in him that howled triumphantly that this particular Alpha had noticed him. Unfortunately, he was used to getting attention from other people. Although he tried his best to appear inconspicuous, dressing in simple dark colours, keeping his head down when he moved around campus, people still seemed to notice him. They kept addressing him in the library or seminars, asking him about his name or where he came from which only earned them irritated looks or if he was in a bad mood, an insult. He knew it wasn’t the smartest way if he wanted to keep his low profile but he just couldn’t help himself. People could be so annoying. Why were they asking him questions out of the blue? Why were they addressing him out of all people? He never gave them any reason to assume he was interested in any kind of interaction, so why so many people bothered trying to get to know him was beyond him.
Seeing her cold, dead body in the morgue had been quite a shock. Well, seeing a picture of her cold, dead body, because of course, as a silent partner he couldn’t possibly make an official trip there.
“Alright then, “she said, flustered. She quickly put the second tray on John’s nightstand and fled the room.
He nodded at the paramedic who first cleaned a spot on Sherlock’s exposed arm and then plunged the needle into his vein. John squeezed Sherlock’s hand a little more as his friend winced at the intrusion.
“Come on, John, “the voice he now recognized as Greg’s implored, breathing heavily, “calm down. Please. It’s over.”
Greg smirked at him, then he took a step forward. “Alright, Sherlock, we already know a few things because he had his wallet on him. This man is Maximilian Harrington, 43, divorced since last year, two children, works as a teacher in elementary school at Covent Garden, no criminal record. That’s all we’ve got but I’m sure you can enlighten us as to why he’s here and dead, so let’s hear it.”
“Oh no, Sherlock, no.” John dragged the arm away from Sherlock and cupped his chin, gently tugging at it so that he was looking at John.
He was observing the scene in front of them calmly, but Sherlock was sure he was ready to jump in the second it was necessary. The lady was the boss and he was hers to command.
A man was lying on top of him. He was rutting against Sherlock, groping him under his shirt and parting his legs with his thigh. Both of them were almost naked from the waist down, clad only in their underwear, their trousers crumpled in a heap at the side. The man’s face was buried in Sherlock’s neck and he was sucking viciously at the exposed pale flesh.
A tiny quiver at the corner of Sherlock’s lips told him his message had been received. Then the eyes closed again, and Sherlock’s head lolled to the side as he groaned in open discomfort.
A soft knock at the door made both of them look up. It was Greg Lestrade who stood in the doorway, looking a little embarrassed.
“The candy wrappers, John, “Sherlock had mumbled excitedly on the fourth day. “They weren't allowed any sweets, that’s why they always leave them behind on the bodies, it’s out of spite!”
The situation had taken him completely by surprise and for a moment he was unable to move, frozen in his place against the wall. His mind was racing with the possibilities and he was sure the Professor could detect his anxiety in his scent. He swallowed, forcing himself to display a neutral expression on his face as he considered what to do.
“Awfully interesting, “the taller Alpha in the elegant black coat was saying. John realized it was the one who had answered Magnussen’s question about Omegas, the one who the professor had called ‘’Mr. Trevor’. “Interesting to see you interested in Omega physiology like that. How come, Williams? You like pretty Omegas?”
When they came to the last table of their group, Scott explained their experiment with the moray eel poison in his smooth, sonorous voice. At the first words out of his full mouth, John’s heart leapt and his knees went weak. The way Scott talked, the way his body moved, fluid and effortless as he indicated the sample he was talking about, casually rendering his lab partner superfluous that way - it was incredibly impressive. He was made to be a scientist,  that much seemed obvious. But he also gave off the air of an artist, showing off his magic trick, seducing everyone with his witty elaborations. The fact that his pale blue eyes shone in sincere admiration for the animal’s dangerous defense mechanism added to the overall attractiveness of the Beta, as did the way he bit his lower lip when he paused to catch his breath.
“Jesus.” he ran a hand through his hair. “That’s terrible. Really. So I hope it’s not too indiscreet to ask, but...how did you get bonded?”
He caught his eye in the reflection and frowned when he saw that he was biting his lip again. Once again he looked at himself.
Sherlock scowled down at his friend who now made a puppy face at him and he couldn’t suppress the sigh escaping his mouth. He just couldn’t be angry with John.
John was completely out of his depths. “I – yes, he’s sick of me fussing over him, meddling with his life and also of me yelling at him. That’s why he doesn’t care that I’m here. I cannot really blame him, can I?”
“DON’T raise your voice to me, Mr. Williams, “Magnussen bellowed and Scott winced, “or I’ll have you thrown out of this class!”
Mycroft cleared his throat, sat down in John’s chair, and pulled out his phone, glancing at it while sipping his tea contentedly. Sherlock decided he was in the mood for tea and drank his, too.
“Hmm.” The Professor fixed him with an expressionless stare, the false smile gone from his thin lips. Sherlock found himself torn between pulling his eyes away from that sharklike stare and returning the man’s cold gaze in an unspoken challenge, ending up choosing the middle road by dropping his gaze and intermittently looking into the other man’s eyes. His heart was beating madly in his chest and he felt slightly nauseous, too.
She looked at him expectantly and he thought of lying to her, but he knew his face had betrayed him because suddenly she laughed out loud. “I was right then. That’s good to know.”
She didn’t seem perturbed by his silence. Smiling seductively, she began to circle the chair he was bound to.
“Yes.” Mycroft didn’t sound smug or condescending now, just matter-of-fact. “We have a few options on how to grapple the matter. My people are still not decided which course of action is the best, that’s why it will take some time. A matter such as serious as this needs to be done thoroughly, otherwise, all would be for naught. So please excuse me, I must ask you to stay put where you are for now and spend the night. I’ll make sure you’ll receive a proper dinner though, as well as some blankets, I wouldn’t want you to rest uncomfortably. Would that be agreeable to you?”
John smiled as he remembered the way Sherlock had almost lost it when they had finally found the killer’s hideout, somewhere in an abandoned warehouse in Southwark. He had been so enthusiastic about finding that telling stack of candy bars shoved into a corner that he had fallen on his knees, diving right into it with almost childish glee.
Sherlock gasped, his eyes widening in an increasing bout of panic. “I’m sorry, John. Please excuse me, it’s just….a little hard to breathe right now.”
“Well, still...you were gone so long, “Greg said with a shrug. “Didn’t seem like you were any interested in going back on that date with her.”
So he decided to give it some rest. He sat on the sofa – noticing a still busy Mycroft noticing him re-enter the living room in fresh clothes and wet curls – cross-legged and closed his eyes. After a few minutes of calm breathing – not even Mycroft’s low talking from the corner did disturb him now – he had already disappeared into the depths of his mind palace.
There would be tons of food, crowded rooms and loud people and of course, the presents. Sherlock had always been unable to hide when he didn’t like a present and as always, he was given stuff he didn’t like. Why was it so hard for his parents or anyone else in his family to understand that he didn’t need any toy cars, wooden or remote control, or in whichever form? He also wasn’t interested in toy soldiers, balls, or any kind of vehicle other boys his age loved to take for rides down their streets. Every Christmas mummy told him to behave like a good little boy and say thank you for every present he got. Every time it ended with him being scolded and sent to his room because he had scowled at whatever was given to him or even said out loud that he didn’t like it. He had explained to his parents countless times what he would love to get. He wanted a dog. It was as simple as that.
“Yes, well that was stupid of me and I will make sure it won’t happen again, “John replied through gritted teeth. Then, softer: “Please, Mycroft, I’m asking you nicely.”
“I am a complicated person, John. I would try to change, for you, but …. Eventually, I would forget what I promised you and just ruin everything again by … well, by being me, essentially.”
There had been a man. And he had dragged him off. Had touched him although Sherlock didn’t want him to.
Frustrated, but simultaneously delighted that at last there was a little challenge for him, Sherlock looked around the room once more. There had to be a way to open these drawers. There was no safe where they could have hidden any important documents, so they had to be in the drawers, but how to open them?
Mycroft smiled politely as he accepted the tea with a gracious little bow. “Nonsense, John, “he said matter-of-factly. “You don’t owe me anything. I’d also like to add that Mr. Taylor has been charged with drug-facilitated sexual assault. It has come to our attention that he had been charged with sexual assault before, three times, as a matter of fact, all in the last four years. Unfortunately, he’s never been convicted of those, the victims changed their minds every single time, the charges were dropped. But he’s not going to get away this time. Now, he is out of the hospital - there won’t be any permanent physical damage, by the way - awaiting his trial and the judge has denied bail. He will almost certainly get two to four years of prison.”
“Please, “he said softly, “he hates hospitals and after what happened to him, he needs to wake up somewhere he can feel safe, and that place is home.”
Sherlock took another deep breath and opened the bathroom door. John was right there, as expected, leaning against the opposite wall. He looked up when Sherlock came out, trying to appear casual and failing miserably. It was obvious that he had spent the entire time that Sherlock had been in the bathroom, fretting and fussing on his own.
He thought of the way Sherlock had clung to him when he had found him lying there on the grass in St. Edward’s park. Sherlock had been in a bad way, panicked, drugged, afraid … and he had called for John, he had looked to him for help. It had been the same when John had found him after the second assault.
John couldn’t see Scott’s face from his current angle but he could hear the suppressed anger in his voice. A smell of burned apples and almonds reached his nose and his own heart beat faster at the scent of another person in distress.
John told himself that it would be no big deal to him if Scott rejected him today. But still, he felt nauseous as they entered the lecture hall and when his eyes almost immediately found the pale young student in the first row, a surge of adrenaline shot through his body, making his heart pound in his chest like mad. He swallowed and looked to the ground, taking a deep breath to calm himself. Then he began walking down the stairs, trying not to trip over his feet in his nervousness.
Sherlock blanched a little, but he ignored her for once and only asked “Lestrade’s inside?” at which she nodded. But she followed behind him and she tried to lean into his side. “What? Did somebody not like what you deduced about them and reminded you to be polite for a change?” she sneered. Sherlock just blinked and said nothing.
“Easy, easy there tiger, “the unknown but familiar voice said and the owner of said voice squeezed his shoulder in obvious brotherly affection. “Let’s get you home, eh?”
“Come here, love, “he whispered, and he gently positioned Sherlock’s head on his chest. Sherlock moaned softly and shifted to his side, curling into himself. John started stroking his friend’s hair slowly, started making soothing noises so that Sherlock would finally fall asleep.
“Well, I should say, Mycroft, didn’t you tell me we were under surveillance? How could this happen, how could he just leave our flat and not be stopped or at least followed by one of your people?”
As soon as he left the room, his medical instinct kicked in and he quickly went into the bathroom they shared to grab everything he needed from his emergency cupboard. There he had stored quite an impressive stock of general medicine, something he had deemed necessary when one lived together with the famous detective Sherlock Holmes, prone to injuring himself while on a case.
He stepped forward, approaching a blonde girl in the first row, and leaned forward into her personal space, inclining his head towards her.
“Wha- wha’s happenin’?” Sherlock managed to croak out as he tried to resist the man’s strong grip, tried to stop him from dragging him away. “Who’re you? G-get off me.” His voice had returned for a few seconds, although his words slurred heavily now and barely sounded like real words. The other man’s only reaction was a gruff chuckle.
The officer motioned for John to sit down so he did, a nervous flutter spreading out in his stomach. The corner of his mouth twitched, his hands were clammy all of a sudden. Something felt off.
He was angry at himself. How could he sit here, and just ogle Sherlock as if there weren’t more important things to do, like comfort him for instance. Tell him that he was here for him now and that he would finally be alright, after all, that had happened.
So he made an effort to smile easily and leaned back in his chair. “It’s good that you kept a close eye on Sherlock, Frederic. It’s true, it’s a little disconcerting that he behaved like that. But I assure you, it’s probably nothing serious. He has done so in the past, he just does that sometimes.”
“Yes, John, “he said, words slurring ever so slightly, and he put a hand on his friend’s shoulder. “Everything’s fine, I’m just a little tired.”
If they were to try this, they would both be ‘virgins’, so to speak, and both of them would try this out for the first time, together.
He seldom went here. There was hardly a need to come. Sentimentality, in general, was not one of his traits and he often mocked people for indulging in it. Still, he had not deleted this part of his memories and he knew his own weakness was to blame.
Mike shot John a regretful look. They wouldn’t be lab partners like usual. John, however, was more concerned with the fact that he would share a workplace with Victor and Sebastian….as well as Scott.
Sherlock instinctively leaned into John’s touch and John’s eyes lit up in subtle, delighted surprise.
“It’s a pity I have to kill you now, “she said as she stood in front of him again. “It’s such a waste. The extraordinary mind. The outstanding cleverness, wits, and charm. The …. surprisingly nice body.”
Terror washed over him then like a tidal wave and he almost let out a sob. Suddenly aware of where he was, he caught himself at the last second and managed to stop the sound from escaping his throat, his hand flying to his mouth instinctively.
Mike chuckled and threw a book - the semester coursebook - into John’s lap. “Maybe it’s because I stuck to beer last night, instead of mixing it up with vodka and whiskey as you did. I know when to stop drinking, chap.”
shellfish and they quickly sorted out that John would apply the poison to the sample of human cells while Mason would take notes, observing the initial reaction to the toxin. Then both of them would take a look at the sample under the microscope and gather their results to discuss them with the others.
Was it really a good idea to stumble around aimlessly here trying to look for the needle in the haystack? But what else could he do?
Robert de Monier’s elegant fingers danced impatiently on the surface of his huge expensive Mahogany desk as he waited for his call to connect. He crossed his leg over the other one, wrinkling his face in disgust when he noticed how the motion caused his brand-new Armani suit trousers to wrinkle. How tedious. He would have to tell Sandra to take them to the dry cleaner’s later during his lunch break. He had an important meeting scheduled later that day and he always met business partners immaculately dressed.
Greg nodded as he looked at his watch. “Alright, I’ll grab lunch then and get back to the office. I’ll drop by later. See you.”
But maybe he wouldn’t remember anything by himself and that would be for the best. He could just hope it would turn out that way.
Sherlock was still shifting nervously. “I think so, I do. But ...I have to confess...I’m terrified, John. Terribly terrified.”
“You’re all looking at me like monkeys at the zoo. I realize that my workload is not what anyone would call ‘easy’ - he accentuated the word with quotation marks in the air, scoffing in disgust - “...but you’re no beginners. You’re fourth-semesters, I can expect some sort of proficiency here, can’t I?”
Sherlock would still be stubborn about not getting better. Maybe he would still be upset with John for yelling at him as he had at the hospital. As was his right.
Also, I'm afraid the next chapter could take a little while longer as I have a couple of important exams coming up next week and the week after that as well :(
“Same, “Sherlock agreed although he felt a little stupid repeating it, “great night.” And he chugged down the rest of his drink if only to make his friends cheer at him even louder.
He tried to ignore the feeling of disappointment and hurt eating away at him because of that. He tried to explain it with Sherlock’s complicated personality, that he was unused to confiding in someone, that he still had to learn how to trust someone like that. He, John, would have to show him how to do that. Or maybe he just had to let it go. Maybe he, John, had to trust Sherlock, that he was really fine and that he was dealing with it in his own way. Maybe returning to everyday business was medicine enough for Sherlock. He was strong. He had been right to reprove John for seeing him only as a poor victim.
Mycroft sighed once more, and John could practically picture him rolling his eyes in exasperation. “Sherlock depends on you, Dr. Watson. How can you not know that?”
Sherlock frowned again but apparently, he didn’t dare lie. “It hurts like hell, “he admitted quietly.
He cleared his throat awkwardly. Scott looked up at him then, his pale eyes wary, but he said nothing.
Sebastian just smirked at him. “No, but I’m sick of stupid whores. I’m in the mood for something different.”
“Th-thanks, John, “he murmured, then he softly but decisively pulled his hand away from John. There was silence as they looked at each other in wonder. As if each had learned something new about the other. It was nice somehow.
He remembered the way he had woken to John holding him in his arms after he had shot that woman. Despite the feeling of utter exhaustion and a pounding headache on top, he remembered the strangely uplifting sensation of being cradled in his best friend’s arms. His face had been full of concern and tenderness and it had been just what Sherlock had needed at that moment. Seeing John right then had pulled him back into reality, away from that overwhelming sense of dread and terror being alone in the room with that woman had made him feel.
Looking into those cold blue-green eyes again rendered John unable to speak again for a few seconds, but then his gaze hardened and his mouth was pressed into a thin line as he curtly shook his head.
“It’s alright, Sherlock, it’s me, John. Just take it easy.” John took Sherlock’s arm and pulled him up a little, as Sherlock’s eyes opened more widely trying to take in where he was.
“Of course, “he said, affection and compassion in his voice. He wanted Sherlock to know he always had his back. He knew it had cost him a lot to ask John for this, to swallow his pride like this and he appreciated it very much. Sherlock was impossibly brave, and John knew he could overcome this horrible incident if only he realized his own strength.
Again, Sherlock felt a huge wave of affection towards the man in front of him. The man whose eyes still sparkled dangerously when he spoke of Sherlock’s attacker, the man whose hands were clenched into fists, betraying the anger still burning in his veins when he remembered yesterday’s events.
Mycroft smiled a tight-lipped smile. “I know Dr. Watson. Please rest assured, my brother is in good hands.”
“Wait!” John shouted as he ran out of the building, barely catching a glimpse of the dark-haired student disappearing around the corner of the adjacent library.
He knew he needed more information, something was still missing. However, right now he just needed to make sure that Sherlock was alright. If he were in his mind palace, he had to rouse him and convince him to get some sleep instead. Sherlock seemed intent on making John happy right now so even if it was a little unfair, he needed to take advantage of his fragile state of mind. He would be doing it in favour of his health, after all.
Sherlock still needed to confront John with his theory. He needed concrete proof. He was rarely wrong, but this one time, he couldn’t rely on anything he didn’t know for a hundred percent to be the truth. His sanity seemed to depend on it.
He lifted himself up and carefully pressed his fingertips to Sherlock’s carotid artery, closing his eyes for a moment when he found his pulse, as expected, racing. He kept on counting as if that would somehow make the number change into something slower, while he fumbled for the thermometer from the bedside table. Sherlock didn’t react at all when the thermometer was shoved into his mouth and John immediately knew that was a bad sign.
at the beginning of May and spending almost six months writing this story (how could I not have found this incredible show sooner?!), it's finally done. Writing this has been extremely valuable to me: it has given me a safe place in these strange times and this terrible pandemic we are currently experiencing (especially during the three-month-lockdown). Thanks to everybody reading this, giving kudos, and especially to those who have commented. Your support has given me motivation, and it makes me incredibly happy to know that there are people out there reading and enjoying my story ❤️
And even though John knew he had only wanted the best for Sherlock, he knew he had not always handled matters in the best manner. He had hurt Sherlock by belittling him, calling him vulnerable for being inexperienced in sexual matters. He had pitied him.
They grabbed their jackets and made their way over campus to the huge Science Building where the party was being held. They paid the small entry fee, turned in their jackets, and went in. Inside, it was already packed with people, either dancing to the loud music in the middle of the room or standing at the side, holding drinks in their hands, chatting with each other. John and Mike slowly made their way towards the bar, aiming to get a drink first.
Mrs. Hudson raised her eyebrow. “What, you mean the great Sherlock Holmes made a mistake like that? Unbelievable!” And she turned towards Sherlock with the same mock confusion face as John at which Sherlock huffed indignantly, folding his hands in front of his chest, pouting.
Intrigued, John lay down on his cot, once again staring at the ceiling with his head resting on his arms behind him. But this time his mind was not weighed down with depression over being caught in a hopeless situation where a certain someone didn’t care if he was trapped in said situation. This time, his mind was racing through the events of the past few days, as well as those of the past few years, of his whole time with Sherlock.
Out of breath, he leaned against the bathroom’s door and turned to look at John. “Do you mind?” he asked sourly. John just nodded and took a step back. With a little effort, Sherlock shuffled into the bathroom and closed the door behind him.
John sat down on the sofa and took a sip from his coffee. Although it was not very good it tasted amazing to him and he felt a little more awake at once. He closed his eyes and massaged his temple with his fingers. Maybe he should take some paracetamol, for he had quite the headache.
“Alright students, that’s all for today, “Magnussen announced eventually. “Next time we’ll be conducting a few experiments to witness the effect toxicants have on human cells firsthand. Which is why we’ll not be meeting up here but in the laboratories in Building HC. You’ll be provided coats, goggles as well as gloves, so you don’t have to bring anything apart from the usual pen and paper. Class dismissed.”
And Greg whom he had rung as soon as he had told the driver the address. He didn’t exactly know the situation he was getting into and it was always good to have a backup. He had his gun with him because you never knew with Sherlock but having Greg with him was even better. He was driving here at the same time that John was, in his own car and they would meet at the agency.
He scrambled up from the couch so hastily he almost landed on the floor and he made his way downstairs to their landlady’s door, knocking on it with barely contained impatience as well as anger rising within him.
His heart pounded in his chest as he gripped the door handle hard, ready to be blown away by some new clue he desperately wished for. This had to be it. The answer he had searched for all along. The key to his relationship with John, everything he needed to know how to go on.
He leaned back, shaking John’s hand off in the process, and sat back, resolved to just ignore his friend’s delighted laughter – Greg had now joined in of course – and wait till it had passed. He closed his eyes because he suddenly felt terribly exhausted and maybe this was a good time to bid his still laughing so-called friends goodbye and go home.
Victor locked eyes with John, his dark brown eyes burning with fury, the heavy scent of gunpowder engulfing them as one Alpha considered what to do and the other patiently waited for his decision. Eventually, Victor snorted.
They lay there on the cold ground for a few minutes. After a while, they both calmed down, their breathing slowing down, their bodies going slack against each other. John could feel the adrenaline seeping out of his body, leaving his limbs heavy and useless, and he was suddenly terribly exhausted again.
Mycroft studied him for a moment, his eyes raking over Sherlock’s weary face, his slightly trembling hands holding the teacup, his expression of defeat.
“Sherlock, “he addressed his brother who didn’t even look up at him from his seated position on the sofa. “I’m glad to see you up and about. How are you feeling?” His voice didn’t indicate any sort of honest concern or sympathy for his brother’s condition, instead, it sounded as if he was asking a colleague or an employee how their day was. He sounded
“Oh, I am cooking you a soup, - vegetables - I thought, to give you your strength back and John can use it too after looking after you all night. Tea’s ready for you on the table, dear, it will make you feel better.” He looked at the table to indeed find a steaming kettle of tea there, as well as his and John’s favourite cups.
He rolled off of him as quickly as he could, but Sherlock grabbed his arm before he could get off the bed and flee - this room, the flat, London, anywhere that wasn’t here.
Slowly and with a heavy sigh, Scott turned around again, rolling his eyes. He fixed John with an annoyed glare. “What?”
Sherlock’s eyebrow arched up and he got that smug look he often used. “Oh feeling bossy today, are we? You can’t make me do anything.”
7 o'clock. A bar in the city where they were supposed to have amazing burgers which John suddenly craved.
Soon she was back with the bed and also with a pair of slacks and shirt and a toothbrush, too. John was touched.
He hesitated, not wanting to embarrass or insult her. But her smile seemed genuine, so he stepped forward a little, leaning in close to her, and took a small whiff of air. Now he could make out a faint scent that was quite nice: sweet, like vanilla, but it was quite faint.
“I assure you, I am, “Sherlock said through gritted teeth. “Why can’t everybody get off my back already? God, what is it with you all today? You’re driving me crazy with all your fussing around. I repeat myself, I am not a child!”
John shook a little harder. “I know you want to sleep more, and you can do that again soon, but we need you to wake up now. Can you please wake up for me?”
The tall Alpha was smug as he explained what he and Sebastian had done with their centipede sample, while Sebastian indicated every single thing Victor was talking about. They had done good work, John saw at once. He dared a quick glance at Scott and saw that the other student barely seemed to be listening, the way he was glancing at the wall or the side, his face showing off his boredom with unashamed candidness.
He stopped himself abruptly, covering his mouth with his hand, seemingly irritated with himself. Obviously, he wanted to say something more as he opened his mouth yet again, but before he could utter another word both of them were grabbed by the forearm by John’s friend Mike, pushing them into a small alcove away from the crowded corridor.
John stared at him, distressed at the sight of Sherlock in this unusual state – upset, unsettled. Almost uninhibited. This was a man in pain, a man scared out of his wits, and he needed someone to take care of him, desperately.
His arms full of heavy blankets, he returned to Sherlock, threw the blankets on the chair in the corner, and quickly sat beside his friend, slightly out of breath.
“Alright, I’m done now, Mr. Holmes, “she said, “You can get dressed again.” Sherlock at once grabbed his clothes and hurried to put them on.
“You thought I’d be angry at him, didn’t you? You thought I was going to punish him?” Billy was inches away from Sherlock’s face now, the gun pressed into the vulnerable skin of his cheek, and Sherlock frowned slightly, but didn’t say anything.
At Sherlock’s irritated scowl and raised eyebrow John swallowed down his urge to chuckle and looked at his roommate in mock confusion.
Maybe he had managed to loosen his own bounds as well. That would be good because if he hadn’t, John would be on his own in a fight against two armed men. Or not. Sherlock was quite the capable fighter and could probably hold his own even with his hands bound behind his back. There were still the guns to consider though.
Until now, it had been something terribly tedious. The needs of his body that luckily only made themselves known very rarely, and even more rarely strong enough to force him to succumb to them, rendering him a pathetic, helpless slave to his stubborn transport. He hated it, being this weak and he always felt bad afterward, feeling he had done something utterly beneath him, something that had absolutely nothing to do with science or cleverness or wit. Instead, it was a shameful act, based on pure physical needs, symbolizing the deficiency of human nature. It was extremely embarrassing that even he, the brilliant consulting detective couldn’t ignore those occasional vile demands of his body despite his fervent attempts every time they announced themselves.
When the handle still wouldn’t give way, he pounded his fist on the hard, unrelenting wood of the door, shouting in frustration to open up but it didn’t budge. His ears filled with a terrible, high-pitched noise and he desperately covered them with his hands to protect them. It all started to go to hell and suddenly, he was very afraid.
“Don’t. “ John said quickly. “You don’t need to say anything. You’re not under pressure here. Please, Sherlock, relax. I just needed to tell you this, it’s been weighing on me so much. But you don’t have to say anything to me now. Or ever. I’m okay with whatever you decide. You’re not obligated to tell me anything. Please. Sherlock. Talk to me.”
He had thought about approaching Scott before class, trying to catch him before he entered the lecture hall, but had abandoned that idea quickly. He didn’t want Scott to feel cornered or ambushed and thought the Beta would feel better if John spoke to him in the safety of the lecture hall, surrounded by other students, where John would not dare touch him again. Not that John would do so again, but Scott didn’t know that.
“I had to, Greg. You know he hates hospitals and in the state he’s in…. I’d rather he feels comfortable and is surrounded by people he knows.”
“Oh.” His eyes widened in surprise, not having expected to have someone stand in front of him like that, least of all his impatient Alpha Professor.
“The nurse will be there in two hours, Dr. Watson, “he said flatly. “Please try to wake him until then.”
“I’m taking a bath, “Sherlock answered, already half out of the door. “I’m completely covered in sweat, it’s disgusting.”
“Alright, I’ll leave you to it then, “she said frostily, “John, you just need to stir the soup for another ten minutes then it’s ready to eat. If you want to that is, you can throw it away if you don’t.”
John would be back here soon, and they could carry on as before. Maybe he would humour his friend and behave for a little while, take it easy, only look at cases from home. That would appease his stubborn army doctor and then everything could go back to normal again. Mycroft could go back to ordering the world around and leave him alone, let him live his own life in peace. As it should be.
Worried, John pushed Sherlock a little away so that he could get a good look at him, but Sherlock whimpered and tried to push himself back against John’s body again.
Sherlock did. John released him and took a little step back. “On a scale of 1-10, how much does the head hurt?”
After a while, John took a deep breath and looked at his friend, taking a chance. “Sherlock?” His friend didn’t turn his gaze away from the TV. “Hm?”
They agreed to meet Lestrade in one hour in which he would make all the arrangements for the murderer to be settled at the police station.
John groaned. “Ah yes, I already forgot.” He dragged a hand over his face. “But I can’t, he’ll run out of here as soon as those papers are signed, and I fear he’ll run onto the street, right into a car, he’s so eager to get back home.”
John sighed. Sherlock was so stubborn, and he was also obsessively immature when it came to his brother – that also applied to Mycroft. Those two would always indulge in their little games of power play, teasing and mocking each other childishly without realizing they really cared for each other. It was tiresome but John didn’t know how he could convince Sherlock of Mycroft’s sincere feelings for him. Besides, he heavily suspected Mycroft didn’t want his brother to know of these feelings if he even was really aware of them himself. This wasn’t the time to do take care of this delicate matter anyway, it was more important now that Sherlock got his rest. When this thing was over and done with, maybe he could bring up their relationship again.
“It’s our first class this semester. You don’t want to be late for that, do you? I heard Professor Magnussen refuses to let anyone coming even a minute late take the class.”
John was gone. Instead, there was a faceless man lying on top of him, kissing him, groping him, biting him. Although some tiny part of his mind knew that this was not real, that he wasn’t in any real danger, he was still terrified within an inch of his life.
“Uhm … Oh God … I’m not sure! I think it’s ... inhibition of mitochondrial respiration!” she blurted out, and looked at him in fear as she awaited his reaction. Everyone watched, holding their breaths in silent tension, until Magnussen finally graced her with one of his dead cold-eyed smiles, after which he nodded and moved on.
John hesitated. He wanted to believe Mycroft, but he wasn’t convinced. “I- I’m not sure, “he said eventually.
He had just managed to take his notebook, his pencil case, and his bottled water out of his bag when one of the doors in the front opened and the professor came in. John studied him with a curious look: he had heard quite a lot about this man but had never met him before. The man only taught fourth-semester-courses and upward, probably couldn’t be bothered passing on the very basics of his profession.
She stared at him with wide eyes for a moment. Then she nodded, turned, and left without saying another word.
“I’ve spoken to the advisors here. As it happens, ‘Advanced Toxicology’ fits right into my timetable. It also fits in well with a few other courses I’m taking. I will get credit for the course, naturally. And I’ve done the ‘Introduction’ in my first semester, got special permission for that because of my entry marks”
That was met with a deep scowl and Sherlock refused to answer that. He turned his body towards the window, away from Mycroft, to indicate that their discussion was over, but Mycroft wouldn’t just be dismissed like that.
Mycroft rolled his eyes again. “My God, Sherlock, you really are a child. You have a concussion and if I recall correctly, the doctor said to take it easy for a while. So would you just stop behaving like an imbecile and do what is asked of you? For once?”
Suddenly unable to hold himself back, he reached out and stroked Sherlock’s bruised cheek. Just once. He needed that now. He needed physical contact to reassure himself of his friend’s presence. Sherlock would not allow that when he was awake, and John allowed himself one tiny gesture of selfishness. Although he always emphasized, he was not gay, he was not averse to touching Sherlock. They were best friends after all and touching each other haphazardly was normal. Brushing against each other’s shoulders in passing, clasping each other’s shoulders in triumph after a solved case, hitting each other in the face for other cases or running away from the police, handcuffed to each other …. It was part of their daily routine and John had never questioned or regretted it. In fact, he enjoyed it although it was a little strange to think about it. There was something about Sherlock that automatically drew John to him. Sometimes he felt like they were two magnets, unable to stay away from each other. There was no other human being John was so close to. Funny, that it was a man like Sherlock Holmes – socially awkward, arrogant, and probably emotionally damaged – that would become his best friend.
Sherlock blinked a few times, a clear sign he was quite irritated. “No, I don’t see the necessity for that, “he said stubbornly, his eyes still focussed on the telly although his breathing had quickened and he was shifting uncomfortably, a little as if he wanted to put some space between himself and John.
Sherlock, meanwhile, fully clothed in his armour of suit, Belstaff coat, scarf, and gloves was pacing the living room. He glanced up when John appeared. “Four minutes and forty seconds left.”
“Yes. Omegas don’t have many rights, “she said sadly. “Even when we become adults, our parents are the ones who decide about everything: bank account, car, flat, insurance - everything was in their name. Only when Omegas bond with an Alpha do the rights get transferred to their mates.”
Then everything started to blur again, as the colours faded to a dull grey. Sherlock knew what that meant. His transport was getting tired, so tired that his mind wasn’t able to work effectively anymore for long. He would have to leave his mind palace soon in order to get some rest.
Well, maybe he would get the chance to meet one this term. Like always at the start of a new semester, he would get to know many new people, maybe there would be an Omega among them? They would be bonded of course, not available to him, but he could befriend one anyway, couldn’t he? It didn’t always have to be about sex.
“Sherlock, “he said, forcing himself to smile warmly, and he pointed at one of the chairs, causing his friend to look at him as if he had gone mad, already forgotten about their plans to have lunch.
Mike curiously followed John’s gaze. “Ah, I see, “he said with a small chuckle when he realized who John was looking at.
Sherlock’s eyebrows arched high, sea-green eyes widening in genuine surprise. “What do you mean, John?”
John cringed internally but his lips curled up in a carefree smirk as if he wasn’t even a little ashamed at being caught like that. “Yup, “he said with a light shrug, “that would be me.”
John grinned back at Sherlock. “There you have it, Sherlock, I’ll get my own food. Now no more excuses, you will eat the food on that tray, Mister.”
John shifted his gaze to Greg. “Alright, let’s make it quick, I don’t know if he’s able to stay awake for long.”
“John, I’m sorry, but I need your statement, too, “Greg continued, “and I need you to come to the station with me.”
But it gave me an opportunity to concentrate on Mycroft for a change, that was fun to write :) On John, too, of course, bless him.
“It’s just as well, “Sherlock remarked with a simple shrug of his shoulder. “It seems the distraction is doing wonders for your diet, you finally seem to be losing weight. Congratulations.”
“He says it’s alright, “he said at last, and he had to clear his voice because he was hoarse. “He wishes me good luck.”
He registered a body hovering over him and suddenly there were hands stroking his arms, stroking his chest, stroking his stomach. His already trembling body began to shake violently as the hands slipped under his shirt and began fondling his bare skin.
“Then why not let him take care of you for a little while? He’s a doctor and he cares for you, deeply. You even live with him, it wouldn’t be so hard to let him fuss over you for a couple of weeks, take your temperature, change your bandages, would it?”
“Yes, John, I know, “Sherlock interrupted him sharply, his hands still moving rapidly on his keyboard, “yes, I was assaulted. But what should I do now in your opinion? Cry my eyes out about it? What’s done is done. So let’s move on because I’m getting bored already.”
John nudged his shoulder playfully with his own. “I will, you git, I’m just trying to remember the right words.”
“Please, John, calm down! It won’t help you if you’re making a fuss now. Behave, stay calm, and explain everything to them how it was, and you’ll probably walk out of here in no time.”
Before Sherlock could try to bundle up more strength to protest the man grabbed him under his arms and pulled him up. As soon as he was standing Sherlock’s knees gave in and he would have fallen again if the other man had not wrapped his arm once again around him to support him. Sherlock didn’t want to be held like this, this intimately as if they were lovers, but of course, he was powerless to do anything about it. His whole body was trembling although he was hot, it felt as if a fire was burning through his veins, as if he had a fever. Still, he shivered, and he couldn’t prevent the low moan escaping his mouth as his mind still fought against this helplessness.
“I need to check on Sherlock, “he informed Greg, and without waiting for an answer he turned around and started pushing through the crowd.
“First, we’re going to divide the class into four groups which in turn will be divided into pairs. Each group will work with the poisons by the same three animals, namely: the
He was still at a loss at what to say, and John was unexpectedly quiet, so he tried to lighten the mood with humour.
He lost all sense of time but after a while assumed that a few hours had passed. It wasn’t really important though, it didn’t matter.
He had never seen John with a man though. John seemed very averse to the thought of being with another man, or at least he seemed averse to the thought of people thinking of him as gay.
John opened his eyes, a little surprised at his own dark thoughts. First the beating and then this. He knew he had a temper, but he was usually able to get himself under control, managing to avoid getting into brawls with people that upset him. But apparently, this man had brought out his most violent side, one that he couldn't keep in check. No wonder if it had been necessary to save Sherlock from harm. To witness something like that happening to him, was just plain awful.
A short almost hysterical laugh escaped John’s lips. “Are you serious, Mycroft?” he asked incredulously. “I resigned myself to spend at least the next ten years of my life in prison and you ask if it’s alright that you send me nice things to eat and sleep with until you’re having me released? Really?”
It was the beginning of his fourth semester and John was excited to be back at Durham University. His summer vacation had been long and dreary, as always. Mom had been even more depressed than usual and Harry’s drinking seemed to have gotten worse. It had almost driven him mad, sharing the limited space at their small apartment in Leeds, the place his mother had rented after his father’s death two years ago. Not even a handful of multicoloured tulips in an old cracked vase or the new shiny microwave his mother was so proud of having bought in a special sale at Home Bargains, made up for the depressing coldness inside that flat. Spending the whole two months of his vacation there was always unpleasant, but he had nowhere else to go and he couldn’t afford to travel, so he always ended up at home.
Okay, where did these thoughts come from? John was so shocked, he jolted upwards into a sitting position, breathing hard. His heart was beating in his chest like crazy.
Nevertheless, he said: “I’m sorry, Mrs. Hudson, I can’t talk about it right now. All I can say is that he’s been assaulted tonight, and he needs rest, quite urgently. So, would you please leave us now? I’ll take care of him, I promise.”
He wanted to leave because he had nothing to do here. But something told him to stay and he couldn’t leave, however much he wanted to. Somehow, he deduced, his mind provided him with an opportunity he needed to take. He didn’t know the reason for it but maybe this was important to change whatever was happening in the here and now for the better. Maybe he needed to see some information to know how to help with John’s situation?
But this? Sherlock falling off the couch, shocked to see John? Scrambling into his arms, shaking like a leaf, with tears in his eyes, as he was apologizing to John, convinced that he was responsible for John’s misery, even if the truth couldn’t be further from that.
He sighed a heavy sigh as he finished cleaning himself. It was no use fretting about this. He needed to rely on his instinct in this and John’s experience as well. Since he had gotten to know John, he had seen the other man with dozens of women, so he must have quite the experience regarding sexual matters. Relationships too, although for some reason, they always seemed to end very quickly.
He slammed that door shut, too, extremely irritated and annoyed. What could he do now, if even his mind palace denied him the answers he so desperately needed?
Magnussen continued to stare at him for a few more seconds. Then he nodded, smiled, and returned to his desk. Everyone in the room seemed to sigh with relief, excluding the blue-eyed boy who was staring at Magnussen’s back with barely repressed disgust.
The crowd had grown considerably, in fact, the place was packed.  It was getting more difficult to understand what his friends were saying and they had to shout at each other which was a little tiring. But it didn’t matter, the more he drank the more he didn’t mind and the less they talked. You didn’t need to talk much when you could just sip at your beer and observe the crowd around them, making some comment to his friends when the need arose.
“Of course, dear, “she said, glad to be included, and she patted his shoulder affectionally, as she passed him on her way to Sherlock’s bedroom.
Now that he knew how he felt about him, he could barely refrain from looking at him all the time. His eyes flicked over to Sherlock before he knew what he was doing, and he felt sudden heat rise within the pit of his stomach as he took in the bedazzled frown on the other man’s face, his long eyelashes fluttering as he blinked, his alabaster skin looking even paler than usual.
“Yes, I’m fine. It’s just a concussion, nothing to worry about.” Sherlock looked at John sideways. “Apparently, doctors like to keep patients under their care a little longer than necessary, probably out of some stupid power complex or something the like.” John just grinned at him.
He felt his hands closing around her heavily bleeding neck to strangle her and he was grimly satisfied by her cry of pain, the feel of her wet blood underneath his hands, and the fear in her eyes as she struggled weakly beneath him. She was suffering a great deal, and at that moment, it gave him a strange sense of justice. He was glad he had chosen to shoot her in the throat - that way she would have to endure a lot of pain before she died - she didn't deserve to die quickly from a bullet to the head. The blood was still spurting obscenely from her wound and he figured she would be dead in about three minutes at the most.
At the hospital they whisked Sherlock away and told him to wait. So he found himself pacing the hospital corridor in the waiting area, wringing his hands in frustration, waiting for somebody to bloody tell him what was going on.
. She had a heart-shaped, fake-tanned face with heavy makeup. Especially the bright red lipstick stood out –
But apparently, he would never get any answers to these questions. It seemed Mike had been wrong about this: there would be no second chance for him with Scott Williams.
“I’m sorry, “he repeated, and Sherlock hesitated, apparently uncertain if he really meant it or was just trying to appease him when another knock at the door made them all look up again.
Mycroft’s face fell a little. He looked at John quietly as he pondered his words then he said, his voice a tad softer than before: “Yes, of course. My little brother tends to ‘grind my gears’ so to speak. But .... it certainly wasn’t my intention to upset him. I am truly sorry he is so unwell.”
“Elena? Hi, “he said, his tone completely different when he was talking to his assistant manager a few minutes ago. “Have you arranged for everything? Did you get all of the calla lilies I ordered? Three hundred? Great….No, don’t arrange them like that, do it like in the first picture, the one I sent you yesterday. Yes, yes, that’s right. And Elena? That eulogy I told you I was going to write? I’ll send you the draft later tonight, alright? Yeah, great, see you then.”
He turned off the lights and swore to himself that he would not think of Scott again for the whole weekend.
“Sherlock! There you are!” He heard Greg shout and he felt a pull at his arm, indicating he should sit down.
For a moment, Mycroft froze at the door and John grinned as he watched Sherlock shift to his knees in excitement, a triumphant look on his face, aware he had struck a nerve.
“And I meant it then too.” John reached out to cup Sherlock’s face, brushing his thumb against his sharp cheekbone. “But then, I only referred to your brain, your intelligence, the incredible power of your mind. Now...I’m referring to you as a person.”
“Nothing, “Sherlock answered, and his voice slurred just a little bit, of which he was quite proud. “Nothing to see here, no, absolutely not.” He waved his hand in front of his face and closed his eyes as he sensed the beginning of a headache digging its way through his skull.
“Would you let me take a quick look at you?” John tried not to sound too eager. He knew that although technically he was Sherlock’s doctor, right now in this hospital, Sherlock was not his responsibility, but nevertheless, he felt the need to inspect him personally.
Trying to shove the useless thoughts out of his mind, John dove deep down and frantically searched for a body floating around. With his hands bound and the heavy Belstaff on his thin frame, there was no chance that Sherlock had made it to the surface. Panic set in, when he realized that he almost couldn’t see anything in the dark, muddy water.
Greg grinned, too. “Sherlock. Just let the good doctors decide what’s best for you, alright? They only have your good health in mind. You should be thankful.”
His whole childhood was here. From the very first memories of his four-year-old self cradling a stuffed old teddy bear to his small thin body to the more recent recollections of a teenage Sherlock who was yelling at his parents and Mycroft most of the times.
Unfortunately, he couldn’t risk causing a ruckus due to his specific circumstances. So he had no choice but to ignore the profound sense of revulsion whenever someone leered at him, pushing back the rising anger in his stomach, the urge to punch those imbeciles straight in their stupid faces. Instead, he just gave them a drop-dead stare and left. It made him feel frustrated and bitter every time it happened, but it was still a better alternative than getting into public fistfights every other day.
John stirred and Sherlock held his breath as he stayed completely still, unwilling to let their casual closeness come to an end. Then there were strong hands on his shoulders, pushing him back gently. John shifted so that his face was on the same level as Sherlock’s, surprise lighting up his face when he saw that Sherlock wasn’t asleep.
Then he remembered. Sherlock himself had given him the clue he needed. Something about an escort agency, a prestigious one. On impulse he dived up the stairs, leaving the poor befuddled Mrs. Hudson standing by herself and he grabbed Sherlock’s laptop, still open on the kitchen table, where he scanned through the pages still open and voila, after a few seconds, he did indeed find the webpage of a highly expensive-looking escort service. Unfortunately, there was no legal info, just a black screen with a strawberry on it and a box below asking for a username and a password. He cursed and quickly called Greg, to ask for his assistance. It took a good five minutes of waiting in which he nearly dropped his phone because of his nervousness – when he finally got the address he needed.
“The ears!” was the instant reply, and John admired how the kid refused to lower his gaze in front of the tall man looming over him, obviously trying to intimidate him.
Sherlock seemed relatively relaxed although he usually didn’t enjoy loud crows as well as many people stuffed together in one hot, room. John watched as Sherlock glanced around himself nervously at times as if to reassure himself there was still an exit he could take any time, but Sherlock caught him looking once and he smiled at him in silent reassurance.
“And Sherlock, I really do think that it’s necessary for you to realize how bad you treated your body. You were still recovering from the assault from two days before and now you have been attacked again so soon after.”
The first file he drew out were odd things he had witnessed John say in reference to the nature of their relationship:
He bit his lip nervously while he waited and then sighed in exasperation at Mrs. Hudson’s reply: “Okay, thank you anyway. No, I don’t know where he is. I have to find him now, so take care.”
Then he changed his tone to something stricter. “You know Sherlock, you didn’t give me a chance to check on you or give you your meds. As your doctor, I must say, I’m disappointed in you.”
Sherlock inhaled sharply, as if he wanted to say something, but he stopped himself. John wanted to say something more, so many important things that he had only discovered for himself recently, but the words got stuck in his throat and suddenly he was terribly afraid.
John enjoyed his breakfast thoroughly after which he was taken back to the interrogation room. He barely managed to suppress an exasperated groan when he saw that Dimmock was already waiting for him in his chair, looking even more hostile than yesterday.
John watched as Sherlock deduced the scene in front of him until there was nothing more to deduce. He was glad he had come here with him, it was obvious that this was the best thing to keep Sherlock from the horrible incident from two days before. But just as Sherlock was jumping up, declaring he had to go to the victim’s house and take a look at his stuff, John laid a hand on his chest to get his attention.
“I’m only allowing this because I think some fresh air and distraction will do you some good, “John continued, fully aware of his mother-henning, “but you still need to take it easy, no running around, and especially no chasing after criminals, alright?”
“Don’t bother Graham, “a sharp voice said, and they looked up to see Sherlock leaning against the door frame. He was trying to appear casual, John saw, but he also detected the slightly trembling hand hidden behind his friend’s back as well as the tiny beads of sweat in his forehead. But Greg was not a very attentive man, most of the time, so maybe Sherlock could fool him.
But those few people in his life he spent more than a few minutes with – people at school when he was still a child, students at university, flatmates, neighbours, police officers – they all eventually realized that he was simply too much to put up with. More than once he had experienced people walking away from him in a fit, slamming the door behind them after declaring their undying hatred for him, thus ‘breaking up’ with him. It had always been fine to him, there hadn’t been any interesting relationships anyway and the few attempts at real friendship – one could better call them experiments - with others had been less than satisfying. It was tedious, people expected him to return favours, spend time with them regularly and were offended when he didn’t bother to respond to texts or preferred spending his time with dangerous experiments in the laboratory instead of going to the movies or to a pub. No, being friends with people had simply not worked for him in the past.
He didn’t know what it felt like to be in love with another person. Maybe he was mistaking friendship with love? Maybe he was mistaking physical attraction with love? He wasn’t blind or dumb, he noticed and cataloged every single reaction his body had in response to John’s presence, his words, his touch. It was obvious that he was very, very attracted to John, at least physically.
John offered his hand and Sherlock hesitantly took it. John rose and pulled Sherlock up with him. They stood toe to toe and at once John’s body reacted to the renewed but different closeness. His heart beat in his throat as he looked directly into Sherlock’s still wide eyes, his slightly open mouth, his expression of utter confusion slowly disappearing. He smelled nice. His raven hair shone in the light that fell through the window and John thought it would probably feel wonderful to let his hand run through it, to feel the soft curls between his fingers.
John’s heart swelled at the sudden unexpected revelation from Sherlock’s lips. He couldn’t believe those words, the ones that proved that instead of an analytical cold mind there was a human being behind the hard façade, one that proved that this man cared about him, John, deeply. This man that had hurt at the thought of him away in prison.
“That’s not fair!” Mike gasped beside him. “That’s not in the book, it’s sixth-semester material, even I don’t know the answer to that question. How mean can he be?”
The blood in Sherlock’s veins was boiling, his heart was pounding rapidly in his chest and he suddenly felt somewhat light-headed. He needed the answer to his question right this instant, but all that he got was an irritated look from John Watson, his brow furrowing even further and that was when Sherlock became aware of the increasingly familiar scent of salty seawater, spiking in the narrow space between them.
Scott stared at him in disbelief, his eyebrows raised as if to challenge his remark and John sighed.
“What happened, Sherlock? What did you say to her?” He was already suspicious, he knew his best friend, knew that he was unable to keep back the snark. When Sherlock didn’t say anything, his eyes dropping down, his suspicion was confirmed.
“Why would you want to get to know me better?” Scott asked, a little less hostile than before. “If it’s not to date me?”
Also, I'd probably like to write a sequel to this in which new aspects to this story will be explored, so this part is going to end pretty soon.
After looking at them for a long moment, Mycroft didn’t even try to hide his smug smile. “We didn’t mean to interrupt any….intimate conversations or whatever you two have been up to.” With this, Mycroft’s eyebrows arched inquiringly at Sherlock, to which his brother only huffed and looked away.
“Which form of mercury was the predominant cause of Minamata Bay disease?” he suddenly asked, pointing at a lad with red curls, sitting in the middle. “Yes, you, I mean you, “he said sharply when the boy paled, pointing at himself in question.
They made their way downwards and found two seats next to each other in the fourth row on the left side. It’s not where they would usually choose to sit. John didn’t like to sit too close to the front, that’s where the swots and bootlickers were sitting. But beggars couldn’t be choosers, so he swallowed his pride and took his seat. On the way down he saw several familiar faces and smiled or nodded at them, even if none of them were close friends. In the corner of his eye, he saw Sarah Sawyer, a red-haired Beta girl he was loosely befriended with. She shot him a shy smile as he passed her seat.
“J-John….” His head lolled to the side, leaning into John’s touch and John’s heart swelled at the subconscious comfort-seeking gesture.
Panic gripped Sherlock’s body, threatening to overwhelm him completely. He didn’t want her to touch him like that. He didn’t want her to invade his space like that. The weight of her body on his seemed to suffocate him, the closeness of her flesh made his skin crawl and he felt nauseous. But he couldn’t let her see his weakness. He had to be strong, so he willed himself to put a stoic expression on his face, to not let it show how much her actions were affecting him.
John watched as the detective finally grabbed his fork and started to poke at his food with it, drawing small circles into the red sauce as it flowed from the meat and pasta he was stirring up.
“You smell so good, darling, I could just eat you up." The man's administrations were getting more and more aggressive, more demanding. His hands roamed all over Sherlock’s body as his mouth travelled upwards, from neck to chin to mouth.
“It’s okay, he’s my friend, “it continued, this time apparently directed at the friendly waiter bloke.
The Alpha’s eyes widened when he realized who had shouted his name. A small smile flitted across his tanned face but disappeared quickly and was hastily replaced by a neutral expression. His mouth tightened and he pulled his shoulders back, his whole posture signifying an air of defiance but Sherlock couldn’t help but wonder about the meaning of that hidden smile from before.
He could even choose to do something different this time. He didn’t have to hook up with another ‘boring’ Beta girl. Of course, there were so many of them, blond or brunette, petite or tall, slender or curvy. He could have whoever he wanted. But why always taste the same dish?
Tilting his head back against the wall behind him, he closed his eyes, deciding to give himself a minute to calm down. He ignored the students passing him by with their stupid, useless chatter and their stupid, useless laughter. But their noises actually helped cool him down and so he just sat there, breathing in and out, allowing the buzzing noises to wash over him, gradually letting the pent-up anger and frustration and this utter,
John rolled his eyes, too. “Yes, Sherlock, it is. I don’t even have to explain to you why it’s important as you bloody well know why it is.”
“Sherlock! Are you alright?” John’s hands shot out at once to grab Sherlock by his thin arms to steady him. Sherlock stared at John’s hands around his arms from his position on the floor, then at him, his lips slightly parted in shock.
“P-please, John, I- I can’t ….” His pleas were a helpless stream of distraught whines, there was nothing left of the calculated, controlled persona the detective usually projected onto the outside, only raw, unveiled desperation, from a man seeking out the comfort he so frantically needed. His long thin fingers clawed against John’s back as he tried to push John against his own body and John was almost sure that Sherlock was not really lucid because he couldn’t imagine Sherlock losing his cool like that intentionally. He was clearly not his usual self right now.
He texted Tonya too, asking if she wanted to meet up at the party tonight. She immediately texted back, agreeing happily. Truthfully, he wasn’t in the mood for an intimate date, he actually just wanted to have some fun and get laid, if possible. After all that emotional chaos with Scott, he felt pent-up and he needed to vent some of his frustration in some way. But he thought that Tonya was looking for the same thing so he didn’t feel bad about his plans.
The paramedic arrived on the scene and a slender brunette woman quickly kneeled next to John to take a look at Sherlock.
She then took off the bandage from Sherlock’s shoulder who could not bite back a pained hiss as she did it. The wound looked ghastly and John cursed inwardly. It looked infected and he really needed to analyse it more so he could choose the right antibiotics. She took a few pictures from that wound as well.
John quickly found the little path and found himself in said St. Edward’s Park. It seemed totally abandoned, he didn’t hear any sounds.
And if he only was a nuisance to everyone around him – from his parents to his fellow students at school, to Mycroft to John – what good was he to anyone? He was good at solving crimes, brilliant to be exact. Lestrade at least would always be grateful for that.
He fumed a little longer as he paced back and forth, and all Greg could do was watch him helplessly.
Sherlock stepped into his mother’s house, his father peaked his head through the kitchen door in greeting and quickly disappeared again. He stopped and wrestled the coat from her small body revealing a costume that, in Sherlock’s opinion, outweighed the others. This costume was a bee outfit that fit over the top of her black baby grow covering her torso and head with a hood. There were even wings that stuck to the back once her coat had been taken off.
Mycroft nodded and followed the smaller blonde into the kitchen. John flicked the kettle on and opened the fridge, he stopped, surprised, and turned to Mycroft. He gestured to the full – not full of body parts but full of food fridge, meat and fruit, dairy and veg - and asked, “Is this your doing?”
“I suppose it’s a dent in the routine, bringing her all the way out here and keeping her up for later.”
“I know that” Greg snapped, keeping his voice light as not to disturb Maeve. “And you talk to her all the time.”
“Because it was quiet in Afghanistan,” John snorted, “and I wouldn’t say that I enjoyed my time there.”
“Where do you plan on taking her?” Sherlock asked absently as he stared at the screen of his phone from the doorway, eyes flicking over his mother for a second before returning to his phone.
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed, uninterested as ever. He held the infant out, offering her to his mother. She took her and pulled her close, eyes wandering over her small body. Her eyes then settled properly on her son.
“I thought you’d be interested in this one.” Greg peeled the covers from his shoes and walked over to the consulting detective, he peeked at the sleeping infant, his face softening slightly but there was no diminishing the coldness in his eyes that came with every single crime scene.
The blonde sighed and edged closer to Maeve. She watched him with wide blue eyes. “Shall we go and see Aunty Harry?”
John frowned and deduced, far less sure of himself. “You thought you wouldn’t be able to control your emotions around me.”
“Yes, Violet is rather,” he lowered his voice, “excitable at this time of year. It was worse knowing that both of the boys would be here and it’s Maeve’s first Christmas so she just went…overboard.”
“Get me a coffee,” John shouted after him, he might as well get a decent coffee from the café if he were going down there.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and focused his attention on Maeve, she was resting contently on his chest with her head turned to the side towards the other occupants of the room. Her blue eyes bright and searching over the room is slow but steady movements as she blinked, eyelashes fluttering against her pink tinged cheeks.
“Do you want to moisturise her or should I?” Sherlock asked, holding up a bottle of expensive looking baby lotion and shaking it from side to side for affect.
“It is not that she was in the papers that is often the way with…celebrities,” Louise said, “It’s the circumstances in which the articles took place.”
“No it’s not.” Mycroft agreed. It was surprising how much John Watson understood his brother. And he was constantly surprised by the similarities between Sherlock and Maeve, there would never be any doubt, she was hid daughter, through and through.
“I know.” He snapped at the doctor, not taking his eyes off of the screen for a second. “She’s just woven me around her tiny finger without even trying.”
“Alright mate” A voice pulled him from his head. A large man was stood in the hallway, wearing overalls covered in specs of pain. “Finished the nursery, we’ll be leaving now.”
Sherlock’s eyelashes fluttered open and he was greeted with the sight of John Watson, glorious John Watson, still asleep and basked in sunlight, his skin, golden, and greying blonde hair, shimmering in the gentle morning light. He was flat on his back, diagonal across the bed, with one arm over his head and the other trapped beneath Sherlock’s body. Sherlock, for lack of better term, was sprawled across his lover. Lain on his side, arm across the blonde’s chest and face tucked into his neck. They were cocooned in each other.
Sherlock strode out of the bedroom with Maeve in his arms. The infant was resting against his side as though she was sitting on his hip, completely supported by his large hands and face pressed against his suit. She wore a simple pale yellow baby grow with a large cartoon bee.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, offended by the accusation and reminded him. “I am a genius John, I’m hardly likely to forget the moment I was stabbed.”
John smiled at that. “I work at a local surgery but help Sherlock with cases when I can, he really is quite brilliant.”
Sherlock smirked, he hated the cardigan, it was knitted and pink, he hated the colour pink, even in light shades. He said unconvincingly, "that was a shame."
Anthea opened the door from the inside for her boss, eyes glued to her blackberry. Mycroft paused. “And Sherlock, Gregory and I will take Maeve off of your hands Saturday.”
Josh started, delicately snipping the strong thread. "She might not be yours, for all I know you just picked her up and claimed she was yours."
“This place is…” John trailed off, bent over the steering wheel to get the full view of the large manor house as they drove up the gravel driveway.
The ex-army doctor was pacing the room in a feeble attempt to calm down a screaming Maeve Holmes. His leg hurt, and with every other step, he limped slightly. His thin white cotton t-shirt was sticking to his clammy skin and Maeve was grasping at the fabric as though she were holding on for dear life. She was red-faced, her skin blotchy from her cheeks to her stomach, and clammy. She wore only a nappy, her skin was hot to touch and she was crying into his ear. Her head resting on his shoulder, tears streaming down her face and wetting his top.
“God, that’s sick.” John shook his head. Sherlock merely raised an eyebrow as he continued to stare at the information in front of him and the blonde prepared himself to feed the baby, placing the muslin over his shoulder and taking the lid off of the bottle. He gestured to Greg and the Detective inspector lifted Maeve up so the blonde could hold her in one arm and feed her with the other.
“Hot and teething, what are we going to do with you?” Mrs Hudson asked as she stepped into the room, placing the bowl of ice on the small table beside John.
“Maeve” Mycroft substituted. “She is, well she clings to Sherlock and him to her. She would happily pass the day away in his arms just listening to him, he is quite attentive.”
“It’s ok.” John muttered, voice rough with sleep and as soft as he could muster given the time. He pulled her close. John turned to look at Sherlock and told Maeve. “Daddy’s here.”
“I didn’t take you as the paternal type.” Louise raised her eyebrows and pulled her lips tight together.
Sherlock nodded once to John and then again to his brother, something of a silent understanding and went through the kitchen to the bathroom, once again hopping over the stairgate there. The door swung open and the tap was running within moments.
“I want…if you want” Sherlock struggled with his words “if you wish to continue referring to yourself as Maeve’s ‘papa’ then I would not be adverse…”
Sherlock glimpsed at him, eyes flicking over his dark suit and the warm expression in his chocolate brown eyes. “Shouldn’t you…be at work?” He asked in an attempt to make small talk.
“No, this is strategy which is what Mycroft is good at. He will help us with my parents and in return I will not associate him with them.”
Hey guys, I’m actually fulfilling my promise for once and am updating regularly in this merry month of December. So, there are going to be questions at the end of this chapter so I want y’all to know that Mycroft and Greg have reconciled between the chapters but I’m not including it within this narrative. I will cover this thoroughly in my neighbouring fic Ideal Uncle in the foreseeable future and will notify you when it's up.
“He was alive,” Sherlock announced, finally rousing from his thoughts and looking up, slightly dazed.
“What are your intentions?” Mycroft asked, eyes fixed on the younger Holmes and his even younger daughter. Sherlock grunted in reply, not dignifying his brother with an answer. Mycroft sighed but continued, these matters were very time delicate. “Sherlock, I know this is a very big decision for you but you have to decide. Either she stays with you or Mummy and Father can look after her.”
“Been reading to her?” John asked gesturing to the book that Sherlock had dropped to rest on his knees.
“You’ll have to talk to work and sort something out. Surely they can manage without you working till all hours of the night.”
“It must have slipped my mind.” He rolled his eyes, John stood up and offered him the seat. Sherlock took it, plopping down onto the black leather with his hands supporting the baby, she whined in annoyance but quickly settled back to exploring his skin, her new favourite thing. John pulled a chair from the desk and placed it beside his flatmates armchair.
Siger hovered in the doorway, lent on the wood with his legs crossed elegantly and hands over his chest.
Sherlock furrowed his brow. “Maeve is rather fussy today, she woke at five and has only just got back to sleep. Though Mrs Hudson is competent there is no need to put that on her, she is being extremely difficult today and needs to be around somebody that she recognises.”
Sherlock frowned and John went back to reading the novel, keeping his voice low and only stopping when Maeve was beginning to fight off sleep. Sherlock commanded him, “don’t stop.”
Sherlock watched as the older man raised his daughter above her head and brought her down again in swift motions as though she were flying. He cleared his throat and tried again. “I was unclear. Stop. Or you’ll clean up the sick and have to give me CPR.”
“Where to Sir?” Anthea asked. Her phone was by her side. Her eyes were on the car seat beside her boss who was glancing in at the squirming infant.
“You could put her down.” His mother scolded, eyes flicking over the sleeping baby which seemed attacked to his chest.
Sherlock opened all the presents quickly and methodically as Maeve focused on the small duck. They were all age appropriate toys. “This is,” he cleared his throat, “very kind of you.”
“No, its fine,” she put her finger to her lips in consideration. “Afterwards I’ll pop and do the shopping.
Sherlock said nothing, merely watched as his lover fiddled with his cufflinks and then settled, placing his arms down beside his body and gesturing at the consulting detective with a lopsided smile. “What do you think?”
“She’s been difficult today.” Mycroft informed them. “She woke up at five and refused to be put back down, she only just fell asleep before he came to me at ten.”
“You’re going out” Sherlock observed. He was sat in his armchair with one leg crossed elegantly over the other and baby Maeve cradled in his arms drinking from her bottle eagerly. Sherlock looked up at John as he walked down the hallway and stopped into the kitchen doorway. The ex-army doctor was freshly washed and dressed in a white and red checked shirt, tucked neatly into his jeans with a brown belt and matching shoes. His coat was hooked over his arm.
Mycroft Holmes was sat at the breakfast bar with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other. He was dressed in forest green pyjamas with a matching dressing gown and dark slippers. He looked up at John and smiled, not the fake kind he reserved for everyday life but a genuine smile; that he often found forming on his lips in the company of his niece. Greg was less put together; wearing a pair of grey tracksuit bottoms and a loose Bowie top. He held his cup of coffee as though his life depended on it.
Doctor Green was wringing her hands together in a simple but well practices movements, in the way someone would put cream on or antibacterial.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed as though he was waiting for something, when it didn’t come he looked at the ground, back up again and cleared his throat. “I love you John.”
They didn’t have to queue at the London Eye. Mycroft had made them an advanced private booking and they were shown to the front of the queue where Harry was waiting, looking awkwardly at her feet.
Sherlock gave a curt nod and craned his neck to look at her, Maeve was looking over his shoulder at the plain wall rather uninterested. He moved her away from his body so that she was no longer pressed against him but supported in his strong hands in the air. She blinked rapidly, sapphire eyes flicking around the room.
Sherlock scooped Maeve up off the floor when her twenty minutes had finished and placed her on his hip, she immediately grasped his dressing gown to steady herself as she supported her own neck.
“I’ve been coming for a few weeks now and haven’t seen you before.” She explained, stepping into pace beside him as they walked through the pool changing room towards the family area.
Maeve stirred in her pram, face scrunching up and gloved fist coming to rub at her eye in jerky movements. She was going to be hungry and would need changing. He looked up for a moment. There was a café, small and clean looking. It wasn’t very busy, only quarter past eleven. The consulting detective went in and sat himself down at the table in the corner, there was enough room for the buggy to rest beside the table and look in on Maeve.
“It’s the only coat I have.” The blonde argued. Sherlock hummed but didn’t answer. Instead he removed one hand from the handle and pulled John closer to his body. “What do you think you’re doing?”
“We better look for the back door, “he said and promptly turned around the building to find said door.
Well, it could only technically be called ‘home’ as he himself had barely lived there, and apart from that, it had never felt like home to him.
He took the blanket from Sherlock’s chair and gently draped it over his friend’s body. It was still one hour until Mycroft would be back, enough time so that Sherlock could rest a little more. He would not be happy to see his older brother and it would not be an easy conversation. John just hoped that Mycroft would be a little wiser than him and not provoke Sherlock into working himself up into fainting again. He would have to keep an eye on that.
It had probably to do with John being a doctor. He always needed to make sure he was okay and touching him, feeling his throbbing pulse underneath his fingers was probably the best way to do it.
He took a cab which for once had miraculously appeared outside Scotland Yard and drove straight home. He felt anxious and nervous and also a little scared.
“You, “Magnussen addressed the student, seemingly as mesmerized by him as John had been just a few minutes before, “what’s the target organ of streptomycin-induced toxicity?”
He threw the crumpled paper into a corner, his eyes drifting towards the high-quality photos leaking out of a brown briefcase underneath the newspaper.
If this Alpha was handsome and popular, on top of being a rugby player and intelligent enough to be studying medicine, no doubt aspiring to be a well-earning, admired physician someday, there would be absolutely no way this Alpha wasn’t an arrogant, entitled prick. Therefore he needed to get his hormones in check, ASAP.
John watched him sleep, brushing his fingers lightly through those unruly curls, completely entranced and utterly content.
His heart stuttered in his chest as he thought it could be possible that Sherlock would still reject him, even if he had seemed inclined to kiss John as well. It was possible that he had only been confused by John’s emotions, that he had been on the verge of pushing John away, exclaiming his undying un-love for John.
At first, he thought she was going to strike him. But he after she had stared at him for a while a grim expression settled on her face and she approached him again.
The umbrella twirled in Mycroft’s hand. “That might be so, but I still needed to make sure. After Doctor Watson’s rather worrisome news concerning your sudden high fever, I was tempted to get you into the hospital myself.”
“Goodnight, “he whispered, but Sherlock was already fast asleep against him, leaving John alone with his thoughts once again.
He had to restrain himself from staring at her. Now that he was standing right in front of an Omega, he couldn’t see what was so special about them. Sure, she was a pretty girl, but she could have been a Beta for all he knew and he wondered what else he didn’t know about them. He was suddenly filled with unbridled curiosity and he wondered if it was terribly impolite if he asked her some questions.
“What?!” Sherlock tossed the laptop aside and jumped up from his chair. “That’s completely unnecessary, why would he do that?”
“What’s going on here? Mr. Holmes why are you up?” one of them asked, confused. “Have you removed the electrodes to the EEG?”
He made quick work with a huge plaster that he cut into the appropriate size and carefully applied to the still-messy wound on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Night, Sherlock, “he shouted over his shoulder and he got a soft “Night, John” back. Maybe his roommate was getting a little tired after all.
Sherlock closed his eyes, his lower lip began to tremble, and he pressed his mouth shut, obviously annoyed with himself. “I would no be able to keep my word, John. I would still, eventually, fail you.”
“Thanks.” Sherlock shot John a grateful look and moved to get off the bed to search for some fresh clothes when a soft, warm hand on his bare arm stopped him. Surprised, he looked up, into John’s worried face.
He wished Redbeard were here with him. The only one he hadn’t disappointed or failed. A true friend, one that had been happy and thankful just for existing.
Greg was standing in the door, staring at the scene in front of him. Dimmock shrugged and sat back down in his chair.
“John? John, Inspector Lestrade is here. Are you up?” Her voice betrayed her concern. She wanted to know how Sherlock was, obviously, and that she had lasted for this long without bursting through their door was impressive.
“Here.” John held out the thermometer and his expression told Sherlock that he was giving him the option of taking it to put it into his mouth himself; clearly expecting him to take that offer. Keeping his eyes locked on John, Sherlock opened his mouth, providing John with another option. Showing him that he trusted him to take care of him like he had done all this time.
“You’re supposed to be a bloody genius but all I see is an idiot who doesn’t know when to shut the fuck up!”
Not that John was gay. He had dated a lot of women since he had moved into their flat, had proven his heterosexuality with it, never had seen Sherlock him with a man nor could he imagine him with one. He never seemed particularly interested in any of the women he brought home but that didn’t have to mean anything. Maybe he just hasn’t found the right one until now. Still, John was clearly into women, he was ordinary that way and it was fine. Sherlock didn’t care if he was gay or straight.
He stopped and closed his eyes. At once the image from the night before appeared in his head, and forced himself to breathe evenly, his hands clenching into fists at his sides subconsciously. Hot fury welled up inside his stomach and he had to take another deep breath, trying to will it away.
“Why did you step in to help me?” he tried again, this time with a slightly firmer voice. “You don’t expect me to believe you did it out of simple altruism, do you? Come on, just tell me. Did you do it to impress me? Do you think you can win me over like that, jumping in front of the line of fire to save me? The perfect Alpha, so heroic and fearless? You do, don’t you?”
John saw something strange in Sherlock’s eyes and he recoiled a bit. “I stopped him. I found you in the park and I …. Well, I got him off of you before he could get that far.”
His mind flashed and another scene appeared before his eyes: him returning home from school at eleven, with a bloodied nose and red eyes from crying because he had been betrayed by the only person, he had ever considered a friend, Victor Trevor. They had been friends for about half a year since Victor had shown up one day in class, having just moved here with his family from across the country. They had been assigned lab partners and because Victor had been very interested in science, Sherlock had offered to explain some of the experiments to him, eager to speak to someone who could potentially become his friend, but also cautious because of his experience with other boys. Victor had been enthusiastic and from that day on they had been very good friends. Such good friends that Sherlock even forgot about Redbeard for a while. Until Victor betrayed him and attacked him out of the blue after school with a bunch of other boys, mocking him for being a posh idiot, kicking him until they left him alone on the ground, bruised and bloodied.
Sherlock nodded and set off, picking the baby bag up off of the floor and going off in the direction of the hallway. He closed the door behind him and went about searching the room discreetly, not wanting to make too much noise or wake Maeve.
“She may not understand it but she feels unconditional love,” Sherlock told him, looking back at his daughter as she glanced up at him, blue eyes twinkling charmingly.
They were all in one room now, surrounding the largest tree in the house. His mother and father were handed out single presents to each person. Sherlock, wanting to keep away from the madness, was on the sofa with Maeve beside the other kids at the party. They were all watching him keenly. It was a habit.
The blonde and him shared a look, eyes meeting for a moment before the pair broke into a giggling fit.
“Nothing.” Sherlock snapped. He threw a file across the room. A few sheets of paper flew out but the majority of it hit the wall with a resounding thud before it fell apart and the papers floated towards the ground like autumn leaves falling from the tree.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow in doubt. “You are no use to her in this state. Go, calm down, and I will give her back to you, then, and only then.”
“Where is she?” Violet chipped in, turning to look at her husband. “We have to find her. We can take her in.”
At this Sherlock took a heavy breath that spoke volumes, John smirked at the consulting detective’s full name and reached over to place his hand in Maeve’s view. The infant looked at the hand and followed the arm that it belonged to, blue eyes flicking to John’s face after a moment and grasping two short fingers in her fists.
“I’ve sent word to your colleagues they’re collecting the evidence we need and then they’re picking up Amanda. She’ll deny the whole thing.”
“Not for you.” He said around her fingers. He released her fist and cautiously moved the scone further away.
Sherlock stilled. His eyes turning to ice as he glared at the detective inspector. John’s eyes flicked to Sherlock and back to Greg who stepped cautiously into the room. He was obviously on duty, dressed in a shirt and black trousers, blazer and long coat over the top. He ran a hand through his greying hair as he continued to access the situation.
are going to feed Evelyn when she wakes, wind her and put her back to sleep. Then we’ll find a suitable room for her.”
Sherlock simply stared at the woman in astonishment and Mycroft released a breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding.
“Precisely,” Sherlock smirked and climbed out the car, leaving John to follow trying his best not to look flustered as he opened his own door and stepped onto the road.
Sherlock stumbled out of bed and into the kitchen. Harold and Silvia were sat around the table eating breakfast, already dressed, and looked up as he entered the room. John stepped into the kitchen holding Maeve, awake and dressed in a pale yellow dress with a matching sun hat and small white shoes.
Gregory Lestrade stepped out of the house, glancing over his shoulder for a moment before looking forwards as he climbed the last two steps and spotted Mycroft stepping out of his car. A look of shock then followed by slight relief crossed his expression as he held a screaming Maeve tight to his chest. They met in the middle of the street, faces awash with the flashing blue lights as Mycroft peered at his niece apprehension. His grey eyes quickly scanned her body beneath the blanket, she was fine. Luckily.
The consulting detective then walked over to his mouth, stride long and strong. He stopped in front of her, the grey haired woman stood up and gazed down at the child with wonder. Her thin hand settled on her black hair, barely touching her but still just feeling the warmth and precious skull of the child beneath her. The baby’s eyes were blue; bright and inquisitive. She had no doubt that they would settle and match her fathers. She was gorgeous. The image of Sherlock as a baby.
Sherlock lifted his head to look at John. “There is a letter on the desk. It will explain that she is…mine.”
“You don’t have to butter me up.” John smirked. Sherlock smiled in response and leaned in closer to the doctor and his baby. “Is Mycroft visiting tonight?”
"Babies aren't easy" Sherlock informed her, trying to remedy the situation. "In Fact my life has become far more complicated since her arrival, she requires constant attention, none of which I could give her without the flexibility of my chosen profession."
The army lads were all staring at him eyes full of curiosity and amazement, the tall looming figure of Sherlock Holmes did not fit into the homey pub setting. His coat dramatic and stormy eyes flicking over each person at the table, reading their lives with a glance, hair windblown.
Sherlock ignored the blonde and ducked his head down, he began to pepper the older man’s chest in kisses, soft kisses, too soft, and teasing. The blonde took a shaky breath.
Mycroft grinned and lifted Maeve back, over his head. Sherlock took her wordlessly, replacing his brother’s hands with his own and placing her beside him on the sofa on her back, side pressed against his torso. He offered her his hand to her and she grabbed it, grasping two long fingers in her fists.
Greg stood up and injected himself into the conversation. “Sherlock was attacked by the duo in a case we’ve been investigating, they broke into his home and hit him over the head.”
“No.” Greg answered getting to his feet. Mycroft followed suit, standing up and brushing invisible dust from his jacket.
Sherlock turned to her, the others fearing the worst and clenched his jaw for a second before answering, “What would you suggest?”
Siger merely rolled his eyes and stepped into the flat, glancing around and seeking out his granddaughter, he ignored his wife. Violet rushed across the room to embrace her son, unwilling to be hugged, he froze and glared over her shoulder and she gushed, “My baby is christening his baby today.”
“Yes, that’s better. A nice cool bath.” He ran his hand down her arm. She immediately grabbed his hand and craned her neck awkwardly to look at him.
“No problem.” Sally managed. She walked away back towards the group of officers outside of the house.
“She’s lagging.” Kelly added helpfully, flicking through the pictures on the camera with a sad kind of smile.
“About a week” Sherlock told him. It was a guess but all the evidence suggested that she was no more than a week old.
Sherlock glared at him and withdrew his finger. He craned his neck to watch her expression. Maeve opened and closed her mouth a few times, her frown deepening before whining loudly. She licked her lips. He put the finger in his own mouth and licked it clean, brow furrowing slightly at the taste.
Sherlock was like a small animal. He was frightened at the sound of footsteps and he raised his head, eyes widening and training on his mother and father before softening somewhat and looking back down at his daughter. She was fed and now settling down now. Her face pressed into his neck and hands sprawled over his silk covered chest, fingers clutching the fabric. He was on the sofa with John, reclined against the smaller man with one hand on his daughter’s bottom and the other clutching her tiny head.
But she looked adorable and was protected against the sharp breeze, strapped to his chest in the papoose.
“God, no.” Sherlock scowled, the very idea was repulsive. “I am committed to being her father and I will provide Maeve with whatever she needs but I will not be a boring parent, I will not nag her to do homework or cook or even provide routine. I will be exactly as I am.”
“Come on you” Sherlock whispered, his deep voice loud enough to be heard by the awake and kicking Maeve but quiet enough not to wake John. He lent over the Moses Basket and scooped her up in a fluid movement, placing her against his strong chest as he cast a glance at John, the blonde had stirred but was snoring softly against his pillow, a patch of drool forming under his open mouth.
Maeve cried out loudly beside him and he looked down. Her face softened and she smiled up at him. Sherlock gave her a wary look, one of amazement and suspicion. He lifted his gaze and slowly turned back to the table. Maeve started to gurgle loudly as though she were talking to one of the toys.
“Time to get out.” He announced, rising to his feet. Sherlock plucked her up, careful of her slippery skin and wrapped her up in a small soft towel, leaving only her face revealed. He placed a kiss on her small nose. She blinked in surprised and her eyes crossed in an attempt to look at her own nose, when she failed, she looked back up at Sherlock. Her expression was torn between pride and annoyance. Sherlock bit his lip to stop himself smiling. “Yes, you’re very smart darling. A genius.”
“I thought we’d go for a walk, do some shopping.” Violet answered, smiling at the tired baby in her arms.
A passing family looked up at him curiously, the father gave a sympathetic smile and the mother looked at them down her nose, John smiled and nodded at them. Sherlock glared at the woman until she was forced to look away and disappeared into the service station. He bounced Maeve up and down, her head on his shoulder leaning on a muslin, she hiccupped.
“Yes, daddy’s here.” He closed his eyes and rocked her side to side until she stopped sniffling. He opened his eyes and craned his neck to look at her face, then placed a kiss on the top of her head.
“Yeah,” John answered. He glanced at his shoulder at his landlady as he brought Maeve up against his chest and placed a hand on her back, rubbing it through the material as she cried into his shirt.
“I’ll be mother,” Sherlock announced with a smirk, perching on the armchair and pouring the tea exactly how he knew his brother would like, more sugar than usual.
Sherlock nodded and ducked towards the car door, it was open but not as wide as it had been previously. His eyes ran over the car and settled on the carseat, his heart caught in his throat and it felt like the earth stopped spinning for a moment, long enough for the ground beneath his feet to crumble. He almost stumbled but caught himself with a hand on the car door, John noticed, so did Greg and Sally. They both looked up at him and the doctor frowned and asked, “everything alright?”
“There is no way to prove or disprove the existence of a god, whether it is Catholic, Roman, Pagan...” Sherlock continued for his brother.
He rolled his eyes and shifted his focus to the desk, it was normally covered in papers but this morning was different, the papers that littered both sides of the desk were all this morning’s editions and he was plastered all over the front page. Well, he and Maeve were. Luckily, the reporters had only captured pictures of him with the pram or holding Maeve, her back towards the cameras and face hidden completely from view. They were pictures from yesterday after John had left him in the park and he made his way to visit Molly.
Sally Donovan had done a lot of things in her life but this was by far the most difficult. The baby, Maeve, little Maeve Holmes had started fussing the moment that she left Greg’s arms. She doubted it was anything personal, the infant knew Greg better and preferred the company of people she knew.
Mycroft opened his mouth to speak but his mother interrupted. “You must know something Myc, what does she look like? How is she?”
"Present" Sherlock called out from further in the flat like a child hearing their name in the register, he appeared around the corner with Maeve on his hip, supported by a long arm and holding onto his shirt. She was wearing a new baby grow that was pale yellow with small teddy bears. Her eyes fixed onto John and she opened her mouth widely in excitement.
“If you need anything,” she said, still smiling but obviously disheartened. And with that she disappeared.
He was unlike any other person he had met. Except for Mycroft, but his brother was comfortable being who he was because he had stuck to the principle of sentiment being a weakness. In contrast to himself who was party cold, inhuman, a freak and partly, emotional, weak, unstable, at least in everything concerning John.
Sherlock looked at him in disbelief. “I just told you. I won’t be able to change. Not completely anyway. But that’s what you need me to do, isn’t it? You won’t be able to …. endure my ways.”
“You’re not the only one, “John said quickly. “It’s good to see you, Sherlock. I was worried about you.”
. He was moaning and trembling and trying to get the bastard off of him but couldn’t because he was so weak. He was completely helpless, Greg. I have never ever seen him like that. It was … truly awful.”
“John, calm down, we’re gonna find him but it’s not gonna help him if you collapse from hyperventilating.”
At some point, Sherlock found himself drifting away. He tried to force his eyes to stay open because he wanted to hear the rest of it, too. But it was useless, oblivion was already pulling him back into its heavenly realm and he was floating, floating away, weightless in empty, endless space. John’s voice accompanied him on his way, the smooth honey-like sound cushioning him, easing his way, until it too, was gone.
Swallowing a few times, wiping at his still-moist eyes, he made his way towards the building’s exit, staring ahead of him without really seeing what was there.
After his seminars ended he spent his afternoon diligently doing some homework and preparation for tomorrow’s classes. The evening came and he and Mike devoured some beans on toast while watching some silly soap opera on TV. It was probably best to have a full stomach before going to the party and thus avoid getting drunk within the first hour.
“Hey. Hey, “he said as he clasped Sherlock’s hands into his, trying to get him to stop thrashing about. “It’s okay, Sherlock, it’s just me. We’re home, in your bedroom, just you and me. Calm down!”
He led the young man to the door by his shoulder and shot him an amicable smile when Frederic seemed a little doubtful if he should really leave it at that. He turned at the door, his medical bag in his one hand, his jacket in the other.
A shaky exhale left Sherlock’s mouth,  and he nodded, swallowing once more as he looked at John. His anchor, his moral compass, his protector.
He looked at Sherlock and thought that he seemed a little overwhelmed by all this information, staring into the room with his eyes glazed over. Maybe it was all getting a bit much for him.
And after everything he had done to John, it was understandable that John was fed up with him, ready to throw in the towel.
He swallowed heavily and desperately tried to push the unbidden images out of his thoughts. In the back of his mind, he registered that his heart was beating like mad in his chest and his body, faced with overwhelming physical and emotional strain, was trembling.
But then he remembered. The hidden room. There had been a hidden room that had just appeared out of nowhere the last time he had been here.
“But it’s Sherlock, Dr. Watson, “Mycroft cut in sharply. “You better than anyone else – except for me of course – must know how he is. Must know why he said those things.”
“I must admit, I did. You were making strange noises, it sounded as if you were choking. I knew you were in your mind palace and thought you had probably discovered something upsetting. It seemed you were unable to get yourself out, so I thought I help you, lest you damaged yourself. You know that it can get dangerous in there.”
John stepped forward too so that their faces were merely inches away from each other. “Oh no, you’re not. I’ll not let you out of my sight like that again, who knows where you might end up this time!”
After a few seconds though he composed himself, cleared his voice, and said: “Well, Sherlock, I’m glad to hear that. I’m happy to be your friend and I’m glad you are mine.” Sherlock glanced up at him and smiled with relief when he saw the earnest but friendly face of his friend. “Even though it can get very tedious at times…” John couldn’t resist saying and after a second of looking at each other they both started chuckling in unison.
John inwardly smiled to himself as he pictured the way Sherlock liked to throw himself on their couch when he wanted to make a point, curling into himself, facing away from whoever had offended him – it was just so unbelievably adorable.
“You cannot be serious!” John was shocked. “How had he not known about all this? Here he was, a privileged Alpha male, studying medicine, going about his life like he wanted, with all the freedom and carelessness possible. How could he not have known that there were so many individuals out there that didn’t even own the right to open a bank account in their own name?
He felt refreshed, instead of exhausted. There was still the kind of daze that lingered around after a couple of days of fever and illness. But the promise of recovery was right there and his brain and body jumped at the chance of a return to normalcy. He needed this.
“No, don’t tell me, “he cut John off before he could say anything. “You just scented me. Don’t look at me like that, I saw it. Yes, I’m a Beta. And you’re an Alpha. So what? You want to go out with me? Go out on a date?”
But he quickly dismissed that thought. He wasn’t really up to Mrs. Hudson’s mindless chattering, he was much too riled up inside.
“No, thank God.“ She beamed at him. “My parents are incredible. They married out of love and they always wanted me to be with someone I love too. they were worried when I presented as an Omega, but only because they knew how dangerous it can be. They didn’t want me to get mated to some superficial, ignorant Alpha who doesn’t really care for me. So they watched out for potential partners and they set up a few dates but they would never have forced me to be mated to anyone I didn’t want.”
Sherlock swallowed heavily. His lips parted slightly, his eyes darting between John’s eyes as he tried to figure out the meaning behind John’s words.
As he made his way through the corridors, the grey closing in around him, words started to echo through his head, growing louder and louder.
From the corner of his eye, he saw Victor and Sebastian smirk at each other and he was a second away from stepping forward, to tell the truth when he stopped himself. It was a lost cause. Magnussen had made no secret out of the fact that he liked the two Alphas and he would never believe John if he told them who was really responsible.
Mycroft fixed him with a challenging smile. “Oh is that so? I’m sorry Dr. Watson, but I was under the impression that you were the one upsetting my little brother just a few minutes ago quite successfully.”
“I don’t want any of these cheap pathetic tea bags!” Sherlock exclaimed indignantly but then John turned his strict gaze at him once more and he deflated visibly, muttering “Earl grey.” John bit his lip to avoid grinning and dropped the tea bag into the hot water. He put the cup on Sherlock’s nightstand as well as the bowl of porridge and the apple. Then he prepared his own breakfast, making some toast with ham and cheese and he slipped back into the bed to eat there with the food in front of him on the nightstand.
“Would you mind telling my brother that I hope he gets better really soon? And that I’ll be in touch.”
Sherlock let out a long, anguished sigh and then recounted yesterday’s events in a bored, clipped voice. John leaned forward while he heard the story for the first time, too. Greg sat down in a chair and wrote everything down Sherlock said. When Sherlock reached the part where he was captured, he hesitated, and John perked up.
But instead of mocking him for it, as Sherlock would have expected him to, Mycroft’s features softened. “John saved you both times, Sherlock. You needed him, badly. If he hadn’t been there, you would be dead or at least hurt even worse than now.”
He had been belittling John from the start. Had told him he had a simple mind. Had deduced him in seconds, as if there was nothing interesting to know about John Watson, apart from his status as an ex-soldier and doctor, his problematic relationship with his sister and his psychosomatic limp. John had always openly admired Sherlock’s skill, but Sherlock had only scoffed at that and pitied him for being so simple.
Sherlock nodded again, his eyes squeezing shut as the tiny movement seemed to cause him pain. John nodded, more to himself than to the man in his arms, then he carefully laid Sherlock down onto the sheet, disentangling him from his arms.
John scuffled the few steps to the phone unenthusiastically. He wasn’t in the mood to talk to anyone, and he really wished he would be left in peace. But he guessed the privilege of peace wasn’t his anymore. Being sentenced for murder would mean that he wouldn’t get a resemblance of peace for the next ten years or more. Others decided what rights he’d have, which ones he didn’t. He wouldn’t be his own man anymore. Might as well get used to it.
Sherlock had scrambled after him frantically, eyes wide and frightened and his hand was gripping into the sleeve of John’s jumper. When he saw John looking at him with a startled expression on his face, he slumped down on the bed, throwing an arm over his face.
“So. I’d like to take a look at your shoulder if that’s alright, “John said eventually. “And you need to take your antibiotics, it’s time for your next dose.”
His throat constricted around a tight knot and he swallowed hard, finally managing to turn his eyes away from the gorgeous creature sitting just a few meters away.
He processed forward, his anxiousness growing because he didn’t hear a sound and he was sure the woman was doing something to Sherlock. They had to be quick now or he would be hurt, that was obvious.
Finally, the professor seemed satisfied and he turned back towards his desk, presumably to resume his lecture. But then his eyes fell on the blue-eyed student in the front and something flashed in his eyes. John watched nervously as the professor approached the young man, fixing him with a curious glance as the student looked at him with fire in his eyes. It was obvious he was seething with anger, barely controlling himself as he stared at the professor, his pale eyes burning with disgust and John clenched his fists helplessly at the sight of him. Was the lad mad? Did he not see that his reaction was turning Magnussen’s attention onto him?
He couldn’t possibly speak anymore and with a sudden need, he pulled his trembling best friend up and into his arms, pressing him against his chest. He brushed his wet curls out of his face and wiped the tears away from his cheek. “Shhh, shhhh, calm down, Sherlock, shhhh….” He brought his head down to softly kiss Sherlock on the temple and he held him firmly as Sherlock was still shivering and moaning in his arms, still fighting unconsciousness.
John’s whole body tensed, a low growl escaping his throat as he stepped forward, ready to attack the officer at the next wrong word. Dimmock stood up and grinned at John lazily as if challenging him to attack. John was so incredibly angry, he nearly lost it right then.
to being touched like that – so he quickly withdrew his hand as soon as he realized that, feeling guilty. Instead, he laid his hand on Sherlock’s slender arm. That was more neutral, and he settled back into a comfortable position.
While he was lost in his thoughts, he eventually noticed Greg was still looking at him, so he sighed and said: “I don’t really know, Greg. I hope it’s not, but it could very well be so.”
“John?!” Sherlock seemed completely overwhelmed by his presence, his eyes wide open as his body fell out of its position and in his attempt to scramble a little away from John in order to really take him in, Sherlock lost his balance and fell backwards off the couch.
They looked at each other for a few seconds, trying to gauge the other man’s thoughts. After a moment, Sherlock’s lips curled into a tight smile. “Alright, suit yourself. Goodnight John.”
“No, “Greg answered apologetically, “I’m not allowed, mate. I was there with you when you shot that woman, I’ve already given them my statement. I’m a witness and it’s protocol that the interrogation is made by officers who weren’t at the scene. Sorry.”
“I’m not denying anything, “Magnussen growled, his voice low in warning. “I’m just pointing out that there have been no theories by other scientists to support those ridiculous theories of Arendsen. And you know as well as I do that a theory, especially a bold theory like that needs to be supported by more than just one scientist. So excuse me, for not believing in its accuracy just yet.”
He staggered and was once again supported by the person next to him, a strange man he managed to note as he painfully and slowly turned his head to the side to look at his saviour.
Nevertheless, he was worried about the bite wound and though he didn’t want to put even more strain on Sherlock’s body he decided to administer a universal antibiotic to treat a possible infection in the shoulder prophylactically. He fed the liquid medicine to Sherlock very slowly spoon by spoon and held his head back so he would swallow. Sherlock coughed a little in his sleep but didn’t wake up.
“The things I'm going to do to that mouth...” He traced the lines of Sherlock’s lips with his fingertips and his breath was hot on Sherlock’s skin, smelling of alcohol and sudden nausea overwhelmed Sherlock, it was too much. He tried to turn his head to the side.
When the lights were turned back on at seven in the morning, he had just fallen asleep an hour ago. His last thoughts had been full of concern for his best friend.
Greg chuckled. “Yeah, yeah, you addict, I’ll get you your stuff but just get back home and do what your doctor tells you, alright?”
Now Sherlock was curled against the corner of the couch, making himself as small as possible. His face was bent down, and instead of seeming happy at the news his brother and Greg had brought, he seemed dejected.
“John! Don’t!” A hand closed around his and tugged. John stopped in his motions though the anger was still pulsing through his veins in a way that was nearly frightening but also strangely elevating.
“Even to my powers there are limits, John, “Mycroft stated coldly. “And it won’t be a problem to convict him if they have all the evidence they need. So, we’re gonna give it to them. I want to have a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner look at him today and get the kit done.”
He bit into his thumb’s cuticle as he swore to make it up to Sherlock. He would not belittle him anymore. He was a grown man and he was a strong, independent person. If he needed John to give him space that’s what John would do. Even if it meant he would go crazy worrying about Sherlock all over again.
The couch dipped when he sat down but Sherlock didn’t move. John swallowed heavily and laid his hand on Sherlock’s knee.
Greg appeared at the door with an anxious look on his face. “How is he, John? How was the examination, did he agree to do it?”
As she touched him, Sherlock flinched violently and tried to get away from her touch at once, making him push backwards against John’s chest. “N-noooo, please, noooo ….” And he sobbed again, shaking his head frantically.
This chapter was hard to write somehow. Getting the characters right, having John be that vengeful, Sherlock still snarky although he's hurt....I really hope I got it right.
John said nothing but he didn’t look happy. He now stood next to Sherlock with his hands outstretched towards him, as if he expected Sherlock to fall any second and was ready to catch him as soon as that happened.
“Hey, Tonya. Great that you’re here. You look nice.” His tone was friendly, but he was a little irritated that she had already kissed him. They hadn’t even had a drink yet, let alone been on the dancefloor together.
“Now, now, Sherlock, “he admonished quietly. “You promised me you wouldn’t overdo it. I have to check on you and we’ll go back to Baker Street now that you had your fun.”
Gritting his teeth, he slowly crumpled the page into a ball in his hand, crushing the faces of Holmes and Watson in the process.
“Yes, you’ve done it again, “John clapped him on the back, “congratulations, oh master detective.”  And he bowed his head together with a theatrical hand wave, snickering to himself.
“I … “Sherlock winced as if talking made his head hurt which it probably did. “I remember drinking and eating with you and then I went outside to get some air, and then there was this guy…” He frowned as he tried to remember what had happened after that, but he just couldn’t … it was all hazy and he felt funny anyhow. His head ached as if it would burst any second, his whole body felt like jelly and he was so goddamn tired, he just wanted to go back to sleep again.
The girls liked him too, but that had never been an issue for John. He had always liked being the target of their attention and he sometimes engaged in harmless flirting with random girls. He had known that Mary didn’t mind, she probably had done the same. But they both had taken their exclusiveness seriously and John had never gone astray, had never bedded another girl even if there had been many offers.
Strong, determined hands reached underneath his shoulders and back and hoisted him up against the headboard with remarkable ease. Surprised, he managed to raise his head a bit and John shrugged when he caught his eye.
He turned and walked back towards where he had come from, hanging his head in sullen disappointment.
The man jerked his chin at the cigarette in Sherlock’s hand. “Care to share with me, mate? I forgot mine at home unfortunately and would be really grateful for a smoke.”
She took her hand away from his shoulder and he gasped in relief. He flinched when he suddenly felt her hands on his face again. His breath came out in agonized, little puffs when she brought her face closer to his. Her hand wandered upwards to grab his hair again, holding him in place.
“Alright, Sherlock, you can put your shirt back on, “he said, and he couldn’t resist patting his friend’s wrist fondly. Sherlock threw a surprised look at him but said nothing. He put his shirt back on and dived under the sheets.
With disgust, he looked at the scene playing out in front of him as if it were happening right at this moment. There he was, five years old, at Christmas Dinner with his family, grandparents, uncles, and aunts included. He had always hated it, when the whole family got together, luckily that hadn’t happened often, only about twice a year, for Christmas and Easter celebrations. He was forced to wear a suit and tie every time ever since he could remember those dreadful dinners. His aunt Nelly would pinch his cheek and tell him that he was too thin. His grandfather Jonathan would force him to sit on his knee and listen to one of his war stories, the same one every time.
“You can always come to me, you know?” The Professor suddenly said, leaning forward towards Sherlock a little bit. When Sherlock looked up at him in confusion, he smiled and tilted his head to the side.
Thick layers of chocolate-coloured curls framed the angular face, a couple of which dared to hang loose into the boy’s high brow. Alabaster skin and ridiculously high cheekbones combined with its other lean features made his face look somewhat special, and it was hard not to stare at his plush lips, slightly parted as he stuck his pencil in between them while he listened to the professor talking. His long pale throat was exposed from underneath the cut-out of a tight blue shirt clinging to his thin body, an elegant black blazer covering his slight, squared back shoulders.
“Are you alright?” Mycroft asked. His voice sounded uncharacteristically soft and Sherlock was irritated though he didn’t want to voice it. He wasn’t in the mood for a fight. He felt utterly exhausted and just wanted to drink some tea and rest.
“Of course.” John stood up and held out his hand. Sherlock took it, and together they went into Sherlock’s bedroom where they quietly lay down on the generous bed. Automatically, they settled into the position they had just woken up from a couple of hours ago: with John lying on his back, and Sherlock curled up against him on his side, his face resting trustingly on John’s chest.
After taking a couple of samples of blood the paramedic looked at John again. “Could I at least take his blood pressure?”
“Yes, “John confirmed with a quick nod, glad for the strength in his voice. “I was just going over to my table and I accidentally touched the microscope with my elbow when I passed by. I’m terribly sorry, Professor, there’s no excuse.”
Sherlock jumped a little and stopped talking, having - it seemed - realized at last he was babbling.
His words took John unaware, yet they were spoken in such a heartfelt manner, that a warm, fuzzy feeling spread through John’s chest immediately. He was stunned into silence for a few seconds, wondering what was behind that sudden acknowledgment of sentiment.
He forced himself not to steal some glances at Sherlock’s direction and focus on the television screen instead. He just hoped the doctors would be here soon, he knew his friend wouldn’t cope well with being made to wait. Being forced to endure uselessness as well as boredom – that was almost completely unbearable, as the walls in their flat could very well attest to.
John shook his head, but he wasn’t exactly angry. He and Sherlock had been perceived as a couple so many times now he was almost used to it.
John was still staring at the phone in his hand, his eyes wide and unbelieving. But then he blinked, and he hang up the phone, his shoulders slumped, his body strangely relaxed.
What was it about this strange Alpha that fascinated Sherlock in such an intense way? A strange tingly feeling had spread within his stomach, making it hard to focus, and he forced his gaze onto Professor Magnussen, following him closely as he walked around the classroom, questioning and dismissing students one by one. Technically, he could hear him asking questions and his mind effortlessly provided him with the respective correct answers - yet he wasn’t really attendant. Instead, he was still struggling with his fascination with the angry blue-eyed Alpha and he had to practically force himself not to look in his direction again.
John’s brain eventually started to ask mean questions, forcing his bad conscience to the surface. He had allowed himself to sleep next to Sherlock, possibly traumatizing him even more. Just when he was about to really work himself up into hating himself, John realized his friend was feeling a lot hotter than before. And he was completely limp in his arms. Something wasn’t right.
He dressed in his most favourite jeans and a nice blue jersey shirt that accentuated his toned upper arms. A few dollops of gel into his dark blond hair, a splash of his favourite perfume blending well with his musky Alpha scent - and he was ready to go. Taking a look at himself in the mirror he smirked self-confidently. He was looking good and he knew it. Tonya would certainly think so as well.
He tried to concentrate on his blog again. Writing that article about the coagulation of human saliva after death had never seemed as unappealing as it did now. He tried to form a sentence but came up with nothing.
Sorry, I hope that was readable. I've never written such a dialogue-heavy chapter before...Please let me know what you think!
Sherlock started at the huge brightly lit foyer he always started when he had no specific destination to go to. Sometimes, when he needed to distract himself or simply needed to pass the time, he would choose one path randomly and see where it would take him. He had discovered many hidden memories that way, information that his brain had deemed worthy enough to save but most of those files had been stored away so long ago that he liked to look at them from time to time. It was a good method to give his brain the opportunity to remember things more quickly, which could prove very effective when he needed specific memories to make progress in a case.
Maybe it was his way of thanking him, returning his affections so that John would feel appreciated and valued by him?
“Yes, it’s me. What? Has it been so long already that you’ve forgotten what I look like?” John chuckled at his lame joke, but Sherlock still seemed out of it. His eyes darted forth and back as the detective tried to place him here instead of at Scotland Yard.
He wanted to grab the Beta and pull him away from the disgusting old man. He wanted to shake his shoulder and tell him
“Don’t you have somewhere to be?” he eventually asked Mycroft who stood in the middle of the living room, glancing out the window with his umbrella swirling in his right hand.
He then remembered something about date-rape drugs. In most cases, the victims didn’t remember what had happened to them. Or if they did, they only remembered fractions and bits. That’s why it was so important to gather evidence to eventually convict the perpetrator.
To everyone’s amazement, the professor chuckled then, a smile that did not reach his eyes spreading out on his thin lips. His eyebrows arched condescendingly and he shook his head, just a little, as if amazed at the display of ignorance he was facing.
“Alright.” John was impressed and also a little worried that his friend would admit that he was tired. But he didn’t want to overreact, ruining the peaceful truce between them, so he asked casually “Would you eat if I made you something?”
John was at a loss. “But...I was with Molly. I wasn’t going to do anything with her. She’s bonded, you know that! We only talked.”
She pointed at the bed with a very strict expression on her face. He obeyed, albeit with a murderous facial expression, making no effort to hide his anger at being treated like a small child.
“Alright, Mr. Holmes, “she chirped happily, “that wasn’t so hard, was it? I’ll leave you to your sleep then. Call if you need anything. Good night.” She left.
“We’re off, brother mine. Rest well. I’ll call mother and keep her up to date. Don’t worry, I’ll tell her not to call...at least not for the next few days. That should give you enough time to figure out your version of recent events. But do answer the phone when she calls, you know what’ll happen if you don’t.”
A new nurse poked her head in. “Doctor Watson. I was just wondering if you were staying overnight. Because I could roll another bed in here for you.”
John flashed a short, fake smile at him without really looking because his eyes were once again drawn to the other side of the room where the pub’s restroom was – although he couldn’t see much because of all the people standing at the pub’s tables. He couldn’t help being a little nervous about the fact that Sherlock was not back yet. Maybe that was due to the fact that his friend had a tendency to maneuver himself into hairy situations which in turn led to him, John, having to realize something had gone wrong in the great detective’s plan and swoop in to rescue him. He and Sherlock had only been friends – and colleagues– for a little over a year but there was a certain dynamic between them. It was as if they had developed a system where both of them exactly knew what the other needed to be done, two parts of one mind, completely in tune with each other.
“We have fifteen more minutes, “Magnussen said with a quick look at his watch. “Let’s make the most of it. Now, we’ll start with the very most basics….”
Sometimes he couldn’t believe his own temper. Sometimes he was simply unable to stop himself from letting utter nonsense spill out of his mouth and he hated himself for it.
John and Mason were on next and he explained everything they had done in a calm and efficient manner. At one point, he caught Victor and Sebastian smirking at each other and he sighed as he stopped his explanations mid-sentence with a sigh.
At long last the taxi stopped, and John jumped out, after nearly throwing the money at the driver in his hastiness.
John gently touched his right hand. “I'm going to lower you, Sherlock, alright?” He looked around himself frantically and then crouched down next to the woman on the floor to rummage in the pockets of her blazer. She was in her last breaths, but he just didn’t care. He found the keys to the handcuffs and made quick work of undoing them, although his hands were shaking considerably. Once he wasn’t held by the cuffs anymore, Sherlock’s body fell forward slowly. John caught him and lowered him to the ground, gently.
“Sometimes companies have Omega quotes, but they are very rare. The government doesn’t want Omegas to work, remember? They want Omegas to stay at home and take care of the many kids they bore. Raise strong Alphas and Betas that can do the ‘real’ work.”
“You’re going to regret that, Williams, “he growled as he took a step towards Scott, crashing into John in the process. Scott however, scoffed from where he stood behind John.
“Oh, there’s a lot.” John wracked his brain for the most important things to ask. “Tell me about yourself maybe? I’ve just recently realized how little I know about Omegas, and to be honest, I feel a little ashamed. Just because I don’t know any personally, doesn’t mean they’re not important. You exist, but I almost don’t know anything about you. So, I’d be interested in how your everyday life is like. You’re studying medicine, right? Why? How did you get to meet your mate? What is his stance towards your Omega status? How does it feel like to be bonded?”
But then he was suddenly being addressed by the Professor and his attention snapped towards the older Alpha, instinct and pride taking charge as he pushed the other student out of his mind to meet the challenge presented to him. He was surprised when unlike the other students he was given more than one question and a new kind of heat rose within him when he saw the hunger in his Professor’s cold eyes, longing for him to make an error so that he could be dismissed as well.
John’s eyes nearly fell out of his face. “Are you nuts? You have a nasty concussion in addition to your infected shoulder wound. You’re getting into that hospital gown right now, Sherlock!”
“Quite boring business, all that, “he said with a vague wave into the air. He snatched his laptop from the coffee table and curled up on the sofa with it on his knees.
He rummaged in his pockets and pulled out a few photos he thrust into Billy’s lap. John just saw a glimpse of mutilated human faces, blood, and torn flesh before he quickly averted his eyes.
Sherlock had to push against a seemingly endless count of bodies in order to find his way to the bar counter. He was getting a little annoyed at all the dumb people who ignored his polite requests to step aside and, in turn, used his elbows more frequently in order to reach his destination. He was a little unnerved already, the heat and the volume had started getting to him an hour ago. He felt like it was getting more difficult to breathe and he was grateful for the chance to maybe step outside for a bit of fresh air before getting his friends more beer.
“Don’t move! Hands up!” Greg yelled and the man complied at once. The gun which had fallen out of his hands was kicked away by Greg who then quickly proceeded to handcuff the man. Then he took out a handkerchief and made a tourniquet around the wound with it, to stop the bleeding.
They entered the building and worked their way forward. Luckily, John had a torch with him which made it much easier to move without difficulty. They took the staircase up and found the first floor dark and abandoned. They split up, Greg staying on the first floor, John taking the second. When they found nothing and nobody there, they looked on the third floor but there was nothing there either. Everything was quiet, there were no signs of forced entry and no signs of a struggle. Sherlock was nowhere to be seen.
Without thinking, he got off the bed, leaned forward, and scooped Sherlock up into his arms. His bad shoulder protested a little, but John ignored it. Sherlock was lighter than John had expected, and he frowned as he was reminded of the fact that his friend had barely eaten in the past few weeks. He was a dead weight in his arms and his head lolled against John’s chest as he stood up, his precious cargo in his arms.
Greg looked at him with a worried face before John got into the ambulance after Sherlock on the stretcher. “You know that technically, I’d have to arrest you, right?” he asked.
“Yes, of course. His wound seems fine, everything else too, as I said. Only his pulse was a little elevated last time I checked, but apart from that, nothing worth worrying about.”
There were love bites and angry-looking bite marks everywhere on Sherlock’s throat, chest and shoulders. It was a horrible sight and John had to look away for a second, his right fist clenched tightly into the bedsheets. After a minute he looked again and that’s when he saw the faint bruises on Sherlock’s throat. There was no doubt, he had been strangled by his attacker, so hard that there were marks to prove it.
Because of the harsh laws, Omegas were only allowed to study at universities if they were bonded to someone. Only if their mate gave their consent and only if they made it through a very complicated application process with lots of tests and questionnaires, were they permitted to enter universities.
But apart from that, he was a very private person. He liked to be alone. He liked the peace and quiet. Sometimes he would just play the violin for hours and lose himself in the sound of his own music. Other times, he would just keep himself busy with cold cases from Lestrade or write for his blog. It was nice, doing simple stuff like that in contrast to the adrenalizing detective work he did which included chasing after criminals, analysing crime scenes. His transport needed the rest from time to time, even if he was loath to admit it. But he could only enjoy it up to a certain point, if he didn’t get a fresh interesting case in time, he would get bored being stuck in his apartment all the time, his head would almost burst because the voices inside were getting to loud, so much that he couldn’t endure it anymore. Mrs. Hudson, as well as John, could attest to how much that affected him.
Apparently, the woman had recovered from whatever Sherlock had done to her, and she was moving forward now, doing something. He couldn’t see, so he beckoned Greg to follow him as he crept forward, pushing his back against the wall, so he was at an angle that when the woman in that room looked their way, she wouldn’t see him or Greg.
Greg studied his face for a moment, obviously trying to assess his friend’s mood, sensing that something was wrong. He didn’t comment on it, however. Instead, he pulled the arm of a small, brunette girl nearby to get her attention.
“But…” Sherlock frowned at him, obviously displeased but he stopped when he saw John’s stern glance at him.
He pulled out his phone. As he had suspected there were a few missed phone calls from Mycroft. He made his way out to the hospital’s entrance to make the call. The fresh air helped him relax a little immediately.
“Yes, “he said hoarsely and he half-turned sideways, then abandoned the motion and turned back to the tea kettle. “I’m alright. I just need some tea. Do you want some?”
“Because it’s expensive. Health insurance for Omegas is much more expensive than for Alphas and Betas. It’s because we get sick more often, because we need heat leave, because we need suppressants and because we go on maternal or paternal leave. Not many employers are willing to pay that extra sum.”
“Come on, Sherlock, “he said as he pressed him against his chest with his face down, strong arms still wrapped protectively around the man in his arms, shielding him from the water pouring down on them, “wake up. Come on.”
“John, I’m telling you, I cannot possibly sleep any longer. You know I don’t sleep like normal people. Me sleeping over ten hours is already incredibly tedious, you cannot expect me to even add to these hours. How much more time do you expect me to waste? Really, John, you can’t force me to go to sleep.”
He shot a nervous smile at Mike and focussed on Magnussen again, trying to concentrate on the Power Point, on Magnussen’s words, forcing himself not to look at the student with the piercing blue eyes and the ridiculously plump lips. It was almost preposterous how hard it was, keeping his eyes away from him. Surely nobody human could have that kind of effect on him, could they?
