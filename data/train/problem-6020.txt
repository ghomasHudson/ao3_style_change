He’s gone through four pages of the sketchbook, first drawing his room and then his mother and Bucky, and finally the breathtaking view from the tower when Jarvis’ voice interrupts,
The mark on her wrist is nothing but a fleeting thought. She’s got weapons to destroy and a company to run and things to make.
Steve Rogers falls in love with Tony Stark one creation at a time; falls in love with the kindness, compassion, and absolute generosity that shines through the pieces of metal, the lines of code, the shards of glass.
They’ve danced this dance often enough for Steve to wait for the euphoric whoop that is accompanied by Tony’s inevitable victory, because Tony Stark is larger than life and stronger than death and he’s too stubborn to leave before fixing the world he carries on his shoulder.
“Shouldn’t you,” Steve retorts, even though there’s no fight in the words.
underneath the antique watch Steve wears. She wonders if there is a chance, that the universe has decided that her father is wrong and deems her good enough to be the soulmate of Steve Rogers.
It's his turn to pick a movie this week. He’s told Jarvis to remove the films that are popular enough for the rest of them to have watched them previously. They’ve told him that they don't mind re-watching certain movies but he wants everyone to experience the same sort of excitement he does every week when they put on a new film.
As long as he has Tony Stark, with eyes as bright as life and hands as miraculous as creation, Steve Rogers knows that everything will be alright in this world.
He stares up at the ceiling then, listening to this voice that was created by a man once known as the Merchant of Death; this voice, this artificial
She flings the phone and it hits the wall, crumbling into pieces and Steve doesn’t stop to wonder why she somehow manages to get on his nerves unlike any other, “That was expensive.”
“I have been forbidden to say.”
Everything but the red
“Jarvis, where’s Tony?” The Colonel had asked.
The spy pushes her over to Banner who has no idea what to do with the billionaire who just smirks sweetly up at him, complementing the way he turns into a monster.
He saves Bucky and a little piece of his heart fixes back together again. He finds Bucky and feels less like Captain America and more like Steve Rogers. Bucky’s the only person that understands Steve; the only other person Steve knows with a red letter on his wrist, the crimson
“-orry, Sorry. I thought – I thought that was what you meant when you said feelings and I kind of assumed because – wishful thinking I guess. Can we just forget this happened and-”
Then she can't breathe and sees literal stars and she closes her eyes.
Tony’s eyes hit the heavens before piercing him again, “You never do Rogers.” Steve feels his spine stiffen slightly and he’s about to retort with something that could potentially ruin this whole thing but Tony keeps going, “Besides, all they want to talk about is how we could make more money than we already are and it's not as if they don't know I'm playing candy crush under the table.”
After more shifting around uncomfortably in his spot, while Tony simply looks at his phone then at Steve before awkwardly switching back to his phone, Steve clears his throat and hopes that he doesn’t sound as nervous as he feels, “Is there a place where I can put my bags?”
stamped onto his wrist, taking very little space in the large expanse of skin and muscle.
and nothing makes sense and he freezes for a split second too long, enough for Tony to pull away with erratic hesitant movements. His face is flushed and lips wet and eyes bright and it takes Steve a moment to fully understand the words tumbling out of his mouth.
~~~°~~~
The room is thrust into a silence she cannot discern and she wants the ground to open up and swallow her whole when Steve Rogers just looks at her unblinking and then at her wrist, obscured by the hospital band and then back at her and she wonders if she could blame the morphine.
So Steve doesn’t quite understand why he’s reluctant to let Stark go, why he wants to keep the man that’s all motion and movement and wild gestures and lively stance around for just a little longer.
She freezes when she notices him, and gets up, wiping her greasy hands on her brown shorts, creating stains as she walks up to him confidently.
Pepper and Rhodey just nod uncertainly, and she’s expected the concerned looks from them, expected the slight sympathy and the not so slight protectiveness.
“Got it. I’ll be in and out.”
“Tony created you.” It's more a statement than a question, but Steve figures that Tony Stark would have created an AI with the capabilities of reading between the lines and Jarvis doesn’t disappoint.
They roll their eyes but help her get discharged from the hospital, Pepper using her CEO voice and Rhodey reassuring that the tower is equipped with a certified Doctor and several others, sans Thor, with some degree of knowledge of medical care.
Stark stares at him intently and the way brown eyes bore at him as if they can see right through him makes Steve wonder if this whole thing was a bad idea, if he should have just stayed in SHIELD.
The walk in tense silence to the elevator and it's only when the doors close and Tony’s workshop is obscured from view that Steve realizes that he has no need to pretend that he doesn’t care.
He looks away from their reflections on the glass doors of the elevator to Tony, whose eyes are a little wider, stance a little looser, mask a little more cracked and waits for something, anything. When nothing comes, Steve just turns back to face their reflections on the glass doors of the elevator, acutely aware of Tony’s hands unsteadily flailing around in small motions, incapable of staying still. The thought brings about a small tug in the back of his sternum he’d like to call affection.
Toni rolls her eyes as she follows him into the elevator, “I’ll get you a better one. One that won’t break easily under all that strength from those.”
“Shit.”
She eats the meal right there; in the foyer between her tower and workshop and returns to Hawkeye’s arrows shortly after. She blames Rogers and his stupid pot pie for the wirings in the arrow to burst and give her the kind of burn that would cause complications if she doesn’t treat it right away.
Rhodes rolls his eyes at his best friend’s theatrics, “Considering that you’ve somehow managed to sleep with half the male population of the first years and managed to make half of them cry, I don’t think poor and little should be used to describe your heart.”
He tries to remember the golden flecks that burst like fireworks. The sparkle he can swear shines bright when she’s talking about her inventions. The ring of amber that glows more prominently when she wears one of the shirts with the hole cut in the middle to showcase the arc reactor that somehow means so much to him beyond words can explain.
His eyes burn bright under the lights and his hands move in the air with quick precise movements; breaking apart the holograms and putting them back together, shaping and moulding and creating something better because that’s what Tony is – a creator – and Steve loves him so goddamn much and his legs give out under the weight of the revelation.
Being Captain America makes him forget about the red on his wrist and the hole in his heart. He becomes a comedic act and allows himself to be prodded and poked by several scientists trying to replicate the serum that apparently died with the only man that believed in him.
It entices a small laugh from him and she rests her forearms on the balcony, twitching for a drink in her hands, “Can’t sleep?”
“Exactly.”
And she closes her eyes and sleeps with no nightmares, with no red on her wrist and hole in her heart. She closes her eyes and sleeps with the promise of tomorrow, the promise of love, the promise of the kind of happy she’s destined to feel with Steve Rogers.
She doesn’t want to admit that part of it, part of the insults and sarcasm and striking jokes have nothing to do with her engineer of a self and has much to do with the fact that she’s Howard Stark’s daughter.
And the pounding in his head and the ringing in his ears don't go away until he hears the cough of a man that means way too much in this life and a hoarse but present, “I'm okay, I'm okay. Ease up on the cavalry, I’m all good.”
“Ma’am,” Jarvis’ voice interrupts the wiring she’s installing in Clint’s arrows and she puts the weapon down gently, encouraging the AI to continue, “Captain Rogers left some food in front of the door. Told me to inform you if you don't notice after ten minutes.”
Steve shakes his head, “Nightmares.”
“Captain,” her tone is theatrically shocked, “Were you waiting up on me?”
She pokes his biceps with her finger, the nail cut extremely short and the red paint chipping in various places, and he feels something electric travel through his veins and he wonders if the reason she pulled back as if she was burnt was because she felt it too.
Her father, after ushering the people out the house with the charisma he’s somehow managed to hold onto, throws the circuit board at the wall and Toni watches with repressed fear and aching sadness as her work crumbles down to its basic pieces.
Rhodey chokes on his drink and Pepper, for the first time since she met her, after aliens and Iron Woman and palladium poisoning, looks shocked.
“Out of all the people in the world,
“How about you take your tablet and join me downstairs? I’d love the company and you can catch up on I Love Lucy instead of staring forlornly at the sky. I mean, come on Rogers, there are too many city lights for you to see stars. What are you even looking at?”
The Russian’s lethal is out like a coat and he lets his anger, the anger that he’s taken great precautions to reel in, do the same. He follows her through corridors and around corners, despite an aching, screaming part of him yelling to turn around and go back to Toni.
Everything had changed but the fact that his soulmate is still dead.
Natasha, sensing the tension there, gets up and tugs on the woman’s chair, eliciting a whine from the engineer, “Hey, Tasha.”
Still, he gets under the covers and stares at the dark ceiling as he does until boredom becomes too much for him and he’ll walk around this massive building for hours until he tires and falls asleep on the couch and wakes up an hour later.
But then she remembers Steve; beautiful, kind,
And it should be obvious that he fell in love with Tony. Tony, who builds robots like children, who builds AIs that have minds and souls. Tony, who breaks apart machines only to build them up better. Tony, who gifted him with sleep; who builds weapons for Natasha and bows for Clint until his eyes cannot keep open.
The robot whirrs almost sadly and its claws point towards Steve, causing his lips to tick up at the apologetic manner in which the robot, Dum-e, moves around him. Steve pets the claw and is surprised to hear a series of happy beeps as a return.
Except for maybe, the glowing battery stuck into her chest.
She mouths the words as if she’s supposed to know them and Fury helps her by supplying, “Captain America.”
Steve’s hands are as terrified as his words, she blinks her eyes open, trying to focus her feeling into the way he cups her jaws, running his other hand through her hair in a motion so erratic, she’d like to humour herself and pretend it's desperation she’s feeling.
Steve clears his throat and Tony whirls around in his chair, nearly falling off before righting himself.
flares to life even though there is clearly no one but himself and his poor excuse for belongings in the elevator.
“The tape is located on the shelf behind you Captain, and the extra sandbag is located in the storage room to your right where you will also find one of many first aid kits.”
She chases the taste of his lips, eyes still closed and she feels her heart stop when they brush her forehead, tender and sweet and something no one but Ana Jarvis and Pepper Potts has ever done.
Maybe Tony Stark.
“Some days I dream about Obie trying to rip the reactor off, some days it’s the hole in space. Sometimes it's my dad.”
She looks at him from beneath her lashes and he tries not to notice her flushed cheeks or her lips that’s right there because
The last time he was stunned beyond words was when Peggy Carter had walked into a bar wearing a red dress, talking about dance partners and waiting for perfect people.
She supposes that if she were to tell anyone first; if anyone were to figure it out, she’d prefer it to be Pepper and Rhodey, the two people that mean the world to her.
And so, in a sudden, almost uncharacteristic feat of bravery, Steve sits on the edge of the bed, close enough that Tony’s pinky can touch his knees and speaks in a quiet tone, unsure if Tony is coherent enough to listen, “I dream about Bucky sometimes. He’s falling and I can’t catch him and then he’s gone but he looks so betrayed every time, so disappointed and I should have caught him but I didn’t.”
on her wrist.
He meets the man behind the mask and is disappointed at how far he falls – incomparable to the pure energy that was Howard Stark, the goodness that was Peggy Carter, the selflessness that was Bucky Barnes. Tony Stark is crass humour and snarky nonchalance and scratching at wounds without any regard for feelings and impulsive brashness that could cost many lives.
He places a hand on Tony’s shoulder, soft and gentle because the man deserves nothing less and ignores the tingling that’s slowly working its way to his spine, tugging Tony until he’s on his feet and barely a breath away.
She looks at him hopefully and she looks so young, and so lost it tugs at his heart painfully, “Yeah?”
He’s nothing but a glowing blip in the sky and Steve ignores Natasha’s sly smirk as he hops into the helicopter behind her and they make their way into the middle of nowhere to cuff some sixty-year-old man that was creating experiments in his garage.
“I love you,” he whispers into the small distance.
He nods curtly before making his way back to the elevators, presuming that he could ask Jarvis to take him to his floor when Toni makes a choking sort of sound that forces him to turn around and face her disgusted look.
Perhaps she should have accounted better for the weakness that was her heart. Perhaps love is this burning feeling that settles into her every vein and induces screams she cannot scream, breaths she cannot breathe.
“I built him when I was sixteen.” Tony’s voice cuts through the silence moments before they’re scheduled to get off the elevator and Steve stares at the man for clarification.
Her lashes nearly brush her cheekbone, curling up at the ends and her lips constrict into a small pout. Her arms and legs are flailed in different directions and her hair is tousled and wild, much like the woman herself. He’s managed to capture Toni’s state of absolute peace as she sleeps, the glow of the reactor giving her a more ethereal look. He realizes that there’s a constant weight hanging over her shoulders that ceases to exist when she’s deep in her subconscious.
The sound is faint and barely there and it would have been easy to ignore suppose the serum didn't run through his veins but the serum does and he can hear the soft pitter-patter of rain the way it used to when he was a kid and would fall asleep on Bucky’s shoulder waiting for his ma to come home.
beside his capital
The movie starts and she wants to hit herself for being so pathetic; the soulmate mark doesn’t matter. Whoever’s name is written on her wrist, it won’t matter.
He hesitates, but only for a moment, Sarah Rogers still present in the large part of him that is the sickly kid from Brooklyn, “Thank you, Jarvis.”
She likes to think that wanting to push people’s buttons, wanting to poke and prod until she knows their ticks and what makes them run is part of what makes her such a brilliant engineer.
Steve’s brows furrow in confusion, “What?”
guy?”
“Bed,” he tells her sternly and she raises an eyebrow, relishing in the flush that creeps up his neck, “to sleep.”
“A day later Ma’am.”
She walks in with another kind of armour; high heels and sunglasses and painted lips, and seats herself on the chairs, both feet on the ground and mouth going a mile a minute talking to Bruce who has somehow returned to his former self. Fury tells them that Stark has provided them with her tower where they, all the Avengers would stay in order to be a team; a real one.
Her back is against the wall, and she’s trying to touch as much skin as she can reach, feeling the hard planes of his abdomen and tugging on his head as they clash teeth and tongue and her wrist throbs in a pleasant kind of ache she wants to feel for the rest of her life.
Obie stays by her side when she takes over Stark Industries and brings Pepper into her life; organized, whip-smart Pepper who doesn’t take any of her shit and forces her out of bed and into meetings unlike any other.
~~~°~~~
She rubs her eyes, seeing stars in them, “Traitor, you call me out in front of everyone because I won’t listen to you.”
Bruce and her still blow stuff up in the lab and Natasha and Clint drag her to fight clubs she honestly shouldn’t be seen in and Thor forces her to teach him more about tech to impress Jane so really, the only person she’s ignoring is Steve.
“You need to sleep Tony.” There’s a flash of pain and brokenness and exhaustion at Steve’s soft words and all he wants to do is hold Tony until he lets Steve help him pick up his pieces and glue them back together again.
The name falls off his lips involuntarily and he doesn’t realize his eyes are closed until his voice fills the silence, throaty and ragged, “Jarvis?”
“It's personal,” Steve responds, “For me at least. I don't want to parade my soul mark to the world. I want it to be between me and my soulmate.”
“Jarvis, did you buy me these?” He’s still a little self-conscious about the manner in which he should talk to the AI.
The screams and shouts and absolute chaos is simply white noise, and she can feel herself starting to drift away slowly, welcoming pain; her dear old friend.
“Toni, stay with me. Stay with me, sweetheart.”
“Captain, Ms. Stark requests your presence in the lab and asks you to bring your shield.”
“Sir is currently in his workshop, Colonel.”
Rhodey looks at her with barely suppressed glee, “Shit. You got more letters?”
“Stark.”
“I think Steve Rogers is my soulmate.”
She smirks when she sees him, “Room’s on the 40
Steve huffs out a laugh, mostly to himself, “Only you would be able to build a fully functioning robot when inebriated.”
She still wakes up choking on water, wakes up with blood on her chest, wakes up with Yinsen’s last words on her breath and Pepper’s dead body on her mind. At night, she’s still trapped in the cave, still hooked onto a battery, still dying from palladium, still dying at the hands of her father.
It seems like a good way to leave things off; pleasant and cordial with no room for an argument or tension and a hopeful prospect for their next meeting.
He spins around, rather clumsily and she forgets about the ache in the soles of her feet and the pounding in her head as she makes her way closer to him.
“Magnets,” she whispers theatrically and he has to laugh.
“He’s created a formula that lowered his body temperature considerably. Toni’s sensors or Jarvis couldn’t detect his heat signature until he had his hand on the trigger.” The Doctor tells him with poorly restrained anger.
Steven Grant Rogers was born July 4, 1918, with a closed fist and flailing legs and a capital
“Why did I even build you if you’re going to withdraw information?” Tony grumbles with no malice.
Toni’s too drunk to care.
“They don't Sir,” Jarvis’ voice infiltrates the large gym they just walked into, and Steve lets go of the notion that the AI only spoke when spoke to, “According to conversations had subsequent to investment meetings, they are very much under the impression that you are entertaining yourself with pornography.”
He doesn’t notice the whirring robot until it, with just an arm and a long pole as a body, rolls towards Stark, handing her a bunch of red wires that cause the engineer to narrow her eyes at the bot, “Very funny, will we be laughing when I dismantle you and put you in the incinerator.”
They’re all seated in their self-designated places and he notices a missing member.
“My pleasure Captain Rogers. Welcome to Stark Tower.”
The reporters started to swarm once the crisis was resolved and because of the very little damage, they managed to effectively block the pathway between them and the Helicarrier.
Meals are usually eaten at everyone’s own time and preference but one day of Colonel Rhodes walking into the tower while the rest of them sans Clint and Thor are lounging in the communal living room changes things.
1935; Steve Rogers signed up as a test subject for Project Rebirth, and walked out of a medical capsule a different man. Everything, from his stamina, senses, looks and height had changed.
“Hey guys,” Clint calls over comms, “SHIELD found the lunatic that made these things. We wanna handle it?”
“Asgardians-”
She tries to hate the boy that died and made her unlovable but the part of her that is purely Maria Stark prevents her from doing so.
He doesn’t stop to wonder if that means that he likes Tony Stark more than he thinks he does.
There’s the now-familiar clicking of heels on the tiles and Clint’s accompanying whistle and he, along with everyone else, turns around.
But then Stark grins a grin that is a small upturn of one corner of his lips and only visible because Steve looks for it and says, “Ya. Sure. Gyms there. I'm housing a bunch of beefed-up Neanderthals, of course, I would put in a gym. Gyms on the forty-ninth floor. We can go there right now. Coulson mentioned your tendency of breaking punching bags so I designed some of my own,” Steve feels a blush travel up his spine and, judging by the way the smirk on his face widens, it doesn’t get past Tony, “Let’s go test out which is stronger, my brain or your brawn.”
“He’s very much real.” Fury tells her.
on her wrist.
Tony’s almost manically taking apart the already fragmented pieces and Steve is disconcerted to find that he wouldn’t mind staring for the rest of the night, except that there’s a tired slump to Tony’s shoulders and prominent lines under his eyes and a hollow to his cheek and Steve walks further into the kitchen and kicks at a straying piece of metal to get Tony’s attention.
He rubs the remnants of sleep out of his eye, “Is she okay?”
~~~°~~~
He loses Bucky and nothing makes sense anymore. He loses Bucky and the hole in his heart becomes a black hole, sucking the light and the darkness and everything between.
She thinks that Steve Rogers deserves better than to wake up in cold sweat and have sleep taken away from him. She thinks he deserves to rest peacefully and be immune to nightmares but she doesn’t get to call the shots.
“J,” she rolls out from under the car, “what did we say about-”
So, in a decision that she hopes Edwin Jarvis would be proud of, she hops onto the counter and ices her wounds, asking Natasha, “Any ideas for guns after Leoglas’ arrows are done?”
She drowns the rest of her drink and slightly slurs, “Yep, son of a bitch just ditched off the earth with no regards for my poor little heart.”
The notion has only considerably increased since she joined a team with supersoldiers and assassins and gods and men who spit out bullets. They are their own brand of strength, they exude the kind of lethal that comes with no weakness. They can carry trucks and get hit by cars and can anticipate an oncoming strike.
“Thor,” Natasha calls for the God who’s playing with a Rubik’s cube, “Why do you have two soul marks?”
So she spends her days tinkering in the lab. She goes to fight clubs with Clint and Natasha, blows things up with Bruce, explains television to Thor and hides in her own tower from Captain America.
Tonight is harder than most. Steve wakes up in cold sweat and a scream clogging his throat and a mental image of Bucky Barnes falling off the train and then Bucky Barnes turning into Tony Stark flying a missile into a wormhole – this time, however – he doesn’t make it back down.
Steve balls his hands into fists and tries a go at the sandbag that seems to be allocated for him, judging by the blues and whites and ‘Capsicle’ written in big bold letters, “Jarvis, where can I get tape?”
He has a large sketchbook and several tools delivered to his floor a couple of days after Toni had come up out of her lab and maintained a five-minute conversation with them. The pages have a fibrous texture and the pencils vary in darkness and softness. He doesn’t remember telling anyone about his desire to draw except Jarvis when he had asked the AI about art stores nearby.
She huffs under her breath and makes her way upstairs, sucking gently on the moderate-sized burn wound and pausing in the kitchen where everyone is seated and staring at her.
“Cap?”
~~~°~~~
Jarvis doesn’t miss a beat, “I thought the meeting would go much better if I didn't and aforementioned pornography didn’t show its way to the holograms that projected statistics.”
The reactor isn’t shining, and she isn’t breathing and her eyes are closed and for some reason, Steve’s heart is in his throat and his lungs burn until the Hulk roars and he sees the amber flecks that burst in her eyes and then Natasha and Clint are helping Toni to the tower where the SHIELD agents take over the remaining parts of the crisis.
“Jesus, Spangles. We got to put a bell on you or something.”
She keeps her eyes trained on him even as she feels the familiar feeling of the darkness grabbing in her a chokehold grip. Perhaps she should have accounted better for the weakness that was her heart. Perhaps love is this burning feeling that settles into her every vein and induces screams she cannot scream, breaths she cannot breathe.
Steve and decides that it's worth it.
It doesn’t stop it from hurting though.
Toni shrugs, schooling her expression before telling her friends, “He doesn’t know.”
She kids herself into believing that’s what she’s doing as she makes jabs at Steve Rogers and watches with repressed satisfaction as he becomes agitated by the second, hands clenching into fists and eyes going dark and stormy.
He draws her for the first time, and he wonders if the addition of a
He’s surrounded by several holograms and the table at which he sits is a mess of coffee and metal pieces and wires and tools as if he was jumping between one project to another before settling on fixating on the large arm-like projection in the air.
“Goddamn it, Tony! I said stay with me. That’s an order. Keep your eyes open, don't you fucking dare close them.”
He agrees to live in the Tower, Tony Stark’s Tower, without much persuasion. After the stunt SHIELD pulled with the weapons and the Tesseract and their poor handling of his awakening from the ice, he doesn’t think he’d fare well being in the presence of the organization for too long.
She hops off the counter, yawns loudly again, and waves Steve Rogers away when he tries to help her as she stumbles; she doesn’t think she can handle the electric pulses that travel through her when he touches her. She’s too tired for a cold shower.
But Starks are made of Iron, and so she covers her wounds with an AI that coaches her through breathing sessions after an attack. She hides her weaknesses with a watch that can turn into a gauntlet and the best security system humanity has to offer and JARVIS constantly scanning the area for potential threats.
But she takes it, because she’s not that much of a bitch to leave him hanging when there are clearly so many scrutinizing glares, and ignores the tug in her sternum and the warmth of Steve’s hand as it wraps around hers. She ignores the fact that she’s so badly in love with him and that the tug in her sternum and the acute awareness of the warmth wrapped around her hand is another side effect.
“To some extent, yes. My primary purpose is to my creator and my only priority is keeping Sir safe.”
His words are slurred and too far away, she’s floating away too fast and she tries, she tries so hard to keep her eyes trained on his blue ones, blue like the ocean, like the water she used to wake up to in Malibu, the blue that she wants to wake up to every morning for the rest of her life.
Was tipsy enough to imagine, just briefly, that the next letter might be an
“Ms. Stark, I would recommend some sleep as you’ve been awake for thirty-two hours straight. Preferably in your own bed instead of the workshop cot this time.”
Thor’s response is jovial and Steve relaxes as Natasha pulls up the feed from Jarvis, well aware of Thor’s idea of ‘good’ “We are all well Captain. I must say that this was a battle well fought.”
She doesn’t know where it pierces, only that her entire body feels as if it burst into flames and she chokes on a sob as white dances through her vision and she can feel just how heavy the arc reactor is.
“She might not Sir, but she’ll appreciate the politeness when I'm informing her of your absence in the board room where she now sits with the investors and you might avoid getting a stiletto thrown at your head later.”
The corners of Tony’s eyes crinkle and Steve’s half tempted to run to his room and grab his sketchbook and pencil so he won’t forget the contours of Tony’s face when he’s nostalgically happy, “Ya, I guess I would. And then I’d have to go to SI every day to see him and Pepper will have a heart attack.”
She grabs the heels that she dropped on the ground and calls out to Steve as she half-jogs to the elevators, “Great, the doors are unlocked for you, make yourself at home, I’ll just change out of this and meet you there.”
and a
He regrets not looking when he hears an amused huff of laughter and the two fall into the comfortable silence that’s slowly becoming their new normal despite the fact that it puts the fear of God into Steve.
on her wrist.
She’s smart; he’d give her that. He doesn’t understand one word coming out of her mouth but the others seem impressed and he marvels at the fact that she’s learned this all in one night.
beside the capital
~~~°~~~
And the nightmares don’t stop but when he wakes, it's to the sound of rain that reminds him of the good he had in his past life and the red and gold that’s supposed to remind him of sunset, according to Jarvis, but just reminds him of Tony. The nightmares don't stop but he wakes to the sound of his ma and the colours of Tony and he falls back asleep much easier.
The admission loosens the tension out of Steve, and the remnants of sleep that he’s been chasing for the past few hours hits him in full force and he cannot control the yawn that forces its way up his throat.
“Why is the letter on my wrist red?”
He can feel her tense up and shut down. The faceplate goes down and she’s addressing the crowd as she lifts from the ground,
He remembers barely being able to afford bread and having to steal medicine for his mother because the very little money that he had went to keeping a roof on top their heads and keeping the water coming. It makes him just a little angry, seeing Toni Stark wearing her lavish clothing in the tower she really doesn’t need, throwing the phone as if it doesn’t mean anything; as if it weren’t made from the kind of money Steve would have killed to have as a kid.
As per Stark’s instructions, delivered to him via text on his new Stark Phone, he gets into the elevator and waits, his awkward shifting the only indication of the nerves crawling up his spine and gathering in the pits of his stomach.
“Shit, wait, Captain America? Like the comics Captain America?”
The third time, she’s awake and the pain meds are reduced to the bare minimum and Steve Rogers is yelling at her about recklessness and how she nearly died and her stupidity and
She looks at her wrist, theorizing, asking though knowing the answer, “And when did my soul mark change?”
“Good Evening Captain Rogers,”
~~~°~~~
They say grief is blinding. They say that loss sucks out the light from the world. And Steve Rogers – well, Steve Rogers has decades worth of grief etched into his still-thawing heart and loss tattooed on his forehead. Closing his eyes for a second too long means he’s back in the Valkyrie, falling into the cold, and opening them means he’s stuck in this world; this world of uncaring people and tall buildings and bright lights.
She bids everyone goodnight and if her eyes linger on the Captain, taking note of the small smile that is, for the first time, directed at her, if she feels something stir in her stomach, then it's only because she’s tired.
and mechanical whir that fills the deathly silence, takes in a lungful of air and says,
“Steve, get your shit together,” Natasha nearly growls but there’s something so tender in her eyes as she holds his hands – the hands that are stained with Toni’s blood – and he heaves out a sob.
And perhaps it's because the engineer has been on his mind ever since he woke up, perhaps it's because the engineer has been on his mind quite a lot nowadays but it takes Steve a moment to gather that Tony Stark sitting on the floor of the communal kitchen – pieces of what used to be the microwave and toaster surrounding him on the floor, scattered in a disorganized mess that makes sense to no one but the genius – is not his imagination.
Without Tony Stark, the room feels empty, dead. As if the man had taken all the life in the room when he walked out and left Steve with this unbearable silence that reminds him too much of ice and cold and frozen.
“Thought I was going to lose you without telling you that I loved you.”
Her curiosity is the only reason why she enters the code for the workshop and walks towards the steaming plate of pot pie, a hasty note scribbled on paper she didn't know she owned.
It gets Tony going. He pockets his phone and starts walking towards the elevators briskly. It's only when he starts speaking that Steve realizes that he’s expected to follow, “You’re on the forty-first floor.” The elevator doors close and slowly start to move while Stark still talks, “You’ve got a kitchen and a living room and two spare rooms excluding your bedroom. You can use them for whatever and Jarvis will help you with the decorating. Just ask him if you need anything.”
He was too busy with a conference call.
Fury doesn’t have time for Toni Stark’s antics, not today, “Ms. Stark, if I can have your attention today.”
The arc reactor that’s flickering dangerously as the nurses and doctors rush in an out of the room where Toni Stark lays motionless and still as if the universe thinks that it can stop the girl with motion in her veins and movement in her lungs.
“I know, Steve. We all do. You can tell her when she wakes up.”
The answer to Jarvis’ cryptic statement is clarified when he sees Toni Stark spinning in her chair, two empty bottles of whisky on the workshop floor. The bots are surrounding her, beeping in worry and Steve makes his way towards her slowly.
The robot, equipped with only a long pole and a claw, hides behind Steve when Tony fixates a glare at it, “Dum-e, you tragedy. You absolute tragedy. What did we say about grabbing people’s shirts?”
the first thing the two of them had bonded over.
Maybe his soulmate had died because he would too.
“Sleep is for losers Stark,” Steve responds without looking up from where he’s drawing the ticks of hair that make up Tony’s goatee, the precise shape that’s precariously trimmed daily.
“Your little game of seeing who gets to rescue me from my dungeon.”
She doesn’t forget the part about her joining Fury’s super-secret boy band, even as a consultant.
Mark One gives her the thrill, the kind of adrenaline she hadn’t received since the first time she heard JARVIS come online and call her Ma’am. She destroys her weapons and saves herself before Rhodey finds her. She stops making weapons and becomes Iron Woman and for the first time, the red on her wrist is inconsequential compared to the mission.
before it's gone and Tony, with bright eyes, auburn and gold and everything in between, smiles a smile that Steve will be content seeing every day for the rest of his life and says, “I know.”
on the black ink on his wrist is just a coincidence.
Movie nights become a regular thing with Clint and Coulson stuck together on the loveseat, Thor and Bruce comfortably sitting next to each other on the two cushioned sofa on the opposite side and Tony, Steve and Natasha occupying the large couch in the middle.
For some reason, Peggy Carter chooses Steve. Steve, with a hole in his heart and red on his wrist, throws caution to the wind and allows himself to fall for the woman who bends soldiers with her will and inspires Generals with her tenacity.
So really, it happens by accident.
This time, it's Steve that surges forward and captures Tony’s lips, partly because he’s getting addicted and partly because he doesn’t know how to properly articulate his words to express the amount he feels for Tony and kissing him has to suffice.
He thinks he’s found the one thing that they have in common.
She doesn’t really remember how she gets there, doesn’t remember if Jarvis issued a warning advising her against it or if he simply resigned into making sure she doesn’t trip and fall in the darkness but she’s knocking on Steve Rogers’ bedroom door with words on the tip of her tongue and letters on her wrist.
He’s angry and cold and hates everyone and everything but he’s a soldier so he does as he’s told and reads the files, gets acquainted with modern technology and attempts to breathe through the panic attacks.
Tony waves him away in customary disinterest, opting to refocus his attention back to the hologram that Steve knows for sure is an arm, “No harm right. You draw the short end of the stick?”
~~~°~~~
He nods and smiles at her with an expression so close to fondness, she has to push down the hope that threatens to seep into her chest.
It’s three in the morning when she comes back from the gala. Her cheeks hurt from smiling at people she didn’t want to smile at and her brain aches from speaking to people who were only trying to undermine her. She’s got her heels in her hands and she wants to strip herself of this dress but then she sees Steve Rogers’ at the balcony.
His hasty paces stutter to a stop in front of the glass walls that separate him and Tony and he feels the cold start to seep out of his bones and the silence filter into noise when he sees Tony sitting up on the bed, a golden dog snoozing at his feet and the room covered in bright blue holograms that surround him.
The genius hasn’t come out of his lab in hours, and it feels like days for Steve, who didn't realize he’s gotten used to – perhaps even fond – of the incoherent and incomprehensible babble that chases away the silence and fear and cold and the warmth of eyes that are never really brown.
“I'm fine.” She says, snuggling closer but he continues on as if she had said nothing.
And they’ve danced this dance so many times that it doesn’t quite resonate to Steve when the building – fourteen stories of heavy rock and marble – crashes down like a house of cards and there is no euphoric sound of victory or blaze of red and gold and life anywhere in sight.
He rakes her over. It’s impossible not to. Toni Stark, despite being a world-class nuisance, is beautiful in a way he’s never seen. Her legs are tanned and long and bare except for the bright red shorts and matching high heels. Her lips are painted a red and her hair, dark and wavy, barely brushes her breasts.
She looks at him and she lights up, “Steeeveeeee.”
She’s cordial and inexplicably distant and Steve presumes it's for the best; all they ever do is argue with each other anyway. The only reason he’s here is because Fury threatened to kick him out if he didn't leave SHIELD.
The voice jars him like no other, and the instinct that’s been nurtured into him ever since Wars and Erskine and Hydra that screams
And then, somehow, she’s got a nuke on her back and she’s flying through space and for a second, for a split second, she thinks of the letters on her wrist that aren’t red anymore and feels sorry for the poor kid who’ll grow up with red on his skin.
Steve wholly agrees with the sentiment, although as a once skinny, half-dead kid from Brooklyn, he knows he shouldn’t, “We good down there?”
She finishes off the remnants of her brunch before saying the words that she practiced in front of the mirror, repeating it until it stopped hurting, “He’s still not recovered from his time spent as a Capsicle, I’m not a hundred percent sure my name’s on his wrist, he’s just started to like me and I've decided that I don't need my soulmate to survive. I mean, I did pretty well all these years without one right?”
She misses the soulmate she’s never met for the first time that day. Wishes the world took some pity on her and didn't kill off the one person that would have loved her unconditionally.
“I think your soulmate is so lucky to have you. Anyone would be lucky to have you.” His mind automatically goes to the black letters on his wrist, letters spelling out
She plays with the bracelet that he’s seen on her since they met for the first time, silver and engraved, and his curiosity is piqued, “Your soulmate?” he asks, indicating the bracelet that conveniently covers the part of her wrist where the black letters should be.
She avoids them for the most part.
And Toni? Well, she’s just a human in a titanium suit that has more wounds on the inside than the out who’s barely surviving one day after the next. Weakness is a curse that doesn’t seem to want to leave her alone.
“This is serious”
Rhodey and Pepper exchange concerned glances before Pepper asks, “He doesn’t know?”
“He had a granola bar approximately 19 hours ago.”
Steve, with a stubbornness that could rival Stark’s, persists, “You’re on the verge of collapsing Tony. Go to bed.”
So she chews on her waffle, and keeps her hands tucked firmly under her leg, “Turned black about a year ago, got an extra letter as well, a t beside the S. The good Captain came out of the ice twenty-four hours before that.”
Fury points to everyone at the table introducing them, “You know Natasha and Coulson, I see you’ve already met Thor, this is agent Hill, that’s Bruce Banner and that is Steve Rogers.”
Natasha holds him as he sinks to the floor and lets go of the tears he didn't realize he was repressing, “I love her, Nat.”
The silence is mocking him, scratching at the wounds he’s opened and trying to draw blood so Steve rises from the bed and squints to find the little sliver of light under Tony’s door.
~~~°~~~
She closes her eyes and goes to sleep, innocently believing that tomorrow will be better.
He doesn’t get to hear Natasha tell Bruce to walk it off, to calm down, to check on Toni. He’s ripping apart the hinges on the door and when he sees the man, calmly sitting on a chair in the room while Toni is motionless and still, he sees red.
“Capsicle.”
He doesn’t really have time to think about soulmates and red wrists when they’re on the brink of an alien invasion and he’s in a room with half of his so-called team; Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner and himself.
He carefully guides her to the couch that he occupies more than she does and hears her mumble as he’s laying her down, “M, br’ke pr’mise to Pep.”
Toni walks out of SHIELD promptly after that, dragging Banner with her and calling out as parting words, “Feel free to show up any time. Jarvis will let you in and show you your floors.”
“Okay might be a subjective term.”
He doesn’t see Stark anywhere until he looks towards the row of cars and finds her toned legs peeking out from one of them.
He draws Toni Stark for the second time that night.
The doors of the elevator have opened, waiting for them to pass through but they remain still, stuck in the little bubble created by broken facades and genuine conversation, “I'm not sure he’s what you would call fully functioning, but he’s friendly. Maybe I should make him into a greeter bot. Station him at SI.”
He doesn’t expect the loud, resonant laugh that belts out of her and she clutches her stomach and points at him, “Holy shit that’s crazy. I mean its one thing to know your dad’s an asshole but I thought crazy was pushing it. I guess Howard wasn't off his rocker after all.”
Steve Rogers has decades worth of grief etched into his still-thawing heart and loss tattooed on his forehead but Tony Stark barged into his world with eyes that were life and hands that were creation and built and fixed and moved until his heart was thawed and the grief was gone and the loss didn't hurt.
Then she’s flying off and by the time the rest of them reach the tower, she’s locked herself up in her lab and Steve doesn’t need for Jarvis to tell him to know that visitors aren’t welcome.
He tries to relax himself to encourage the other man to do the same but the truth is that there is too much hurt and scars and words that were hastily thrown and cannot be retracted meaning that more time is necessary before either of them heal.
“Put your shield on the table.” She props herself up on the stool and drags the shield towards herself, flipping it over and picking up some kind of machine the Steve doesn’t understand the purpose of.
“They found the guy. He’s in the interrogation room.”
Instead, he gestures to the loose piece of metal scattered across the marble floor, “And breaking apart Thor’s pop tart heater is better than sleep.”
It's instinctive. It shouldn’t be, but it is; the way she immediately turns around and shouts, “Cap!” and pushes him away from the bullet that she cannot see, but knows is coming.
~~~°~~~
“That is correct Mr. Rogers, I manage every aspect of Mr. Stark’s life including when he is in the Iron Man suit.”
It's only three years later, as they’re drinking at a bar and temporarily being relieved of their respective duties as wingman and wingwoman that an extremely drunk Toni shows a semi sober Rhodey the writing on her wrist.
He’s met with silence but he keeps going, “Sometimes I see you,” The sharp gasp that comes from his right is only audible because of the serum, “Sometimes I see you flying into space and never coming down. Sometimes I see Tasha or Clint with holes in their head and sometimes I’m back in the ice and everyone’s calling out my name but I can’t answer because I can’t breathe. And it’s too quiet and too dark and I can’t sleep.”
“You’d miss him though,” Steve notes softly, and with an undercurrent of certainty in his words that are based on a one-minute observation.
He doesn’t have time to contemplate the oddity of the situation in the kitchen because his ears are filled with the sounds of several instruments at once and, after Jarvis opens the doors for him, he’s thrust into the chaos and absolute beauty that is Tony Stark’s lab – Tony Stark’s
(The boy from Brooklyn had made his appearance one night, what seems like eons ago, when he had snapped at Tony for ruining the film for everyone with his whispered jokes and unusual observations. The engineer had responded with a witty retort but remained silent for the remaining duration of the film. It wasn’t until Steve had asked a question the next time they had movie night that he realized that he actually enjoyed the fast rambles of Tony and his pacing mind.)
“Why?”
now, doesn’t take a genius to add two and two up.” she lies through her teeth with practised ease.
The archer perks up at the mention of his arrows, “Did you finish them?”
And he notes, with mind-numbing panic, that Tony must have seen the other pages – the ones that make up the rest of the book – of Steve’s drawings of Tony; Tony in the morning, Tony during movie nights, Tony in his three-piece suit or in ratty sweatpants. There is love in every line and curve, love that a blind man can't miss and Steve braces himself for the imminent rejection, the pain of losing the one person that means almost everything.
And then Steve Rogers is there and he’s speaking absolute bullshit about wars and soldiers and nothing really resonates apart from that and then she’s in his face spitting out with more vehement than she should muster up, “I am not a soldier Rogers. None of us are.”
Natasha looks at him and Steve looks at Tony. It’s Tony that responds, “Cap, you and Widow take care of that. Barton, I need you on the roof. Clench up.”
When he wakes up, it’s to warm brown eyes, golden flecks shining in a dance between confusion and hope and it’s only when he sits up and reorients himself that he sees his sketchbook clutched tightly in Tony’s hands, noting with dull panic that progressively increases that Tony’s flipped to a page of himself in the lab, working on the reactor.
She wakes up a couple of times after her surgery. The first time, it's too dark and she’s pumped up on too much morphine to stay awake for longer than twenty seconds. The second time, Bruce is there, smiling at her with so much happiness telling her that the pain meds will go away soon, as she languidly drifts away.
and an
He’s practically bouncing on his heels at this point and Steve finds that he couldn’t refuse Tony Stark even if he wanted to. So he nods and ignores the bubbles in his stomach when the corners of the other man’s lips tip up just a little higher and he shouts into thin air, “Jarvis, tell Pepper that the old douche bags are going to have to keep it in their pants for a little longer.”
right next to it.
Blames his soulmate for dying and making his life miserable. Blames his soulmate for marking his wrist with red. Blames his soulmate because he has no one left to blame and nothing left to lose.
“I can’t” The words are a harsh whisper in the quiet of the night with only the moon as a witness and Steve is too pained at Tony’s admission to bother feeling surprised at his sudden urge to kiss the pain away.
“Put on the suit, why don't we go a couple of rounds?”
Steve follows Toni whose expertise is dealing with the press and as expected, she charms them with a painted smile and her theatrics that only amuse Steve instead of pissing him off, as it would have months ago.
“Your soulmate is dead.”
Antoinette Edelle Stark was born May 29, 1983, with a full head of dark hair, her father’s brown eyes, and a delicate red
“I was so scared.” He whispers into the darkness, “thought I was going to lose you.”
~~~°~~~
“Whatever you say, Cap,” Natasha’s voice has a hint of something knowing and sly to it and if he didn't know better, he’d think that she expected this all along.
And they’ve danced this dance many times before. This dance started with missiles and wormholes and worked its way towards flying with abandon in front of guns and crashing into magic barriers. They’ve danced the dance of Tony’s recklessness and running headfirst into danger and Steve has almost gotten used to the way his heart stops beating for a moment and his lungs seize unnaturally for a split second and his knees nearly give out.
He opens the door and she’s momentarily distracted by the lack of shirt and the onslaught of muscle and skin and warmth and tousled hair before she meets blue eyes that she remembers were the last thing she saw before she let the pain take her and she focuses.
He’s long given up trying to keep up with her and so he simply does as he’s told, throwing the shield and then pressing the palm of his gloved hand, watching in fascination as the shield returns, attaching itself to the fabric on his forearm and he looks at Stark to see her smiling at him, a glint in her brown eyes and he has to resist the urge to wipe away the oil stain on her cheek.
“Cap?”
“Toni, Toni,”
She’d told him, one night as he was sketching DUM-E and she was making updates on her suit that she had promised her PA and one of her best friends that she’d stop the excessive drinking. She’d bared a little part of her soul to him that day and Steve had found it addicting.
“D’you think ‘m good ‘nough for my soulmate?”
“Jarvis, when did the Captain come out of the ice?”
“Toni what—”
but there’s a fancy
He loses Bucky and he blames his soulmate.
She’s inexplicably beautiful.
“I chose to get you, Tony,” The syllables of his name rolls off his tongue smoothly, as if this isn’t one of the very first times he’s saying it, “I was worried. We all were. You hadn’t come up for a long time and we just wanted you to eat. You need to take care of yourself, Tony.”
~~~°~~~
“Come here you sack of bolts.”
Moments later, Rhodes dragged in a protesting Tony Stark before watching him eat the Panini Clint had made an hour prior, before accompanying Tony back to his workshop.
and the
“I’ve done worse Cap, don’t worry about me.”
An hour later, Toni Stark’s smiling face with her glinted eyes and the grease stain on her cheek and her falling apart hair is staring back at him.
Tony surges up and this time, the kiss is chaste and soft and speaks words of ‘
She pulls away and, as naturally as she can, increases her pace just slightly, so that she’s walking off the stage ahead of him, staring determinedly at Natasha’s curled locks.
engraved in neat cursive letters and sees that the black letters on her arm are no longer a
This is who Toni Stark really is.
He stops in his pursuit for the kitchen when he hears the undeniable sound of metal on metal and it should be concerning, his blatant unconcern at the suspicious sound coming from the kitchen at three in the morning but Tony’s tech is secure enough to keep out SHIELD despite the constant efforts to get in; he doubts anyone could get in without Tony knowing.
Tony wrinkles his nose in a manner that shouldn’t be as adorable as it is, “I’m upgrading it, Cap.”
But then somehow there’s a red and gold blur in the sky and Steve doesn’t even know why he’s surprised; this was the man that built some kind of revolutionary technology along with a prototype Iron Man suit in a cave with nearly nothing.
She’s got grease stains on her face and hair and she’s wearing a tank top that looks like its seen better days and shorts that are stained and burnt. Her hair is thrown up in a dishevelled bun that is minutes away from falling apart but she looks so peaceful; comfortable enough to drown out the entire world as she builds and creates and fixes.
His defences go up like steel bars when the room lights up in a dim colour that’s a cross between red and gold and although a part of him appreciates the escape from the darkness, he still unscrambles his brain to reach for his Starkphone to call for an assemble when Jarvis’ voice filters through the speaker system Tony set up, “Lullaby Protocol Engaged.”
He takes great care to stop himself from shoving Natasha over to get eyes on the screen projected in the Hellicarrier. He only briefly reads the diagnostics of the structurally deteriorating building before focusing on the Iron Man suit’s trajectory, straight towards the building that is moments away from collapse.
~~~°~~~
Steve Rogers falls in love with Tony one creation at a time but he’s afraid and unsure and all things in between to take one step forward because Tony is his best friend and he doesn’t want to risk losing it all to three words and the possibility of something more when he already has more of Tony than most do.
Peggy Carter doesn’t care about the black ink on her wrist. Peggy Carter doesn’t want to wait for the universe to assign her a perfect match; Peggy Carter makes her own choices.
He scans the large expanse of a gym and makes his way to the punching bags, all six hanging at a reasonable distance from one another next to the weights, “So you help us as well.”
Natasha raises an eyebrow, “Didn't you set your entire lab on fire once?”
“Intervention,” Natasha walks in while Bruce is putting finishing touches on his curry and holds three straws to Steve, Clint and Thor.
on his wrist, he’s in her space with his hands on her hips and lips a breath away from her own.
Tony grabs something from a drawer and places it on top of the bot’s claw, arranging it so that Steve can see the words hastily written on the plastic cone, “Cleaning Duty.”
Later, after she’s slowly explained the science behind his shield and the magnets, he goes to his room, opens the sketchbook and starts drawing.
Tony scoffs, “She’ll never believe that.”
“Steve,” Natasha’s voice is quiet and calm but he doesn’t open his eyes, opting to feel the burning pain on his wrist that’s not in any way unfamiliar.
“He’s dead?”
1945; He has the Tesseract on the seat beside him and a plane moving too fast for anyone’s good.
Toni rolls her eyes, “Patience Barton, give me a couple more hours. I’ll get them to you by tomorrow.”
The cameras show up twenty minutes later and little Antoinette basks in the affection her father is giving her; ruffling her shoulder-length hair, praising her genius, calling her his daughter.
2011; She signs the last of the documents that would officially make Pepper Co-CEO and retires home, ready to change out of her dress and into a robe to get the sleep that she so desperately needs after two days. She pulls out her earrings and unpins her hair, wiping off the red on her lips and taking off the bracelet on her wrist and freezing.
In the end, it takes nearly losing Tony for him to realize it. They’re called to assemble when large flying insects start breaking things in Manhattan. Steve assigns himself, Clint and Natasha to herd the people into a safe space while the Hulk, Tony and Thor try and contain the enormous mantis-like creatures that serve no bigger purpose than destruction.
She’s long learned that weakness is a curse she cannot afford to have.
– decides to carry a nuke up to space and force him to call out the order that closes the portal and traps the man that presses his every button, scratches his every nerve but was the first person to stare at him without pity and look at him as if he was not helpless in this new world.
“What you doing up Cap?’ Tony asks softly, concerning bleeding through the words without explicit permission.
have to be the one with a dead soulmate!”
She resurfaces minutes later, holding up the shield proudly and hands him a piece of fabric and a glove that he’s to wear on his forearm, “It's part of the new suit.”
“Those are great questions I will never bother to remember. Now, have a great day.”
Tony stops in his quiet murmurings of the gym equipment that Steve secretly itches to use and gasps in a theatrical mock outrage, “And you never told me, J?”
Movie nights are the Avengers drawing straws to decide who’s refilling the popcorn that runs out every ten minutes thanks to Steve, Thor and surprisingly Bruce. Movie nights are Clint falling asleep halfway and Bruce leaving before the end and Natasha painting her nails and Coulson diligently watching while Steve half watches the movie and half listens to Tony’s commentary.
The mission was relatively simple; someone had managed to steal SHIELD’s most classified weapons and the Avengers were called in to neutralize the threat and retrieve the weapons.
He can feel the beginnings of a blush rise, not at what he hopes is the harmless teasing, but at the nature of his thoughts prior, he rubs the back of his neck where the heat is building up, “Sorry.”
The same people who still look like they care.
The Avengers start eating together after that; occasionally going down to Tony’s lab if the engineer doesn’t come up within half an hour. So far, only Natasha and Bruce have had to drag Tony out of his work stupor; normally – or maybe abnormally – Tony has managed to make it to meals in time, even staying behind to fill the silence when Steve’s washing dishes before retreating back into his cave.
“Steve. Steve. Captain!” Natasha harshly yells into his ear and he drops the scum carelessly, allowing himself to be ushered out of the room, only faintly hearing Barton tell the man who is the reason Toni is lying on a hospital bed, motionless and still, “So, do you want to confess or shall I call back the good Captain again?”
The genius barely stays for shawarma, making a flimsy excuse before heading off to her tower, telling them that she’ll see them at SHIELD for the debrief.
“DUM-E, I built him when I was sixteen. I was bored and a little lonely and I needed a helper bot so I got drunk and built him.”
~~~°~~~
He should have known he was screwed right then.
Today is not one of those days.
He knows, as he makes his way down to the thirty-fifth floor, that he has been the only one that has yet to be invited to the lab. Natasha and Bruce have been in there several times and Clint had gone twice to test out the modifications to his new arrows. Even Thor had found himself in the room once, appeasing Toni’s childish curiosity and blowing things up with his lightning.
And then she’s somehow figured out where Loki is and she’s falling out the window, waiting for the cold metal of the suit and it finally comes and aliens have invaded New York.
And it irks Steve, creates a little, reparable pit in his stomach at the notion – the incorrect – notion of drawing straws as if seeing Tony, having Tony eat is comparable to doing laundry or taking out the trash.
The pencil is on paper before he can consciously rethink his action, the strokes becoming an entity of their own. It's well into the morning when he’s done but he deems it worth the effort because he’s afraid that he’d forget the way Toni looked in her sleep.
Steve, however, needs a minute to completely come to terms with the strange pounding in his chest and euphoric dance in his mind.
She looks at him the next morning as she walks out to go to work, standing there conversing with a little boy and signing his t-shirt and she ridicules herself for even hinting that Steve Rogers could be her soulmate.
“Oh shit,” Toni and Pepper look at him but he only has eyes towards his lifelong friend, his little sister, who looks at him amusedly when she realizes he’s finally got it, “Oh shit, that's...that’s good Tones. He’s good, he’d be good for you.”
“You ran out Ms. Stark. The consequences of having things catch on fire every other day.”
She turns her wrist and feels her heart stop pounding as the red is no longer red but black and, in similar, eloquent writing, there is a

, he thinks, and is momentarily confused because this suit is everything that the one in Germany wasn’t. The red and gold is no longer flashy and bright but rather scratched and marked and dirtied and the loud whirring that induced annoyance has disappeared and left behind silence. The faceplate is thrown away somewhere and exposes Tony Stark’s bleeding bruised face; eyes closed and mouth shut and they’ve won, but the world seems
Three-year-old Toni eyed the black ink spanning across her mother’s pale wrist, spelling out the words
She just rolls her eyes, “Ya, I know. Aliens are real and you can't shoot lasers from your eyes. My whole life was a lie.”
“You haven’t listened to me for the past thirteen years Ms. Stark; I've resorted to other measures. Calling Ms. Potts is one of them.”
“Capsicle, it’s ass-o-clock in the morning. Shouldn’t you be getting your nine hours now?”
made of nothing but algorithms that is somehow capable of sarcasm, capable of kindness and humour and caring and his fists start to loosen.
He doesn’t stop to wonder as he spends his days asking and questioning and conversing with the AI, that if the reason why he likes the AI so much has less to do with the fact that this was the kind of future that Howard Stark used to imagine and more to do with the fact that the AI is so
on his wrist, sharp and red.
Tony waves him off but it comes off half-hearted and not anywhere near stubborn, “M’fine Capsicle. Find someone else to mother.”
She abruptly turns and makes her way towards the large table in the middle of the room and he’s unsure of whether he should follow until she starts talking in a stream of jargon he doesn’t understand.
This time, Tony laughs and Steve can hear the drowsy in his voice too, “Goodnight, Steve.”
on the Colonel’s wrist the last time they spoke and Rhodes had adjusted his wrist band.
Obie’s betrayal cuts through her like nothing ever did. He rips her heart out of her chest and for a moment, just for a moment, she gives up. For a split second of a moment, she’s okay with giving up. Then she hears Yinsen and she remembers Pepper and Rhodes and forces her way to her lab. She saves her life, saves the day, and tells everyone she’s Iron Woman.
Turns out, the world knows.
Toni Stark is his soulmate and she’s dying and there isn’t a goddamn thing he can do about it.
Tony Stark, Steve Rogers decides, is everything he hates about the future.
The AI’s response is immediate and not at all what Steve expected, “Of course Sir, I shall relay to Ms. Potts that you are experiencing a delay due to Captain Rogers needing your assistance and that you offer your sincere apologies for your unpunctuality.”
He grabs the blanket draped over the sofa and unfolds it, “yeah? Why did you?”
The door is unlocked when he walks in and the music is obnoxious and loud but it stops a second after he enters.
She rolls her eyes, “Whatever, my soulmate can go fuck himself.”
The archer speaks before Natasha, “Are they done?”
Steve just can’t wait until this is all over.
He knows, from the very little Fury and Natasha has told him, that Howard Stark may have been a brilliant inventor and a phenomenal futurist, but he wasn’t a good father. He’s tried to correlate the man he knew during the war and the man that Toni knew and had failed spectacularly.
Steve nods curtly and then walks into the living room, finding the black Moleskine and the pencil from where he previously left it, before making his way to sit on the kitchen island, sending a small smile to Tony who looks at him curiously before scratching a thin line of black on white.
Some nights are harder than others. Some nights, he’s back in the ice, cold water splashing through his lungs and Peggy’s voice crying out his name. Some nights, he’s back on top the train watching Bucky fall, his fingers just briefly brushing his best friend’s. Some nights it's Natasha, or Bruce or Clint or Thor. Most nights, it Tony.
He finds himself hoping it's not.
wrong than it was when Loki was still unleashing aliens on their planet.
“J, tell me we still have ice.”
“Yep, an
His hair is a tousled mess, sticking at odd corners and Steve’s hands itch to simultaneously arrange it back into place and mess it up even more. The same sentiment goes to the smudge of what looks like engine oil slashing across the mechanic’s cheeks and the stream of grease staining his arms.
1987; She builds her first circuit board at the age of four. It's intricate and she had spent hours and hours of careful construction. She shows her father and he smiles at her for the first time.
All traces of sleep are gone as she makes her way into the lab and pours herself a drink, drowning it in one go and preparing to pour herself another glass before remembering her promise to Pepper and pulling up the schematics for the suit.
With the broken pieces of the circuit on the floor beside her bed and her slightly cracked heart, Antoinette pulls back the sleeves of her shirt and stares at the red ink for a long time.
For a moment, Steve Rogers thinks that maybe this world isn’t so bad after all.
Against better reason, he blurts out the first thought that comes to mind before Tony can spin on his heels and fly away, or take out the phone from his pocket and leave this orbital, “Gym. Is there a gym?”
Maria Stark’s hope did not extend to her daughter, precisely because Howard Stark had diminished any sign of it with belittlements of ‘worthless’ and ‘not enough’ and ‘do better’. It took two more years for Toni to conclude that her soulmate wasn’t yet to be born but dead.
~~~°~~~
Without thinking, he cups her face and rubs the wetness off her cheeks, “Toni,” his tone is sad and imploring and he doesn’t even know what he’s asking for.
She doesn’t realize that she’s smiling and staring until YOU knocks her on the legs and she clears her throat and instructs the bot to hold the Captain’s StarkPad.
, with its bursts of sarcasm and attempt at crass humour and its ease in calling out Steve’s bullshit.
The only good that comes out of her nearly dying is that she gets to create a new element, she sort of makes a friend in Natasha Romanoff and Pepper finally kisses Happy.

The questions are inconsiderate and rude but Steve supposes Toni’s used to it, he’s seen worse things written about her in articles that the genius brushes away without a mere thought and so Steve just follows her lead like the rest of them and stares straight ahead, drowning out the many questions.
They’re moving closer to his floor and she rolls her eyes before dropping her hands, “Stands for shithead, that’s what this is. The universe fucked me over.”
The Avengers live in her tower and she makes sure to avoid the communal area where she knows they all prefer to stay and although she avoids them, she makes sure to keep the fridge restocked with Clint’s favourite yogurt and buy twice the amount of Poptarts and purchase more couches and chairs.
He’s got his hands wrapped around the sniper’s neck. His hand is stained with his soulmate’s blood, his soulmate that’s breathing through a tube and he squeezes harder, watching the man turn purple and his eyes roll back slightly.
Steve Rogers has decades worth of grief etched into his still-thawing heart and loss tattooed on his forehead and perhaps that is why, when Tony Stark’s Iron Man descends with chaos outside a museum in Germany, all too flashy colors, and too loud machinery, and emotionless faceplate and weapons and destruction, it reminds him of everything wrong with this century.
He can feel her eyes on him as they’re brainstorming and, with the anger still fuelling him he asks her, spite clearly evident in his tone, “Can I help you?”
The red is the last thing he sees as he drifts down into the ocean, sinks until his lungs can no longer provide him with enough energy to keep him alive. He grabs onto his wrist and his last thought is that maybe, maybe, this was fate.
Tony’s voice filters through their comms and something painful tugs in Steve’s chest, “I'm reading life signs.”
She doesn’t realize that the far right corner of her workshop now belongs to Steve until weeks later.
She looks at him through narrowed eyes before smiling challengingly, “Don’t remember you being my daddy Rogers,” she puts the second leg up on the table, her gaze daunting, “What? You gonna knock them off?”
She obviously doesn’t care about his anger, “Ya. Can you shoot lasers from your eyes or is that just made up?”
Moments later, as he’s finishing up the careful curls of the lashes above Tony’s eyes, and he hears the hundredth yawn this last minute, he puts down the sketchbook and makes his way back to Tony Stark, who’s now holding two pieces of metal and staring at them as if they contain the answers to the universe.
She doesn’t need a soulmate to be happy.
He brushes back the strands of hair that obscure her face, falling for her a little more when she burrows herself into his hand, “Yeah.”
Her voice is loud and boisterous, creating a ruckus before she even enters the room with the God of Thunder that had stepped outside for some air.
He looks towards Fury, who waits with his hands behind his back, still and patient, “Are we waiting on someone.”
The voice pauses for a moment, as if registering his aggressive stance, and when it continues, Steve can swear he hears an amused, almost smug tone that accompanies the words.
