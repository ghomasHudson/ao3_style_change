Mike had to do something. This was just too painful to watch. He looked at Divya and his round face lit up like the Christmas tree.
So then the question becomes, what should I work on next? I have several ideas and this is your chance to chime in with what you'd like to see me do next. So post in the comments with which one of these stories you'd like to see after the author AU. They are all Johnlock.
Mummy managed to look even more smug. "Even better. Yes, it's brilliant, and I can sleep soundly knowing that my two boys are safe."
Sherlock and Anderson followed on his heels. They found him leaning up against the wall, rocking back and forth, still covering his ears.
Bertie grimaced at the amount, but while he wanted to haggle the price down, he knew that Greg had a point and if he wanted to win that bet with Jim, he was gonna have to pony up. So he dug into his wallet and pulled out the other £80.
"They weren't kind, and when it came out that William Scott was Sherlock Holmes it became a shitstorm," Sherlock said.
John had learned to get over those fairly quickly, but he would grit his teeth as Mrs Hudson fawned over this man and they talked and talked. God only knew what it was they talked about, John tried to ignore them. Plus, he didn't have leisure to chat when he had
"You can have him, he's annoying," Mycroft replied. He opened his bottle and took a long gulp of water.
John continued not to say anything when the flirting intensified. Well, not to Mary anyway. He begged, he pleaded and he threatened Mrs Hudson to tell Sherlock she didn't like strawberry scones. To no avail.
Greg walked through the doors of Club Dio and was blasted with the sounds of earsplitting Indie rock and rowdy fans. He scanned the room and immediately spotted Mycroft on the dance floor. He had dressed up in a white button up shirt, sleeves rolled up, and chains and leather bands graced his slender wrists. The red silk brocade waistcoat was paired with dark jeans and trainers. Mycroft was dancing with Anthea and looked like he was actually having fun.
"Of course he's going to say yes, Sherlock," Mike said. "Now go get him." He thumped Sherlock on the back and stood to the side to let Sherlock pass.
Which was why John was sitting in the library, his leg bouncing up and down nervously, his heel tapping against the leg of the chair as he waited for Sherlock so they could start their French lesson.
John laughed rocking back on his heels. "He's hardly a child; he's thirty. But yes, him." He was suddenly buzzing with joy and excitement.
John and Sherlock just shrugged and went for it. Bertie limped away, no one caring about him at all.
Sherlock's phone rang, but he let go to voicemail. It immediately rang again. He looked at his watch, "Oh no! Is that the time?"
"I can't believe prom is almost here," Sherlock sighed. "It's almost to the point where all the good suits and tuxes will be gone."
"Well, it only lasted until that summer. I went out to his father's place. His father heard about what I do with the deductions. After much goading on both their parts, I caved in and deduced Mr Trevor."
Greg grabbed his plate and went to dispose of the food he was never going to eat. His skin itched. Despite what he told John and Mike, he wasn't sure that Mycroft would be forgiving for Saturday with this little stunt of his. But that laugh was enough to make it all worth it.
Sherlock shook his head, "She's fine, just frightened. That was the last straw for Lestrade, actually."
"Not ever, Sherlock," John breathed, his face coming close to Sherlock's. "Because I love you." He used his hand that was tangled in Sherlock's hair to bring the tall detective to his lips.
"And as for the notion that another stalker might come after me, may I remind you that my meddling, interfering, older brother has provided the security for this trip, I doubt I'll be able to sneeze without him knowing." Sherlock bumped his shoulder into John's. "We'll be fine, John," he whispered.
"Oh," she replied, a small smile creeping up on her face. She smirked and then walked back out to the store, a spring in her step.
John didn't know what to do. He had let his temper get the best of him and now what might be his only shot of getting his book published somewhere other than online had gone out the window.
"I am," John said with a shit-eating grin. He looked at his watch. "And you aren't worth the time, speaking of which. Greg will kill us if we're late to his and Molly's wedding."
So let me know in the comments which one you think I should do next and I'll let you know in the chapter which one it is. :D
They nuzzled for a moment. "All right, I can tell that you really want to tell me how he paid for things," John muttered. "So go on, impress me."
For you see this chapter isn't in the finished story. It was added whole cloth because Sherlock and John's relationship went way too fast. And the story suffered for it. So I took bits (really small bits, more like nibbles) that I had edited out and created two new scenes to put those nibbles in. But because it wasn't written at the same time as the rest of the story it needed a bit more love to whip it into shape.
John raised both eyebrows before he caught on to whom Sherlock was referring. "You mean Cathy?" When Sherlock nodded, he said, "Uh...yeah, no. Turns out that not only was she trying to use me to boost her own career, she was also sleeping with at least two other rugby players, a footballer, a photographer, and her publicist. I don't know how she managed it; honestly, it sounded exhausting."
"My sister is an alcoholic, I know what people look like when they are jonesing for a fix. Trust me, you display none of the signs."
"Yeah," John said, cocking his head to the side in confusion. "I wanted to thank you all for being so supportive over the last couple of months, as I know it couldn't have been easy picking up the slack when I had last-minute meetings with my agent and my editor. So I invited all three of you."
Mycroft was doing his homework in the front room, headphones blaring his favorite band. The front door opened, and his mother walked in carrying the mail.
Mycroft was so absorbed in his task of brushing down his horse that it took him a few minutes to notice the boy watching him. He rolled his eyes and squared his shoulders. He turned to face Greg, mask firmly in place.
And then it came. It was tucked between a bill and an ad for weight loss. It wasn't an acceptance letter. Not really, but the publisher wanted to meet with him to discuss the possibility of releasing it. But it was still exciting.
James and Mrs Hudson shared a knowing glance but wisely said nothing when the young nurse stomped her foot.
"That was my thought as well," Sherlock said, resigned. He sighed. "I think he's doing it to get my attention."
Apparently the doctor had decided to dress nicely for Sherlock's party. He was wearing dark jeans, a blue plaid button up and a black v-neck jumper. Sherlock's pulse began to race as his mind threatened to derail.
"Not at all," Mycroft said, glaring at Sherlock. "But I'm afraid something has come up and I am unable to make our meeting."
John kissed him. "Never, darling." He buried his head into Sherlock's throat and began sucking as he repeated the movement with his hips. Undulating and writhing, they panted and moaned, their pleasure making them breathless with want and need.
Mycroft huffed. "I'm not sure either one would have classified their relationship as such, but yes." John's other eyebrow raced up to mirror its mate, eyes wide in shock.
Of course that went out the window the second Sherlock walked in. John leapt to his feet to greet the publicist. He had forgotten how good-looking the man was. He cut quite the figure in his designer suit and tousled curls. And John was standing before he even knew what happened.
"Thank you for battling that troll for me. I would have said something in the shop, but Mrs Hudson would have started planning our wedding if I had.-SH"
He rounded a corner and came face to face to a very smug Bertie, his arm draped over Sherlock's shoulders possessively.
But soon it was time for Mike's plan. John had been against it, but Mike insisted Sherlock needed a grand gesture.
Greg blinked at him and cocked his head to the side. He stood up slowly, menacingly, "What? Am I not pretty?"
John knew then, that Mike had been right, Sherlock Holmes required grand gestures. He really needed to thank his friend.
"He told me that when I got with John that if we got married, he didn't want to be anywhere near the bridal party. He wanted to film the whole thing."
Sherlock had been in his mind palace since John snuck off to work. There was only one option left, but he didn't think he could go back to that. Running around the world chasing down the remnants of Moriarty's cell had taken a rather sizable chunk out of his soul, and he wasn't sure he could give any more. Plus that meant asking Mycroft for help.
"'Once you've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth'," Mike dutifully quoted.
John leveled a steely glare at the elder Holmes, "And you won't get it, either. I was a soldier, you forget. I know that sometimes you have to do whatever it takes to survive."
"You won't fall asleep. If nothing else, Sherlock in tights will keep you awake," Mike said with a chuckle.
"So you're an editor?" John asked, clamping his jaw around telling this man that he had written a book. Shercroft was going to provide him an editor, and telling this complete stranger he was going to be published felt too much like bragging.
John looked behind him, remembering. "When Mycroft said..." he took a deep breath. "I am an idiot. Come with me."
"I'm proud of you," Mycroft whispered fiercely in Sherlock's ear and kissed the top of his head. "Taking the leap into writing is frightening enough the first time, but to try a second time? That takes real courage."
"Why is it so hot?" Sherlock complained. "Oh my god!" One hand fell to the floor, while the other he draped dramatically over his eyes like a swooning maiden. He lifted his knee and the bottom length of the robe dove to the ground exposing the long line of his legs and a hint of the black pants he wore.
"Hey," John greeted. "You're awake. I was just going to let you sleep. The thunder doesn't seem to worry you if you're sleeping."
John's libido fought with his brain over what he should be paying attention to. His brain knew that he had to listen to what Sherlock was teaching, otherwise this would be a complete cock-up. His libido was firmly telling his brain to just let the rich baritone wash over him and let his lizard brain take over. John's brain won, but barely.
"Nah," Mike said, coming further into the room. "It doesn't show when you're out there." He tossed his head the direction of the party.
Sherlock blushed. "I kept reading those two lines over and over again, because it gave me hope that you might feel the same."
John supposed it was where he came from. Most of the people in this room had been born to money. But he still remembered what it was like to be poor. It's why he loved his and Sherlock's new home. It was quiet and respectable, it didn't scream money or affluence, and that made it perfect. Yes, his lover came from money, but Sherlock didn't enjoy these kinds of parties, either. The only reason he had come to the last one was that Victor had dragged him.
John stepped closer to see that it was a black jock strap. "So, it's a jock strap, doesn't your brother ride horses?"
John grinned. He pulled Sherlock to his feet. The detective wobbled, but before he could fall, John caught him and scooped him up by the legs.
Bertie strolled up to Greg with all the confidence of the perpetually dense. Brazen and without care.
Sherlock nodded. John was only gone a couple minutes before he returned in a long-sleeved t-shirt and sweat trousers. Again John picked up Sherlock bridal style, but this time Sherlock was ready for it and immediately clung to the good doctor.
Before the discussion got too heated Janine stepped between them and turned to John. "So where are we going?"
Mike and Divya were next. They were delighted to be invited. They hoped that they would see their unexpected guests again.
"How can I trust you?" Mycroft asked. He squeezed his eyes closed and opened them slowly. "Why did I think I could?" He ran off, Greg losing him almost immediately in the crowd. As he went up on his toes to see if he could see over the heads of the other students, he spotted Sherlock.
A giggle bubbled to her lips before she could stop it. John's eyes snapped up and the small smile slipped off her face.
Mrs Holmes was really excited as well; she had been telling all her friends what a good son Sherlock was to take her to this fancy new place for her birthday.
John nodded. When he wasn't working with Sherlock he was down at the pub with one group of friends or another.
"Enculer" (according to the French swear word site I found) is like "Putain" or fuck, but a more commonly used term. It's like the formal vous and the informal tu. Enculer is more informal and something that Greg would be more likely to use.
Although, the one thing that had convinced Sherlock to come was a promise. One, that John had a feeling meant more than what was on the surface.
Sherlock ran his fingers through his hair. "I'll be all right," Sherlock said. "It will only be for a couple of weeks and then I'll be back before you know it."
"Brilliant," Mycroft said brightly. "Now, where was I? Oh yes! John's book is doing wonderfully and I eagerly await the next book." He winked at John. "I look forward to working with him on all his future novels."
The two men stood waiting at the door. Then the thumping returned, a little weaker, a little more desperate. As they were now closer to the sound, they could hear plaintive cries for help over the shrieking of the wind.
Coming back from Afghanistan was even more hair-raising than the actual war. At least there John didn't have to worry about moving out of someone's way, only to find other people staring at him funny because the person he stepped aside for wasn't really there. Or the ghosts that would stand on street corner, in hallways, or in the middle of the room and scream. Just scream, nothing else.
Watson. John tried to figure out what it all meant, but before he could fully latch onto the thought, the tent flap burst open and in walked Murray.
John fidgeted with his cane nervously as he waited for the train that would take him out to the apparently grand estate of the owner of Shercroft Publishing. Mr M Holmes had paid for John's ticket and had told him that there would be someone waiting at the train station to take him to the house out in Sussex.
"Our rent is her only income. She doesn't have a pension, and all her husband's assets were frozen when he was arrested," Sherlock shook his head again. "No, John. I am quite happy to rent it from her until the day she dies."
Just then the polo ball came whizzing past Greg's head. Greg looked up and Mycroft sneered, saluted with his mallet, and rode off.
John sat down on the chair hard. He had fixed his own limp, hadn't he? Well, maybe not entirely on his own. Sherlock over the course of that week had finally given him something outward to focus on. Even his writing was inward, a reflection of his injury. But Sherlock Holmes had changed all that.
Sherlock closed his eyes. "I really don't want to get into it today. I'll talk to you later, all right?"
"That's because I'm older, I've been in your shoes. Now go out there and dance with all your heart. Show him that no matter who he's with and why, you are worth it."
Mike shrugged. “So what are you going to do?” He held out his hand to John. The rugby player took it and let Mike help him stand.
"John is the blond; as David pointed out they are all in the medical profession, but his style is different from Mike, the chubby civilian. He immediately took charge, could be the head of an A&E, but his close-cropped hair and the fact that he is currently standing at parade rest suggests military. Recently out. I'd say about a year and from the way he favors his left shoulder, invalided out."
"And graphic designer," Sherlock admitted. "I can't stand it when book covers get it wrong, so for certain clientele I'll design the paperback and dust covers for their books, and I sign off on the covers of all our other books from our in-house graphic designers."
"You know, parents don't like it when they have to admit that they need to let their children make their own decisions. Sherlock at least lets me play a couple of rounds, but you've had me on the bench for years."
"Thank you," Sherlock told him, putting everything he felt for this former soldier in those two simple words.
"Yeah," John agreed. "It was the sudden change. The last time my life changed so dramatically I had been shot in the shoulder and left to die in a fucking desert."
Which of course meant that anything to do with booze was out. John sighed heavily. He had spotted a cute novelty mug, but had put it back when he realized that she would only fill it with the hardest liquor she could find.
John was taken aback. "You didn't eat that much, and it makes me happy that you enjoyed the dinner."
“Shite, Watson! I’ll be sore for hours, even with the Doc’s help,” Bill Murray complained. Bill was one of their best players and John’s best friend.
"Not the sparring. Takes way too much makeup to cover any bruises and scrapes that I would get in the ring, but I keep up with exercises."
John ignored her and led the way back to his table. He wished that Sherlock had stuck around for the whole thing, but the detective had left. And John had the feeling that everything had just gone to hell.
And John ached for it. The gentle brush of fingers as they passed each other things; tea, pens, phones. But now Sherlock went out his way to make sure that he grabbed the farthermost end of the object. The brushing of arms or hands as they walked down the street, gone now as Sherlock kept at least six inches from John. The pressing on John's back to make him go faster, now he was just left behind.
"Tell Sally, maybe it's because he doesn't like her that he doesn't answer," Sherlock said with a shrug, before he opened the door to the waiting car and slid in. Anderson continued to rant, but Sherlock closed the door to instant quiet. He tapped on the ceiling of the car to signal the driver. The car pulled away from the curb and started making its back to London.
Sherlock opened the manuscript of "The War of One" by JH Watson on Mycroft's desk and flipped to the first page. "Right, the first line should hook the reader into the story. There is a reason 'It was a dark and stormy night' is a trope. It hooks the reader into knowing what kind of story they are about to get into. However, your first line is all tell and no show."
Sherlock gave it a squeeze. "And you were right about people being awful. Sally wasn't really my friend and Bertie had a bet with Jim that he'd fuck me."
"Yeah, yeah," Bertie replied. "£500 should about cover it. Anything over that and you're on your own." He pulled out a wad of cash and thrust it at Greg.
John chuckled. "All right, I'm sorry." He ran his fingers through Sherlock's hair to soothe him. "I'll be back in a moment. I'll go and get ready for bed, then we'll head to bed together, okay?"
The next day saw Sherlock in the reading room pouring over books on how to take care of the hives that were still on the property, and John pacing in the bedroom, muttering to himself and clutching an envelope to his chest.
He had used up nearly the whole roll when he heard a light laugh behind him. Sarah, his boss was nearly doubled over with mirth.
Out of the corner of his eye, Greg saw Mycroft start to lean too far off the bench and dashed to catch him again.
The party went smoother after that. And Sherlock felt that maybe, just maybe, as long as John was around, he'd be happy to celebrate his birthday in the future.
"I never said you couldn't leave, Sherlock. I just said you couldn't go chasing criminals. Tell you what, why don't we order some Thai, and then take a stroll through Regent's Park while we wait for the delivery. That way you can deduce all the other people and you can tell me all their dirty little secrets."
She was going to bring her latest boyfriend to the Christmas party. John really hoped this one was a keeper. He wanted her to be as happy with this new fellow as he was with Sherlock. Not that he thought that was possible.
"Oh shush!" Sherlock growled at his brother. "A stranger then. Someone who hadn't known me for years."
Sherlock slowly, painstakingly removed John from his clothing. He helped his lover get into the tub before dropping his dressing gown to the floor.
"We are doing fine," Sherlock growled. "May I remind you, we aren't small time, and haven't been in over thirty years. We have our own e-book line and are adding more and more books from our catalogue every day. I do not need a handout or pittance from anyone, least of all, Whiphand Publishing."
But he felt it went deeper than that. If it was just arguing with Sherlock, then his limp would have been completely gone before his week-long sojourn in Sussex. But it took defending the man and his book to really kick the cane to the curb.
"Tomorrow is the 29th," John said, turning briefly to smile at Sherlock before returning his eyes to the front.
John smiled and sighed happily. Despite it all, the chaos and the missed opportunities, this was the perfect ending for the year.
A few minutes passed before the phone erupted in his hand. He looked at the phone, his brother was actually calling him.
John glanced to where the tall politician was strolling toward them swinging his umbrella back and forth like a pendulum. Mycroft was not his usual self. He looked very ruffled for a man who was usually so put together.
"It means instead of saying a character is sad, say that the character's shoulders were rounded as he clutched his chest, tears streamed down his face as he choked out a sob," Sherlock replied.
"If he were to agree to never do it again, would you be willing to work with him on the rare occasion I may be unavailable?"
"All drinks are on the house," Angelo said proudly. "And I will personally oversee your meal tonight."
There were some other mumbled words from the official and the exchanging of rings, then finally after what felt like ages, the official pronounced them husbands and that they could finally kiss.
But even he was surprised when the editor picked up a throw pillow and tossed it and couple of its fellows into the crowd.
Because of some mix up or another with Sherlock's flight, it was actually John who ended up leaving on tour first.
John thumbed through them and grimaced. There were a lot of Indie punk with really weird names in the pile.
"That's in the past. You made it. You came out on the other side a better person. And he's just a bitter old man. "
Mycroft opened his mouth to retort but closed it when Greg raised an eyebrow. Mycroft turned his head to the side and pouted. "Mummy."
He closed the book and held it to his chest. "This means a lot to me." He looked down at his shoes. "Did you–I mean, have you seen my book's acknowledgment?"
"So did you come to the bookshop to see Mrs Hudson, or to check me out before you took me on?" John asked, moving to sit down in one of the chairs in front of Greg's desk.
"Don't worry," John said as he moved to sit down, "My plans for tonight are very earthly, and if I'm lucky, things might even get outright dirty."
"I don't know what I would do if someone told me I couldn't play guitar anymore," Mycroft said, pained. "So what did you do?"
Mycroft was in his office, standing over his desk getting ready to leave for the Diogenes, when Anthea poked her head in.
"Oh, Mr Holmes," Prof. Weston said, "I forgot that you were tutoring Mr Watson in here today. I was just going to get the lab ready for my classes tomorrow."
Dillon was 6'4 and built like a tank. He did not look happy to John at all. "I thought I told you to take the week off, John," he growled.
"Sherlock, I need to speak to you in private," Mycroft said, in a voice that brooked no argument. He turned to John. "Please continue to eat and drink your fill. And then please join us in my study." He pointed behind him. "It's that room there."
"So what? And this time was an exception, too?" Mycroft asked, trying to get around Greg, who still refused to budge.
He'd wear one of his black suits with the purple shirt or maybe the blue one. No, wait! He went digging in the back of his closet. He pulled out a pair of black jeans and pulled them on. They still fit. He had bought them for a case a few months back for a disguise and hadn't worn them since. But they did wonders for his arse. He went for a classic white button up and paired it with a sports coat.
Sherlock laughed. "At least I won't be bored." He threw the remains of the cigarette he was smoking to the curb and lit another. "What's next?"
"Hello, Mrs Holmes," Bertie greeted warmly, "I'm Bertie Gruner and I'm here to pick up Sherlock for prom."
"Good," John said, "Hmm...since we finished our session at five last time, I think we should aim for eight for our date. How does that sound?"
Mr Holmes cocked his head to the side. "I would have never pegged you for an army man, what division were you in?"
He sought Mycroft first, figuring that if Mycroft was as drunk as he appeared then Sherlock could drive home. He wasn't seventeen yet, but he had his provisional license and could use the practice.
She stood up and grabbed her briefcase. "You'll change your tune once things start failing, and they will." Irene pointed at the contract. "You keep that, you'll need it."
John tapped his foot impatiently, refusing to do the toddler potty dance, but the need was starting to get a bit dire. Mycroft was the next to emerge from the bedrooms. He glared at John and the closed door to the bathroom.
Dr. Mike Stamford chuckled. “So did you go to that restaurant I suggested?” he asked, as he worked lotion into a tight muscle on Bill’s thigh.
She just shook her head and said nothing the rest of the trip. The car rolled to a near-silent standstill and she indicated that this was his stop. He got out and looked around. He was in a nice neighborhood, stately without being pretentious. That's when he realized that he was looking up at Mycroft's home.
"Hey, John," Sherlock murmured. "So...um...do you remember that printer I was having trouble with that first time we had dinner at your place?"
"I don't believe that voicing one's opinion can be classified as a terrorist action," Mycroft argued.
Mummy raised an eyebrow and cocked her head, "Is that what they are calling it these days?" She waved at their outfits. Sally was wearing a tight, red sleeveless dress and Sherlock was wearing tight black jeans, a dark blue v-neck t-shirt, and black leather jacket.
Bertie reached up and stroked Sherlock's cheek, "Don't you worry your pretty head about that. I've got it all under control."
The maitre d' rolled her eyes and then spoke slowly, "Because this is an upscale restaurant. If you want to take your mother out to dinner, go to some franchise."
No, what had gone horribly, horribly wrong was the fact that Mary had arrived at the club with a new boyfriend in tow. She clearly had a type. He was blond and on the shorter side, but the man was built like a brick house. On his forearm was a tattoo of the Royal Marines.
"I could just ride the horse back to the school and have the owners pick him up there," Greg said with a smile.
"Hello, John," the apparition muttered, sounding like the politician, but not. The voice that came was weary and rough, like someone who had been crying for hours or someone who hadn't spoken in days.
"All kidding aside, I just don't like doing what expected of me. Why go the ways others want me to go, when I can go my own way."
"Well, considering we're both gay, you don't want me anywhere near them anyway," Sherlock pointed out.
"Tomorrow," he admitted. "But I wanted..." Sherlock didn't know how to finish that sentence, to convey his desire to spend time with John. "I was wondering if you, perhaps..." again he trailed off, unsure.
Sherlock nudged the door open with his foot and the two of them awkwardly walked into the flat. They took several steps before John stopped them. Sherlock could feel John's intake of breath before he removed his hands from Sherlock's eyes.
"That, and the head publicist was actually incompetent," Sherlock said with a grin. "He was out my first day as intern to his office and Mrs Hudson came in."
"She seems to think it is funny. Just a little schoolgirl crush that Mary'll get over," John ground out.
"Have we got enough food for our four unexpected guests?" John asked, instantly going for the coffee machine and getting it started as well as turning on the kettle for the tea drinkers.
But it appeared that whatever higher power was out there decided to torment Sherlock instead. As the players came off the field, John dashed up to the VIP box. He banged on it and then motioned to have Sherlock meet him in the corridor. Sherlock sighed heavily.
John slicked up his lover first and then himself. He slowly levered himself forward until he pierced the outer ring. Sherlock cried out and John stopped to let his lover get used to the feeling. Once Sherlock gave the go ahead, John slid all the way in and they both moaned.
Sherlock picked the phone back up and checked the notification. It was an email from his brother. He opened it up; in it was all the marketing information for John's book, which included (to his chagrin or elation he wasn't sure) all of John's contact information. Including his email and phone number. He didn't know whether to kill Mycroft or send him flowers in thanks.
"I'm sure she would," John agreed. "Not that this hasn't been fun and all, but it's going to be nice to have time to myself."
"I've slept over at my boyfriend's flat before, but I doubt that's what you mean here," Sherlock said with a shrug.
A real problem that was starting to manifest below his waist. Just thinking about those thick curls, those long eyelashes that framed those amazing technicolored eyes, that long, lean body, whose legs went on for miles. Yes, it was a real problem.
"Mhmm," Sherlock agreed, licking into John's mouth. Kisses became heated and soon they were lost to the world.
"The Key to the Castle in the Air"- struggling writer John hates the stuck up prick that comes to the bookshop he works in every morning. When John's book is picked up by Shercroft Publishing he is sent out to Sussex to go over the book. But when Mycroft has to rush off, it is up to little brother, Sherlock to finish the meeting with John. That self-same prick that drives John up the wall.
John itched to take Sherlock's hand again. He could still feel the warmth of the other man's touch on his palm. A warmth that was working its way into John's blood and warming his heart in ways he didn't believe was possible after being forced to leave the army.
Mycroft pulled up to the school and opened the door, getting out the car. Greg followed suit and they faced each over the car.
"It seemed to have worked," Greg pointed out. "Mycroft will remember me being tackled by Mr Hope and Mr Winters far quicker than he'll remember that I didn't kiss him that one time."
Julie opened her mouth to squawk, but Barbara held up her hand. "I have given you too many chances as it is. Go."
Anthea browsed some more before deciding on the first dress, the wine gown. She supposed that she should have picked something more Shakespearean, but she didn't think that a dress from that time period would fit through the doors at school.
"Otherwise I'll force one of you lot to do the speech on my behalf, and I'm sure no one wants that," Mycroft warned. There was a lot of shaking of heads and murmuring the negative.
Mycroft had outdone himself with his attire for the evening. The boy tended to favor perfectly tailored waistcoats, and tonight was no exception. The waistcoat and trousers were of a blue-grey. When Mycroft turned around, Greg could see that the silk back of the waistcoat was purple, which looked stunning against the charcoal grey of the boy's button-up shirt. The sleeves were rolled up to his elbows and showed off the bangles and leather bracelets around his thin pale wrists.
Greg stopped as the light bulb lit above his head. That was perfect, and he knew just who to ask to pull this off.
"Richard Brook, the alias of the criminal Jim Moriarty, was booked on all charges. He is currently in the Pentonville prison awaiting trail. Up next, Dr John Watson."
John bit back a snarling comment about how he was a soldier not an English teacher and wrote down that they would be providing an editor.
Sherlock blushed. He looked furtively at Molly and Mike and then down at the floor, feeling very embarrassed. He should have realized that John wouldn't bring a
"Mycroft is an idiot if he thinks that Greg doesn't have genuine feelings for him, but then he's been burned before."
John brought Sherlock down for a kiss and then said, "Meaning that I will be in charge of your Valentine's Days for the foreseeable future."
He managed to sneak past the ladies in reception, but before he could make it into his office, he was waylaid by his boss standing in front of him, arms folded in front of his chest. John looked up to see Dr Dillon Janzek glaring down at him.
Sherlock came to stand next to Mary and John, shifting from one foot to the other. Mary looked him over and then laughed. Sherlock's back stiffened and he glared at her. He opened his mouth and then looked over at Greg, who shook his head.
Sherlock sucked in a hiss of breath. The former soldier in person was nothing like his photos. He wasn't the confident army medic with a wink in his eye and a cocky grin, nor was he the haggard, pale sickly thing from the photos taken post-op. He still had his deadly stare and tan skin, but he walked a little more gingerly, greeted the world with a little bit more caution; and Sherlock was awed.
Hello, my darlings. Did you miss me? I missed you all terribly. The problem I've found, writing depressed, is not knowing exactly how much I have written down, so I'm always surprised how much I actually have when I start typing it up. Which in this case was almost two full chapters. I just have one more scene to write for the next chapter and nine will be up before you know it. Well, you know, provided I don't get sick or forget or whatever.
"Please!" she cried, "Take it out‒" the two boys that were fighting crashed through the patio doors and on the lawn. "Side." Sarah sighed heavily. "Thank you," she called weakly.
"Oh, I do," Sherlock practically purred. John shivered, he loved that tone of voice in his husband. It meant an idiot was about to be laid low.
"Your book, or rather you," John said firmly. "I'm betting you don't have many supporters for your book or even in your life in general." Sherlock shook his head. "And since I've gotten to know you and reading your book, I came to the realization that I want to be someone you can count on and I hope you'll let me."
"Sherlock Darling!" she squealed. "I had begun to despair that you wouldn't be coming back to my humble little shop."
"Now, listen here," John said, his voice cold and piercing as steel. "Sherlock has been nothing but supportive and he never faked sympathy to get in my pants."
"Yeah, we have art together with Miss Wenceslas, right?" John asked, trying to keep the conversation going. He coughed, "Uh, um...wow. Sherlock, you look amazing."
John kissed him over and over, then swung Sherlock around in his arms, the dancer laughing out loud.
Hello! Anybody there? I hope so. That was not how I wanted this to go, I assure you. So first I can't find a reliable source to the movie. Which meant I had to wait until I had the money to buy it. And after winning a gift card from my work's costume contest (I was the Queen of Hearts), I was able to buy the DVD. And then it took Amazon a WEEK to get it to me. I even have Prime. Grrr. And then when I finally have the movie in hand, I get hella sick. Like going to the doctor, staying home several days from work, losing my voice sick. And was down for three weeks. After all that I was able to watch the movie and finish this chapter. I just hope it was worth the wait.
"Hey," John said, cupping Sherlock's cheek and gently moving his head so John could see the expression on its face clearly. "Did you think I brought someone else?"
John pulled out the bottle of wine he had been saving all year and poured them each a glass, bringing Sherlock's to where the detective WAS carving the turkey. Sherlock put down the fork and took a brief sip.
Why was it so hard for John to ask for what he wanted? What he really wanted. Of course, Sherlock thought that it was wanting his family back. But that ship had sailed.
John showed up to the after party late because he was trying to make sure that Mary wouldn't do something stupid. He called her roommates and let them know what had happened. They didn't seem surprised. John had also called her brother, who was listed on her CV as emergency contact, and let him know what had happened. Again, he seemed more resigned than surprised. John thought briefly about calling the cops, but he didn't want her in trouble, he had just wanted to make sure she was okay.
"Because my dad would kill me if he thought I was going to a party," John explained with a wince. "So I told him I was spending the night here."
But as Sherlock asked around, no one had seen Mycroft since the table dance and the 'crowd surfing' some claimed that he'd done. Others said he'd fallen off the table. Some said that he stumbled out on his own, others said someone had dragged him away.
John peered around him and saw Sherlock talking to Mrs Hudson. He smiled. "Yeah, that's him. What do you think?"
"At least we weren't the only ones," Sherlock thumbed at the blond behind him, "this idiot got stuck in the snow in a sports car at the bottom of the hill."
"You got me a present, too?" John asked, in shock. "You didn't have to do that, you being here is gift enough."
"Good memory," Sherlock replied. "Mainly with what you ask for but also...a teensy bit of card counting."
"Made a mistake so costly that about two hundred and fifty to three hundred books need to be pulped," Sherlock replied wearily.
"I've never had someone break me out of detention before," Greg said when Mycroft drew close to the car. "But then again, I'm not usually
A reply came within minutes of Sherlock's message's departure. And the whole time the publicist sat in panic, almost typing out another text message apologizing for his error in judgement, but each time he would chicken out.
Sherlock cast his eyes over the room. He spotted "Griffin's Steps" on John's side table. "I didn't realize that you still had it." He picked it up to look at it.
She blushed and then pushed at him gently. "One healthy, happy relationship and suddenly you're an expert?"
And then let the woman lead him to a car. She slid in on one side and John on the other. The lizard side of his brain was telling him to ask for her number, while his actual brain was practically screaming for him not to. He told the lizard brain to shut up and ended up making small talk instead.
John's grin slipped off his face and he shifted to free one of his arms to cover Sherlock's hand with his own.
"Have you thought about where you are going to stay until you find a new place, love?" John asked Sherlock.
They spent a few more years at Baker Street, until Mrs Hudson passed away. They packed up and moved out to Sussex Downs to the cottage John bought when he proposed, all those years ago. It was time to get away from the city. Far too many people still knew their address and would come to them with problems. And they wanted to get as far from that as they could.
John heaved out a massive sigh. "Right, if I'm going to survive this, I'm going to need a few things. First, where is the nearest bathroom?"
John shook his head. "I figured you'd get there eventually. I, uh...got the impression from other people you weren't the sort to normally
John rushed home to tidy up the flat and get everything ready for his first actual date with Sherlock.
"He's that confident that you won't be able to spot his fakery; also he's not aware of our little secret fact checker," Mike said, grinning.
John shook his head, "Evidently, two years is long enough for the insurance company to believe I spent it all. That or Mycroft intervened."
Mycroft wove through the crowd, cursing Lestrade, Sherlock, their mother, and Anthea for getting him into this mess. Mycroft shook his head. Where did this all go wrong? He wanted cry. Instead he took a deep breath and went looking for a way out. He picked a doorway, but that proved to be the wrong choice, as Bertie was in it.
"So when will you be home?" John ached to see him face to face. They would live chat sometimes but it wasn't like being able to brush their fingers together or rub shoulders in the cab.
"So that's two. How do we know that the chubby one is called Mike? Because when the door opened John yelled 'We have to do something, Mike!' when the chubby one protested helping strangers. Now, that could have been any of the girls. Mike can be short for Michaela but we know that the blonde is Mary as David the Idiot told us. And Molly is the mousy thing who was offended at his suggestion being her partner for the holiday. That leaves the Indian woman and the chubby doctor. And since it was the two men at the door and the women didn't come until called, Mike it is. Which leaves the remaining lovely lady. Mike told a Divya to get the blankets, that tells us that she is Divya."
John's focus was pulled off Sherlock and back to the present. "Huh? Oh, sorry. I hope you guys like burgers, Toby's has the best burgers in Soho."
"You'll do fine," Mycroft assured him and patted him on the shoulder. "If you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I have to be going."
"You'll be fine, John," Bill soothed. "Just limit the alcohol and eat in small bites. Deep breaths and stand straight. You've got this."
"Hey, welcome to the first of what I hope to be many of these events," John said. He cleared his throat. "The book is called 'The War of One' and it is about a man lost in the desert who stumbles onto a magical world where words are weapons and silence is the most prized possession."
John started to read and a hush descended on the shop, allowing him to weave his tale. When he stopped, there was a quiet, like the crowd was holding its collective breath, and then there was applause.
Just then a dark-haired boy walked past talking to a black girl. "And what group do they belong in?" John asked with a low whistle.
David smirked as he threw out both his arms and settled firmly between the women. John wasn't about to let David the Idiot ruin his Christmas. He sat down in the arm chair next to Mary's side of the sofa and quick as wink, grabbed her arm and hauled her on his lap. She let out a startled laugh and then made herself comfortable. Molly looked at David and then rolled her eyes. She stood up and sat next to the tree to pass out presents.
Her face went through several emotions, disbelief, horror, and then finally settled on rage. She raised her arms to tear out of John's grasp, and howled as she broke free. John immediately brought his hands up to protect himself, sure she meant to hit him.
He grabbed his dance bag and stomped out of his flat. Or as much as someone could who had spent his whole life learning how to tread lightly.
It was exhausting being with her. She was always rude to people that she didn’t think were on her “level”. It was like that old adage, “If you want to see a person for how they really are, watch how they treat others less than themselves.” And boy, was she awful.
Mycroft just smiled tightly. "There is one thing you need to know. You are only allowed to take out a thousand pounds per thirty days."
Ajay went to the ice box and pulled them out for him. As he was handing over the bottles, Greg asked, "A bit thirsty, are you?"
Their hands lingered a fraction too long to be considered friendly, but if anyone noticed, no one said a thing.
John nodded and spotted the older boy playing pool, drinking and smoking. When Greg noticed them, he moved over to a table and ordered them some fish and chips and a pint if they wanted.
The original plan was to have an event every month that showed them falling more in love with each other. Only I got June and went "fuck it!" and threw my hand in the air in defeat. I just couldn't come up with twelve unique moments. So if the first two chapters feel tighter, time wise, that would be why. I also wanted to show Greg and Mycroft's wedding, but it just didn't fit in with the rest of story. Much to my dismay. :(
"I quit," Greg said, pulling up his sleeve and showing off his nicotine patch. "Apparently, they're bad for you."
"No," he replied, sulkily. He looked down and away, causing John to have to chase him to keep his fingers soothing Sherlock's curls.
There was something about the cadence and tone that made John frown further. The man was speaking oddly, and what did he mean by "live help"? John rubbed the dirt and grime from his eyes to see the stranger more clearly. Standing over him was a blond-haired, blue-eyed young man wearing the traditional Northumberland Fusiliers' cap, but in bright-red regimentals.
The party was going better than expected, Sherlock thought. John promising that he could test the toxicity of the holly versus the mistletoe, and that wasn't even his present, had kept his mouth from running too far. He had John's present in his breast pocket and it was making him nervous.
John looked expectedly at Sherlock to introduce his friends. Sherlock coughed. "This is Victor, Molly, Janine, and Greg," he said, pointing to each of them in turn.
John threw down £20 and dashed for the door. Greg looked at the jacket he'd left behind and followed at a slower pace. He had barely gotten to the door when John burst through it again. He took the jacket from Greg with a murmured apology and then was back out into the night.
Sherlock couldn't have been more grateful when his schedule evened out and he was able to return to the bookshop for his morning gossip with Mrs Hudson.
"No, sir!" John squeaked, trying to lean back away from his dad, but his attempts to struggle only made the Major angrier.
Molly turned to check herself in the mirror; she was wearing a deep blue, sleeveless tea-length dress that had a v-neck top gathered in the front and culminated with a matching flower. Her hair was pulled back away from her face and tied in a pretty bun. Her jewelry was minimal and her makeup light and airy.
Also, I want to bring your attention to the chapter counter. It has, indeed, gone up. There will be a shiny, happy epilogue.
John let out a sound of discovery as he found them. "Right, I'm going to go grab the things you're letting me borrow–"
"I saw the notice said that everyone could bring a plus one," Mary said with a sniff. "You bringing anyone?"
"Yep, I had Mike and Molly help with the scan and then Brandon turned the scans into art." He snuggled in close to Sherlock. "You gave me your heart with that lovely proposal, and as literally as I could, I gave you mine. I love you so much."
"Would you have remain single and lonely all my life, Mycroft?" Sherlock mumbled, at last joining the discussion.
"If I thought sending someone else would help, but I think it would make matters worse if I didn't go."
"I'll have someone send for your things," Mycroft said softly. "You won't have to go back if you don't want to."
"You won this round, Sherlock," he said, clicking the last syllable with a hard 'K'. He strolled out the door.
"Money buys all sorts of liberties that wouldn't be afforded to those without it," John said, shaking his head.
"That's wasn't very kind, Sherlock," John admonished, quietly. "Next time, don't do that in front of a crowd, eh?"
"And you're gonna tell me that you were just swept up in the moment and went along for the ride?" Greg huffed in disbelief.
Now he could see that the soldier had a hazy look to him. Like the heat of the desert just slightly warping the horizon. "Thank you," John managed to croak out.
kid. "Mike told me that it was straight up hated. But to attack someone who is still a kid is monstrous."
Mycroft opened his eyes to glare at Greg. "Of course." He tried to push away but the second Greg let go, Mycroft crumpled.
Dale laughed. "You'll excuse us, gentlemen, I'm stealing my boyfriend back," he said, his eyes never leaving Victor.
John dug the black box out of his pocket and tossed it to Mike, who caught deftly in one hand. The two women shared expressions of shock as Mike got down on one knee in front his long-time girlfriend.
The soldier turned to walk away and the clean, healthy appearance of the man vanished. There was a bandage on his left arm, his head was wrapped in what looked like someone's handkerchief, and his entire right leg was missing. The soldier leaned heavily on a single crutch.
The man chuckled. "Not really, just checking up on book trends. I really can't sit through a book without pulling out one of these," he said, producing a red felt-tip pen.
"That's settled then." John handed Sherlock his can of cranberries. "You take care of the cranberries and I'll take care of the rest."
"It's Wiggins, my PA," he explained as he accepted the call. "He knows not to call unless it's a emergency.
Mycroft stumbled out of his bedroom the following morning, his head heavy and aching. He wandered to the bathroom and rummaged around for any painkiller he could get his hands on. He sighed in bliss as he found the good stuff.
Mycroft chuckled. "In the Victorian language of flowers columbine is a symbol of faithlessness and deceived lovers." He looked in the rearview mirror at John. "I am surprised you know that, though, John."
"Wait," Greg asked holding up his hand. "David the Idiot knows who you lot are, but the three of us are lost." John immediately took a liking to Greg.
"Well, I was never going to hide that from you, so I didn't try." He handed the beautifully wrapped present to Sherlock. Sherlock opened it to find an anatomically-correct heart paperweight.
"I know it's not Bart's. The place where it all began, but I wanted it to be here. The place of our- I'm getting ahead of myself." He got down on one knee and smiled up at Sherlock.
"My ex," Sherlock said, frowning. "May I see the conversation?" He held out his hand for John's phone.
John watched as Greg carefully led a hurt and very dazed Mycroft further away from the party. John thought about what Greg had said about Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded. "When they were first published, they were credited to Frank Hudson, Mrs Hudson's then husband."
Sherlock cocked his head to the side. "Thank you for that," he said, dryly. "And bringing it up doesn't really help your cause."
John blushed. "Our success then," he continued. "But that isn't the reason why you all are here. It has been a long journey for Sherlock and me. From that first case with Jennifer Wilson and the Study in Pink," John raised a glass to Greg and Molly, "to Sherlock's Hiatus and his return." He raised his glass again, this time to Mycroft. "From empty hearses," he pointed at Anderson, who ducked his head and blushed, "to Mary and beyond." He stopped and choked back a sob. "Sherlock and I have weathered much in our journey. And while he has always loved me, it took me years to realize I felt the same about him.
"I would only date Mycroft Holmes if we were the last people on earth and there were no sheep. Are there sheep?"
That brought Mycroft up short, stopping only a few feet from from Greg, "Really?" Mycroft raised an eyebrow skeptically and walked up to him. "I would have thought that detention would be like a second home to you what with all the skipping classes you do, always having to go to Mrs Hudson's office and your..." Mycroft waved vaguely at Greg, "general attitude of 'juvenile delinquent'." He made shooing motions, but Greg didn't move.
He went to the buffet table, pleased to see that Mycroft was as generous here as he had been in Sussex. And to his immense enjoyment, the table had all his favorites. Sherlock must have had a hand in the selections, considering how well the man knew John.
"Bill said no?" Sherlock asked, sliding into the waiting taxi. He gave directions to the cabbie before turning his attention back to his fiancé.
Sherlock shook his head, he staggered and John rushed to his side. He put Sherlock's arm around his shoulder and took the man's weight.
"I never knew that love could be like this. I always assumed that it was a defect found on the losing side. But how could I lose when I'm with you? It's not possible. I have said that you redeemed me, but I have come to realize I didn't need redeeming. I needed someone to understand that while I was unique, I was just like everyone else in needing love. I am fine being who I am."
The ghost threw back his head and laughed with joy. "And here I thought getting the two of you together would surely send me to hell."
John lifted his head and grasped the detective's face to press their foreheads together. "I don't either." John kissed him. "But we'll figure it out together. You and me against the world. Remember?"
Molly opened her mouth to answer, but closed it sharply. She had seen the show, of course. A lot of the people were left humiliated. She took a deep breath. Her father always said, nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Mycroft squeezed his eyes shut and stormed out the house. He slammed the door behind him and drove off into the night, cursing everyone and anyone.
"It seems Victor Trevor has been trying to stay 'relevant' for the last ten years," Mycroft continued, "first with the photos, and then a couple of years ago he admitted to leaking your name to the press on some blog."
"You're going have to stop your little obsession with me," Greg snarked, washing his hands. "People are going to talk." He winked.
Sherlock did as he was bid and gasped. On the floor there were rose petals, and except for the small table holding the wine bucket and chocolate cake, every other flat surface was covered with candles. In the hearth was a roaring fire.
"If you ever decide to come see one of our home games, just give me a call and I'll get you as many seats as you need," John said, scribbling his number on the back of a business card that had John's manager's number on the front for endorsement deals and the like.
"Kayla from history was saying that in America they aren't even allowed into pubs or bars until they are twenty-one. And they have to show ID," Mike commented.
Mike perked up a bit at that. "Huh? What? No, Sherlock might a bit rough around the edges, but he's a decent bloke."
"If you don't mind," John replied. "It would be good to walk around before being pretzelled into the back of car." He lifted his cane ruefully to make his point.
They were sitting on the sofa with the bottle of Scotch that had been John's contribution to the night, snuggling in front of the fire, when they heard a loud commotion at the front step. They jumped up and John went for the poker, while Sherlock dove for his phone.
Mycroft scowled. He wanted to argue, but he had just proven otherwise with his little stunt. "I'll make you a deal. We'll go out today, but we do things my way."
"Look I–" Mycroft began but an explosion on the telly drowned him out. He picked up the remote and turned it off. "I know you hate that you have to sit home because I refuse to play by the rules," he continued.
The two just chatted about the house's history as they made their way around the massive building to the orchard.
John looked back into the room. "Thank you, but no. He'll go right back to sleep once we get home. And if I can't take care of a sleeping detective, I wouldn't be much of a doctor now, would I?"
"Comes from getting something off your chest that had been weighing you down for years," John murmured. "You feel weightless because the stone you had been carrying for so long is gone, but the effort it took to get it off is draining."
"Then let's not make it go to waste," John said, only moving far enough away to look the tall dancer in the eye. "And then afterwards, I am planning on doing all sorts of indecent things to you."
Last Christmas, John had given Mary his heart. This year he cast it in glass and asked Sherlock not to break it, physically or metaphorically. And as he watched the colors from the glass light Sherlock's face, John knew that it was in safe hands.
John looked at the open door and then with a sigh and shake of his head, he slipped in beside Mycroft's PA.
John looked around, too. "Well, we all drove our own cars, but there's no need for that many cars. Let's see," he counted off people in his head, "there are nine of us. Five of you and four of us...and since we've all been there," he pointed to his friends, "we can put at least one of us in each car to give directions."
"Hey," he muttered. "What's up?" John was still smarting from the sting of rejection, but the look on Sherlock's face was the one of sheer panic.
"And there is nothing more important in this world than an ordinary man," Sherlock explained. "And you love me, which is marvelous."
"Hello, John." She smiled at him before shooting off a message on her Blackberry. "I've come to take you home."
The extra weight on the lead did nothing to slow the animal in its escapade. John didn't want anyone hurt, so he stepped up in front of the charging Mastiff and said firmly, "Halt."
"He won't need you for a couple of hours, he's asleep for fuck's sake!" Greg pleaded. "I need to stop this guy before he slaughters half the population of Brixton!"
The cabbie laughed before he drove off, leaving Sherlock clinging to the doctor, like a blushing bride on her wedding day. John carefully carried the long-limbed man up the stairs, bridal style.
The night had started out well enough; most of the friends who had said that they were coming had shown up. Molly. Mike and Divya. A few of his army mates that were in London. He really wanted Bill to be here, but the man who had saved his life was still out there saving lives in the Helmand province of Afghanistan.
John looked round him as people milled about the small Westminster shop, more than there had ever been during the rest of the time it was open. But no matter how hard he scanned the crowd, the one person he wanted to see wasn't there. Yes, he knew that Sherlock had said he wouldn't be able to make it, but he still held out for a miracle that he would be here.
"I know, John," she simpered. "But I just got distracted." Mary looked him up and down appreciatively.
He wished that he could just curl up with Sherlock and get some much-needed sympathy cuddles. On his way to the kitchen to grab a beer before that much needed shower, he passed a brightly smiling Sherlock holding a bouquet of flowers.
"Thank you." Sherlock looked at the book and then handed it back to John. "Just be forewarned. It ends with a bit of a cliffhanger."
"I'm really sorry for this, Mr Holmes," Barbara said after watching Julie leave. "What can I do to make this right?"
"Okay," Sherlock said. And that's when the libido decided to take over before the nerves did, his confidence came back and he smiled seductively.
"Sent an entire shipment of books with their covers attached upside down to three major bookshops in Leeds."
"Yeah," Greg breathed and suddenly he couldn't breathe at all. Mycroft was kissing him. He sighed and put his arms around him.
Mycroft cocked his head to the side. "Why?" After watching Sherlock beat the hell out of Bertie, Mycroft couldn't see any reason for him to apologize.
Greg studiously ignored him and continued to sip his bourbon, pretending to focus on the music blaring all around them.
"The man I set Janine up with at the...'other' wedding, they got back together after..." he coughed, "well anyway, they married. Last month, in fact."
John got undressed in the small one-room bedsit and put on his bathrobe. He grabbed his towel from the one closet in the room and made his way to the ensuite bathroom.
"Maybe he was trying to get publicity for being the real-life inspiration for Ajay," Sherlock said, still reading through the thread. "Had the book been a success, it would have been a real feather in his cap. But only if people knew I wrote it."
"There are far more important things than money and good looks," Sherlock continued. "And while we're on the subject of good looks, you must know what a striking figure you cut."
After breakfast was cleaned up, John and Mike offered to help Mycroft's group unearth their Land Rover and get them on their way to Balmoral.
John threw open the door and stared at a startled Sherlock like he was the most wonderful thing in the world.
There were so many people, and all of them were influential in the writing world. There were publishers, editors, agents, and famous authors. John saw a couple of his favorites standing by the buffet table and he thought his heart was going to burst out of his chest at the sight of them.
The study door opened and a haggard Sherlock slipped in. Both John and Mycroft stood up, but Mycroft let John assist his brother into a nearby sofa.
"For when you quit or take your sabbatical or whatever you decide to do," Sherlock said dismissively.
Greg was struck on how absolutely beautiful Mycroft was. He leaned down and Mycroft rose to meet him. They sealed their lips together. Mycroft sank back into the hay, Greg following to keep their lips pressed together.
“So that’s it? Two hours with you, your mum, this bloke, and his girlfriend, and you’re over the moon?” Greg questioned.
Suddenly there was thump on the back of his head. "Ow!" he cried and turned to glare at the stage manager, Tobias Gregson. He was a tall, lean man, with a craggy face and grey curls. His blue eyes were piercing.
Sherlock scoffed. "But barely. At that point my parents had become aware of the habit, and they wrote a new clause into the trust fund. I would have to show up in person to my brother and formally request access to the trust."
Hello, and happy early Valentine's Day. I was going to try and get another Valentine's Day story out like I did last year, but the flu is seriously kicking my ass. I swear I have gotten three different strains of the damn thing and all at the most inconvenient times. But at least I'll have an idea for next year.
"He mostly kept himself so when he died, most people weren't aware he had done so. Then when I started saying that Mike was my assistant, they assumed that's where he'd gone. Those that did know he'd passed, thought it was another Mike Stamford."
"Yeah, but you can call me John," the army doctor replied. "It's a pleasure to meet you at last. Mike has told me all about you."
"Good idea of John's to have the party here," Mike said, changing the subject. "Not much of a chance of random people showing up. They'd have to go through Mrs Hudson and she's more formidable than a measly blizzard." Sherlock chuckled. "Though, party crashing worked well enough for you."
"Not the best connotation for a publishing company, I'll admit," John said between bites. He finally took a sip of whatever it was Sherlock poured him and whistled in appreciation. "That is some good stuff."
"The last two I spoke to called me a sociopath with serial killer tendencies," Sherlock said in all seriousness.
Sherlock and he had gone to his flat and ate ice cream, but despite the almost kiss on the pavement, they had kept their distance to a friendly banter.
Mycroft blushed, "And maybe you aren't as vile as I thought." He took a deep breath and then leaned over to kiss Greg.
"Right, how about Go Fish instead?" he asked after the moment of silence had stretched between them for too long.
Sherlock scoffed. "I most assuredly do not need you, Shercroft is not in dire straits, and the Diogenes Print Club has already agreed to begin printing our books after the beginning of the year. I don't know where you got your information, but you should have done your own digging."
Sherlock untied the belt and the rest of the robe drooped gracefully to the floor. Sherlock's entire right side was uncovered, as the sleeve pooled at his wrist.
John laughed politely as Bertie dropped his arm from around Sally to focus on Sherlock. "Come on, we're all gathering around Culverton Smith. It's pretty awesome."
But while he was trying to protect Sherlock, he couldn't see what the other man was doing, so he almost jumped when he felt the light touch on his arm. But when Sherlock gasped, John whirled around. Sherlock was moving away from him with his hands covering his mouth.
"Just be back in time for your birthday," John admonished, but his heart wasn't really in it. "I have something special planned for you."
Sherlock: Well, Ajay is based off my first boyfriend, so it only seemed fair to give John his own character.
"Piss off, Mycroft," Sherlock snarled and hung up the phone, but not fast enough to avoid hearing his brother's delighted laugh.
Anderson snorted. "It's an easy mistake for him to make, he's been called worse things by the people they had on the show."
"Speaking of phones," Mike replied, "there is no way that your phone could go from being able to text me to dead in mere seconds. How'd you do it?" He jutted out his his chin.
"You know, what?" John growled. "To hell with you." He turned on his heel and stormed out of the flat.
"So why are you even here?" John asked, crossing one leg over the other. "Don't tell me it's because Sherlock fainted. You don't seem the overprotective type. What's the matter, you afraid that it might be contagious or worse, hereditary?"
Victor took him in and sat him down. "Clean off your makeup, get out of your costume before Sally pitches a fit that you haven't returned it yet, and for fuck's sake get your act together. You're a grown man, act like it."
So instead of going home like he had so desperately wanted, he had gotten off the Tube and taken a cab to St. Mary's. At least someone had the forethought not to send him to Bart's. He dashed into the A&E to find a harried-looking Greg waiting for him.
He decided that Sherlock was being a twat and left it the way he had it. He had other things to do, he didn't have time to rearrange things just because some posh wanker said so.
Cathy stopped in the middle of hopping on one foot trying to get her shoe on. “Um...well, I’ll be on location for a couple of days, so probably not until the weekend.”
The restaurant that John took them to was upscale but not overly expensive. John had made the reservation for eight, so they had a little time to chat before being seated. Sherlock still wasn't sure what he should do or say, but he let John lead the conversation.
Sherlock just shook his head. "It doesn't matter." He nudged John's shoulder with his own. "Come on, let's go back to my place. I have a pint of ice cream that needs to be devoured before I leave."
The horse raised his head and nudged Mycroft's. Mycroft petted his horse's nose. "Quite right. Let's get out there, shall we?"
John shook his head. "No good, I already told her that I didn't have time to go out, so where would I have met this person?"
John's jaw worked back and forth as he struggled with what to say next. "I am a veteran of the Afghanistan war where I was wounded in action. I have PTSD, which can make for a rough night. Add on the fact that I am holding down a full-time job, training you and James, and have a deadline I have to meet to get my book out in time. When do I have time for a social life?"
Just then a police car came to a skidding halt on the curb. Lestrade stepped out and Sherlock smiled.
"Strange, you'd be the first," Mycroft muttered and pushed his way past Greg to go in search of more booze.
John reheated two bowls worth and brought it in to Sherlock, where they lapsed into a companionable silence as they ate. When finished, John took the bowls back into the kitchen and set them in the sink. He then made his way to Sherlock's room, where he got some things for Sherlock to sleep in.
Sherlock grinned and then turned to lead the procession into the hall they had rented for the occasion.
Sherlock sat back and draped one arm over the back of his chair. "My problem with that is that I have a feeling that as time goes on, my contact with you would become increasingly less and with him decidedly more, that the harassment would return and in greater force."
Greg decided to take John out for drinks to make up for being a bastard when he was sick. He knew Sherlock wasn't going to leave John's side, but had gotten so desperate that he hadn't cared that John was so ill that he had barely moved from the sofa the whole time.
John put the book down and threw his arms around Sherlock's neck. "Of course I do. How could I not?"
"Victor!" Sherlock said warningly. "Gays are not the dark side," he cast a sidelong glance at John and then continued with a mischievous gleam in his eye, "straights are."
He smiled brightly before skipping over to the dark door with the brass fixture proclaiming 221B. He went inside to tell Mrs Hudson the good news about her tenant.
"That certainly is excessive. They might as well post a sign that says, 'We are doing horrible things! Keep Out!'"
“It’s not like that, he’s a...well, he’s not even a friend at this point,” Sherlock murmured. “An acquaintance at best.”
"Well, grab your things," Mike said. "Looks like you're stuck with us for the weekend. Me and Div will be happy to have you."
The second strikeout for Mike was that he tried dancing near a group of girls. And since Mike's sense of rhythm was as graceful as an infant goat, he was rebuffed there as well.
Molly stood nervously in front of the inn. She had thought about looking the place up several times, but that would be cheating. She didn't want to cheat. She wanted to prove to Sherlock Holmes that she was the real deal. Oh, well, not the
"Oi!" Bill complained as he set the large box he was carrying down next to a couple of mismatched chairs. One a red, floral, upholstered monstrosity and the other a green leather and steel modern thing that somehow fit in with the rest of the décor, even with the awful wallpaper and threadbare rug.
"Because there used to be orchards out back," Sherlock explained. He turned to Anderson, "We'll start at the posterior of the house."
"I wouldn't have been able to get anything past you otherwise. Besides, it's not so bad; it's not as though he is coming with us or anything."
John chuckled. "I figured the bloke that brings two strawberry scones each morning to the bookstore and lets Mrs Hudson have both was a breakfast lightweight."
"It's John, right?" Sally asked and then turned to Sherlock with a look of 'Why are we talking to this person?'
it. They called it bland, trashy, and juvenile when they were being 'kind'; worthless, mindless drivel from a rich white boy when they weren't."
"She's not sure. She doesn't want to sell it. She might just rent it out to couples wanting to get out of the city."
Mycroft sighed. While his head was feeling much better, it still felt like he was walking through water some of the time. Though maybe that had more to do with the pain in his chest and not in his head. He had really thought that Greg liked him like that, and then to be rejected when Mycroft was in pain just made the whole thing a million times worse.
"She tried to get one of her stories published and was accused of plagiarism, by Frank's editor, no less," Sherlock snarled. "How that woman still works in this industry I'll never know, but both she and the head publicist for Shercroft Publishing at the time doubled down, insisting that Mrs Hudson was the thief and not Frank." He motioned for John to go first, but John shook his head.
Sherlock smiled at John. "I wonder I what I'll say to Mike. He's been with me so long, and I don't really need an assistant anymore."
He squeezed Sherlock's arm and trailed his hand down, his fingers brushing Sherlock's palm before he let go.
Sherlock swept out of the room and the door slammed just as the flash of lightning lit the room. It was followed (far too quickly in John's opinion) by the thunder.
“Well there’s that, too. But hell, Sherlock, I’m not mad, I’m curious. Who has the great Sherlock Holmes smiling like that?”
David crossed his arms in front of his chest as Mycroft and Greg squeezed him out to the far side of the sofa. Far away from his intended target.
"Either he is or he isn't. For starters, Bertie isn't half the man you are. Secondly, don't ever let anyone make you feel you like you don't deserve something you want." Greg gave John a small shake, "Go for it."
Mrs Holmes smirked. "Which is something I never understood really. How is it that my son gets labeled a fairy when he gets to be around women in tight outfits, while rugby players, who roll around in the dirt with other men, aren't?"
But of course, John hadn't heard a damn thing from Sherlock. After a couple of weeks of trying to get ahold of him, John had given up.
After dinner, they sat on the sofa sipping the scotch Sherlock had brought. They were sitting so close that John could have sworn that they were cuddling.
It was such a simple request. One that wasn't dangerous or outrageous. But one that took a major hit to Sherlock's pride.
Greg smiled and shook his head. He walked up to the bar and sat down. The bartender turned around and they fist bumped their greeting.
I've also found a transcript of the movie and learned that I've done a few things out of order. Surprise, surprise, I am actually okay with this. My other fusions weren't as faithful to the movie as this one mostly has been, and I honestly needed the wiggle room.
"Mhmm," Sherlock murmured into John's chest. "Albert. He was older than John but younger than Harry. Can you reach the papers on the coffee table?"
John twirled to make the frilly pink apron flare out like a tutu. "I needed something fast and this was all my sister-in-law had on hand." He ran his hands over the frills and lifted up his chin defiantly. "Besides, I think I look pretty."
Of course, that means I have to add a couple more scenes to flesh out the newly arranged sections, but I'm sure you guys won't mind more story. Right? ;)
John beamed up at him and began soothing away Sherlock's fears by running his fingers through his dark, curled locks.
John kissed every inch of that lovely column of flesh. Sherlock's hands gripped John's shoulders, desperate to hold on to something. John chuckled as he gently guided those magnificent fingers lower and settled them on his waist.
"You know how Sally likes to do these in sets of three? Well, you've driven the fake mystics so far underground that your brother can't find them."
Ten minutes later there was another knock on Mrs Holmes's front door. She frowned and went to answer it. She opened it up to reveal another young man in a tux.
He was dressed in a black suit with a purple shirt. She couldn't stop staring at the shirt, it was so tight that the buttons were threatening to burst free. She found herself willing them to do so. Sherlock coughed and her eyes drifted up that long column of throat to those pale, Cupid's bow lips and those cheek bones. She reached out, but Sherlock mistook the gesture and shook her hand.
"Please!" Sherlock begged. "Just a hint. Anything! It doesn't matter the cost. I'd do anything. I'd clean the entire kitchen."
John looked up to see the strange soldier just standing there, but he never seemed to get further away.
"John here," Mike pointed to John, "would like to date Sherlock Holmes, but seeing as his brother is a bit of a tough nut to crack, we thought we could lend a hand," he explained.
Toby: You mentioned your partner, John H Watson. He was the reason you started writing again, how did that come about?
"It's fine, John," he said with a smile that didn't seem to reach his eyes. "I wanted to ride with Bill and discuss that play in the second half. And since Sherlock and Victor want to ride with you, I could ride with him and one of the others."
"That was an assumption on your part," Greg replied with a smile. "I was a well-known editor when I met Mycroft, so I kept the name. I wasn't about to make him take mine, not when his belongs to the biggest publishing family in Great Britain."
Greg scoffed and grabbed the reins, leading both horses out of the stable. Mycroft followed behind, wondering what he'd said wrong.
Mike called out to Mary as she stood staring into the dark. She jolted as if she had been awakened from a dream and followed him to the lodge. Mike looked out into the darkness, but not seeing anything closed the door tight against the storm.
John looked up at Sherlock. The publicist's shoulders were rounded and his hands were jammed into his coat pockets. His head was turned away and every line in his body was screaming his distress.
Sherlock pushed the jacket off John's shoulders and after a brief struggle of limbs, it was on the floor. The whole time, their mouths kept seeking the other's, as if they couldn't bare to be apart for long.
John's head shot up with a grin. "Has my 'everything is transport' lover actually been thinking about retiring some day?"
Mycroft's smile could be felt through the phone. "Not yet, but John isn't just a step up, he's several stories up."
Mummy glared him, "Other teenage boys weren't raised the way you two were and therefore are lacking in morals and upbringing. And that is the end of it, young man."
"Oi!" Anderson bellowed. "What the hell do you think you were doing out there today? How the hell do you expect me to do my job, with you running about like a fucking gazelle? Huh? It's my job to make sure that we catch your little deduction bullshitting, or whatever the hell it is you do."
What this means is that I am almost done with the fair tale of mine. I will miss it terribly and all of you lovely people and your sweet comments. But all beginnings have an end and this one is in its autumn.
drunk and throwing herself at random blokes. Would you get her somewhere safe? Somewhere where no one could take advantage of her?"
Barbara sighed. "It's not about who is more famous or less, it's about respecting our customers. And just turning around and giving a table to someone else isn't acceptable. Were this the first time, I would let it slide. But you
When Sherlock pointed to a door on the other side of the room, John hobbled to it and opened it to reveal it was indeed a bathroom.
"No, seriously," John said softly, "you look incredible. You really did outdo yourself. I can't wait to be seen as your date tonight."
Mycroft tried to get away and scrambled on all fours, but Greg grabbed his hips and put Mycroft back into a standing position.
John grinned, "I can't guarantee that." He winked at Sherlock and got up to put his dishes in the sink.
Sherlock lifted his head out the duvet and said a little louder, "I didn't know where they were kept."
"Of course not," Sherlock agreed. "And let me guess, you've already found a way to subvert these little surprises?"
Mike winced. "I know, right?" Sherlock just glared at him. "I know him, from uni, got back in contact after he was sent home. He's a real decent bloke."
"I'm sure you don't, but I assure you any further attempts to orchestrate my removal from my own company will be met with investigations by the Met," Sherlock sneered.
"And then we have the Otakus," Mike said pointing to another group of students. "They like to think they're Japanese and know everything about it, but mostly‒"
She turned her attention to Sherlock and her lips twitched upwards in what could barely be called a smile. "You!" She fired somewhere behind Sherlock and he cowered from the blast.
Once they got to the veranda, John was in awe of the spread before him. There were fruits and meats and cheeses and every good thing imaginable. And that was just the food, the drinks included several nice vintages of wine, good rum, whiskey and other spirits. But there were also water and juices for those that didn't drink.
"Yes," Anthea muttered sarcastically. "Why would anyone want to get dressed to the nines, dance, and have fun for an evening?"
Anthea took his hand and shook it. "So what has the Bard done for you lot that would make you want to do this huge favor for him, because you can't tell me these dresses are cheap by any stretch of the imagination."
Divya poured herself a cup of coffee and without putting anything in it at all drank half the cup. She put down the cup and wrapped her arms around Mike. "You know I love only you, right?"
He had pressed the doctor many times for a Christmas list. Something, anything that would give Sherlock an idea of what he could get his friend. But each time John would shake his head and smile.
John was out doing the last part of his Christmas shopping. Normally he didn't let it get this close to Christmas, but this gift was special. It was for Sherlock. He was coming out of the shop when he ran into the last person he expected to see. Mary. She was arm in arm with David, clearly at least four months pregnant.
"That's right. Just you. If I get another call from you about this, Miss Donovan, you'll be looking for work elsewhere. Do I make myself clear?"
"What?" Victor asked. "I am perfectly willing to third-wheel it. I have a boyfriend, I can text him if they get too gooey."
John rose to his feet, clenching and unclenching his left hand. "Is he okay?" he asked before either man had time to say a word.
Sherlock glanced at his watch and nodded. "Right you are, John." He turned to Victor, "Goodbye and please don't keep in touch."
Mycroft glared at their retreating backs. Someone passed by with a tray of drinks and Mycroft took one and gulped it down. The kid holding the tray cheered him on.
John leaned down and licked Sherlock's nipple, tugging gently on the ring with his tongue. "Ever remove these?"
Mike nodded and left John by himself, but as he opened the door he heard John say, “Cathy? Yeah, this is John, we need to talk.”
John almost doubled over with laughter. "About that..." and he launched into telling James about his and Sherlock's 'sleepover' in Sussex and how they got to be such great friends.
The blond-haired man got Sherlock settled before walking to the other side of the bed and sliding in next to him.
Sherlock took the book and ran fingers on the well-worn spine. "Not really, I've tried all sorts but it makes...I don't know how to put this into words. It's not better, it's not worse, but it's like an added layer to the fear, making it different somehow."
Sherlock surged up and kissed him hard. "But if I had," he murmured, "I wouldn't have been able to do that." And then he began kissing trails down John's neck.
"What you fussing for?" Tobias growled. "Either he brought a date and only wants to be friends; in which case it's better you know now anyway. Or he brought a friend for support because he's in love with you and is feeling too nervous to go it alone."
John waited until Sherlock had dropped off in a doze on the sofa. John looked fondly at the sleeping figure. This mad man had done it again. Just like with his wedding, Sherlock had gone out of his way to make his Christmas perfect. And it was. Well, nearly.
John pressed in and bit off a curse. Sherlock was so tight he nearly came, and even then all it took was a few well timed thrusts and John was coming inside of his lover. They collapsed on the sofa, twisting to twine around each other on the narrow surface.
Once they tied up their horses they went in to sign up for a session. When they got handed a bag of paintballs, Greg and Mycroft shared a confused glance.
"You thrive on excitement and challenge," Sherlock replied. "It doesn't take a trained therapist to see that."
"Yes," Sherlock agreed. "That is why Mycroft and I decided to send me to deal with the problem directly. I'll be heading out to Cork to kick their arses."
"Oh, bloody ha," John murmured. "They know I can be discreet. I've done it before. I think it's more that Sherlock has turned down one too many 'my necklace is missing' and having it turn out to be pawned for gambling debts or given to the mistress. But Sherlock has been trying. He's been around to the Yard and his brother's office every day and that's when he's not calling them every five minutes."
Greg half shrugged. "I merely took up John's suggestion of evening the score." He poked at his food, a small smile on his face as he thought about how hard Mycroft had laughed.
"So where did my brother hide the games?" Sherlock asked, breaking into John's reverie. "I'm assuming the cabinets under the bookshelves."
Cathy, on the other hand, just wanted to get John home and rip all his clothes off before she withered from sexual frustration.
Greg stopped paying attention to what the two of them were saying and pulled out the note. He read it hastily and his jaw dropped. Apparently, this was a breakout.
On the one hand it was a teeny bit stalker-y, but on the other, she would get her date to prom because she was damn sure that Jim would never do anything even remotely considered romantic and she would be safe in that quarter.
"Well, as hot as I think you would be on the back of my bike," Greg said with a chuckle, "it wouldn't do to show up with both of us in helmet hair, people might talk."
"It's nice to meet you, Miss Hooper," Sherlock said, his fake smile firmly in place. "I'm so glad you agreed to do my show. Are you familiar with the format?"
Sherlock's long fingers sought thighs, and skidded across abs. His lips pressed against ribs, and the neck. All John could do is hold on to Sherlock's shoulders for support.
John nodded and stretched. He went to the loo and washed his face and hands and then made a circuit around some pillars to warm up his leg.
Sherlock watched as John's shoulders squared. He had seen that pose often enough to know that his friend was well and truly upset.
She sighed heavily again. "I don't do it to be malicious or hurtful," she explained. "I don't even charge for it, really. Sometimes they'll give me money or a small gift, but that's it, I swear."
"They may be a little big, my brother-in-law is a good three to four inches taller than you, but it'll be better than being forced to wear the same thing every day for however long this takes," Sherlock mumbled.
Mycroft Holmes had come out of his office to find out what the ruckus was about. When he saw that it was some pretentious jock putting the moves on his little brother, his brow grew thunderous. He tapped the tip of his umbrella harshly on the ground, its sound lost in the din of celebration.
Mrs Hudson laughed, "Sherlock is a dear friend, and I am fond of him. But no, I don't have any children."
"Nah, I'll give him a thrill," John said, waving away his concern. "What did he used to say before they made him use that stupid catch phrase, 'Suspect everything'?"
"No, I couldn't have, it would have barely covered my arse," Sherlock groused, pouring himself a cup of coffee that had been brewing since John woke up. "Why are you so short?"
He needn't have worried because as John pulled up to the house, Mrs Stamford and Mike came out of the front door. "Major Watson," Mrs Stamford said, walking up to the stone-faced man, "why didn't you knock? I could have brewed up a cuppa for you, rather than waiting outside like this."
Sherlock got in on the passenger side, fidgeting. John just shook his head and got behind the wheel.
"Oh, John," Mrs Stamford cooed, as she helped the boy get to his feet. "I should have told him to stop."
This is kinda a warm up chapter, it was originally much longer. But I was counting pages I had left and went "holy crap!" so the next chapter will move the plot forward a bit more. Enjoy lovelies!
John shrugged. "It's like owning a banned book, they're selling the drama behind the book, not the book itself. Which is sad, because if it was released today instead of ten years ago, there wouldn't be as much backlash."
And when Sherlock Darling didn't come to the shop the next day, the hollow feeling filled with something like regret.
Also you may have noticed that the rating has gone up a bit. That's because in the next chapter instead of John and Sherlock enjoying an ice lolly in summer heat, they decided to heat things up further. But that's in the next chapter so you'll have something to look forward to.
"Yeah, I thought not," Greg said, his grin mischievous. "Although, I think I have a couple ideas of what you could with that time instead."
"Yes, she probably survived the fall, but bleeding out on the floor of the shower, there was no one to come see if she was okay until days later. Sad, really." Sherlock sniffed. "Not that she'll be a problem for anyone else."
Mycroft held his head and landed on the bench with a heavy thud. Maybe Lestrade was right, maybe he did have a concussion.
Victor laughed. "Aww, the wee Irish lass following her nationality's natural prejudice against the Scots, tsk, tsk, tsk," he said in the worst Irish accent imaginable.
"You do now. Someone who understands better than a man trying to leave Purgatory. A man who loves you."
There was a sharp poke in his side and turned around. The girl behind him hissed, "Take up your poem!"
"It's a lot to take in, isn't?" the publisher murmured, handing John a drink, which he took gratefully.
"I thought that was filled with old detritus; broken childhood toys, torn and falling apart books, trophies and ribbons for things no longer cared about," Sherlock murmured. "Things like that."
He pulled on a pair of fishnet stockings and attached them to the suspender belt. He chose a white button up shirt which he left unbuttoned and pair of little black shorts that barely covered what it was supposed to. He put on a pair of braces to make sure that the shorts stayed where they were. Lastly he threw on a pair of low-heeled, scrunch, ankle boots.
"I've never seen him," John said, crossing his arms in front of his chest and settling all his weight on his back foot, jealousy radiating up his form.
"But he's been trapped in this tailspin for the last ten years," John argued. "And people are still out there bashing his first book. I'm willing to bet that the only reason he doesn't get hate mail is because the publishing house just tosses it out."
Sherlock looked at the outstretched hand with skepticism. "How are you going to get me up the steps?"
"That's not what the rumors say about him," John said with a chuckle. "I believe the words used are 'arrogant', 'tyrannical', and 'exacting'."
Victor looked up from his message to catch Molly dust off a flake of imaginary lint from Mike's jacket.
"He wasn't even allowed to smile or laugh. He wasn't grieving for his mother like he was supposed to. My father never blamed me, nor was it ever my fault, but I learned to keep my own face blank, and taught Sherlock to do the same."
"I've managed to work it out with Mycroft; our tours will be together, well..." Sherlock explained. "Mine will technically start two months into yours, but I'll be traveling with you the whole time."
"Well, sort of," Sherlock replied with a blush. "It's a mock-up of the real thing. But it does have the full book in there."
"Yes, Mycroft has given me permission to start hunting around for another printer," he informed the former soldier.
"You know," he murmured as he continued his journey further down, "I have a hard time choosing the most delectable part of you."
They had been able to catch the last printing error in time, which was merely the third book in a trilogy being printed with the second book's cover. That was caught before being mailed out, this was worse.
Mycroft stretched out his legs on the bed and crossed them at the ankles. He put his hands on his lap and sighed. "Bertie never told you we went out, did he?"
"Whose brilliant idea was it to have only one bathroom in a place this size?" he groused, falling in line behind John.
"I was lecturing on rare diseases and Mike was there. He came up afterwards and asked me to drinks so he could ask me more in-depth questions. The rest is history."
Soon the chorus girls had spread all over the theatre that brooding Sherlock Holmes was smiling and not his usual “Someone has done something wrong and I’m about to eviscerate them” smile, either. An honest-to-goodness happy smile. That wasn’t to say that Sherlock never laughed or smiled with the rest of the cast, but this was different. This was a smile from his heart.
Sherlock just waved him off, but John couldn't help the swell of gratitude that welled in his chest. Mike was right, there was much more to Sherlock than met the eye.
He stormed up the stairs and was surprised to see Sherlock standing at the window composing. John couldn't figure out how Sherlock had beat him home, but he didn't care. All he wanted was a long, hot shower, a cup of tea, and a book by the fire.
"There are some things that shouldn't have to be experienced if you can avoid them. You can't always trust the people you think you can rely on," Mycroft pleaded.
This is the final chapter before the fluffy epilogue. It really stressed me out not being able to get this chapter done before Halloween. Lesson learned though, when coming up with a huge idea for a Halloween fic, be sure to start in September. After all, the readers won't know you've been sitting on finished story unless you tell them.
John shouted for the women and they sprang into action. Mary and John called out the orders to the others for blankets, to boil water, and to stoke the fire back to full blaze. Mike began pulling off the wet outer layers of the travelers. Afterwards he spread the coats and sweaters to dry over any surface he could find that didn't have a warm body on it.
"But–" Sherlock began. He couldn't even articulate the million questions on his tongue. How could this be?
"I was hoping you would say that," John said with a grin and put the fork back for another set of chopsticks.
Sherlock reached for John's belt and pulled it off. The shorter man couldn't help but moan as Sherlock undid the button and slid down the zip.
"Going to prom," he called as he strode for the front door, "don't wait up, I'll be home late." Mycroft opened the door and slammed it behind him.
Sherlock shook his head. "It was the thunder. Lightning lit up the sky in beautiful pale blue but the thunder crashed almost immediately. It frightened me so badly, I fell out of the tree and broke my arm."
Sherlock opened his mouth and then closed it with a snap. "I think I'll go find something to read." He got up, and wrapping the duvet around his head, strolled along the shelves.
"Me, too," John agreed. "But why are you...?" Sherlock turned fully around and John spotted the can in his hand. "You mean you forgot cranberries, too?"
Sherlock's grin threatened to split his face. "I, too, occasionally do nice things for the good doctor."
John went home, feeling pensive. He hadn't thought much about Sherlock's romantic past. He had asked Mrs Hudson once during the Irene Adler fiasco, but other than Janine, John hadn't seen him with anyone. But it did seem more than a tad ridiculous that Sherlock had never had a romantic entanglement before Janine.
"So here's the thing," Greg began, "My parents divorced two years ago over polo. My papa was always on the circuit, so rarely at home that my
"Wear that dreadful outfit that you wore to Mummy's birthday and just be yourself, Sherlock," Mycroft advised. "Surprisingly, I don't think that unless you actively sabotage the date that he'll run screaming. Which is what you are concerned about, yes?"
John kicked at an errant pile of snow. They had actually got their Christmas miracle, and it had snowed properly.
A man in a dark overcoat stepped out of the shadows, "I did try to warn you, Vicky love. But you wouldn't listen."
The ride over to the restaurant started tense for Sherlock, but soon the knowledge that Victor had his back regardless of what happened tonight with John had him almost fully relaxed by the time they got there. John, of course, helped Sherlock feel at ease, too. He kept the conversation light and since Sherlock was driving, never took his eyes off the dancer.
An hour later and a hundred copies in hand, Mike and John let loose the new fliers saying that Sarah's party was now a BYOB and that it would be the place to be.
Thankfully for me and all of you, my beta has more sense then the wailing author and told me to write it again, better. I don't know if it's better, but I will say I am very pleased with the end result.
He tapped his phone against his lips and put the other hand on his hip. He honestly didn't know what he wanted to do with this information. He could bring up to Sherlock, let him know that he since he was in Afghanistan at the time this whole shit storm went down, he would be the last person in the world to care.
At first John couldn't figure out what was wrong as he felt for wounds, but when he saw the note grasped in Sherlock's fist, he knew.
Sherlock helped his mother into their car and looked back to see John smiling at him. He thought John was the most interesting person he had ever met.
"Yeah," John said. "I really enjoyed our time together this weekend and would like to see you again when we get back to London. Maybe go for drinks or something."
James doubled over in laughter. "I've never thought of it like that, but yes. Yes, he does. He looks like a Disney character."
He deposited Sherlock on their sofa and then made his way to the kitchen. "Mycroft's minions have been by, I see," he chuckled when he saw that it had been scrubbed clean. He opened a cupboard and it was filled with food; a check to their fridge confirmed that it, too, had been restocked.
Sherlock roused slightly, "I don't believe in coincidence, if that's what you're asking; the universe is rarely so lazy."
John just smiled and then offered Sherlock his arm. Sherlock raised an eyebrow, but hooked his arm through John's.
Sherlock looked up. "But I want to so much. So, so much." He reached out and wiped John's cheek with his thumb. "But I can't give it to you because I don't know how to. I'm not who you need. I'm violent, I'm rude, I am nothing without you. But if you want me, I'll try. I'd move heaven and earth for one day. Just one."
"Anyway," Greg ploughed on. "Last year my papa was in a horrible accident and I spent six months at his bedside, helping him get back on his feet." He cleared his throat. "But while I was out there I was surrounded by horses and polo again and I loved it. So when I got back to England,
Sherlock took the collar from John's hands and peeled back more of the material. "That is one hell of a nasty bruise. Did her bullet do that?"
"It wouldn't be the last time he blamed something on me," Mycroft groused, thinking about their recent fights. "What about sleeping with the porn star?"
Victor nudged him with his shoulder. "This is a very good idea. Trust me, the shorts alone are worth it."
Sherlock: There has been a lot of speculation by myself and other people in the industry, that it was because I "hid" behind a pen name, how young I was when I wrote it, the LGBTQ+ climate at the time and the public's perception of that. But honestly? No one knows for sure.
John chuckled and led him up to his flat. "Close your eyes, Sherlock," he instructed, covering Sherlock's eyes with his hands from behind.
Now, the reason it took a little bit longer to get this chapter out is because after I hit the part this chapter ends I realized (with no small amount of horror on my part) that if I left it as is, the next chapter will be LONG, like by almost 1000 words or so. So I kept writing and ended it on cliffhanger. But I sent it to my beta, and to my husband Sidheman and they both agreed the original stopping point was better story-wise. But I was still having a panic attack that the next chapter was going to be so much longer than this one. But as my adoring husband pointed out, 1000 words may SEEM like a lot, but it's only a couple more pages. So I let cooler heads prevail and you get the chapter as it was intended. And you know, the joy of a nice looooonnnng chapter for next time, of which I have head start on.
John's attempts to speak to Mrs Hudson would only earn him a pat on the arm and the insistence that Sherlock Darling meant well.
Murray sighed. "Well, no. But how else would you explain it? There was no one else there. No evidence of anyone out there but you, surrounded by those not so lucky."
Mr Lyons worked his mouth but no words would form. He coughed discreetly into his hand. "What, no witty remark or biting criticism?"
He raised his hand and hailed a cab. Yes, today was a good day, and it was only going to get better.
"He does?" John felt a warmth spread through his chest. Sherlock and he had been trading text messages and calling each other for the last week. And while John would've said they were almost friends, he didn't know Sherlock had told anyone about him.
But if it does get to that point I have other "one-shots" I can type up while I'm writing "Curses" but with any luck we won't have to worry about that.
Mycroft would return fire, but all the while he was really working his way around Greg, to sneak up on him. He took one of his paintballs and smashed into the back of Greg's head.
Things were going well until Sherlock accidentally deduced Molly's attraction to him in front of everyone.
John licked his bottom lip and Sherlock barely suppressed a shudder. This wasn't the "aroused" lick; no, this was the "about to say something nasty" lick.
John lowered his arms, stumbling back into a bookshelf, and leaned heavily against it to keep his knees from buckling.
Mike and John arrived at the party and immediately John went in search of Sherlock, leaving Mike to awkwardly work the room.
She led him over to a few nearby chairs and then went to get some ice. She carefully dodged teachers and staff alike, not wanting to have to explain what the ice was for.
"Like what?" John thought it would be something like graphic violence or rape or something equally mature.
He lugged them up to the cottage Janine had bought with her tabloid money. He left Sherlock to do his exploring like that mongoose in that story he read once as a boy, popping in and out the rooms, leaping over furniture, and opening every drawer and cupboard.
"Yeah, it came much faster than anyone could have predicted," Mary said, looking behind her into the storm.
"He was only interested in you because he had a bet going with Jim that he would deflower you tonight," Sally said, laying it on as thick as she could.
"He only does the deep background checks on these people because he doesn't want his only living relation dead because one of the guests became violent and tried to kill me."
The curtain went up and a spotlight came on, highlighting the lone figure on the stage. The dark head rose and Sherlock began to dance.
"Really?" Sherlock turned to look at the street rat in amazement. "I thought my brother practiced a more hands-off approach to this show?"
Sherlock let the phone drop on his desk with a thud and buried his head in his hands. He ran his fingers over his face and let out a deep sigh. But before he could wallow in his misery, a shrill chirp sounded from his phone.
"Oh thank god!" Mike huffed. "I wasn't sure if you two were going to make it. It's really coming down out here."
"No, it wasn't you," Sherlock assured him. "It's just that I have this person who's been trying to headhunt me for months and despite my constant refusals, she won't let it drop. She seems to think that she is saving me from something like utter ruin."
Will called his mother and told her the news. She didn't live long enough to attend their funeral. So Will planned Sherlock and John's funeral, while Lily planned their mother's.
"Yes," Mycroft said. "He was that sort, but no. Pike went for the journalist who broke the original story, Kitty Riley. And she was at first fiercely protective of her source, until Pike pulled out his ace with Victor's blog confession. Then she folded like a house of cards."
"Beautiful choice," Tegan said when Anthea showed her. "Come on, let's put it on and see if there are any adjustments to be made."
John only had time to blink twice before the other man did something that caused white-hot pain to shoot down his arm, and then the world went black.
Sherlock grabbed John's thighs to steady him. "Are you aware you had an ancestor who fought in the Second Anglo-Afghan war?"
"When I took medical courses, I had to do one year of a psych rotation, which considering I was still playing, took closer to two years. So, yes. I am far better qualified than a ballet director and his politician husband."
"I'm not supposed to, it could cause them to close," Sherlock replied, throwing his head back in pleasure.
"If you mean physically? Yes, he'll be fine," Mycroft said, tapping the arm of the chair. "But my brother has just learned that the voices that he's been hearing his whole life aren't as much from psychosis as they are from being psychic."
He decided it was best to get out and go for a walk. Preferably before he jumped his flatmate. He stopped at the foot of the sofa and thought about telling Sherlock that he was going, but Sherlock was in his mind palace.
Mummy was up out of her chair in a flash. "Sherlock!" she called out, "Darling, where do you think you are going dressed like that?"
He went running through the halls and slid to a halt as he spotted who he was looking for. A chubby little Asian girl was leaning against the wall next to the classroom and Greg walked right up to her.
He looked at his watch. He had just enough time to catch lunch before heading back to his hotel room and getting his things in time to catch his plane.
Sherlock blinked at him, unfazed. He looked over at Sebastian. "Is this how M&M Prints conducts business? With threats of harassment and then violence when told to stop?"
John stirred and suddenly Sherlock was by his side. A cool hand touched John's forehead, neck, and cheek.
Sherlock and John stood in front of the official performing the ceremony, waiting for him to begin. They stared at each other like the other was a gift and a revelation, their perfect fit.
John kissed Sherlock goodbye before turning and getting on the private jet that would take him far away from the love of his life.
Again some small chuckles, and it took everything John had not to wince. He didn't think the speech was going that badly, but hardly anyone was reacting at all. John looked over at Greg who was glaring at them.
They began their usual chatter, the two of them catching up, and John left them to it. He could see Sherlock whenever he wanted now and didn't want to infringe on Mrs Hudson's only time with the publicist.
"Mike did work for the BBC, just never as an assistant. He was actually in the set dressing department. He had started working there part time, and then when he started making more money doing that, he quit being a doctor. He has,
John got out of the car and closed both doors before heading for the boot. He pulled out their luggage. A large army duffle for him and a sleek leather overnight bag for Sherlock.
John opened his mouth to argue it further when he realized. "Oh. Oh, fuck. I mean– well shit. I meant to say something when I– oh fuck. I assumed you knew." John buried his head in his hands.
"But look at you, John. You have fixed your own limp in defense of a man you didn't like and a book everyone hated. It's that trait as a writer that I want to cultivate. And honestly, if you'll still have me, I would like to get started as soon as possible."
But one look at Sherlock and the bag fell to the floor. John rushed to Sherlock's side. He felt the burn of the carpet as he skidded on his knees in front of his best friend.
said hi to her in the halls, even after Mycroft and Greg got together. She wouldn't have minded it if he asked her to prom, but she wasn't sure what year he was in. She thought he might be in sixth form, but he also seemed older, too. She scoffed, not like it mattered, Mike wasn't the one asking her out.
He looked around, but the only thing of note was a small wooden chair and a tall man in a pinstripe suit that could have fed his family growing up for a year. The man was leaning on an umbrella and watching John disdainfully.
Once John got to the dance floor, he started to dance her direction. His own movements becoming more heated, the closer he got. Soon they were close together, then they were dancing together.
They made proper introductions, of course. They were British, after all. Sherlock was apparently a consulting detective and worked with the police on occasion. And if Sherlock was to be believed, his brother was the British government. Somehow in the introductions, it was missed what Greg did.
"Oh, well, I think you should just come out and tell him how you feel," Mrs Hudson said, putting a finger to the side of her mouth.
John chuckled, "But I have to say that my favorite part is right here." He lifted Sherlock's other leg and buried his face between Sherlock's cheeks.
"I know how to use one just fine, Sherlock," the older of the two brunets sniffed. "The one on our rental was clearly programmed by an idiot. Mummy will be displeased."
"This way!" Sherlock hissed as he slipped into a blind alleyway, John, hot on his heels. They stormed up a couple flights of emergency escape staircases and onto the rooftop. Sherlock deftly leapt over the edge to the nearby building's rooftop.
"Some of us are actually here to watch the game, not ogle buff men in tight uniforms," Greg grumbled.
Hello! Sorry this took sooooo long (it's been a week lol!) I finished it on Wednesday but both me and my beta were busy until tonight.
He walked out of 221 and saw a black sedan waiting for for him. Sherlock sought out the nearest CCTV and mouthed the words 'thank you.'
John was grateful that Friday was here at last. Mrs Hudson had teased him and Sherlock about their "date" at every opportunity. Despite both men repeatedly telling her that it wasn't
John was almost charmed until he remembered the awful things this man had said to him almost every day for the past couple of months.
As for Mrs Watson's illness; that was taken from a school friend's little sister. After six years of horrible back pain and they couldn't figure out what it was, someone x-rayed her stomach and lo and be hold, a cyst on her stomach lining that so big that it pushing into her spine and causing the pain.
"Well, well," Mycroft teased. "Aren't you suddenly Mr Popular? First Irene, then John, and now Jim Moriarty."
A note of warning this chapter has a cliffhanger, so if you want to wait until the next one to read this one, I won't blame you.
John bit his lip and forced down the barracks language that sprang to mind when she did this. He knew what she was attracted to. His confidence and swagger which, to be honest, John thought he'd lost. But with Sherlock Holmes, not only had he gotten it back, he had gotten it back in spades. And to a young woman like Mary, it must have been intoxicating.
Janine raised an eyebrow as she watched her friend awkwardly flirt with Mike, tucking her hair behind her ear and smiling at him.
"It's a memory technique where you attach a memory to place you've been before and by recalling the place you are able to find the memory easier," Sherlock explained.
She browsed the rows and rows of dresses, pausing briefly to look a couple that caught her eye. She was looking at a beautiful wine-colored dress when a thought came to her.
John moved to the fully stocked kitchen, where he began to make them tea. Once it was through steeping, he added milk to his and sugar to Sherlock's. He sat down in the sitting room and settled to wait.
"In David's car," everyone said at once, and for the first time since this whole thing started, Mary well and truly blushed.
Greg swallowed against the dryness of his mouth. He had been severely outclassed. Greg had worn a simple and classic black tux, but without a tie. His head was telling him to run away. Run away before Mycroft spotted him and sneered at his basic attempt at dressing up. His heart was telling him that if he so much as moved, it would burst.
"Sherlock, I've seen you naked before, I assure you helping you in the bath and taking a piss will not be a problem for me, unless it will be a problem for you?" Sherlock shook his head. "Good, we'll start with getting you out of that hideous gown and into some real clothes. We can't have you showing that arse of yours to everyone, now can we?"
He was about to give up when something caught his eye. There in the store window was a beautiful artist's pencil set, complete with a soft leather case. It reminded him of those old movies about archaeologists and their tool kits. He leaned in close to read the price tag.
"It won't be like that. It'll be more like with Molly, just nudging the person in the right direction. I think he's hoping you debunk him, to be honest," Mike assured him.
He shook so many hands that the faces began to blur together, so it came as a surprise when James hugged him.
It had been a grueling pace on the road, and in the end they were slaughtered by the German team. John was exhausted. Physically and mentally. All he wanted to do was shower and then crash in their bed. A bed that would be absent of one Sherlock Holmes, who was on the last leg of his summer tour in America.
"When Greg told me what you had done, I couldn't believe it," he said as he neared them. "But here you are. What the hell were you thinking?"
Mummy tilted her head and hummed, "You know the rules, love. No dating and no prom unless Mycroft is going."
When he got out, she was gone. But every time he went to take a shower, there she was, ever watchful. It was strange, though. It was only when he showered, never when he went to relieve himself.
They munched on goodies and leftovers from the lunch, but mostly stayed in their separate corners for the rest of the evening.
But it wasn't all bad, John finally got an answer to a question that had been plaguing him since he started working at 221Books.
It all came to a head one night after a case. They had chased the robber through a couple of blind alleys and when the Met had caught up to them, John and Sherlock were chatting over the bound criminal.
"Never mind, sorry," James rushed to apologize. "I know you're going to be going on that book tour in a couple of weeks, but I just wanted to let you know–"
"Can't we get at least some intelligent authors?" Mycroft complained. "Hell, at this point I'd take Jane Austen over Ernest Hemmingway."
His mother had spent the whole ride back to her hotel praising John to the sky. It also didn’t hurt that she also criticized John’s girlfriend. Sherlock couldn’t figure out what John saw in her. He figured it must be a superficial attraction to her looks or...Sherlock made a face, other
Greg watched Bertie leave with a feeling a trepidation. If he wasn't fucked before, he certainly was now.
John walked over to the cash box where Mary Morstan stood with the customer. Mary was a sweet-faced young woman in her early twenties. She had bright blue eyes and dyed blonde hair. She was studying to be a nurse and would be working nights once she was fully trained at the shop.
"John," Sherlock breathed out like a sigh. They stumbled through the kitchen and into Sherlock's room, the remainder of their clothes leaving a trail behind them.
"I figured that," John bit out; he was on the verge of losing his temper again. "When do they expect the rain to stop?"
"Katie Dodd, age twenty-one. University of London student. Apparently there is a flaw in the shower door. If you keep the hot water on too long, the metal door seals itself shut."
"Yes, sir." She winced as the other line was disconnected by the phone being slammed into its cradle.
Sherlock gave his shoulder a gentle squeeze and he and John left. As Sherlock was getting into John's car, Mummy came out and sat down next to Mycroft.
"Hey, that's fantastic," John agreed. "If you ever need me to return the favor on this, let me know, right?"
Sherlock must have seen it before it happened, because he was able to catch John before he teetered to ground.
He supposed he should feel grateful that the army sprang for one with an attached bathroom instead of the communal one like he had back during his uni days. He sighed and opened the door.
Sherlock nodded, unable to speak for fear of his voice cracking. He cleared his throat. "Sure, I'm game," he said, just barely managing to make his voice sound normal.
Mike scoffed. "I'm fine, that was your new beloved's older brother, Mycroft Holmes. The Ice Man of Baker Academy."
Mycroft jumped up and snatched it out of her hands. He ripped it open and began jumping up and down. "I got in!" he squealed.
"Yeah," John said weakly. "I was supposed to be meeting with Mycroft, but he had an emergency meeting come up and left Sherlock to take over. And I couldn't keep my temper in check. So, no, I don't think they'll want to publish my book ever. Might even make sure no else does, too."
John loved his job. There was nothing better than being an aspiring writer and getting to be surrounded by books all day. And what was even better, 221 Books was one of those small, intimate bookshops that were rare these days.
Sherlock sat back in his chair and closed his eyes. He opened them slowly. "And what did you tell him?"
The writer in John thought Sherlock looked rather like a maiden from those ridiculous romance novels. "Abandoned by her lover, she seeks the solace of her father's library, to drown herself in the tales of honorable men."
"So I talked to Anthea," Mike told them. "And she said, he 'hates him with the fury of a thousand fiery suns.' That's a direct quote."
John took in the exquisite sight of his boyfriend's long, lean form as Sherlock joined him in the tub. The dancer was gentle as he washed John's body and then his hair. John was enveloped in the love and affection that was pouring out of Sherlock as he washed away John's disappointment, stress and weariness, leaving the rugby player in a state that was pure bliss.
Mycroft was sitting on a bench watching the couples dance and laugh. He knew he should have gone home, but the thought of facing his mother again after another terrible breakup was too embarrassing. So he stayed. He drank punch, danced to the fast songs, and sat out for the slow ones. Because despite everything, Vauxhall Cross was still his favorite band.
"Sorry, Sherlock. I didn't mean to offend you, I just wanted to tell you how much you impress me." John reached across the table to cover Sherlock's hand in his.
Mary and David, who had been coming down the stairs together, groaned in unison. The sleeping arrangements would stay an inconvenient mess.
Sherlock hummed happily but gasped as his boyfriend took advantage of his distraction and pierced Sherlock's hole with his lubed up finger.
He was rubbing his hands and pacing back and forth, as he waited for his cue. He had stopped short of tugging at his hair because he wouldn't have had time to fix it before he went on stage.
"Made the Ice Man human," Bertie sneered and pointed at where Mycroft was now dancing on the kitchen table.
Sherlock pushed past him and yelled over his shoulder, "Some brother you are!" and ran up the stairs.
His heart won by default because without Greg realizing it, Mycroft had come to stand in front of him.
Sherlock stormed out and nearly ran into Mycroft. "Can't you convince some muppet to take you to prom so that I can experience a normal adolescence for once in my life?"
Mycroft leveled his gaze at John and the doctor didn't falter for a second. Mycroft rolled his eyes. "Fine. When Sherlock was a teenager, our mother passed away. I was already finished with university by then, being Sherlock's elder by seven years, and had moved away. When she first passed on it seemed that our father was merely grieving. But he began to have people come over to the house. Mystics, mediums, shamans. All trying to communicate with our mother.
He had made sure to go and buy new clothes for this meeting after Mr Holmes pointed out the shabbiness of his clothing. He just hoped he looked all right. He considered unbuttoning the top button, but he worried it might look unprofessional.
A minor word; Greg knowing about John BEFORE his conversation with Mycroft is NOT a plot hole. Greg lovingly lied to his husband to give him the reaction he so richly deserved. But I don't like putting "he lied". I think it pulls you out of the story unless it's done for comedic or dramatic effect.
It had taken John a lot of work and maybe just a bit of emotional blackmail to get Sherlock to even agree to come out with John and his friends for John's birthday party. But now that he was out, he wished he had taken Sherlock's advice and stayed home.
"You're not my worst enemy," John said softly. "That honor goes to the rat bastard, who in one fell swoop of a bullet, ended my military and medical career. You don't even make my top five."
"Don't listen to Mike, Sherlock," he said, as he unpacked some books, "this is a lovely house. It's perfect."
Mummy sighed. "I know what goes on at these parties, dears. Drugs and alcohol. Unprotected sex. Orgies are next, I have no doubt."
Sherlock looked behind him and smiled at the goofy grin John was sporting. He shook his head and went into the house.
Sherlock had opened the letter to reveal the deed to the cottage they were sitting in, with John's signature next to his name and a blank space for Sherlock to put his.
Thanks to my beta Old Ping Hai who kept poking at me to finish it even when I despaired. I hope it is well worth the wait. The ending is much different then when I wrote it months ago. But better I think.
"Come along, then." John took Sherlock's hand and led him to the table where a veritable feast was laid out. Sherlock had made all of John's favorite dishes and the rugby player knew they would be eating the leftovers for days.
Mike cracked his neck. "It's a waste. They should just sell it, but they keep saying they'll come back up here. They're retired and they still haven't made the effort."
He took a deep breath and walked into Mycroft's flat. He had assumed it would be like the house in Sussex, but he couldn't have been more wrong. While the house was quite old fashioned in its design, Mycroft's flat was sleek and modern, but not in an abstract, minimalist sort of way. It was very stylish.
"Hey, Sherlock. I'm glad you got my number. I was seconds away from begging Mrs Hudson for it. -JHW"
File that under one more thing that John has said that he didn't mean the way Sherlock would have preferred.
"Who me?" John asked. "I mean, sure. I would rather face down a group of insurgents, my sister at her most drunk,
It wasn't until she had almost finished her first cup of coffee did she properly greet her boyfriend. "Morning, John," she said pecking him on the cheek. "Thank you for the coffee. You know I'm a beast without it."
The restaurant John chose was a nice, upscale French bistro with a soothing atmosphere and tasteful decor.
He began washing and preparing his turkey. John scoffed. As if: this thing could barely be called a chicken, it was that small. But he was only feeding himself and even then it was still too much for one person.
Mycroft ran his fingers over his mouth and closed his eyes. He opened them and said, "God, I don't even know how to say this."
Greg lifted his head and couldn't believe that he had finally gotten to kiss this beautiful boy. So he just had to do it again. He leaned down to kiss Mycroft once more. Their lips had barely touched when Greg felt a paintball hit the side of his face. He reeled back.
John knocked on Sherlock's bedroom door. There was a highly disgruntled sound that came from the other side that John decided to take as permission to come in. He pushed open the door and slipped in quietly, closing the door behind him.
"Yes!" he cried. It well within his budget. He went in and immediately scooped it up before anyone else could.
Sherlock shook his head. "You may want to finish that before I tell you. I don't want you to choke."
“Christ!” Greg cursed and Sherlock looked up. He saw the expression on his director’s face and blushed. He put the phone away and moved to stand next to the bar.
John looked down and silently cursed himself for ruining his plan. "I was going to be so clever about it and everything."
Sherlock walked into the house that he was renting with John and tossed his wallet and keys on the island in the kitchen.
And here it is my darlings, the conclusion to our lovely story. I hope it lives up to the expectations.
asked what had gotten into him lately, but John just told her that he couldn't wait to spend their first Christmas together. That seemed to appease her, and John was a little more careful about how much he excitement he showed around her, in case she figured it out.
John chuckled. "I figured you would. That's why I called you. You are a good friend and very loyal."
"There. Is. No. Purse," Greg bit out. "You told us not to touch the scene until you got here. And nothing has been moved. If there is a purse, it's not in plain view."
He waved at John and called for Mrs Hudson. She came running out of the back room to throw her arms around his neck.
The former soldier's shoulders sagged and he stopped dead in the middle of the pavement, head hanging down.
John buried his head into Sherlock's chest, the shorter man's arms tucked between them. There was silence for a few moments, before Sherlock spoke.
John sat in one of the best boxes at the Royal Opera House, his left fist clenching and unclenching.
He had a job to do and worrying about her mood was not it. But as the day went on, it became increasingly his problem as she abused books, the cash box, and customers alike. John pulled her aside after the third patron complained.
"You thought I was calling you a mad bastard, when I first encountered Milverton, didn't you?" John asked.
The next couple of days saw Sherlock eating off John's plate and the doctor making sure to prepare enough for two, or at least one and half. By the time the week was out, Sherlock was back on his feet and terrorizing Lestrade for cases. John wasn't surprised when the Detective Inspector told him in no uncertain terms that Greg would not let Sherlock anywhere near a crime scene until he got the okay from John. Something John refused to give.
"You're telling me," Greg agreed. He took a closer look at his star. Sherlock was lean and fair-skinned to begin with, but now he looked gaunt and pale. The man's hands shook, and when he noticed Greg watching him, promptly put them in the pockets of that massive coat of his. A coat that Sherlock could hardly bear the weight of.
John ran to get towels and the first aid kit in case it was needed. Burns were nasty and shouldn't be taken lightly. But by the time he had returned, Sherlock Darling had taken off. John sighed, but went about cleaning up the mess.
"Bah humbug!" he hissed at the thing. He sighed and picked it up to dust off the scuff marks from his shoe. He sighed again, more heavily.
"Fuck," John said from the doorway. They turned to the sound and then sprung from each other as if the other suddenly turned too hot to touch.
He decided that she wasn't his type anyway by the time they got to the estate. Which was absolutely gorgeous. It was a stately home that wasn't big or ostentatious. And was nestled in a set of woods that would make Jane Austen fans green with envy. John fell in love immediately.
"It's so good to see you, Sherlock," Victor enthused, warmly taking Sherlock's hand and shaking it, while placing his other hand on the detective's shoulder.
John couldn't remember much of the past couple of days, but he remember a whispered plea from Greg and Sherlock's insistence that he couldn't leave John.
"Ooh..." Mycroft teased. "I hadn't realized that your relationship with the good doctor had progressed that far."
Sherlock opened his mouth and then closed it. "Only a handful, and of those handful, only two lasted longer than the night," he admitted shyly.
John spent the morning messaging Sherlock back and forth. He couldn’t keep the smile off his face every time he got a new message from the dancer. He felt giddy. He hadn’t felt this way when he first started dating Cathy. Or Mary, or Gail, or hell even Hugh or Darren. That wasn’t to say he wasn’t happy when they called or messaged him, but there was something in Sherlock’s demeanor that suggested that he didn’t do this sort of thing, and that made John feel special somehow.
"John..." Sherlock had a million questions, but they had to wait. John was clearly in a lot of pain. He opened his mouth to ask further about how hurt he was, when he realized John was unbuttoning his shirt and Sherlock's brain went off line.
They were about to turn and go up the stairs when John stopped in his tracks. There in the middle of the hall was a blonde woman in a wedding dress. But that wasn't what made he stop. No, it was the fact that she was pointing a Beretta 92S at Sherlock, her finger on the trigger.
He closed the doors and again struggled to his feet. He really should have asked Sherlock exactly where they were. He was about to give up when he spotted a green trunk by the door. He went over and opened it.
John smiled fondly. "Yeah, I can see that, the two of you bickering over the fence about whose flowers are pushing the other's out."
"Some lights, the kitchen; no internet, though," Sherlock replied, his shoulders hunching up around his ears.
"I heard. It was tragic, but Sherlock is a bit of cold fish, isn't he? He couldn't have been much comfort for you, I could, maybe..." she trailed off, biting her lip suggestively.
And just like that, John felt a rush of sympathy for the other man. He knew what it was like living with something that other people would scoff and sneer at, having come home from the war with PTSD.
"Whatever," Sherlock said, waving her protest away. "If you want to come to one of our performances, I'll make sure to leave two tickets under your name at the will call."
There were five people, two men and three women in the shop all wearing variations of the same outfit, black trousers, white button-up and comfortable shoes, so Anthea assumed that they were all employees. She briefly wondered if there was a Tegan or if she had been made up or was no longer part of the shop, but the next moment answered her question.
David was the only one not in on the celebrating. "What an idiotic thing to do, propose at Christmas, everyone knows if you're going to propose on a holiday, you do it on Valentine's Day."
The politician tapped on the paper in front of him. "Would you care to explain this?" The please was so heavily implied that John took a step back, before surging forward to pick up the paper.
He became concerned when they stopped at a cemetery next to an old church. John got out and told the cabby to wait for them. They wouldn't be long.
"I know how that goes," John agreed. "Now that I'm out of the army, I worry I'll just pack on the pounds."
"Hey, I'll go with ya!" Greg said. "I'd love to pick your brains on the inner workings of your sport."
John squeezed his eyes shut. "Not that, Sherlock. I've made my peace with both of those facts. Honest. I just don't have the words to describe what it is I want."
But he was being polite, which meant whatever it was, it lay with Mycroft to grant. And he would grant it. Mycroft didn't care if it was to bomb half of the western bloc; if it meant seeing his brother like this again, he'd do it.
Greg picked up his backpack and was rifling through it looking for something to do when Prof Smallwood let out a surprised gasp.
Just then the room again lit up in an impressive lightning array. Followed closely by a near deafening boom of thunder.
When he came to, he was draped over the shoulder of an army medic. And if the boots were any indication, it was most likely Bill Murray, the combat nurse. The man had very large feet.
Every time he felt that he was holding John back from socializing, the doctor would stand up and off they'd go.
Sherlock ducked his head, but he couldn't hide the pleased smile that spread across his face. "We should be getting cards for both of us in the mail in the next couple of days," he concluded.
John looked between the manager and Sherlock. "He can come share our table, or rather we can share his, if he and his mother are amenable."
He turned to go, but turned back. "Though there is one other person's wedding I'd go to if they ever got married."
Mary rolled her eyes. "You want to talk about unprofessional, how about we talk about how you were quite obviously out all night and came in looking like you had had sex."
John turned to him, "Come on, you don't think that a guy like Sherlock wouldn't be interested in me?"
"Yes, do in get in the car, Victor. I'd make some kind of threat, but I'm sure you are aware of the danger you're in," Mycroft said, leaning forward so he could look up at Victor.
Thanks as always to my wonderful beta, who just makes everything better. If you know who I am, then you know who she is.
Langdale pushed Victor toward the opened door and then slid inside once Victor had haltingly entered the vehicle.
"Thank you all for coming," John began. "I know all of you think that we are here to support Sherlock's recent success-"
"Ha!" he cried out when he found it. He took it out to the waiting room and proceeded to tape the monster to the wall.
"John," Mike said, tentatively. "We have petrol for the generator, I don't know if it's enough to get you to station, but–"
Bertie immediately jumped in and began cheering Mycroft on, joining the throng of other students chanting and cheering.
"By kidnapping John, dragging him to an abandoned building, offering him money to never see me again, and then leaving me to wonder where it all went wrong?"
"Yes, but you know, and it'll make it easier to figure out how to get him to overcome whatever the hell this is."
With every word John forced Victor back a step, crowding him until his back hit the side of the shop. He turned and looked at Sherlock, who was grinning like the Cheshire cat.
"You do realize that keeping me cooped up in here isn't the best idea, right?" Sherlock said as John moved back to his chair, changing the topic as the air seemed to crystallize with the tension of things left unsaid.
John nodded and watched as the two brothers walked off. He frowned in thought, but did as Mycroft bid. It would have been a waste to let all this good food and drink spoil just because something had come up.
A cheer went up and Bertie fought his way to his feet, but was ignored as the crowd took up the chant, "Kiss, kiss!"
"How often does this happen?" John asked, his temper rising even more with the short, almost non-answers he was getting from Sherlock.
If you've seen the movie, you'll note that I changed the scene with the drunk girl. I couldn't reconcile this scene with what happens later. So I fixed it.
John needed to have him closer, so he dragged the detective down to the floor with him. The soft moan that came from Sherlock was the most wonderful thing that he had every heard. It was so pure and yet so sensuous. John loved it. Loved him.
"Don't get me wrong, I was having fun before your little show came along, but when I saw it for the first time I knew you'd be fun to play with. So I left the States to come to this side of the Atlantic." Brook closed his eyes, "It was
In the car already was a plump man with wire-framed glasses who chuckled, "How many more people are you going to piss off today?" he asked.
Bertie put his hands in his pockets and thrust his chin at Mike, "And what do you get out of this?" He narrowed his eyes suspiciously.
They went back to work hauling in boxes and furniture without further comment. Once they had finished this load, Mike looked around with a frown.
"Oh? Like what?" Mummy was curious. She was finally able to pin down one of her children about last night, as Sherlock had been deliberately dodging her all morning.
John started pulling ingredients out of the icebox and began to make what he had planned. And that was an awful lot. He did the wontons first as they could be kept warm without having them get soggy or dry. Then he pan fried vegetables and noodles as the rice cooked. Then the chicken fried rice.
John got out a notebook and a pen to keep notes. Grammar and punctuation would be gone over with his editor once he got one; this was about plot and what needed to be fixed to make the story worth being published.
"And of course we can't forget this beautiful thing," John rasped and took Sherlock's cock into his mouth. Sherlock jackknifed off the bed and curled his body around John, his hands gripping the rugby player's head, trying to grasp at the short strands, his leg still draped over John's shoulder.
Sherlock looked over at the glass case containing the thumb drive that held his stories. "The drive might not even work," he reasoned.
Sherlock huffed, "This is hateful." London passed by the windows, lights of the city flashing patterns on their faces as the cab made its way back to Baker Street.
Bertie stuck his hands in his pockets and slowly advanced on Mycroft, "Oh, I'll leave him alone, but I can't guarantee that he'll leave me alone."
Mike hugged them both and then put his arms around one of each of their shoulders. "Be good to each other."
Mike looked over at Mary, who had her fingers wrapped around the meaty muscle of the Marine's arm. They both knew the reason. She had deliberately come out to make sure he saw that she was doing fine without him. The fact that John was trying to hide from her told Mary all she needed to know about the state of his heart.
Victor rolled his eyes and said firmly, "You are here being a good friend to me, staying with me while my boyfriend is off charming people, and of course supporting a good cause."
Mary, Molly, and David were relieved that they were leaving at last. Though for Molly it was a jumbled bag of emotion, she mostly felt relief. Divya was right, she needed to like herself before she started crushing on every handsome, single man who paid attention to her for two seconds.
Once John had got off the train, he looked around the station, scanning the crowd for whoever Mr Holmes sent to pick him up. Whatever he was expecting, it certainly wasn't the lovely woman with dark eyes and brown hair wearing a smart trouser suit.
"Hmm, very good," he purred and then set it on the counter to finish carving up the bird. Sherlock handed him a piece of the white meat and John took a bite, instead of just taking it from him.
Mrs Hudson sat at her laptop and chewed on her lip. She was trying to find the right word. "Miss Hooper!"
"He thinks he's Sir Galahad battling trolls," Mrs Hudson teased. "John, please. Even I know that internet trolls aren't worth the effort."
Cathy huffed. "And you expect us to believe all that?" She sat back in her chair and crossed her arms. "You clearly haven't seen a game of rugby in your life if you claim what you do is more painful."
"Alrighty, Capt Holmes," John said mimicking a pirate accent. "If Imma gonna go get the booty, Imma need a map." He handed the papers and pen to the other man.
John chuckled. "As amazing as that would be, Sherlock," John shook his head, "what I want the most you can't give me."
John got out his phone with a frown, and then his face lit up. He smiled warmly at his phone, before looking around for Sherlock.
