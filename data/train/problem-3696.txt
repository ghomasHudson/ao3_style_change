John finally turns to look at Sam and Dean, as if he is only now realizing they are present. Sam tries again to coax him towards the sidewalk.
Dean squinted at the pictures on his phone.  They were both nearly identical.  Cas, stonily staring down his phone’s camera, in his basic suit and trenchcoat ensemble in both pictures. In one he was wearing a green tie, and in the other photo a red tie.
Happy with his message, Dean hit send.  He smiled to himself and waited for Cas to reply.
[message received 9:40 pm]
Dean helps Castiel over the threshold and into the shelter.
Sam was as excited as, well, a kid on Christmas Eve.
“I’m sorry for intruding,” Cas says, sitting up, “I just couldn’t sleep in my room. I thought I would come in here for a few minutes, but I didn’t mean to still be here when you came in.” Cas moves to get out of the bed, but Dean stops him with a firm hand to his shoulder.
The lights went low, and the cheers of the crowd got louder.  Dean could hear the people, but they all seemed to fade away into the darkness, and he couldn’t make out anyone’s faces.  No one except the athletic dancer who made her way onto the stage when the spotlight hit the curtain.
“Looks great,” he said, willing Cas to cover himself back up, and hoping his voice didn’t sound as high-pitched as it did in his head.
Dean settles back on the pillows to sleep, still holding Castiel’s hand between them.  That’s as much as he’s willing to give right now.  An anchor, to tie him to the fact that this thing between the two of them is real now, and a reminder of the body that is making it possible.
Cas doesn’t complain again after that. Dean continues for a few more moments, leading Cas in their slow-motion, horizontal jumping jacks. Eventually, Dean stills his movements, and carefully climbs to his feet, so as not to disturb his work. He walks over to Cas, and helps the other man up, so he can see what they’ve done.
“Azrael? It was you all this time?” Castiel questions the dark figure.
“You know that’s not real butter,” commented Cas.
Castiel cleared his throat quickly, to distract Dean. “Fifteen women huh? That is quite active.”
Castiel gave him a withering look. “Yes, Dean, I know. I was there when the Heavens were created.”
“Dean – dad’s gone.”
Sam looks at him like he’s trying to imagine why he got all the brains in the family.
. I’m sorry. Neither of you wear rings, so I assumed -” she cut off her own thought and seemed to change topic mid-sentence, “I see if you’re undercover you might not be able to wear jewelry that would give it away. I get it. Don’t worry Detective I won’t say another word about it.”
Lawrence is one of those towns most people don’t give a second glance. It is an average sized town, with average businesses, and average people. Tonight those people are going about their average lives. Shopkeepers are locking their doors, as people head home to have dinner with their families. It is nearing sunset, as the town quiets down for another evening. The sky is a vibrant orange, stretching out across the Kansas plains.
“Dean would prefer it if I were current on popular culture, but obviously there are many more important things that have taken up my time,” Castiel explains, as if it should be apparent to the humans in the room that global wars between Heaven and Hell take precedence over action movies and comic books.
[message received 9:30 pm]
It’s a good thing the Men of Letters bunker is meant to house an entire secret society. Sam and Dean each have their own bedrooms, which is nothing short of a miracle after growing up sleeping side-by-side in dingy motel rooms. There are still more than enough rooms to accommodate their two new houseguests. Dean makes sure Kevin has his room figured out, then goes to check on Sam.
“Cas,” Dean interrupted.
“Leviathans. Long story.”
“And I’m here if you need to talk, but right now it’s almost 3am so I’m going to bed. Good night Dean.”
“Yes, Dean?”
Castiel doesn’t respond to Dean, except to weakly nod, as Dean leaves him to rest.
“Can you make sure Jimmy gets the Deluxe Package in Heaven?”
That’s when Sam drops to his knees beside Dean and starts coughing up blood too. Dean feels a panic for Sam, more than he feels for himself. Sam is still going through the trials. He isn’t strong enough to handle this.
“Dean look-“ Sam starts, but Dean cuts him off.
“Well, this year is different,” Dean continues, as if Sam hadn’t popped his yuletide bubble. “This year we have a home. This year we can do it right.”
She patted Dean’s arm politely.
There were a few things in life Dean Winchester was grateful for; his family, his car, and 24-hour roadside diners. Even at one o’clock in the morning, after taking out a vamp nest, he could order a short stack of pancakes, with a side of bacon and sausage. He’d earned it.
Dean doesn’t know if Sam is right or not. In that moment, Dean doesn’t want to know. All he wants is for things to go back to normal, but he doesn’t see that happening. So, Dean does what he does best.
“Remember in Gabriel’s TV Land, how excited I was to see Doctor Sexy? Or Aaron Bass when I called him my ‘gay thing’. Or that time when my siren was a man.”
“Do you think maybe we could do that inside?” Cas asks, “I’m not sure I can feel my toes anymore.”
“Uhh, no offense doc, but where is my usual doctor?”
Dean feels Cas tense up beside him, and for a moment he thinks he made a horrible mistake. This is confirmed when he looks over to see Cas crying. He’d made a former angel cry. That’s messed up even for a Winchester, Dean thinks to himself. He opens his mouth to apologize, but is stopped short when Cas speaks.
“Dean, you know that’s not true.”
Dean squints in confusion at his father’s odd phrasing, but before he can reply there is a sharp crack of noise nearby, as the heavy hardwood door next to them splinters. A deep red symbol appears burned into the door. Dean’s hunter senses kick in, quickly scanning the area for threats, as he draws the demon knife out of his pocket. Nothing obvious jumps out at them. He looks over to Sam, who seems okay, but John is breathing heavily. He looks down at the sidewalk to where Castiel is looking around anxiously.
he thinks to himself.
[message sent 9:35 pm]
“Goodnight, Cas” he says, slightly relaxing his hold around the angel so they both can sleep.
Amazingly, Dean, Sam, and their two new passengers make it back to the bunker in one piece. Either Crowley isn’t tracking Kevin, or he has been distracted by some other toy. Dean doesn’t want to know as long as it doesn’t involve them. He is just happy to see the door of the bunker when they arrive. Kevin helps Sam grab the gear out of the trunk, as the younger Winchester is still a little unstable on his feet.
Sam saw this brother start to weaken, and played his big cards. “You can cook a big dinner, with all the leftovers. We could invite all the people who have helped us over the years. Charlie, Jody, Kevin, Cas.”
Cas’ returning smile could have lit up the darkened room on its own.
Dean knew that Dr. Sexy marathon would paid off.
“Are you telling me I actually get to meet Castiel?!” Charlie shrieks in delight, “I hope he’s just as dreamy as the books described him.”
Dean can hear the smile on Castiel’s face as he responds, “I’ll do my best.”
Thank you everyone for reading! Come say hello on my
Halfway into the third movie, Cas’ head slumps onto Dean’s shoulder. Dean looks over to notice that Charlie and Kevin have also fallen asleep, leaning up against each other. Dean squashes down his big brother urge to cover them both with a blanket. Besides, that would mean standing and disturbing the angel currently using him as a body pillow.
“See what you get for not helping me in the library?”
Castiel replaced the tattoo above Dean’s heart, while simultaneously restarting the organ and getting the blood pumping again. He pressed a final kiss to Dean’s lips, sending the breath of life throughout his body. Satisfied that his work was done, Castiel left to report back to Heaven. He knew he would see Dean again very soon.
“Feeling better today huh?” Dean asks to break up the silence.
“I’m not cut out for this Sammy. I can’t do this. I’m just going to mess it up.”
“Okay,” Dr. Novak said, moving closer and putting on his stethoscope, “Let’s listen to that heart.”
, he thought to himself, and the proud feeling makes him want to do it again.
Dean whirled around to stare at Sam, his face gave off a “deer in the headlights” look.
“You didn’t see a light at the end of the tunnel. I told you if you followed me, I would show you a way out. A reason worth living.”
Castiel knew that the Righteous Man had work to do, but he couldn’t help the way Dean’s soul clung to his grace, like a frightened child who didn’t want to ever let go. Castiel knew the other angels could help rebuild Dean, but he felt compelled to do it himself. So he secreted them away and began to rebuild on his own.
Sam smiled and clapped too. He officially had a brother-in-law. Even if that brother-in-law was an angel, which might complicate things, it didn’t matter at the moment. Dean had found someone he could really call a partner, in every sense of the word. Sam wasn’t sure if it was fate or destiny that had brought Dean and Cas together, but it didn’t change the fact that they were right for each other. Dean was happy, and so was their unconventional, extended family.
“Uh, yeah Dean,” he says slowly, “Didn’t you know that already?”
“Dean, how often do you have sex?”
“Just breathe,” came the command at his ear, closer and warmer than he had expected.
“Don’t worry about it Cas. Let’s just get you taken care of.”
However, this night is not the same as any other. The idyllic sunset is quickly ruined as ominous gray clouds roll in, darkening the sky instantly. Thunder rolls through the town, like a tsunami, drowning out all sounds of life below. Lightning bolts manifest from nowhere, faster than any meteorologist could have predicted. The wind howls, fierce and deafening, scaring the local residents into thinking that a tornado has decided to pay them an unannounced visit. People run for shelter, shepherding their families into basements and cellars, to wait out the storm.
“I don’t really remember much. Just woke up in our old front yard in Lawrence yesterday. Not a scratch on me. Didn’t even know what year it was until I walked over to Missouri’s to borrow her phone. That’s when she called Sam,” John explains.
Next, Dean goes to check on Castiel. He is also lying fully clothed on his bed, but his breathing is erratic and he is gripping his stomach in pain. Dean lifts up his shirt, to bandage the wound. Castiel may be an angel, but Dean is going to treat him like he is human. He doesn’t know any other way.
Dean looks over to Cas. His cheeks are flushed pink and he seems happy. In just a few moments though, the smile slips off Cas’ face, and he frowns instead.
I did a lot of research for this fic (like a true Winchester) and if anyone wants to read the website Sam is referencing in Chapter Four it can be found
“And I don’t know if you’ve noticed, umm, but lately people have been thinking we’re a couple.”
Sam thought about how the spell must have worked. Dean had made his family and friends a home-cooked meal in his own kitchen, and got to enjoy all of them being together. Dean had not only his own home, but his own room, which he had gotten to show to his crush. He finally had a space all his own, and people to share it with. Dean Winchester craved the normal domestic life, the one he never got to have growing up. And his subconscious desire had been to fit Castiel into that life. That must have been what the spell reacted to. Sam smiled, thinking his brother could put on a brave, gruff exterior, but he really had the biggest heart of them all.
“Charlie, stop talking,” Dean barks.
Dean barks out a short laugh. “Yeah, you missed the boat on that one dad. I actually did try to have that life. I lived with a woman and her son for a year, but all it did was put them in danger. And it made me realize that this is who I am always going to be – a hunter.”
“Not warded … against angels…” Cas manages to scold him, even while injured.
“Do you need anything?” Dean asks, “Some special angel medicine or a spell or something?”
Thirty minutes later, Dean, Cas, Charlie and Kevin are watching a marathon of Batman movies in the Men of Letters study. Charlie had insisted that they commandeer a sofa she had seen in one of the bedrooms. She also wasn’t satisfied until Dean figured out how to make popcorn (the old-fashioned way – in a pan on the stove – since they don’t own a microwave). Charlie happily babbles about the merits of Christopher Nolan’s Batman, over that of Tim Burton’s, as she passes the popcorn to Castiel, who just stares at it.
“So what’s up Cas? Your cousins are out causing trouble, because of all the mix-up in Heaven right now?” Dean asks. “Does that sound right?”
The ceremony was brief, and it wasn’t long before the judge was asking Dean to give his ring to Castiel. Sam pulled it out of his jacket pocket, and handed it to his brother.
“Why do you keep doing nice things for me Dean?”
“Dean, look, Jimmy is not aware of what just happened.  But, if it would make you feel any better, I can ask his permission.”
“I’m naked.”
“Like this?” Cas asks.
With the free hand not currently trapped under a seraph, Dean brings it up to lie on Cas’ forehead, checking his temperature. He feels warm to the touch, but then Dean realizes he has no baseline for how angels are supposed to feel. All of that power inside a vessel probably burns quite hot. Like being chained to a comet, Jimmy had said. Then again, Lucifer had commented that he burned cold, but maybe that was just him and not all angels.
has been collecting.”
“Take him to his room, Kevin, I’ll be right behind you,” Dean says, opening the back door of the Impala to drag Castiel out. Dean hoists Cas out of the car, carrying almost all of the angel’s weight on one shoulder.
“So where’s Sam?” Charlie asks, looking around as if the taller Winchester were her only concern.
“I guess we’ll have to go back to Lawrence. Visit the old house and see what we can find there. It’s late already. Let’s all get a few hours of shut eye and we’ll head out in the morning,” Dean replies.
When Dean looks up, Cas launches a perfect snowball at him. Dean sputters around the snow quickly melting off his face. Apparently, he had underestimated Cas. That won’t happen again.
They didn’t speak because they didn’t need to. A lifetime of words, spoken through the years of stolen moments and intense stares, had already said more than they could at this moment. This angel turned man – this supernatural, ethereal being – had come back no matter how many times Dean had pushed him away. Anything Dean might say would be lacking in weight, or might spoil the moment. Sometimes the best way to communicate is without words.
. Like we’re a couple or ask if we’re married. Like that waiter at the diner tonight. It’s not the first time something like that has happened recently.”
“I can reach in, and see if he still has a soul,” Castiel offers.
- end of discussion.”
“Almost ten years.”
“I’m going to have to insert another finger, in order to locate your prostate. Is that alright, Dean?”
“Yes!” Cas shouts in annoyance.
“I rebuilt her from the ground up – twice. Once after that semi hit us,” Dean looks over to John. The implied
When they get up five or six hours later, Dean stays close to Cas’ orbit; in the kitchen making everyone sandwiches or leaning over his shoulder when he’s looking up cases on Dean’s laptop.
Dean closed his eyes and shook his head, which sort of made the room spin, so not his best idea.  He opened his eyes and the pictures were still on his phone.  Okay, so he wasn’t that drunk.
“Look, Cas, you can stay here until you’re healed up. But, and I’m only going to say this once, you need to figure out where it is that you want to be. If you’re going to be here, you have to start trusting me. That’s the only way this is going to work.”
After that, Sam insisted they watch a marathon of Christmas movies together. While Dean held firm on his favorite being
Sam thought they could all use a little extra happiness now and then.
“You look out for my boys, you hear?” he asks, but it’s not really a question. Castiel seems to understand and he gives John his most sincere expression.
John stares at his eldest son, with a look of bewilderment. Probably more due to the fact that his son – ever the good soldier – had dared to raise his voice to his father, and less about what Dean had actually said.
Dean finds Sam in the library, holding John’s journal. He looks sick, and more tired than Dean has ever seen him. Dean keeps thinking if they can just close the gates of Hell, then things will get better. Sam has always said he wants to stop hunting, and maybe he should be. He’s always been trying to get away – to Stanford, to law school, to a better life. Dean wants that for him. Even if he’s never been able to say that, he does want Sammy to have a normal life if he can.
“Cas, would you like to try dating me - officially this time - and see how it goes?”
“Look, dick,” Dean can’t help but interject, “I don’t know who you are but Cas – “
The woman finally looks over at Dean, as if noticing him for the first time since she came over. That’s unusual in itself, because Dean is good looking, and he knows it. He gets hit on by women all the time. And this one just walked right by him. Maybe that’s why she ruffled his feathers. Maybe with Cas getting all of the attention he was feeling jealous. What else could it be?
“Now, I’ve tried to warm up the gel, but this may still feel a bit cool and slippery,” the doctor said.
“Sam - all of those things were me.”
Late on Christmas Eve, they all sat up watching the twinkling lights on the tree. It was idyllic, and the only thing missing was a roaring fire. Dean figured the absence of any demonic activity in the area more than made up for that fact. Just before midnight, Sam had declared he was tired and had gone to bed. Kevin followed soon after, leaving Dean and Cas alone.
Besides an extensive knowledge of how to kill monsters, Sam also knows that magic actually exists. And not the David Copperfield sort of magic. Magic that can conjure, control, or kill. But not all witches have to be evil. He thinks of Patrick and his wife, who actually were not all bad. And of course, Sam does not intend to use magic for evil. He knows there are some simple spells that will not require anything like payment of his soul.
Hours later in the library, books and papers spread across all the tables, they are no closer to figuring out what might have happened to bring John back. Bringing someone back from the dead requires a lot of power. Castiel is fairly certain it wasn’t an angel, but they can’t rule it out. It’s not like Cas can pop into Heaven and ask, what with being on their Most Wanted List and all.
That was until Castiel reached down to start stroking Dean’s cock in time with his movements inside Dean. Dean let out a long, low moan. Everything felt so good. He didn’t know if he should fuck forward into Castiel’s fist, or arch back onto his fingers. He tried to do both, and ended up a panting, writhing mess on the exam table. A sheen of sweat broke out across his forehead. He couldn’t remember sex ever feeling like this before. He already couldn’t wait to come, knowing how it would feel amazing, but also not wanting it to end.
The rest of the weekend is spent showing Cas all the traditions of being human at Christmas. Sam and Dean teach him how to make popcorn and cranberry garlands for the tree. They make Cas try warm apple cider, cocoa, and hot buttered rum drinks throughout the day. He declares the hot chocolate is his favorite, especially when Dean adds whipped cream to it.
“Castiel huh? Bit of a unique name.”
“Just that there was a terrible lightning storm in Lawrence last night. So strong, people thought it might be a freak tornado. It disappeared as quickly as it came. No one injured. Nothing out of the ordinary except for dad coming back, as far as we could tell.”
The only person who seems content to wallow is Cas. Something about the holiday must have reminded him of Heaven, because his depression seems to have gotten worse. He leaves his room only once a day to eat, and that’s it. Dean knows how it feels, to lose what you love the most, but he also knows the way Cas is acting won’t help him feel better. Dean makes up his mind to intervene, no matter the consequences. He doesn’t have a specific plan in mind, other than showing Cas a change of scenery. He practically drags Cas to the front door and hands him a heavy winter coat.
Dinner was great. It felt like a normal party, with Jody wearing a festive sweater, and Charlie bringing alone mulled wine for the meal. Dean’s food was excellent and everyone was making happy conversation, straying away from talking about all of the weirdness in their lives. Jody and Garth actually got along really well, both being straightforward people. Kevin was mostly quiet, but it was sweet to see Charlie try to ease him out of his shell, keeping up a steady chatter about movies and video games. Castiel didn’t need to eat, but he sat across the table from Dean watching him as he ate. And he even tried a bite of the pecan pie, once he had learned that Dean made it from scratch.
At least, Dean was happy to have Kevin back with them until the day he tried to get Cas’ help with the tablet. That seemed to trigger a bad memory that caused to Cas spend the next three days moping around the bunker, barely getting out of bed. Dean carefully hides any alcohol and pills they have laying around.
“Uh oh. What happened to Detective Page,” the woman asked when Dean returned alone.
“Now, do what I do,” Dean says. He slowly drags his arms through the snow above his head, and back down to his sides. Once he sees Cas is following along, he starts kicking his legs in and out too. Cas does the same, even if it lacks enthusiasm.
A female witness, with dark auburn hair and brown eyes, who seemed to have the hots for Cas. She tried to turn everything he was saying into a joke or an innuendo. And she kept playing with her hair and smiling at him. Cas was polite, trying to keep up their appearance as police detectives, and not giving her much attention. But that didn’t seem to throw her off.
Dean snaps out of his memories when he hears the front door to the bunker open. He wants to shout to Sammy where they are, but he doesn’t want to wake any of the others. The next Batman film is starting, so Sam will be able to follow the sound and locate them.
Dean had to actually take a few deep breaths and blink several times.  He looked around the room, to make sure he was actually awake this time, before staring at his phone again.  Because what he was seeing couldn’t actually be real.  Could it?  Because what he was seeing was one half of Castiel’s face, the slope of his bare shoulder, and a flare of shiny black feathers behind him.
“It’s not good,” Sam explains, “We think someone could be trying to raise Michael from the Pit. They could raise Lucifer too, whether they intend to or not. It would be Armageddon Part II.”
, who told me to keep writing when I wanted to quit.
Dean sits back on his heels, stunned at Castiel’s tone.
Dean caresses Castiel’s shoulder as he lies next to him, tucked into a private room at the run-down motel of the week.  Sam had insisted on getting separate rooms, when he saw the two of them finally kissing, leaned up against the Impala.  Dean thinks he has the best brother in the world sometimes.  Not that he would ever let Sam know how much Dean is enjoying cuddling and categorizing Castiel’s features, as they relax in the afterglow.
Dean walks down the hallway, shoving all of his personal feelings away where he won’t have to think about them. Closing Hell is Priority #1.
Sam stretches his long arms over his head, pointedly ignoring his brother and father. “There has got to be something we’re missing. Some clue we didn’t see.”
That’s when it hits him – it’s almost Christmas.
– echo in his mind. Castiel is here, in his bed and in his arms, after being gone for so long. Dean’s heart clenches at that thought.
“Relax, Dean. It’s going to be just fine.”
Dean fills a glass with a double shot of whiskey, amber liquid clinging to the side of the glass, and swallows it one gulp. The burn of the alcohol makes him cough. He pours himself another, and imagines he can already feel a buzz starting in his fingertips. It’s been a long time since he drank liquor. In fact, he hasn’t really had much to drink since he got back from Purgatory. It had been an alcohol-free zone, so he had been forced to sober up after the drinking binge that had been his life the year before. When he first got back, alcohol didn’t even sound appealing. Sure, he’s had a beer or two, and some of the Men of Letters stash when they moved in, but never drinking to the point of oblivion like before. Dean slams another double shot, and feels the burn sliding down his throat as the alcohol moves through his body. He ought to be good and drunk in no time at this rate. Dean starts to pour himself another shot, but is stopped by a hand on his wrist. So caught up in his own thoughts, that he didn’t even hear his gigantic brother walk into the room – which is a slightly terrifying thought.
Castiel moved his hand to Dean’s other knee to check the reflexes there. His warm fingers flexed on Dean’s inner thigh. Dean had to stop and count to three in his head, in order to not embarrass himself again.
“Everything sounds good,” Dr. Novak said, also checking Dean’s lungs. He moved back around the front of the exam table.
Dean knew this question would come up eventually, but he wasn’t expecting it to happen like this. He had left the warding off for a specific reason.
Dean saved every single text.
“Great, not a lot of help there. So what exactly Missouri say when she called?”
“It’s safe Cas,” Dean interrupts, “No one knows about it except for Sammy and me. No one will find us here.”
Charlie arrives at the bunker and quickly takes over another spare room. Dean wants to ask about her mother, how the funeral went, and offer his sympathies. But, he knows if Charlie is anything like him, she’d rather not talk about it. So he stays quiet on the topic. Charlie can bring it up when she is ready.
Azrael straightens up, laughing. The blade is still embedded in his chest, but there is no light spilling out of it. He grins at John, and it’s as cold and calculating as any of the evil smirks Dean saw from Zachariah or Raphael.
Cas did as Dean requested, and let his eyes roam all over the interior of the drinking establishment.  There were cutouts of green leafy objects hanging on all the windows, and caricatures of an angry red-headed dwarf plastered to the ends of the booths.  Their waitress sauntered by their table, wearing tight fitting green pants that proclaimed “Kiss Me! I’m Irish!” across her buttocks.
[message received 1:15 am]
“Is that why it bothers you?”
“Fifteen sexual partners?” Cas asked.
Dean inherently knows that Castiel can protect himself. Even at half-power he could probably smite a demon, no problem. Still, Dean thinks of the Colt lying under his pillow, how it could kill Crowley in one shot, and he feels a surge of protectiveness pulse through him.
Dean bent over the table, feeling a draft of cool air on his bare behind. He gripped the edge of the table, and tried to take a few deep breaths. He felt Dr. Novak’s hands on his back, steadying him.
“Sure thing, Dean. And you can call me Castiel, if it helps you feel more comfortable.”
Dean could only grin lazily back at him. “Do you even have to ask? That was awesome.”
John must sense the conviction in his son’s voice. For the first time since he arrived, he’s able to look Dean square in the eye. He steps forward, and offers Dean his hand.
But not whispering quietly enough because he caught the end of their conversation.
“What are you trying to say Sam?”
Dean really should have considered his own angel in the equation. While Azrael focuses on Dean, Castiel removes the archangel blade from John and advances on Azrael. Before he can even turn around, Castiel drives the blade into his chest, and the white light of Azrael’s grace spills out of his vessel. He falls to the ground at Castiel’s feet.
“Just try it on, Cas.”
“I’m not good enough for him Sammy. Never was. I was only useful because I could watch out for you. That’s why he kept me around.”
Dean finds his hand aimlessly stroking the locks of Cas’ hair off his forehead as his mind wanders. Once he realizes what he is doing, he can’t seem to stop. This is such a role-reversal from what had happened in Purgatory.
“Bitch.”
Dean grabs his father’s hand, and pulls him in for a hug instead.
“You and Cas are close, you’ve known each other for a decade, maybe you’ve gotten so comfortable around each other people think you could be a couple.”
Dean, Sam, and Cas return to the bunker to find a note from Charlie. She had gone to check on one of her cousins in Nebraska, and said she would call soon.
“Dean, I know you’ve faced down things that are actually terrifying. Monsters that could have ripped you to pieces. You’ve been to Hell and back – literally. You’ve looked the Devil and Death in the eye, and told them where to stick it. I’ve never seen you really scared, until today. And I know the only reason you’re actually scared about this is because it matters. Because Cas matters.”
After returning from Heaven, Castiel had healed Sam as best he could. There was still long-term damage from the trials, that they all knew wouldn’t be cleared until Sam completed the tasks. But, he was slightly improved from when they had gone to Colorado, and that was all Dean could ask for.
“Drop it already, Dean.”
And he waited.
“Get dressed,” Dean says, without further explanation. Cas doesn’t argue, and they both bundle up in boots and scarves, and venture out into the cold Kansas night.
If Dean caught Castiel’s meaning, he didn’t call him on it.  But Castiel thought he saw the hunter hiding a smile behind his next drink of beer.
“It’s one of them, yeah.”
Castiel returns Dean’s stare with the same intensity as always and Dean doesn’t give an inch.
“Yeah, Cas.  It’s just beer.”
He starts with something simple: Breakfast. Because who can say no to pancakes and bacon? Everybody loves bacon. Dean is grateful once again for their well-stocked kitchen, as he mixes the pale batter and fries strips of bacon, filling the room with a delicious aroma. Dean is proud of himself for how good he is at all of this domestic stuff. He likes to brag about it to Sammy whenever he gets the chance. Cooking for Cas feels as natural as taking care of Sam. Cas is part of their family too, and having him in the bunker feels right somehow.
“Well, like I said, this is a safe place. I can put up some warding now that you’re here. At least you’ve got the angel tablet, and no one knows where you are.”
Dean had walked several hundred yards off the road, with Castiel following, angel senses stretching to look for threats. Then Dean had stopped, thrown off his jacket, and laid upon the ground. Castiel scanned the area, wondering what hunting tactic Dean could be employing.
[message received 9:51 pm]
“Dean, this is serious,” John interjects, giving him a stern look.
“Yes, Dean?”
“Good to see you again, dad.”
[picture message received 12:02 am]
Castiel took a moment to appreciate the work he had completed. Castiel had seen Adonis and Achilles, but thought even their perfection paled in comparison to Dean Winchester. Castiel was mesmerized by the dichotomy of Dean. He could appear as a rugged, handsome man one moment and an innocent, frightened little boy the next. As Castiel peered into his soul, he saw all the depth and strength that this man possessed, tempered by the good grace of someone who would never abuse his powers. He knew Dean would feel guilt for what he had done in the Pit, but that it would guide him not to hurt innocent people in the future.
Cas ends up falling asleep in the Impala on the way home. His head bobs up and down, before falling over onto Dean’s shoulder. Dean tries to shrug him off so he can drive, but ends up with a head of dark hair in his lap instead.
Castiel comes out of his trance a few minutes later.  He warily eyes the space that Dean has put between the two of them.
“It’s nice to see couples shopping together,” the associate said, “Let me know if you need anything else.”
“Look, I’m still not a hundred percent convinced that there isn’t something evil at work here. People don’t just come back from the dead for no reason,” Dean says. Unless you’re a Winchester, he finishes in his head. “Plus, he thinks his dad took off when he was a kid. It’s a lot of baggage to unpack. Just easier to deal with one problem at a time.”
Cas tilts his head in that way of his, conveying his confusion at Dean’s meaning. Dean’s heart is beating fast and he doesn’t know if he has the capacity for many more words. Feeling bold, hoping he’s not making a mistake, Dean takes Cas’ hand in his own.

“I know I am cutoff from Heaven, without some of my powers, but I would like to accompany you. In case it turns out to be a dangerous endeavor.”
Besides emoticons, Castiel liked sending Dean pictures of whatever caught his eye during the day.  Each picture message would be signaled by the wailing voice of Celine, and each time he got a picture message Dean swore he would change his ringtone, but he never seemed to get around to changing it.
Despite Dean’s protests, Sam helped in the kitchen with some of food preparation. And he took care of inviting everyone over for dinner, so that the one person instrumental to his plan would not be left out. They had decided to have dinner on Christmas Eve, because Charlie and Garth already had plans on Christmas day.
Thanks for reading!
“Not all of them,” John rasps, as his eyes slide over to Dean’s side. Dean looks to find Castiel standing there.
John runs his hand along the roof of the Impala, studying the paint intently. Dean thinks the conversation is over, but then John clears his throat and looks over to his son.
“I’m going to watch out for you Cas. I won’t let anything hurt you while I’m around,” Dean promises. Impulsively, he presses a kiss to Castiel’s forehead.
Castiel hadn’t been able to heal John Winchester, but he had personally escorted his soul into Heaven. Dean had tried to argue that Cas wasn’t strong enough, but the angel had insisted that he help in what little way he could. It seemed that, at the end, John and Cas had come to some kind of mutual understanding.
“I think it’s time you took a break Cas. Go and lie down for a bit. I’ll check on you in a few.”
Castiel smiles at him, eyes twinkling with good humor.  The light in those eyes, Dean knows is pure Castiel.  Dean had seen the difference when it was Jimmy.  It had felt somehow that there was less energy in the man.  With time, he should get used to the idea of separating Jimmy from Cas.
Sam went to bed, happy that now his work was done. And he didn’t even gloat or grumble when he caught Dean and Castiel kissing under the mistletoe the next morning.
Dean looked down at his and Sam’s initials carved into the table. He ran his thumb over the lines on the table. Looked like there was room for a couple more names on that oak. He pulled out his pocket knife and started carving while he kept thinking.
[message received 5:40 pm]
“You know that’s not the only option, right?”
Sam must have sensed his seriousness, and the fact that Dean never brought up these kinds of topics unprompted. He dropped his bag on the map table and gestured for Dean to follow him into the library where they could sit across from each other at one of the long tables.
“What’s up?”
Dean is taken aback for a few moments, before the hilarity of the situation hits him. If she wants to think Dean and Cas are a couple, that’s fine by him. What better way to keep her off their back?
Well, this year is different. They have the bunker now, and things are as stable as they are going to get for a Winchester. This year Dean decides they are going to have a real Christmas. It can help take everyone’s mind off of what is going on.
“I want to build a home with you. I want to be the last person you kiss, because you saved me when no one else could have. I want you to officially be my family, because you’ve been as close as any family member for years already. I want to be your husband, because it’s something I thought I would never have, and you showed me that it was actually possible. I want to marry you today, Cas, because I love you.”
“I wanted to let you know, umm.  Well, there is something I need to say…” Cas trailed off.
Every freckle is a kiss from an angel.
Dean knew that would be his father’s answer, but it still hurts. Tears sting the corners of his eyes. His father has been a pain in the ass the past few days, but that doesn’t mean he is ready to lose him again so soon. He looks at his father lying in the dirt, breathing in his last breaths, almost gone from him again. He decides he can be the man his father raised him to be one last time. Dean swallows down his emotions, like a physical lump in his throat.
Dr. Novak chuckled softly. “At least you’re being safe Dean. That’s a good thing.” The doctor looked over to Dean to gauge his reaction, and that’s when Dean realized he was looking into the bluest eyes he’d ever seen. If he’d been more prone to poetry, he could have written lines about the color and the intensity in the other man’s eyes.
Sam also realized he did not need a love spell. He does not have to create those feelings because they are already there. All he needs is to remove their inhibitions. Sam thinks about locking them both in the dungeon, and putting a spell on the lock that even Dean cannot break. Then he thinks how that could just make Dean angry, or have the two idiots just stare at each other and getting nothing accomplished. Sam knows he cannot do anything like a sex spell, because there is no such thing as brain bleach and Sam still has to be able to live with these two when all of this is over.
“Does anyone here just date humans anymore?” John wonders aloud.
Without knowing how it happened, Dean finds himself holding Cas’ hand. Even through the layers of thick wool, it feels intimate. Dean squeezes Cas’ hand, and feels the other man tremble slightly before he squeezes back.
[message sent 5:34 pm]
The man answers Castiel, as if Dean hadn’t spoken at all. “Of course it was me brother. What other angel would have the power to pull souls from Heaven?”
Dean wasn’t sure what label suited him best, but he knew that there was something about being around Cas that made him happy. Something that made him want to grab Cas by the arm or shoulder as often as possible or squeeze next to him on the sofa for movie nights. Something about Cas made Dean want to treat him differently than if he was family and more than a friend.
“What the hell Cas?”
“I don’t have the tablet anymore, Dean. Crowley took it from me,” Cas says quietly.
“Your penis looks great, Dean,” Castiel said. It was a totally professional comment. Dean must have just imagined the part where Castiel lingered on his name, as he rolled his balls in his hand.
Sam did not miss the way Dean’s eyes softened as soon as he heard Cas’ name. Sam wondered if he even realized how much he wore his heart on his sleeve.
Dean was feeling fairly buzzed and happy at the end of the first movie and halfway through the bottle, when he got a picture message from Cas.
Dean slowly came back to reality, noting the quiet of his bedroom, with the addition of just a few new items. One of them being the white lab coat they had purchased from an online costume store. It had been Dean’s fantasy for this role-playing game, and he found that Cas was surprisingly eager to participate.
“Geez. Okay, I get it. Third wheel makes things awkward. I’ll just check into a motel –“
Castiel gave him a curious smile, and Dean continued reading from his paper.
Sam loved teaching others, but he believed in the power of letting them find their own conclusions. He looked at Dean, giving him a helpful
With the Impala gone, Dean has to swallow his pride and ask to borrow Charlie’s car. She teases him about speeding and bringing it back with a full tank, but hands him the keys. She offers to stay at the bunker with Kevin, in case John returns.
Dean took a few deep breaths and focused on relaxing his muscles.
“Shh, Cas, it’s alright. Just trying to make us a little more comfortable,” Dean replies. “I’m going to let you in on a little secret of humanity, Cas. It’s generally easier to sleep when you’re not wearing a suit and a trench coat.”
She smiles, and it’s almost predatory. Dean has seen women like her before. If she gets her claws into Cas, Dean won’t see him again for the rest of the night. Dean wanted to get him laid, sure, but he thinks they can do better for Cas’ first time.
“Goodnight, Dean,” is the softly murmured reply in the dark.
“Does that happen a lot around here?” John asks his youngest son.
“You know, Saint Patrick,” Dean said, a little bit slower, “He’s the Patron saint of Ireland, and therefore drinking.  He drove the snakes out of Ireland, and saved all the people, so every year we celebrate him by getting drunk!”  Dean punctuated his explanation with a salute of his glass, before he downed half of his green beer in one long drag.
“Since when?”
Thanks everyone!
This last was said with a sideways look in Dean’s direction.
“I don’t know,” Dean responds in a quiet whisper. Those three easier words fly out of his mouth – so much easier than the other three words he can’t bring himself to say.
The last time he had tried to have a Christmas celebration, Dean thought it was going to be his last one ever. Dean and Sam hadn’t had a home then, so they hadn’t been able to do it right. There had been gifts wrapped in newspaper, and eggnog with lots of spice, huddled together in front of that small motel tv. But it wasn’t like the Christmas Dean had imagined it would be. Not like the ones they had never had as kids, that he knew they deserved.
Dean could practically hear Cas’ smile on the end of the line.
When you have a younger brother, sometimes they do annoying things simply because they can.  That means sometimes they forget to bring you pie, and then claim they know nothing about why you are upset.  Or, they might superglue your fingers to a beer bottle.  And it could just be that your sibling thinks it is hilarious to steal your phone when you’re not looking, to change your text alert noises.  In this case, it was the latter.  And Sammy was sneakier than most.  He didn’t just change Dean’s text alert ringtone, because then Dean would have noticed right away.  No, Sam only changed the notification for when someone sent Dean a picture message, which would take longer to happen but meant that the payoff would be greater.  Sam set the phone to loudly blast “Because You Loved Me” when someone sent Dean a picture.
“What did Crowley do to you man? You should be healing by now.”
“Not everyone speaks fluent Sam and Dean,” their father reminds them.
“No, shut up so I can say yes.”
Sam cleaned up in the kitchen, trying to rack his brain for another plan. Maybe for New Year’s he could get Castiel to come back. Then he could get Dean drunk and leave them alone together. Sam still was not above locking them in the dungeon. That was still a Plan B.
“Sometimes we need to blend into places and walking around with a guy in a giant trench coat is kind of a give away.”
Dr. Novak looked at Dean and his eyes darkened marginally. It might have been a trick of the light, but Dean didn’t think so, not when the doctor’s next comment was “Lucky them,” muttered under his breath. Dean pretended he hadn’t heard, but felt his heart rate increase again at the thought.
“It would be wise of us to leave Dean,” he growls, and Dean can’t argue with that.
Sam is already passed out on top of his bed, fully clothed and mouth hanging open, dead to the world. Poor kid has been so beat up since his trip to Hell to free Bobby’s soul, which Dean had expected, of course. It’s not like it was a trip to the store for a gallon of milk. God, when did their lives get this complicated?
“No offense taken,” the young doctor smiled again, “Dr. Smith had to attend to an emergency across town, so I’m filling in for him.”
“Of course I do Dean,” Cas said, giving him a smile.
Castiel stares at Dean, fighting for breath and words. Dean can feel a chick flick moment coming on, and he heads it off at the pass. Now is so not the time.
“Seriously?  Are you kidding me right now?” Dean asked.  He turned to Sam.  “Is he kidding me right now?”
Dean leans over to kiss him and is delighted that Cas is already meeting him halfway. Cas’ lips are a little dry and they have to stretch a little too far to do much more than press their mouths together, but Dean is already addicted to the feeling.
They walk over to the site where Lucifer’s cage was opened, and the ground looks intact. Dean had been expecting to find an altar built on the site, or some sigils burned into the grass. Dean looks over to see Sam anxiously rubbing the faded scar on his palm. Poor guy is probably remembering the last time he was in this cemetery, and Dean feels a twinge in his own chest at the memory.
“That constellation over there, the one that looks like a stretched out ‘W’, is Cassiopeia,” Dean explained.
“No!” all three Winchester men shout in unison.
“Dean, remember when we first found out about the trials? You wanted to be the one to kill the Hellhound, and complete the trials, because you thought it was a suicide mission. You wanted to throw yourself on the grenade for me – again – because you didn’t see another way out.”
The doors to the chambers opened, and Castiel walked in without fanfare. He was dressed in the nicest suit Sam had ever seen on him. One that was actually cut for his body, and not a size too large as Jimmy’s Sunday best had been. Sam thought if he squinted just right, he could imagine a pale tan trenchcoat fluttering behind Castiel.
“I’m still thirsty though.”
After a quick breakfast, everyone moves to the library to check on the progress Sam made. He boots up his laptop.
Dean nodded and got to his feet, knowing he would make it a quick shower.  The adrenaline helped clear up the worst of the hangover.  This is why they always kept their weapons in the Impala ready to go.  Always be prepared - the hunter motto.  Or maybe that was the Boy Scouts?  But still, good advice.
“Right,” Sam continues, “So instead of focusing on the symbol I did a search for that phrase that dad said; ‘It is I who am the gunner of God. When I roar, the Earth trembles’, and I got a match. It brought up this site about Voodoo spirits called Loa.”
Speaking of his boyfriend, Cas emerged from their attached bathroom carrying a cool cloth. He used it to clean Dean’s stomach, where he lay contentedly stretched across their bed.
“And what if Jimmy wasn’t okay with it?” Dean asks.
“It’s so much work Sammy. You know I’m not big on Christmas.”
Dean quickly swiped open his phone.  It was a picture of a piece of pie, sitting on a diner counter.  Cas had apparently learned how to use filters, because it looked grainy, like an old-time photo.  Cas had captioned it,
“There’s so many things I didn’t get to tell him – we didn’t get to tell him,” Sam says, interrupting his thoughts, “He still never found out about Henry. Or how we got this bunker.”
Castiel’s response is to give him a puzzled look.
Dean huffed out another laugh and looked at his brother. Sam was smiling but not in a mean or teasing way.
“I’ll start driving now.”
He handed the pen and paper to Dean, and clapped his older brother on the shoulder.
Castiel returned Dean’s gaze.  He was looking into Dean’s eyes, the most unique and interesting shade of green he could remember ever seeing.  Castiel thought Dean’s eyes were his best feature.  They portrayed everything about the man – his youthful quality, and his strong moral principles – all at once.  Castiel thought his Father had chosen Dean’s eyes perfectly.  They changed color, depending on his mood, but they were always some shade of green.  Castiel realized he liked looking into Dean’s eyes whenever he was afforded the opportunity.
“Well, I don’t think you’re his type,” Dean responds flatly.
“I had no idea y’all were queer!” she huffs, before turning on her heel and walking away.
He waited.
“Look sugar, I just wanna dance with your friend here, and then I’ll give him right back.”
“You know you’re important to me, right Cas?”
Sam also took care of all of the decorations. He didn’t even have to overdo it. He was able to cut down his own modest tree (it didn’t even bother him to break that small law, after breaking so many bigger ones) and buy a few simple decorations including the most important one of all. Sam had used a spell to enchant several sprigs of mistletoe and hung them over various entryways. He had tried to hide some of them with garlands or lights so Dean would not notice. All Sam needed was for Dean and Cas to stand in the same doorway at some point, and the spell would encourage them to act on their subconscious desires.
Dean swallows hard, as it hits him.  This body is not Castiel’s.  It’s Jimmy’s.  A devout man who willingly gave his body to the cause of the Angels, but not to be used like this.  Jimmy had been married for Christ’s sake.
“Just trust me Cas.”
“You know, Mary Winchester always believed angels were watching over you Dean. She wasn’t wrong. Even before I pulled you out of Hell.”
That earns him another bitchface from his brother. Dean returns the look without comment. After a moment, Sam’s face seems to relax, but Dean can tell he’s just getting ready to unleash a torrent of emotions on his brother.
He avoided it.
There is something comforting in knowing that Cas is it for him. They have both hurt each other over the years, of course, but still ended up here - together. And he knows they are both going to try to make each other as happy as they can for the rest of time. Whether they try to legally get married or have some sort of private commitment ceremony one day, they’re going to be together forever. Dean is sure not even death will part them.
Dean sat for a moment, looking at the angel without even blinking.  Cas reviewed his earlier statements, but couldn’t find anything in his inquiries that would give Dean pause.  He had no idea why the hunter had dragged him to this particular drinking establishment and attempted to serve him alcohol in the first place.  He knew the angel couldn’t get drunk.
Dean watched the soft lights dance across Castiel’s face, and felt his chest tighten. Maybe, like the Grinch, his heart was growing. Dean remembered the past few days spent with Cas, and wanted nothing more than to reach out and hold his hand. He swallowed past the dryness in his throat, and made up his mind to act. Dean moved to sit close by Cas. He stretched his arm over the back of the couch and waited, without saying a word, for Cas to respond. Several heartbeats later, Dean felt the warm press of Cas’ body against his own. Dean closed his arm around him in a firm embrace, and intertwined their hands together.
Dean had never heard him nervous before.  His stomach did a little somersault at the thought.  He couldn’t let Cas flounder like this.  He suddenly wanted to see him in person.  He needed to look Cas in the eyes, and explain to him why Dean had been so weird lately.
“Cas, you know I’m not good with words or feelings, so it took me awhile to figure out what I wanted to say to you. I know vows are supposed to be your promise to the other person, of everything you are going to do for them, but because I’m a selfish bastard, I just made a list of everything I want in this marriage,” Dean stated.
“What the hell happened to you?”
Dean gets into the Impala and drives. No real destination in mind. With the smooth leather seats holding him up, and Zeppelin blaring through the speakers, Dean can almost pretend that what Sam said didn’t affect him.
“Dean?” Cas asks quietly, but his voice comes out rough like sandpaper.
When Dean’s phone went off at midnight with the now familiar Celine Dion ringtone, Dean had never been so happy to hear that stupid song.
“Look around Cas.  Does anything seem unusual to you?”
Dean never thought he would have a boyfriend - certainly not his first one in his forties nor one who is an angel. But being with Cas makes him happy, and if he’s learned anything over the years it’s to accept every moment of happiness that life gives you.
“Now I’m just going to check your pulse.”
Cas looks deep into Dean’s eyes at that. All the years they have known each other, and they have never discussed Mary. In fact, the only time John has come up is when they were talking about a hunt. Ironically, Dean thinks, it is because of John that Dean even met Castiel, if you wanted to look at it that way. Dean had been saved because of a deal John had made with a demon. So when Sam needed to be saved, Dean had done the same thing as his father, making a crossroads deal and landing himself in the Pit and in a position to be saved by the angel.
“Just part of the exam questions. How many sexual partners have you had in the past year?”
[message sent 9:26 pm]
“What? No you’re not.”
Dean was giving him a skeptical eyebrow, but Sam continued talking.
Sam stopped, giving Dean a moment to process. It was quiet enough in the Bunker to hear a pin drop.
“That’s what family is for,” he tells John.
“Tastes good anyway,” Dean said with a grin handing Cas his candy and one of the tickets.
Being human is harder on Cas this time around. He may have been thousands of years old before he fell, but that doesn’t mean he has any real experience dealing with human emotions. Or human needs. Dean has to tell him to take a shower, after noticing he smells like feet. He is able to peel the old, worn suit off of him without much hassle. Dean tries not to stare at Cas, but after five years of nothing but suits and that long trench coat, he is a bit curious as to what Cas has been covering up.
Dean doesn’t know how to tell Charlie she just hit the nail on the head. “I figured if I answered all cheery, you’d assume I’d been replaced by body snatchers.”
“Angels do not need to eat,” Cas explains dryly.
“What the hell happened to you man?”
Castiel’s favorite freckle was in a place that not many knew about. Even those who had sometimes shared Dean’s bed didn’t notice this particular freckle, but Castiel knew of it. It sat at the junction where Dean’s leg met his groin. It’s almost too large to be called a freckle, but it’s not a mole or a birthmark. The larger size is due to the fact that Castiel lingered here a bit too long with this kiss. Angels weren’t supposed to feel emotions, other than love and obedience for God. But, in that moment, with his lips pressed to Dean’s warm, firm skin, Castiel felt a flicker of desire thrum through his being. He felt possessive of Dean, and for a moment took pride in the thought that he was marking Dean himself.
, Cas liked
“But make sure they -”
“All these years watching Earth, and I bet you’ve never made even a snowball, huh Cas?”
“But we need more bookshelves in the library. And one in the kitchen for all the cookbooks
Castiel stroked Dean’s arms, feeling all the compact power in his muscles. He then moved over his thighs and calves, impressed by how sturdy and strong they were. He caressed Dean’s face with the lightest of touches, and then began to administer kisses to his cheeks and nose to account for every freckle Dean Winchester ever had, leaving a small dot of pigment in the wake of each press of lips.
“Do you have any allergies?”
Cas came out of the changing room, wearing a Winchester tuxedo consisting of a flannel shirt, plain t-shirt, and jeans. It was a pretty basic outfit but it had been years since Dean had seen Cas in anything but his oversized suit and trench coat so he couldn’t help but stare a little. There was something in particular about the jeans that Dean was having trouble tearing his eyes away from - maybe because they were so ordinarily human or because Dean could see how defined Cas’ thighs looked in them which made him wonder how much muscle he had been packing under loose fitting clothes all these years.
“Mary Winchester has been looking out for Sam all his life,” Castiel replied, “She has been watching over both her sons.”
“That’s my name, don’t wear it out,” Dean quipped. Real smooth, Winchester, he thought to himself as he flinched internally.
The woman laughs at Dean, and turns to share the joke with Cas, but he isn’t laughing. He is looking at the woman in almost a sympathetic way, imploring her to agree with Dean. She looks from Cas to Dean, and back again.
He typed:
Dean is so caught up in his thoughts, he doesn’t even hear the angel quietly following him to his room. Only when he turns to shut the door, does he see the familiar figure in a trench coat standing in his doorway. It doesn’t even register to him that he’s not startled by Cas’ presence, until it strikes him as normal that Cas is standing in his bedroom, staring at him again.
“Hey Cas.”
“Okay, Dean. First, I’d like to start with just a few basic questions.”
“You’re joking, right?” Charlie responds.
None of them sees the man in a long dark coat watching them leave.
“Looks like it’s just you and me then, huh Cas?” Dean asks with a wink, as he clinks their beer bottles together.
“He’s right, Dean,” says John, “He tested me with salt, holy water, silver, and Borax for some reason.”
They all turn to find a tall man in a long, dark coat giving them an unpleasant smile. Dean doesn’t recognize him, but he looks like could be a bouncer or body guard. The man is broad-shouldered and has one of those short, cropped haircuts. His features look like they have been carved out of stone, so that the smile he is wearing looks hard and distorted.
Look how far they both had come.
“So, a strong heart, that’s good. What about cancer or stroke?”
“Of course I do Dean.”
With their brand of
“A likely possibility,” Charlie agrees.
Dean was actually wringing his hands. Sam had never seen that in his entire life. He wondered if he could sneak some whiskey in for his brother, or if that might just make his nerves worse. Sam spotted a notepad and pen on the desk in the corner. As he walked over to retrieve it, he tried to give what he imagined was an amazing pep talk.
Surprisingly, John doesn’t yell back. He lets out a low sigh and holds up his hands. “Okay, Dean. No more fighting. I get it.”
When she leaned into Cas’ side, pressing her cleavage against his arm, Dean saw red for a second. He quickly grabbed Cas by his free hand and pulled him over to the doorway of the living room they were in.
Dean nods, unable to say more. Thinking about John again so soon is more than a little painful and raw. Dean latches onto a new topic, desperate to focus on the good news.
“Jimmy is not aware of what is going on,” Cas growls, surprising him with his voice.
Castiel took this as verbal consent, and continued stroking Dean’s prostate. He alternated with long, slow strokes, and then rubbed in small, fast circles. Each movement felt like different parts of Dean’s nervous system were on fire. Sometimes his toes tingled, other times it felt like his balls were clenching and his heart ready to burst out of his chest. He knew he was heaving in large breaths, and probably muttering some embarrassing stuff. But, at the moment, he didn’t care. The feeling was unlike anything else he’d ever experienced.
“He never met our mother, you know. Sammy… he was too young when she died to even remember her…” Dean trailed off into the darkness, so quietly, as though his voice would break if it were any louder.
expression.
“Oh, it’s on!” Dean shouts, launching himself at Cas. He tackles the slimmer man to the ground, rolling them both through the snow. They wrestle around like children, smiling and laughing the whole time, until finally they lay side by side, panting in the cold air.
Dean grits his teeth as he feels a jolt of panic race through his system. His hand clinches into a fist, itching to grab the Impala keys and chase after him. Before that plan can be put into action, Castiel returns to the spot where he left, but he sways on his feet and threatens to collapse. Dean is by Castiel’s side in an instant, his hands gripping the angel to keep him upright.
Sam raises an eyebrow and looks at Dean like he has two heads. “I have a better idea, Dean. Why don’t you go talk to him? He’s your boyfriend after all.”
They got back to Lebanon about two hours later. Jack asked Cas to look at a lore book he had in his room. Dean watched them walk down the hallway and put a hand out on Sam’s shoulder to stop him.
“I mean,” Dean continues, swallowing around a lump in his throat, “that if you’re sick, or injured, you should stay here. So I can keep an eye on you – like you did for me in Purgatory.”
This is, by far, the longest fic I have ever written in my life. I know it's lacking in prose (and probably a few other things) but I'm glad I saw it through to the end. I hope I can get better with time. And maybe, if I'm lucky, I will have shed some light on a few spots in canon that were left in the dark.
THE BEGINNING
Lebanon was a small midwestern town that was barely a blip on most maps. For entertainment purposes Dean had found a small movie theatre in Hastings, about an hour away, and loved to go when they weren’t busy working a case. Especially because this small theatre had runs of classic movies on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Dean had taken Sam, Cas, and Jack to see
They turned to leave and Dean stared after them, a little bit in shock. This was becoming all too regular of an occurrence with Cas. He should probably start correcting people, or mention it to Cas or someone.
“I’ll take two tickets for
“Dean, I can’t,” Cas says.
“Now, you want to just keep patting it, until it forms a ball, okay?” Dean instructs, like talking to a small child.
Castiel returned the gaze, hoping at once that Dean could not read all of the emotions in his face, and at the same time hoping that he did.
“I seem to have acquired a taste for it,” he explains to the group.
Cas looks confused for about one second, before the tension melts from his face and shoulders. He gives Dean the first smile since coming to the bunker, and one of the few Dean has seen on his face, ever.
He gave Dean a flick of an eyebrow. Just as Dean was going to ask if the doctor was actually coming onto him, the fingers inside of him found his prostate. Or, at least that’s what Dean imagined they found. Either that, or Castiel had found a magic button, that made Dean feel like he’d just taken a drop down a roller-coaster, that sent a tingling sensation through his balls.
Dean sat with his phone is his hand for several minutes with no reply.  He took another big glup of scotch and waited.  He didn’t even feel the alcohol catching up to him.  He thought he should lay his head down and wait for the next text message.  A minute later he was passed out against the arm of the couch.  He didn’t even hear his phone vibrate.
As Dean lifted the edge of the gown, Dr. Novak rolled closer to the exam table. He snapped on a pair of latex gloves before taking Dean’s penis in hand. He moved it gently back and forth, examining the surface for any odd marks. Dean stared at the ceiling and tried to think of dead puppies. He quickly lost concentration when he felt a hand cradling his balls. Dean swallowed and looked down to find the doctor staring right at him.
[message received 9:27 pm]
Cas seems too tired to argue with both Charlie and Dean, and takes some of the offered snack. They discover that Cas actually enjoys the salty food, as he eats nearly an entire bowl by himself.
