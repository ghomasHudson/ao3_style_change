. John feels the weight of that word even without speaking it aloud. Yes, he loves Sherlock. He loves him fiercely and always has. Just because he’s never acknowledged it aloud doesn’t mean he hasn’t known it. It’s been there somewhere in the back of his mind right from the first time they met. He can try to deny it, has tried to deny it, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s there and it’s there to stay. It’s as simple as that.
Had John been feeling more himself, he would have registered this as something just a bit not good. Had John been feeling more himself, he would have had to explain it all away, to find some sort of explanation and make his excuses. Then he would have spent the next couple of days feeling conflicted about it anyway. But John isn’t feeling like himself right now. He isn’t fully conscious. The rational side of his mind is just as drugged as the rest of him and too sluggish to insist that he shouldn’t feel the way he feels, that friends don’t consider each other beautiful and that boyfriends should focus on their girlfriends instead of their friends when asked to choose. Now this feeling he’s having simply registers as the only natural response in the face of the current situation before slipping between his fingers and into oblivion. He won’t remember it later.
, that I can’t count on you to… do my laundry for a month… even if you’ve promised to do so in my Mind Palace!”
he’s missed this and he can’t help but smile at Sherlock in a way that even John himself recognises as being a bit not good. It must certainly be very noticeable at least, since it causes Sherlock to momentarily cease his explanations in favour of raising an eyebrow quizzically.
Because Mary was the safe bet. There have been moments in which John has found himself suspecting that Sherlock might not be as entirely removed from emotional attachment as he always says. But there have also been moments, moments upon moments, in which John has found even some of his worst suspicions about Sherlock’s lack of human emotion confirmed with glaring clarity.
During his time away from London, though, Sherlock has been forced to pass an awful lot of time waiting and hiding. He’s spent that time exploring deeper into his mind palace and it looks as though his mind palace has changed as a result. It’s not just a map of references anymore. Sherlock
Moriarty smirks and stretches comfortably, splaying his limbs out over the bench they’re both occupying in Regent Park.
Sherlock hesitates a moment, but no more than a moment. “I wouldn’t be unsupervised. Doctor Watson is here, isn’t he?” Another heartbeat and then Sherlock turns his gaze on John, clearly judging his anger. “Isn’t he?” he repeats, his voice softening back into a slur. John meets his gaze. Right now, Sherlock is very far from being the clever detective in the funny hat. He's slow. Every move, every word... is slow. There's something very distant in his gaze, as though he isn't really consciously here, and yet when John really takes the time to look at him, he just looks utterly lost. Sorrowful. Somehow, through the anger, John sees him and all he wants to say is
John’s voice dies out. With the way she’s looking at him, he knows she’s judging every word. What is she listening for? What exactly would he be confessing to if he spoke his mind now? Mary has been nothing but supportive these last few days. Sherlock waking up has apparently been a signal to her that John is now no longer off limits for her questions. John’s mind is reeling from the abrupt turn their conversation has taken, trying to figure out what it’s really about before he reveals more to her than he’d like.
Sherlock pulls away only enough to meet his gaze and grins with a depth and sincerity John hasn’t seen in him in a long time. It’s practically a smirk, yet it’s too honest to carry any sarcasm. John feels himself respond in kind, but the ecstatic power of the moment, without any thought for the consequences, has left him along with Sherlock’s lips. The too familiar gnawing guilt and concern once again wrap themselves around his insides, fighting for room with the exaltation their kiss has produced.
He’s a bit more quiet for starters. Sherlock has always been a loudmouth, saying whatever he wants to at whatever time he wants to, to John’s chagrin without much concern for diplomacy or even common decency. He’s still like that most of the time, but there’s a silence about him now that John can’t remember ever having seen before. Most of the time, he’s just as domineering and grand as John remembers. But then there’s other times when he speaks in a quiet, almost subdued manner, or doesn’t speak at all for long periods of time. He’s gone home early from cases a couple of times, complaining of a headache. Missing out on a case because of something that, to Sherlock’s mind, must be categorised as nothing more than a minor inconvenience is something he’s never done before. It’s gotten to a point now that John seriously feels the need to bring it up or even suggest that he go see a doctor about it, but Sherlock just shrugs off any questions and puts it down to a lack of food or drink, which is admittedly plausible.
, watching them, and a part of John no longer feels he can justify kissing Mary right in front of Sherlock. But Mary makes short process of his mental gymnastics. She just leans in and kisses him, naturally and thoughtlessly and without any hindrance. Then she pulls away, no more than a heartbeat later. As though nothing has changed. Because, to her mind, nothing has. She doesn’t know. How John feels in that moment… what it’s like to kiss his wife, his Mary, whom he’s kissed a thousand times or more, knowing that he has cheated on her, knowing that he’s broken his vows, knowing that he doesn’t know if he has really chosen her or if their entire relationship was one big mistake… it’s beyond words. And it’s easier to redirect his emotional turmoil onto Sherlock.
To be perfectly honest, John is enjoying their reading sessions just as much as Sherlock is, if not more. There’s something utterly tranquil and domestic about it. John could have sworn he would find it tedious and God knows he’s never imagined Sherlock to be the kind of person who could stand having someone else read aloud for them as a child, much less as an adult. Yet it’s somehow just about perfect, in that weird, slightly dysfunctional way that stems from doing childish things just for the heck of it and finding that you like it way better now than you did when you were a child.
The deductions they make don’t contribute to a particular case. They don’t build towards some overall conclusion. And yet it strangely feels as though they do. It’s as if each deduction is perfectly lined up to all the ones that came before it, each supplying a new piece of a puzzle, each contributing to make the picture more complete. But Sherlock finds it difficult to tell exactly what that picture might be showing, and he doesn’t discuss it with Jim. They don’t discuss any of the things that really matter. Not since the day when Moriarty first turned up at Baker Street, the day he talked about solving the final problem. Since then, they haven’t discussed anything of importance. Only how the man at Tesco is cheating on his wife, how the woman on Shaftesbury Avenue owns two dogs and has a hospitalised mother, how the tourist at St. Paul’s is hoping the man next to him might be interested in getting a drink after the tour but is quite clearly setting himself up for disappointment.
To no one’s great surprise, Sherlock’s complacent attitude melts away the moment the cab pulls up outside 221B and he realises who’s there. He isn’t even out of the cab yet before the complaining begins. Mycroft, too, is predictably less than helpful. Sitting on the stairs with his hands neatly folded on top of his umbrella as though they’re nothing more than a pair of errant schoolboys summoned to the headmaster’s office.
On the second day, Mrs. Hudson comes up with a cup of tea, luckily in between Moriarty’s visits. Sherlock is so relieved to see her that he almost tells her so, but thinks better of it at the last moment and settles for simply ignoring her good-humouredly as she chides him about the state of the flat and complains that she hasn’t seen him for several days. She disappears into the kitchen. Sherlock hears the sound of the fridge opening and her exasperated sigh. If it’s due to a lack of food or an abundance of food way past best before, Sherlock can’t tell. He might have discovered it if he hadn’t tuned out of Mrs. Hudson’s rantings about three seconds in. But he does offer a reassuring smile when she heads for the door and promises to stop by next time he’s heading out.
And yet there’s a part of him that’s wanted this for longer than he’d care to admit. A part of him that’s wanted more than just their natural intimacy and easy friendship. A part of him that’s wanted to know Sherlock, to truly know him, to hear his secrets and finally understand. A part of him that’s delighted in every little glimpse of Sherlock’s inner world and yet always wanted more. This is it. A crack in Sherlock’s infallible armour. And that hidden part of John is responding in ways he’d rather not think too hard about.
At long last, John speaks. “Why did you do it? If you thought it was real… or if you couldn’t tell what was real and what wasn’t… why did you do it? If even a part of you believed he was actually alive and had returned to London… why didn’t you call the police? Why did you allow him to stay at your flat, why did you speak with him, why did you…?”
John repeats the doctor's words back to her with no small amount of incredulity. He knows it's unfair, really, he does. But he’s overtired, emotionally wrecked and
When the Sun goes down and the streetlamps are turned on, they get up and walk to remain warm, strolling all the way down the south bank, crossing over Millennium Bridge and continuing up toward Mansion House. Moriarty suggests they break into the Bank of England, Sherlock hums in the affirmative and turns that hum straight into the opening of Bach’s Partita No. 1 and they both dissolve into giggles like naughty schoolboys and
It’s not just because it’s shocking, the way Sherlock has transitioned from wakefulness to deep unconsciousness seemingly with no build-up, no warning and no willpower of his own. It’s worse than that. Because this is Sherlock. And to see Sherlock,
What exactly he is ready for is a bit more difficult to determine, but Sherlock can make an educated guess. Something he said or did with Mycroft must have shown Jim that he’s on the right path. And so now they are on their way. No matter what Mycroft may say, no matter what he may imply, no matter what he may
When they’re on the couch together, watching crap telly and eating directly from take-out boxes. And Sherlock is lying down, box balanced precariously on his stomach. It looks absolutely preposterous and doesn’t he know it. When their eyes meet and they both laugh, laugh so hard that the box, already dangerously situated as it is, shakes in time with Sherlock’s chest and John takes in his usually heavily guarded face and watches it dissolve into helpless giggles and thinks that this is how it ought to be, how
Two hours, one unauthorised drugs bust, one sprain, one very tense car ride and one urine sample later, John finds himself glaring down a not-nearly-sorry-enough consulting detective just tested positive for cocaine. He can’t tell if it’s his anger, his disappointment or his worry that’s foremost in his mind and, frankly, he isn’t sure he can bring himself to care right now. Sherlock has been relapsing in secret without as much as a phone call to any of the people who care about him. Himself, Molly, Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, even Mycroft. All of whom would gladly have thrown whatever else they were doing to the wind at a moment’s notice in order to help him.
Jim shakes his head. He’s so close that Sherlock can feel his breath like a soft caress on his cheek. Their noses touch the next instant.
not to shout. Leave it to Mycroft, let him run through his dictatorial shit and then John can say what he really needs to say afterwards.
No response. He might have expected as much. Sherlock never explains while he’s thinking. He prefers to lay it all out at once with a great flourish and he needs to have thought everything through before that’s possible.
He’s almost tempted to throw a nasty comment about the time he spent sleeping right up and down on a hospital chair right back in Sherlock’s face, but thinks better of it at the last second and shuts his mouth, simply motioning for Sherlock to continue in his own time.
But the noise might equally be a warning of something far worse. Because the noise is not coming from his body. The noise is coming from his head.
Holding Sherlock like this, feeling Sherlock’s arms around him, feeling his lips against his own… it’s like feeling the sun on both sides.
Who comes a-knocking at six in the morning on a Saturday? Maybe it’s the dream still clinging on to him, but John can only really think of one person, and he clears the bed in record time, throwing on a housecoat on the way to the door and practically tearing the damn thing off its hinges in his haste.
It’s as though Jim already knows. But then, perhaps that is to be expected. Perhaps Jim is the one person who understands. Because they’re the same. They’ve always been the same.
But Sherlock doesn’t do it. He just keeps looking, mile after mile after mile into those eyes, as always finding enigma upon enigma and yet not a single answer to any of them. It’s always filled him with a strange ambiguity, completely terrifying yet utterly attractive at the same time. Like a bomb seconds from exploding. He ought to run from it, but it draws him in instead, intriguing and fascinating and unknown and yet somehow, through it all, strangely familiar, familiar in a way that no other person has ever seemed to him. He knows nothing about this man, not really, and yet he knows him, knows the way he thinks and feels and acts in a way that he knows no one else on the planet. He looks in this man’s eyes and feels that intimacy and familiarity between them, and yet he also looks in those eyes and sees nothing but riddles. The most perilously stimulating case he’s ever worked on, the most dangerously desirable drug he’s ever tried. The deadly enigma that Sherlock just cannot leave be.
“But, Sherlock, that’s… you can’t do that!" John bursts out. "Your brain, it… just because you set everything up to look like real life doesn’t mean you can actually perform legitimate tests that way. How a blood splatter looks, it’s just going to be your brain projecting your ideas about the case onto an imaginary wall. It’s not real!"
. John's almost at a stage now where he can avoid feeling annoyed by it and simply accept it for what it is.
It would be maddening if John wasn’t almost too emotionally drained to feel maddened by it. To be maddened by something feels like too much of a complicated emotion to figure out right now. Which brings him back to his anger and his frustration and all his other horrendous coping mechanisms that make him see himself as a horrible person. And on and on the circle goes. But it’s a downward spiral.
Sherlock hesitates. He doesn’t know what to say. It’s his fault, it’s all his fault. But it’d be worse if he hadn’t intervened. Wouldn’t it?
“We’re playing the game,” he elaborates. Moriarty leans closer to him. He looks more than tolerably pleased. Whether it’s with himself or with Sherlock is difficult to tell. But he remains silent.
Mary is a nurse. That’s how they met. Office romance. If you can call it that when you’re both nearing forty and one of you is only fully functioning around fifty percent of the time. Still. Mary is sweet, funny and a good listener. She has a soothing voice and a gentle touch and there’s understanding rather than pity in her eyes when he accidentally wakes her up in the middle of the night during one of his nightmares despite his desperate efforts to keep quiet. Most importantly, though, she’s a safe bet. There’s nothing too extreme or extraordinary about her, she’s just nice to be around and John likes to think that they care for one another in much the same way: not too passionately, not too recklessly, not too dangerously. Their relationship isn’t overly exciting, but that fits the both of them well. What Mary can provide – stability, reassurance, comfort, companionship – is what John needs right now.
Well then. His phone obviously isn’t working, which is more than a bit annoying considering the cost he’s invested in it.
There’s a peculiar undertone, Sherlock realises, to his voice and to his face. He looks more amused than anything, yes, but there’s something else there as well. Something barely concealed, hiding just beneath the surface. Moriarty has never been particularly efficient at hiding his emotions. But it’s different this time. The emotion barely hidden beneath the surface… that’s usually malice and Sherlock is used to that. Knows how to deal with it, at least to a certain extent.
Sherlock sees John’s jaw twitch and it’s frighteningly clear that he’s close to tears. He forces them back through sheer willpower.
? Why can't he just be like other people? Why must everything always be like this for him? A few, scant, hidden moments of forbidden thoughts and wants concealed within an overall respectable, nice,
But really John just thinks of Sherlock hesitating to call him out of some misplaced sense of obligation to not be bother when John should be happy with someone else and all John feels is a deep ache.
Sherlock realises with a start that they’re not alone in here. Someone is there behind John, obscured in the shadows of the room, but steadily moving closer, closer…
It’s not the first time Mary has suggested this. According to her, Sherlock will calm down about the wedding if he’s reassured that it won’t change anything. Her deduction, as she jokingly likes to refer to it, is that Sherlock is actually quite terrified by the prospect and currently overdoing it in terms of enthusiasm and planning just to get it over with. John isn’t quite sure what to think about her theory. The idea of Sherlock Holmes faking enthusiasm at the prospect of a social event seems farfetched. But then again, John can’t come up with any other plausible explanation for Sherlock’s behaviour and, to be quite honest, any suggestions to stop Sherlock going off on a veritable wedding planning spree are welcome at this point.
She raises an eyebrow, unimpressed. “You can’t give me any indication? None at all? I should just go back to our home and wait until my husband decides to grace me with his presence?”
Sherlock groans lowly at the very back of his throat, a deep baritone. His head lolls around before it’s lifted to look at Mycroft, as though that movement in itself causes more effort than Sherlock is willing to spare on it. John is struck by the contrast in his eyes, how he looks to be somewhere else entirely while still being able to maintain an intense glare. His mouth is slow to open. His speech is slightly slurred. Maybe it’s not just cocaine that he’s been subjecting himself to.
Sherlock hesitates at the kiss. Should he really share that? Isn’t that something that belongs to only him? Something that John has no right to know and would probably be better off not knowing in any case?
His other habits slowly return too. Sherlock’s mother has left a tin of homemade biscuits that John has to share with Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson two days later before they get too dry because Sherlock doesn’t eat any himself. He begins to make deductions about his doctors and nurses, sharing them with John as best he can with his limited verbal abilities and smiling as much as he’s able to whenever he manages to make John laugh.
Now John thinks of his life as before and after Sherlock. It just makes more sense. The difference between the John Watson before and after the army is nothing compared to the difference between the John Watson who met Sherlock Holmes in Bart’s Hospital, the John Watson who watched Sherlock Holmes throw himself off the very same building less than two years later and the John Watson sitting here now.
Only he’s not. Because somehow, John is here. Sweet, patient John. Who doesn’t understand half of what Jim had understood, who can’t look into Sherlock’s head and can’t put himself in Sherlock’s shoes, who can’t fathom what it means to be cursed with having a properly functioning brain in a world of idiots, who sees it only as the great gift and can’t even begin to grasp how badly it has destroyed any chance of a normal life Sherlock might otherwise have had.
Slowly, hour by hour, feelings and concerns other than just plain anxiety begin to creep up on John. He’s starting to look at Sherlock in a particular way again, one that he hasn't experienced in years. A
When Sherlock stirs in the morning and calls to John from his bedroom and John enters to find him trussed up in bed, duvet caught between his legs and curls splaying out across the pillow with a few stray strands sticking up at all sorts of odd angles. And Sherlock reaches out for him and taking that hand feels like coming home all over again.
Moriarty takes hold of his chin and pushes his head up until their eyes meet. Meet and stay interlocked. It’s intimate, more intimate than any other moment shared between them before. Sherlock ought to pull away.
But what he wants to say next is harder still. Because this isn’t just about him and Jim. It’s about John as well, about him and John and why he couldn’t help but accept Jim’s presence, why he couldn’t help but succumb to what he was offering.
John said he would be back first thing in the morning. That was two days ago. 24 hours has passed, and John has yet to communicate in any way. Not as much as a “fuck you”.
Now… Sherlock is bored, frustrated, lonely and depressed all at once, but only in between visits. When Moriarty is there, Sherlock can feel the weight of his own fragile psyche lifting, if only for a short while. Moriarty works on him like the perfect combination of cocaine and heroin, sharpening his mind instead of dulling his senses and numbing his loneliness instead of kicking it into overdrive. Being with Moriarty feels like shooting up with a fix of the most perfect drug Sherlock has ever encountered. Waiting for him carries the same anticipation as Sherlock feels on the way to a seedy mattress with his price in a small plastic bag and the lighter in his inner pocket.
And John himself is no better, drinking himself confident enough to make a not-so-subtle move on Sherlock at the stag night prior to his marriage to Mary. Of all times. Jesus, he’s such a mess. The hurt, guilt and betrayal that John felt at Sherlock’s apparent suicide might be lifting, but the results of it are more apparent than ever. If Sherlock hadn’t jumped… Christ, just the thought of it makes John want to scream. If only Sherlock hadn’t jumped, hadn’t gone off alone and left John to think the worst for two whole Goddamn years. Then he never would have had to change everything to avoid the worst reminders of their life together. He never would have had to move out of Baker Street and find a new flat. He never would have had to find a new job and then he never would have met Mary at the new clinic. He never would have needed a companion so badly that he jumped at the opportunity when he perceived that she was interested in starting a relationship. And even then, if Sherlock had just come back two months before he did, it wouldn’t have seemed like such a big deal to break it off again with Mary. They hadn’t been that serious then and it wouldn’t have seemed like that much of a loss to end the relationship. As it was, by the time Sherlock did actually come back, John and Mary had just moved in together and were entering that we’re-both-getting-older-so-let’s-just-get-on-with-starting-a-family-and-all-that phase. With things as uncertain with Sherlock as they had been in the beginning and John seriously questioning if he could ever forgive Sherlock for what he’d done, it had seemed too risky and unnecessary to end a good relationship just to be able to dedicate himself more fully to a definitely-not-good relationship instead. Now it’s all too late and John ought to just resign himself to that. Some chances, once lost, never present themselves again. He’s with someone else now, someone who’s been everything she promised she would be and more. It’s relaxed, it’s comfortable and, more than anything, it’s safe. Someone who doesn’t make John feel as though his emotions are fighting a war inside his head and doesn’t require him to constantly question his own sexuality. That ought to be enough. It’s better than what most people can get.
Jim continues, his voice low and intense. There’s an earnestness in his gaze now that Sherlock has never seen before.
Marginally pleased with this chapter actually, and that despite the fact I had to struggle really hard with John's bits. I think I find John so difficult to do because there's such a big difference between what he thinks and what he does. When you go inside his head, it's easy to forget that, and I struggle with conveying it in a not-clumsy and understandable way.
And yet the second he sees John’s face, he regrets it. Sherlock wishes fiercely to categorise the expression John sports as jealousy, but he’s afraid it might be disgust. And if it is, who could blame him?
There’s a darkening ring surrounding the outer edges of his vision, steadily growing to cover an increasing amount of the periphery of his eyesight. Narrowing his visual field. It disappears entirely for a couple of seconds as Sherlock feels himself blink, slowly and completely beyond his control. He most certainly did not tell his eyes to do that.
John sighs, deeply, and shakes his head. “I don’t know how I feel about that. I don’t know how I feel about… about there being some kind of other me that you’re… I don’t know, do you… do you talk to me? In your head? Put all kinds of words in my mouth that you make me say that I can’t… that I didn’t choose and I didn’t know about it and it’s not really me saying it, but then it sort of is…?”
The next thing he knows, the steady beeping of Sherlock’s heart monitor screeches into overdrive with a shrill cry of alarm, his heart rate accelerating wildly out of control. John throws one glance at the monitor before throwing himself across the room to contact the hospital staff. He’s still not as quick as they are, which, all things considered, might actually be a good sign. It takes less than half a minute for a nurse to come. She checks every monitor attached to him, she checks his IV stand, she measures his heart rate with a handheld heart rate monitor. She calls in a colleague, who repeats her procedures to the letter.
He can’t stop thinking about John. He can’t keep his mind from reproducing the look in John’s eyes as he finally looked up long enough to understand that Sherlock was there. The shock had been just as grand as Sherlock had anticipated. But he’d hoped to find the shock replaced with warm recognition and perhaps a slight crinkling at the corners of the eyes, which Sherlock recognises as a sign of joy or content in John. To see it replaced with hurt and disbelief instead had been infinitely more painful than anything else John had dealt him in the course of the evening.
“You don’t have anything on then? At all?” This takes John slightly by surprise. As far as he is aware, Sherlock hasn’t been working all that much for quite a while now. That usually equals one very full inbox and one very impatient Sherlock, dying to get on with a new case. Sherlock doesn’t seem to be very much in a hurry at all, shrugging and putting the petri dish aside.
After a while, John begins to undress him again, sensing that Sherlock’s thoughts are back on track. When he gestures for Sherlock to get rid of the dressing gown and shirt completely, it causes yet another momentary lapse until Sherlock gathers his courage and does as John asks, baring his back.
“And if it was something acceptable, I wouldn’t have backtracked,” Sherlock counters, but his objections fall on deaf ears and an expectant smile.
They settle down, Sherlock obstinately seated on the floor, but John and Mary sit down beside each other on the couch. Maybe Mary notices something hanging in the air, something loaded and heavy-feeling in the silence between them, because she glances at John as if to ask him to confirm that everything is indeed alright.
Why they always have to do this… open up only to hurt each other and then immediately close off again… John really can’t tell and it’s been going on now for longer than he wants to admit. That age-old frustration builds up again and it’s more than John can take right now, with everything else in his life feeling just as confused and uncertain and
“Well, you’re a doctor, what do you have to say?” Sherlock speaks slowly, sounding tired, but there’s no denying that a certain gleam has been creeping back into his eyes during the last couple of days.
“It’s the beginning of the Spring/Summer term. He’s just arrived. As far as I could tell, it’s from Deutsche Bank.”
“Anyway. Somehow, the drugs… I don’t know. When I went into my Mind Palace, it was… different. Things were different in there.”
Which turns out to be a big mistake. Sherlock’s hand feels cold in his, unnatural, the muscles loose without a hint of intention. It feels… it feels
Sherlock hadn’t even looked at him as he’d replied “You know my methods, John. I am known to be indestructible.” The pompous bastard.
A brief flash of fire in between the branches sends his heart rate into the stratosphere. He tries to shout again, but with the same result. He waits then, anticipating every second to hear the horrifying sound of a fire igniting the wood surrounding him. It doesn’t come. The seconds pass, but it seems as though the fire can’t catch on.
“It was not your fault, John," he says. He means it. "It was not your fault. If you hadn’t left then, maybe it would have been different. But I asked you to leave, knowing how I felt and knowing what I might do in your absence. It was my responsibility. Mine alone. I can’t undo what happened afterwards, but it was not your fault. You did your best and more. You couldn’t have prevented it. And Moriarty… that was not your fault either and I didn’t say it was. I said it was partly because of you and that’s true. You were gone. In my head, you were gone. I couldn’t bring you forward, I couldn’t visualise you into existence. You were gone and all I knew was that time seemed to pass and you didn’t show up. And I… I was lonely!” he finally admits. “I was lonely because you weren’t there and you weren’t coming. I needed you there, your presence mattered to me, but you weren’t there! When Jim turned up, I was desperate for some companionship. You don’t know what it’s like, to not be able to get out, to not be able to communicate with anyone, to watch people pass by outside, but it’s just window dressing, all of it, and you can’t hear them and they can’t hear you! So I accepted what he offered! I know I should not have, but I did! It wasn’t your fault, but it was at least partly about you! And when I had to make the final decision, it… it was between you or him and I… I chose you!”
It’s not because of any observable decline in his circumstances. When he was 23, he was living alone, doing drugs to cope with his loneliness, telling himself he didn’t need the company of any half-arsed idiots to feel content, trying to make a niche for his special abilities professionally yet constantly being either too high or too down and out to do any actual work. That sounds like quite the decent summary of his current situation too.
It matters with Sherlock. It’s always mattered with Sherlock, John has always known that it does and it has always made him feel deeply uncomfortable. Confused. He feels excessively old for an identity crisis, but that’s what it’s felt like for the past five years whenever Sherlock has gotten just a bit too close. Thus has he passed the time, pulling away when Sherlock leans in and leaning in when Sherlock pulls away. Denying every accusation aimed at them (seemingly from all directions), yet always insisting on staying close and taking pride in being Sherlock’s main support. In a constant state of uncertainty about who he is and who he wants to be. And uncertainty concerning Sherlock too. Sherlock, who always seems to commit an act showing a clear lack of conscience and morals right when John has convinced himself that it’s all just a façade, and then reveal a bit of his heart and a genuine smile of affection right when John is abandoning all hope.
That’s why John made the decision he made, and now he’ll have to live with that. You don’t reap what you sow. You reap what you care for as it grows. John has sown many seeds throughout the years, but he’s only truly taken care of two. And only one has come to fruition. What’s done is done. If he wanted it differently, he should have spoken a long time ago.
Sherlock is holding himself in an upright position with both hands planted on the floor in front of him. John lifts him up carefully, supporting him by the shoulders.
, could have sat with him on this very sofa at this very moment, with Jim’s arm wrapped around him instead of John’s and Jim whispering mischievous, ill-intentioned little quips into his ear along with logistical puzzles for him to solve and cleverly disguised endearments.
“That’s what ordinary people do, you know,” Jim continues. “Tell each other the same boring, predictable fairy tales over and over. Again and again. Until everyone collectively decide that there is some meaning in there worth preserving. Making morals out of nothing. Fooling themselves and others into thinking that their subjective ideas of right and wrong are objective truths.”
“Oh, fuck off!” It’s John’s turn for his temper to run away with him. He shakes his head, an angry habit of his that’s always annoyed the hell out of him. “Yes, I remember. It was your brother’s plan not to tell anyone. Bloody brilliant. Had a good laugh about that, did you?”
Sherlock almost audibly gasps as the contents start to spill out. Like the puncturing of a ship’s hull causing water to start seeping in.
Sherlock is eager and pliant beneath him, his long limbs wrapped around John’s frame with an almost desperate earnestness. His lips are close to John’s ear. John feels rather than hears his heated gasps, feels rather than hears the deep rumbles in his chest when John accidentally brushes against something that causes him to let out a long, drawn-out moan. It goes straight to John’s own groin. Sherlock feels thin and concerningly bone-y, but John’s doctor side is pushed increasingly further to the back as his instincts take over and his mind is filled completely up by
“You should go back upstairs,” she continues as she returns to their table. “I’m sure he’ll be awake again soon. You wouldn’t want to miss that.” Her tone exists somewhere around the intersection between light-hearted teasing, genuine concern and a spiteful disdain that John isn’t sure he wishes to examine any further.
Remembering Mary’s advice from this morning, and remembering the other three times or so that she has brought it up during the last couple of days, John moves on to the subject of a new case. He glances down at the petri dish underneath Sherlock’s microscope. “So… other than contaminating everything while carrying out chemical experiments in a part of the house intended for the preparation of food for human consumption, do you have any other pressing engagements?”
The depth and persistence of these thoughts of his haven’t been entirely clear to him before. Not until he’s started paying attention to them has he noticed just how far this has gone.
John is taken completely by surprise, so stunned that he momentarily forgets how he’s supposed to feel disconnected from everything and just stares instead. He almost feels bad for witnessing this. Feels as though he ought to look away. John may be Sherlock’s best friend, his flatmate of five years. A man who’s witnessed just about every major altercation between the Holmes boys during that time span and even participated in some of them. Yet somehow, this feels just a tad too close, too private, too intimate for John to be watching. As though he’s peeping in on a scene that he has no right to know about. A connection that runs so deep and is usually so well hidden that John feels like an intruder just for being here, getting a glimpse of an affection that was never his to glimpse.
So John does the only thing he can think of to convey his understanding. He takes Sherlock’s other hand.
“You moved on during those two years. You have a different life now compared to the one you had when he left. He doesn’t. But it’s not your responsibility to abandon your new life to fulfill your old function in his. It’s not your responsibility, John. You can’t spend your life taking care of him.”
That’s what he says and once it’s done, it’s done. It’s out there in the world and it can’t be taken back. It can’t be unsaid.
familiarity and an equally distinctive masculine novelty. It’s sensual and intense as John’s previous kisses have been, yet both sensuality and intensity are amplified by the unpredictability, the danger, the forbidden nature of this kiss… and by Sherlock himself, who is every bit as passionate as John has oftentimes accused him of being cold. John can tell he’s not that experienced, there’s a nervous, almost stumbling undercurrent to his movements and he doesn’t appear to be quite in balance. Yet what he lacks in skill, he more than makes up for in enthusiasm, and there’s a not insubstantial part of John who delights in knowing that he is the first and only person to have ever tasted this.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say. He’s mortified to discover that any sound he makes probably has a high chance of coming out as a sob.
desire to come home. He just took his behaviour at The Landmark on that fateful fucking evening at face value and then never stopped to re-examine. He’ll never learn.
People who think that not seeing something coming is the worst thing you can experience are idiots. Idiots who never see anything coming and thus have nothing to compare with. The worst thing by far is to see it all coming and yet wilfully head straight for the abyss. Then it truly is a bitter feeling when you're on the way down.
Sherlock whips around to face him, breaking him off before John can question him. A moment ago, they were laughing, but now Sherlock’s eyes are hard as flint and glistening with what looks alarmingly like yet more unshed tears. The sudden change leaves John reeling, struggling desperately to catch up. The unspoken things coalesce into a tightly wound up little ball of…
“Cars can be ordered. Private jets commandeered.” Sherlock tries to keep his voice light. Serious admissions and open conversations are not their usual milieu. Emotional phone calls and honest requests not their strongest suit.
“Thought we’d lost you for a moment,” Mycroft continues, seemingly unperturbed. “May I just check: is this what you mean by
While Sherlock was… well, while he was gone, in lack of a more suitable phrase, John couldn’t talk about it. And although it was constantly somewhere just on the edge of conscious thought, he didn’t think about it directly either. In hindsight, perhaps he’d thought that it was irrelevant to really analyse it, dissect it as Sherlock would a week-old corpse and try to make something of it. Any conclusion would be too late anyway. Except now it’s not. Now it’s a very relevant subject and it seems to only increase in importance as the days go by and the atmosphere between the two of them shifts. First mischievous crime solving as though the last two years hasn’t happened at all. Then awkward manoeuvring aimed at getting three people to fit into a space developed for two. And finally downright horrendous moments of suspended eye contact and emotional conversations rising to the surface without being spoken before the cycle starts all over again. John feels as though he might go mad.
Sherlock swallows, but he suddenly looks slightly upset. “While inviting you to join my work,“ he says, sounding almost as though he thinks
Maybe they should go home. It’s getting late and John hasn’t eaten all day. There seems to be no change in Sherlock’s condition and, even if there should be, they don’t have to stay and wait for it. The nurses will call them straight away if anything should happen. They’ll keep both their phones off mute all night and place them by the bedside, that’s a promise. They can’t sleep in these chairs, now can they?
“Well, you’re a nurse. Do you agree with John’s assessment that I still need to be mollycoddled now that you’ve had a look at me?”
If he had any decency, he’d tell both Mary and Sherlock to stay the hell away from him, because he’s not worth it. He doesn’t deserve any of them. But he’s too weak to say that. He already knows he’d never be able to go through with actually trying to push any of them away, even if it was for their own sake. He’s not like Sherlock. He couldn’t bear to isolate himself for the sake of others.
Mary keeps holding his gaze, assessing his response. John leans back in his chair, assessing her reaction.
John purchases the pair, but decides against getting them gift-wrapped at the store. He knows that if Sherlock were to spot such a package, it’d only be a matter of time before he would figure out where it had been purchased and from there it’s a short way to him guessing at the contents. Which is one of Sherlock’s favourite pastimes around Christmas, the childish spoilsport. This time, John is determined to keep it a surprise.
Sherlock is sitting slumped back in his armchair, one foot pushing at a stack of books on the floor in front of him. He’s gradually shoving the book on top of the pile further and further towards the edge. Waiting for the moment when the balance will shift. Waiting for the moment when the book will tip over and tumble on to the floor.
After everything they’ve both been through, to have all of this with John now – their home, their family, their child, each other – it’s a privilege that Sherlock isn’t quite sure he deserves, but one that he nevertheless feels infinitely blessed by. That John really, truly seems to have chosen Sherlock for his partner, trusted him with John’s heart, trusted him to raise John’s
There’s no reply. Sherlock waits a little, listening keenly for any sound of movement on the stairs. When it becomes apparent that none is forthcoming, he tries again.
It comforts him in a way, the knowledge that his filing system has escaped these two years mostly unscathed. Even if nothing else works, at least Sherlock’s brain is still filing away information in the same way as it always has. And if something is too painful, he can just store it away very far back in his mind. Put it behind locked doors and throw away the key. It’s how he survives. It’s how he has always survived and it’s how he will survive this, too.
John has a little alcohol in the blood from the punch they’ve just consumed together with Mrs. H, but he’s had nowhere near the amount necessary for it to have any effect on him. He briefly congratulates himself on that account. Liquid courage is a tried and true though not particularly responsible preparatory measure for John whenever he wants to
only as in why I didn’t tell you.” Sherlock scoffs again, an unamused chuckle. “I should feel insulted. The one question you wanted to ask, the one thing you deemed important enough to hear me out on, and then you chose to ask the question with the simplest, most straightforward answer that anyone with even a smidge of intelligence should be able to answer for themselves. Having successfully faked my own death after being pursued by the police wanting to arrest me and no less than four professional assassins trying to simultaneously keep me safe and extort information from me, the last thing I needed was for the whole fucking world to know that I wasn’t actually dead!”
. Good as in healed. Good as in just knowing that Sherlock is still here, in the world, had set off a happiness in his chest so fierce that it almost hurt as badly as it had hurt that day at Bart’s. Good as in no matter how badly Sherlock might have hurt John, no matter how badly John needs answers to all his questions, just being in Sherlock’s presence had been enough to fill in those gaps in John’s self that emerged after Sherlock’s so-called death and make him feel like a whole being once again. And the truly infuriating part of it all had been the realisation that John had been right,
Rosie is pointing out of the window for what feels like the thirtieth time this afternoon, apparently completely besotted by the way the snowflakes seem to suddenly appear at the top of the window only to subsequently disappear at the bottom. Her hot breath creates fog on the glass. Her arms are flailing excitedly.
His mind isn’t what it used to be. Maybe John is right. Maybe he has finally destroyed something important in his brain through his continued substance abuse. Or maybe it’s this infernal noise, tearing through layer after layer of his mind with a sound and sensation not unlike nails on chalkboard. Does it matter?
Mycroft lingers for about three seconds to hear if Sherlock has anything more to say. Then he turns and leaves the building the same way that he entered, leaving Sherlock sitting in his chair with Moriarty still wrapped around him.
Sherlock’s head snaps towards him and their eyes meet. He still doesn’t say anything, but it breaks the cloying air of disconnected disinterest hanging around him.
Sherlock manages to stand his ground, albeit not without a few crises, until John and Mary have to dance the waltz. As soon as Sherlock picks up the bow and John picks up Mary, it becomes horrifyingly apparent that no amount of rehearsal on Sherlock’s part has been sufficient to prepare him for this moment either. With no more need for his logic mind, Sherlock’s emotions sneak back up on him and overwhelm him completely. Witnessing the actual marriage was bad enough. Seeing John guiding Mary along through the traditional first waltz as a married couple is a whole new level of torture rivalling even the worst moments of his time in Serbia. Sherlock can’t help the comparison, can’t help picturing the way John would hold
in his eyes in a way Sherlock hasn’t seen in so long it almost feels like a dream. A distant memory of a lifetime ago.
If they could talk about these things, what would Sherlock say? Would he call John a friend? Is that something Sherlock can do, calling another person his friend in a situation where he’s not just saying whatever he can come up with in order to either apologise or manipulate? John honestly don’t know. That’s the thing about Sherlock. It’s always the unexpected.
a couple of weeks before during their half-hearted attempts to not break down laughing while Sherlock tried to teach John how to dance. He doesn’t feel like laughing now. Like with everything else today, he just isn’t ready when push comes to shove. From control to panic and back again. From hurt to pretended indifference and back again. From logic to emotion and back again. All of it blowing in the wind. All of it laid bare for all to see.
“So,” Mary opens, looking at him with that expression which is not truly unkind yet not fully amicable either. “It’s been a while. Our wedding just a couple of months away and my husband is practically a stranger.”
Here he lies, this sad little nonentity that he’s turned into between Moriarty’s visits, curled up on the sofa in his pyjamas, week-old dishes in need of cleaning stacked in piles a mile high all over the flat, tea growing cold in his cup, thinking of John and just
It should be tempting. Everything Moriarty has said or done from the moment he stepped into 221B has been tempting in one way or another. But not this time. Somehow part of him is able to register the temptation, that voice inside of him that he has granted increasing control lately repeating Jim’s words back to him, assuring him how quick and easy it would be to do as Jim asks him to, reminds him how far he has come compared to what he now has to do.
As if that wasn’t concerning enough, a small note has recently been hung up above the table in the main hallway. He’s looking at it now. It’s written in his own hand.
But Sherlock doesn’t wish for John. John isn’t coming and no amount of wishful thinking is going to change that. Sherlock might as well invest his energy in being logically emotional. Rather pathetically wish for the appearance of someone who might actually appear than pathetically wish for the appearance of someone who clearly isn’t going to.
“Because of me? Oh, so this is my fault? It’s my fault you overdosed and ended up unconscious for a week and now it’s also my fault that you invited Moriarty to keep you company while you were trapped in there! Oh, fuck off, you prick!”
“Serbia was the last piece of the puzzle. It was supposed to be easy. I got a call from Mycroft saying that my name had been cleared in court just as I was landing at the airport in Niš, in disguise and under a pseudonym of course.” Sherlock hesitates for a moment. “I think I got a little carried away after that. Knowing that I could return to London as soon as the business in Serbia was cleared up… I got eager to get it over with and that made me careless.”
Sherlock has never been strong enough to resist it. But John has always been there to resist it for him. John has always been strong on his behalf. John has always given him a reason to fight it, offered him an alternative target for his loneliness.
He isn’t trying to hurt himself. It isn’t some misguided attempt to make himself suffer for his failures or pay for his weakness. It’s just soothing. But of course, such experimentation is strictly limited to whenever John isn’t here. Sherlock is certain that this is one of those things John wouldn’t understand.
He really should talk with his therapist about it. That’s what you’re supposed to do, isn’t it? Talk everything through, have a bit of a cry, pat on the back and on you go with your life. Supposed to be good for you. John just can’t do it. It’s not just that he doesn’t like having to talk about how he feels. It’s not even that he can’t think of anything worse than others seeing him cry, especially when it’s a stranger who’s being paid to be sympathetic. He has paid, after all, and talked and even cried. But what he hasn’t said yet are the things that he can’t bring himself to share, not with anyone. He didn’t share them with Sherlock. He should have done so, he shouldn’t have waited, but he did and now it’s too late forever. Sharing them now, posthumously, with a virtual stranger would feel utterly wrong.
Sherlock feels his fingers lock around the pew. He holds on so tightly that it hurts where the wood digs into the soft skin of his palm. His knuckles must be white with the exertion, but he doesn’t take his eyes off the altar to check. It’s all he can do to not stand up and flat out scream.
And yes, Sherlock will be outraged at the amount of food he’ll be forced to consume and complain about all the energy his body will need to spend on digesting it when that energy could be spent so much better on his brain. He’ll sigh very audibly every time a carol can be heard over the telly or the radio or just from the street outside, just so that John can’t
The front door closes downstairs and it goes very quiet all of a sudden. As though they’ve both been waiting for this.
She’s relentless. “You cheated on me. You just admitted that. And now you want to stay with the guy you cheated on me with because you don’t know who you want to end up with. Isn’t that the truth?”
As time passes and John still refuses to appear, Sherlock can feel his impatience grow. After how angry John had seemed to be yesterday and his promise to be back first thing in the morning, it’s a tiny bit rude of him to postpone his return like this, isn’t it? It must be at least noon by now. Mrs. Hudson hasn’t stopped by yet either. And that despite the fact that Mr. Chinnery must surely have left by now to play what Sherlock is genuinely unable to refer to as music, at least not without such a hefty dose of sarcasm that it never fails to appal John and Mrs. Hudson alike. As though it’s his fault he was born without the appropriate level of amusia to endure Mr. Chinnery’s so-called playing.
Maybe they can go for a walk together. Talk in private while they walk as they used to back when they were first dating and John couldn’t stand to sit still for long. Maybe he can lay it all out, plain and clear. Offer her the truth and see what she wants to do with it. She used to be such a wonderful listener, hearing John complain and explain and despair for hours on end without ever seeming annoyed. Perhaps he can talk to her about this as well, talk to her and apologise and see where it goes from there. At least then he wouldn’t be lying to her, wouldn’t be hiding away at Baker Street, citing Sherlock’s medical condition as the reason when really at least part of the explanation is that John doesn’t know what to do.
Sherlock falls silent again and John can’t bring himself to inquire further. He’s a doctor, he’s been doctoring in war zones. The scars spreading out over Sherlock’s back like an entangled cobweb are lash marks. Perhaps that’s all John needs to know. Although his subconscious is certainly more than eager to supply his inner eye with imagined glimpses he doesn’t wish to see.
let go? As if this is something to be hidden away, swept under the rug and forgotten about as much as possible? As if it can be unseen? As if they can just pretend that John hasn’t seen the thirty-odd pale lines meandering their way across the expanse of Sherlock’s back?
Worst of all, though, is the silence within the flat itself. No matter how efficient Sherlock is at blocking out distracting noises, it’s never completely quiet in the flat. He can always hear Mrs. Hudson. Doing laundry. Vacuuming. Watching telly. He can even hear her cooking sometimes, especially when it’s not going according to plan and she’s complaining about it out loud. Even when she’s occasionally not making any noise, he can always feel her presence in the building. Now it’s gone. There are no noises. No footsteps, no voices, no tellies, no vacuum cleaners, no washing machines. It’s just… quiet. Sherlock knows that he would find empty room after empty room if he were to go downstairs. He can’t check. But he doesn’t need to check either. He can feel it.
That Sherlock barely seems to understand what he’s so keyed up about only adds to John’s anger. He genuinely seems unable or unwilling to understand what the problem is, and no amount of glares or shouts from John’s side go the slightest way towards making him. That he’s likely still affected by the drugs in his system and not in full possession of the situation does nothing to halt John’s frustration with him.
“Oh.” John nods, though he isn’t quite sure what he nods in response to. “Can I help you with that?”
When John finally returns with the shopping, Sherlock is far enough out to have started biting his own knuckles. It’s a peculiar habit he’s in the process of developing, one of several. They all have to do with his hands. Somehow, the tactile stimulation helps to soothe his nerves. Sometimes he bites his knuckles. Sometimes it’s enough to tighten the muscles in his hands and fingers, press them against one another, wrap his fingers around each other and pull in opposite directions, make his joints stretch and snap. Sometimes he needs stronger stimulation. He experiments with different sensations. Running his fingers over a cheese grater. Letting the very tips of his fingers sink into freshly brewed tea, the water temperature still past 90 degrees Celsius. They have a little cactus, struggling for space on the windowsill among empty takeout boxes and chemistry books, barely clinging on to life at approximately two waterings a year. A cactus is the only type of plant who could survive such treatment, if barely. But it’s useful for other things too. Sherlock enjoys pressing the entire palm of his hand down over that cactus. He enjoys giving it a squeeze, feeling the spikes dig into his skin like so many little needles. He doesn’t press hard enough for the spikes to breach the skin. Just enough to feel it, just enough for every spike to leave a little indentation for a few minutes.
No. He just needs to wait for John. John will make it all better. Even if Sherlock hates himself for needing that.
By the time the ambulance finally arrives, John feels as though he’s already gone half mad with worry and frustration and the looks on the paramedics’ faces do nothing to appease his fears. Both he and Mrs. Hudson end up coming along in the ambulance. John really feels as though he ought to say something to her, she must be just as shocked and horrified as he is, but nothing comes to mind and he’s honestly too wrung out to open his mouth, so he doesn’t. Mrs. Hudson seems to feel the same and so they sit squeezed together in a corner of the ambulance, both pairs of eyes fixed on Sherlock’s pale face as the paramedics do their best to ascertain his condition and stabilise him, neither of them uttering a word all the way from Baker Street to Bart’s.
as it had on that day. That old despair, that all-consuming emptiness that John hasn’t felt in quite a while… it rises up again in front of him now, like a wave waiting to crash into him and pull him under, knock the air out of his lungs and keep him from breathing. He can already feel it, clammy hands wrapping themselves around his throat and turning every breath into a struggle.
When they finally part, it’s with a sigh and a shuddering exhale. Sherlock’s cheeks are lightly flushed, a reddish tint to his usually so pale skin. John’s own skin has heated up as well and he can only imagine that
. The response is formulated relatively quickly. But the words never leave his mouth. While his Broca’s area seems to be up to the task of responding, he has no idea where to even begin to look for his vocal chords. He briefly stops to ponder how exactly he can be naming separate areas of his brain and yet not be able to make himself say as simple a phrase as
emotions piling up have nowhere to go. This gradual loss of control over his mind palace seems to be the result. His increasingly obsessive inner monologue is pulling him apart, giving him headaches and depriving him of his sleep.
It takes Sherlock a long time to reach the lowest levels of his mind palace, even though the way there is etched into his memory. He takes his time, carefully analysing every whisper and sensation as they occur to him. Cataloguing his own emotional responses. The steady dripping from the ceilings is almost deafening down here. Postponing this moment has only given the leak time to spread, to seep into every crack and crevice and spread its tendrils out from the basement to the upper levels. It’s been more than half a year since Serbia and every day passed has only made it worse. In the end, he can’t run from this. He’s known all along that any attempt to do so would ultimately prove pointless, but he hasn’t had the strength to face the problem head on before. Or perhaps he hasn’t been desperate enough until now. One explanation seems as likely as the other.
“I’m starving,” he says by way of explanation when Sherlock raises an eyebrow at him. He gestures towards the kitchen. “I shopped for that spring pea risotto you like. I could make that if you want.”
He wants to please Jim, of course he does, it’s all he wants to do, really. Or so he’d thought. Anything to keep Jim here just a moment longer, to keep him interested and attentive and loving.
Sherlock has always had a penchant for the case. He’ll read and watch anything he can find on the Ripper murders, provided that the information is accurate and presented with as little fanfare as possible. He seems to know enough about the historical facts to be able to smell any hint of dramatization a mile away, which does beg the question (at least to John's mind) why he would even care about one more book or documentary going over the same minute details he already knows more about than the authors and experts. Repetition usually isn’t his cup of tea, to put it mildly. But it seems he’s willing to make an exception when it comes to this particular case and John is more than happy to oblige him.
!” Sherlock shouts the last word, for the first time letting John glimpse the bottom of his despair. John feels dangerously short on air.
They’ve had arguments before, of course they have. All couples argue. Argue about the same stupid things again and again. For them, it’s always been John’s attachment to his previous life with Sherlock and Mary’s overreaction to the same. They’ve had this argument before. It’s just never been this… acidic. Or perhaps John is just feeling particularly sensitive tonight. Sherlock is sleeping less than ten feet away, recovering from an unexplainably prolonged unconsciousness that cost him a stay in hospital. Couldn’t Mary at least
But he loves Mary too, and she’s the one he’s committed himself to. She’s the choice he’s made. Not Sherlock.
Later, during the days spent curled up in bed, the things he has said has been unarticulated to the point that he barely knows himself what he has ended up getting out over the months.
and a box filled with random bits and bobs that Sherlock hasn’t had time to sort through just yet. He recently pulled out a flight manual for a Boeing 737 and a guide on how to safely get rid of a Molotov Cocktail from in between a recipe for Egg Rolls and a book of German fairy tales. Though Sherlock keeps most of his mind palace perfectly ordered, rooms used more or less exclusively as dumping grounds for random facts awaiting deletion isn’t disconcerting in and of itself. Rooms covered in barricade tape, however, is quite another story.
. Absolutely bloody brilliant, in fact, they couldn’t be better. Which one can so rarely say in real life.
For a moment Sherlock feels himself hesitate, choked by a sudden cloying uncertainty. What he and Jim had, it had been perfect for such a short moment and then it had all been gone. It hadn’t been real, but that fact hadn’t diminished the pain of its loss. What he and John now have barely feels real either, and Sherlock is suddenly struck by a deep fear of losing this too, of opening a door somewhere and suddenly waking up, alone once again. The thought nearly causes him to panic for the briefest of moments. The instinctive urge to reveal his suspicions about Mary just to keep John with him feels pressing, the words tingling on his tongue.
For a moment, John hesitates, meaning to leave it at that. But he can do better and one glance at Sherlock reveals that he has to if he’s hoping for a response.
“It was the day before I left England. I don’t know why I did it, it was stupid and meaningless, but I just…” He shrugs. “It was the lesser of two evils. I could leave without having seen you, in which case I wouldn’t have subjected myself to the ordeal of standing there from a distance and watch you and turn away and get on a plane not knowing when I’d come home.” A pause. “Not knowing
And then John will read for him. A quaint little case of blood and murder and dismemberment that most other people would probably not be able to fall asleep to. He will read until Sherlock will shift and say “I’ll just turn around for a moment” in that same barely legible voice. And before John can count to three, he’s out cold.
John finds him in the living room of 221B, standing quietly in the middle of the room with his gaze fixed on a spot on the floor directly between their two chairs.
“John,” she interrupts again, holding his gaze seriously. “I can make this work, but I have to know whether you’re in or not. Yes or no? It’s as simple as that.”
your choice. So if you want to go with Mary, you can. But I dare you to tell me that it’s what you want before you go!”
John nods thoughtfully. “Perhaps that’s true,” he concedes, smiling in that wry, partly humorous, partly serious way. “But you kept me waiting long enough, you know.” John sighs in mock exasperation and shakes his head. “You utter cock.”
John looks down. For some reason, it’s easier to say things that matter if he’s not looking into Sherlock’s eyes. Illogical human nature. He’s getting better at noticing it when it crops up, but he’ll probably never be able to tamp it down like Sherlock does.
Sherlock nods, smiling politely and, frankly, a bit impersonally. Maybe he does have this thing under more control than John initially gave him credit for.
He sees John swallow again, more heavily this time. His eyes could not be farther from expressionless, yet Sherlock can’t for the life of him decipher what he’s seeing there.
Plans change when you inadvertently open the lid on three years’ worth of longing and hidden feelings that should have stayed firmly locked away.
While Sherlock is still mostly silent and highly restricted in his movements (indeed he’s more or less confined to communicating via pointed looks and exasperated sighs that are a bit too loud and obnoxious for comfort and sound suspiciously as though he’s trying to whinge), the situation does at least begin to resemble something that John can deal with as Sherlock grows increasingly aware and responsive during the next 24 hours. The first time he complains of boredom, which is on the second day, it’s almost a relief.
Sherlock suddenly feels as though he’s been dipped in ice water. His phone is showing him it’s still early morning when it must be noon. Mrs. Hudson hasn’t heard him shouting even though she must be here. The door is locked even though it isn’t. Reality is telling him one thing and yet he knows,
“But is it, you think, more times than he’s said the exact opposite? That he’s called you uncaring, cold, over-rational, uncomprehending in the face of emotions, a machine? A brain without a heart. And meant it to be a critique, mind. How many times hasn’t he shouted at you, accused you of only caring about the puzzle and not the lives at stake? Is it more or less times than he’s given you praise and recognition? In the end, is he not one of those people who only ever cared about the results you gave them?”
. The situation had felt wrong, more wrong than any other situation John has ever found himself in, but his emotional response to that situation had felt just right. However ashamed he had been to find himself leaning against perfect strangers, however much he’d hated himself for lying curled up in bed until three o’clock in the afternoon, however damaging it had been to his self-worth to wake up in the morning and realise that he’d actually gone to the shops the night before to buy yet more booze in his already heavily inebriated state and made a complete fool of himself in public, it had felt right to be grieving the way he did. He’d been virtually friendless apart from the friends he’d met through Sherlock. He’d been between girlfriends and neither of his previous encounters had left him feeling particularly emotionally attached. He’d had little immediate family, certainly not one he’d been close to. Grieving for Sherlock as the most important person in John’s life had been easy, natural and indeed inevitable. It had been unproblematic.
Well. At least the living room looks the same as alway,s with no visible scatters of syringes or lighters on any surfaces.
The electrical current passes between them again. Jim’s eyes practically ignite and the air between them seems to vibrate with unreleased tension.
I'm so sorry for the unbearably long wait on this one. As a small recompense for how long overdue this is, please accept this extra-long update as a token of my gratitude for sticking with this story.
Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Happy Kwanzaa or just a joyful time of year whatever you do or do not celebrate to everyone! I hope you have a wonderful time and wish you all the best for the New Year!
So yes. It had been a bit of a relief when she went home yesterday. Which only makes John feel even worse.
“Funny you should mention them, seeing as you don’t seem to use them all that much,” Sherlock retorts, a playful glimmer in his eyes and smirk that John has missed almost too fiercely for words. He looks so much better when he smiles. So much healthier than he has for the last couple of months. Not quite as fatigued either, though the dark circles under his eyes are just a little bit too obvious under the bright lights in the kitchen. “Careful now,” John warns, feigning indignation, and Sherlock’s smirk widens.
No one ever said that Sherlock was good at faking normality. If he was, he would probably not have ended up in this situation to begin with.
Mycroft locks eyes with his brother, deducing on him with the cold objectivity that is his particular trademark. He’s not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
There’s no denying the bitterness in his tone. Sherlock is about to end the call and switch off the phone when Mycroft speaks again. He naturally can’t allow Sherlock’s confirmation to be the parting line. Regardless of what John seems to think, it’s Sherlock’s informed opinion that Mycroft is the one most likely to outlive God trying to have the last word.
It's then that John makes his decision, his final decision. He's told Sherlock that he wasn't going anywehere, but it's only now that he announces his decision to himself. He listens to his own thoughts as Sherlock lies snuggled up in the crook of his arm, his silent breath warming John’s collarbone and he knows. He can’t go back to Mary. He just can’t. No matter what may or may not happen between Sherlock and himself… if John goes back to Mary now, he’ll never find out and he knows he’ll spend the rest of his life regretting it. What he can have with Mary… safety and certainty and normality… at the time, it had been all John had felt he needed. But it’s not all he longs for. What he longs for is Sherlock – danger and uncertainty and adventure, risking everything and throwing convention to the wind. He can never have that with Mary. So he might be able to content himself with Mary… but he won’t be happy, not like this. Not like how he feels in this moment. And he honestly can’t stomach the thought of never feeling like this again.
At this, Sherlock groans in irritation at the bloodied napkin in front of him. John has hit him once before, but that had all been in good fun in the side alley of a state residence near Eaton Square in Belgravia. John hadn’t been angry then, only annoyed by Sherlock’s own, half-hearted punch and perhaps feeling a little put-upon after the morning’s events. It had been expected, controlled, almost kind of comical in its own way. It had felt like being ten years old again and being stupid just for the fun of it. It hadn’t
It’s a full hour before Sherlock wakes up again, by which time Lestrade and Molly have both come and gone (understandable seeing as it’s actually a perfectly ordinary Wednesday afternoon – the idea of normal, everyday life happening outside of the four walls of the hospital seems a weirdly surreal concept). The congregation still numbers John, Mary, Mrs. Hudson and Mycroft, though, which is certainly more than Sherlock had been expecting, judging by his expression. He squints his eyes, an endearing little frown line appearing between his eyebrows, and looks around dizzily. His gaze is unfocused and sweeps across each face in turn without pausing for any details to really sink in. He’s still well and truly under, then. Had Sherlock been fully awake, he would never have allowed himself to be out for a full three days and then not pause for deductions upon returning to the real world.
John glances at Sherlock. Sherlock nods encouragingly and looks back at him. He’s being unusually patient and understanding tonight. Perhaps it’s because it’s Christmas.
“Alright, fine! We’ve had some disagreements during the last couple of days. I didn’t want to involve you. It had nothing to do with you. And as your doctor, I’m prescribing maximum rest. But yes, there have been some disagreements.”
John and Sherlock have always had and still have many, firmly established traditions: John making two cups of tea in the morning (a ritual so deeply ingrained in his subconscious that it had taken him months to get rid of it after he’d moved out of 221B following the Fall – a constant reminder and one of the most frequent causes behind his flashbacks in the early days of his life post-Sherlock - but now he gets to do it again and he’s finding that it works better than any therapy he’s ever gone to), Sherlock making deductions about the characters (and often about the actors and actresses) in John’s favourite series on the telly, John hiding the remote control whenever said favourite series is on in order to prevent Sherlock from changing the channel (which Sherlock will inevitably do if John forgets about the remote, the bloody bastard), John always bringing his gun on even the most mundane-sounding cases because he knows that Sherlock will have forgotten all about personal safety the moment he gets the bit between his teeth and Sherlock ultimately allowing John to take care of any injuries he might have sustained while on a case despite vehemently objecting to the procedure all the way through.
And to hell with it all – to hell with Mary, with John’s sexuality, with all the consequences of this moment that seem to be mounting in front of them. John isn’t going to let that stand. He isn’t going to hurt Sherlock again.
It works sometimes. But feigning indifference isn’t always the smartest coping mechanism. Now Mycroft is sure to dig deeper, expose that raw nerve just a bit further. Why does he never learn?
There was never any real doubt in John's mind who he wanted his best man to be. He's never considered asking anyone else. Even so, when he did ask Sherlock to be best man, he had thought it a somewhat risky question to ask. With Sherlock’s highly vocal rejection of anything to do with tradition and emotion, the epitome of both of which is the wedding, John wouldn’t have put it past him to simply and blatantly refuse. And even when Sherlock did accept, John hadn’t exactly counted on him being willing to do very much at all in terms of planning the actual event. Which goes to show. John might be the one person to know Sherlock the best and the one person to appreciate Sherlock the most. And yet Sherlock somehow manages to continuously catch him off guard and either exceed all of his expectations or cause him to have a crisis of faith.
But then John’s arms are around him, soothing and strong and every bit as tangible and real as they’re supposed to be.
Sherlock will have sudden lapses of inattention. He will look out of the window with a vacant, unreadable expression as though he gets lost in his own thoughts. When disturbed, he will look as though he's been doused in ice water, snapping back to reality with a shock. What his thoughts concern, though, John has no idea. He isn’t sure how to properly classify the look on Sherlock’s face, if it’s longing, confusion, anger, sadness or even all of it at the same time.
Mary shifts slightly in her sleep, drawing attention to herself, and John catches himself sighing in annoyance. He knows, objectively speaking, that none of this is Mary’s fault. If anything, she reacted remarkably well to having their one romantic evening interrupted by a man she’s never even met before. Sherlock’s overly dramatic return to life had broken off John’s admittedly awkward proposal and then, of course, taken all of his attention on an evening that should have been about Mary only. Then she had been dragged from one restaurant to the next while Sherlock and John had argued as though
There’s a hesitance in his voice, as though he’s suddenly unsure of that fact. As though he might have misunderstood something, and they’ve actually known each other for considerably longer. As though he doesn’t trust his own brain at the moment.
A part of John’s brain picks up on the conversations of the people around them, surreally infiltrating from the outside world into this intimate conversation of theirs that John isn’t quite sure he knows or want to know the subject of.
“I can’t explain what it is. It’s not explainable. But there’s something familiar about looking at him.”
“And there he is.” When Mycroft speaks up, Sherlock loses focus and his eyes begin to drift again. John feels their loss of eye contact heavier than he ought to.
His hands are clasped so tightly around the chains that he has long since lost feeling in his fingers, the metal digging into the sensitive flesh of his palms. Distracting him. Grounding him. His senses are awry. He can’t see much, there’s blood in his eyes and he’s crouched forward anyway, eyes towards the ground. The only things he can taste are his own blood and saliva, neither of which is a taste he would like to dedicate any amount of consideration to. He really doesn’t want to smell more than what is unavoidable, the aroma in here is sickening. Blood, sweat, damp and mould in lovely combination. He could probably detect other scents as well if he tried, but what he is forced to smell on accident is enough to make him gag as it is. His sense of touch is completely off the table. He blocks out as much as possible by maintaining his grip on the chain. Stupid. A sentimental response that he objectively knows is more or less futile. Better than nothing though.
Sherlock’s brain is slow to gain momentum. It feels sleep-riddled and groggy, wrong somehow, as though Sherlock can’t quite remember how to use it. It should terrify him, but even the terror only seems to register as a vague blur, obscured behind miles and miles of cotton wool. Still he tries to push through, tries to focus on that voice, tries to register the sounds, tries to turn them into words. One word.
. John made it so that he couldn’t help but want it anyway. And when he wanted it, he couldn’t help but pursue it, and when he pursued it, everything that he had predicted came true.
The days go by. John doesn’t contact Sherlock and Sherlock deems it best not to contact John either. Maybe it’s better this way. Sherlock is well aware that his current lifestyle can’t be considered healthy by any stretch of the imagination: he’s either out and about with a criminal or cooped up in his own home, surviving on a by now week-old package of toast with jam and cheap fast-food from food vendors on the streets. Mrs. Hudson does come up with the ingredients for a pasta with gorgonzola sauce, apparently now resorting to doing Sherlock’s grocery shopping without his authorization, but Sherlock can’t be bothered to cook the pasta or heat the gorgonzola with the cream and prefers to just splatter some jam onto another piece of toast when he begins to feel hungry around 2 AM. At least he’s neither smoking nor using, which, all things considered, must be thought of as a minor miracle. He does feel an itch to indulge himself once or twice, perfectly understandable in light of his escapade following John’s wedding, but, overall, he shakes off his relapse with only minor incident and a very limited amount of discomfort on his part.
But they just have to cope with that. As they cope with a million other things. It is what it is. And what it is a beautiful thing that Sherlock can barely comprehend with his brain. But he feels it fully and wholly with his heart.
Sherlock is still stammering out a defeated “I don’t…” when John crosses the distance between them and kisses him with more passion than he’s ever kissed another person in all his life. Sherlock is pushed halfway back against the wall by the force of their collision.
His immediate gut reaction is that Sherlock has just cost him his marriage. He’d promised him, promised them both, that he’d always be there for them. He’d sworn an oath at their wedding. John’s first thought is to think that Sherlock has thoroughly and irreparably broken that promise. But then Sherlock never promised to keep them together. What he had promised was to always be there for them. And perhaps, by pointing out John’s reluctance to comply with Mary’s request and Mary’s reluctance to comply with his, that’s what he’s doing. He’s being there for them by not letting them make mistakes.
The first few days back at Baker Street are chaotic to say the least. Family, friends and (as Sherlock would have put it with all his usual tact and diplomacy)
Sherlock curls up tighter and wills time to go faster. He might be waiting for Moriarty to return first thing in the morning. He might be waiting to confirm his suspicion that Moriarty
Sherlock should fear him. He really should. The list of valid reasons to do so is long and terrifying enough to put anyone off. He’s the most dangerous criminal alive right now. Directly or indirectly, he’s been the cause of numerous disappearances and deaths, going back to when he was just a kid himself. He’s put John in a vest full of semtex and aimed snipers at both him and Sherlock on multiple occasions. It’s his fault Sherlock had to spend two years away from London. It’s his fault Sherlock had to suffer torture at the hands of a terrorist cell in Serbia, leaving permanent scars that cover most of his back. It’s his fault Sherlock had to leave John to grieve for two long years before he found someone else, leaving permanent scars covering most of Sherlock’s psyche, or what’s left of it anyway. That last one is the one that really hurts.
Sherlock isn’t looking at him anymore. He’s looking down, at the sofa table, at the floor, at his own socks on his feet pulled up underneath his body. There’s a hopeless reverence in his gaze, reminding John of some of the people he’s seen in church as a child. A sinner asking for forgiveness, hoping beyond hope despite not feeling as though he really deserves it.
If what Sherlock is now at last confiding in him is true, Sherlock is not only motivated by a need for mental stimulation and a constant search for novelty and excitement. He’s been searching for a way to eliminate his own feelings. It sounds preposterous to John’s ears, but then again, many things that shouldn’t actually be possible are possible where Sherlock is concerned. Sherlock doesn’t abide by the general laws of the universe. He makes his own rules. That aspect of him has always stood for a great deal of the attraction John feels towards him. But if it has hurt him, too… if it has caused him to believe that he might be better off not feeling anything at all, that he might be a better version of himself if he wasn’t quite as human… John can barely wrap his head around it, so wrong does it sound to his ears.
He opens his mouth to reply, to say what he knows he ought to say and what half of his brain is screaming at him to say.
And then there’s a rustling of leaves and branches around his feet and Sherlock is pulling him out and he’s shouting his name and cupping his face and John’s vision is still blurry but Sherlock’s face is about the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen in his life and that thought is said out loud in his head before he has time to stop it. Mary’s even blurrier face is registered only as an afterthought.
His inner monologue turns increasingly petulant as yet more time goes by. Which is not quite as annoying as it’s relieving, if only because it’s been quite a while since the last time he was able to successfully distinguish his own voice and thoughts from everything else happening in his mind. Still, he should probably send a text to John and ask him when he’s planning to show up. Just for good measure. Sherlock reaches a hand down to the floor, blindly searching for the shape of his phone and eventually withdrawing in triumph.
It’s not that John has some stupid, unrealistic expectation that everything will be unconditionally perfect and happy and easy from now on. God knows there are very few things in his and Sherlock’s lives that have ever been unconditionally perfect or happy, easy much less. There are things about Sherlock that John doesn’t like and he has no doubt that Sherlock feels the same way about him. There are things about Sherlock that John fears in a way, things he doesn’t understand and probably never fully will. From the information that Sherlock has been willing to share about what happened to him while he was unconscious, John has caught enough of a glimpse into Sherlock’s inner workings to understand that there are things in Sherlock that he will have to spend the rest of his life fighting to control. Just as John will have to carry his own guilt, his own failures and shortcomings, Sherlock will have to carry these other things that John isn’t even sure he understands the nature of. These are things about the both of them that John knows will cause problems for them in the future no matter how content they both feel at this moment.
Sherlock doesn’t comment. He’s all but collapsed. Evidently his last outburst has drained him completely of energy. But his thumb slowly moves onto John’s hand. Reciprocates.
He opens his mouth to speak, but then closes it again, presses his lips together and narrows his eyes. John raises an eyebrow inquisitively and yet he doesn’t speak. Then he turns and heads for the bedroom, the non-conversation apparently over before it even began. By the time John catches up with him, he’s already thrown himself on the bed and snuggled up deep beneath the duvet, his mop of dark curls the only visible evidence of his presence.
, for being so blunt and so determined that he should laundry all his most despicable secrets in front of her in this manner, before he’s ready and without his acceptance.
Sherlock seems to weigh his words, weigh his appearance and the look in his eyes. Then he leans forward and upwards, in between his own spread legs with astonishing grace and agility, to kiss John with such utter gentleness and care that John damn near feels his heart melt inside his ribcage. Slowly, Sherlock guides John’s hand in between his legs and places it at his entrance with clinical precision. There’s hardly a blush on his cheeks, though John feels his own face come alight.
Sherlock gathers his things almost in a trance and leaves. He’s heading straight for the one thing that can dull his emotions even in the direst of circumstances. To hell with the consequences.
expression plastered on his face as last time they met. Clearly Mycroft has been keeping a close eye on Sherlock’s state all this time and didn’t need John telling him what has happened. It should be annoying as all hell, and Sherlock would no doubt find it unbearably nosy and presumptuous were he awake to witness it, but still John can’t help but feel strangely warmed by the gesture on Sherlock’s behalf, a rare glimpse of a brotherly love that both participants would undoubtedly deny with their dying breath if ever questioned directly about it.
as though he is and it most certainly doesn’t give him the satisfaction that it used to. Just the danger and anxiety and sleepless nights, the need for a drink and the stiffness in his legs and shoulders. The fear that Sherlock might not make a narrow escape the next time there is a close call. The heartache.
“How does it make you feel, Ice Man? Even you must have a heart somewhere in there, I suppose. You’ve held your own little brother back all these years. Talked him down over and over. Told him that he was just a stupid, scared little boy who couldn’t hold a candle to you. Repeated it again and again. Until he forgot that it was a lie.”
This is not the same as Sherlock’s silence or the ghost of his drug abuse or whether or not he loved Irene Adler. This is not some personal aspect of Sherlock’s past that John feels he needs to know but knows that he doesn’t. This is not some part of Sherlock’s inner world that John has no right to demand knowledge of and must instead resign himself to only being able to glimpse on occasion. This is actual, physical trauma on the actual, physical body of his best friend which has been kept a secret from him for at least a year.
It has taken John two years to do this, to go back to the cemetery, to make the decision to move on. He doubts if he should have done it if not for Mary. She deserves better than what he has given her so far. She deserves better than being relegated to the side-lines on a constant basis, taking turns being cane, therapist and friend. Mary has listened to everything he has needed to say during the last months, but never once has she talked to him about her own past. She says she prefers it that way, but it just makes John feel the more guilty for taking advantage of her listening ear without being able to offer her his in return. She deserves better and he’s determined to give her that. Moving on from Sherlock seems to be the only way, so that’s what he’s going to do. Or try to do at the very least.
With much trouble and plenty of curse words, John makes it into the hallway and painstakingly begins to ascend the stairs. It says a lot about his level of experience with Sherlock that he doesn’t even attempt to shout for help, but just takes care of what needs to be done as well as he’s able to on his own. Using his elbow to push down on the handle and his right foot to nudge the door open, John enters the living room, groceries balanced precariously in his arms.
The mind palace is meant to be a memory technique. A mental landscape for Sherlock to move through in order to locate information. It isn’t meant to affect him physically and it isn’t meant to take any effort to get out of. Although Sherlock emerges himself on a much more fundamental level than what you’re generally advised to do, he’s not completely dislocated from his own body while in the mind palace. He’s always aware that what he’s seeing is not real. He’s always aware, however faintly, of what’s going on around his real body. Which is to say that Sherlock is always aware that he isn’t actually locked in anywhere and can just open his eyes whenever he feels like it. Primary conclusion: The mind palace is still functioning accordingly and everything is under control despite a failure to properly locate and fix the leakage. Secondary conclusion: How exactly he just managed to experience claustrophobia in his own mind palace is a bit unclear at present.
Somehow, John must have registered his momentary lapse in attention, because his eyes take on a softer glow and his hand comes up to caress Sherlock’s cheek.
As soon as that thought crosses his mind, Sherlock feels himself tense up in concern. Is his brain not able to make deductions? Is it because of what’s happening to and in his body? Wasn’t that what Jim had promised? That he could get his brain to control his body rather than the other way around? Does that mean that there is something wrong with him after all, that he isn’t able to do what Jim does? Sherlock’s breath accelerates, but this time it has nothing to do with excitement.
Mary is right. She is, in fact, right. She sees what John hasn’t been able (or willing) to see: that with all that John has done in the past weeks, this is their last chance.
In Denmark, where I live, Christmas is traditionally celebrated on Christmas Eve (the 24th, in the evening), while the 23th is known as "Little Christmas Eve". The 25th is known as "First Christmas Day", but you don't really do anything special, you just stay at home with your family and eat good food. Presents are opened on the evening of the 24th.
understand, but he’s gone now. Because of Sherlock. He let him down. He willed him away, and away he went. Now there is no one to confide in, no one to share with, no one to understand. But it’s a situation Sherlock has brought upon himself, so there’s no point in sitting here wallowing in self-pity. It’s all his own fault. If he’d been a little stronger, a little more determined, a little less of an emotional, shrivelling mess, he could have walked out of this with everything he had worked for. Everything he had gambled his life, his health and his sanity on. But he couldn’t do it. He couldn’t do it and he’ll not get a second chance.
“Come on, now,” Jim whispers into his ear, arm curled around him like a snake. “Ask me for help and I will help you. One little word, Sherlock. One little word and it’s all over.” He sounds so reassuring. As though all of this is alright, as though he isn’t asking Sherlock to… to…
Weirdly, Sherlock finds himself blushing. He doesn’t do that very often and certainly not like this, sitting fully dressed in the living room with Rosie in his lap and Mrs. Hudson on the couch. John notices, of course he does, and his smile deepens impossibly further before he has to return to the punch.
But Sherlock’s eyes are still on him and John knows full well what that means. He’s deduced that there’s a continuation coming and he’s letting John know. But he’s content to wait for John to continue on his own rather than offer him any assistance. Christ, John hates that particular trick of his.
There is an ease between them that hasn’t been there in ages. A sense that they don’t have to stop and think before speaking to each other, don’t have to consider every little word before it comes out. Sherlock is moping around all day in his various dressing gowns, complaining of boredom, and yet, when John makes a suggestion for something they might do to relieve said boredom (play a game, watch a movie, make a shopping list), he inevitably and vehemently turns John's proposal down, claiming that he doesn’t have time for it. John will turn out dish after dish in the hope of getting Sherlock to eat more than a couple of bites and even sit through his rather long-winded complaints about the pain of having to waste energy on digestion for the sake of getting him to finish what's on his plate.
Neither John nor Sherlock has ever really tried to define what it is they have. At some point, the term colleague was replaced with friend. Then friend was thrown aside with no new definition taking its place. John wishes fiercely that they could talk about these things, especially now. But Sherlock isn’t one to discuss his thoughts, especially not now apparently and, as always, especially not when feelings are concerned. John can almost hear him say it –
It’s in the cab on the way to Baker Street that Sherlock starts to talk. It takes John by surprise at first – Sherlock has been mostly silent for so many days now and only spoken when he hasn’t been able to communicate nonverbally through scoffs, looks and gestures that John had simply assumed that he wasn’t capable of speaking with greater complexity just yet. Indeed, he’s been silent for the first five minutes of their trip, looking out of the window on his side of the cab at the city passing by outside without making any attempt at contact. His voice catches John off guard.
Sherlock clamps down on his lower lip with enough force to turn it white. He seems almost embarrassed. Perhaps he
Not that Sherlock says so. He’s actually on his best behaviour, even accepting a visit from Mycroft on the second day. His welcome wears thin rather quickly and Sherlock ends up pointing him in the direction of the door with as much fury in his eyes as he’s capable of mustering after about a quarter of an hour, but it’s still a valiant effort on both their parts. Mycroft’s concern for his brother is genuine, even if he has a strange and predictably counterintuitive way of showing it. It’s just one of nature’s mysteries. Mycroft Holmes may be one of the most intelligent men in Britain, but when it comes to dealing with his own little brother, he seems incapable of putting peace, quiet and family concern above his bloody stupid superiority complex. Why exactly he needs to meticulously step on every landmine available to him is beyond John, especially when he surely must be knowledgeable enough about Sherlock’s inner workings to be able to predict his reactions as well as (and likely much better than) John.
But that someone else… John had been secured to a chair and Sherlock had stood before him as his judge, but the executioner had been behind him. In the shadows, obscured, holding a gun to the back of his head. Sherlock hadn’t thought much of that person at the time, wholly consumed as he had been by the horror of what he believed to be his reality. He’d barely been able to see more of the figure than that hand on the gun and he hadn’t cared about the identity of the figure at all at the time.
“Find anything interesting?” When Mary is this close, her perfume mixes with all the familiar scents from Baker Street, cigarettes and tea and various chemical odours from Sherlock's experiments. It doesn't really go well together.
, and I left anyway. I know you asked me to, I know Mary asked me to and it seemed reasonable enough at the time, but I
Not that it’s a regular occurrence anymore. The first three to four months, barely a week went by that John didn’t spend at least a day curled up in what was more or less the foetal position although he still has trouble acknowledging that to himself. By now, after two years, John has painstakingly brought his number of bad days down to once every two to three months. But today looks like an obvious candidate.
“I have to go soon or I’ll be late for Cath. Did you want that lift?” Mary gives his hand a slight squeeze, urging him towards the car almost unnoticeably. Perfectly understandable. Mary knows John well enough by now to understand that this is definitely a danger night. Just as John knows Mary well enough by now to understand that she is urging him towards accepting her offer of a lift to spare him the humiliation of having his possibly ensuing meltdown in public. Although they both pretend that Mary is ignorant of the sometimes quite violent things that John gets up to in the privacy of his own flat when he is alone, they both know that she understands perfectly well that “dropped” means “hurled” and that John leaving the clinic early doesn’t indicate a general rise in health levels.
Jim sounds genuinely exasperated, but it isn’t difficult for the world’s only consulting detective to detect an edge of humour interlaced in his tone.
! He had been right in feeling that neither a therapist, a girlfriend or a marriage could make him into John Watson again. He had been right in feeling that only Sherlock bloody Holmes could make him whole again.
Rosie is looking gleefully at the snow falling all around them, reaching her small hands up in an attempt to catch one of the snowflakes. She’s wearing mittens. Big, obnoxiously red and with only the thumb separated from the other fingers. Along with her equally big and obnoxiously red scarf and hat, she’s looking every bit a Christmas fairy come to life (John’s opinion – Sherlock will be the first to admit that she does look very sweet as she lowers her hand to her face to get a closer look at a snowflake and promptly melts it with her warm breath, but to actually say that she looks like a Christmas fairy is just a little too sickeningly joyous, ugly-Christmas-sweater-and-fake-antler-headband-y for his tastes).
Mary nods in return. “I had my suspicions. I always have.” She hesitates for a second, but no more. “You love him,” she states flatly, listing it off as matter of fact. “You love him. You loved him before you met me and if you’d known he was still alive then, you wouldn’t have committed yourself to someone else. I would have been just another temporary girlfriend you could use to ward off some sexual frustration and dispel your own anxieties about your sexual identity.” All of this said with perfect clarity, without as much as a blink of the eye.
) closest friends. John even phones Mycroft, though the call doesn’t go through. Then he slumps down in his by now rather worn and increasingly uncomfortable hospital chair, settling back to his vigil by Sherlock’s bedside with more peace of mind than he’s felt since Sunday (

It’s only then that Sherlock turns to him. They lock eyes, but his expression is unreadable. Deliberately kept so.
Perhaps with all this focus on the parts of Sherlock’s body usually unavailable for public perusal (and John
“I can’t come home right now, Mary. I wish I could, really I do. And I’m sorry about it all. I’m sorry about the timing, with the wedding and all. But no matter what, it’s not alright, staying here with him without properly explaining why. It’s not fair. And it’s… it’s not acceptable. And I’m sorry. But it doesn’t change my decision.” John pauses for the briefest of moments, swallowing a wave of regret and crushing an urge to just stop speaking.
“Don’t go. Don’t go, John. I know I said… I want it to be your decision, I swear I do, and I’ll let you go if that’s what you want, but please… don’t go, John!” He presses his lips together. “I want you to stay. I want it to be like it was. Only better. I want to do it right this time, just like you said. I want that. I don’t think I’ve ever wanted anything as much as I want that!”
. It doesn’t even return to it’s former, more or less tolerable level. It just subsides enough for Sherlock to regain his footing. His awareness of his physical body diminishes as he slips fully back into his mind palace once again. His first action is to take a step back towards the door, infused with an overwhelming desire to just run away and lock, lock, lock the door on this whole floor. Forget about water leakages and damp and puddles and noise and all of it. Emotional response. Impulse. Sherlock hurries to suppress it.
Which is perhaps what’s at the centre of all this confusion. John doesn’t know what it means. Not Sherlock’s disappearance, not Sherlock’s reappearance, not those looks, not how it makes John feel, not any of it.
John pours himself the last few drops of punch. It’s thin, watered down and low in alcohol, but it’s better than nothing.
But none of those people were John. None of them were the object of his love and desire the way John is, the centre of his universe for years and the primary occupier of his thoughts. Not even Jim - brilliant, mysterious, sensual Jim - ever managed to catch and hold Sherlock’s interest the way John has. Jim was like a drug: endlessly stimulating, endlessly addictive, intoxicating because he knew it was dangerous. Jim boosted his self-esteem, made him feel invincible, but only for that short moment before the inevitable crash. John is like a band aid: ordinary and unexciting by comparison, chronically underestimated and underappreciated. Silently but persistently keeping him together, refusing to let him fall apart. Refusing to offer the initial high that Jim could, but all the stronger for it. Not offering him an escape from reality into a utopian but ultimately hollow facsimile.
Sherlock looks at Jim one last time. His enemy, his rival, his opposite, his negative. The person who made him leave everything he cared about behind for two long years so that nothing was as it should be when he returned. The person who indirectly had him tortured, who caused scars on Sherlock’s back that will never go away. The person who threatened not only Sherlock himself, but the people he most cares about. He threatened them, again and again. But he did it to force Sherlock to come face to face with his emotions. Because Jim might be his opposite and negative, but he is also the only person who ever truly understood.
In contrast to the blurred, surreal memories of his first days in hospital, the final moments he’d spent in his own head are horrifyingly vivid. He’d been at what he’d thought was Battersea Power Station. Jim had brought him there. He’d wanted to test him. And Sherlock had thought that he would do anything for Jim, be anything he wanted, but he’d asked for the one thing Sherlock couldn’t give him. He’d asked for John. And Sherlock hadn’t been able to bring himself to do it. He hadn’t even been able to bring himself to give the order for someone else to do it.
John's life at present is one big mess of unanswered questions, glances, expressions, words and silences that he doesn’t understand. It’s frankly exhausting being as confused and unsure about everything as he’s been since that bloody kiss and it doesn’t seem to get better as the days pass. On the contrary, phone calls from Mary and seemingly random acts of intimacy from Sherlock make everything increasingly complex and difficult to figure out.
his heart, and not feel as though one was eating away at the other. Just for that too-short, 16-month period, he’d felt like one complete human being. Sherlock had felt
understand. But if only... if he knew about it, all of it, if Sherlock tried to give him access, tried to explain, about Jim and Mycroft and Battersea Power Station and what it all meant and how he's now in this body that doesn't feel like
Then he makes the fatal mistake of opening his mouth. “I love her,” he says, meaning it almost as a kind of confirmation to himself. A reminder that he does love Mary, a reminder that’s sorely needed because of how overwhelmingly intense his feelings for Sherlock are in this moment. But of course Sherlock doesn’t hear it in that way. Instead he runs a hand over John’s hair, lightly, afraid to use too much pressure, as though he might better be able to deny his actions if he doesn’t use any force.
Sherlock reaches for the cup almost as soon as John has placed it within easy reach and takes a sip, but there’s no response to John’s questions and he drinks the tea in utter silence, eyes looking straight ahead unseeingly. It would be more unnerving if this wasn’t Sherlock, who regularly falls into reverential silence with a noise tolerance at zero. It’s nothing too out of the ordinary, at least not
Sherlock actually looks... unsure. Unsure of the answer. To this most basic of questions that John had almost meant to be rhetorical. The stupid,
a physical attraction. If it had just been physical, John probably could have put it all down to PTSD and an identity crisis in the wake of his time in Afghanistan. Just a couple of odd erections and inappropriate fantasies about a flatmate every once in a while, that’s quite normal. John is a doctor, he knows about these things. But he also knows that this is not the case here. Not when it’s all taken together. There are too many clues so to speak, all pointing in the same direction. If Sherlock could hear him now, he would say that the conclusion is inescapable. An admiration for Sherlock’s intellect and a fondness for Sherlock’s personality, that can be friendly. Platonic. But a physical desire for Sherlock? A look that lingers too intensely on his lips or a hand that stays too long on his shoulder? Jealousy in the face of competition, regardless of his own relationship status? A certain disinterest towards anyone else when Sherlock is in the room? That’s not just a physical thing, a strange anomaly in his sexuality.
and suddenly everything is alright and back to normal. Far from it. John isn’t in a forgiving mood. Right now, he isn’t even sure if he wants to see Sherlock again at all. The hurt is still too raw and Sherlock definitely didn’t seem repentant enough for John to even consider forgiving him. More as though this whole thing has been one gigantic joke and he doesn’t understand why John isn’t laughing. No, John definitely isn’t feeling as though the last two years don’t matter. In fact, he seriously doubts whether it will ever be alright, whether he and Sherlock can ever go back to how it used to be or whether the mere sight of Sherlock will be enough to set off all this hurt again and again for the rest of John’s life.
Maybe John says it out loud. Maybe it’s just reflected back and forth in his brain like an ear-splitting echo, loud enough for him to imagine that he’s hearing it said out loud.
The speech itself is an exercise in self-inflicted torture. Speaking to a room full of people who are actually listening while also speaking to himself in at least three separate voices does not go well together and Sherlock absently wonders if his desire to self-ignite is as palpable to everyone else as it is to him. On the other hand, John is here, John is listening and Sherlock is finally given just a bit of that attention that he won’t admit to needing. Seeing John smile, even look visibly touched by some of what Sherlock is saying… that’s good. His inner monologue falls into the background for just a moment. John’s arm around him as they awkwardly hug in public is enough to ground him, even if it’s just a momentary relief.
Mary is his wife, but Sherlock is his best friend, so what of it? Sherlock had looked almost happy when he had finally accepted John’s proclamations. His lips had drawn up in a small smile, there had been a slight wrinkling at the corners of his eyes and he’d looked at John in that rare, soft way of his that John has never quite figured out how to properly respond to.
It’s quiet. The kind of quiet that makes it seem as though the particles have frozen into place, refusing to carry any sound to him. He fancies he can hear his own heartbeat, feel its steady push-pull in his chest. Perhaps that’s a good thing, but its effect on him is unsettling. It feels wrong somehow, as though it’s not really his own heart. It’s a fleshy muscle that isn’t his, push-pulling within a cavity in a chest that isn’t his, sending blood through veins that aren’t his either. An organic mechanic to keep a body alive, but that body is not
“Why did you bring me here?” is what he asks, though a thousand other questions wish to manifest themselves on his lips.
The combined guilt of neglect, adultery and confusion is slow to settle, but damning when it does. He truly is a rotten person. Everything he’s done, every step he’s taken, they all seemed perfectly reasonable in the moment, and every decision he’s made seemed justified when he made it, each decision built on the ones that came before it. But when all of it is taken together, there really is no excuse. He’s acted atrociously, mostly to Mary, but to Sherlock as well. What he’s put Mary through, what he’s still putting her through, is frankly unforgivable. Leading Sherlock on, encouraging him to step increasingly out of his comfort zone, when John is married and unwilling to change that, all for the sake of John’s own gratification… it’s repulsive at best and sickening at worst.
“I do. I can do that sometimes, you know, make deductions.” John smiles disarmingly. “It just only works on people I’m close to.”
But then again... this is not just any surveillance visit. Sherlock is not alone up there. He’s with Jim Moriarty, as he has been for the past several days. He invited Moriarty there himself. He’s locked himself up with his worst enemy. How Sherlock could have decided to do so mad a thing… Mycroft may know his brother almost better than Sherlock knows himself, but he’s never been particularly good at understanding his brother’s behaviour when Sherlock is not using his brain to make the decisions and this is one such time. Mycroft can understand his brother as far as the temptation for an increased intellect goes. What Moriarty is telling him to do – enhance his faculties of deduction by eradicating the brunt of those pesky
Everything that Sherlock has ever wanted and here it is. He feels something twist and turn deep within and suddenly has to fight back an irrational impulse to cry.
So... Here we are at last. It took a long, long time to get here and I'm so grateful to everyone who's still following this story and who's been so patient up until this point. I've certainly been looking forward to it myself. We're not at the end yet, there are still quite a few chapters to go, but now at least it's... happening.
He doesn’t look as though he’s able to reply. But then again, maybe he doesn’t have to. As soon as the words leave John’s mouth, he remembers that, yes, perhaps Sherlock
One moment, Sherlock is lying  in bed, every bit as motionless as normal. It’s nearing eleven o’clock and most visitors have left the hospital by now. There’s a hush over the hallway and John is settling in for another night by Sherlock’s bedside, overtired and anxious, but otherwise enjoying the temporary peace and quiet.
Every sense is working on overdrive. The smell of gasoline seems to burn its way through his nose. Distant laughter sounds almost like an approaching thunderstorm. Then there’s the sound of a match being struck quite nearby followed a second later by a bright flare directly to his left. John shouts then, truly shouts. Forces the air from his lungs and out of his throat. But it’s just too little too late and the sound he does manage to produce is completely overpowered by the roar of the flames. Within a matter of seconds, it’s uncomfortably hot, and though his sight is still blurry from whatever drugs are in his system, the glare of the fire approaching is unmissable. The roar of the flames drums in his ears.
Sherlock has been in hospital a full three days now. His brain is processing. He’s not brain dead. He’s just… not conscious. And there’s nothing the doctors can do. There’s nothing anyone can do other than wait and hope for Sherlock to just… decide to wake up, apparently.
choice, irrespective of morals? Haven’t they been here before, many, many times, and each time chosen to walk away? How was that good for anything? How did it make anything better, easier, less complicated? It just postponed a conversation they should have had after knowing each other for a week and now here they are, three years down the line, and their mutual muteness is tearing John apart all over again.
Eventually Sherlock nods, once. Then he looks at John, smiles in that same manner of joking-but-not, and asks with complete sincerity yet not without a hint of teasing: “Would you die content, then?”
Sherlock does not look good. Mycroft has seen his brother in almost every state, from stone cold sober to high as a kite and from fiercely healthy to decidedly not. But this is different. It’s not the manic energy, erratic breathing and excited stare of the cocaine. It’s not the overpowering lethargy, deep sighs and drooping eyes of the heroin. It’s not the shaking, unstable mess of withdrawal. It’s not even the nervous, fidgeting excitement of too much caffeine after too many days with neither food nor water that Sherlock is given to subjecting his body to during particularly intense cases. His eyes do carry a hint of the maniacal over-excitement of cocaine and his mouth, currently curled into the beginnings of a smirk, has inklings of a euphoric sense of invincibility. But there’s an intelligence and determination to his eyes that exclude the possibility of any chemical drug.
“Living somewhere near Lodge Road. They’ve just taken up the pavement. Very distinctive clay. My analysis is on the website.”
What to do? This is evidently proving to be a far more complex problem than he initially judged it to be. He’d thought that most of the damage inflicted on his mind palace over the last couple of years had gotten under control again. Well... hypothesis unsustainable.
They still haven’t talked about Sherlock’s time abroad. Sherlock himself hasn’t brought it up again and John doesn’t feel like it’s his place to ask. But he doesn’t seem capable of stopping his thoughts from returning to it, over and over and over again, thinking, wondering and imagining. Spinning all sorts of nightmares out of the scant information Sherlock has been willing to provide him with. The only perk John can think of is that if and when Sherlock does eventually decide to tell him about it, at least it seems unlikely that whatever he will say can possibly be worse than what John has already been imagining. The things he’s seen play out before his inner eye in graphic slow motion the past couple of days are bound to be worse than the truth.
It’s hesitant and a little bit clumsy, both of them way out of their comfort zones. At first, John is so concerned for Sherlock’s safety that he can barely register how he himself is feeling. He’s a doctor, so he’s taken every precaution, proceeding slowly and with the utmost of care. But
His eye is caught by a flash of pale skin to his lower right, just on the edge of his peripheral vision. His brain hardly has time to register what he’s looking at before he has already crossed the room and knelt by Sherlock’s side, lifting his body from the floor. A needle falls out of his dressing gown sleeve when John turns him over. His eyes are closed.
How many times hasn’t he tried to imagine what this would feel like? How many times hasn’t he mentally rehearsed the entirety of a standard wedding reception to prepare himself for the ordeal? Sherlock took the pain he felt then as a good sign, a sign that he would already have experienced the worst of it by the time he entered the church so he wouldn’t have to sit here like he does now. The exposed nerve in a broken tooth, laid bare for all the world to see and utterly defenceless against whatever pain is coming his way.
John had already opened his mouth to ask, to demand an explanation, but now he closes it again. Sherlock already knows what John’s complaint would be. Of course he bloody does.
be understood. That he isn’t fully human or at least that he doesn’t operate on the same terms as the rest of us. Sometimes… sometimes I fall back on the explanations that other people make. That he’s different because there’s a problem with him somehow, because he used to be an addict or because he suffers from some kind of mental anomaly. Sometimes when he does or says something that is… well… not good… I mean, it’d be so easy to be angry with him. To ask how the hell he can justify his words or actions to himself, especially where the people concerned are people he actually seems to care about. I mean… I’d like to think that he actually does care about me, yet it didn’t really seem to be an issue for him when he deliberately drugged me and then locked me in a lab just so he could analyse the effects of the drug in a controlled environment, now did it?”
Eventually Sherlock is the one to do it. He gets up from the couch, huddling slightly forward as he’s taken to doing recently when his energy reserves are running low, and makes for his bedroom. For a few horrible seconds, John fears that he might simply disappear into his room and close the door and let that be the end of it, putting them back to square one. But Sherlock turns to him when he’s halfway through the door.
But then again, Rosie’s status as the single most marvellous child yet bestowed upon mankind is close to a scientific fact. Sherlock can't honestly say he doesn't feel 100% justified in his assertion of her superiority in comparison to the children of all the other doting parents.
! He used to despise people for what he had considered oversentimentality at the time. He’s so much worse than any of them now. He can feel it cloying his mind, weighing down his brain with useless thoughts devoid of logic that can’t possibly lead to any solution. He remembers his words of three years ago to Irene Adler – “I’ve always believed that love is a dangerous disadvantage. Thank you for the final proof” – and almost laughs bitterly at the realisation that the supposed final proof was not enough to keep him from repeating her mistakes.
Sherlock looks at him. Listens. Tries to understand. But it’s like trying to make a puzzle with half the pieces: you might be able to decipher the general subject depicted, but it’s not a very satisfying picture to look at and it’s difficult to imagine the parts you’re missing. And Sherlock is fairly certain he’s missing several key pieces.
The ten minutes or so from Mrs. Hudson calls 999 to the ambulance arrives feel like the longest ten minutes of John’s life. It’s worse than at Bart’s. As much as Sherlock throwing himself from the roof had made John’s world turn upside down, as much as his body hitting the ground had echoed in John’s ears for hours afterwards, as much as his blood slowly filling up the cracks between the tiles had provided fuel for John’s nightmares for years to come… as soon as Sherlock hit the pavement, it had been obvious that nothing more could be done. That it was all too late. And as horrible as that realisation had been, at least it’s better than this. Better than sitting here with Sherlock in his arms, unable to help him in any way no matter how desperately he might need it. Better than knowing that something is fundamentally, horrendously wrong with him and that every second might be vital and
She giggles in what John takes to be relief as well and he inevitably finds himself joining in with her laughter, placing his arms around her and pulling her into a firm embrace. Her arms come up to wrap around his neck, her fingers protruding into his hair and caressing the back of his head. She exhales loudly, turning the sound into a placating hum as she cups his scalp.
And it’s true that attempting it is likely very dangerous. Not only is the actual process completely obscure. How could he know how to alter the way his brain works? How does one go about repressing one’s own emotions, subduing them beneath a stone cold logic? Sherlock is feeling his way through this. The irony of which is not lost on him. But the real concern is the final result. If he should succeed, what he will end up with is completely unpredictable. Does Mycroft really believe he does not understand what Moriarty is – a genius mind turned into an unstoppable, uncontrollable force because of a lack of respect for human moral and empathy, answerable to no one but himself? Does Mycroft really believe he does not realise he could end up just like that – or worse? Does Mycroft really believe he does not have the brain to fear what he would be if he was nothing
Sherlock shrugs slightly. He doesn’t appear nearly as affected by this as John, but his reluctance to discuss the closer circumstances is tangible. “I rushed through a procedure to break into their computer systems that usually took me about a week in less than two days. It wasn’t particularly well thought out, but it did actually work up to a point, so… Well, I got what I came for and sent the necessary information to Mycroft, but I hadn’t been able to secure my connection as well as I had the other times. They realised something was wrong. I ran, they pursued…” Sherlock shrugs again, seeming almost a little ashamed. “I got about one and a half miles outside the facility before they caught up with me.”
reminiscent of how it used to be – Sherlock and John, Baker Street, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade and Molly and idiot police officers and tea and solving cases and working things out – and yet, somehow, it’s completely different. Mary is here now, most of the time. She lets them go out and solve cases on their own, to John’s extremely private relief. But she stops by more often than not in the afternoon. Sherlock seems to agree with her presence, which is surprising to say the least. Sherlock is against new people. That’s what he’s always said. He prefers to see the same faces around him every day. For a man as averse to redundancy, routine and established rules as Sherlock, he does live his life following certain habits. The people around him seem to become habits for him as well, a touch of stability to draw comfort from in his otherwise quite unruly and impulsive life.
John isn't a religious man, but he has made exceptions once or twice before in his life and this is one of those moments where John feels as though an exception is warranted.
But when John says it, it sounds so wrong. It sounds as though he’s proclaiming himself a failure or a fake and Sherlock won’t stand for that. John is not a fake. He’s the sincerest, most genuine, most complex human being Sherlock has ever encountered. Just the simple fact that John continues to find new and exciting ways to surprise and baffle Sherlock, despite Sherlock feeling as though he’s known him forever, is a testament to that innate sincerity and complexity. John is honestly simple and honestly deep, wears his feelings on his sleeve and speaks his mind without a second’s hesitation and yet buries his innermost self so deeply that even
John smiles gratefully, but Sherlock is so captivated by his eyes that he only registers the change of expression in a slight raising of the skin beneath them. They sit like that for a moment, a strange atmosphere in the room and a strange charge in the air between them. It has felt something like this before, those times they’ve ending up sharing a kiss, but it’s somehow different this time. More at stake. A sense of decision. Consequence.
Banishing John from his mind takes more effort than Sherlock would like to admit. But John has no place in this moment, not as Jim’s fingers slide along his jaw and takes hold of his chin, forcing his head further back and his pulse higher up.
But that’s what happens in serious relationships, isn’t it? You begin interacting with people as a couple. You meet new people together and your old friends become common friends. A shift in the dynamic of previous friendships should come as no surprise. It’s normal, isn’t it? Healthy even.
John swallows, suddenly conscious of how many times he’s already done that within the past few minutes. It’s a nervous reflex.
Mary isn’t about to let him have it though. She reaches out for Sherlock with her left hand, running it down his arm. “And what about you?”
His mind isn’t what it used to be. Before he met John, Sherlock’s mind was like an impenetrable fortress filled with useful information and very little else. A first rate archive behind several layers of protection. Whatever emotions, impulses and disturbing memories were there were locked away deep within, ready to be accessed at a moment’s notice should he wish to do so but effectively stored away and unable to impede his everyday life. But John, it seems, has been chipping away at those defences bit by bit through the years. Slowly exposing those pent-up emotions hidden inside and eating away at the very foundations of his mind palace. Yet now, with his defences eroded to the point of an imminent collapse, John seems to have abandoned him. His emotions laid bare, his defensive walls in ruin, his heart exposed… and now he’s like a card house waiting to fall with the next gush of wind. An iceberg about to roll over.
