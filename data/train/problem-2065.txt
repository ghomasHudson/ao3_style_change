When he is clean, he turns to Jim and watches him. The crime lord is only half hard, but he runs his eyes over Hamish like a prized horse.
They continue down in the same line formation, until the path opens into a large cavern. The air is filled with the steady drip drip of water. Stalactites line the ceiling, jagged lengths of ice and rock.
Weather it was moments or hours later, John wasn’t sure, but he woke up screaming, the Afghan desert fresh on his mind. He turned over, panting and sobbing, attempting to force air into his stubborn lungs. “Idiot,” John snarled to himself, how could he have bonded with Sherlock. The man was an amazingly brilliant detective; he didn’t need a half mad, damaged ex-soldier dogging his heels. God, his mum was right.
Sherlock stays silent for a long time, staring at John with an inscrutable gaze. “Yes,” he says, finally, “he’s strong. He’ll recover.”
John steps into the garden, eyes wide with wonder before confusion crosses his features. “Wait,” he murmurs, looking around. “It’s all green in December and warm?”
“I was worried about that.” Dr. Stapleton sighs loudly, running her hand through her hair. “His bite was much worse than yours, he has more venom in his system. It was a good idea to bring Henry, his plasma will speed things along. I’ll call you as soon as it’s ready, but it will still take some time.”
I also have started a few new stories, but I'm being good. I won't post them until I am done or almost done, so I don't mess you guys up with a two year wait again. If you are curious this is what I'm working on:
“Shh, don’t try and speak,” Don kneels at his side, leaning over so he is in John’s line of sight. “We are going to fix your leg, it
Gregson nodded, lips down turned in a fierce scowl. “One of our own; gunned down in his own living room.”
The next morning, they meet Navamas at the front of the hotel, her usual cheery disposition marred by a deep frown. “Good morning,” she greets, sounding weary.
Mrs. Hudson's brow furrows. “Well, yes, but that is a difficult bond to make, and you don’t have the head of the household here.”
Sherlock has been to the museum only once, four years earlier. They had taken a family trip into London, and Mycroft had volunteered to show Sherlock around since neither of them had been much interested in shopping. When they had stopped outside the museum, Sherlock had complained, having little interest in antiquities, until Mycroft had showed him the special exhibit on pirates through history. He shoves the memory away, there is a case on, no time for sentiment.
“There is nothing wrong with you except for your inconsideration with your own health,” Lestrade says, the bite to his words softened with affection.
John, sensing Mycroft’s gaze, looks up and shoots him a wry grin. “Well, we didn’t get much information, but we also didn’t get eaten.”
Downstairs, Sherlock was reading the paper and sipping a cup of tea. While he was wearing a burgundy dress shirt, he had rolled up the sleeves to show his own mark.
Mycroft’s arranged meeting place is an old apartment building, long since condemned. Sherlock shimmies in through a couple of loose boards over a broken window. The place smells of mold and mildew, but under that is the greasy scent of noodles.
Baskerville is the badly kept secret of the London Underground. The Cops know it exists, but can’t get anything to stick on Moriarty since he is rarely ever there.
The helicopter landed a few yards away, far enough, that the men struggled to bring their wounded aboard.
Sherlock knew his lung was collapsing, knew his mate was bleeding out in the desert while these imbeciles did nothing.
If Sherlock was less posh, he’d be spitting. “Don’t be an idiot. Why that spell? Why that mixture? What made him step past the safety circle? But no, it’s too much effort to exercise your atrophied brains, let’s just call it an accident and be done.”
With the room empty, Sherlock sits on the bed. He lingers there for awhile, debating, before laying beside John. He doesn’t slip under the covers. The bed smells of stale sweat and sickness, but he curls against John’s warm form, and finally lets himself relax.
There is a burning heat sparking against his waist, and Harihara is flung back with a scream. Coils ripped from his body and allowing him to breath. He sits up slowly, head pounding and eyes still fuzzy. He dips his hand into the pocket of his waistcoat and pulls out the glowing form of his pocket watch. The gold is shimmering, the rune work bright with power. The metal feels warm and alive in his hand.
Hamish made himself stay still as Jim sat on his chest, basically pinning him to the bed. Not that Hamish couldn’t break the skinny Irishman like a twig, but it was a vulnerable position.
Breaking into the house was another challenge. Circumventing alarms had never been a specialty of his, even if he could pick most locks within 60 seconds.
“That was a waste of time. We didn’t learn anything new.” John growls, irritated as they make the long walk back to the hotel.
Sally moves to gleefully complete the order, but Sherlock has one last tidbit to add. “You’ll find the powder in Mrs. William’s house, and check the bottom of the mug for residue. When you find I’m right I will be at 221B Baker Street.” With that, the man sweeps out of the crime scene as quickly as he had appeared.
The Sculptor’s Guild is in Shoreditch, nestled in a renovated theater house. There’s no real sign, just the emblem of the crossed hammer and chisel that has represented the Sculptors for millennia.
It was strange to go down stairs and there be absolutely no one in the house. He took sometime hacking into the computer system to go through Moriarty’s files, but the man kept most things in his own mind. The files he did find, he sent off to Mycroft through a complicated combination of proxy servers and codes.
“Naw,” Hamish drawled, shrugging in his over-priced jacket. He took a sip of his own scotch, it was his third sip and he was certain the drink was getting worse.
He nodded. “They gave me an honorable discharge, though the paperwork lists something ridiculous like ‘physical trauma’. Killing the man with my teeth would have been distasteful, but not enough to get me discharged. It was the mess I made getting back to my unit that got me kicked out.”
“That is everything for now, all the other essentials; tickets, mission, and funds will come from Agent Smith or Agent Moneypenny,” Q says, ineffectively pulling the mess of papers on his desk into a pile.
This time it was John’s turn to scowl, “I’ll keep my eyes open, I promise. Oh and ‘Crimson’ for 3 down.”
The man grunts, pushing with both hands against the knife even as his bandaged fingers start to drip blood.
Murray blatantly ignores the tone. “Come on, this is America, we don’t keep our metals all secretly tucked away. How are you supposed to find your match if you don’t let anyone see it?”
The man doesn’t notice him, until John has his arm around his throat and is pulling him away from Helios.
“Ah Molly,” Sherlock interrupts them, stepping cleanly between the two. “I haven’t introduced you two yet,” he beckons towards John, and his soldier slots himself into the open arm. “This is my bondmate Dr. John Watson.”
It is the movement that draws Sherlock’s attention to the black mark he can see peeking from the sleeve, and instantly he feels like a colossal idiot. “Henry,” Sherlock barks, harsher than he intends.
Sherlock cuts him off. “Tomorrow, you are having coffee with me. Downstairs there is a local cafe, their tea is horrendous but they make a passable coffee.”
Two of Moriarty’s regular goons forced open the door and cleared the way. Hamish was pleased to never have to do this; his time in the Army had left him with a great distaste for building clearing. As always, he followed behind Moriarty. He was armed with a Browning, but kept his hands at his sides, not touching the weapon, but ready to draw at a moments notice.
The man’s eyes widened in surprise, then narrowed as he flicked his mercurial gaze over Lestrade’s form like reading a book. “ You’ve had an experience with mythical daemons before.”
Molly bites her lip and steps to the bottom of the table. There is a tag tied to Soo Lin’s toe, her information written in doctor’s scrawl. “When I was doing my initial review I noticed this.” She pulls the untagged foot back so the heel is displayed.
Lestrade opens his mouth to either protest or explain, but Mycroft cuts in. “I have no doubt that you can handle London, I’m less certain if London can handle you.”
The Guardian is a massive sea serpent with dark scales like an oil slick and grey spines flared about it’s head and neck. It screeches, the sound deafening, as it rears its head back and unhinges its jaw wide enough to swallow a bus whole.
“She isn’t feeling well, but he said he’d help her if I brought him a daemon. They also die so quickly, but yours is special. I think he’ll like her,” the man grins, holding up a wicked looking knife.
It could easily be Mike’s forgotten lunch, but when he unscrews the top, the thermos gives a hiss of released pressure. Cool fog from dry ice escapes the seal as John pulls out the small tube nestled within.
“Oh ay,” the man grins, leaning his arms on the bar and displaying a matching mark. “Those monster hunters rush down here in droves.”
Whatever Mycroft might have had to say to that is interrupted by someone pounding at the hotel door.
They are waved through the gate at Baskerville with ease, the guards recognizing his face. Sherlock wonders what Major Barrymore told them. The man is nowhere to be seen when they park, which is fine by him. Sherlock leads Henry down to the 4th floor lab, the man has worked himself into a continuous twitch of his right eye and he stays as close to Sherlock as he can get without touching, but he follows all the same.
The inside of the room is one massive space, the roof is curved like the rest of the tunnels and about 10 meters in height. The tall walls are lined with small platforms, which appear to contain a mix of toys and balls.
With a flick of his fingers, Mycroft summons the seal he had designed. He tosses the paper and it sticks in the air in front of him. The ink glows purple as he draws his magic out, concentrating on every line, every rune he had painstakingly laid on the page.
“No,” Lestrade shakes his head. Sally has known what he is not long after they became partners. A case with a particularly powerful demon had required his unique brand of holy magic. “I just,” Lestrade sighs, “He’s bloody brilliant and he needs someone keeping an eye on him.”
The first time John saw Sherlock, he was just a little kid busking in the park. Of course, John had always seen men playing old guitars and knocking out a beat on some buckets, but he had never seen a kid playing Vivaldi on the violin.
Lestrade and Sally stand unobtrusively at the back of the small room, but Sherlock can feel their gazes on his back. Mycroft, his usual nosy self, stands at his side with a small notebook and pen. As if he didn’t have eidetic memory.
“The body is hardly going anywhere, Captain,” Sherlock shrugs, taking time to put his blood in the fridge.
It is oddly beautiful, his aura. Sherlock is not sure what he expected, but it was not this display of blue flame. There is a spark of something where the flames are the thickest, right in front of his heart. He narrows his eyes, bringing a sharp pain, which he ignores. The shadowed area, a deep-dark blue like the night sky, seems to thicken under his gaze, but gives way after some prodding.
“Water seals in their most basic explanation, give power over a body of water to the caster,” Mycroft starts.
When he gets back to the house, Mr. Hawthorne is still gone. Though he isn’t surprised, a check of the calendar by the door reveals that it is boxing day. That is a surprise. He often loses time while researching, but he hadn’t meant to miss Christmas.
While some of the patch designs I listed are made up, the unit patch with the arching cat, actually exists. It has belonged to the 81st infantry division since WWI, though currently belongs to a reserve unit. My unit patch was actually the sword and shield I gave to Ruiz. The shear variety of patches has always been interesting to me.
The drive is jolting and painful, even more so with his wings crammed behind him and bent out of shape. The adrenaline of the change drops as dramatically as it had come. He feels drained, head drooping even as the car rattles his bones.
He was walking out of the hospital from an exhausting twelve hour ER shift, when the recruiter stopped him.
“A what!?” Lestrade just stops himself from shouting. Guardians are extremely rare, a unique individual with multiple gifts. In general a Guardian not only boosts the gift of their mate, but also has a skill for different protective gifts such as perfect aim or fast reflexes. A Guardian would also be the best match for a man like Sherlock, who apparently needs protection attached to him 24/7.
To complete the impromptu decorating, John manages to hunt down the only english channel playing christmas cartoons. It is an indulgence Mycroft never participated in, even as a child, but he joins John on the couch and watches a red-nosed reindeer save Christmas.
John leaps from the bed, “Mycroft!” He grabs the Seer by his shoulders and shakes him, “Mycroft!” His eyes flutter open, and for a moment there is no one there. The gaze that meets John is devoid of life, eyes blank and horrifying. Then they clear, returning to their usual hazel, flashing with intelligence.
Lestrade, already used to this sort of behavior, follows. The entrance is a large room filled with dusty sunlight. There is a set of intricate stairs leading to the 2nd floor and another down to the basement. The air is heavy with the scent of dust and dry clay.
In an alarming turn of events, that involved hostile Americans and a safe rigged with a gun. Irene turned over the phone to Sherlock, and they all returned to Baker Street.
John forces himself to sweep his gaze over the room in an orderly fashion, the growl had seemed to come from everywhere, and he can’t pinpoint even a vague direction to point his gun. He reaches out with his mind then, searching along the tether that ties him to Sherlock. The pain that bounces back at him is blinding and he has to close his eyes against the onslaught of it. Bursts of light go off behind his eyes and it is like nothing he has ever felt, almost worst than being shot.
The outside of the flat was not terrible, but the inside reeked like old blood and cat piss. The walls were scratched and dented, the paint flaking. Hamish resisted covering his nose by force of will.
Sherlock glared at the folder for an entire minute, before snatching it up. Mycroft knew he would only find a single page in the folder. A high-gloss image of the new Sebastian Moran in a Westwood suit, scanning the area as Jim Moriarty exited the car behind him.
“Sir,” Lestrade starts, but Sally grabs him by the shoulder and shakes her head. Lestrade curses under his breath, but lets her lead him out.
Ten minutes later, he is standing outside the caution tape waiting for the man. Normally, he would let Sally or one of the constables let him in, but he’s not in the mood for the hostility.
“How dare you!” Sherlock felt his whole body draw up in unfettered rage. “You swore, you swore that caring isn’t an advantage.”
They land in Afghanistan five days after Mycroft first sent out the cry for help. Five days feeling the anguish along their dwindling link.
Sherlock turned to the folder, flipping through the pages slower than he normally would so he could absorb every word. Most of it followed what he already knew, just filling in the blanks with more details.
“He’s been shot in the shoulder, and there is something wrong with his leg,” Sherlock grits between clenched teeth as he is bundled into the car.
Chasing the yellow graffiti led him to three murders and a fascinating Chinese smuggling ring that left the newly appointed DI Dimmock baffled.
Sherlock gives a tentative smile, looking painfully young. “Acceptable,” he says, trying to suppress his grin and failing.
“Bugger,” Sherlock cusses as he looks the man over a little more thoroughly than his original cursory glance. “You’re a cop.”
“Of course, Sir,” Lyons looks relieved. “Perhaps we could go see Major Barrymore, now,” he suggests.
John looks in the bag, but in the shadows it just looks like something in gravy all mushed together, it doesn’t really smell like anything. He takes a bite and its half hot half cold and he thinks it might be a pasta of some sort. The others are diving into their food, scarfing it down in huge gulps. John follows their example, if he eats fast enough he doesn’t have to taste it.
“You’ll have to ask him about it. He’s at the Diogenes, but apparently this is a national security matter and thinks you’ll find it interesting. You know he wouldn’t offer you a case so soon after your bonding. I told him not to, actually, but he insisted. “ Lestrade shrugged.
Afterwards, John had only been trying to be helpful when he pointed out the soul metal dangling about Sherlock’s neck. It was a complete shock to realized the small silver band was a match to his own. He wanted desperately to reveal his band, but he had made a promise to his sister. He can’t afford a bondmate, not now.
She grins at him, “You are quite correct.” She spins to the class, clapping her hands together to get everyones attention. “Now who can tell me more about Lytic lesions?” A few hands raise and in moments they are in a debate about bone cancers and tumors that somehow trails into leukemia, which of course makes the professor pull out her abnormal morphology blood slides. John loves this class.
Sherlock takes the ring and slips it on his right ring finger. He stares at it for a moment, running his thumb over the twisting metal. When he meets John’s gaze, his look is challenging. “Bagram or Kandahar?”
Murray spent time on the man missing his leg, first. He pressed a compress bandage against the stub and wrapped it up tight before securing a strange, black tourniquet further from the wound.
John woke for the first time in weeks without the desperate, heart-pounding wrench into the real world. He felt calm, relaxed. His fever and shakes were gone and his shoulder felt better than ever.
“Dammit Mycroft,” John curses, crushing the wool in his hands. He thinks of their conversation in Hong Kong. Mycroft had listened, and he had actually bought John a thoughtful Christmas gift. He had no idea when the mage could have possibly managed to find such a thing, but John can’t bring himself to destroy it. Still, he places the jumper in his dresser, before burying it under the rest of his stuff.
The day of the auspicious occasion was a Saturday, so mummy and father took them to a nearby park. Mycroft was worried, he didn’t want Sherlock to miss his mate, but mummy assured him that they would meet.
Lestrade and Mycroft take one of those government black sedans to the scene, where Lestrade is expecting to have to diffuse a hostage situation. He jumps out of the car ready to face anything. There are police cars and an ambulance already in place, but the police officers aren’t in position for SWAT. Instead, they are talking to shaking shoppers, taking notes or guiding the elderly to get looked at by the paramedics.
Lestrade flings open his closet doors. The hangers are pitifully empty, his laundry in a pile beneath. He had meant to do the washing the day before, but had come home so late his only interest had been his pillow. He pulls a blue collared shirt from the middle of the pile and gives it a sniff. It is a bit wrinkled, but it’ll do. He grabs a grey suit that looks free of stains and the cheap polyester holds true to it’s wrinkle-free claim.
“You must be the angel. Sherlock has told me so much about you dear, it feels like we have already met. Your poor hair though, Love, you’ve put yourself in quite the state,” she says, completely ignoring his horrible greeting.
Temasek huffs, “and of course they teach you nothing. What then, brings an ignorant angel and his contemptuous link to my island?”
The problem was not with Mrs. Hudson or the corrupted bond. It had taken when attached to the Holmes family. The problem must be on his end. The problem must be him.
Sherlock shakes his head, “No, I won’t theorize before learning all of the available data. Idiots,” he says rather pointedly, “twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.”
John lets out a chuckle as he comes up beside him. “We got all the SITREPS in, no one was injured. It’s a bloody miracle.”
He heads down the main hall to where the floor dips into the officer offices. He shouldn’t actually have an office down here as a Lieutenant, but Lestrade gave up his space in an effort to keep Sherlock from bugging someone with less patience.
“Detective Lestrade and this is my… associate Sherlock Holmes,” he holds up his badge before tucking it back in his pocket. “We’d like to look around and ask some questions if that’s alright?”
Mycroft nods, but can’t help but be impressed by the kind of concentration that must take. His thoughts are pulled away by a light at the edge of his vision. He turns back to the lake where a dim glow has appeared. The water starts to bubble as the light grows brighter, rushing to the surface.
Mycroft, who is somehow, impossibly, still awake, leans into John, close enough to be heard over the roar of the engine. “I want to go see my little brother,” he announces.
Mycroft keeps a mental tally of the Timer, but even he gets distracted, pulled into conversation with his Mummy. They are chatting about a new article in Mathematics Magazine when Sherlock yells.
“John!” James shouts. He pulls John’s hand away, replacing it with his own. The golden glow helps distract him from the pain. Warm blossoms in his sternum, and John realizes that James is attempting to heal him. The only exception to angel healing is other angels, but James is attempting to heal something that isn’t physical.
John looks away, biting his lip ‘til he tastes blood. “He was worried for me. Thought it would be safer back in London.”
He looks up to find the classroom long empty and his professor standing in front of him. “Ah, forgive me sir. I was...distracted.”
Are you surprised? I hope you'll are surprised. Lestrade started out just being a cameo character, but as soon as Sherlock started getting more screen time, he suddenly became a character of his own as well.
Less then fifty yards away, a soldier cried out for help. He was dressed in the same British gear, unable to move do to the complete loss of his left leg. He was reaching out, crying for help. His sleeve slipped to reveal a Level four bond mark in dark green.
“We’re almost there,” Z cheers, taking the jeep so sharply around a corner it goes up on two wheels.
They pass through the parlor - all hardwood floors and chandeliers, everything done in shades of white- and head for the stairs. Sally leads him to the master bedroom. There is man tied to the bed, hands and legs lashed to the posts with rope. He is bare but for a pair of black boxers and a blindfold tied around his face.
The man glances down at John’s arm, and he can’t quite hide the widening of his eyes at the multitude of red marks. “Honeymoon?” he asks, it's cool enough that John should probably be wearing a coat, but he still can’t bring himself to cover the mark, even while Sherlock hides his away under multiple layers.
“Records in the system have him listed as one John Harrison, but we had Q Branch go through the records, and the files appeared out of no where two months ago. They were well hidden, and expertly added, but traces will always be left when an entirely new life is added. CCTV shows the man first appearing with Moriarty sometime in the last month, but he evades the cameras with some skill. Closer reports say the man goes by the name Sebastian Moran.” Anthea read from her phone.
In the following hours, Mycroft loses himself in study. He flips back and forth through the book and fills page after page of another book with his notes. Finally, he sits back with a sigh.
The room flickers and its a close up of Sherlock’s face, now a few years older than before. He looks so happy, so
The intercom buzzes, the Captain telling them they are about to land. Not long after, the plane comes to a stuttering halt. Mycroft is grateful they get off first, his legs are stiff and he has zero interest in fighting in the usual mad dash to get off the plane.
“Hey, LT, haven’t seen you in here in awhile,” he greets with a grin. Sgt. Hunt is paired with a male, warrant officer, they share a set of eight foot Cerulean Warbler wings. They are always carefully preened and kept clean, of course if Sherlock had wings large enough to fly he imagined he would keep them just as neat.
Agent Smith steps forward. “Your father consulted with us on multiple projects. He was one of the greatest alchemists of his time. He left this watch behind with the intention that it would one day go to his son. It is imbued with a powerful protection spell. I imagine it has more secrets, but whatever they are your father took them with him to the grave.”
“A skill that has been very helpful over the years,”Agent Smith comments, leading Mycroft further underground. Mycroft can sense powerful holy magic in the direction they are heading and in his mind’s eye can see the flash of wings. His heart beat quickens, it can’t be.
The trip through base is a blur, John is barely conscious, his ribs feeling like they are being cracked open from the inside. He registers James’ shout and then there are hands on his chest, the feel of sigils being drawn.
The doctor jumps, startled, then she glares at him. “I’m guessing your the reason we are on lockdown. Some of these research projects can’t be left alone, certainly not for twenty-four hours.”
“I’m sorry, I forgot.” He pulls them in quickly, ruffling the papers, but, thankfully, not dislodging them. “It was the warding, I needed to…” he gestures to his back that hopefully explains.
“This is separation sickness?” Bill asked, brow furrowed. He had seen it before of course; being in the military could make getting to your bond mate difficult. But he had never seen anything like this. Separation sickness was characterized be finger twitches and a slight fever. John looked moments from death’s door. “We have to get you to Sherlock. We know where he is, come on. I can even call him, his number was on that weird website of his. “
He stitched the wound, careful to leave a drainage tube, and disinfect the area. He replaced the empty saline bag with one filled with antibiotics.
John leans his head against the seat and closes his eyes, still feeling exhausted from their endeavour. The sounds of a violin concerto lure him into a sort of meditative state. His mind is blank, there is only the music and the rhythmic hum of the car around him.
Sherlock was almost ten when he had his first lesson on the Soul Vision and bond. It was also the year he learned that redness around a bond mark implied infidelity.
He takes the steps to 221B two at a time, bounding up them with a loud stomp that will probably upset Mrs. Hudson. “Sherlock,” he calls, pushing the door so hard he stumbles out of it.
Sergeant Sally Donovan is waiting for him at the door. She’s dressed in a smart pant suit, starched within an inch of its life, and her hair is pulled into such a tight bun that the edges of her eyes are narrowed.
Mycroft flicks the watch closed and shoves it in his pocket. “Ehm,” he clears his throat, “thank you.”
Sherlock hated the man, but having a chance to show off and take his mind off John was just what he needed.
“As much as I’m sure that’s true,” Mycroft’s tone is smug, “you should be home, not traipsing around London. You’ll get yourself killed.”
Harry manages to come back twice to give them water and a few bites of stale bread. She checks over their injuries, paying careful attention to Don. She spends each time barely whispering, her gaze darting frightfully towards the hall.
“I’ll tell them, I swear, but you can’t be here. The Detective Inspector in charge of this case will be here and he can’t see you. I’ll be fired in a heartbeat.”
Lestrade took a deep breath and scratched behind Riddell’s ears. She pressed against his leg for comfort, “Into the breach, boss?”
“I know Bethesda said we’d know him when we saw him, but there are an awful lot of birds here,” John comments peering at the endless rows of birds.
Mycroft notes that none of that statement is actually listed as a request. Still, this has been what he was waiting for, even if he would have prefered MI5’s domestic security instead of MI6’s more international habits. “Then I can only hope that I exceed your expectations, Agent.”
Hamish watched the man, brow scrunched, because Moriarty was crazier than he was, and he had just entered into a PTSD episode that resulted in him skinning a man. Christ, he was in over his head. “He was a bad man,” he offered with a shrug, incapable of much else.
They make it into the mountains without issue. John can feel the link strengthening the closer they get. Mycroft is still reaching out to him, but pain makes the signal confusing. He has to close his eyes, concentrating completely on the thin strands of violet magic that call out to him.
Lestrade led them down the long corridors to one of the Vision rooms. One of the so-called nurses was standing outside with the Vision medication. Sherlock read her history in moments. She wasn’t actually a nurse, just a pretty face to make the patrons more relaxed. The scuffs on her shoes and the stain on her shirt showed the job didn’t pay well and she spent her nights working as a waitress. The deductions helped, made him less...tense.
Gosh, everyone has been so nice about me coming back, thank you. I apologize that the beginning of this chapter mirroring the episode, I hate it when other people do that, and here I go doing it, but I need to set up my plot and the differences are important. I hope everyone enjoys it, and thanks for reading.
“Yes, Sherlock,” Mycroft chuckles, tucking his watch on a chain around his neck. It settles close to his heart, a warm weight during the cold London night. “Go to sleep,” he sighs, shifting so his head is resting on their duffle, all their possessions in the world.
His heart was pounding and he couldn’t keep the smile from his face. He knew he looked like a giddy schoolboy.
With John off to the upper labs, Sherlock takes a moment to press his forehead to the cold metal of the elevator wall. His head is pounding, he can count each beat of his heart to the throbbing behind his eyes. He takes a few deep breaths before straightening his posture, just in time for the the doors to open.
The hound lifts its giant head at the sound, scenting the air. It gives a rumbling growl before turning from Sherlock. It leaps easily out of the hollow, disappearing into the surrounding woods like a ghost.
A five part story showing how each Avengers has a particular interesting daemon, and how they got that way.
“No, sir. They are calling in help from some of the detachments, there is just a bunch of clean up and moving to do, Colonel wants you to report at 0800 tomorrow,” Murray answers.
“Now, now Mr. Holmes, you know every street in London, you know exactly where we are,” the Cabbie turned in his seat, looking pleased with himself.
Lestrade has pages and pages of reports laid out before him. He has been looking at them all day with Sally, he was there, at the crime scene. Yet in fifteen minutes of
Dr. Hart was in his office, a series of x-rays clipped to the backlights. “Mr. Holmes, I didn’t expect you to come in person.”
The boy has blond hair, or he probably does, he’s filthy, dressed in too large clothes and covered in at least a weeks worth of dirt. He has an old bandaid across one cheek and new and old cuts along his hands. Mycroft notes the discoloration and slight size difference on his right arm that speaks of at least a month in a cast. All of these deductions leads to two things, abuse at home and a runaway.
“He went to Afghanistan in search of information. I had him under the protection of powerful mages, but I should have known that would not be enough.”
He pushes open the heavy door, it gives an angry screech and lets out the overpowering scent of smoke and stale booze. “Hiya John,” the barkeep greets, waving him over.
John is standing in front of the kettle, the old thing makes soft clicking noises as it heats up. He is staring at the two tea cups in front of him, but Sherlock knows his mind is miles away.
“Probably a bit of both,” Irene chuckled. She perched on the side of the chair beside Moran, curling her arm around his shoulders.
“Are you alright, love?” Mummy fusses, kneeling down so she can get a better look at Sherlock’s arm.
Mycroft shrugs, gaze still fixed out into the dark. “Yes, popcorn. Salt and sugar all tied with steel like a cage. I should have brought the brolly,” he murmurs, clenching his fingers. They had sent their luggage ahead to the hotel. John touches his pocket, feeling the shape of the healing stones he is now very grateful to be carrying.
It is of course when he is starting to feel foolish and lets his shoulders relax, that his senses flair in alarm. They are crossing a small street when something shifts in the shadows.
“Detective Lestrade, is not the worst at his job, he made a deduction, no matter how mundane,” Sherlock drawls, but he looks pleased. Lestrade always thought the man strutted about crime scenes like he owned them, but now he is really preening, head held high in some bizarre mating dance.
John looks back, Navamas is standing next to the statue, seemingly waiting for them to make their move. “I think I can draw his attention,” he turns back to Mycroft.
Sherlock straightens to use the full force of his height to his advantage. He looks down at Corporal Lyons with the sort of disdain that usually takes officers years to develop for lower enlisted.  “I will require a tour of this facility, immediately.”
“If you don’t mind, I would like to take a closer look at it before I try and break it.” Lestrade takes a seat, scooting the chair forward for a better position.
The words feel heavy on his tongue, but he chants the spell Smith had given him, focusing on moving his magic through the chakra points. He can feel the push of power, the spell catching, but it slips at the last moment, fizzling out.
It was a blessing to have his hair tamed back to military shortness, and he traded his dirty clothes at a local thrift shop for a jumper and jeans. They were a size too big, but they were clean and smelled like detergent. It was like putting on a new skin. Despite his cane, John found himself standing taller, head held high.
Henry gives a full body shiver, head twitching wildly. His answer is a soft hiss, “a gigantic hound.”
In the back of the lab there are a series of small lockers for the research techs. John finds the one labeled with “Mike Stamford” and unlocks it with the code Mike had given him. In the front of the locker sits a simple metal thermos, completely innocuous.
John watches as Moriarty’s hazel eye goes dim, glazed over in a film of white. He jerks again, body convulsing as he seizes. His mouth moves, but no noise comes out. When he falls to the ground, dead, he still has the look of surprise paralyzed on his face.
The floor is segmented by different furniture. One contains desks and a whiteboard like a school, another has a series of cots, and the center of the room is a mix-match of old couches. The aura of holy magic in the room is so strong it sends warm tingles down his fingers. There is a whoosh of wings above his head, he shifts his gaze upwards and is . . .
John cuts him off before he does spot someone, “Now, Corporal!” he barks. It’s the voice he used to command his aids in surgery and it is tone that allows no disagreement.
There is a large steel table in the middle of the room, piled high with a mess of papers and strange magical items. There is a man bent over the chaos, he’s tall and gangly like a baby giraffe.
Seb glares at him, chest heaving, fists shaking with barely constrained rage. “It doesn’t matter,” he bites out, right eye twitching. “This will be over soon.” He stomps off, leaving out the room with a slam of the door.
John offers him a quirked grin. “I know,” he says in a way that implies he would be snorting in disbelief if he were a less polite person. “Though I figure a gunshot is a bit more effective than an aluminum IV pole.”
“Not too bad,” Bill shakes his head, “Maybe twice a week, she’s mostly just nauseous and suddenly has an intense hatred for curry, which I really hope goes away soon.”
John nods, that will make parking easier, the E.R. and the lab share lots. Its a fifteen minute drive to the hospital, thirty when struggling through morning traffic, but they make the trip in companionable silence. Murray fiddles with the radio, flipping between old rock and alternative.
“Come on in.” Lestrade led him to the ostentatiously decorated parlor, where tea was already waiting.
Mummy had worked alongside them, always smelling like leather from her projects. While father taught him alchemy, mummy would be there to explain the rune work to go along with it. Fresh cut greenery and leather, the scent of his childhood.
It had been two weeks since the visit to the flat in southern London. The body had been cleaned away, but the table and floor had been coated with blood, blackened with age and crackling like bad paint.
Sherlock startles at first, but settles into it with ease, grasping the short hairs at the back of John’s neck to deepen the kiss.
With his wing separating the bulk of the fiery aura, he can get to the center of Sherlock’s bonds. His center is weirdly shadowed, part of it hidden in darkness. He wants to poke at it, but he senses no malevolence and there is no time. He is surprised to only find two bonds in the familia circle, Sherlock’s blue bonded with an crystalline violet that Lestrade immediately knows belongs to Mycroft.
They are in the air in a dust storm, flying for the first time. John’s lips are dry and cracked and he can’t control his hover enough to deepen the kiss, so they keep smashing noses.
He ended up sharing a pint with the man. His name was Sergeant Langdon, and he had spent fifteen years in the service of Queen and Country. He talked about the easy camaraderie between soldiers and how different everything could be.
Sherlock decides to ignore him, focusing instead on his sample, but he can’t quite hide his pleased smile.
Carson’s heart kept pounding and he was sweating profusely. To prevent shock or bleed out, Hamish ended up injecting a large dose of narcotics into the saline drip when his pulse hit 180.
John sends a pulse of holy magic through his wing, into the water. There is no spell attached, only a call. A song for attention with a distinctive angelic tone. He feels a response instantly, a sharp bite of electricity that lingers like copper on his tongue. It doesn’t hurt exactly, more like a chiding flick.
“No wait,” Lestrade interrupts. The glare he receives is down right deadly, but he stands his ground. There is something about this kid. “Let him explain himself. What did you mean wrong?”
“Well now you are mine. My own vicious attack dog.” Jim looked crazed, and Hamish wondered if he was being compared to his Dad. Was Jim jealous of Sherlock and John? That would certainly explain the end game.
He knocks on the massive, ostentatious door that blocks the entrance to Cambridge’s Dean of Students. As expected, the voice that calls out to him is not the Dean’s. He enters the office to find an middle-aged gentleman leaning against the desk. He’s dressed in a black suit, beautifully tailored to hide the bulge of a gun tucked under his arm.
Sherlock holds up a stack of delivery menus with a grimace. “Perhaps not,” he agrees and walks past Lestrade to grab a mug with the unerring accuracy of someone who has long since searched and catalogued the cabinets.
“Then I will see you both then, if you will excuse me,” Mycroft tucked the band into his pocket and left the room with nary an explanation.
“And the only one that holds the rules is the only one who doesn’t seem to be playing,” Irene remarked.
Lestrade huffs, tossing a pillow at his head. “Go to sleep, we have an early morning of crime solving ahead of us.”
Mrs. Hudson’s fierce expression melts back to a kind smile. “It’s alright,” she waves it off with an ease that explains how she gets along so well with Sherlock. “It was a youthful indiscretion, you understand. He was such a dashing young necromancer, my Frank. When he asked if I would bond with him, I was rather swept away, but he abused the bond. Frank was always a bit of an entrepreneur.”
The soldier leads them to a small building surrounded by thick concrete barriers. John takes them in curiously, they are covered in strange paintings, some are protective wards, but most of them appear to be unit mascots. There is something cheery about the chipping paint surrounded by such drab greyness.
Sherlock scoffed, “He said my name after his vision, how many Sherlocks do you think are in Britain? He left that hospital and disappeared to the point neither Mycroft nor I can find him.  That is not something that can be accomplished by accident. “ He shook the folder before slamming it on the coffee table.
Lestrade’s firm hand kept him back. “Shh, Sherlock there’s nothing you can do, just watch okay, just watch.
When he had woken up in the hospital his leg had been an ugly mess of melted soul metal, his shoulder heavily scarred, and his mind just as damaged. Who would want him for a soul mate? Then his sister had found her mate and Bill offered him his home, and he never looked back.
Seb is making a new mark now, careful to keep the slow slide of the blade shallow as he makes a diagonal slash across four older cuts. Suddenly, he grimaces and the knife slips, digging deeper as he jerks his hand. “Shit!” he snarls, pulling the knife back. “Fuck!” he growls, throwing the knife so it lands with an impressive thud into the far wall.
She gives hims a smile that warms his heart. If she weren’t a godling of hearth and healing, John suspects she could be very dangerous indeed.
“You’re not going to text him, are you?” Anderson whines. “We have this, the killer will make a mistake.”
It becomes rapidly apparent that research is unhelpful and frustrating. There is only speculation on the subject of bonding with very little empirical data to back it up. What little research has been done, only concerns the various types of bonds and how each individual responds differently based on a number of variables. The last site he reads claims that individuals with psychopathic and sociopathic tendencies lack the ability to form bonds.
John rinses off in on the large lab sinks and his arm does look better with all the blood and scabs gone. There are only two lacerations, only a few centimeters long, about halfway up his forearm. “I won’t need stitches at least,” John comments, shooting Sherlock a reassuring grin.
The concentrated magic burns away the paper in violet fire, but the mark remains, a blinding light against the dawn. He takes a breath, tries to steady his nerves. “I call on the Guardian, on the Hudson River, the ancient shores that protect this grand city. I call on the Serpent, Guardian of New York City, I call and you will listen!”
Soo Lin’s eyes dart about the room before she slumps with a great rush of breath. “Alright,” she sighs, “let’s go.”
Mycroft grits his teeth, but quickly smooths out his expression. “Singapore was a colony of the crown until 1963,” he explains.
“Wait, that’s it,” Sherlock grinned and rushed over to his bookcase. He pulled out an old sketch-pad, the edges were tattered and torn, but there were still a few blank pages in the back. He took hours working on the sketch, making sure the details were just right.
“Quaint,” he comments, stepping from the jeep and looking over the Inn. It’s a small building done in  brick and stone with a pub on the ground floor. It looks like something from the telly.
Lestrade takes a deep breath of the freshly brewing coffee, it’s rather soothing. “And it didn’t cross your mind to just ask?”
Sherlock was looking at John the same way he looked at locked room murders. His head tilted to the side, eyes narrowed with concentration.
The look Sherlock shoots him would flay a lesser being. “Of course not,” he baulks, “what would be the fun in asking?”
“You’re needed at the Hospital, Captain’s got a case for you” the soldier says, some Private Sherlock doesn’t recognize.
“Get off of this crime scene you freak,” Detective Donovan yells at him, just barely stopping herself from bodily tossing him out of the area.
There is a gorgeous woman tapping away on her phone sitting in the back, but he’s too nervous to try chatting her up. Instead, they sit in uncomfortable silence before he is dropped at a fancy building in the capital district.
“Nah,” John nudges their shoulders together, slowing Sherlock’s pace. “You’re just worried I’ll stop calling your deductions amazing.”
“What were they?” Mycroft asks, stepping forward. He’s still dressed in slacks and a vest, his only concession to the heat his lack of overcoat. The brolly tucked into the crook of his elbow makes John smile.
He sighs, watching the water grow darker with each swirl of the tea bag. Greg had never broached the topic of soulmates with Sherlock. Its a private affair at the best of times and Sherlock is as guarded as his brother, and in some ways more so. He certainly hadn’t realized that Sherlock had bonded, and judging by the argument between the two men it had been some time ago.
“Shite,” Lestrade leans down to get a closer look, careful to stay out of range. “Tattooed into the skin, that’s why the dampeners didn’t work. They are designed not to affect these kind of marks. People get healing runes tattooed all the time, we couldn’t risk dampened that kind of magic in case we stopped someone’s heart.”
Hong Kong glows with ancient magicks and Mycroft finds himself squinting, despite the smog laying heavy over the city. He has to force his senses back, pushing them into a cramped corner of his mind until he is all but blind to the spectral planes.
“Shite,” John curses and fires. Flashes of holy magic come from his guns in bursts, striking Balor one after the other. The light flickers and dies, not leaving behind so much as a mark.
Sherlock rushes forward, a healing spell already on his tongue. She’s convulsing, eyes rolling into her head. Lestrade goes to the ground with her, putting her on her side. Sherlock falls to his knees before them, the spell dying on his lips.
Sherlock holds him off with a shake of his head. “Yes, I’m fine, and even better, I know where we need to go.”
“Amazing,” Sherlock whispered, sounding awed. John took a moment to indulge in the sound, certain it would not be a tone he would hear often.
John’s Dad was a cab driver and his Mum worked as a secretary during the day and a waitress at night.  The two shared a triple bond in loyal yellow.
“Not up to your usual standards, eh?” Murray grins, flopping over the seats so he can aim alongside. He shoots a burst of rounds down the road. “Oh that is crap,” he growls.
He comes back to himself when Lestrade wakes up. The man does not do mornings. He comes awake in a grumble, slapping at his alarm clock as if it has offended him. He does not step out of bed, so much as roll off the side. It is rather humorous to watch actually.
Sherlock doesn’t seem to mind. He kneels in the muddy ground and stares at the reeds as if they hold the answer to life. “Mr. Hudson was arrested for drug trafficking and murder, but they only got him for the one murder,”Sherlock explains to Lestrade.
There are pigeons all over the walkway, skittering this way and that for the choicest pieces of bread. Two get into a scuffle over a large piece of crust, snapping irritably at each other like New York drivers.
“Will do,” Lestrade slips the card into his wallet, where he expects to forget about it until the next time he cleans the damn thing out. As he is leaving the flat, Lestrade realizes he didn’t see Sherlock’s bondmate, but assumes whoever they are may be at work. He leaves Baker street without glancing back, never expecting to return.
John found his best vantage point on the adjacent building. While he could not see inside the pool, he had a clear shot of the roof. Bill’s hidden speakers would give him enough warning of what was taking place down below.
“Give me the violin,” the new boy says. His voice is calm, but something in the calmness sends a shiver down Sherlock’s spine, this is no regular bully.
Sherlock lights up suddenly, “What if you tell them that I’m your One. They can’t chase me off if they think you’re bonded.”
So either Harry borrowed a ridiculous amount of money or John has a crippling gambling addiction that Sherlock is just ignoring.
It takes hours and is late evening when Sherlock gets the sample broken down into its base components. The results are… less than satisfactory. “Damn.”
“It is my brother,” Soo Lin says from the backseat when they have settled into the car. “That is how they are blackmailing me.”
Hamish allows himself to be manhandled. He lets Jim scrub the blood from his skin and when it is time to do his hair, he gets on his knees before the man and lets him message his scalp. He endures a series of soaps and bath washes that he never uses himself, but somehow get the blood off his skin and the scent of rust from his nose.
Of course, by then his father had suffered a heart attack of such strength he was dead before he reached the hospital. His Mummy’s mark changed to black, and the edges reached out in black veins.
Lestrade stared at the sharp clothes, the dragon daemon, and then the small needle that every officer had overlooked. It was a risk, but Lestrade thought back to the little boy he had met years ago and the mythical daemon he had needed to protect him, and he decided to take a chance. “No, he’s assisting us in the case, I need an evidence bag.”
John and Sherlock filled out their statements in silence, each agreeing on what they would say along their bond. If nothing else, the telepathy was excellent for getting their stories straight.
Stapleton can’t quite hide her snort of amusement. “Have a good day gentlemen, give me a ring if you show any side effects.” She gives a nod to them both before leaving the room, closing the door with a soft click behind her.
Z is off to the right and seems fine, if only absolutely covered in dirt. Murray is leaned up against his side and he doesn’t sound right. His breath rattles as he continues to sleep off the drug.
When the Vision settled, Sherlock found himself standing behind three British soldiers in full battle gear. Judging by the gear and the location, they were either in Iraq or Afghanistan.
Mycroft rubbed his brow, “Sherlock, there is no way you could know his name, Visions don’t work like that.”
“I can’t bond you to Sherlock, I’m not sure why, it just won’t take, but I may be able to bond you to the Holmes name. Banshee use to protect certain families in Ireland many years ago correct?”
Also, I'm afraid to admit I cheated on the Sherlock fandom. I found some new OTP and have been reading through them en masse. If I suddenly start writing Avengers vic, it was an accident I swear. Though Hannibal fandom is speaking to me, even if I already dabbled in it. It so funny how each fandom has troupes that are particular to it and then there are the troupes that seem to invade every fandom.
There was no blast of semtex, so he took the moment to focus on the first sniper. Both were down, no visible movement.
Attached is a gift I purchased for the holiday. I do hope you find some use for it. It has been an honor serving with you, and I give you my word that I will get you out of there as soon as I am able.
His thoughts feel of cold and damp, the walls growl with rumbles of hunger. The throne room is shrouded in London fog and the throne is made of broken violin wires, bones, and scattered rubbish. Upon the throne no longer sits his father or mother or Mycroft, instead, floating above the seat is his soul metal, the only point of light in the room.
John takes a deep breath of the moist air, filling his lungs with the cool mist. The land is drenched in magic, old and wild. There is a natural danger in that wilderness, John can feel it across his senses and it makes him grin.
“That’s it, you don’t want to help us find him?” Lestrade raises a brow in question, used to Sherlock running all over the base to catch a criminal.
Lestrade has the victim stats memorized by now and easily lists, “The first victim was Godfrey Norton, he was…”
“Slowed the molecules,” Mycroft explains, getting to his feet with John’s help. His clothes are filthy.
Clapping fills the area, a steady noise that makes the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. John spins around, using his own body as a shield, guns at the ready.
The idea of John being one of Moriarty’s cruel henchmen doesn’t sit right and he becomes so fidgety that he ends up practicing his pickpocketing skills. Mycroft will be furious, but its good practice. With his violin slung over his shoulder and shabby clothing, it’s impossible not to look homeless. This makes people wary when he steps too closely. He has more than once seen a businessman tuck his hand protectively over his wallet at the sight of him. Sherlock enjoys the challenge.
“He said,” Mycroft sighs rubbing at his brow, “that a water seal by the river will summon him, but the Guardian will not be happy about it.”
“No, I suppose it doesn’t. I just can’t let you go on, I just can’t. So sorry,” the spider snapped his fingers and John heard the report of a sniper rifle.
Hyperion ignored him, shifting into a weasel as he jumped from the desk to the bed.  He snuggling against his pillow and set about ignoring his human.
She shakes her head. “No, but I worked on the splicing project for it years ago. I had heard rumors, but I never thought...I didn’t think he actually got it to work.”
Seb steps forward looking curious despite the impassivity he has shown since the confrontation started.
“It…” She trails off as the emergency lights flicker. “That should not happen, the labs are on multiple generators.”
“Sherlock! Sherlock!” someone is calling him from across the room, but not touching him. Thankfully not touching him, his skin feels scraped raw, it is a sensory overload.
“Less and less people are capable of flight now a days, bonding flights are hardly common,” John says, but he has a gleam in his eye.
“I’m sorry to bring you in so early after the bond, but this had to be done. Also, Mycroft has a job for you,” Lestrade said as they handed in their finished papers.
“Why not? Let me be your eyes. Come on Sherlock, what should I look at first?” Lestrade shuffles through the files and picks out the crime scene photos.
“It seems that Moriarty’s new pet is following his own agenda, interesting.” Sherlock tucked his hands under his chin in his usual thinking pose. He walked through his mind palace, digging up the brief meeting of the man.
John stays back, watching with interest beside Lestrade. “Do you think he knows them personally or just acquaintances?” John asks.
John shifted from his spot on the chair arm to sit on the chair Mycroft had vacated. “Is it just me, or did he seem worried?”
Murray was at his side, passed out at an odd angle on one of the hospital chairs. He was in a clean uniform, but a bit of stubble on his face suggested he was not taking the best care of himself.
The scale is more delicate. He pulls it down from the shelf with care, before picking up his set of calibrated weights. They gleam in their padded box, each steel cylinder etched with their weight along the top edge.
The taunting grin on Moriarty’s face falls away. He snarls, rage blooming over his features. “Learning new tricks Johnny boy? Did Sherlock give you that one?”
The boy snorts, amused. He holds his hand out to help Sherlock up, his grin wide. “The name’s John, and that was bloody amazing.”
The gunshots should have been it; Sherlock had been prepared for a fiery death. Instead, the three shots had clearly taken out the snipers on the roof, but who? Mycroft’s men?
John had dropped that little hint on purpose, cherishing the look of surprise. Judging by what Agent Smith had told him about the man’s seer abilities, he rather suspects it won’t be a look he will see often. John flicks his wrists, feeling the pull of magic as he dips into his pocket. The weight of his pistols are familiar and comforting.
John tries to hold back a groan as he shifts on the dirty floor. When his eyes finally focus, he finds himself chained to an old pipe sticking out of the floor in a U-shape. They are in a old building, the floor mostly dirt and rubble surrounded by four concrete walls decorated with old blood and mold.
Don nods, clapping him hard on the back again. “You do what you have to do John. We’re heading to Kandahar ourselves, and I doubt any of my men would mind you coming along. You kept eighteen kids alive in the desert for months, we’d be glad to call you a camrade.”
Sherlock turns away from the screen, his gaze unreadable, but John can feel a sharp spike of something across the bond. It makes him sick to his stomach. “Back to Baker Street, there is nothing I can do here,” Sherlock says, pulling his scarf from his coat pocket.
Lestrade checks his watch and tsks. “Well, we aren’t finding out tonight. It’s late, what’s your address? Sally dropped the car off hours ago, so I can drop you off.”
Sherlock shoots him a murderous glare, but quickly brushes it away. “Well, when you have a case where you find yourself out of your depth, give me a call,” he says, offering over a rather creased business card.
Sherlock takes the long way to Bart’s. He wanders, moving down back alleys, the hidden paths of London. He just needs to move, adrenaline is making his heart pound, and he hates that he is worried. Moriarty is just a man, a dangerous spider of one perhaps, but still just a man. The second part of their game is starting, however, and he doesn’t know the rules.
John has to cover his mouth to stop from bursting out laughing. Apparently Sherlock hasn’t much changed from when he was twelve. He’s still blindingly clever. It is only because John is looking away from Sherlock in his attempt not to laugh that he sees the shape moving in the water. “Sherlock, look out!” John shouts jumping from behind the tree.
All of this is not the most important thing Mycroft notices about the boy, however. The most important thing, is that when he and Sherlock lock eyes, there is a persistent beeping from their respective Timers.
John catches it instinctively, looking stunned by the rings nestled in his palm. They fit perfectly together, looking mostly like John remembers them, but now his ring is half silver and gold and so is Sherlock’s, the pair having shared a bit of themselves to show they are bonded.
Sherlock snarls, barely shifting, so he’s still taking up a majority of the room. “What would be the point? I can’t
“I thought… I was certain they were going to kill us, or sell us. The Irish man asked the blond what he wanted to do with us. I thought he was going to… I thought he was going to hurt us too, but the blond made him promise to send us home. I didn’t believe it until the bodyguards dropped us off at the police station. Just like that, they didn’t even touch us.”
The person that steps forward is just a kid, maybe twelve, but looks can be deceiving. His face is pale and narrow, made even sharper by his prominent cheekbones. With his dark hair in a riot of curls and the strange shimmer to his eyes, he certainly looks like something that might step from a summoner’s circle.
Behind the spider were two hostages. Men tied back to back with semtex wrapped around them. Their arms were also tied together, showing matching quad bonds.
He startles when Sherlock barges in, his fists up and ready to fight, but relaxes once he gets a look at him. “You’re the kid from the park,” he exclaims, surprised.
When Harry comes in, she is running. “We don’t have much time,” she pants, crouching by John. She unlocks him and Bauza before darting over to Z and Murray. Last, she slips the cuffs off Don.
John had received his Vision as he was pulled into the helicopter after he was shot, confirmed by Murray whom shared it. Reports from the flight also stated that John had shouted the name ‘Sherlock’ before he passed out from his injuries.
The hound is massive, one of the large muscular breeds like a mastiff. It has eyes like burning coals and fur so dark it seems to blend into the shadowed lab. Its teeth are bared and gleam white and slick against the beast’s dark fur.
Sherlock scoffed, “Such a romantic notion.” But he looked pleased, his inner thoughts practically purring at having a higher bond then his brother.
Lestrade quirks a smile, posh is one word for it. “They aren’t around at the moment, and he does,” Lestrade presses his palm to his chest, he settles for, “he’s important.”
“Hmm I’m afraid I had to rush things a bit. You didn’t even let the cabbie play his game. I’m disappointed, Sherlock, I really am. I thought you were like me, but then you had to go and have your Vision. How is dear Johnny, hmm?”
They practically flee out of the building, and John knows that rank is the only thing keeping the poor Corporal from asking anymore questions. Luckily, they manage to get into the jeep and off the premises before any serious questions can be asked.
“You know I’ve never done this to someone that was awake before.” Hamish moved to the side sink and scrubbed his hands and forearms. He didn’t have anyone he trusted to help him prep, but that was okay. The tray by the table was nicely set for everything he needed.
His fingers twitch over the handle of the brolly, spell ready on his lips. With narrowed eyes, Mycroft can just make out the hulking shape in the alley. It’s aura is blood red, oozing with black like a wound.
“No,” Mycroft grinned, a slow upturning of lips like the smile of a shark. “I think you will work just fine.”
“Yes, I think you do,” and then Jim’s fingers are at his trousers, pulling them open with some skill.
“Right, yes,” Stapleton pulls her gaze away. “Animals don’t have soul bonds, obviously, but this poision works on a neurological level, so they can still be used to produce an antidote in the same way we synthesize snake and spider antivenom.” She gathers up the sample she took from the hound, a transfer pipet, and a small syringe.
“What kind of bond was it?” Lestrade asks before this strange story can get any further out of hand.
John felt a jolt down their connection like a lightening bolt. All of Sherlock’s considerable focus was suddenly tuned to ‘the woman’.
John can’t quite hide his laugh. “Sorry, I guess it is a little off the beaten path, but I haven’t been here for ages. It’s a little far from Baker Street so I usually go to The Royal Lion, but I thought you might like a change of scenery.”
“He ran,” Sherlock remarked, he could feel his body being overcome with numbness. There was a twitch in his fingers he only got when he needed a hit.
He flings the lid off the box, revealing a black and white striped jumper. It is cashmere-soft beneath his fingers, but the texture is off. When he holds the jumper up, there are no tags or signs of machine stitching. A piece of paper flutters to the floor. At first, he thinks it is another letter from Mycroft, but it is actually a company card. Printed in exaggerated text is a letter explaining the jumper. Apparently, it is hand woven pooka and gryphon fur, making the jumper resistant against some spell work and fireproof. Turning the jumper around, he finds two slits running down the back with buttons and loops at the bottom. It’s custom built for wings.
The black lines Sherlock had noticed in the station lead down to the heel, crafting a spider web of lines down to a black mark, a stylized flower. Sherlock reaches out. The mark reacts, dark sparks leaping from it and sting his finger.
Mycroft presses the top of the watch and it opens with a soft click. John leans over his shoulder, probably rudely, but he’s curious. The watch face is beautiful. Instead of numbers, the face was left blank so as not to obscure the interlocking gears that could be seen beneath. The watch hands are delicate silver arrows, vibrant against the gold and bronze inner workings.
Sherlock stood, approaching him so quickly that he forced John up against the wall, crowding him into the tiny space. John dropped the gun, held his hands out in surrender.
One of the men held a gun to his head, but was speaking to Irene, “You’ll tell us where it is, Mrs. Adler, or we will be forced to kill this gentlemen. I’m quite certain you don’t want to loose your one chance at finding your mate.”
“Oh my god, John!” she gasps, nearly dropping her tray. She runs over, plops the tray on the ground, and crushes him in a hug. “You came back,” she chokes, her voice somewhere between desperate and scolding.
“Then I don’t have long,” John growls, pressing the knife until a thin red line appears on Mr. Hope’s throat.
It was a smooth lift, he never would have noticed if he didn’t always pay more attention on this side of town. The kid is a surprise. He’s probably close to twelve, but barely looks ten. He’s skinny and his clothes could use a good washing, but he looks surprisingly healthy for a street kid. His eyes are fiercely intelligent, some blend of bluish-green he can’t name, and his hair is a riot of dark curls that could desperately use a cut and cleaning.
It laughs, a deep, raspy noise that makes John’s hair stand on end. Bones snap and grate as the creature slinks down from the chairs. It’s back legs are twisted at a grotesque angle. Patches of white and black fur fall to the floor, revealing the writhing flesh beneath.
John puts himself in the center of the large cage, looking for anything that may be of use against the monster hound. There is absolutely nothing in it, and he wonders if he should have tried for one of the lab doors on the far wall of the lab, but he knows as close as the hound was following he never would have made the distance, especially now that his Browning is sitting two meters away, outside the cage.
The man leans forward until his breath ghosts across Sherlock’s face, he smells oddly of tobacco and apples. He grasps the back of Sherlock’s head, his fingers bruising as he tightens his grip in the curls. “You can call me Seb, Mr. Holmes.” He jerks his hand, making Sherlock strain against his hold. “Do you understand my meaning, Mr. Holmes?”
There is a loud boom from a concussive rune, violet light slamming into the beast and sending it into the side of the car. The train rocks with the force of the hit, windows shattering in a spray of glass.
Sally scowled. “Shut it, freak. I guess if two sociopaths bond the marks would have to be high. It must be easy to form a connection when there are no emotions involved.”
Molly’s hands are shaking as she presses her fingers over her lips, tears welling in her eyes. She shakes her head, “I can’t, I can’t… We moved and it was so pale my parents took ages to realize what had happened. I thought I would never find you. I couldn’t feel anything, there was no… no draw.”
The entire jeep leaps up, flipping over and over as fire roared all around. John screams, not sure if he’s screaming for Harry or God or if he is just screaming. Everything hurts, pain bursts from his legs up.
The barracks are at the far end of the underground base. Powerful shielding spells mark the way. Each step makes John more and more uncomfortable. The spells are specifically designed towards mythos, protections in case any of the trainees summon something they can’t control. It’s not enough to prevent his own entry, but it feels like an itch beneath his skin.
Lestrade slaps his palm to his brow and groans, “Lord help me.” He pulls his car keys from his pocket. “Come on then, you can crash on my couch. We’ll call your parents and tell them you haven’t been kidnapped.”
There’s a breath over the phone. “My fourteen year old brother,” Mycroft drawls, “is helping the London Magi with a case?”
Bauza is chained up next to him, but is still unconscious. The man has been shot in the upper arm and someone bothered to wrap a filthy cloth around the wound, but blood is still seeping sluggishly down his arm. It drips to the dirt in a steady plop, and John must still be drugged, because he spends minutes watching the hypnotic fall.
He decides not to open the door, though he doubts there is anything he can catch just by stepping into the room. He looks through the window in the door, spotting another incubator in one corner next to a few high end microscopes, and a closed in hood with rubber glove inserts to work with more contagious microbes.
Murray stares at his watch and starts to worry. It only just turned 1600, but John has a tendency to be ten minutes early to everything, a rather military habit for a man that never actually joined.
Sherlock is not one to wait at a bedside idly, so when John slips back into sleep he leaves the room. He goes down to the pub, he feels jittery all over in a way  he hasn’t felt since he stopped using cocaine.  The jitteriness is the only excuse Sherlock can give for the fact that he doesn’t notice Henry at first.
He had other things he could check on, but Hamish was near shaking with the need to be out of the house. To just wander the streets of London, which is exactly what he did.
He breaks down and sleeps that night, too irritated to do much else, but the next morning he starts his research. The jade dragon pin is surprisingly easy to find with the right search term. It only takes a few pages to pull up an excerpt. As suspected, the pin is from the Qin Dynasty. A gift given to the emperor Xiaowen for aiding a river dragon. Though reports vary as to the abilities of the pin, everything from healing to a powerful spell focus. The pin was promptly passed on when the emperor died rather suddenly a year into his leadership. The excerpt follows the pin until its disappearance in the 18th century.
“What is it?” Sherlock asked, his dislike for asking his brother questions outweighed by his curiosity.
Moriarty is sprawled out on the cot, looking bored as he flips lazily through what looks like a bridal magazine? He clearly wasn’t told to expect a visitor because he barely spares John a glance at first.
“That’s good,” John sighs, falling back into the other chair. His body slumps, every tense muscle relaxing. “I felt the pain through the bond, I thought I was going to be too late.”
John faces the voice. The man is old, hair grey and thin. His skin is sickly pale, dark bruise smudged beneath his eyes. He’s dressed in a grey cardigan and torn trousers, a strange combination beside the red fox pelt slung around his shoulders. When the man raises his hand, John notices the bloody bandages wrapped around the stumps of his index and pinky fingers.
Instead, John follows Mycroft’s gaze to where it has fixed on Smith’s second shadow. Perhaps sensing his concentration, the shadow changes form. It’s hair turns into a spiky mess, framing long, pointed ears. Two eyes, formed simply by an absence of shadow, peer up at him. The mouth that forms from the darkness is all angles and sharp teeth. The shadow moves on its own, waving cheekily at him before settling back into shape.
The runes ignite as one, blasting into the creature in a blinding light. John has to close his eyes against the glare. When he can open them again, blinking rapidly to chase the spots from his vision, the tiger is gone.
John dressed down to his pants and snuggled into the cool sheets. He was asleep in moments, right hand curled around his marked forearm.
Of course, Mycroft’s vision had shown the guardian at night so they have a few hours yet. They check into their hotel, a looming skyscraper with amazing views of the city, but John’s wings droop as he looks out at the city.
John takes a shaky breath, taking a moment to steady himself and pull his usual calm in dangerous situations about himself like a mantel. His body settles easily enough, but his arm is throbbing with pain in tandem to the beating pain in his head. He pulls his jacket off carefully, weary about jarring his clearly broken arm. The jacket has huge tears all along the back and big gashes on the left sleeve.
“Dr. Watson!” a young soldier comes running up to them. His top has been haphazardly pulled on, fitting awkwardly around his fluttering grey wings. “OH!” he exclaims, “congrats Captain, but we need you in the lab.” The soldier, whose tag reads Murray, helps the doctor to his feet.
Proving it, however, was harder than he had assumed. If he had been an instant slower, a child would have died for his failure. Perhaps knowing about the Solar System could be of ‘some’ use.
Dartmoor is beautiful in a bleak sort of way. John watches the landscape go by from the window of the jeep Sherlock rented, which is nothing more than a dressed up version of an up-armored humvee. The scenery is picturesque, rolling hills and far off mountains, with the occasional grazing sheep or cow. It is sunnier than London, less dreary, and John hates it with a ferocity that surprises him.
Oh and I was googling Sebastian Moran to decide how I wanted to describe him and some mad genius did a series of gifs with Michael Fassbender as Seb. Head canon now accepted.
There was a sharp scream from his mum, a cry from Harry, and his da was screaming, begging someone to “Please, God No!”
This was partially inspired by the Johnlock fic Five Years Prior, if you haven't read it, I highly recommend it.
Moriarty’s expression dissolves into a deep frown. “I thought,” he growls, “that Sherlock was perfect. A intellect like mine, without the useless connections. Of course there was dear big brother and the detective, but those were easily dealt with. It was you,” Jim spits, “you and your bond that ruined him. Made him ordinary, just like everyone else.”
John winces, “Ew.” He flips the pages back to the drawing of the seal. “But you don’t actually have to seal the Hudson River, though, right? You just have to cast one to catch his attention.”
He returns to the hotel bruised, broken, and without the knowledge he came for. “Bollocks,” he growls, mobile held so tightly, the case creaks in protest.
“Err,” Lestrade looks off to the side. “I can break the bond, but it’s been there too long. It’s in too deep. Once removed, it will leave a gaping wound that will fester and eventually kill you. The only other option is to replace the bond with another one.”
Thankfully, Murray leaned his ear close against the wound, and above the endless noise of the battlefield, he heard the telltale hiss of a punctured lung. “Shit,” the man cussed and dug into the pack at his side.
Oh and the poor guy that got his kidney shot out because some idiot wasn't paying attention when they were cleaning out their gun, didn't die. They stabilized him and sent him home, we kept the bits of kidney in a jar in the lab for months, I never did know why.
He can tell his arm is broken by the odd squish of his muscle beneath his fingers and the particular flavor of the pain, it is hardly his first broken bone. His exploration, however, reveals no bones or chips in the lacerations and that is good.
“Yes, I keep hidden mostly. Sometimes it makes people rather uncomfortable, but Sherlock realized what I was right away,” Mrs. Hudson titters.
Whether influenced by his younger brother or not, Mycroft agrees and they head to a nearby cafe. Greg buys a Chai for both of them and a Mango Lassi for Sherlock. He also manages to get two baskets of Naan, under the guise of being hungry himself.
Lestrade wants to ask questions, but there is no time. He calls the second number on the phone, listed simply as Mycroft. A male voice answers after the first ring, “To what do I owe this call too, brother mine?”
The Bethesda Terrace is mostly deserted. The ground is littered with snow and the wind off the water is biting. Four cherubs are skiing lazily around the fountain, unbothered by the cold.
They shuffle close, nearly touching so they can try the keys on the opposite watch. Greg takes the slim key with care, his hand shaking as he tries to slip the delicate thing into his watch. It slides into place with ease and when the watch clicks open for the first time Greg feels the whole store is filled with the tick-tocking of two watches starting as one.
Smith gives another amused snort, and straightens, “See that you do, Mr. Holmes.” He smooths the lines of his suit and leaves.
John’s first thought is a wolf or perhaps a local dog with rabies and wonders if this case is a waste, but Sherlock seizes onto the answer and John can feel a pulse of something along the bond like an IED blast and he’s swept up in it.
“Morning,” Sherlock grinned behind his tea. John could feel warmth along the bond. Their thoughts seemed to be muted, only a gentle stream of murmurs that was easy to ignore.
“Thank you sir,” Lestrade has to play this just right, Gregson has always been a self-absorbed prat. “Sir, some of the scene may have been staged. Eddie Van Coon is left handed,” he suggests, gesturing to the gun.
“Enough,” Lestrade interrupts. “You’ve clearly been compelled. We can talk at the station, we have a room that will keep you safe.”
“You can’t, Moriarty will be furious if there’s no fight,” Sherlock pipes up, trying to get around John, but the older boy is using his whole body to keep him safely behind.
Hamish winked, “Its all in the jumper.” He tugged at the soft blue one he was wearing. It had been a birthday gift from father.
“Hey you lazy bums, are we going to get this day started any time soon?” Murray asks, poking his head into the kitchen.
Sherlock had only been once and Mycroft had forbidden him from going back, but what his brother didn’t know wouldn’t hurt him. He scurries up an old service ladder that takes him into the ceiling. Its easy to navigate the supports to take him just above the ring. Its a Reichenbach night, so the place is already packed. The sound is deafening, men yelling out bets and cheering, even though the fighters aren’t in the ring yet.
Sally drives like a Londoner, which is to say quickly and with abandon. Lestrade would fear for his life if they weren’t in a police car, people tend to get out of the way, siren or no. She stops them at one of the service entrances to the London Underground where another police car is already parked.
Sherlock turns, springing back quickly to avoid the man who is now leaning against the door of the locker room. He has a syringe in his hand and is blocking the only exit.
Sherlock snarls, fingers clenching over the grip of the gun. “I will shoot you.” He clicks the safety off with a flick of his thumb before pulling back on the hammer. The click of the round sliding into place seems deafening in the room.
“Yeah, it’s me, you great prat. Look what happens when you leave me behind?” John snarls, grabbing the pouch he’s been carrying since Ireland. The healing stones tumble out, glinting brightly. He grabs a handful, and cups them against Mycroft’s chest, right above his heart.
They went their separate ways from there. Lestrade and Mycroft taking care of the scene, while Bill left to clean and return the weapon. John found himself being shuffled into a cab while Sherlock’s mind buzzed with thoughts of 221B.
Vacillating between being impressed and furious, Lestrade settles for something in the middle. “I promised your brother I would keep you safe. That was good work, but you could have waited. Don’t make a liar out of me.”
“What sort of Magi can cast a long distance transportation spell?” John asks, though he suspects he already knows the answer.
I'm so sorry how long this has taken. It has been a busy couple of months. I finished my med school primary application, and have filled out all of my secondary applications, now I just have to twiddle my thumbs until interview season and hope I get an invite.
Hamish marched up the stairs in simmering rage. It took a long shower and many deep breaths to calm back down. When he slid into Jim’s bed, the crime lord was still down stairs. Hamish fell asleep waiting for him to make his move.
The last plate contains sliced chicken breast on a pile of white rice with a side of cucumber and a tiny bowl of sauce.
Hamish blinked, startled. He hadn’t been expecting that. He put his tea down to stop from choking on it. “I’m quite certain your last Sebastian had his own home.”
“And what is your role here Doctor?” Sherlock can easily deduce that she is a practical woman, brown hair kept short, easy to maintain. She has small, understated earrings, and she wears her lab coat over a cardigan and black trousers. Her shoes are flat, comfortable looking with heavy scuffing from continuous wear. There are no stains on her fingers, but they are dry, signs of constant glove use and continuous hand washing.
