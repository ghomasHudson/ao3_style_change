She was certainly taken aback by this, but she overplayed it well. A real professional. "Thank you, Dr Watson. I'm going to send the patient in now."
John finally took the hand he offered, and Sherlock slowly closed the distance between their personal spaces.
Both he and Kate let their eyes roam appreciatively over her imposing frame. From the chocolate brown hair, which was pinned up into a loose, wavy braid, and a few broad curls that were crowning her forehead, to steel blue eyes and red lips, to the embroidered green dressing gown that covered her arms, her navel, her breasts, but not a lot of skin in between, down to the black high-waist girdle, attached to stockings with straps on them, flattering the pair of long legs. And she knew. She was perfectly aware of what she was owning and how she was using it.
"Well, he wouldn't if he payed a tiny bit of attention for once. I am quite obviously neither gone nor am I dead!“ Sherlock pulled on his hair, apparently an act of frustration. Either due to the stupidity of those who failed to think like him, or at himself for indeed having been abducted in the first place. For indeed being dead and for feeling more and more hollow, the more the truth of it sank in.
With his eyes rolling at the ceiling John puts a bookmark in his book, places it on the table next to him and gets off his chair. Walking into the kitchen, he murmurs under his breath.
"What do you say?" John asked, slowly getting nervous. He could already feel his only chance slipping through his fingers.
) Sherlock to go to the bathroom for him look after his injuries. They have already healed a bit, the marks where John's fist struck his pretty face, but Sherlock must've scratched them open again in his sleep.
Alright. Maybe his imagination went a bit wild there. Compared to all of his ideas, the way it really went down was almost a little disappointing. But if everything was to become an adventure, how would you know one when you saw it?
Opposite them, Mrs Hudson didn't utter a word, neither did she question what she saw. Her wholehearted smile broadened on the inside. She was a woman of decency. So she kept that secret smile to herself for the entirety of the ride while John and Sherlock watched the world outside pass by, holding hands in conjoint silence.
"John, I need you," doesn't even care about how desperate he sounds. "I need you in my mouth, can I?"
Sherlock tried to hide a half-smile. "Same initials," he said. He made a dramatic pause to take off his strange hat and store it away in his coat. "Different man."
Now, as he looks at John's armchair in his mind's eye, it doesn't feel as empty. Behind it he can see the kitchen and the unlit hallway to his own bedroom. The bedroom John is currently sleeping in. For whichever odd reason he would do that, in this foreign world he has been sucked into. It should scare him more. Or fascinate him more, if anything. But all his thoughts were covered, clouded by a veil of the memories of one person's smile, one person's touch, one person's kiss. He could fall asleep to this. To the dreams of John all around him. Hands tucked underneath his chin, eyes closed, mind somewhere far away and yet so close to reality, he doesn't hear the slow steps over the quietly groaning floorboards that are slowly approaching him. He doesn't hear someone walking up behind his chair.
He pushed him into a wall while John struggled with being strangled to death. God, why was he so bloody strong?
John had never wanted to be like him. But he had still gone to the army. Just like his father. A noble occupation, he thought. He had studied medicine first, chosen to heal people with his own hands, and then later chosen to take death in his hands as well. That was what he was, and he had soon learned to accept his contradictions.
By the time the door has closed, Sherlock is sitting on the edge of the kitchen chair. Absolutely devastated. He couldn't possibly count as clothed anymore, the dressing gown open and half slipped off his shoulder, hair utterly ruffled, the skin between his legs still throbbing and demanding attention, face in his hands and his head feels simply fucked with.
Fingers wrapped around palms, and they shook hands once and stilled. The air in the room was gone, it seemed, as if those two joined hands were sucking the oxygen into an invisible black hole. He had held his whole arm in his hands, without the man himself attached to it but somehow this was different. Sherlock was looking John in the eye with open interest written all over his features.
, Sherlock thinks, but only for a second, as shortly after he feels the head of John's erection (wet and hot and
His mind wandered for a second, or two, or fifty. This man was different from the one he had believed to have seen in Inspector Lestrade's office. Then and there, Sherlock had seemed to him so cold. But he wasn't. Which was an ironic thing to call a machine, wasn't it? When their ways had crossed for the first time, he had anticipated him to be a threat, had been quite suspicious, and rightly so, of everything he had claimed to be the truth. But now? Now he could very likely be the most human being he had ever had the pleasure to encounter.
. Only Sherlock. As beautiful as he has ever heard his own name sound. He’s had no idea his name could sound like this, and he’s not sure how anything else could ever come close to being this good.
, you have a doctor here now. Dr Watson, go tell him what he is doing to his health if he refuses to eat or sleep or let others care for him."
Sherlock blinks slowly while morning light forces him to close his eyes again. His every thought is limited due to the confusion of being awake so suddenly, and he thinks the sun might have crept into this room to blind him and only him, forever.
“It's not fucking fair!” He kicked the tank again. Again and again until his foot felt swollen, and yet he felt nothing.
His hands slide up Sherlock's back like he was afraid of breaking him, and Sherlock doesn't know if he should be annoyed or flattered, until his fingers run through soft, dark curls and teasingly pull on some of the longer strands.
. Simply stared straight ahead, bewitched. John could feel it too, a distinct itching in his fingertips.
John doesn’t flee to take an hour-long walk that day. He would never trade a lazy Sunday with Sherlock Holmes, after all. Sherlock continues with his experiment, and John reads. Later they watch telly together and Sherlock yells at the incompetent game show host on BBC One. He said he could wait till John figures this out, whatever this is. But maybe they both don’t have to wait that long. Maybe, just maybe, posh boy could actually love him back.
And here he was, having accused Sherlock of being obsessed with control. His brother was on a whole different level. Still, the fact that he had never heard of him before was not to be taken lightly. He had no means of betraying Sherlock's trust or taking away his decisions from him. On the other hand, he had no doubt the man would make his threats come true. He seemed to care a lot about Sherlock as well. John wondered how long he could stretch his patience before the punishment would come. But he was willing to find out.
"You know, Watson..." Sholto took a deep breath. "When word reached me that you had indeed survived, I was filled with great relief. I knew you would be taken out of duty, and I was glad for it."
"Ex?" John asked, his gaze not leaving Jane as she turned and performed movements he had never seen before, had never known could be considered as
John bit the insides of his mouth and looked from one to the other. Suddenly the air felt too thin to breathe and the awareness of him being caught underground weighted him down like the whole building was about to collapse at any given moment.
Sherlock makes a noise that sounds not quite like a laugh and not quite like a sob, but his whole face transforms regardless. A wide smile stretches over his face and puts a new kind of light behind his eyes as he recognises his own bad joke from John's lips. John smiles, too. He loves Sherlock's happy faces a lot. An awful lot. His heart swells even more, and just in this moment he knows they'll be okay. Somehow. Not today, probably not tomorrow, but someday, somehow.
. She had since learned that Sherlock wasn't like that, wasn't that kind of man. And that it was fine. He didn't have to be in order for her to care about him. But Sherlock had always seemed so... lonely. His happiness came second, or third or fifth. The work always came first.
“Listen to me, you ratbag! Fancy playing the hero one more time and I will be there. You won't be able to run or hide from me and I will kill you very slowly, make you feel every atom of your pathetic being while I skin you and lay eggs in whatever will be left of your flesh.”
He spun around so fast that John's eyes struggled to follow his frame, and when he came closer again, he only stopped as their faces were only inches apart. He was looming again. John did not back down, and his dark blue eyes searched light blue.
Not without the renewed fear that he was going to make a fool of himself, he hesitated. Sherlock's eyes bore right through him. The song was going to end. They both felt the end coming. Sherlock let go of John's hand in his, leading it to his neck instead. Sherlock's warm neck, just the tip of his curls brushing the back of John's head. His breath caught in his throat. Then Sherlock closed his eyes. Let himself fall.
, the huge size of him, the scent of him, his precome, and just imagining him coming down his throat is so hot a thought that he feels the vibrations of his long moans around his lips. Seems like John feels them, too.
Screams. Deafening, earsplitting, vicious. It shouldn't get to him so much, the sound of them burning and dying from the silver easing through their pale flesh. It shouldn't be so horrible.
"You're a doctor, John. You should be capable of saying-“ but then he realises that as he tries to come up with a word for it, to say it out loud and have it hang here in the space between them, his mouth stands still. The mocking but loving smile is wiped off his face again, and his open lips form the gap he is feeling between his heart and mind.
John took one deep breath. Just one. Steady. He had to relearn how to cry. He did that with Sherlock sometimes, waking up from a nightmare about him dying in the chambers and finding comfort in the tears. Finding more comfort in the feeling of his hand on his back, soothing his shaking body in bed next to him. But the tears helped. They were not a sign of weakness, they were a sign of his humanity. Sherlock had proven this to him. Since he was back to being human in form, he had become incredibly human on the inside. He smiled so much at the littlest of things, chuckled at stupid newspaper articles and his eyes would light up with excitement like they had never done before. Sometimes they cried together.
He’s always enjoying stupid ideas, especially when they involve John. And this is absolutely stupid, this is irresponsible, it’s dangerous, it’s-
Sherlock and John are running through the next dim lighted alley until they come to a stop, eventually. John's first reaction, after having chased a very athletic murder suspect through half of London's streets again, is a brace of his arms on his knees and a gasp for air.
When he was in the hallway again, he felt for the outline of the tube in his trousers, and with his other hand he did the same to feel for the eyeball over his chest. He tried to tell himself that this was not one of the weirdest things he had ever done. He winced as it gave a slight jerk. He must have touched the pupil. And it could not even blink away the irritation, as it had no eyelids. John was about to mutter a silent apology, but immediately felt ridiculous and dismissed the thought. This was not the time for embarrassment though, he reminded himself. He slipped into the room where he had treated Irene earlier, just as he heard the footsteps on the stairs telling him she was coming. John made short work of placing the tube with the lilac substance in his medical bag and somehow managed to not look too caught in the act as the door was being opened.
He takes the phone out of Sherlock’s breast pocket and holds it out for him. But instead of taking it and paying no more attention to him, Sherlock is suddenly staring at him like his face was on fire. John frowns at him. Sherlock, in turn, raises one brow.
John shot Sherlock a look. The detective looked back at him with an interest in his eyes he had yet to understand. He was not used to being the one who walks after someone else's command, was that it? Or maybe he could acknowledge that old pair of shoes on a new man and found they still fitted him fairly well.
He feels so small. Seconds elapse and he keeps on staring into the sky, starts to find himself trying to count stars, trying to disguise his attempts with logic. Trying to calculate if it is really possible for him to see millions of stars at the same time, when he has just established that it isn't, that it doesn't even come close. And yet, he can't get over the feeling that if he would have the time, he would count every single star to prove himself wrong.
"John," Sherlock says, and his voice is deep and soothing. He knows this tone of voice, but it is still rare for John to hear this much emotion all wrapped around his chords. If he thought back to the Sherlock Holmes he first met all those years ago...
, which was the nonverbal equivalent to what he was about to say. "How else would I still be so clever?"
There are more wrinkles now, the bags under his eyes are deeper, the grey strands have long dominated the blond ones. His face looks more worn, his jaw stronger and his eyes harder from all the battles fought, from all the hate and sorrow he swallowed. Sherlock loves his face probably more than ever now, as much as it makes him sad, and as much as it completely flashes him right now.
John’s eyes drop, and his breath is ragged, but Sherlock suspects this time it’s for entirely different reasons than anger. He doesn’t know who gives in first, and frankly, he doesn’t give one fuck about it because the next thing he knows is that John’s lips are on his and it feels like he’s dying and being reborn in one single breath.
Sherlock, having quickly followed John’s gaze and, apparently, thoughts, answered his question. "Tom is a boy for legwork," he said, matter-of-factly as if he would not talk about an individual person. "He is very good at spying and not as good at thinking. I've also heard he makes quite an excellent meat pie."
The with sweat glistening hair tickles his forehead when John brushes a curl out of his face with the back of his hand. "Although it was quite hard. With you being just … Wow, Sherlock. You're so intense, you're beautiful."
"But it went wrong," John said, and all eyes were on him. "Moriarty was not prepared for the invasion to happen that night. So if the leader of those monsters – and they must have a leader – knew of him, knew of his mask ball, they saw the perfect opportunity to strike. Thus, they must know of his plot against them, which means..."
But John groans and listens to him, bending down and finally, finally starts moving again. He builds up speed and pushes into him, he can feel his hard cock like the hotly burning key to all his cravings. He thrusts into him again, and again. And again, and again.
John understood. He really did. With a chest-tightening, fist-clenching clarity he understood how he felt. The man had died, for God's sake! He had died, and the body in which he now walked this earth wasn't his own. This couldn't possibly do any good for a confused soul, nor the fragile essence it was made of. Dying must have felt like a failure for Sherlock. Even if he did not admit it, even if he kept on pretending it was only the transport formed by flesh and bones that he had lost and that he was still the same ... Death changed people.
"Only Hooper?" Anderson threw in with a frown. "You know I have been trained to do that sort of thing, right?"
He let go of him just as his hand started sweating. He had felt his breath on his skin. Cold and hollow. Almost non-existent. Maybe he had imagined it, maybe he hadn't felt anything at all.
. And talking to an ear in the backseat of a cab all by himself? Not a very good look. So back into his breast pocket it went.
Everyone was staring at John, hearing John's rage and anger breaking out of him, at Anderson who had trouble keeping his eyes open and his nose from bleeding.
"Mr James Moriarty," he said sternly, raising his voice to increase the impact the name bore, "has personally engaged me to take a look at Ms Irene Adler's injury. I'd rather not disappoint him. Would you?"
"A doctor and a knight? You are a treasure, John, and you may regret this for the rest of your life if you don't at least consider this. Apply for the job I am offering."
Suddenly there is nothing, not even a dozen armed police officers bursting into the room, that could hold him back from doing just this. He pulls him close and thrusts his cock between those pretty lips. Sherlock runs his tongue over the head, and he groans so desperately. Between his legs, Sherlock moans too, and the vibrations only make him thrust into him faster, harder. He loses sense of everything besides sensation and thrill. Sparks light up behind his eyelids, travelling down to where his blood is headed and into his thighs. Muscles cramp as he thrusts and grunts and whispers Sherlock’s name, muffled into his clenched fist that he presses to his mouth.
Moriarty grinned in an attempt to look friendly, but his white teeth were sharp and threatening. Or maybe that had been the intention. Next to John, Sherlock looked angry. Angry and helpless and terrified. This wasn't good. This wasn't good at all.
He hears a moan coming from the back of his throat that sounds more like a grunt. Sherlock’s lips wrap around the head of his cock until his tongue starts circling the slit, and he grunts again, louder. His panting grows shallow, grows animal-like and helpless. His every thought narrows down to this. To sex, to the single wanton need that pheromones and chemistry in his brain reduce him to. He needs Sherlock to swallow him down, swallow all he has to offer, mark him,
A curly-haired police officer came rushing through the door past Sherlock, ignoring everyone in the room but Greg (apparently) Lestrade. "Sir, some of our officers claim to have seen-"
Sherlock has gone back to grab the arms of his chair again, only to prevent himself from pushing up his hips and rubbing the fabric prison, of which his pulsing cock wants so hard to be freed from, shamelessly against John's face. He really has lost all of his control that has taken him years to build up for himself. For now, he doesn't care, but how long can this state of mind satisfy him?
John presses himself tighter against Sherlock, lets his hands grab as many dark curls as he can, and their tongues are rubbing against each other, together in a slow rhythem. There is only silence around them, the flat is filled with the quiet, filthy noises of their wet mouths and the rustling of clothes, and soft, constant sighs of pleasure. Again Sherlock's naked chest rubs against John's clothed one, and he shouldn't like it. Shouldn't like the exposure, and being inferior, smaller and beneath. But damn, if it doesn't make him feel wanton and lightheaded, urges him to do things he has never thought himself capable of.
This could be exactly what John had been searching for. The shelf almost reached the ceiling, but he tried to take in what he could find. Most of the shelves were full of fluids. Chemical solutions coloured violet, striking green or brown and muddy. Other shelves had very questionable contents. He leaned down to make out what was swimming in one of the jars, for at first glance it looked like a gigantic tadpole. He was recoiling quickly as he realised that something was staring back at him.
This is the moment his senses activate again. First, a soft sort of humming in his ears, until he starts hearing again, and what he hears is the slow, wet slide of lips. Then the exchange of breath, of low sighs he later realises are his own.
Now would be Sherlock's turn. He was not even there with them, was somewhere deep down in his own thoughts. He stood by the window with hands behind his back. One of the mechanics on the ship had promised to help him repair the part of his arm that had been shot at by an overprotective knight back at the barracks. Until then, it was moving a little stiffly but he was trying to play it off. Sacrificing his body to another that was also vulnerable must have hurt his pride more than anything else.
A great wave of heat is washing over him, his skin tingling from the surprising but not entirely uncomfortable sensation. Whenever John is moving against him, another wave rushes over his whole body. The air between them keeps getting hotter and almost uncomfortably tropic. That is, if Sherlock could give the slightest damn about something as irrelevant as atmospheric humidity right now. All he cares about is John, John's hands, John's mouth, their hips moving together, and when they suddenly find the perfect angle he lets out an embarrassingly loud groan. John's pyjama trousers are thin and he isn't even sure if he is wearing anything underneath, but all he knows is that everything between them is still too much.
John ran towards the coffee table on which the fire was comfortably burning away, for the first time taking notice of all the chaos in the flat. Papers over papers across the whole carpet. He took a few and rolled them together. With those he hit the little flames again and again until they give up and died out. The title page of the paper was now crested with a large, cole-black circle, halfway dissolved into ash.
Sherlock can turn around quickly enough to catch a glimpse of John winking at him, and he feels his knees weaken.
He is now touching himself, finally allowing himself the sweet bliss, but he also can't stop wanting to prolong and swim in this sensation forever. All those impressions right in front of him make it impossible to tell apart hallucination and reality. He is rubbing the rinsing shampoo all over his body now, over his neck, his chest, and whimpers as his fingers find an already hard pair of nipples. His legs only tremble some more, and it would be very unfortunate to trip now, but he cannot stop sliding his hands over the fine hairs of his abdomen, the darker growing hairs along his thighs, and finally,
Now his initial paranoia seemed a little silly. Still, he did have a slight distaste for lifts. Especially those going underground. There was an uneasiness growing within him, but now a hand was brushing his own, and as he looked down he was surprised to find Sherlock's hand next to it. It grounded him, set him back into the present and out of his head. His stomach felt funny. He knew the man liked to pretend he lacked a certain kind of empathy, but he could undeniably feel John enough to know when to bring him back to him.
Sherlock turned his head to look him in the eye. A soft breeze shoving the thin layer of clouds beneath the ship like waves on top of the ocean.
but of course it did. In the end, when leaders thought that every alternative had been taken from them, human lives were always measured by what they were estimated to be worth.
"I thought about how you looked in bed this morning. All drowsy and naked, like a bloody fallen angel." John's hands wander down Sherlock's shoulders and biceps, and Sherlock shivers, shivers so hard, his hips moving on their own, controlled by all the arousal and energy that is currently heading south, heating up the blood in his veins. And John hasn't even properly touched him yet. But this is exactly what makes him ache, makes him beg nonverbally.
But if all of this had made anything clearer to John, it was this: He bent forward in his chair and held out his hand in a silent gesture. Sherlock only looked at him with a rather perplexed expression on his face, and after everything he had just made John speechless with, this was an oddly satisfying thing to see.
together. But no, you had to crawl right into Sherlock Holmes's fucking mind and make yourself at home." He had the slightest Eastern accent that he was trying his best to hide under an American. He had seen his share of the world. An expert on murder and assassinations. Someone like John … Who was he to someone like him? Just another pawn in the long-term game of destruction and taking over the world.
"Oh no." He shook his head with a mocking smile that spoke of how he wished that only this would be the case.
Now it was on him to bear the weight of everyone else's gazes. He looked to Mrs Hudson and to Janine. They were the only people in the room who had witnessed the speech with him. And he had not even properly listened. They knew when he would fail to retell the story, when he would overreact in his proposal of taking action. He remembered a time when he had only wanted to be a little bit impressive to a certain someone. Look at him now.
"Oh. Excuse me, sir, but I cannot recall a Dr Watson being one of Ms Adler's assigned doctors. As you will understand, without further assurance I will have to ask you to leave, I'm afraid. Good day."
." Out of his mouth it sounded like the word had personally offended him. "She's not home therefore."
"Sir." Anthea was holding a little device close to her ear. It looked a bit like a tiny trumpet. "It's General Midnight, Sir. They are ready."
"Say no more. We both know..." His eyes were glued to his own hand on John's shoulder travelling to the side of his neck. "We saw the world burn, you and I. But through two pairs of eyes I must admit the flames never seemed to rise as high as they do now."
Moriarty had entered the stage. He was watching over the crowd with a sly smile carved into his face. He had something to him, something so unmistakably dark that it could hardly be ignored, nor should it be. It challenged you to look at it directly. The first to look away was the first one to lose. He watched over everyone. He would find Sherlock. The mask he wore was like golden metal. It was pure mockery to those who knew what it meant. A robotic half-mask of gold and silver and bronze. The mask of a cyborg.
"Oh, you would have found another way to bring me here, I have no doubt. But you didn't. You thought this was funny." He sounded more bitter, more rough than he was aiming for. He wasn't that angry. It was, after all, kind of impressive of him having pulled that off.
detective. I have worked particularly with him multiple times over the years, and I have solved their cases when the police had repeatedly failed to do so. He owes me a lot of favours, my Doctor."
Sherlock was black and white, dark trousers, white shirt with a wingtip collar. His sleeves were rolled up and unbuttoned, and over the shirt he wore a black waistcoat that clung to his chest, his slim waist and the long backside like a second skin, the narrow stripes on it making him appear even leaner. Around his forehead he wore a pair of round goggles and a protruding magnifying glass was attached to it.
John curses under his breath and wiggles his hips, nothing being quite enough. Insecurity manages to slip through and poke into his dizzy head for a second. He has never done this before (he thinks). But as he looks up at John,
John stood up as well and watched Sherlock through the glass of the tube, which made his face look even more alienated and his eyes more colourful than they already were.
“You… are, actually. Just look at you, you with your… cheekbones. Your… perfectly tailored suits, your annoying British accent and deep voice-”
Sherlock pulls off again, and John whines in a tone he has had no idea he could make until now. He shoots him a smug grin.
So she helped him out. "Well, yes and no, Sherl. His knowledge of me lacks much more than his pronunciation of my name lacks syllables." She gave him a smile that was sweet as sugar and said, "My real name is Janine, not Jane."
invisible, could he? They all exchanged apathetic looking smiles, and after all forced courtesies had been done with, Kitty did not hesitate to voice another complaint.
He was wearing a grey waistcoat that barely fit around his front, a hat with thick glasses above the brim that looked like they had better use protecting one's eyes from melting rather than to improve one's vision. (Apart from the fact that he was already wearing glasses.) Mike gave him a crooked smile, and suddenly John thought he would recognise him everywhere.
"Well, but this is clearly not working. She is fu-" John bites his tongue, suddenly very aware that there is a toddler on his lap. "-
John seems to sense something, for his smile loses its smugness and swaps it with something that is not quite worry and not quite pity, but something in between.
"Ah, yes," Janine finally acknowledged his presence. "I haven't seen you much after Jim's little humiliation."
, John realised. He did not think about how the love of his life had been dead even before they ever met, did not think about losing his own life for him. He would have died a long time ago had it not been for him. With all the strength left, not in his body but in his heart, he made it to his feet, picked up sword with the one and gun with the other hand, staggering over and past groaning soldiers, thrusting their weapons through the enemy's body, vampyres sucking people dry on the floor, cyborgs walking on and on.
John could feel what was going through Sherlock's head as they drove over roughly paved streets on this foggy morning. Shame, regret, a disconnection stronger than he had ever known it. He would have to tell everyone about his true state of being. Why he knew so much about Moriarty's activities. Why he knew so much about the man himself. And all of the things he didn't know. He had seen this face before. The one that was now looking out of the window, was not paying attention to the empty streets but rather to the emptiness inside himself. He had seen it all on his own face the day he had come back to London, the windows of the train teary with raindrops. A mirror in which he sometimes caught his own eye, barely recognising himself.
It's only now that John also becomes aware of his posture. Sherlock on the edge of the lid and him kneeling between his legs. His knee is warm, and just where it dissolves into his thigh he feels hard muscle beneath his touch. Breath hitches in his throat into which his heart has leapt. It seems.
"What are you seeing, love?" He put his head on Sherlock's shoulder and tried to see through his eyes. What would Sherlock see when he looked down at Baker Street? A hansom driving by, a grey and a black horse, pedestrians, a man walking his dog ...
His legs are already trembling from either the lack of touches and friction where he wants it the most, or from the overload of sensations he is currently exposed to. He feels like a stranded creature suffering from amnesia, so that it doesn't know if it will die from the water in its lungs and the inability to breathe enough air or if it has to crawl back into the ocean and to breathe underwater. He doesn't know what to do with his hands anymore, constantly switching between pulling on John's shirt and running up and down the bare skin of his back and raking his fingers through short hair. John seems to enjoy both equally, and Sherlock can't stop to trace and file away the different reactions. He tries to concentrate on this now, to distract himself from the aching and yet untouched erection between his legs.
There was a loud noise from the window they had just jumped through, and their heads snapped up. The window frame was beginning to fall out of its facade, and with a loud
He found Sherlock's undefinable eyes on him again. Alright, he would play this game with him. They had done sillier things together. "I work. I work, well, two jobs at the moment. Or even three, if you will. If we count me working for you."
"Now!" Sherlock announced and the excitement in his face reappeared as he clapped his hands. "You'll go to The Prof and say that you have cured her. If I am correct in my speculations of what happened to her, this musn't even be a lie. Once that is done, we will meet again and discuss how to proceed further."
John Watson, doctor and former knight captain in a war hidden from the ones he had been fighting for, killing off blood sucking, vicious monsters and overcoming death as it had called him, was blushing. Actually blushing from the words of a robot wrapped up in warm, skin-like texture, talking about the beat of his heart when he was himself heartless.
Molly looked as if she had from one moment to the next forgotten how to speak English, as if she didn't understand a word. She blushed slightly, a light shade of pink visible just below her cheeks where her mask ended and her face began. "Sherlock..."
"Oh, Sherlock," he says gently, and a second later two warm hands are cupping his face. "She didn’t say no to you. She said no to me leaving in the middle of a fight. Pretty damn smart, that girl."
On the next note he pressed him closer and they were chest to chest. Sherlock's mouth fell open by a gap, his eyes widened a little. Had he impressed him? He wanted to ask,
"I always took you for a righteous man, Dr Watson," he pressed out while trying to suck more air into his lungs, "But using my own tricks against me ... I'm assuming your previous offer was also a bluff."
The man had taken off his sunglasses and now, mere inches from his own face, John was staring into eyes full of green, like the bud of a cherry blossom in early spring.
The walking stick made him sound like he was either more than one person or three-legged, and even though he was neither, the impression remained. James Moriarty had entered the room. And was walking straight towards John. At first, he did not even seem to see him at all. He was looking past him, and as he passed by, he left an icy aftertaste on John's bare skin and through his clothes.
, the burning slowly fades to be overshadowed by more pleasure, more pleasure sparking up from the inner walls of his very core, from the base of his spine.
John raised his and Sherlock's hands, whereat Sherlock stepped forward and made a turn under his arm. This was a dance move he had seen many couples do before.
"As you might have noticed, this is not an organic eye, of course. You have studied it at some point, I believe? It's a mockup, but it allows me to see even when it's not inside of my body."
She was definitely the one that had made Anderson keep his mouth shut. She walked towards him, distancing herself from the group and created an aura of respect and grace around her not unlike that of a dancer, and very much like-
"What a fine gentleman you are!" she said. "And I imagine I will be seeing a lot more of you too from now on, Dr Watson?"
At hearing that name, the voices around John became dull and distant. Now the water turned to him, crushing him beneath waves that made his heart skip a beat, skip another. Major Sholto.
He stopped. Slowly sank to his knees. A rustle. John tilted his head in confusion, not yet allowing himself to smile at the triumph.
John felt sick. But, fortunately, someone interrupted. The room went silent and the air felt colder, some of their vividness taken out of it, and instinctively John took a deep breath. The steps were heavy and clattering on the old floorboards. Everyone turned around.
Whatever had followed after, he had responded to it with ignorance. Through a miracle and the hands of Major James Sholto he had stayed alive, yet remained dead inside. He had felt that way for what could have been an eternity. And then, due to a meeting he hesitated to call destiny, he had risen. Now he was sitting here, in this overly expensive restaurant, and felt highly out of place, but at the same time didn't at all. Because opposite him sat the most fascinating and exciting creature he had ever had the good fortune to meet. He wouldn't want to be anywhere else. And that was all that counted.
They had reached the other side of the room. There was a little staircase that brought them to the second floor, which was just like a balcony along the whole side of the wall.
that allows mind to survive even when body succumbs. I am more than breath and blood, I exist, I am the monarch of my human mind." When he opened his eyes, they focused on John with the intensity of a rising sun. There was so much more in this gaze.
The only answer was a small nod. John drank his tea and waited. Keeping the conversation going was never an issue for them. They always found an interested party in the other to talk about anything that came to their minds, and even in their silence, there was comfort. It seemed only too ironic that now that there were so many words to be said none would come out. John depended on Sherlock's words, as always. But he would not find the first, so maybe John should help him.
He doesn't yet dare to think about what happened. (The rumble of Sherlock's voice against him as he was pressed against his chest, his wet cheeks covered by his own trembling hand, the slow rubs of comfort over his arm, his neck.) It's still too soon, too fresh. Even though it isn't too soon at all, but rather too late,
He eagerly threw on his suit jacket and his bowler hat and ran down the stairs till he was standing on the pavement.
John was still suspicious, of course he was. She had almost killed them multiple times. Where had she come from? How long had John been stuck in these chambers? For how long had he been unconscious?
upstairs suffers from a burn injury," he explained like John wouldn't know, and pronounced her being like it had offended him personally. "You are here to treat her, obviously, but there is more to it."
It did not take long for them to hire a cab, and barely a quarter of an hour had passed by the time the horses came to a halt. John helped her out of the hansom and took in his surroundings. They were standing on the footpath of a main street and the cab took off. The building in front of them had a red brownstone façade and black-framed sash windows. It towered upwards for about three or four floors and was roofed with dark grey slate. Right above the broad, wooden transom there was a dark green sign, labelled with golden letters that read
John cleared his throat roughly and pursed his lips as he calculated. Was she expecting him to be frightened of Moriarty as well? Or was she just testing him, trying to provoke the opposite? She was impossible to read, and he licked his lips as he realised he could probably only lose if he tried to play the game of lies and bluffs with her. So he decided he would not even start it.
Sherlock stopped for a minute. He was standing in the middle of the room, and with the cup and saucer in his hands, he looked like he was waiting for a guest who had long left his restaurant. A little bit beaten, his hair tussled, his eyes light blue. What had he done while John had been sleeping? Probably scouring more newspapers and old case files, running through a few calculations and pulling on his hair all night.
"Ah. But wait. How did you get a table within an hour, then?" He couldn't have planned this long beforehand, let along weeks before. Unless, of course, predicting the future was on the list of all his countless talents.
Sherlock. It couldn't be! This was the body he had left back. And in the center of him there was a blood pumping heart. It shone bright red, a burning sun made of ruby, just beneath his ribcage.
John had no doubt that it was certainly about this for Sherlock. But just as much as it had to be about taking back what was to be forever his.
John frowned in surprise. "Fragile is not exactly a term that has come up when I think of you, to be quite honest."
John could hear his own heart pumping with the intensity of two, even in a room full of noise. He wanted to say yes, more than anything, in fact. He would surely ridicule himself if he danced with him. He had seen how Sherlock had danced with Molly. He appeared to really be good at anything. But when he danced, he looked alive. He took John's breath away.
"Would you stop lingering at the door and come in?" On the last two words he tore the door open, and behind it stood one mildly startled Mycroft Holmes.
Sherlock swallows. It’s worse than he thought. He cannot deny that he likes John when he is on the right side of angry, but this is probably the wrong side and he is also being yelled at.
But he stopped as the ground underneath him shook and bestial sounds started filling the air. It was a cracking and snapping noise. It was the sound of tiny teeth and legs crawling over the floor. Just beneath the remains of Irene Adler dozens and dozens of black spiders scuttled out, turning the room dark and creating the illusion of an earthquake. They were thick and hairy, and they were coming for them! One of them was already up John's leg and he shook it with sudden panic until it fell off, but they grew and grew in numbers, countless as they were relentless. Irene had transformed into an endless stream of hunting spiders, and now John started panicking. He was not afraid of spiders. Having thousands of them coming for him, though, was also not exactly a dream come true. He hated losing track of his enemies, needed a clear aim he could fire at. In his mind's eye, he could already see himself breaking down and having this stream of vermin burying him underneath their tiny claws and clasping fangs.
What an irony it was then, that this secret war they were fighting behind the walls of London seemed to be quite profitable for the men and women the Order sacrificed knight after knight for. After all, the economy always benefited from a long, good war. And while a small number went into battle, most people, oblivious to this, were more interested in the technological improvements that it caused. Especially since they were living in a time that had already been forwardly given the title
John places another kiss just where jaw meets throat, open-mouthed and with the smallest hint of tongue, and Sherlock has to grip the arms of his chair to steady himself.
John was so absorbed in the article about the missing detective that he didn't notice the quiet figure approaching him and pulling back the chair on which Mary had sat minutes ago. The chair's legs scraped against the floor and his eyes finally focused on Mrs Hudson. She was watching him with interest, yet the look in her eyes differed immensely from the ones that everyone else had given him today.
He was absolutely dashing tonight. He wore black suit trousers, tightly and tailored, matching with his black jacket, which he fell over a dark green silken waistcoat, and a white neckcloth. Just
, and had given no other response to his request. But now he was doing that mouth thing from before again, practically giving himself away.
"What's going on?" he asked once he had made it to the back of the crowd where Mrs Hudson was standing with her arms crossed.
"My dear Kate," she started, honest affection and a certain roguishness ringing in her voice. Her gaze then shifted to him and, to his own surprise, a smile pulled at her red-painted lips. "My, my … and who have you brought me here?"
This earned a general quiet chuckle from the crowd and a louder, rough one from Moran. He had no choice. That had already been made for him. He threw a glance at Mrs Hudson, but she only looked at him with a face full of sympathy, her eyes saying:
“Nightmare again,” Sherlock explained into the silence. A silence filled with occasional sobs John failed to shove down. But it was fine now. He remembered. It was all fine now.
John goes over to the living room table. Then he stops in his tracks. It’s happened again, hasn’t it? More and more often he finds himself giving Sherlock silly petnames in his head. He was never a friend of those, can hardly explain why he is doing it now –
John had joined the knighthood with a fiancée, planning a marriage. He had left it without one, never to be married at all. The engagement had happened too fast, the bond too weak to bear the weight of his trauma. With her, he felt misunderstood in his sufferings. With him, she felt like she did not mean enough to be forever. She was right. They did not share what he shared with his comrades, did not feel the losses that brought John and them together. And nothing in the world had ever come close to what he shared with James Sholto.
John felt stuck in a dilemma. He wanted to help. Even if the person who required his help was an undead robot, currently watching his every move through his breast pocket. (And how he wished for this to only be a very odd kind of metaphor.) But if what Sherlock said was all true, he had to help. Since he had first heard of him a strong feeling had grown in his gut, advising him against believing in the good nature of James Moriarty and his intentions. From the moment he had first met him he would never have ruled out the possibility that he was more than just a businessman – not to mention that most businessmen had a touch of evil to them already.
In following Mary, John ends up in a curious place with a bunch of even more curious and lively people. As it turns out
"Oh, no, no, no. I am a utilitarian. Everyone has secrets. Therefore, everyone can be owned. Owning people equals immense power, you see."
A few people stepped aside like they had somehow rehearsed this beforehand, and from in between the little group emerged … Mrs Hudson! John's face decided to join Sherlock's widening eyes. (They made quite the pair now, looking like that.) First Jane, uh, Janine, and now Mrs Hudson! Who else was in on this conspiracy? And, more importantly, did John want to be a part of that? That had to be almost out of question. If sweet, innocent Mrs Hudson was here, the brave knight in rusty armor could stay, too.
, was his explanation, and John had decided that there was little else he could do but to believe him. It was settled that he had now mentally quitted working for this
Pale face, dark curls, he was lying there, sleeping and bleeding into the sand that soaked it up, all up. The blood ran across his face like a paintbrush full of water would leave its marks on canvas. Sherlock had always looked more like a piece of art than human. But oh, wasn’t he so very human? Just as he was lying here, bleeding out of his flesh and bones?
John only nodded somewhat absentmindedly. Only on second glance, he saw that there were not just the three of them in here.
. Of course, there is a lot more to being human than owning a functioning brain. Good Lord, are there many who possess the organ only for the echoes in their heads to not deafen their inner ears! But would you not say that your theory made any form of medical treatment just as wrong, just as unethical?" The colour in his eyes went from clouded grey to roaring blue, gleaming somehow, despite the mild light of an almost set sun. "I told you to think about it, did I not? Now, consider it – really consider it! What is so unhuman about it is the ability to
"I'm going to knock now," the inspector warned them, and John could practically feel how Sherlock rolled his eyes as he let out an exasperated sigh.
She stretched her arm out over the table for him again and her grin showed teeth. "Why, thank you. I chose everything myself. If you had seen this place before I got my hands on it, my, my."
"Nothing. We knew he would be here. He will probably soon step into the centre of everyone's attention all by himself. Then we can at least keep our eyes on him."
"You cannot be serious!" Molly burst out, her face a mixture of anger, of wild desperation and little hope.
Something struck him, then, and he was not sure if this thought was one that should be thought to the end. The war that he knew best, the one that he had fought in himself, the
"Hey! I've already said I have only just met him yesterday! I probably know far less than all of you combined!"
"More than just fucking," Sherlock says quietly but with a clarity that clearly surprises John. Maybe he let his voice go at least one octave deeper on purpose. And maybe he just got the idea of how flirting works. Flirting with John Watson.
The middle of the desert. He was back in Afghanistan, throat dry, stomach empty. He was hungry as death was hungry. Thirsty like the war craved for its victims.
Gone is the playful, flirtatious tone in his words, leaving nothing behind but an unexpected, stomach-dropping heaviness of rare emotion.
John's gaze hardened. In scepticism, in concern. "Well, we've still got some time left. Tell me now."
John shoved his way through the crowd while Sherlock quickly balanced over the seating rows of the stand. Suddenly someone was yelling, "That's Sherlock Holmes!" and the people weren't sure whether to scream or to applaud.
John woke up not knowing where he was. Not a single nightmare had dared to pay him a visit during the night. Admittedly, it had only been a rather short night for him. But either had he imagined it and played it in his mind from memory or there really had been the soft tunes of a violin rising and falling, lulling him through a slumber uninterrupted by the war he still fought in his head. In exchange for the calm of night, perhaps to maintain some universal balance, he woke up sitting bolt upright and sweating as a silent cry died on his tongue. When he tried to swallow, his throat felt as dry as dust. He looked around. The room felt unfamiliar but definitely inhabited, with walls full of certificates, tables and cut-out newspaper articles. Not the most personal decor but it did paint a story. It could only be the room of Sherlock Holmes. Now John remembered.
His eyes were hit by the glowing red light. His heart seemed to have expanded in his chest with each,
"You have space up in there to care about mythology?" John pointed at his curly head. Sherlock was usually much more selective of the kind of information he chose to store.
He must notice how John is only blushing more deeply. How? How did he say that out loud without noticing? How the bloody hell could he?
Lestrade did not look happy either. "I will be right beside you then." He took out a pair of handcuffs.
He got to his feet and took the leash. "We're taking him with us," he informed Lestrade in a tone that allowed no room for an argument.
Before he answered him, he looked around, turned his head to Lestrade and his officers, to the birds in the sky, to the greying hairs on John's head. Only then he could lock eyes with him again.
But now there was another persona making her way through John's thoughts, and, speaking of witchcraft, this was undeniably how they had met. Sherlock had not told anybody of those circumstances, and John was sure he had very good reasons not to do so. But it felt wrong to not at least leave a hint that there was something rather off with Irene Adler.
) and then with broad, silly grins on their faces like this was a joke only the two of them could understand.
“That wasn’t a compliment, you madman. We’re gonna get out of here now, and you’re gonna help Greg with the paperwork, you hear me?”
Once more he heard his voice in his head, as he had in so many nightmares, crying out his name when it had been his time of bleeding out beneath him. John, shaking with anger and sorrow, ripped one of the buttons from his shirt in his attempt to bring to light the necklace he had worn day and night since it had been given to him. The metal read in its engraving the name of the man dying in his arms.
"Are there a lot of people waiting?" he asked, getting up from his chair, for his back was already complaining, and stretched his arms to loosen his stiff muscles.
"Finding your heart?" John finished. He could feel the heart then. Not in its absence, nor in its presence, but rather in its sole existence out there,
John was pulled from the limbs of his dead major by Sherlock with one arm, trying not to hurt him with his broken one. His mind could not grasp it. He could not understand the danger they were facing. Sherlock pulled on him and somehow his body cooperated, wobbly legs and longing arms reaching for the one on the ground.
"I'd rather not have it where I can't see it." Leaving his best jacket unattended in a crowded environment like this hardly seemed like a good idea. There was also the matter of his illegal revolver in the pocket of that jacket.
The detective looks at him with an expression so full of shock, as if John hugging him would have never been a possibility he could have reckoned with. But here they are.
Sherlock took a deep breath and braced himself. The first item on the list today was a hard one. "Before we move on-"
John breaks the kiss with a sigh. A long, dreamy sigh Sherlock has trouble interpreting correctly. Is it regret? Relief? Pity? But as he closes his eyes in silence, he brings their foreheads together and leans against him. They stay like this for what seems like minutes over minutes, and it should be uncomfortable, should feel ridiculous - with one of them undressed and the two of them panting against each other - but it doesn’t. They breathe together in unison, and when John draws back to look at him, his eyes don’t show anger, aren’t predatory. They are warm, they are gentle.
. Then John's eyes finally caught hold of the one gentleman who stood out, crossing the street to get to their building. He wore a top hat that he had pulled down to cover his face and in his arms he held a little striped cat.
His eyes are boring into Sherlock’s own and electrify the space between them, the air they breathe. Sherlock swallows, once more, but his throat is dry and he is thirsty. He is cold, goosebumps all over his body from the river water and those ocean eyes, but his skin is hot with anticipation.
"Wonderful! I have to say, I never doubted you for a second, my boy!" he spoke to him in varying tones, all of them too over the never-to-be-reached top because this man did not seem to know what limits were. He continued. "In that case, I'd say that Mr Sebastian Moran here, and I, are ready to see you in my study. So that we can discuss what will now happen to you..."
"I also knew – as did you, Sherlock – what he was hoping to accomplish through the world of magic. I saw the bodies piling, each in their separate shells, conserved and waiting for him to be ready. To resurrect them. But there was one body, a female, that was not in a shell. She swam in a tank."
– for now I knew the weight of a sacrifice. I was too weak to bear it. That's when he found me again."
"And the … wait. Oh God." Now the smile fell from John's face. "We left her behind! God, she will never make it out alive."
"Well, yes but…" Sherlock has trouble finding a response to this. Sometimes he wishes John wouldn’t be smarter than he looks. "This is not a crime scene, John! This is about hair-braiding. Simply observing what is in front of you and replicating what you see. Even apes can do that!"
Now Sherlock interfered, eyes glowing with rage. "Maybe by actually doing my bloody work, for God's sake, instead of whatever useless impact you have had on the world in the meantime!"
"It's okay," Sherlock assures him once more. He has already tried to tell him so a few days ago when John finally broke down.
He knew Sherlock was watching him. He could feel his gaze piercing him. Maybe he was expecting him to cry. Oh, and how badly John wanted to cry.
If dying was possible for me, it would be of boredom!" He made another series of dramatic hand gestures while he was waiting for him by the chair John had sat in last night. Then he suddenly told him, "Here!" and whipped off his goggles to toss them in his direction. "Put that to the rest of my equipment."
Now that reduced John to speechlessness. There was such logic in those words that he could not think of a single argument to object to it, and by God, he wasn’t sure he would want to. John had always believed that the value of a human life couldn't be exceeded by anything. That there could be nothing more exceptional, nothing more worth saving. All this time he had never thought to ask himself what that even meant, to be human. To be
Mycroft closed his eyes to keep himself from rolling them. "I was wrong," he whispered. "Caring might be to your advantage. And that knight fellow of yours … He might just save the both of you."
He kept his grip on the back of Magnussen's collar as they walked through the halls of the underground. They passed by other cells, empty ones, some of them displaying bodily remains of some kind. Others had a sharp stinge to them, one of faeces and decay. John never ceased to keep an eye out for movements from the shadows, anticipating. It was quiet, safe for the echoes of their steps and the noise of water dripping from somewhere.
Warm blood mixed with saliva was dripping onto his cheek, running down his chin and he shivered. Those dead eyes probably scared him the most. This pure nothingness that seemed so useless, so wasted. Was that really all they could be? Their true form? He waited. He waited and waited, for seconds –
The rope tightened and they were both shooting higher up into the air. John held onto Sherlock because his life depended on it, and because he was all he had left. They reached the top and were greeted by a very surprised sniper who immediately attempted to kick them right off again. John, still trying to climb onto the roof and get on his feet, grabbed the foot that was about to hit his face and pulled it down as hard as he could. The creature fell off with a scream that ended when he hit the bottom. Sherlock offered his hand as John looked back up and together they pulled him over the edge of the roof. Sherlock's other hand was still just one long rope with a hook on it.
he thought, thinking of all the horrors he had seen and shared with the other members of the Order. All of them had seen it. All of them had lost the same amount of men, women, friends, companions to cold death and its monsters.
Sherlock studied his back profile. The bowler hat covered most of John’s sandy grey hair but his silhouette remained the same. Steady, a strong rock in the waters. The way he held himself spoke of military experience but also of so much more. It told whole stories about the weight on his shoulders and the paths he chose to take. The mistakes he thought to have made and the strength to keep on the same path and walk through the pain against it all. Looking up, the sky was all colourless and cloudy, but there was light, always light trying to break through. Sighing, Sherlock took out his pocket watch to check the time.
He can clearly hear him pant behind him, not unaffected by what he is doing to him, which is calming, if not also confusing.
John saw what she meant. His expression in itself displayed the inner conflict he must have felt. About to tell John of an action in his past he was less than proud of, felt perhaps even shame and remorse towards. But now there was a third party. A party that also cared a whole lot about him. A party that also deserved the truth. Now Sherlock Holmes had to make another choice. It was obvious that he was debating, heart against head. But well... heart?
It looked like the inside of a church. Maybe it was. Maybe they did pray here. Seating rows to the left and right made of red wood, ceiling high and adorned with paintings of angels. The windows wore colourful patterns that the sunlight threw across the tiles. At the end of the room, one man stood tall, watching Jesus Christ on his cross as if it were only a matter of time until he would free himself and come back to life.
"But he needs them all to come, to watch... something. If he searched for an opportunity to reveal this something, this has to be it. I'm sure of it!"
It’s Sherlock about to give a blowjob in DI Lestrade’s office. Obviously, this stupid idea involves John. Hence, giving him joy will give Sherlock
He fished the ear out of his pocket and held it out for Sherlock to take back, which he immediately did, and soon he had as many ears as he had eyes and hands again.
"But you- you can find her, Mr Holmes?" The shoved-out client, Alex, tries to look over Sherlock’s shoulder a few times, his face searching John’s for reassurance, but Sherlock positions himself between them now, blocking Alex’s view."Yes, yes, of course, we’ll inform you when we’ve solved it. Good day." He tries to shut the door in front of his face, and Alex raises his voice for John to hear him, "Bye, John, was very nice to meet you," but John only sees his hand awkwardly waving over Sherlock’s head.
The elderly lady that was awaiting them behind the transom was wearing a smile that felt so refreshing to John that it made him realise he had not seen an expression so genuine in quite a while now. It made him want to smile back at her, and that feeling on his face appeared to be almost foreign. John liked her in an instant, which was quite remarkable.
A knock on the door. John's heart jumped as he turned his head in Mrs Hudson's direction as she entered. When he turned again, Sherlock was gone. Somehow he was sitting in his chair again, the same position he had admired earlier. Mrs Hudson brought with her a tray full of biscuits.
Sherlock took a deep breath. "Lestrade and I have made a deal a long while ago. I used to solve cases for him – still do, in fact – but things became … stranger around London. He and I both noticed. Whenever they couldn't make sense of a crime committed, they consulted me, but Lestrade was the only officer smart enough to know that when even I failed to connect the dots, because there
consulting detective, not to stimulate a bored brain. This isn't just about a case or the work. This is about his life, his own future. This isn't about him serving as a brain and brilliant mind that everyone can see (obviously - they are not
John huffed a laugh. "I'm still not so sure about that." He looked down at his plate and found that he wasn't hungry anymore. Well, or maybe he was. Just not for food. "And what do you do?"
"Do you have any other abilities?" she asked with a hint of keen amusement in her voice as he came back with the bandages.
The Woman shrunk down, teeth disappearing, and she gulped once. Her eyes turned back from black to blue and her teeth were purple with blood. Her jaw made a cracking sound as it was growing back together. In her naked form, she sank to her knees in complete exhaustion. She sat on her feet just where Eurus had enjoyed her victory over humanity, and was it not sweet, sweet irony to see that same humanity saved by something the humans feared so much? She brushed her hand over the wounds on Moriarty's face and took one of his hands in hers.
There was something about Sherlock that made John suddenly understand why he did what he did. He had him on the edge of his seat with his story as if selling him an adventure. But Sherlock Holmes was not a salesman either. He was a consulting detective. The way he was sitting, the way he was moving, the cleverness of him. The long legs, now enfolded and spread in front of him, svelte fingers under his nose, this pair of blue eyes shining bright. This was his element. The crumbs he fed on, that gave him life, were made of death.
He cannot remember ever having been so far out of his own comfort zone. Not that he wouldn't be comfortable right now, he is more than oblivious to all but one craving that his brain is aiming all its focus at. But he has never known that he could. That he would actually be able to distance himself so much from his pokerfaced, controlled, calculating persona that he has spent years and years to create around his frightened form.
"Sherlock? Oh, this sounds a bit forward, don't you think? I wouldn't want him to worry too much right now."
He was holding on tightly, wrapping his arms around John's neck and his lanky pair of legs around his waist as his body threatens to sink deeper still. But just then John grabbed him even harder, and his fingers digging into his arse, parting cheeks as he tried to hold him and turn them around. Sherlock could feel his cock pulsing impossibly hard as his hole was stretching, and pain and pleasure turned into a boiling cocktail that made goosebumps run over every inch of skin.
There is not one hint of bite in his tone, all soft and slightly amused by nothing in particular. The doctor presses one last kiss into the still moist mess of curls and gives his biceps a suggestive squeeze before he removes himself.
"As a warning. To threaten the ones who knew into silence, and to create more terror and fear. And that's how we know it was part of Moriarty's work. He needs the brains and the hearts of his victims, so everything below the chest area isn't useful to him."
John needed a second to take a breath. Sure, he was used to the challenge that some called darkness, some mystery, others hell. He couldn't be sure where he would get himself into, mentally, and where he would land when exposed to it for too long. The enemy always lingered behind the veil of the dark, and it was known to be relentless.
looked around this flat in the past years? There are piles of magazines in the corners of every room, there is a Cluedo board pinned to the wall by me, I leave my things wherever I please, the kitchen is a mess of syringes and human body parts – an organised and well structured mess if you know where to look, but not the point right now – and I am currently examining maggots. In contrast to this you, John Watson, are a doctor, you wear your chequered shirts buttoned up to your chin, you’ve lived a clean life not suffering from a drug addiction, have had girlfriends and relationships and altogether live as part of the middle-class society in Central London. You wish for a wife and children and probably a German Shepard and a house in the suburbs, or at least that’s what you think you want, so tell me, John: How am
The smooth fabric of John’s shirt and the rough one of his jeans that presses against the lower part of his body. Against his thighs and hipbones and the growing bulge in his pants. John’s one hand is rubbing back and forth over his inner thigh and the soft spot where it dissolves into firm buttocks. A soft spot that draws a quiet whine from the back of his throat. He places his other hand on his face to hold him. Lifting his jaw ever so slightly, his thumb is stroking over one sharp cheekbone, and he kisses him again.
The giant cat's fur was already covered in blood. Its jaw was so strong it was able to crack bones and kill instantly.
, a sceptical, quiet voice wonders somewhere in the back of Sherlock's head, but he shoots it down and for a short, breathtaking moment his mind just shuts. It's so quiet, a quiet Sherlock cannot remember having experienced for … ever, actually. And it's so,
John gave a laugh, an actual laugh, as he realised just how ridiculous this conversation was becoming.
"Right. So. Among all the things there was that video you made for me. You know, the one with the cheap excuse for why you couldn't come to my birthday dinner and said that none of my friends like me? But yeah, the uncut version of that video."
Moriarty threw his hand up to shield the back of his head. He looked over his shoulder, observed the bullet stuck inside his hand and finally saw what John had now pointed his weapon at. Eurus was behind him! Moriarty pulled the silver bullet out of his hand, revealing wires that sprayed sparks. He met eyes with her through the hole in his palm. So he had made part of himself into a cyborg!
James grasped the dogtag with the last remaining strength and huffed a laugh. John, despite it being the last thing he felt like doing, joined him, smiling. He wrapped his hand around James's and they both kept hanging onto the warm metal.
As far as he remembered the plan was to get in touch as soon as something seemed off or noteworthy. A spontaneous ball at The Prof was definitely both of those things. How could she not think so?
"Lucky for us, I have already mixed such a poisonous emulsion for precisely this kind of opportunity. As it is, Doctor, you are a true conductor of light at this moment. In the literal sense."
He has lowered his newspaper, so that he can give him a once-over, which makes Sherlock feel as naked as he just has been barely ten minutes ago. At least he did have the decency to put on a dressing gown (the blue one, his and John's favourite, he had deduced this quite a while ago), but right now that does not help at all.
John held himself back from asking how he would know, but then remembered who he was talking to. He would find his way to let him know, of this he was certain. He couldn't even say goodbye before Sherlock had crossed the street and was wrapped in this odd gleam of shadows and mystery again that John was unable to take his eyes off. He looked after him with what could only be a silly little smile on his lips, and Sherlock's coat flapped dramatically in the wind as he disappeared around the corner. Oh, he knew he was looking after him. He must have. He was trying to impress.
She looked hurt. John wished he could have told her, but then again, this wouldn't have been fair. He watched Sherlock’s mouth open and close again as he began to form what looked like it could have the potential to be an apology.
Before John had even processed everything Sherlock had just said, an answer had already slipped from between his lips. "Alright. Yes, why not?" He blinked a few times and there was another question rising up. "But how-"
He tries to thrust up into his fist, but Sherlock lets go of him again, causing him to make a frustrated noise exposing his obvious desires. Sherlock lifts his head and leans down between his legs until his lips ghost over his frenulum. When John pushes up against them, it almost seems like a question, and he inhales the scent of him that starts to cloud his mind. In the midst of his daze, he opens his mouth and licks one long stripe from shaft to tip.
To feel the core of John's very arousal and of everything he is able to do to him, is allowed to, is meant to, pressed to him reawakens a craving that has been repressed within him since he has first noticed the way John walks
"Well, of course not immediately. The most important factor for the healing process is rest and protection. As little walking as possible to limit the weight-bearing. But I think I might still apply a compression to control the swelling." He got up and walked towards one of the cupboards where he kept medical bags and bandages.
Charles Magnussen frowned. He had not expected this from John. But John had seen how easy it was to put two and two together sometimes. He wondered if Sherlock Holmes would have smiled at him with pride.
"Yes, yes, of course, we’ll inform you when we’ve solved it. Good day." He tries to shut the door in front of his face, and Alex raises his voice for John to hear him, "Bye, John, was very nice to meet you," but John only sees his hand awkwardly waving over Sherlock’s head.
"You have already died once, Sherlock," John breathed in awe and despair. "You are not going to die on me, too."
"I-I'm sorry, Kitty, but Mary's part is something we have never rehearsed before. You don't always have to be so impatient with us."
him. When you talk about my brother, you are talking about him in the present tense. Interesting. Almost as if you didn't believe that he should be dead."
The detective slid his coat over his shoulders and let it fall to the floor to turn into a sad looking pile of clothing. He walked past him and sunk into his chair, his hands and fingers against his lips as if to pray, and closed his eyes. John came closer on silent feet and stood by the other chair for a little while. Watching him like this, he could have been nothing more than a cyborg, John thought. Smooth, pale face, a posture too elegant to not be rehearsed, a peace to those closed eyes that could not be worn by any other man, for they had worries and engravings of a life that was impossible not to show. He could hardly have been real.
The one snapping was redheaded with a long nose and pink lips. The girl that was being accused of incompetence had hair as black as a raven, and her fringe fell over her forehead in a row of corkscrew curls.
A muffled groan was heard and something was stretching. Still hidden in the shadows, still looming in darkness. John thought about bending down to pick up the torch from where it had fallen, not far from his right foot. But he didn't want to take the risk of looking away, of giving up his position, should it decide to then take advantage in the moment of distraction. His nerves wouldn't calm, facing all the possibilities his wanton imagination drew for him in his mind's eye, and he found himself shouting.
. Oh, how pathetic he has become. Maybe this could be a reason for John to apologise for. Having stolen the heart of a man, who has once lived for cold reason and work, when he has no use for it anyway. No, Sherlock already feels worse for having thought such a thing. It is his own fault after all. All of it. He got involved. He should've known better than to let his stupid heart rule his head.
, something whispered to him. Somewhere in the distance he heard the crow's cry again. Walking between white pillars to the yard of the museum complex, eyes sharp, ears on alert, the realisation came to him naturally.
"Black magic can't help but bite back sooner or later," she went on. "The reason for his success and your failure, Sherlock? He read the books that were forbidden to him. Books that took you way too long to believe in. One of the few mistakes you made, darling."
But on those lonely, cold winter evenings, when the fire is cracking and the air smells like burned wood and the very unique odour of the flat, he feels repulsion. It is a false smell without John here. It should never smell like this when he isn't here. Sherlock wants to forbid the universe, the physics, all the air around him to lull him into this illusion of his own senses still. It would only cause the lump in his throat to grow further.
The image of it was quite sharp. There was just a drop of purple liquid on white ground. But when he concentrated and looked closely, he could see that there was movement to it. "It's moving?"
There isn't enough oxygen in the room for his brain to keep on functioning, or so he feels, and he is sure what he is feeling right now is neither rage nor relief but the threatening signs of a panic attack. Sherlock stretches his hand out to reach for him, maybe to catch him if he fell, and it requires all the strength still left in his body to not slam it away.
But he is faster than John can give him credit for and closes the door just in time. Only a second later, they hear the voices of Greg Lestrade and Sally Donovan.
He turned around to face her, and she looked to the left and to the right. "Has he run off already?"
With a bemused smile John watched as the crease of irritation between Sherlock's brows deepened. Under different circumstances – if he were human, for example – he would be on his landlady's side without question. He was sure the man with long gowns and pretty eyes was the most insufferable of tenants and roommates. Rarely found sleeping, rambling at all hours, keeping vampyre blood and God knew what else in the kitchen, going on and on about murder and mayhem. All in all, he sounded like … Yes, what did it sound like?
"Actually, I think this is more of a meteor shower. I mean, there are lots of them up there. Haven't seen something like that in decades. Maybe we're having a special night or..." John lets his gaze wander to the brilliant view he is talking about. He begins to feel much less pressured when he is avoiding thinking about being the centre of Sherlock's attention. But soon, Sherlock follows his lead and watches the sky just as closely.
. He imagined Sherlock would have planned something dramatic. A stone with a message attached flying through his window and breaking glass, a masked person entering the house and whispering the address to him – or even knocking him out and kidnapping him to the restaurant!
"Yes. This is what I do." He repeated, and took another sip of wine. It ran down his throat and left a somewhat bitter taste with a hint of fruit, subtly rising to his head and made it lighter. Made his smiles even less rare, kept him from hiding it so often. Made his eyes shine brighter.
Sherlock Holmes suddenly wore a teeth-baring smile on his face. It made the skin around his eyes crinkle and form broad laugh lines, transforming his whole appearance. (How could there be laugh lines? How could there be skin?)
John definitely eyes him up and down and up and down again, and he definitely looks pleased with what he sees. Why does this cause a rather pleasant twitch in Sherlock's gut?
"I didn't. Never with a clear head, at least. Sleeping always means giving up control over myself. I used to only do so when I decided to do it actively. When I wasn't on a case, I worked on something else. Like tinkering. But that... that's not really important."
It was a surprise, therefore, that Sherlock's next words had absolutely nothing to do with what he had said to him just a minute ago.
Sherlock had drifted off there a little and John tried to bring him back by putting a hand to his arm. The detective stopped, blinking down rapidly as if he was only seeing him for the first time and asked himself what this stranger was doing in his kitchen. John stood up from the chair, but Sherlock's body was so close that there wasn't much space left between him and the table. By getting up he almost knocked over the open jar with the maggots. Fortunately, he did not.
But in the distance, John heard another sound, over the cries and gun shots that echoed through the night. The sound of hooves clopping.
"So … Moriarty?" John asked roughly, attempting to draw his focus back to the main problem at hand. This one, highly important problem.
While they were here, Irene Adler was attending a meeting at the Diogenes Club. Since she had defeated (or devoured) the vampyre's initial queen, she had gained a rank of respect and authority over them. They were intelligent but they were still a huge pack, demanding a purpose in life and for someone to give that to them. The counting of their losses and the understanding of the Moriarty sibling's madness had made them see the world clearer. Irene was aiming to negotiate the terms of peace between the humans and the inhuman, hoping that one day they may live side by side. It would take time to eliminate the prejudices and let history be history, but they wanted to begin by tearing down the wall around the city piece by piece, stone by stone. But, as Mycroft had put it, the people still demanded that justice follow. James Moriarty had to be hanged from the gallows.
John brought their foreheads together, tears still dripping from the tip of his nose. "I'll show you."
John looks surprised for a moment, frowning at him, but then a broad smile breaks this expression and only leaves something that makes Sherlock's heart grow and press against his rips. "Alright then," he whispers, his voice almost breathless. "You know where to find me." And with this, he retreats.
"Alright, I get it," John said, taking a step back to let Sherlock rearrange his workplace. The lazy git could have walked over here in the first place, he realised, but decided not to mention it. "What happened to the others?"
John had the advantage of fitness and instinct. Mr Stripes had the advantage of knowing these rooms inside out. Turning around the next corner, John scanned the room. It was empty. Only him and the people in the paintings that looked back at him with critical eyes. If the man was hiding in this room, John would find him eventually. No, if he really wanted to get away where would he have gone?
. Sherlock gasps for air like a man drowning. Every time John pulls out, he is hit with yet more arousal. Trying to push back, trying to make him do it faster.
Only seconds later, he hears how the bathroom door quietly closes and steps coming closer, but he just tries to press his head deeper into the blue fabric. A low chuckle finally throws him out of his sleepy state. Because he recognises the voice and suddenly he is wide awake and the smell around him is even stronger than before.
The topic changed as quickly as Sherlock's temper. The mask was back and carefully placed on the handsome features of his face, straightening him.
"Oh!" is what John has to say when the tip of his head disappears inside of him. He can feel it throbbing to the rhythm of his heartbeat. He thinks. He hopes. He hopes it can feel like they're not two people at all but one, someday. He knows he doesn't make sense and decides to not give the slightest fuck about it. (Perhaps not the best way of saying he doesn't care, given his current situation.)
"They are certainly taking their time!" Sherlock was attacked from both sides and shoved the one from him while the other was trying to bite his neck before realising he hit a bunch of wires. He shot the first one in the face and met the other with his elbow before John kicked his feet away and his sword pierced the heart as the vampyre lay flat on the stones. Ten others followed one dead beast, and even though one knight fell after twenty vampyres had fallen before them, it wasn't looking too good. They shot back and bit back, and knights around them were dying and screaming. Slowly, Piccadilly Circus filled with blood. Even the fountain water couldn't wash it away.
John let out an affectionate huff and set foot to follow. He was wondering if Sherlock had simply forgotten that John had offered for him to use his name or if he actually liked calling him
John had to hope it was only the painting they were talking about (but a small part of him wished if wasn’t).
These times are long over now, luckily, but John’s heavy sigh still doesn’t feel good at all and puts a weight on his shoulders that he has tried to shake for quite some time.
John knew about this briefly, of course, but he had always tried to ignore what was being played out behind closed curtains. Had always tried to tell himself
Her giggles filled the room again before she took the offered hand. She didn't seem reluctant in the slightest to sit here in her short dress and let John talk and look at her from in between her legs while treating her injured ankle while they were … were they flirting with each other?
. This was something else indeed. Something else that was happening to him. Here, in the basement of this strange lady. Today, on behalf of the professor everyone else feared. And still, he had not cared. Blindly, ignorantly had he followed his addiction without arriving anywhere, and now, now for the first time, he found himself speechless. Moved. Absolutely stripped of anything he thought was left of him these days, simply by this man's words that contained his own former glory. It was not only about being read. It was also about being
John’s heart skips several beats as he hears quick steps coming closer. This is not good, not good at all, with them still standing and kneeling in an open locker in Greg’s office.
„Well,“ that seemed to have bewildered the man, not knowing what to say, and he may have unconsciously taken a step back, „My granddaughter surely is a very vigorous little creature. But imagining her firing off weapons in the field? Oh no. No, no, no. Poor girls are not made for war, my friend, you will certainly agree to that?“
"Oh no!" She huffed out a sigh and a laugh. "There is still a lot to do for me before we open. This is going to be fun for you tomorrow, Dr Watson. Your first proper day! One of the best things about working here is that you get to enjoy a free show full of dancing and magic every night. Some tricks are going to take your breath away!"
Her eyes spoke of surprise, and she looked like she was going to say something but decided to let it go at the last second.
Now it dawned on him. It dawned on him the second his own name slipped through Sherlock's lips. "He took control over her. But how is this even possible?"
Sherlock swallows, Adam's apple bobbing. "That's really nothing to be ashamed of, John. Everyone needs help sometime-"
John was supporting almost all of Sherlock's weight as he was hurrying them through the chambers. He wondered briefly if Sherlock knew this place better than he did. He remembered the patterns of the black stones, the artificial light of the shark tank, the flat faces watching. He remembered the glow from the room in which Magnussen had met his end, whatever that meant for the man. And he just wondered, not that it mattered, if Sherlock had seen all of this before. He did not care but he forced himself to think about anything, anything else, and so he kept on wondering. If he had worked here, so close and yet far away from Baker Street, against his will. Or maybe not entirely against his will. He knew that there were times where he had wanted to die.
They instantly jumped away from each other and turned around to find Lestrade and his officers strolling into the room. John cleared his throat a little too loudly, not knowing how much they had seen. But to answer Lestrade's question in his own head: Oh yes. He felt like he had found everything.
"Even better! You would not believe what kind of strange people come in and go out way later than preferable sometimes."
) must have felt in the one moment, from the very first second when the feeling would sink in, to the when he finally realised it was too late. The moment James Sholto had found him bleeding out on the dirty ground. He didn't want to think about the sight that at other occasions he would have craved, treasured. The sight of the mask shattering, desperation clinging to his voice as he yelled out and shot the monster that did this to him.
"This devilish harlot! Oh, John, you must excuse my tongue, but I had hoped she wouldn't go that far."
"Of course. You can be..." John's eyes dropped to the full pair of lips in front of him and up again to eyes as blue as the sky after a storm. "...quite clever."
"Here we are," John repeated after him to confirm it for himself. Was this what the world gave you when it received your complaint about your dull life? It seemed so cruel.
"Live with the consequences of our actions, you mean?" Sherlock sat down on his own chair. He still enjoyed how the fire crackled in his ear and warmed his body. You only know what to treasure once you have lost is, is that not so?
John rubbed his closed eyes with the balls of his hands. This mystery named Sherlock Holmes and James Moriarty and Irene Adler and who else might be hanging onto this chain of strange and sudden circumstances. So he had been mistaken all this time? Evil would always be a part of this city, and no knighthood, no organisation, however strong, could prevent invaders from invading.
Sherlock's eyes dropped down and he was studying the table's surface absently. "Funny," he said, not amused at all. "I think that the idea that you have implanted in me has broken me. Never to care about anything at all. I was taught to be this way since I was a child. Now the inside matches the outside."
John dared to close his eyes. The touch rose the hairs on the back of his neck and he gave in to this feeling. In all their years of unspoken adoration and keeping each other warm with barely any contact, they had never shared much of each other. Knights did not embrace. It was too late for them now. They both knew it was too late.
Within seconds John had jumped to his feet, run out of his prison, taken Magnussen's crowbar with both hands and pushed him into the wall behind him, iron pressed against his throat. He had to look up to the tall man from the underside of Magnussen's jaw, but John had no problem demonstrating which one of them called the shots.
John twisted her arm lightly and sterilized the other side of the wound. He could feel her muscles twitch at the sting, but it did not show on her face in the slightest. That was when he decided to simply ask right away.
. John's jaw dropped in shock as he stared at the detatched ear in his palm. Then he closed his eyes and let out a more or less relieved sigh as he remembered that Sherlock had a tendency to remove body parts at a whim.
Thirty minutes later, everyone had gone back to work. John had run off to hide in one of the rooms where they kept the costumes after he had finally been allowed to leave the stage. His head was still buzzing. Maybe some fresh air would clear his foggy mind. But before he could make it to the hallway of the main entrance to go outside, a small boy with long curly hair came running around the corner.
Sherlock, being there, right in front of him in the door frame on his knees. He also realises that he is now in the perfect position to kick him in his pretty face. Sherlock's voice sounds unusually thin and breakable as he says those next words.
They lock eyes, suddenly, unexpectantly, and his heart skips a beat in response to the sheer power of the bond they share. It knocks him right out of reality and brings him back with the renewed realisation that he is alive.
He doesn't. Has no clue. If he wouldn't still be pretty invested in the simple task of gaining back his common sense, he would probably even feel very self-conscious and maybe think about sulking about it for at least a week. He must look embarrassing. How could he let John see him like this? How is he not disgusted or shocked by this sight? But in fact, he even looks only more turned on, and that makes something inside of Sherlock feel impossibly warm and sends a light shiver down his spine, knowing he has done this to John, knowing the hunger in that dark blue pair of eyes is meant for him, and with that thought all the rationality gets blown away once more in an instance.
Then John bid her to sit down on the couch, the injury on her foot already obvious to him, now that he had seen the woman walk. Mary Morstan complied, and he caught her round pair of eyes roaming down his body before she stepped around the doctor's couch and seated herself. John rolled up his sleeves to put on a pair of rubber gloves. "Would you mind taking off your shoes and coat, Ms Morstan?"
"You were kidnapped twice during the last forty-eight hours, endured life as James Moriarty's prisoner one night and day, followed by the introduction to my insufferable brother. Are
By the time he was leaving The Prof, the sun was already starting to set on the far horizon, bathing the London skyline in a soft orange. Sunrays were breaking through the rosy-tinted blanket of clouds, and they were falling through them in straight lines like they were aching to touch the ground. The sky improved John's mood a little, and he hailed a cab. In it, he took the ear out of his coat pocket and looked at it with slight suspicion from where it was placed in both his palms. He knew Sherlock had a pretty sharp sense of hearing. Could he hear the wheels of the hansom turning? The hooves clattering, the horses snorting? Could he hear John's steady breath or the rustling of his clothes? The
There was a rather modern looking reception desk, unoccupied and he walked past a framed painting of some waterfall. He was dragged out of his thoughts when Mary started speaking again. He had almost forgotten her, however odd that was, for he was carrying half of her weight.
"I'm not- please, I know what this sounds like. I am not trying to lecture you, to criticise your work. Alright, perhaps that last one, a tad. But what I am actually trying to tell you is ... I do know what happens when one is playing the hero. I have experienced it, I have seen deaths, and many. Deaths that could have been so easily prevented. It was the hardest part of my job in the knighthood. To see men die, good men, women, and tell my troop they had died for a greater cause when I knew with every cell in my body that they have not. If only everyone had played by the rules."
