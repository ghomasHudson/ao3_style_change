, so it’s not as though he’s got something better to do. This whole “traditional family Christmas” deal that John has been going on about (and Sherlock has been dreading from the moment he first brought it up)… well, Sherlock is actually finding it surprisingly unobjectionable so far.
John has to hurt himself to keep looking at her. There’s no direct challenge in her gaze, no clear derision or rejection, but he feels it all the same and he has to clear his throat before he is able to reply. He nods, not able to speak after all.
“You follow him around everywhere. You’ve followed him around for years. You’ve just spent three days sleeping on a plastic chair in a hospital just to watch over him. You do all that, knowing he wouldn’t do the same in return?”
There’s a slightly uncomfortable pause for a couple of seconds.
The prompt for this chapter is "And to all a good night". The prompts have come from the 2019 Advent Ficlet Challenge, posted by missdaviswrites on Tumblr! Thank you so much for the challenge and the prompts!
how he longs to cling on to his logic and everything connected with that – his sharp mind, his cases, his whole identity as the genius without a heart – and just let go of his emotions and everything connected with that – his too-vulnerable ego, his depressions, his whole identity as the man who only ever pretends not to care because admitting that it hurts is too difficult. He could do it. Throw his emotions aside, become the calculating machine he so longs to be. A flick of a switch. That’s all he’d have to do.
“I’m sorry. It was… it was stupid of me. Dangerous. I shouldn’t have, I just…”
When Sherlock drifts off to sleep, his breathing slow and steady, and John puts the book down. And he allows himself to just observe Sherlock for a moment, let his gaze wander over his exposed face and arm, the contours of his body beneath the duvet. His chest going up and down.
“Alone?”
Sherlock huffs in a mixture of frustrated shock and shocked frustration. “But why is
Finally, chapter 18! And on the day of Sherlock and John's first meeting, no less!
“Well, you’re a bit late.”
And here we are! Chapter 16. This is a bit of a transitional chapter, marking the entry into the second part of the story. As such, it is a lot slower and less dramatic than the last one. I hope you will all bear over with me on this one and enjoy the slower pace.
There’s nothing he can do for Sherlock.
when he’s with Sherlock.
He genuinely is trying. He knows, objectively, that the doctors are doing all that they can. It’s not their fault that it apparently isn’t good enough. Everything that can be done is already being done, Mycroft has made sure of that. If anyone can do anything at this point, it’s Sherlock himself and no one else.
John chuckles slightly and takes a moment to consider his reply. He once again attempts to warm his hands on his coffee, but it remains a bit too heated for comfort.
“It was not your fault, John," he says. He means it. "It was not your fault. If you hadn’t left then, maybe it would have been different. But I asked you to leave, knowing how I felt and knowing what I might do in your absence. It was my responsibility. Mine alone. I can’t undo what happened afterwards, but it was not your fault. You did your best and more. You couldn’t have prevented it. And Moriarty… that was not your fault either and I didn’t say it was. I said it was partly because of you and that’s true. You were gone. In my head, you were gone. I couldn’t bring you forward, I couldn’t visualise you into existence. You were gone and all I knew was that time seemed to pass and you didn’t show up. And I… I was lonely!” he finally admits. “I was lonely because you weren’t there and you weren’t coming. I needed you there, your presence mattered to me, but you weren’t there! When Jim turned up, I was desperate for some companionship. You don’t know what it’s like, to not be able to get out, to not be able to communicate with anyone, to watch people pass by outside, but it’s just window dressing, all of it, and you can’t hear them and they can’t hear you! So I accepted what he offered! I know I should not have, but I did! It wasn’t your fault, but it was at least partly about you! And when I had to make the final decision, it… it was between you or him and I… I chose you!”
It’s so quiet. Sherlock dimly registers the sounds of traffic and city life intruding upon his silent bubble from the outside. But it all sounds muffled and vague, as though he’s underwater. Perhaps it would be a cause of alarm if he wasn’t so relieved to finally be able to hear himself think again.
“No, you’re right.” John chuckles, painedly. “You’re
John looks at him incredulously. Is he really trying to brush him off? Now? Is Sherlock dense enough to think that this is something John will let go?
“Hm?”
Since the Fall, since their two years spent apart and especially since John met Mary, the positive responses from John have gotten fewer and farther between. Sherlock’s response so far has been to up his focus, to try even harder, to do everything in his power for a shrinking amount of recognition. That stops now.
But the noise might equally be a warning of something far worse. Because the noise is not coming from his body. The noise is coming from his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
“In England, you say? Now, that’s just hurtful. Why not in Europe? The Western world? Or beyond? You have no idea what I’ve got going on out there in the big bad world.”
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock feels his own mouth moving to counter with a smirk of his own. “Do tell.”
written underneath in Sherlock’s own, slightly shaky hand. Further down, the hallway merges into a long, narrow corridor with doors on both sides. Most of them are in perfect order. There’s a near-perfect recreation of Baker Street behind door three. (It would be a perfect replica if not for John and Mrs. Hudson moving things around in his flat and upsetting his system. If only his socks were as easy to locate in the real flat as they are in his recreation of it.)
Of course that plan hinges on the possibility that Sherlock’s prolonged state of unconsciousness won’t last much longer. He doesn’t have a back-up plan in case that assumption proves to be incorrect. He doesn’t have a plan for what he’ll do if Sherlock is still unconscious in a day or a week or a month. He doesn’t want to plan for it. He doesn’t want to think about it. What he knows about comas and brain damage and prognoses from medical school is enough to propel his worries into the stratosphere as it is. His imagination doesn’t require any additional fuel.
. Her eyes remind him of Sherlock, how his eyes will positively sparkle on occasion from the sheer intensity of his concentration. It’s the look Sherlock gets in his eyes when he’s trying to manoeuvre a suspect into revealing a compromising piece of information.
, Sherlock is getting closer. Mycroft is wrong. It can be done and it should be done, but not for the reasons Mycroft thinks.
A brief flash of fire in between the branches sends his heart rate into the stratosphere. He tries to shout again, but with the same result. He waits then, anticipating every second to hear the horrifying sound of a fire igniting the wood surrounding him. It doesn’t come. The seconds pass, but it seems as though the fire can’t catch on.
That night, John is too angry for words. He even snaps at Mary, even though this is absolutely no fault of hers, causing her to give him the most unimpressed of looks before turning the lights off and abandoning him to his own thoughts while she sleeps. He doesn’t understand how she manages it. How can anyone sleep, how can anyone keep on living their lives as if nothing has happened, when Sherlock bloody Holmes can come crashing through the doors of The Landmark after being dead for two years with not a word of apology other than a drawn-on moustache and a cartoonish French accent?
A part of John’s brain picks up on the conversations of the people around them, surreally infiltrating from the outside world into this intimate conversation of theirs that John isn’t quite sure he knows or want to know the subject of.
John puts his arms around Sherlock’s too-slender waist and holds on to him as tightly as he can, irrationally afraid that he might somehow slip away if John doesn’t hold on tight enough.
Because Sherlock will never change. He’ll dangle that warmth and affection, that long-awaited admission that
for the
He tries not to beg. He shouldn’t want Moriarty to stay in the first place. But it’s just so cold. And when Moriarty answers in the affirmative – just a single “Yes”, that’s all he says – Sherlock can’t stop his insides from tangling themselves up in what feels disturbingly like panic.
With the way Jim is speaking, the way his voice is wriggling its way into Sherlock’s head, it’s almost as though he isn’t speaking at all. As though he’s just a voice, echoing back and forth inside Sherlock’s skull.
Sherlock struggles to formulate himself. It feels painfully unsafe to bare himself like this. He feels horribly exposed, as though he’s slowly peeling away at his own skin to let John peer underneath. He would never have said a word of this to anyone else. These are his most intimate thoughts and feelings, usually locked safely away inside himself, but now forced out into the open and laid bare beneath the microscope for John to examine. Sherlock would have rather died than let anyone else catch as much as a glimpse of it. But this is John.
“Even at the eleventh hour it’s not too late, you know.”
Without meaning to, he leans closer into John’s arms, consumed by a contradictory desire to hide from what he can guess is John’s judgement by burying himself ever further against his chest.
At the very end of the hallway, there’s another door. This one is different. The other doors down this hallway are mahogany with gold handles. This one is made of metal and feels cold to the touch. A padlock keeps it permanently locked and bolted. It gives Sherlock pause, which is the whole reason it’s here. To remind him that there are things behind this door requiring a padlock to keep them in and a padlock to keep him out. Had the water leakage been anywhere else, Sherlock would have had it fixed straight away. A water leakage down here is something he’d rather ignore. But that’s the thing about a water leakage: it spreads.
Deliberately ignoring him, Mycroft again attempts to address his brother directly.
“Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man.”
John’s throat constricts as he swallows. His voice comes out sounding equally unusual.
John looks up at him, but it’s a slow process. “Hey, you. Back from the dead?”
It’s true that he wants that. That he’s always wanted it. Fantasised about it, theorised about it,
“Missed me?”
Sherlock gathers his things almost in a trance and leaves. He’s heading straight for the one thing that can dull his emotions even in the direst of circumstances. To hell with the consequences.
Most of Sherlock’s shirts have buttons and Sherlock has expressed his dislike for cufflinks on more than one occasion. But John has a nagging suspicion that Sherlock’s dislike stems more from a desire to distance himself from the elaborate, over-serious and frankly ridiculously posh cufflinks preferred by Mycroft and his minions than from any dislike of the actual accessory itself. If John can just find the
Oh, well. Sherlock is suddenly feeling rather indulgent.
John struggles to remove his snow-soaked boots, deposits his shopping bags on the kitchen table, tosses his jacket in the general vicinity of the hook, misses by a mile, sighs deeply, goes to retrieve it, hangs it up to dry properly and finally,
collapses into his armchair, his limps sprawling out in every direction as he heaves a deep, satisfied sigh.
“Uh, nothing just… do your laundry… You know most people create imaginary versions of others to play out their fantasies, don’t you? But maybe getting someone else to do your laundry is the most indulgent scenario you can come up with?”
“Well, we can’t all three dance,” John deflects. “There
John gets up from the couch and shrugs out of his own jeans. Then he lets his boxers join them on the floor and Sherlock’s overly dramatic heart speeds up to an almost comedic degree.
“Do you not see it? An external stimulant. An emotional response. A decision to ignore it.” Jim’s voice is flat, toneless, completely matter-of-fact and yet Sherlock is reminded strongly of a very deep, dark pool of water. The way it fascinates you, sucks you in, entices you to take the plunge.
“But there’s one thing I disagree on.”
“I have a surprise for you,” Jim reveals. His voice remains calm, but there’s an undercurrent of suppressed excitement now. Like a child at Christmas. “An old friend just dying to meet you.”
John said he would be back first thing in the morning. That was two days ago. 24 hours has passed, and John has yet to communicate in any way. Not as much as a “fuck you”.
“I’m fine…”
But that’s the thing about all these conversations that they keep not having. It just never seems to be the opportune moment. John closes his mouth again.
“So, this is it then. The big day. I suppose I’ll be seeing a lot more of you from now on.”
“Sherlock.” Jim’s voice cuts through his. “Don’t tell me you don’t know why he is here. We both know this is where the real problem lies. Everything you don’t like about yourself… he carries all of that. He makes you weak, Sherlock.” Jim’s eyes look almost black even in the bright light of an overhanging factory lamp.
Not good as in how he might have felt if Sherlock had never been gone. John definitely doesn’t feel that what Sherlock has done doesn’t matter, not for a second. This isn’t some bloody movie set in a perfect world where you can just decide to say
Mary goes very quiet.
This time, being less emotionally wrung out and insensate from worry than he was on the day of Sherlock’s admittance, John is once again struck by just how abnormally normal Sherlock’s parents are. Looking at Sherlock and Mycroft, one wouldn’t exactly picture their parents as an ordinary, elderly couple, fretting and chatting and referring to their children by endearing little nicknames that they both seem to despise. The first time John had seen them, shortly after Sherlock’s return to London about a year ago, he’d inquired (somewhat disbelievingly) if those were really his parents, to which Sherlock had simply replied that their ordinariness was a crux he had to bear. That certainly seems to be the stance Sherlock is taking as his glances in John’s direction during their one-hour visit progress from overbearing over exasperated to downright pleading. The first thing he does as the door closes behind them is to express his relief. With as much coherence as he can muster, which at this point seems to be a deep sigh and a mostly controlled eyeroll. John has no trouble intercepting the meaning, though, even if he isn’t quite sure he feels the same.
John blinks, risking a glance up at Sherlock in his surprise.
There's nothing for him to do now, nothing but sit, look at Sherlock, pray or curse at the higher powers depending on what he feels is the least unhelpful. John doesn’t want to think, wishes he could turn his brain off and just sit here, as mute and stupid as Sherlock has so often accused him of being, but he can’t do that. His brain refuses to cooperate. And refuses to think of anything but the gaping hole in his chest and what’s causing it.
John is reminded of the very first night they spent together. They had gone to Sherlock’s favourite restaurant for a dinner turned stake-out, ending in a high-speed chase across what had felt like half of London and an extremely inappropriate giggle in the hallway. Later they’d finished their first case together and then gotten Chinese at the most ungodly hour. The way Sherlock’s eyes had shone that night, like two small suns in his face. The way it had made John feel. The way they’d joked and laughed and
“I know,” he says again. “You’ll find out in time. Wasn’t that what you said?” John can almost hear the smile in his voice.
So sorry for the long wait. However, to make up for it, here is a very long chapter. I hope you're all doing well and are coping with the world and all its craziness in any way you can.
John can’t stop himself from drumming his fingers against his knee impatiently as the cab draws closer to Baker Street. It’s not even eight o’clock yet, but he still wishes he could have been here sooner. Sherlock can take care of himself and John trusts that he has done so, but there’s no reason to push his luck unnecessarily, and John had promised to be at 221B first thing in the morning.
John can’t figure out if he’d rather have the little smirk. It’s comforting in its familiarity and he longs to return to familiar ground. This is dangerous territory. He can sense it somehow. Something is building in the air between them and John is not entirely sure he wants to put a name to it lest he end up acknowledging its existence.
John Watson is right here in the room with him.
“I couldn’t do it, John. I thought… I thought I had a choice, but I couldn’t do it!” His voice starts low and insecure, but quickly crescendos into a virtual cry of anguish. The sound rips John in the chest. He’s seen Sherlock annoyed, disrespectful, angry, frustrated, even upset… but never like this. He looks
They end up in Brixton on a case that’s clearly not one for the website, but does provide Sherlock with a couple of excellent opportunities to show off that John is
That’s why he leaves his phone at Sherlock’s side when he returns to the living room to let him sleep.
Sherlock sits still for a moment. Then he nods, only slightly and so slowly that John is barely able to pick up on it.
He closes his eyes. Opens his mouth. Screams soundlessly into empty air.
Not this time.
John sighs despairingly. “I’m not sure, to be honest. It’s about… about telling you that I know, I guess. And saying thank you.” John hesitates. He isn’t sure he wants to say the rest of what he’s thinking. “And I suppose, in a way, it’s about telling you that… that I’m just so very grateful for everything that we have and everything that you give, but if it’s not… if it’s not what you want… I mean, I don't want you to have to
it be John? If there should be one other person apart from Jim for Sherlock to confide in, to share with, to understand... shouldn't that be John? Hasn't it
He can’t keep holding Sherlock’s gaze. He has to look down.
“I know it’s not my place. I have no right to know what’s been going on in your head. And whatever did, it’s not real. It didn’t really happen. Moriarty is dead. You haven’t brought him back by thinking about him or anything. So you can just call me a bloody idiot and tell me to piss off and that’ll be the end of it.” John’s eyes are on him, seeking eye contact. “You can do that. But I think it matters to me. Now that you’ve told me, I have to know why. Is there… do you miss him? The real him, I mean? When he was alive, were you…” John looks momentarily as though he’s struggling for words. “Were you attracted to him?” he says at last, obviously trying his hardest not to sound accusatory. He’s only partly successful.
. Almost as though John’s appearance in his life was an event comparable to the birth this whole holiday is built up around (the latter of which, by the way, is wrongly dated both when it comes to the year and likely also when it comes to the date, having been moved to the end of December in order to correspond with heathen solstice festivals in Northern Europe – how come no one cares about these things?)
John feels himself swallow and it leaves a bitter taste in his mouth. Seeing Mary is definitely the right decision.
Sherlock is sitting in his chair. John can see him from his position at the kitchen counter. He’s looking into the fire, seemingly deep in thought. The orange glow reflects on his face.
I'm not going to blab too much this time (though I will blab at the end of the chapter), so without further ago, chapter 21 of Icebergs!
Sherlock nods, slowly.
have the capacity to feel and that he only ever tried to convince the world of the opposite because he feels
. There are no records anywhere in his Mind Palace (and the records he keeps there are extensive) of instances where Sherlock has agreed to participate in something he’d consider tedious or unnecessary without a fuss prior to John Watson. He’s never felt the need to indulge others just for the sake of indulging them, not until he met John.
“Yes, what? Sherlock?” Mycroft picks up almost immediately, sounding uncharacteristically breathless, and Sherlock spots an opportunity to open on a less serious note before getting to the heart of the matter.
So he doesn’t speak. Just sends her an apologetic look, though he doesn’t allow her any doubts about his decision.
Well… he better.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything and John’s laughter stops. He’s suddenly uncomfortably aware of the implications underlying the statement he’s just made. He isn’t quite sure how to interpret Sherlock’s silence, whether it’s an annoyed/insecure silence because Sherlock
Sherlock sees himself as he must look from the outside: manic, shivering, his eyes wild, his movements frantic. Scared and desperate, pathetically begging an empty room to produce a companion. Does he believe that the walls might listen to him, bring John to him faster? He doesn’t know. Would it be more pathetic to actually believe that the walls could hear him or would it be worse to beg the walls knowing full well that it’s just words and thoughts emptied into the air? This, he also does not know. Sherlock honestly doesn’t know what he knows anymore, what there’s left for him to know.
Then the thought strikes him.
Much of it has been about the charges. That of course he didn’t believe a word of what the papers said, what the police said. That he never would have, that surely Sherlock had known that. How could he not? How could he think that John would ever accept that it had all been some trick? How could he doubt that John would stand by his side? John has shouted at Sherlock, blaming him for not seeing it. Blaming him for always insisting on being alone. How could he have preferred to go to his death alone rather than confide in John? How could he? John still doesn’t know. Even if Sherlock somehow was able to answer him, would he be able to? Would he be able to come up with some believable explanation for not confiding in John, for not stopping John from leaving him, for not once letting John inside his mind?
“It… Sherlock… you can’t just… without even… do you have a version of
Sherlock is partly standing, partly sitting on the edge of the sink, his bare front to the door and his head turned over his shoulder to inspect… John follows his gaze to the bathroom mirror behind him and has to take a step back as the full expanse of Sherlock’s back is laid bare before him.
In contrast to the blurred, surreal memories of his first days in hospital, the final moments he’d spent in his own head are horrifyingly vivid. He’d been at what he’d thought was Battersea Power Station. Jim had brought him there. He’d wanted to test him. And Sherlock had thought that he would do anything for Jim, be anything he wanted, but he’d asked for the one thing Sherlock couldn’t give him. He’d asked for John. And Sherlock hadn’t been able to bring himself to do it. He hadn’t even been able to bring himself to give the order for someone else to do it.
”John…” It’s still been only a couple of seconds since Sherlock spoke. His eyes are slightly cloudy, the expression he gets when his thoughts flare at a hundred miles an hour. But now they seem to be coalescing into words. Spilling forth from his lips.
Jim continues, his voice low and intense. There’s an earnestness in his gaze now that Sherlock has never seen before.
But that is not why Sherlock is doing this.
Sherlock doesn’t stop to dwell on whatever emotion surfaces in his chest at that reminder. He doesn’t allow himself to do so. He never has. Some things are just better locked away where they can’t do any harm. Redbeard is one such thing and Sherlock acts almost instinctively at the mention, closing off the emotional onslaught as much as he’s able. Minimising the damage.
As always, thank you so much for reading, thank you to each and every one who leaves comments or kudos, and I really hope you enjoy chapter 10 of Icebergs!
It’s the most words, the most precise words, the most
“So…” he repeats.
It’s with that thought in mind that John takes a deep breath, painfully audible in the otherwise quiet bedroom, and brings up the thoughts he usually does not allow himself to have.
“He came while I was trapped in here, alright?!” he finally says. “I didn’t… I didn’t
Mary is asking whether she should wait with dinner. It’s with more than a little surprise that John checks the time and notices that it’s actually half past five already and it’s with more than a little guilt that he realises that he hasn’t actually taken the time to inform her that he plans for this to be an all-night vigil. He quickly types out a reply, explaining the situation and apologising for not letting her know sooner. His finger is hovering over the send button when Sherlock clears his throat, drawing John’s attention. He smiles a bit awkwardly and nods down at the phone in John’s hand.
Again, Sherlock hesitates with his answer. But this time Mycroft can tell that one is coming. Sherlock is actually listening now. Though the seconds drag on tediously, Mycroft opts to give him all the time he needs.
“He doesn’t do anything out of malice. People always think he says hurtful things in order to be hurtful, but it’s not like that. Sometimes I think he doesn’t realise what effect his words might have on people. And it’s not because he’s a psychopath, a psychopath would never make mistakes like that. He’s just not…”
. Sherlock’s behaviour might not have changed, but John’s ability to tolerate the silence definitely has. Ever since the hospital, whenever Sherlock is silent for long, it begins to eat away at him. He knows it’s irrational, this fear that Sherlock’s silence is but a precursor to something much, much worse, but logic has nothing to do with it.
Still, the afternoon ends up being surprisingly tolerable. They chat and joke a little, John and Sherlock entertain with stories of old cases and they discuss the wedding, which they haven’t had a chance to do before now. Mary thanks Sherlock earnestly for all his help with the preparations, for being there on the day and for taking care of everything, and John belatedly realises that he hasn’t actually thanked Sherlock for all that yet. So he joins in the general praise while Mary is still on the table decorations and the cake flavours. And perhaps it’s simply a trick of the light, but it seems to John as if Sherlock’s eyes
John jolts to an upright position in bed, still mostly asleep and completely clueless about his current location. The last remnants of his dream play before his inner eye, Sherlock’s keen face beaming at him as he mutters a quiet “The game is on” before dying away at the sound of a vicious knock at the front door. Mary stirs beside him.
“It…” A tongue darts out to moisten his lips. His plumb lips. “My Mind Palace… it does more than you know. More than Mycroft knows. It’s not just a big archive of memories and useful information tucked away in big imaginary boxes. It
A slight smirk appears on Jim’s face and he steps closer, placing an arm around Sherlock’s waist and leaning in from behind, whispering in his ear with that deep, enthralling voice of his. “I just told you.” There’s something about it that makes Sherlock feel warm and comfortable, somewhere between wrapping oneself in a warm blanket and something decidedly more prohibited.
“Why are you saying that?”
And perhaps he ought to. Why shy away? What’s the point? Sherlock has shied away from this all day without it making the smallest difference. It hasn’t stopped this wedding from happening and it hasn’t stopped Sherlock from experiencing this astute pain of loss. Why not let it all sweep over him? Why not prove to himself once and for all that
Sherlock looks at Jim one last time. His enemy, his rival, his opposite, his negative. The person who made him leave everything he cared about behind for two long years so that nothing was as it should be when he returned. The person who indirectly had him tortured, who caused scars on Sherlock’s back that will never go away. The person who threatened not only Sherlock himself, but the people he most cares about. He threatened them, again and again. But he did it to force Sherlock to come face to face with his emotions. Because Jim might be his opposite and negative, but he is also the only person who ever truly understood.
Jim Moriarty pulls back, removing his finger from Sherlock’s mouth and making himself comfortable in the chair that he has apparently dragged over.
“So… are you…?”
And truth be told, Sherlock actually, surprisingly, has never really had a problem with Christmas. What he's always resented has been the enforced company of his family. Nowadays, with a family he's actually chosen for himself... well, he finds that he's even sort of almost enjoying the whole thing. Sure, the endless carolling and forced cheer everywhere is a pain to be subjected to and the amount of people mindlessly following this mixed bag of holiday traditions picked up over the past thousand years and stemming from everything from 9th century heathen beliefs to 1960’s marketing campaigns all squeezed awkwardly and uncomfortably together under the label of a ‘traditional Christmas’ frankly makes Sherlock lose an additional bit of faith in humanity… but when John is off from his work at the surgery, relaxing in his chair with a comforter and a cup of tea while Rosie is beaming up at them from the floor with her mouth stuffed full of Christmas cookies, it would be a blatant lie to claim that Sherlock did not enjoy it in the least or that he did not feel just a smidge of that fabled Christmas spirit.
, John realises, and he almost lets go of it in horror, a sick feeling settling heavily in his stomach and threatening to turn it inside out. John is reminded of a case he and Sherlock did together a long time ago, back before the Fall. One of the good ones, a poisoning, easily an eight on Sherlock’s scale. But it’s not the sensationally macabre details nor the glint of excitement in Sherlock’s eyes nor even Sherlock’s howl of satisfaction when he cracked it that John remembers. It’s the six-year-old daughter of the victim that comes to mind, sitting there as she had at the police station, chair way too big for her and a female officer close by for comfort as Sherlock had interrogated her. Sophie, her name was, if John remembers correctly. Sherlock had been reassuring, gentle even, as understanding as John can ever remember having seen him in front of a witness, Lestrade’s warning of “gently, please, Sherlock” for once not falling on deaf ears. Perhaps even Sherlock had felt sympathy for her, shaking like a leaf as she was. Perhaps he’d simply understood that being reassuring would be the fastest way to get the information he wanted out of her. Whatever the reason, John can’t help but recall her words now, shakily spoken and difficult to understand from the mouth of a first grader who’d seen more horror in the last twenty-four hours than many do in an entire lifetime.
They fall asleep like that.
But Sherlock doesn’t wish for John. John isn’t coming and no amount of wishful thinking is going to change that. Sherlock might as well invest his energy in being logically emotional. Rather pathetically wish for the appearance of someone who might actually appear than pathetically wish for the appearance of someone who clearly isn’t going to.
“Then why did you do it?”
But he can see all too clearly how that would end. He could laugh right now, shrug it off, give Sherlock a safe, little nudge in a distinctly non-sexual
She takes his hand as soon as they leave Sherlock’s room and gives it a light squeeze. “I’m glad he’s better. For your sake as much as his.”
“Sherlock.” Jim is looking at him with that spark in his eyes, that glimmer of wonder and approval that Sherlock has grown so dependent upon in John’s absence. Like a drowning man, he’s been holding on to that look of Jim’s as ferociously as any man would a piece of driftwood in an ocean. It’s all he has to keep his head above water. Now Jim is once again offering it to him. All for the price of…
There’s a deep exhale above him, slightly unsteady in the middle, a clear indicator of intense emotion. Could be anxiety. Could be relief. If only he could focus, if only he could see…
to take that into consideration? Or maybe it’s guilt. Guilt that thoughts and feelings have started to creep back in through the cracks and have only widened them in the process.
Some of them are his dreaded emotions. He’s fought with those all his life. Yet the battle remains a torturous stalemate as his emotions continue to wash over him in tides, falling and rising yet never completely abandoning or overtaking him. There’s no winning or losing, just the monotonous push-pull inside of him as Sherlock periodically switches between overcoming and succumbing to his own feelings. Fear… hope… jealousy… pain… heartbreak… loss… love. It’s a slow torture, one that has been going for the majority of his life.
Sherlock nods again and sends John on his way.
John is left on the other end, phone still in hand, looking around an empty kitchen.
Mary shifts slightly in her sleep, drawing attention to herself, and John catches himself sighing in annoyance. He knows, objectively speaking, that none of this is Mary’s fault. If anything, she reacted remarkably well to having their one romantic evening interrupted by a man she’s never even met before. Sherlock’s overly dramatic return to life had broken off John’s admittedly awkward proposal and then, of course, taken all of his attention on an evening that should have been about Mary only. Then she had been dragged from one restaurant to the next while Sherlock and John had argued as though
Well then. His phone obviously isn’t working, which is more than a bit annoying considering the cost he’s invested in it.
Almost there.
As she straightens, John imagines that he sees Sherlock freeze for the briefest of moments before a deep frown creases his forehead. Mary notices too and ventures to ask if something is the matter, if he’s not lying comfortably or if he needs another blanket. But Sherlock doesn’t reply. He doesn’t even look at them. John immediately recognises the deeply concentrated expression as the one Sherlock usually sports when he’s had a breakthrough in a case and his mind is making deductions and connecting dots too quickly for him to bother trying to explain.
Sherlock hesitates a moment, fighting to suppress a growing sense of panic. Then he makes a decision to follow Jim’s lead, takes a deep breath in through his nose and throws himself into the kiss, abandoning all caution.
But no. John can do better. He isn’t done with what he wants to say yet. And Sherlock deserves to know.
I hope you will enjoy this chapter! And as always, thank you so much for reading and feel free to leave comments and/or kudos, they are so wonderful and inspiring to receive!
Sherlock looks at him uncomfortably. John knows his own limitations, personal conversations being one of the most jarring, but Christ, Sherlock is so much worse. How Sherlock can think that there’s some shame or judgement or… or guilt or who the hell knows what it is that’s kept Sherlock from sharing this with him for all this time… it’s beyond John. Personal emotional conversations, he can understand. Not only are they almost equally tough for him to manage (the reasons for which he’s never been quite sure of – but a natural English social dis-ease coupled with a don’t-ask-don’t-tell upbringing, some not entirely acceptable sides of his personality and a military stiff upper lip might have something to do with it and anyway, it is what it is). Sherlock is a self-proclaimed (a highly verbal self-proclaimed) opposer of everything to do with emotions, maintaining his own personal space with fierce vigilance and never allowing even John much more than a short glimpse of his inner machinations. But this… this is not like that. This is physical trauma. Why it causes Sherlock to shut down like this…
“Why did she do that?”
sort of way. More of a relaxed, considered
When he hangs up John wants to talk. But he doesn’t have any words and the thought of retroactively trying to justify to either himself or Sherlock what they’ve done – what they’re still doing, most likely – almost makes him sick. He doesn’t have any idea what’s going on in Sherlock’s head either.
Moriarty pulls back and the warmth dissipates.
“Don’t go. Don’t go, John. I know I said… I want it to be your decision, I swear I do, and I’ll let you go if that’s what you want, but please… don’t go, John!” He presses his lips together. “I want you to stay. I want it to be like it was. Only better. I want to do it right this time, just like you said. I want that. I don’t think I’ve ever wanted anything as much as I want that!”
Sherlock’s brain is working on overdrive, characteristically unwilling to simply shut down and let his body enjoy the sensations. And that’s the way it should be. His body is transport for his brain and his brain experiences through cataloguing and analysis and dissection: every caress, every slide of lips against his, every shiver running down his spine is meticulously collected and stored away for later assessment. This is what he’s been missing for months and months, trapped as he’s been by too many emotions and a slowing mind, and now it’s back and it’s here to stay and it’s
And he’s finally utterly alone.
“Right… Will you be coming with me then?”
And just like that, she puts him on the spot. The spot he wasn’t really sure he wanted to end up in and certainly not in this way. He should have planned his words, but he couldn’t bring himself to begin and he wasn’t even sure what he wanted to say. He still isn’t even sure what he wants to say.
“But you fired a gun into your own head. How could you possibly survive that…?” Sherlock pushes himself up on his elbow. His expression is probably comical, open-mouthed and disbelieving. There’s no space on his hard drive to take care of correcting it.
“So it is. And here I am, am I not? I’ll be back. Trust me, Sherlock.”
“Why did you bring me here?” is what he asks, though a thousand other questions wish to manifest themselves on his lips.
“I talked to Mary earlier.”
. His skin is practically burning, his heartrate is dangerously elevated and he’s showing no response to the various stimuli that John is providing. Although not an expert on the subject, John knows enough about drug overdosing to know that every second counts. The signs that Sherlock’s body is currently racing straight towards a heart attack are so obvious that John doesn’t even need his medical background to make a deeply disconcerting prognosis. Yet there’s absolutely nothing he can do to help except sit here and
Oh my goodness! This was a very difficult chapter to write and I'm still not 100% happy with it, but here goes. Yet another depressing chapter and it's only getting worse from here on out, so... yeah, sorry about this. As always, feel free to comment, give kudos or anything else! It greatly motivates me and I'd love to get more in touch with everyone about this fic. You can find me (until tumblr destroys itself with legislation anyway) as the-signs-of-two on tumblr!
Mycroft squares his shoulders. Despite his reputation, he really doesn’t believe in collateral damage. And certainly not of a kind involving his own little brother. But needs must when the devil drives.
Sherlock closes his eyes briefly and sighs. “Because you told me nothing, John. We were close in a way, but we didn’t share much. And that hasn’t changed. You told me nothing then and you’re still not telling me much. And unlike with other people, I’ve never been good at reading you. I’ve never been good at understanding you. If you sometimes look at me and wonder what’s on my mind, rest assured I have looked at you and wondered the same a thousand times. You can tell me a little, about Mary and about me, but it’s never the whole story and you’re always holding back. As though you think I would judge you. Is that why? Or have you just never learned how to speak your mind?”
The air seems to leave the room or maybe it’s just John’s lungs. He can feel his chest tighten, but for a change, it isn’t uncomfortable.
She nods. Slowly, steadily. There’s calculation in her eyes, outweighing emotion more than two to one. John briefly wonders if he should be relieved that her reaction is not much more violent, but instead it leaves him feeling strangely unsettled. Somehow, he doesn’t find it altogether comforting that she’s so calm. He knows what he’s just said: implicitly, between the lines, no matter how much he might have tried to disguise it, he’s chosen Sherlock over her. He had to make a choice, she forced him into that corner, but he didn’t make the choice she wanted him to and there might not be any going back from here.
Moriarty smiles sadly and shakes his head.
He’s looking at Mary, who raises an eyebrow good-naturedly.
John’s eyes sparkle with amusement before turning serious again.
Sherlock seems to weigh his words, weigh his appearance and the look in his eyes. Then he leans forward and upwards, in between his own spread legs with astonishing grace and agility, to kiss John with such utter gentleness and care that John damn near feels his heart melt inside his ribcage. Slowly, Sherlock guides John’s hand in between his legs and places it at his entrance with clinical precision. There’s hardly a blush on his cheeks, though John feels his own face come alight.
Mary nods in return. “I had my suspicions. I always have.” She hesitates for a second, but no more. “You love him,” she states flatly, listing it off as matter of fact. “You love him. You loved him before you met me and if you’d known he was still alive then, you wouldn’t have committed yourself to someone else. I would have been just another temporary girlfriend you could use to ward off some sexual frustration and dispel your own anxieties about your sexual identity.” All of this said with perfect clarity, without as much as a blink of the eye.
“Please.” John chuckles again until he realises that it was a legitimate inquiry. Then he shakes his head instead. “No, not at all. No, it was… it was beautiful. Perfect.” He looks up to meet Sherlock’s gaze and the two of them lock eyes.
Mary reappears in the doorway, shaking out her umbrella. The skies have practically opened up outside. “You should find him one then. Show him it’s still the good old days.”
child was that rare
John purchases the pair, but decides against getting them gift-wrapped at the store. He knows that if Sherlock were to spot such a package, it’d only be a matter of time before he would figure out where it had been purchased and from there it’s a short way to him guessing at the contents. Which is one of Sherlock’s favourite pastimes around Christmas, the childish spoilsport. This time, John is determined to keep it a surprise.
Does it count as hearing voices if what you’re hearing is just yourself arguing? Sherlock has always argued with himself. Everyone does so from time to time and it’s a useful tool when one has to deduce a crime scene. It allows you to turn the evidence around in your head, examine it from all angles and exploit every opportunity. That’s supposed to be normal.
Sherlock meets his gaze again and John is taken completely aback. There are no tight lips, no flexing jaw, no clenching and unclenching hands, no hint of hostility, no attempt at daring John to do anything. There is only the saddest, most pleading expression John can remember ever having seen.
Jim kisses him again, deeper this time. More insistently. More passionately. And Sherlock may be on his way towards a better, more confident, more enlightened version of himself, but there’s no denying the very visible shiver that runs down his spine. He raises a hand to urge Jim closer as Jim lowers a hand to do the same. Just as eager for Sherlock’s touch as he is for Jim’s, which is a better feeling than Sherlock had anticipated.
Sherlock knows that John doesn't understand. There's even a part of him that's certain that John
him… to speak. Sherlock pointedly ignores it, refusing to say a word. He’s deliberately not making this easy.
“Top drawer.”
“Mary…”
Additionally, the next chapter might be a bit delayed. This is because I'm currently planning and writing a short Christmas-themed fluff-fest based on prompts found on Tumblr. It'll be completely unrelated to this fic, but it does mean that I might not get around to working too much on the next chapter until after Christmas.
Mycroft’s face is grim as he rubs small circles on the few percentages of his brother’s back not covered in recent lash marks. Sherlock raises his head from the bucket between his feet just long enough to glare daggers at the older Holmes before he doubles over again, coughing up yet another bloody bit of mucus and trying in vain to dry the corners of his mouth with an already soaked handkerchief.
“John…” he says, but then he too falls silent. Perhaps he can’t think of anything to say either. He looks uncharacteristically insecure and yet there’s a fire and a light in his eyes that hasn’t been there in a long time.
John doesn’t even seem to have noticed.
John looks down to Sherlock then, giving him a chance to indicate that he doesn't want Mycroft to know this, but Sherlock avoids his gaze. There’s an unreadable expression in his eyes. As though he’s somewhere else entirely. Trust Sherlock bloody Holmes to zone out of this, of all things! And with that, John's brief foray into plying his allegiance to Sherlock is over and he quickly summarises the conversation he and Sherlock had at Bart’s earlier. Which sounds so much worse, he realises, when it’s not spoken by Sherlock’s far too calm voice understating the severity of the dosages he’s subjected himself to.
John and Mary both chuckle at that and Mary pats her new husband affectionately on the chest.
Not that Sherlock says so. He’s actually on his best behaviour, even accepting a visit from Mycroft on the second day. His welcome wears thin rather quickly and Sherlock ends up pointing him in the direction of the door with as much fury in his eyes as he’s capable of mustering after about a quarter of an hour, but it’s still a valiant effort on both their parts. Mycroft’s concern for his brother is genuine, even if he has a strange and predictably counterintuitive way of showing it. It’s just one of nature’s mysteries. Mycroft Holmes may be one of the most intelligent men in Britain, but when it comes to dealing with his own little brother, he seems incapable of putting peace, quiet and family concern above his bloody stupid superiority complex. Why exactly he needs to meticulously step on every landmine available to him is beyond John, especially when he surely must be knowledgeable enough about Sherlock’s inner workings to be able to predict his reactions as well as (and likely much better than) John.
“Well…” Sherlock shrugs good-naturedly, returning John’s smirk in full. “Sometimes.”
Mary comes upstairs just as John exits Sherlock’s hospital room, walking briskly towards him in a hurried stroll that’s verging on a run.
.” Sherlock even makes a vague attempt at mimicking his voice. His gaze is like steel, boring into John with abandon. Sherlock the untried kisser and Sherlock the emotional illiterate have retreated for a moment, giving way to Sherlock the detective, Sherlock the calculating-machine, Sherlock the era-defining genius. He’s deducing John. Trying to read his motives. If Sherlock believes emotions to be a hindrance to his brain, it’s just because he can’t see himself in this moment.
But he can’t say that. Not now, not like this. Not with Mycroft standing less than three feet away and his own temper threatening to boil over any moment. So all he does is nod. Once at Sherlock and once at Mycroft, who finally seems to accept the situation, but still takes a long moment to look between the two of them, then takes an unnecessarily drawn-out sigh and slowly, very slowly, makes his way down the stairs and out to the door.
“Because of me? Oh, so this is my fault? It’s my fault you overdosed and ended up unconscious for a week and now it’s also my fault that you invited Moriarty to keep you company while you were trapped in there! Oh, fuck off, you prick!”
John chuckles as well. “I call myself a human being, that’s what. A human being with ears, thank you very much.”
"So….Dim-Sum," John says, caught up to Sherlock.
“I’m supposed to be helping you pay the rent!”
"Look, you can't keep-" Anderson begins.
“What? What is it, what?” Lestrade asks impatiently.
"We're following directions from a friend on our phone. We'll let you know where to turn," John explains. "We're in a bit of a hurry, though, if you don't mind".
But John isn't listening. He's seen someone ahead of them walking towards them.
"What, so you set up a pretend drugs bust, to bully me?"
"Anderson."
"Of course," he wraps his arms around her back, surprised. "I have to say, I'm a little surprised…"
"Yeah, that's what she texted me about 20 minutes before we arrived. You didn't see him?"
"What are you doing here?" Sherlock asks him, patience visibly wearing thin.
“For God’s sake. If you’re just making this up…”
Sherlock stands there, staring at the pill. The cabbie looks up at him, smiling and malevolent as Sherlock twists open the bottle.
"Shut up!" Turning to Lestrade, Sherlock huffs, "I'm not your sniffer dog."
"I have absolutely no idea."
"Sherlock…" Grace pleas again, eyes frantically search for John's in the building across from them.
"I didn't order a taxi, go away."
"Isn't the doorbell working? Your taxi's here, Sherlock," Mrs. Hudson explains.
“Yes, but where would we begin to look?”
"It's a start! It narrows it down from anyone in London. It's the first proper lead we've had."
"Shut up! Everybody shut up, I'm thinking, don't move, don't breathe, Anderson, face the other way, you're putting me off!"
"Oh, use your imagination!"
Sherlock furiously throws the pill bottle to the ground, then pauses. His anger is controlled now. Walking calmly over to him, he stands over the dying man, a cold expression on his face.
John peers over her shoulder to look at the screen. "Come on. Let's go."
"Oh, calm down now. We're just playing a game. Let the boys play now," the cabbie says into her ear, restraining her back even tighter.
"So how can the phone be here?" John asks him.
Sherlock freezes. Turning to the doorway, he looks at the man standing behind her. A shadow slants across him, concealing his face. The Taxi driver presses a button on the phone. Then turns and heads away down the stairs.
"Yes, he is Mrs. Hudson."
"Neither do I! So let's work together. We've found Rachel."
"As ever...I am concerned about you," the man's voice softens.
Blue lights pass through the window from outside, illuminating Sherlock's face. The sound of sirens draws Grace over to the window to look outside.
Ignoring her, Sherlock turns to Lestrade. “The case. Where is it?”
"The bullet they just dug out the wall was from a handgun. A kill shot over that distance from that kind of weapon - that's a crack shot you're looking for. But not just a marksmen, a fighter - his hand couldn't have shaken at all, so clearly he's acclimatised to violence. He didn't fire 'til I was in immediate danger, though. So, strong moral principles. You're looking for a man probably with a history of military service and nerves of steel…" Sherlocks abruptly stops, making eye contact with John who has walked up to the edge of the scene. "Actually, you know what - ignore me."
"The way you hail a taxi screams 'big city' - New York seemed plausible."
"I doubt it, since she's been dead for fourteen years. Technically she was never alive. Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's still born daughter fourteen years ago."
"Not good?" Sherlock stops pacing to look at John questioningly.
"Everybody quiet and still," Lestrade commands. "Anderson, turn your back"
"Okay, okay, well I'll let you go on ahead, then. Here's your copy of the keys." Handing over a key labelled 221C, she makes her way to the doorway. "Feel free to drop by later. I make a great cuppa. That means "cup of tea", dear. But I'm not your housekeeper, so please keep the place clean, yes? I have enough trouble with those two upstairs. And say hello to Detective Lestrade for me!"
"If you had just told us where you were going instead of making her and John chase you around, she could have been better prepared, Sherlock. You can't go running around wherever you like in the middle of an investigation like this."
Sherlock sighs. "Is this the best George can send for me?"
"Good," she replies, crossing the space in between them to throw her arms around him in a hug. "Thank you, John."
Later, they decided to ask some of the guests. Maybe the victims knew each other. In the end, they had some conclusions, but not those they wished for. The victims weren’t related in any way and they had probably seen each other twice because of the wedding. They had no backstory together at all.
Sitting close next to each other on the flight back, Sherlock told John exactly what had happened in the forest. John sat there, listening to that dreamy voice, glad that he didn’t need to hide his feelings anymore.
He took another breath, lifted his hand and took the book slowly from his friend’s hands. Their fingers slightly touched which was enough to send sparks of electricity through Sherlock’s hand, up his arm and down his back. He’d never get enough of John, he knew that.
Some other police officers had found the girl. She was in complete shock and carried some minor wounds but she was still alive. After about an hour they had finally found the third victim, the man. They had secured the area and were waiting for the flash- and spotlights to be delivered, so they could examine the scene thoroughly. The bride and groom only left, after all their guests were already gone.
“Did you…” started John. “How did you like the book so far?”
His books were his safe place where he could let his fantasies come to life. But at the same time, they were a curse, because they showed him what he could never have. And it drove him almost insane.
“And why do you think that?”
“Okay. But why making such an effort to let it look so similar? I mean if he really had something against them he could have just killed them, normally? I know, I know it’s not normal to kill somebody let alone with an axe but you know what I mean.”
Donovan opened her eyes in surprise.
The police had set up their stuff on some of the tables covered in white sheets. It looked strangely pleasant. All the equipment – guns, plastic bags and gloves - next to champagne glasses and flower arrangements. John had put his gun on there, too.
Hours after they’d arrived, had asked every person and had examined the bodies more than once they still hadn’t found more clues. Sure, they had found out about the usual jealous ex-boyfriends and –girlfriends but none of them were here, at least no one had seen either of them.
“Of course not. That would be too easy. I can’t tell you though, why nobody noticed. Have you already searched the nearest forest? Either way he is hiding in there or he is still here with the remaining guests.”
He looked at the clock, 2:16 am. He looked back at the last page he just finished. Had he really sat here the whole evening and read without noticing anything? That usually only happened when he was in his mind palace.
“Well, we have to find them.” said Lestrade. “We need to get back into the forest. They could be anywhere. We have no idea what happened. Donovan! Get your team and go into the northern woods. Thomas? You take the southern part. The rest is staying and looking over the fields. They are huge here. Go, go, go!”
But Sherlock wasn’t in a place to judge. Especially not with John as he found out soon. John wouldn’t let himself feel irritated by the way Sherlock side-eyed him every time he held one of his books in his hands and read. They were calming his nerves and the real world was cruel enough so why shouldn’t he do something about it and live his happily ever after. Even though it was just in his mind.
Lestrade cleared his throat once more. This time, Sherlock and John finally looked up. They noticed they were still standing in the middle of the field, the sun had settled down behind the trees, illuminating the scene magically. Some police officers were just bringing the killer away, leaving Lestrade and Donovan with them.
“Yes, but… how?”
Sherlock jumped over a root and struggled to keep his speed, while the man with the axe was still keeping up. He needed to reach the field as soon as possible.
He shook his head. “No. What do you see that I can’t?” Sherlock took in a deep breath and started to explain.
“Do you think he saw his attacker?” John asked. “I mean it looks like they had a fight.” He pointed to the grass.
Now John was just mere meters away before they’d finally meet. Sherlock wanted to open his arms to wrap them around him and never let go.
“What made you change your mind?” John asked. “I mean, no offense! I think it’s brilliant that you liked it so much but what made you take it in the first place?”
He hoped that it was Sherlock himself deciding that he would give it a try. For him.
“There’s been a murder, I know. But it’s still a wedding. There are two people who wanted to have the best day of their life and now two of their friends and family members are dead. So please, be gentle while you do your job. Did you understand, Sherlock?” Sherlock looked up.
As they were sitting next to each other on the plane, Lestrade came over to give them the remaining information. They were going to a less populated spot in Scotland, which was surrounded by many forests and large fields. The next bigger city would be about half an hour away.
His attention flew back to John and he looked at him in anticipation.
Lestrade had to stop himself from rolling his eyes and turned around without another word. John just smiled and began to discuss their next steps with Sherlock.
“Uhm…” he started. “She’s been killed the same way? On the opposite side of the place?”
“That’s no problem John.” Sherlock smiled.
“So? I can bet over them, can’t I?”
Only five meters left.
“They look the same?”
It was one late afternoon when John took another copy out of the shelf and held it in front of Sherlock’s nose. It was too near to be able to read the headline but it looked soft and John had probably read that one more than five times. He must like it quite much.
but John’s thoughts where suddenly interrupted by his walkie-talkie making a noise and then he heard a voice shouting.
Sherlock got up. “To answer your question. He probably has seen the murderer but couldn’t do anything against him. They didn’t fight. You can see it on his hands. He didn’t even have the time to shield his face with them or turn away. The wounds are only on his face and chest area.”
“It would be a possibility, right?”
He ran even faster now.
“Yes, I know. And yes, he was in rage but there was another strong emotion which led him.”
“You see” John started. “It really means much to me that you read them, so… thank you!”
It was already late in the afternoon as John got up to his feet again after examining the corpses for the umpteenth time.
“I found him!” John took the device in his hands immediately.
“So, what do we now?” He asked. The detective looked down at him.
On their way mid-air, they changed into their vests and suits so that they would be a little less conspicuous. After that, the plane finally landed and they got off, looked for their bags and the cars which would bring them to their final destination.
Most of the guests had already left. Police officers were packing their things away, careful not to forget any of the evidences they had collected. Lestrade had sent another troop into the woods, after he had managed to get John and Sherlock to stop kissing for a moment, so Sherlock could tell him what had happened in the woods.
Two guests missing, the axe-murderer still out there and Sherlock gone, too. John put his head in his hands. What kind of horror was this?
“Well, that was quite, something.” Lestrade stated. Sherlock and John looked at each other and then back to the police officer, still holding onto one another.
John and Sherlock sat near the police table and discussed.
“You mean, the person with the axe hates the bride and groom and killing them wouldn’t have been enough? He wants to ruin their perfect day?”
John meanwhile could imagine quite well what was happening in this forest. He took the walkie-talkie to his mouth and shouted.
“Don’t you think that’s a bit too… open?” John looked down at himself.
Later that morning John stood on his tiptoes in front of their book shelf, looking for the next book to give to his friend. As Sherlock entered the living room he had to stop himself from giggling. It just looked adorable as John tried to reach the top shelf. How did he get the book up there anyway?
Here they stood, right in the middle of a field, a murder investigation, after a chase of life and death.
“With three buttons open and your sleeves pulled up?”
“You never liked him!”
It was not unusual for Sherlock to just disappear out of side, but this time they weren’t at home in London. They were on a murder investigation in fucking Scotland right in the middle of nowhere, with the murderer still out there. What had he seen which they hadn’t?
The killer, completely taken aback by what was happening in front of him, had stopped about ten meters away from them. He had slowly put his axe down but still clutched to it. The two men, probably police officers, were kissing, not caring about anything else but themselves. He felt kind of awkward like he shouldn’t be here to watch it. He had never witnessed anything so weird in his life, and he had just killed three people.
Sherlock had soon discovered that the stories got more intense if he read them in his ‘mind palace’. He’d transfer the words into his head, where he’d have full scenes played for him. The characters - how he imagined them - going through their adventure.
The ride took them about an hour so they arrived at the wedding just after lunch time.
On their way Sherlock was explaining some things to John he had already figured out from just the information they had. The police had been quick to arrive so the murderer didn’t have much of a chance to escape unless he’d hide in the nearest forest. That’s what Sherlock showed him on a map. John had no idea where he got this from. Probably snatched from Lestrade.
“What the hell happened to him?” John whispered.
Only when the first stars had already appeared, did they walk back to the others, hands entangled and heads up in the clouds.
“No, I mean, come here.” He scooted over a little to give John space and he kneeled down beside Sherlock. Neither of them cared about how close they were. Almost touching. John tried to focus on the task at hand. Difficult with Sherlock so near.
“What? No, I thought he was with you. The last time I saw him he talked to you.” Lestrade answered through the device.
“Don’t let it fool you. The groom’s best man dies on the day of the wedding. People are shocked, don’t want to believe what happened, want to see it for themselves. Many people who weren’t related to the crime at all were here.”
John who sat in front of him with his own book looked up and smiled. He thought Sherlock had come to a very interesting part of the story. Surely, he must have been surprised.
Some seconds later Sherlock held another romance novel in his hands.
He put the book down on the little table next to his chair and stood up. The story had put him in a thoughtful mood. What if… No he couldn’t start getting his hopes up. That was what he had been afraid of. To let his mind open up too much and let his secret escape.
John was stunned. He stopped in the middle of his movement – toast halfway to his mouth. Had he misheard? Was Sherlock really asking for another romance to read?
“Right. But why? He must have been furious about something. I can see those two men having a Problem with each other, but then there is the woman who got murdered too.” John thought aloud.
“What? Where is he?” John heard Thomas.
Lestrade had almost reached when he noticed what was going on. Right in this moment Donovan and the rest of the troops came out of the forest, skittering to a halt by the scene in front of them.
“Not as beautiful as Ireland but definitely worth a visit.”
“Maybe it has nothing to do with the people themselves but the wedding.” Sherlock suddenly said.
The police officers had checked every guest, as it turned out no one was an ex-boyfriend or girlfriend and the three guests found with blood on them where innocent. One of the guests had have a bad nose bleed and the other two had cut their skin open on one of the spiky bushes surrounding the place. So, nothing to alarm anyone.
With so much going on and so much excitement around him, John wished he was somewhere more peaceful. Or at least with someone who could anchor him. He turned around to look for that exact person. But he couldn’t find him.
The first time John offered his book to Sherlock his flatmate looked at him as if he wanted to strangle him. Quietly John put the book back into the shelf, right next to Sherlock’s psychology lexicon so he definitely wouldn’t overlook it.
“No.” John admitted.
Sherlock never thought of reading as an entertainment. He usually just read books that had a logical and explainable background. Easy to understand – at least for himself - and helpful for his work. But he had memorized most of his knowledge anyway.
“I asked you if you wanted take away for tonight or if we should go somewhere?” John smiled.
He wanted to say Sherlock so many things he couldn’t. First of all, he would stutter with every second word and the most important thing… He might lose Sherlock. Yes, they were the best of friends. But that was the problem. He wanted more. So much more. He couldn’t put it in words, even if he tried.
Time passed by and faster than they could have thought they had become the best of friends. They were always together and knew each other by heart. But for Sherlock it had developed into something more. He knew what he felt for John but he was determined to never show it in any way. John had declared more than once that he was straight and Sherlock wouldn’t want to ruin their friendship for anything in the world.
“So, Scotland? Ever been there?”
He turned around, Donovan followed.
Everyone hurried around. People grabbing their guns and dogs about to start off into their shown direction. The guests just stood there, stunned and worried at the same time. Would they find something?
John, still smiling, looked at Sherlock. The detective had to keep himself from staring too long in those beautiful eyes.
“That explains the formal wear.” John stated and Lestrade nodded.
Sherlock blinked. He was back in his chair in the living room. Then he looked up to the person who had destroyed his beautiful perfect world. He was about to give a very annoyed and angry return as he saw who had interrupted him. There were those same sparkling blue eyes from some seconds ago but this time they were real.
“And which one was that?” John asked.
Sherlock was almost touching John now. He came to a halt and put his hands on John’s face. As both of them had stopped completely Sherlock moved even closer to John and their faces were just inches apart. John had stopped breathing, his eyes wide. Then Sherlock finally closed the distance between them and put his lips on John’s.
And John left again. What exactly was that? Sherlock thought back to what just had happened in his mind. John and himself, enjoying life. John running towards him. John kissing him. Oh, how amazing that had felt. And it was just in his head? He had no idea how he’d survive if that would happen in real life. But he didn’t need to worry about that, did he? John would never share his feelings.
One local officer was with them and warned them before Sherlock could lift the cloth.
There in the middle of nowhere a couple had chosen the place for their wedding. It didn’t turn out as planned, obviously. The husband’s best man and one of the bride’s guests were murdered in a horrible way. And now, on the same day, they had to investigate. All the guests and the couple were still there. The local police had made them stay to make the investigation easier for the team from London.
While John was replaying their first kiss in his mind, Sherlock still couldn’t believe that he was now able to call John his. As he slowly drifted off to sleep, fingers intertwined with John’s, he knew that everything was perfectly okay now.
He was so beautiful and he was coming right towards him. Sherlock’s whole world came together to this one person.
He opened the book and started reading and was soon wrapped up in a world full of decision, scandals and in the end the perfect love with a happy ever after.
While thinking about the motive of the murderer, there suddenly broke out a commotion behind him. People were up, running and shouting all over the place. Quickly, he made his way over to Lestrade.
But the joy of seeing Sherlock alive didn’t last long as he saw that Sherlock was followed by a man carrying a large axe. The blade reflected the last rays of the sun and made the scene even more maddening.
“That’s what ordinary people do, you know,” Jim continues. “Tell each other the same boring, predictable fairy tales over and over. Again and again. Until everyone collectively decide that there is some meaning in there worth preserving. Making morals out of nothing. Fooling themselves and others into thinking that their subjective ideas of right and wrong are objective truths.”
And then there’s no space for any other thought in John’s head than simply
Sherlock looks at him. Listens. Tries to understand. But it’s like trying to make a puzzle with half the pieces: you might be able to decipher the general subject depicted, but it’s not a very satisfying picture to look at and it’s difficult to imagine the parts you’re missing. And Sherlock is fairly certain he’s missing several key pieces.
As much as everyone can agree to a shared feeling of relief at seeing Sherlock on the mend seemingly without any lasting damage, his ever-increasing ability to notice his own boredom and frustration and take it out on those around him means that everyone is also exceedingly grateful when his doctor finally judges him to be well enough to go home on the condition that John can be there to look after him in case of an emergency.
And here John sits.
His voice sounds a bit slurred.
Now John thinks of his life as before and after Sherlock. It just makes more sense. The difference between the John Watson before and after the army is nothing compared to the difference between the John Watson who met Sherlock Holmes in Bart’s Hospital, the John Watson who watched Sherlock Holmes throw himself off the very same building less than two years later and the John Watson sitting here now.
“Oh, fuck off!” It’s John’s turn for his temper to run away with him. He shakes his head, an angry habit of his that’s always annoyed the hell out of him. “Yes, I remember. It was your brother’s plan not to tell anyone. Bloody brilliant. Had a good laugh about that, did you?”
John reading Sherlock to sleep is quickly becoming a new favourite ritual of theirs.
At long last, John speaks. “Why did you do it? If you thought it was real… or if you couldn’t tell what was real and what wasn’t… why did you do it? If even a part of you believed he was actually alive and had returned to London… why didn’t you call the police? Why did you allow him to stay at your flat, why did you speak with him, why did you…?”
John takes a cautious step into the flat, intending to dispose of his jacket and make himself a cup of tea while he waits. He never makes it that far.
What is he supposed to answer to that?
There’s a pause.
for Christmas even though he knows she won’t return the favour. And then there are Sherlock’s parents. John has spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to figure out a present for them, Sherlock having been no help at all. In the end, he’d decided to just go simple and get them a book each, picked out in Waterstones along with Rosie’s picture books and chosen based on John’s very limited knowledge about their interests and pastimes. He’s saved the receipt just in case.
And somehow, amidst the rush and the fun and the comfort of familiarity, John postpones
Mary’s kisses are nearly always clinical. Brief, but insistent. Quite a bit of pressure between their mouths. No hesitance, limited delicacy, but quite reassuring all the same. Firm. The kisses of a nurse. It’s only on very rare occasions, usually in the throes of passion, that she kisses him in a different way. More demanding, more passionate, more risky. Less of a statement that we belong together and more of an affirmation that we’re here and we’re willing and to hell with it all. John likes when she does that. Though he’s loath to admit it, her usual kisses can sometimes feel a bit…
Keeps looking at him.
It’s not the nicest way to turn her down. John feels bad about it even as he’s doing it. But it’s what he can manage at the moment. He’s in no mood for a lengthy discussion, and he won’t allow himself to be swayed. He had quite enough of that yesterday. Now, today, he needs to stand firm.
. Christ, what has he become? The Great Sherlock Holmes, the man who sees right through everyone and everything in seconds. What’s incredible, though, is how spectacularly ignorant he is about some things. And how spectacularly pathetic he is, reading about himself on John’s blog because it feels as though the only thing able to save him right now, however momentarily, is a friendly voice.
John used to have much the same effect on him as Moriarty. There was no reason to indulge in artificial stimulants when they were running off together, solving cases and having adventures, just as John’s constant presence and steadfast companionship made Sherlock’s emotional painkillers seem rather superfluous. What boredom did inevitably and routinely arise could usually be dealt with through the use of cigarettes or, due to John’s vehement protests, nicotine patches. If anything, Sherlock had sometimes felt tempted to shoot up just to escape how comfortable he felt and go back, albeit temporarily, to his old self: indifferent to flattery and unheeding of his own need for positive social interactions with another human being.
Moriarty, had promised to burn the heart out of him. And as demonstrated by that fatal showdown on the roof of St. Bart’s, Moriarty had known exactly where to look for it. Who to target. Was it really such a stretch to imagine that he could have anticipated the outcome of their confrontation and put plans in place that would take effect if he shouldn’t make it off that roof alive? After all, that was what Sherlock himself had done…
Sherlock’s heart rate is abnormally elevated and there's no apparent reason why.
He isn’t sure how he feels about this. This is all too surreal. This entire conversation doesn’t feel fully real. As though it might actually be some weird, messed-up dream of his, the kind he sometimes gets when he’s had a little too much to drink in the evening and he doesn’t know he’s dreaming until something so absurdly impossible happens that even his slightly inebriated subconscious recognises how preposterous the situation is.
“Mine?”
It’s John’s turn to be silent.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow though his eyes remain closed.
John is staying with him 24 hours a day (much to Mary’s annoyance, unspoken though it may be, but that’s a whole other can of worms that John is reluctant to open). Sherlock seems to appreciate it. On the second day, John had put on his jacket and shoes to go out and get some groceries, at which point Sherlock had smiled a little resignedly and asked him to say hi to Mary from him. When John had informed him that they were simply out of milk and that he had no idea what he was going to make for dinner, Sherlock had seemed genuinely puzzled. It had been necessary for John to explain to him, at great length and in no uncertain terms, that he considers staying with Sherlock to watch over him while he’s recovering from a lengthy hospital stay to be a far more important duty of his than to spend his every waking moment of free time with Mary, that he considers it a privilege to watch over him, not a duty, he didn’t mean for it to come out that way, and that
Sherlock doesn’t need a second to consider. “Battersea Power Station.”
Thank you so much for reading, everyone!!
“John.”
That was the idea.
What almost hurts the most, though, is that John doesn’t even know what the problem is. This thing that he's been able to pick up on again and again during the past week, that seems to be haunting Sherlock every time he's reminded of it, that causes this sad, distant look on his face whenever he thinks John isn't looking... why can’t Sherlock just tell him about it? Why can’t he share it? Whatever it is that's weighing on his mind like this, doesn't he know that John wants to help? Isn’t John his best friend?
It’s true that they have often theorised what he could do with an unlimited brain power. Time and time again, they’ve sat up late at night and fantasised about it, imagined what it would be like to be able to deduce things before they happened. Thought about how people might react. Discussed the kinds of experiments he could carry out and the kinds of theories he could develop if he could only dedicate his entire self to his brain. Abandon all else and be just that superior mind.
And the thoughts he has. It’s been so long since he’s been able to think clearly, to observe with precision and deduce with certainty. There isn’t much for him to deduce on in the familiar setting of his own flat, certainly nothing that will allow him to satisfy his own expectations. What he does see, however, is very encouraging. Flat newly vacuumed on a Sunday morning even though Mrs. Hudson only ever vacuums on Mondays can only mean that she has a visitor she is desperate to impress, could only really be Mr. Chinnery, the elderly gentleman from no. 215, who plays the organ in the church on Sundays, so he must be stopping by before that, which would be before 9:00 AM, it’s now 7:30, so he must be here already, which explains the shameful lack of morning tea from Mrs. Hudson’s side. Child’s play and unnecessary information, but
It’s not for John, though. That’s something Sherlock keeps repeating to himself every time he wants to feel the prick and refuses himself. It’s not for John. He didn’t promise John to stay off drugs indefinitely. They entered into a deal, specifying that Sherlock should not do drugs until the following morning and John should turn up then to help him manage the urge. Sherlock might feel bad that he didn’t uphold his part of the deal and ended up indulging himself regardless in the early hours of the morning. He might feel bad, if not for the fact that John didn’t uphold his side of the deal either. He didn’t show up when he’d promised he would. In fact, he hasn’t showed up since. In Sherlock’s eyes, that leaves their deal null and void and him free to take whatever he pleases.
cares for Sherlock, but the point still stands). But there had been no mistaking Sherlock’s dismissal and Mary’s reaction had been equally obvious. Friends don’t expel each other from their homes, nor do they glare at one another with such unhinged resentment it's almost a physical punch. Which begs the question why John hasn’t seen it before. It must have been there right under his nose all along, practically staring him in the face, and he didn’t see it.
“But you register that it is a taunt?”
He wants it all undone. He wants to be who he used to be, who he was always meant to be. He was never meant to be this pathetic, stupid, emotional mess. He’s been shutting his emotions off since he was four years old. It has always been second nature to him. Instinct even. This thing he has become, it’s not who he is meant to be. He fell in love and he allowed that to overtake him and turn his head and mess everything up and here he is, abandoned, and it’s no more than he deserves for being so horribly weak and it has to end
“What?”
There’s a darkening ring surrounding the outer edges of his vision, steadily growing to cover an increasing amount of the periphery of his eyesight. Narrowing his visual field. It disappears entirely for a couple of seconds as Sherlock feels himself blink, slowly and completely beyond his control. He most certainly did not tell his eyes to do that.
His hand closes around the door handle.
This is Sherlock rebooting his system after an unexpected announcement of emotional significance. There’s something strangely flattering about that. John has the ability to turn Sherlock’s brain off, however momentarily. Not a lot of people have that ability. John feels disproportionately proud of the achievement.
door in the deepest, darkest corner of his mind palace, it wasn’t merely to escape the incessant noise of a hundred voices in his head telling him how to feel! It was to not feel at all, to stop being this pathetic, stupid, emotional version of himself! He used to be Sherlock Holmes, the clever detective in the funny hat. Now he’s just the funny hat: stupid, useless, conceited, illogically constructed, an embarrassment to anything and everything in its surroundings.
understood was that he’d escaped. He’d wanted out and he’d done it.
“What’s happening with me and Mary, it doesn’t change… when you were gone… what you and I have, that’s…”
The change is so profound and so sudden that it takes Sherlock a moment to fully register it. No dripping. No creaking. No voices. Only himself and his own thoughts. It’s such a relief that Sherlock momentarily feels himself getting dangerously close to a sob. It’s as though a huge weight has been lifted off his shoulders, a month-long migraine disintegrated. He is alone, alone in his own head for the first time in at least half a year.
And just like that, they’re back on familiar ground and their conversation can kick off along tried and true routes. Sherlock glances towards John briefly then, and John realises that he’s done it on purpose. He’s helping John out. A warm smile finds its way to the outer corner of John’s mouth, but at the same time, it makes him inherently sad. Both of them are being pleasant and kind and funny and charming, the best versions of themselves. He’s missed Mary,
An expression flickers across Sherlock’s face too fast for John to interpret it. “Oh. Well, I suppose we could do that. If you have no objections. I don’t expect…”
Moriarty lets go of his chin and leans back in John's chair.
“No, I mean it. He sits alone up in that flat, completely secluded from the world around him unless you’re there to drag him out into it. And I know you somehow feel responsible for that, but you really shouldn’t. You don’t owe him anything, John. Perhaps it was different some years ago. Perhaps things worked differently between you back then. Perhaps it wasn’t an issue. But it is now. He was the one who decided to leave you, John, and then he decided to come back. And now he expects things to be the way they were, and you’ve just decided to indulge him.”
The living room feels even darker and more claustrophobic than usual. Mycroft’s grip on his umbrella is tight, unforgiving, frustrated. He takes a moment to compose himself. Forcing that incessant voice out of his head takes more effort than he would care to admit, and it’s a few seconds before he feels confident enough in the mastery of his own voice to speak again.
And why? Because John was feeling guilty about spending time with Sherlock rather than with Mary.
, that I can’t count on you to… do my laundry for a month… even if you’ve promised to do so in my Mind Palace!”
The moment their lips meet, it’s as though a switch somewhere deep inside Sherlock’s head is flicked… off? On? It’s difficult to tell, which only serves to increase Sherlock’s desire to repeat the experiment, preferably as many times as it takes for him to understand exactly why he wants to repeat it so badly. Somehow, he seems to be simultaneously relaxing and focusing. Maybe his brain is regaining momentum as it rids itself of the emotional tension that has been building up for the past several years. Or maybe his consciousness is not one unit at all, but rather a logical brain and a fanciful mind, his brain speeding up as his mind relinquishes its hold on him. Or maybe… Christ, Sherlock has a hundred possible explanatory models in mind, but right now his brain seems to only want to register one thing: to hell with the explanation, this feels
“I know, but I was bored. I chose it because it was much less academic than my other chemistry books.”
A moment’s hesitance and then… “John beat you to it, I’ve already told him.”
? Mary has been everything John could expect and more. She’s sat through some of the very worst he’s had to offer. Long, emotionally charged yet tearless monologues about a person who was to her a perfect stranger from a man who must have seemed a pathetic, broken shell clinging on to a ghost. Over and over, week after week, month after month. She sat through that and yet still somehow decided to not only stick around, but to choose John, to take her chance on that broken shell and turn him back into a real human being.
But Sherlock’s eyes are still on him and John knows full well what that means. He’s deduced that there’s a continuation coming and he’s letting John know. But he’s content to wait for John to continue on his own rather than offer him any assistance. Christ, John hates that particular trick of his.
There is an ease between them that hasn’t been there in ages. A sense that they don’t have to stop and think before speaking to each other, don’t have to consider every little word before it comes out. Sherlock is moping around all day in his various dressing gowns, complaining of boredom, and yet, when John makes a suggestion for something they might do to relieve said boredom (play a game, watch a movie, make a shopping list), he inevitably and vehemently turns John's proposal down, claiming that he doesn’t have time for it. John will turn out dish after dish in the hope of getting Sherlock to eat more than a couple of bites and even sit through his rather long-winded complaints about the pain of having to waste energy on digestion for the sake of getting him to finish what's on his plate.
Mary is kind, considered, apologetic even, though John can’t help but notice that she doesn’t actually apologise. She only skirts around the issue with gracious diplomacy. She asks him to just forget what she’d said, reassuring him that he can stay at Baker Street for as long as he judges it to be necessary. She agrees with him when he says that Sherlock is still in need of medical care and emphasises that
This is… this is shameful, but it’s also honest. Brutally honest. He will have to tell John about how it had been to sit by the window and watch people pass by on the street. Unable to hear him shout, unable to react or respond to him in any way. Set dressing on the other side of an impenetrable wall of glass.
And for what it’s worth, it’s glorious.
“Absolutely.”
“You could be so much more than this, Sherlock. If only you wanted to.”
But it would have been wrong to let John stay out of sheer pity. No matter how much Sherlock might’ve taken advantage of John’s pity in the past, that dynamic has been explored one too many times by now. It had to stop. It’s never ever been what Sherlock wanted. John is not his caretaker, not his overseer, not even his doctor. John has his own life now, his own home, his own wife. John should be exactly where he wants to be, spend his time exactly where and with whom he wants. Not feel forced to sit by and play doctor as his unforgivably weak excuse of a friend slowly crumbles to pieces in his hands.
It remains that way for a while, both of them exploring the other without rush, without force, just a gentle, delicate press of lips on lips. Then John lifts one of Sherlock’s legs partly onto and around his lap and their kiss grows slightly more desperate and insistent. Sherlock completes the movement John has begun for him, shifting his weight and moving his hips, in effect straddling John’s lap. He moves his hands into John’s hair on either side of his face, partly holding on and partly guiding him closer, and John
(See the end of the chapter for
If he could just feel thankful and content and humbled and confident and all that, that would be good. But nothing can ever be that simple in his life, can it? While Mary has been busy taking care of him, holding his hand and kissing his cheek and generally doing all the right things a partner is supposed to be doing in this kind of situation… John’s been busy regretting every decision he ever made that led to him choosing her in the first place.
“I know.” Mary’s voice suddenly sounds flat. “He will need you today. And then he’ll need you tomorrow. And in a week. A month. A year.”
“That’s not true.” John’s eyes seem to flare up in indignation. “That’s not true! I cared for you, you knew I cared. We were close. How could you think otherwise?”
And it’s Sherlock. Beautiful, brilliant Sherlock, who never loses his composure in the face of murderers and terrorists, who didn’t bat an eye when Irene Adler (whom John must begrudgingly admit was an exceptionally attractive woman) leaned in so close to him that he must have had a front row seat to her cleavage, who’s said time and time again that he abhors all emotion. That same beautiful, brilliant Sherlock is now in bed beneath him, stark bollocks naked, and pulling him down on top with a burning urgency in his gaze and a burning urgency detectable at a place still lower. John finds that he has no problem whatsoever maintaining his erection in the presence of Sherlock in this state. On the contrary, the real problem might be to control himself long enough for this not to end rather embarrassingly prematurely.
as though he is and it most certainly doesn’t give him the satisfaction that it used to. Just the danger and anxiety and sleepless nights, the need for a drink and the stiffness in his legs and shoulders. The fear that Sherlock might not make a narrow escape the next time there is a close call. The heartache.
Jim breaks out in a triumphant smirk. “Well then.”
“Were you losing consciousness? Are you tired? How do you feel?”
“Oh, Lord…” Mycroft sighs exasperatedly through the phone.
And John can’t tell Sherlock his own secrets. He just can’t.
John stands in silence for seconds that seem to stretch into a minor eternity with Sherlock sitting in front of him equally quietly, each looking at the other, observing, deducing perhaps, but neither of them says a word. Sherlock is lightly flushed from his outburst. Perhaps he’s ashamed at his admittance. John has never truly understood the way Sherlock’s aversion to his own humanity works, but at least now he’s finally beginning to grasp how deep it runs.
Not that Sherlock has too many such nights in his memory to draw on for reference.
Their couch is a bit on the smallish side, at least with the way the leather cushions have started to dip towards the middle. The tilt guides them closer and their thighs brush when Sherlock sits down. A pleasant tingle runs up his spine.
There’s no denying the bitterness in his tone. Sherlock is about to end the call and switch off the phone when Mycroft speaks again. He naturally can’t allow Sherlock’s confirmation to be the parting line. Regardless of what John seems to think, it’s Sherlock’s informed opinion that Mycroft is the one most likely to outlive God trying to have the last word.
“What do you have to figure out?”
Now he’s here. He should have put a stop to it a long time ago, but he hasn’t been able to bring himself to do it. Even now, he’s pathetically waiting for John to return and make it all seem just a tiny bit more bearable rather than actually trying to fix the problem for himself. An addict through and through.
John's life at present is one big mess of unanswered questions, glances, expressions, words and silences that he doesn’t understand. It’s frankly exhausting being as confused and unsure about everything as he’s been since that bloody kiss and it doesn’t seem to get better as the days pass. On the contrary, phone calls from Mary and seemingly random acts of intimacy from Sherlock make everything increasingly complex and difficult to figure out.
It happens from one moment to the next.
Jim’s voice rises in urgency.
But not this time. This time they talk.
“Yes.”
He heads for the posher end of town. The sort of shopping area he only pays a visit when Sherlock drags him along, which has happened once or twice at most. John has absolutely no idea if Sherlock has a preference for any particular brand or shop. He’ll just have to wing it. So he heads into the first and best high end shop selling men’s suits and accessories, ignores the looks of some of the other customers (and some of the staff as well, if he’s being honest) and asks to see their collection of cufflinks.
But it
“Well… legal means. Official means.” He shrugs. “Take your pick. But as I was officially dead, as Moriarty’s network
John almost physically cringes at that, feeling retched for acknowledging it even if it’s done in the privacy of his own head. They’ve been married a damn month, it’s a little too late for cold feet and a little too early for major regrets. And what about Mary? Mary has done nothing wrong, been everything she promised John she would be and more and yet here he is, lying beside her in
He’s alone with this. Even if Mary doesn’t seem to have noticed.
“Christ, Sherlock!”
Sherlock feels his stomach drop. He has a habit of starting conversations without thinking it through and then never finishing once he realises what he was going to say. A habit that’s only been accentuated by his distressingly slow state of mind and the unprecedented emotional upheavals of the last weeks. But John usually lets him get away with it. Respects that Sherlock oftentimes ends up starting to say things he’d rather leave unsaid. Not so today, apparently.
Moriarty chuckles softly, inspecting his cuffs with abandon as though he has all the time in the world. Perhaps he does.
I woke up! And I don’t regret it, but… but perhaps again, I do! Because now I’m back here and you’re here for now, but you won’t stay! You can’t stay, for exactly the same reason that you couldn’t stay that day! You can’t stay because you have a home and a wife and a life far, far away from me! And I understand that! I made my choices and you made yours, that’s just the way it is, but I wish I had chosen differently! I wish none of this had happened! I wish I hadn’t made so many mistakes! I know you have to go back soon and I respect that, you have your own life and I won’t get in the way of that. But even if I’m not trapped in my own head anymore, it still feels the same! That I’m alone and… and I can’t talk to anyone! No one can hear me and no one can understand! And now I don’t even have Jim anymore! I’m all alone again! I know I’ve made the bed I lie in, but it’s just too… too unbearable to watch you go! Too unbearable that you’re so far away from me and I’m just here alone!”
Then there’s also Mary. Is any of this fair to her?
Then there’s John himself. The loss and betrayal, the heartbreak and shame, the guilt and deep, gut-wrenching
and suddenly everything is alright and back to normal. Far from it. John isn’t in a forgiving mood. Right now, he isn’t even sure if he wants to see Sherlock again at all. The hurt is still too raw and Sherlock definitely didn’t seem repentant enough for John to even consider forgiving him. More as though this whole thing has been one gigantic joke and he doesn’t understand why John isn’t laughing. No, John definitely isn’t feeling as though the last two years don’t matter. In fact, he seriously doubts whether it will ever be alright, whether he and Sherlock can ever go back to how it used to be or whether the mere sight of Sherlock will be enough to set off all this hurt again and again for the rest of John’s life.
He thinks back to Mary’s words from a lifetime ago – “There is nothing in this world I would not do to stop that happening” – and finds himself in agreeance with the sentiment if not with the meaning.
But that can’t be right. His phone shows 5:44 AM, which Sherlock knows for a fact is impossible. He took his dose and entered his mind palace around that time. It’s been several hours since, he isn’t even high anymore. For Christ’s sake, he can see the light intruding into the living room from between the curtains. It must be noon, it simply must be. Maybe even later, judging by the angle at which the light is entering the flat.
. In the upper left-hand corner, Sherlock has scrawled the date: three weeks before.
John is looking right at him, unconcerned with Moriarty, unconcerned with his situation, unconcerned with anything but Sherlock. Sherlock can see miles and miles into those eyes and he can’t do as Jim asks, he
“Under control?” He’s breathing through his nose.
“You cock…”
– in his most disgusted tone, as though it’s a bad word that he finds it below himself to pronounce.
“What about Mary?” he says at last and it feels about the same as a well-placed punch to the stomach. The air is knocked out of John, or so it feels like.
Sherlock’s breath leaves him as a shudder. Awfully familiar words. Lies.
He longs to reassure, to comfort and protect. But what Sherlock is saying… John can make promises, but there’s no guarantee that he will be able to keep them. Because Sherlock is right. John has a life far away from Sherlock now, a life that’s only temporarily allowing itself to be side-lined. Mary has most graciously decided to let John stay here for now, but it won’t last. And Mary is his wife. This is not how it used to be, back when John had one girlfriend after another and, despite thinking of them as important at the time, had very few moral qualms about pushing them aside in favour of Sherlock at a moment’s notice. He’s committed to Mary in a way he never was to any of his previous girlfriends. His responsibilities are different now. So should his priorities be.
Sherlock hums softly in response. He’s placated and follows Jim out of the car without further protest, receiving a hand in his and a light squeeze on the way as a reward.
“No.”
“What was it then?” He smiles. “And don’t pretend like you can’t remember, because it was quite clearly important.”
“So.”
“What do I think about what?”
”We’re getting to a graphic part again.”
The spectre of Mary flashes briefly in John’s mind as he unscrews the lid and pours the cool liquid out on his fingers. This doesn’t feel the way it usually does, this is new, but it’s not a good kind of new. It feels slippery and cold to the touch and reminds John of the consultation room at work, which isn’t exactly arousing. His momentary lapse in concentration must be visible on his face, because Sherlock registers it with frightening accuracy and echoes his uncertain expression, spread legs and all.
Jim takes him all over the city. The touristy Tower of London, where they dissolve into the most inappropriate of giggles over past robberies. Belgrave Square in Belgravia, where they stop at the former residence of a certain somebody to whom they are both marginally acquainted and Jim berates him for going out of his way to save her while also acknowledging that there was a certain degree of elegance to the manner in which the mission was executed and the execution prevented. Peckham, where they end up in a seedy back alley, loudly making deductions about people who are either too drunk or too high or both to pick up on it, much less offer any form of resistance to their insults. Whitechapel, where they walk in the footsteps of Jack the Ripper like a pair of ordinary tourists, each trying to up the other on grisly details and suggestions of plausible albeit untestable culprits. They get coffee at Starbuck’s, sandwiches at Pret’s, takeout at McDonald’s. It’s been an age since Sherlock has last felt as content as he does walking out of a McDonald’s on Leicester Square at 3 AM and finding a place to eat with Jim by his side, talking of everything and nothing, enjoying each other’s company, just
“And I’ll be there.”
He won’t need to consult with Mycroft after all.
They both look at each other for a moment, the silence tense between them.
“Serious ones?”
“He’s worried about you, dear,” Mrs. Hudson continues, seemingly oblivious to Sherlock’s physical response and obviously not intent on leaving before extracting a verbal one.
the same as it did in Afghanistan. One aspect of this ordeal is so vastly different from Afghanistan that a direct comparison is unsustainable.
For a short second it’s just that, a touch as light and fleeting as a ray of sunshine. As if asking permission. Then Sherlock tilts his head slightly and John places both hands on Sherlock’s cheeks, pulling him closer and deepening the kiss at the same time. Sherlock’s lips are warm against his own, soft and pliable and yet John isn’t satisfied. He opens his mouth the slightest bit. Sherlock follows suit and their breaths intermingle in the minute room between their lips. And just like that, the tenderness and hesitation morph into heat and all pretence of restraint go out the window. John pulls Sherlock closer still, urging their bodies to press against one another's, and Sherlock’s hands reach for his shoulders, holding on to him with a feverish desperation.
He’s made compromises in the past. Joining the army was one such compromise. A way to be reckless and abnormal and dangerous within a societally sanctioned, morally acceptable framework.
He tries to salvage it with an awkward “I didn’t mean…”, but he isn’t sure what he didn’t mean and his half-arsed, half-finished attempt at making it better only serves to do the opposite.
Sherlock deposits Rosie on the floor to take off his coat and scarf before he steps inside properly, likely hoping to keep the melting snow from his outer layers off the floor. But Rosie evidently has other plans. She rises immediately, resolutely using the coffee table for leverage, and before Sherlock has a chance to stop her, she’s across the floor in the direction of John’s armchair, leaving a nice little trail of puddles in her wake.
Sherlock scoffs, tone somewhat petulant. “I was observing. Other people.”
So yes. With the way things are between the three of them at the moment, prettily combined with the current situation and the uncertainty and guilt it brings… Mary’s welcome is wearing thin at about the same rate as John’s excuses. Which isn’t exactly helping to ease his guilty conscience either.
When Sherlock finally loosens his pout and opens his mouth, he takes John completely by surprise.
One moment, Sherlock is lying  in bed, every bit as motionless as normal. It’s nearing eleven o’clock and most visitors have left the hospital by now. There’s a hush over the hallway and John is settling in for another night by Sherlock’s bedside, overtired and anxious, but otherwise enjoying the temporary peace and quiet.
John chuckles, but it sounds so sad it damn near breaks Sherlock’s heart.
“That wasn’t my choice.”
Christmas is just a couple of days away and being out and about in London is frankly a nightmare. Everywhere you look, there are people rushing by looking for presents or buying additional stuffing or talking loudly into their phones complaining of that family dinner they’re dreading or taking care of the other seventeen thousand preparations that need to be made before Christmas can arrive.
That being said, I really hope you're enjoying the story. If you want, please, please, please comment and/or give kudos, they're the stuff dreams are made of and I really appreciate your feedback. You can also contact me on my tumblr, @the-signs-of-two, if you have any comments, questions or just want to get talking. I'm always open for that!
Mary waits expectantly until John concedes to her unspoken request and elaborates.
he’s missed this and he can’t help but smile at Sherlock in a way that even John himself recognises as being a bit not good. It must certainly be very noticeable at least, since it causes Sherlock to momentarily cease his explanations in favour of raising an eyebrow quizzically.
John closes the book and glances in Sherlock’s direction. He’s wrapped up all snug, dark curls splaying out across the pillows. John can see his right arm where it’s protruding from underneath the duvet. His skin is almost paler than the sheets. More translucent somehow. The duvet rises and falls steadily in time with his breaths.
“You look as though you doubt the evidence of your eyes.”
It takes a second. It takes quite a lot of seconds, actually. John begins to count them out in his head after a few moments. He’s at sixteen before Sherlock finally gets a sound out.
But then again, Rosie’s status as the single most marvellous child yet bestowed upon mankind is close to a scientific fact. Sherlock can't honestly say he doesn't feel 100% justified in his assertion of her superiority in comparison to the children of all the other doting parents.
The path in front of him is not going to be littered with any pieces of John Watson.
The coffee scalds his tongue.
It shouldn’t have bothered him. He’s Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock doesn’t exactly use his mind palace the way it’s meant to be used, of course. In its simplest form, the mind palace is meant to work like looking at a map with each dot representing a specific piece of information. It can then be elaborated to look like a specific location, each item, room or segment being assigned a meaning. That’s the model that Sherlock started with and it worked for years. A recreation of his bedroom at his parents’ house morphing into his flat on Montague Street morphing into the living room at Baker Street to store personal information. A briefing room that was elaborated as Sherlock actually went to a police station for the first time to store information relevant to any on-going cases. A laboratory to store information on chemistry, as well as some of his more job-specific knowledge. And a storeroom for anything not fitting neatly into any of the other rooms, equipped with a computer for Sherlock to quickly search for any specific information he might need. It worked perfectly.
Instead, John finds himself somewhat annoyed by her behaviour this evening. Her initial shock and disbelief had only mirrored his own and been no more than anyone could expect given the circumstances. But then she’d bloody gone and sided with
“You were gone,” Sherlock repeats, his voice rising slightly in what sounds like desperation. “I didn’t intend to, I know I can’t do it, not now, but I just needed to know…”
Nothing. There’s no reply, no movement on the stairs, no sounds at all apart from the muffled roar of cars passing by outside. Has she gone out? Shopping for groceries maybe? It’s about that time of day. Yet Sherlock has been lying here for the better part of four hours, and he’s positive that he’s not heard the front door at any point during all that time.
“Find anything interesting?” When Mary is this close, her perfume mixes with all the familiar scents from Baker Street, cigarettes and tea and various chemical odours from Sherlock's experiments. It doesn't really go well together.
It doesn’t take much to get him going either. A smile, a laugh, no more than a certain look, a certain sparkle in Sherlock's eyes.
body anymore... if he tried to explain, just maybe John might be able to understand, at least a little. If anyone could understand, wouldn't it be John?
It’s fun to sit here and feel superior, to once again feel in control of the situation, to once again feel raised above the every-man stumbling through life with no real insight into the world around him. It’s amusing to uncover the secrets of others without their knowledge, to look around and deduce the innermost thoughts of random passersby, to place people under the microscope and dissect their lives, turn them into unwilling and entirely unknowing lab rats and then let them move on with their lives, oblivious to the whole process. It’s downright laughable to listen to Jim’s deductions, to hear him proclaim the most absurd and unrealistic results and yet see how it all adds up once he begins to explain his ludicrous assumptions.
Then he reconsiders.
-smile that John masters to perfection. Sherlock knows that one only too well. Instead it’s the warm, deep, verging on sentimental and therefore slightly uncomfortable for both of them smile that Sherlock hasn’t seen in what feels like forever.
There’s a low splash as his left foot descends on a puddle. Sherlock looks down instinctively.
The atmosphere down here is so thick and damp that it’s cloying. It reminds him of a Serbian cell he does not wish to be reminded of.
And everything be damned, it feels perfect in a way no other kiss ever has. It feels tender and careful and gentle and frantic and unapologetic and urgent all at once, as though it’s something fragile and something deviously intense at the same time.
Sherlock can’t say he minds. It’s surprisingly agreeable to be coddled when it’s John who’s doing the coddling.
To be perfectly honest, John is enjoying their reading sessions just as much as Sherlock is, if not more. There’s something utterly tranquil and domestic about it. John could have sworn he would find it tedious and God knows he’s never imagined Sherlock to be the kind of person who could stand having someone else read aloud for them as a child, much less as an adult. Yet it’s somehow just about perfect, in that weird, slightly dysfunctional way that stems from doing childish things just for the heck of it and finding that you like it way better now than you did when you were a child.
John speaks out of the blue and Sherlock turns to look at him questioningly.
Mycroft appears within the hour, characteristically uncalled for in every sense of the word. No one’s contacted him. He must have been keeping tabs on Sherlock in order to get here this quickly. John can’t be bothered to feel offended on Sherlock’s behalf, not even roll his eyes or make a sarcastic remark. He just feels a vague frustration that Mycroft has enough surveillance on his brother to track his movements and yet only shows up now, when it’s already far too late. Perhaps it’s even a slight sense of betrayal, John doesn’t bother to check. Having the power to stop disasters from happening in the first place yet preferring to let the events play out and then look into solving the problems after said disasters have already happened… that could almost be considered a Holmes family trait.
with me and Rosie, I want..."
Sherlock had turned at that, looked at him. “I know. I was there.”
Then he places his own hand on top of Sherlock’s as he sits down on the edge of the bed, fingers curling around Sherlock's as gently as John feels capable of. He doesn’t think too much about it. It’s what feels right.
Sherlock’s head snaps towards him and their eyes meet. He still doesn’t say anything, but it breaks the cloying air of disconnected disinterest hanging around him.
Because everything that Jim has said about Sherlock and John and all of it is true.
Much to John’s regret, Sherlock pulls a little away to look at him with that serious determination.
The air feels positively electric between them.
Sherlock is biting his lower lip with enough force to make it go white around his teeth. John wants to object, can feel the air with which to voice it pressing against his throat, but he keeps his tongue. Sherlock is not done talking. And he delivers the objection himself.
Sherlock exhales in a huff. “It’s not you, I know that! I know it’s just a figment of my imagination, I know that what you say in my head isn’t
Sherlock sounds small and lost. Sherlock is not small and lost. Sherlock is self-confident and sassy, bratty and entitled, arrogant and so full of himself he’s almost literally larger-than-life. Hearing him like this, sounding for all the world like an insecure little boy afraid of saying the wrong thing, admitting that he’s not actually a machine, admitting, perhaps for the first time, that he has emotions and feelings and feels just as lonely as anyone else would in his place, that he isn’t impregnable or invulnerable… It feels so goddamn
It’s pathetic, really. John has been to Afghanistan. He’s been face to face with people wielding bombs, guns and grenades with deadly intent. He’s been held hostage by psychopathic genius supervillains, been shot at with poisonous arrows, been stuck in a bonfire and nearly burned alive, been inside of a train cart rigged with enough explosives to take down the entire tube network as well as the Houses of Parliament directly above them. All of that, he’s lived through without suffering a nervous breakdown. It’s not as though being in significant danger of being burned alive, blown apart or shot dead have been in any way relaxing experiences and they certainly haven’t contributed to lowered levels of stress or anxiety on John’s part, but he’s faced those situations with considerably more calm and stoicism than he’s currently exhibiting in the face of this prolonged silence of unspoken feelings. The sad truth of it is that John finds himself less afraid of being blown to smithereens inside a tube compartment seconds before having the entire Houses of Parliament collapse in on the already unrecognizable bits of his body than he is of starting a conversation with Sherlock bloody Holmes.
“I did!” he repeats and gets up from the couch, leaving Sherlock feeling undeniably cold and abandoned. He begins to pace, rubbing furiously at his mouth. Then he seems to reach a decision and turns back to face Sherlock.
There’s no rush about the adrenaline release this time. Just sheer panic.
The electrical current passes between them again. Jim’s eyes practically ignite and the air between them seems to vibrate with unreleased tension.
Everything inside of John seems to twist then, and he very briefly feels as though the floor has disappeared from underneath him. His stomach drops, his vocal chords tangle themselves up in knots, the blood rushing past his ears drown all other noise and his brain seems to screech to a halt as the adrenaline floods his system with more force than it has at any point since the last time he was knelt like this over Sherlock’s body, staring blindly at the blood on the pavement.
When he became a doctor, that was his rational want. When he started dating a whole string of female fellow students, that was his rational want. When he started dating Mary, that was his rational want. Shit, even when he decided to propose, that was his rational want. He’s wanted to do all of it. Just not in a passionate, unstoppable
Now… well, now
“Sherlock? Sherlock, can you hear me? If you can, please say something.”
And yet here he is. He doesn’t understand, but he’s willing to listen. He doesn’t try to explain, because he can’t, but he wants Sherlock to explain it to him. He wants to know, even if Sherlock knows that he doesn’t really.
In that moment, John completely regrets ever inviting Mary to come. It had seemed like a good idea, a healthy choice to avoid exactly the kind of scenario Mary is now accusing him of: one in which he’d stay here with Sherlock in a little bubble of their own, completely cut off from the real world and the consequences of their actions. But Mary is right. It’s already like that and what he’s trying to do is to prolong that carefree atmosphere that isn’t good for anything other than sheer escapism. And Mary is probably right about the rest of it, too: if he stays, their relationship is all but over. They’ve been married for a couple of months and already he’s managed to race down the path of adultery, confess it all and then unbelievably demand to be allowed to head even further into what everyone should be able to recognise as a complete and utter train wreck waiting to end in a divorce. All that before they’ve even bloody started to experience what married life is like!
to ask, and that’s… there’s no excuse for that. I’m just… I’m sorry. It doesn’t even begin to cover it, but I don’t know what else to say, so there’s that. And I’d like to hear about it. All of it. Not right now, of course, but when you want to talk about it, I’d like to hear it. And that evening too, at the restaurant, that was… Jesus, I was such a mess. But again, that’s no excuse. And I’m sorry for that too.”
John opens the door and looks around the familiar living room, expecting to find Sherlock either comfortably reclined in his chair with his violin or his laptop, wrapped only in a blanket or a dressing gown, or pacing the flat from wall to wall in a terrible state of agitation due to withdrawal. John is prepared for either sight. But there’s no sign of him. He might be in the loo, but John can’t detect any sound of movement or running water and the door isn’t closed. So he’s probably not out of bed yet and likely to be asleep still.
But it’s almost as though, seeing as Sherlock is unconscious and probably unable to experience anything in his current state, John is watching his life flash before his eyes in his place.
“I’m not crying,” John corrects her, but even that, true though it is, comes out as a strangled gasp. “I’m not crying.”
“I don’t want you to be normal. I don’t want you to be good. I don’t want you to be anything but what you are. I don’t want you to be anything but what you were
eyes, and he can see life happening around him, but he can’t participate. He can’t share. No one
The truth is, John hasn’t thought this through. Not any of it. And while he’s desperate to talk, he isn’t actually ready to have this conversation yet. He has no idea what he wants or how he’s supposed to get it. He has no idea how he feels about Sherlock or Mary or any of it and he needs time to think about these things. He kissed Sherlock because it had felt right in the moment, it wasn’t something he’d intended to do and it most certainly wasn’t something he’d planned in advance. This is not the first step of some elaborate plan to undo his old mistakes. He’s just adding new ones with a speed that takes his breath away and he needs time.
“I can’t.”
“Come on, now,” Jim whispers into his ear, arm curled around him like a snake. “Ask me for help and I will help you. One little word, Sherlock. One little word and it’s all over.” He sounds so reassuring. As though all of this is alright, as though he isn’t asking Sherlock to… to…
“… need to get out of the house for something else than work. That’s just what the doctor ordered, you know. And your inbox must be bursting by now.”
, you didn’t even mean
If he had any decency, he’d tell both Mary and Sherlock to stay the hell away from him, because he’s not worth it. He doesn’t deserve any of them. But he’s too weak to say that. He already knows he’d never be able to go through with actually trying to push any of them away, even if it was for their own sake. He’s not like Sherlock. He couldn’t bear to isolate himself for the sake of others.
What raw delight in that sing-song voice.
If Mary truly isn’t coming back, it might be Sherlock’s fault, but only because John was too weak to claim Sherlock’s words as his own.
John’s doctor voice kicks in, but he barely notices. He does, however, vaguely register that he’s asking questions too quickly for Sherlock to answer any of them.
Sherlock starts violently. His eyes fly open, looking straight into a pair of brown ones so close to his that the smirk spreading across his visitor’s face only shows itself in a slight crinkling around the eyes and a lifting of the cheeks. There’s a sudden drop in the oxygen levels of the immediate vicinity.
He doesn’t say anything about Mary. Perhaps he doesn’t need to. His feelings on the matter are plainly audible between his words. John doesn’t know how to react to that. He’d thought that Sherlock and Mary were friends, that they cared for one another in much the same way as John and Sherlock care for each other (well… not in the same way as John
it breaks John’s heart and yet there’s a part of him thinking that Sherlock has never been more beautiful, never been more real, never felt more sincere. Never been closer. As though the moon, ever ethereal and beautiful to behold, yet so mysterious and remote it feels like something from another world, has suddenly allowed John to touch it. To feel its scars and craters. His heart seems to swell as surely as it breaks.
"You have tried for so long to be who John Watson wanted you to be. Why not be who you are instead?”
Sherlock is still stammering out a defeated “I don’t…” when John crosses the distance between them and kisses him with more passion than he’s ever kissed another person in all his life. Sherlock is pushed halfway back against the wall by the force of their collision.
And then there’s a rustling of leaves and branches around his feet and Sherlock is pulling him out and he’s shouting his name and cupping his face and John’s vision is still blurry but Sherlock’s face is about the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen in his life and that thought is said out loud in his head before he has time to stop it. Mary’s even blurrier face is registered only as an afterthought.
“Well, one should always keep one’s options open.” Sherlock says it with a shrug and what looks to be a very weak attempt at a grin. Trying to brush him off. Trying to lighten the mood. Trying to make it all into one big joke as though they’re not talking about Sherlock’s life. And what feels like John’s, too.
Having made up his mind, John almost changes it again when he enters the living room. Sherlock is already awake, but he’s clearly not as well as he had been yesterday. There are dark circles under each eye and he’s sitting on the floor with his legs drawn up to his chest, staring off into the distance. He doesn’t react at all when John enters and just makes a dismissive sound when John asks if he’d like a cup of tea. John isn’t quite able to decipher if he’s not feeling well or if he’s just deep in thought.
“Do you wish to leave me?” she repeats slowly, deliberately dragging her words out to make them stand out clearer. She’s still calm.
At first, John interprets it as a stare, a continuation of the deducing glance he’s just sported. The one he uses on murder victims at crime scenes. But there’s no frown of concentration, no pupils darting back and forth inquisitively. He’s just staring. For a second, John is almost worried that Sherlock might have suffered a setback. That what he’s seeing are the first signs of a relapse into unconsciousness. His muscles tense up in preparation of catching Sherlock if he should suddenly collapse.
Sherlock swallows.
So without further ago...
John smiles again. “Well, it doesn’t matter now, does it?”
, Sherlock
“Why are you here?”
“We both know it’s true. You will always feel, Sherlock. You've already proved that you can master it. You've done that all your life. But the way he makes you feel… you don’t quite know if you want to master that or not. And if you don't know, you can’t do it. So you break your neck and he breaks your neck and on and on it goes until you end up here. With me.” Jim’s face softens. “But I want you to get better. And I believe you can.”
She does speak eventually. When it’s nearing nine o’clock and John still hasn’t uttered a single sentence comprised of more than three words, Mary suggests that they go home. She does it gently, all softness and understanding. Mary as a nurse. Professional tone of voice that she’s been taught to use when addressing grieving relatives and friends judged to be less than fully functioning in the face of their dear ones’ injuries. John’s been through that course too, he knows the drill. Gentle pat on the shoulder, reassuring smile, calm voice, relaxed demeanour. He even knows how easy it is to fall back on your medical training when you don’t know how to handle a particular situation. Tailoring medical expertise to a personal experience is not the easiest thing to do. So he doesn’t mind Mary’s tone all that much. Her arguments are not devoid of logic either, not by a long shot, so John hears her out.
, right here and now in this moment, consequences be damned.
But it’s always been a double-edged sword, a push-pull of alternating fear and attraction. Moriarty repels him and yet draws him in. Like a tide washing over him one moment and pulling him out on deep water the next.
But really John just thinks of Sherlock hesitating to call him out of some misplaced sense of obligation to not be bother when John should be happy with someone else and all John feels is a deep ache.
Sherlock can’t remember having felt a sense of belonging this strongly since an evening long ago in an inn on Dartmoor. It was their last night there. He had been unreasonable the night before. He can’t remember what for anymore, nor what the argument had been about. But he had apologised. And John had listened. It had been a revelation at the time, equal parts embarrassment at what had amounted to an admission of guilt and defeat mixed with fascination at the idea that John had been able to make him do it. About twelve hours of the silent treatment and the great Sherlock Holmes, who was never wrong and certainly never admitted to any wrongdoing, had been ready to apologise and mean it. That John had actually listened and been willing to accept his apology for what it was had been another revelation. So many times Sherlock has botched something up because of his big mouth and scathing deductions. Most of the time he doesn't really care. If people can't handle a simple truth, they're not worthy of his time and energy. But just a few times it had mattered. Just a few times he had regretted his words afterwards, regretted them as soon as he saw the back of someone he’d wanted to know better, someone he’d wanted to make laugh, one time even someone he’d wanted to touch.
It’s as though John is back on the battlefield. The stress accompanying a threat of imminent disaster. The anxiety over the safety of people he cares about. The sleepless nights. The omnipresent need for a drink that goes unsatisfied due to the knowledge that he’s needed where he is and needed in an alert, sober state at that. The sense of duty keeping him at his post, the certainty that it would be
“Go away, please.”
“Why not?”
“I need your answer, Mycroft, as a matter of urgency.”
, he’s
It feels like coming home, which Sherlock can’t help but puzzle at, as he can’t recall them ever having done this before. Casual intimacy had been an everyday occurrence back before the Fall, unavoidable with two people living in such close proximity to one another for months. Exchanged glances that Sherlock, with his limited vocabulary for such things, would be hard pressed to describe as anything but fond or even affectionate had happened more times than they perhaps should have. The occasional fleeting touch of hand to hand or even hand to knee had… well, that had happened too.
“But Sherlock…”
there either. And it’s strange and surreal and
Worn out from the day's adventures, John and Sherlock and all the others were brought back to the airport by a police officer.
John smiled. “I… I want to…No, I think, I don’t need to. You already know.” He took hold of Sherlock’s neck to pull him down again for another heart-stopping kiss. They held tight to each other and poured every tiny bit of their love for each other into that kiss. There were no more words needed.
“Anything yet?”
There he goes. Reading a romance. It wouldn’t hurt him, right? Just words, letters. Nothing he couldn’t handle. And maybe he would also find a solution to his own problem, his love for his best friend.
“Deal.” She extended her hand.
“Those are trained people. They would have noticed if someone left with a car and stopped him. And because no one did, the killer is either still here with us or in the next forest.”
After some weeks, when Sherlock had read every single romance in the house – he had also visited Mrs. Hudson to lend some books from her – he and John decided to go to the book store. They stood in front of the novel and romance isle for at least an hour, before leaving the bookstore with three full-packed bags.
But in the end, his love for John was the only thing that made him start reading one of those books that John hadn’t stopped offering him at least once in a week.
He sighed and moved his hand through his hair. He needed to get back into the living world. The book had captured him in a way that felt somewhat odd but also kind of pleasant. He couldn’t quite grasp it.
“What? Yes, yes you’re right.”
He told himself. He had to start with the next questioning. As he got up he saw Sherlock grabbing a walkie-talkie himself. So that’s probably how he wanted to stay in contact. Very well.
But what exactly did he do different from the other times he tried to get his friend to read his books? He couldn’t say. He had no idea. It must have been something though.
They were kissing. John’s eyes widened with shock and he let out a quiet gasp. He seemed to have forgotten what had happened around them because not even two seconds after he was already kissing back. Closing his eyes, he pressed his lips harder against Sherlock’s.
“Lestrade? Have you seen Sherlock?”
Sherlock in the meantime had made it almost to the end of the forest, he could already see more light. Finally, he left the last trees behind him but he couldn’t stop just now as the killer was still after him. In the distance, he could see where all the tables stood and more and more people crowding the area to see what was happening. And then his eyes fixed on the figure which was directly running at him.
“Thank you, but I’d prefer take away for tonight.”
“Drop the axe!” A threatening voice of a woman said and he saw several other people were pointing their guns at him. He was surrounded. There was no other option than to drop his weapon or he would die in a gunfire.
John was happy. Finally, someone he could share his enthusiasm with.
Sherlock slowed down a little so that he wouldn’t run John over, he extended his arms towards John’s face. John had also reduced his speed, as he didn’t want to run directly into that axe, which was now almost directly pointed towards them. He was about to move his gun in front of him as his eyes quickly moved to Sherlock.
With a quiet sigh Sherlock looked from the book’s cover into John’s eyes. They were a very deep blue, like a storm growing inside but at the same time steady and calm. Sherlock got lost again. That usually never happened – only with John.
John made his world go crazy. John made him blind, deaf, mute and numb all at once but at the same time he had never seen as clear, heard as much, talked as loud and felt as amazing as when he was with John. Oh, what would he give to be able to tell him.
Sherlock could see John’s eyes. They glowed like in the real world. They were such a deep and meaningful blue. And the sparkles in his eyes coming from the golden light around him were like stars in the clear night sky.
One step left.
He could almost feel John’s warmth. He saw his hands coming up to his face. Suddenly book-John was right in front of him. They had stopped running to not crash into each other. John was near, he was there, right in front of him and suddenly book-John wrapped his hands around his neck and pulled him down. The second their lips touched Sherlock felt like he was flying. Finally, finally he had what he always had wanted. He wrapped his own arms around John’s waist and kissed back. John’s lips were so soft and warm. He pulled John a little tighter to him and –
“Interesting place for a murder.” John stated.
John turned around and went into the kitchen. Probably to make tea, Sherlock thought. Yes. He noticed he had stared again and quickly looked down at the book, still clutched in his hands.
“He must have a steady hand a good aiming.”
Sherlock and John were still standing in their own little bubble, kissing and holding each other. Neither of them wanted to let go of the other. Besides Sherlock was still not sure if this happened for real or if his mind palace had completely taken over. The only thing he knew was, that this felt unbelievable real and he wouldn’t want to miss it for anything else in the world.
“I know that. As you said the police was here fairly quickly because the bride and groom wanted some safety at their wedding and there already were some security guards. Two of them working for the police.”
“Okay, keep going. And oh, if you see Sherlock, please bring him back here.”
The next morning, he already sat in the kitchen when John came downstairs. Sherlock heard a soft “Good morning, Sherlock” as John went to get his tea. It was quiet and calm. The only thing Sherlock missed was a good morning kiss… No, no, no! He couldn’t start thinking like that! Especially not if John was near. Instead he crooked out a “Good morning” himself.
“Why aren’t you asking John this question?”
It was completely quiet in the kitchen, each of them unaware of the other’s troubled thoughts.
“See what? The bloody body of a woman? Yes.”
John couldn’t believe it. Sherlock really had read his book – and liked it. So much that he wanted to read another. He had tried for months to get Sherlock to read something else than work related stuff. And now it really had worked. He couldn’t be happier. He immediately thought of the next book he could show Sherlock. There were so many. But he didn’t want to overwhelm him. He was just so happy.
He had last seen him, when they questioned the guests for the second time. John grabbed the walkie talkie to ask Lestrade if he knew where Sherlock was.
“Now what? Should we look for a person carrying an axe? And how did he kill them without anyone noticing?” Lestrade asked.
Then off to the next book. Another journey through the fight for the perfect life that only comes with the love you’d die for.
to the white shirt John was still wearing.
“Yes!” Sherlock almost shouted happily. John beamed with pride. Sherlock was happy. Happy that John understood something normally only he would understand. “Yes. But you know what?” Sherlock asked again.
“Care to make a bet? I say they are together before the end of the month.” She grinned.
“I believe he paralyzed them first with one hit directed to the middle of their faces, so they couldn’t fight him anymore and he finished his work with precision.”
“It’s most likely a ‘him’. Look at the force the axe has been driven into him. I don’t see a woman doing that.”
John had put one hand (in which he was still holding his gun) around Sherlock’s waist and the other one clutched his shirt. While Sherlock caressed John’s jaw lovingly with his left hand, the right one entangled in his hair.
Even though the characters in the story had their happy ending - after some struggles of course – didn’t mean he could project that into the real world. It doesn’t work that easily, does it?
“Where are you?” He shouted again into his device.
“Do you have any other books like the one you gave me yesterday? To read obviously?”
He had wanted to ask a question – no, actually he had not - and John was probably waiting to give an answer.
At first, he didn’t want it to be true. He did notice how he craved for John’s proximity when he was in the hospital for work and he had to stay in their flat alone. He knew that he couldn’t sleep or even sit down calmly if he didn’t know where exactly John was and if he was all right. He wanted John to be with him forever. He wanted him, just him.
“But that’s at least two hours ago.” John started to worry now.
After dropping his axe, he was immediately shoved to the ground.
Slowly, John and Sherlock stopped kissing, until only their lips where softly touching. John had loosened his grip on Sherlock’s shirt and his breathing had evened out, so did Sherlock’s. They just stood there, holding each other, and finally opened their eyes. Blue eyes met grey ones, their foreheads were touching, both smiled softly and felt completely content with the world.
There was an annoyed huff from the other end – probably Donovan – and it got quiet once again.
“That’s not important right now. What happened?”
After Sherlock had told him everything, John went once again through the event which had happened a few hours ago, still not believing that it had actually happened.
The detective held John’s face carefully in his hands and cupped his jaw. They moved their lips as if they had never done anything else.
Suddenly he felt something cold against the back of his head.
Through the walkie talkie John could hear Lestrade asking the other officers for news.
He took his jacket and went into the living room to get Sherlock.
It was the best answer he could manage without looking too suspicious but in the back of his mind he knew it didn’t work. If John knew that he lied he hid it quite well.
Sherlock might need one of those books, too he thought often. Yes, he was a brilliant person and explained everything with logic and science (not always logical for the people around him though). But sometimes he figured he’d need some distance to it, too.  Sherlock often retreated to his ‘mind palace’ for doing so but was that always the best way? John only wanted to help.
Sherlock wanted to forget about it. Wanted to delete this memory. He didn’t want it to be true that books and stories had such a huge effect on him. He always had been rational. But then again, he had always believed that love was something that simply didn’t exist and that it was dangerous. It made people do the most stupid things.
The wedding place was in the middle of a great field. To the north and south you could find a forest just some hundreds of meters away. The part of the woods in the west was farther but you still could see them clearly. All of them were connected so it was pretty easy to disappear there.
Every time he had a romance novel in his hands he retreated to his mind palace. More than once he imagined more than just the scene in the book. Most of the time it was John, running over the field, distant calming melodies, both colliding and the kiss. But he never got to the point when they both separated. Sometimes the kiss took longer, sometimes it was shorter. Sherlock just didn’t want to end it.
At the same time, Sherlock had looked behind him to calculate if he’d reach John in time. But as he looked back up he saw something entirely different. It was like he was directly transferred into his mind palace.
“At first, I thought you wanted to distract your attacker, but now…” He smiled. “Congratulations. We’re heading back to the wedding, crime scene, remember? But take your time.”
“Did you… did you read the whole book, yesterday? Like, the whole” he asked.
That was until John Watson. As he – officially – moved into the flat he brought not only his clothes but also books. More books than there already were. Sherlock quickly discovered that these weren’t typical contents he thought an army doctor would read. No, really not. Books about a perfect life, the greatest love, happy endings – romance. Ugh! How could he?
“Yes, but I’m still wearing my shirt.”
This was like in John’s books, wasn’t it? He never talked about this type of feeling and he was extremely careful to not let anything slip out that could have exposed him. Over the time he got really good at it.
Lestrade switched back to his usual manner. “Two people are missing. A man who’s a good friend of both the bride and the groom and another young lady.”
“What?” Sherlock managed.
So, why should there be someone who’d want to murder them? Was he bored? Did he know them privately without them knowing each other? It was possible. But what had they done? He had murdered them in such a horrible way that there needed to be a reason.
“Try it! I’m sure you’ll like it.” he said with an excited voice.
But he had never understood why people should read things such as science fiction (okay, some physical theories but not likely possible) or fantasy or worse – romance. Those stories change people’s views of the world dramatically and he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on the task at hand, the reality. So, he never touched one and always avoided them in the bookstore.
It was soon after that the faces were replaced with familiar ones. One particular book started it all. The two main characters had no names and after the first five or so pages Sherlock imagined John and himself. Now he had connected the real world with his book and he and John were suddenly in the story facing all the dangers together. Almost like in the real world.
“I am wearing it too!”
“Oh no.” John moved his hand through his hair. “Do you think…?”
Utterly exhausted they got all their things and bags and weapons back together and as the first rays of the new morning sun hit the area and illuminated what had been dark before, they left. Behind them lay a day full of excitement, a crashed wedding, three bodies, huge worries, a chase for life and death and a kiss. A kiss confirming love and promising something even more beautiful to come.
“All right. No problem.” He said. “I’ll give you another book. You can tell me which you liked better if you want. We can discuss them. I’ve always wanted someone I could talk about those books with.”
Lestrade turned around to give his group their instructions. “And be careful. He already killed two people. With an axe. We don’t know what he might be up to.” They nodded.
At first Lestrade had thought it was one of Sherlock’s ideas to get the murderer, but now he wasn’t so sure anymore.
“Can I read it afterwards? I’m quite curious.”
But that was before he had met John Watson, so, he didn’t delete this memory.
Soon after, real-life-John came with their dinner and they sat down together and discussed today’s experiences. Books and work. It was a beautiful evening.
How could he be so gorgeous? Sherlock really, really wanted to go out with John but right now, after this experience he didn’t know if that was a good idea and it would be a platonic dinner of course. No romance at all. So, he declined.
Sherlock and John had no idea what their colleagues were talking about. They didn’t even notice. They were too wrapped up into each other’s scent and words and too busy to not let anything show.
