. Dean grunted when the swipe was followed by a little nip, soon soothed by another swipe of Castiel’s careful tongue. Dean’s knees felt weak and his head fuzzy, completely unlike how it usually felt when his nipples were played with.
, hey!” he mutters, swirling gracefully with his lid to avoid collision. The guy doesn’t even seem to notice him even though Dean gives him a glare before sitting down beside Sam. Typical. “Hey.”
“Yeah. So, I prepared this,” Dean bent down and got the forgotten bowl off the ground. The goop was cold now so he scooped that out, tossing it back into the pot over the fire so it could soften again and instead poured a fresh ladle into the bowl. “This is a poultice my mom taught me and my brother to make. I’ll put it over your wound, it’ll harden as it dries and it’ll help facilitate healing.”
Dean and Sam Winchester rode into town on a sunny spring afternoon of 1871, less bluster and more blisters than either of them had hoped for, but then that was what you got, after living on horseback for several months.
Of course, the pilots walking around in the plane isn’t such a common occurrence so Dean draws a lot of attention but there’s a specific set of blue eyes that catch his own interest. The man is fucking stunning. Sharp jaw, hair that begs to be pulled during sex. Dean perks up a little at the sight of him but immediately forces himself to calm down because fuck, he has to maintain a professional aura.
“You feel wonderful,” he murmurs and hears Dean’s breathing hitch.
Cas assumes he’s referring to the massive stack of papers provided by Mrs. Moseley. He puts them on the desk and sits down in his chair, gesturing for Mr. Adler to take a seat as well. He’s actually surprised Adler didn’t have the audacity to take Cas’ chair, it wouldn’t be the first time.
“So you hoped to come here and make a fortune but realized that it would probably only be enough to sustain you and that’s not good enough so you’re giving up?”
No, what had made Dean get up in the morning, saddle Creed, and tell Sam some flimsy excuse about supplies had been the fact that Cas had also liked what he’d been subjected to,
, wouldn’t it fit him perfectly?”
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean gasped, Castiel’s fingers falling from his mouth when his grasp got lax and his jaw dropped a little. “Right there,
“Aw come on, call me Dean.”
Most probably the angel would just be lying around, doing nothing. In a sense, Cas seemed like a huge cat, lazing around most of the day.
“You’re
(Yes, you make a fine human, Deanmon)
“I wanna…” fuck Dean could barely say it, it was too weird. Maybe sugarcoat it a little? “I wanna stretch out on your grass patch, naked, and I want you to lie on top of me.”
“Well put, Alpha,” John says with a smile, turning back to the sizzling steaks.
“Fucking hell,” Dean suddenly spits, flying to his feet. Cas expects teenagers with their raging hormones to have fast mood swings, but Dean is something spectacular to behold. “The fucking
Sam made a face and looked away. “I hung out with Jo and Jess. Dad was…”
This is the first time they’ve done something in his office since that time they sucked each other off and though Cas is loath to remember that time he thoroughly enjoys this now. The danger of getting caught adds an exciting thrill and he finds his body responding faster than usual, perhaps partially because of how erotic Dean is being, squirming wantonly in his lap.
“You’re right, of course,” Cas reaches for Dean’s hand but the boy slaps him away. “Dean please, you’ll understand when you’re older. We should end this before it gets worse, and never talk about it again. I think we—”
Dean spread his legs and hummed softly as he looked down his body at Cas, eyes hooded and sight switching to show him the man in all his glorious colors. Cas smiled gently down at him as he undressed and Dean pulled up his legs, showing off his hole, and put his hands against his nipples, pinching them lightly.
is more of a man than him.
“Not to be a drag or anything, but this kind of work doesn’t really come with insurance,” Dean drawls, lips quirking in a dry smile.
“You’re talking about the night I first licked you, among other things.”
“As if you’re whispering,” Dean rasped, vocalizing his own thoughts. “That was you speaking, before. And now, too,” he nodded to himself when the angel growled lowly in agreement. “I heard…” he’d heard
“Scotch?”
But to Dean’s dismay, Gary huffed, clearly long-suffering. “Come on, cut me some slack. Lynette’s full of arthritis and she’s always complaining about how everything hurts. I just want a quickie to let off some steam.”
Alpha so boisterously — felt good. Yes, even after such a short time Castiel is sure he wants to mate Dean, and preferably sooner rather than later, and after what was said during that dinner he feels sure that Dean wants the same thing.
“It’s fine,” Cas said dismissively. “Just use an open palm, slightly cupped like this,” he showed Dean and then brought his hand down hard on his right ass cheek. “Use force, I don’t want some weak love taps.”
“Cas!”
Cas has always had a keen but somewhat detached interest in all of his students, but this need to know more about Dean strikes him as strange and completely over-the-top, so he bites back his questions.
Dean looked around the room, most of his wardrobe spread out over the entire floor and his bed.
Joanna Beth was at the bar, which immediately made Dean cautious.
What happened to the new Charlie and her girlfriend? What happened to Donna and Jody and the girls? What happened to Garth? What happened to
Cas had explained to Dean that humans didn’t take too kindly to demons, something that Dean was all too familiar with, but that his appearance was different enough that they could pass him up as a satyr or faun, something most humans were more familiar with and less scared off. The only difference was that satyrs and fauns usually had on clothes. At least a shirt.
Though looking at the poor job the little creature had done, it was immediately clear to Castiel that enthusiasm only took you so far. Dean seemed proud of his tiny (and scattered) heaps of leaves, though, and the sight made Castiel’s heart tighten.
His mind fills with stupid and dangerous ideas. Maybe the man hadn’t been on a vacation after all, it would be awfully short if he had been, and maybe that means that he’s single? Dean’s refused to acknowledge it before but the man’s left ring finger had been empty, hadn’t it? Suddenly Dean starts entertaining the idea that the man lives in Houston, or at least around there, and that they can perhaps meet up later? Can exchange steamy gazes and phone numbers now and it’ll be something to tell the grandkids.
“Thank you for bringing it up,” he choked out and flipped his comforter to the side. “I didn’t want to say it myself, but it
“Great,” Dean repeated, his grin turning more lecherous. “And how
Dean is watching him with hooded, dark eyes as Castiel rights himself on the bed, and blurts another blob of lube on his fingers. He’s feeling generous tonight.
Or maybe Cas would be fine with continuing but Dean wouldn’t enjoy it anymore? He could still enjoy loveless sex with Cas now, because now Cas didn’t
He frowned to himself as Dean and Gabriel cheered about their fantastic dinner plans. He and Dean weren’t lovers and Castiel would do well to check himself in that regard. There was no law against human and cryptid relationships (of sexual nature), simply because cryptids were considered sentient enough to consent, unlike an animal. But like an animal, cryptids weren’t human (though some, like Dean, were humanoid) and though there was no law against it, it was still a social taboo and considered weird on all kinds of levels. Castiel, for his part, had never really considered the possibility, at least not until Gabriel and Kali.
Cas presses his nose against the side of Dean’s head. “Thank you.”
, to his secret desires and he thinks he’s an idiot for keeping it from Dean, what is he even afraid of? Last time he unloaded his most shameful desires, Dean accepted him with open heart and open arms, and it led to the wonderful life Castiel is leading now.
He really wishes he had someone else’s opinion than his mother’s to go on, positive as it was, he doesn’t really trust her when she pinches his cheeks and calls him adorable in that tone. He’s at least glad Michael isn’t home to tease him.
“Oh I’m sorry,” she said, surprised, and turned to the couch. “I didn’t realize—what the hell is
“I…” Cas looked torn between happy and flustered. It was cute. He bent down and nosed against Dean’s neck so that it tickled. “Thank you, Dean,” he murmured when Dean giggled and tried to push him off. “In any case I want you to know that you are perfect the way you are, I don’t want you to pretend to be something you’re not because what you are isn’t good enough. It’s just a precaution, do you understand the difference?”
With one press of his finger at the part just between his balls and ass, he made his back arch with pleasure and his dick leak at the tip.
All demons had black eyes.
“Not really,” Cas eventually answered just as Dean busied himself with sorting his pants out of his shirt. “Only when I suspect it’ll get good enough.”
“Please,” Dean rasped and judging by how his balls were creeping up Castiel would say that Dean was begging him to get on with it.
“Yeah, that’s the stuff,” he grunted. “Gimmie more of that, until I say it’s enough and then you can do whatever you want to get off, deal?”
“What’s that got to do with this?” Dean interrupts, eyes indignant. “I can’t have ‘altercations’ even though I’m a good student?”
It’s because Benny isn’t related to Dean, Castiel realizes. Benny, in that sense, is a threat, and his familiarity could imply either that there has been something between them before, or that the big burly man would like something to happen in the future.
“I’m back,” he stopped short, staring at Dean with surprise. “Uh, when’s the funeral?”
“Yeah,” he said, tone inviting now. “The water was really cold. Made my nipples totally erect, does it look weird?”
I hope y'all had a good start to the new year and I hope it stays good!
Dean turned back, hands on his hips. Great news, actually. This way it wouldn’t be killing him, and he could take angel meat home to the village, wouldn’t that be something? He grinned to himself, looking down at the dying angel. Hell, no one else was here, he could fucking claim the kill for himself. He probably wouldn’t, simply because it seemed unfeasible, but he
Dean’s throat felt thick and he turned to look up at the second story of the saloon. Cas’ room was on the other side and Dean didn’t know which room he was looking into but just the thought that Cas was still inside one of those goddamn rooms and not out here with Dean was enough to choke him.
“Thank you,” dad fake-sniffs. “I’ll have enough to deal with over that weekend without having to think about my house burning down.”
No, there was more to the demon, there was his sweet human side too, and Castiel found himself completely in over his heels in love with Dean as a whole.
“That too.”
“Dean?” Cas shuffled so that he ended up on his side, facing Dean. “Dean, come here.”
Damn afterglow was making him say all sorts of crazy shit, but he didn’t regret any of it when Cas smiled down at him as if Dean was something precious and worth fighting for.
“If you don’t mind,” Dean teases. “I want you to meet Benny.”
Warded? That was news to Dean.
But he didn’t want to, not today.
Cas takes a moment to sweep his gaze up and down Dean’s entire body, searching perfunctory for other visible injuries. Dean squirms and looks incredibly adorable but stands still, clutching his t-shirt in his hands.
“It ain’t just Heaven, Dean.” He says kindly. “It’s the Heaven you deserve.”
“Dean…”
, I-I
His underarms were fucking mouth-watering too and when he lifted his beer bottle in his left, mauled hand, Dean felt a pulse go through his whole body. He wanted that hand on his body and he wanted Cas’ lips to wrap around Dean’s dick
Cas has to steel himself. “Are you saying that you…?”
, so,” he attempted a causal shrug. Hard fail on that. “Yeah, you’re still my Cas, aren’t you?”
“Um,” Dean said eloquently.
“At this point anything’s possible,” Dean mumbled and looked down at Button, petting him slowly. “Tell me why you’re here.”
“Yes,” Cas rumbles, hands clenching. “Come for me.”
It was clear to Dean that Cas knew how to fight, and not just in a general dodge-and-throw-punch kind of way. Either he had been in a lot of fights, which Dean didn’t hope was the case, or he was into boxing or something like that. Maybe MMA? He could have the body for it, to be honest. He looked lean and slim, but in a fit way, although it had honestly been a little difficult to tell with his clothes in the way.
“Yes,” Charlie grins, eyeing Dean and making him sweat a little nervously.
, loves him, a mere human with all his flaws, is too big to process and yet it’s all he wants.
“Sorry,” he steps to the side but Michael doesn’t move so they end up standing there. “Did you need to use it?”
“Guess who’s back for another flight?”
“I guess I got a little discouraged when Sam came in again and again, but you seemed to keep your distance.”
He yelps when Cas all but crashes into him. He falls flat on the bed, but Cas is quickly up on his knees, strong hands pulling Dean up into a presenting position again.
Dean hauled the dead deer up, tossing it over Cas’ shoulders and fucking hell, he was lucky that Cas had come because that deer was heavier than it looked.
“Holy crap,” Cas suddenly laughed, hand on Dean’s neck keeping him in place as Cas squirmed under him, hole clenching enticingly. “Holy
Dean trembled, not because of nervousness but because of that pleasant buzzing. He could both feel it and see it when he reached out with one hand, fingers brushing the underside of Cas’ chin.
“You don’t have to do anything different, just be with me.”
“Of life,” Cas sighed and hugged himself, looking out over the river again. The sun was high in the air, shining down on them and making the river glisten. “I’ve always been this way,” he started after a moment, his tone sober. “At first, my father thought it a passing fancy, I was young and exploring the world after all. But when it became apparent that I could never bed a woman, could never be the son he needed me to be, he gave me an ultimatum,” Cas looked back at Dean and smiled sadly. “Either I did my duty to the family anyway or he would disown me, so I decided to leave on my own terms. I stole away in the night, like a coward.”
Castiel thought that over for a second before shuddering. “There must be all kinds of half-breeds lumbering around in the depths of Hell.”
“Yeah but…” Dean’s face wasn’t heating up, but it was a close call. “Fur.”
, of course I’m safe.”
“Thank you for showing me,” he said, voice calmer, stepping up to Cas and putting his hand on the angel’s snout. “It’s a piece of your world that I’d never be able to see by myself.”
Dean cried out when Castiel nipped at his nipple, licking with the flat of his tongue to soothe the sting. A burst of Dean’s succubus scent exploded in the room and Castiel let out a low growl, his orgasm stalling only because he couldn’t fathom coming before he had satisfied Dean’s whole body.
“Why are you selling then?” Crowley asked after he’d joined them by the river to look for himself, his clothes too fine to fit in out here. “You could still make a living, if you’re lucky.”
“Don’t you like it?” he changes position, knees coming up to support him as he curls his fingers around Dean’s sharp hipbones.
Now they were sitting shoulder to shoulder on Cas’ couch, Cas smoking another cigarette and Dean munching on a pie Cas had apparently bought for him. It was the kind of frozen pie you’d get at a grocery store and it was still a bit hard in the middle since Cas’ microwave apparently heated unevenly. And it was the best pie Dean had ever had.
he thought morosely as he used his towel to dry off as best he could.
“No I want to,” Cas looks thoughtful, his scent delicious when it mixes contemplation with arousal like this, as if he’s trying to solve a sexy riddle. “What I remember of the few ruts I had before going on repressants is that they were very…
“Daughter?” Dean barely cared, too caught up in humping Gary’s sizable erection.
It was a light gray color and Dean liked how the material felt against his skin, even if it was awfully hot. Cas was helping him roll up the sleeves so they wouldn’t hang over his hands and Dean squirmed on the spot, trying to see himself from behind. The shirt was so long it hung over his groin and pooled against his tail. He decided he liked it.
That wakes up Castiel’s inner Alpha, making him frown and speak before he can think. “With all due respect, John, I don’t think Dean needs calming down.”
“Yeah you do,” Dean murmurs, caressing Castiel’s cheek. “Because you’re my good boy and you deserve a reward after all the shit I put you through.”
Cas rubs his hard cock against Dean and fuck yeah, Dean gets it. “Don’t worry,” he murmurs, stealing a quick kiss before pulling away as much as he needs to start undressing Cas as well. He’s down to his jeans himself, excitement thrumming through him. “We can mate later; we have the whole weekend. Let’s take care of you first.”
“I thought you just said that to piss off Michael?”
“Oh that one,” the man said, coming to stand on the other side of Dean. “It’s a mixed breed, a little shunned by the others. It’s half off if you decide to buy it. In fact,” he walked over to a corner in the room, pulling out a small cage. “I’ll throw in an indoor cage just to get rid of it.”
“I, um,” he cleared his throat when his two closest friends looked attentively at him. “I wasn’t alone.”
Cas looks at him with a sad expression. “I know, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said anything, I should have let you go without—”
No, that wouldn’t be good. Dean didn’t know why but the sense of dread told him no.
Crowley had brought in a guy that honestly gave Dean the creeps but he’d allowed the man onto their claim for inspection. And fucking hell, he’d taken his goddamn time, probably nicked more than a few flecks of gold too, but ultimately deemed the claim active and worth Crowley’s time.
“Dean,” Cas rumbles, his inner Alpha clearly coming to the surface and holy fucking shit,
“Bones is hungry,” Dean announced when both Balthazar and Castiel looked at him and he took a few steps inside in his excitement before he stopped short and backtracked to the patio door where Castiel kept a towel for him to clean off his hooves.
Dean nods but bends in to kiss Cas first and that ends up with them making out for a moment, neither willing to part. Dean keens beautifully when Cas sucks on his bottom lip and the pleasure burns through Cas so hot and fast that it leaves him reeling.
Dean turned to look at him, eyes wide, feeling a little frantic. “What?”
Dean accepted the garment, pulling in on his head only after inspecting it for a moment and remembering how humans usually wore similar things. It was tight, and
“Any guy who can render
“What’s happening?”
Cas smiled unexpectedly and leaned forward to put the ashtray on the coffee table, poking his cigarette stump into it instead of finishing it completely.
Dean had to look away, suddenly realizing exactly how much she meant to him and how weird it was to see anyone but himself or dad in the driver’s seat. Guess that settled that, Sammy was going to have to practice driving in mom’s Volvo and he’d just have to deal.
Dean had no clue, and he didn’t care to ask this angel, not when he was about to die and all.
“What did you do with that man?” he asked, deflecting both Cas’ question and his own feelings.
“I want that too.”
“For a while—shameful—cata-
They’re panting and pawing at each other, Cas’ hands on Dean’s ass and the boy’s hands in Cas’ hair, anchoring them together. Cas’ head spins with his arousal and it doesn’t take long before he abandons kissing Dean’s mouth in favor of brushing sweet kisses against the boy’s neck and thrumming pulse.
Well, Dean found that he might be in the same category as the last, but everything had its limit and Dean anyhow wanted to see where this was headed.
Dean wanted to drop to the ground, wanted to show the angel his soft belly and vulnerable neck, wanted—
“Daddy!” Lily exclaimed, running up to him but stopping short to twirl for him. “What do you think?”
The feeling of seeing Cas at their camp got warmer and more desired every time he left, and he started longing back to their camp so much that he on his latest trip home only stayed a day. When he got back, Cas was seemingly asleep, but his head perked up as soon as Dean stepped into the clearing, mouth open and tongue lolling, and Dean’s chest tightened at the sight.
“Good, that’s good,” Cas rubbed his hand over his face once more before bending down and picking up the shovel and his gloves where he’d dropped them earlier. He gave Dean one last look, seemingly uncertain of something, and then nodded to the house. “Then you get inside and start readying the kitchen, I’m just gonna put these back.”
be intentionally cruel to him just to make him leave,” Castiel snapped. “I love him too much to bear that.”
On his way to the bar he gets nervous again, about going to such a place and about meeting Dean’s friend. He wants to know more about Dean’s life, and this is a great step, small enough that he shouldn’t have any problems with it, but he still wishes Dean could have been there to walk beside him as he enters the bar.
(You’re so fucking pathetic, Deanmon. Cas could’ve been your slave by now)
to meet him,” Sam mumbled, eyes immediately betraying him with how quickly they shot to the forest again. “He’s dangerous, right?”
“I liked it too,” he mumbles against Cas’ lips when they break off for air. “But I shouldn’t have. I’m clean though, I promise.”
makes me feel like that, I just… he’s so adult. He’s got adult issues and-and I dunno…” he looked down again, thinking of Cas’ whole presence. “He smokes and doesn’t eat enough, and he’s depressed and fucking gorgeous and I just wanna be with him but I–I’m just me. I haven’t got anything that makes me… cool.”
. But, as it turned out, Bobby Singer’s land had been a piece of gold claim, and Dean and Sam had gotten a letter that told them they had two months to prove their claim or it would fall to the town of Boldcreek.
“Deal.”
Castiel felt a renewed wave of arousal just as the overhead light flashed around them. “Oh, I’m counting on it,” he smirked, thinking that for all its faults, the night couldn’t have turned out better in the end.
Dean stared at them for a moment, almost unable to comprehend what they were talking about.
“I would love to, Cassie,” Balthazar said with enthusiasm, his tone both happy and humbled, which made Castiel feel like he had made the right choice.
As Castiel stood there, listening to the silence, a gust of the surprisingly warm October wind caught some stray leaves, blowing them down the quiet street outside. Soon it wouldn’t be quiet anymore, instead filling with trick-or-treaters, kids accompanied by their parents and groups of older kids going unescorted. Every house on the street was decorated for Halloween, theirs no different, although perhaps less scary since Castiel had let the girls help him decorate.
Dean freezes but Cas doesn’t feel nervous anymore, he just smiles and steps up to the younger man, cupping his face. God, he’s beautiful.
*****
“I want to,” he rasped, throat tight not so much because of arousal as because of feelings but hell if he was admitting that. “I was just making sure you want me too. I won’t be able to stop if we continue, okay?”
Dean wants to snark about it, of course it’s hot, he literally
Father looks up at Castiel, eyes unreadable. “Don’t expect too much, son.”
He flexed his hand on Cas’ chin, but the grip was loosening as his arousal peaked. One last look revealed that Cas was watching him intently, mouth slightly open as he panted, and Dean felt his own breathing stutter to a stop as he shot forcefully inside Cas.
it as demons did. Sammy had always thought that was curious.
“Sure thing,” Gabriel called out after him, voice too high-pitched to be genuine cheerfulness. “We’ll join you soon.”
Dean beamed up at him when Cas looked down at the demon. His incisors were as sharp as ever but somehow, they weren’t the least frightening. Rather, they made his grin more precious and Castiel felt a lump in his throat.
He leans against the sink in the kitchen, head hanging as the coffee maker goes through its usual cycle.
“To dress in something that you wouldn’t normally wear?”
“He only means to say I’m taller than him even though I’m younger,” Castiel said dismissively and stepped up to take Dean’s right hand, connecting it with Gabriel’s. “Now shake and introduce yourself.”
Sam shuts that down quickly enough and Dean has to settle for the machete, of course, because it’s true and tried and he shouldn’t step outside the lines.
Cas’ smile was fucking blinding in its beauty. “Have we been a couple of dumbasses?”
“No,” Cas chuckled, shaking his head slightly. “But I guess you’ll be paying in sweat and tears, having to hang out with my family and their friends all night.”
Cas had told Dean that he was free to come and go as he wished, though he had warned Dean about getting too close to other humans. All humans were well-aware of mythological creatures and cryptids — or theological creatures, which was what Cas had told Dean he was — and most humans had either had encounters or personally knew such creatures themselves, Cas had told Dean. But, and this apparently concerned the man, most if not all humans were either wary of or outright scared of demons and devils and would have no qualms attacking Dean if they felt threatened and Cas told Dean he didn’t want him to get hurt. Dean was all too familiar with what humans could do to him if they wanted to and didn’t need to be told twice to be careful, though he didn’t tell Cas that or he suspected the man would never let him out of his sight.
Dean’s head whips up and he has to force himself to remain cool. “House sitting,” he states but dad obviously misinterprets his tone and lack of scent as a question.
Andrea was shaking her head when he turned to her. “What?”
Dean turns to see that Jo didn’t close the curtain all the way when she left and that that handsome man is staring straight at them. And fucking hell, their eyes totally meet and the man doesn’t even look away. Instead he shamelessly drags his eyes up and down of what he can see of Dean’s body, head turned and completely unapologetic about clearly checking Dean out. In a way what he’s doing would be just as douchey as Dean immediately hitting on Charlie because the man is so obvious in his thirst that it should feel creepy.
His little brother, Sam, was probably going to join the builders, which Dean thought was a fine thing. Their dad, John Winchester, had grumbled some about that but no one could deny the need for builders who could make constant repairs and build new buildings and ships for them. Well, no one except for perhaps the fishermen who thought they were a little better than everyone else. As if going out on a boat was more dangerous than venturing
Yeah she wasn’t fooled by his flimsy lie alright and Dean couldn’t help but smile with gratitude that she didn’t push for more. She pecked him on his cheek when he nodded and let him go with a pat to the side of his head.
He’s been over what happened a thousand times in his mind and he could go over it a thousand times more and he would still come to the same conclusion. Namely that what he had done (aside from the sexual stuff) had been right, and that it still felt like the worst thing he has ever done.
Pleasant thoughts like that swished around his mind when he heard the none-too subtle landing Cas afforded him and he turned around with a grin.
But Cas came closer, Dean could both hear him and sense him.
Cas didn’t say anything more and when he later came down, smelling amazing and wearing the shirt Dean liked the best, he smiled when he saw the sandwiches Dean had made for him.
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel mumbled, thinking that the demon hadn’t truly understood what he meant by his words.
Dean dragged a hand down his tired face. “Not a person,” he muttered, glancing in the direction Cas had disappeared a moment ago, most likely because nature called since he’d already hunted for the day.
Castiel smiled at the playful insult. “And yet you came with me.”
His eyes shoot to the desk where he keeps his laptop. “Um…”
Dean felt like a fucking Disney Princess. “Thank you,” he mumbled. “I’m, um, not against it or anything. I’m just not used to it.”
contemplated if he was hungry or not. Head bowed, eyes squinting in thought, tail thumping lightly, he was sitting on his rump like an animal, wings spread out behind him. He was an
“Okay,” he said, trying to sound cheerful but most probably just sounded squeaky. “I’ll see you in a bit.”
Dean, for his part, had never felt so confident before. With Cas by his side he felt as if he could conquer the world and he sailed through his first months at KU. And it got even better after he’d worked up the courage to ask Cas if he could move in with him.
This time, Cas didn’t get up and stood beside Dean, shaking his giant body to send water drops flying. This time, he emerged slowly from the water, Dean’s eyes snapping open when he felt water dripping down on his feet before anything else.
In any case, he’d been itching to meet Cas again, talk to him, just fucking look at him, but Charlie had told him no one wrote their possible squeeze immediately the day after. And Dean, having had no real experience with
confused but also thinks he might get it.
“All I’m saying,” the man muttered, blowing smoke away from them. “Is that maybe you’re going about this the wrong way.”
“Yeah, Cas,” Dean moans shakily. “Fucking eat me out, wanna feel you everywhere.”
“Ah…”
“With no one to teach him…” he began, slowly. Those succubus powers, most likely enhanced by his human heritage, all bottled up inside him and no one willing to show him how to harness them, it could mean nothing good for Dean.
Cas grinned widely at him, so much so that little crow’s feet appeared around his eyes and Dean loved them something fierce.
Some parts in this chapter is a shoutout to ILoveFANfic, and I'll hope you'll know which! (otherwise I'm gonna look reeeeaaaally uncool, which we both know I'm not, so)
Another pause, this one shorter. “So is he coming here, or…?”
He went “oh yeah look at my guns when I hold you like this”, and Dean grunted something positive without really meaning it because he was too occupied with prepping himself. For all his massiveness, Tom’s dick was pretty average, but Dean didn’t care much about size. He’d always been more of a technique whore and believed any dick was a good dick, as long as it got hard and went inside him.
“I propose a game, something to encourage you to be honest with me about your desires.” Dean says, his voice still in that deliciously low octave. “I will spank you, with varying force,” he gives Castiel’s ass a slap and Castiel hisses at the pleasure. “And with every slap you will tell me something you’d like to do in bed.”
time,” he glares a little at Dean, bending to get his bookbag.
Cas has been friends with Meg and Charlie since he entered college and met the girls. They’re in many ways polar opposites and in other ways very similar and Cas, who generally has trouble connecting with people, had a comfortingly pleasant experience befriending them and now he wouldn’t trade them for the world.
Didn’t mean he didn’t miss her like a lost limb, though, and especially on grocery hauls. Dean usually shopped once a week at Walmart, stocking up on most household items and food. It was an economical way of spending money, and he was proud of himself for keeping his costs down enough that he could afford a little treat once in a while, like going to Hawkeye’s, even if they were far and few between since Dean was very frugal with his money.
Their movements slowed to a halt and they sat for a moment, entangled and panting. The air was thick with the scent of sex, hot enough to be hard to breathe and yet Castiel couldn’t resist pulling in big lungfuls of it, relishing it.
All he knows is that it sounds as if Cas would like more than a hasty blow-job when they have the time for it and Dean’s so fucking down with that.
“Cas said…”
“Come on,” he took Dean’s hand and though Dean loved how much they’d held hands this evening he was also dying to know why. Was it a comfort for Cas? Was it just for show? What was Dean to Cas tonight? He introduced Dean as his plus one but what did that mean? You could take your friends as your plus one, right? “Let’s go find our seats.”
But this guy wanted Castiel to come inside him and Castiel would be damned if he didn’t deliver. Brushing his dick he thought he might have overdone it, though, because shit, it felt as if he was about two seconds from blowing already.
“Then you might have just condemned yourself and everyone you love,” she stated dryly, her words forming a lump of fear in Castiel’s throat. “There is no saying how powerful he is, or what he is capable of doing. If the demon gains control—”
Dean’s mind immediately flooded with images of his dick disappearing behind Cas’ sharp teeth, the angel’s tongue curling around him. He swallowed hard.
“Fight?” Cas sighed when Dean nodded. “There are different kinds of angels, believe it or not. Some enjoy solitude. To observe the world and everyone in it. Some like to engage, to live among humans or animals, to learn and love.” His expression darkened. “And some like destruction.”
he was interested in Dean even without the pheromones. Perhaps even in spite of them. And Dean chose to trust Cas’ words and simply take them at face value.
it almost made him cry.
“If we’re really doing this, selling the claim and going back Boston, we’d still do good to maybe take on a bounty or two on the way there.”
right.
“I know he is, it’s gonna be great.”
“Whatever,” Dean mumbles but it’s clear that the answer to Castiel’s question is yes. Dean’s mixture of shyness and confidence is very endearing to Castiel and he smiles as he watches Dean stretch out on the bed. “Just lemme get a peek at what you’re packing. I need to know what’s going inside me.”
To distract himself from his meltdown, he goes to kneel in front of Dean, pulling the man’s jean’s down as he goes. Dean wobbles and puts his hands on Cas’ head when he leans in to nuzzle Dean’s hard dick. The tip is already wet, making the fabric of his underwear stick to it and Cas sucks gently on it for a moment, delighting in the sounds Dean make.
“I dunno if I’m ready for the date to be over,” he steps in and somehow manages to look at Castiel from under his lashes, even though Dean is in actuality roughly the same height as Castiel. “Y’know?”
But he hadn’t, not really.
Dean bristled, knowing full well what Crowley was alluding to. And what the fuck did he think he knew anyway? Knew nothing about Dean, unless Cas had gone crying to his favorite dickhead. Dean gritted his teeth.
“Yes?” he said but it sounded like a question. “Since you’re half succubus.”
(Do it)
shower.”
Dean fuck him, harder, faster,
“I do know that,” he says when he’s managed to collect himself. “I know it very well.”
“Guilty as charged,” Benny grinned, making Dean and Cas smile.
The look took Dean by surprise and he snarled, snagging a hand in Cas’ thick hair. It was short, much shorter than Dean was used to in his partners, but still longer than Dean’s and it was easy to grab a handful. He used the grip to hold Cas’ face still as he grinded up against the man’s cheek. A rush of power went through him when Cas went lax in his grip and he smirked down at the man, enjoying the dazed look on his face. Yeah, that showed his impudent fucking ass.
“Well then, I think we are done here for today. Gordon, please keep up your good behavior, I’m very proud of you. You may leave.”
Dean was sweating and cursing under his breath, Cas moaning and breathing raggedly. As if he liked it, as if he wanted more. An insane amount of arousal blinded Dean and he bent down over Cas again, getting a hand under the man’s head and grabbing Cas’ chin so that he could force Cas to turn his head and look over his shoulder.
Another week later the summer was at its peak and Dean and Sam were set to get off the claim and away from Boldcreek.
Dean grins to himself, playing with Castiel’s fingers and oh God…
“So beautiful,” he rasps, kissing Dean’s mouth and cheek. “Absolutely stunning.”
“Yeah, I…” Dean didn’t know how to word himself. Images of Cas came to mind and he wondered why it was so hard to talk about the angel and if that meant that he shouldn’t. “I found something in the forest.”
Tall, broad-shouldered, just the right bow to his legs. Yes, this “Dean” was definitely Castiel’s type in the body department. His face was just icing on the cake. Thank God for good-looking johns or this job would be terrible. Castiel was just hoping that the guy wasn’t an asshole but judging by the shy smile he returned when Castiel grinned at him he had hit jackpot in that department too.
Dean twisted his body to touch his hole gingerly, wincing as he did so. Castiel frowned and was just about to ask about it when Dean looked at him with a new grin.
“First and most special,” he answered with a grin of his own. “What do you say we drive to the grocery store and buy something nice to eat tonight?” to celebrate, was on the tip of his tongue but that felt silly. Well, perhaps not so silly when he thought about what he (they) had just accomplished here, but he was loath so say it out loud.
“It’s nothing,” Cas says, waving it off because truly; it’s only his job and he takes great satisfaction in seeing his students safe and sound.
The simple truth was that he most probably would have chosen Cas, too in love to force the angel to be something he was not or to leave him. But he was honestly happy it hadn’t come to that.
“How convenient,” Cas grinned and went to open the door to the backseat. “Like a proper boy scout.”
Castiel feels new shame burn through him. “Well I do. With an Omega,” he swallows and feels a rush of pride when he remembers Dean. “He’s called Dean and he’s stunning.”
Dean cracks a smile at that, looking unfairly handsome. “It was kinda shitty of me,” he admits. “Even if I meant well. I mean, I know you’re much stronger than I gave you credit for.”
“Gonna blow so soon, princess,” he groaned. “Best fucking cunt I’ve ever had.”
weird, and Castiel wanted to reflect on it. Well, not weird per say, but different and Castiel did want to talk about it.
“Dean, your shirt…”
“Yeah!” Dean stated, feeling happier than he thought he ever would be.
He holds the man's eyes for a moment, satisfied when he sees him noticing. The shift on the man’s face is incremental but Dean loves it all the same — fuck yeah, this guy likes getting caught staring alright — and then he grabs the curtain, closing it properly.
“Yeah, but I can take it.”
(You’re gonna get it now, Deanmon!)
Because she was clearly interesting in all the obvious ways, hell she was a tiny human-looking creature with wings, who glowed a warm yellow from some internal light. But Gabriel and Kali’s interactions, and her ultimately choosing to live with him rather than her own kind, proved to Castiel what he’d already suspected (and written several theses on), namely that humans and mythological creatures (and cryptids) could not only co-exist but also befriend each other.
They watched him trot away into the tree line and suddenly the silence at the claim felt overbearing. Well, not silence as such since there were a lot of natural sounds, but the knowledge that he and Cas were alone made Dean on edge and he stalked away from the man, intent on creating some distance to clear his head but of course Cas followed him, why wouldn’t he? Dean had after all invited him. Like a fool.
Okay, that last question was just ridiculous. He didn’t have
The first smack comes as a surprise to Castiel, even though he watches with greedy eyes how Dylan lifts his hand. It’s hard, by the sound of it, and it makes the other man jerk and moan, fisting the bed sheets. Dylan croons and continues mercilessly for a while, the other man’s cheeks getting redder and redder. Castiel starts sweating, his dick fully hard in his grip, a small wet spot forming on his underwear that he will fret about later.
“Fine?” Gabriel snorts and licks loudly at his lollipop until Castiel looks up to meet his eyes. “Come on, you’ve been making heart-eyes at that Omega of yours this whole week. Worse than normal I mean.”
Castiel, though fuller than he’s ever been in his life, perks up at the mention of a dessert.
“You’re more than enough Alpha for me,” he says, voice thick with arousal, dark in a way that has Castiel crumbling to pieces. All he wants is to fall to his knees and pleasure the Omega with his mouth. “In fact, you’re perfect for me,” he starts undressing Castiel again. Slacks and undershirt joining his shirt on the floor. “I love having sex with Alphas the most, but they find me too demanding. With a Beta I get to be in charge but with an Alpha I get the knot. But with
Dean was frankly getting tired of Sammy and his “helpful” suggestions. Because somehow Dean just knew that Sammy didn’t mean the warm water that was now cascading down on them, but instead scorching hot water that would hurt Cas. Dean didn’t want to hurt Cas, he wanted to touch him. Softly, and maybe sometimes a little rougher, but not too rough. Just the right amount of pressure, kneading his muscles and…
But then Cas was seated to the hilt and he
“I know what it is,” Castiel smiles. A thought occurs to him. “When you sleep with people, are you a top or bottom,” he looks at Dean, the other man regarding him thoughtfully. “In the sense of penetration.”
“Damn. Is there a chance you wanna exchange numbers in case you come back?”
“And then when we get back to the States we’ll see,” Dean licks his lips, and grabs a steady hold of the man’s hard dick, pumping once. “I live in Houston, I’ve never done something like this before, and I don’t give away my phone number frivolously. You make what you will of that.”
“That was fast.”
“Want you to fuck my face,” he continued in that same rasp. Dean felt Cas’ dick jumping and he grabbed Cas’ ass hard so that they had more leverage to grind. “Want you to take my head in your hands and hold me still as you use me,” his whole body shuddered and he closed his eyes, but Dean couldn’t look away, completely mesmerized. “Fuck that would be so good, to—shit—to feel your control like… like—ah, shit,” his body shuddered again, hips twitching hard and holy fucking hell, was he…? “
Knocking on Andrea’s door got him a testy “I don’t wanna talk to you” that he readily ignored. When he poked his head inside, he saw that Andrea, like her sister, had retreated to the bed. Thankfully, Andrea wasn’t crying.
“Really?”
Yeah, Dean knew precisely what he was saying and what he wanted to happen and to his delight his words had the exact desired effect.
“I’m in love with you, Dean,” he said, voice stronger and surer. “I want to spend my life with you.”
Dean threw Castiel a glance over his shoulder, obviously trying to look as if he needed to be saved, as if Castiel would believe that. He knew Dean loved to play with their pups, so he just shook his head, smiling.
Hi y'all!
sounds that Dean wanted to remember forever, and his dick jumped so hard that Dean easily felt it against his own. A warm wetness spread between them a moment later and Dean grinned to himself, one hand in Castiel’s sweat-damp hair and the other gripping the chair so hard his knuckles were white. His own dick throbbed needily but he ignored that for now, too sated from what he had accomplished.
“Do you think you could come for me again?” he asked, feeling a thrill when Dean nodded. “Good boy.”
“Is yours the same color?” he asked the moment before he spotted another tie in a deeper purple.
Tune in next week when I start one of the two fics I auctioned out through the FicFacer$ auction this year! For those of you who are curious, it’s a timestamp to an old fic of mine, one with an innocent human Cas and a very sneaky hunter Dean who impersonated a priest 👀
“I suppose,” the demon said at length. “If you think it’s too cold? For you.”
“I did,” Dean said, trying his hardest to keep his voice level and his speech clear. “I will.”
But Dean is here, Dean wants this, Dean initiated this.
“Fuck
He truly thinks it is, and he doesn’t really want to leave work, enjoying his time here, but of course he misses Dean terribly. Remembering the sweet kiss Dean gave him before he left lifts his spirits enough, though.
“Of course not, it hasn’t even been half an hour,” he smiles, eyes glinting wickedly. “You sound sexy when you wake up.”
Castiel checked himself before asking who. Just looking at Gabriel’s sparkling eyes it was clear to Castiel who he was talking about.
His toes curl in his shoes and chills travel down his spine, making his nipples perk up to the point where he kind of has to pinch them or they start to hurt. Fucking
“What’s this?” he hissed out through a grin, ever word clipped as he fucked the man in measured strokes. “Is my little sweetie gonna come too? Just from having my cock inside you?”
Except it’s not, not when sex is such an unexplored jungle and Castiel is still nervous enough that he can barely stand to look at the thumbnails of the various videos on the porn site.
know how big Cas is?”
*****
Pleasure unlike any sexual satisfaction Castiel has ever felt before curls in his stomach and he rises on his knees only to bend down and kiss Dean thoroughly before settling back down and pushing three fingers inside. That’s a stretch, really, and Dean hisses in discomfort but doesn’t make Castiel stop. He does anyway, somewhat, because he wants to give Dean time to adjust.
“Someone’s eager,” Dean mumbles, affectionately, and reaches between Castiel’s legs to adjust his dick.
Cas’ text was as short and concise as usual when he wanted to have sex. After they’d started texting a little outside of hooking up, their texting had changed a little, Cas opening up. But when he wanted sex, Cas still just sent the customary “now?” and Dean kind of liked it.
“We’re leaving, me ‘n Sammy, leaving Boldcreek,” Dean said then, cutting off Cas’ words with a sense of urgency. “T’morrow or the day after, depending.”
Cas seemed to contemplate the answer. Perhaps he was counting them, Dean thought. “I’ve met enough to know that you’re my favorite by far.”
(Reel. It. In. Deanmon)
He bared his teeth as a wave of pleasure rolled over him and he pressed the heel of his hand harder against his sheath. His little dick was responding, growing, and he spread his legs slightly, putting two of his fingers in his mouth to suck on as he watched the actor with greedy eyes. He was handsome and Dean wanted him to be here and touch him.
“You know what?” he stood up, shaking off his hands. “Fuck this shit, let’s take a bath.”
And he does, fucking hell he loves Cas’ hipster glasses, his unruly hair, the fact that he wore a bowtie to impress dad and that he actually uses his breast pockets to have pens in. He loves Cas’ scent and voice and mind, and he loves how the Alpha so willingly does anything he can to please Dean.
“Loud as always,” he said with a smile, leaning against the bar.
“I think we’ll call it for today,” Castiel said, pulling off his gardening gloves.
“I’m fecking fantastic, Cas.”
And kiss him, but Dean hadn’t been about to say
The town of Boldcreek wasn’t much, as towns go. In all fairness, it had been a camp until a few years ago, nestled deep within the Dakota Territory woods, on the borders of Indian territories and haunted by the nearby river after which the town took its name.
They ended up staring at each other, the man not backing down, and Dean’s hackles rose with the man’s mounting amusement at Dean’s hesitation. Who the fuck did this man with his stupid, plump fucking lips think he was anyway? Awfully high and mighty for a fucking
Dean slaps him again and Castiel grinds against Dean’s thigh, his dick weeping into Dean’s shirt now.
“You didn’t want to come in my mouth, huh?” Cas mumbled, adding something in Russian that Dean didn’t understand but that made his skin prickle. “Was it good enough that you forgot about the rubber, little bird?”
*****
“It’s nice to meet you.”
That made her hum thoughtfully. “I suppose it’s possible that someone else with a similar name came in to pay for their books and there was a mistake made. I can see that it was Patience that handled it, I’ll call her and ask.”
“Hey!” he exclaims, making the man turn.
Jo’s out of breath and nearly runs into the side of Dean’s car.
He helped Cas undress and quickly got out of his own clothes while Cas brushed his teeth.
“Me? I barely got sweaty.”
Castiel gave him a grin and went to the bedside drawer to pull out a cloth, wiping off the worst from his face.
Arousal spikes through Cas’ body and he jerks his hips up without meaning to. Just the sight of his beautiful lover enjoying himself makes Cas feel so accomplished he could release and be done with it. His needs are secondary to Dean’s and he gets so caught up in watching Dean’s face he barely notices that they’ve both leaked enough to make Dean’s fingers sticky and their slide smoother.
“I do,” Cas stated then, giving Dean a grin that put his mind to ease. “I just like watching you undress. Your eagerness is intoxicating.”
“You’re kind to indulge me,” Cas chuckled and patted the back of Dean’s head. “Now I need a shower and some coffee, do you want to try and make some for me?”
“I’d like to see you try to stop me,” Dean snorted but he let go of the valet, who only gave him a new grin and slid effortlessly into baby’s seat.
holding the angel’s stomach together. “
“Why not?” Cas seems to study Dean’s dick and God, Dean’s gonna come as soon as Cas puts him in his mouth, isn’t he?
She wasn’t there before, what the hell? And it’s even the old license plate and everything, from way before when it all started, from when he…
He froze when he felt Cas’ hot breath puff against his ear. The angel’s snout was so close Dean could feel the heat and wetness of Cas’ nose, could smell the absolutely horrid smell of the rotting flesh and blood that still covered Cas’ mouth.
That makes Dean laugh, a wonderful sound. “Might wanna leave out why, though.”
“Shit,” Dean grunts as he shucks down his underwear to grab his dick.
He felt his body tingle as he pulled on the shirt, slid it slowly up his arms and over his shoulders but he didn’t button it. Instead, he moved over to the mirror, squirming in front of it.
Cas looked indecisive. “Good question. Judging by your hooves I would say satyr but judging by your size I’d say faun.”
Because God forbid Dean could just outright speak his emotions, right? This boy smh...
“Take us to my apartment,” he said in a low tone so Dean wouldn’t hear. “Though I wouldn’t mind if you took the scenic route.”
“Satisfied?” he asks after a moment, tugging up his boxers and forcing his dick inside again.
Thank you for reading!
That made his brother snort, but he was afforded a smile as well so Dean left it at that, mind anyway too focused on how he would face Cas.
Actually this had been on Dean’s mind the whole day they’d spent together and eventually he’d just figured that straightforward seemed like the best solution and Cas seemed to favor that approach himself anyway.
“The advice that I take my ex-wife? Yes, I felt that wouldn’t go over well with her considering how we left off.”
“Yeah, sorry about that,” he muttered and looked around for those goddamn paper towels again. “You startled me…”
Dean moaned a little under his breath, suddenly feeling desperate in a way he hadn’t for a long time. “Say you’ll take care of my body and that I can spend the night and sleep in your arms. And say that you’ll make me pancakes in the morning again.”
“By what? Do you think I just see you as a father figure or something?” Dean straightens, looking down at Cas with dark eyes. “I don’t. I don’t need that, I have a fucking awesome dad. I want
Above him, Dean throws his head back and sinks further down against Castiel’s face. The Omega’s round balls come to rest against Castiel’s chin and the muscles in Dean’s thighs flex under Castiel’s strong grip. All of it serves to push Castiel’s arousal to new heights but nothing as much as the taste of Dean’s slick as it spills directly from the source.
“So hard for me, Alpha,” he moans and presses his foot harder against Cas’ cock. “That all for me, big boy?”
“It’s fine, Dean,” the smile was obviously forced, and it made Dean feel even worse.
Dean supposed that was as good as it was going to get. He slathered his cock with oil, got too much on his hand and decided to smear the rest against Cas’ heat. Not inside because that was—but around, massaging so much that Cas let out a breathless little sound that Dean coveted more of.
Cas squints for a moment but then smiles and backs away, opening his door. Hair tousled, cock tenting his pants, all cross-eyed, Cas stumbles out of the car and into the backseat, looking happy to have arrived. Fuck Dean really loves this dork of an Alpha.
Cas doesn’t seem fazed at all at the prospect of Jo and Charlie knowing about this. He’s reverently touching Dean’s butt, brushing his hand over the panties as if they’re made of glass.
“You know my name, but I don’t even know yours,” Dean murmured, eyes on Castiel’s lips. “I’m kinda stupid for even getting in this thing with you, huh?”
The punched out yell Dean lets slip tells Castiel that this was the perfect angle for his prostate. His pleasure burns down his spine, making his hips feel like jelly and still he persists with his slow rolling, watching with mounting arousal as Dean grows frantic.
He took his dick in hand, stroking himself as Cas watched, whole giant body betraying surprise.
“Sounds like a blast,” Dean squeaked, completely entranced with Cas’ twinkling eyes.
“Cas—” he started, his voice lower, an edge to it that he barely recognized himself, but he was interrupted by Cas putting a hand on his shoulder.
“Would you go with me?”
Too bold, that’d been too bold, he thought until Cas grabbed his chin and leaned in to kiss Dean deeply.
Dean bristled. “
Dean wished Cas wouldn’t do that, didn’t know what
“Well in that regard we could be just as concerned about him taking advantage of you because of his succubusness.”
While the words feel like a knife to his gut it’s Dean’s crushed expression that nearly makes Cas’ determination crumble.
Castiel couldn’t help but smile a little as he led the way to his front porch. “Actually, I own it.”
Dean moaned loudly, his fingernails scraping against Castiel’s scalp where he gripped Castiel’s hair hard. Castiel’s own dick throbbed in his loose sweatpants and he breathed out evenly through his nose as he let Dean slide out and then almost immediately back in again.
“Your dad’s dead?” Dean almost choked up, thinking about his own dad.
Cas snorted water at Dean when he swam past, nose barely over the waterline and eyes mostly closed. He looked serene and happy and Dean shoved any strange thoughts to the back of his mind, focused instead on enjoying this uncomplicated time with his friend.
, had fallen out of the skies and taken with it all the sound in the world.
“Mom,” Dean honestly didn’t know which question to start with, but his mind made itself up without his permission. “If you and dad split up, who would get the house?”
“Hey,” he said, voice low and eyes hooded.
“The only doctor in town treated my wounds but he made it abundantly clear he only did that because of his hippocratic oath and that he wanted me gone as soon as I was able to ride,” Cas turned away from Dean, hugged himself once again, his gaze faraway. “The second town I came to I didn’t even dare ask. I went to the token whorehouse and sat and listened for a while and then I told my own story, as if it was a funny anecdote that I’d seen happen to someone else. Their responses made it clear to me that that wasn’t the town for me either. I didn’t get lucky with Boldcreek until almost two years after I’d left my childhood home.”
They undressed together, eyes wandering the other’s body as more and more skin was revealed. Cas finished first only because he had less articles to remove but Dean wasn’t far behind when Cas waded out into the river.
So never, Dean thought with a wane smile. “Let’s just see how this charity event thing goes first.”
“Maybe he just wanted to fuck around?” he tried instead, voice surprisingly level. “And I fucked it up because I told him I liked him?”
Cas’ eyes immediately darkened. Oh Dean loved this, loved how fast Cas reacted to him. He had been a fool to be insecure about their differences in anatomy, of course Cas was attracted to him, his cock was way too honest to lie about something like this.
“Is that right?” Cas said, squinting in annoyance. “Well in that case, how about you utilize him again, if he’s so gratifying?”
“Yeah, sure,” Castiel had put his hands on Dean’s flanks and prompted the demon to roll on top on him. “We can’t go inside the house or the yard, but we can drive past and look at it, and come to think of it,” he’d brushed his hands down the demon’s back when Dean sat up, straddling Castiel’s lap. “There’s a place in the forest not far from the house that I want to show you.”
A surge of affection went through Castiel. “I’m more than okay with that.”
“That’s good,” he grunted, spreading his legs to allow Cas in-between, his torso big enough to make Dean aware that this was undoubtedly a man. “Fuck you really want it, don’t you?”
Cas stepped closer, a smile still playing at his lips as he fingered Dean’s t-shirt. Dean’s heart felt like it was about to hammer out of his chest and his dick was taking
“Cas?” he whispered loudly, clinging to Cas’ arm. “Cas, where are we?”
“I haven’t prepared food,” Cas blurts out and immediately smacks a hand over his eyes. He wants to die, seriously. Grown, fucking 40-year-old man, behaving like a little girl with a middle school crush. Dean is the more mature one for sure…
“Gross.”
(He thinks you’re weak. He wants to turn you into a human)
“He made it sound as if you weren’t living alone, if that’s what you mean?”
Which was why he without remorse left his little brother at the camp and once again steered his steed to Boldcreek.
Cas stirred when Dean put his lips around him but still wasn’t waking up and Dean felt smug about that. He put his hands on Cas’ hips and pulled himself up a little, taking Cas all the way down to the base and letting his tongue work the cock over in his mouth. His own sheath and balls were itching, pleasure coiling leisurely around them and his tail flicked, body hot as Cas’ cock slowly filled out.
This is truly the peak of the rut and though Dean loves every single moment he’s also aware that Cas isn’t, well,
“Dean,” he steeples his fingers, trying to sound calm but he’s honestly upset. Dean looks like a used punching bag. “
Charlie shakes her head with a smirk. “Bat for your team?”
Dean’s bluntness makes Cas laugh and he looks down to see Dean grinning proudly up at him. “Come on, let’s flip over the pillow.”
“Yeah, at Bela Talbot’s house?” he says it almost as if it’s a question and Cas is about to call him out on it before he realizes that Dean is asking if he knows who Bela Talbot is.
“I think…” he squeezes Dean’s arms once, almost unconsciously. “I think the answer to that should be clear by now.”
With the money from the house Cas managed to pay off his existing mortgage and still had money left to buy mostly new furniture. Most notably a new bed, which Dean helped pick out. With memory foam and sturdy bed posts.
Dean places his sinful mouth against Cas’ neck and nibbles lightly there. “You haven’t even tried the food,” he chuckles, the sound dark and full of promises.
just hanging out,” the man rumbled and grabbed Dean’s short hair, almost tearing it out by the roots as he pulled Dean’s head back and exposed his throat. Dean’s dick lurched in his jeans and fuck, Dean wanted to cry. This
*****
Come to think of it, Cas hadn’t smelled bad. Dean frowned at himself as he dismounted Creed, tying his horse outside the whorehouse. What the fuck did he care what Cas smelled like anyway? Nothing, except perhaps that the lack of odor was surprising.
There are less bruises this time, although one is blooming on Dean’s jaw and Cas is liberal in his use of Arnica, just like last time. Neosporin is not supposed to sting like Iodine, but Dean makes hissing noises anyway. Cas just tuts at him and finishes off the wound on the boy’s arm by wrapping it in some gauze he finds in his cabinet.
During the year Dean has definitely found himself sexually and Cas feels honored having had the privilege to witness the growth. And to have been part of the exploration Dean has done, and still goes through.
Dean stops, one hand on her shoulder to halt her too. “That’s mine.”
“We’ll have to lie about your age, though. Since you’re under 21 and there’ll be alcohol.”
Dean wanted to disagree. “No, I meant your sweetheart.”
Cas just gave Dean a smirk, licked his lips once with the pinkest fucking tongue Dean had ever seen, and bent down to take Dean’s cock in his mouth. Well, fuck. There was no last minute hesitation there, no sir. This wasn’t a fucking prank on the new guy in town, Cas had done this before, Dean was fucking sure of that now.
The day after, Castiel indeed had one hell of a hangover, the only saving grace being that Gabriel had stayed the night so he could cook them a good and greasy breakfast. And as Castiel sat at the dinner table, fighting nausea and random aches, he thought that this was probably the happiest he’d ever been.
when he felt Dean’s hands on his heated flesh for the first time. His dick practically lurched into Dean’s touch and Castiel made a probably embarrassing sound, thighs spreading as Dean pulled him out of his pants. He leaned his head back, sinking down on the couch as Dean jacked him a few times and then reached deeper inside to pull out Castiel’s already tight balls too.
The man stepped back half a step and pulled Dean with him, forcing him to present his ass like a bitch in heat and fucking hell it was so
And then suddenly Cas’ palm was against his, Creed danced on the spot as more weight was added to his broad back, and then they were trotting down the dusty road that ran clear through Boldcreek and into the woods beyond.
“Cas,” Dean said sweetly and bent in to kiss Cas’ lips quickly to shut him up. “I’ll be fine. I’m alone all the time and I’m always fine. Besides, I’ve got Button.”
“Cas,” Dean gasped when Castiel fingered his other nipple, sucking on the already abused one. “I’m gonna-gonna…”
*****
Another half hour later and Dean finally closed in on his prey, the group of four grazing lazily among the trees, close to a rocky outcrop. Dean slowed his pace, crept up to a tree and watched them for a while. They noticed him, or something, because they stopped to lift their heads for a moment. Dean pressed against the tree trunk, eyes trained on them, breathing shallow and heart calm. It took them no time at all to relax again and when they did, Dean nocked an arrow and took careful aim.
“Yeah, they’ve opened a hardware store,” Sam grinned, taking back the reins to lead his horse over to the improvised stable. Nothing more than a pole to tie their horses to but it might  grow, in time, if Sam got his way.
“Lean on me,” Cas rumbles, voice wrecked from his recent orgasm and Dean shivers as pleasure shots through him.
“Would you wanna switch?” Cas was sounding deliciously breathless now and Dean felt a high at being able to make the more experienced man sound like that.
“Yeah that was something else,” Dean chuckled and slumped to the side, making room for Castiel to sit down and he did so with an undignified
“Oh no,” Dean gasped, eyes wide as he watched Castiel move between his legs, one hand coming up to cup Dean’s delicate balls and dick.
Hawkeye’s bar was a casual sports bar about a 25 minute walk from where Dean was renting an apartment at Tailor Lofts in central Chicago, close to UIC where he attended the College of Electrical Engineering. It was exactly the kind of bar Dean enjoyed, the atmosphere exciting enough to his young senses, and though his mere 18 years wasn’t enough to allow him to drink anything but non-alcoholic root beer he was still welcomed inside to sit with the other men and women, watch the game, and relax.
And then he promptly stops thinking about anything rational because the man is right in front of him. On
“Would you like to take a shower with me?”
Dean looks mightily pleased. “Don’t get so cocky. I want you to prove it first.”
And now, without desperate arousal clouding his mind, Dean is free to appreciate looking and touching Cas and what a treat it is.
Cas grunted and rose, only to pad over to the little shelter Dean had built for himself. There he’d put a freshly killed deer and Dean grinned when the angel lifted it in one clawed hand, showcasing it to him. Over the weeks, as Cas’ strength grew, he’d started hunting for them while Dean focused more on his traps and foraging for herbs. He’d had to devise a method of conserving meat while out here in the forest and he’d built two drying racks where he could tend to deerskin, and lion skin that one time Cas killed another lion who thought Dean looked delicious. That hide had fetched a pretty penny at the market and Dean slept well remembering the way Lisa had smiled at him with adoration.
“Of course,” Balthazar laughed. “It’s your home and you cooked the dinner, you deserve it.”
“Yeah, and Hannah texted me that after they had dropped off Meg,
“Quiet down,” Castiel said, businesslike as he steered Gabriel to the front yard. “Dean’s hearing is better than a human’s.”
“Don’t,” Dean chuckles, kissing Castiel under his chin, down the side of his neck, just where he knows Castiel likes it. “I don’t blame you and you know what? It feels fucking great for me knowing I’m someone to be jealous over.”
“How so?”
“He was drunk off his ass. Told me I’m… Well it doesn’t matter, he said a lot of things he obviously can’t mean and that he doesn’t remember and then he basically passed out. I put him in my bed and slept on the couch.”
“They’re beautiful.”
He grinned unexpectedly when he thought about dad having to reconcile with the idea of Cas, as a permanent fixture in their lives. Fuck, that was a scary thought, though…
“Stop sounding so amused, I’m mortified!”
Cas looked at him with glinting eyes for a moment but followed without a sound when Dean started walking back to camp.
“Have you heard back from Jess? You wrote her, right?”
How his upbringing had been strict but not without love, for his younger years. How their lives had changed when their father had had an affair and their mother had found out about it and fell into depression. About why Gabriel called their home broken even though their parents stayed together and tried to make it work for their two sons. How it had truly broken down when their mother had had a stroke and died in their home while both sons were in college and their father was at work.
“I wanna see.”
“It’s nice.”
“What are you doing home?”
“Hello Mr. Winchester,” Cas said, voice warm, and held out a hand for dad to shake. “You can call me Cas.”
Cas answered something in Russian, something low that he growled out, still looking away, and fuck Dean’s stupid body but of course it made him weak in the knees when he heard Cas speaking that language, in that tone.
“It’s hot,” Sam warns him the moment after the bread pops out of the toaster.
fucking century.”
Dean’s whole body jolted with delight. “Really?”
“Shit, Dean,” Cas let go of his dick and put his other hand on his ass too. “You’re gonna make me come.”
“Shut up,” Dean chuckles, bad at taking compliments like usual. Maybe Daddy can fix that?
Wasn’t like he cared about why a fucking
and it surprised him.
(Keep telling yourself that, little Deanmon)
“Yeah?”
He pulled away with great effort, frightened by his own beastly needs. “Dean…”
He flashes Dean a smile. “I thought I’d keep them on for the prepping, I need them to control myself.”
Meg seems to seriously consider this for a moment, chewing as she thinks. “Maybe?” she looks at Cas. “But it’d have to be someone with the right, aura, you know?”
He lay there for long moments, just taking in how it felt to have the angel in his arms, to hold him like this, so human and fragile. Although he supposed Cas was no more fragile like this than he was in his true form…
A thin string of precome sticks to his fingers when he removes them but it breaks off as he brings his fingers to his mouth. He wants to be a silly romantic who thinks his lover’s come tastes the best but the truth is that over the years he has learnt that basically all spunk taste virtually the same. With that in mind, it’s easy for him to imagine he’s licking up Dean’s spend instead of sucking on his own. And while the taste of his lover might not mean much to him, the
(See the end of the chapter for
“And don’t you worry, I know you’re just dying to meet him, and you will. I just wanna do this on his terms.”
Cas’ breathing hitched and he started stroking himself faster. “More, tell me more. You’d wanna bite me?”
Dean’s so excited he can’t help but squirm in the Alpha’s lap, grinning like a fool. “I fucking love you, little Alpha.”
Early posting this week because Life y'all 🤣
Sam opened and closed his mouth for a moment and Dean shifted, uncomfortable with how he’d expressed himself.
Castiel is soon gliding in and out of Dean without problem and if he had been with an experienced bottom he would soon have been satisfied with the stretch. But Dean is new to this and Castiel anyhow likes Dean’s breathless little hiccups.
Dean grabbed Cas’ fur and started stroking his dick with long, measured movements. Cas made a sound, the first sound he’d made during these encounters since Dean initiated them days ago, and for how low it actually was, it reverberated through Dean’s whole being. He bit his lower lip and looked down, seeing his dick going in and out of his hand, Cas’ snout so close.
thinking about Cas, still constituted as thinking about him. Well, fuck.
“For an exorcism?” Castiel balked but Balthazar’s grip on his elbow tightened so he couldn’t step away. “You can’t be serious.”
It had ranged from simple things like Balthazar being thankful for Gabriel’s cooking to Gabriel being thankful for his recent success at work. But then the turn had come to Dean and the little demon had looked at them with big eyes, blushed a pretty (
“Yeah,” Gabriel mumbled, shaking his head sadly. “Poor guy, I wonder why the other demons let him live at all?”
“That’s correct. Very good, Dean.”
Yeah, Dean felt it too, the pleasure sharp now, and he moaned against Cas’ shoulder, head bowed as he forced himself to keep the slow pace. Oh he wanted to just slam all the way in and start rutting like an animal but also no, he wanted to do this
“Oh yeah,” Cas said, stroking his hand along Boxer’s strong neck. “This isn’t your usual horse. What happened to the other one?”
Gabriel squinted so hard Castiel almost thought his brother’s face would get stuck like that.
Dean was well aware that his proposition sounded childish; that a date like the one he wanted was something high school kids went on. But hell, he wanted to do something nice and easy with Cas and if Dean had known of any museums with cool exhibits, he would take Cas if he thought that was something the man wanted. But the truth was that they knew very little about each other and Dean wanted to change that, one small step at a time. And besides, mom and dad went out on “movie dates”, as mom called them, all the time and they were even older than Cas. Maybe there was no age limit to enjoying some popcorn and a flick.
He shifts from foot to foot, almost crossing into the room. His eyes flick down to Dean’s dick, reviving it completely, and up again to Dean’s no doubt stricken face.
“I love chicken,” Dean mumbles.
“That just keeps getting better and better,” he said, grinning widely. “Used to be fucking terrifying.”
That made Cas grin. “Oh I’m not letting you out of my sight.”
Cas chuckled. “Gabriel and Kali have been dating on and off since their freshman year in college,” he informed Dean with a grin. “Their ups and downs made Gabriel the black sheep of the family.”
Cas doesn’t immediately jump in like Dean had expected him to. Instead he steps up to Dean and runs his hands all over the Omega’s body. Once again Dean is struck by how big they are, much surer now than when they slept on the bed, Cas brushes them up and down Dean’s chest. Pinching nipples, pressing his fingers against every rib, down to Dean’s twitching hips where he grabs harshly to pull the Omega back against his hard cock.
The creature looked up at him, the black of its eyes bleeding away to show incredibly human-looking eyes. Castiel felt so stunned by this (to him) new feature that he couldn’t find words.
He pushes down his inner Alpha, who of course roars with triumph when Dean is referred to as his, because he feels he really has to focus. His Omega what?
His hard cock practically slapped Dean’s butt when Castiel pushed down his pants with seldom seen coordination. Dean made a keening sound and canted up his ass, tail twitching. It took him two tries to get his cock aligned with Dean’s hole, awkwardly bumping the demon’s ass cheeks and grumping drunkenly about it, fumbling with Dean’s body to pull him closer. And then he was in and it was glorious.
It took Dean two days to come back to Castiel.
“It’s fine,” he said instead and hoped his smile didn’t look as strained as it felt.
Ever since they agreed that they would leave they’d said they should save what money they had and what gold they managed to gather. It hadn’t been explicitly mentioned but Dean had assumed that that meant no more frivolous spending, like whores. Although, to be fair, that wasn’t why he hadn’t gone to
Also, Cas was hot as fuck.
he wants Dean to like how he looks but that would be too presumptuous to say, wouldn’t it? “I wouldn’t mind if you…” God, he’s so bad at this…
It’s sticky and all over Castiel and he loves it, loves the way it feels and smells, wishes he could be coated in it always. He all but falls down on the bed again, his mind fuzzy, and all he registers is Dean’s wide smile and pleased scent. It lulls him to a feeling of protection and love, and he endeavors to smile back but honestly doesn’t know what comes out.
“They’re so pink,” Castiel rumbled, voice fucking
And Dean knows Bobby means Sam, and he feels momentarily ashamed that that wasn’t what he had meant at all. Sure, having Sam here will make it perfect, but Dean is happy knowing that Sam will live a full life, hopes for a better future for his little brother. Actually hopes it will take him a long ass time to get here, even with the different time flow, whatever that means.
“You don’t have to,” Dean murmurs. “I’ll go take a shower.”
Now, in this chapter we get to see Dean's POV, to get some insight in what's going on in his mind. Please remember to heed all the tags and stay safe! 😄
“This okay?”
,” Dean lolls his head to the side to smile dopely at Cas and yes, it completely makes Cas’ heart flip like a dumbass. “Woulda been so fucking rad if you’d been there. We would drink and
Why though? Why not go to his parents? Cas’ stomach twists when he considers the possibility of Dean being abused at home, but he pushes the thought aside for now. He will pull the truth out of Dean, and he refuses to assume anything before the boy has had a chance to explain it himself. This time, though, with how hurt Dean looks right now, Cas won’t let the issue rest. He needs answers and he needs them as soon as possible.
“Good for you.”
(You’ve got him in the palm of your hand)
out and proud, and hiding it for special occasions so he didn’t have to get asshole treatment more than necessary. He supposed it was a fine line to thread, and he would have to take it one step at a time, starting with getting comfortable in his own skin first. For one, he
“Good,” Dean murmurs. “Then this won’t be sexual assault.”
No he didn’t. He’d loved Sammy as much as a demon could love someone, the other demon being as close to family as a demon could have, but that didn’t mean Dean had to like every little thing Sammy said or did. And he didn’t appreciate being made a fool.
The eyes that met Dean’s were blown wide with lust and Dean’s breathing stuck in his throat. Cas looked delirious and challenging at the same time and Dean pressed closer, face hovering over Cas’. The change in angle must have done something inside Cas because he squeezed his eyes shut and groaned with pleasure.
(Or maybe I did, I guess we’ll never know now)
“So he’s Sam,” she mumbled, knees momentarily squeezing against his hips. “I saw your brother in town today, he’s handsome.”
“Then why did you ask me?” Dean laughed, lightly punching Cas’ arm.
young and stupid so I’m gonna give you the benefit of the doubt,
Dean huffed out a smile and ducked his head, squeezing Cas’ calf once before letting go and sitting back on his heels.
He put his hands on his hips, slowly sliding them up his stomach and chest, over sensitive nipples and up his neck. Closing his eyes and letting his head loll back he repeated the motion, all the way back down again to his hips. His groin already felt on fire and he keened lowly, sinking to the floor when his knees gave out as a wave of arousal hit him.
“So I see,” Castiel said smugly and walked over to Dean, much too close even for acquaintances. “I’m man enough to own up to my loss,” he said with a smile and pulled out his wallet to fish out a fifty, one among many, though he didn’t show Dean that, not interested in catching the man that way.
Dean took a swig of the rum, thumb stroking along his dick, watching with contemplating eyes as Cas pushed his nose as close as he could without touching, mouth slightly open. Dean’s mind felt a jumble, but he was too drunk to get embarrassed that he was getting aroused. Cas’ eyes were too focused on him in this vulnerable moment for him not to feel
“Yeah,” Dean murmurs, voice thick with his arousal. “Come on, you get it.”
“I’m riding you tonight,” Dean shot back, eyes glinting and Castiel shuddered with pleasure.
And all he could see was Cas’ handsome face contorted in beautiful pained pleasure.
Dean’s whole body trembled. “What?”
The house Dean drives them to is a one and a half story house with an attached garage close to KU’s west campus, close enough that Dean most probably could have stayed at home like Castiel does, although Castiel most definitely sees the benefits of Dean’s dorm room. It looks inviting with a well-kept lawn and a huge maple tree in the front yard. Walking past the tree, Castiel sees evidence of a swing having once hung from one of the lower branches and he smiles to himself imagining the Winchester brothers playing in the yard.
Bobby scoffs, still smiling. “Was,” he emphasizes. “Now I’m not. That kid of yours, before he went,” he bobs his head, finding the words. “Wherever. Made some changes here. Busted my ass out. And then he… well, he set some things right.”
“Yeah tell me about it,” Sam shook his head, helping Dean unload his horse. “And the best part is, they’ve got lumber.”
“That’s too bad,” Castiel said and put down his fork, pushing his plate away a little. “Because I am too, I couldn’t possibly finish this. I guess we’ll have to throw it out, then.”
The boy clenches his hands on Cas’ shoulders, hips bucking helplessly as Cas digs his fingers in against Dean’s crack through his jeans.
“This will be perfect.”
There was a beat of silence, only broken by the natural sounds that were always all around them and that Dean now hated because it reminded him of things left unspoken.
“Cas, wait,” Dean’s dick would kill him, but he had to fucking say this. He grabbed Cas’ wrist lightly, making the man look at him. Fuck he was pretty this up close, Dean wanted to kiss him more than anything else in that moment. “I just… we don’t have to do this if you don’t want to?”
Not here though.
“Excuse me?” Cas splutters. He is the adult,
“And he made me pancakes for breakfast.”
Cas answered with only a grunt and fucking hell, then he was pressing inside.
If Dean was completely honest, he wasn’t even sure why he was making such an effort to help Cas aside from the fact that leaving felt incomprehensible at this point. The angel had grown on him over the past week and Dean couldn’t help but feel accomplished when he looked at Cas. He’d saved the angel, kept him alive, cleaned him, fed him, and to see Cas lying in the grass smelling the flowers made Dean’s chest swell with pride.
“Still,” he mumbled, and Dean saw him clutching the straps to his backpack.
A little because Dean was nervous to jinx it but mostly because what he and Cas had wasn’t a
boat needed fixing. That had felt
Dean rose to sit on his hip, leaned on one hand as he looked down at Cas’ calm face. His straight nose and pink lips. His scruffy cheeks and closed eyelids.
Cas was fucking adorable when he almost stumbled the few steps up his porch and to the door. “I—yeah.”
A shudder went through Dean’s whole body.
Dean’s dick was pressed up against his stomach, hard as fuck and red at the tip, and Dean licked his lips looking at Cas’ dick, so close to his own. He wanted to stroke it, wanted to feel it against his own dick, wanted Cas’ come all over him, but for now he settled on putting his hands on Cas’ thighs, squeezing them.
But apparently that was the wrong thing to ask. Dean’s open face immediately shut off and his eyes reverted back to black so fast it was dizzying.
Dean’s orgasm built slowly, completely different to how it usually was and somehow, he liked this much better. He bumped his cheek against Cas’, groaned, tried to warn Cas that he was getting close because suddenly that felt like a nice thing to do to your partner. Something Dean wanted to do to Cas; involve him in Dean’s orgasm. Not just take.
to die now. He did that, he put that expression on Dean, even though he was so sure he was doing the right thing pushing the boy away so he
Cas laughed again then, carefree and lovingly. “Sorry, guess you didn’t want to hear that from your fuck buddy, huh?”
Cas looks like he’s fighting a blush and Dean kind of hopes that he is because how cute wouldn’t that be? Grown-ass Alpha
“Thank you,” Dean smiled, petting Button slowly, feeling warm all over.
Dean bumbled into the kitchen without a plan. “Oh hey,” he grinned dumbly at the two men. Mikey had the same black hair and sharp jawline as Cas and though Dean knew nothing about it, his first instinct told him that the two were related, at least as cousins. “The door was open and I called out but I guess you didn’t hear me.”
Sammy was right, he could just sneak a peek, or even listen by the door. Well, if he peeked inside, he might see Cas naked, which Dean wanted a whole lot, so that was probably what he would do. Yeah.
Two hours was an unusually long time to prep himself and his room, especially considering that Castiel sometimes only got two minutes before he had to get ready to please another client. But in this case he understood why and was frankly thankful for it.
He takes his already soiled shirt and uses a clean end to wipe Castiel’s face off.
time,
And apparently so does Cas because the moment his eyes land on Dean’s no doubt debauched face he groans filthily and pulls Dean up to kiss him. He licks hungrily into Dean’s mouth and Dean nearly doubles over when he feels Cas’ hand on his hard dick. Fuck he’s so ready to just go off but he doesn’t want to ruin Cas’ clothes.
Castiel feels incredibly touched, and a little indignant at the same time. He knows Dean’s coming from a good place and considering what they’ve been through in the past, he can see Dean’s reasoning too, but still.
No, that was best forgotten and when Cas silently offered his wings to Dean, Dean just accepted it as a token of their friendship being intact and unchanged.
“That’s enough,” Cas snarled, and Meg made a surprised sound when he pulled her away. “You’re being overtly mean, and I won’t let you treat Dean like this.”
There, just to his right, is suddenly this wooden building and how the hell didn’t he see that immediately? On top of it there’s a sign that reads “Harvelle’s Roadhouse” and Dean’s a bit thrown because he doesn’t remember it looking like this. But more than that, in front of it, on a rickety patio chair, is Bobby.
“Do you know what topping from the bottom means?”
Dean blinked and then snapped out of his trance when Benny laughed at him. “Sorry, man.”
For now, without much to go on, the teachers agree to simply mention to their students that if they need to talk, they are more than welcome to do so. Nora, the student councilor, takes the issue severely and Cas feels confident in her expertise on the matter. They also agree to “patrol” (for the lack of a better word) the school grounds, at least during school hours. Cas even gets some teachers to volunteer to stay overtime to assure there are more teachers around during sports practice, although he has to bribe them with extra pay of course.
When Cas opened his eyes, they were so close that Dean’s whole world filled with
“Hiya, Cas,” he greets softly, smile grazing his plump lips.
To be honest, in a lot of aspects Michael acts like a typical Alpha, like the kind Dean despises, and though he vowed before coming here to not let what Cas has told him about Michael color his initial impressions with the Beta, it’s getting more and more difficult to ignore that he’s kind of a douche. Dean likes to form his own opinions about people and it’s not like he has doubted Cas’ words but damn, he didn’t think all it would take to confirm it would be a few words and a handshake…
“Yeah it fucking is,” Dean stated confidently, although a bit breathlessly. Arousal was assaulting him now, making his knees weak even as his dick grew harder. “I thought about it before, but I was in denial. Because if it
“I saw the trailer, it looks fun,” he reached for the plate with what was left over of the pie. A heated trail of arousal went through Dean when Cas used his spoon to have a taste. “We could go see it and—Jesus fuck, Dean,” he made a grimace and swallowed with obvious effort. “How have you been eating that? It tastes rank.”
(Oh, come
“You sound so fucking good, no way I’m answ—”
He had his legs slightly spread, one knee up and Dean’s eyes roamed over what was offered to him. Cas’ balls looked heavy and full, his taint a dusty rosy and Dean just now realized that he had never really
And Cas usually got all adorably shy about it when asked, but Dean was always happy to tell the story of how they met. Or “the greatest love story ever told”, as he usually put it.
Cas took a few steps into the room, reaching for Dean. “Are you okay? Did you hit your head?”
Putting on the cap was easy enough as well and he felt satisfied when all of Andrea’s hair stuck inside as it was supposed to. The real tricky part came when he had to flip on the wig and fasten it with the hooks. That took a few tries, mostly because he was still nervous about hurting his pup, so he didn’t fasten the wig securely enough. The end result was satisfactory, though, and he breathed a sigh of relief when Andrea demonstrated the sturdiness by headbanging a few times.
have a great time. Instead, he met a guy called Arnold, who was so eager to fuck Dean he wanted to do it in the bathroom stall of the club they were in. And while Dean normally didn’t like to do that he agreed, only to have Arnold cream his pants before they even got started. Dean was so fucking done and tired by then that he didn’t even care that Arnold got mad at him and started calling him nasty things because he obviously was embarrassed. Instead, Dean just walked out of there and went home to curl up on the couch and stare blankly at the TV while Sam watched a shark documentary.
“Yeah…” Sam was frowning when Dean looked at him. “I’ve heard him mentioned. Cassie, right?”
He approached with sinking dread, his colleagues hunching down in their own cubicles, lest they draw their hard-ass boss’ attention to themselves.
“Pretty much,” Dean mumbled and tried to duck out of the room quickly, but mom caught him because of course she did.
“Why do you think I have no meat with me?”
“Yeah…” he sighed, their enthusiasm infectious. “But it’s not… easy. Like, I don’t know what the hell I’m doing.”
Gabriel, for his part, looked like he was about to melt from cuteness overload, which clearly wasn’t the kind of look someone should sport when coming face to face with a presumably dangerous demon.
“You do know how hypocritical it sounds when you tell me not to just take your word for it when it’s exactly what you do with me?”
“And we eat on plates,” Dean informed Cas prudently, making the human chuckle. Dean liked that sound.
He twisted his body to touch his hole gingerly, finding it puffy and tender enough to make him wince but damn, that had been exactly what Dean had wanted. He looked at Castiel with a new grin and found him studying Dean with a sympathetic look.
Up here on Earth, though, life felt beautiful. And humans… humans were very interesting to Dean. The thought of having sex with other demons or devils or the tortured carcasses in Hell squicked Dean out. But the thought of a human…
Cas growled, jowls trembling, mouth opening as if to swallow Dean’s shoulder. The hold around his upper body tightened momentarily and then he was let down. He grinned up at the angel, Cas sitting on his hind legs and towering over Dean, horns making him look even taller and wings adding a good three feet to his girth even though they weren’t particularly unfolded.
By the time Castiel reached high school he had no friends aside from his cousin Gabriel and rumors about him being able to see people’s souls and detect lies with his dead-looking left eye circulated at the school before he even started there.
“You listen here, Alpha. It’s my turn to decide and we’re going as
at all has taken an interest in Cas. It makes it sound as if she didn’t think her youngest son would be able to ever find a mate and really, what the fuck is up with that?
Come to think of it, he and Benny had known each other for a pretty long time, they were true buddies by now and Benny was actually really good-looking. Kind of scruffy but Dean didn’t mind that…
“Yeah, I can see it.”
“That’s good.”
it was called, and Dean thought as he tied his trustworthy horse, Creed, outside that that was a very apt name. Or at least he hoped it would be.
“No, baby, none of that,” Dean shushes gently and gets to his feet, cradling Castiel to his wide chest, hugging him close. “There’s nothing wrong with wanting it, nothing at all. Some people wanna be called bad and be spanked as a punishment, some want to be called good and get it as a reward, and some want, well I dunno, other things out of it, okay?”
(This bitch doesn’t know shit)
He takes his dick in hand when a jolt runs through it so that it jerks and slaps him on his thigh. Pleasure soothes out from his groin, making him melt against the bed and he sighs out a smile, stroking lazily. Today there’s no real fantasy that plays in his mind, instead he simply lays there and thinks about Cas, rubbing his body against the trench coat and playing with one of its arms.
“I would hardly call broken ribs altercations.”
“So I’ve noticed,” Cas picks up a piece of paper, a form for occasions like this, and puts on his reading glasses. “I wish you would tell me who the other people are, we need to get to the root of this problem. Is it Gordon Walker?”
Dean couldn’t believe he could even be this happy, it was ridiculous.
“Well, Cas’ family is making him go on this charity auction thing because his mom’s hosting it and he really doesn’t want to go because they’ll probably be talking about his failed marriage since they all seem to think it was his fault. So he wanted me to come with him to make him feel better. Since, you know, my company makes him comfortable.”
“I don’t know what it is,” he said, voice low and urgent, somehow. “I just have this feeling that I shouldn’t leave. As if something terrible is about to happen.”
In retrospect, telling the lie about only finding angel tracks had been a stroke of genius. Because now Dean could talk to Sam, ask him for help getting stuff, and could count on his brother to keep dad from being suspicious about Dean being away more than normal.
sleeping,” Sam piped up and Dean glared at his little brother, who just grinned moronically back. Most of the kitchen table was covered in books and notepads because apparently Sammy thought the best way to spend his summer was to prepare for high school with a couple of summer classes. He was such a fucking dork it hurt to look at him sometimes, but Dean loved him all the same. “How’s your wrist?”
stays a lot in the cockpit, today is of course different and he would start feeling bad about that if it wasn’t for the fact that the object of his desires is ridiculously hot. Plus Benny’s cool about it, has probably figured something special is up by now.
“That’s true,” Castiel agreed, vowing to try and talk to Dean more about this. “Well, we should get back to the party before they come looking for us. Although,” he stopped himself as he was getting off the chair. “I have one more question. It’s about angelic magic.”
“I know,” Balthazar smiled kindly. “I know.”
He moaned into it, arching his back and jutting up his hips, needing to be closer. Cas huffed out a chuckle against Dean’s mouth and rolled with him so that Dean ended up between Cas’ legs, hovering above him. They still had some blankets between them, but Dean could feel that Cas was hard too and he grinded greedily down against him.
Michael smirks, leaning one hand on the wall next to them. “You’re cocky, I like that.”
Because of that, Dean had decided to stick like glue to Button any time he took the rabbit out of the cage. In the spring they would buy an outside cage as well, and Dean would be allowed to play with Button in the yard too. He honestly couldn’t wait.
Cas had slid down on the bed some, but he was still looking at Dean and his eyes widened at Dean’s words.
Yes, the succubus side of Dean was directing much of this, that much was clear, whether or not the demon understood it himself. But there was also something more, Castiel could feel it in his heart, even as his cock stood to attention in his sweatpants. The urge to protect and to cherish was because of something else, was because of Dean’s human side, Castiel
“Yes,” Castiel conceded easily because what was the point in arguing the obvious?
“Tell him what?” Dean croaks out, interrupting Charlie. “We’re still
Jo’s tone is sugar sweet and he throws her a dirty look before continuing. “I was thinking that I want the mating to be special, you know? Like, knowing us we’ll probably do it during sex and I don’t like to kiss and tell but—” he cuts himself off when Jo snorts so hard it sounds as if her brain should’ve ended up on the floor. This time his grumpy look is real. “Okay, I don’t like to kiss and tell
He grabs weakly at Dean’s body, trying to move his tongue and lips in sync with Dean’s and the Omega melts against him, his scent blooming with affection. As much as Castiel loves this he feels the first tendrils of sleep beckoning him and he pulls out of the kiss with a little whimper.
Dean put a hand on the small of Cas’ back, intent on leading him over to Boxer. He almost tripped on his own feet but managed to right himself with Cas’ help.
was worth his time. Much more so than snorting tequila and salt from a random woman’s slick body or dancing poorly on rickety tables. Castiel felt more alive in this moment than he had in years.
The boy relaxes, almost as if he wants to be manhandled and yeah, Cas is about to come alright. But to Dean’s apparent surprise, Cas uses his grip to push the boy off. He grabs a few napkins off the holder on his desk and pulls Dean up, spins them around, pushing the boy to sit on the desk’s edge just as he kneels himself.
into a black forest. Dean scoffed at them, although he ate their catches just fine, same as they ate his at the end of the day.
“Let’s get you out, huh?” he mumbles lovingly, more to the cock than Cas, and sits back on his heels to pull on the underwear.
Castiel huffs when Dean puts his weight on the Alpha’s chest but he shifts soon enough, stretching out over Castiel on all fours. Castiel can’t help but growl at the loss of contact with the Omega’s ass but his focus instantly shifts when he sees Dean’s hard dick dangling in front of his face.
“You’re like
Decision made, he snuck downstairs again, still a bit uncertain why he was tiptoeing around as if he was doing something bad. The door to the bathroom was slightly ajar and Dean couldn’t remember if he had left it like that or not, but he thought he had, considering he still heard the sound of the shower, so Cas had probably not exited it yet.
Dean whimpered as the man gripped his hips, pressing hard enough to definitely leave bruises as he fucked Dean. Dean’s whole body jostled with the forceful thrusts, the man’s sharp hipbones smacking painfully against Dean’s ass.
Okay, that came out wrong. Cas looked devastated for a moment. “I’m…”
He keeps them still for a moment until Dean relaxes again, and then he pulls out, starting a slow rhythm of in and out, going a little bit deeper each time. Dean responds spectacularly by moving with Cas, taking him further and more easily each time.
, and Dean’s eyes flicked down to Castiel’s lips, sticking there a moment too long. Was he even aware what he was doing to Castiel?
, and his breath caught in his throat. That wasn’t a human cry of anger, that was an enraged
“So, Cas,” he pushes down the Alpha so that Cas ends up sitting on Dean’s bed with his back against the wall as Dean comes to straddle his lap. Cas looks pleasantly surprised, but he also eyes the door and Dean gets that because Cas doesn’t know Charlie’s class doesn’t end for another hour. “I’ve been thinking.”
I've added
, complete with a wig of wild red hair. And they had both seemed happy with their choices.
“I want to be inside you,” Cas rasps, hands massaging Dean’s ass as their hips roll together. “Tell me you can come over tonight?”
“I want to,” he sighs and pulls his phone out of his jeans pocket. “But I’m actually already late for a study session with Benny and Charlie.”
Actually Cas had been speaking in broader terms but of course, he’s been team switch since he first figured out sex.
“Dean,” he pressed out, voice beyond recognition to his own ears. “Dean I need to…”
Cas rumbled, pushing harder, so hard that Dean would have fallen down if he hadn’t been holding onto the horns. As it was, he slipped and Cas more or less lowered him to the ground, nose still against Dean’s stomach and teeth nipping at his clothes now, tearing little holes.
He pushed the bowl of rice over to Dean when the creature nodded his head. After a short hesitation, Castiel plated Dean’s food for him and then went to get Dean a glass. By the time he got back (not even a minute later), Dean had almost finished his serving of rice and chicken stew.
“I missed you too,” Castiel mumbles, hands roaming Dean’s body. He can practically feel the Omega’s whole being thrum with need and his own body vibrates with the desire to fill that need.
Also wonders what Dean might be getting up to at parties.
He fumbles through a frantic search of his pantry but barely comes up with enough for the crust and now he doesn’t even have enough time. What he wants even less than having no pie is getting caught in the middle of making one. Because what if Dean doesn’t actually want to stay? Cas would look like a proper fool standing there with his hands covered in dough as Dean laughs at him.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, hiding against Button. He jerked when he felt Cas’ hand on his head in the next moment, stroking his hair and horns. He looked up again, seeing Cas smile kindly down at him. It made Dean’s heart flutter, his tail twitching. Cas was so handsome, straight jaw and brilliant eyes. Long legs and strong arms and…
this to be over as soon as possible.
Dean didn’t care what Sammy said because it wasn’t the same. It
Dean grits his teeth for a moment, squeezing his dick, and then looks up, meeting Cas’ inquiring eyes boldly.
Immediately as the words left Dean’s mouth, he heard how wrong it sounded, but before he could take them back, Cas had already started shuffling the dead angel towards Dean.
But on the whole he feels mightily pleased with himself, especially when he remembers catching Cas with his hand on his groin, obviously rubbing. That’s progress and Dean didn’t know he wanted it before tonight.
“Where is Sammy now?” Balthazar cut in when Castiel couldn’t sort his thoughts.
but damnit, Cas, I know you also want to be marked, you want us to belong together. You like it a little possessively, and for it to go both ways.”
He gets some chores done and with a cold shower he manages to control his erection so he won’t end up with something stupid like priapism over holding out for Cas. But damn, he just wants to jerk off already!
The words came out raspier than he meant. Cas looked like he was surprised that was what Dean wanted to ask right now, but not surprised to be asked per se.
It was only after Dean had told Castiel about the myriad of things he’d confirmed to be edible (like pinecones), and after they’d stopped at an old uprooted tree that Castiel remembered from his childhood as being much bigger and Dean had told him about which insects were good to eat, that Castiel came to a realization.
(Yeah, right)
and the way Sam reacts, turning around with a surprised but hopeful expression at the familiar sound of Cas’ restored wings carrying him home to the brothers. To their side where he belongs.
Yeah, that was enough to make Dean feel so great about this whole thing, about his whole goddamn life, that he endured Benny griping at him with a smile on his face, once more positive about the future and his potential relationship with Cas.
Castiel blinks, his tumbler nearly slipping from his fingers. “I’m sorry?”
“I bought this horse,” he blurted when it looked like Cas was about to say something. It cut Cas off and he turned to really look at Boxer for the first time. “’is name’s Boxer.”
“C’mere,” he murmured and gathered Dean closer in a tight embrace.
boat, and—”
“Yeah, we’re
, they would look so good on you.”
Jo and Charlie both make kind of squeaky noises and Dean ignores them for now. Instead he turns back, peeking through the curtains only to find the man covertly but not subtly sneaking peeks of his own.
“What did he mean?” Cas asked, tone casual and light, completely unbothered by the tension that threatened to suffocate Dean. “When he said, ‘finally back’?”
Sammy had always said that.
“Well you do,” Dean mumbles, looking down again. “Look good in them, I mean.”
He’d deliberately done more food than he would eat so that he would have left-overs for work but somehow that didn’t seem to matter to him as he watched the creature scarf down the next portion as if he were afraid the food would spontaneously combust if he wasn’t fast enough.
Castiel feels uncomfortable. Benny is sitting too close to Dean, being too familiar with him, and Castiel doesn’t know what to make of that. He can concede that he doesn’t have that many male friends and the few he has had over the years were just as indoctrinated by the church’s values about homosexuality as he was so there was always a distance between them. Even with Jimmy, and even now, Castiel has a hard time touching more than necessary.
“Yes,” Cas said kindly, taking Dean’s hand. “You said your mom was a demon and there’s no doubt in my mind what kind she was.”
Mom caught him when he was busy combing it all back like some goddamn Hollywood brat and thankfully saved him.
Cas doesn’t know what to think of it and has long ago decided not to bring it up because it makes him sound like a desperate fool, doesn’t it? Why would he want Dean to call or text him anyway? They’re supposed to be
“Yes, that’s about the extent of my knowledge too. Do you think,” Castiel hesitated, the question almost seeming too ludicrous to say out loud. “Do you think demons could master it on their own?”
“You smell good,” Cas whispered then, voice hoarse, and Dean shuddered.
That made Dean ridiculously happy to hear. Sometimes it felt as if Cas didn’t eat anything but survived on water and cigarettes and it made him want to hand feed the man.
Jo is another one of those reliable crew members that Dean’s started to think of as family by now.
“I don’t know,” Castiel mumbles to his plate. “I’ve never asked one before.”
see definitely woke the beast in him.
Surprise washed off that horrible smile and Cas stared at Dean with wide eyes. “What? Why?”
Cas is Dean’s Alpha, end of story.
If he was quiet enough then it should be fine, right?
on his
“D-Dean?” Cas stammered, obviously surprised. Fucking hell, Cas smelled so fucking
They’re making plans for the weekend; Meg wants to visit a new steakhouse that’s opened in town and Cas is always up for a good steak so he’s getting excited. Especially considering he’s eating a boring heap of leftover pasta salad right now.
Okay y'all know Cas' inner thighs were made for biting, don't @ me
“We shouldn’t,” he murmured, even as he turned Dean around and pressed his clothed cock against the demon’s inviting little ass. “There’s people downstairs.”
Cas laughs, feeling elated for some reason. “I suppose that’s true. Today I was thinking of watering my lawn since it’s been unusually warm lately but I can’t seem to get the sprinklers going. I think it’s busted,” he can’t help but keep smiling when Dean looks so attentively at him. “So I guess I better adult my way to the hardware store and buy a new one.”
It was about one month into his stay in the apartment and mom kept hounding him to get curtains or at least blinds, when he noticed
Cas kept his foot on Dean’s groin, though, the pressure just right and Dean moaned around Cas’ dick, taking him deeper than before.
Dean doesn’t do that very often. Mostly he’s just content with picking out his favorite picture of his friend and look at that. It’s nice and soothing and hot as all hell. Dean’s best orgasms always include Cas in some way. Another favorite is using that old-as-fuck voicemail Cas left once. They were supposed to meet up for something, Dean doesn’t even remember what, probably food, and Cas was running late. So he’d called, Dean had missed it and it’d gone to voicemail.
Okay, maybe they’re a bit
“I will not,” he protests mildly. “You dumped Nick over that kink, I need Dean too much to play with him like that.”
Safe and cherished and seen.
Dean’s eyes roamed Cas’ body,
, shrunk away and the air around him became easier to breathe. The horrific black veins seemed to dissipate, and he once again looked like the little demon Castiel had come to love.
The Omega looks up, holds Castiel’s eyes for a moment, and then smiles sweetly. “Or I’ll get hold of your number and text you, whichever is fine. Can’t wait to talk to you, Alpha.”
“You have to say that. You’re my dad,” she muttered. Castiel grinned, both at her and his proud inner Alpha.
Dean looks a bit sullen when Cas comes to answer the door. All week during school Dean had almost shied away from Cas and though he doesn’t know what, Cas is sure it’s because of something he did or said during their impromptu meeting at the grocery store. Dean had been upset then and Cas has been itching to ask why (and if the boy feels better) but has been unable to get a word in without actively calling Dean to the Principal's office and that seems mean when the boy hasn’t actually done anything wrong.
Dean walked over to the dresser where a stack of coins was placed neatly beside a small stone. It was smooth and round, flat and almost white. Dean picked it up without thought, turning it over in his hand.
“I don’t know,” Cas sounds way too amused, his scent mighty pleased and Dean turns into the Alpha’s light touches. “I think he deserved to be punched.”
But that was a talk he saved for another day. For now, he’d decided to be happy with what he’d gotten for his boldness, aka a giant, snarling beast that gave him the best orgasms of his life and who then proceeded to cuddle him without Dean having to embarrass himself by asking for it. All in all, a great turnout in Dean’s opinion.
“It’s just that angels are dangerous, right?” he mumbled, putting the bowl on the ground beside the angel and turning to go fetch a rag to soak in the pond. “I thought for sure you were going to kill me, and maybe my whole village. But I helped you anyway so…” he looked at the angel just as he dunked the rag. “So I guess all I’m saying is please don’t kill me or anyone else around here. Okay?”
He smiled at the angel. “What do you say we take a bath? It was chilly up there but down here it’s like a goddamn furnace.”
Dean made a sound of resignation, bowing his head once more and it was basically all Castiel could take at this point. He spit down on Dean’s hole to add a little more, anything to make this smoother, and then he was pressing inside.
“I wanna be good for you.”
“But you don’t really want that,” Gabe mumbles and then yanks softly on Cas’ leg. “Hey. Look at me, kiddo,” he looks more serious than Cas has ever seen him. “You did the right thing.”
Cas let out a growl and let his cock slide against Dean, all the way up to his chin, bumping his cheek when Dean turned his head, and then down again, never losing contact, too massive to do that in this position. Dean moaned again, clenching his thighs around Cas’ cock and moving with the angel’s motions.
Castiel’s heart flutters at the thought of Dean wanting to be with him for, well, forever. He hopes that one day Dean and Sam will give up hunting and come live here in Pontiac, in a life of peaceful retirement, though he doesn’t dare hope too much. He’s honestly just glad as long as they keep on surviving their dangerous occupation.
Fallout time!
He’d asked Lisa to the festival, just like he’d planned to do for a while, just like he’d wanted to do since last year. And she’d said she was planning on only going with her sister and friends, which was fine, Dean thought. He’d after all based his hopes on rumors so that was that, nothing to fret over. He’d just try again next year.
The redhead smiles playfully. “Gotcha.”
A lonely train horn blares in the distance, insects chirping. Dean sighs to himself as he unlocks Baby’s trunk, noting how dusty she is. She needs a washing and cleaning, both in and out, and Dean recognizes that he’s been doing a shitty job of that ever since the pie festival.
Dean suddenly was. But the man was strong and Dean’s wrists hurt.
“But you have to,” Dean assured him in his most mature tone. “Work is important, right Cas?”
, after Cas had been rendered a complete puddle in Dean’s hands, maybe
“Still so tight,” he murmured, tone sweeter than he had expected.
It made Dean whine and when he shut his eyes the tears poured over at the corners, rolling down his cheeks. He thought he had to look like shit, like a snot-nosed punk, but the pleasure was so sharp now it made his hair stand on end.
Dean had also insisted that Castiel shouldn’t bring anything and though Castiel had agreed since he figured the Omega knew his family the best, he still feels awkward now. Dean had brought a bottle of nice wine to their dinner and now Castiel comes empty handed, like a chump.
Dean blinks and then laughs, straightening to pick up his underwear. “No you doofus, you just saw me in these,” he throws his underwear playfully at Castiel but Castiel reacts lightning fast and snatches them out of the air, Dean’s scent on them thick and enticing. “You…” Dean licks his lips but Castiel can barely think about anything but the scent. “You wanna see me in women’s panties, though?”
