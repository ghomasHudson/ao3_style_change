“Oh, um, yeah, lemme grab you a cup. One second.”
Dean would probably slam his hand on the poor thing, patience not exactly being one of his virtues, but fortunately, Sam is the one to ring it. A few seconds pass until a bored-looking teenager appears in the doorframe of the backroom, emphatically dragging his feet and instinctually rearranging his hair before his eyes. Despite that seemingly innocent gesture, Cas did catch a glimpse of them before they disappeared behind a wall of flat, washed-out blond bangs; they looked fairly reddened, suggesting the boy knows exactly how to spice up his long and slow receptionist shifts, when there aren’t any customers walking in.
“Just as an aside, Charles was
Cas isn’t quite sure what the kid assumed, nor why he awkwardly pointed towards him as he replied, but he decides that getting furiously dedicated to staring at the floor (or the plants, or anywhere that isn’t Dean, really) is the best course of action to follow, from here on out.
“Every fifteen minutes, huh?” Sam asks, returning his attention to his brother.
The angel’s eyes dart to him briefly, but go right back to his phone’s little screen. His soft smile from before turns into something else — an expression you only see on parents’ faces. Dean’s pretty sure there’s no word for it, but it looks a lot like all the emotions in the world having been crammed into one. It… suits Cas (huh?). He wonders if that’s what his face looks like right now, but it doesn’t really matter. He’s too busy slowly loosing all awareness of himself by watching his friend’s (a

Extending his arms in front of him (careful not to hit his computer’s screen, though), fingers intertwined, he cracks his knuckles and his joints, and sighs emphatically, the same way he’s seen professional pianists do in the concert videos he’s watched. This earns him a chuckle coming from behind his back, which he assumes was from Dean.
A giggle ripples through the door and snatches him away from his troubling thoughts, right on time for him to hear the familiar raspy voice utter a muffled ‘

’, with a really strange expression on his face.
“You’ve got yourself a deal, then.” He not-so-reluctantly agrees. They shake on it, and then he’s off and away, practically sprinting to his room. He can still feel Cas’ stare on his neck, and it’s burning again. Good (?) to know.

“Yeah, you do that. But Imma need answers once you wake up, alright?” Dean surprisingly concedes, albeit after a careful pause.

He decides to get it printed, on glossy paper and everything: there’s a shop in town that does stuff like that.

“No, I understand perfectly. You’re the one who needs to catch up. This stuff isn’t good for you.”
“Cas.” The angel’s eyes shot back up to the hunter’s.
“I didn’t know if you’d show up,” Dean admitted. “Sam nearly took me to Bobby’s.” Cas tilted his head, squinting his eyes.
“I need your help with something.” Sam’s brows raised in confusion, prompting Cas to continue. “I won’t be around forever.”
“Does it, Dean? Does it? How do you feel now?” Sam crossed his arms.
“I’m going to kiss you now.” Cas felt the tension release from Dean as he closed in. He felt Dean’s arms around him as their lips made contact. One hand still pressing Dean to the wall, the other gripping Dean’s head. It was everything Cas had ever dreamed of. Maybe more. Definitely not less. Finally, when Cas thought it would go on forever, they pulled apart. Cas searched Dean’s face in an effort to gauge his reaction, but his face was inscrutable. “Dean?” The hunter looked up, looked Cas in the eyes, and smiled. Cas did the same, mesmerized by his vivid green eyes. They were wide and soft. Cas’ eyes trailed down his face, counting each freckle, and stopping at his lips.
“I’m not righteous.”
“Have some uses?” Dean said, voice rising both in pitch and volume despite his best efforts to keep it level. “People aren’t tools.”
“That’s right. You are leaving. With me. We’re going to Bobby’s.” Dean sighed and rolled his eyes, but that only gave him a headache.
“Sam, you need to stop Dean.” Cas could feel his eyes watering, and then he was sobbing. He had never so much as shed a tear before. “Sam, he’s not him anymore. He doesn’t know what he’s doing.”
“It was nothing. Don’t worry about it.” Dean looked down at his shoes, but if he hadn’t, he would’ve seen Castiel look down, too.
“No it was definitely - definitely wanted.” He looked down and smiled, shaking his head softly.
“What do you mean?”
“Really nice.” Castiel dragged out the really, still looking into the distance. Then, with a headshake, he returned to the present and quickly left the room. Dean sighed and followed him.
“I, uh…. I…”
I’m an alligator…
“It’s very Dean,” Cas replied. Sam chuckled.
“The murder?”
“Cas?”
“You need to go,” he said, spitting the words like venom. Dean’s eyes widened in shock.
“Well, now that you explain it, it seems simple.” Castiel sighed and rolled his eyes. Dean realized that wasn’t the nicest thing to say. “Still. Don’t think many people could do that. Nice work.” Castiel gave a small smile.
Cas sighed.
“Castiel,” he greeted warmly, pulling him into a hug. Castiel looked fairly awkward.
“I can help with that.” Cas looked at him inquisitively.
“That’s because I need more, Sam.”
“Why is he ashamed?”
“Police captain?” Dean asked, not sure he heard right. Sam was police captain.
“You need it?”
“He makes me stronger.”
It was late in the evening when Dean and Castiel returned to their new apartment. Dean was exhausted. He had spent all day tagging along with Castiel and Sam as they tried to find the murderer. Castiel had insulted the victim’s spouse twice and run off without warning twice, leaving him trying to catch up. But the worst part was when they’d found the murderer. Castiel and Sam had chased after him, but in their haste they’d gotten themselves surrounded - the murder, it had turned out, was a group thing. Castiel and Sam were surrounded by five angry men who weren’t about to listen to reason. He heard Sam yell for help, and then… he dropped his cane. And he ran. He didn’t think of how to unpack that; his only thoughts were on Castiel and Sam. He drew his gun and hit three over the head before the remaining two bad guys caught on, but by that point they were outnumbered. Dean held his gun to their original suspect’s head while Castiel pinned the other guy to the floor. Sam called for backup, and before long, Dean and Castiel were walking home in the dark and cold.
“Not exactly.”
“Sammy!” he greeted, moving in for a hug. “Nice to see you!” Sam obliged the hug for a few seconds, but quickly squirmed away, approaching Cas.
“Dean?”
“Thank you, then.”
“Oh, okay.”
“Dean,” a voice was saying, but Dean couldn’t place it. “Dean.” He opened his eyes. Everything was getting blurrier and blurrier. It was hard to focus on anything for too long. It had been… how long? A week? A month? Six months? Dean couldn’t remember. He only counted time when he didn’t have it. How long until he’d get it next? How long had it been? When he had it, that all went away.
“Yeah, you could say that.”
“No, hang on. I don’t know anything about you, except a name - Castiel, right? - and that you like to pour liquids into dead guys. Who are you? What do you do? How did you know we were here for that? And where are we meeting? You didn’t even give me an address for the apartment, man!”
When they’d stopped kissing for more than a minute, and Cas had stemmed his tears, Dean put the rest of his plan into place. He laid out a blanket on the grass, and revealed an apple pie.
“Of course I showed up.”
“You’re the righteous man. Of course it worked.” Cas’ eyes began to close, but he fought off sleep long enough to say one more thing.
“Yes, Captain Winchester. He’s not as clever as one would want from the police captain, but he’s the brightest in the precinct.” Castiel was staring out the window down to the street below.
Castiel
It was Cas who approached Dean, rushing over and wrapping his arms around him. And then they were kissing. Cas was crying all over Dean, and Dean could barely move, but they were kissing, and Dean was in Cas’ arms, and he was safe, and it was okay that he was weak, because Cas was with him, and they were stronger together.
“Dean,” he told the landlord, extending a hand. Bobby took it.
“Dean, you need to stop,” he said. Dean looked confused.
“You failed him the minute you offered to help.”
“Cas,” Dean said, relieved. “It worked.”
“Thanks, Sam,” he said, not looking up from the screen. He was busy scrolling through artists and genres. Sam smiled.
“Dean, I needed to…”
“Hey, Castiel!” Charlie waved as the trench coat man - Castiel, apparently - turned around, seemingly confused and possibly a tad annoyed as to why he was being interrupted.
“Dean’s top 13 Zepp TRA XX.” Cas blushed, but he didn’t know why. Sam did, though. He knew Cas liked Dean. And he knew why Dean gave him that particular mixtape. Their parents had fallen in love to Led Zeppelin, and now Dean was giving Cas the same music. Sam smiled at the gesture.
“How do I do that?”
“You did,” Sam accused. “I told you, nothing good would come of it.”
“Well, thanks.” Cas nodded. “So…”
“Pleasure to meet you, Dean.” Bobby smiled. “Well, let’s not waste any more time out here yapping like a gaggle of old ladies. Come on in.” Dean and Castiel followed behind Bobby as he led them up the stairs and down the hall towards 2C. The apartment was nice. It had two bedrooms and a bathroom, and the kitchen was awesome - Dean enjoyed cooking before he’d been deployed, so he was happy he had a decent place to get back into practice.
“No. Stop seeing him. He’s nothing but trouble.”
“It’s a surprise.” Cas sighed and looked out the window, pouting. Dean chuckled and put a tape in the player.
“How do you know?”
“No, Cas. I need it,” he said.
“What do you want?” Dean asked.
“Yeah, where’ve you been?”
“What?” Dean’s grin faded slightly.
“I’ve found an apartment downtown that I think we can afford. I’ll meet you there tomorrow,” Castiel said. He turned to leave, having apparently forgotten about his experiment. He was nearly at the door when Dean finally got up the nerve to speak.
“Sam,” he gasped. The younger man turned around, and when his eyes locked on Castiel, it was like a switch flipped. They went ice cold.
“Yes.”
“I know.”
“No,” Dean said, but his tone was weak.
Love,
“As you wish,” he said, now inches away from Dean. He cupped the broken man’s face in his hands. Their faces moved closer together, until they were kissing. But they weren’t, not really. Not like Cas had pictured. He didn’t want this. Cas’ shoulders sagged as a little more of his strength poured into Dean. Cas tried to pull away, but Dean wanted more; he always did. Cas finally realized fully the weight of his mistakes; Dean was stronger than him now, with the grace, and Cas was too weak to do anything.
“No problem. Good night, Cas.”
“Please, Cas.” Cas looked at the human on the bed. He was broken, his eyes wide and pleading. His freckled face was sunken and pale, and there were dark bags under his eyes. His eyes. They used to be bright and full of life, vivid green like the grass and the leaves of the flowers that the honey bees loved so much. They used to shine bright with something that was uniquely Dean. Now his eyes were dull, a pale imitation of what they once were. He hated this. He never meant for it to go so far. It was supposed to be a one-time thing, for a particularly tricky hunt. But then there was another tricky hunt, and Cas didn’t see the harm in giving it to him a second time. Then there was another. After a while, it wasn’t just for tricky hunts. Dean needed more and more, he needed it to live. Cas felt guilty. He had ruined the righteous man. He had turned him into the aching, shivering copy of the righteous man. But he couldn’t let Dean down. So Cas stepped closer.
“Hey, Dean,” said his brother, nervously looking around the room.
“So, you coming?”
When they got back, Bobby scolded Castiel for being home so late, and gave Dean a look of “I can’t believe I’m going to have to keep an eye on you, too” before heading to bed. Dean and Castiel went up to their apartment. Castiel showed no signs of exhaustion, but he was remarkably quiet. Dean had spent all day listening to him ramble about the case, and he found quiet Castiel to be slightly concerning.
Dean had made Cas a mixtape. Dean’s top 13 Zepp TRA XX. Cas listened to it all the time. He listened to it at night, in the mornings, in the car, all the time. But only when he was alone. It was one of his most treasured possessions. He didn’t know why Dean had given it to him, but he loved it all the same. He was listening to it one evening in his room when Sam walked in.
“What’s going on?”
“How so?” he asked.
“Cas, I couldn’t sleep tonight.”
“You read my mind.”
“Go away, Sam.” The door opened anyway.
Keep your ‘lectric eye on me, babe…
“Charlie!” he grinned. “Long time, no see!”
“That was brave, Dean,” said Castiel after several minutes of silence.
“Cas? When did you move in with my brother?” Sam looked confused, but shook his head as if clearing his thoughts. “Whatever. I need your help.”
“Cas,” he greeted.
Dean willed himself to keep his eyes on the road. Everything was going to be fine. This was the right thing to do. Everything was going to be fine. Nothing to worry about. The music of the second song on the tape faded out. Everything was going to plan.
“I’ll consider it.”
“You need my help telling him?” Cas shook his head.
“Then what?”
“Sure, Cas. Hop in.” The boys got in the car, Dean revved the engine, and they were off.
“Friend of a friend,” she answered mysteriously, grinning. The two set off for the hospital, chatting about Charlie’s new girlfriend, current events, and other missed conversations. She refused to tell Dean anything more about his prospective roommate, and Dean was itching to learn more. Thankfully, he didn’t have to wait long, as they arrived and headed for the elevator. Charlie, much to Dean’s confusion, hit the button for the basement level. They stepped out and made their way down the hallway to a big cold room with two people in it. One was clearly a doctor, but the other - the one Charlie took him to meet, Dean was guessing - was wearing a beige trench coat and seemed to be experimenting on the corpse. They were in a morgue. They were in a morgue with a trench coat-wearing man who was currently pouring some fizzy substance into an open wound on a corpse. Great.
“See you on the other side, Cas,” he whispered, and fell asleep.
“Jimmy?” Cas wondered aloud.
“And? So what if I do?” Cas knew he was raising his voice, and that he shouldn’t, but he was not in the mood to hear this from Jimmy.
“It is written-”
“Sam,” he managed to get out. His voice was creaky and quiet. “Where… where am I?”
“Cas, I need you.”
“Is there another option, other than telling him this?”
“Don’t worry about it. You still seem real smart to me. How did you guess I was in the Pacific, anyhow?”
“Dean, you saved me. You fought against the grace and you won. But I can’t see you. For a while. I need to regain my strength, as do you.” Cas disappeared, and he fell asleep in some other place unknown to Dean, who was just starting to feel how tired he was.
“Oh. A’ight. See you tomorrow, then”

. He prayed to Cas a couple dozen times, asking him if he’d somehow taken it off, but unsurprisingly got no answer. Defeated, he went downstairs, discovered that the house was empty, and sat down on the couch. He’s still sitting. His head is hollow, he’s not sure why. He’s staring at his hands. He hasn’t moved — God knows how long it’s been. He hears keys wiggle in the front door’s lock, and his brain clears up a bit: it’s almost night out, Lisa and Ben are coming home. Did he really just spend his entire day on this couch?

It’s the exhausting type of panic. When you come out the other side, the only thing you feel up for is laying down and counting your breaths. But, with a life like his, laying down to calm his mind was a privilege reserved for the few and far between instances when the attacks would occur while he was alone, usually in the evening, and had no place to be the next morning. Yeah. Few and far between. He can count those on one hand, and fuck his life, that sounds so goddamn depressing.
) and now, looking around, there isn’t much of anything that could even count as a “nice view”. It’s flat and dry land, so... so much for his cover. He’s got a back up plan though, so it’s fine.
He takes a tentative step on the stage, then another, and another, and notices that the spotlight above him is following his every move; at least he won’t have to figure out his way around the room in the dark. Cool.

As he walks down the hall of the bunker, on his way to the main room (Sam should be there, reading one of the huge books the Men of Letters collected along the years. Surely he’s going to run out of reading material at some point, right? At the pace he’s going, he’ll have read through their entire library twice by his own birthday), Dean stops by Cas’ door. From where he’s standing, he can hear the angel is speaking softly (and guesses the intended audience is Jack) but can’t quite make out the words. He doesn’t even try resisting the temptation to knock on the door, he hasn’t been able to stop himself from gravitating towards wherever Cas is existing since Jack pulled him out of the Empty.

He’s never been lucky, and this doesn’t even count as lucky this is just… This can’t even be described. Everything about Dean unfolds and reshapes itself into something new, he’s melted away and what comes out of the new mold isn’t just Dean anymore. Cas was melted too apparently, and they were molded

He’s mastered the art of denial and he’s walking that fine line stretched above the mental abyss he’s fallen into a few times like it’s a goddamn runway. Okay, what?
’. So, Cas
The mug feels comfortably warm in Dean’s (somewhat shaky) hands, and the first sip he takes tastes like Heaven; like lazy afternoons spent lounging in his recliner, watching a good movie with Cas; like the first five minutes of waking up, before he remembers his entire life and everything he’s ever done; like driving into a sunset; like Cas’ laugh; like his best memories with Sam; like morning dew sparkling under the sunrise; it tastes like the cozy life he never lived — the life he only gets to live for a few hours, once or twice a year.
Wait. They were right. There’s less pressure here already, it takes him less of an effort to push froward, and he’s pretty sure he can see a small flame in the distance. Where there’s fire, there’s air, hallucination or no hallucination. When he finally reaches the small source of light, he realizes it’s his lighter, burning a bright fire of victory. He follows the smoke with his eyes: it’s going upwards. Tilting his head back, he’s faced with the most wonderful sight he’s ever seen in his entire life: a small, faraway hole, up in the invisible ceiling. It’s like he’s staring down a chimney. This must be it. So, with nothing else left it do, he inhales sharply, and calls out:
Cas makes a face. Confused? Concerned? Why is he doing that?? Wait. Oh right, Dean’s hand is still pressing on Cas’ arm, and Dean’s not a hundred percent sure how long it’s been. Come to think of it, he’s also
. Sam caught a glimpse of them in the rearview mirror, and in hindsight, that’s probably the reason why he decided to start ranting in the first place. To this day, he still doesn’t exactly know what that look in his brother’s eyes meant, but back then, whenever he noticed it, he’d just start talking and wouldn’t stop until the usual witty twinkle shining behind his pupils righteously replaced this strange fright that shrouded his gaze.
Suddenly, the blanket on Sam’s bed stirs, an arm sticks out from under the covers to rub his hair out of the way, then a second one appears, and Cas watches as he pushes himself off the thin mattress, his back turned away from him. The unsteady, barely awake man’s silhouette wobbles from side to side for a few seconds, until he finally opts for catching himself on his bedside table and shaking off the sleep from his shoulders.
still staring at the photo, face expressionless, so maybe that’s a good sign? Dean takes that as his cue to leave. He’s delivered his package, he’s said all he was able to blurt out, nothing more to do here. Besides, the butterflies are back and he needs to sit down or his knees might buckle. He gives Cas a quick smile and nod and starts walking (more like jogging) down the hall.

Letting out a breath himself (didn’t realize he was holding it actually), Dean feels relief course through his body. The panic left, there’s only basic parental worry now. And love. A whole lotta love.

He’s already halfway to his room when he hears Cas call out his name. There’s something… soft (?) in the way Cas said it. Oh c'mon, no that can’t be right, the butterflies must’ve fluttered to his ears or his brain or something. Still, when he turns around, the look he sees on Cas’ face reflects that exact same sweetness. Like a marshmallow, except with a face and a lot more sentient.

There’s an urge buried in his stomach, he even knows exactly what it is, but he’s got no intention of acknowledging its existence. Instead, he lets go. What was that in Cas’ eyes? He could swear it was… A reflection of the same defeat? Nah. Couldn’t be. Just his brain playing tricks on him, because reasons.

The moment Sam finished sewing his brother up, Cas jumped in his place and gently wrapped white cloths around Dean’s torso, then zipped open the inert man’s duffle-bag, from which he pulled out a random t-shirt. After a few seconds of cautious maneuvering around his bandaging work, he’d managed to render Dean ‘decent’ again.

When he opens the door, the sight that greets him is enough to make his heart burst. Jack is straddling Cas’ shoulders, while Cas is sitting cross-legged on the floor next to his (meticulously made, sheets straighter than a ruler) bed. They’re both smiling brightly and were apparently in the middle of a terribly fun pretense-game, something about Jack being a cowboy and Cas a talking horse (
cuckoo?”
’s how you deal with someone who just got an anvil dropped on their head, see? If this was any other day, Sam would verbally thank Cas, but right now he’s tired and wants to sleep and trying to fake passing out in an attempt to escape this conversation not only sounds just about marvelous at the moment, but is also starting to become a growing possibility for his next course of action.
“Oh.” Cas just says, taking the picture slowly from Dean’s hand, with the same reverence Dean guesses he’d have if he was holding the bones of Saint Peter.
“Cas.” His heart misses a beat, how could he forget?
hours since a frantic Cas materialized into the room, (rudely) interrupting Sam’s quiet research, carrying what looked like a very bloody, life-sized ragdoll princess-style. Which actually turned out to be Dean.
“He’s not going to hold up his end of the deal.” Cas said into Dean’s shoulder.
From around the corner of the bunker he heard Dean say, “Shit! He knows!”
The chilly air was calming, at least. The slight breeze did little to shove away all that was bothering Dean, but at least he didn’t feel as stuffed up and cramped as he did in the Men Of Letters bunker with Sam, or in a pub surrounded by nothing but other depressed man whores with drinking problems who were all too busy yapping their problems to the hot bartender to actually get their lives together. Not that Dean was any better than them. The fact that he had driven off from one of the few people who knew him best just for a six pack was proof of that.
“Fuck off!”
“Let’s just… clean this up?” He nodded to the chaos of books that had been heaved across the floor.
“We both know that’s a lie.” Before Dean could argue, Cas pushed his almost empty pack of beers to the side and hopped up next to him. “I know what you were doing here.”
“Dean, no.” Cas said from behind him. He ignored him.
Cas knew exactly what to do.
“Yeah, we do. We’ve read those books a million times.” Sam carried all the books he could fit in his arms back to the library. When he came back he saw Dean staring solemnly at the floor. Cas wasn’t sure if Sam noticed, but Dean had started drumming his fingers on the wooden surface of the desk once again. “Dean…?”
Sadly, without the insane barking coming from his younger brother to distract him, Dean was thinking more than he had wanted to. He had come out here to relax and get himself together, not become a sad little crap. He had almost gone to a bar to drink his worries away, but he knew that that was the first place Sam would have looked for him. He was an alcoholic, not stupid. So instead, he drove to his private clearing and drank there.
“You stopped calling, that’s why.”
“Cas…” he said, his voice entirely forlorn. Cas had never seen that look on Dean’s face before. It was pained, certainly, but it was deeper than that. It was brimful with pure misery. He had his mouth slightly open, like he had a million words to say but either didn’t know how to say them or just couldn’t bring himself too. His eyes weren’t hopeless and dull, but they weren’t their usually sparkling green. They were intensely focused on Cas’s other face, and he just couldn’t figure out what they were saying. “I can’t lose you again, and not like this. I can’t let it just be some stupid fucking vampire that did you in forever.”
The last thing he remembered was sneaking up on a broken down cabin where there was a pack of werewolves hiding out. Somewhere along the way he must have been beaten pretty horribly if the next moment he woke up was this. Castiel had been knocked out in the figurative sense that he was unconscious, but never in the sense that he was literally shoved out of his own body by a simple blow to the head. This was nothing like exorcisms or leaving a vessel. When Cas looked down he saw his vessel, and he would have sworn it was just him if it weren’t for the fact that when he looked up he could once again see himself lying down.
“Not protecting Sammy better, letting down Dad…” he began. This was near routine for him. It was like Dean had a record player in his mind that was set on loop, constantly reminding him of everything he’d done wrong in his entire life. But he rarely talked along to it out loud. Usually he kept it all within the confines of his own mind, to silently agree with the record. “Dragging Sam back into hunting, getting him killed. Getting Dad killed. And Ellen, Jo… Bobby, Sammy again.”
But his heart rate and gun dropped when he saw who was behind him. The familiar sight of the brunette in a trench coat and blue tie as bright as his eyes was plenty enough to calm Dean down a little bit.
“At least let me get you a towel for it?” he suggested, already pulling himself to his feet and towards the bathroom. “ And lay down maybe?”
Castiel had been in a lot of weird, uncomfortable situations. Like the time Gabriel tried to convince him that he was actually an adopted human and that his wings are fake, or the time Dean tried to feed him dog food, or most of all the time that he found Claire curled up under the couch crying hysterically to a song about faking your death because “that’s exactly what they did!”
Dean took the entire box of nachos and held it close to him, closing himself off. He wasn’t pouting anymore, and he didn’t look childish. He looked almost sad. The nachos, however, looked delicious, and from the way Dean was stuffing them down his throat, Cas would have to act fast if he wanted anything for himself. He reached over quickly and almost stole a few, but Dean tried to move them away. In the end, Cas ended up knocking the box of nachos away. They went flying, getting all over the front seats of the impala.
At least Dean was having a good time. Cas looked over to where his friend was. He was dancing up against a girl, beer in hand, clearly pleased with his current situation. It would be no surprise if Dean forgot about Cas when he decided to drive him and his dance partner to the nearest vacant motel room to spend the night. Again.
Yeah.
Dean hovered right above Castiel, completely silent. No one had anything to say. Dean raised his fingers to Cas’ chin, tilting it up so that they were kissing.
Cas stepped up onto his toes and pressed his lips against Dean’s for no more than a second. He pulled away with a small smile on his face.
As much as the angel loved kissing Dean, he pulled away when he felt his tie getting loosened.
“We are talking about the same reason, right?” Dean with a chuckle. He slowly walked back to where Cas stood, still keeping a fair distance.
“He is, I’ll make sure he does.” Dean reassured him. “And you’ll know I’m fine because I’ll be thinking about you the whole time.”
“I can hear you, Dean, I need you to hear me!” Cas walked over to him.
Cas would have told Sam that he felt far from fine, but after spending the entire first day shouting and trying to wreck auditory havoc, he’d learned that no one could hear him. Dean reluctantly left the room and got food, but brought his plate and beer with him, because he “wanted to be there when Cas woke up.”
Cas spent the first day trying to shout at everyone in the entire bunker to let them know he was sort of awake. No one could hear him. If it weren’t for the fact that he didn’t have a corporeal form at the moment, he would probably find his throat aching or his voice to be lost after all the shouting.
They kept kissing, Dean dropping Cas’ wrist so he could hold his head with both of his hands. Cas, personally, had never felt better. He couldn’t even remember how long he had been thinking about doing this, Dean’s lips against his. Everything outside of the impala was unimportant to them. Cas was too busy relishing in the joy of his years of wishing finally coming true- Dean was too busy taking Cas’ coat off of him and tossing it in the backseat once again.
“Dean, you and I have both been knocked out for over a week at a time,” he had said cooly. It was the evening of the second day, and Dean had hardly left his room. Sam had walked in to find his brother pacing anxiously, glancing back at Castiel every other second.
“Shit!” Dean cursed, glaring down at the nacho cheese that had gotten all over him. He reached over across Cas to the glove compartment in search of something to clean up the mess, knocking down both the beers in the process. “Great... “
“He was hit on the back of the neck, Sammy, not chanted at!” Dean raised his voice, and Sam flinched. “He would be back by now if he was exorcised…”
“I did not start a fight!” he snapped back, curling up into a little pout. He was like an angry little child who’d just been told he couldn’t get candy because he’d hit another kid. Stubborn and prideful. Dammit, it was adorable.
Cas sprang up, gasping for air. When he came to his senses, he was sitting on Dean’s bed, and this time he was actually in his body.
“I said I don’t regret you.” The angel repeated himself. “It would be hypocritical of me if I thought that was a reason to.”
“Dean, no.” he said shyly, readjusting the blue neck tie.
“I don’t know.” said Cas as he stood up.
The splotches were up to his neck now, and he officially had only half a body. Dematerializing, it had a distinct feeling of pins and needles. He didn’t have any energy to futilely respond to Dean’s pleas. He felt like someone was tugging on his head but he couldn’t budge.
The fifth day, Cas began to wonder if he really was a ghost. He spent the day trying to summon the energy to push things over- anything. The random knick knacks on Dean’s dresser, the salt shakers in the kitchen, even the pillow propping his (real) head up, but nothing seemed to work. When he tried to touch anything, his hand would become transparent, fading back to opaque a few seconds after he would move his hand away. By seven that evening he felt just the same as before, if not a bit more frustrated at the situation. No reaper had ever come for him, and the Empty was nowhere in sight. At least he knew he wasn’t dead.
Dean, of course, didn’t hear a word. He was still sitting at the desk, pouring over books about ghosts. He looked like he was going to pass out at any second.
And that was it.
He sighed. Another bottle empty and he had no idea where it had gone. Soon enough Dean would have to either go drive himself to get another few packs, or just pass out in the car and wait until morning to return to the bunker. Not like he wasn’t used to sleeping alone in the impala. He was more than used to it. Didn’t mean Dean didn’t wish he could have someone with him, to at least keep him warm until he was sober enough to return to his brother and find another job or hunt, or stop another ‘End Of Days’.
“Dean…” Cas mumbled. “I love you.”
“Cas, not now.” Dean shook his head. He clenched his fists, trying to summon up the courage to say what he needed to say.
“Yeah, I… I thought I was too,” Cas looked back down at his hands just to double check. He still seemed safe. “I guess I’m… wait.”
“Dean,” Sam said when he pushed the food aside to make room for another book. “Give it a rest, you know there’s nothing in there.”
“I’m back,” he said, barely believing it, as he looked down at his hand to make sure it was true. It was.
Cas didn’t let go. He squinted at Dean, as if he squinted just enough, he would be able to read Dean’s thoughts without his permission. Dean sighed. May as well give him what he wanted.
But in all of his millions of years of living, he had never been put in a situation where he was standing in a bedroom staring down at his own body. He’d honestly never expected it to happen and, naturally, had never prepared himself for it.
He heard Castiel sniff. Looking back, Castiel’s sleeve was practically shoved up his entire nose, and totally drenched in blood.
He… well his body, was lying down stiffly in Dean’s bed. Yes, Dean’s bed. It wasn’t that weird to him when Dean had carried Cas to his bedroom without a second thought since he was in there almost every night while Dean slept. Sam had thought it was odd but Dean had snapped at him to go find something to help before he could ask more questions.

Thank you for putting these beautiful translations out in the world, they were very useful for my Destiel fanfiction.

He always hid it from Sam but he’s pretty sure he knew something, because whenever Dean would have one of those fun anxiety parties, his little brother always had a new story to tell, a new joke, a new fun fact to explain. Dean’s pretty sure he was doing his best to distract him, and even if he never said it, he loved him so much for trying.
“Alright, last sign said the exit’s in a mile, we’re almost there.” Sam mentions, the corner of his mouth slightly raised, probably amused by Dean’s reluctance to use his phone the way he does.
***************************
Sam is ripped away from his memories when he sees Dean starting to stomp away towards the gas station, apparently trying to push as much frustration in his every step as he’s able, punching all his grievances into the asphalt under his heavy boots, as if the poor road was the one responsible for the diner having strange opening hours. Sam gives Cas a light shrug; the angel seems to be thinking roughly the same thing. Dean on an empty stomach is something you simply

He closes the toilet’s lid, sits down, rubs his eyes, buries his face in his hands, then buries himself inside his own subconscious, the same way he’d done a thousand times during his childhood and teenage years.

He simply smiled at her, then disappeared.

He’s a few minutes away from the motel, he’ll probably feel better once his stomach stops growling, and once he’s found some information about the black-eyed bastard called ‘Orthon’ who chose today of all days to sprinkle in more chaos into their lives. Definitely. These two things will most

After some time (he’s got no clue how long), he reluctantly drags himself out of his otherworldly fantasy, because he knows Cas is most assuredly waiting (impatiently) for his return, just so he can keep harassing him with questions he doesn’t have the heart to answer.
Starting up the car and getting back on the highway, Sam glances to his right, expecting to see his brother brooding and staring out the windshield. Instead, he sees Dean give Cas a quick smile, to which the angel responds with a head tilt and furrowed brows. It’s not just a familiar movement, it’s a promise, something along the lines of ‘

Maybe? They came into the old decrepit house together, so he must surely still be there. That’s a logical assumption. Yeah. Time to get back up, this bitch of an old dead crone isn’t gonna kill herself. If only.

Most of the poem is mine, but between every 8 verses, I added four sets of 4 verses that I handpicked from other poems (you'll notice them, I put them in quotation marks, they're shorter, and the punctuation changes). In order, the poems I chose are:

too. Before meeting Jess, Sam had always thought that someone being ‘driven’ necessarily equated to a broken soul, like his father’s. And yet, here was this light, this bright young fire, bursting through her heart, and nothing about her was broken, the flames hadn’t burned her, they’d simply pushed her forward. She wasn’t perfect, of course, but she always tried to be Good. Good for (and to) herself, and for (and to) others.

’ to you every time.” Then, pushing the last nail into the coffin of Dean’s ego, he adds “Besides, you’re also the one who asked 6 times in a row if we should return to the bunker or at least stop at a motel, and yes, Sam, I counted.” The fallen angel’s grin was kept hidden during his entire speech, but it’s visibly hard for him to keep it under control now.

In case you didn't see it in the tags: there's a lot of anxiety in this. There will be a lot of anxiety. A shit ton. In all the Dean chapters.

It’s like the beating is happening in the background, like he’s on a wide stage in front of an audience, under a bright spotlight, for everyone to see and mock and point their fingers at. He feels cold and hot and numb and alone and the stage under his feet (or his knees, he’s not sure) is slippery, and he keeps falling. Over and over and

He’d channel soothing Grace all the way to Dean’s soul, then he’d paint calming images of Heaven over the nightmare’s grim flashes. That usually did the trick. He knew he couldn’t be there for every bad dream, but he endeavored to make up for all the ones he missed by helping with the ones he witnessed.
Once they’ve carefully watched enough of Jack’s tiny breaths, Dean heads back outside and sees Cas close the door. And there it is again, the panic.
“Alright,

immediately.
“Aha! Almost there!” Dean gushes excitedly, a kid’s smile spreading fast over his face.
’. And that’s enough for Dean’s fear (see, irrational, gone as fast as it came) to wither away. It’ll be back, though; Dean knows that from experience. If he doesn’t check up on Jack to watch him breathe within the next 20 minutes, the panic will set in again. It’s inconvenient, really. Specifically when he’s out on a hunt.
“My - my name is Dean,” he called after him, though he wasn’t sure if Castiel heard him or not.
“So, Cas, how about that murder uptown?” Bobby said. “I saw it in the paper. Looked like your kind of gig.”
“Dean,” he pleaded. He didn’t want to die. Dean wouldn’t listen.
“I will ‘go get ‘em’, Jimmy.” Cas, feeling more confident than usual, left the library and hurried down the hall to Dean’s room. He knocked on the door and was relieved to find Dean still awake, if a little groggy. He opened the door, already in his pajamas.
“Alright, then. We can get started now, if you want.”
“Because. I need to focus on my work. And, while you may have some uses, ultimately I must remain vigilant and alert to the task at hand.”
P.S. I hope you enjoy the mixtape. Sam helped me make it.
“Hey,” Dean said, eyes softening. “I, uh… I felt something, too. And I’ve never felt that way before, either - well, about a man, anyway. Maybe we can figure this out together?” Cas gave a tentative smile.
“I want to make him a… a mixtape. Of music.”
“Castiel?” Dean approached him, waving amicably. “It’s me. Dean. From yesterday.”
“Castiel,” he spat.
“And what would that be?”
The boys spent the next few hours recording and playing back songs until the mixtape was ready. Cas carefully and neatly wrote the track list on a card and slipped it inside the case. On the side of the tape he simply wrote, ‘Hello, Dean’. He put the mixtape into a small box. There was just one thing left to do. Sam, having given all the help necessary, left Cas’ room with a smile and a shoulder squeeze. Cas sat at his desk and took out a clean sheet of paper and a pen. He tapped the end of the pen against the wood while he thought of what to say.
“It’s from Cas.” Sam held out a small box, wrapped in paper and tied with a ribbon. “I’ll leave you alone now.” Sam left the room as Dean stared blankly at the gift. There was a tag that read, ‘To Dean. Cas.’ Nothing more. He put the box in the drawer of his nightstand and tried not to think about it. But over the next few days, the box occupied most of his thoughts. He wondered what was inside it. There was no point, though. Cas was gone. Nothing in a box that big could bring him back. But Dean had to know. So one night, he opened the drawer and took out the present. He undid the ribbon carefully, wanting to preserve everything from Cas. He carefully peeled back the wrapping and opened the box. Inside was a mixtape, labeled ‘Hello, Dean’, and a folded piece of paper. Dean flipped the tape over to look at the track list before hesitantly putting it into the tape player. He unfolded the piece of paper and read it as the first song clicked on.
Hello, Dean.
“No,” Cas said. He backed away slowly. “Dean, you don’t need it. You’re the righteous man.”
“It was simple. Your haircut and posture give away the armed forces immediately. Your tan suggests somewhere sunny. You have a typical marine tattoo, the one with the bird, that I can just make out under your t-shirt. The rock on one of your necklaces is a volcanic rock, suggesting an island. Pacific.”
“Good night, Dean.” Cas watched as Dean shuffled out of the library and down to his room. Cas sighed and turned back to his book.
“You don’t understand, Sammy.”
“Yes, I want him.”
Cas didn’t know where he was. The world was dim and muted around him. He could hear two men talking, and slowly crawled towards their voices. He knew these men.
“Not it. You.”
“Cas, no. No, no, no, Cas.” He hurried over, but Sam stepped between them.
“When?”
“Hello, Dean.”
“Here you go. To download playlists and albums, just hit that little arrow there.” Cas nodded in understanding.
“Shut up,” said Cas, before remembering only he could hear Jimmy.
“Nothing. I just felt like some Bowie tonight.” Dean’s left foot started bouncing nervously.
“Stronger? I found you sprawled on the floor, unconscious. You had no idea what was going on.”
When I first pulled you out of Hell, I was an obedient, if occasionally doubtful soldier for a father I’d never met. But you changed that. You changed me. You taught me about humanity, about loyalty and friendship, but most of all, you taught me about love. You don’t think you’re worthy of love. I know that. But just because you can’t see that, doesn’t mean I can’t. You’re brave, and selfless, and kind, and funny, and generous. You love movies and pie and cheeseburgers. You love Sam, and you love Jack. You love music, and your car. You love making references to things nobody’s heard of. You save the world, no matter how many times the world fails you. You blush when someone says something nice to you, and grin when you tell a joke. You fidget when you’re embarrassed, and dance when your favorite songs come on. You sing along, whether or not you know the words (though you almost always know them all). You know everything there is to know about cowboys and rock music. You love everyone and everything, and there is no limit to what you’d do for those you love. And you taught me that.
Okay, he’s got privacy now, and Cas’ burning stare can’t reach him anymore, time to hatch up a plan. An excuse. A lie.
At any other moment in time, Dean would probably take offense at that, but he’s got a picture to take and a sun that’s rapidly moving away, so he files the annoyance for a later date. Unlocking his phone, he flashes Cas a smirk and eyes him up and down (really? Did you
