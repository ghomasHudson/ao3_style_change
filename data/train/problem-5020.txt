“Right,” she said, cheerfully. “I’ve got a couple of teddy bears here, one green rabbit - don’t ask me why it’s green, it just is, a couple of those adult colouring books … uh, colouring books for adults rather than dodgy pictures.. and some pens, and a large cop car. It’s all the stuff we were planning to donate a while back and forgot. Most of it’s from weird Christmas lucky dip things. I’m not normally a bunny girl.”
Balthazar looked thoughtful as Dean looked away from him in embarrassment, and then looked up at Cas again in silent query. Dean let out a soft cry of pain-pleasure as Castiel’s next thrust was powerful enough to shove him forward, a beautiful and yet agonising thrust, and his bewildered eyes looked back at Balthazar in dazed confusion on what just happened.
.” Sam stared at Cas critically, and reached across to touch him. Dean all but hissed, a noise he didn’t even know he could make and glared across at the pain in the ass that represented his brother. For fuck sake, they wouldn’t have even tried to go near the damned bandstand if he hadn’t suggested it!
“In time.”
Was that a yes? Castiel didn’t know. A look of indecision crossed Dean’s face which was a surprise in itself. The angel had assumed that Dean had some very clear ideas.
Annie had been watching them from the corner of the kitchen, sipping from a can of diet coke that was another thing that Jody didn’t really approve of for breakfast but thought that was the least of her problems.
“Yes.” Castiel provided that answer helpfully. The witch eyed him and threw a few more leaves into a pot.
“Right, we’re going to have a game in the yard, okay? Possibly some ball throwing-,” Or possibly not; their hand-eye coordination was definitely not as good as their passion for it. “..or running around, bit of training-
. I’ll look at him. But I make no promises, and quite frankly your addiction to them is getting a little worrying.”
“He’s not dying, he’s just a bit muddy,” Jody soothed them both and pulled out a tissue that she thankfully had in her pocket. “I’m going to press this here and then we’ll get you all cleaned up, okay Sam?”
And him? Castiel made a mental note to send Sam a text to confirm that the water, finally, was fixed.
“I don’t think so.”
“Cas, you gotta start talking normally. You sound like something out of Pride and Prejudice.” Dean grumbled. Cas gave a small shrug, having no idea what either pride or prejudice had to do with the conversation but felt it was probably a minor issue.
Everywhere Dean looked were animated faces, their eyes twinkling in the lights. He grinned to himself and his hand automatically reached for Cas’, squeezing it happily. He noticed that Cas didn’t let said hand go afterward, but Dean wasn’t about to complain about that. Sure, they haven’t yet been able to do the rolling around in the bed that he’d hoped for, but Cas
“I was about to have a drink. You look like you could do with one,” Jody advised, making her way across to the couch. Carefully placing Sam down on one end, she covered him with a small blanket normally used for tv watching snuggle ups and surveyed him fondly. So small. Reminded her of another time, another baby. Jody gently stroked over his hair before moving back to her original spot and finding another glass for Castiel. It felt as though they’d both need it.
“There were a few marks, very ordinary,” he said slowly. “Do you have a pad of paper? If there is a wire then we would not want the rest of the community to be .. uh, zapped.”
“Dean, are you sure you don’t want to get some rest?”
“She is normally bribeable in some form,” Castiel replied solemnly. The pen tapped the desk thoughtfully.
“And Dean’s response to your words?”
“I know you know about sex, Cas. Don’t do this to me.”
“....wha..?” He knew he was wide eyed but he didn’t care. Where was his angel?
“You’re objecting to endurance based sex?” Castiel looked at him in surprise.
his friend.
“Potentially.
“Or how about you fuck off and leave me with my husband?” Dean snapped back. “We don’t need you, Sam. We’ll be fine.”
And with that she was gone.
Castiel considered that. Sam was an excellent Dean interpreter. Unfortunately, Sam was also almost guaranteed to rile Dean up, and apparently this thought was a little too clear on his face as Sam huffed a soft laugh and shrugged.
“I believe so.” he said, a little grimly.
He didn’t need to look at the door to know that voice. Dean froze, eyes staring at Balthazar as he almost begged the angel to say it was one of his jokes and that his brother was still sleeping, but said angel was looking a little wary himself as he slowly lowered the paper.
Sam growled softly and shook his head, taking the opportunity for his longer hair to cover his eyes. “No. It’s all fine.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Let me guess. It’s a hall and it’s pretty big?”
There was another thrust from Cas, deeper and harder and man, hitting that sweet, sweet spot and fuck, this wasn’t fair, they were clearly ganging up on him. Dean whined against the finger, unable to stop the glare turning into something more pleading, and Balthazar’s smile grew gentler. Dean finally released him, a gasp of air as he did so and feeling like someone had beaten him over the head with a baseball bat. His need was so large it was god near overwhelming but it was reaching a point and not going any further, and Dean whined again in confusion. Had to come, he
At any other time he’d probably have raged a bit about that, but here and now he merely grinned and lifted his hips a little higher, an invitation that the angel was happy to take. Their gazes met again as Castiel lined up and Dean felt the broad tip of the angel’s cock against his hole, questioning, confirming, confident.
“A good time?” Dean repeated, his eyebrows rising briefly before he laughed. “C’mon, live a little Cas! We have time. You’re keen, I’m keen and there’s a really big bed
Castiel had been concerned for Dean since he arrived, and truth be told, some time before that. However, the older Winchester’s current condition was truly worrying. Dean was angry and unpredictable, but these were almost part of his general personality. No, what was truly concerning was the fear that lingered behind that anger, the look in Dean’s eye that spoke a little too clearly of an underlying issue. And Dean’s underlying issues could be .. intensive.
. And this was becoming ridiculous. Castiel’s jaw tightened, stepping forward as the brothers glared at each other from inches away in their own little territorial world of teeth and fury and pain.
. It was a difficult time, made even more difficult as Dean shifted every so often with another little movement and the adorable squeaky noise that Castiel had never heard from him before.
Although his strength was good enough to stop rogue howls, it was having more difficulty when it came to his growing need, a painful throb throughout him that kept building at each hard thrust. Dean bit his lip hard and found it wanting as a technique to keep his body under control. But he couldn’t, had to keep going but man, it was hard, and looking up at Cas wasn’t helping matters either. He’d thought the man attractive before, albeit in the privacy of his own head and not to be repeated. Now, with a faint sheen of sweat on his brow and a vivid blue gaze that could give Superman’s lasers a run for their money, he was pretty much irresistible.
“So you know how to fix him, right?” Dean tried to keep the aggression out of his voice, and thankfully - kinda - his anxiety was beginning to slip through. The angel lifted his head a little, eyed Dean again, and then gave a careless shrug.
day?”
And even now as he was saying it he was aware of how poor the excuse sounded. They could have done
How humans managed to live like this was a testament to their strength and stubborn determination. And, to a certain extent, to their faintly masochist nature. This was
“Okay, okay, jesus Sam, untwist the panties.” Dean eyed him again before grumbling softly and then bringing the engine to life.
“His behaviour is a little questionable.” Castiel glanced back toward the door, uncertain how to describe the current situation without inadvertently blowing their cover. He hesitated, and pushed on. “He woke up this morning and tried to creep out of the room as though not trying to wake me up which was .. curious. Since that point he seems to be happier, although that’s based on the number of kisses he has already given me.”
“Mm.”
Technically, Castiel wasn’t talking but Dean didn’t really need him to. He was close,
bad at it. Epic levels of bad. Flirting, sure, but nothing that’s actually .. y’know important.” Dean was still staring ahead which was the safest place to look.
Dean frowned. “Gonna need more detail than that, Cas.”
She was right. Dean was still watching Cas with an unreadable expression, and Cas didn’t seem much better. Sam had released the intensity of his grip but hadn’t really moved away, and the warmth of his body was a comfort that Jody welcomed. The witch scanned them all before rolling her eyes and moving briskly toward the door.
It was likely that his thoughts had managed to show on his features as Dean looked curiously at him and then sat up a little more, his cocky grin turning thoughtful.
“People who can vanish.” Dean translated. “Cheerful stuff.”
“I’d be willing to put money on it if it’s the surge I think it is.”
He was married? He didn’t feel married. Dean’s gaze fell on the front garden and focused on the picket fence. A white picket fence. With a little white house, on a little street, with families around him and
“Uh. Guilty.”
More silence. They had extensive supplies.
remember it? The situation was pretty damned typical, unusual deaths, weird folk, rumour and suspicions. The solution? Not so typical. Sure, it was a cover story, and sure, they’d poke around and find out stuff and then set things on fire that needed to be on fire, but most of their cover stories did not involve pretending to be married, and they certainly didn’t involve him pretending to be married with Cas.
“I don’t understand,” Castiel said slowly, and suddenly found a new reason to stiffen in multiple ways as Dean’s hand rose slightly to slowly stroke over his stomach. Dean rolled slightly on his side, able to finally look Cas in the eye, and the expression the angel could see was the determined, ‘so-fight-me’ one that normally showed up whenever Dean was about to do something extremely brave, foolish and lifespan limiting.
“C’mon, Sammy, wake up,” he pleaded softly, but his words clearly weren’t making any difference whatsoever and now he was feeling the edges of panic creep in. Trouble was, he didn’t even know that the standard medicine would do much better either. This wasn’t a stab wound or a gunshot or a strangulation or any other form of typical injury, this was part hex, part curse, part fucked up weird shit, and no doctor on Earth was going to understand the chaos that was currently his little brother’s body.
He pushed himself up from the mud and the leaves and the darkness and wiped the mud from his brow with the back of his arm wearily as Dean stared sightlessly toward the burning bandstand. The wood seemed to be screaming as it burned, popping and crackling as old wood and paint met with heat, and a slow, long song of outrage as it died. Whatever runes it had were long gone, and so was the fantasy.
Blinking, still sleepy, he looked up into a brighter room where Balthazar had opened the blinds and allowed some of the light to filter through from the new day. The candles had gone and so had the floor pattern, the disco ball still slowly rotating and sending little mirrored flashes across the room. Balthazar himself was settled in a padded armchair set in the corner, reading a newspaper with a glass of something seemingly alcoholic sitting next to him on a table. Castiel, of course, was still wrapped around him protectively, and Dean enjoyed that sensation for a moment before looking back at Balthazar warily.
“Mm.”
“C’mon, c’mon, c’mon,” he muttered as he prowled around the room for something,
That made even less sense. “Why not?”
“Are you willing?” Castiel breathed softly. Dean almost laughed. Or cried. Or something wet, anyway.
“This is both horrendous and adorable at the same time.” she rubbed her forehead with a hand. “And Cas? You look pretty… whatever the polite term for shit is. Pretty sure you could do with a rest as well before you start talking to questionable contacts.”
It was also a fair assessment.
“That’s it,” he breathed. “Good boy. Just relax..,”
“It’s okay, Dean. Castiel is just going to get some supplies,” she said soothingly. “I need you here with me.”
to this guy. And could he remember any of it? Fuck, no. But .. well, as guys went, he was good. He was
“Is that voice a claim for parentage?”
“Oh, fuck, sorry-,”
“I’m fine! Yes, I’m fine, everything is good, I just fancied a bit of healthy living, okay?” Dean raised his hands in surrender. “Is that a bad thing?”
“C’mon, Cas.” Dean nipped and sucked and growled at Cas’ neck as he ground his body against him, a squirming, eager, so very hard form. “Misbehave for once.”
“Exactly. No ruffling feathers, no ‘just saying’ comments, no suggestions of strip joints or anything else. As far as anyone knows, you’re both a nice, normal, homosexual couple. Okay?”
have those memories and full understanding,” Castiel paused before fixing Dean with a steady look of his own. “… would you still be happy to carry those invitations out or do we forget anything occurred?”
But he had to be steady.
“So… how does this work?” Dean glanced up at him, and there was the faint trace of hope in the other man’s eyes that seemed to do strange things to Castiel’s insides. The angel forced himself to focus. Now was not the time to consider how close Dean’s thigh was to his own, nor the line of Dean’s body now he was lying on his side, a beautiful curve from shoulder down to waist and back on the firm muscle of his hip.
“Okay. Let’s do this.” The determination was back again, Dean’s voice deep, husky and clearly not planning to take no for an answer. Castiel was curious what ‘this’ would entail. From the look of challenge that was attempting to hide tension on Dean’s face, so was he.
“Balthazar, I appreciate your help in this but if you continue to taunt Dean then I will be upset.”
“Yeah. Despite Dean’s opinion, I’m not that unobservant. I know you love him, and he loves you. No judgement on my side, honest. I think you guys work together well, and you make him all relaxed.” Sam seemed to be happily encased within an alternative reality timeline, and Castiel was struggling to bring it back again to his own understanding.
“Guys. Ready and waiting.” he waggled his ass a little pointedly. “C’mon!”
Castiel hesitated, uncertain of the question. “Morally?”
For a short time there was nothing but the soft, breathless gasps between them as they struggled to regain both sanity and strength. Dean had collapsed a little more against Castiel after climaxing, his face nestled in the crook of the angel’s neck and his hand resting lightly against his chest, and Castiel had little idea whether the elder Winchester was fully awake after his exertions. Not that this mattered, of course. The soft, happy little noises were all he needed, Dean curling up as best he could given the circumstances.
“Oh.” Jody looked back at Dean who was still trying to escape Castiel’s grasp. The small boy suddenly realised he had an audience and brightened.
“Stay out of this, Cas.” Dean growled softly, his eyes never moving from his brother. Sam growled back, and then hissed in pain as Dean twisted his wrist a little more. Castiel frowned harder. No. This was not happening.
me information, so what am I supposed to do here?!” Dean grumbled, rolling onto his back but keeping his body pressed up against Castiel’s form as though they were glued in place. One of Dean’s hands was touching lightly against the angel’s thigh, and that delicate touch alone was enough for a shiver of pleasure to run down his body.
Finally darkened eyes turned to him hungrily.
“What’s the chocolate brown stuff?” she asked, curiously.
“Yeah, okay. But we talk about this after the ceremony today, right?”
“I am sorry, Dean. I did not mean to startle you.”
Dean groaned internally. This job was probably going to kill him, and definitely not in a way he’d ever anticipated.
“Balthazar,” Cas’ voice behind him, rough and faintly breathless but definitely a warning. There was a soft noise of amusement from the angel in question.
, and he was having to bite his tongue to stop from making a damned angel pissy.
good at fucking stuff up.” Dean said finally, and mostly to the doorframe.
The yard went better than expected. Balls and any other missile were confirmed as a bad idea, but the ‘training’ was popular, an activity that seemed to be a game of tag with very specialised rules to evade capture. Whoever was ‘it’ was either a vampire or werewolf, albeit much slower ones to allow them a chance to escape; neither of the boys was quite so fast without sharp corners to dodge around.
Castiel needed no encouragement but these words were almost certainly not for either of them, instinctual ones that allowed Dean to say something, anything, as his mind focused on what was happening. Their pleasure was building with each thrust, harder, almost painful, an intense sensation and there was another soft cry as he sank into him again, over and over.
From that point on it was more chaotic than even Castiel had anticipated. Their mouths met again, shyly at first before delving into something hungrier, Dean falling on him like a ravenous, half starved wolf and Castiel not having either the heart or the inclination to dissuade him from his focus. His hands slid across Dean’s muscled back, nails instinctively raking down soft firm skin as their embrace continued with the soft noises of hungry beasts.
need fixing?” Balthazar refilled his glass without bothering with the human niceties of reaching for bottles, the glass simply turning from empty to full in a blink of an eye.
Whining softly again, Dean bit his lip and tried to count backward just in case he came immediately. Cas’ tongue was indecent, and where the hell had the angel picked up his handling techniques? There had been no hesitation, Castiel finding a rhythm damned quickly and Dean made another pleading noise at the back of his throat that wasn’t even sure what it was asking for.
More silence added to an already full room. Castiel was at a loss. Should he offer support? A hug? Leave and let Sam come to pick up the pieces of his lost brother? He knew exactly what he wished to do, but wants were not always the same as shoulds.
“Duly noted,” Jody said dryly, but at least it was going better than she’d expected. Just needed Annie on board and they stood a chance of keeping the pair of boys under vague control. Claire stood back up and watched them for a moment longer, clearly thinking.
For a little while they stared at the doorway as though expecting it to produce some type of show, Dean’s hands now clasped together and balanced a little on his knees as he stared forward sightlessly.
“I am fine, Dean. You should get some rest though,” he said gently.
“And I appreciate it.” Castiel replied, solemnly. Balthazar rolled his eyes.
look like you’ve randomly stolen some farmer’s washing.” Balthazar glanced across to Castiel. “And
He squeezed Cas’ hand again and looked at his eyes hopefully, but Cas’ expression was unreadable. Dean was about to say something further when the leaders moved to the bandstand and one stepped forward. The crowd surrounded the bandstand expectantly, filling every little spot that they could as they watched.
Finally it was agreed. And needless to say, Castiel was asleep in less than five minutes.
“I’ll come speak to you later on, okay? You go in, get some food in you, sit down. You poor love!”
Did that make him the wolf? He hoped not.
“Fuck sake, are you two
“Demons were hunting them for years and all they actually needed was to feed them cookies,” Jody noted. “She’s better with kids than I thought. So, you stay overnight and then head off in the morning, yes? Word of warning - there isn’t a ‘no’ option.”
“Uh. Were you guys all naked a few moments ago?” he said cautiously.
Castiel thought about that comparison. “Are sharks in swimming pools good?”
Both boys had stopped to listen, and looked bemused when Claire gave them both pillows.
“Stop. I’ve got this handled.” Hard, angry, resolute. Sam stopped but his expression grew darker as he looked back at him.
” Cas’ voice was commanding, his blue eyes even more vivid as he stared at him in concern from inches away. Dean stared at him in confusion, then glanced over his shoulder where the crowds were already moving, some beginning to scream, the leader down with a dark pool slowly appearing near him and there was Sam coming up from the side with what appeared to be something metallic in his hand - a gun? - and the other leader was raising his hands and the bandstand was
“I know where we need to take him.” Castiel replied, and the words were good but his tone wasn’t quite as relaxing, and Dean was about to ask prying questions when dark suddenly switched to light and he was kneeling on a rug that had so much shag that Austin Powers would be in heaven.
11am and Dean still hadn’t risen. He also hadn’t moved much from his initial spot, now even more entrenched with his arm wrapped around Castiel’s midsection and Castiel’s arm protectively around him. Dean’s head was propped slightly on Castiel’s chest, snuggled down and clearly so solidly asleep that Castiel doubted that a bomb explosion would wake him.
Even more silence. Castiel could see the distance in Dean’s eyes as the man clearly struggled with his thoughts, and decided to sit next to him rather than standing over him like an avenging angel with a flaming sword. The dip of the mattress under his weight moved Dean’s leg next to his own, but that familiar warmth was good, still right, and he was comforted by Dean remaining where he was. From the fact that Dean did not remove his leg it seemed that the feeling was mutual.
Dean brightened, his hand moving from Cas’ leg to grip one of his hands. “Then fuck it. The rest doesn’t matter, Cas.”
And then Cas pounced, and that fear was put to bed. As was he, in a way.
The voice clearly stated the owner felt the answer was ‘no’. Sam huffed a soft laugh and shrugged again.
It had started pretty good, if irritating. Cas was almost more attentive than normal, as though genuinely expecting him to go head over heels from some slip and trip, and if it wasn’t pretty adorable Dean would be getting really fed up right about now. He wasn’t some kid they had to watch! The only good thing was that Cas’ hand never strayed from his, a firm anchor protecting him from whatever beasties Cas and Sam had created in their minds, and Dean wasn’t planning to object.
“Oh, yes. Very good.” she looked between them and gave Dean another sly smile. “Well, I’d better leave you to it.”
to know.
“You’re having fun.”
Castiel caught one of his hands and stared at him steadily. Wide green eyes looked back at the angel’s stern expression before Castiel offered him a twinkling smile and gently but firmly shoved Dean backward so he sprawled across the bed.
“I asked you once,” Sam replied mildly. “And that was when you decided to overlook a chair. You’re not a ghost, you can’t walk through things.”
we get them back to normal. And for the first time, both of them are of the size that I can manhandle them where I want,”
“C’mon, Cas. Let’s get you home.” Dean pushed himself to his feet and then knelt, gathering up Cas in his arms to pick him up-
“Well, he doesn’t seem to be in pain. That has to be a good thing.” he said slowly. “And although he’s being a bit of an asshole, I kinda recognise him from that too. It’s still Dean, just the suspicious version of Dean whenever he’s planning to fight for something everyone else thinks is crazy. Is he doing anything else other than the … uh, marriage focus?”
A few hours later and the boys had gone as well. Dean had re-emerged from a long shower, and eaten whatever Jody put in front of him with silent determination. Sam was still quiet but offered her small smiles. And neither of them could look in her direction, not for very long, and the silent pain in their eyes made that just as well.
“It’s okay, Cas. It’ll be all my idea. You can just watch, no blame on you.”
His nerves were rubbing off on Dean, who also suddenly looked a lot less certain. The witch eyed them, unimpressed.
Castiel closed his eyes briefly, praying for strength, which doubled again as Dean began to gently but determinedly push him in the direction of the bedroom and the large and very welcoming bed.
“..Cas?” Dean’s eyes cracked open slightly in concern and confusion before he worked out what was going on. Another breathless huff of laughter. “Smell the roses some other time, okay?”
“M’sorry. I didn’t mean to tease.” he said softly. Always better to apologise, and he was sure Cas was a good person. Definitely didn’t really need to dig deeper into his memories, it was clear as day. Still, Cas was still staring at him as though he’d messed something up, and Dean studied him for a moment in uncertainty.
Anyway, he wasn’t going far. This celebration needed family together, and Cas was his.
There was a long silence. Dean didn’t dare roll over, and he felt Castiel’s arm tighten around him as there was a group effort to work out what to say.
“The spell needs something genuinely loving. Mine are more pleasure based only.” Another sly smile, creeping at the corner of the angel’s mouth. “And are you really trying to tell me that you two don’t fall into the romantic category? Please.”
It did, however, seem a little ungrateful not to acknowledge their concern. Having reached the house and deposited a still unconscious Dean carefully on the bed, Castiel turned to offer a small smile to the women.
“Yeah. Some of the markings are linked to a few specific power companies.” Sam replied, the confirmation that at least the creature or god or whatever had been identified. Castiel all but sagged with relief. Knowing your enemy might not immediately lead to success, but at least it gave them a starting point.
After that it was a matter of curling up on the bed, finding the most comfortable way for Dean to press himself against Castiel without being either awkward to hold for too long or excessively suggestive. Not that Castiel’s form cared about how suggestive the pose was; the angel was uncomfortably aware of the ache and the hardness that had emerged, and hoped that Dean was too tired to notice.
From the little trembles he could feel and the way Cas tensed against him, apparently pleading was really hitting the angel’s good spots and Dean grinned to himself. Now that he could do, and fuck the fact that Balthazar was there, he wanted this and he needed this and fuck, he was willing to do pretty much anything. He tried to move his leg slightly in a vague attempt to brush his aching cock against his thigh but that only resulted in a sharp slap to his ass cheek. Really?! They clearly wanted him to melt into a puddle of human goo.
. I can do one at a time if you don’t want all your eggs in one basket,”
“I… I am not good with small children. Or at least, not enough to stop them hurting themselves when I’m not looking.” Castiel said, clearly worried. “Small human children seem to be accidentally suicidal.”
Castiel paused to remember the cover story. Oh yes. Electrical markings.
“Dean?” the voice had grown concerned again. “Are you okay? You look a little pale. Here! I got you and Cas some breakfast from the Great Hall,”
And this was swiftly entering into a situation that Castiel had no idea how to fix, or even where to start. He could feel Dean’s pain, his uncertainty, his anger that was so typically Dean, but had no idea where even to start in order to reassure him. Words seemed ineffectual, although Castiel was quite certain that the wrong words would be equally catastrophic.
happen if Castiel couldn’t find a way back to their adult forms? It was a question she was ignoring, but it was harder and harder not to imagine as the boys took up much of her day.
The world decided to stop moving for a moment. Castiel forced himself to respond.
“Haven’t you heard? Size is everything.” Dean winked and turned a little more to face him, scanning the other people over Castiel’s shoulder idly. Most were still in their own conversations, and he was pretty sure he’d spoken to nearly all of them with positive results and normally some sort of compliment toward his current ‘husband’.
Sam had recovered his own breath but he was clutching hold of his wrist with the other hand, a look of outrage still very much present on his features.
The guilt rose up within him again. He should have done more. He should have
Well, okay then. That was a thing. And he wasn’t sure whether he wanted to peer into the truth for fear of what he might find. Was it right? There was a churning in his stomach to suggest the angel had a point, and yet he felt far too vulnerable to admit that. They were friends. Really close friends. Really,
“I would have agreed had you possessed your memories,” The conviction in his voice was strong, but Castiel had no idea whether it would be strong enough. Neither, apparently, did Dean. The man gazed back at him as though faced with a new beast, slowly sinking back to the back in consideration.
“Actually, I didn’t. Sex is fine. They’re very pro-sex.” Sam shrugged. Dean perked up a little and said a brief prayer for that.
The boys studied the pillows, then looked at each other.
“You got to stop shutting us out-,”
“I…,” Castiel decided against the lie and simply sighed. “We have not. But Dean would have spoken up-,”
“Ah! So you
“Mm.” Dean’s gaze never wavered.
Still, at least people weren’t giving him funny looks. The occasional person gave him a friendly wave - still slightly creepy - but most of them ignored him enough that he was a background character in whatever personal drama they were involved in. And that was good enough for him. The only thing this would achieve was to explore all the random paths for no good reason, and then Dean could make his way back to the house and a non-alcoholic drink and find out what Cas had been up to. He really,
“This is a spell, not a speed dating thing.” the angel commented. “Unless either of you two want to become the lead caster, I’d suggest keeping that sulky little mouth of yours shut. Well, for words, anyway. Other tasks may vary.”
“Cas, people can change.” Dean looked at him fondly. Yeah, man was a worrier, but that was kinda cute. The way it made his eyes wider, like some kid faced with a new playground wonder. The uncertainty that balanced out the strict, gruff deep voice. Pretty adorable. He wandered closer and gently took hold of his husband’s tie - a
“Good. Sam had a suggestion on how you could do that,” the angel nodded solemnly. Dean watched him warily, then shrugged inwardly. After all, how bad it could be?
He didn’t know but so badly wanted to. He was also afraid to find out.
“I did not say you could move yet though,” Castiel reminded him. The sulky tripled.
Dean was automatically fighting the finger’s progress but little by little the reaction died away until it was nestled and snug. The angel gently leaned forward to press a kiss against Dean’s brow, waiting for him to relax enough for it to be moved.
“Sam.”
“Really, Cas? Your little shaved apes?” Balthazar huffed a soft laugh and then drained the wine glass he’d been holding. “You know I interrupted a really good orgy for this.”
“I’m going with him!” Dean would have folded his arms but the sword almost poked him in the leg when he tried. In the end he just aimed the wobbly tip of the sword toward them again. “S’my job.”
“There’s a good little pet,” Balthazar breathed, fingers still stroking over Dean’s face as Castiel continued his steady, deep, feel-it-in-the-bones thrusts and his fingers dug into the meat of Dean’s hips, and Dean deliberately nipped at the finger that stroked feather light across his lips. Balthazar chuckled in amusement, keeping his finger caught in Dean’s teeth, and met Dean’s gaze in an uncomfortably knowing way.
“Mm.” Dean paused for a moment, then shrugged. “Yeah, I guess. Couldn’t hurt. Although the bed ain’t the biggest in the world. Might be a bit close quarters.”
- opened it with as few squeaks as he could humanly make. A blond woman stared at him in shock for a moment, her hand already outstretched as though to knock, her eyes automatically moving to study the nude-trenchcoat fashion before rising again and offering him a bright smile.
“Is that any way to talk to your brother’s saviour?” Balthazar replied reproachfully, then chuckled softly again as he finished his drink and stubbed the cigarette out in it. “Right. I have the items. Cas, you and your boy want to come out to the main room? We can get boogie-ing.”
“Ask your teddy,” suggested Claire, who had been leaning against the doorway. Dean frowned, and then turned his attention to the little stuffed toy. Jody kept a respectful silence before Dean lifted his head and fixed them all with a stern look.
“Understood. Dean and I will be at the ceremony,” Castiel did not know how to imply that he was planning to destroy the bandstand, but he suspected Sam would assume explosions anyway. He hesitated. “I .. uh, may need to keep him away from you. He is still..,”
“That looked like you were desperate to get laid, so… well, yeah,” Dean grinned as they continued to wander back to the house. He paused as they passed a path heading into the main wooded area, a little patch of greenery that the houses had been built around and which looked a little like a park that had received the Grim Fairy Tale treatment.
“So you’re assuming something happened there because it’s .. old?” Dean looked at the photo critically before handing it back to Sam. “Based on what?”
Castiel winced internally but didn’t allow that to show as he continued his obvious physical investigation whilst searching with his mind through more angelic means. A dark bruise was already forming on Dean’s forehead, but Castiel could detect no further injury other than a small graze on his thigh which was probably the result of said failed rescue mission. He gently pressed his fingers to Dean’s neck, checked again, and then crouched to lift him smoothly into his arms once satisfied that he wasn’t going to harm him further. Both women stepped back, eyes wide.
?” Castiel said carefully, as though testing each word. “That isn’t already baked into a pie?”
Castiel blinked. “I do not understand. Why would I not be okay?”
Another small flicker. “Well, yay for us.”
warm, regardless of where he was, like an angel shaped hot water bottle that should be grabbed and hugged under a blanket at times of unease. Dean finally risked a sideways look, a small, nervous glance like a dog trying not to eye up a plate of biscuits for fear of being told off, and discovered that his own nudity issue was not confined to him alone.
emotional stuff. I don’t know, I guess he thinks it makes him weak and vulnerable, or perhaps he’s just generally shit at serious things outside of a one night stand. He’d take it to his grave if you let him.” Sam stared at him steadily. “
“Do I look sneaky?” Rowena raised an eyebrow.
“If I was an evil plotter in an evil cult community, I’d probably have cameras and microphones to record what the romantic couples get up … to.” Dean trailed off and winced. “They’re gonna have cameras and microphones in the bedroom, aren’t they?”
“Uh. So, what’s the plan for today again?” he asked as casually as he could. Cas studied him for a moment before giving a quick glance around the room and back again.
monsters! I promise!”
Pushing himself up from his knees, Dean shot said ‘saviour’ an unimpressed glare as he moved into the main room and paused at the decorative circle in the middle of the floor. Candles had been set up in various places, with a few items perched on a nearby table. The whole thing was made even more surreal by the presence of a low disco ball that was lazily spinning, sending shards of light into the dimness of the room.
“Sam didn’t quite explain what mingling meant,” the angel added, apologetically. “Research suggests it’s idle talk about irrelevant things to make someone feel at ease?”
“Dean?” His name, but coming from the wrong man and the wrong direction. Dean gritted his teeth and focused on Cas, but Sam drew closer, wiping his dirty hands on some sort of cloth as he did so. Sam stared at Cas and then back at Dean. “What’s happened?”
fault. The sooner his brother went away and left them to the community the better.
“Fuck, he’s an asshole.”
“It does feel like that sometimes,” Castiel agreed, although his viewpoint was less enthusiastic than his husband’s.
“A ‘you’ thing.” Dean repeated. “Gonna talk about it?”
“Dean. You
“I wish it was that easy,” Castiel felt like the worst friend possible and tried to ignore how much the man slumped next to him. “You can’t make a decision without information.”
They stared at him in uncertainty.
“But if you go, who will help me protect this place?” Jody asked. “And protect Sam?”
Sam’s voice in his head:
This definitely did not seem to be that moment.
“Sam. Generally, yes.” Castiel leaned onto the nearby counter and allowed his eyes to drift to the front door. “Have you had a productive evening?”
“He’s an angel of the lord, isn’t he?”
The thumb continued to stroke across his lips curiously, a fishing lure waiting to see whether the fish would bite. Dean snarled, eyes flashing angrily, but they both knew that was pretty much toothless. If anything, Balthazar probably knew him all too well, both coming to sex with a very similar mindset, and that wasn’t a fun thing to consider at the best of times. Balthazar was still a jerk, though. On the other hand, Dean wasn’t sure whether that was enough to stop it.
“Your invitations. I would have accepted them had I been reassured you fully understood the situation.” Castiel expanded, pushing past the growing suspicion that discussing this was a poor decision as well. There was no guarantee that Dean’s keenness would continue, and sure enough not a muscle moved across the man’s face.
“Cas!” Dean’s voice was a desperate sharp bark and there was absolutely no doubt that he would be using stronger language if he both dared and could remember words. He took a better grip on Dean’s hips and slowly began to press inside with torturous slowness, Dean’s noises cutting off immediately as Castiel sank deeper into him.
“It’s Jody, Sam, remember me? I’m the police lady with Claire and Annie.” she placed the now empty cup to the side and moved to crouch down to the clearly anxious boy. “Dean’s over there and Cas is sitting over there. You’re safe.”
Another lift of Dean’s mouth in amusement. “Duly noted.”
Dean’s lip curled again angrily, although not knowing what the hell he was aiming that to. The situation, possibly. He was also aware of Cas slowing his thrusts down, waiting, allowing him more movement, and Dean found his mouth growing drier which really wasn’t going to help in the long run.
“Cassy.” That was Balthazar, a little warning tone. Castiel swallowed and straightened his shoulder, giving a little shake of his head in answer.
“Well,” Sam said brightly, like a kids tv presenter. “You guys have a quick walk and I’ll do what I can to fix your water system. Meet back here in … half an hour? Forty five minutes?”
There was a strangled noise of annoyance from Dean who rested his forehead against Cas’ shoulder for a moment.
Exquisite. Castiel’s breath caught in his throat. And his trust was more so, Dean’s vulnerability offered despite the man’s initial fears.
Dean glanced down and shrugged. “It’s only one of them and it’s not that bad.”
out of my sight,” Dean took a step closer, all but vibrating in anger. “You want to go all moral high ground, Sam, you can take it to whatever church you’re sucking up to.”
came back, a weird mix of anger or grief or sadness or joy or love or boredom, flip flopping throughout each, and he found Sam’s name on the tip of his tongue to shout out, only it wasn’t Sam, it was
“Yeah, well, to quote Bon Jovi, you live for the fight when that’s all that you got.” Another pause. “And you’re about to say I’ve got you and Sam, right?”
“It’s rum.” she advised when Castiel sniffed it, a frown confirming his curiosity. “So.. I guess this is the bit you tell me what’s going on.”
“Cas, it’s fine.” Dean kept his voice casual. “You hold my hand a bit, you smile at me, I smile back, we call each other some cute names and laugh, and then make a wink wink suggestion every so often.”
“Yeah, that was probably a stupid question.” Most questions led to Dean when it came to Cas, which made it all the more ridiculous that the pair were still maintaining they were ‘close friends with a strong bond’. Glue companies would be impressed by the strength of that bond. Sam glanced at him. “His current mood?”
“For fuck’s..,” Dean caught himself before he accidentally said something that Cas would take as negative, then grinned. “Yeah. I’m willing. Sign me up.”
“Dean’s never seemed to be the shaking sort.” Castiel said, still clearly reluctant. Sam smiled at him gently.
“Well, how about we make
“One leader is dead and Sam has the other,” Castiel said carefully. “And the bandstand has burned to the ground. The haunting has gone, Dean.”
Dean laugh-growled again and then made a movement in the bed that Castiel believed was labelled ‘snuggle’. From the way Dean was now avoiding his gaze, a full denial was clearly not likely to emerge.
The answer to this question was invariably no.
“I see.” Sam could translate Dean-ese pretty damned well. “And
Dean cracked his eyes open slightly as his nipple was abandoned and a soft murmur sounded, only to find Balthazar murmuring something into Cas’ ear. The light flickered across the angel’s dirty blonde hair, for a moment forming what appeared to be a very incorrect halo, before said angel gave him a careless glance.
For now, he was satisfied with their closeness.
“About something important, Cas. And then let’s head out the door looking like we’re off to do something vital, yeah?” Dean whispered. He was aware of blue eyes studying him for a moment before Castiel gave a little decisive nod, took hold of Dean’s hand like a mother scooping up a small child and gently but firmly tugged him toward the door.
“Is that a yes?” Castiel was utterly fascinated by the prospect. Dean bit his lip and glanced at the door again, which almost certainly suggested that it was, before turning back to him again.
The exodus suddenly gained new legs as Dean Winchester entered the space, gently but firmly pushing those who were stuck in their own memories toward the path and picking up people who had stumbled. Finally the space was clearer and he was already turning back at a run toward the bandstand and Sam when he saw another flash of light, a golden swarm that circled around the top of the bandstand before blinking out of existence with a blast wave that picked him up and slammed him hard into the trees, bouncing off one and ending up in a bush.
It was always blood. Demons must have a special bulk buy order on stain remover. But how much blood? Normally it was just a slice and a small amount, but by the way that Balthazar was looking at Castiel, Dean was suddenly uncertain whether this wouldn’t need someone to drain dry. Apparently Cas was having a similar thought as his head raised and eyes narrowed.
“We slept together. As in .. ,” Sam made a little gesture that was still unclear, and then sighed even heavier at Castiel’s expression. “As in romantically. Not quite intercourse but definitely not .. uh, well, you probably get the idea.”
. What did that poet say? It is better to have loved and to have lost than to have never loved at all. Or I might have picked it up in the middle of a fortune cookie, who knows.” Rowena readjusted her bag on her arm and looked at them expectantly. “Yes, they’re hurting. This isn’t something I can resolve. That’s up to you.”
“Dean..,”
“Don’t worry. He’s still yours. Look at him, so desperate to be loyal despite his base instincts.”
“Never said I wasn’t.” Balthazar smiled again gently and stroked Dean’s cheek delicately, before glancing up at Castiel again carefully.
“Oh! Of course, how sweet.”
A few more minutes and they were approaching a small path junction where another woman was unsuccessfully trying to rouse a clearly unconscious Dean by use of a flapping of hands technique that Castiel suspected was to offer him some more ‘air’. He had seen it demonstrated in various older movies.
Half of him was expecting Balthazar to speak up and ruin things but the other angel was silent in whatever darkened corner he’d taken himself to, and there were no distractions on offer as Cas gently cupped Dean’s chin with a feather light touch as they stared silently at each other for what felt like years.
After five more minutes Castiel was more certain that nothing fundamentally large had happened and he closed his eyes wearily. So much for protection.
“You know that whole gay thing we were discussing last night?” Dean said. “That.”
Perhaps they would get back to normal. Perhaps it was just too raw, too weird, too whatever. Jody sighed as she put away the camp beds and tidied away the last remnants of play. Who knew that something that didn’t have either fangs or knives could hurt quite this badly.
“What’s going on-,” and that was a fresh voice to the mix. Claire stepped into the room, slowly removing her headphones as she frowned toward Castiel and the small creature that was snuggled so closely it was hard to tell where one started and the other finished. She studied the scene for a moment, before turning a raised eyebrow toward Jody.
She let out a breath, and returned the happy little smile with one of her own. “Thank you. Good boy, Dean.”
“Yeah, but I
“At some point,” he agreed. “Stay still,”
“Dean-,” the sternness had faded now, a more anxious look in his eyes. Dean chuckled softly.
” Dean looked up with a pained expression. “Cas, man, stop saying that, and especially not in that voice that suggests I’ve just sentenced the world to death! I
“No.”
“I can definitely give it a go.” Sam said, a little doubtfully.
you could just act normally,” Sam sighed. “Little acts of affection, sure, but you don’t need to perform as though you’re in the middle of Desperate Housewives.”
talking about the water?” Dean walked out to meet them, stretching slightly before walking next to Castiel and casually taking his hand in a small throwaway act of intimacy that felt more solid than any of Dean’s sexual suggestions. Castiel attempted to look nonchalant, and ignored Sam’s gaze.
Holding hands, huh? Dean fought down a flush to his cheeks and glanced out the window as casually as he could manage without alerting Sam.
good. It’s just a shock. S’like getting into a swimming pool and finding a shark.”
Another very long silence and a man who looked as though he was approaching his own personal hell of a question. Dean’s eyes flickered toward the doorway nervously, as though concerned that someone might be watching, before turning back to Castiel with the cautious air of one expecting a trap.
Obviously for other people other than him.
“C’mon, let’s go, let’s go.” It was feeling more natural. Dean was herding, getting people out of the local area, taking control. More and more things came to him, almost like suggestions. An image of salt, for some damned reason. The need to hunt. To go grab ..
close, and he could almost feel electricity crackle as he turned a little more to face him. The hand on his shoulder was still there, a warm, friendly touch that didn’t quite match the intense look in vivid blue eyes as Cas seemed to stare into his soul.  They were so close that Dean couldn’t really see the rest of Castiel’s body but the skin he could see was talking to him in ways that quite frankly confused the fuck out of him. Since when did seeing a guy’s upper body cause that type of physical reaction to burn through him? Cas was almost golden, especially in this light, the shadows and light playing prettily over his skin and sending new magical light in his eyes, and Dean found his throat growing drier again.
Castiel scowled at him for a moment before shaking his head and deliberately changing the subject. “I need to look at where he fell to see whether there’s anything that’s caused this. There’s supposed to be a ceremony tomorrow.”
“... what…?” Dean’s voice was supposed to be strong and masterful and ended up being a soft whimper of pleading. “C’mon. Please.”
“Good boy,” Castiel was back to nuzzling his neck, breathing in the scents and the sensations as Dean trembled against him and feeling his own body respond just as violently. If storms could be powered by sexual need then they would have taken out mountains by now. Castiel paused to catch his own shaking breath before gently nipping Dean’s neck again gently. Dean groaned softly and let his head tip back onto the bed weakly.
“And that is the one thing I am certain of in a whole day of confusion.”
“I’m not good at romance, Cas. I mean, I’m really,
Sam was on word strike and merely nodded, still wide eyed and stunned. Still, there weren't tears and that was a good thing. She hated hearing either of them cry. Seemed against nature.
“That is definitely debatable.”
That was an unusual place to start a conversation, but Castiel decided to ignore it as a potential creation from pain. He stepped forward and silently held out his hand for Sam’s injured wrist which, after a small short sulky hesitation, was finally given to him. Castiel frowned as he gently manipulated the joint. Definitely broken, and some damage to the tendons. Dean had been remarkably rough considering the small movement, but then Dean had received significant experience on how to gain the maximum amount of damage from each attack.
She could hear Annie chuckling as Jody went off in search of Dean, but decided to ignore it. And Dean was also pretty damned good at hiding on top of being speedy. She checked the downstairs, under chairs, in closets, in small gaps she’d forgotten existed. No Dean.
“Because …,” Dean stared at him before screwing his eyes closed and lowering his head in frustration. And that Castiel could fully understand. Sometimes life was significantly easier when the Bad Thing was pointed out to be destroyed. Subtleties and areas of grey were as annoying as they were bewildering.
“Oh yes, dearie, you don’t have to worry about that. They’ll remember all the other fun things that a Winchester gets up to. Theft. Murder. Blood. Guts. Hell. Etc. Give it time,” Rowena waved that off. “Well, have fun readjusting. I’m sure it will get better at some point,”
Dean forced the fixed smile to continue. Oh, good. Wedding nights and endurance. The woman’s eyes widened for a moment before a warm smile showed.
Hand slid over the firmness of his stomach, Dean nuzzling into Castiel’s neck as he curled up closer. He could feel the heat of the man’s arousal press against his hip, conscious of his own body’s response that was equally, hard, hot and desperate. It was a hard situation to be in, and no amount of gentle cuddling would help.
“..he’s still got his head shoved up his ass, got it,” Sam said drily. “Yeah, okay, Cas. I can’t say I currently want to be around him either. Sometimes he really reminds me of Dad.”
“Yes, covered in butter and ready for the oven… please, dearies. Look at them. So small. And then you’d like them to become big adults again. Now look at them again. What do you notice?” she gave them an impatient look. “This isn’t the incredibly hulk. I’m doing
He couldn’t remember this brother of his, but his timing sucked balls. Just to fix the water? Man, that was annoying. It was good of him to come he guessed, but still. Didn’t want to show that though, Cas was giving him another confused look over his shoulder at his reaction.
“Close enough. And you move around small groups rather than just stay with one.” Dean shrugged. “Usually the type of conversation that occurs between drinks. You know, weather, neighbours, the local cat has taken a shit in the garden-,”
“And short term stuff.”
Another little look of doubt. Dean shot a small, uncertain look at his brother, and then at Cas again worriedly.
“And the pre-made waffles.”
“Don’t wet yourself, I’m not going to touch you.” he advised. Dean bristled slightly but felt a little more relieved, slowly relaxing back against the floor and watching Cas as his hand slipped down to gently caress Dean’s balls with the same confident movements as before. Balthazar was still present, both hands now on Cas’ shoulders like a particularly dedicated massage, but oddly Dean couldn’t get himself too worked up over it. As long as the other angel was over there and he was down here, things would be okay.
“You’re bringing some personal effects. The community kinda provide the major stuff,” Sam looked around himself critically. “Apparently they like white and cream.”
The smile lifted in the corner of Castiel’s mouth. For all his outbursts and arguments, he had a growing suspicion that Dean just wanted to be a good boy. This was certainly something he could offer him.
“Have you eaten anything yet?” the angel didn’t look up from his paper, his voice mild.
“You okay?”
did, but that was an embarrassment for another time.
“I’m taking that to mean it’ll be with me within a few days and thank you very much for all your help, Rowena, you’re a wonderful person,”
?” he pressed. “Which fluid did you want?”
There was a look on Balthazar’s face that suggested that he wasn’t entirely convinced but was willing to overlook it given the circumstances. Balthazar gently extracted his thumb and settled on his knees in front of him, waiting until Dean had finally found the balls to look at him before raising an eyebrow in question.
Jody raised her eyes from small Winchester to Castiel in question. There was a weary sigh.
Castiel had never seen Dean so eager to talk about anything emotional. Ordinarily this was the time when the man found a reason to go out for a long drive, or drink, or discover a fight somewhere. It was not a bad change by any means, but when you were desperately trying to avoid the situation there was something to be said for distractions.
Pushing himself up from his chair, he made his way toward the kitchen area and the prospect of coffee. Stepping through the entrance confirmed the presence of Castiel, who was equally engaged in coffee related activities. Clear blue eyes turned to him with a worried expression.
No, the Glen was their home and Sam could happily fuck off.
Castiel moved across to take the fork and spear a piece of pie carefully, before aiming it toward Dean. “
“For lights? Yeah, probably. It sounded like a zap.” Dean began to check over Cas’ hands and arms for any sign of injury, and was pleased to note they seemed to be as clear as they had been before. “You look okay, no entry wounds or anything. Any aches?”
“Dean,” Castiel decided to step in before Dean added to the torment clearly happening in the man’s mind. “I enjoyed our time together. My only concern was that you did not know the truth before acting.”
From that point on it was a mix of give and take. His steady rhythm merged with Dean’s as their mouths met, movement varying in strength and angle as his length plunged quicker into his lover’s willing body with Dean bucking against him in his own need to make things faster, harder. Dean’s hand had already strayed to his own dick and was stroking himself furiously in time, a look of concentration on his flushed face as he did so.
“Are you okay, Dean?” Castiel spoke again, and Dean jumped.
“So, what? You want us to hug and kiss and say ‘let’s just do it and fuck everything?’” Dean scoffed, a little more animation in his voice.
. Couldn’t have a decent society without it. And yet his husband still looked at him as though he was a completely different person.
Sighing, Dean turned and began to trudge back toward the sounds of crowds and the housing. It sounded bad, but then, he probably wasn’t the only one with a fairy tale that wouldn’t hold up to scrutiny.
The morning went by without too much incident. she noted in her book. Sam had gone through various old encyclopedias she had hanging around from times gone past, and was quizzing Annie about various pictures that caught his fancy. Dean had decided to ‘create’ something in the kitchen using old cardboard boxes, cardboard tubes, random plastic containers and a lot of tape. In the end there was a cardboard tank-like weapon that was armed and ready, which Dean proclaimed was an anti-werewolf tank thanks to the tin foil that he’d carefully inserted in the tube which was the closest thing to silver he could find.
For a moment his heart felt as though it had stopped entirely, Castiel staring at her with the look of someone who had briefly forgotten the language. Accident. There were many types of accident, and many of them were lethal. But Dean was Dean. Lethal happened to other people, and he had to cling to that.
“Right.”
“Doesn’t get much better when they get older,” Jody advised. “And I guess it could be worse. They could be a year younger and you’d be dealing with potty training as well.”
“Really? The community?” Sam mused over that. “Well, I guess if his memory is dodgy then there’s not much else to focus on. Other than your marriage. And speaking of that..,”
Unsurprisingly, Dean was fully on board with a full argument.
“Is he dying?” Dean’s eyes were enormous. “I didn’t mean to do it! He fell! He was running and then just went down!”
It was an ordinary, pleasant evening and as everyone knew, ordinary, pleasant evenings always tempted fate.
“Yeah, I see what you mean. Both definitely on the creepy level.”
It was getting easier. Sure, he still couldn’t remember much … if anything .. of his previous life, but Dean was increasingly certain he wasn’t missing much. And life seemed peaceful here, with the people and the architecture and the shared food that had more doughnuts than even he could cope with.
Dean began to laugh when Castiel’s gaze lifted again to fix him with a stern look. The laugh stopped mid-chuckle, a look of surprise crossing Dean’s face for a moment before being replaced by something distinctly hungry.
Dean offered another little dismissal, this time just a shrug and a bored look that suggested he wasn’t going to offer up suggestions. Sam and Castiel exchanged glances, a look that wasn’t overlooked by Dean.
“Dean…,”
“...sorry..,” Although clearly unrepentant for this activity. Dean lifted his treasures, the bear and the sword. “Needed these for training,”
they were gone. Castiel let out a breath and then turned urgently back to the bed.
“You said he would not be harmed!” Cas hissed softly and angrily toward Balthazar as he gently tried to stroke over Dean’s body to calm his little shudders.
“It’s not a
That seemed to be a fair bet. Still lying on his side, Dean’s head was resting against Castiel’s shoulder and the line of his body was all but draped over the angel’s. Castiel was aware of the heat that Dean was generating, and the soft, gentle vibrations of a living, breathing,
“Not literally.” Dean fell silent until his curiosity got the better of him. “So, what
“Yes.” the angel gritted out.
“Dean-,”
“What aren’t you telling me? Because either you don’t know what it is, and you’re making up the bit ‘bout Sam being fine for a few days, or you do know what it is and you don’t want to tell me.” he scanned the cautious expression of Castiel, frowning slightly at the look. “So..?”
“Okay. Be right back. And at least that explains what happened to the trifle in the kitchen,” she walked back out the door. Jody’s eyebrows rose, turning back to Castiel and his current passenger.
“You do say that particular thing a lot.” Castiel considered it. “Although when you say ‘fuck everything’-,”
If only it could occur when there weren’t demons attacking him.
Sam was going to die.
“So that equates to… what? A day? Two?” Claire looked between them and suddenly brightened. “Hey, this means I’m a more experienced hunter than Sam and Dean!”
“ Don’t worry, Dean’s fine. And yeah, I go to the gym… do some running,” he winced internally. Running. There was only one point to running and that was getting away or chasing something. For fun? Madness.
He should shout out. Tell him that he was here, half hidden in leaves, muddy as hell, just as blood stained as he usually was. And yet Dean couldn’t bring himself to do it, not quite yet. Not while he still had a few glimmers of memories from a point when he genuinely believed the fairy tale that the Community had woven around him, when peace wasn’t just a sound associated with the size of pie portions.
“I know. And you really should. God knows when the next piece of chaos and bloodshed will turn up, you got to do things when you’ve got the opportunity.” Sam said, matter of factly. “I mean, come on. Theft, murder, genocide, we’ve all done full on evil stuff at least once. In comparison, why should actual love be an issue? If there is ever such a thing as judgement day, are they really gonna focus on that bit?”
“Yes. No. I mean… you know what I mean.”
There was a soft muttered word that was almost certainly a curse, but it seemed an acknowledging type of curse and therefore Castiel was happy to let that go. He nodded, satisfied, and then stepped out to unearth the younger Winchester and his injury.
“I’m sure you do.” The critical look aimed itself back at Dean. “I thought you said they’d had a hex problem. He looks just as healthy as he normally does, albeit filthier than the average 80s porno. Cas, you know I love you, but if this all turns out to be the spiritual version of a verruca then I’m going to be pissed.”
“Stop trying to force him.” Castiel growled softly and irritably.
“A witch. Or, we think, anyway. There were some magic cards and a room full of shit - not actual shit,” he amended, knowing Cas’ tendencies. “Just woo-woo stuff and sparkly things and that perfume that gets up your nose and-,”
“Dean.” The word was a warning.
“And do you think you might know of the origins of the electrical power?”
There was another short silence. Dean licked his lips carefully, and then leaned forward.
Finally the man began to speak, a low, solemn voice that still managed to drift clearly across the space. Dean didn’t understand the words - were they latin? He didn’t know - but there was a rhythm to it, a soft, warm chant that he couldn’t draw his attention away from. The rest of the audience and surroundings seemed to fade away, irrelevant in the face of the performance. At some point he’d lost hold of Cas’ hand but that was okay, that was fine, Cas would be nearby and it was all good, very good, and the community was there with him.
“It’s okay. I understand.”
. No matter how long this went on for, no matter how much Dean said it, they were friends and friends only. In a way this polite, domestic setting was worse than the sexual exploration that Dean had so desperately wanted to try; physically intimate activities could find reasons to put them on hold. Little touches and gestures of affection were automatic and spoke to areas of Castiel’s mind that he hadn’t been aware even existed.
Sam had to agree with that. He swallowed the rest of the coffee and put the cup down determinedly on the counter.
The next few moments were almost a blur as their bodies began to find a rhythm, slowly at first but building strength and need with each thrust. A slow and steady rocking motion seemed to work well, every so often being punctuated by slow, hard, painfully deep thrusts that caused Dean to cry out weakly in pleasure.
There was a silence as they looked at each other before Balthazar held up his hands as though in surrender and chuckled softly again.
“What other option do we have? He carries on like this, he’s going to break himself falling down stairs or walking in front of a car or something. Sometimes you just have to shake the answer out of him.”
The little ball of hope discovered an ice-caked layer, only to reignite as Dean took hold of the bedroom door and closed it with a firm slam. The look that turned back to him was a familiar one, one that was more commonly aimed at hellbeasts or creatures of an otherwise dark demeanor, and Castiel found his mouth closing automatically as Dean prowled back toward the bed.
“What happened?” Sam spoke up, and Dean shot him a filthy look. Could he not see that Cas needed some time to recover before asking idiotic questions? Cas made another soft noise and finally shifted his body weight.
“Oh. The younger one with the mop of hair and aspirations of being a human giraffe. I did wonder why he wasn’t here.”
“Of course not,” Castiel was stung by the suggestion.
“Ancient magical relic.” Castiel took a mouthful and hesitated, looking at the glass for a moment. “This is agreeable.”
“What has happened?” the words were soft and low behind him, and Dean closed his eyes in relief.
A few moments of healing later and the damage was resolved, Castiel opening his eyes again to focus on Sam’s face that had already gained significant relief.
“This being sex? You are aware this is not a necessity?” Castiel captured Dean’s chin in his hand and tried to soothe him. Dean gave him an incredulous look.
“No.” said Dean truthfully. Cas’s eyes narrowed again in thought.
“M’okay!” came Dean’s shout.
“You’re a fucking bastard.” Even he could hear that the usual teeth just weren’t in it.
Jogging.
And this was becoming frustrating. “Sam, could you please-,”
“That is
A quick assessment on the angel didn’t give him much. There was the trademark frown, but Dean could never tell whether it was a thinking expression or whether it was one of genuine concern. Or at least most of the time, anyway. He could normally tell whenever a situation had turned from a workable one into an exercise of futility, Cas’ expression clearly showing whenever he was trying to work out the best way to tell them tactfully they were fucked.
All he needed to do was point that out.
“Ah, Cas, don’t worry. He’s fine, he’s just taking a breath.”
Another few moments of silence from the elder Winchester, but Castiel was gladdened to see the wavering between the lines. Finally there was a soft growl and Dean gave a small, curt nod to indicate acceptance before turning to head out the doorway. Castiel followed behind him, a few steps away to avoid ‘being up his ass’ but equally close enough to catch him should gravity take him before he reached a bed.
Dean restudied his hands with the dedication of a mountain climber approaching the summit.
to do!”
The only thing they’d disagreed on was the phone that Cas had secreted in a pocket. Dean was mildly scandalised - this was not the time for distractions! - but Cas had insisted in such a way that Dean had given up. At least he was confident that Cas’ manners would stop him from using it at an inappropriate time.
Husband.
“That’s an accurate statement of what Cas is currently doing, but not a particularly good assessment of
story,” Jody countered softly. “And you need your rest to keep in tip top shape.”
It felt like an angel blade had plunged into his heart and decided to wiggle around. Castiel made another non-committed noise, and forced himself to remember that the community was almost certainly watching. He carefully placed an arm around Dean’s shoulders and brought him closer, and the happy little sigh of contentment and trust that escaped was both one of the most beautiful and horrific things he’d ever heard.
“A mouse took a stroll through a deep dark wood,” she said. “A fox saw the mouse, and the mouse looked good…,”
Help. He could help. He assisted a couple of people who had fallen, just as shaken as he was, and gently eased them toward the path. Dean started to herd more uncertain people away, their confused eyes staring at him unseeingly for a moment before finally heeding his words. One woman was almost in a state of hysterics, talking about a family member she hadn’t spoken to in years, but the words were being address to what appeared to be a bush. Another stared at him wordlessly, as though they’d only just woken up there.
“Are you okay?” Castiel murmured in his ear, and Dean smiled sleepily at the clear concern in his voice. Speaking, on the other hand, was an effort he wasn’t sure he could do.
Not that it mattered. Castiel dropped to his knees next to Dean’s side and slowly began to check him over.
First Dean’s bed, now his clothing. The day was full of unexpected but welcome surprises. Castiel considered the offer before tilting his head slightly in acceptance. Ignoring the additional shiver of pleasure for the situation, a thinner fabric between skin might also benefit the aid of comfort on a practical ground.
But it was his concern, and it was sweet that the angel still worried about making a good impression with his .. what, soulmate? Potential lover? Whatever it was, Cas was as loyal as the best type of dog, and his current puppy dog eyes were merely testament to that fact. But to a certain point, that wasn’t really his problem. Sam shrugged again and began to head out, with the angel reluctantly following.
“This won’t harm them, right?” Jody watched as items of questionable origins filled up the small table in front of them, including what appeared to be a glass jar crammed full with small furry limbs. Mice? Possibly mice. Because that’s what everyone had in their handbag.
“It was certainly not my initial plan. However,” he added swiftly. “this does not mean that it wasn’t a good idea.”
And there was another small silence as they reassessed their current reality.
“And we’re doing it again. Undercover, Dean. You remember the story, right?” Sam looked at him with the expression of one fully expecting the answer to be ‘mostly’. And that was a fair assessment, but Dean wasn’t planning on giving him the satisfaction for that.
“Shall we?” he murmured, the thumb back on Dean’s lips but this time gently pushing a little to indicate that Dean needed to open his mouth. Another flash of defiance from Dean, but his body was trembling badly now, his need so powerful that he couldn’t think of much else, and he slowly, reluctantly, opened his mouth a little to allow the digit to slip into his mouth.
“Perhaps ye olde style bandstands aren’t weird around here,” Dean stretched, completely unconcerned by the situation, before slipping his hand back into Castiel’s again. The angel felt his cheeks redden slightly before coughing and forcing himself to focus again. Sam hid a small, fond smile and looked down at the phone.
“Dean, you need sleep.” A soft voice but authoritative, the type that he’d seen Dean respond to in the past. Sure enough, Dean squirmed against him again, but in a manner that suggested that other things were on his mind other than sleep. For all his rebellious streak, Dean could be remarkably predictable.
Castiel still had not located his target and therefore they had another phone catch up over their temporary children’s progress. She’d added in extra detail as it seemed to reassure the angel, their likes, their dislikes, their funny moments, whether they’d slept enough, whether the small little nightmares had returned.
“Mgm.” he said instead, but didn’t push it. If he kept his gaze away from Sam then things hurt less. That worked.
Knowing Castiel’s anxiety about the boys’ welfare, Jody had decided to keep a very close track of what they were doing and had obtained a notebook for the task.
“Want to be a good boy?” purred the angel softly, although at least the tone leaned toward the curious rather than the mocking. Dean panted softly, his eyes a mix of deadly and desperate and a tremble that had set in his body so firmly that Dean wasn’t sure whether it was going to be permanent. He could already feel the flush of warmth to his cheeks, and man, the ache in his body was so bad that multiple things that would ordinarily be insane to contemplate were suddenly feeling feasible.
“Snack?”
“And if it
“You know, you could relax a bit,” came a soft and tired, if amused, voice.
The next day wasn’t as smooth as she’d been hoping for. Both boys seemed to be on a massive sugar high after their rest, which was promptly explained when she discovered Dean’s stash of ‘tasty things’. So that was why he was dusty the night before.
Instead Dean pushed himself away, fixed a carefully planned smile and shrugged carelessly, moving into the kitchen and grabbing an apple to bite into.
Dean swallowed through a closing throat, eyes distant and one hand having to steady himself against a tree trunk. He remembered the story. He remembered the pamphlet, and the motel room, and the romantic films to get Cas into the ‘mood’, and the way the angel’s brow furrowed when he tried to make sense of crazy human things, and the way they had all fought together, and heaven, and hell, and Crowley and Bobby and Lucifer, and his mom, and the dark nights and the teeth and the blood and the fighting and the loneliness and the stubbornness and the fear and the -
“Dean..,” Castiel began and failed to find a finishing sentence already. He sighed and looked down, shaking his head. “... I am sorry. I tried to keep things .. safe, but I was conscious of the surveillance.”
“Are you sure you’re okay?”
Dean stumbled and pressed his hand to his forehead as he tried to clear his mind. It was just an avalanche of images, his mind overwhelmed as they came, over and over again, and that was before the
“Just up there. He was moving a little, and tried to say something and then just shut his eyes and went to sleep. We checked he was breathing. He’s still breathing, right?”
For a moment he simply held it lightly with his teeth, eyes holding steady with Balthazar in warning that, despite appearances, this did not mean anything important, before he finally released his hold and began to slowly and carefully suckle on the thumb. Felt weird and yet didn’t, his body apparently delighted to have something else to do in his craving, and caution slowly fell away as Dean put more effort into worshipping said thumb with his tongue and mouth. He flinched slightly as Balthazar rested his other hand on Dean’s head, gently running the strands of his short hair through his fingers, but soon grew used to the closeness of the angel as he focused on his task.
“It’s okay. This will just be a reversal. If it does not work then nothing happens,” he said.
“What? Instead of likely to damage our relationship we move to 100% guaranteed?” Dean snorted softly. “And if you say anything about never winning if you never take the shot, or jump off a fucking cliff to see if you can fly, or something else that’s normally on a wall in cheerful letters, then I’m going to..,”
“What’s going on?” she asked as yet another battle occurred in the lounge. There was a soft pft as the explanation of current wrongness was given to her. “You’re doing it wrong.”
-Cas’ hand on his shoulder turned that thought very firmly back onto their circumstance. Dean slowly found his fists unclenching, his shoulders falling back under Cas’ warmth. And Cas
Lunch had been eaten, although Dean had refused the carrot sticks. Sam had wolfed his own down and then begged for more in what was possibly a show of solidarity with his little green bunny. Later on she had discovered that said little green bunny had also been given a carrot stick for lunch, although apparently the bunny was of the same opinion as Dean as to its appeal.
“To be honest, most reasons tend to boil down to ‘because’ in some form or other.” Castiel looked back at him and then sighed. “Dean, it would not help your current mood.”
Still, he could watch over him until Dean was better. That was the least he could do under the circumstances.
So much to process.
“But-,”
- dress himself. Castiel felt himself relax a little as Dean’s skin met up with a fabric cover, although it was clear that Dean was slowly recovering his confidence. This promised that Castiel’s hands would still be full in the near future.
“You are aware you don’t have to fight
Castiel frowned at him harder. The conversation was getting even harder to follow. “Why?”
“Guys, if you start investigating everything that’s weird then you’d never stop.” Dean pointed out. “But nah, I don’t know about it.”
“Yeah. You definitely miss it when it’s gone,” Sam added. Dean looked from one to the other and then, suspiciously, at the little service box that Sam was threatening to repair.
“... I am sorry.”
The hand wandered across his tense chest, tracing along the line of his muscles and exploring with a delicate touch. Dean was so close now, his naked form close enough for him to feel his heat and breath in his scent, the different hues sparkling in curious green eyes, and it would take so little to lean into the touch, to move against the clearly willing man and explore whatever it was that Dean had it in his mind to do.
“As a shot glass after drinking the whole damned bottle.”
And all his, apparently. Dean suddenly had a wave of pleasure hit him. Why the hell was he fighting this?
“... Dean, did you remember to close the curtains before you wander around naked?” he said as the best thing to do to alert Sam to this new development. And it was certainly a development; Dean seemed to be relaxing swiftly to his current predicament, and that was without any solution in sight. In fact, Castiel still was not entirely certain whether Dean viewed his memory loss as an issue at all, a situation that was as perplexing as it was complicated.
Another silence from the other end of the phone. “Definitely didn’t prick his finger on a spindle, right?”
The words continued, rhythmic, dancing, warm. Dean could feel his mouth growing drier, a tingle throughout his body as he watched, entranced, unable to look away. The outside of his vision had faded away to darkness but that didn’t matter either, the world was not going away and the lights were dancing and flickering around like fireflies. Despite the fact that there were several rows of people in front of him it felt as though the words were only for him, murmuring, persuading, and Dean strained to hear and feel every word.
Yes. That was probably needed.
Full of what was probably to be determined.
“Yes, it’s a good look for you.” Rowena commented from behind her table. Dean scowled in her direction and then cautiously down again at where his hand was linked to Castiel’s as though in disbelief. Not that either Dean or Castiel tried to extract themselves from the situation, hands remaining clasped as though this was some essential lifeline. Perhaps it was.
There was a short pause as Dean considered that.
Close enough. “A bit.”
“Mm? Oh, no, there was a basket of stuff outside the door because we missed dinner. There were some pastry things as well, and some fruit, and some cold meat, and some chicken wings, and something green and salady.” Dean looked pleased, which at least was a very Dean thing to be when someone gave him free food.
“Well, that’s me done for today. Busy times.”
“Hey! That’s mine!
Dean looked down. “It’s a pie. I’m not sure-,”
“Yes. Yes, I would.”
Tears pricking his eyes, Dean pulled him into a hug as he tried to work out what to do. He could just feel Sam’s breathing, so very slow but at least he was still
“Good to know.” he said solemnly. “Will you be joining us today?”
Was he breathing? Dean couldn’t tell. It was dark and it was cold and windy and there were noises from the environment, and Sam was so damned cold to the touch that it was as though he was already several hours dead. But he wasn’t, he couldn’t be, and Dean pressed two fingers against Sam’s neck in a desperate search for a heartbeat. The thick mud that had smeared over his skin wasn’t helping either, a cold muddy disguise in the dark.
“Fine.” Castiel growled, and there was a mark of possession in that word, a threat that suggested that any movements outside of the agreed touches were open to retaliation. Balthazar tilted his head in acknowledgement before turning his attention back to the still desperate Dean in front of him.
“Sorry,” Claire was still studying Dean in fascination. “I mean, look at them. They’re pretty adorable. They need to stay out of my room though, I don’t want sticky fingers over my stuff, and if they’re Winchesters then that stickiness might be some weird goo or bodily fluid or something.”
Dean was clearly spoiling for a fight, and seemed confused when said fight didn’t show. He finally gave another sulky glare in Sam’s direction and then pulled a book toward himself, flicking it open and pretending to read it. Sam wondered briefly how long it would take Dean to realise that it was upside down, before sighing internally. Not worth the stress.
“Yeah, yeah, okay. Well, it needs fluid, and particular fluid. Just not blood.” he looked expectantly at Castiel, whose expression hadn’t got much better. Dean looked between them and waited. And still waited. And - oh, fuck it.
“Sam.”
This appeared to gain some traction. Dean lifted his head slightly, watching him carefully as though Castiel’s suggestion involved some type of horrific physical maiming or perhaps locking him inside yet another cell. Castiel gave him what he hoped was a pleasant smile, although this appeared to have the opposite effect as Dean’s expression grew even more guarded. Perhaps he did not smile enough for this to be persuasive.
-and he never did finish that thought.
Lunch proved to be a continuation of odd things, including more greenery that Dean seemed to be perfectly content with. Castiel eyed him. It was not a bad thing for Dean to obtain a taste for healthier foods, but the sudden change did not settle his nerves.
“You’re welcome.” Another little look. “I’m assuming everything’s fine? Everything’s working?”
it was time. Dusk was upon them and Dean was already delighted with how it was going.
“What on earth-?” Jody raced outside to be confronted by a stunned Sam and a tear filled Dean watching him anxiously. Or at least, watching Sam’s left shin which had met up with an encounter with a rock or a hard place or whatever and was now leaking blood at quite a rapid rate. Two sets of scared eyes turned to her as she crouched down and tried to see the damage through the mud.
“Debatable.” Castiel moved to place a plate and a fork in front of him. “Eat.”
Dean whined softly again under the onslaught, finding the rhythm well enough to move with him but almost dazed by the sheer force inside him that was managing to find sensitive spots he didn’t even know he owned. Silence was impossible, each thrust greeted by a soft gasp-grunt as Castiel worked, and each sensation seemed to blur into each other until it took all his strength not to howl.
Dean narrowed his eyes at him but drank the orange juice anyway. Groaning softly, he nuzzled further into Cas and closed his eyes again. The angel’s arm was warm and wrapped around him and he could feel Castiel’s breath on the back of his neck, and he was fairly certain every so often the light press of a kiss was given but that might just be his imagination. If they were on something that wasn’t a hard wooden surface then he’d vote for staying like this for at least a day-
“The water’s broken? But I just had a shower with no problems,” he lifted his arms to demonstrate his clean and still slightly damp naked body. It was true. He was very showered.
