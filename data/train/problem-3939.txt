"Everything is fine, Benny. Thank you." Castiel took the cloth bag from Benny and set it on the table. He looked back and forth between Dean and Benny. They were both wearing identical hostile expressions. "Benny, do you need to feed?" Castiel whispered. They were interrupted yesterday, so Castiel needed to offer.
"Hunter?"
Dean narrowed his eyes. "Like keep my robe on while we...uhm...consummate?" Castiel fought to keep his face blank.
Sam and Castiel dropped Dean off at the motel room before heading back to the library. He’d done his part, interviewed the victims and gotten what information he could from local PD. Leave it to those two nerds to do the research work.
"When they're done, come get me," the doctor said, already walking away.
"I get off in fifteen minutes."
"What have you seen?"
"You are beautiful, Dean." Castiel lowered his head and began restacking the jars in the box. He felt foolish. Dean already distrusted him for being a witch. How would he feel if he knew Castiel was a gay witch?
"She is free to come and go as she pleases. She is welcome in my home, but she is a wild creature."
"You should eat before it gets cold," Castiel said softly.
"Castiel cares for you, so how I feel about you is irrelevant. I'll do whatever it takes to make him happy even if it means helping you."
He remembered his boots and groaned. "Boots," he mumbled, and Cas pushed him backwards across the bed. Cas knelt down and began untying Dean's boots. He pulled one off and tossed it aside. The sock followed; and then, Cas did something no one else had ever done. He kissed Dean's foot...fuck, he kissed each toe...then the underside which made Dean giggle and try to pull away. "Tickles."
"I'm sure," Dean said softly. "Really sure."
Dean pursed his lips and nodded. Cas spoke up for the first time since Sam called. "I will remain at Dean's side."
"You are a brat."
“I think we have a lot to talk about, Cas,” Dean said with a slight grin.
With a huff of displeasure, Dean upended the cup, held his breath, and gulped it down as quickly as he could. He tried hard not to gag; as, he thrust the mug at Castiel.
"Brighid caused the blizzard, the dead battery in Dean's car, and the blown tire on Benny's truck."
"Gabriel can pass for a human better than some of us," Castiel answered, nodding towards Benny. "He can also disappear if there is danger."
"May these hands be blessed this day. May they always hold each other. May they have the strength to hang on during the storms of stress and the dark of disillusionment. May they remain tender and gentle as they nurture each other in their wondrous love. May they build a relationship founded in love, and rich in caring. May these hands be healer, protector, shelter, and guide for each other."
Dean pulled the pouch out of his jeans, where he'd kept it since he'd left Cas' cabin. He put it on the table and placed it next to the black pouch. "You can keep it."
"How?" Yazhi, the skinwalker, asked.
"Castiel, you can't..."
"Very well." Cas pulled something from his pocket. "Take this."
She lowered her arms and walked to the east. Lifting her arms, she said, "For wisdom, communication, learning, and growth. This I ask of you. So mote it be." Dean looked down at the wisp of incense, a yellow candle, and a feather. The candle's wick caught fire.
The park closed at nightfall, so Bobby and Dean snuck back in after dark. Both victims were last seen leaving the park's gift shop. Dean parked the Impala near the building and at the last minute snagged the amulet and shoved it into his pocket. Dean was dressed like a ranger, and Bobby took cover in the shadows. Dean came around the corner whistling, hands in pockets, looking casual. A woman stepped out of the darkness. "Excuse me, ma'am, the park is closed," Dean said authoritatively.
Rose Quartz is supposed to draw love to you. Noticed that he put that in Dean's pouch.
"What...like beauty cream?"
He sat the incense down by the candle and raised his arms to the sky. He did not feel the cold. He felt the breeze on his skin, heard the trees whispering, and when he inhaled, he could smell flowers. He smiled softly before picking up the red candle. He took it to the southern candle and sat it down.
"No. I"ve got some business to take care of. I'll catch up with Dad in a few days."
Castiel parked the snowmobile next to his motorcycle, now covered in snow and ice. Inside, they shed their coats and other outerwear. Dean went over to the fireplace and began laying a fire, while Castiel went to find them a meal. No words were needed as they moved around the cabin. Dean set the table, and Cas poured water into mugs. Dean even fed Pierce as Castiel poured his quickly prepared chicken and dumplings into bowls.
"Anything, Dean. Anything you want...it's yours." Dean gave a brief nod and then looked down. Castiel followed his eyes. Using his thumb and forefinger, Dean began moving Castiel's foreskin up and down. Castiel moaned as the sensation made his hands tremble. To keep them steady, he moved them over Dean's chest, rubbing over the tight buds of his nipples.
"Casper...but Sam..." But if he hadn't been chasing the imaginary wendigo, he wouldn't have met Cas. He stopped in his tracks, closed his eyes and worried his bottom lip with his teeth. Cas. He'd have never met Cas, and that was suddenly very important.
Cas crawled onto the bed, hooking his fingers into Dean's underwear, as he moved up Dean's legs. Dean lifted his ass to help. He might hate his flabby belly, but he was proud of his cock. It was longer than Cas', but Cas' was thicker...and uncut. How had he not noticed that? Cas caught him comparing and gave him an amused look. "Yes, Dean, yours is bigger."
"Yes," Castiel answered. "He knows what I am and what Benny is." Kate whipped her head around to Benny.
"I am a Hedge Witch. I use what the earth has provided for us to heal...to do...good. I inherited my powers and my love of the earth from my grandmother. Mother, Lucifer, and the coven prefer the darker arts."
"Your woods?" Dean sank back into the hot water, not willing to admit to the witch, the tea had made him feel warmer.
"I don't lie."
For an instant, everyone was frozen in shock, but then John raised his gun again. "No," Dean cried out and knocked Castiel to the ground. The shot echoed, and the mirror behind the bar exploded into flying shards.
Benny went back to screwing in the new lens for his headlight. Castiel wanted to retract his words. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said anything."
Dean narrowed his eyes. "Was that a joke?"
Castiel nodded sagely. "He's a good man."
Dean pulled his car keys out of his pocket and unlocked the car. With a small wave, he slammed the door.
"Four days," Dean screeched. "Son of a bitch." Dean started pacing again, causing the cat to hiss and leap to higher ground. "Cas, we can't...Sam just left. He can't take off work again...and I can't just up and get married without him. He's my brother. And then there's Bobby. I mean, he could probably drive down again...it's only about eight hours, but Sam. No, we'll have to wait until the next waxy moon."
"Thank you for coming to help Dean."
Knowing if he thought about this too much, he'd freak out, Dean slipped off the bed and dropped to his knees. He looked up at Cas while he unbuttoned Cas' jeans. Cas' hand covered his, hindering them. They didn't speak, and Dean tried to project everything he was feeling into his eyes. Cas let go and brushed his fingers through Dean's hair. Getting the zipper down with someone sitting was difficult, but Dean managed. It definitely didn't look as smooth and sexy as he wanted. Now, he had to get past the underwear. Porn made this look so damn easy. Cas finally seemed to take pity on him and leaned back, effectively shoving his jeans and boxers down to mid-thigh. Dean pulled off the man's boots and stripped off his socks before pulling his pants all the way off.
Dean looked stunned. "Oh."
"Yeah, he planned on just following it. Bobby will make sure Dad is settled in and keep us updated."
"Benny, go."
Dean cleared his throat. "Yeah, uhm, my dad drives a black, GMC pickup with Kansas plates. He's about six-two, dark hair, beard. Gordon is black, shady looking, has a 'stache and a goatee."
The ride back to town was tense. All he wanted to do was wrap his arms around Cas and hold on...and it wasn't just to stay on the snowmobile as it bounced over the snowy terrain. It was figuratively too. He wanted to hold on to Cas and never let him go. Why? He wasn't fuckin' sure, but it felt right. This man who saved his life; who treated him with respect and kindness despite being an enemy of his kind; who had him feeling things he'd never felt before.
you been spending time doing, hmmmm?" Gabriel's eyebrows waggled suggestively, and Castiel felt his skin flush with embarrassment. He tried an eye roll to keep Gabriel from continuing this line of questioning, but Gabriel was quick. The archangel smirked. Castiel picked up the shot glass to avoid answering. Just as he was bringing it to his lips, Dean and Benny came in. Dean still looked shell-shocked, and Castiel supposed he couldn't blame him. He hadn't had a fit of temper like that since he left the coven.
His hips were moving on their own accord now, rolling up to fuck into Cas' mouth. He couldn't stop if he tried. The feeling was indescribable. "Cas...Cas...oh, Babe..." He stared down at Cas and watched him pull off to lick his own fingers before he went down on Dean's cock again. The wet touch at his hole, made Dean sit bolt upright. He'd been with men before, but not like that.
Cas' name was more of a hiss as his orgasm hit him. He rode it out, hand slowing until he was just holding his softening cock. He needed to get up and wipe the cum off his belly, but that would require him to actually move. Instead, he took the far corner of the sheet and cleaned himself up. It probably wouldn't be the first time housekeeping had to launder spunk out of these sheets.
"You are not a bad person, Dean." Dean stared down at their hands.
"You love him," Bobby said quietly.
The archangel reached down for it. When he held it in his hands, he smiled. "I'd heard rumors."
"Complicated is a status on Facebook, Dean. What the fuck is going on?"
"I come into the Circle of the Ancients, a Circle of Light, and welcome familial spirits, this Samhain night." He lit the central candle and bowed his head. The air seemed to crackle with static electricity. The cold wind whipped around the circle, unfelt by those within it.
"I understand," Castiel murmured and reached for his outerwear. Pierce mewled softly and rubbed her body around his ankles. She was out of sorts. It had been just the two of them for so long...three if you added the occasional visit from Chara. Having Dean here was unsettling for her...and for him, if he was to be honest.
"That would probably be a good idea," Gabriel chimed in. Castiel stayed quiet. He didn't know why, but he trusted Dean. He could understand his friends' concerns though.
Selfishly, Castiel wanted him to stay and wait for the part to be delivered. He was disappointed when Dean accepted the ride from his friend. Benny turned to Castiel, "Can you watch the store for a couple of hours?"
Both men rounded on the witch. "No, Cas..."
They'd reached the edge of town and the aunts headed straight for Gabriel's bar. As they filed in, Gabriel grinned. "Ladies...you are looking as beautiful as ever."
Dean put his backpack on the bed and waiting until Cas' back was turned, he packed the pouch of colored stones. He removed Cas' warm woolen socks and laid them on the bed. After one more look around the small cabin, he cleared his throat. "I'm ready."
Pierce, her green eyes blinking slowly, jumped to the bed and sniffed the man’s slightly damp hair. Castiel’s patient mumbled something and Castiel came closer. The patient's eyes opened, shut, and opened again. Castiel was mesmerized by his emerald eyes…so mesmerized he didn’t realize the man had spoke.
"He won't be able to find his way back, will he?" Benny asked, staring at Dean through the windshield.
Dean might be brash and obnoxious, but he knew when to stop. It was obvious talking about his family upset Castiel. Dean went back to his soup. Castiel had already finished; and now, he was putting labeled jars into a small box. "What's that?"
"Your body is perfect, Dean."
Dean wrapped his hand around Castiel's rapidly growing erection and broke eye contact. There was a moment's hesitation, and Castiel closed his own fingers around Dean's and drew back the foreskin. "Dean..." Castiel stopped thinking. Dean had taken him in his mouth, and the wet heat engulfed him. Watching Dean was almost better than feeling Dean. Maybe that's why people fell in love. Sex was good and could be great, but loving your partner made things more intense.
"When I gave you the damn thing, I thought you were capable of taking care of it," John snapped. Dean could feel the muscle in the side of his jaw tic, but he didn't speak. His father didn't stop there. "You got a girl?"
Cas' cock was only half hard because, well, watching a man fight with a zipper wasn't erection worthy. It definitely looked different. The time he'd seen it before...up close...it was hard. How did he even start? Blowjobs weren't usually on the list of something he'd performed with his male hookups. Sure, he was on the receiving end more times than he could count, but he reciprocated with handjobs. Only when he was guilted into it, did he go down on a man. At least he knew what to do though...but Cas was uncut...
"Yes, I was," Cas said, teeth flashing in the pale light. They both gathered the wood and stacked it by the railing. When they were done, Cas opened the door and the men burst into the room. Pierce eyed them disdainfully from her perch on the window seal. Dean pulled off his gloves and shrugged off his coat. His arms still felt like jelly, but he'd die before he complained.
They answered questions, and Dean handed them his credit card for the payment information. Or Patrick Hunt's credit card, if one was honest. And he wasn't. When they were done, a chaplain came to see them. "I'm Father Davis, but you can call me Mike. Our social worker is gone for the night, but I can answer questions you might have about your father's future care."
"Dean, you're having a bad dream. Just a bad dream."
Barefoot, Castiel walked over to a small basket he'd prepared in the early morning hours before he'd left to prepare for the ceremony. He brought it back into the circle and knelt on his robe. He reached up his hand and with one more quick look around the meadow, Dean allowed himself to be pulled to his knees.
"I have to find the answer, Dean. Stay here." And he was on the move again, this time heading into the forest.
He couldn't help it, he laughed so hard he snorted a few times. It was the kind of bent over, slap your knees laughter. Benny tried to look pissed off, but soon he was chuckling softly. For a moment, Dean forgot his father...forgot Benny was a vampire...and just enjoyed the humor in the situation.
"Dean, will you share in Castiel’s laughter and look for the brightness and positive in him?" Dean's answer was correct this time. Mab wrapped the ribbon again.
"Everyone lies. Was it some sort of love potion?"
Castiel couldn't respond to Benny. He moved past Gabriel and reached out his hand to Dean. Dean sneered and scrambled to his feet, blatantly ignoring Castiel's help. It cut him deep, but Castiel wouldn't let it show.
"I've got to go...out..." He strode to the door and grabbed his coat.
"So, there's a werewolf, a vampire, and a fallen archangel...and you. Anything else live around here?"
"Cas can go with us..." Dean said, then his eyebrows came together. "Wait, what happened to Gordon's...uhm...body?"
He closed the outhouse door. He dreaded taking his dick in his cold hand and pulling it out into the freezing air. He groaned and took care of business quickly.
Dean nodded awkwardly. "Okay, so...where can I find him? I didn't see a sheriff's office."
Dean stood stock still. "Husband...I'm your husband," he said, his voice full of awe. Castiel moved closer, taking Dean's face in his hands.
He stepped into the tub and sighed. The water was the perfect temperature. He lowered himself into the water and picked up the bar of soap. It smelled like lemons. He'd seen the recipe in Cas' grimoire. "This is pretty cool."
"Does it have four wheel drive?" Castiel asked, an eyebrow quirking upwards. Dean scowled again. Castiel realized he missed Dean's smile, his off color jokes, the warmth in his eyes. "Come with me." He waited while Dean shut and locked the Impala's door before leading Dean around the back of the store. Across a narrow yard sat a barn. Castiel removed the heavy chain that kept the doors closed. When he swung them open, Dean pulled his gun out of the waistband of his jeans. "There isn't anything in here that would harm you, Dean."
"I was hoping you would join me," Castiel murmured, still feeling shy around Dean. They'd been intimate and shared a growing love for each other, but sex was still new and unexplored. Dean wasn't as experienced with men and Castiel found it endearing. It was, also, intimidating. What if Dean found out he didn't like being in a monogamous relationship with a man. No more soft breasts or smooth faces...or slick folds to bury his cock into...no children.
"It's not likely, not with the medical issues your father had. This could have happened behind the wheel of his car or while he was getting out of bed in the morning." The doctor stood. "You can see him, but I want to get your own injuries looked at first."
The Goddess faded before his eyes. He wasn't sure how long he stayed on his knees. A warm tongue licked his ear, and he gave the wolf a sad smile. "Mo Chara," Castiel whispered at the rare show of affection from the beast. "It is time." He couldn't put it off anymore. Dusk had settled over the forest.
Castiel plodded along steadily. He had questions. He dreaded the answers. His grandmother couldn't have meant Dean. Dean was...Dean. A hunter. They were polar opposites. When he got to the small clearing, he realized he'd forgotten his tools. Drawing on his power, he gathered some winter berries, a few pine boughs, and some stones that were buried under the snow. He placed them down and used his feet to mark a circle.
With a soft groan, Dean held his hands out and Castiel took them, curling his fingers around Dean's. "I need you to concentrate on Sam. Picture his location in your mind. Picture him in your mind."
Castiel's mind went back in time. Dean always covered his stomach, turned his back, made sure he was dressed completely before coming out from behind the curtain. Dean was self-conscious about his soft stomach. Of all the stupid...Castiel felt angry, but knew showing Dean anger wasn't going to help the situation.
"No...witch...touch...me," John uttered, his left hand reached out and grabbed Dean's arm in a death grip.
"A vision, huh?" Dean asked, letting his boots drop to the floor with a thunk. He sat down and folded his hands on the table. He met Castiel's eyes and then turned them expectantly at Missouri.
He couldn't delay this any longer. "Thanks, Cas. Thanks for everything." Their breaths showed in puffs of vapor in the frozen air.
The wolf fell into step beside him. Once he crossed the old railroad tracks, his friend stopped. Castiel nodded, and she ran back in the other direction. She would not get close to people, it was her way. Castiel kept walking. He heard a baby crying in the distance. He smiled. New life was always a blessing.
"He's in the back. Let me get a nurse." She stood up and walked through a set of doors. Dean rubbed the back of his neck, trying to ease the tense muscles. He looked over at Sam. They hadn't had a chance to talk and now their father was in a hospital, probably fighting for his life.
"Remember when you said I was perfect?" Cas nodded. "Yeah, well, so are you. Just the way you are. Got it?"
"The smart thing to do would be to drive to Casper tonight; get a new battery, come back here, and then get on the road," Gordon said, a sneer resting on his lips.
Castiel rolled them, so that Dean was on top. He gazed up at him. "I want you."
"Thanks, but you don't have to...pretty sure I can find my way." Dean shoveled another huge bite into his mouth. He was wearing a milk mustache, and any other time, Castiel would have smiled.
The negative energy at the table was causing Castiel to feel claustrophobic. He wanted to be outside. He was having a hard time keeping his breathing even. His leg was against Dean's, more for his own benefit than Dean's. When Dean asked for a whiskey, Castiel wasn't happy. Dean needed to stay focused. This wasn't going well.
"Yes."
"Uh, huh," Castiel said softly.
“They were wet and frozen. I removed them to keep you from freezing to death.” Okay, the blue-eyed man was talking to him like he was the village idiot.
"Your father?"
"I must have gotten lost," she purred, stepping closer to Dean. His machete was hidden under his coat in a shoulder holster he'd designed himself. His hand itched to pull it out, but he needed to be sure he was lopping off the head of a creature and not an innocent bystander.
"You have friends?" Castiel finally looked up from his bowl and glared at Dean. His blue eyes, normally so serene, were flashing with irritation. The saying about people looking sexy when they were mad must have found its roots in Castiel. Dean swallowed, then licked his lips.
Sometime later, Castiel's finger brushed over the stitches on Dean's arm. He remembered that he wanted to put some of his healing balm on it and moved to sit up. "Hey, where are you going?" Dean asked, pulling on Castiel's hand to hold him in place. They had since moved so their heads were on the pillows.
Gabriel looked at the Colt for a few more seconds before putting it behind the bar. Together, Gabriel and Castiel sat at the bar to wait.
He heard the sound of an engine and tried to steady his nerves. He reached into his pocket and touched the pouch of stones with his fingertips. He somehow managed to look up in surprise, as his father pulled the truck next to the Impala. Bobby's truck with it's flat tires sat on the other side.
The meeting continued on for another twenty minutes. Most were confident Castiel would keep them safe.
"Gordon Walker," Dean muttered. "He's a loose cannon. Doesn't care about anyone but himself. I've had some run-ins with him."
Castiel tried to calm his racing heart. Dean would be back to protect him. But from who? Another hunter?"
Dean glanced down at it and used his thumb and forefinger to rip the tape off. He winced as the adhesive caught and pulled out the hair on his arm. Castiel ran his thumb over the five neatly sewn stitches. "After our bath, I will put some healing balm on it."
"We can make it work, Cas." It was time to bring out the big guns. Dean stepped closer and took Cas' hands in his. "Please, Cas, give me a chance." He pulled the puppy dog eyes out of his arsenal.
Castiel sat up against the headboard; while, Dean puttered around the kitchen. Pierce was mewling and rubbing against Dean's legs. "You...I'm not talking to you this morning. Watching like that...it's perverted...okay, maybe just kinky. Your daddy needs to think seriously about getting you a boyfriend." Once Dean had the stove going and the eggs cooking along with some of the thick cut bacon Castiel got from Benny's store, he opened a can of tuna and dumped it in the cat's bowl. Castiel would have been happy to watch Dean all day long just moving around Castiel's cabin and making it his own.
Dean's father walked him to the Impala. After getting rid of the buru buru, they'd taken another case in south Texas. After being with John for seven days, Dean was emotional and physically exhausted. When they got close, John frowned and walked around the car. "You need to get this fuckin' salt off the paint, Dean. When was the last time you washed this car?"
"Bobby told me a story of a town where supernatural creatures could live in peace. Lafitte is that town, isn't it?"
"I'm sorry..."
The crunch of snow beneath their shoes was the only sound. Dean saw the wolf following in the treeline. "Your friend is following us."
One by one, the people of the town gathered. The story was told over and over again, until everyone knew the threat was over. It was close to midnight when the beams from a pair of headlights flashed in the lone window in the front of the bar. Castiel stood up. He hadn't sensed John Winchester's demise and neither had Missouri, but he knew Dean's father would never be the same. He wondered how it would affect Dean, and a small knot of fear rose in his chest.
After he finished his fourth beer, Dean stalked up to the mirror again. He untied the towel and bared himself to the mirror and its criticisms.
"Dad, Gabriel is an angel...an archangel," Sam supplied. Sam stepped to his father's side and touched Gabriel's arm. Gabriel met Sam's eyes and the archangel slowly removed his hand. John pulled himself up to his full height. Faced with a heavenly being, most would feel awe...maybe even bow down. John Winchester's lip curled in a scowl before finding Dean.
Cas nodded, but pushed the amulet back towards Dean. "Please keep this one. It will keep you safe, and that's all I want for you." If it really kept Dean from being killed by the Arachne, then Dean should keep it. But he wasn't sure. He had to think and sitting across from Cas made that almost impossible.
Castiel tilted his head and touched his lips to Dean's. He vowed that Dean would always know the power of his love, and he sent his thoughts through the kiss. While chaste, he knew Dean could feel the hum of Castiel's very core. They pulled back, mere inches, eyes holding. "I love you, Dean."
"Pure?"
"Those were fucking fairies, Cas," Dean swore, staring at the door like he expected them to come back and have their way with him.
Cas was standing in the middle of the floor when he pushed open the door. Dean's smile faded at Cas' face.
"Your cat is watching us...did she watch us the whole...time?" Dean couldn't break the cat's stare, and he was feeling really exposed.
"Is this part of the ritual?" Dean murmured, leaning in to breath in Castiel's scent.
"Cas, can we talk?"
He got within three feet from the hunter and Dean whirled around. "I won't choose between you and my father, Cas. I can't," Dean snarled, and Castiel tried not to take it personally.
He opened the door with a flourish. "Ta da."
“Where the fuck are my clothes?”
Lilura, or at least Dean thought that was her name, moved forward and touched his face. He tried to move away, but Cas' hand was holding him. "You cover your insecurities with humor. Don't be afraid of your destiny, child. Castiel is truly good. You will have a strong, unbreakable bond." She closed her eyes, her touch warm on his face. Everyone stood perfectly still, like they were waiting on pins and needles. She opened her eyes, smiled at Dean, and then turned to her sisters. Dean saw a smile on her face and the women all seemed to relax. Dean looked at Cas questioningly.
"I'm sorry. Do you think you left your lights on?" Castiel asked.
"I do not need electricity," came the soft reply.
Cas looked on in amusement. Benny's voice lowered to a whisper. "I learned something new, thanks to you. I don't think I will ever get those images out of my head."
"I will protect the town." Castiel will cast a wide circle that will make Lafitte invisible to humans. It will take a lot of power. It will physically drain him, but it must be done. Benny was right, Dean would bring more hunters.
Dean, will you share in Castiel’s burdens so that your spirits may grow in this union?" Dean responded and another wrap was made with the ribbon. Mab finished the ceremony, with both men pledging to share each other's dreams, to use their anger to temper the strength of their marriage, to honor each other as equals. With each pledge, another wrap was made.
On the morning of the ceremony, Dean woke to find the bed empty again. Cas wasn't in the cabin, and he wasn't in the outhouse, because Dean banged open the door. He took care of business and then walked around the clearing. Since they hadn't had any fresh snow fall in several days, there was no way to make out Cas' footprints among all the others. He was going to call out, but remembered the Christian tradition about the bride and groom not seeing each other before the ceremony. Dean wasn't sure if witches followed the same tradition, but he figured someone would come get him when he was needed.
While Dean punched in the number and waited for the call to go through, Benny moved closer to Castiel. He whispered, "Is he leaving?"
After they'd collected themselves, Benny got his satellite phone out and called Gabriel. Benny opened the tailgate, and both men sat down to wait. Gabriel appeared seconds later. "A flat tire? Seriously? I was scripting out my newest film and was right in the middle of the money shot scene when you called. Talk about coitus interruptus."
"So, you're Cas..."
"Making a burn salve," Castiel replied. He could almost feel Dean's body heat, and he could definitely smell him. Dean's scent was a mixture of pine, commercial soap, and a muskiness that was all male. Castiel's nostrils flared. "I know you will be bored and uncomfortable here...I have some books..."
"She will turn back as we get closer to town." Dean sighed. Cas was bound and determined to make this difficult for him. "Look, Cas, about yesterday...it's none of my business who you..."
"No, Dean. You have to listen. It isn't what you think." Dean's mirthless laugh confused Castiel until he replayed his words. He groaned. He'd used a line said by cheating partners everywhere. Only he wasn't cheating, and Dean wasn't his partner. "Dean, why are you here?" Castiel repeated.
"Delaying this thing between us is probably for the best." And didn't Cas sound all authoritative all of a sudden? Dean would have chuckled at his own rhetorical question, but the situation they found themselves in wasn't in the least funny.
"But if you put the whole invisibility cloak on the town, how do they find it?"
Dean took offense to Cas' words. "I am not scared, Cas. I've had sex before."
The doctor and nurse left them alone. "Smooth, Sammy."
"Cas, you need to stop talking or else I'm going to come right here and now." Cas' fingers froze halfway inside of him. "No...God, please don't stop." After a second's hesitation, Cas begin to move again. Dean wanted to touch...to feel the slickness...the heat. Tentatively, he reached out his forefinger. He started at the erogenous zone under Cas' balls, and he heard Cas' swift intake of air. Feeling braver, he let it slide down until he brushed Cas' hand. "Can I?"
"Hmmm?"
Cas held something in his hands and held it aloft.
Seated across from Cas, Dean piled several pancakes onto his plate. "Where's the syrup?"
"Oh," Castiel murmured. Did that mean Dean was leaving in the morning? His appetite disappeared, and he put his spoon on the table. Seconds that seemed like hours ticked by.
Before Benny could speak, Castiel said, "Benny got a bit angry at Dean and let it show."
Dean accepted Castiel's answer and trudged on. They were on the road now, not just the dirt track that led to Castiel's home. It was easier to walk, and they were soon at the town's edge. Dean's car still sat in front of the store. There was snow on it, but it looked like Benny had blown off most of it. The small bell tinkled lightly when Castiel pushed open the door to the store. Benny stepped out of the back room. "Castiel." His smile faded. "Winchester."
Seeing Cas when he walked in the door lifted the weight off of his shoulders. Cas was a part of his life now, whether or not, he deserved it. All he wanted at that minute was to feel Cas' arms around him, keeping him safe. It was a stupid thought, Dean was a hunter. He was the one who could protect Cas, not the other way around. Irrational as it seemed, Dean needed Cas.
"Left there yesterday. Took care of the nest and got a lead on a case in Oklahoma. Head in that direction. Call when you're close." The line went dead. Dean stared at the handset still gripped in his fist.
"Last time I was in Wyoming, I had an...an accident. A witch saved my life..."
The sheriff leaned back in the chair and crossed one booted foot over the other. "Why are you still here?"
Pain sliced through Castiel. Dean's words, so full of contempt, eviscerated him. He couldn't look up into those beautiful eyes...that perfect face. He couldn't look up and see the hatred he knew was there. "With a good night's rest, you'll be able to leave tomorrow. I will walk you to your vehicle." Castiel walked past Dean and got his coat. Castiel pulled on his heavy boots and gloves, and then wrapped the scarf around his neck. Without pausing, he stepped past Dean. "You should get inside and stay warm."
"I just need to get in touch with my brother and my...friend."
"Yeah, right," Dean muttered and with a sigh, he dialed Sam's cell. After he talked to his brother, he sheepishly approached Benny again, who was stacking jars of peanut butter. "Hey...Cas mentioned you had internet access..."
Dean shrugged. "Yeah, cool."
Sleep didn't come that night. Castiel spent the night warding his home and the surrounding forest against evil, both spiritual and manmade.
"It matters to him. It matters to me and Sam." Dean brought his eyes back to Bobby's.
Cas' magick mirror came to life with swirls of red. With all the crap Dean had seen over his lifetime, he shouldn't have been surprised seeing Sam and his father on the mirror's smooth surface. He was though. When he uttered his expletive, the image was gone and all he saw was glossy black.
"Speaking of money shots...I had an idea for some three-way action...man on man on man," the angel said, leering comically at them.
"Of course, Dr. O'Brien."
"No," Castiel stated flatly. "He can't."
Was he really getting old? Dean leaned forward to look at his face. Sure he saw himself in the mirror every day, in a different motel room in a different town. But he never really looked.
"I thought you would want to come into town and talk to Gabriel," Benny said to Castiel. Dean looked at Benny quizzically.
"Aunt Nimue, would you like another drink?" Cas appeared behind Dean, his hands on Dean's shoulders. "Gabriel will be happy to get you whatever you want. Now, can you excuse us for a few minutes?" Cas took Dean's arm and pulled him up to stand next to him. Dean let himself be led out the door. Before the door had even banged shut, Dean was talking.
Benny cleared his throat, and Castiel's gaze left Dean. "I see you finished the order."
As he lay in bed that night, he wondered where Dean was. He would have to perform the ritual soon, but as long as Dean carried the amulet, he'd be able to find the town easily. He couldn't tell Benny that though. While he couldn't make the town invisible, the spell he cast kept those intending harm away.
"Dean, my power is not used for anything malicious. As I've told you before, I help heal the sick and do my best to keep my friends safe. I consider you a friend." A friend Castiel found himself dreaming of, but Dean could never know about that.
They were at the crossroads when Dean remembered his curse...or whatever it was. "The Goddess won't let me go." He looked at Benny, panic setting in.
Opening his eyes, Dean saw the creature again, standing over him. He moaned and tried to get away, but he was so weak and so very tired. Did one dream in heaven…or hell? Dean saw himself walking down the halls of a hospital corridor. A doctor in cowboy boots smiled at him. It must be heaven because Dr. Sexy was there.
Once Dean was around the corner, he hit the steering wheel with his fist. He was glad his father was heading to New York after a possible Vetala. He was heading to South Dakota to meet with Bobby about a couple of strange deaths near Mount Rushmore. Hunting with his father was getting harder and he wanted to avoid it as best he could. Hands still shaking with suppressed anger, Dean touched the amulet and thought of Cas. He felt calmer by the time he hit Dallas.
Castiel deposited Dean unceremoniously on the bed before going back to the stove. The aroma of soup was nice, and Dean's stomach gurgled softly. "Hey, Cas, why do you live like a freakin' hermit?" Tact was never Dean's strong suit, and he wasn't ever going to change. The sooner the witch got that, the easier things would be. Dean saw the other man's shoulders stiffen, but he didn't turn around. Cas didn't say anything for such a long time that Dean thought he was being ignored.
Dean ripped his t-shirt off in anger, standing before the angel in just the towel.
"Not that type of hunter," Castiel said softly. Comprehension showed in Benny's eyes.
“No, Dean. But that was eight years ago, a significant passage of time for a human. Your bodies change constantly over a lifetime. The closer you get to forty…”
"No, my brother, Lucifer, couldn't boil water."
"Castiel, Dean doesn't say those words unless he really means them," Sammy said. Castiel had forgotten his presence for a second and was embarrassed by revealing his heartache. He turned to look at the tall, younger man.
He gripped the man’s arms and the wolf sank his teeth into the thick material of the man's sodden coat. Together they began to inch backwards. Once Castiel sensed safety, he got to his feet. Using the collar of the man’s coat, he began pulling him towards the cabin. The man wasn’t small, by any means, and his wet clothing made the weight heavier.
"Just thinking," Dean said softly.
"Alright. When are we doing this?" Castiel was amazed Dean seemed to be taking this so well. His first response had been a bit frightening.
Castiel tried not to react to Dean's use of the word 'home,' but it gave him a warm feeling in the pit of his stomach.
"Shit." Dean huffed and bent down to scratch behind the cat's ears. "Good..uhm...girl." Pierce preened and bumped her head against Dean's hand. He gave her a pat and then picked up the mouse by its tail. Castiel gave him a scrap of muslin, he used for making sachets and bath soaks. Carefully, Dean rolled the material around the mouse. "Yo, see, cat...loving the present." Dean put the bundle into his coat pocket with a grimace.
"Welcome to my humble establishment. The menu's on the wall," Gabriel said, pointing to a chalkboard. The only things listed were hamburgers and chili. Sam and Cas pulled two tables together; and with a brief scraping of chair legs, the men sat down. Instead of coming out from behind the bar, Gabriel called to them. "Beers all around? Something stronger?"
"I've called this meeting tonight because we had a hunter appear a few days ago." The buzz turned into an angry drone. Castiel watched as faces hardened or turned fearful. "He was injured and Castiel helped him recover." All eyes turned to Castiel, and he kept his face bland. "He left. Castiel doesn't think he will be back, but I want all of you to keep your eyes and ears open. Castiel will perform another ritual soon to keep out those that wish us harm."
When the machine pulled up behind Benny's store, Cas cut the engine. They pulled off their helmets, and Cas lifted his chin like he was sniffing the air. "Someone is here."
"You still have that used Pontiac?"
Cas pushed in another finger and Dean let a whimper escape. "With a penis your size, four fingers should suffice to give the muscle ample..."
"Nimue." Her hair was black as well, but more of a matte black. It was longer though, reaching halfway down her back.
"Dean..."
"That was quick."
She shimmered before him, seeming to float above the snow. Her moss green mantle and golden braids bright against the white landscape. "I spoke the truth."
"Motherfucker...so, we're stuck?"
Dean jutted out his chin belligerently. "You kill anyone and I'll be back to take you out."
"No...no need," Cas was panting now; because, their fingers hadn't stopped moving.
"Phone? Running water?" Dean asked, still reeling from anyone not living in this century.
"Gabriel..." Benny warned. Dean looked from the vampire to the angel and back again.
Dean swallowed and nodded. "Yes, I do, Cas. I'm just kind of nervous." Cas' thumbs were rubbing circles on the skin of his inner thighs and when he focused on that, Dean felt his heart rate slow. Without loosing eye contact, Cas reached for the wicker basket and pulled out the jar of oil.
"Castiel, Dean, look at your hands." They obeyed. "These are the hands of your best friend, strong and vibrant with the love you feel for each other. These hands will work beside you as you build your future. These are hands that will wipe tears, comfort you in illness, and hold you in fear or grief. Cherish them."
About halfway back to the cabin, Dean had to lean against a tree to catch his breath. Castiel was so far ahead of him that he couldn't see him anymore. "Fuck."
"Be gone forever, for this I will say. This is my sacred place, and you will obey."
Castiel finally turned around. "They are a coven of witches, Dean. I could never hide. So far, they have left me be. The soup is ready." Dean had to respect the subject change, but he was damn curious. Castiel put Dean's bowl on a wooden tray and brought it to the bed.
His vision blurred with tears, and he angrily brushed him away. "You said he would always need me," he yelled to the sky. He'd never spoke to his Goddess like this, and he expected to feel her wrath. He even prepared for it, but it never came.
"And nobody else in town can let him drink? What about the guy that owns the bar? Why does it have to be you?"
After lighting the easternmost candle, he chanted, "I come into the Circle of Air, the Circle of Change. Let the old be transformed, by spirit rearranged." Castiel sat down an olive branch as a symbol of peace.
"You say that every year," Castiel said affectionately.
"Bobby, I can't be what he needs."
“My apologies, Dean. You’re only 37. I didn’t mean to insinuate that you’re older than you are,” Castiel amended.
"Yeah, well, we're just damn lucky Sam isn't here. His farts would knock a buzzard off a shit wagon."
Dean pinched the offensive flesh repeatedly, looking at himself in utter disgust. When had he allowed this to happen? He was suddenly glad John Winchester was not around to criticize him for this.
"Yes, but maybe I can come back to see you this summer."
Castiel bent to pick up the amulet. In a soft voice, he said, "Did you have this on you when you were attacked by the Arachne?"
"You let all your friends suck your blood?"
"Kate," Benny nodded. Castiel accepted Kate's gentle touch on his back.
Dean looked angry. "You don't love me, Cas. You can't. This is just your Goddess' influence, that's all. She's filled our heads with this mumbo jumbo about fate...true mates...it's all a bunch of crap."
"I unloaded on him at the hospital, Cas. Really fuckin' unloaded. What kind of person does that to someone who's in a fuckin' hospital bed?"
The cool air of the room hit his steam warmed skin causing it to pebble with goosebumps immediately. He walked over to the dresser where he’d set his duffle to grab his sleep pants and a clean t-shirt. Just as he was about to loosen the towel, his hands stilled.
They rounded a bend in the road, crossed a rickety bridge, and then he could see Cas' cabin in the distance. He was off the bike before Cas had a chance to shut off the ignition. He watch Cas dismount from the bike and yes, he did check out the man's legs and ass...because of the damn spell.
"I'm sorry," Cas whispered and stepped back. "I...I think I will go to bed."
"I can't answer that, Dean. Only you can, but if you're asking my advice...I can give it."
Inhaling Cas' scent as they held each other, it hit Dean. He might be in love with this man...this witch. Instead of scaring him, it confused him. They hadn't even had sex yet. Only kissed once – well, more than once, but it was only one occasion.
Just like that, huh? He just says yes, Dean like it’s no big deal.
There it was again, that little twitch of the witch's lips showing amusement. Dean's smile was there for an instant before he realized what he was doing, and it was replaced with a scowl.
Dean remembered Cas standing naked in the snow and his cock lengthened. He let his fingertips trace the veins running up his shaft. What would it be like to fuck a witch? Or be fucked by one? Dean used his thumb to wipe the drop of precum away from his slit and tasted himself. Why couldn't he get Cas out of his mind?
The six of them gathered around a table and ran through all the possible scenarios. Castiel was glad Gabriel didn't bring up the memory wiping idea.
Castiel grinned as he backed down the ladder, forcing Dean ahead of him. "No."
"Better than okay, Dean." Cas leaned over and kissed the top of Dean's head. Dean's fingers drifted closer to Cas' flaccid cock. "I can get that taken care of. I’m sure Arif can do it."
"Stay put. I’m going to make you breakfast." Castiel watched as Dean got up and found his boxers on the floor. "Where would I find them?"
"They're coming."
"It is an amulet for safe travels. If you don't want to wear it, at least leave it in your car." Dean stared down at the tiny bag. Black with small crystals hanging off it and a charm of some sort. A pentagram with silver feathers. "It is filled with herbs and stones to ward off danger."
"Yeah..." Dean shrugged. "Best as can be expected, I guess."
"Shut up, Cas," Dean said gruffly. Could the guy read minds?
"Yeah, I wanted to apologize...for the way I acted." Dean had another coughing fit, and Castiel held out a mug. Dean looked at it suspiciously.
He must have fallen asleep sometime in the wee hours of the morning; because when he woke, the sun was streaming into the windows. He scanned the room. Cas wasn't there. The cat was weaving around the rungs of the ladder. Dean crawled out of bed and padded across the rough, wooden floor. Surprisingly enough, the old thing didn't creak as Dean put his weight on it. At an inch over six feet, it only took Dean three steps until he could see over the edge. Cas sat cross-legged in the middle of the floor.
"By herb, stone, and your protection, return him safely to his home."
As he led the circle of friends clockwise, the candles flared higher. Smiles and soft laughter greeted his searching eyes. The Samhain ritual marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter. In Wyoming, winter could be harsh, but those of Lafitte would be protected and safe.
Before Dean could come up with a smartass answer, the truck swerved and Benny gripped the wheel. "What the..."
He stood in the center of the circle, hands aloft. Seconds ticked by and Brighid did not appear. Had he insulted her? Was she angry with him?
"I'm sorry, Dean. What are you going to do now?"
Castiel flung pinches of thyme, yarrow, and cinnamon onto the now charred letter. Taking the bowl, he once again climbed the ladder and opened the small window. Calling to the wind, he flung the ashes and herbs into the breeze. He watched the particles dance and then disappear.
"Handfasting? It is a symbolic ritual. It binds our hands together as we say our vows to each other," Castiel informed him, knowing Dean wouldn't care about the history of the ceremony.
"I'm making soup. I don't think you'll be able to each much of anything else."
"And every year it's bad."
Dean flipped him off, but laughed along with him. Benny assured him earlier Bobby had arrived in town and was going to be there. At least part of his family would be present.
"Cas...uhm...proposed and we're getting hitched in four days. Can you be here?"
"I'll ask around," Benny murmured, obviously wanting the matter dropped.
"No. It's alright." Benny looked over at him, and his smile was barely there. "I fell for you so hard; and when you couldn't love me back, it hurt...fuck, you have no idea what it was like to see you... But, it's been a long time, Castiel. I'm okay. I loved you enough that I wanted to see you happy, even if it wasn't with me. Besides, I think Ruby might like me a little bit."
"When?" Garth, another werewolf, asked Castiel. Garth and his pack lived in a large, rambling farmhouse just behind the feed store.
"I believe so," Castiel answered softly.
"What? What did you see?"
"Is it always going to be like this?" Dean asked angrily.
"We can't have children," Castiel blurted out.
Sleepy, Dean sat the book down next to him and got comfortable. Cas' cat snuggled under his armpit and Dean was going to shoo her away, but the damn thing started purring and eventually, it lulled him to sleep.
Dean saw Cas cross the snow from the side window. With lightning speed, the vampire was in his face. "If you hurt him, I will hunt you down and kill you...slowly...I will drain you until you beg to die."
Suddenly there was a warm hand placed on his back. Dean spun around and suddenly there was Castiel, all up in his personal space.
"Seems kind of funny you called Bobby when Casper is less than thirty minutes away. Couldn't you call a tow truck?" Gordon chimed in. While Dean was rambling, the other hunter had gotten out of the truck and made his way around.
"And you're a descendant, soooooo?"
"Cas...you think giving him a nickname will lure him into bed with you? He's too good for the likes of you. He came here for safety and peace, leave him to it."
After Gabriel put their drinks on a tray and delivered them with a flourish, he held out a pad. He touched the tip of his pen against his tongue and gave them an innocent look. "What'll it be, Sunshine?" Sam blushed and stammered out his order for a bowl of chili. Gabriel went around the table, leaving Gordon for last.
"Does he seek refuge here?" Silvermist asked Castiel, but his eyes remained on Dean. Before Castiel could answer, the fairy smiled and touched Dean's face, lightly tracing Dean's freckles. "He is pretty for a human."
“They are drying by the fire. They should be ready in a short while. I can loan you some clothes.”
Castiel gathered his ceremonial candles and set them in the four cardinal directions around the bed. He lit them and took a healing oil from his shelf. He pulled the blankets back. Pouring a healthy amount into his palm, he rubbed his hands together. Starting at the man’s cheeks, Castiel laid his hands on the cold skin. “You are warm, warm as fire.” He moved his hands down the man’s neck, over his chest and hips and then down his legs. When he got to the man’s ankles, he finished, “All this warmth is my desire.”
"Cas. Hey, Cas," Dean said loudly, snapping his fingers. Castiel blinked out of his thoughts. "Where'd you drift off to, babe?"
The men's entrance had quieted the room. Benny, as respective of Sam and Dean's feelings as he could be, related John's condition, and the plan to move the hunter to South Dakota as soon as he was stable. He ended his speech by saying that they were safe again. Chairs scraped against the old wood floors as everyone began to mill about. Some left, others remained. Of those that remained, Castiel was proud as he watched them come up to the brothers and pay their respects. Even Arif nodded to Dean, and for the Djinn, that was almost as good as a hug.
He felt her power inside of him, running through his veins. When the dizziness overcame him, he wasn't prepared, and he stumbled. Then he was seeing the forest rush by...felt the cold snow on the pads of his feet...the smell of the trees and the earth were intensified. It was overwhelming. He could smell Dean...his mate. The outline of the sedan could be seen ahead, idling in the middle of the road. Castiel stopped in the beams of the headlights. He saw Dean through the windshield, and then he turned to look down the road that lead out of town, sending a silent communication to Dean.
"Will the two who promised to stand by this couple please come forward." Benny stepped behind Cas and Dean frowned...who was going to...Sam. Dean's eyes burned with unshed tears. Sam smiled and stood behind him.
Dean stood up and pulled Castiel to his feet. As one, they stepped together, lips coming together not in passion, but solace.
Castiel closed his eyes before answering. He was starting to get aroused. "Yes. Yes, it feels good, Dean." He was closed to whimpering like a lost puppy, so with his last shred of dignity, Castiel put his hand over Dean's exploring one. "Let's dry off."
"I know since meeting me, things haven't gone well for you." Cas' tone sounded so despondent Dean forgot his issues with his lack of a six pack and turned. He had to take a step back because Cas was right there...like right there.
"Or something. Lucifer is now the High Priest of the coven. Mother stepped down a few years ago, though she is still an active member." Intrigued, Dean pressed on.
"I don't know, Dean; but he's pissed he can't find you. I know he talked to Bobby, and Bobby told him you were fine." Dean closed his eyes, praying Bobby didn't say anything else.
"Castiel, he will have to make the choice."
"Didn't recognize the number. Almost didn't answer. You finished up in Wyoming?"
Dean tried to explain his reaction to what he saw. Seeing Benny touch Cas intimately made him see red. You didn't look at someone like that...didn't touch someone like that unless you'd fucked them. But why? Why was he pissed? He wasn't jealous. He barely knew the witch. No, it wasn't jealousy. Maybe it was because Cas was so good and that fuckin' vampire was...was a vampire...plain and simple.
"Thought you could use some help." Dean nodded at the pile of split logs. "Couldn't you just wave your magic wand or something?"
The sound of the Impala’s engine stopped, and Dean watched the snow fall in silence through the windshield. Winter in Wy-fucking-oming. He pulled on the thick gloves and buttoned up the heavy coat he’d found at a secondhand shop back in Provo. He’d been driving for three days now and hoped this was just a wild goose chase. Hunting a wendigo in the dead of winter wasn’t the smartest thing he’d ever done. His dad was caught up in a vamp nest over in Tennessee, but he said he had faith Dean could handle this solo. It was days like this that Dean envied his younger brother, Sam. He was in sunny California, a junior associate in a large law firm, after graduating Summa Cum Laude at Stanford.
Castiel was mixing lip balm the next morning when he heard Benny's truck. When he looked up, he realized time had flown and the sky was darkening. He called out for Benny to come in when the Cajun knocked on the door.
"Shhh," Cas whispered. "I'm here, Dean. I'm not going anywhere." Cas' fingertips were drawing small circles on Dean's chest. Dean wanted to believe Cas. He really did. "You are a good man, Dean...so good." The circles became bigger, and then Cas was touching his belly...his soft belly. Dean eyes flew open in a panic and quickly pushed Cas' hand away. Cas was looking at him quizzically. "What's..."
As the crowd thinned, Dean and Cas sat down together at the bar. "You happy, Cas?"
"I'm sorry."
"This is great, Cas," Dean said, his mouth full. Castiel smiled at him and murmured his thanks. After that, the only sounds were the scrape of spoons on the ceramic bowls. After rinsing the bowls and mugs, they got ready for bed. Dean used Castiel's toothpaste, even though they'd taken the time to get Dean's bag out of the car. Castiel banked the fire and straightened the bedding on the floor for Dean. He wanted to invite Dean to sleep in the bed with him, but something told him Dean wouldn't. They may have slept together the night before, but Castiel knew it was only because Dean felt vulnerable after his nightmare and his worry for Sam.
"...so, he'll need nursing care," Sam finished and Dean pulled himself back into the matter at hand.
“I would agree, Dean,” Castiel replied, returning the grin with a slight curve of his lips.
"We are stuck...at least until the snow stops coming down. Benny will come out on his snowmobile once it clears up." Benny always checked on him after heavy snowfalls. He checked on everyone in the town, it was just his way.
"Dean...I have faith in Brighid. She said we were fated to be together."
"Right. Being hunted by my father...a hunter..." Dean barked out a huff of mirthless laughter. "...isn't the best way to start something."
"Only good witch is a dead witch," Gordon snarled. "Move it, Winchester, or I'll take you down with him."
"Benny and I are friends, no more, no less," Castiel stated solemnly. He took another sip of tea.
"Apparently, Dean is my true mate and she needed to keep him here so he could..."
"No, I haven't seen her in years, Dad."
He picked up the incense and moved to the designated candle.
"Come on, Dad, calm down," Sam said, touching John's shoulder. John turned wild eyes to Sam.
"How?" Castiel couldn't put words together. A gun like this, in the wrong hands...the idea terrified him.
"I'd know if there was another witch in the area," Castiel said, cutting off his friend's words.
He kept one hand on the cabin and made his way around the building. When he got to the back window, he stepped away from the safety of the walls and walked towards the sounds of an axe cleaving wood. He was about two feet away when he saw the outline of the lean-to. "Cas," he called out.
"She will be fine, Dean. She wants to hunt."
Castiel spent the morning helping in the store while Benny was in Casper picking up the parts. When he returned, Castiel watched him change out his headlights. "Dean seems to be better at the whole mates thing," Benny said, out of the blue. They'd been silent up until that moment.
"Yes, Dean...oh..." A grin broke out on his face, and he jogged forward to meet the women. Dean hung back, watching as the women hugged Cas and gathered around him. Finally, Cas turned and motioned for Dean. "Come and meet my aunts."
"What's that you have?" He hadn't heard Bobby come out of the bathroom, and he was at a loss of what to say. Bobby came closer and picked up the bag. "Hex bag?"
The archangel appeared at his side with a stack of blankets. Castiel bundled one and put it under John's head and spread the others over him. John was still alert enough to know what was going on, and Castiel saw hatred in his eyes. The right side of the hunter's face was becoming slack and drool appeared at the corner of his mouth. Castiel wiped it away with the hem of the blanket. "What's happening, Castiel?" Sam asked, on his knees next to Dean.
"Ruby loaned it to me."
Castiel felt his face heat. "Benny is just overly protective."
"So, this witch saved my life and uhm, they took care of me until I was good...ya know? And then I left to go on a hunt with Bobby, but I couldn't stop thinking about...them...yeah, and so I thought they put a spell or something on me...you know, like slipped me some magic oysters or something."
"She trusts me. Someone put out a spring trap, and she was caught. I freed her, took care of her broken leg, and tended to her while she healed. When the time came, she went back to her pack. She comes to visit occasionally." The guy acted like saving a wild wolf from a trap wasn't a big deal.
At home again, he put his gathered things away and ate an early supper of cheese, sliced ham, and bread. The bed seemed to mock him. Pierce jumped on it and sat flicking her tail. "I'm not afraid," he told her softly. The cat blinked disbelievingly at him.
"Hey, uhm, Cas?" Dean stood up. Nature was calling, and he'd put off the trip to the outhouse as long as he could.
Before he knew it, he was lost. Completely turned around and nothing looked familiar. The blanket of white covered everything and the snow was still coming down. “Fuck,” his voice echoed a little and snow fell from the limb above him, landing on his head and shoulders. With a growl, he shook it off. The sky was gray, and he could barely make out the sun behind the thick covering of Stratus clouds. He stopped walking and tried to concentrate on which direction the sun was in when he started this trek. Remembering, he headed south. He was cold down to his bones, his hiking boots and jeans were not meant for exposure to these types of conditions. He came out of the woods into a large barren field. Dean knew he hadn’t seen it before. He was about to turn around when he smelled smoke. He looked at the tree line on the other side of the field and saw light gray tendrils whisping into the sky. It was barely visible through the falling snow. He plodded forward, maybe someone could tell him how to get back to his car or even invite him in from the cold.
"Gypsies aren't supernatural beings."
"She is my Goddess." At Dean's face, Castiel sighed. "You are a non-believer, and I respect that."
"What happened?"
"What are you apologizing for, Dean? The inane reference to witches and broomsticks?" The words should have been angry, but it sounded so much like disappointment that Dean was suddenly scared. "Or was it something else?"
"People...humans and other...beings are not always good, Cas. You shouldn't ever feel guilty."
"Where did your wolf go?"
Castiel was suddenly there, hovering over him. "I'm here, Dean." The witch reached down and put his palm over Dean's forehead. The cool touch felt nice. "How do you feel?"
"A friend."
"Way to fuck up a wet dream, Cas," Dean muttered under his breath. Louder, he said, "I'm going to tell him I had car trouble – the truth – and my phone doesn't work for shit here – again, the truth."
To cast the shadows from their lives, Castiel led the group in a tight circle counterclockwise. Around and around, faster and faster, until he felt peace settle over everyone within his protection. Back at his altar, he lit a white candle. "From death to the old ways comes life anew. I light the candle of peace, harmony, and love that it may always shine in our hearts."
"Wedding robes? Please tell me I'm not going to have to wear white lace or some shit like that. I'm not going to be the bride in this whole thing, Cas." Dean crossed his arms like a petulant child. Cas looked at him with such amusement that Dean wanted to punch him.
The simple words had a strange effect on Dean. Castiel could feel the trembling in the man's arms. Slowly and carefully, Dean knelt between Castiel's legs and picked up the jar. Castiel watched his lover stare into the jar and then at Castiel's spread thighs.
Dean paid the bill and took the small styrofoam box out to the car. He wanted to make it through Oklahoma before nightfall. When he stopped to get gas, he sat on the hood of the Impala and opened the container. The aroma of nutmeg and cinnamon reached his nostrils and he sighed. His thoughts turned to the handsome witch again. The map showed him driving really close to Wyoming. Shaking his head he wondered where that had come from. What? Like he was going to stop in and say hi? Besides, Cas had Benny to keep him company. Suddenly, he wasn't hungry anymore. He tossed the remaining pie into the trash can and got behind the wheel.
"What do you want, Dean?" Benny said his name with a sneer.
“Something has obviously upset you, Dean. Can I be of assistance,” Castiel asked carefully.
"No...no...not...him." Dean felt a stab of pain.
"Call this number when you get to Casper...and Sam...be careful." He hung up and dialed Bobby's number.
Castiel's heart hurt. He'd tried to love Benny. And he did love him but not in the way his friend wanted him to...not the love that lasted an eternity. He wouldn't have that with Dean either. He turned back to the cabin and saw Dean standing there, bundled in his coat. His expression was unreadable. How much had he seen?
"Sam and Dean would never see their father again. We can't do that."
"Cas...let me..." Dean suddenly seemed shy, and Castiel pushed Dean's chin up with his fingertip, so he could see his eyes.
"You really love him." Dean felt his face heat. He didn't want to talk about his feelings with anyone, let alone a powerful witch he met less than an hour ago. He took a deep breath before answering.
"She can take it up with my dad," Dean said, only partly joking. Cas was quiet after that. Dean could hear the occasional slosh of water as he presumed the other man was washing himself. Dean groaned at the mental picture. Why did his life have to be so damn hard?
"What do you want me to do, Bobby?" Dean said, his frustration evident in his tone.
"But I don't mind..." Castiel put his finger over Dean's lips, hushing him.
"Don't want to talk about it, Sammy. So, Bobby, tell us about this facility." Yep, it was time to change the subject.
Dean fisted both hands in his hair, pulling at the short strands before rounding on Castiel.
"What...please don't tell me you need help with the table decorations or something."
Benny's palm hit the steering wheel in frustration. "What are you talking about," Sam asked from the backseat.
"Ingredients? What kind of ingredients?" Dean was expecting eye of newt or wings of bat, or some shit like that. He was surprised when the man walked to a bookcase that held hundreds of glass jars of various sizes.
"Castiel..." Benny started.
"It's a mixture of baking soda, sea salt, and peppermint essential oil."
Silence filled the line. Dean waited a second, then two...three... "Sammy, did I lose you?"
Mortification. That was the look Dean had. "Wait...oh, God...why would you think..."
"Brighid protects me. She would warn me if someone came to do me harm."
Castiel hid his smile as Gabriel turned pouty lips to Benny. "Yes...that's exactly what I will do...I hope the fleas of a thousand camels infest your crotch." The last part was set to a barely audible whisper, but vampires have a keen sense of hearing. Benny just laughed. Sam, who missed that part of the exchange, seemed relieved Gabriel wasn't going to share any space with him.
"Most of the time, yeah." He grinned, and Cas looked away. Dean could see he was fighting a smile. "It's because I'm so fuckin' adorable. Don't fight it, Babe." And there it was...Cas smiled.
Stopping right outside the door to the bar, Benny spun around. "The only plan we have is defense. I'm getting ready to send everyone out to the different roads into the area. No one is to engage with your father. We just don't want to be surprised. We are going to stay out of sight and let you, your brother, and Bobby handle this. We cannot get involved. How you handle things...it's all on you. My job is to protect this town and the people in it."
"Castiel, will you share in Dean’s laughter and look for the brightness and the positive in him?"
At the northernmost candle, he touched his finger to the wick and it flared. He faced the sky and chanted, "I come into the Circle of Earth, the Circle of Peace, so wandering spirits may be released." He laid down his athame to symbolize freeing the ties that bind spirits to the earth.
"Yeah, whatever." The hot water and the light scent of roses drifting up with the steam were making Dean drowsy. He was shivering again though. Castiel turned with a crude ceramic mug in his hand. He parked his hip on the side of the tub and held it out to Dean.
Castiel felt the glide of Dean's teeth on his neck and let his head fall back. "Don't get..." Kiss, lick, nip. "...why Christians don't..." Nip, kiss, lick. "...do it this way...much more fun." Dean's fingers pinched at his nipples and he felt his cock thicken between his legs. His own hands moved over Dean's broad shoulders and down his strong biceps. "Love you, Cas. Love your body...want you." Dean's words were breathed into his skin, causing his skin to raise in tiny chill bumps. "Cold?" Dean asked, pulling back to look at him.
"So, you're back with her? You know you can't afford emotional ties..."
Benny clapped him on his back. "I'd be honored, but I don't think I'll be needed, Brother."
The driving was easier once Dean got into southeastern Colorado. October was still a bit early for snow in that part of the state. In Denver, he stopped at a Walmart and bought a prepaid cell phone with one of his fake credit cards. He also bought a new wallet, since his hadn't held up well after being dunked in a frozen river. He left a text message for his father that he'd be spending the night in Colby, Kansas and would arrive in Oklahoma the following afternoon.
“What? Holy shit? Seriously?” Dean thought all people in the US had electricity. It was like he fell through the ice and into a third world country.
"Just got off the phone, Bobby. You have any idea where Dad is?"
Cas sat back on his haunches. "We don't believe in it. Is it a problem?" Cas looked so sad that Dean pulled him down on top of him.
When Dean finally finished and Sam was up to date, Sam started his tirade. "Dad is hunting you, Dean. You've got to get in touch with him and let him know you're fine. You've got to keep him away from your friends."
"Beef."
"So, if I use it, it would make me pretty?" Dean teased.
He nearly jumped out of his skin when he felt Cas' hand on his ass. "Dean, look at me." Dean pulled his face out of the quilt and looked back. Cas was sitting on his heels, looking all cute with his head tilted. He held out his hand. After a second's hesitation, Dean rolled to his side and took it. "The first time we have sex, it won't be like that."
It was only after Castiel left Dean to go get more firewood that everything sank in. Dean was sure he was under a love spell. What made him think that? Dean had said he'd dreamed of him, smelled him. Could it be possible? Could Dean be drawn to Castiel in that way? It would explain so much. There was a part of him that wanted to look into his future, but he'd never dared before. He shook his head...no, he would not do that.
Cas turned again. "Mighty water, that quenches our thirst and is essential to all life, I call to thee." When he turned again, he saw Dean, and he faltered on the words. "Mighty earth..." Gathering himself, he finished. "...that we walk upon and must treat as our own kin, I call to thee."
He could count on one hand how many times he stood up to his father. Most of the time, it got him a punch to the gut or more of John's mental abuse. Abuse? Dean didn't know why that word popped into his head. Sure, his dad beat him...slapped him around...and hell, he belittled him constantly...but abuse? Abuse was done to kids and women...but then again, Dean was a kid when it started. How would his life have been different if Bobby was his dad? That thought gave him courage. "When I was little, all I wanted out of life was to be like you. You were my fuckin' hero. But now, fuck, for the first time, I see you for what you really are: a hollow, heartless, bastard...a bully..." Dean ran his fingers through his hair and took a deep breath. "When mom died, you had us. Me and Sammy. You left us on our own...sometimes without food. Do you know that I had to steal food for Sammy? Do you even fuckin' care?" A vision of Cas swam before him, giving him strength. "I finally met someone who loves me...me, Dad, not the hunter you want me to be. I've met an entire town of people who, despite what they are, are good people."
"Cas...come on, babe. If you're feeling all frisky, we can go back to the cabin."
"Hell, yes. I've got plans for a real bathroom. I need a shower, man. And I'll have to build a barn or something to store my baby in."
"That's almost as old as your feathered ass," Benny said, pulling out a stool and taking a seat.
Dean met the man's eyes and gave a quick nod. "I'll be back in town when it's safe to walk it."
Warned him...the bastard didn't even correct him when he was going on and on about little old ladies seeing him naked. Dean lifted his chin, he could do this. Setting his shoulders back, he strutted towards the group. As he neared, one of them smiled and touched Cas' arm. "Don't blame Castiel...he forgets that people have assumptions about witches."
"A young man, tall with long hair, is making his way here. An older man...I sensed a goodness in him...was arguing with another man..."
Cas put a hand on Dean's forearm, and Dean stopped talking. By Cas' expression, he was getting ready to tell Dean some fucked up shit. "Dean, the Goddess let me...hitch a ride with Chara."
"I told you...it's for safe travels."
"Shhhh, concentrate on Sam."
Lights blazed at Gabriel's bar. Inside, the inhabitants of Lafitte sat at tables or stood at the bar. There was a buzz of conversation in the air that stopped when Benny and Castiel walked in. Castiel took a stool at the end of the bar, and Benny went to the front of the room.
Once the two men were settled in their beds and the fire stoked for the evening, Castiel blew out the candle on his nightstand. Dean was on his stomach, reading by a single taper. Pierce lay nestled next to his side. Traitor. She never liked anyone except him and Benny.
Soon enough, Dean heard the gurgle of water going down a drain, and the curtain was pushed back. Cas emerged, wrapped in a towel. And Dean stopped breathing. What was it about the man that made Dean like a bitch in heat every time he saw Cas without clothes? As Cas walked by, Dean couldn't help but feel inadequate. Was it witchcraft that gave Cas the abs of steel? He self consciously sucked in his stomach.
"Bathroom?" Castiel's eyes were startled.
"Sure, we'll go get some coffee," Sam answered, relief evident on his face.
"Smells like Crest."
"I'm a hunter...basically, your worst nightmare," Dean went for the tough bastard approach.
"We can do it during the waxing moon. I must contact my great aunts..." Castiel began to make plans in his head and failed to see Dean's expression of fear. "We will have to get word to the town, they would want to attend. Let's see..." Castiel climbed the ladder into the loft and sat down quickly in front of his altar. From a box underneath the table, he pulled out a piece of parchment paper and a fountain pen. Neatly, he wrote his aunts' names on the paper. Picking up a candle, he went back downstairs.
"Oh, shit," mumbled Benny and took a few more steps back.
He stepped towards the west and bent to light the first candle. He faced the western sky. "I, Castiel, come into the Circle of Water, a Circle of Might, to sing of my family on this Holy Night." He placed a pomegranate down to welcome those from the hereafter.
"She saw health and happiness."
"Yeah, whatever."
He would be gone tomorrow. The last thing he wanted was a tumble with a fuckin' witch. It didn't matter that the witch was the hottest man Dean had ever seen outside of Hollywood's outputs.
“Why are you so upset, Dean? You’ve been praying on and off and seemed very agitated for the last hour. Has something happened? Are you alright,” Castiel stepped closer to Dean slowly. He was worried about his hunter.
Thanks again for all the love and support.
"Yes. He has someone with him. Someone evil."
Dean stood on shaky legs and followed Castiel to the table. He sat, and Castiel took his place across from him. Carefully, Castiel placed his scrying mirror in the center of the table. "Give me your hands."
Dean nodded. "Sounds good, Harriet. You make it?"
"Tell me," Castiel whispered. Missouri cocked her head, listening to the sound of a zipper being pulled up.
"What was the question, Cas?"
"Apple Pie, cheesecake, and lemon poundcake." Dean pursed his lips, thinking hard. He loved pie, but cheesecake was awesome too.
"She offered you a gift. Apparently, she likes you."
Quickly Dean secured the towel. He didn’t want to even look at himself. And neither would anyone else. A strange, strangled sound escaped his throat.
The doctor fiddled with his stethoscope before meeting Sam's eyes, and Dean knew it was going to be bad news. "Your father's blood pressure was incredibly high and from the damage done, I'm assuming it's been going on for some time now. The CT scan showed major blockage in his arteries surrounding the heart, and his cholesterol was through the roof. All that being said, he will more than likely need long term nursing care." Dean hung his head, covering his face with his hands. The words 'long term' seemed to echo in the room.
"I don't need to use magick, just my knowledge of the plants and their properties."
The hunter smiled nervously, but took her hand. "Nice to meet you." Castiel released the breath he hadn't realized he was holding.
"I impart these words gently to Grandmere," Castiel named his grandmother and the people around him said the names of their departed loved ones. "Carry the smoke of my love and memories with you into the next world when you return."
"Castiel is not a creature. He's a man," Benny spat out. "You see him as a thing though, don't you? Just another thing to hunt down."
"Yeah, and this old man needs some sleep." Bobby said, stifling a yawn.
"Where do you come from?" Gordon's question caused all eyes to fall on Castiel.
After several minutes of exchanging soft kisses, they pulled back slowly. Castiel’s thumbs were still rubbing over Dean’s skin, Dean’s hand still gently cupping the back of Castiel’s head. They looked at each other, and Dean was struck with the fondness in Castiel’s eyes.
"It's only water. I'm not trying to poison you..." A veil seemed to fall over his eyes. "...or turn you into a toad, though I have thought about it recently."
Castiel stopped midway up. "My altar, my books, my sanctuary." With nothing else forthcoming, Castiel ascended to his loft. Usually, being in the presence of his altar grounded him, but tonight he felt like a thousands ants were crawling on his skin. He crawled to the edge of the loft and looked down. Dean caught the movement and looked up. "Why do you care?" Castiel asked quietly.
"But, what about..."
"We'll just wait it out. Can't last long, right?" Dean said, after moving to the window to look outside.
"One of your little ones is sick." Castiel noticed the child at the ritual. She was feverish, and it worried him. "I have something to help." He sat his bag of laundry down and reached into his coat pocket. The small brown bottle held a tincture that would help the girl.
The man, Castiel, smiled and damn, he was gorgeous. “This is Mo Chara, she is the one who saved your life.”
Those with children left to go to their homes, and the others wandered into Gabriel's bar. There would be food there to celebrate the harvest. The next ritual was for Castiel alone.
"It was a rhetorical question, Little Sister. I would have thought the Goddess would have made a better match for our nephew...perhaps another witch," Nimue said to the table in general, ignoring the fact Dean was sitting right there.
"Do you think it's wrong?" Bobby wasn't going to play dumb, he knew exactly was Dean was asking.
Dean looked down at his bedding on the floor. Sleeping by the fire wasn't that bad. Cas had given him a fuckton of quilts, and he'd slept on worse; but Cas' bed was comfy. He glanced up and met Cas' eyes. "There's plenty of room..." Cas let the sentence trail off and he looked away.
"Promise me you won't tell Dad."
Castiel didn’t kiss him back at first, and Dean started to doubt his actions. Maybe Castiel had meant something else, or maybe angels did things differently.
"Of course," Castiel said with a chuckle. "I'm performing the protection ritual on Samhain."
"Gabriel, my father is here...can you hook us up with some food?" Dean said, trying to sound upbeat and normal. He was sweating bullets. He took off his coat and tossed it on one of the empty tables.
"Thank you, Benny," Castiel answered and the two men followed Benny out the door, down the sidewalk, and around to the back of the store. Castiel helped him slide the barn doors open, and they all walked inside. Benny kept three snowmobiles. With Wyoming under the cover of snow seven months out of the year, snowmobiles and four wheel drive trucks were a must. Benny pulled two helmets off a shelf and handed one to each of them.
"You do have feelings." It was a statement, not a question. And he wasn't surprised when she took his hand. Castiel could look into the future, but he never looked into his own fate. She held his palm in her warm hands and traced his line of the heart. He watched her eyes carefully and saw the flash of fear.
Dean dragged his teeth over his lower lip and looked away.
"I'm not a fool, Castiel. Benny has carried a torch for you from the first day you arrived in Lafitte. This man, your hunter, made him jealous."
"Are you sure this is what you want?" Cas asked hesitantly.
Now, he was standing in the snow and the cold, wishing someone could give him the answer...and fuck, he didn't even know the freakin' question. The wolf startled him. One minute he was alone having his own pity party. Then she was there, staring at him with those all-knowing eyes. "You got anything to say?"
Castiel grinned. "You sly old dog."
On a scale of one to ten, the sex wasn't the wildest, but it was the best. For the first time in a long time, Dean felt good about himself. Cas didn't care at all about his pudgy belly. That's why it was easy for Dean to get out of bed this morning and put on nothing but boxers. As he cooked, he felt Cas' eyes on him. The few times he looked over at the bed, Cas was wearing a smile that could only be described as affectionate.
"Not here," Dean said, looking around.
Before he could turn to the north, he felt a surge come from the earth. A picture of Dean's face flashed in his mind. He staggered and looked to the moon. What was she trying to tell him? He made his way to the northern candle and finished the rite before completing the circle by the eastern candle. He walked the circle counterclockwise and extinguished each candle. At his alter, Castiel raised his arms for the final time and said, "So mote it be."
“Dean,” Castiel began carefully. “Are you upset that you have gained a small amount of weight in the last few years?”
"No...no...oh, Dean." Castiel couldn't take his eyes off the sight. Dean wrapped his fist around where they were joined and moved his hand back and forth, as if he were masturbating. With their arousal lubricating the juncture, it was slick and smooth. Dean moved his hand faster in a steady rhythm, and Castiel realized he had been holding his breath. It came out as a gasp and then he was panting...whimpering. Dean glanced up at his face, and Castiel finally understood the meaning of the word rapture. It was there in Dean's face.
Castiel needed to show Dean he was loved for who he was, and the only way he could think of to do that was to not take what was being offered. But instead, he had to give Dean confidence in his body and his self-worth. Sitting between Dean's thighs, being able to touch him anywhere he wanted was something Castiel dreamed about. He worshiped Dean's body, showing Dean he was perfect just the way he was.
The drive back to Lafitte was a quiet one.
Sparks flew from Castiel's fingertips into the cauldron and the small bits of paper burst into flames.
"If she's not yours, then why was she in here? She sure acted like she was at home."
Back inside the cabin, he looked up at the beautiful purple and black robe that the aunts had made for him. Cas' was hanging next to it. His was just black, similar to his old robe, but made of much finer cloth. Dean had questioned why his was fancier and was told that Cas' robe fit his station as a powerful witch with no need for finery. Dean pouted because he knew in the aunts' eyes, he was the bride. Cas assured him that wasn't so, but Dean didn't believe him.
"I'm not," Castiel avowed. To prove it, he grabbed the quilts off the bed and laid them on the trunk and stripped the sheets. He was about to toss the sheets into the large wicker hamper that held his dirty laundry, when Dean's scent assailed him. He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. When he opened them again, Pierce seemed to be amused by his actions. "You shut up."
"Castiel, will you share in Dean’s burdens so that your spirits may grow in this union?"
The rest of the cabin was furnished in rough-hewn furniture or antiques. There were plants growing in pots near all the windows. Near the quartz tub, in a corner was a ladder that Dean hadn't noticed before. It led to a loft of some sort. He wondered what was up in the loft. He finished his visual inspection. While the place was small and cluttered, it was clean and seemed organized. Candles and oil lamps lit the room and gave it a golden glow.
"Deeeeaannn," Cas cried out his name as he came. Head thrown back as a primal scream reverberated into the surrounding forest. Dean could feel the throb of Cas' cock inside him and his own muscles locked up as he was rocked by his own orgasm.
The vampire was one cocky son of a bitch. His ploy to get Dean to leave Cas' was so transparent. Once the door shut behind Cas, Benny went to the window and waited. Dean knew he was waiting until Cas was out of earshot. Dean took the time to look around Cas' cabin. He had no weapon against a vamp. If the guy attacked, Dean would lose.
"Dean, we can't..." Sam straightened. "Can I have a minute alone with my brother?"
"Aren't pancakes usually round?"
"Dean, I said to get the fuck out of the way," John was inching to his right, and Gordon was moving slowly to his left. They were trying to flank them.
Dean finally stepped into his father's line of vision and met those cold eyes. "Dad, you're gonna be fine." Now, he was lying too.
It was only then Dean saw the white ring in the grass. Outside of the circle stood the people of the town...and there was Bobby. Dean thought it was the first time he'd seen the older man without a baseball cap on. As he stepped closer, he realized the circle was made of white mushrooms. He'd read about these in his father's journal. A fairy ring.
"Let me dress, and then we can eat." Castiel pulled the heavy drape blocking the tub from Dean's view, and Dean saw the robe drop to the ground from under the hem of the curtain. He heard rustling and then the fabric was brushed aside. Castiel was wearing jeans and a worn Henley.
"He won't."
"Yeah...get us a beer, will ya." Gabriel snapped his fingers and two pint glasses full of cold beer appeared before them.
"I had a vision last night."
Before they even made it to the clearing, Dean heard voices. Lots of voices. They rounded the small bend in the trail, and Dean stopped. It looked like the entire town was there. Mab, dressed in a white robe threaded with bits of gold, saw him first and came to meet them. "Dean, as the eldest of the sisters, I am honored to welcome you into our family. You are a true and righteous man and will make Castiel a perfect mate. She took Dean's hand and turned it palm up. In it, she placed a ring. It was copper, carved with small symbols. She met his eyes as she closed his hand over the ring. "Copper represents the Goddess of Love. You will give this ring as a symbol of your love for Castiel. We...my sisters and I...have each placed a blessing on your rings."
“Well…thanks…I need them back.”
"What the fuck? How'd you...what the fuck are you?" Dean's eyes shifted from Gabriel, to Benny, and back to Castiel. A spark of fear colored his aura, and he crab-walked backwards.
"Gabriel took care of it," Castiel said shortly.
Castiel smiled, one of his all too infrequent genuine smiles. “It’s OK, Dean. I know you’re not attracted to human males, and this vessel is of course male. It doesn’t alter my feelings for you, however.”
Cas' eyes didn't waver, they continued to gaze into Dean's like Dean really meant something...like Dean was worth loving. "Fuck," Dean hissed and shut his eyes. For a moment, he pretended he was worthy of the looks Cas gave him. He flinched when he felt Cas' hand on his chest again.
"Mighty air, that rushes its force through the trees and plants, I call to thee." He made a quarter turn and continued, "Mighty fire, that warms us and helps provide us with comfort, I call to thee."
"What the hell just happened?" Dean asked, looking around, stunned and still feeling slightly nauseous.
"What do you have?" There was always room for dessert. Dean folded the map and tucked it into his jacket pocket.
"If you will go to the admissions desk and fill out his paperwork, we'll move him upstairs. I'll come get you when he's settled."
The soft tug on his sac, the obscene wet sounds, and the feel of Dean's mouth on his overly sensitive cock...all were sending him closer and closer to the abyss. He wanted to fall with Dean. Using every ounce of will he had, he gripped Dean's hair and pulled him away. Dean's expression was confused. "I'm sorry. I'm not very experienced."
Castiel got off his bar stool and stood shoulder to shoulder with Benny. "I'd trust him with my life."
"Did you?"
"We'll need his blood," Maeva was arguing.
"Yep. They've come once before."
"But I do, Dean." He took a deep breath and continued. "He'd flayed Joby open and was bathing in his blood. I was so angry...I killed him, Dean." Dean squeezed his hand. "I took the life of a person for the life of my pet." Castiel looked away, not wanting to see judgment in Dean's eyes. He was shocked when Dean's hand moved to his face and forced him to turn back, to see the understanding in those amazing green eyes.
The morning sun woke him; and he shifted his body to stretch, but warm limbs were wrapped around him. Dean's legs were tangled in his, and one of his hands was splayed across Castiel's chest. He smiled to himself, wanting to savor this moment in time.
The dark haired man shook his head. "I have what I need." Yeah, well, Dean needed to get out of here. He moved to stand, holding onto the plain white sheet to cover him, but his legs trembled. He felt a wave of dizziness.
Cas leaned in and placed a soft kiss on Dean's lips. He pulled back a mere hair's breath and whispered. "I could turn you into a cockroach."
"You look so good, Dean," Cas whispered, leaning his forehead to Dean's. Cas started moving his hand on his own cock. Dean became mesmerized. Watching them jerk off side-by-side was one of the most erotic things Dean had ever experienced...or maybe it was just because he loved Cas.
"Oh." For once, Bobby was speechless.
"Don't be getting all emotional now, Bridezilla."
"Let me show you how," Castiel said softly, taking the jar from Dean. Dean nodded, biting on his lower lip. Castiel could almost feel Dean's shyness. Castiel spread his legs wider and dipped his finger into the sweet smelling oil. "If you go slow, the feeling of your fingers inside your lover is exquisite. There is a fine line between pain and pleasure. The pain is brief, but the pleasure is intense." Castiel found his hole and pressed inside. Dean's mouth opened in a small 'o' as he watched. "The muscle will release as it is stretched and stimulated, allowing for entry."
Dean was looking at the circle and the meager offerings. "What were you doing? Who were you talking to?" Dean stepped to the edge of the circle, careful not to cross it.
Ignoring the stitch in his side, Dean started running again. When he got to the smaller road that led to Cas' cabin, he had to run in the narrow path they'd made earlier that morning through the thick snow. He was glad to see Cas' home come into sight. Slowing to a easy lope, Dean made his way to the porch. Castiel was coming out of the cabin holding a basket and a staff. He was naked except for his long, black cloak.
"But why?" Benny asked.
"What do you want me to do?"
Dean resumed his pacing in the confining space. Of course Castiel had shown up at the worst time, right in the middle of a meltdown. The last person he wanted to make privy to his inner turmoil was now reminding him he was getting older.
"Don't worry, I'm done here." Dean stomped out of the room. He walked down to the end of the hall and leaned against the wall, letting himself slide down until he was sitting. He buried his face in his hands. Years of constantly being told you weren't good enough...years of abuse...yes...abuse...had taken its toll, and it all came out in one big knot of anger. Not one of his finer moments. Fuck, his father was in a hospital for fuck's sake. What kind of person did that make him? He felt a presence and looked up.
"I just think I should handle it. I'll tell Dad my car died in the middle of nowhere..." Dean waved his hands around expressively. "...and Gabriel here let me use his phone, and I called Bobby for help..."
Dean's bark of almost hysterical laughter had all heads turned towards him. Castiel gave him a warning glare. "Sorry, just thought of a private joke," Dean said, still laughing.
Benny took in the room, settling on Dean, now sitting up with a glare etched on his face. "Good morning, Castiel. I brought your laundry. Everything okay here?"
"Yep." Dean frowned. Bobby wasn't being forthcoming about either one of them.
He slipped out of the bedding and tiptoed to the door. After grabbing his coat and bundling it tight over the clothes he slept in, Dean let himself out. It was cold, but at least it wasn't snowing. The snow was still too deep to let Cas risk giving him a ride on the motorcycle, but he could probably walk it. He remembered the way. He almost ran into the line running from the cabin to the outhouse and pulled up short. It was ingenious to think of that. Dean figured most people who lived in the great white north needed to have ideas like this. With nothing else to do in the long winter months, people probably came up with all sorts of cool solutions to everyday problems. Dean could only think of two things living here would be good for...coming up with cool ideas and fucking.
Missouri was staring at the bed. "Oh...well...I didn't mean to interrupt." Dean gave her a pained smile and a wave of his fingers.
"You sure?"
"It will," the witch replied softly. Dean inhaled, held it, and then exhaled.
"So, tell me about this whole marriage ceremony? Will I need a tux? Will we get presents?" Cas rolled his eyes. The witch had the nerve to roll his eyes.
Castiel woke to the sound of coughing. He jumped up and ran to the bedside. Dean's body was wracked with fever and the cough sounded wet. "Damn it."
The next thing Dean became aware of was his teeth chattering and his body shaking uncontrollably. He really thought dying would be less irritating. He grumbled before sinking back into his dreams. Dreams of gentle hands rubbing his arms, a soft humming, and then even softer words telling him he was going to be alright.
"Thanks, Sammy. Can you let me go now. I can't freakin' breathe." He was unceremoniously dropped to the floor.
"Castiel, do you need help preparing for the ritual?" Fawn asked in her singsong voice. Castiel turned to the fairy.
"You ever hear of a vampire that didn't drink from humans?"
"No." The word sounded harsh and desperate.
John Winchester got out of his truck before speaking. He took in the situation, and Dean had to admit it looked shady. Sam, Bobby, and Dean were all trying to look like standing in a ghost town next to the Impala was a normal occurrence, while Cas's expression was blank. "What the hell is going on, Dean. You left South Dakota, and I haven't heard from you since. I've been calling your fucking cell phone for days." He stopped and looked at Sam. "And what are you doing here?"
"They?"
"Dean...you doing okay, boy?"
Dean pulled up the quilts that had gotten pushed down to his waist. "We should probably get some shuteye. I'll need to get back to the hospital in a few hours." Dean thought about the last time he'd had sex...the girl didn't do a whole lot of touching, and the lights were off...Jesus...he ate just like his father did – fast food and greasy diners. If he didn't check himself, he'd be a candidate for fat camp.
Slowly, they undressed each other and sank into the hot water. At first, the two men set about bathing, but then Dean's foot grazed Castiel's hip and from Dean's grin, he did it on purpose. "The last time I shared a bathtub was with Sam. He was three."
"Good." At Castiel's look, Benny's voice softened. "He's not for you, Castiel. He's a hunter."
"He could come back, Castiel."
“Dean, you know you can tell me anything,” Castiel said from his perch on the bed.
"What town are you closest to?"
Castiel stood still, unable to take his eyes away from Dean's. "Do you believe in fate, Dean?"
Cas sat down on the edge of the bed clearly waiting for him to go on. "You're a great guy..."
Benny's body language was relaxed and Dean waited. "Family of four, camping trip. Found their motor home at the bottom of a ravine eight miles due north of here. The highway patrol thinks they ran off the road during the last big snowfall."
Dean picked up the jar and smelled it. Sweet. Still suspicious, he dribbled a bit on his plate and stuck his pinkie into it. He licked it off and nodded. "Not bad." It was thicker than what he was used to, so he was careful about the amount he poured onto his breakfast. He passed the jar to Cas and dug in.
"I want that," Dean whispered. It was true. He knew it just as he knew his own name. He wanted to grow old with Cas. It should have scared him, but he just felt peaceful.
"The tea might taste...like shit...but your body had a shock. Exposure to extreme cold causes electrolyte loss, muscle cramping, and other maladies. A few more minutes and you would have been dead. Drink it, Dean."
"I didn't set out to fall for him."
Done wasting time, Dean opened the car door and hissed as the cold seeped under the edges of the coat. Who in their right mind would want to live out here in the middle of nowhere? He popped the trunk and took out his backpack. He’d already packed it with a few bottles of water, some snacks, a flare gun with extra flares, his revolver loaded with special silver bullets, and a few more odds and ends. He slung the pack over his shoulder, tucked his Glock, into the waistband of his jeans, and headed off into the woods.
He’d been lonelier when he lived in the city. Lonelier when he was surrounded by the coven. But he left the coven behind. They wanted things that crossed the line between good and evil. Castiel loved the purest kind of magick. The magick you could only get from nature. He sighed. Woolgathering was not getting the salve made.
"You are beautiful, Dean," Castiel said softly and then looked down into the box. "I'm sorry, that was inappropriate."
Bobby's hesitation scared him. "Bobby?"
“My name is Castiel. My friend found you in the river. I brought you to my cabin to warm up.”
Everyone but Dean ordered beer. Dean asked for whiskey with a water back. Cas pressed his leg against Dean's under the table. Dean knew Cas was warning him. He'd need to keep his head in the game, but damn, he needed a drink.
Castiel dished up the stew and called Dean to the table. Halfway through the meal, Castiel looked up to find Dean staring at him intently. He tilted his head in question. "What?"
As if reading his mind, one of them laughed. She whispered to Cas, and he grinned but still managed to look contrite. "Dean, I should have warned you."
Dean could see the tension rolling off the vamp, and he prepared himself for an attack. He was surprised when Benny turned away and gripped the back of a chair. His knuckles were white, and Dean wondered if the chair would break under the vampire's strength. "Don't hurt him." It was like someone had to wring the words out of the other man. Dean froze, at a loss for words. Realization slowly dawned on Dean's face.
It was late afternoon by the time they got to Lafitte. They went into the store, and Dean froze next to him. Castiel looked around to see what had Dean tense at his side. Fawn and Silvermist. The faires from the western forest were flitting about near the jars of candy. They paused their high-pitched chattering when they noticed Dean. Silvermist narrowed his eyes and sought out Castiel's gaze.
"I'm beginning to get that. See you soon."
"Dad?" Sam and Dean both said together. Castiel narrowed his eyes. Something was going on...something bad.
"Sam Actually...Sammich...Samantha...A rose by any other name." Dean laughed, and Castiel loved the sound. He loved how Dean's eyes squinched up at the corners. Sam turned and gave Dean a perturbed look, and Castiel suddenly felt like he'd been missing something all his life. He had a brother, but Luc never looked at him with affection or with brotherly annoyance. Luc's looks were filled with loathing.
"I'm heading out after we eat," Dean said conversationally, with his mouth full of pancakes. Castiel's appetite disappeared. Why was he letting himself feel this way? He knew Dean was going to leave. When he woke up to find Dean gone, he felt ill. Physically ill. Having him burst through the door with that warm smile on his face was just a temporary reprieve...nothing more.
"Fifty Shades of Grey? Cas, babe, that's a book for repressed housewives who've never seen a porn movie. It's trash."
Castiel felt Dean tense up beside him. John's eyes seemed to bore into Castiel's before they shifted to his son's. "Something you want to tell me, Dean?"
"My bloodlines? You seriously need my pedigree?" Dean snorted.
"Fuck me sideways," Dean muttered. "What are you doing?"
"Don't be crude," Cas said, but Dean saw him fighting a smile. Once inside, Dean stoked the fire while Cas fed the cat. It was only after they both changed behind the curtain, that Dean's horrific day came back to the forefront of his mind. Without discussion, Dean crawled into Cas' bed. Cas was still puttering around, and Dean let himself drift. He'd always hunted. He supposed he could still hunt without his dad. He went on hunts by himself more times than he could count. Bobby's suggestion about settling down...now, that scared him. Scared him a whole lot more than facing any creature, that's for sure. What would he do if he didn't hunt? He wasn't like Sam with his fancy college education. Or Cas, who lived off the land and sold jars of creams to make enough money to buy cat food. Dean didn't have any skills...other than hunting and maybe, keeping the Impala running. He wondered what his father would think about him leaving that life behind. Damn...his dad...lying in a hospital room...his body betraying him...his youngest in California, living his own dreams...and Dean, the fuck up of the family...queer and in love with a witch.
"What's wrong?"
"I'm sorry, but we are getting ready to move him upstairs. Are you family?"
“No need to be afraid. Chara would never harm a guest in my home.” The man’s voice was deep, whiskey, laced with a good cigar. Sexy voice or not, Dean wasn’t going to trust the man or his wolf. He took the edge of the heavy blankets and was going to throw them off so he could stand, but he came to the instant realization that he was naked.
"What?" The curtain whipped back. "I thought I warmed the water sufficiently."
"You don't have to defend me to a hunter, Castiel," Benny said angrily. Castiel turned his back on Dean, so he could face his friend. He touched Benny's face.
Castiel was gathering his pajamas, mainly a old pair of flannel pants and a even older t-shirt, but he stopped and narrowed his eyes at the mound under one of the quilts. Pierce always slept at the foot of his bed. Always. Yet, there she was, obviously content to be in Dean's bed. He put his clothes on the bed. "I will move her."
"Dean doesn't think he is good enough for our Castiel," Mab answered.
"Dean, we're in Wyoming. If this is a blizzard, it could last well into the night, and we could be snowed in." As appealing as being snowed in with Dean was, Castiel knew the hunter wouldn't be happy at all.
After hanging up, Dean took a deep breath and faced Benny. The vampire was staring intently at his hands. "Guess you heard that?"
Mab continued south, Dean, Cas and their two best men following behind. She stopped, and Dean saw a single red candle. Mab raised her hands skyward. "For creativity, harmony, sensuality, and vitality. This I ask of you. So mote it be."
"I couldn't see the outcome, but boy, you will have to make a choice. It will be hard for you and will cause you pain."
"Huh?" Dean was confused. A girl?
"Chili," he said bluntly, still eyeing Dean angrily. The man definitely had a hard-on for a fight.
“I wasn’t praying, Cas” Dean spat out.
"Is your whole family in the coven?"
"Well...no, but..." Dean stopped talking. Cas was trying to hide a smile. Dean gave him a bitchface, too.
"What kind of bigger fish?" Dean asked, his stomach knotting. His father wasn't going to go away and leave him alone.
"You may seal your vows with a kiss."
"Wha..." Dean opened his eyes and wiped at his mouth with the back of his hand.
“Huh?” Who didn’t have a dryer?
"I've got to call Sam. Dad is giving him shit about something." Dean rubbed his tired eyes and looked around the cabin blankly.
"Yeah, whatever..." Dean said, finally swinging his legs off the snowmobile. "...getting back to your wolf..."
"Ready?" Dean asked. Castiel wasn't, but he nodded and opened the door. Unlike the first time they walked to town, Dean wasn't silent.
"Got it. Consider it done. That's a pretty cheap wedding gift...wait, that does count as a wedding present, doesn't it?"
"Dean never thought he deserved a home and a normal life, Castiel. Don't give up on him," Sam implored. Castiel didn't respond, he just gave Sam a sad smile. Benny squeezed his shoulder.
Bound and determined to make the witch have a conversation with him, Dean persisted. "What kind of meat is this?"
"Are you talking a nursing home? Where the people sit around...drooling and pissing on themselves?" Dean asked bitterly. Sam hissed beside him. The priest looked at Dean with pity, and that made Dean even madder. "He's not going to one of those places," Dean stated adamantly.
"What is it, Dean?"
Castiel watched the car pull away with Dean and the others. He remembered the Goddess' spell to keep Dean in the area as soon as the tail lights turned the corner. He raced into the store and gathered the things he would need. Running to the center of the street, he drew the circle and lit the candles, calling on Brighid to let Dean go to see his father. If she didn't release Dean, he would resent both her and Castiel. She appeared before him.
Cas pushed a jar towards him.
"Thanks, Babe." Dean settled back on his pillow while Castiel put the things away. After he was back in bed, they curled into each other and kissed. The kisses were punctuated by words of love and promise.
"Huh?"
Stealing himself to face the inevitable, Castiel made his way back to the porch, his feet using the same path worn through the snow. With only one foot on the step, Dean's voice stopped him. It was cold like the icicles hanging from his eaves, and just as sharp. "You're fucking a Goddamned vampire."
"Maybe it wasn't a witch?"
He threw back his head and reached for the sky. He inhaled and felt the power come from the ground into the soles of his feet. He breathed evenly as he was filled with energy. He exhaled and moved back to the east. "My lady, guide my thoughts. Let them lead always closer to you."
"She never brings me anything, and I provide her with tuna," Benny muttered, a smile still gracing his lips. "She must love you, Dean."
"Morning," Dean mumbled, and Castiel looked down into sleepy eyes.
"As he travels and ventures about, regardless of his choice of route, I beg for his protection, be it visible or unseen, with no mishaps, please intervene."
"Dad, I'll take care of it and make sure it doesn't wind up in the wrong hands," Dean said, trying to reassure his father.
Mab rested her hand on their bound ones. "Castiel and Dean, as your hands are bound together now, so your lives and spirits are joined in a union of love and trust. The bond of marriage is not formed by these cords, but rather by the vows you have made. For always you hold in your own hands the fate of this union. Above you are stars and below you is earth. Like stars your love should be a constant source of light, and like the earth, a firm foundation from which to grow."
A witch wouldn't just hand over their grimoire...but Cas did. He just handed it over and said he trusted Dean. It blew Dean's mind. The leather bound book was thick. Dean got comfortable on the bed and started to read. He wondered how old Cas was when he started this journal. There were no dates, but the handwriting was messy, and the wording was that of a child. The spells and recipes were easy...things like preventing warts...Dean smiled at that. The longer he read, the more insight he got in to the man sitting across the cabin, head bent to his task. There were small paragraphs scattered between the entries. Warm thoughts of his grandmother. Dean got darker images of Cas' mother and oldest brother. His father was never mentioned. Sisters, cousins, aunts and uncles, but no father. Dean read until he couldn't keep his eyes open.
Up in the loft, he knelt before his altar and spoke reverently to his Goddess, asking for guidance. Then he opened up the small box in the corner. Using a small velvet bag, he sorted through the box and added the stones he needed. Amethyst for courage. Moonstone for his Goddess. Agate, Amber, Garnet, and Jade for healing. Beryl for Energy. Calcite for protection. As if an afterthought, he added rose quartz.
He knelt in the pentagram, pointing his athame at the sky and then at the ground. "Spirit of evil, unfriendly beings, unwanted guests, begone. Leave us. Leave this place. Goddess, keep us safe, invisible from harm." He dipped his athame into the ashes left in his cauldron and closed his eyes. He could see the trail of ash left by the gypsies. It surrounded the entire town, reaching out to include all those who lived in the woods. He pricked his palm with the ceremonial dagger and let his blood drop into the cauldron. "Invisible from harm," he repeated softly.
He placed the bowl of salt next to the northernmost candle.
"This is Cas. He's a friend of mine. He's a hunter." The words spewed out of Dean's mouth, and he saw Bobby's eyes widen. "He's an expert in skinwalkers. Done a lot of hunts in New Mexico and Arizona."
Karen, one of the three Amazons that lived in Lafitte, spoke. "Castiel is correct. We have chosen to live in peace with each other and outsiders should they accidently come into town. I trust Castiel's judgment."
The sound that came out of Cas was feral. His hips slammed against Dean's ass, the sound loud in the quiet meadow. Dean felt electric shocks ever time Cas pounded into his prostate. Dean's hand moved faster. He wanted to come...needed to come. "Come on, Cas...almost...there."
"I've never been more sure of anything in my life."
Back at the cabin, Castiel disappeared behind the curtain to dress. He was cold, and the scene in the woods kept playing over and over in his head. He could hear Dean pacing, the steady thump of his boots on the hardwood floors comforted Castiel. For the time being, Dean was still here. The Goddess confused Castiel, she'd said love couldn't be manipulated, but she was using her power to keep Dean in Lafitte.
Damn angel would never learn.
Dean met his eyes and Castiel tried to convey that Dean would be fine if he'd keep calm. Castiel could only imagine what Dean was thinking. He'd stepped into a room filled with the very creatures he hunted. Arif muttered something, but sat down. Missouri walked up to Dean and held out her hand. "My name is Missouri Moseley. I live in the cottage near Castiel's cabin. Welcome to Lafitte."
"Whoa. What for?" Dean backed a step away from the table almost knocking Nimue over. She pushed him forward again, and he gave her a nasty look.
Benny's satellite phone rang, and he took it off his hip. Everyone listened as Benny confirmed that Sam just passed the crossroads. Dean got up to pace, and Castiel kept time to the music on the jukebox by tapping his fingers on the bar. You could feel the tension in the room. When the door opened, all eyes turned.
"You said to save the dancing around naked for the summer. I just informed you that I don't dance."
"He would give his life for you," Lilura stated firmly. She looked at Castiel. "But then, I think you know that."
"When we got to the edge of town, your wolf showed up. She...this is gonna sound crazy, but it was like she was trying to communicate with me. Kind of like Lassie wanting Timmy to follow him to the well."
"You thought they put a love spell on you?"
He awoke to Cas gently shaking his arm. Once Cas left the cabin, Dean got up and poked around a bit. He wanted to go up the ladder and look closer at Cas' altar. But the tub seemed to call to him. It looked so inviting, and he really wouldn't mind relaxing in it. Without Cas to make the water hot, he was out of luck.
His dreams were dark. Sam and his father...yelling...fists... "No, Dad, please..." He'd take the blame for anything Sam did. He was stronger...older...he'd take the beatings. A belt raised high, coming down...not on him, but Sam...not Sam. "No," he screamed over and over. The bastard... "Sam...Sam...Noooooo."
"Like crap. What happened?" Dean felt something in his hand and saw the velvet pouch. A hex bag? He dropped it quickly.
Dean paced for as long as the phone cord would go. Who even had phones with cords anymore? Vampires...that's who. "Sammy...it's complicated."
"Outhouse? Uhm, yeah, about that. Just point me to the nearest tree and I'll be cool." Castiel frowned at him.
Dean was shaking his head, but Bobby hurried to continue. "There's a facility near my place. It's good. My friend, Jody, has her mother there. You can just come see it. It's close enough that I can check on him every day. I can call in some favors and get it paid for by some bogus insurance. You can visit whenever you want...and Dean, you and Castiel could see if whatever is between you is..." Bobby stopped, searching for words. "...Benny tells me Castiel is in love with you; and honestly, I would love to see you settle down."
He got out of bed and did his morning chores while Dean slept. He cleaned out Pierce's litter box and let the cat out to hunt. While she was gone, he filled her water bowl. While he was sweeping the floor, he heard movement on his porch and then three swift knocks. Dean sat straight up in bed. "What..."
Opening the door to his friend, Castiel smiled. He was enveloped in a hug. "I hope you have my order ready, your balm is selling like hotcakes." The balm. With Dean's appearance, Castiel had forgotten all about them. He glanced over at his work table guiltily.
Dean gathered his coat and gloves. They were about to leave when the wind began to howl. Castiel opened the door, and it whipped from his hands. Snow was falling heavily. It had only been about ten minutes since he got the firewood. What was going on?
"Anti-aging balm."
“Dean.” Dean let his eyes roam. The cabin was cluttered with plants, candles, jars…a cat. A cat stared at him from a few inches away. Dean frowned. He disliked cats. Oh, they were pretty creatures, but he was allergic.
Dean dumped everything on one plate and picked out two forks. He poured hot water over tea bags and balanced the plate on top of the two mugs.
Castiel took down two ceramic bowls from a shelf above his sink. "Not a spell, a ritual."
"But Dean, you find it..." Dean stopped him with a fierce kiss. It was punishing because, damn it, Cas was being a dumbass. When he allowed Cas to breathe again, he rose up on his elbows to look down at him.
Dean looked at himself in the mirror, his eyes squinting up in concentration. Huh.
Dean got some more firewood up to the porch, picked up some of the dirty laundry, and washed the few mugs that had been left on the table. All that took him less than thirty minutes. Still no sign of Cas or the aunts. "So, Pierce, where's your daddy?"
Dean flopped down on Cas' bed and picked up the book. He listened to the water filling the tub, and his imagination ran wild. Cas was getting naked behind that curtain. He'd seen Cas in the buff, and it was something he wouldn't mind seeing again. He caught the scent of herbs...roses...something sweet...lavender. Dean heard the slosh of water. Cas was getting in the tub. Fuck. Naked, wet Cas. He glared at the two bags on the mantle. He couldn't blame his feelings on Cas' herbs and stones now.
"He called me; because, he wanted me to go with him on a case after we left here," Bobby said gruffly, letting his dislike for Gordon show.
"You can cook?"
Dean didn't know what to say. No one had ever called him beautiful before. Hot, handsome, sexy...yeah...but beautiful...nope. "Don't sweat it, Cas." Dean realized he'd been using a shortened version of Castiel's name all day. Guess he didn't mind, since he hadn't corrected Dean.
Sam and Bobby both tried to grab John's arms so he couldn't get off another shot, but John fought, lashing out at his youngest son. The metal of the Colt opened up a gash in Sam's cheek, and Sam reared back. "Dad," he cried out, hand holding the wound.
Castiel opened the door to his friend. She bustled in and took off her coat. "The winter is going to be bad this year," she said, hanging it on a hook.
Dean simply grunted his approval and poured some onto his finger. Castiel watched him clean his teeth for a few seconds and then rummaged in his dresser for more sleep pants. He remembered he'd left his laundry at Benny's with all the excitement of Dean's surprise visit. Benny would probably bring them when he came out in the morning to check on him.
“Maybe later, I think we have a little lost time to make up for,” Dean said with a wink.
The witch turned. "Yes?"
"All you have to do is look at him," Zoraida muttered.
"No."
"I don't think there will be dancing..." Zoraida started again, but Nimue's hand came up in a gesture that told Dean he may have gone too far.
"Can you wait a couple of minutes. I want to go with you and string up a line between here and there, so you won't get lost in the storm."
"I believe I saved your life, Dean," the witch said dryly.
"I'm here."
"Right," Dean said, drawing the word out sarcastically.
"She wasn't just a piece of ass. I thought I..." Dean didn't finish the sentence. You didn't talk to John Winchester about loving someone. "She was a nice girl."
"No...just...uhm...startled me. That's all." Crap, crap, crap. Cas spilled his guts to him...was giving him the best blowjob in the whole freakin' world, and he fucked it up. "I'm cool with...that." To prove it, Dean turned over to lay on his stomach and closed his eyes...tight. When nothing happened, he whispered, "I'm ready for you...to...you know...start."
John looked like he was going to disagree, but Bobby cuffed him on the shoulder. "Come on, let's eat, have a beer..."
"Don't freak out. It's only as good as the bullets in it." Gabriel opened the gun, spinning the cylinder. "Only four left."
Sex with Cas would be different than those others. Cas liked to touch.
His husband, the traitor, burst out laughing. Dean sat mortified. The vampire, who he now thought of as a friend, was glaring at him. With a eerie growl, Benny turned away, but not before Dean heard the words 'docking' and 'motherfucker'.
Bobby snorted and then realized Dean was serious. "You think that's what this is?" Bobby fingered the charm before setting it back down. "You take this from a witch?"
“Hunting a wendigo. Saw it before I…passed out.”
The psychic opened her door with a smile. "Castiel, I knew you were coming, so I made your favorite tea."
"Why were you in my woods?"
Dean poked at the offending extra bit of pudge that ran from below his belly button over the crest of his hips. He loosened his towel and pushed it lower, convinced momentarily that he’d just tightened the towel too much and it was causing his flesh to spill over.
"I'm...sorry...Dad," Dean mumbled. Always a disappointment. Darkness overtook him.
"Shit." Concentration broken, the mirror returned to black.
Castiel needed to do something with his hands or he might just wring Dean's stubborn neck. He went to his work table and sat down. He gathered a few jars and opened his grimoire. He was low on burn salve and now was as good a time as any to make up a batch. When he'd counted to ten...twice, he replied to Dean's question. "Others in the town let him drink. Everyone offers. Benny never asks. Gabriel can't volunteer because he's a...was an...archangel."
"Dean, damn it, this isn't your fault. Why do you always blame yourself when bad shit happens? God, Dad lives on fast food and leads a stressful life. Not the healthiest lifestyle."
He had plans for after breakfast. Plans to have sex. Real sex this time. But then it was spoiled by their early morning visitors. Dean felt guilty for wishing Sam hadn't shown up. He loved his brother and wanted to spend time with him, but not now. He wanted to keep out the real world for a few more hours.
Dean finished first and began to clean up. Castiel let him. He was in no mood to argue over who was going to wash dishes. While Dean dried and stacked the plates and cups, Castiel straightened his bedding and stoked the fire. He went behind the curtain and dressed in his pajama pants. Dean was staring out the window at the darkness, and Castiel didn't disturb him. He crawled into his bed and picked up the used paperback Ruby lent him. The writing was truly horrible. He'd only made it to the end of the first chapter, and he was already wondering why Ruby wanted him to read it. He flipped to the cover...who knew there were fifty shades of grey? He spared a glance at Dean, the hunter was flat on his back, eyes closed, Castiel's grimoire laying next to him. Pierce was curled under one of Dean's arms. He should have given Dean some more of his special allergy tea...of course, they weren't really talking. A small sigh escaped Castiel's mouth, and he blew out the candle.
"Can I look at that?" Dean asked, pointing to Castiel's grimoire. Castiel hesitated. A witch's grimoire was sacred, not only were all his spells and recipes in it, but his thoughts as well. Slowly, Castiel closed the book and handed it to Dean. Dean's eyes widened and he accepted it, his eyes locked on Castiel's.
They ate in companionable silence. The soup was delicious. Normally, Dean didn't like anything that didn't have meat in it, but he had to admit the hearty bean and vegetable mixture hit the spot. "Do all witches know how to cook like this?"
"We've had reports of some disappearances in the area and are leaning towards bear attacks. Know where I can find the local sheriff or anyone else that can tell me more about the people who are missing?"
The wolf growled and looked back towards his cabin. "What is it?"
The witch stared into his eyes for several seconds, and then she shrugged. "You will have to ask her. It is not mine to share." Dean frowned.
"Dean, Benny drinks from cattle, but it isn't enough. He needs human blood to survive and we...I...give it freely." Castiel watched the different emotions cross Dean's face. Anger, pain, disappointment. Why was Dean here? "Dean, why are you here?"
Dean nodded slightly and took a large swig of his beer. After he swallowed, he looked around at the three of them. "I'm sorry...this is all my fault, and I don't think any of you should risk yourselves for me. My father is looking for me. If you try to hide me, he'll figure it out. It's best if I just face him, and tell him I'm taking a break from hunting. It's not a lie." Dean took another swallow of beer. "I can't hunt as long as she's keeping me here."
"Ten years ago...before I came here and started all this..." Benny waved his hand around the store. "...I met a hunter. He had me bound with silver chain and was going to take my head, but I told him...I told him that I'd never killed a human. He...he believed me and let me go. I helped him find the nest of the real killers." Benny opened his antiquated cash register and lifted the tray. He pulled out a old business card and passed it to Dean. Dean took it and a soft smile creased his lips. Castiel looked over his shoulder. A tiny clipart tow truck was in one corner of the yellowed card and the words 'Singer Salvage' in large black letters were centered. In smaller print, an address and phone number. Dean flipped it over and in blue ink were two other phone numbers.
With the dim light from a waning moon, Castiel drove the powerful machine carefully. He took a quicker route since he didn't have to stay on the roads or trails. They flew over the snow, the bouncing making Dean whoop and Castiel could hear laughter behind him. It made him smile.
"You seem to be delirious. Let's get you back to bed."
Having the woman...Missouri...tell him he'd have to choose between Cas and his father made Dean sick to his stomach. It was impossible. John Winchester would never be father of the year, but he was his dad. He raised him and Sam. Okay, so raising a kid usually means giving them a stable environment to grow up in. 'Stable' and John Winchester shouldn't be used in the same sentence. Yeah, but he was still Dean's dad. Cas was just Cas. A witch. A witch that was supposed to be Dean's destiny...if you believe what goddesses tell you.
No -- How are you, son? -- No nothing. Dean didn't expect any different. "The case was a bust. Just accidents. I'm heading out now. Where are you? Still in Tennessee?"
"Fuck," Dean murmured and resumed his pacing.
"Yeah." Dean felt bad for him. And if that wasn't crazy. A hunter feeling bad for a vampire. "He really cares about you," Dean said, trying to make up for the fact he knows about this man's personal shit.
"So, you just run out to the supermarket like normal people?" Dean could see the tic in the man's jaw.
Dean asked Cas, "How?"
"I don't think we've been formally introduced." Missouri strode right over to the bed and held out her hand. Dean stared at it for a second before shaking it. "Missouri Moseley and you are Dean Winchester."
Benny, Bobby, and Dean were talking quietly at one of the tables. "I have a thought," Gabriel said, tapping his finger on his chin.
"But you love me," Dean said shyly.
"Oh...oh...yeah...uhm..." He stared at the jar with distrust. "I've always used Astroglide or KY."
"You ever hear of vamps and witches living in the same area?"
Interesting. What had Dean told Sam about him?
Castiel helped Benny push it out into the yard. He got on and started the ignition. Dean swung his leg over the seat and sat behind Castiel, his legs snug against Castiel's, Dean's chest pressed to Castiel's back. It mirrored the time on his motorcycle, but Dean felt more relaxed behind him now. With a wave to Benny, Castiel hit the gas, and the snowmobile leapt forward.
"Okay, Mr. Expert," John cut him off. Dean was staring at Cas in shock. How did he know all that shit well enough to rattle it off like a freakin' grocery list. He confronted Dean again. "What needs to be done to the car? The faster we get it taken care of the faster we can leave this hellhole."
"Sam, this is Benny Lafitte. Take 220 south for 23 miles. You will see the entrance to the Pathfinder National Wildlife Refuge. A quarter mile past that, take a left. The road is not marked. When you get to a crossroads, continue straight and that will bring you into Lafitte. We'll be waiting." Benny hung up the phone. Dean gave him a bitchface.
"Rumors...about this gun?"
Dean sent him a glare and crossed his arms over his chest like a petulant child. Castiel found that he wanted to kiss the pout off of Dean's face. Before he could dissect that thought, Benny asked, "Have you decided on your plan, Dean?"
Dean felt himself blushing. "No...it's...uhm...you're not circumcised," he blurted out.
"What was your grandmother's vision?" Dean purposely left off the part about the true mate. He expected Cas to look at him, but he kept working.
"Sure, why wouldn't I be?" Shall we list them? I've got a 'dad bod.' I'm attracted to a witch. A freakin' goddess is playing matchmaker, and oh yeah, my father is hunting me down. I'm just peachy.
When he got home, Cas was packing up jars into a box. "Don't come near here. I don't want you to break anything else."
The fairy's lip curled in a sneer. "What a shame." His eyes raked over Dean once more before returning to his sister's side. Benny held out a brown paper bag to them and after passing Benny a few stones, the fairies zipped out the door.
She tilted her head and her smile was placating. "My Child, there has been no manipulation. True love cannot be manipulated."
Sighing in frustration, Dean rummaged around in his duffel for something to do.
The wind picked up, sending snow from the tree boughs in all directions. Dean wasn't surprised to see the candles stay lit. He could feel electricity in the air and something seemed to move above Cas. A woman appeared, blonde hair in braids down her back.
Dean pulled back, resting his forehead against Cas', trying to slow his racing heart. "This probably...
Dean dialed Sam first. "Sam, something weird is going on here, and I can't make it out there to get Dad out of jail."
Her smile was hauntingly sad. "Open your heart, my child."
"Dad? What are you doing here?" Dean said innocently. He continued his act by looking at his father's passenger. "And why is Gordon with you?"
He turned and moved over the snow to the south. "Gracious Goddess, guide my actions. Let them always help and never harm others or myself."
Bobby chuckled. "Yeah, Gabriel and Benny filled me in. You've got a real live goddess on your side, Dean. Not many people can say that." Then Bobby looked at Cas. "You must be Castiel. Heard a lot about you."
They quickly got dressed. Castiel was buttoning his shirt when the knock came. "Come in," he called out. Benny, Bobby, and Sam strolled in. Castiel couldn't remember a time when he'd had this many visitors in his cabin at one time. Sam and Benny were big men and made his home feel very small.
"I know you never meant to lead him on or hurt him. He knows that too. But enough about Benny. Tell me about your hunter."
"I apologize, Dean. I find myself placed in the middle of a no win situation. The people of this town trust me to protect them, and while I trust you, you are still a hunter, as is your father."
He allowed Castiel to help him with his t-shirt and flannel. Castiel gave Dean's socks a look of contempt and tossed them aside. He opened a drawer in an old dresser and handed Dean a pair of thick wool socks. He even tied Dean's boots. Dean's bladder was not happy at the amount of time it was taking. "Can we hurry?"
"Either way, I lose," Cas said sadly. She reached over and laid her hand over his.
"Castiel. Though my mother was a witch, she named her offspring after angels. Maybe she did it as a joke...I'm not really sure why she does any of the things she does." When they got to the quartz tub, Castiel stared down at the quilt Dean was holding like a lifeline around his waist. Without a word, the witch turned his back. Dean let the quilt fall to the floor and crawled into the tub. The water was hot, not scalding, but damn close. It felt so good on his chilled skin. The aroma wasn't unpleasant like Dean suspected it would be. He sank down until the water was up to his neck. As if sensing Dean was fine, he turned back around.
"A witch gave it to me," Dean mumbled, putting everything back into the pouch.
"Yeah."
"Cas, do something," Dean pleaded, his face pale. Castiel wanted to assure Dean, but he couldn't. Dark magick could stop the damage happening to John's brain, but Castiel didn't practice it. He couldn't and still keep his sanity.
"I know, Dad...I was just asking..." Dean let his sentence trail off. When his father was drinking, you couldn't win.
"Make yourself at home, Dean. I may be awhile." Castiel put on a sweater over his shirt, added his outerwear, and took a firm hold of the doorknob. The wind jerked it, but he held tight. It took all his strength to close it behind him. He made his way to the lean-to behind the cabin. The snow was so thick he could barely see, but he knew this land like the back of his hand.
Lilura stood with him and Circe in the kitchen area. They followed his gaze. "He will be fine, you know." Lilura said softly.
It took Dean about thirty minutes to get through the rush hour traffic and onto Highway 44. He spotted the motel and saw his father's truck. He parked next to it. His father opened the door and ushered him inside. Dean spied the bottle of whiskey on the table, no glass. The single malt was half gone. His father swayed a bit when he turned. John flopped down on his unmade bed. "We'll head out at nine or so. Four employees and two others have all had heart attacks after visiting the Hall of Mirrors. I'm thinking buru buru."
“Mr. Dean, I can assure you…”
"No...I should probably just..."
"Only a mile."
He added a pinch of the moss that grew even in the winter and picked up the pestle. A noise caused him to tilt his head in concentration. There it was again. The wolf, Chara, was barking. She was coming closer. He stood quickly and opened the door. His friend never made noise unless something was wrong. The huge gray wolf skidded to a stop in front of him, whined once, and ran away a few paces. She looked back, expecting him to follow.
"I came to Lafitte needing peace. The people here didn't care what I was. They only cared if I meant to do them harm. They are my friends. Benny is my friend." Dean snorted. Castiel's voice softened. "He wanted more, but I could not give him what he needed. It ended before it began." Castiel fingered the small red pouch that rested against his skin. Nutmeg for health and strength, bones of a squirrel for sight, a few small crystals. It grounded him.
"Holy...shit...Cas." Dean gasped out, holding onto Castiel's hips to keep from sinking to his knees. Castiel rested his forehead on Dean's shoulder, trying desperately to catch his breath. "Need to sit down, Babe," Dean said between forced intakes of air. Castiel wasn't sure who was leading who, but he was happy to reach the side of the bed. They collapsed together, side by side, hands still holding onto each other.
"No. I love your body...every inch of it."
"Different kinks for different folks, Cas. Some people get off on the whole beat me, whip me, make me write bad checks scene. But if you want to see some real porn, you'll have to get the internet out here."
"So, a spell?"
Stomping his feet to keep warm, Castiel waited. He needed to use the toilet, as well. The door burst open, and Dean all but jumped out. "Fuck...my ass has frostbite...and my fuckin' nuts are hibernating somewhere around my liver."
She ran a fingertip down his bicep. "Sure thing, Darling. We have apple and rhubarb."
"I'm fine," Castiel assured him. "I shall have the balm order ready this afternoon, and I'll bring it into town to save you another trip."
"Do you know where he's headed?"
"Don't come back."
"I should leave; so, you can talk to your man." She rose and laid her hand on Castiel's shoulder. "He's going to need all your support today. Let him make the decision, Castiel. You can't do it for him."
Since the witch was occupied, Dean took the time to really look at his surroundings. The kitchen area was small and the wood burning stove took up a large piece of real estate. It looked like something from Little House on the Prairie. There were a few cabinets and cast iron pans on the wall. Moving on, Dean took a longer look at the shelves that held all the jars of stuff...he'd bet anything there was some eye of newt in there somewhere. The wooden table next to the shelves held a mortar and pestle, a bunch of empty jars, and an old book. The book looked leather bound. Was that the witch's grimoire? If he could manage to steal it, it could help him on hunts. Then, maybe for once, his father would think he'd done something right.
A frustrated sigh escaped his lips.
"No." Dean was so screwed. He'd used the unisex pronoun hoping Sam wouldn't be too curious. He should have known better.
"Silvermist, the hunter belongs to Castiel," Benny's voice came from somewhere to their left. Dean opened his mouth, but closed it again. Knowing him, Castiel guessed he almost rebuked Benny's words about Castiel's ownership, but thought better of it in the face of a sexually aroused fairy.
“I don’t have a dryer.”
They were halfway to town when Benny pulled over. "You might want to toss the mouse, Dean."
Since it wasn't a question, Castiel didn't treat it as such. "We haven't had sex." Why he was telling Benny, he didn't know.
"Oh...I apologize." Cas' face reddened, and he backed away. The curtain closed again. Dean closed his eyes and clunked his head back against the tub. He blew out a ragged breath and then started washing himself. When he was done, he let the water out, dried off, and dressed in his pajama bottoms, but forgot a t-shirt. Sucking his gut in and holding it, Dean came from out behind the curtain to stand with his back to Cas.
"Now that you're going to be living at the cabin, are you going to drag Castiel into this century?"
In true Dean fashion, he avoided talking to Cas about anything that could turn the conversation towards more personal subjects...like true mates. Since Cas cooked and was sharing his home with him, Dean cleaned up the dishes. He was aware of Cas moving around the cabin. Very aware. When he came out from behind the curtain in just a pair of flannel sleep pants, Dean had to turn away.
Lame, Winchester. Lame.
"No..." Dean felt like he was drowning. He opened his eyes, and Cas was there. Why was Cas there? His father would kill him.
"I've got an extra cot upstairs, and Gabriel has a bed." The archangel grinned at Sam lustfully. Gabriel was just teasing, but Sam paled.
"That's freakin' disgusting." Pierce, not caring that her gift was unsavory to its recipient, sat down and began licking her paws. Dean looked at Castiel for help.
"You were thinking it."
Dean could not have been more shocked when Cas told him he'd asked his...fairy godmother or whatever she is...if he was Cas' true mate. He knew he looked like an idiot standing there, and the only word he could manage at the time was 'oh'. Oh, really? Way to look and sound halfway intelligent. The whole hike back to the cabin, Dean mulled over what Cas said. Dean couldn't even ask if Cas got his answer.
The crowd left, but Castiel, Benny, and Dean stayed. Gabriel had been very quiet during the impromptu town meeting, but after putting out three more beers, he spoke. "Do we have a plan?"
They spent their nights exploring each other's bodies. Dean loved to taste every inch of Cas. A year ago, if someone told him he'd be rimming some guy's asshole, he'd have cold-cocked them. In reality, using his mouth and tongue on Cas was a turn-on. The noises he wrung out of the witch made his cock ache with need. Cas wasn't a slouch in that department either...damn, the man had a talented tongue.
Castiel gestured for her to sit down, and Dean did get out of bed. Out of the corner of his eye, Castiel saw him disappear behind the curtain with his clothes.
After finding a cheap motel just north of the Kansas border, Dean opened his backpack to replenish his ammo. He saw the velvet pouch and took it out. It was the bag of rocks Cas had given him. He spilled them out on the bedspread. The polished stones were truly beautiful. Maybe he'd look them up to see what they were one day. He gathered them back into the pouch, but this time, he put it in his coat pocket.
Benny cleared his throat and said, "I suggest we all go back to our homes and get some rest. Castiel and I will keep in touch and let everyone know what is happening.
"Yeah...yeah...but it turns out...it wasn't a love spell."
"I'm not at liberty to say, Dean. I've already put them in danger by giving you the means to find us again," Cas said, poking at the amulet.
Castiel ground the dried herbs into a powder, but his mind wasn’t on the salve he was supposed to be making to sell. His head felt too full, going in several directions at once. Perhaps he needed to get out of the cabin for a while. Since the first snowfall last week, he’d been content to stay inside where the fire kept him warm. Today, he was restless, something was coming. Bad or good, Castiel didn’t know. Perhaps later he would try scrying to reveal the reason behind his unease.
Benny glanced over and gave him a brisk nod. Dean guessed they'd come to an understanding. "I hope you keep your word."
"Listen to me you...you...human..."
Dean was feeling so relaxed now, "Wild? She seemed pretty tame around you." His body was finally warm. He needed to get dressed and get out of here, but he was still feeling as weak as a kitten.
"Dean, I need you to talk to me," Cas said softly.
Movement made him turn his head and he saw a huge creature. His brain, addled from the cold, told him it was a monster, maybe the wendigo. The creature was gray with big eyes and dripping fangs. Dean’s arm finally made contact with something solid, and he hauled himself a few inches out of the water. If he was lucky, he’d die of exposure before he was eaten.
It must have been some sort of magick, but the cabin didn't seem all that small with the six extra bodies. Dean kind of understood what a groom goes through. Cas was surrounded by his aunts; and the talk centered around robes, something called handfasting, and a bunch of other wedding crap. Dean felt left out, but it wasn't like he wanted to talk about the fabric of their robes.
"Will your friend, Benny, be there?" Circe asked coyly.
Dean was frowning at his reflection, turning left and right to assess the situation. Maybe Sammy was right, hewas getting older and needed to stop eating so many burgers and so much pie. But he was a hunter, damnit!
The wolf's ears flicked forward, and she turned her head. Dean heard the sound of the door open and close. Great. He really needed time to think. Dean hadn't meant to growl at Cas. He saw hurt flicker in Cas' eyes. Then they were blank. Then the damn witch told him who to choose. Oh, no, he didn't come out and say, "Yo, Dean, choose your daddy." No, it was more subtle than that.
Offering kind words and soft touches, Castiel tried to get Dean to relax and rest. Silently, he drew circles on Dean's chest. With each circle, he silently thanked the Goddess for bringing him Dean Winchester. As the circles got bigger, so did Castiel's words of love to Brighid and Dean. Until Dean shoved his hand away. He stared at Dean's panic filled eyes. "What..." Before he could finish asking Dean what was wrong, Dean yanked up the quilts and muttered something about going to sleep.
"Remember...not a Christian ceremony, Dean. You will not need a best man. Sam could stand up for you though. The waxing crescent will be in..." Cas thought for a moment. "...four days."
"Yeah," Sam answered.
"No, Dean. Our ceremony will be held here."
"Castiel, you and Dean are true mates." Her voice had lost any trace of the teasing he usually associated with his friend. He looked up, eyes questioning.
"Damn it, Cas. Just give me a Goddamn minute," Dean snarled, pinching the bridge of his nose. It wouldn't go very well if he lost his temper too. He counted to ten. Cas was giving him a bitchface to rival Sam's. "Okay, waking up to you this morning...it was like..." Damn feelings. He had to talk about feelings, and he hated it. He started pacing. Pierce leapt out of his way with a hiss. She jumped up on the bed and sat, tail switching side to side. Even the cat was pissed at him. "It was pretty awesome."
"That's good..."
"Sounds like a wild goose chase," Bobby said. "I've been around a long time, and I think I'd hear if something like that existed."
"Got it all out of your system?" Bobby asked softly.
Mab held her hands up towards the sky and there was silence. Dean saw the other aunts, dressed the same as Mab. "Today, we are celebrating the uniting of two beautiful souls. Will Castiel and Dean come into the circle."
"Those that need it, can find us."
"The only one that I need to impress is Cas," Dean retorted. Her eyes narrowed for a moment and then widened. She looked at her sisters, and Dean caught the slight movement of her head. Cas squeezed his hand.
“Can’t you just throw them in the dryer?” Dean couldn’t keep laying there like a limp dick. He sat up, and the blanket slipped around his waist. The blue eyes drifted down quickly and then back up. Dean caught the slight blush on the man’s cheeks. Interesting.
"But Castiel..." Castiel held up his hand, shaking his head adamantly. Gabriel sighed heavily and slunk off to polish glasses.
A look that could only be construed as pity filled Dean's eyes. "Cas...I'm a fucked up human. You're...you. You have your shit together. I can't even fuckin' find mine."
"Don't you dare presume to tell me what I need to do, Dean Winchester."
He looked at Sam's cheek first and after cleaning it, decided it didn't need stitches. The white butterfly bandage was stark against Sam's skin. Dean's injury was a bit deeper, and he winced when the doctor injected him with Lidocaine. After flushing the knife wound, he quickly sewed it up. "How did you get hurt," the doctor asked conversationally, but Dean knew he was fishing for information. Injuries like theirs usually brought a lot of questions and sometimes cops were called.
Dean didn't expect everyone in the whole freakin' town to be there when they got back from Casper. And he sure as hell didn't expect any of them to lay comforting hands on him and offer well wishes for his father. It was surreal to be in a room full of the very type of creatures he'd killed in his life and suddenly realize they could become friends. Garth, a werewolf, even hugged him. He kept an eye on Sam the whole time. His brother acted like he was fascinated, and maybe a little freaked out, especially every time Gabriel got close to him. A few times, Dean saw the archangel whisper in Sam's ear, and his brother turned fire engine red. It was comical. Under different circumstances, Dean would have found a way to tease Sam unmercifully. But his larger-than-life father was lying in a hospital bed. A fierce hunter who would never hunt again.
"Dean, please, can we talk..." He turned to his friends. "Privately."
"No, Sam. They don't want to kill me. Benny, he's the vampire...he was going to take me to Casper to get a new battery, but then the Goddess started dicking around with us..."
Around the room, heads nodded, and then everyone rose. Benny's plan was a simple one for now. Just monitor the roads in and out of town. Once there was a sighting, everyone would disappear. Lafitte would become a ghost town. Gabriel and Castiel would remain with Dean, his brother, and Bobby.
Dean stared at him for a long time. Castiel met his gaze without flinching. Finally, Dean huffed out a breath and dropped his eyes to the amulet. "You have enough power to make a town disappear on maps?"
Castiel began to chuckle. Dean's mirth grew until both were laughing, tears streaming down their faces. "Please tell me you erased your search history," Castiel finally managed to say. Dean immediately sobered.
No such luck.
"There was one more..."
"Gabriel says the blizzard wasn't normal."
Seemingly satisfied with the water's temperature, the witch stood up. He tilted his head. "Is something wrong?"
After dressing warmly, Dean opened the door. Cas would need some help bringing the wood up to the porch. He froze on the top step. Six women were coming up the path in a straight line. They were all dressed identically...all with black hats. Not like Halloween witches' hats, no, these were black, but more like those worn at the Kentucky Derby. As they came closer, Dean realized they were all about his age, maybe even younger. And Supermodels...what the fuck?
Dean was looking at him as if he'd grown another head. He swallowed thickly and nodded. "Yeah...sure...Cas." Needing to calm down, Castiel yanked open the door of the bar.
"Hey, Benny..." This was harder than he thought it would be. He always imagined if he ever got married, Sam would be his best man. Sam would be the one standing up beside him on the most important day of his life. "Since Sam can't be here...do you think you would..." Christ, he didn't even know if he needed a best man.
"Who are you?" John asked Cas.
"I know I don't have to, but I want to try it." Cas swallowed and gave a quick nod. He placed his hands on Dean's chest and pushed him down. Cas' eyes drifted down his body. It making Dean want to cover himself, but the look of desire was so evident in Cas' face that he kept his hands to his sides.
The aunts gathered around Gabriel to place their drink orders, and soon the eight of them were sitting around two tables that had been pulled together. Castiel excused himself to speak to Gabriel. In a low voice, he asked the favor he'd been thinking of since Dean informed him Sam could not come to their wedding. He explained the situation. "So, you need me to bop over to California, scoop up the delectable morsel and bring him here for your I do's...and then get him back before the clock strikes midnight?"
"Fuck if I know. Anyone else in this town have a car?" Dean ran his hand through his hair. He felt like the world was out to get him. First a blizzard, then the battery...and now, a blown tire. It was like someone didn't want him to leave. Dean froze and met Castiel's eyes. The witch wasn't acting like he was behind any of this, but who else... "Cas, what kind of spell..."
"You know what I am, I know what you are, so I'm not going to pussyfoot around here. There have been some disappearances. I'm here to find out what's going on and gank whatever it is that's causing them. Vampire, wendigo, shifter...whatever."
"Think I could borrow your dad's truck to go up to Casper to get the battery for your car, the parts for my truck, and new tires for Bobby's," Benny asked Dean.
Dean looked down at his hand, still clutched in Missouri's, but he didn't pull away. "My brother and my...friend...Benny's friend too...they're coming..." Dean hung his head for a minute, as if gathering his confidence. When he looked up, he locked eyes with Castiel. Castiel nodded and gave him a reassuring smile. "My father and another hunter are out there somewhere. They're looking for me."
