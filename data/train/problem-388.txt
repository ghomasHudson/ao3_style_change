When neither of the junior detectives seemed prepared to take his word for it, and even Lestrade continued to look skeptical, John continued. “Sherlock Holmes is always here. Always. Sometimes he gets bored and starts mixing mad concoctions, or firing bullets through the walls,” he directed an apologetic look at Mrs. Hudson, “but he’s always here. And I have it on the authority of a member of the British Government that something has gone wrong. That proof enough for you?”
Which had been followed by an honest smile, a kiss on tip-toe, and a night, week, and month of time that were unprecedentedly wonderful. It was like Sherlock had already filled every aspect of John’s life but one, and that last piece had finally been put in place. It had been strange in the most amazing way possible.
John shifted in his chair, fingering the cuff of his wrinkled suit. The head of personnel and hiring, Dr. Sebastian Wilkes, grinned disarmingly.
“Tell them ‘no,’ Dr. Watson.” Mrs. Hudson had entered without his noticing, and was standing at his elbow with empathy in her eyes.
“Sherlock, what’s wrong?” John couldn’t tell if he was reacting to muscle strain, frustration, or even shame. One seemed as likely as the next.
“Did you say something, Sherlock?” John asked, emerging from the bathroom. He took in the sight before him with a sigh, which was better than panic at least. Without saying anything further, the doctor shrugged and lifted his detective fully onto the couch, exactly where he’d been before his little adventure. So much energy expended, and nothing at all to show for it. Sherlock rolled over to face the back of the couch. At least sulking wasn’t beyond his physical limits of the moment.
“Wait, so the whole using-human-bodies-as-petri-dishes thing is the morally legitimate aspect of this business?”  John was having some trouble wrapping his head around that. “Then, what’s the illegitimate side?”
“Of course,” Sherlock responded, carelessly grabbing John’s laptop and flopping down on the couch. “But keeping a low profile is the most sure way to be caught. The best place to hide is in plain sight.” The detective seemed to be using John’s laptop to make notes on the spleen, and John decided not to comment on the appropriation of his computer for the time being.
The flatmate in question was already protesting, shaking his dark head. “I’m fine—don’t even know why it happens.”
A few hours later, back at 221B, John became aware of movement at the other side of the couch. The doctor abandoned his book and turned sharply, concern for his flatmate’s wellbeing already close to the forefront of his mind.
Sherlock sighed, looking extremely put-upon. “Alright, fine. Come here.” The detective angled the screen as he invited John to look at his own computer. John perched on the edge of the couch, and found himself looking at the “About” page of Biopharm Limited’s website. Front and center was a glowing picture of two men in lab coats, the older with a proprietary hand on the younger one’s shoulder.
Moriarty let out a strangled exclamation of rage. Then, he composed his features. “Fine. If you won’t play nice, I’ll just have to change the rules.” He flounced out, a disturbing spring in his step.
The other man shrugged, turning back to his violin. “Pity, we could have split the fee. Think it through next time, will you, Doctor?”
The consulting detective was pulled out of his reverie by Moriarty, who had switched personalities again and had put himself nose to nose with the detective, barely contained rage evident in the mastermind’s face. No wonder it was so difficult to analyze this man; every time one got a handle on him, Moriarty became a different person. Like trying to read a kaleidoscope.
The man on the screen quirked his lips, as if privy to a private joke John was not a part of. “Sherlock Holmes and I have, what you’d call a ‘difficult’ relationship. Nonetheless, I worry about him. Constantly.”
This was new. Throughout his life, the consulting detective had spent far too many stays in his box of poison, and had endured countless attempts by people with various levels of good intent to break him out of it. Mummy had tried to hug him free, Father had tried shouting, schoolmates had tried everything from tickling to fists to make him stop staring into space and speak. Mycroft had even had him arrested once, but nothing helped. Eventually, everyone had accepted that nothing worked, and had individually come to the conclusion that there was nothing for it but to ignore Sherlock, to leave him alone to ride it out.
John looked over at the bed. Sherlock seemed to be asleep at the moment, and the flat was silent with the exceptions of the beeping heart monitor and the chattering radio. Most of the machines had been returned to-- well, wherever Mycroft had gotten them from. John had kept the heart monitor, and the ultrasound machine was dark and silent in a corner, but the rest of the more advanced equipment had gone. John had even put a nail in the wall to take the place of an IV stand after he'd nearly tripped over the spindly thing once too often. Now, the room was much easier to move about in.
Sherlock was bored. More bored than he could ever remember being, as there wasn't even visual stimulation to break the monotony. Having one's eyelids shut in spite of all efforts tended to produce that result. Well, that and frustration. And even more frustrating exhaustion.
Mrs. Hudson continued. “Well, if there’s nothing extra gory about here, then Sherlock mustn’t have gotten home after the mortuary. So he must have gone somewhere else. That Molly girl was very helpful, and maybe someone else around the hospital saw something. Though we should probably wait for morning to ask them, it is getting awfully late.”
Anthea stood in the doorway of the flat, focus on her BlackBerry. Ignoring the other four startled faces in the room, she flicked her eyes up at John.
“Soon enough for you?” asked the voice, with an inordinate amount of glee. Honestly, thought Sherlock. Moriarty takes such pride in being unpredictable, but it will be possible to predict his actions soon enough just by choosing the least rational option available in a given circumstance.
“Most people, yes, but not you. I mean, of course you could, but this was Moriarty! ‘The Game’ and everything!”  John stopped, took a breath.
Biopharmaceuticals Limited certainly lived up to its name. It produced the best drugs, for a price. Treatments of the corporations’ patrons had nearly double the success rates of those performed through city hospitals, a statistic touted on billboards throughout London. Of course, there were the dissenters; rival companies, homeopathic agencies, and human rights activists were always pinning signs up on one streetcorner or another, but the general public paid them little mind.
“Here we go,” John exclaimed, drawing Mrs. Hudson and the Detective Inspector to watch the laptop screen from behind John’s chair. They were met with an awkwardly angled black-and-white video of a London streetcorner. John recognized it as being hardly half a block from the entrance to the St. Bart’s Mortuary.
“Nothing, really.” Anthea’s eyes were back on her BlackBerry as she made her way to the couch and perched neatly on a cushion. “But I have been given instructions to provide your investigation with the resources at my employer’s disposal. Provided they leave, of course.” She flicked her eyes up again, indicating Donovan and Anderson.
Sherlock was glad John talked to him. It was frustrating, not being able to ask any follow-up questions, but the doctor was fairly competent at anticipating them. So Sherlock knew exactly what had transpired from the time John had come to his rescue to the present, when John was still technically rescuing him. The gap between Sherlock feeling the pinch of a hypodermic in his thigh muscle and John's arrival at the factory was still a mystery, though one that had been rather cleared up by later evidence. Sherlock hoped John had photographed his internal organs, though he knew that to be rather unlikely. It just wasn't a John-like thing to do. Ah, well. He'd just have to be content with the ultrasound films.
John internally conceded the point and returned to his earlier statement, looking for a way to amend it. Finally, he spoke to the side of Sherlock’s neck that he could see at the moment.
“Pentagrams, mostly. Thirteen in all, though you can’t see all of them because of the blood. I tried to clamp off everything, but it just wouldn’t . . . it’s only my second year!”
John grinned, feeling pinpricks behind his eyes as well as he leaned over and gathered his detective close in a damp hug.
By that time the tub was mostly filled, so John put one arm under his detective’s shoulders and one under his knees, and with a “Here we go,” expertly lifted the gangly detective into the bathtub. Sherlock gave a little smile as the warm water soaked through his hair.
“Okay, here’s what we know. This morning, at seven-fifteen, Sherlock was here, at 221B Baker Street. He arrived at the mortuary of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital at ten, according to lab employee Molly Hooper, and left with some spare body parts by one pm. But by eight this evening, he wasn’t home yet, and there are no new body parts in the apartment.”
“You can leave the facilities to work out the particulars tomorrow, Captain, but until the paperwork goes through I must ask you to remain here. Corporate espionage, you know. It’s everywhere. To that end, I must ask you to compile a list of personal acquaintances with whom you’ll likely be communicating. There’s a chance someone will come up subversive, but it’s a very small one. Still, better safe than sorry. Best of luck, Doctor.”  And with that, he left the room.
John blinked, a bit taken aback, before responding. “Baker Street would be as good as anywhere. Not much in the way of comings and goings, and Mrs. Hudson knows who we usually associate with. You wouldn’t have to bother moving the cameras and microphones we both know you’ve installed about the flat, and I already know all the ins and outs in case something does go wrong.”
But really, he’d had no choice. Sherlock (he’d asked John to call him Sherlock shortly after expounding John’s entire personal history on the basis of next to no information whatsoever) had turned to Dr. Wilkes (a “Doctor of Business Sciences, who purposely misleads the general public by implying that he’s a medical doctor,” as Sherlock had openly told John while the personnel agent steamed) and asked the fuming man about his own treatment, drawing the response that if (when) Anderson quit on his account, the IP would quite possibly be kept in either physical restraints or they’d scrap the non-drowsy label (which meant a patient could not be given anesthetics, due to either an allergy or a drug history) and put the man in a medically-induced coma for the approximate four months until the potent blood thinner being incubated in the synthetic carrier organ in his abdomen was ready to be harvested. John, of course, had reacted with horror, at which point the stranger had turned his light eyes on him and asked if the doctor’s commitment to his Hippocratic Oath did not require that he do something about it. So although he still wasn’t sure how it happened Dr. Watson found himself no longer trying quite so hard to escape the employ of Biopharmaceuticals Limited.
Sherlock smiled to himself. He had no idea what Moriarty was referring to, but it was obvious the madman had become desperate, and desperation was easily exploited. All the better for John.
Making a decision, John changed the trajectory of his backward movement. He could see the shadows of Moriarty’s feet from under the door, keeping them in his line of sight as he tracked back as far as he could down the hallway. Once he’d gotten to Mrs. Hudson’s door, he stopped, and aimed.
And there were a lot of points to consider. Besides what Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, and even Anthea found out, John had taken the liberty of utilizing Sherlock’s usual unorthodox method of information gathering—the homeless network—as well as dropping in on Angelo at his restaurant. Moriarty had better hope that it wasn’t any of Angelo’s friends that found him, as sweet-talking rarely helps when one is being torn limb from limb.
“Well we didn’t want to hurt anyone, so we did what they said as safely as we could. They’d already knocked the guy out, but there wasn’t any gas so we had to use injections to keep him out. It took a lot, but Jason monitored that,” she indicated one of her compatriots, “and Dan and I did the cutting.” Her eyes grew wide over her mask as she realized how callous that had sounded, but a look from John kept her talking.
“Undeniably. Possibly in no more than consulting capacity, but security protocols must be taken. Surely you understand the gravity of the situation, and it was necessary you be informed. But know that the matter is well in hand.”
John just blinked for a minute. Once he’d gotten his thoughts sorted, he asked the detective, “So what now?”
Sherlock nodded enthusiastically. “Or to know which one was actually killed! I suspect one of the two surviving brothers may have taken the actual murdered party’s place.”
“Mycroft always has this many people at this disposal?” John asked, gesturing to the swarming figures. Anything to keep Sherlock from thinking about the juice.
“Wait, what?” Lestrade was looking between his scanner and the young woman on the couch, one hand on his jacket and the other on his gun.
“Of course not! Look at the way they’ve been varying sizes and membrane thickness. And a program to make the organs x-ray opaque? There’s no way those things are even supposed to store a liquid, never mind one that has to interact with fluids in the body. Biopharm is looking for new ways to store something, but it isn’t drugs.”
“That’s me,” responded the doctor, a bit of color in her cheeks. Anderson, standing half behind her, shot a sour expression at John before pushing past him and out of the room.
They still felt like they were on fire, more so because he’d had to brace the straightjacket’s cloth against his middle while working at it. And Sherlock didn’t entirely trust that he wouldn’t lose consciousness if he were to aggravate them more by bending down.
John was incredulous. “No bearing? How do you expect me to do any hacking when I can’t even make a computer do what everyone can make a computer do in a reasonable amount of time?!”
For a moment he felt eminently strange, standing in the middle of a dark and cramped closet squashed between a wall of medicine bottles and a free-rolling ultrasound machine, but then the screen of the unplugged machine flickered to life.
At that, John started laughing. He knew there shouldn’t be anything funny about breaking in to morgues, but somehow there was, and then Sherlock started up too.
The consulting criminal schooled his face into a facsimile of guilt before brightening. “Yes, sorry about that, but to be fair how was I to know who they’d choose as a sacrifice? Anyway, they’re gone now, so no need to worry about that happening again. At least, not because of those amateurs. If anyone has the right to burn our Sherlock from the inside, it’s me. Only me.”
“Well I do, and this helps.” With a determined air, John put his arms around his friend’s shoulders and squeezed gently.
The doctor looked up as the heart monitor started to beep a bit faster. "I know, it's cold. I tried warming the bottle up a bit, but if I'd waited too long you'd have fallen asleep again and you might not have woken up until morning. Tomorrow, I'll plan further ahead."
John sighed. Most people didn’t question such things as hugs. But most people weren’t Sherlock Holmes. So John, as always, attempted to give his unusual friend as honest and complete an answer as he could come up with.
I realized that no matter how many times I tell myself I am going to pick this back up, there's a good chance I won't. So instead, I'm just going to tell you what happens.
It had all started with a rather unusual cult, bent on achieving enlightenment through ingestion of some strange cocktail of substances as set out by an Elizabethan-age manuscript. It had been a diary kept by a relatively high-level clergyman, in which he’d detailed the confessions of all the people in the region who had, under torture, admitted witchcraft. One woman had apparently been particularly creative, and had detailed a procedure by which one could attain ultimate knowledge. This had, of course, intrigued Sherlock, leading him to take on the cases of the cult’s victims (apparently, quite a number of the ingredients consisted of vital pieces of the human anatomy, which had been surgically removed from their previous hosts with little concern for whether the bodies in question could survive the procedures). Unfortunately, the cult in question had become aware of the consulting detective’s attentions, and decided he’d be an excellent sacrifice.
It had been a long time since John felt quite the way he did at this moment. Here he’d been expecting to find his friend in some life-threatening predicament, one from which only the intervention of John’s common sense could have saved him, and here the man was standing in the middle of the hallway, a very damaged straightjacket hanging from his shoulders and bruises on his face. One did not have to be Sherlock Holmes, World’s Only Consulting Detective to see that John’s closest friend had clearly fought his own way out of whatever predicament he was in. John felt glad, of course, as Sherlock was alive, but also frustrated, concerned, angry, and vaguely proud.
But John’s eyes went to the light blue surgical sheets that covered his flatmate’s midsection, and to the gaping abdominal cavity they circled. He took in the reports from the monitors and, gun still trained on the cowering trio, stepped up to the operating table.
“Alright, bathroom then. Suppose I should have guessed that, you’ve been eating after all, and catheters are for urine, which is only cellular waste. But you knew that.”
“But I’m your doctor first. And to be an effective doctor, I have to make sure you don’t die. And if you don’t tell me what you’re doing, I can’t do that now can I?”
The doctor was overcome by a sudden wave of disgust and only just managed to stumble from the room. The agent, alarmed, followed.
Two hours later, Sherlock still wasn’t home and John was getting concerned. It wasn’t that it was so unusual for a capable, reasonably responsible adult to come home late now and then, and it wasn’t that Sherlock Holmes was in the habit of keeping his flatmate posted about his comings and goings. It was just that there was nowhere John could think of where Sherlock would be at this hour. It wasn’t like he had a girlfriend, or a boyfriend, or even a platonic friend to go out with in the evenings, and there was nothing in the way of entertainment outside their apartment that the detective found any less dull than sprawling over the couch and blasting holes in the opposite wall. No, if Sherlock was doing anything at all, it was related to either a case or an experiment.
For the first time in the exchange, Sherlock seemed genuinely surprised. “Alright, then . . . John.”
“Alright.”  John was feeling a little lightheaded. “So, all I have to do is break into the company vice president’s office, stick a travel drive into his desktop, and we’ll be on our merry way?”
“Alright, then. I’ll just get you cleaned up.” John tipped Sherlock further against himself as he reached for the toilet paper. As he gently cleaned off his love, John noticed that Sherlock had turned further in on himself again. His head was twisted as far from John as it would go, and the detective seemed to be trying to curl up into a ball. If he’d been on a couch, he would have been facing the back of it.
“Phase One of how many?” asked Sherlock, judging the width of the hallway he could see through the open door of his cell.
John folded the laptop and stood up. “Call the local hospitals,” he instructed Mrs. Hudson as he looked about for his coat.
He found the man and took the note he’d surreptitiously passed to him. John’s first instinct was to read the note immediately, but he fought it. If Moriarty had caused the CCTV to go offline, John could be fairly certain he was being watched. And, thought John as he heard a police siren in the distance, if he could cause such an increase to violent crime, I can be sure I have a target on my back. But such thoughts were hardly helpful. All John could do was get back to Baker Street as quickly as he could, and trust the gun in his belt if anything went wrong. The doctor was usually hesitant to use his illegal handgun, hesitant to even bring it out in public, but these were not the usual circumstances. As he rounded the corner and opened the door to 221B, he just hoped he wouldn’t be too late.
Though hopefully he wouldn't have to for much longer. The detective knew his pain meds had been reduced again before John even told him, and movement was getting easier. Now, Sherlock could move his fingers almost without effort, and he'd even managed to work his jaw a few hours previously. John had noticed the movement, as his head had been resting by Sherlock's shoulder at the time, but the doctor's excited intake of breath had been drowned out by the frantic beeping of the heart monitor. John had silenced it, but admonished his flatmate with an angry "Don't DO that!" before softening a bit.
In a moment of inspiration, John shifted his grip on Sherlock’s hand and arranged it so that while John’s two fingers pressed into Sherlock’s wrist, Sherlock’s fingers pressed into the pulsepoint of John’s. Almost immediately, the detective settled back into a more peaceful facsimile of sleep.
The criminal pouted once more. “But I haven’t even seen Sherly yet! I’ll tell you what—send him down, and I’ll leave once our chat is done. Or, you can wait for the police to get here, and I’ll blow them all up when they do!”  Moriarty indicated his vest. “Your choice, Johnny!” he called as the doctor slammed the door in his face.
Dr. Watson had seen a lot in his career, but never anything like this. Not only had those children cut in to Sherlock, needlessly hurt his Sherlock, they had done so in a manner that was both cruel and criminally unsafe.
“She clearly didn’t send all of them, John,” called the detective from the kitchen.  “Molly sent six, and Mycroft added the other two himself. He even left a note, wants me to take a look. Do his work for him, more like.”  And at that, the consulting detective promptly lost himself in his experiment.
“Fine! I escaped because if I hadn’t, you’d have started limping again! Is that the answer you were looking for?”  The detective tried to bring his knees up to his chin, but was prevented from doing so by his broken ribs and had to settle for folding his arms petulantly instead.
John pressed the mug to his detective’s lower lip and slowly started to tip the liquid into his mouth. The first swallow went fine, as did the second, but by the third the detective was tiring. Unable to keep up, he felt a few drops of the warm liquid track their way down his chin. Sherlock let his head tip backward and made a sound he hoped passed for an angry, frustrated moan. Even to his own ears, he sounded weak.
John looked around, a bit disconcerted to know that a good number of the black-suited figures surrounding them had probably been following him on CCTV footage at some point or another. No wonder Anthea hadn’t had to give anyone directions to Baker Street when she’d called that mysterious number on her speed dial. Actually, come to think of it, she hadn’t had to tell anyone anything. She’d just pressed a button, and the cast of every action movie John had ever watched had appeared on their doorstep. Suddenly, John wondered where Anthea had gotten to. Everything had sort of sped up after Rescue Force One had shown up, and Mycroft’s PA, as well as Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson, had sort of been swept out of the way. The latter two had descended on them the minute John led Sherlock out of the building, the officer shouting and the landlady sobbing and both somewhat hysterical. But Anthea was nowhere to be seen. John decided to ask Lestrade about it as soon as he and Mrs. Hudson were done writing up their official statements (on which Lestrade himself had insisted, although John was quite sure this matter would never reach official channels beyond Mycroft’s personal army).
“And you will be administering all medical treatment yourself?” Mycroft said, once again with that condescending smile.
The detective seemed confused, as well as annoyed, at John’s persistence in taking care of him. But as far as John was concerned, one of them had to. The doctor had even had one stroke of brilliance; Sherlock would let him check his blood pressure, heart rate, anything, so long as he let the detective use the equipment for his experiments when he was done. Officially Sherlock told John that constantly utilizing the doctor’s privilege to any and all of Biopharm’s available machinery now would be a good cover in case they had to appropriate something quickly later, but the doctor had a feeling his detective just enjoyed playing with the machines.
John took a breath. He could hardly even start to point out all of his problems with this plan. After a moment, though, he settled on the most obvious.
Which was why Sherlock was currently shredding the seams of the straightjacket’s offending fabric. He almost laughed to himself—wasn’t it just a few hours ago that he’d compared himself to a spider, and here he was pulling the anchors from a polyester web?
“Sooo nice to see you awake, Sherlock Holmes!”  The hair went up on the back of Sherlock’s neck. He’d known this was a plan of Moriarty’s, but actually hearing the sing-song, horribly sweet voice didn’t bode well for his current situation.  Often, Moriarty acted through third-party agents, agents likely to make mistakes which Sherlock could exploit. If Moriarty was being direct with this one, careless errors were significantly less of a possibility. Of course, Moriarty wasn’t actually in the room with him; the voice was coming from a rather low-quality speaker somewhere behind his chair, although it was difficult to tell through the significant echo as the sound bounced around the now-apparently small, probably concrete-walled room. Still, the consulting criminal hardly ever used his own voice to communicate. If this particular scheme was exciting enough to Moriarty for him to participate in such a personal manner, it would definitely require more than the average brainpower for Sherlock to puzzle his way out of it. Just the thought of it gave him an adrenaline rush.
The doctor couldn’t help but grin at the familiarly childish tone. “Not yet, Sherlock. We don’t know if it’s safe out there. Besides, you were practically in a coma less than a week ago, you can stand another few days in the flat. Don’t you have any more cases you can take care of from here?”
The IP had opened a spreadsheet of Biopharmaceuticals Limited’s expenditures, and was now looking at John expectantly. “Do you see it?”
“It’s all fine,” John heard himself whisper as he felt thin, wet fingers tentatively spider their way over and around his back, completing their circle. “It’s all going to be just fine.” And for the first time, John himself actually believed it.
John knew full well that he was grasping at straws, but he wasn’t about to stop. He took a breath, and called the ersatz rescue team to attention.
“Actually, I opened the door so you wouldn’t,” responded the doctor shortly. He checked over Moriarty’s shoulder to make sure no one else was on the street. Luckily, it was deserted.
Progress had gone significantly more quickly since the bout of hypoglycemia had run its course and the detective regained complete control over his hands. Of course he was still shaking, or pretending to, but even faking tremors wasn’t really a distraction. And this endeavor didn’t promise to be over quickly; the stitching of the straightjacket was well-reinforced and each loosened strand of stitching was a struggle. Sherlock had made a gap in the seam big enough to fit one finger through, but that was all. And he needed at least two fingers if he was going to start on the other sleeve.
“You’ve got next to no chance at this point. And if you get too close by accident, they’ll move him. And then we’ll have nothing.”
Dr. Watson reached the fourth door on the left, only just remembering Sherlock’s advice to knock before entering. The reason became apparent, as he only just managed to catch the nurse Anderson extricating himself from the arms of a tall, attractive doctor. John schooled his expression to pleasant neutrality, and asked, “Dr. Donovan?”
And John grinned, going on to bring his best friend in the world through every single step of his deductions.
Tea led to applesauce, and applesauce led to oatmeal as another week passed. Sherlock still couldn’t open his eyes or speak intelligibly, but he managed to communicate what he wanted well enough by emoting facially and vocally. It went a bit like a game of Twenty Questions, but John knew his detective well enough to narrow most possibilities. Plus, almost anything Sherlock could be saying could be narrowed down to “Come here” or “I’m bored/I hate the world,” (more commonly). Keeping Sherlock fed was entirely John’s job, as the detective was no more likely to try to request food than he generally was to obtain it himself. But all in all, it wasn’t so horrible an existence for either of them. Well, Sherlock may have considered it horrible, but John was still counting his blessings. As far as he was concerned, having his Sherlock alive and with him was so much better than he could have expected, nothing else really mattered.
“How? How did you get a message out?”  Moriarty’s voice was rushed, but the intrigued madness within was readily audible.
John hiked up the pajama shirt he'd put on his flatmate and spread the ultrasound jelly over the impossibly pale skin. He was careful to avoid the pale pink incision site, even if danger of infection was virtually past.
Sherlock shook his head. “Don’t worry that you won’t be up to task, John, everything you need will be on a flash drive. It will, in simplistic terms, ‘suck out’ the relevant data and send it to the appointed government account. All you need to do is plug the flash drive into the vice president’s computer. Honestly, even Anderson could probably do it.”
Blinking away what wasn’t quite a tear, Sherlock pulled his blogger close, emphasizing his point as he replied, speaking into John’s hair, “No, my heart is perfectly safe.”
After Sherlock’s mood, things improved drastically. He wasn’t much better at walking for a sustained period of time, but was able to navigate the flat with short spurts of mobility. But most dramatically, the detective was in higher spirits than John had seen in weeks, maybe months. Propelling himself from chair to mantle to kitchen laboratory, solving case after case on his (or John’s) laptop, Sherlock had hardly ever seemed in more control of his faculties. Privately, John wondered if Sherlock’s black moods were his brain’s way of recalibrating. If that were true, it was certainly an effective, if heartbreaking method.
Just then, his pager went off. John sat for a long moment, as if he could avoid the inevitable choice by refusing to acknowledge the passage of time. But he knew he couldn’t, and the adrenaline in his blood reminded him that every second spent doing nothing was a second he was helping no one at all. What sort of person was he, to be so selfish?
Shaking his head, John returned to the book he’d been neglecting since Sherlock had come over and sat on it and him. Then, he was interrupted by the doorbell. A look at Sherlock confirmed that, so deep in his experiment, the detective hadn’t even noticed the interruption, so John made his way down the stairs to answer it. It was too early in the day to be one of Mycroft’s people with take-away, so John was slightly suspicious. Mrs. Hudson was out, and he assumed she may have left her key, but that didn’t stop the doctor from making sure his gun was still tucked in the back of his jeans.
“It’s never safe out there, and that’s what you like about it. And no about the cases.”  The detective folded his arms around his knees, sunlight coming through the still-drawn curtains dappling his arms. Sherlock was currently perched on John’s chair, which John had already been occupying, but neither of them particularly minded the arrangement. “Finished those. I need to see the bodies for the last two Lestrade sent. There was a murder at a convention of identical triplets, John! And the other one involves monkeys! I have to solve these, they’re interesting,” he pouted.
John looked up, confused. This was all moving a bit quickly for him. He looked to Sherlock, who gave a nearly imperceptible nod. “Yes?”  John answered, and Wilkes indicated yet another box to which the doctor had to sign his name. With that, the personnel agent closed the folder and made his way to the door.
Some time later, and John couldn’t have said if it was minutes or hours, he felt Sherlock stiffen, and heard a few soft little splashes. The doctor gave it a minute, before asking, “Done?”  John felt the dig of a chin nodding into his back.
John looked to where the syringe was drawing blood from Ms. Hooper’s arm. The skin there was pockmarked from where it had been done before, scars upon scars. And he saw other telltale signs of repeated trauma: IV marks on the back of her hand, shaved patches on her scalp, and odd lines and raised sections in her hospital gown that spoke of multiple surgery scars. In the old days, this woman would have been diagnosed with Munchausen’s Syndrome and given psychological help. Today, she was a model volunteer.
So, that's that. Or at least, I think it is. I just figured that I knew how it ended and I thought someone else might want to know, too.
John sighed. He wasn't sure if Sherlock could hear him, but at least the heart monitor had calmed down. He removed the ultrasound wand from its notch and ran it back and forth through the stretch of clear jelly, eyes focused on the black-and-white screen. As he'd expected, the grainy image didn't show anything different from what it had shown yesterday. No suspicious masses, no unidentifiable bodies, just organs reasonably close to where they should be.
When Sherlock’s hair stopped actively trying to trap John’s fingers, the doctor grabbed soap and washcloth and gently started to clean his way down the rest of his detective’s body. Neither person made a sound as John worked, such communication rendered entirely superfluous. For in every fold of skin, plane of muscle, ridge of scar, and knob of bone the doctor covered and rinsed of soap, he inscribed just how much he cared for his detective, saying with his hands what he couldn’t with words.
After a stunned silence, John blinked several times and stood up, once again taking control of the situation.
By the time the pain in his ribs had reduced to a dull throb, Sherlock had determined the age and make of the speakers and visible camera in the room, the chemical composition of the concrete walls and how it differed from the floor, and the approximate iron levels in Moriarty’s blood (a few drops had fallen on Sherlock’s shoulder when he’d broken the criminal’s nose). But most importantly, the detective had determined the age, brand, and level of wear of the handcuffs about his ankles.
Except, John admitted to himself, that he was. Sherlock was a genius, but he had little to no sense of self-preservation and if John didn’t keep the detective from getting himself killed, no one else would. Ergo, John worried about him.
John shook his head. He was in a place of perfect tunnel vision now, seeing nothing but the problem at hand and thinking nothing but how to fix it. He turned to the girl one last time, nodding to himself.
So shame, then. Not warranted, but not entirely unexpected; it’s one thing, John had learned, to be entirely helpless, but straddling the line, living on the tantalizing border of independence, was a whole new level of miserable. The doctor had seen it more times than he could count, and thought relating that fact might be appreciated. Smiling sadly, John started, “Don’t tell me you’re embarrassed. I’m a doctor; I’ve dealt with far worse from people I’ve liked a lot less. You should hear some of the things that went on in residency, especially in the geriatric ward.”
It hadn’t taken John long to pack; most of his belongings were still in long-term storage, so it should have been a matter of a phone call and a credit card number to extend his lease on the unit. The doctor had, however, encountered an inordinate amount of trouble trying to work the storage facility’s automated purchasing system. Finally, a neighbor (who’d evidently grown fed up with the shouting) advised John that, if he just said nothing into the phone except “agent,” he’d get an actual human being on the line. Things went more smoothly after that.
Just having to be content with things had become a theme lately. Two weeks of almost-continuous consciousness and absolutely no physical control had been something of a nightmare. In fact, if Sherlock slept more often, he was sure he would be having nightmares about this eventually. John would probably have the nightmares for him, come to think of it. The doctor certainly did everything else for him.
“You see, “ Moriarty went on, and Sherlock allowed himself a grim smile. “You seem to be under the impression that you’re important to the outside world. That the people there need you, Even, “ his voice became simpering, “That they care about you.”
The detective wouldn’t allow himself to dwell on Moriarty’s threat in the latter part of the message. If all went according to plan, it would never be carried out. And if all didn’t go according to plan, he didn’t doubt he’d be able to manipulate a message out to John before the criminal invariably ended Sherlock’s life. It would be more damaging than if the detective were to get home and reassure John himself, but it would be better than nothing. Sherlock wondered, not for the first time, what Moriarty had meant yesterday when he’d said he’d be changing the game. The consulting detective hoped it had nothing to do with John. His flatmate was such an emotional person, he’d be highly susceptible to psychological methods of inflicting harm. Another reason John was off limits.
Yes, he thought. Yes, he could. Because it was for Sherlock. There were other doctors who could help everyone else, but his best friend needed him. But John wasn’t even sure he could help Sherlock, and there were people, bleeding people, who he could save for certain. It went against the very fabric of John’s being to leave anyone in need, friend or stranger, and whatever he did, Dr. John Watson knew he would be haunted by it.
“Sherlock hasn’t come home,” he said. And then, in response to the silence on the other end of the line, “Which is weird for him.”
With that, John opened the closet door and stalked out, cane clacking on the hallway floor. But he didn’t entirely miss the slow smile that spread across Umbrella Man’s face, right before the ultrasound machine’s screen flickered back to black.
“How nice to see you, little pet!” squealed the deranged criminal as John cracked the door open. “May I come in?”
“We didn’t want to!” she wailed. “We didn’t know what we were doing! Dan’s friend just brought us the organs for his group, said they were animal parts, and we just cauterized the shapes he wanted! Today was the first time any of us knew they were human, and they had guns, and—”
“A good concept, but one that will take time. Or, a lot of people.” He turned to DI Lestrade. “Can you put some cars on that? Canvassing the area between here and St. Bart’s to see if anyone noticed something?”
John was having trouble keeping his eyes open. He’d been staring at a map of London for hours, and didn’t seem to be seeing any more possible places where Moriarty could be keeping Sherlock. But since earlier that night, when he’d told Sarah, his employer and friend, that he couldn’t help with the emergencies at the surgery, John hadn’t been able to bring himself to give up in even the smallest of senses.
Sherlock sat up and undid the last knot anchoring him to the chair with one hand. Then he stood, balanced for a second, and made his way out into the hallway. The detective stumbled a bit, blinking in the light, but anchored himself against a wall and started making his way in the opposite direction from that in which Moriarty's hired help had gone. It had been patently stupid for the thug to leave his captive in such a manner, and Sherlock thought it would be a good idea to be gone before anyone else pointed this out to him.
Sherlock attempted a shrug. “Of course. Not mine,” he added when John started at the dried blood on the detective’s shoulder.
Sherlock Holmes was bored, as well as annoyed with his captor. This certainly wasn’t what the Game was all about, sitting in a room with nothing but a low-key struggle with nicotine addiction for entertainment. No, he wanted to be doing things, deducing things, fighting Moriarty in a battle of wits. But it seemed that the particular lesson the criminal was trying to impart had less to do with Sherlock himself and more to do with the people around him. Moriarty had come right out and said that he was trying to prove to Sherlock how useless his companions were, which indicated that he was setting them a challenge instead of the detective himself, setting them challenge at which Moriarty had already decided they had no chance of success.
Eventually Sherlock is in too bad shape to continue running John off his feet, as he's pretty much delirious. This is the first time he ever really opens up about how he didn't know he was lonely until now that he isn't. John is touched. John does not really need to open up in return, as Sherlock does it for him by deducing all of his pains and their reasons while he's too out of it to know any better (even less of a filter than usual). Sherlock pretends not to remember the conversation. John knows he's pretending, but doesn't call him on it.
John shook himself out of his reverie and handed his mobile phone over. As the other man sent a lightning-fast text, John asked, “So, the exploding IV bag was because he took your phone away?”
Sorry if this reads a bit strangely, I wrote it and was so excited to post, I didn't have the patience for my usual editing process. Hope you like!
She looked even more panicked, but answered, “I think it was, at least mostly, because of how the tissue responded.”
After a quick glance at the two monitors that were displaying Sherlock’s vital signs (slightly distressed, but not dangerous enough to call for medical intervention), John joined him on the bed. He stroked his flatmate’s head with the hand that wasn’t circling his wrist, murmuring softly.
Still on his guard, and trying not to give anything away, John replied, “I know that he’s not a usual sort of patient.” He kept his face stoic.
“We were as safe as we could, but one of them said to remove everything but the organs, and cauterize the shapes on all of those, and somebody kept chanting something I couldn’t understand except that I think it was Latin, and throwing all this salt over the surgical field!”
“Instead of going back up right away, I’m going to give you a bath. It’s been a while, and I don’t relish making a trip back up those stairs just now anyway.” He spoke directly into Sherlock’s ear, hair tickling his nose.
“You see, the important part is that you’re alone. And that you’ve been kidnapped. And that no one knows where you are. But the real point of this exercise is for you to see what I’ve known all along: The people out there aren’t worth your time!”
It made sense that Moriarty would enjoy using such paraphernalia on others; he’d doubtless seen the inside of a mental hospital at least once. Probably during childhood, before he had the experience to keep himself away from such places.
John dropped his head into his hands. The idea that someone could do this, could hurt so many people because of a vendetta against one, left the doctor numb. But what hurt is that it just might work. John had sworn an oath to save lives, and when the hospital called him, as they surely would, could he bring himself to turn them down?
John threw his phone against the couch. For the umpteenth time, he realized just how much he’d bitten off when he’d become flatmate to Sherlock Holmes. It wasn’t enough that he followed the man everywhere when he was on a case, now he was going to worry like a mother hen between cases as well? Sherlock wasn’t his responsibility!
“H’lo?” asked the Detective Inspector blearily. It wasn’t much past ten pm, but he’d fallen into a habit of going to bed earlier between cases.
“No, the intestines in his hair were because he took my phone away. Exploding IVs are just because he’s annoying.”
John took a deep breath and blew it out noisily through his nose. What should he do? Get Sherlock was the obvious answer, but the doctor was loath to take his eyes off the shadow of Moriarty he could see from under the door. And besides, he wasn’t even entirely sure it was a good idea to get Sherlock involved. He still wasn’t at his best, but what choice did the doctor have, really? He’d just edge as far as he could up the stairs, tell Sherlock what was going on, threaten him with bodily harm if he did something stupid, and let the genius take care of it. It may not be a good plan, but John didn’t have a better one. As he backed towards the staircase, his hand rose unbidden to the gun in the back of his jeans.
Sherlock turned his head to look at the doctor, one eyebrow raised. “I could ask you the same question.”
“Dr. Stamford! Molly! I’d like to introduce you to Dr. Watson, one of our prospective new recruits!”
John stood firm. “Everyone keeps saying that this case is unprecedented, which means there is no expert to consult. All they’ll be doing here is supportive care, which any general practitioner knows how to do. I’ll borrow what I need from Sarah or from here. But I’m not trusting Sherlock’s safety to anyone else. Not now.”
Getting Sherlock to the bathroom wasn’t easy; even if the detective wasn’t heavy, he was still long. But eventually they made it to the flat’s full bath, and with only minimal bumps and bruises to both doctor and patient.
Dr. Stamford looked up and nodded from where he was drawing the blood of a cheerful-looking young woman. She waved at John with her free hand, and said, “Welcome to the family, Dr. Watson!”
John was still incredibly wrongfooted, but couldn’t deny that, if this man was doing what he said he was doing, he’d be more than willing to help. But then again, whether or not the obviously brilliant man was telling the truth, or even sane, had not been established to John’s satisfaction. Still, he was unsure how to pose the question. “Are you or are you not delusional?” seemed like a rather ineffectual way to put it.
Sherlock looked at him approvingly. “Now, we act as any other doctor and patient. In a month from now, however, I will be on the operating table and you will hack into the administrative mainframe and steal every bit of data you can.”
Lestrade was having a bad day. Not only had they arrived too late to find any of the willing criminals, there had been the business of Sherlock cut nearly in two. When Doctor Watson had decided to operate something in the detective’s mind said that it wasn’t protocol, and common sense dictated that no doctor should operate on someone they cared for, but the ambulance hadn’t arrived yet and he hadn’t really been in the mood to face down the blade of a scalpel.
“Third: If, after you were shot, you had been given the choice to stay in Afghanistan or return to England early with a full military pension instead of your new contract, would you have returned?
It would be one thing if the shaking was random, Sherlock thought to himself, but it happens to a far greater extent when I proactively try to move. Moriarty will certainly notice the discrepancy, and will inevitably use more secure precautions if he gets any indicator that I’m trying to escape.
Just then, the bleeping sound of a received text message filled the apartment. John looked down at his phone, but it wasn’t the one responding. So, Sherlock had obviously left his cell back at the flat. John felt his shoulders relax even as he filled with exasperation, and started in the direction of the noise, digging through the permanent piles of notes that covered their dining room table until he found the phone in question.
The doctor shrugged, resigned. “No idea. Talks through ultrasound machines, carries an umbrella, says he’s worried about you—”
John grinned and kissed his detective. “Fine, I suppose we can go to the morgue tomorrow. It will give me time to arrange things with Mycroft and Lestrade, plus it’s unlikely you’d get access today anyway as it’s Molly’s day off.”
Sherlock had effectively weakened the stitching of the straightjacket to a point where the seam would pop free at relatively little force (handy—he didn’t know how much force he could muster at the moment), and now he was working on the handcuffs at his ankles.
John turned back to Sherlock and gathered him off the floor. Despite the previous moment’s levity, the detective still seemed largely closed off. It was nearly imperceptible, but the doctor had a lot of practice identifying his detective’s emotions. And when he saw this little sign of shame, he couldn’t help but hold a little tighter.
Even still, the sudden light burned through his eyelids, leaving a negative image of the flamboyant madman who was already speaking.
Which was good, of course, but it all reminded John that there was nothing proactive to be done for his flatmate. Tissue would repair, stitches would dissolve, and inflammation would go down, all with time. And until then, sit on the bed with an eye on the door and your gun in your hand.
“In which case he’ll be left without any physician and we could lose the drugs for good. And the cost will be coming out of your salary.”
It was a good sign, John thought, and he leaned over Sherlock, one hand splayed across his back, and whispered, “It’s late. Would you like to come to bed?”
Mycroft bristled a little at this, showing more emotion than John had ever seen from him. “You are insinuating that my watch has been useless. Do you have any idea how many times it has saved my brother’s life? Has saved yours?”
“As you have seen I know almost everything about you, but there are still questions it would benefit us both if you would answer. First: You do not want to be here. The money is better than what you’re used to, so it can only be a moral obligation. I am already ninety-eight percent sure that this is the case, but your answer will confirm it, and I’ll know if you lie. Are you or are you not morally opposed to Biopharmaceuticals Limited?
At that point, Sherlock had been tempted to try pushing closer to his doctor, but he didn't want to set the heart monitor off again and he really was very tired. But when John took his wrist, as he always did before allowing himself to fall asleep, Sherlock determinedly pressed his fingers against John's pulsepoint.
“You’re probably right,” responded John, sounding annoyed with himself. “Sorry to bother you. Good night.” He hung up.
The doctor pressed the power button on his phone and aimed the screen at the lumpy couch, on which Sherlock had been draped when John went to sleep. No consulting detective. He checked the hospital bed, still no consulting detective. A quick scan of the room didn’t reveal anyone, either.
Internally screaming in frustration at how small his steps towards regaining independence were, the detective relented and opened his mouth a few centimeters.
The doctor put the pamphlet in his pocket and got off the tube at the stop closest to Biopharm, struggling a bit with the box under one arm and his cane in the other hand. People on the stairs did their best to make way for him, but it still took a lot of jostling and shoving to get out of the busy underground and onto the busy street. Looking at his watch, John noted that he had a few more hours of freedom before he had to be back under the facility roof. He briefly considered finding a place for lunch before scrapping the idea; toting a box around searching for food didn’t seem very enjoyable, and quite honestly John was looking forward to getting back to his dubiously-chosen workplace, if only for the incredibly unusual man within. His Partner In Crime, as it were. Or maybe Partner In Crime Prevention. At any rate, it was certainly an exciting business, and in spite of himself John found himself enjoying it.
Closely followed by the music. Sherlock wasn't completely bored by music, which was an infinite improvement over the relative silence of the first two lucid days, although he did much prefer the local news. John was surely aware of this, so the only explanation for the switching back and forth was that the doctor was trying to instill in his flatmate a sense of time of day. If it were merely to break up the monotony, the time between the switching of stations wouldn't be so consistent from one day to the next.
“Give me a minute.” John stood up and went over to the desk, returning with his laptop. He opened it without turning it on, and placed his detective’s hands over the keys.
“Don’t lie to me!” Moriarty’s voice was growing more hysterical. “On their own—they couldn’t have—those useless—You! Get Holmes, he’ll answer our questions later, whether he wants to or not!” There was another crackle, and the speaker was off.
Sherlock sighed dramatically. “Alright, perhaps that was a reasonable conclusion to your tiny little brain, but if you’d looked around the room for more than a minute, even you would have seen that there were no signs of a struggle.”
Dr. Watson was seated on the Underground with his solitary box of belongings, headed back from the tiny bedsit in which he’d been situated while awaiting his new assignment. Partially to pass the time and partially as an excuse to avoid eye contact with fellow passengers, he’d started reading the pamphlet Wilkes had given him before sending the doctor on this brief sabbatical. It was printed with the Biopharm Limited logo, and the overly-cheerful cover read, “Incubator Patients and You: What a New Doctor Needs to Know.”
When John got back upstairs after setting Mrs. Hudson up with the CCTV footage, he found DI Lestrade already pouring over the film, a little notebook and pen in his lap, and Anthea still on the couch where he’d left her. John settled down next to her with Sherlock’s laptop. She was obviously aware of his proximity, and raised her eyebrows slightly, but John wasn’t interested in flirting. Instead, he asked her the question that had been bothering him since this whole affair started.
Just then, Lestrade caught up, closely flanked by his team. John indicated the cowering medical students (Sherlock had deduced days ago that it was medical students being used to perform the ersatz surgeries), and Lestrade took over covering them with his own gun while Sergeant Donovan handcuffed the three. She and Lestrade were speaking, but John couldn’t hear them. Emergency first, background noise later.
The detective was capable of picking any lock with his tools, and a fair few without them, but escaping handcuffs without the use of either of his hands was proving slightly more difficult.
For the second time in the space of an hour, John Watson found himself in a situation he wasn’t sure how he’d gotten in to. Before entering the room of Sherlock Holmes, John had been looking for ways to get out of Biopharm Limited’s facilities. Now, he was apparently employed there, as private physician serving the enigmatic patient.
Anthea was the first one to speak. “Violent crime has skyrocketed in the last ten minutes, reaching nearly ninety times average levels for a comparable timespan this year. It would seem that an anonymous member of an online forum offered a substantial reward to anyone apprehending a police officer.”
John was always talking to him, trying to reassure him that everything would be alright. But so long as he felt his John's pulse beneath his fingers, all the rest was obvious.
Anyway, at about noon, the caneless Dr. Watson would return to his and Sherlock’s room. The detective would almost certainly be awake by then, either typing madly on John’s laptop, playing away on his violin, or poking at some experiment he’d set up with bits and pieces absconded from the morgue. It would then be John’s job to force Sherlock to eat something, usually by means of refusing to let the subject drop until the other man moodily agreed to at least some mediocre toast or breakfast cereal. Getting Sherlock to take his meds went down the same way.
“Thank you,” John called as he jogged back down the hall to the elevator bank. He jammed the down button with his thumb, anxiety making his stomach crawl. But as the doctor stood there, he saw a sign by the lift door. It read: For The Safety of our Incubator Patients, Basement Lifts Do Not Operate from 8pm to 6am. With a groan, John located the door onto a nearby stairwell and ran down into the facility’s lowest level.
John was the only acceptable part of this equation. If Sherlock had to be completely helpless, he'd certainly have chosen no other companion. Not only was the doctor excellent at his craft (every medical action John had taken since Sherlock had become lucid enough to deduce them had been expertly performed), John knew Sherlock. The radio was an excellent idea, even if it's quality proved the device to be a gift from Mycroft. And the choice of a local news station rather than a more global one spared the detective the intricacies of politics in favor of personal interest stories that spoke far more about the state of his beloved London. Also, there was the challenge of solving reported crimes from others' observations alone (quite a challenge, as it seemed not one officer involved in any of the cases described possessed a working pair of eyes). All in all, the news station was the second best thing to John.
Umbrella Man gave an indulgent smile. “Whether or not we’re done here is entirely up to you, Dr. Watson.”
“I haven’t the faintest idea what you’re talking about,” Sherlock replied honestly, if with his usual derision.
At that moment, John was glad he was a doctor. Because the sight of someone one knew, someone one cared for laid open on an operating table, while never easy, would undoubtedly have caused someone in another profession to lose consciousness then and there.
Sherlock closed his eyes in the darkness. He’d have to get out of here soon. Hiding the movement under a hypoglycemic twitch, the consulting detective pinched his nails around the fabric at the seam of his straightjacket sleeve. Then, with uncharacteristic patience got to work shredding the restraint, one string at a time.
Just then, the gray strip of light under the door became blinding, and Sherlock was aware of footsteps coming down a concrete hallway. It was Moriarty of course—the man had a very distinctive walk, especially when as gleeful as he obviously was now—and the detective shut his eyes tight just in time for the door to swing open. It wouldn’t do to be blinded when the criminal came in.
Said detective gave an angry moan, and would probably have stayed where he was indefinitely if he hadn’t thought about what it would do to John to see him unmoving on the floor. So with his last vestige of patience, Sherlock wriggled and rolled his way back to the couch, ending by planting his face firmly on a seat cushion. Sitting on the cushion would be better for John’s peace of mind, but that was one step farther than Sherlock was capable of at the moment.
The consulting detective gave a mental start. Discrepancy. The human mind is designed to perceive changes in status quo, which meant that if Sherlock could keep moving, could keep the visible symptoms of low blood sugar at a constant, even his brilliant captor would begin to ignore them. Which might even be helpful, as false twitching could eventually be used to hide some of the more obvious motions of escaping a straightjacket. And he did have to escape it soon; the detective knew that his motor control was more likely to get worse than better, so his best chance at slipping the knots was now. Not that this was the time for all-out escape, no, not enough information for that yet. Still, escape was something better done sooner than later. Because Moriarty was wrong; John would never forget Sherlock. It just wasn’t in his nature. No, John would continue to torture himself for the rest of his life if Sherlock didn’t escape, and John didn’t deserve that. He wasn’t even a part of this game, and it wasn’t right that he suffer for it. But if his flatmate was never seen again, John would blame himself. Sherlock needed to get himself out of here, for John’s sake.
“Don’t hide the gun in your sock drawer, it’s cliché,” drawled the detective, still without leaving the couch.
John approached the door cautiously, better safe than sorry. He looked out the peep-hole and was met by the grinning face of none other than Jim Moriarty. And he was strapped to a bomb.
Several hours later, John tried with the tea again and Sherlock didn’t get tired until five swallows.
“Yes, except for that, but no one expects an IP to be entirely sane. They’re used to us acting oddly, so no one was all that surprised when I started using their facilities. And after the first week, they didn’t even bother trying to keep me out. Very useful, all that.”
“You escaped . . . for me?”  It wasn’t a question so much as a statement, but John still felt the need to express it aloud.
The doctor shook his head and took Sherlock’s pulse for the third time in the last minute. Although both Mycroft and Lestrade had taken precautions, John had taken up the mantle of Sherlock’s last line of defense. To that end, he had moved as many of the necessities of life as possible to the bedroom he now shared with Sherlock (so that he’d be present in case of an emergency), started keeping his gun within arm’s length at all times, and even, when he could think of no other measures to take, had closed all the curtains against hypothetical snipers. Perhaps it was paranoia, but this was Moriarty they were talking about.
A week had passed, and John’s life had fallen into a sort of pattern. With the drop in pain meds, Sherlock had become more aware if not more mobile. John no longer needed an EEG to determine if his detective was awake, he could see it in his face. Sherlock always seemed to be wearing some sort of facial expression while conscious, even if it was so faint that no one but John could have noticed.
John put his two arms around his detective. “You’ve got no idea how well you’ve been doing. Most people would’ve given up by now, or gone out of their heads entirely. But you’re still here, and you’re still you. Amazing.”
