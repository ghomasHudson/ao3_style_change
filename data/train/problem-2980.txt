Cas took a moment to gather his thoughts. Then, calmly, said “Growing up, I barely remember my father. I was looked after by Nannies. On occasion, I was allowed on excursions with my elder brothers. My father is Chief of a network of prominent hospitals and we were all expected to enter medicine or business, so I entered medicine. And then, one day while I was by a patient’s bed, a nurse looked at me and said ‘so, which one are you?’ and I had to get out. I had to go somewhere where no one knew my Father.  Where I could make it on my own merits. Where I could meet people who wouldn’t judge me because of where I came from. Even if they were people I loved, and still love, from there. And I met Dean. And you. And Jess.” He reached out and laid a hand between Sam’s shoulder blades. “I love your brother as much as Jess loved you, Sam. I’m sure of that. And if I passed, I’d want Dean to be cared for and safe and loved, just as I’m sure she’d want for you. And you want for her. Please, let us help you.”
Alan came forward and hooked an arm into Sam’s. “Don’t worry,” he said, smiling to the three of them, “I’ll escort him there if he’s ready. Sam?”
Sam said nothing. Dean tried a “Yo? Hello? Bad connection?” and finally said “sorry, but you’re gonna have to try back.”
Dean texted his brother saying, if he didn’t talk, he’d call Alan and Missouri. Sam arrived on their doorstep the next day.
“About friggin’ time someone helped out. Serving plates, Cas. Sammy, you have two seconds to get the milk out of the fridge for Cas’ coffee before we cut off your allowance.”
Cas stepped gingerly into the room, careful not to startle the younger Winchester. Sam looked at him and instantly lowered his gaze, pretending to adjust the sheet and rearrange Dean’s arm. Cas pulled a chair up beside Sam’s , set his own coffee at his feet, and held out the Gatorade and coffee to his friend.
“It will be,” Cas smiled. Dean grinned warmly back, casting a meaningful glance at Sam, who was still absorbed in the table-cloth.
. So quit trying. We’ve got each other. We lost sight of that for a bit, but it always comes back. We got a lot of shit to rock and a lot of years to do it.” He stroked gently over Sam’s hair, pulled him tighter, perching his chin over Sam’s head and rubbing a warm circle on his back. “I’m not gonna letcha go,” he murmured. “In fact—”
She had explained, quite patiently, that what he was doing was projecting all this self-hate and anxiety and terror at this new acceptance of his substance abuse on those around him. And that it wasn’t a bad or evil thing: he wanted to be reassured. She would reassure him.
He felt a spike of rage at his absent brother. If it weren’t for Dean, he wouldn’t be in this mess to begin with. Dean didn’t get it—Sam had stayed quiet when his brother drank too much. Sam had stayed quiet when Dad had beat his big brother, because Dean demanded it. He had tried to accept the thugs Dean slept with and the loud, obnoxious, overpainted women he’d bring home. But Dean couldn’t allow Sam to have any of his own relief. Cas had said it best:
Cas stripped off his coat and used it to cover Sam's trembling shoulders. Dean held his brother tighter, continuing to smooth his hair, speak soft reassurances, while Cas took it upon himself to speak with the fire and police departments.
“No, we should see the movie. I know you’ve wanted to.” Dean knew his brother’s truce flags when he waved them.
, and he wasn’t saving Sammy and he wasn’t there for Cas and everything felt like it was spinning out of control in a way it hadn’t in years.
“I know a few of yours,” Dean murmured, and ducked out of Cas’ vision to scrape his teeth along the side of his throat, causing Cas to let out his usual mortifying, girliegiggle. “And because of your labcoat, I never have to worry about hickies.”
She gave Cas a wink as she strode out of the room. Dean crossed his arms and smacked Sam’s hand aside when his brother reached out to pat him.
“No!” Even Dean didn’t believe that one. “No. I mean...yeah. But I’ve heard the spiels. I know I can’t.”
“You gonna stand on ceremony? Or you gonna come in and get on your knees and beg my forgiveness?” Dean teased. Bobby flinched slightly, and Ellen glanced at her husband before turning back to Dean.
“Dean,” Cas forced his voice to be calm and moved to pin Dean’s other shoulder to the stretcher and take his boyfriend’s hand, only to narrowly avoid a punch to the face.
Cas’ jealousy gave way to grief. It brought an ache to his chest to think of his partner conditioned to respond to touch as a means of defense. And he felt another spike of resentment toward the younger Winchester, who’d he’d seen take Dean’s gentle ministrations as a given.
Dean acted just as Sam expected: he yelled so loud Sam could hear him from the other side of the desk.
Dean shook his head. His own pile for Sam had originally been in a laundry basket, that turned into two, and now was a heaping stack running up the side of the wall. “I think I may be spoiling the dumb kid,” he admitted.
rang out of Ash’s hip. Ash flashed him the “one minute” finger and answered. “Talk to me. Dr. Al! yeah, I’m home, I’m—” his face dropped. “Oh, shit. Where—” he looked at Sam and carefully composed himself. “Okay. Sure. Yeah, yeah I’ll tell them. Thanks for the call, doc. Keep me posted.” He hit end.
Dean put an arm around his shoulders and pulled him close. “C’mon, bud,” he murmured. “Let’s go home.”
what he repaired—things like cell phones, e-mail attachments, copy machines, and digital cable were utterly beyond him. Sure, he could take apart the remote and replace a broken circuit with a paperclip, but he couldn’t use the search menu to find COPS.
“You won’t be alone, Dean. Sam and I will do it with you. Missouri will help us all learn what we need to do to cope.”
“Hey, um...before you go...” Cas smiled to himself, glancing at the sleeping Sam and unconscious Dean, “I do have an idea.”
Cas has a double scheduled the next day. It’s not until he’s well into the second shift that Balthazar approaches, looking surprisingly serious, and begs for a word. Cas circles back to him an hour later and Peter tells him that Fitzgerald McCloud of the Pub was found early this morning in an alley, beaten close to death, with packets full of heroin and cocaine stuffed in his pockets. When he recovered, he’d be looking at charges of possession, dealing, trafficking, potential money-laundering, and there were other whispers, about drugging minors, about prostitution, about tax evasion, and Peter just doesn’t understand, doesn’t understand, doesn’t understand.
"They said it started in the ceiling,” Sam said, still frightenly detached. “An electrical shortage. It took out our whole room. They said she probably never woke up. Would of gotten me if I'd been there. I should of been there."
“How—much?” If he took a hit, his energy would increase. The high would override the sickness. He’d be able to think, focus, figure out his next move. Get up out of the goddamn
“Whatever. Hold on. I’m supposed to conference in Cas.” Dean promptly hung up on him. Sam clicked “end,” chuckling to himself. Dean was no idiot. Sam had known his brother was amazingly gifted ever since he was six and his Game Boy died. Dean had taken the machine down to pieces and used a sewing needle to rewire parts of it. Since then, Sam had seen him work magic on electrical sockets, televisions, pipes, fans, heaters, air conditioners, and of course, everything and anything the automotive industry produced. One of his fondest memories of Dean was his brother breaking into a neighbor’s and returning home with their fax machine while Sam raced to meet his college application deadlines and their computer froze. Dean deconstructed the fax machine, opened up the belly of the PC, and the next thing Sam knew, his applications were merrily printing away to the song of the fax. Dean even returned the machine to its rightful place before dawn.
For the first time since he’d started using, Sam felt a slow, cold coil of fear when he realized he was thinking
Gabe leaned back into his chair and slapped the computer shut. “Cas...I heard what you said. And let’s get this straight—you leave Dean, my guest room is your room. You go back? Call me when you land. You name it, you go it. I will always have your back. But...I like those guys. And, more importantly, you
“Sam,” Dean grumbled. Cas looked a little worriedly at the younger Winchester, and then back to Missouri, who rolled her eyes and gave him an affectionate wink. Cas smiled at Sam as he followed Dean out the door.
Sam clenched his hands against his fists. He’d had this argument before. He didn’t want to have it again. “I’m sorry,” he managed.
“And that was melodramatic as hell, but I’m gonna let it go and get the check and get us out of here.” He flagged down their waiter, dropped his card on the plate, and kicked Cas’s shin under the table. “C’mon, bucko. Drop the sour face. I got your back. Whatever it is, we’ll work it out.”
“Christ, Cas,” Dean whispered across Sam’s dark head. “I was seriously wondering if I’d have to hit him or something.”
Crowley’s knee landed on the back of his neck and shoved, hard. “Shut it, you filthy maggot,” he hissed. Sam kicked and clawed and finally got a well-placed elbow in and managed to roll on his back. Crowley launched forward, syringe in hand. Sam didn’t know what was in it, but he knew if he stuck it into him, he’d be helpless.
And then she did something she’d never done before—she reached across the space between them and took his hand in hers.
! C’mon, keep with me. You’re at the apartment?” he listened again. “Alright,” he said, softening his voice, reaching for his discarded clothes. “Alright, kiddo, I’m on my way. I’m gonna be there before you know it. You don’t have to answer anything until then, alright? Sammy?” he paused again, then dropped his voice once more. “I know, little brother.  Just hang on a little longer. I’m on my way.”
Dean huffed against him. “You ever think about me in all this? Where I would be if it weren’t for my pain-in-the-ass little brother?”
“He took it upon himself to play that man’s judge and jury. After everything we’ve been through with Sam, trying to forge, as you say, a gray area of morality, he attacked that man like he was the blackest evil.”
Cas had crawled into bed around one in the morning and fitted himself close to Dean. Dean had woken up enough to shoot a “C ssfe” text to Sam before dropping back into oblivion. He woke warm and rested,
“It’s just easier to take it sometimes. It’s not personal.” Cas’s voice softened. “I know that Dean would never hurt me, Sam. Not like your father, or Gordon, would hurt him. Sometimes, people get angry when they’re scared. I deal with that a lot. I don’t mind dealing with it from Dean. We both know he wants nothing but the best for those he loves.”
“Like I said, I’ll evaluate. His life is more important than his leg, Cas. I won’t let him lose that.” She laid a warm hand on his shoulder.
He knew he’d loved her—he loved her still. And given what he’d seen of the marriages around him, he’d assumed that a polite, presentable, friendly match was what was expected. Neither of them were particularly sentimental, or overtly romantic, and they were both in demanding career tracks that would leave them tired and needing a friendly, non-judgmental, companion.
Sam grinned again. “Cas is going to pick me up from work and drive me to yours. Andy’s got the green light and will be at dinner on time.”
“It’s okay,” he said, tossing Sam a wink before handing the glass back. “Find me a box wrench, would you?”
Sam nodded and straightened his shoulders. Because yes, he was still shaking, and thin, and pale. And yes, he was barely recovered, and cripplingly depressed and anxious, and deeply terrified of the future.
And suddenly, Sam was in the bottom of the tub, chest heaving, tears streaming, gulping down air and shower water and buds of soap. He didn’t belong here and he didn’t have a home to go back to and Dean was walking out the door, walking away from Sam, and it was just like when they were kids and Sam had to stay upstairs while their Dad raged and think
“I felt...after you and Dean stopped drinking, that it was wrong to keep that photo in the house,” Cas said slowly. “But I really do love it. I don’t have many photos of my own family, and—”
Cas had seen these things from Dean before, but never on such a long-term scale, and it made his chest fill with affection and adoration and something else: determination.
“Really. You just pitched a hissy-fit because Sam knew more about Dean in a severe state of physical and mental distress than you.”
Cas held him while Sam cried himself through the show. He held him when he drifted off to sleep, sneezed into his shirt, mumbled an apology, and fell back asleep. He held him through the two hours of Nazi marches, and three more about coal mines. He held him as the beautiful afternoon—his only one off—faded away into evening, and then night, and then Dean came home, took one look at that them both, kissed Cas’ cheek in thanks, and half carried, half marched, his brother up the stairs to the guestroom bed.
“Haggling. My Dad and I watch this show on the History Channel, with these guys in a pawn shop, where—”
“Damnit, Sammy—” Dean’s voice hitched, and he looked at Cas, seeming to draw strength. “You can always come to us, always. Our home is your home and you can always go there. That’s what we’re gonna do now. We’re gonna take you home and take care of you. Me and Cas. We’ll do all you need. Hear me?” He shook him, gently. “Sammy?”
“Your father is the chief of the largest health network in the nation, and they’re expanding. Saw him ghosting around the bottom of the Forbes 500 last month. And yet, here you are, out in the middle of nowhere, moonlighting under another over-privileged fake red-head capitalizing on her former professors' questionable admiration. So, may I ask why?”
“Brat,” he mumbled, smiling. Sam curled against his brother’s leg and hip and closed his eyes, letting him pet his head. Dean had tried so hard to chase out the bad memories in this room, tried to paint over and recover and rearrange the nights of being here after Jess, and after Dad, and during times when he was using and hung over and feverish and so depressed he thought he’d die. Dean’s whole life was trying to clear the path of monsters so Sam could walk along after him in comfort and safety. And Sam wanted to tell him he loved him,
Dean launched himself forward and slammed the smaller man into the wall, elbow pressed against his throat.
For a moment, Cas had hated Anna. He should have assumed being faced with drinking would overwhelm his partner. And then, Dean had said:
“I’ve never done ‘rest’ well.” She managed a small smile. “It’s...good to have you back. As I said. You were missed.”
“I know.” He covered Cas’s hand with his own and sighed into the pillow. “Thank you. For taking such good care of Sam.”
“Good news boys—Mr. Gallagher aced his surgery. He won’t be going swimming anytime soon, but he should recover his full range of motion. He’s up in the ICU—”
Dean smiled in that warm, wonderful way that always bolstered Sam, and Cas beamed when it was turned on him.
Sam and Andy arrived through the main door. Sam beamed at his brother and crossed the room in those big, loping, giant strides of his. Andy smiled and waved as he approached the table.
. Me? He gave me a chance. To build a life of my own. To build trust among those who mattered. To have a bank account full of money and a home with heat and hot water. And you and that dumbass brother of yours decided it wasn’t good enough.”
It was just him and Dean, safe and in love in the dark. Curling up close and drifting to sleep, more relaxed than either had been in days.
will get through this. You’re gonna beat this thing, I know it. If you can’t have faith in you, have faith in me. Brother knows best , huh?”
, as you called him, was the only person who understood. Who came to sit in on groups and attend my family therapy sessions. Who brought me what I
“I know,” he said. “I was awful at first. But it wasn’t because you were a man. I just...Dean’s...” he took a deep breath, “he’s given me
Dean let loose a stream of filth that seemed to surprise even Sam, who blushed and covered his mouth with his hand to hide his laughter. Cas handed his own coffee and sipped his own, also slipping Sam his morning medication, which got him a thankful look from Dean.
“I can’t say I’m thrilled you jumped at an unhinged murderer. Though I can’t say I’m not proud you brought him down on his ass anyway.”
“I would never lie to you,” Cas soothed. “Never. Especially not about anything as important as this. Dean is
“I was wrong,” John said. “I thought he was leaving us. And I wasn’t thinking clearly. My disease clouded my judgment.”
One look at Gordon’s dark eyes, one whiff of that aftershave, and Dean could feel that dark heat stir in him once more. If Jess had been hovering nearby earlier, she was damn near
It made Sam sad just to think of. Dean had never left Sam wanting for affection. His brother wasn’t a cuddler or hugger or one to say “I love you,” but he never denied his brother when Sam felt compelled to grab on to him, and, when he really needed it, Dean was always willing to drop his own inhibitions and hold him, or ruffle his hair, or let Sam lean on his shoulder. He’d always made it clear that Sam’s job was to be Sam, and Dean’s job was to protect that Sam.
“Did I ever tell you about the time I landed on a tuna can lid, pulled it out myself, and then took stitches from a Priest with nothing but an old Percocet?”
Cas could swear his heart almost shattered. He took a deep breath, stood, walked to the other side of the bed, and lay down behind him, smoothing his hair as he'd seen Dean do. It was more than a little awkward: even in his bony, fragile state, Sam was still a much larger man than Cas, and Cas had never...well...
“Your temp’s up a bit, but it’s no big deal. I’m gonna put this on your head to help.” He dabbed at his brother’s forehead, then gently laid out the cloth. Dean frowned and grunted, and his eyelashes fluttered before his eyes slid open, slightly. Sam smiled. “Hey, don’t worry. You did good. We’re fine now. I can stay, no problem. We’re covered.” Dean’s eyes dropped closed once more, and a few minutes later he was sleeping peacefully. Cas felt a savage stab of jealousy, pushed it aside.
Cas was about to retaliate when a loud English bark called across the room, and he saw the tall, lean form of his co-worker, Peter Balthazar, bounding toward him, drink in hand.
“Why didn’t you tell me on your own?” Dean snapped, voice suddenly heart-broken. “Why didn’t you just...come
Sam came rushing back, spoon in hand, and scooped a single cube onto it. Dean rolled his eyes, grabbed the cup, and dumped a dose into his mouth, just as he’d done for Cas.
“Expecting company?” Gordon asked, cocking an eyebrow as he gazed into the cart. Gordon thought Christmas was stupid. Nothing but a few extra days to get drunk.
Andy came bounding up the front walkway, van still puffing out exhaust. “Hey!” he called, hopping in. “Hi Cas, Dean!”
“Get the lead out!” Bobby barked. Dean glared at everyone but Sam, who he tossed a quick smile and wink toward, before trailing after the elder man. Ellen smiled and smoothed Sam’s hair off his forehead.
Gabriel was standing at the airport in a gray chauffer’s uniform with a gray chauffer’s hat—an outfit clearly borrowed from their parents’ driver—and a giant sign saying “Welcome Back Cassie!” in hot pink font, with several pink hearts and a poor rendering of a butterfly. Cas felt himself relaxing, a smile already widening in his face, as he approached his older brother.
He stood beside Alan, trying as hard as he could to channel all of the Old Sam he knew how, into his features then. Tried his best to smile, to straighten up, to lean a little less on Alan and a little more toward Dean when he and Cas came through the doors.
“What if he tells and you go to jail?” Dean’s eyes cut sharply toward Missouri, who had resumed her seat, arms crossed over her large chest. She raised a cool eyebrow toward him.
“He said...imagine going up against two our Dads, completely alone.” He swallowed, feeling his throat swell, a shudder claim him. Dean gave him a light squeeze. “If it weren’t for you...maybe I would have been like that. Maybe I would have killed Dad. I wanted to. I came close once or twice, when he was hitting you. If it weren’t for you...I never  would have recovered, or
Cas listened stoically, finally saying “long ago, you told me Sam needed us to be calm for him, Dean—please be so now.”
And just like that, Cas had felt dread settle in his stomach. He’d hoped Dean was like him: on his own, fleeing a family that had brought nothing but hurt. Realizing there was still a Winchester unit meant the possibility of rejection, and rejection of a brother he spoke of this fondly could very well mean rejection from Dean.
But most of the time, Dean didn’t question. It was damn convenient, in his opinion, not to feel the weight of a situation in the moment. When everyone else was attended to, that’s when he allowed himself his own breakdowns. Throughout Dean’s life, having the
“Well...she’s gonna be a bitch,” Dean huffed, straightening his jacket and stomping petulantly down the hall. Cas fell into step dutifully beside him, still cherishing the sight of Sam’s smile, and thinking, maybe, she was going to be just what they needed.
Sam turned, eyes filled. “I believed in God, Cas,” he whispered, almost as if it’s a terrible secret, “I thought God gave me Jess. Why would He take her away?”
Sam smiled back. Alan had told him, quite calmly, that no physician chose this life without losing someone they loved down the path he’d taken. He’d never defined who, but he’d made it all too clear that he believed in recovery, and believed he could aid in it, and Sam trusted him.
Sam could raise a great fuss when he wanted. But he could also be a great wingman—and kid brother—when duty called.
Cas stopped breathing for a second. Dean’s jaw was set, face cool and calm and betraying no emotion, though he knew that he’d loved Sam’s girlfriend like a sister. “She didn’t make it out?” he managed dumbly.
Jake drifted off, and Cas turned back to the waiting area: and felt a sudden slam of loss. He had no idea what to do now: Sam was being fetched, Anna had told him to steer clear, he couldn’t
“That’s fine.” Everyone liked Andy’s Dad, the same way everyone liked Andy. He was laid back, friendly, and was, despite his carefree exterior, deeply devoted to those he cared about. “You’re such a Jewish mother at heart, you know that?”
He could do this. He could lie down and relax and not think about Ruby. Or relapse. Or Crowley. Or Jess and Dad and Maddy and Cas and Dean and Cas and Dean and Cas and DeanDeanDeanDean...
“This is Doctor Cas Morgan.” She reached for the phone. “I’m very sorry, Mr. Uriel. This will have to be continued later.”
“Is your eye bothering you? You can’t tell there’s anything wrong. It might...be a little bruised tomorrow, but it’ll clear up.”
It seemed the whole restaurant not only knew Gabriel, but wanted to hug or kiss or grab him. He greeted everyone with identical enthusiasm: hugging, kissing, thumping away on shoulders and backs, and half throwing Cas into everyone with equal delight. As a teenager, Gabe’s overzealous behavior had irritated him endlessly, but as an adult, he’d grown a bit jealous of it: his brother’s delight and enthusiasm for people was genuine, and infectious, just as his obvious pride to have Cas back by his side.
Cas could understand how John Winchester, even at his best, felt parenting these two would be a spectacular effort.
“Don’t worry,” he said quickly, “I’ll get him home and stay with him until I’m sure he’s alright. I’m sure he’s just...he just gets nervous, sometimes.”
“Why did you feel that?” Missouri asked. Sam rubbed his hands on his sweats and didn’t answer. “It’s alright, Sam,” she softened her voice. “It will help Dean understand if you tell him.”
Dean nodded. Sam whimpered once more. Cas cast a sad look at him, patted Dean’s shoulder and stood. Dean reached out, dropped a hand to his brother’s shaggy head, and stroked his hair until he quieted.
Sam opens his eyes. He’s on the pull-out couch at Dean’s and Cas’, the streetlights coming through the front windows. Dean’s beside him, rubbing his head, a broad hand on his chest, anchoring him in place.
“Ash, get something to tie Max’s hands with,” Sam snapped. He placed the gun on the counter, belatedly wishing he hadn’t gotten his fingerprints on it, and found some clean dish towels to bring to Andy.
“Dr. Morgan,” a friendly voice said. Cas jumped and spun around to see Anna, holding a cup of soup in one hand and a sandwich in the other, standing behind him in the hospital’s cafeteria. “Everything alright?”
“Christ, Cas. I hear all the doctor’s spiels on chemicals and bio-chemicals and psychotropic meds and psychology—but dealing with Sammy like this—” his voice hitched.
“No worries. I took the liberty to alert the fabulous red-head who oversees this place, and she asked me to pass on that she will personally pay him some visitation, since she clearly has a thing for your boy-toy,” Balthazar joked.
“Because when you were fifteen, you dragged me into a stranger’s car and hotwired it and drove me to the ER. Because when you were twelve you sat guarding the foot of my bed with a baseball bat while taking care of my concussed ass. Because after Dad smashed your skull to pieces, you were dialing around trying to find me bits for the car. Because
Dean shook his head. “Asshole,” he mumbled, even as his hand moved through Sam’s hair and smoothed gently. Sam smiled.
Dean wasn’t one to call for comfort, reassurance, and devotion. But Sam was going to give and get that for him too, or be damned to the bowels of hell trying.
Sam whimpered beside him. The room was spinning. Cas sat beside him and pulled him close, guiding his head to his own shoulder the way Dean did for Sammy.
By the time they made it inside, all Cas wanted to do was sit on the couch and have some slight amount of quiet. Or, at least, mindless chatter.
“I know you do. That’s not gonna get you out of eating that soup. Or hearing this story. Guess who came into the garage today?”
“Sammy, I need you to shut your mouth. Cas isn’t us, alright? He came out of his Ivory Tower to slum and whether he likes what we are or not is up to him.”
,” his friend sighed. “Listen. Just...take a few deep breaths, go grab some coffee, grab whatever it is that unfortunate sober-soul drinks, and go sit by your man. He’ll want you both there. And he’ll want
"He's forgiven you, Sam," he says gently. "He only wants you to be well, you know that. No one is more important to him than you."
Cas hated having to wake them. Hated even more, that when he did, Sam’s eyes slid open, and he stared at Cas with devastation and confusion and betrayal, before burrowing closer to his sleeping older brother and closing them tight, wincing, as if hoping to force himself back into sleep, into the safety of Dean’s presence.
His friend was quiet for a moment. “Sam...I can’t say I know how you feel. But...although it seems very, very difficult, if you force yourself to do things, you will begin to feel better. It will take time, but you will. Even in the hospital, when people have had surgery, we force them to walk a bit, or go outside if they’re able, each day. It’s small, but it helps them to know they’ve done more than rest, although rest is important.”
Dean hushed him and spends another minute petting his head. Then he takes his brother's face in his hands, pries him away, and briefly pulls their foreheads together. "I'll be back first thing tomorrow. Okay? You get some sleep."  Sam nods, clutching Dean's wrists. Dean gently pulls himself away. "Lie down," he soothes, and guides his brother onto the pillows, tucking him in under his new blanket, murmuring nonsense Cas can't understand. He smoothes Sam's hair, smiles and pats him reassuringly. "First thing tomorrow, babe. Okay?"
“I’m glad. You were missed.” Anna made a few notes on a clipboard and handed it over to the on duty nurse with warm thanks. “So. Everything alright?”
And, in the best moments, he was able to remember Dean’s promise: that as long as he fought, Dean would fight with him. The thought of being taken back, of possibly being redeemed, of being by his brother’s side, a team once more, renewed his determination not to give in.
"I can't," Sam sobbed. "I—I can't, Dean, I can't do it. I only ever feel okay when I'm here with you two, and even then I—get—"
Cas turned back to his brother. Gabe was drinking some sort of high-priced microwbrew, and grinned when the mustache left a foam.
“You shouldn’t touch him when he’s like that,” Sam explained, authoritative and calm. “He comes out fighting if you do.”
“Thanks.” Dean’s eyes softened. “Thank you, Cas. Just...hang tight. I’m not checking out on you yet.”
“Nope. But you’re still gonna humor me and let me escort you to the dance floor, huh?”  He helped him to his feet. “Just until I’m sure you can do the whole two legs thing without dropping.”
“He hates when I degrade women,” Peter cut him off, winking.  “And this here is Dean, the man Cas left his millions for. Dean, Cas, meet Fergie.”
“How generous,” Cas said sarcastically, but he smiled. Sam looked at him, to his brother, and then back at the floor.
Sam felt his face go very, very hot. “Everyone’s been pushing me to talk about things I just...can’t.”
The rest of that sentiment resounded, clearly, between them: he doesn’t view me as perfect anymore. He doesn’t view me as the fixer of all.
“It’s awesome. And it’s some sort of micro-green-hippie developed technology, or no birds or Chinese died in making it.”
“Right. And you won’t talk about those weeks on the street.” Sam shrugged. Missouri sighed. “And avoiding groups is going to make that go away?”
Dean had promised that while Sam had lain on the kitchen floor, blood pooling under his head. He’d sworn he’d be there every painful step. And he
“—no matter how much he didn’t want to, I think he tried, Dean, when I look back, he did try, he stayed sober, or he didn’t come home if he’d had too much or he locked himself in his room and—and—what if I can’t—”
"It's too much—like before. Like—Dad and—" a soft sob drifts up out of the dark. "I just...when I thought...I just...stopped. I couldn't—if it had, I wouldn't—I'd have made sure I
“You know...” Sam said softly, “Me and Dean...we always had a few people we could go to. Jim the Priest, and later Bobby and Ellen, and a teacher here and there. But you...you were the first to not tell us we were all wrong and messed up. You just...took us as we were. And I...I’d never want to...break that, Cas. You don’t just mean a lot to Dean.”
“Was nothing, you hear me? I had fun. I didn’t think about Cas. Don’t thank me.” Dean dropped his voice. “Don’t, bro. Don’t thank me for being around.” Sam’s throat was too swollen to speak after that. “It’s almost ten, bud. You need to hit the hay. Pop your glory pills and dream of the girl with kaleidoscope eyes.”
When they got up to clear the dishes, Sam barely noticed until Dean’s hands landed, broad and warm, on his shoulders. He started, reached to clear his bowl, and found Cas already there. He wanted to speak, to thank him, to explain, and was embarrassed by the strange, weak sound coming from his throat. Dean leaned close murmured, “It’s alright, Sammy. You don’t have to talk. Just take your time. Relax. You’re home.”
“Black. And Fruit Punch,” he managed. Sam looked at him warily. “I wasn’t sure which one you wanted.”
“I’m sorry,” he murmured. “I let my own insecurities get the better of me. I have to admit, I’m...unsettled.”
Andy looked, for once, less than confident and optimistic. He was flushed and shy and suddenly vulnerable, and hadn’t Sam given up his damn pride ages ago? He could do this. For his friend.
me? You won’t make me change, no matter what you did, or thought you had to. It’s gone, it’s done. It’s
“Sure. And Cas is the perfect heating pad. I get it. I know what it’s like on those cold winter nights—”
recover. And you saved two friends today, two good men who didn’t deserve to die because his childhood sucked.” Dean’s hand wound into his  hair and stroked gently, just like when he was a kid.
Cas wasn’t sure how long he stood there, staring dumbly over the waiting room, playing different scenarios in his mind and how he’d support Sam in each of them. All he knew was he was standing there, a pillar of calm one moment, and, in the next, heard the tell-tale ringing of “Cas?”
But he’d go to hell before he’d let her hurt Dean. Even if it meant publically announcing his degradation at the hands of Crowley. He’d live the humiliation. He would
In the meantime, Cas pleaded with Anna and Peter, and together the pair graciously accommodated all his shift requests so he was off work the same time as Dean. When they weren’t working on home improvement projects, he took Dean to the movies, or to diners, or for dinner, or even just sat by his side while Dean drove out of the city and let the Impala guide them up and down roads they'd never explored.
“Oh—sorry. Andy.” He stuck out a hand. Dean looked from Sam, to Cas, and back again before taking it.
It wasn’t until Dean opened his arms to him and held him tight that he realized he’d gone so far that not even his brother’s love could cure it. That he had a seemingly endless amount of work to do, and most of it, like it or not, would have to be on his own.
But that’s what Cas did—that’s what Dean did. Looked after him without a thought for themselves. Gave and gave and gave no matter what insanity Sam laid at their feet.
sick, and we’re tryin’ to get you better. And so far, all you’ve done is crash in our beds like this a Motel 6 and you’re sleeping off a bender.”
But there was one thing he was awesome at, and that was being Sam’s big brother. When the world broke down on him, that was what he’d clung to—it was
“My brother’s fighting the side-effects of withdrawal, and you come in here talking about getting high and doing coke. Let’s say I’m not thinking we’re going to be friends,” Dean snapped.
Cas reached nervously over and lay his fingers on Dean’s thigh. When he didn’t pull away, he chanced resting his whole palm. “I’ve been pulled so deep into work I’ve lost sight of myself many times. I realized...with Gabe, as close as we can be...without you and Sam, a large part of myself ceases to exist. I become something of an...automatan.”
“Tomorrow,” Cas said gently, “we’ll go over together, and talk things through. I’m sure there’s a simple explanation.”
They were referencing what Cas referred to as “the unfortunate weekend.” Also known as, the weekend he and Sam managed to catch the same stomach bug at the same time. Jess had been visiting her parents, and Sam had been staying with them, and within hours of one another, Sam was sprawled on the sofabed puking into the downstairs toilet while Cas commandeered the upstairs one. Dean had spent two sleepless days and nights running from upstairs to down with water and saltines and oatmeal, thermometers and wet washcloths and Pepto Bismol, trying to hold
Cas was stunned by his boyfriend's response: he kicked off his boots, yanked back the covers, and stretched himself out alongside his brother. Sam nestled his head under his chin and began to cry, weak, exhausted tears. Dean just hushed him and stroked his hair.
For a few seconds, Cas thought it really would be nothing. But then Dean shot up like a jack-in-the-box, flipped on his light, and swung his legs over the side of the bed.
“Call back Collect. Don’t worry about the money. Don’t worry about anything, kiddo, just tell me where I can see you. We can fix it, Sam, I can help you, take care of you. Sammy, please—”
“Raised you, took care of you, been your best friend forever. I know, Sam. We’ll talk tomorrow, alright? I love you, I do. But I can’t look at you right now.”
“Are you out of your mind?” Dean’s voice was rising slightly. “We’re going to tell the cops that a former drug addict claims he was assaulted while prostituting himself to a dealer?”
“Alright,” Dean murmured, even as his shoe met Cas’s shin and he mouthed ‘shock’ over his brother’s shoulder. Cas gently touched Sam's forehead, than felt his pulse. It was all too clear Dean’s diagnosis was right.
“Doctor?” a woman asked, approaching the three of them. She had a young boy by the hand, whose arm was in a bright green cast. “Thank you for everything.”
“I started at the bar. Said he dropped his phone and I wanted to give it back. They’d seen us sitting there. Sonofabitch had his card on file, so after I got a few beers into Carly the bartender, she conveniently ‘forgot’ I had the phone and gave me his cell. I got the GPS activated and caught the sonofabitch getting blown by some fifteen year old in an alley.”
But he’d dreaded meeting Sam. And no amount of Dean’s reassurance was going to ease that dread. Right off the bat, it was clear that Dean’s relationship with his brother was nothing like Cas’s with his: nearly every story had a ‘Sammy said this,’ or ‘Sammy said that,’ or ‘Sam’s gonna freak,’ or ‘remind me to text Sam after this.’
in Dean’s nature to give Sam what he needed, and if what he needed was to snuggle against his big brother, than Dean would give him that.
Dean and Cas left the banter and made it the rest of the way down the hall. Sam’s room had a number outside, as well as a handwritten placard that said “Welcome, Sam!” And had been signed by seemingly everyone on the floor. This floor was strictly male: the women were housed one floor up, and visitation was forbidden between the floors. Groups that mingled the sexes were held on the third floor, where the offices of the therapists and doctors were located, and attempting to engage in a romantic or sexual actively qualified the participants for expulsion. This was a place for help and healing, the literature explained, not a place for Adam the cocaine fiend met Eve the crackwhore.
“I’m fine,” Sam insisted, the fourteen billion times Dean asked. “I’m sorry. I just had a hard time with someone new.”
The screen door swung open and Ash sauntered out. “Thought I smelled angst in these parts,” he said, and swung himself up on the porch railing, lighting a cigarette. “You’ve been quiet in group. You good, bro?”
“God,” he mumbled, chomping away. “Feel like...drank a...tank of whiskey...and...decided to...fight.”
“I was just...saying,” Sam mumbled, turning away and swirling his remaining beer. Cas took another sip of his “lesbian” drink, as Dean called it, and steeled himself.
Yes, McCloud, or ‘Crowley,’ as Sam referred to him, had been dangerous. Yes, he’d threatened Sam. But Sam was far from innocent. He’d put himself in that position in the first place.  He’d taken the man’s ‘help’—aka, drugs—in exchange for his...favors.
“Shit...” Andy flinched and swallowed, hard. “My Dad...can you call my Dad? I don’t want the cops to. He’ll shit himself.”
Sam checked his phone. It appeared, from his lack of texts and calls, that Cas didn’t really care either.
Sam was quiet for a bit, watching the Gremlins laughing at the movie screen. When the fire started, Dean quickly switched over to the news. “I get it,” Sam murmured. “If it was you living in a house where that had happened, I don’t think I’d be cheering it on either.”
Dean glanced at the caller ID when his phone buzzed and smiled. So what if it was girly that he grinned every time ‘Sam’ showed up: It wasn’t
“Dude,” Dean sighed between bites, “if it were between saving the lives of you and Sam or the chefs of this burger? I’d so save the chefs of this burger.”
Sam realized he was: his heart was beating normally, his palms had stopped sweating, and the evil voice in his head had stopped chanting. “Yes. Thank you.”
, thank you—and heading out to the porch. “Thought it was Bedtime for Bonzo, buddy. What’s going on?”
come home. I’m not giving you up, you understand me?” He softened, wiped tears with his thumbs like he must have when Sam was young, too young to remember. “We’ve been through some crazy, heavy shit these past twenty-five years. And I’m up for twenty-five more. But only if you’re sticking them out with me. Huh?”
“Trust me. I play Mario Kart like, twice a week with this guy from the Bronx. Flood. You got to meet him.”
Sam glanced at Dean, who was grinning like the Cheshire cat. “America’s finest medical professionals. Sleep-prescribing.”
His big brother, at least, didn’t have to put up women. Meaning he had a fifty-fifty shot at winning any argument. That was one less thing Sam had to worry about.
And if that hurt way, way more than he wanted it to, he couldn't imagine how torn Dean and Cas were feeling, no matter how well they hid it.
He loved it. He wanted more of it. He wanted him to feel every bit of what Sam had: right down to the moment he collapsed in a sweaty, snotty, sobbing mess of withdrawal.
“I’m too cold. It hurts. It—I—I didn’t know if you were alright. I didn’t know if I’d ever see you again.”
“If you change your mind, we’ll be right down the hall. I’m a light sleeper, as your brother demonstrated.” Cas kept all the meds he stashed for Sam double-locked, so the younger Winchester never had to deal with the temptation to abuse them.
“I’ve driven this with my eyes half-closed.” He swept them around a semi-truck, flipping the driver off when he honked.
“Whatever gets you through, right?” Andy grinned and pulled the stick out his mouth, pretending to blow. “Just like old times.”
“I’m going home. I need to sleep. Well, first I need to drink, and then I’m going to sleep. Do me a favor? Don’t match our schedules for awhile.”
He couldn’t remember what it felt like not to ache, not to shake, not to feel weak and cold and sick. The twelve days in lockdown had felt like years—years of muscle spasms and vomiting and uncontrollable sneezing, the feeling of his skin being on fire one moment and ice-cold the next, the damn
He crept silently away from their door and perched on the edge of his bed. Waiting for Dean. Waiting for Sam to confide in Dean. Waiting for a revelation, a pronouncement of truth, that the Winchesters were the first to provide in his stupid, over- privileged, little life.
“Friggin’ jerk,” he heard him mumble, but Dean could hear his smile. He sighed as he closed his phone. It made no sense to him why
Dean had stopped teasing him when he’d gone into treatment: even if Sam’s clinginess made him squirm at times, or even feel a rise of frustration, irritation,
“What, this is our fault? What the hell are we supposed to do when he’s locked up like this is Goddamn Alcatraz and he’s friggin’ Al Calpone!”
“I just saw that he loved drinking and yelling and hitting more than he loved us. But that wasn’t it. He was sad and lonely and scared out of his mind, trying to raise two kids on his own, and when he drank he felt strong and right and sure of himself. And things didn’t hurt as bad. I didn’t get it, but I get it now. How sometimes you’ll think you’ll
“She’s in the hospital. I—Dean, she told he me she was still using. She told me. And I...I didn’t...I didn’t do anything about it.”
“In the back of the dumbass redneck’s van getting driven at about a hundred-miles an hour to the ER.”
“Take some time. But everyone swears I’ll be up and running this time next year.” Dean offered one of his smaller, warmer smiles. Bobby continued to shove his fists around and pretend to be interested in the framed, generic flower prints on the walls.
Sam felt a sudden swell of grief. If he’d finished school, he could have bought this on his own. He could have his own credit card. He wouldn’t have been this—
He wasn’t sure where he was when he stopped. His heart was racing, he had sweat working down his face, and his stomach was starting to cramp. He felt almost savagely dizzy, and unnaturally hot, and he stumbled back and forth across the street, pausing only to vomit. Out of the corner of his vision, he saw people jerking away from him, jerking their
When Cas unlocked the front door early the next morning, he found that the sofabed had been pulled out. Dean sat on the end closest to the door, flipping through the almost silent television, while Sam had both arms wrapped around his brother's leg and his face pushed against Dean's thigh.
Cas did what he always did: went to work, came home, paid bills, did his best to be there for the two of them. It was only when he was alone and settled upstairs in the bed he and Dean shared that he took the moment to introspect how the long-habitual jealousy of Sam had left him completely. His checkbook might have eased the Winchesters’ burdens, but he finally understood that his presence meant more than that: and, though his relationship was Dean was still the most precious in his life, and always would be, he couldn’t help but feel a special pride that he’d done so well by Sam.
He’d never meant for Cas to pay. He knew that he came from, and had, money, but that wasn’t why he had Alan call Cas. He’d hoped, somewhat crazily, that Cas would vouch for him. Tell him he wasn’t totally bad and made wrong—that he’d been good once, that he’d been healthy once. That somehow, that would count in his favor.
“You here about your little ‘Sammy?’” the man had mocked, not even bothering to zip his pants. Like Dean wasn’t worth his modesty.
"Yeah yeah, don't bore him!" Gabe said, a little too loudly. "Lamberghini's don't take corners well," he said to Cas. Anywho. You want me to fire up the 360?"
Sam’s damn monkey. I always knew I was your favorite,” Dean sat the lion on top of the basket and went back to rooting. “Ellen, you made me hot-pies!”
“KGB’s. No question. Don’t let the name fool you—they are all American. If there’s one thing you can say for this great country, it’s that we can grill a hamburger.” She unwrapped her sandwich. “I have their number in my blackberry if you want.”
Sam stomach suddenly felt tighter. His heart sped up. He remembered Cas’ breathing tricks and kept himself steady. “That’s...weird.”
“I’m glad too.” She smiled warmly at Sam, then looked sternly at Dean. “As for you, I’ve a few things to say, but I’ll wait to we’re all in session. Now scoot. This is Sam’s time with me.”
Bobby huffed and stomped his way to the edge of the bed, then pulled a stuffed lion from behind his back.
, who was good and kind and didn’t flinch or frown or withdraw when he said he’d broken into shops and homes or hustled pool in an effort to support them. Who didn’t think he was a co-dependent freak for wanting to make sure all was well with his brother, at all times. Who didn’t view him as damaged or broken for having grown up under the fists of a drunk. Who should have been the focus of his life at the moment.
, he was so damn sad, now, about Jess. And he just wanted to spill it with Cas at his back, steady and safe in the dark.
“Right, enlighted’s Latin big bro, meaning to realize something big and important. ‘Enlighted’ means to see literal light.”
ldquo;I gotcha,” Dean murmured, rubbing the tense muscles between his brother’s shoulders. “Relax, buddy. Close your eyes.”
Cas nodded, and did the most embarrassing, fake-man-slap on his friend’s arm he’d ever done. “Deal,” he said, relieved when Peter laughed, and hit him back so hard it hurt.
“That corn maze,” he said, indicating the field across from them, “scared the life out of me as a kid. Especially the scarecrows at each dead-end.”
“I don’t know,” Cas murmured, unable to stop himself from reaching across the short distance between them and gripping Sam’s shoulder. “Sam, I don’t know if God oversees everything or if he’s just a...consultant,” he said, causing the younger Winchester to chuckle, “but a long time ago, an ethics professor said ‘if God made pain, he also made opiates to take away that pain.’* And as a doctor, that’s my job. I relieve pain the only way I know how. The same way your brother tries by bringing you breakfast and buying you clothes. The same way I do by—” he stopped. Sam turned to him, smiling through his tears.
Dean threw his first punch. It snapped the man’s head to the side, but Dean wouldn’t let him fall. McCloud gasped, and, for the first time, Dean saw fear in his face, in his eyes.
Dean let out a dull moan as they neared the back of the Emergency Room, toward the Operating galleries. Cas wanted to say something reassuring, something warm and soothing, the way Dean always could. But out of the safe privacy of their bed, he felt dumb and lost.
“Your brother ain’t any different from anyone else I see. And they still get themselves where they need to be. Sam, I can’t keep having this conversation.”
“Alright.” He held up his hands in surrender. “Alright. Let’s make a deal. Quarter million will do ya?”
“We’re your family too, you dumb, selfish, sonofabitch. Get your head out of your ass and quit trying to carry the world by your lonesome. You know for a fact what you’ve been doing ain’t working. Sam may be the one who ended up in that bed, but your bags are stuffed just as full with crap you need get off your chest. And Cas—”
sobbing, I swear to God. That drama lady was so friggin’ proud of herself. But I thought that Sam guy—soon as he’s up for it, I’m getting him to movie night.” Andy smiled, and this time it didn’t seem all that strange to Cas, but warm—maybe a bit over-eager to prove himself as a good guy—with a genuine compassion and intelligence that he appreciated, and hoped Dean would. “I’m not taking no for an answer, buddy. You spend way too much time on your own. So I’m coming to get you tonight at 8:30, and we can go up and fight for the S’mores Pop-Tarts. Okay?”
“You know he’s just scared for you, right? He’ll be calmer once he gets here. He just hates to think you weren’t safe, and he wasn’t there.”
“Well, guess what, Doc? You’re in good company,” he’d said, with a clearly flirtatious wink. And Cas had fallen into something no amount of money or privilege or casual tossing of a last name could possibly buy.
"It was an accident, Sammy, an accident," Dean smoothed his brother's hair, "not your fault, not anyone's fault. I know it hurts, bud, but it wasn't your fault."
“I already did.” He heaved in a pained breath. “And that filthy animal wasn’t worth the cost of the baggie he snorted from.”
“I can’t help but wonder...if he knew where I’d ended up, would he have listened to Missouri? Done better? Or just drank harder?”
And then he thought of Sam’s bald, stitched head, and the way he’d hide his eyes in Dean’s shirts when the crippling migraines hit, and felt not only guilt, but the savage ache of separation.
“Shutup.” Gabe launched to his feet. “Listen, Cas—I get that you’re struggling. And I just met those kids once. But...
Dean—the one whose sole purpose was to protect a younger, more innocent brother, the one capable of boxing up all his own feelings to tend to those he loved.
though.” Gabe sank onto his ridiculous zebra striped love seat and propped his feet up on the end. “First of all, you don’t see shades of gray. No, you’re not as bad as Mike or Ralph, but you don’t do well with philosophical or moral questioning. Never have. You ace science and math and grammar quizzes. But you know Lou and me? We ran circles around you guys when it came to tear-jerking essays on Russian lit and why lions love the lambs they kill.”
“Sure thing, Pop. That’s how the drunken, high, single, bluegrass musician took home a son. A case study in the history of the American adoption system.”
“It’s a perfectly natural act, mate. Trust me. Get it done all the time.” Sam just stared. “If you’d like it in a syringe, I’ve got a spoon with your name on it.”
Cas officially knew he was the worst person alive. But somehow, when Sam looked at him warmly, he couldn’t bring himself to feel it.
, like he’s a kid instead of a full-grown man—and gets him sitting on the bed, bundled up against his brother, hair still dripping from his unfinished shower.
His heart began to speed up, and he wondered if this is how Sam’s panics felt: lost and lonely and useless and delegated to a small, lonely corner of the world with empty platitudes drifting by and doing nothing to ease the ache of loss loss loss.
“I guarantee he’s got ace security with hiding spaces more covert than Anne Frank’s attic. We’re talking about the word of a big-wig businessman versus the word of a recovering junkie and his high-school dropout brother with the questionable legal history. Who the hell do you think the world is gonna believe?”
Dean packed up all their new supplies in laundry baskets and timed the drive to Rosemount so they were striding through the doors at the exact moment visiting hours began. They waited patiently while the nurses searched each and every item for anything labeled contraband, and then gave the okay for them to head upstairs.
A pair of black shoes appeared in his blurry vision. He managed to look upward and the short, dark haired man, dressed in slacks and a long black coat, lighting up a cigarette with a slightly predatory smile. “I find it odd that so many of your kind are drawn to Churches. You sleep on their steps, hang around with your little cups and cardboard signs. Where
too many beers, and telling him what she said Sam was too devoted to say: that Gordon was a manipulative, controlling, emotionally abusive prick.
Sam had sworn he wouldn’t lie again. But, hearing Cas and Dean’s joyful reassurances, he just didn’t have the heart to bring in Ruby. To bring in Crowley. To bring in all his own insanity. They’d given him all he needed to be strong. And he had been, damnit. Once upon a time. He wasn’t going to let them lose one another—or themselves—anymore.
“I know. Cas—I did freak out. Completely. But I guess I’m just...used to Dean. Hurt. Sadly. I mean...
Two days later he himself was puking, and, for once, uncomplaining at both his brother’s and boyfriend’s overbearing fussing.
“Think of Sam—sick and homeless and trying to find change to eat and maybe call his brother, and then at the mercy of that asshole's pistol, and that doesn’t
Dean took a deep breath and nodded. “I’m sorry,” he said—lowly, directly. “I like this place—the burgers are as awesome as they say.”
“You think you can sleep?”Dean asked. Sam settled back on the soft pillows, the firm but comfortable mattress, and the blankets and sheets. Smiled.
Sam flinched. Dean instantly leaned forward. “Look...my brother’s been through a hell of a lot, okay?”
Sam changed in to one of the pajama sets Dean and Cas always kept for him. He brushed his teeth with the toothbrush they kept in the guestroom, washed his face with his favorite soap, and, moments after climbing into bed, found Dean at his side.
“I know,” he mumbled as she lead him into her small office. Dean and Cas sat on the loveseat, as they had been in the past few weeks, while Missouri lowered Sam into a chair at a right angle to them, then sat directly facing him. “So. You’ve been missing groups, meds, and meals. Why?”
“Sammy, the way we are now? Is you lying because you think I’ll hate you or something. And me imagining the absolute worst case scenario, like him stabbing infants in bassinets while you wait for a hit.”
And, for the first time since Cas had first gotten that call, he saw it: Sam’s legendary anxiety. Of course he didn’t want to leave Dean’s side: he’d left Jess’ to go to the library, and Maddy’s so she could go to work, and their father’s so he could live a life free of pain and violence.
, that it brought an ache to his chest. “Listen...Dean would seriously kick my ass if he knew I was calling. But I just wanted to say...please don’t be angry at him. This is my fault. I never...I never wanted him to know. He’s not violent, Cas—you know it. But he’s protective. And I...I pushed his buttons.” He heard the younger man’s breath hitch. “I’m so sorry. I’ve come between you two...over and over. And I haven’t meant to. Three’s a crowd, right?” Cas heard a second of struggled breathing. “Please...you can hate me. Be mad at me. Tell Dean you’re done intervening for me. But
“’Doctor.’ And where is it you’re practicing medicine?” Gordon’s question was clearly a way of outing Cas’ degree as little more than one in English or Cultural Anthropologies or Media Studies. Dean felt himself arching his back in pride when Cas answered:
And that? That was just the sort of thing Dean didn’t care about. Not a bit. He’d lived his whole life without it. Sam had lived huge stretches without it. He didn’t care for Cas’ smell. He didn’t care for Cas’ warmth. He didn’t need it.
Me, being Dean. His so-called life partner. Who’d obviously won him through his sweet, demure, gentlemanly-adoring behavior.
"Promise, buddy." He gave him a quick kiss in his hair and patted his back a little roughly. "C'mon. Go to your meeting, alright?"
Cas makes breakfast. Dean gets his brother up, gets him to shower, gets him into clean clothes, gets him down to the kitchen, where Sam chews eggs and toast, drops his fork, and bursts into tears. They get him onto the sofa and hold him between them until Cas has to go to work. He kisses Dean’s cheek, smoothes Sam’s hair, and braces himself for another sleepless shift.
Cas didn’t offer to help. Instead, he sat in the livingroom and scanned the paper for any updates on McCloud’s condition and the ongoing investigation. He heard Dean’s low grumbles and Sam’s laughter, and Dean’s little snorts of amusement from time to time. When dinner was ready, Sam was smiling, holding out a plate of baked chicken, green-beans, broccoli, and brussel sprouts, and a baked sweet potato. Cas looked at his friend’s eager-to-please expression and felt an unusual spike of resentment. Sam had invaded his little world with Dean, brought violence down on all of them, and still had the nerve to look pleading. After all Cas had tried to given him, a decent dinner wasn’t going to make up for the doubt Cas now had about his choice to stay with the elder Winchester.
“What had to be done,” Dean said coldly, and closed his eyes, chin resting on the top of his brother’s head.
“Of course! Everyone, I’d like you to meet Matt, my newest little champ. Matt took a tumble from a tree house and barely let out a squeak.” Peter crouched in front of the boy, who had clearly been crying, and smiled warmly. “Now, I’d prefer if you don’t tell any of my other little friends, since I can’t possibly afford to be this generous with
Sam shot upright, gasping, heart racing, trying to walk himself through the deep breathing Cas had taught him, the focusing exercises he’d learned in groups and with Missouri. It was no use. This is how he felt after losing Jess and Dad, after leaving school. He couldn’t think, couldn’t calm down, couldn’t bear a life of constant grief and anxiety. Missouri had helped him understand what drugs had helped him do: fill the voids of lost confidence and faith he’d had when he arrived at college. When he’d met Jess. When lawschool and children and a life of peace for himself and his brother was
“I trust you, Sam. Trust you to go home and rest and come back clean and sober. Do you think you can trust me to care for your brother in that time?”
“Hi sweetie,” Ellen greets Sam, as if he were walking through her front door for dinner and not lying in bed, too weak to stand. “Sorry we didn’t make it right away. Bobby can’t keep his dates straight.”
Yet week after week, in huge, foreboding red ink, on Cas and Dean’s calendar, admist their already hectic work and Sam schedules, there lay “Family Therapy.” Twice. They were deeply fortunate to have bosses who were gracious and understanding: Jay, Dean’s boss, had lost his brother and father to complications from alcoholism: Anna, Cas’ supervisor, just plain understood.
“They never should have left the damn bus,” he said, as the corn fields rippled and the creatures closed in.
Dean laughed, keeping it as quiet as possible. Cas’ precise, overly-polite language always made him laugh. His boyfriend blushed a little—Cas had told him no one had ever thought he was funny until he met Dean, just weird—and the elder Winchester felt a sharp, sudden longing. He wanted,
“Thank you,” Cas said, in lieu of the Sam and Dean, who were still holding weakly to one another. Missouri stepped forward and touched Sam’s cheek lightly, smiling with her usual warmth.
“My thoughts exactly.” Andy tossed a second empty stick toward the back and unwrapped another lollipop.
to focus on him right now. And we’re to the point that we can give him that attention and our relationship won’t suffer. Right?”
Truth be told, despite the occasional run-in and jabs the younger Winchester threw his way, Cas was too enthralled with his brand-new discovery to pay it much heed. Sure, he’d heard the rumors, seen the magazines, accidently walked in on a few of Gabriel’s choice pay-per-view moments, but up until Dean, it all had been a rumor, or something mythical, like Santa Claus and his reindeer or the Tooth Fairy and her bag of dimes.
"I get it, bro, I do. I hear you. But I'm telling you, you quit sleeping, you get depressed. We've seen it before." Cas chanced a few tentative steps forward and is able to see Sam curled at the foot of the sofabed, hovering close to his brother's leg. Dean reached down and gently stroked his hair. "I'm alright, Sammy. Everything's alright. Just close your eyes."
Sam mumbled something that sounded like “share Cas’.” Dean swore under his breath, but smiled as he did, especially when Sam reached over and snagged a few fries, chewing happily. It was all signs of a good day, and the old behaviors of sharing everything—with the exception of Dean’s car and Sam’s laptop. Growing up as they had, they’d often compromised, shared, and made do with what they had. Territorial they’d never been: quite a revelation to Cas, whose brain was stuffed full of the invisible borders his brothers had laid throughout their mansions.
,” Sam nearly shouted. “I signed papers saying I wanted medical treatment! I didn’t say I was obligated to tell you every detail of my life!”
“I—” Sam, unable to free the blanket, clenched his hands. “It’s...it’s hard. I don’t...I never feel good.”
, Dean. You used to say if I watched his videos my eyes would bleed. I was actually scared of MTV for awhile.”
"Shhhh," Dean leaned his chin on top of his brother's head and began to hum the chorus of "smoke on the water."
The halfway house came into view. Andy pulled over, set the parking’ brake and ‘be right back lights,’ and sighed. “I’m just...trying to support my Dad, and you guys, and Tracy, and keep it all together, and for the first time, I’m really feeling it...you know?”
A further explanation of the context Cas used this in, and how Sam morphed it, will appear in a later chapter.
“Stop being a martyr, Dean,” he snapped. Dean frowned. “You just had a serious injury. You have no business worrying about Sam and I.”
right and fine. If he needed a boost, in confidence, in  Sitting in the Rosemount waiting room, imagining the Impala barreling toward him in the night, Sam tried to tell himself that all this new threat needed was Dean’s reassurance. That somehow his brother would say everything would be fine and the sickness and shame and dark, dark future would all be erased.
“Hey,” Dean said, voice upbeat and gentle. He rested a hand on his younger brother’s back. “Thought you were off the drip.”
Cas listened to his footsteps down the stairs and heard the car start. He waited until the engine had rumbled away in the night before he ventured down the hall to find Sam rocking back and forth on the edge of the bed. When Cas pulled the younger man into his arms, he lost track of who was shaking harder, and just held on like they were the only two people left on a vast, dark Earth.
Dean stepped forward and held out his jacket, and Sam let his brother help him into it as if he’s a kid again, getting ready to be walked to school.
“I’m back!” Dean bellowed. Cas smiled, hearing his partner’s enthusiastic pounding on their stairs. He’d long ago given up trying to get Dean to take them one at a time, and at a decent human speed.
When Cas came down the stairs in the morning and told him he was going to the airport, Dean didn’t even come out from under the Impala to say goodbye.
Peter Balthazar, the hospital’s emergency pediatrician, was dressed as he normally did for work--in a t-shirt and jeans. Of course, when on the clock, he wore the standard white labcoat over them. It was one of the many, many infractions that drove the staffs of every hospital that employed him to madness. He’d survived at Cas’ only because it was out in middle-America, where highly trained and unquestionably brilliant doctors were in short supply, and Balthazar, as maddening as he could be to the administration, was a thorough, attentive, and adored doctor by the children he treated.
Day after day, Sam had wandered, thinking, trying to plan, hating Dean and Cas and his Dad, and gathering change for another call, something to eat, clean water to drink. He wouldn’t admit anything other than hearing his brother’s voice spurred him to prove him wrong. Because it didn’t comfort him, didn’t remind him of anything safe and warm and good. No. Never.
Dean slammed his knee into the man’s stomach. “Sorry, ‘Crowley.’ I’m the one thing that can’t be bought.”
surface, was when he was anxious, or depressed, or something was bothering him he couldn’t share with anyone but his brother.
“I’ve got faith in you, Sam. You’re gonna bounce back. You always do. And when you don’t remember, you hang on tight to this.”
He’d had it before, of course. His college girlfriend was Rachel: a blonde, tall, mature woman who he thought had always born a slight resemblance to Barbara Eden, a crush from his youth. She was kind, calm, and brilliant. She was a pre-law student determined to make it as a New York City District Attorney before she was thirty-five, and last he’d checked, her career was on track. She’d weathered all his awkward advances with warm smiles and gently coached him through his first, second, third, and following love making sessions until he could deliver what she wanted.
Sam and Dean had been napping, curled up together like baby twins, or newborn puppies. Sam had his floppy brown head nestled under Dean’s chin, and Dean his his arms draped loosely around his brother’s slim frame. Cas knew Dean would slug him if he were awake for those “bile-barfing” analogies of two men who could be very tough when called for, but were just sad, frightened children at heart, retreating back into the shelter of each other, where acceptance and safety and comfort could always be found.
“My brother Lou is scared of clowns,” Cas said. “Gabriel told me the older boys were at a summer camp one year and a clown was there for an evening rec night. Lou apparently threw a volleyball at him and started screaming ‘rape’ when he got too close. Our mother was mortified. Gabriel found it hilarious, of course. I believe Michael did too.”
from cities all over the country and didn’t bother looking at the caller ID. “Yeah, what?” he barked.
“Alright, bro, alright,” Dean murmured, appearing, suddenly, to shut off the shower. Sam could feel his brother’s breath in his hair, Dean’s hands carefully pulling a towel around his sopping shoulders—and he was naked, still, crouched down in the tub, and he didn’t even care at this point, didn’t have the
It truly spoke volumes about Cas’ life that, when he answered his phone and heard nothing but swearing, he still wasn’t sure who was calling. He could think of five people off the bat who’d called barking curses at him—and that was when they were sober.
. Like, ‘makes me want to be a better man,’ special. Or at least finish my Master’s and stay sober.”
do well when he can’t move around like he’s used to. The garage called Cas because he was trying to get himself under a car and couldn’t get himself back up.”
“Stop it,” Andy snapped, gripping his shoulder. “It’s Christmas and I don’t want you going Scrooge on me.”
Cas felt a sudden shortness of breath and began to pace. Sam would be here soon: before he realized it, even. Sam would be here, and he’d be pale and frightened and anxious, and Cas would sit and explain that everything was fine, that Dean was safe, and he would get them some water and pat Sam’s arm and the time would fly, because Cas would have a focus. He’d be as good a brother to Sam as Dean was, and that meant a lot of calm and patience and understanding and compassion, and Cas had to prep, had to practice those skills, rehearse his stoicism and warmth so when Sam arrived, he could be everything he’d need.
Cas joined the Winchester brothers feeling lighter than before. Sam was scratching absently at the tablecloth, head down, while Dean said something in a low, serious voice—something he cut off with a smile as Cas approached.
Sam started to cry. Not sob: just open his eyes enough that tears flowed out and into the bedding. Cas leaned forward, put a gentle arm around him, and guided him up into a sitting position in that careful, practiced, professional way he had.
“It’s just soup, Sammy. You’ve made it for me,” he murmured. “You gotta eat again, kiddo. C’mon. We’ll do it together.”
A loan tear slipped out of the corner of the younger man’s face. “Dean? Can...can me and you and Cas go now?”
Missouri always smiled warmly at him when he arrived for session, even if he knew she planned to ream him out.
Sam stayed still. Cas padded quietly across the floor and lay a hand on his shoulder. “Sam? It’s after noon.”
Ellen slipped around the two with a basket and a warm, maternal grin. “Alright boys, sword-fight’s over. Hi honey.” She plopped the basket down on Dean’s nightstand. “I hit the ‘net and whipped up anything I could think of that was hospital-friendly, only done right.”
But he’d always had places to make them. And, when his own confidence failed him, he’d go talk it through with Dean.
his little brother lived, he might turn out to be little more than a carrot with a digestive system. So Dean was gonna bask, damnit.
Dean and Cas launched out of the hazardly parked car and ran toward the tall, still figure they saw huddled between the flashing lights of the police, ambulance, and fire departments. Dean's arms were open and accepting his younger brother before he reached him, and Sam came willingly, sagging into Dean as easily as a well-worn armchair.
hates, that in one of his brother’s immense moments of devotion, that he’s letting his mind wander to Cas. And it’s not that Dean’s not enough—because he’s always been everything—or that Cas fills a deficiency. It’s just...that Sam misses the calm, the reassurance, the steadfastness devotions Cas had displayed toward them. Without asking anything in return.
Cas finally took a deep breath and forced himself to return to his room for a one on with his lone message. The palms of his hands were a bit sweaty as he pressed one for 'listen.' He had no idea what would be on the other end, but he imagined it wouldn’t be without retribution, frustration, anger, and everything in between.
Cas felt sudden goosebumps on his arms. For the life of him, he’d never understand how she knew what she did. “I don’t know how bad it is, but...he would not do well with the loss of a limb.”
Cas leaned forward and kissed him on the cheek. “You’re a good man,” he murmured. “Please let me help. Partners, right?”
The store was a chain, but this branch billed itself as a “Superstore” branch. Information was in the center, and functioned as a help desk for the electronic readers and a librarian station for looking up and ordering inventory. Sam really enjoyed working Information. He often got into long discussions with the customers, recommending books and authors to one another, and he personally enjoyed solving the tech issues of the little electronic readers. He far preferred it to working the registers, which often had long lines on weekends and frequently tested his stupidly shoddy nerves.
“I don’t go around hurting innocent people, Cas,” Dean snapped. “Or even people I see who would deserve it. But I’m not going to let anyone get away with threatening my brother like he did.”
The great thing about having a smoopy, talky, emo, girly brother like Sam is Dean never had to ask for, or show, his own need.
“Dude, you’d be kicking in the door and shouting in my face and sitting by my bed with a bat and you know it.”
He asks “where was he shot?” and “where was he taken?” and “were you able to stay with him?” and “I’m on my way,” and disconnects.
!” Sam threw the older man away, watching the syringe roll off. He leapt to his feet and stomped on it, relieved to hear the glass shatter beneath his foot. Then he turned and stared straight into the barrel of a gun.
Cas would always be fuzzy on the details of the next minute. According to the Winchesters, John had drawn back his arm, Sam had lost his hold on his elder brother, and Cas had thrown himself between Dean and his father, hoping to stave off the oncoming fight. The next thing he remembered was lying face-first on the lawn, the blow evidently having knocked him sideways and flat. He hadn’t felt any pain at first, only a fuzzy confusion at the dirt and grass and the sounds of shouting above.
Cas felt a light blush in his face and pretended to be fascinated by the IV. “I’ll tolerate you for some time,” he said, ignoring Dean’s somewhat dirty laugh.
Gordon had been. Gordon had been, because, every moment he wasn’t, meant that there would be some retribution: withholding of sex, of phone calls, of visits. Long diatribes about how screwed he was, how messed up, how only Gordon understood and how he could help get him where he needed to be if only Dean could stop fucking everything up.
Cas felt himself blush—Dean was the first person to ever bring that out of him, and he knew, for a fact, that it was one of Dean’s turn-ons. Same with Cas’ still damp hair. And yes: white t-shirts.
It wasn’t until Sam was out of the car and loping toward the bookstore and Dean was guiding the Impala back home to Cas that his stomach suddenly lurched with such anxiety and fear that he very nearly had to pull over. The jig was up: Sam was sane and calm and safe at work. Cas was back, as mysteriously as he’d left. And there was nowhere to go but home to him, and no overgrown brother to cower behind.
“I heard.” Mr. Gallagher leaned back and smiled with a sudden, never-before-seen tenderness that reminded Sam so much of Dean it was all he could do not to run for the elevator bay and back to the safety of his brother. “Don’t worry, champ. I’ve got it from here. You hurting?”
“Giving is the reason for the season!” Dean barked. Cas lead them past their over-the-top Christmas tree that was jammed into the corner and up the steps. He’d been woken early this morning to Sam and Dean bickering and swearing at each other as they wrestled it through the door, and the brothers had been going at full-throttle ever since. He could see how people thought they could be a little off their rockers: one minute they’d be quietly moving in sync; the next, shouting curses and threatening bodily harm; the next laughing and reminiscing over some childhood memory; the next, bitching over some unresolved childhood fight; the next, slumped together on the couch looking like two puppies bedding down.
Anna sat up a little straighter and focused ever-more intently on him. “What is it, Cas,” she said, in that way of gently demanding an answer rather than raise her voice in question.
Sam’s eyes were back on Dean. “I only know some of this stuff. It looks like his heart-rate is high because his blood pressure’s low. And his temperature’s abnormal.”
He goes down four more times on the British/Scottish/drug-dealing/sonofabitch. He felt the truth screaming at him, ever-closer, each and every time.
“Shit. Sorry—just me. Think I broke my damn toe,” Dean mumbled. Cas rolled over and got a face-full of grumpy boyfriend, Dean kissing him quickly before sliding under the covers and pulling him close.
"It's not that you're a guy," she said firmly. "It's that the last guy Dean dated left him with a black eye and a few cracked ribs."
He found a drugstore and shoplifted chewing gum, a few candy bars, and a bottle of Purell. He’d found he could shower at the public pool if he was careful not to get caught sneaking in, but in the meantime, he needed something to feel clean. He chewed the entire pack of gum at once and tried to eat the candy, but it sent his sick stomach off, so he hunted for change for a bit until he had enough for a soft pretzel from a street-vendor. That went down easier. Afterwards, he wasn’t sure what to do, and found a quiet place to sit to try and think. He was coming down from the small high and could feel the confidence, the relaxation, the clarity slipping away. He needed a plan, and goals, something he’d always excelled at putting together, for himself and others.
“Cas deserves...something. His patience is unreal, man.” Andy turned his blinker on. “Does he ever get pissed?”
when Cas explained, just asked why he’d chosen to move so far away from his roots, and for the first time since he’d left home, Cas answered honestly.
Sometimes, when Dean couldn’t sleep, he wondered if that was how he was made, or if he’d adapted in order to provide for Sam’s immediate, intense reactions to hardships. He wondered, if John had mastered his demons, if it would be him relying heavily on his normal, well-adjusted brother, and Sam would calmly and logically walk him through his initial reactions.
“Just like you had a right to drink yourself sick, and disappear, and beat us like animals!” Dean roared. Sam grabbed his brother and held tight.
Back in Dean’s room, Ash was actively drawing a “map of glory” on Dean’s cast while Dean threatened all sorts of bodily harm and Andy attempted interference, looking relieved when Cas and Sam ventured back in.
would understand this: it doesn’t matter if you’re there after the wound’s bled out. You’re needed the moment the blood starts gushing.”
Cas that it would be alright if he pushed him away from Dean a bit. And he’d meant it. But now, in the dark of his small rented room of Ash’s halfway house, he regretted it. He hadn’t had limitations on talking to his brother since he’d left Rosemount, and he’d come to rely heavily on Dean’s constant availability.
Cas turned away. Gabe crossed the distance between them, sank onto the sofa, and tossed an arm around his shoulder.
” Dean yanked him close. “And I’m not leaving you. Not leaving, Sammy. Not dying or walking off or drinking myself sick anymore. I’m here and I’ve gotcha, and that’s all you gotta think about. C’mon, bro. Sleep,” Dean pushed his lips near Sam’s temple and stroked his hair. “Please sleep, Sammy. Please sleep, buddy. We’re all safe here. Just relax and sleep.” Dean pulled him closer, whispered softer. “Don’t worry. I gotcha. I’ll be here, the whole time. Okay?”
what he felt for Dean, no matter how much it pained him to admit. He might start out with his usual hesitations, shy and awkward advances, but once Dean had his shirt off, and had half-lifted Cas off the floor with what seemed to be his mouth alone, he forgot how to be shy and turned into some embarrassing, undignified, excited groper, hands everywhere, wanting more and more and
"Soon, buddy," he murmured. "Before you know it even, okay? I know it's hard. It's hard on me too. But if you don't do this you won't feel better. I
He tries to rectify this. Two days after the surgery, while Dean seems to be resting peacefully, Sam goes for coffee, and Cas chances taking his partner’s hand in his own. His temperature is down, but still high, and Anna is still concerned that infection lurks in his blood, potentially threatening his kidneys , liver, and, most of all, the fragile hold of his damaged leg. Cas brushes a few strands of hair back behind Dean’s ear, and suddenly his boyfriend makes a low, pitiful mew of distress and begins to toss. Cas reaches down, places firm hands on his shoulders and pins him to the mattress, orders him to be calm. Dean writhes against him.
"Sammy. What could you say that I don't know? Huh?" he smiled. "You think Jess and Madison didn't know? Even
Cas was on his own front porch by morning. Dean was cooking breakfast, barking at Sam, who was thoroughly ignoring him and sipping coffee while reading the paper. The table was set for three, although Cas hadn’t told them he’d changed his ticket. Sam spotted him first—his eyes widened, and he moved to stand, but Cas shook his head and smiled. Sam beamed back, and slumped back in his chair. Cas left his bag at the bottom of the steps and crossed to the kitchen, watching Dean flip pancakes and scramble eggs, before giving an affectionate wink toward Sam.
Cas was a warm, shaking mess against Dean’s back. Dean didn’t want to feel his disappointment. His horror. His rage.
,” Cas moaned, dropping his head forward, tears stinging his eyes. His brothers’ hand rubbed a circle on his back. “I don’t want them hurt. I don’t want Dean to feel he needs to avenge. I don’t want them to be
Andy nodded at the backpack as he pulled away from the bookstore. “You stay over at Dean’s and Cas’ last night?”
Cas took the time to change Sam’s sheets and gather his laundry. He unpacked the bag of clean and folded shirts and sweats and boxers and deposited them in his drawers. He dusted off the dresser and made sure all the pictures were straight. He couldn’t do much for the cold tile floor, or the fake-cheerful walls, or the carefully sealed windows: they felt like home to him. He saw them more than he saw his own bedroom.
Somehow, Dean gets him out of the tub and into dry sweats and socks and a shirt—and Sam struggles to ignore the fact that his brother just
Dean shut his eyes, hand moving soft and slow over his brother's hair. For the first time since this unspeakable nightmare had begun, he seemed to be battling his own emotions.

Dean’s hand kept moving, pads of his fingers resting lightly on his forehead, than smoothing along over his scalp, along the old, now buried, scar line, over his temple, down to the nape of his neck. Knuckles brushing lightly at his cheek before he started the soothing motion over once more.
Sam launched himself forward and slammed his fist into the shorter man’s face. He didn’t hold back—he slammed and punched and beat and until he had the gun in his hands. The older man on
Dean had whined and pleaded for a place with burgers and fries, but, somehow, between Sam and Cas’ awkward truce, they’d been able to convince him to come home.
not the way Dean is with you. But I—you’re—“ his voice hitched. He reached over and laid a hand on his shoulder instead. Cas smiled and squeezed his friend’s hand. “I get it. You don’t have to be perfect for me, Cas. I can help you too.”
Cas did something he hadn’t since childhood: he turned and pressed his face into his brother’s neck. And then, finally, he cried. He cried for Dean, the man he'd fallen in love with, who'd never had the chance to explore his potential. He cried for Sam, the adopted kid-brother who'd done things so far beyond his comprehension that he couldn't even properly support him on a logical level. He cried for Gabriel, in love with a woman who would, he was sure, never accept him with the Dionysian lifestyle he lead.
“See you tomorrow, honey!” Missouri called. “And Lily—up on time tomorrow, alright? It’s gonna be okay.” She smiled and waved, then turned and gave a great huff in their direction. “My God that girl wears me down. I’ve dealt with homeless prostitutes with more optimism. C’mon in.” She crossed the short space, took Sam’s arm in hers, and got him on his feet. “Sam, before we get started, I’ve got a bone to pick with you.”
“Yeah. Well.” Dean gasped, embarrassed by how much he was sweating, how hard he was breathing. “I’m dreamin’ now.”
“Sam...I’m...I’m so worried for you,” Cas said, voice hitching. “Please...just come downstairs with me. I’ll fix you some soup, or eggs. We could sit on the porch for a bit. It’s a very nice day.”
“And you’ve helped me,” Cas leaned forward, mimicking Dean’s touch on his own cheek. “I want to know a bond half as strong as you and Sam have. It’s remarkable.”
“I know, buddy. It’s okay. Everything’s gonna be okay.” Dean rubbed Sam’s back, up through his sweaty, greasy tangles of overgrown brown hair.“We gotcha. We’re gonna get you back on your feet. Get you fixed up and healthy and ready to come home.”
Dean’s hug was nothing like this. Cas had been close to Dean enough to know his tenderness, acceptance, and love, without desire, without conditions established. Just warm hands and warm eyes and a warm, wide heart. The window was partly open, and Cas could hear Sam’s soft, repeated apologies while Dean hushed him and murmured that everything was going to be alright, that they were safe, that they were finally, finally safe. The rest went without saying—that Sam could screw up and Dean could screw up and they would always come back to one another, always come back to the love they shared, the impenetrable, unbreakable bond that had been their birthright.
He’d have blown Crowley ten, twelve, fifteen times or more if it would bring Dean right now. Because Sam finally understood that all his feelings of power and control and maturity were nothing but delusions and chemical highs. He couldn’t trust his own instincts: they’d betrayed him. And, by trusting them, he’d betrayed Dean. And Cas. And the memories of Maddy and Jess.
A few weeks back, Sam had stood, swaying and still sick, but determined. He’d gone to meals and meds. He’d gone to groups. And then, right when there was “progress” being made, he’d reverted back to Old Sam—bedridden, silent, and starving. Cas did his best to reassure Dean that it was all part of the treatment process, but he was wondering what was happening himself.
“I’m sorry,” he said, “I hope you weren’t trying to make peace. You know I hate to talk about my family like that. It’s just—”
“I know, I know,” his friend laid a calming hand on his arm. “I’m sorry. That came out wrong. I’m just saying...it’s Christmas. And you’ve been stressed about getting Dean something awesome...there it is. Let me help you get it. I know you’re good for it.”
he does,” she chuckled. “But when I first came around, he thought I was a blonde bimbo who’d latched on to his genius baby brother in the hopes of never working. It was hard and it hurt, but after he saw me standing by Sam and doing well in my own right, he opened up and treated me like family, and he has ever since.” She dropped her voice once more. “They grew up in this horrible bubble where no one understood what their lives were like but one another. And it’s very hard for them to trust people outside it. But once you’re in, you won’t find two better people in the world. I promise, Cas. You’ll get there, and I’ll help you.”
Sam arrived with his usual duffel, but with also with a big brown grocery bag. He’d decided to make them dinner, as he had in the past, before the “illness.” Dean bitched when he saw the fresh fruit and veggies Sam had bought, but grunted less when he saw he’d picked up an apple pie to go with it.
Dean’s hand found his own. Seconds later, his mouth found his own. Miles away, Sam was curled in bed, under the extra warm green blanket they’d bought, struggling and suffering. Cas silently willed strength and hope to him, and then embraced the one closest to him, vowing to all the absent others that he’d love them with all he had, across all the years he had left, no matter how hard they tried his loyalty, or however violently they assaulted his patience.
“I haven’t slept yet, but don’t worry. Sam has been very supportive. I knew you’d be alright, although the infection had me worried.”
. A man who was more than a dutiful son, a protective big brother. He’d had a brief image of an open road, a rock cassette, and rooms full of people who didn’t know him. A clean start in a new world.
“Great!” Andy marked his clipboard. “I’ll swing by when it’s time, okay? And I’ll make sure we get the good couch. It was nice talking to you.” He turned to Dean. “I didn’t catch your name.”
didn’t put him in the hospital for a month! It didn’t give him migraines and memory loss and nightmares!”
Sam’s breath had hitched, and he sort of reached his hand out, stopping just short of Dean’s. The elder Winchester reached across the remaining distance and squeezed his brother’s wrist, then gave him a light smack on the arm as Sam exited the Impala and struck out for the store entrance.

None of their ends had been Sam’s fault. But that’s not how his cruel and punishing psyche translated their losses.
down to make sure you boys had your knickers on straight, but after seeing that, I just may have to shower.”
“Bargain for what? Ten years less of prison in exchange for the name of who beat him up? They’re not after who did it. They’re after
Sam laughed. He remembered driving home with Jess, sore and tired and wanting nothing more than to shower and sleep, and Jess leaning back against the passenger headrest and saying “Dean and Cas are ridiculous about each other,” her way of saying
“You—I—you and Cas. Were...things were—they were good. You’re happy again. You and him. And—I almost broke you up. For good. I told him—I told Cas I’d—I’d back off. Be—be out of the picture. But I don’t want to lie to you, Dean—”
“See, that’s not gonna happen,” Dean murmured, keeping his voice a steady, calm, assured tone. “I’m gonna grind you into the ground and when they find you, the jig’ll be up. And it’ll be
Dean was about to launch at him. “Listen—” he snapped, when Peter cut in with “I don’t know about you, but I’m a little dry.”
Sam glanced to Dean, who tossed him an affectionate wink, before following him into the hall. The younger man’s hands were clenching and unclenching, and the lost, hurt little puppy look was back on his face.
He was passing by the nurse’s station when he remembered there was a world outside their little co-dependent trinity.
“You know, Cas, it might be easier to just swing by the cardiology ward and bring back a heartattack,” Sam said with a sudden sparkle. Cas smiled as Dean whacked his brother lightly.
He wanted so badly to give Dean something special this year: Cas too, for that matter. Something that said
McCloud seemed to be thoroughly  enjoying the services rendered. Dean was rage embodied: all he could see was Sam, stumbling toward him, a sweaty, smelly, sobbing mess in Rosemount’s waiting room: Sam, pleading with him not to be mad, not to abandon him: Sam, the little kid with dark floppy hair and big sweet eyes, who’d cuddle against his side and sleep easy, no matter what, outside or inside, was hurting him.
Sam’s eyes were huge. He gripped the edge of the table and somehow, without moving his chair, seemed to rotate a good five inches closer to his older brother. Dean cocked an eyebrow and gave a nod to Peter’s friend. “This here’s Sam--my brother--and Andy, his friend.”
Dean kissed him. He didn’t care that they were in a packed store, or that Gordon was nearby, or that their cart was the gayest on Earth. He didn’t care about jealous exes or rich relatives or alcoholic Fathers.
It was obvious, but it still hit him suddenly: without his contributed finacial support, Sam would never be able to afford his ongoing treatment. Dean would have to sell their little house. Sam would have to work full-time in order to get health insurance, and then find an in-network therapist--meaning no more Missouri. No more Alan. No more halfway house with Ash and Andy. Even if Ellen and Bobby helped--as they had when Sam had had his head smashed by their father's bottle and Dean had been trying to emancipate them--his financial abscence would severely affect their lives.
Sam’s room was small, with a slightly larger than a single bed, a dresser, mirror, and nightstand. Sam had his back to the door, and was curled up in tight little S, seeming far smaller than his twenty-six years.
“I’m over my head here, Sammy. I don’t know how to fix this—I’ve been trying, and I just ended up running you all the faster out the door. Think it’s time we pull in the big guns.” Sam’s breath hitched. It was his worst fears confirmed.
Cas picked at his appetizer and, after Sam made yet another dig, this one involving his three sips of wine on an empty stomach, gave up and excused himself to the restroom. Inside he loosened his tie, splashed water on his face, and leaned against the wall, staring at his face in the mirror. He had a super small chin. His cheeks were too round—Gabe always said he had a “moon” face. He looked tired, and sad. He didn’t have any of Dean’s ruggedness, his laugh lines, the warm crinkles in the corner of his eyes. He didn’t have the steel of either of the Winchesters, their height, their muscles. He hadn’t belonged back home and he’d been delusional to think he’d belong here.
Michael, Lou, Ralph, Gabe—they’d never been in love. He was sure of that. They didn’t even have steady dates. But Cas did. Cas finally had something no one else in his family had, and he was a mechanic named Dean Winchester, and he was strong and smart and handsome and understood what it felt like to be isolated and lonely and wanting to please an absent father and care for those around you who needed it.
This was what he’d been waiting his whole life for. A family that could endure the worst times. A family that could talk about their feelings without fighting or taking sides.
“That’s why you’re here, Sam. To rest, where it’s safe, where there’s people to protect and care for you. When you begin to eat normally, and move again, you’ll see: your body will respond faster than you think possible. You’ll gain strength. And as your body strengthens, your mind will too. Your mood will lift. And I’ll be here. Me and Dean both. All we want is for you to be well.”
“I can’t imagine any of my brothers, even the one I’m closest to, throwing themselves between me and an angry man’s fists. Certainly none of them have shown the incredibly protective nature you and Sam have toward one another.” He locked his eyes on firmly on Dean’s. “But all of them told me never to let someone lay a hand on me. Or allow someone in authority to bully me. Yes, it may have been because they trained me in business interests, but it’s true for all children. I understand you did all you could with what you had, and you did an amazing job—Sam is smart, healthy, and strong thanks to you. I just...I want you to know that, with me...you don’t have to carry it all alone anymore. I’ll help you, Dean.”
Sirens started up in the distance. Sam dropped his voice. “Those are for you, buddy. Few more minutes.”
Cas had forced himself to back, carefully, away. He hadn’t wanted to. But he also knew that there were times Dean needed Sam and Sam needed Dean, and no matter how bad his curiosity, he needed to try and honor that commitment.
He’d forgotten that the sound of passing cars never stopped. That light made it in past every filter. That an empty bed was cold.
then, could Dean roll over and clutch his brother to his chest and tell them both what he himself longed to hear—that everything was going to be okay. Sam never pointed out that it was Dean who needed
He hadn’t yet made it to group or individual therapy...but Alan said it was okay. That it may take time. That he was there for him to get it.
She’d been, without question, the best friend he’d ever had, and, despite his mother’s constant huffing that her family was “new capitalist,” had been as warmly received as any non-Morgan could ever be.
Sam had never been to Cas’ office before.
