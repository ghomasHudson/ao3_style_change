Dean sniffled.  They sat on the bottom step in silence as the clock ticked.  The sun began to cast lengthy shadows through the back windows.
“I’ll get you home, baby.  You just hang tight and breathe.”
“Mm-hm,” Dean agreed.  “We missed something.  He’s not getting
“Who am I going to tell?”
Billie’s frustration made it all the way to the satellite hundreds of miles above her head and right back into his earpiece. “This is why people keep hiding shit from you, Cas. You put on your golden cavalier mask and refuse to live in the real world and set us all impossible standards. We can’t do this right without playing a little hard ball. He’ll eat us for lunch.”
“I said, yes alpha,” Neil shot back testily.  ‘God.  Alphas’, thought Dean.
“The point is,” Cas sighed and straightened. “We are each of us scarred from our upbringing. We cannot change our past. But we can filter through what we experienced and reject for our future what hurt us back then. Even the most damaging past may have had moments of light. I refuse to mimic my childhood, Michael, but the house itself isn’t the problem. I plan to fill that great house with light and love, song and laughter, tears and arguing. We won’t always get along, but we will be
“Mm-hm,” Dean agreed. “I’m with you there. Sure wish I could go play with my brats instead. But I’m stuck here. You won’t keep me company?”
“One last thing, Hey! Listen up!  Ever notice that when we write, we always capitalize ‘Omega’ and only ‘alpha’ when referring to a Pack Alpha, even when it’s an honorific on someone’s name?”
Was that a Grammy nomination that slid by with barely a mention?  Why, yes.  Yes, it was.  Nicholas is nominated again for Best Musical Theater Album, and since our Ozzie is a co-composer, she's up to share it if it wins.  Tony nominations don't happen until April, so we won't know what's going to happen there for a bit.  April's big show anthem didn't win a nomination for the Grammy's, but there's still hope.  It's eligible for a Tony.
Gabriel felt his little brother’s eyes on him, and he quietly lifted his wine glass in a subtle salute that Castiel returned.
“I’m not talking about your punishment, and you know it,” he told her.  “You’re damn right you deserved whatever he gave you.  I’m talking about the rest of it.  What have you two been talking about?”  Dean reached out to her as the pair approached.  She transferred her weight from the handrail to her mate-in-law’s strong grip.
They left Sam alone.  By explicit directive, Sam’s core mission to guide Sarah’s perceptions was one they were not permitted to impinge upon.  He was engaged in a higher calling at the moment than any one fire that required dousing…although…there were times…Dean wondered just what color Sarah’s perceptions might take on if she saw Sam really work a room.  She had been nearly catatonic after Sam’s dominance display at Gabe’s wedding party, frozen in place a mere eight feet from the table Sam chose and unable to tear her eyes off of his aggressive assertion.  She hadn’t talked about it yet, not to Dean’s knowledge.  But she showed up to The Facility the next day.  That was something.
“Sir, listen.  You can’t let him think it’s all his fault.  Once he finds out that his little caper cost us fourteen others, he’s gonna shit himself.  If you add another layer on top of that and make him think it’s his fault, it will break him again.  Please, be careful, alpha.  Please.  I know you’re mad, but this is on us more than it is Gabe.  We should have predicted he’d pull a stunt like this sooner or later, and he didn’t know.”
Cas looked at him and sighed. “Thanks for driving me home.”
“Yeah, I do,” Dean muttered with a pat to Bobby’s knee.  He stood up and moved his hand to Bobby’s shoulder.  The old alpha clutched Dean’s hand like a lifeline.
She stared at him a little longer.  He blinked back.
Cas hummed, and that was the final straw. Dean locked up, his hips lifted off the bed, his ass clenched hard onto his husband’s finger, and he filled Castiel’s mouth with his come. Cas swallowed it as it came, expertly protecting himself from choking or gagging, massaging Dean through the pulses of pleasure, holding him until his hips collapsed back in exhaustion. Cas slipped his finger carefully out, licked Dean’s cock clean as he pulled off. He stretched out on his side beside the puddle of a man he’d just brought to ecstasy, and he kissed Dean’s jaw.
The Alpha stood up and stepped around his desk. Billie stood too, but it might have been purely from shock. Jonathon’s mouth fell slack. Cas bracketed Billie with a hand on each shoulder, squaring her up before him, and he smiled gamely. “You wanted a chance to put your spin on the company’s direction, Sparky. Here’s your chance. Go get ‘em, kiddo. I’ll be back in a bit. I expect to be wowed by your brilliance. Show me I was right to pick you for the front spot.” He patted her a couple of times on the upper arm, squeezed it, and then turned and gestured to Michael to lead the way.
“Cas,” Benny started, but then he faltered. Everyone seemed to know he was poised to state something heavy, and they all fell still. Gabriel caught the ball and held it. Castiel breathed into Dean’s neck.
Kali settled for backing out without a word, popping a terse text into his phone, and making herself scarce.
He made it with three minutes to spare and a sweat-soaked body.  Sam huffed his breath back down.  He doused his face with water in the restroom and took a chair in the back corner as far from the majority of students as he could get.  It was a small class.  They had room to avoid him.  Most of them chose to do so.
can be a childish asshole? He’s that in spades and whole buttload more.”
“Uh, I couldn’t remember which pair was yours. We wear the same brand. Do you get the gray ones? Are you mad?” Dean’s green eyes peered at him through long, hopeful lashes.
“I really do.  I like them both a lot.  They’re good people; easy to like.”  Michael emerged from the laundry room behind the kitchen.  He stopped by the Butler’s pantry to grab a beer for his sister.
“Can I ask why?”  She broke the silence.  “Why not try a route that doesn’t rely on mother nature’s good will?  It was good enough for Jess and Sam.  Your brother can pull strings and have …”
Bobby took it in for a minute, then he smiled warmly at Sam.  “Of course.  I understand.  I’ll talk it over with Lafitte, and we’ll figure something out.  You mentioned anything to him about Cole yet?”  Sam shook his head.
“I hear you, Michael,” she said patiently.  “You’re right that you don’t fit the molds that we understand, but can you honestly tell me that you believe yourself to be alpha?  Not just that you detest being Omega, but that you are an alpha trapped in the wrong body.”
“Good grief,” Dean grumbled. “Somebody owes me a blowjob.”
“Boy, I am an
“Did you see anyone with her, officer?” the alpha asked him suddenly, and he jumped again.
“It does to me,” answered Castiel firmly.  “Dean earned this paddling because he misbehaved at work.  Sam spanked him in a professional capacity.  It could’ve been any E.O. onsite who delivered it.  I only chose Sam because he was close at hand when I headed back this way.”  Sam looked at the floor and blushed.  Michael wondered if he was embarrassed to have paddled his brother.  He hadn’t seemed so at the time, but he was clearly sheepish now.
“Was that necessary, Dean?” asked Cas as he held the door for Dean and handed him his keys.
Cas chuckled into his mate’s hairline. Dean had a point. The chairs weren’t balanced well for the kind of motion required for where Cas’ mind was heading.
“Dean, just because you don’t see the inherent danger in having alcohol and Ozzies at the same party doesn’t mean there isn’t danger,” Michael lectured.
“Fuck,” whispered Michael who had little choice but to follow him. Dean was dropping fast. Michael reached around him and adjusted the knobs on both sprayers to a reasonable temperature and turned Dean so that the cold water didn’t hit him directly. He wrapped his arms around his mate from behind and covered his broad back with his body.
Michael chuckled and kissed Dean’s lips sweetly.  “That’s the plan.  We’ve got reservations all set up for a full month as a foursome.  Of course, the two of you get the lion’s share of alone time, just like you and I did after we Mated.  But can you really envision Castiel leaving his Mate for a month?  It’s their last frolic before pups, too, man.  If you don’t think he’s planning to make the most of our last months of freedom, you may not know the man at all.”
Dean returned, pale and nervous.  Missouri handed him a pair of gloves.  Michael cried out and clenched down.  Everyone seemed to move in as one, like a huge animal expelling a breath.  Dean got his gloves on and focused in where Missouri directed him.  She pushed him onto the stool, and she guided his hands toward Michael’s inner thighs.
“Calm yourself, Omega. You need that energy focused, not shooting out into the room to dissipate where it can’t do you any good. If it makes you feel any better, everything you feel, she feels too. At least you get to choose the time and place. She’s at your mercy right now, sweetie.”
“And as for schmoozing scumballs,” Cas went on, turning his attention to his mate.  “That’s not something I can watch either.  So we won’t be doing any of that, will we, kitten?”
No quarter given.
“Uh, yeah. Sorry, Boss.”  Bobby didn’t look sorry, and Castiel suspected he’d been left out on purpose.  He wondered if Dean or Benny knew.  Bobby turned to Chuck.  “Interesting things you hear when you call up random senators every now and then just to chat, just doin’ your civic duty and staying informed.  Seems like Livestone really wants to support the Lupin cause; wants to very badly.  In a completely different and unrelated side note, Senator Livestone is up for re-election this year.  Also, on a third completely unrelated vein, Senator Livestone’s campaign believes he would have a very good shot of winning the election if it could raise, oh, maybe about $5 million by the end of the month.”
Dean thought it over. “She may need to stay here for a few weeks.”
“You saw her wolf?  Like, really, truly
“Whoa, fellas. Here’s the deal. You’re both right, and you’re both wrong if you ask me, but you’re also both full-grown adults, and I’m not getting in the middle of this. Figure it out. If I do have to get in the middle here, neither of you is going to like how it comes out. All I’m going to say on the matter is that bribery is never a good idea, but if we can’t trust a mate who’s one of the leading authorities on Omegas to navigate this boy’s designations, I don’t know who would be better.”
“Love you, too, Alpha,” said Dean sleepily, comforted.  Satisfied.
“Daddy!” Kat called as she worked her way down the stairs holding tightly to Kate’s hand.
“Yeah, yeah,” Gabe grumbled.  “I get it.  Can we move it along please?  I’m starving.”
“If you don’t have time, don’t bid,” Cas replied. “I will see you at one-thirty. On the dot. Don’t test me, Dean.” Cas stood up and collected his tray to head back to work.
“STOP IT! Get up! What the fuck are you doing?!”
Benny landed a couple of good blows to Ketch’s jaw once he managed to roll him onto his back, but the beta only grimaced and shifted, setting them to tumbling again, and Benny took a stiffened palm to the jaw as they rolled. He shook it off, working his lower legs around Ketch’s trying to trap his legs in a vice grip. Jack kept the tree between him and the increasingly sweaty men rolling around in the dust. They were both covered in dirt in no time, and both had blood flowing from their faces, Ketch from his nose, and Benny from a split lip. A dust cloud began to rise around them, stagnant in the still air, renewed constantly by the scrabble of arms, backs, and feet that kicked and dug in.
“No? Why did you leave the swats to Michael just now? Why not do it yourself? Did that have anything to do with what happened last time you spanked me? Are you telling me you didn’t hurt me on purpose then?”
“I love you, Cas. I’m sorry I scare you. I’m trying. God, I’m trying so hard, but you just can’t see it.” Dean whispered into his ear, breathless.
“No, sir.”
“Not last night, no.  It wasn’t the best night’s sleep I ever had.”  Michael sat very still and let Cas feel the sides of his throat and peer into his mouth.  April knelt at Castiel’s side, and Dean took the chair arm.  Dean let Cas look Michael over, but when his fingers began pressing into the flesh around Michael’s Mating-scars, he said, “He’s not due for a physical, Alpha.  It was just a bout of nausea.  He’s knocked up.  It comes with the territory.”
“The nightmare.”
“I didn’t see anything.  I looked through the drawers.  Give me a minute, Gabe, I’ll call Fred.”
“See, what we have here is a prime example of upbringing gone wrong,” Monroe drawled into the lectern as Michael bore down on him, enraged.  Michael reached him before any of the guards caught up and punched him full across the face.  The Alpha spun backward and clutched his broken nose, stunned to find that an Omega could even launch such an attack in the first place, much less see it through.  The crowd surged again, many of them scaling the wall and rushing Michael and April’s position.
Cas tossed the paddle onto the floor and pulled out of Dean’s mouth.  He sank down onto his knees in the mess and kissed Dean hard, smearing the drool on his chin and nearly weeping in joy.  Dean was lax, kissing back lazily.
“Shoot.”
“He’s modelling with Sam,” Meg told him.
“Go change, Dean.  Yours is fine.  Leave it with me and get out of here and let me work.”
“You, um, you…I thought you were gonna take a swing, Sammy.  I don’t get it.”  Dean looked back at his brother and wished he hadn’t.  Sam’s eyes were dark with determination and anger.  His cheeks were flushed around the scratches that ran down both sides, one blood-lined scrape starting perilously close to Sam’s eye.
“I keep an eye on my alphas, Cas,” the mentor reminded him evenly.
“One.”  Dean held up a finger in Castiel’s face.  “Michael’s already seen to my work hours problem.  He added an extension to the ‘No fucking at work except for testing’ rule and now he’s cut me off completely: no fucking at work, period.  If I don’t do any Kellers, and the board approves a research assistant for my team, that frees up a huge amount of time for me to be there for my pups.
“Michael…”  Castiel’s voice grated with his arousal, like crazed glass. He snaked his fingers into Dean’s short hair, caught enough of it between his fingers to give him leverage, and pulled Dean down onto his length until Dean had to open his throat and concentrate on suppressing his gag reflex. “Have you dealt with Gabriel?”
“Goddamnit,” Billie groused, shaking her head in bafflement at her own lack of self-governance. She extricated herself, climbed to her feet, straightened her suit, rubbed her temples, and blew out a long exhale. Mating? Damnit, that was for allo-wolves. She’d spent decades insisting there was no inherent compulsion for wolves to pair up. And she still believed that. There were other ways to connect, platonic ways. Packs could cleave in hierarchies built around domestic consolidation. They could. She’d been testing options in the research wing for ages. And now?
“You heard the lady,” said Cas jovially.  “Come and have a meal on us.  It’s a party.  My brother got married today.”
“Michael, I need you dressed,” Kali said, and Michael checked the clock with a curse.  The photographer was due any minute for prenuptial shots.  Getting dressed was easy for Michael.  Already nude to prevent any elastic strap lines on his body, all he had to do was slip the tunic over his head and let Kali tie it at his waist.
“Gross!  Winchester, you need a fucking straightjacket!  And a babysitter!  God!”
want it. Not me. And the thing you’re so angry about is that you keep telling me to take the reins and BE Alpha, but what you really want is for me to do it the way
“Yeah?”
“All right, folks,” he said. “We have much to celebrate. This is a very good day in the Winchester Pack, but it is also a worknight and our newest Ozzie will need focused attention very soon, so let’s get down to business. Here is how tonight’s events will go. We are going to be striking two birds with one stone, so to speak. Several of you have approached me about the idea of creating a pathway to challenge one another for rank within the Pack. I have given the matter a great deal of thought, and while there are concerns of which we must be cognizant, I am convinced that, if done with care, rank challenges can be good for the health of our Pack as a whole. Therefore, I have decided to allow occasional, controlled challenge events under monitored conditions. Does this pronouncement come as a surprise to anyone?”
Pain flitted across his brow at the memory. “It was too risky. We didn’t have training classes back then. We were on our own, and my family taught me that we were all just like the Primates. Alphas got to make the rules, but that was more for decorum than for any biological need. I knew they were wrong, but I didn’t have anyone to discuss it with. I met a woman in my Junior year. She was an alpha-Sub. She taught me a lot, and she was willing to take it really slowly for me.” He chuckled to himself in a self-deprecating way. “I had a lot to learn, but I was a very willing student. Back then, I didn’t really understand limits or issues of consent, and I overstepped a lot of boundaries even after I should’ve known better, but Marie was patient with me. She made good use of safewords, and that’s one thing I understood. She was really open to talk things over afterward too. She taught me so much. But she wasn’t a masochist, and I need that in a partner. We weren’t a good fit, long term. Still, I don’t know if I would be who I am if it hadn’t been for her.”
Another round of ‘Water the Subs’ kicked off just before they really got situated, and Dean found himself on his knees several yards away from Cas.  Not one to be stymied, he knee-walked the distance and opened his mouth like a baby bird to Castiel’s laughing.  Cas had to stifle his laugh so he could perform his portion of the ritual.  He pulled it together, and then nearly choked as April slid from halfway across the room and jostled Dean in her enthusiasm to line up for him too.
“Ugh!” Cas rebelled. “What horrifying wording. Take that back this instant!”
He grinned.  She tried to hide the sadness in her eyes when she touched his face, but she wasn’t completely successful.
“Sir…”
“No, Sir,” Sarah managed weakly with a glance at Kali.
April straightened between his knees.  She could read him well, and she shifted tone to match his relief.  “But I like this robe, Sir.  I didn’t want the front panel spattered with blood if you went for Michael’s jugular.  And, you know, two men going at it like that is gross.  The smell alone.  All that masculine grunting.  I didn’t want to have to watch that.”
***Warnings for excess violence.
She picked up her desk phone and speed-dialed Benny.
“But, Alpha.”  The adrenalin hit Michael upside the head, and he began to shiver.  “He’s…he’s massive.  I’ve never seen power like that, but you…you’re even stronger.  You beat him.  I don’t understand.  Why do you hide all of that?”
Dean laughed, but Castiel answered seriously. “It’s an early response to the pregnancy hormones,” he told Michael. The uterus will expand and begin to force its way above your intestines. Before it makes space for itself, it can press against your spine enough to cause pain or even damage. One of the earliest changes a pregnant Omega usually notices is a gathering of fluids around his hips and across his lower back. The fluids will be replaced by fat deposits over the next few weeks, creating a cushion between the uterus and the spine, like an airbag in a car.”
“No, we can’t make assumptions. We need to prove it. This isn’t proof, Kevin.”
April looked rapidly between her mate’s weary eyes and Michael’s, wide and frozen where he still squatted on the floor.  “I…I would like a chance to spend a round with Michael.  If…Michael, do you…?  Do you want to?”  Her words were careful, but the spark of arousal the Alpha felt from her body cinched it.  She needed a turn with the Omega, and by the look on Michael’s face, he did too.  Michael could smell her Heat scent as easily as an alpha would do.
Castiel’s playfulness evaporated. He stood abruptly, overbalancing Dean, leaving him to catch himself.
“Are you disappointed about that?”
She smiled all of her compassion into the sunbeam.  She chuckled softly.  “I told you.  I see you, Michael.  I don’t know if it’s a curse or a gift, but I can see your struggles like colors in a painting.  My Omega sees things most people can’t, and then my mind figures out what it means, I guess.  I don’t know how to explain it.  I used to think everyone could do it, but they can’t.  It’s an Omega thing, and it’s not all Omegas even, just a few.”
“Thought I’d find you here,” said Ellen sidling up to Cas at the bar.  “What are we drinking?  Looks like vodka.”  She lifted his glass and sniffed it.
to wade in there alone!”
“Woo, brother, calm down a little.  You breathing?  Yeah, I got it.  It’s right here.”  Benny produced the tiny black velvet-covered box and handed it to Cas to check.  “Give it back when you’ve checked it for scratches.  Kali made me swear not to put it in your hands before Pastor Jim tells me to.”
“It’s a standard trope, boss. It’s probably leaked to the satellites, but I don’t anticipate wider spread. If you word that memo well, it’ll probably leak to the press, so keep his name out of it directly.”
“Mother, it is my honor, although I know that you already know this…it is my honor to announce that Dean and I are engaged to be married this September.”
“Yeah,” he whispered.
Dean chuckled, crossed his arms beneath his cheek, and spread his feet apart in case Cas was more than talk.  Cas kissed along the line of his shoulder and spent a little extra time tonguing the healing wound of his bite.  “Michael’s is definitely scarring, Dean,” he observed, lifting his head to look across Dean’s back – his gorgeously muscled back – to check out the scar on Dean’s right shoulder near his neck.  The wound had healed, but a staccato series of white Morse dots and dashes showed where his teeth had overlapped one another in sequential episodes.  It appeared that the more Michael reiterated his Claim, the more pronounced the scars would become.
“It’s fine!” Kathleen put in, an attempt to break the tension between two alphas who both felt ownership over the young lady sipping her tea.  “We understand you’re both busy.  You just drop on in whenever you can.  Right, Reg?”
Cas snapped too.
Sitting through the awards ceremony and after-party weren’t going to be comfortable.
Cas chuckled.  “We can’t always take the easy way out, love.  We both needed to be heard, not just me.  If we’d let our wolves take it, you wouldn’t have had a chance to speak your piece.  My wolf would have come in heavy-handed and forced you to roll and apologize, and I never would have understood.  I set you up to fail by not covering this months ago.  I assumed you knew where our roleplays ended and my genuine incapacity to share you picked up.  Dean, baby, God, that’s never really been a roleplay.  You’re right that I need to feel in control of who touches you.  I’m praying you can live with that, because I can’t change it.”
She collapsed against the hold of her arms and meagered a defeated, miserable cry of disappointment.  Somehow, even though he’d never once allowed it when he meant not to, she always held out hope that she might get to come, if she could just sneak it in before he found his.  Surely, there would be a moment or two just before he toppled that he would lose focus enough that if she could just… There was a reason she worked so hard on orgasm control.  If she could learn to reach that magical moment the instant she felt his focus waver, she could win something for herself that he didn’t intend to allow her.
“I seriously, seriously don’t wanna talk about this with you right now.  Or ever.  With anyone.
“You’re a pig, Joe,” she shouted back. “Don’t you have a traffic stop to monitor? I’d hate to think some suburban housewife might sneak past you goin’ twenty-seven in a twenty-five.”
of the punishment, not in spite of it.”
Dean pushed Michael’s damp hair off his forehead, trying to remember what the question had been.  Oh, right.  “Feel it in my head.  Kinda deep behind my sinuses and then also way deep in my prostate.  …and everywhere.”
“Oh, we are.  We’re going to talk first.  First?  Before what?  Before you flay me for infidelity?  I didn’t fucking cheat on you, C.J.”
He left his cheek propped on his palm but looked up at her and sighed.  “I’m not going to talk about that, Ellen.  I told you.  It’s private.”
Dean quivered. His breath shook, but still he held. Behind Cas, Kali shepherded the Ozzies and pups into the hallway and out of sight, dragging Gabriel with her. Cas watched their progress out of his peripheral vision with his head cocked at an oblique, never quite taking his eyes off his Sub.
“Actually,” continued Charlie, oblivious.  “The fun part is said to be the Mating, but this part is good too.  I’ve got the scents loaded, and I can start them whenever you’re ready.  I’ve got three for each of you.  Who wants to go first?”
Cas chuckled darkly. He had a few ideas, and the image of Dean as center ring of the show was enough to make Cas’ wolf sit up and pay attention. “I would like that, Dean. I would like that very much. We’ll talk it out after you both have a little time to sleep this off. I have some reservations though. We need to be careful. It would probably be best if the two of you work through your ideas on your own before we combine rosters.”
What the fuck, Winchester?”
“Engaged, at this point.  Not married yet.  You don’t owe me an apology, Anna.  You were excited.  It’s understandable, and you didn’t know.” Cas sipped his tea.  “Is that their Mating log?” He indicated the folder with a jut from his chin.  She handed it to him, and he flipped it open.
“I don’t know, Dean.  He says he wants us to be straight with him.  Pamela kicked me in the nads for making shit more complicated for him than it has to be.  I’m so fucking confused.”
“And…?”
“Gordon’s already signed a contract to turn the basement cells into dorm space for real.  He’s turning the whole building legit and moving the trafficking elsewhere.  I don’t have any idea where he’s taking them now.  We have to start over.”
Bobby sipped Scotch and watched him.
“Ah. Yeah. That’d do it,” she agreed. They sat in silence for a few minutes, enjoying the lack of tension in the room. “Do you know anything about babies, Michael?” she asked suddenly, as if the question had been wanting to burst out.
to be locked out.
“He wasn’t mine. I suggested it, even offered to go with him, but he wasn’t ready. As much as I love him—and I always have—he wasn’t mine.”
“None of your business, Alpha,” Dean whispered. “They’re both un-Mated grownups, and they both know their own minds.”
“When that girl asked you if you’d rather top or bottom,” Sam replied, fixing his too-astute eye on his brother’s face. “You said you switch it up depending on who you’re with, even in your free time.” He paused a beat, then continued when Dean didn’t respond. “Dean, when was the last time you were with someone new in your free time? Never, right? Not since college? Dude, I know you. You’re so monogamous, you put fifty-year-old Baptists to shame. And yeah right, as if Castiel would
Ok, I'm a liar.  I couldn't stop myself from pounding out one more chapter.  But it's Sunday night and that means early bedtime, up and off to work tomorrow.  Someone has to pay for Social Security, right?
“That’s not helping kill his boner, trainee,” Jody commented. “He’s developing a crush on you, and you’re feeding his medical kink. You need to disengage and get the job done. We’re going to have to use ice.”
“Who’zit?” asked Dean sleepily.
“I…What dedication?”  Michael looked up at Dean and then across at Cas and April, at Chuck.  He felt a blush rise from the back of his neck to cover his cheeks, turning them ruddy in the sunlight streaming through the front windows.
He got stuck in one room.  It occurred to Dean, as it usually did at some point along the way during a good scene, that discussing a scene and planning it prior to submitting defied the concept that he was supplanting his own will at all.  If his Dominant gave him what he asked for, how was that submission to the will of another?  And in that thought came the natural follow-up – what would he do if his Dom took Dean’s gift of submission and turned it into something very, very real, taking rather than giving, only for his own pleasure and refusing Dean any for himself?  Dean shivered at the thought.  Chill bumps ran up his spine and spread out over the top of his head.  He longed to know what that would feel like in a wider context.  Today would come close.  Certainly, there was to be a touch of humiliation to it, a distance that wasn’t normally part of Michael’s repertoire.  But Dean was certain that in the end, Michael’s touch would be a giving one, not a take.  If Dean followed the script, he would be rewarded as he’d said he wanted.
“You mean the metal dildo-chair?”
“Aaarghh!  F…..uuuuuu….ckk!!” Ellen clenched everything she owned and tried to funnel it all through her channel.
“What does your Omega think?” asked Castiel, cryptically.
His voice resounded, and his eyes flashed.
“Not a chance,” Michael parried.
“FOUR!”
“Have you selected a safeword yet, Dean?”
Benny left in a hurry, and Dean followed him slowly enough to appear headed toward his own funeral.  Bobby stopped him in the doorway.
“Did you bring me here so you could plant your flag in my chest and chant a victory song over my conquered body?” she asked him pointedly.
Fred smiled kindly at him.  “I have known Castiel for his entire life, Dean.  I firmly believe that if anyone alive can achieve what you and he are attempting, it’s you and he.  Right now is the time for faith and a firm stand.  If I may offer one piece of advice, do not waver in holding him to his ideals.  He has, if I remember correctly, held you to yours when your vision became clouded by emotion.  I believe you have been watching for an opportunity to return the favor.  Sir, that opportunity has arrived.  He needs you.  He is close to breaking irreparably, and that would be catastrophic to the entire world.  But you are equal to this challenge.  Faith, alpha.  Faith and a stand.”
“Really, Gabe?  Not even a robe?”
Cain shifted his stance, balancing on the balls of his feet, and then put his hips into his swing, landing a hard stripe at the top of her thighs. She screamed and bent her knees. She covered her head with both hands and rocked in misery, going slack over the couch.
“Just be grateful we have Michael, so you don’t have to do it,” Dean joshed. “The next five hours of sitting and listening to speech after speech is going to be awful. At least here we get food and drink and dancing. Wanna dance?”
“We can schedule time in the Processing room for Michael’s Claim.  It may take some careful staging and a professional manager.”
Alex drank cow’s milk from a sippy cup while the other three drained a bottle each of pumped milk.  April’s lactation couldn’t begin to keep up with the needs of her three pups.  No one had expected her to.  In the wild packs, when one Omega gave birth to a larger litter than she could feed by herself, their nutritional needs were spread among the rest of the Pup-bearing mothers.  The lowest ranked Omegas, once stimulated to lactate after bearing their own first pups, could expect to be called upon to nurse any pups in the Pack for as long as their milk supply held out.  Some of them didn’t stop nursing pups for decades.  It was often a point of pride for Omega mothers, proving their fertility and their sustainable worth in a tangible way and giving them an excuse to wallow in the care of others as the Pack doted on them and fed them inexhaustible quantities of nutritious foods.
Cas caught and held Gabe’s eye again. The level of pain in the Omega’s expression worried Castiel. His big brother was feeling his mother’s condition on a far more personal level than Cas would have expected. “If she’s permanently cut herself off from her beta though, she will lose her sanity. There’s not much anyone can do if that’s the case but make her comfortable and keep her safe. An adult Lupin is an alpha, beta, or Omega above all other aspects of self.
Cas sat back on his heels and pulled Dean up chest to chest with him.  “Sit down on me, Pet.  Let me guide you.  Yep, that’s it.  Lower right down.  You’re ready, aren’t you?  All the way down, Dean.”  Cas supported Dean’s thighs as Dean let his body impale itself on Castiel’s stiff cock.  The feeling was indescribable.  He felt so full, so wet, split right in two, stretched impossibly wide, and he groaned in both pain and pleasure, his prostate lighting up and his rim hot and burning hotter by the inch.
“You’re tilting at windmills, C.J.” Dean told him.  “It’s all in your head.  We can’t stop anyone from loving anyone.  You know that.  You tried as hard as I did to kill it between us, and it just wouldn’t die.”
“It’s not that I don’t wanna, Michael. It’s just too embarrassing to talk about.”
“Up, virgin!” directed Missy at his shoulder. “Break time. Go get some air. Walk around. Eat something. Refill your cup. Don’t go near the east wing. You’ll carry the scent with you. There’s a snack bar at the end of the hall, and you can go outside through the double doors to your left. Get out of here. Don’t come back for thirty minutes.”
Oh well.  Whatevs.  Love to you all.
“Understood.  That’s fair.  But talk to Dean.  You may find that he’s game to try it.  Just don’t try to get a rational opinion from him if he’s not balanced.”
“No spanking,” Dean reminded him. Castiel’s blackout still had a couple of weeks of healing time before he would lift it and open the doors to allow full access to Dean’s beautiful capacity for bruising again. “And Michael, if we ask for an Alpha, we’re going to get an Alpha. You get that, right? This isn’t going to be like the time he let you direct. He’s going to barrel in here with all the scent of Rut and Heat and everything that goes with it, and he’s going to let the big guy off leash. Are you certain you’re ready for that? Please don’t do this just because you can feel what I’m craving. You don’t owe me anything. He’s not going to let you control it, so you need to be okay with that from the jump.”
Dean smirked.  “I’ll race you, Alpha,” he goaded, thrusting harder into his mate, and feeling Michael shut his eyes tight at the pleasure.  Dean rolled his hips deeply and nailed his prostate, then he did it again.
Cas sighed expansively and shook his head. “Consider it a fee of admission to my Pack. We all pay dues, Omega, in one form or another. You know me well enough by now to have seen under the curtain. No one close to me is exempt, and I’m not going to pretend otherwise just to assuage your prickly sense of righteousness. People like us make our own rules. You don’t have to like it. I don’t require your approval. I am Alpha, and I am not shy about taking what is mine to take. If you find you cannot live with it, you know where the door is.”
Michael whined, and his body responded.  Dean smelled slick even before he felt Michael’s penis harden.  “Yeah, you are, aren’t you?” he teased, tightening his fist a bit.  “You want it bad, don’t you, Omega?”
“Nah, that’s not true,” said Meg. “Maybe the lack of representation bites, but she’s not the first author to casually forget we exist. She won’t be the last. What she
“He’s erect, Jody!” Michael pointed pointlessly. “I can’t hit the bladder with him like this.”
Michael brushed the concern off. “Those are their words, Dean, not mine. I’m not going to follow someone else’s rules about what I like and don’t like. I never said I couldn’t share control. That was Pam. The thing is, I’m so fucking curious what it’ll be like to play with Castiel that it’s beginning to be an obsession. If not while I’m in Heat, then when? Come on, alpha. Take a chance. Loosen up a little. It’s just sex. I wanna play. Get me toys!”
Untangling themselves, the two Omegas ended up side-by-side, both bloody and filthy, Gabriel panting and sweaty, and Michael wide-eyed with shock.
“Oh, fuck!  Sir, I’m close.  What do I do?  Should I…?  I wanna come!  FUCK!”  Dean ground down, grinding his sore, hot ass in a circle over the bulge in Cas’ cock, searching for just the right pressure against his prostate.  The blue was so intense and even as he watched, entranced, a bit of a ring of red began to emerge around the edges in Castiel’s eyes.  Dean stared hard, lost inside himself and in that endless blue together at the same time.  Dean could see into Castiel’s need.  He realized in a flash that the man was right there with him.  Dean had been working hard to be good for Castiel without ever quite internalizing that his Dom wanted those things from Dean to feed them both.
“There you go,” purred Sam’s wolf. “Good girl.” His grip across her throat eased. “On your knees.”
“Your mother is watching.”
Dean sighed.  “Nuh-uh, not unless you want to get a good look at the masticated version.”
Charlie’s ears turned bright red, followed by the rest of her face, her neck, even the backs of her hands pinked up where they clasped her mug.  She floundered for a response, and Meg blew out a heavy breath.
“You’re being stubborn, Dean,” Michael whispered to him. “Everyone’s on board but you. Don’t make me a point of contention just to make a point. I thought you wanted to help me.”
“Fred! Oh, thank god! Are you back? Are you better?” Gabe abandoned the mountain of soiled clothing at his feet to launch himself at the butler in relief. “I missed you so much! Cas made me be you, but I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing and the whole house is upside down!”
“Fred’s an employee,” Sam explained, still leaning on the drink cart with both arms braced.  He looked to be casually leaning, but the tension in his lower arms spoke of a tight grip and a carefully postured stance.  “He has full say in what he does or doesn’t want to do for us outside of his usual duties.  It’s not our right to assign him something like this without asking him.”
“God, Dean, did you ask her to tell you that?”
“Shh,” Michael shushed.  “Just let it settle, baby.  You’ve been holding all of us up for ages now, and you need a break.  I’ve got you.”
“Yes, Sir,” replied Dean.
“Don’t worry, Mr. Creosote, it’s just a wafer-thin mint.”  Dean was reading his mind, apparently.
“So,” Michael blinked and bit his lip. “You’re scening with Castiel tonight?”
Dean chuckled and slid to his knees between Castiel’s. “That’s all it is,” he whispered. “You know, buying tickets to her rallies means you’re contributing to her campaign no matter whose ass fills the seats, right? Will you please fuck me now before you fly off and get yourself thrown into Federal prison?”
injured, and he’s not going to punish you until you’re healed.  You’ve got a little time.”
“There now.  That’s all I wanted to say,” Michael chirped happily.  “I feel so much better for getting that off my chest.  Thank you for talking it through with me, Dean.  I believe I’m ready to eat dinner now.  You coming?  No?  Not yet?”  Michael broke a little at his own pun, smiling in spite of himself, but he heeled backward toward the door.
“It won’t take me long now, Alpha.  I got all the holes dug.  From here, it’s just a matter of stringing up the fence.  Done in a jiffy.  I’ll put in the door tomorrow though.  It’s gonna be noisy.  I need light, too.”
“No, two clients checking in. Betas. Both locals, but only one a regular.”
“And where did you get ‘Emma’?  That’s not a family name that I know of.”
“Nope,” said Dean, smacking his lips.
Michael appeared at last and stopped just inside the door, taking in his Submissive.  Dean’s body was a beautiful sculpture, folded perfectly in place just for him, glowing in the afternoon sunlight that painted the lines of his body perfectly.  The Sub didn’t raise his head or even flick his eyes toward his Dom.  He was relaxed and at rest, deferential, just as Michael had asked him to be.
Dean chuckled and passed between the two Omegas on his way toward the hall. “Come on, Gabe. Now’s not the time to poke at the beast unless you wanna sing falsetto.”
April squealed and grabbed the guitar from where it rested in the corner, dancing along behind as Dean led Castiel back down to the music room and settled him on the couch. He pulled a smaller chair into the bend of the piano, oblique to the audience of two. Michael stood behind the couch.
“We’ve got an Omega-Sub.  Will she work?  Will she be safe in there?”
“Yeah, I do!  But he doesn’t.”  Dean laughed.  “You’re a puzzle to him from every direction, and it’s killing him.”
“Oh, good grief!” sputtered April.  She lunged forward and pulled Nate into a tight hug that he didn’t return.  His terrified eyes never left Castiel’s.  Cas didn’t thaw.  He glared.
“So you
Bobby put a hand on his shoulder as they filed out of the room.  “Come with me, Cas.  We’re going for a walk.”
“Did you see Henrickson’s face after Cas got through with him?” he looked across and challenged Sam.  “Pretty damned destructive if you ask me.”
“What’s this?” Michael’s sister asked, nodding to where the two Omegas’ hands were still linked together.
“We’re not IN a poly relationship, C.J.  That’s the whole point!”
He shrugged her off.  “I go where you go, Alpha,” he said to Cas.
“It matters little how well-suited they are, Meg.  Sam’s Mated, and that means everything to him.  He loves Jess.  They have as strong a chance as any mates to build a life together.  They have pups to raise.  His eyes aren’t going to go wandering off into a whole different species just because she’s interesting.”
“Harder, alpha,” Michael responded. “Fuck me harder.”
“I need to scent you as part of my evaluation,” Pam told her. “I apologize for the intrusion. I won’t touch you. You have my word.”
Gabe looked at Dean. Dean looked guilty.
Billie snarled. She was out of her chair in a blink, one hand wrenching Helene’s head back by her hair and the other arm around the small of her back, holding her tightly. “Don’t,” she warned. Words with sharp edges were slicing far too close to ones she’d given up imagining.
“What do you mean he’s out of town?! Do you know how far I’ve traveled into the fucking heartland of this god-forsaken country just to find out he’s not even in the same fucking state?! Where is he?!” Crowley’s tantrum bounced off the high ceiling and startled the waiting clients. Several of them backed up and took seats closer to the door with wide eyes.
At last, the Alpha took two steps toward and around him and guided his body to the ground, like a puppet master molding a figure into place.  Michael was placed flat on his back.  His eyes turned golden as the Alpha lifted the Omega’s legs slowly into place over his shoulders.  He was exposed and indefensible, and he shivered.
“It’s just…I mean…eww!  What the hell?”  Dean was still complaining, but attempting to cast a playful light over it.  His kneejerk reaction to the intensity of Castiel’s lust and April’s – well, April’s body’s reaction – was pulling him into a swift tantrum, and there were going to be follow up conversations about it, he had no doubt, but one Godforsaken thing at a time.  If Dean could cut the spiral down into his Tertiary off at the knees by playing it up into light banter, it was worth a try.
“Asshole,” she muttered affectionately. She pretended to find interest in an argument some distance down the hall, but there was nothing to the exchange but volume. It was over too quickly to be worth her attention. “So, what’d he say?” She kept her eyes on the traffic, watching her people like a junior high hall monitor.
“Let’s show Castiel first,” Michael mumbled. “Then we’ll redo it.”
“Dad was a bit of a prick, Dean. I think we can raise pups without putting them through some of the things Dad taught us.” Sam let him go at the stairs, but Dean caught his brother’s arm and reeled him in for a hug. Thumping Dean’s back, Sam said, “I know, man. Let it go. We’re okay. I forgive you.” He handed Dean his robe and touched his shoulder.
April’s eyes locked with her mate’s, awash in fear and uncertainty. For all he said the words she’d barely dared to hope for, New York would be a test of his resolve and his commitment. She could feel that he loved and cherished her. Did he love her enough to gently nudge her away from him and out into the cold frightening world, trusting in the people he’d surrounded her with to keep up with everything he was setting aside? Could they both overcome the pull to stay close to each other? Could they stretch the elastic cord between them until it pulsated with tension and then hold there, each in their own sphere until need and obligation snapped them back together for a mutually powerful release, only to pull apart again?
Puffy, swollen, a bit inverted, and extremely loose, Dean’s entrance was channel-like in its softness, in its welcome.  It wept a continuous flow of slick from the deeply penetrating push of Castiel’s lube-coated fist previously.  All three of them felt the guilty desperation in the Alpha’s dark psyche to convert the man he loved into the mate he couldn’t become.  All three of them wept silently as the Alpha claimed his newly christened Omega with his body and his heart.
By the time they made it back to the house, neither was wearing shoes.  Dean had leaves and dirt in his hair, and his backside throbbed both from within and without.  Castiel wore a shit-eating grin that Dean decided he’d earned well enough that Dean left him to his smugness.
“Right, the D.F…  Stay with me here, it’s a little complicated.  A Domination-Fuck asserts or reasserts the hierarchy between two individuals in a way that creates a chemical response, a hormone release, in both of their bodies which reinforces the hierarchy.  It’s a means for the Top to “put the Bottom in their place.”  He used finger-quotes to clarify.  “It keeps uncertainty out of the interactions between them, but it doesn’t create a permanent metaphysical bond between them after the act is completed.  Domination-Fucks are used a lot during Omega or Sub training to help keep the student in the right state of mind to be receptive to the staff.  Many traditional families also use the practice at home as part of their Pack Discipline regimen.
“It’s not, Mr. Winchester. That’s not an option. Please continue your work.”
“I’m learning.  Never had to do this before.  We were nearly always in one mode or the other in the past, weren’t we?  Be patient with me, Dean.”  Cas settled into his chair at the kitchen table and took the beer Dean handed him.
Naomi took the next moment to dab at her mouth with her napkin.  “In my day,” she stated.  “Young betas honored their elders.  It’s extremely disappointing to see what a sad state of disorder my sons have allowed this household to fall into.  Charity and compassion for the lower classes are one thing.”  Naomi cast a glance up as EMTs rushed into the room with their gurney.  Rachel stood up in spite of herself.  Sitting at the dinner table felt wrong.  Naomi simply arched an elegant brow and continued with her thought.  No one mattered to her but herself, Rachel realized. “But to fill this magnificent house with drifters and freeloaders is a step too far.  I shall make my displeasure abundantly clear to my sons once this fiasco has come to an end.”  Naomi looked around her.  “Where has Gabriel gone off to?”
Dean sat down on the bed beside his father. “Dad, look at me. What happened to you…it happens to a lot of wolves. It wasn’t your fault. I’m the one who fucked up. I should never have let you go off on your own. You needed me, and I walked away. Don’t you see? Even as broken as you were, and I’m not saying you weren’t broken, even as bad as it was, you never left Sam and me. You stayed and battled it out until we could stand on our own, and then you crawled away to lick your wounds, and it was easier for me to let you go. That’s on me, Dad, not you.”
“Are we back where we started?” Dean asked in a clipped voice.
“Y…eah,” Charlie stumbled, looking anywhere but at Meg.  “Came in while the guys were offsite making big, world-altering changes in the paradigm of reality, and you and I were neck-deep in everything they left behind.  I didn’t think you’d wanna hear it from Ellen.  She’s a bit stiff where mates are concerned.”
She chuckled softly. “Silly Alpha.”
Dean hit the speed-dial button and let himself into his bedroom.
From the foyer, Fred and Nick listened to the house settle.  Benny swept Andrea up the stairs.  He shared a few words with Fred, and then he took her home.  The silence in the foyer was eerie after the flare-up of excitement.  Only the Grandfather clock’s ticking as the pendulum swung broke the quiet.
“Indeed?  In what way?”
Sam crumpled the waxed paper that he’d wrapped his sandwich in and stood to get something more from the lunch line, nodding absentmindedly to Pam.  “Thanks Doc.  It’s good to have you home.”  She nodded.
“Um, no thanks.  I’ll take your word for it.”
“Not much,” April admitted.  “But I know enough.”
“You slept without her last night, man.  You wanna explain that?”
Michael looked up at her. “It was just a high school production, April. I never said I was any good.”
Michael laughed. He checked the empty bottle in his hand after Jimmy ejected the nipple decisively. He wiped the pup’s face with a deft hand and let the boy roll out of his lap to explore the blanket. Michael watched Alex checking on his parents in between pitiful sobs and had to stifle another chuckle. It was too soon to predict, but Michael could imagine Alex developing a full brat as he matured, and he pitied whoever landed on the other end of such a beast.
And I’ll say,
“What if he Presents Omega?” Heath asked.
Monday, June 19, 2017
“Yes, I believe you. You are SO good for me, little one, and I want to see your nasty hole take a big cock. I want you to beg for me. Will you beg to be allowed to come once you’ve got a cock shoved up your ass? Will you beg, Adam?”
they overheard.
“Absolutely not,” said Benny vehemently. “That’s not what we do. If they want a paddle swinger, it’s not rocket science. They can hire a Dominatrix from the internet.”
Michael flared upright and looked Dean in the eye. “I told you, Dean, it wasn’t something I made a choice about! They had Pete! They had
Michael huffed a soft laugh.  “Silly alpha.  Omegas are nothing new.  It didn’t scare you with Alex, and he’s a firstborn too.  Besides, the world’s not that bad when you’ve got a good pack.  Look at me.  See how well I turned out?  Look at Pete.”
“Nonsense.  Put that down, and come celebrate with us.  You’re Pack, too.”
“I’m okay, Sir.  Just the usual nausea.  I feel better now.”  Michael resisted searching out the comfort of Dean’s eyes with his own, but he clung to his mate internally and felt a strong grip in reply.  Dean wasn’t about to leave him.
“Come again?” Dean’s skepticism hadn’t waned.
“You’re going to declare in no uncertain terms that the wedding is still on, and nothing he could do will stop it, come hell or high water. You’re going to
Michael scoffed good-naturedly. “You’re biased,” he deflected with a soft, pleased smile.
In the Control room Benny whispered, “Damn…” and blew out an impressed breath.
“Pssst!”  Michael’s stern face caught Dean’s attention again.  They communicated wordlessly while the discussion continued between Pastor Jim, April, and Cas.  Michael wanted to know why Dean’s thoughts kept turning so dark.  Dean shrugged.  The conversation was dark, so he didn’t think his emotions were out of line.
They blinked.  That’s what it’s called when the baby blue fades for a moment, and then returns again.  Dean remembered that much.  He was so full.  So full.  So much pressure.  There was a constant throb and a buzzing that sent sparks of sensation through his body so that he shimmered in his flight.
“Was that rule unclear to you at the outset, Samuel?”
“I’m not always a good person, Dean,” she admitted.
“You should’ve been there, Cas,” said Dean rubbing his head. “I’m not kidding. It was electric. It was like a TM Trigger was trying to spark but couldn’t. It was crazy. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
He sighed heavily and opened his eyes again, looking at her for a second before deciding whisky on the rocks was the best option for them both.  “Friday night Pack dinners are a big deal in this house,” he explained.  “And they’re supposed to be limited to Pack members only.”
“You get to the good stuff yet?” Dean asked him.
“Be still, Dean!” Michael corrected with a hard smack to Dean’s thigh.
He started slowly.  He worked Dean’s cock with gentle pressure from his tongue against his hard palette and sucked his cheeks in.  Dean moaned and put a hand against the back of his head, gripping the black hair but not guiding or forcing him, just holding on.  Michael worked him methodically.  He varied the pressure and speed and depth.  He sucked and hummed, licked into the slit on the head of his cock, and then plunged back down deep enough to cut off his air supply and make his eyes water. Michael could feel Dean through their Mating-bond.  He worked him for a while in studious silence.  He could feel every time Dean was close to coming and every time, he backed off, releasing his hold on Dean’s cock and sucking a bruise into his inner thigh or nuzzling his face into the stiff hair at Dean’s pubis.
He was gone now, and all that surety dribbled away years before he died, leaving behind a husk, a void, where power had once lived, a vacuum that bewildered his oldest son who’d grown up trusting that alpha could never be toppled.
Some time later, Michael found himself lying on his side across Dean’s lap, his hand still clutching at Castiel’s shirt and tears staining his own face.  Dean rocked him and continued to whisper gentle words and stroke his back, his arm, his hair.  Slowly, the panic subsided, and his breathing calmed.  Castiel squatted before him, looking concerned, both hands on Michael helping to support and calm him.
“Uh,” the guy stepped in and looked around. “Kind of bare, isn’t it?”
are.”  Disdain dripped messily off Michael’s tongue.
“Ouch!  Jesus, Rachel!”
Dean looked up, still sprawled on the low bucket where Rog had put him.  “That what the witnesses say?” he asked.
“Or not,” added Dean.  The full weight of what it meant to be Omega was not something he would ever truly experience, but just touching the edges of that space set him reeling again.
Michael’s splayed hands slid around his hips to his belly and dug in a little, a possessive clutch.  Dean could feel Michael’s erection through his black slacks, pressed up into the crack of his ass.  One hand came up and pinched Dean’s left nipple.  A hot, wet breath dampened the back of Dean’s neck.  A tongue traced his scar.  Dean felt his knees go weak and his cock drip a single sticky line of precome onto the bedding.  The scent of Omega slick wafted into the air around them both.
“Okay, here’s what I want: I get to kiss him and fondle him whenever I want without you getting catty on me.  If you walk into a room and he’s got me bent over and ass-up for…whatever, you just keep on walking, sister.  When it’s my night to sleep with him, I sleep with him however he wants me, and you don’t get all pouty about it, capiche?”
to make. Not yours. If you want to file a grievance, do so politely. Ask for what you want. You will not always get it, Pet. But you will always be heard. If you throw tantrums, you will be reprimanded. If you disobey me, you will be punished. Is that not what you want from this union?”
Bobby walked far enough away that they wouldn’t overhear.
Michael hummed in agreement and quickened the pace of his strokes while increasing the power behind his swing. Dean struggled against his mate’s hold and cried out in indignation. This wasn’t how Michael ever did things. Where was the discussion? Where was the listing out of transgressions? Where was the demand for an apology and remorse?
(See the end of the chapter for
April sat down and ran her fingers over the board to get the feel for the volume in the space.  She wanted to be able to play in the background of any conversations that were happening without drowning them out.  She started up a frisky ragtime jaunt, and Dean leaned over her shoulder and tapped out a spontaneous beat on the bass end.  She turned to look up at him without pausing.  “I didn’t know you played, Dean.”  She was very surprised.  He was extemporizing a harmony on the fly.  Few amateur musicians knew how to do that without some training and years of practice.
“Fantastic,” Dean grumbled. “All the time in the world.”
Cas just rolled his eyes and dismissed the topic as ludicrous before leaning over his mate and leaving a warm kiss on her temple.  She smiled but continued the tune.  Cas stood over her with his eyes closed for a moment and listened.
me!” she repeated.
“Wait.  I get it.  I do.  It’s just that in the wake of my Claiming you and the two of us getting hitched, I forgot to try to figure out how much of that glint was play and how much was real.”
She gripped the handles and flung her head back, screaming in pain as a deep stripe welled up with a red line across her back.
“I…Yes, Alpha.  I can do that.”
“No doubt,” Cas replied with a touch of tempered impatience. “We tried last Septennial to warn the hospital officials that it was due, and they did nothing. We advised them this round was looking to be a record-breaker, but apparently we got nowhere. They’re protective of their quarterly budgets. They lied to us this time. They said everything was ready. I shouldn’t have believed them.”
Jack watched Benny watching Ketch. “And where am I ranked?” he asked.
“I know Kali,” Cas said at last. “She’s making our wedding clothes. Welcome, beta. Please come in. We’ve just arrived home with the new pups. Won’t you…?”
“Okay, so let me get this straight,” Dean protested again.  “Not only am I forbidden from touching my own dick, but you’ve locked Cas out from it too?  And he agreed to that?”
“Do?  You choke up on her leash, boy.  Don’t give her any slack or she’ll use it to put a tourniquet around your testicles and pinch them right off.  Stay ahead of her if you can, and God help you if you can’t.  Don’t leave her to concoct plans to hit you with when you’re wiped out.  Keep her too busy to scheme.  Wear her out, Sam.  If she’s got any juice left at the end of the day, you’re not running her hard enough.”
“Tired?” Cas asked him.
“Fuck! Michael!  Oh, fucking God, yes!”  Dean sped up again, fucking ruthlessly, growling deep in his throat.  He let his head fall to his chest as he grunted into his work and felt his thighs start to burn.  The Mating-bond warned Dean that Michael was close.  Michael’s fist flew over his cock, stripping it with blinding speed.  He threw his head back and screamed as he came, his channel clenching around the alpha’s knot and securing it in place.  The knot held and Dean too, came with a shout.  He pumped against Michael’s ass and ground his knot in his mate’s channel as far as it would go, sending come shooting warm and filling deep into Michael.  Dean continued to grind against Michael’s ass through his release.  Then he stood panting, massaging Michael’s hips with his hands, eyes closed, head thrown back to catch his breath.  Dean moved through a couple of aftershocks before folding himself back down over his mate.
“I’m working the home field,” she told him. “I’m scheduled to clock in about fifteen minutes from now, so I can’t stay and chat. But I wanted to hear your voice, kiddo. I know that was rough. You okay?”
“Sir, your leadership of the company right now is set up like a pack, right? The deepest Alpha is in charge, and all of the other leaders below you are arranged by pack hierarchy?”
with this stuff.  Before you play, get yourself trained.  Don’t get hurt.”
a wolf, and Dean went lightheaded with relief.  All thoughts of walruses and pandas fled as he absorbed the image.  No, it wasn’t a full-blooded wolf.  It had an odd stripe of white running down between its ears, down the length of its muzzle.  That was no wolf marking.  There was more than a little dog in this wolf.  But Dean couldn’t deny the sensation of familiarity that sent his blood quickening and wetted his mouth with saliva.
“I love you, too.  And Dean?  I’m not evil to want this.  Sometimes you know something’s right for you even when every logical argument says it’s not.  This is right for me.  I need you to see that.”
“Mm-Kay,” mumbled Dean, working his lips and tongue over Michael’s bite and holding onto his waist.  “Your turn.”
Dean buried his face in his pillow and kept his focus tightly on Michael’s mind, tracking him until it was clear the Omega was somewhere deep in the bowels of the house and no longer travelling.  He seemed to be in the gym.  He seemed to be running.  He seemed not to mind Dean’s intrusive pushing, for he hadn’t shut the bonds.  He wasn’t answering any of Dean’s probes though.
Dean wasn’t really prepped enough. And Dean was no Omega. But years of practice—conditioning—had taught the two men to read each other. Dean worked his knees extra wide, recognizing Castiel’s endgame. He opened his hips, bowed his back to press his center out and upward, and he bore down against the intrusion, making room for a knot that shouldn’t fit, but did.
“Very well, Dean.  I understand.  You’re forgiven.  Let’s put this behind us and move on.  I want you on your knees though.  I’m not rewarding that kind of behavior.  Be good for me, and we’ll try it again some other time.”
Dean slumped down in his place.  Cas smirked and ran a hand down Dean’s arm, catching his hand as he reached it and pulling Dean unceremoniously to his feet.  “If I let you stay here, I have to insist you hold your position.  I don’t really feel like doing that, Dean.  You’ve earned a chance to relax.  Let’s get back in bed.”
She sniffled.  “Sir, Gabriel said you would come home broken.”  She sniffed again and rubbed her nose along her outstretched arm, leaving a shiny trail.  “You said you were fine.  He said I shouldn’t let you touch me, but I needed to know.”
thanks, for everything you do—both of you, all three of you. If I don’t get to see Krissy before I have to cut out, let her know too. You three are badass. You’re the sharpest team in the game, and I’d work with you any day of the week, even if you’re girls.”
“Mm-hm.  It’s not here yet, but it’s coming.  Maybe another day.”  Cas let Dean drain the bottle then took it and set it on the table behind them.  He massaged Dean’s torso and shoulders with strong hands, turned him, and pressed him against the stones and went to work on his throat.
Dean chuckled without looking up. “Yeah, I seem to recall hearing that before. Once or twice.”
“I haven’t been much help getting ready for tonight,” April admitted.  “Do you need anything else done?”
“Let’s call it a day here folks…pick it back up tomorrow when we’ve all had a chance to sleep on it.” Benny interrupted his Alpha, sitting upright and stretching his arms over his head.  The beta at the front of the room stood frozen and shell-shocked.  His mouth stood open in a motionless gape.  Benny doubted he was breathing.
“Careful with the attitude, Omega,” Dean chided, but there was no real heat in the words.
Castiel purred again, grinding himself against her sit spots, driving his hips in decadent circles, flaring her heated welts, and making April cringe.
“If they can find you on a mailbox in an unlit back alley, they can find their way to us,” Jack told him confidently. “A simple word from you, and I believe most of them will be easy to flip from the shady side to the legal side. You’re too healthy to have a business book full of the dregs of humanity, Max. You strike me as a top-notch businessman and a right good judge of people. Talk to your clients. Give us their names. We’ll mark them as they come in, discount them while they wait for you to come out of the other end of training, and then we’ll return your business book, fully intact, and you’ll have a whole roster of support at your back. It really is the best of both worlds.”
“Don’t answer him!” his father rebuked.  “Answer me!  And I expect words, Castiel.  You are not a mute!”
“How’s Michael?” Dean countered.
And Jess was his whole world.
“I’m going remote,” Helene blurted. “I’ll still travel a lot. That won’t change. But I don’t need to live in New York anymore. I’ll be able to set up a base anywhere. Anywhere, Billie. I want to live here…”
Cas smiled a tight-lipped smile. Tight, but warm. The smile crinkled the thirty-seven-year-old crows’ feet at the corners of his eyes, and Michael felt the warmth blanket him. Cas finished with Emma and carried her across to Michael, nestling the pup between them. He put an easy hand on the back of Michael’s neck and rested his forehead against Michael’s.
Dean liked his new office. It was closer to the cafeteria and the classrooms, and further from Castiel. That allowed more leeway to avoid micro-supervision and allowed for quick trips across the hall for warm cookies or a slice of pie. He also liked having Billie as his operational boss. She was brusque, but fair. She wasn’t intimidated by the imbalance of holding a superior management position to subordinates who owned the company, and Dean respected that about her. She had a job to do, and she made no bones about doing it. She proved a beta could supervise alphas and make it work.
“I’m certain I saw some sheep,” Michael responded moving in for a kiss.
“Is that what you did?”
Even Gabriel was on his best behavior.
“Will you tell me if I guess right?” Dean asked. His voice held a hint of playfulness.
Sam laughed at his brother’s pitiful attempt to soothe him, but it broke the tension. Dean always had a way of breaking right through when Sam’s uptight became unbearably uptight. He shook his head and stilled his bouncing heel. “Do you know what you’re going to say to him?” Sam asked, changing the subject. He wasn’t looking at his brother anymore.
“I can’t, boss,” Bobby croaked.  “Security barely wanted to allow the medical team through.  They’ve put the whole place on lockdown until they assess the risk.  Claire drives like a maniac, and we think she might’ve drawn some eyes westward.  We can’t let on that that village is anything but a pitstop for people headed out of the wild.”
“Hey, Ace!” Dean greeted, catching the pup.  “Good morning.  Daddy saved you some breakfast.  You hungry?  Thanks, Fred.  How’d they do last night?”
He laughed harder, and Cas smiled in sad amusement, shaking his head.  “You have the strangest sense of humor, Winchester.”
“It’s just us?” Michael guessed.
“Yes.  Thank you, Fred.  I’d really rather talk to you than to the butler.”
“O-Pop is most in charge besides Papa,” Jimmy pointed out.
“Absolutely. Move it, Winchester. It’s not every day you turn twenty-nine.”
In the end, she pulled the truth out of him, and she seemed satisfied.  They talked for some time, but she didn’t make Michael revisit the incident, and she had a way of keeping the mood from getting maudlin.  April played for her before she left, and Pam hummed on her way out.  She left Michael feeling quite a bit better, and he slipped out to try his hand at Castiel’s meditation technique followed by a short run on the treadmill.  By the time Dean and Cas came home, he presented a bright-eyed, pink-cheeked vision of glowing gestational masculinity.  Dean pulled him in and clutched him, apologizing repeatedly for driving away in the morning when all he wanted to do was stay.
“I forgot. Michael, please.”
“I know you do.”  She frowned.  She wanted to reach out to him and comfort him, but she couldn’t bring herself to do it.  Her instincts demanded she not close the gap that was her only remaining escape route if he pounced.  He wasn’t going to pounce.  “I love you, too, but I don’t want to Mate you.  Not right now, Nate.  Not until we’ve grown up some.  I want to go to that school in Kansas where they do the testing.  I want to learn what the polished Omegas know.”
Michael’s conversation with his sister left him in a morose mood again.  Tony arrived earlier than usual to serve breakfast, although they were completely capable of cooking for themselves.  Fred hovered.  Maureen sat in Cas’ chair, but she allowed April to dress and to sit in her chair, not on the floor.  Jess bundled in just as breakfast ended with both pups already tucked into their sling at her waist.  She looked harried.  Michael carefully extracted Hank, handing the pup to April, and then he took J.T.  Jess sighed in relief.
“I despise politics, Greg.”
“Nope.  Pups appear when they’re ready.  Your Alpha knows that.”
“You do.”  She said it, but she didn’t yet mean it.
Cas pursed his lips and ran fingers through her hair.  “It’s, uh, it’s a midway point of sorts for aboriginal wolves who want to leave their packs in the wilderness and join modern society.  It’s small enough not to overwhelm them, but it introduces them to the structures of our society.  It’s also a place where Lupin refugees from oppression or places of unrest can find sanctuary.  We have a good relationship with Baylon Knight, who runs the place.  He’s still more aboriginal than he is modern, so he’s a good translator between worlds.  He knows what it’s like in modern society.  He just doesn’t much like it.”
“Yeah, no shit. Still want that seat at the table?”
“May I help you, Alpha?” he asked lightly.  “You gonna remind me to write my scene report?”  The adrenalin was gone.  The panic that sent him flailing in desperation had vanished, leaving behind a soggy sense of warm affection that was an odd aftertaste to such a violent affair.  He was still bleeding a little from his shoulder, but Cas had bandaged him sufficiently to keep his crisp white shirt clean.
“I believe I owe you, then, sir,” she continued as if Michael hadn’t spoken at all.  And this.  This was why April shouldn’t be deciding which designation he occupied.  She had thought she wanted him cognitive and gentle, but she didn’t.  She really, really didn’t.
fucked, for the rest of your life.”
“Did it sound like a request, Jessica?  Because it wasn’t.  Sit down, or I will sit you down.”  Sam let his wolf into the forefront.  He rarely did that.  It wasn’t that he didn’t trust the wolf.  Sam’s wolf was massively dominant and powerful, but it just didn’t need much by way of exercise.  In truth, it had grown a little lazy in the past few years.  Sam enjoyed scening, letting his wolf out as a contract scene-worker for The Facility, and just as often signing up on the other side of the contract as well.  He’d liked playing with Meg a lot.  Kind of a very lot.  Sue him.  He liked brats.
“Would you consider scening with us together, Babe?” Dean asked Cas quietly. “I’ve been thinking about it a lot. Michael wants to put me centerstage and show me off, let other guys in to touch me, all that kinky shit they talked about at his assessment, and I’m thinking I wanna do it. But maybe start small. I’d like it if we start with an impact-play scene. I’m dying to know what the two of you might think up together.”
“And skunks,” she said with a raised brow, pleased with herself.
“Thanks, Sam.  I’m through with sitting for a while.  Dinner was hard enough, but I knew I wasn’t getting out of sitting there.  At least now I’m on my own time.  Think I’ll stay on my feet for the time being.”  He ran a hand along April’s hip and flank, admiring her bruises.  “How about you, kid?  Aren’t you too sore to sit?”
“I will if you make me,” Dean snarked.  He hid his worry that Cas might ask what he and Michael had talked about.  It wasn’t time yet.  He wanted to hold on to his illusions for as long as he could.  Sue him, he’d always been selfish that way.
He steered to the first floor bathroom, but after relieving himself of his last two beers and washing up, he grabbed his coat off the hook by the door and slipped out into the gray cold of late afternoon.
“I know. I know, Michael. It would be too…weird. And it would be unfair to Dean.”
“One week or no deal.”  Cas navigated back to his email.
“Oh, man, sorry to hear that,” Dean commiserated.  He slipped into his chair at the foot of the table and squeezed Michael’s hand.  “Have some dinner, man.  You’ll feel better after you’ve eaten.  Maybe read the kiddos their story before bed.  Don’t forget, you’ve got them all morning.  You’re not missing everything, Michael.”
“How many of us do you expect him to take, Michael?” Raphael asked calmly.  “I don’t want to break your toy, but a fuck-hole that gives out after two or three rounds is a shoddy piece of ass.”
“One!”
“Whatever.  If you send her to live in Rhode Island, it’ll make everyone miserable.”
“Maybe, but I’ll wait and give it to you later,” teased Dean. He leaned across the corner. “Come ‘ere. Lay one on me. You did good. I like this guy.” Dean kissed Michael simply on the lips. It was little more than a peck. His hand found its way beneath the table to press against Michael’s belly. “And how’s our little one?”
Jenn handed a wad of cash forward. “Don’t fuck with me, bud. I’m from New York. I eat Angelenos for fucking breakfast. Take us there. Now.”
or it just scampers happily around thinking it’s playtime. Every round that we go through this, the volume gets turned up a little higher, a little riskier, a little more dangerous. Damnit, Cas, last time I fucking blindsided you on your fucking birthday! Don’t tell me that didn’t hurt, man. I know you covered for it cause you figured out I was blotto, but I can’t keep blowing holes in your hull. What’s next, huh? And after that? And then after that? Am I gonna have to draw blood eventually?”
Michael frowned at her.  “Isn’t that what had you guys so freaked out after the convention?  Alpha said he’d never heard of having multiple designations show at once.”
They’d done it before.
because I won’t hesitate to write you up for it and make sure you pay publicly.” Billie scowled, and he pressed his lips together, mid-chuckle and shook his head. His eyes continued to dance though. He pocketed his meter. “Good,” she told him sternly, showing not a hint that she was freshly Mated. “Then get back to work. Not a word of this to anyone.” Billie waited for his respectful nod before shooting over her shoulder at her mate, “I thought I told you to scoot!”
Cas didn’t ask again.  He could smell Dean’s scent.  He got his hands up under the man’s not-unsubstantial weight and lifted him easily, carried him to the wide cushioned chair and rocked him slowly.  He shifted Dean so that both legs draped over one side of his lap and he could curl into Castiel’s chest.
“Nate,” she whined and pushed him away.  “I don’t want to talk about Mating.  I’m only sixteen.  I’m not ready.  You’re not ready either.  We have years to think about it, to figure ourselves out.”
Dean used the respite to re-center himself and find his grounding again. He watched Ketch through the window landing hard swats to Meg’s bare ass out on the patio. He watched Ketch slide his belt out of its loops as Meg turned her head and winked at Dean, holding his eyes through the first painful blows before Uriel’s cock filled Dean’s view.
“And hungry,” she said firmly.
Michael stretched and then nodded.  He stood up and dressed with care.  “It’s really not bad, considering,” he told his mate after examining his ass over his shoulder and slowly pulling his underwear into place.  “I hate to admit it, but you’re good at that.”
“What do
She put on a cheeky smirk. “I thought we were starting a family already. Dean and Michael are ready to try, but the pup will belong to all of us. Isn’t that right?” She was very careful to avoid mines that sprinkled the landscape in a conversation like this.
Dean huffed in frustration. He stepped forward again, touching the jagged tear carefully, feeling for any evidence he was making progress. “I should leave her like this,” he reflected. “A monument to being an asshole with no self-control.”
He nodded back, then he pulled his body up a little and grasped himself with one hand to help guide himself in.  April shifted her hips, rotating a little and opening herself to him even more.
“Very good,” Benny beamed. “Exactly. This lot has been empty for decades. It’s natural to bleed over a little over the years. No harm, no foul. But if it sells, and they wanna fight over squatter’s rights and make a big show in posturing where they don’t have a legal standing… It’s not that I wouldn’t take that challenge, Jack, it’s that I gotta ask myself, is that really the kind of people I want to live next door to? If I put it to them, and they agree to pull everything back, that shows me something. You think we would get a chance to know that much about our neighbors if we don’t have a boundary dispute right off the bat? Do people usually show you who they are right at first? Or are they overly polite? What do you think, Jack?”
“OW! FUCK! I still have almost two weeks! You said I needed OW! Two more weeks! Michael!” Dean struggled under Michael’s palm, forcing Michael to fight to hold him.
“Hey, hey, hey!” objected Castiel.  “Not so fast!  You promised me.”
“You know, Mick,” Billie added from beside the door. “When you fix the agenda, you can just fix the agenda. Doesn’t require a visit in person. Also, you’re going to need to pack a bag.”
“Sorry, Father,” Gabe mumbled.
Castiel took it from him without a word and examined it thoroughly. Nodding in approval, Castiel stepped up into Dean’s space. He was close enough that Dean could feel warmth eking off him. He longed for that warmth, but he hadn’t earned it yet.
Castiel made a beeline back to his suite.  As he’d guessed, they were all there, sitting around the kitchenette table, each with a shot glass in front of them and the bottle already half-empty.  They raised a drunken toast to him as he entered, proving right off that they weren’t aiming for moderation, a rousing chorus of, “TO THE ALPHA!” to which he bowed gallantly.  Even Michael had raised his glass.  He was already inebriated, no doubt, thought Castiel.
She leaned down and kissed him hard. Apparently, ‘do as you like’ included making out in a series of wet slurps. Dean cleared his throat. Cas broke away, still smiling like a lovesick pup, still studying her face.
Samuel, that means you, dude! Assemble! Tout suite! Get your ass over here!”
He huffed through his nose, a sound of frustration and self-condemnation, but he didn’t say anything and he didn’t look up. The trickle of shame turned into a deluge, and Cas could feel Dean slipping away in his head.
Wednesday, October 3, 2018
Sam’s eyes narrowed.
“Exactly.”
something to be proud of, Dean. We’re not the mafia. If this gets out…”
Michael’s human mind caught and stuck as always.
to hurt them both, but the noises they were making weren’t pained.
“Don’t we have to wait half-an-hour after we eat before we Claim-Fuck?” Michael snarked.
“Sam,” said Castiel quietly.
“Turn around, Dean.  Let me see.”
Michael moaned a mourning loss that his own need would have to wait, but he rolled onto his side, and wrapped his lips around Dean’s length, pressing in slowly until he felt his lips stretch wide and his throat catch.
“Please don’t embarrass me, Dean,” Michael said, surprising his mate.  Why would Michael care about impressing Naomi?  Dean narrowed his eyes at the Omega, but the doorbell stopped him from following up.
“Yet, you still named your mother as a member of the new Pack, is that correct?  …Even though she’s turned some amazingly vicious turns of phrase your way in the last few weeks?”
“And once we’ve got all the test results, he’ll go into training,” Dean explained to Michael’s mother.  “We’ve chosen to have him do the training with tutors instead of with a class.  Your son’s really not a good fit for a classroom setting like most wolves are.  He’s going to need teachers who can focus in just on his needs.”
Dean wilted. His shoulders sagged visibly. “Sir, no. Please. You love this one.”
Michael stared at him.  “This whole fucking house is certifiably insane.”
Cas moaned and filled Michael in.
“How do you know anything about my family?”
Pam shook her head.  “There may be more than a bruised ego to deal with.  Please don’t blow it off, Dean.  I don’t know everything that’s going on with him, but that display he just gave us was a bird’s nest of tangled emotions.  And he took backtalk from Michael like he deserved it.  Whatever Cas did, that’s not a healthy dynamic for any of you, and it can’t go on for much longer.  We can’t simply give him time.  It doesn’t work like that.”
“Yes, ma’am. I’ll be outside. I’m sure Professor Novak won’t mind waiting for a response.”
“Next time be quiet for me, and I’ll take care of that,” he cocked his head at Dean’s stiffy. “I know you can do it, boy. You’re a good boy.” The Dom patted Dean’s outer thigh then stripped the condom off and tossed it into the garbage. “You want there to be a next time?” the guy asked Dean, and Dean nodded eagerly with wide, innocent eyes. But he was fucking frustrated, mind whirling with schemes to torque a playful response that would allow Dean to finish. If he whimpered or protested now, would the Dom remember it and carry it over to next time? Could he provoke something right now, or was this round a wash already?
“Shutter that alpha when you talk to me, boy!” Castiel reprimanded sharply, and Dean’s eyes returned to green instantly. Dean slid back in his posture until he was sitting on his butt, and he crossed his legs Omega-style in front of him. All the fight drained out, leaving him weary and sad.
“So you’ve said,” Dean murmured, seeking Cas’ lips again. “Fuck me before you leave me for Crowley?”
control me, Submissive! And he is
“Here’s the thing, Michael. We’ve discussed this before, haven’t we? What we have here is a pattern. A pattern of poor decisions. Every time we call you on it you swear it’s the last time. You swear you’ve learned your lesson…” Jody split the two ropes at his belly button and ran each strand between his legs on opposite sides of his junk before tying them off on the loop at the back of his neck, leaving two long strands hanging freely down the center of his back.
Sam made a face.  Without the scents behind it, he couldn’t quite explain.  This was harsher.  It just was.  “You know, the guy in the picture with the broken jaw is sitting right over there.  We could go talk to him.  He’s a good guy.”  Sam nodded toward Victor who had his head close to Christian’s just as the two men exploded in laughter and clashed their glasses together in a boisterous toast.  “He was on the wrong path, and he needed a correction.  It was a hard lesson to swallow, but now everything’s on track again.  It’s better for everyone, even Victor.  With Dean, it’s different.  He doesn’t need a correction.  He needs an owner.  The truth is, that’s been me since before I was ready for it.  Now it’s Cas, and that’s better for all of us.”
“ONE!”
“You’re Stan?” Sam asked, reading the slip.
“Kali is a wise woman.”  Cas kept his thoughts and feelings close.  Dean couldn’t read him.
“I’m good,” he disagreed.  Holding onto the bar helped.
“Sir, please!”
“I haven’t got my after-grad plans in place just yet, but I’m looking for a post out west,” he mumbled, fidgeting.
“Hey, hey, sweetheart, hold up there.” Cain wrapped his arms tightly around her, and she immediately went lax in his embrace, trusting him to hold her. “Shh. It’s okay. You’re okay. Put the dresses on the bed. Come with me. Let’s get you some help.” He carefully extracted the wrinkled folds of fabric from her claws and tossed them both across the bed before walking her out to the staircase, whispering all the way. April leaned into him and sobbed piteously, wetting his blue oxford at the shoulder.
“Cas?” she asked, tasting the nickname.
Warning for mention of alcohol abuse/using alcohol as a coping mechanism.
“I didn’t ask what he feels about you. I want to know if you feel anything for him.”  Dean turned left and accelerated toward the on ramp.
, Michael.  Or…Omega medical staff just like you.  Why aren’t the police clearing them out?!” Jody rounded on the security guard.  “There’s no way this is a legal demonstration.  The hospital would have known.  We all would have been notified.  Why are you just standing there?”
April curled up with Michael in the big bed, and he clung to her and wept.  When she felt him leave kisses in her hair and at her temples, she didn’t stop him, but her heart hammered in her chest.
Dean growled low and menacing in his throat at the idea of handing his mate over to be incarcerated alone and unprotected.
“No.  I want you both.  I want…he knows what I want.  I’m good.  Just do it.  God, fuck, Michael, please!”
“Good little bitch,” Sam purred.
Michael’s face flattened. “You want me to pick a fight with her and ride it to completion, don’t you? That’s what you would do.”
“You heard him, Alpha,” Dean whispered.  “Gimme a kiss.”
“Nnng, Michael, you said whatever I want.  Please.”
“I don’t understand anything, man,” Dean told his mate, feeling lost. “He’s lying through his teeth. I know he is. He wants this as much as I do. We keep inching closer and closer and closer to the real thing, but at the last second, he keeps putting the training wheels back on. He’ll do the Pack Alpha thing. He’ll do the Top thing. He’ll do Pack Discipline like he was built for it. He watches over me when I’m so screwed in the head I can’t piss straight. But he won’t trust me enough to let go where I need it the most.”
in the same position would’ve broken.”
“All right. I believe we’ve reached a decision,” stated Cas assertively. “Small steps. One step at a time. All of us understand that everyone’s comfort is required before we move forward. Each step will be clearly planned. And by the way, I need to clarify that Dean is not the only one who has the authority to call Red. If any of us finds anything we attempt uncomfortable, we stop. Understood and agreed?”
“It is,” Cas told him.  “Emma was Naomi’s mother.  My grandmother.  It’s as close to honoring my mother as I’m comfortable going.  And it means ‘Universal’.  It’s actually got the same root origin as James’ fetus name, Ermintrude.”
She slipped gracefully downward until she was kneeling before him.  “Sir, please.  It was an honest oversight.  I never meant for you to feel humiliated.  You chose the perfect name for me, and I adore it.  It doesn’t mean to you and me what it meant to Nate.”
“Jody! I’m so sorry. I had no idea it would go like that.” Michael shot to his feet, his blanket falling to the floor.
April huffed a humorless laugh at his choice of words.
“You’re not lovable?”
“Good boy,” Sam praised again, lifting him into a hug.
“I came by to see if you’d seen
But it all meant nothing until this moment.
“Definitely,” Michael groused into his plate.
Two more days.
Michael hissed. He went red and lost his seductive demeanor.
“Mm-hm,” Michael answered dreamily. He was boneless enough not to care much whether he could breathe well or not. What did that matter when every cell had reached Nirvana at the same time?
At last, laying her out on top of a clean bedspread, he addressed the damage to her backside, rubbing arnica in and inspecting every welt, every bruise, every swollen contusion.
“It’s Sam, jerk.”
“You know…” Michael seemed hesitant to say, and Dean cracked one eye open to look at him.
Cas’ eyes showed he knew what Dean was feeling.  Still, neither of them blinked.  Still there was no pain, just glacially slow movement and laser focus.  A line of sweat tracked down Dean’s brow.  The fourth bulb popped past his rim.  The toy was widening rapidly now, and Dean felt the first pang of burn before his body sucked it in and held it fast.  It felt like being knotted by an adolescent, a sensation Dean was familiar with from Keller testing panels.  His breathing was coming fast and shallow now.
Cain guided her to the edge of the bed and sat her down. He knelt in front of her and commanded her eyes with his own.
“Look, I know I was possessive and controlling, and I threatened to tear his balls off if he flirted with you…”
