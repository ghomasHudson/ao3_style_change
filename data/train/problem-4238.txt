“Yeah yeah, you’re going to set us free,” Dean snarked, but he smiled at his little brother. Were Rights Activist indeed. It was a wonder the military still put up with him. Or, more likely, they figured they could keep better control of his activities if they kept him close. Either way, hiring Sam made good business sense for the world’s largest employer of Weres.
“There’s always a choice!” Sam snarled, teeth bared, claws out and eyes flashing gold. He wasn’t sure how Ash and Bela were handling the amount of Alpha rage in the room, but for once, he didn’t fucking care. That was his brother they were refusing to help. And he didn’t believe in no-win scenarios.
“Don’t say a word” Castiel’s voice cracked as he lifted him up, slowly sliding him out of the giant rebar that penetrated him. It was difficult. The pain it caused Dean made the angel wince, and a pang of guilt tugged at his stomach.
They spoke to the local police and pinned everything together in less than two days. It was a vampire nest they were after, an odd one at that. They preyed solely on kids and cut out their witnesses tongues. It was sick but Sam and Dean didn’t even wince, they’ve heard and seen so much worse than that.
He scoffs at his own words. Dean knows better than anyone that Castiel couldn’t give a rat’s ass about heaven and their rules, and that’s why Sam doesn’t even attempt to remind him.
He added a second bed table with a lamp, cleared out part of his closet for Castiel to use, cleaned out the mess under his bed, and rearranged his desk perfectly so whatever Cas wants to add onto it will fit in perfectly with whatever Dean's already got set on his desk.
look, it burns bright in his eyes and is visible in the way the corners of his mouth tugs down, but Castiel misses it all, his eyes rather focused on the tar road under him.
Sam smiled and fought the urge not to cry. He didn’t think his brother would make it three weeks past Castiel’s passing but he did. He fought and kept his head above water until he reached the shore.
"....but aren't there other rooms in the bunker?" Castiel questions curiously as they're both seated comfortably on their now shared bed with their backs leaning against the headboard.
My hands are slightly wrinkled compared to yours, my years already running out before my life with you really began.
“It seems like an accident, no one reported it the minute it happened, but I don’t know, maybe the victims were a part of it.” Sam carries on, and Cas focuses on him now, remembering that there were still five kids that needed saving.
"Come on they have been apart for almost a month now. This is the first time Mick came to visit Cas since he transferred here." Anna told Dean.
The next day, Dean barely got any customers. He let Claire take off early as she had her homework to catch up on. The holiday rush was slowly wearing off and soon the only customer Dean might have left will be Rufus Turner.
"Cas! I could've been naked in here." Dean exclaimed, turning around to face the angel. There wasn't much distance between them. But this time, Dean didn't want to remind him of personal space.
"It was mostly sex when he was into town in between his postings at the army. And one day, he walked in with his boyfriend, saying he had ditched his fam and was ready to marry this guy. Even invited me to it. It was a small event."
Cas sits on the lake where Dean once brought him, eons ago, or that's what it feels like. He stares at the sun drowning itself in the lake. It still amazes him.
"Yeah. Whenever I visited you or you visited me, we were always in a hurry, to get out of the other's lives in which we didn't fit anymore. I spent too many days in my childhood bedroom this timr and it shattered
but in truth, no one had ever stayed there except Sam himself. Dean couldn't wait for the next holidays.
"Galvin, can you take it?" Dean asked a scrawny, blonde guy standing behind the corner. He was a fellow intern at the cafe and the most annoying person Dean knew. All he did was scroll through his phone while sitting behind the counter and criticize everything and everyone. He was a snob and sometimes Dean wanted to throw a cup of real hot coffee at him. Although attacking the manager's son wouldn't really help him keep his job.
Gabe sighed. "We'll get to it when the time comes. You are twelve, you shouldn't be worrying about fucking DCFS at this age. We will take care of it, I promise. And look," He continued when Dean looked unconvinced. "I have a lot of friends who live in shitty homes with shitty parents. And I know you don't believe it, but I
is my sister." He turned to Dean and jabbed a finger on his chest. "If you even think of fucking her or wank off your little dick thinking about her, I will crawl under your bed."
I saw you checking me out from over there and.." She put a strand of hair behind her ear. "I was hoping I wasn't wrong?"
Benny took a long drag of his cigarette, taking his time to answer. The smoke blended into the hot air of summer. "Whenever our government decides that they can let us have a life outside of shooting others for no good reason."
Dean shivered at the skin contact that came out of nowhere. Cas' hand was on top of Dean's which had been resting on the seat. It was unexpected. They used to hold hands as kids all the time, but it stopped somewhere around fourth or fifth grade. Their bags concealed their hands from the rest of the kids, for which Dean was grateful.
In that moment, Dean realized three things - his mother was gone and wasn't gonna return; there was a stranger inside his father who didn't care if his own children were in pain; and that no matter what he had told himself before, Dean did love his little brother.
Dean's brain wasn't functioning anymore. He was used to people hitting on him, but right now, he was completely out of practice. He stood up from his seat and faced the girl. "I
Dean's nerves were on fire as the hands of the clock approached the number 9. He barely ate any dinner. What if he ended up puking it out in front of Cas? He was a doctor and was probably used to seeing these things but Dean had his fi of embarassment in the last month. The thing was that, he had absolutely no idea what he was going to say. He had been feeling brave that morning, especially after Sam's acceptance of his sexuality and ended up thinking he could do this easily. Tell Cas how he used to be in love with him and how every decision against Cas was just a way to protect him. Cas might be engaged in a few days and this was Dean's last chance. He needed everything to be in the open before letting go of him. If Cas was still okay with being friends after this, good. If not- Dean has lost Cas two times, what was one more time?
"So when am I gonna see you next? Thanksgiving?" Dean leaned against the back of his car. The clouds above them hung in gray, making the world just a shade more gloomy.
The hunter splashed water on his face. He opened his eyes and looked at himself in the mirror, and gasped.
His house was empty expect for himself. Sammy had moved out as soon as he was eighteen. Didn't take him long to get into a school,
"We should at least get a doctor to check out your wounds. I have patched them up for now, but I don't know how long it will last."
Dean finally, finally looks up, and Cas smiles at him. But the hunter isn't looking at him. He is staring at his phone, which was blaring with a single name on it-
He threw the angel blade on the bedside table and started undressing himself. He wondered what he would do tonight. It wasn't like he could sleep. He didn't want to sleep with Dean either. He had to admit, Dean covered in blood after a hunt, looked
Dean was lying on his back, staring up at the ceiling. He would have to sleep in the same position the entire night, because his wounds still hurt a lot. Besides him, Sammy kept tossing and turning.
Well, it wasn't his place to judge. As long as he was not beating his kids with a belt, he was a good father in Dean's eyes.
Cas took a deep breath and closed his eyes. "When you do these things, holding my hand on a dangerous hunt, sitting too close to me during movies, sleeping on my shoulder, I can't.. I can't do this with you."
Claire looked surprised at the question. By the look on her face, she clearly didn't know that Cas and Dean knew each other. That meant that even upon hearing Dean's name from Claire's mouth, Cas never acknowledged their connection.
Dean saw Cas' bloody and broken face everywhere and everytime he closed his eyes. He couldn't believe he was the one who had done this to the angel. Cas had begged him to stop and yet he didn't. He didn't. He was aware of the mark taking control of him, making him do these things and yet Dean couldn't stop himself. He was trapped inside this monster. A monster who had hurt the one man Dean Winchester was most afraid of hurting.
"And," Claire said impatiently. "He claims that the students damage his car but how can they when it's the holidays and the schools are closed."
, but he hasn't been to school either. I thought that something.." Cas said solemnly. "I didn't know what to think, until Jo approached me today."
Dean thought there was something sinister in the way Castiel's features were twisted into an attempt to a smile. It didn't reach his eyes, the corner of which remained unwrinkled. Had Dean touched on something he wasn't supposed to?  "Don't worry, Dean. I can take care of my Dad."
"Cas, look at me baby." Dean said, his voice punctured with his own sobs. "I am sorry. Whatever I did, I am sorry."
"You have a brother?" Claire asked absent mindedly, her eyes focused on the Maserati, assessing the damage.
"After Jack brought me back, I thought about visiting you and Sam. I saw you from a distance and you.. you seemed happy. You were trying to get your life together. So I waited. I thought that maybe you will mourn me one day, ask Jack about me, or even pray to me in your desperation. But there was nothing. Sam mentioned me once or twice, but not you. You seemed to have truly moved on. So I let you be."
He didn't open his eyes to see Dean's face. He still expected him to bolt and run. But he could still feel him. Feel the burn his stubble on his stomach. Hear the gentle thud as his knees hit the floor. Feel his fingers fumble with his belt.
Sammy had accepted a long time ago that there were some things that Dean would prefer keeping a secret. Dean was happy that his intrusive brother had learned to leave him alone, but at the same time, he missed the innocent eyed kid who used to look at Dean like he was the world. Thec curious kid who thought that his brother will have all the answers, until the questions became too heavy for him to keep searching.
"Those words I said to you that day, I never expected to see you again after that. But Jack brought me back. And I couldn't come in front of you, no matter how hard I tried. I couldn't bear for you to reject me, because I know you will never feel the same way I do."
Dean cut the call. He moved forward, boarding pass in his hand. He looked at the plane parked in front of them through the window. People were boarding it. There was no one in the line behind him.
The last thing Dean wanted to do was talk about his little brother when his boyfriend's hands were so dangerously close to his groin. "He said I should go to a mechanic."
"It's not your fault. How could you have known? It never really came up. And besides, its not like we were close or anything."
Sammy went back to his breakfast, shaking his head. Dean could feel the vibes of pure anger coming from him. In other circumstances, he would have found it funny. But today, he was scared shitless out of his mind. He had no time for his little brother's bull. "Where is Dad?" He repeated, a bit more loudly, trying to show Sam that he wasn't kidding around.
Dean decided now was the time to concentrate on his food. He dared not look at anyone, especially Cas.
Cas undressed himself and they both entered the tub. Cas asked Dean to just lay back and let him take care of him. It hurt Dean to sit on the cold marble, but the warm water was soothing. And Cas' hands gently running soap over his body made him forget all his pain. He looked at the angel carefully concentrating on touching and soothing every part of Dean's body, especially the parts where he had left his marks on.
Sam groaned and picked up the newspaper. Instead of moving out, Dean stood on his spot, watching his brother struggle with the pages, trying to put them in order. "Wait when did you hear me and Benny?"
"I can't just abandon you, Sammy. I have.. I have some money saved for your college but I can spare a little allowance from it."
"Then mall maybe? We can hang out and," Dean hesitated. He wanted to make up to Cas for him not going to the party. "And stare at chicks there."
"No.. don't hate me please, Cas. It won't happen again." Dean said, not daring to raise his head to look at the angel.
When Dean saw Cas leading an army of angels, he was scared. That Cas would again get ahead of himself, again drown himself in the list of power. When Hannah asked him to punish Dean, for a moment he was scared. Cas was looking at the blade and considering it. But then their eyes met and there was no one in the room except the both of them. No angels, no Sammy.
gonna affect you, but if you actually love me like you say you do, then it will. You won't be able to stay focused. And neither will I."
"I haven't seen Michael eat any food since a long time." Cas had said spookily. Dean knew he was joking, but he could feel his bones chill at the thought of Michael being a ghost. When he woke up the next day, his arms were wrapped tightly around Cas' body.
"Yes." Dean said. Cas' name made Dean feel squeamish. He still wasn't sure what had happened between them yesterday. On one hand, Dean was happy to get what Castiel's touch felt like and on the other hand, he was sad because he knew he wouldn't get that again. Cas had just asked and Dean had answered, without thinking anything else. He wouldn't be surprised if the doctor never wants to see him again. Does what Cas did count as cheating? Dean could just imagine Mick Davies coming to punch him in the face. Dean can take him. He wasn't very tall.
Shivering and limping, he somehow managed to make it to his car. The early joggers were staring at him with disdain. They probably thought he was a homeless man. If he asked them for money, they would scrunch their noses and then hand him some quarters, telling him to not spend it on drugs.
Dean looked at the sun shining, but the strong light no longer hurt his eyes. He remembered dying now. He remembered begging Sammy not to save him At that time, he didn't understand why he was doing that, but now he knew. A part of him had already died when Cas died. And the rest of him, couldn't bear to live in a world where his angel was gone.
Dean dare not look at Cas, but he could sense the tears being birthed in the ocean. He wanted to reach out, to comfort, to hold. He put his hands behind his back, interlocking his fingers, to stop them from acting out.
His brothers, Michael and Gabriel, left to join their friends in the back. Gabriel was going to become a freshman today and Michael was entering junior year. They were still big asses, Dean knew. Well, Gabriel not so much, but everyone was pretty sure Michael was going to end up in jail one day. Juvie, if he was luckier.
thing to do. If his Dad would've known that his son was a nurse for another man, he would've called him all sorts of names. The names which Dean will never let himself be associated with. Therefore, instead of holding the broken angel's hands and softly nursing him back to health, he shouted at him to get his shit together and stop being a baby.
"To?" Sam asked. Dean could see the eagerness in his eyes, expecting some good news from his brother. It made it a whole lot harder to say, cause what if he gets disappointed? Dean didn't really have many achievements to his name anyways.
"Anna, you remember her? My little sister, the redhead? She's in the town for Christmas and she came by this morning to the hospital to drop something off and she, um, she spotted Sam, so being the Daddy's little girl that she is, she told Chuck."
"So, uh, I don't know how to say this," Cas said once they were outside. "I am leaving tomorrow and I don't.. I don't wanna lose this, you know? Life's too short. You know this better than me. And I.. I don't wanna waste it in petty fights. But if you.. if you don't wanna.. that's fine too."
When they became a sophomore, Dean couldn't take the pity anymore. So he braced himself, told his introvert ass to take a seat and went over and talked to Lisa Bradey with a big smile plastered on his face. He always thought she was the prettiest girl in his grade. Two months later, they were going out.
Dean's life had been quite a perfect one. He had a perfect Mom and Dad, who bought him anything he wanted. He had his own room, sure without a TV, but he loved it anyways. The only bumper in his life was school. That, and the fact that soon, he will have to share his parents with someone else. They told him his little brother was still sleeping in his mother's stomach, but he will be out soon. Dean was wishing he wouldn't. He already had enough kids hating him, he didn't want another one, that too in his own home.
"Cas, leave me alone!" Dean almost yelled. His eyes were stinging with unshed tears, his breath was uneven and Cas' voice felt like a bee humming in his ears. He wanted it to stop. He wanted it all to stop. "Just
"Because I also know that you don't think you deserve me." His fingers were toying with Dean's waistband. "This is why I waited patiently. Annoyed you so much, knowing that one day, you will not be able to take it anymore and finally come to me on your own."
Dean sat up and had to close his eyes for a moment to stop his head from spinning. He expected the room to disappear when he opened them again. But it was still there, and
"Who said I am giving you anything?" He sensed, rather than see Cas smirk and suddenly the hand on his crotch was gone.
When Dean woke up the next morning, he realized that the thought of fetching his Dad from the garage himself didn't cross his mind even once last night.
"Do I scare you?" Thin fingers ran on his bare back. "Come back so I can take care of you." The voice along with the fingers was seducing as fuck, Dean admitted to himself. He turned around to see his partner. He remembered now. He had found the French girl in the bar last night, where they'd made out in the middle of the dance floor. He was pretty sure they had fucked in the public bathroom too. Gross.
"Sure, come in." Dean said as the older boy started looking around the room, his eyes scanning the room for God knows what.
He had hated Castiel when he found out he betrayed him. He had sworn to himself that he will off that son-of-a-bitch as soon as he finds him.
Hunting for money or food was almost a daily thing for the Winchesters and Novaks. Dean had to spend most of his allowance on food. Dean thought Cas was lucky that his Dad at least tried to put an effort. It was sad that Cas didn't feel the same.
"Dad's barely holding up. He hasn't recovered from..from that. I don't think he ever will. Sometimes I get scared that he will drink himself to death. He didn't use to do it this much. But now I have forgotten how he looked sober."
Cas turned a light shade of red. "Sometimes we do, Dean." He loosened his tie even more, exposing his collarbone.
"Can I ask you something, Dean? You don't have to answer if you don't want to. And I apologize beforehand I am stepping out of line but I just want to be sure you are comfortable and not-"
They hadn't had sex since the past three nights. One night, Jack had insisted on watching a movie together. It went on till 3 am and Dean was too sleepy by then to do anything. The next night, Sam had made them stay up all night to research on the stupid pagan. And last night, Cas had refused to have sex with since they had to get up early for the hunt and he had practically forced Dean to sleep by wrapping his arms around his chest and refusing to let go until Dean falls asleep. In times like these, Dean hated Cas.
"But Dad-" Jo started, before being cut off by her mother. "Believe me, Jo. The homes they send kids too, I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy."
"Hey." Dean felt a hand on his shoulder. He looked over to see the red headed chick standing behind him, smiling seductively.
Dean didn't actually forget what happened, he was just confused. He had never imagined that Cas would want him the same way or even dare to kiss him, because to Dean, his sexuality was a disease. So he just assumed he had reached for Cas' lips instead of the other way around. And that confusion had driven them apart. I hope that explains it well.
"You get it right? We will be too far away. I don't want to drag you down." Dean said to her while they both were sitting under the fountain statue in the local park. This was usually where they came after school to make out when their parents were home.
"Is the family drama over? Or do I have to sit through another hour for this soap." Ash said, clearly irritated.
Dean paid no attention to him and gently set the baby down on the couch. He sat down beside it and simply kept staring at it. It was sleeping peacefully, without a care in the world.
The resident immediately rushed over to them, taking his mask off in the process. Until a few seconds ago, Dean had paid no attention to the name the doctor had called out. It was just another word, swimming around a thousand others in this abyss they called a hospital, which sucked every little thing out of a person, even Dean's heart's ability to beat fast everytime he heard that name, or the one preceding it, the one which was more personal to Dean. The one which was his.
"I am sorry I shouldn't have forced you to. You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to." Dean said softly.
for God's sake." Dean started reading Mary's tombstone again. "You don't need me to dogpile on your shit today. I- I should go, right?" His blue eys were fixed on Dean. "Yeah I should go. Uh, c-call me or..or Dad if you or Sammy need anything alright? Anything at all. Take care, Dean."
"There are a lot of reasons for which I wanna shoot you Dean. But since I believe in gun regulation, I won't."
Cas turned around to watch Dean extend his legs before him and take the remote in his hand. The TV started blaring loudly.
"You think I give a shit about him?" The words shocked Dean. He knew that Chuck wasn't particularly close with his elder son, but the carelessness with which Michael had completely dismissed his Dad's feelings made him feel bad for the old man.
Dean had seen John Winchester change in front of his eyes, felt the sneers and remarks he held for his sons and still felt the teeth of his belt on his skin. Despite everything, he had always hated when someone criticized his Dad. He was Dean's father, no one else had the right to talk shit about him. He usually let those words pass with grated teeth and a heavy heart. Everyone's, except Castiel's. Castiel had felt Dean's pain with him since they were kids and held his hand through it all. He had every right to hate John as much as Dean did. So Dean had silently given him the permission to feel what Dean did. Till today.
"Dean had a fight with Dad." Sammy said. Dean gave him an angry look, but he seemed unfazed by it. He kept looking hopefully at Jo, like she was some kind of a saviour for them.
Dean looked up from his laptop. In that moment, he hated Cas for resurrecting him. Because even hell was better than this torture the angel was putting him through.
Mr. Turner's hard features softened themselves into an almost smile. "Just because I don't like you, and I have a valid reason to do so- you never seemed to stop talking in my class; that doesn't mean I don't see a future in you, Winchester. You have a brain for physics. Hell knows where you get the time to study, because I have never seen you do that in my class, but your answers have always impressed me."
"It's just that your home was in the opposite direction and I know Sam is there too, so I wasn't sure if you wanted to see him in the state you were in."
Cafe Heller was the favourite cafe for people of their school. Dean had managed to get a job there, and now he was able to afford discounts for Lisa. Although she never really needed it.
"I didn't know he missed his Mom that much." In all the time Dean was with Cas, he had barely ever talked about his mother, even when Dean lamented about his all the time. He only wanted to change the topic when Dean bought her up.
"Hey Sammy look! I shaped my rice like a bird." Anna's high pitched voice cut through the thick tension on the table.
Dean hadn't been to school since a week. His teachers had called them home to ask John what had happened. John didn't pick up. Dean had to tell his teachers that his Mom died and he will be back soon.
it. You don't know what grief feels like, because you never had to lie awake at night crying into your pillow. You never felt the despair on seeing the empty house still echoing with her laughter. You never knelt by her grave, praying to anyone who would hear you to somehow, in some way bring her back. You avoided it all. You never knew what grief is, because you drowned it in your booze."
"Is- is everything okay?" Cas asked nervously, biting his lips. His hair was sticking out in different directions after being smashed against Dean's chest.
"Its not that easy. The garage doesn't bring much income. Not to mention I would have to set up social security numbers and pay taxes and other adult stuff. While I learn to do that, Sammy would be in the system, and next thing you know, he is in juvie for arson or murder."
"You sure your boss can't wait a few minutes?" The accented voice came from behind him. Dean turned around. The French girl had removed the sheets off herself and there she was- lying completely naked.
Dean and Cas sat across each other, involuntarily, as Dean had arrived late on the table and there was only one empty chair. Mick was sitting on Cas' side while Sam was sitting on Dean's. Chuck was at the head of the table with Anna opposite him.
"Yeah it's- it's home, right? To both of us." Dean said, not wishing to elaborate further. He didn't want Cas to know that he never went to college. That he was nothing but a high school graduate working his Dad's job. A sudden resentment rose inside Dean at the thought of Castiel being in his life again. He hated the way the blue eyes pierced through him, making him want to lay it all bare. "You living with your old man?"
, that's what they're making you believe. They wanna keep him there and make as much money as possible before declaring the time of death one day."
Cas gave him a pitiable look. Dean had never felt more pathetic. "I think you and I both know what you meant."
"All this time Cas, this entire time, you thought I was pissed at you for kissing me? And.. oh God, you never knew about Benny and you thought I was disgusted, didn't you? This is why you thought I was homophobic. And fuck..
"Look I know that.." Sam cleared his throat, his Adam's apple bobbing up and down. "I know that I haven't been the best brother to you. And I haven't been as much -
He didn't want to screw it up. But his mind was tensed. Lisa's words were swimming around in it. Dad had told him yesterday that this car was going to be good money and he had promised that he would get it repaired by tomorrow. Dean grabbed a wire inside the plier and twisted, trying to remove the kink in it.
They've been caught talking in their science class. Again. Their teacher, Rufus Turner was usually a nice man, but Dean and Cas always seemed to test his limits.
"What?" Dean said, taken aback. "I am.. I am n- not.. gay." Dean said, which technically wasn't a lie.
Dean awkwardly wrapped a hand around his brother's large frame, to pat him on the back. He didn't know how many times he was gonna have to thank Sammy that winter.
John gave a sinister smile that chilled Dean's blood. "I regret giving it over to her killer just because I didn't want it in the hands of a faggot. Killer or fag- you choose-"
"Don't ever compare yourself to Dad, alright? Don't." Sam said sternly. His lips were closed tight together and there was only a fire in his eyes when he looked at his brother.
The truck driver had run away immediately after hitting John's car, which looked damaged beyond repair. Cops said there was no use looking for them. John already had tons of alcohol in his system at the time of his death. It will be ruled out as just another unfortunate accident with an alcoholic. Dean didn't want to get invested in catching his father's killer. John's liver would've killed him in a few years anyways. At least this way they were spared the hospital expenses which would have been required to treat his liver.
"I am sorry, Dean." He finally said, looking away. "Every time I try to help you, I make everything worse for you."
Chuck gave him a big smile. At least he wasn't angry with him. That meant Cas hadn't told him what happened.
Dean looked around the table. Cas was looking at him with his head tilted, confused. Anna was staring at him with curious wide eyes. Sammy fixed his eyes on the food, already knowing what was about to come.
Cas again took a step back. He could feel his throat choking up. "I.. can't. Not with you." He was pretty sure that the hunter will make fun of him if he finds out that the only reason Cas was feeling down was because his boyfriend didn't appreciate him enough.
"You don't have to. I just want you to know how much I still love and respect you, even though I stopped showing it."
He had only decided to do this four days ago, so he had asked everyone he knew to bring everyone they know. Sam, Eileen, Jo, Charlie, Jess, Garth, Jody all had shown up- to Dean's relief. There were only two acquaintances of Dean in this town that he hadn't invited. He was sure they wouldn't attend. They would have other things to plan.
After Ellen's ex husband had died, his will had come as a shocker. He had left his bar to Ellen Harvelle. Ash had taken off to God knows where many years ago. Last Dean heard, he had gotten into drugs. His Mom had died before her husband. In a way, it did make sense for him to leave his bar to his only remaining family. Bobby was retired from his company by then, so he was grateful for an opportunity to sit idly at somewhere other than his home and make some money out of it. It also meant free drinks for Dean and someone to keep him in check if he drank too much.
Cas stared at him for a moment before realization kicked in and his eyes widened with terror. He stood up, looking at Dean as if seeing him for the first time, making him want to crumble in his own shell. Cas knew about his darkest parts now.
"Cas!" Dean shouted excitedly. "Cas, Cas Cas." He pulled the blue eyed doctor in a hug and felt electricity pass through him. Dean released him immediately.
John was killing himself, Dean realized, the way he had tried to when Mary had died. Dean had stopped him back then. He had hidden as many bottles as he could. He let his Dad scream and shout at him to tell him where they were. He even felt John's hand on his skin many a times. But he never told them where he hid. Dean didn't know then that what he was doing was useless. Joun would just go out and drink, spending Sammy's diaper money on booze. Dean had to use clothes until Ellen found out one day and bought him some.
He hates to think of himself as a weak human who can’t control his urges, but as he continues staring through the crevices, he knows that that’s exactly what he is.
Dean feels his blood run cold, and his heart stops for a second or two. He gapes his eyes up at Castiel who’s still on top of him, and he wishes that he heard those words wrong— that Cas said anything, but
“Did Cas put you up to this?” Dean raises a brow, hoping he’d look rather pissed, but there’s only a tinge of worry in his eyes.
“You need to tell us everything or else—” And out of nowhere the boy appears again, and before Dean could point his weapon at him, he finds himself flung across the room and into a wall. He feels his ribs and left arm shatter against the concrete wall, but he doesn’t feel it after that, his adrenaline won’t allow him to. He gets up and meets Castiel’s worried gaze and offers a quick reassuring nod.
They stare at each other, lips parted and noses inches from touching. It’s like time stood still. Nothing matters but this unexplainable gravitational force pulling them together. Their lips inches from touching, they’re so close they could almost taste it.
“I was curious,” He shrugs his shoulders, his eyes peering at the ground beneath him as if he were thinking of telling Sam his real answer.
“I love you too, Cas. So damn much" it felt good to say and for Cas, it was the best thing he had ever heard. It brought tears to his eyes as he let Dean cup his face and kiss him.
The rain begins to subside as the grey clouds disappear, making way for a bright yellow sun and a ray of light with seven different hues. They’re seated, just about an inch apart, with their knees pulled up to their chests. They’re both glowing with joy, their eyes bright and gleaming, their smiles wide and gleeful.
Dean’s lips part and he kisses Castiel back with eagerness while his hands find their way onto Castiel’s hips.
“You’re right,” he lets out an amusing chortle and makes sure to gently drag his hand down Dean’s arm when he’s sure that no one’s looking at them.
"Dean. I don't want to talk to you right now. I have nothing to say and whatever you have to say, I don't want to hear it"
Castiel releases a muffled moan against Dean’s mouth as he feels his hair being tugged on, the light sting making him crave for even more. He moves his hands up and down Dean’s chiseled torso and tugs onto his shirt so vigorously that one of the buttons snap.
“Yeah, well I'm doing it anyway. I love you too, Cas. So damn much” it felt good to say, better than anything he has ever experienced. It was complete bliss and the feeling was infinite.
Dean’s eyes flutter open, and he let's out a groggy breath that’s followed by a sweet smile. “Baby, you know how I feel about being woken up so early.” His voice is as deep and majestic as a lion’s roar, and all that Cas is able to do is just kiss him again.
“Of course man. We gave up everything, if we keep on giving we’d be left with nothing. We deserve to live like normal people, at least for a moment. You deserve to be with Eileen and start a new life with her. Me on the other hand, I’ve got miracle and that’s fine, it’s good. He’s all I need"
“Sit down.” Dean looks to his brother and waits for him to do so. Sam sits beside Dean, with his back pressed against the impala and his knees pulled up to his chest.
“I don’t understand, why does the FBI care about my son’s death?” The man’s bottom lip quivers, along with his hands and his legs. He looks guilty, without a doubt, but they can’t act without being 100% certain.
His breath is heavy and shaky as his eyes fall shut, his hands raking up and down his husband’s back, leaving behind trails of faint red lines. He screams the his name as he reaches his climax, the feeling euphoric and different than the last time— It’s always different, no matter how many times they make love to each other, the feeling is always new and different.
His pulse soon steadies and his heartbeat slows, going back to normal as he grows tired, the sound of his angel's faint breaths lulling him into a deep and peaceful slumber.
He checks the EMF reader, his weapons, and hands Castiel his favorite gun— the silver one with the engravings— wanting him to protect himself in case anything goes wrong. Cas takes it without hesitation, and Dean gives him a kiss before cocking his shotgun.
“She makes me happy, and as far as I know, I make her happy too, and that’s all that matters right now.”
“I understand that my reaction earlier isn’t what you wanted, I know you’re confused… so am I, honestly. But don’t you dare think that I don’t want you here with me.” He begins, placing a hand on Castiel’s, trailing it down to his fingers.
Dean silently mutters to himself as he tries to casually throw his hands over his bulging crotch before Castiel's eyes decides to drift onto it, which it dosen't, luckily for him. Castiel couldn't care less about what's happening around him at this moment, his focus is solely on Dean's perfectly defined features and every goddamn beautiful frackle splattered across his face.
Jack was gone most of the times yet his presence was always there, lingering in the air and in every little particle in the universe.
“I missed you too, dad.” Jack says with a smile and pulls back to see the relief of seeing him safe flood over Castiel’s face.
The song starts off slow and calm. They start to sway in tandem as Dean places his hands on Castiel’s hips and feels as the angel throws both arms around his shoulders. They dance quietly, moving so swiftly in their garden that you could swear they did it all the time.
He shoots his body out of his seat and just as quickly, pulls the gun from his coat and points it at the ghost. A loud bang follows his swift and deft movements, and like a mirage appearing and disappearing, the ghost is gone. He knows exactly how much time they have left until it appears again, Castiel knows it too and that’s why he turns to the man and urges him to tell him where his son’s bones had been buried.
It all looks intimate and suggestive to Castiel, and as Dean rests on his side about an inch away, Cas unconsciously turns to his side as well, but it’s all he does, the fear of being wrong about Dean’s signals halting his hand from doing what it really wants to do.
“I’m sure there’s plenty of space for you two to crash here for the night.” Dean says after Charlie tells him that she wouldn’t be able to drink much being the designated driver and all.
But, nothing happens. They stay like that for a while, hoping the other would make the first move but it doesn’t happen. Dean is first to move, he rolls off the angel and lends him a hand as if he couldn’t possibly get up on his own. They exchange smiles, awkward ones, and let the silence take over as they walk away and over to their car, looking everywhere but at each other.
It almost looked like a soon to be victorious hunt but it all turned sour when Dean was injured, fatally. Castiel’s breath hitched, his eyes immediately watered and his heart felt like it was ripped apart, slowly, piece by piece.
“You two have an amazing home.” Jody smiles and makes sure to offer Castiel her praises as well. He’s standing awkwardly behind Dean with a glass of water in his hands, and he grins politely, thanking her silently for her compliments.
Dean drifted, feeling safe and blissfully happy for what felt like the first time in his life. He snuggled into the warmth and comfort around him, trying to cover himself in the intoxicating scent of ozone, lightning and the forest after the storm. It was clean and pure and perfect. It made his heart sing. His mind supplied him with images to go with this potent new scent; of a large wolf—both familiar and unfamiliar—at his side grooming him, taking care of him, protecting him. Showering him with love, affection and kindness. Dean relaxed further. There was no need to worry here, no troubles, no war and no fear.
“It’s very much like you to want to protect innocent people.” Cas smiled. “Makes you a good Packmaster.”
“I must admit some of his tactics have been less than...optimal. And I am truly sorry for your loss. But we are freeing Weres from their military prisons and from the old world order to form a new free society! And no transition of power has ever happened without a little bit of bloodshed!” Gabriel said passionately.
"Listen! How about we make a deal?" Castiel shouted, still behind the rack pallet. "We finished the spell. We're not going to hurt anyone, I swear. Unless you force our hand."
Dean followed Charlie while keeping an eye on Ben who was talking energetically to Anna and Claire. They were approaching the group of parents when he spotted Castiel who was sitting with the other parents.
Castiel and Charlie put their hands on the ground, closed their eyes, and concentrated. A tree had fallen sick and they decided to help it.
"We didn't know what kind of spell it was until I got hurt on another hunt. I healed immediately. It was great in the beginning until it backfired."
Castiel was helping the brother more and more in their cases. He was starting to become a bigger part of their life. Dean had been watching him from the end of the dining room where he was chatting with Sam about the difference between pureblood werewolves and the one who was bitten.
"You should go see Rowena, she would be able to help Castiel," Charlie told Dean as they replanted the branches. Dean nodded in answer.
She had never met him before. Maybe Dean and Sam told her who he was during their case, but she had also answered his question before he had even asked it.
But this time, it wasn’t Castiel who did it. Instead, there was another dryad standing in front of him. She had golden blonde hair that dropped over her shoulders.
On it, Alex had drawn the entrance of a secret passageway at the back of the castle. The young woman had explained that said entry was old and forgotten. She had stumbled on it by chance. However, she had never used it to escape, too scared for her life. Dean and Castiel looked at each other.
"Deeeeaaan?" Castiel asked as he was finishing his drawing. The two friends were laying next to each other in Castiel's bedroom.
"It worked," Dean breathed. "Castiel, it worked!!!" He took Castiel in his arms, tears coming to his eyes. He won't have to live forever watching everything around him grow old and die.
“Sam! Castiel!” he shouted as he opened the door to the room where Cas had been living these last months. He almost expected them to jump from a hiding place and scream Surprise! It didn’t happen.
Surprisingly, they slowly started to speak about their lives. Dean had a hard time getting an answer to some of his questions. He did learn that Castiel wasn’t very close with his family, at least.
"Oh, crap. I forgot about that." Dean sighed. Jack had grown a lot lately and so had his tree. Unlike the rest of the dryads, leaves were missing from his hair. And he was a curious young boy. A bit too much if you asked Dean. Jack had multiple times touched potions and ingredients. Once, almost making a potion explode by adding new ingredients.
His stomach growling, he heads to the room where Castiel was sleeping. After banging on the door, he heard a grunt.
"So, what have you been up too, lately?" Sam asked, standing in front of the counter of Dean's shop. He, Eileen, Ella had decided to visit Dean. Eileen had decided to take Ella to look around the shop to let Sam and Dean talk alone. Ella adored her uncle's shop anyway.
With a bit of luck, those stories were only stories. Some people see danger and the work of dangerous creatures everywhere. But anyway, evil creature or not, Dean had to go if he wanted to save his niece.
"Why do you do this?!" Dean shouted. Castiel pointed his gun for the third time at the ghost, but before he could do anything, the ghost snapped Dean's neck. , then disappeared again.
Castiel and Dean thanked Rowena one last time. This time with their kid. When they arrived, Dean noticed that something had changed in the garden.
"Mom! Dad!" Castiel shouted as he ran back inside, startling both of his parents. "Someone threw a ball in the garden, but it was an accident, so it's okay. Can I go play with him? Please say yes. Please, please, please!" Castiel looked up at his parents with his best puppy-eyes, his plushie squeezed tightly against his chest.
Castiel nodded and followed his parents. Sitting in front of the breakfast, Castiel stared at the food, his appetite long gone.
"Because it's the first day, I am letting you in. Next time you are late you will stay outside. Now go sit down and stop perturbing my class." When Singer started his class again Castiel hurried towards an empty seat and got his stuff out as fast as he could. He looked around him, to see what the other students were doing. He was already late, no need to also be lost.
Castiel took a look at Dean who was trying to stay awake. They were so close to their goal, and it wasn't some stupid potion that was going to stop them.
“You found what?” Sam asked, his brows furrowed. Eileen got out of his bedroom after hearing the fuss Dean made.
"Slow down, sweetheart. We have to ask his parents first, alright?" She told Dean who nodded reluctantly. "I hope we aren't bothering you," she said, this time talking to Castiel's mother. "Dean wouldn't stop talking about Castiel and kept insisting that he had to invite him."
"But what about your roommate?" Castiel asked. "I don't think that would bother him if you switch places. I rarely see him in our dorm anyway." Dean answered. Castiel smiled at that. He couldn't get a better roommate than Dean.
“Thank you,” he said while passing by Dean. Following Sam, Castiel acted as normally as he could until he could get out. Soon, hopefully.
His happiest childhood’s memories were in this house. Once, on his birthday, his uncle came back with a black foal. He had shown Dean how to tame a horse and taught him how to ride one. To this day, he was still riding Impala.
“What is...” he began, then stopped. He was more than likely in the house of a witch. He grimaced at that idea. He didn’t want to wind up in whatever potion or spell those witches would need him for.
“What looks human isn’t always human,” Missouri said. “There is this new girl in town, Alex. She is staying in the tavern downtown. She knows something.”
“Sammy! I found something interesting.” His brother was also doing research in another part of the library. Getting his attention, he continued, “Do you remember that coven we found last year?”
"I have no idea what's going on," Dean answered. "Let's hurry up." Castiel and Dean grabbed their shovels again and continued searching for the grave.
His brother’s room was turned upside down. Books were on the floor, chairs were knocked over, and an amulet was broken on the floor. There had obviously been a fight and Sam was nowhere to be seen.
"I'll take this as a yes, then." Castiel grabbed and made a paper ball out of the copy of the spell, and threw it over the wall of flames with his phone as best he could. They fell to the ground on the other side with a dull sound.
He put the potion for Castiel next to him trying to not wake him up. When Dean poured his potion over Castiel's tree, it grew slightly and created a sprout. He stopped there. With that, the tree will grow quicker than normal.
“How the hell did he get in here?” asked Dean, who was still hiding under the covers, staring at the door in case Gabriel came back.
The best place to get information about other hunters was a hunters roadhouse, which was exactly where Castiel was going.
They followed her as quickly as they could despite the bewildered looks of the tavern’s owner and customers. They were losing her in the market’s crowd when Dean jumped forward and grabbed her by the wrist.
“You know, you can go if you wish. No one will stop you from going back to a bar, getting drunk, and finding yourself naked in a stable. Again.”
"Dean, Castiel is going to be okay. Rowena knows what she is doing." Dean nodded, after what happened, he was stressed about leaving him alone. He knew he could trust Castiel, but the fear was still there.
It took them a bit of time to expand the garden. But with Castiel's power and the help of Charlie, things worked out well in the end.
"I'm down with that," Castiel answered, a huge smile plastered on his face. "I'm surprised you didn't mention the Impala."
Castiel went still at the mention of the event. He should have been more cautious. Maybe he could tell him the truth will omitting some small elements. And modification others.
Castiel listened as Dean tried to explain what was going with the forest and about the dryads. When Dean started to talk about him, Castiel crossed his fingers, hoping that everything will be all right. From what Dean told him, his family should be accepting.
“Thank you very much.” As Dean went back home, hope was coming back. He put himself to work right when he arrived home. He couldn’t waste his time. This potion took him time and was tricky to realize. It took him a few hours; but when he finished it, Dean felt relieved. This time, he was going to make it. The potion was going to work, and he was going to save his niece.
Back at his home, Dean was thinking over and over again about what happened in the cave. Because of it, he had trouble falling asleep. The next morning when he was working, Dean stumbled upon the herbs Castiel had given him. Dean took the jar, a smile on his face as he remembered this day. Dean put the jar back, sighing. He knew that if he had kissed Cas, Dean would have been rejected.
Castiel looked out of the front window and saw smoke in the distance. His heart started racing at this sight. The smoke came from the area where Dean and his family lived.
"How are you feeling?" Castiel asked as they got in the car they had stolen to drive in place of the Impala.
"Castiel?" He turned around slowly only to face Dean who was looking at him like he couldn't believe that Castiel was here.
Alex hadn’t lied when she said the entry was old. It was a tunnel covered in the dust where they couldn’t see a damn thing. They were following the walls and holding onto each other so they wouldn’t fall or get lost.
Castiel threw it at the other hunters. A wall of flames appeared in front of them. The other hunters stepped back as heat and smoke filled the room.
They were hunters. He was in the same house than hunters. If Castiel stayed too long is family will come and there will be carnage. He should have taken Dean's proposition and leave. But now it was too late as he knew what the brothers did for a living. It would be suspicious if he ran away. And what about the sigil? The book he had been reading was laying in front of him, on the table.
"Sure, you can go." Castiel's mother told him. He and Dean both cheered at the same time before running out of the house. Dean grabbed Castiel's hand and dragged him towards his home. He couldn't wait to show all of his toys to his new friend.
When she saw Dean, she trotted towards him. Castiel was exhausted and seemed disappointed that contrary to him, Dean had no problem with Baby.
Dean got up from the couch, still grumbling about being woken up. If Sam was right and Ella was getting better, then Dean had to thank the dryad a second time. But for now, he was going home and back to sleep.
He told them is parents are retired hunters as a reason why he knows so much about the supernatural world. But Dean was sure it was because he is a creature, probably a kelpie. A bit after the last time they talk he decided  He should tell his brother about it. But it would certainly end Cas being hurt or even worse. His death.
"It's going to be all right, sweetheart." At this point, Dean didn't know if he was saying this to reassure himself or Castiel.
Dean couldn’t follow him everywhere and force him to talk. The only problem would be Sam. He would never stop teasing Dean if he knew what was going on.
Still, it hadn’t crossed his mind to leave Castiel at Missouri’s house. He could have even sent him to Bobby’s, his uncle would have taken good care of Castiel.
Castiel was hiding behind a wall, gripping his gun and trying to figure out where Dean was. They had gotten separated in the middle of the hun, and the next of vampires coming after them now was larger than they’d originally expected.
Sam had tried to stop her, knowing that under no circumstances it was a good idea to wake Dean this way. But Alex, pleased with the good news, hadn’t paid attention to what he said.
But, Castiel didn't listen to him and instead limped towards him, a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.
While Castiel was preparing the ingredients, Dean had been watching through the window in case anyone came searching for them. He had been sure those hunters wouldn't find them and they’d finally gotten rid of them...until he saw three cars heading toward them. "Fuck! How the hell did they find us?"
However, if his theory was correct, everything would make sense. Finding him in the stable, naked under a horse blanket, and his large knowledge of the supernatural. The closer he got to home, the more nervous he became.
"Yes. I am sorry I didn't tell you earlier. With everything that happened, I forgot about it." Castiel sighed.
"I don't want to keep you a secret. And I don't think I am very discreet anyway." Dean said chuckling. "But I have no idea at all how to explain our situation."
"Get out of the gas station. We're being followed and one of those people is coming toward you. I'm going to try to distract him." Dean started his car while the man that had been stalking them in front of the Impala before violently pressing the pedals.
But time passed and Castiel still didn't have news from Dean. After three months, his parents told him that the Winchesters probably (moved to another town). Maybe even state. But Castiel was still sure that he will get news from Dean. It didn't matter what his parents told him. He knew that he will see Dean again, soon.
But during the ride, Dean noticed a car that seemed to have been behind them for a while. Hoping it was just a coincidence, Dean didn't say a thing about it.
The hunter chuckled. This had gone way better than he had expected. In his mind, Bobby would have told him to get his shit together. His idea could work. Speaking with Cas was almost impossible.
"It's okay, don't worry about it," Dean answered. He had also changed into dry clothes. "I have some logs outside. Just wait a few minutes."
"Dean, it's okay," Castiel told him. Rowena lifted her eyebrow, and Dean stepped back sighing. If Castiel was okay with going along with Rowena then he was too.
“Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” Shouted Sam in a high-pitched voice when he felt hands on his shoulders. His first reaction was to close his book and hit the intruder in the face with it. His second was to look at said intruder, who had fallen on the floor. Dean was the last person he expected to see.
Yet Destiny decided otherwise. Near the lake named Sarnen, a black horse was quenching it's thirst. Dean observed it. It could make an excellent steed. Maybe he won’t have to go all the way to Bobby after all.
"I'll give you the spell so you can destroy it once and for all. And you'll never hear about us again." The hunters didn't answer right away, making Castiel fear that they wouldn't accept their deal.
Castiel was sitting in the dinner, repeating in his mind everything he was going to tell Dean, his burger long forgotten.
"Fair enough, fair enough. Okay, I’ll take you back to your crappy motel, now?" Castiel nodded and Dean started the car. The rest of the ride was completely silent, Castiel looking out of the window.
Normally, he would need to concentrate on shifting, but that wasn’t the case now because of the danger of the situation. It had all happened so quickly that Castiel was having a hard time breathing. He could feel his limbs and his hair growing, the form of his face changing.
"Do you want to see my bedroom?" Dean asked. Castiel's eyes widened. Dean asking him to come to see his bedroom was one of the last things he expected. Not that it bothered him. Castiel agreed immediately.
“I don’t know. I don’t have an eyeball collection,” Sam said. His brother was staring at him and sighed.
"I'm sorry about what happened. That was my fault." Castiel lifted his head and looked at Dean, his brows furrowed.
Unlike his younger brother, Dean had never been a morning person. That day wasn’t any different. Staying up late was never a problem. But waking up early? A nightmare.
Sam, Eileen, and Ella were gone. And Dean decided to close his shop early for once. He needed Castiel's advice right now.
“Yes, she’s still a bit sick, but she is getting better,” Sam said with a smile. It had taken a lot of work on Dean's side and sleepless nights on Eileen and Sam's side; but in the end, it was worth it.
"We would like to see the house before we decide anything," Dean said, taking Castiel's hand, making Castiel blush. Castiel stared at their hands fascinated. "Right, Jimmy?" Dean asked Castiel who kept looking at their hands. "Jimmy?" He continued, giving him a slight nudge and startling Castiel.
"Agent Johnson," Castiel told the police officer as he flashed his fake FBI badge. "I'm here to see the bodies."
There was a window on the wall in front of him, so Castiel approached it and grabbed onto the handle. However, the moment he tried to open it, he could feel his hand burning.
"Are you regretting helping me with the car now that I'm faster?" Castiel chuckled when he saw Dean's slightly offended face.
He would have to break it to Cas at some point, would have to tell him about how the spell worked. He just...didn't know how yet.
Dean stared at them. "Well, it seems like we have a new case on our hands." Dean grinned at Castiel. "But first, we still have to get you a car."
“Can, you tell me what they look like?” The question stops his train of thought. He wasn’t aware that Missouri and Dean had continued to talk.
He considered Bobby to be his uncle, but it was too early for a lesson about how they should be more careful with their horses.
The only exception was when they needed to eat but even then they would only take one human. He wished he could stop and observe how all this worked. However, finding Missouri and rescuing Sam were their priorities.
They walked outside, shivering and walking slowly towards the forest. He hoped Rowena was free and would be okay with helping him.
"Dean." Castiel interrupted him. "Please, let's not talk about that. It's not why I'm here anyway." Castiel took the photos of the Book of the Damned out of his pocket and handed them to Dean.
"Nothing interesting." Castiel sighed. "Just an article that summed up what we already know." Dean sat down next to Castiel and grabbed his computer.
Dean was sitting in his car, looking at the spell Castiel found, waiting for him to arrive with the last things he needed. They hadn't looked much at the ingredients before (too excited about the cure to care), but Dean needed to check for any tricks or things that would make the creation of the spell harder. All of this seemed too good to be true.
Dean sat up immediately. They’d talked about what they were going to do beforehand. Dean would help Castiel to go to the forest and see Rowena.
Dean didn’t give him any time to answer while he grabbed the horse he had bought from Bobby by the harness. He instructed Castiel to take Impala while he put the other horse in an empty stable. “Sorry Buddy, you won’t meet Sammy for a moment.”
"Everything's fine. I just want to make sure we didn't miss anything." Castiel walked towards the gas station, sometimes looking back at Dean to make sure everything was all right.
"Hey!" Castiel shouted before Dean could do anything. He kneeled and put his hands on the ground. With his last strength, Castiel controlled his tree to hit one of the men with the branches. Unfortunately, the hit wasn't strong enough to knock down that man. Castiel fell to the ground, exhausted.
"No," Castiel said, dragging his plushie behind him. He was about to open his bedroom door when the doorbell rang. As soon as he heard the doorbell, Castiel ran towards the door as fast as he could.
"I may have asked some other hunters about you. Dean, I saw a photo of you from the sixties and you haven't changed even a little; you can’t exactly blame me."
"That was one of the hunters I worked with to destroy the book of the damned. They must have somehow seen me photograph the spell."
"Ummm, hello. You are Dean, right?" Castiel asked. Great first impression, Castiel. Awkward as always. Dean turned his head toward Castiel and smiled before answering.
"I'm not smelling anything." Castiel lied. As much as the scent Castiel noticed was barely perceptible, he was sure it had nothing to do with apple pie.
"Yes, my friend and I decided to decorate this place. We didn't go very far, however." Castiel remembered the day where he and Charlie decided to completely decorate this cave. They had stopped after a few days.
“Get the fuck out of here!” Gabriel bolted out of the bedroom under the glares of the two bewildered men.
"I think it's your fuel filter. It seems to be clogged." Dean said after a moment. "I don't have the tools on me to change it though. We're going to need to call someone."
“You are the only person I know who is a morning freak,” Dean grumbled at his little brother while he put assorted fruits into his and Castiel’s bowl.
"Maybe you can move into my dorm?" Dean asked as he was still wiping his tears. Hearing this Castiel's eyes lighted up.
He grabbed a piece of paper and a pen and left a note for Castiel. When Dean was about to close the motel's door he looked back at Cas who was still sleeping and had no idea what was happening.
Because of that, he was the only person in the world who could unleash hundreds of vampires on them. And he knew where they lived and was aware of the sigil. That’s where Alex came into play.
"I apologize about earlier. I shouldn't have asked all these questions. And I should have trusted you more. I thought you were here to kill us or something like that." At that sentence, Cas let go slowly of the dagger. That wasn't exactly what he expected. He was an idiot.
“What the hell, Dean! It’s almost midnight.” Sam said. As soon as he opened the door, Dean bolted in the house toward his niece’s room.
He knew that Castiel would ask this question at some point. “After you explained to us why you knew so much about the supernatural, I had a gut feeling that something was wrong, so I started doing some research. It seems I had a good reason for it.”
The mechanic arrived right at this moment, and both Dean and Castiel stood up at the same time. Finally, Castiel's car was brought to the mechanic's shop.
The next morning as Castiel woke up in Dean's bed, he turned around, Castiel turned around to check if what happened yesterday wasn't a dream. He smiled when he saw Dean snoring next to him. Castiel moved closer to Dean who slowly opened his eyes.
“My original plan was to get out as soon as I could. But you let me stay, have a bed of my own and even...” He looked at his bowl warily. “Food.”
"What are you doing?" Roy gritted, trying to stop his friend. But Walt didn't stop. Instead, he picked something up before going back to their hiding place. He was holding a leaf.
Alerted by the noises, they had found Dean, Sam and Castiel. Dean and Sam had looked at Castiel for a few seconds. When they heard a muffled bang, they had turned around. Castiel had been lying on the floor having been hit on the head. Seeing this, Dean had launched himself at Castiel’s assailant without thinking.
"All right, but first I need some new clothes. The others might not be as happy as you to see me hang out with a human."
"What? I mean, yes my partner needed some more help on the case." Castiel caught himself with a smile at the officer.
"Here we are. Make yourself at home." Said Dean as he let Castiel in. "We should get dry clothes." The house looked very comfortable. There was a big fireplace in the living room, a chair with a pillow on it. A few plants were scattered around the room. Some were hanging from the ceiling and others were dispersed on different pieces of furniture.
“Who’s blood is it? Just tell me what happened to Sam.” The hunter’s grip on his sword was getting tighter and tighter. “Do you know where they went?”
"Fair enough." Dean calmed down. He had thought his magick abilities had gotten worse. Now that he knew that this wasn't the case, Dean was sure he could save Castiel. After those men attacked Castiel's tree, Dean had been afraid to use his potions. What if another one backfired?
"You assbut!" Castiel said, faking being upset. His hair and leaves were plastered on his forehead. The water was cold, but hearing Dean laugh like this made it worth it. Crow's feet formed around his eyes when he laughed.
"I didn't trust you. I didn't know you, yet, and you came back with a jar full of something I didn't know."
And Castiel’s only brother, Gabriel, had run away from their home a few years ago. His parents, however, hadn’t paid any attention to them most of the time. They were too busy with keeping their home safe so no hunters would be able to find them.
He was admiring the view when he heard another horse galloping in the distance. Dean was smiling proudly, believing that he had won. The moment he saw Castiel, his smile faltered.
Dean took them and gasped when he realized what it was. "Castiel, where did you find this? If this is a joke, it's not funny."
"Oh God, you're awake. The werewolf attacked you and knocked you out. I got you. You're gonna be okay."
Everything about him was odd, from sleeping naked in a stable to frowning at the food they’d provided him. Jeez, he hoped he could get his clothes back soon. The clothes weren’t even Castiel’s size.
A few hours? The longer he waited, the longer they risked never seeing Sam again, or at least never seeing Sam alive again.There didn’t seem to be another choice, though.
"Castiel! Wait!" He heard Dean calling him. Castiel thought about acting like he didn't hear and continue walking but he knew it wasn't the thing to do.
"Shut up." Dean laughed, slightly embarrassed. Castiel grabbed the labels of Dean's shirt roughly and kissed him. Dean kissed him back as much as he could.
"I'm sorry. This will probably won't lead us anywhere." Castiel said as he stretched. Right at this moment, they heard someone calling in the distance. "Well, never mind."
Three other months passed and Castiel started to lose hope. He slowly stopped wondering where Dean was. Castiel started to realize that he was probably never going to see Dean again. But Castiel didn't want to think about that.
Dean always hoped that he could know better Castiel. But he never had the chance to have a conversation with him.
"We should get in," Castiel said as he opened the door. When they entered the classroom everyone turned theirs towards them. It seems that they were the last to arrive and that the class had already started.
"No problem. Claire and Ben seem happy." Dean showed the two kids who were sitting on the living room couch. They didn't said a word since the movie started.
Once he was at his home, Dean took off his bag and sword and dropped them to the floor. He paced in his room, thinking about what happened. So, there was a creature and Dean was sure he’d offended him. But Dean was still alive, and he wasn't hurt. Well, except for a few bruises from falling off the tree. But no missing limbs or burn marks. The creature didn’t seem to be as evil as what the stories said. Just protecting this tree. Maybe he could make up for it and still get some leaves. He had to get them.
When they arrived at the motel, Castiel turned to Dean. "Do you wanna stay?" Castiel asked. "It's late."
It was dark when Walt saw two people running towards a house. One of them opened the door, looking around before locking it. Walt made a sign to Roy to follow him and approached the house. He took a look through one of the windows.
"Can he come to see my bedroom, now?" Dean asked the woman behind him as he tugged on her pullover's sleeve.
"All right, then," Castiel answered with a smile. "Thank you, by the way." Castiel scooted a little closer to Dean.
When Dean left him, Castiel turned around and watched him walk away. When Castiel saw that his dorm was empty, he entered slowly as he took a look around, checking if his roommate, Lucifer, didn't leave any unpleasant surprises. Something about him was off. When he realized there was nothing unpleasant waiting for him, Castiel put his bag down and closed the door.
On Impala’s back, Castiel was having a hard time staying stable. He had never ridden a horse nor thought about doing so. At least he wasn’t alone on the horse, or he would have fallen a long time ago. What had happened in the last twenty-four hours was unbelievable. How had the hunter discovered that he was a kelpie? And how was he still alive?
"You can go." The woman grumbled after picking up the phone. Without a word, Castiel helped Dean stand up and walked out. Dean was gripping him and limping the entire way.
"Oh, right Castiel." He said as he remembered the events of last night. He hadn’t put the gun under his pillow last night. He hadn’t felt the need for the first time in a long time. Dean put this thought aside and walked into the small motel's kitchen.
“Don’t worry about that. It would be better if you stayed here,” said Sam, pointing to a chair in front of him.
Castiel ran out of his house to tell Dean the good news, his plushie still in his hands. When he saw Castiel came back, Dean reacted with the same glee as Castiel.
A woman had been found near a lake, in a small town, dead. But they were no sign of murder or that she had been killed by some illness.
Dean grabbed as many ingredients as he could. He passed the next few hours working on potions to help Castiel's tree to grow back. And he added another to ease Castiel's pain.
Dean got off his horse and made a sign toward Castiel and Alex to follow his lead. Castiel glanced at the woman next to him. She looked like she wanted to run away as she observed her surroundings warily.
Dean nodded and thanked Sam. He started to head back to where he was an instant before his brother called for him.
"Not really. Bad things happen to you with that job. And you know, you will never have a normal life again. Still, it feels good when you can save people and not letting all that crap in their life."
So the creature was indeed a dryad, and Dean had hurt him. Dean was going to have a hard time being forgiven. He flipped through the pages of the book, searching for what to offer this dryad. But there was nothing.
A part of himself was telling him that he should do it, but at the same time, he didn’t regret it. When he finished, neither he nor Bobby said anything for a few minutes.
“What do you want?” The psychic asked them as she beckoned for them to sit down. “And yes, I am a psychic but that doesn’t mean I know every single thing, Castiel.” He stared at her, awestruck by what just happened.
The next morning came too quickly. Castiel was reluctant to get back to the forest and leave Dean. But he had to.
Claire was ranting about how she couldn't way for next year and how she found a few chocolate bunnies while Castiel was putting band-aids on her knees. She didn't seem to mind anymore that she had fallen and hurt herself. Sometimes kid are a mystery.
Not that that would stop Dean from going into those woods and collecting those leaves. But not without protection. Ready to get the ingredients and maybe fight some creatures, Dean packed a bag and took his sword.
“Thank you very much. I got you some things for you too. I brought you some books. I didn't know what you like, however.” Dean handed his bag in return. Most of the books Dean owned were about witchcraft, mainly potions. But he still found a few fictions. Castiel took a look at the books, his eyes wide open.
"Hey!" Someone shouted from the other side of the garden's fence, startling Castiel. Looking at him was another boy his age with green eyes and freckles all over his cheeks.
"I get the impression that the pie was a good idea." Castiel chuckled. Dean nodded as he started to cut the pie.
"Come on, we have a fireplace to light up. I'll show you around later if you want." Castiel nodded and followed Dean.
"What's going on?" Castiel asked, his stomach in knots. The look on his parent's faces when they saw him could only be described as worried.
"What??? I'M NOT GETTING RID OF MY BABY! I had it for years and it's one of the best cars out there!"
“Thank you. I hope your niece will recover.” The dryad told him, still looking with suspicion at the potion.
“Hello? My name is Dean. I am sorry about yesterday. My niece is very sick, and no one’s found a way to take care of her. I may save her with your leaves.” For a moment, no one answered. Dean stood in front of the tree. The longer he waited, the more he felt like his last chance to save his niece was slipping through his fingers.
Maybe they are those paranoid kinds of humans, doing everything to protect themselves from demons. Castle smiled and turned around. I’m safe; he thought as he closed his eyes, ready to sleep.
"Sure, come in." Dean moved to let Castiel in, looking behind him, if anyone had followed him. "Is everything all right?"
"What?" Castiel said, realizing he hadn't been paying attention this entire time. Dean was looking at him, concerned.
“Do you know where Sam Winchester is?” Castiel asked afterwards. With that, Alex turned and bolted out of the tavern. They looked over at each other, Castiel seeming embarrassed by his mistake.
“Sorry. Shouldn’t have mentioned all of this to you. Let’s talk about something else.” A silence fell between them.
"No, no, no." Castiel turned page after page of the notepad, trying to see if Dean had written anything else and this was a sick joke...but there was nothing. He ran out of the motel, but the Impala was gone.
"My dad told me that we don't keep most friends forever." Castiel was fidgeting with his sleeves, looking at his drawing the all-time. "But I don't want to stop being your friend. Because I like you."
"Dean? You haven't seen each other since I stumbled on you in the cave. And you seem stressed lately." Castiel sighed, looking at the ground.
"I would like a cheeseburger and a fruit salad, please," Castiel said to the server. "I love cheeseburgers," He added to Dean while looking at the table.
"I found it!" Castiel shouted. A few weeks before, another hunter had asked him and some others for help. She had spotted a coven that was making sacrifices and gaining a lot of power. Lately, Castiel and the other hunters thought that the strange gain of power was caused by a book. One particular book: The book of the damned.
Castiel sighed as he finished getting dressed. It would be nice to have a place he could call home, but that won’t happen anytime soon. He searched around him for anything that could help him get out of the home as discreetly as possible.
The dispute continued while Dean was trying to escape. But being upside down, Dean was feeling worse and worse.
"How about a break?" After saying that, Dean froze. He was not supposed to go that far with Castiel. He was just supposed to help him find a new car and then part ways.
"I'm here." Dean and Castiel turned around. Charlie was standing there, with another redheaded dryad at her side.
"Castiel?" Dean asked, putting his hand on Castiel's arm, startling him. "Maybe, you could just come with me.” Dean shrugged. “I mean until you have a new car..."
With what Alex recounted to them, it was clear that she didn’t want to go back. At the same time, they had no idea how to get in that castle without being noticed or how to get to Sam, hopefully still alive.
The clothes he had given to Cas were discarded on the floor. When he saw the blood on the floor, the hunter dreaded the worst.
Sam stared at his brother’s face, attempting to find any confirmation that he was lying. A mischievous grin, a mocking glance. None of that. Instead, he looked delighted with himself.
Castiel sighed, glancing at the hunter who drank his ale in one gulp. Right now, all Dean could think about was the long time they would have to wait before Alex returned
"Hey, I'm sorry for waking you up. I made you this." Dean gave him the potion. "It will ease your pain."
When Dean came back, a log under his arm, Castiel wasn't back with the matches. Dean put the logs in the fireplace and went to find Castiel.
“I am not sure that I understand…” Castiel stopped when Dean grabbed his hand. Castiel ended up sitting next to his tree, eating the pie Dean bought. With Dean by his side, of course. For Castiel, the human was weird but endearing. The other dryads had many stories about how humans were dangerous and wouldn’t hesitate to destroy the trees, which would result in killing the dryads.
"Goodbye, sweetheart. I'll see you as soon as possible." Dean told the Impala, right before he and Castiel left it in the hiding place they found.
Dean was sitting in the dining room, staring at the wall in front of him, thinking about what had happened.
Castiel, still chuckling, walked into the room behind Dean. It was one other small motel with nothing special distinguishing it from the other ones.
Castiel ran away from the house reluctantly and hid in the woods nearby. He could wait for Dean’s return and possibly help to thwart an attack against Sam.
But a bullet from the other hunters broke the (back window) and pierced Dean's shoulder. Dean lost control of the car for a split second, the car almost draping.
"Heard about him," a woman told him. "His entire family were hunters. They died on a hunt. Except for Dean who disappeared after that. Why?"
Castiel was about to pick a flower when a ball fell on the one he chose, crushing it in the process.
"Cas, I already invited you in and gave you some of my clothes." Dean put his arm around Castiel's shoulder and drew him closer. "I can assure you that you aren't bothering me."
Pants in hand, he stopped that line of thinking. His family would look for him at some point. They will insist he return, and God knows what would happen to those men.
A few weeks had passed since the meeting between Castiel and Dean; and, for some reason, Castiel couldn't stop thinking about it. Something wasn't right. But what was it?
"Completely healed." Dean hit his shoulder to prove it but hissed afterward. "It still hurts a little bit."
It was the one Dean had brought a few months ago, the one he suspected to be Cas. He stopped right in front of the hunter and started to write something in the ground with his hoof. CASTIEL.
“Will you come back?” Castiel blurted out when Dean had to go. Dean turned around, surprised. Castiel was scratching the back of his head and was looking at the ground.
When the bell rung Castiel sighed. He had thought his first would have been way worse than this. Out of the corner of his eye, Castiel noticed Dean. Like him, Dean seemed to be on his own. Castiel got out of the chair and went toward Dean.
"I'm sorry but I'm tired." He said as he stood up in one move. "Can you get out, please?" Dean was sitting on the bed confused before standing up reluctantly opening the door. As he got out of the room he turned his head and stared at Cas for a few seconds. And then he was gone.
Of course Mick was perfect for Cas. Dean was undereducated, dirty, rough unlike sweet, sophisticated Mick.
"Well now that Cassie is back, hope you two won't go back to your same old bullshit, right? Hanging out all day, not a care about anything in the world, while being joined at...
Dean kept quiet, busying himself with examining Rufus's car. Lately, he had been kinda ignoring the blonde girl, unless it was to talk business. He was confused and also a little angry as to what to say to her. She
For a few minutes, Cas kept staring straight ahead at the road, his fingers busy poking his own shadow. "It was the first time I was responsible for one."
to get up and walk again. And a person's biggest motivation to live is his family. So be gentle with him, please."
"That doesn't prove I am gay. You know what it does prove? Toxic masculinity. People can't believe two men can be friends without one of them trying to fuck the other. You know, this gives a heavy commentary on what our society really is and how years of patriarchal masochism has ruined men's portrayal of feelings-"
human, the most of all.  "Dean!" He took,no snatched the remote out of his hands and switched off the blaring machine.
. All you! But never once during those nights did I imagine your lips in my ears, whispering those words. Those
"Sam told me about it. That was really kind of you Mr. Novak." Eileen said. Dean wasn't sure how much she knew. Or how much Sam knew.
The line had started moving again. Whatever issue the women had, was resolved. There was no one behind Dean.
The light turned red, bringing everything to a halt. Dean braced himself. This was it. If Cas walked away now, Dean wouldn't try again. He would go back home and start sorting his own life out. No more hookups, no more beer. He would let him go and never link his happiness to Castiel Novak.
Dean wondered if he had bad breath. The last thing he had in his mouth was an orange soda, which he hoped Benny liked. The way Benny kept kissing him indicated that. Dean wondered if he had kissed someone before.
"I don't know what you're talking about, man." Dean said, unable to look into the piercing blue gaze.
Dean woke up to see a pool of his own drool on Castiel's brown trenchcoat. His could feel his fingers on the angel's back.
Turns out, it was more than six hours. He had almost forgotten about his shift at the Cafe in the afternoon and he had never been happier to serve coffee to complete strangers and wash cups filled with salivas of the same strangers.
Cas looked away. "Because I have seen how much women make you happy. And your happiness is more important to me than anything. I wouldn't have come between you two if you actually liked her."
He remembered watching Scarlett Johansson in her black suit in the Avengers. He felt a rush of blood inside him. He thought of Angelina Jolie, Margot Robbie and all the other female celebrities he could think of.
Dean nodded. It was the one question he was scared to answer more than any thing. "Gonna mortage the garage. I did my calculations and what I could earn at the Roadhouse in a month was almost double than the garage. Plus I might join a business class at the local community college, which will keep me pretty busy. So I think I'm ready to risk it."
Dean knees gave out and he was on the ground, panting. Cas sat behind him, hugging him from behind. "I missed you."
Sam shook his head indignantly at Dean's words as if Dean had suggested something absolutely absurd.
Sam immediately dropped his hands and sat forward, his eyes shining with excitement. "Something personal?"
For a moment, they both stopped their movements and looked at each other. Dean swallowed. "I am ready."
"No, it's just that.. I told you I am tired today." Cas said. The usual smug look on Dean's face made him forget all about
Dean's heart sank. Of course, Cas hated him now. All his talks of not letting that come between them was just lies. If he meant it, he'd come back. "I don't know."
That was a question Dean asked himself daily, but he had no answer to. He knew he should go, ask for an apology to his Dad. He knew that they were overstaying their welcome here, no matter how many times Ellen or Jo tried to reassure him that they were not.
"Seriously Sammy? Grow up." He threw the seed back, which found Sam's temple. Dean punched the air in a satisfied joy.
"His recovery, if there will be any, forgive me for saying that - is not going to be easy. He could be up and walking on his feet by the next week or he can be in that bed his whole life. We recommend keeping him under observation here for a few more days or weeks, depending on his condition. We can start his physiotherapy next week." Dean noticed that unlike his senior, Cas had a tenderness in his voice. Maybe he wasn't used to the
No. Gabriel's words had managed to leave an actual on him and he had decided to actually listen to someone for once.
There wad a loud shriek which almost ruptured his ears and then he was being pulled into a hug so tight that he could swear he heard at least one rib crack.
"With me." The words were said so simply like they were the most obvious thing in the world. Like the answer had been there all along. Dean belonged with Cas.
"Car trouble again, Mr. Rufus?" Dean asked with a big grin on his face on spotting the old man standing in front of the shop, wiping his sweat off with an old, used hankerchief.
The call he had been dreading from Michigan came after a week. They had tried to be as polite as possible in telling him that his scholarship was no longer available. Dean had cut the call midway. He didn't need any of it anymore in his life.
"Okay but this one is valid. Everyone gets embarassed in front of their crush." Charlie smirked, turning to her girlfriend. "Remember how you tripped and dropped your food while knocking out a teeth or two right in front of me the first time you wanted to talk to me."
Dean thought bitterly. Sam wasn't wrong though. Dean had no idea why was he even expecting John to show up. Especially after their whole fight over the Michigan letter. His Dad had lost his cool as soon as Dean said he was leaving. Dean knew it wasn't because he was going to miss his son. He just wanted someone to take responsibility for his drunk ass.
"Try keeping that big mouth shut and then we will talk about love." Ellen said, walking back to the kitchen.
He had remained sober for five years then. After that, he had realized that he can allow himself to indulge once in a while. Only at weekends for one night. As long as he doesn't forget certain things, it was enough to keep him going.
They were barely inside the house before Dean started kissing the tall guy. Every vein in his body was telling him that it was wrong. His mind kept replaying the hatred in John's eyes on the night he had found them kissing. And when Benny's fingers brushed on his torso, his wounds lit up like a fire. The puncture of Benny's kisses against his skin made Dean ignore all that.
"Isn't the answer obvious already? He's the perfect boyfriend, the kindest, the sweetest, he knows how to cook, is a good doctor, rich as fuck. He is always there for me too. He ticks off the list pretty well."
"And Cas has me now." Mick said, giving Cas a peck on the lips. It was like someone had dropped hot charcoals in Dean's stomach. Now he really felt sick.
Cas let out a sigh. "I don't know what's going on in your head, Dean but I..what you did.. I liked it. I wouldn't mind you doing it again."
"Good." The words were barely out of her before she started snoring. Dean watched her for a few minutes and then came out of the room. He locked the door so that no one would disturb her. He'll come later to check on her. Right now, he needed to pee.
The first month was hard. His teachers and allowed him to stay at home, given his "tragedy" and he was glad. His dad stayed out the whole day, most probably working or drinking.
It was Eileen who spoke first. "That's so great Dean! That is really something.. is Ellen ready to sell?"
to face again. But it was there all the same, buying me coffee, prying into my life, laughing with me, trying to be my friend. You just.. you are so.." Cas shook his head violently as he struggled with words. "You abandon me whenever you feel like it and then you come back with those witchy eyes and the starry freckles and you think that everything will be forgiven."
Lisa giggled. "Then let them." But she obliged as Dean gently pushed her off his lap. He had to hold her to get her steady on her feet. Wrapping an arm around her waist, he gently guided her up the stairs. It wasn't easy. She kept tripping on every step and Dean had to grasp the railing tightly to stop them both from falling.
Sam eyed them suspiciously, and then leaned towards Dean. "Are you sure he's not a demon or a shapeshifter?"
"None taken. And I actually agree with you. Coffee here sucks. We actually get it at the little shop across the road. Even started getting employee discount."
"At 8 in the morning?" Sam asked, walking over to Dean. He never usually woke up so early, giving time to Benny to sneak out. He looked dirty, unkempt. There were bags under his eyes, barely visible, but there all the same. His face was pale, like all the blood had been squeezed out of it. He resembled a ghost.
Dean made himself comfortable on the couch with a mug of coffee in his hand. It's cushions was dipped in places where his Dad loved to sit and drink his ass off. It still felt oddly warm, just like the stool in the bar. The only places Dean could still feel John Winchester.
Dean got under the covers. He stared up at the white ceiling. His mind suddenly went back to many years ago, when they both were lying under the same ceiling, with not a hint of sleep in their eyes. This may be the second worst day of Dean's life. He hated that ceiling.
Maybe he liked it too much. Maybe he should have heard the doorbell. He should have heard Sammy rushing to open the door, followed by a set of heavy footsteps reaching them. He should have heard the door open.
Cas halted his speech, waiting for Ellen to take in his words. She nodded, silently urging him to go on.
One of Dean's wound must have started bleeding again because he felt a sudden pain in his side. He winced out loudly.
"I can't, Dean." Cas said as his tears finally stopped and he wrenched himself free of Dean's grip. "I can't fix it, unless you can."
"Nah. I mean yeah of course but some other things too. Things I.." Dean trailed off, having no idea how to put Cas into words.
"You shouldn't." Dean had hoped that Cas' jealousy spree would last longer. It brought out something in him, something new and raw. "Can we get back to the game now if the girl talk is over?"
"All done?" Jo had come to help him, while Sammy was downstairs eating a last lunch at their house. Cas would be here after school and they would walk together to his home. Dean was strong enough to do that now.
"I don't blame you. The way the entire body just goes down out of nowhere? Like I'm sorry if you scraped your knee but at least you made for a good joke."
They had come straight to Lisa's house after graduation. Their whole grade was here, save a few. Bobby and Ellen had specifically asked Dean to take care of Jo and to keep her out of trouble. Jo told him they'd asked her to do the same for him.
It was their turn. Dean grabbed Cas' elbow to steer him towards the counter. Dean had to make Cas walk backwards because he was refusing to turn away from Mr. Turner.
Mick smiled, and set his newspaper down. He stood up. "Well that is what I want to surprise Castiel with. My flight was supposed to be today evening but I have thought to extend my stay here for a little longer. I didn't take any holidays the entire year, so I have got pretty of vacation days."
Dean was tired and sweaty. He has been at it all day but the car refused to changed it's mind. Something has been up with it since yesterday- producing this weird noise every time he tried to start it. So he had spent his whole morning in this garage, trying to fix it, but to no avail. Sammy had come in once or twice, asking him to take it to a mechanic, but Dean would be damned if he let another man touch it. Matter of fact, he
"Amen to that. To Castiel and Mick." Anna said, raising her glass. Dean reluctantly raised his glass to cheer for his ex best friend and his boyfriend.
Dean looked at his phone lying on the bed. Cas had punched in his number the day they met at his Dad's funeral.
The older boy threw himself on the bed, pretending to pat the mattress to push out the dust. "Dad told me about the emo session at dinner today."
At first he didn't make any sense, he kept talking about his true happiness. Dean couldn't understand why on earth of all times, Cas had chosen their deathbed to talk about his happines.
The hatred running in Dean's veins was now directed towards Cas instead of himself. He had always known there was something wrong with him. He knew he wasn't supposed to feel this way for boys. He knew he was damaged. But to have Cas, the one person whose opinions Dean respected the most in world, confirm his worst suspicions about himself, broke Dean.
Ellen is there, Dean bargained, to calm himself down. Sam is not alone, Ellen, Jo, Jess everyone would be there, just like they were there for Dean. "Sam you're not making any sense. Just breathe and tell me what happened exactly." He said, moving forward in the line. Just five more passengers before him.
"You are unbelievable." Cas said, but Dean could see a trace of humor behind his eyes. He wondered what it would be like if he could just close the distance between them and kiss him right there. Flashes of that night came running into Dean's head when there was only hate dissolved in the blue. He took a step back.
"It's nice what you did for her. I wish I could honour my mother in some way too." Cas said sadly. He sat down on a bench. He somehow seemed to fit in the garage too easily.
"You have no idea." Cas smiled as his eyes glowed. The next moment, the engine was sparkling clean, cleaner than Dean had ever seen it before.
Bobby stayed in hospital longer than they were hoping. It had already been a week and there was little to no improvement. Even though, according to the doctors that was nothing to worry about. They had said that the improvement would be very slow. It still didn't hurt to have expectations, did it? Dean made sure to visit him at least once a day, mainly for Ellen and Jo. Bobby was still not conscious enough to talk. Dean and Charlie kept bringing them small things to keep their hopes up, but they knew it was useless. They didn't need food or flowers. They needed Bobby to wake up. Ellen often stayed with him at night, refusing to leave him alone. The bags under her eyes were more prominent than ever and she looked as thin as her husband. Dean could do nothing but watch sadly as she was dying with Bobby.
Dean rolled his eyes. With all his knowledge of 'humanity', Cas just never seemed to grasp the concept of a date. Netflix & chill-
"H-how are things at his home? After you know, everything that went down on Christmas?" Mick was the last person Dean wanted to ask this, but he couldn't exactly pose the question to one of the Novaks, so Mick was his only option.
Claire pondered for a few moments before answering. "Look, no offense, and I really mean it and not just in a no-offense-but-full-offense-way.  What we- me and Castiel- have, that's kinda personal. More to him than me. Well, I think me too, but I like to swim in denial and our entire relationship revolves around something that I am trying to forget so yeah. I don't think he would appreciate me telling this to anyone. Especially to someone he isn't
The way he was pining for a second of eye contact with someone to whom Dean once meant the whole world, disgusted him. But at the end of the day, he had no regrets. He had saved them both. The other boy might not know it and hate Dean his whole life for it, but it wouldn't change the truth. The simple truth that Castiel Novak was better off without Dean Winchester in his life.
Without another word, Dean went to his room. He didn't have the guts in him to make another apology. It was better to sleep it off, to wake up and hope that this day had been a dream. He would find out tomorrow that there was no Mick Davies, that Cas loved men and loved Dean and that Dean's little brother wasn't sitting out there, disappointed like always.
Michael's eyes seemed to become clear for a second as he regarded his little brother. He could be mistaken, but Dean was sure he saw a little softness behind them. Michael opened his mouth to say something, but was interrupted.
Dean felt pain in his back as for the second time that day, someone had barged into him. Distracted, he looked back but all he heard was someone muttering an incoherent apology and before Dean could respond, they had left. And the moment was gone too.
"Nah I'm good." Rufus said, waving him down. "I've got senior citizens immunity. Just gonna tell them my back gave out this morning. Yesterday I told them it was my cervical acting up. Last week I even got away on a mini heart attack."
It wasn't fair on Cas. A sloppy, one-sided kiss from years ago and Dean somehow expected him to be his forever, when they didn't even talk anymore? Besides, wasn't it more natural for Dean to sleep with Lisa and for Cas to sleep with Meg instead of them sleeping
"Um, okay." Dean said, a little impressed. He searched the bar. His eyes finally landed a red headed girl having a drink with her friends. She didn't look much younger than Dean. She was wearing a simple tank top paired with a short skirt and pumps. "She is pretty. "
The tension between Dean, Cas and Mick could be cut with a knife. As much as he hated Mick(for a reason he couldn't pinpoint) Dean couldn't blame him. Hearing your boyfriend's family talk tease him about his old friend while the said friend was sitting right in front of you could rile anyone up. Dean didn't want to ruin this for Cas. Mick was his boyfriend. He deserved to be happy with him. He started thinking about some way to change the topic to rescue all three of them from the situation.
"Nothing I- it's just drunk me doesn't have much control so I wanted to make sure I wasn't out of line."
That summer was one of the most boring and depressing thing Dean had to go through. Cas was gone, Benny was gone. He only had Jo to hangout and she wasn't exactly free all the time. She had her girls and many times, Ash took her out for ice-cream or carnivals. Dean immediately hid himself whenever he saw Ash approaching their driveway. He hadn't told Jo about his little spat with her step brother, and if Ash had told her anything, she never said it to Dean.
Purgatory was raw and Castiel was pure. And Dean's soul, was once again going to be laid bare for the angel.
"Look," Benny said with an odd calm in his voice, "I am not here to fight you. I don't have much time anyways, I gotta go back soon. I just came here to say goodbye."
"Y..you.. it was a mistake Dean! I was emotionally vulnerable and you were there and it was.. one fucking mistake. And for a long time I thought you were punishing me for being different but you and I were just the same." Cas took a pause, his breath heavy. When he spoke next, his voice was even. "You and I were the same, then why?"
What else had he been doing last night? There was some dancing involved, he was sure of that. His feet hurt too damn much. Who was he dancing with though? He tried to rack his brain. There had been some groping involved. Was he doing the groping or the groping was being done to him? Or was it both? But with whom? As far as he could remember-
There was a craziness in his eyes that Dean had never seen before. Dean instinctively took a step back. For the first time, he was scared of his own Dad.
. Dean could already feel his heart breaking all over again. "Cas, hey, you listen to me. I have to say this." He reached out and took the angel's face in his hands, forcing him to meet Dean's eyes. "I always wondered, ever since I cane into this life, what my true happiness could even look like. I tried to find an answer in Cassie, in Lisa, in Benny. But I couldn't. Because the one thing I want.. it's something I thought wasn't even capable of feeling that way. But I know now. Happiness was never in having you, it was just in being around you. It was in just saying it. And I never got to."
The world stopped. Dean blurted the word he had vowed himself to forget forever, along with the roads which led to his home and the part of Dean's heart which beat for him.
Dean sighed. He sat up and put on his pants. "Look I am sorry. You are a great person. You deserve better than me."
"He is.. he is not." Cas said through gritted teeth, venom dripping from his voice. It was a wonder how his words were able to affect Dean even after so many years.
Dean hated people who were happy in the morning. He believed they were some kind of sociopaths, who thought waking up to this shitty world was something to celebrate about. The only exception for Dean was Eileen. She and Sam usually woke up before seven, doing yoga at first and then cooking breakfast. Living alone, most of the times Dean skipped breakfast. He felt too lazy in the mornings to make one. So he had now started appreciating the variety of eggs, bacon and toast everyday.
"Gotcha." Eileen clicked her fingers at Dean, who couldn't help but grin. He loved having her here, she always knew how to make things fun and to reduce the tension between her boyfriend and his brother.
"No." Dean shook his head firmly, his own eyes filling up with tears of frustration. "You didn't grieve. You
"My Mom's maiden name." Dean said. Outside dusk was settling in. It was usually around this time that Dean went home. "I changed it after I started working here fulltime. She deserved this y'know?"
"And why do you think I wanted to go to all these places with you?" Dean asked him in a tone that you would only take with a child. Castiel's naivety was surprisingly refreshing. His anger was ebbing away.
. This whole time, he knew what Jack was and he still let it happen. He let that little brat kill his mother. If he had an angel blade in his hand, he wouldn't have hesitated. He couldn't believe that this was the man who had made Dean question things about himself. (
He threw his clothes were thrown out in a frenzy. He didn't care, half of them were torn or too old. He had already decided he would completely redo his wardrobe with some of the money he had saved. He wasn't go to uni looking like a lumberjack.
He hurriedly untangled himself from Cas and sat back on the couch, as far away from his best friend as possible. His mind was flooded with memories of last night. He had fallen asleep while watching Winter Soldier. Winter Soldier!
Cas seemed to shrink into himself at the sharpness off Dean's words. He looked smaller than ever. With a determined look on his face, he said, "I don't know you anymore. You are going through this really big change in your life and
"Cassie." Michael looked at his little brother and let out a laugh. He was kneeling on the floor, looking inside one of the shelves. Some pots and pans were lying on the floor. It looked like they have been thrown away in a rush.
Dean woke up with a groan with his alarm blaring by his bedstand. It was Monday. Time to break his back for another six days. His head was pounding like a hammer against a wall. His hangover wasn't over yet.
, El?" Dean asked gently, not letting the scare in his heart reach his voice. He wanted to be strong for Ellen.
to Cas. He did go to bed every night with the angel's name on his lips and his hands inside his pants. He never knew that all this time, Cas was hearing it all. "Then why didn't you come to me sooner?" Dean whispered.
Dean groaned from the lack of lips on his lips. "I had two glasses, Ben. I can hold my liquor. Now can we please take care of my raging hard-on? And by the looks of it, yours too."
Cas looked around the courtyard, examining the girls walking and talking there. "I don't know, Dean. I don't find any girls interesting here. I don't even know anyone here but you."
Dean and Cas looked through the pile, hurriedly and ashamed at the same time. No babes or chicks. Just bikes and cars. Dean couldn't help but smile.
Dean nodded, kindling another bout of silence between them. Everything seemed trivial. Their kiss, their fight, nothing mattered anymore. They were just two dumb boys, thinking they were bigger than anything else. How did it matter whether Dean kissed boys or girls if he had to go down in the dirt one day? It didn't make a difference whether he had boobs or abs beneath him if he was going to he worm food one day?
