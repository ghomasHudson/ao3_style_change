“I do,” he says quietly.
have you even been?" he asked angrily then turned away, running his hands through his hair in frustration.
, John thinks with a smirk. He’ll take care of that. Without a word he pulls Sherlock to his feet, capturing his lips in an intense kiss. Sherlock makes a small noise of surprise but doesn’t protest, quickly responding to the kiss and wrapping his arms around his lover. John grips him firmly and pulls him towards the couch, leaning him against the arm as he continues to kiss him deeply. Then he pulls away, still not saying a word, and makes quick work of undressing Sherlock so he stands naked before him. As anticipated, Sherlock is already completely erect and visibly aroused at being manhandled in such a way.
John huffs out a humourless laugh, running his hand through his hair and behind his neck at the uncomfortable direction their conversation has taken. Now that their new arrangement has finally been put into words, it sounds even more absurd than it did in his head.
"And why exactly does he need to be here?" John shot back, already feeling his patience wearing thin.
“I think I’m okay now,” John finally musters the strength to say.
John lands on top and straddles him, pinning Sherlock’s arms above his head and bringing his lips down to meet Sherlock’s in a bruising kiss. Sherlock moans loudly at this sudden change as John snaps the handcuffs back around Sherlock’s wrists with a satisfying click. He keeps Sherlock pinned down as he repositions himself to slide his rock hard and now leaking cock against Sherlock’s length.
is he back, John? You told me last year that you saw him fall, you saw his dead body," Celine now said carefully, after she had accepted that Sherlock was indeed back.
John sat in the familiar, comfortable chair of his therapist's office, clutching a mug of coffee and sipping at its contents as though it were some kind of miracle cure. He needed the caffeine very much after another restless night. He had experienced a great many of those over the past months, but this time it was for an altogether new reason. Nothing made sense to him anymore. It had taken him months to even slightly adjust to a world without Sherlock and now here he was back again?
“I’m going to head off to bed,” Sherlock announces, as if on cue, draining the last drops of whisky from his glass and getting to his feet. He moves to tidy the mess on the coffee table, another surprise, but John waves him away, assuring him that he'll take care of it.
“How often?”
"I…understand why he did what he did. I understand his motivations behind it, that he wanted me to be safe. I believe that, I really do." He paused, searching for the right words. "But I can't seem to get past the feeling of betrayal, the…disappointment that he didn't trust me with this."
He and Soames shake hands firmly.
“Six weeks.”
At this conclusion the room is painfully silent, and Brian is staring at Drew and looks as though he’s going to cry. He promptly leaves the room, ignoring Soames’ protests, and John decides to follow. By the time he catches up with Brian in the hallway of the old building, the younger man is clearly distraught and panicking. John talks him through the panic as best he can, feeling inexplicably sorry for him even though he’s quite clearly done the wrong thing. It seems unfathomably stupid to risk his entire career for one mistake, but John feels like he understands better than most. Neither of them speak, and Brian’s eyes remain lowered to the floor in defeat.
John pulls away ever so slightly, cupping Sherlock’s face in his hands and tracing soft, reverent kisses across Sherlock’s brow, nose, and cheeks. He longs to kiss him – not in a way that he intends to lead to anything further, but in a way that would put into actions rather than words just how much John adores him, and to give them both some desperately needed comfort. But he knows it’s not the time and neither of them are in a position to be making such drastic decisions about the nature of their relationship.
He kisses Rosie’s chubby little messy cheek and ruffles her soft baby hair, then busies himself with preparing his coffee.
"Am I hurting you?" he asked, worried.
him."
"Can I take care of that for you?" John whispers, nuzzling into his hair and drinking in his magnificent scent.
. Of course, the language is too advanced for the little girl to really understand, and she’s preoccupied with resolutely mashing a piece of biscuit into the tray in front of her, but she seems to be entertained by the sound of Sherlock’s voice.
John shook it free a little more forcefully than intended, and made his way down the stairs and out the door without looking back.
Sherlock growls in frustration, the speed of his pace increased, hands going to his hair and pulling frantically at the wild curls. Before John knows what he’s doing he’s jumped up to stand before Sherlock, catching his arms with his own hands.
"I thought you only had one," John replied quietly after a moment, a slight smirk on his face.
Sherlock had promised her that he would do better, he would be a better friend, and John had seen him strive to do just that through his actions – paying her far greater attention, acknowledging her value and talents, and thinking before he spoke. John watched as their relationship slowly healed and became stronger. Though still far from perfect and not without its cracks, it gave John hope for the future.
“What then?” John asks curiously, keen to get to the bottom of Sherlock’s strange behaviour these past few days.
Apparently it wasn't just him then. John watched carefully as Sherlock looked at the ground, his heart still racing. Had he really just confessed his love for his male best friend, flat mate and crime solving partner who had supposedly been dead for the past year? And who was a self confessed sociopath? Was he mad? He must be mad.
“Eurus is dead.”
John switched on the television, wondering what had happened to the rude, stubborn, disagreeable, almost child-like Sherlock Holmes he had dealt with so often during their time at Baker Street. He decided not to question it, at least not right now. For the time being it was enough to just sit close to one another, drinking tea and watching a detective show on the tellie, John simultaneously frustrated and amused by Sherlock's frequent interruptions to enlighten him with little titbits of information that completely ruined the plot. It was just like old times.
"John, I'm going to..."
He has bigger things to worry about anyway, including trying to manage a very active toddler who is going through a phase of resisting sleep even when very tired. Her lack of naps and delayed bedtime means that she spends most of the afternoons and evenings cranky, and by the time she finally settles John is feeling a bit that way himself, along with frazzled and exhausted. To add insult to injury, since solving the previous case Sherlock hasn’t had a new one in a week and is currently only slightly better behaved then Rosie. It’s all but driven John mad watching him pace and stalk around the flat, akin to a caged tiger, trying to expend some of that nervous energy as he hurls insults at John whenever he tries to help. On top of all that, work at the clinic has been ghastly, with a stomach bug that’s been going around resulting in patients heaving in his office on the regular. All in all, it’s been a bloody nightmare of a week and part of him wishes he’d taken Lestrade up on his offer of Friday night beers at the local pub.
John’s head whips around as Sherlock moves to sneak past them to his bedroom.
than right. It was surreal and wonderful and mind blowing in the most exquisite way possible. He knew that he would never rush Sherlock into anything, but the thought of doing more than this made him shiver with desire. Sherlock moaned softly into John's mouth and John had to fight the urge to come right then and there. As John continued the movement of his hand, noting Sherlock's reactions and adjusting accordingly, he looked down at him and felt his breath hitch in his throat at the sight of Sherlock naked beneath him, his body a flawless sculpture of creamy pale skin and subtlety toned muscles, his curls more wild than John had ever seen them, his pupils blown wide and causing his dark eyes to glitter, his lips parted in a way that made John want to kiss him senseless. So that's what he did. He finally pulled away, brushing a lock of hair from Sherlock's forehead and kissing him there gently.
The silence following his words hangs heavy and thick in the air of the flat. Sherlock looks as though he hadn’t meant to say the last part, and John knows he shouldn’t push it, knows he should leave it be, but he’s on a roll now and suddenly he has to know more, he
John freezes, blindsided by these words for more reasons than one. Sherlock’s cheeks are slightly pink and his demeanour has lost some of the arrogance of a moment ago. John opens his mouth and closes it again, at a complete loss of what to say.
Instead, he draws himself up to full height once again and pulls Sherlock into a brutal, punishing kiss. Sherlock moans into his mouth and John senses that his legs would give way if they weren’t supported by the couch behind him. He decides to show a little mercy towards his lover and pulls away to lick his own palm then slowly and deliberately wrap it around Sherlock’s length.
“Ready to head home sweetheart?” he says to his daughter, “so daddy can apologise to Sherlock?”
But neither of them had missed her suggestive wink as she left, and as soon as the door had closed behind her they’d burst into another fit of giggling.
"Deal," he says, carefully extracting himself from the sweaty tangle of limbs.
As they prepare to leave a short while later, Soames practically ignores John in favour for shaking Sherlock’s hand and holding it for a little too long, looking into his eyes meaningfully and thanking him earnestly. Though John has become accustomed to such behaviour, he still has to fight the urge to roll his eyes.
“You’re doing just fine, John,” says Sherlock, and John feels a warm bloom of happiness in his chest, even if he doesn’t believe or feel he deserves Sherlock’s kindness.
John considered him for a moment before speaking again.
John feels a tiny shiver run up his spine at what Sherlock would be like when he really wants something and turns on the charm. He's seen glimpses of it of course but couldn't in all honesty say for sure that he would have been able to say no if it were directed at him.
“I should hope not, John. After all, I did learn from you.”
"No I don't bloody well know! Sherlock's told me almost nothing of what happened whilst he was away."
"Sherlock, would you like to begin?"
John struggled to suck enough air into his lungs, hearing Sherlock's voice even though his vision was still tainted with the image of his lifeless, blood covered body, the dead eyes that had had their light extinguished. That was always the worst part. John let out a raw sob and reached out for Sherlock desperately, clinging to him, burying his face in the detective's bare chest. As he sucked in huge lungfuls of air, battling to regain control, he felt Sherlock stroke his hair soothingly, kiss his forehead, whisper words of comfort.
a small part of his mind interrupts, but he dismisses it with disgust, not wanting to allow himself to feel even marginally better about this. The crushing weight is back upon him with a vengeance and suddenly he’s exhausted. Finally, with excruciating slowness, John falls into a shallow, restless slumber.
His voice was deeper than John had ever heard it and it all but drove him crazy. He moved his hand away, eliciting a barely audible whimper from Sherlock, and pushed Sherlock's trousers and shorts down to give him better access.
John’s not sure how much time passes, lost in the rhythm of his touch and the silky feel of Sherlock’s skin and hair, but suddenly he hits a wall of exhaustion and knows he has to stop.
"Can I run you a nice warm bath?" John asks lightly.
John chuckled lightly at this, amazed to feel some of his tension washing away at Sherlock's continued attempts to make jokes.
"John, I'm so sorry," Sherlock whispered hoarsely between fevered kisses.
"How did you do it, Sherlock?" he asked, genuinely curious.
The decision to move back to Baker Street came on a glorious summer day in London. Sherlock, John, Mrs Hudson and Molly had been busy all morning putting the final touches on the restored flat. When the afternoon heat became somewhat stifling, John had suggested that they take Rosie to the local park for a picnic, seizing the opportunity to celebrate both their hard work and the rare weather. He was back to regularly seeing Ella, his old therapist, who had pressed the importance of acknowledging the good times as well as struggling through the bad. And god knew there had been enough of those for a lifetime.
Afterwards, they collectively ignore the unholy mess of take away containers and leftovers that cover the coffee table in favour of settling back on the sofa with a whisky apiece.
Then there was the small matter that he was straight, or had always thought of himself as such. He'd never had a reason not to, having never before been interested in another man in that way. Yet here he was, completely driven by an overwhelming passion and desire that he hadn't felt since he was a teenager. He thought back to the conversation he'd had with his therapist one particular day not too long after he'd finally plucked up the courage to admit that he was in love with Sherlock.
He feels Sherlock smile faintly but knows what he wants to hear, needs to hear.
“Not right now, sorry John,” he replies, his voice ragged and raw.
"God yes, you're the only one I've ever wanted. I want your cock, I need it inside me."
“You boys, I do worry about you so. It’s a good thing you have such a wonderful doctor on hand to look after you, Sherlock.”
Sherlock and John had been forced to start again, this time to literally rebuild the pieces of their shattered lives through the flat they had once shared. When the job was finally done, it seemed inevitable that he and Rosie eventually move in. John had been living in limbo – not willing to let go of his former life but also not willing to move forward. He hadn’t been working, unable or unwilling to put Rosie into care so soon after her mother’s death, opting instead to spend his days with his daughter whilst living off his quickly dwindling savings.
He leans forward, licking a line from Sherlock’s prominent collarbone right up to the spot behind his ear. Sherlock shivers with delight and twists his head, his lips seeking out John’s. John captures them roughly, sliding his tongue inside Sherlock’s open mouth, then allows the kiss to become slow and languid and tender. But before Sherlock can enjoy it too much, John is pulling away again, briefly releasing Sherlock to pull off his own jacket and unbutton his shirt. He almost groans in relief as he unzips his trousers and pulls them off, along with his underwear, finally freeing his painfully hard cock. Sherlock swallows hard and John almost pounces on him at the sight of his adam’s apple bobbing up and down his long, slender neck. The porcelain skin is far too perfect and he plans to make his mark upon it.
“I…I don’t know,” he says finally, suddenly feeling very tired. He sighs.
“I’ve been in love with him for years now,” he admits quietly, his voice rough.
Sherlock gives him a small smile and flips his palm to squeeze John’s hand.
"Are you okay?"
"Mycroft…" Sherlock interrupted, his tone a warning that Mycroft wholeheartedly ignored.
"There's also another reason I'm here today, John. I wanted to apologise for everything you have been through during these past months-" John snorted in protest, but Mycroft ignored him -"It was…most regrettable. But entirely necessary as I'm sure you will see."
John pauses and clears his throat.
Sherlock paused here, carefully watching John's reaction.
She hadn't answered his question but had given him a look that strongly suggested that this was exactly the question she was asking but didn't want to push him further than he was capable of being pushed. John had sighed heavily, exhaustion threatening to overwhelm him again. Although he had already known the answer, had somewhere inside always known the answer, it had seemed to take him a long time to form any words.
“Ever,” he grits out, then “god, this is so pointless.”
John reluctantly agrees and launches into the story, leaving out a lot of the finer details of their interactions with The Woman.
Sherlock slams his phone down on the table in front of them with more force than necessary.
John sits in his therapist’s office and the silence stretches out before him, long and unhurried. He’s told her briefly about the argument and about the odd pattern they’d fallen into of sharing a bed, but now he’s finding it one of the harder sessions he’s had in a while, partially because he just doesn’t know where to start. Ella is watching him non-judgementally, patiently giving him the time and space she’s long since learnt he needs.
“You know what, I can’t do this right now,” John interrupts, snatching his keys up from the side table and pocketing them, but Sherlock’s next words stop him in his tracks.
"Sherlock, I'm going to need-"
"Let's go home, Sherlock."
“Sherlock, you’re alive,” he chokes out, the shadows of the nightmare still invading the edge of his peripheral.
"It's possible that it might feel too big because you're trying to deal with this on your own when really it involves two people."
"Thank you for the advice, Mrs Hudson, you've been very helpful."
Sherlock’s words sound considered, deliberately chosen, and as though he wants nothing more than to change the topic. But far from placating John, this only seems to make the tension more palpable. His glare bores into Sherlock and he notices Sherlock shift, as though slightly uncomfortable under the weight of it.
"The man on the bicycle…"
"Are you sure you wouldn't rather fuck me?"
"Mrs Hudson in?" John asked, looking around as they climbed the stairs.
"I…started forming the plans just after Irene Adler disappeared for the last time. It was the perfect opportunity to carry out the first step, which was to formulate some kind of test to determine how capable you would be of lying about someone's whereabouts if required."
He releases his grip on Sherlock’s hair and trails his hand down his neck and chest, coming to rest against his right nipple. He rubs it with his fingers, softly at first, and ducks his head to capture the other nipple with his lips. He slides his tongue experimentally over the now erect nipple, pinching the other, and Sherlock moans and squeezes his eyes shut. His movements are slow, deliberate and torturous, and John knows that if Sherlock’s hand were free he’d be threading them through his hair, bossily pushing his mouth closer. He closes his mouth over the nipple, licking and sucking at it hard, and Sherlock throws his head back with a groan.
Sherlock had looked taken aback and a small pang shot through John at the idea that he'd probably not received birthday presents since he'd moved away from his parents in his teens.
“You have questions,” Sherlock states, reading John's expression like an open book.
“Problem?”
“Goodnight, John,” Sherlock says with a warm smile.
“Are you ready?” John asks roughly, all composure completely shot to hell now with his desire for the man beneath him.
“From you who knows better than anyone that things aren’t always as they appear. You who knows better than anyone what’s she is capable of.”
And with that he leaves the flat, ignoring Sherlock’s pained expression, slamming the door behind him.
“Well, he’s always been brilliant, there’s no denying
John had taken a deep breath, forcing himself to maintain eye contact with the taller man.
"Are you okay?" he asked cautiously. "I know that it's a lot to take in."
"I am truly sorry, John."
“As I told you last time, I very rarely reply.”
"Do you need me to go?" Sherlock enquired, his tone suggesting that he was scared of the answer.
“Because that’s how long it took Mycroft to locate me, infiltrate their ranks, get to me and help me escape. He did the best he could.”
He stopped, the words becoming thick in his throat at the memory of the day he had seen Sherlock Holmes fall.
"Sherlock," he'd said quietly, pulling the other man aside just before they left to meet Molly and the others at Speedy’s.
It was awhile before either of them were coherent enough to speak again, doing nothing other than lying languidly in each others arms, softly stroking and ghosting kisses over warm skin.
“You’re not an idiot,” John replies kindly, “you just made a bad decision. Sometimes people do that when they’re in love.”
"And the rest you already know."
John steps aside to talk to him, but can’t help but observe Soames and Sherlock talking – Sherlock seems to have gotten his confidence back as he rattles off deductions at a mile a minute whilst Soames looks on in admiration. It’s plain as day to John that Soames finds Sherlock beautiful, as many do, and feels not for the first time a strange sense of pride at being associated with such an impressive man. John must admit that Soames is undeniably good looking himself. Though now well into middle age, he’s clearly in remarkable shape, has minimal lines on his face, his hair is cut into a style that looks effortlessly flawless and the streaks of grey suit him in a way that is usually only reserved for ageing movie stars. His eyes are a rich hazel framed with sophisticated spectacles that John is sure cost more than what he earns in a week, and the bespoke three piece suit he wears even more so. His accent is posh and oozes class but it irritates John in way that Sherlock's, and even Mycroft’s, does not. John is also sure that Soames was somehow even more handsome back in his younger days. Realising that his thoughts are straying wildly, John turns his full attention back to Brian and forced himself to focus. There’s something about the young man’s mannerisms that remind him strikingly of Sherlock – he’s not sure if it’s the offhand arrogance, the obvious intelligence and insightfulness or the air of confidence. John places his age at around twenty-three.
"Shh," John soothes again, slamming into him brutally and rapidly beginning to lose control himself. "Give yourself to me, Sherlock."
“Oh god. Fuck me, John. Please,” Sherlock pleads breathlessly.
Sherlock abruptly cut himself off with a look that John could only describe as sheepish, and John couldn't help but wish that he'd carried out his insult...this polite, cautious Sherlock was unsettling.
"I have a feeling that you might be right about that, Mrs Hudson."
There’s a loaded pause, the friction in the air all but crackling. Sherlock is looking at John in
“There’s going to be quite a bit of bruising to this area, so you’ll need to take it easy for a few days,” John instructs, using his professional voice again.
He gave her a quick peck on the cheek before he was out the door, darting quickly up the stairs. Mrs Hudson shook her head but couldn't quite suppress a grin as she cleared up the kitchen. For the first time in a year, Baker Street finally felt
“I thought maybe if I helped him with this he’d realise how much he means to me. I was meticulously careful and thought I’d get away with it. I guess I wasn’t expecting the world’s only consulting detective to show up.”
“Thank you,” John says shakily, “How did you know--”
“And besides, I wouldn’t want to ruin our friendship. It would…be a big risk.”
"I don't know," he replied hesitantly, honestly.
“I trust that you will keep a close eye on him though. There’s no telling what he might do in this state.”
He wasn't altogether surprised at her initial reaction— the way she had tactfully tried to determine whether John had finally gone off the deep end and had started hallucinating. He had managed to explain that Sherlock was not dead, had never been dead, that the whole thing had been another of Sherlock's elaborate games. John was tired of games. He sighed, not sure of what to say next. If he were being perfectly honest with himself he doubted that there was anything she could say to make him feel even remotely better. But he was flat out of options, and he felt that if he didn't talk to someone about it…well, he wasn't sure what he was going to do.
“Don’t do that, Sherlock, you know I hate it when you do that.”
"I used to think that he was like me…incapable of emotion, of compassion…of love. But he's not. Or at least not since he met you. He
“You know how to reach me if needed. Regrettably, I have my doubts that Sherlock will accept help from me in any form. In his mind, everything that has happened is my fault.”
John traces his hand down Sherlock’s body, stopping to grasp his hip firmly, then slides lower to graze Sherlock’s hard length with his knuckles ever so briefly before pulling away.
"John…please..."
John shook his head from his position in Sherlock's arms.
“Yeah, well…things were…different then,” is all John manages to get out.
Sherlock hangs up the phone with a sigh, glancing almost forlornly at his mostly untouched beer.
May – John and Mary’s wedding
Sherlock let out a small laugh, instantly recalling their trip to Dartmoor and the fight that he and John had gotten into. Well, the fight that he'd enforced upon John.
John cruelly ceases all movement immediately and Sherlock cries out as though the sudden loss of contact is causing him physical pain. But then John is hastily unfastening the handcuffs around Sherlock’s wrists and pushing the man roughly down onto the couch.
“All in good time, Sherlock,” Mycroft responds.
“I’m sorry,” he says breathlessly. “I can’t. I need to be alone.”
"Yes," Sherlock replied softly.
"Communication is an vital part of any relationship. I think that a big part of the problems you've been having with Sherlock come down to lack of communication. It's something you would both need work on if you did decide to become involved with him."
But after a particularly trying day, John had to finally acknowledge to himself that living in their home in the outskirts of London, what felt like a long way from his support network of friends, just wasn’t working. As much as it pained him to leave the home he and Mary had lived in together, the home in which they became a family, he couldn’t imagine the kind of life he and Rosie would have with Mary’s ghost by their side, ever-present yet never truly with them. Though he had stopped seeing her not long after his breakdown and confession about the text affair, he had to admit that the living situation wasn’t healthy for him or, therefore, for Rosie.
“Don’t be obtuse, John,” he says, his voice laced with derision.
John had stared at her hard for a moment and had been both frustrated and relieved to find that her expression was very deliberately unreadable, but also completely non-judgmental.
He pushes the paralysing thoughts aside and climbs the stairs, his foot fall perhaps a little heavier than it should be.
“You were staring,” Sherlock says bluntly, and John can feel his gaze burning into him.
“Honestly, yes, it definitely wasn't what I was expecting. But it’s fine, Sherlock, it’s all fine,” John says, echoing his words from when they met so very long ago.
“Not that I didn’t want to. But Soames was unwilling to take our relationship to that level. I suppose in hindsight that was for the best, all things considered. And as I mentioned, that all fell spectacularly to pieces. There were a few others after that, again, nothing serious or long term and all ended in a similar fashion. Eventually I started to accept Mycroft’s assertion that sentiment was a weakness and a waste of time. And I hadn’t looked back since.”
John dragged his mind back to the present, where Celine was contemplating him with a thoughtful expression, making a short entry on her notepad. When she looked back up at him, her expression had changed to what John could only assume was curiosity.
"Well it must be important," he commented lightly. "I've never seen you lost for words before. Normally I can't get you to shut the hell up."
“How convenient,” Sherlock says, and his eyes meet Mycroft’s in a wordless challenge.
"John stop, I can't...I can't, it's too much," he managed to say in a broken voice, burying his face in John's neck and sucking in a deep, shaky breath.
John takes a large gulp of his tea, refocusing his eyes on the paperwork in front of him, willing himself into alertness. Its day three of their newest case, Sherlock is fully immersed in The Work, and it’s almost but not quite as exhausting as his prior boredom and restlessness. If he’s being completely honest, John is relieved that a case came their way the very day after their argument. It’s provided him with an excellent distraction to avoid the questions he must face, the therapy session he knows he needs. After all, he’s always found his work with Sherlock to be infinitely more effective than therapy ever was. Currently its one AM, Rosie is safe with Molly, and he and Sherlock are up to their elbows in records of telephone conversations and text messages.
“Thank you, John. That means a lot.”
“It’s no trouble, dear. I put her to bed about an hour ago so she should sleep right through now.”
“Do you want to talk about it?” he asks softly, “it’s okay if you don’t.”
Sherlock took a deep breath.
He relayed a summarised version of this to Celine, getting the impression that the rest of the session was going to be no easier than the first part had been.
"It wasn't just me," Sherlock replied. "I had help."
John's question was sharp, and he wondered why he was asking. Was this really the issue right now?
“No, there’s no problem. Why would there be a problem? It’s not like everyone doesn’t already think we’re-”
He passes over the jacket and John accepts it wordlessly.
"Day before yesterday. It hardly matters, I assure you that I'm fine."
A few minutes later they’re settled in Sherlock’s bed, facing each other but not touching, eyes closed, John wanting to wait for Sherlock to fall asleep before doing the same. After what seems like an eternity, John shifts slightly. He can tell Sherlock is still awake – his breathing hasn’t changed and his body has lost none of the tension that should have fallen away in sleep.
"Fuck, Sherlock, that feels amazing."
“We should get back. I imagine you’ll need to have a serious discussion with Professor Soames. Best to get it over with.”
"Who?"
“Touch me, John,” he says desperately.
Things were a lot quieter in John's world these days. He kept busy, he kept fit, he did anything he could to not think about the events of eleven months ago. Did anything he could to not think about
“Tea?” he asked.
“Better. Just a bit tired.”
“Feel like some crap telly?” John asks, and Sherlock almost laughs, and nods.
He strokes Sherlock's long arm and draws his hand to his lips, kissing his fingers reverently.
"I brought wine," John said suddenly, waving the bottle vaguely.
“Sorry, what?”
“Surely even you are able to surmise from all the available information that I’ve never done that.”
“It is with deep regret that I must assure you that it’s true, brother mine. I wish it weren’t.”
later, things feel almost normal again. John knows very well that they’re not, and they won’t be for a while yet, but the feeling of being safe and warm in their home as the rain beats on the windows outside is a comforting one. He’s even managed to persuade Sherlock to eat a whole sandwich and drink another cup of tea. They’re giggling outrageously at a particularly ridiculous scene when it happens, though John’s not even sure how. One moment Sherlock is laughing and the next he’s sobbing.
Sherlock looks slightly crestfallen that this summary has failed to impress John, but recovers quickly.
“Are you okay sweetheart?” he whispers into Sherlock’s hair, stroking soothing circles onto his back.
"Yes, John, I'm sure, and in fact I'm sure that I've never been so sure about anything in my life…well maybe that's not quite true but…"
“Another case fell through and I just…I needed to get out,” Sherlock says quietly. “I could feel the walls closing in on me. And I wanted a hit so badly.”
“Do you believe Sherlock to be asexual?” she asks.
John said nothing and turned his gaze back to his feet, finding that he couldn't look up. He didn't want to see the intensity in those eyes. When he finally did, Sherlock was gone.
He can’t help but recognise how bitterly disappointed he sounds.
John chuckles, shaking his head at Sherlock’s constant ability to keep him guessing.
John smiles, stroking Sherlock’s arm gently through his shirt.
John kissed his temple lightly, stroking his hair again.
“No. Thank you.”
"Hurt?" John cut him off, his tone incredulous, taken aback by this sudden change of pace. "Hurt, Sherlock, doesn't even
He doesn’t mean for his words to sound like an accusation, but they do. And he knows he’s not being fair, but he’s tired and his head is a mess and he feels confused as hell right now. Sherlock doesn’t back down, meeting his glare and staring him down. They both ignore Rosie’s soft whinging from her playpen in the corner of the lounge room, the threat of an impending tantrum. Sherlock’s eyes are electric, his cheeks slightly flushed, his hair sticking up at odd angles. Finally, Sherlock addresses him in a tone that sounds calmer than he looks.
It had been an exceedingly rough few months, for everyone, as they each struggled to deal with the aftermath of the tumultuous events surrounding Mary’s death, Sherlock and John’s falling out, of Eurus, Sherringford and Musgrave, and the destruction of the place he and Sherlock had once called home. John had thrown himself into the careful rebuilding and restoration of 221B, part of him pretending, and perhaps hoping, that the cracks inside himself could be repaired as purposefully as those of the flat. He thought in a way that they had all tried to convince themselves of that, even Sherlock with his stubborn rejection of sentiment.
"We'll just take things slowly, see how that goes," John suggested, feeling Sherlock nod against him and kiss his neck lightly.
“Oh not that, John,” Sherlock says, dismissing him with a wave as he gets up to fetch two glasses (and locates them immediately, of course, John notes).
"Just hold me. Please."
“Don’t look at your feet, John, look at me,” Sherlock had commanded smoothly. “It’ll be easier that way, trust me.”
“Okay?” John enquires again, starting to move away.
It’s a quiet evening at Baker Street, one of the rare occasions where they’re neither working on a case nor actively looking for one. Sherlock has been occupied with an experiment, and John, in the several days since his therapy session, has started to feel a bit more accepting of his new reality. After paying close attention to the people he’s encountered in his daily life, he’s re-affirmed that he’s not attracted to men in general but he is attracted to Sherlock. No big deal, he thinks, he can live with that. Nothing needs to change and nothing should change. God knows they’ve been through enough of that for a lifetime in the past two years alone.
“Serbia?” John asks, hoping beyond hope that he’s wrong.
"You think I need to talk to Sherlock about it?"
John thrusts into him hard, his world crumbling around him at the sight of Sherlock so deliciously undone. He knows Sherlock is desperately close and felt his own climax start to close in around him. He wraps his hand around Sherlock’s cock and it’s more than the other man can take.
"Lean back against me," John instructs gently, and Sherlock settles between his open legs, his back flat against John's chest.
, John had taken to leaving small high energy snacks in his wake in places where Sherlock would find and devour them without really paying too much attention. Getting him to sleep had been a far bigger challenge, and John estimated that his micro sleeps all added up to barely a few hours a day, which as a doctor he knew wasn’t even sustainable in the short-term. Late one night several days into this madness, he’d been on the verge of drugging Sherlock’s tea with sleeping pills, unethical as he knew this was, when there had thankfully been the slightest bit of relief. He’d been lying in bed, unable to sleep from the stress of it all, when he’d heard careful footsteps outside his door. John had kept perfectly silent and still as Sherlock had slowly entered the room and crawled into bed beside him. And he’d so desperately wanted to roll onto his side and hold Sherlock close, tell him that everything would be okay, but he had a strong suspicion that this would only scare Sherlock away. Sherlock was gone before John awoke the next morning – he anticipated Sherlock had slept for maybe four hours, which was nowhere near enough but better than nothing – and neither of them spoke of it that day.
Then he disappears behind the closed door.
He pauses and turns to push Rosie again, grateful to have a reason not to look at Sherlock as he says this next part.
"Shh it's okay, Sherlock, it's okay."
“Harder,” Sherlock manages to gasp.
“Not a word I’m afraid. I can’t reach him on his phone, it’s going straight to voicemail. Oh dear, and he didn’t even take his coat and it’s raining out,” she frets, sounding borderline hysterical now.
Mycroft turned away, his body language displaying his apparent distaste that John was choosing to be so difficult.
John drains his tea and pinches the bridge of his nose, sensing the need for a short break.
John reaches around quickly and clamps his hand firmly over Sherlock’s mouth, ignoring the detective’s gasp of surprise. Then without warning he enters him roughly and deeply, withdraws slowly then slams back in. He smirks wickedly at Sherlock's muffled cry beneath his palm and grasps his hip reassuringly with his free hand.
John pours a little oil into his palms and rubs them together to warm them up, before placing a strong and reassuring hand in the middle of Sherlock’s back and stroking gently. He sets a slow, deliberate rhythm, his hands moving across the skin in firm but tender movements. Sherlock practically melts under his touch, humming contentedly and seemingly not even aware he is doing so. As he moves his hands over Sherlock’s back, he thinks again about how soothing, how healing, touch can be. For someone like Sherlock, who has from John’s observations always avoided physical contact with other people, it must be foreign and strange. But he’s witnessed Sherlock become more and more comfortable with it over the past few months, even seeking it out now. And for John to be able to reciprocate without feeling uncomfortable or worrying about what people think…well that was…let’s just say they had both come a long way. As he muses on this, John runs a hand up Sherlock’s back and into his hair, fingers massaging the scalp. Sherlock all but moans and John chuckles lightly.
"It's about John," Sherlock answered, deciding that it was best just to get straight to the point.
Sherlock opens his eyes and his tongue darts out, licking the sticky fluid from his lips and John captures his mouth hotly with his own, tasting himself in Sherlock’s kiss.
Now his smile was wider, more teasing, and Sherlock found himself grinning back despite himself. At that moment, the rain that had been threatening to fall all day broke through the thick barrier of clouds and sent a spontaneous torrent onto the busy London streets. Sherlock and John didn't so much as glance up, eyes fixed on each other as the people around them scattered, seeking shelter from the sudden downpour.
John complies, angling his hips, suddenly hitting a very sensitive spot deep within him, and Sherlock practically screams his name.
you, John. You make him a whole person. He's let his guard down in a way that I've never seen before and he's gone to the ends of the earth to protect you. I know that he would do it a thousand times over. Don't let it have all been for nothing."
Just as he’s about to bundle Rosie back into her stroller, there’s a tap on his shoulder. He turns around and finds himself face to face with Sherlock.
, and it takes John a moment to recognise them for what they are. Then the realisation sinks in, slowly and horribly. A wave of nausea sweeps over John and he closes his eyes against it.
John’s gaze goes from his jacket to Sherlock and back again, so moved by the small but significant gesture that he’s lost for words. He’s horrified to find that a lump has formed in his throat and he clears it quickly, tearing his eyes away from Sherlock’s for fear that he’ll see the emotion that must be clearly visible.
"You weren't yourself," Sherlock had insisted softly. "And I...deserved it."
His words got gradually louder as he spoke, and when he finished the word "dead" rang in the heavy silence that greeted it.
John huffs out an incredulous laugh.
“I was there with you and I didn’t help you, I just watched as they…”
“One of my old Cambridge teachers, Professor Soames, has contacted me to request my assistance. It seems that someone has hacked into his well secured computer and software program, which contained the answers to an upcoming exam. There’s rather a lot at stake given that the top student was to be awarded a sizeable cash scholarship.”
He sucked in a deep breath, his lungs feeling desperately starved of oxygen, and stared at his knees. He couldn't look either of them in the eye, but he wasn't sure if the cause was anger or hurt. Sherlock placed his hand over John's but said nothing. John found that he didn't particularly want Sherlock touching him right now, but he also didn't want to pull away. The silence in the room stretched out for what felt like minutes. Finally, Mycroft got to his feet, collecting his briefcase and umbrella as he did so.
Practicing the dip had been by far the most entertaining part of the whole endeavour. Several attempts had them laughing so uncontrollably that they’d needed to stop and collect themselves before continuing. Then – finally! – John had nailed it, dipping Sherlock low and deep. He’d held him there for what could be considered a moment too long when the front door of their flat and swung open and Mrs Hudson blustered in, already mid-way through a sentence. She had stopped abruptly, not bothering to hide her grin at the scene, and John had almost dropped Sherlock in his rush to disengage from him.
“Oh gosh, sorry dears, didn’t realise I was interrupting your-”
John nods reluctantly.
“I know you will, John. Even though Sherlock doesn’t often say it, he appreciates your support immensely. You mean more to him than you will ever know.”
Sherlock practically purrs under John's fingers and twists his head, his mouth seeking out John's. Their lips meet, tongues sliding together in a slow, languid dance. Sherlock's breath hitches ever so slightly and John notices with pleasure that his partner's cock is growing hard again.
Now back at the safety of the flat, his emotions are a pendulum swinging from concerned but relieved to fuming and frustrated, and he tries desperately to get himself under control before heading upstairs where Mrs Hudson has been looking after Rosie. He isn’t quite sure why he’s so angry but suspects that it’s borne out of fear. After all he and Sherlock have been through, the thought of anything serious happening to his best friend completely terrifies him. And the thought of losing him, again…
His heart was hammering in his chest. This was his opportunity. This was the time to say the words that he'd never thought he'd be able to say to Sherlock's face, the words that he never thought Sherlock would hear. Dare he say them? Would it make things even worse? He felt a small amount of relief when he realised that they couldn't be much worse. If he weren't completely honest with Sherlock now, he may as well just walk away and wash his hands of the whole thing. But he couldn't walk away, he could never do that.
“Sherlock?” he’d said in a loud whisper, not wanting to wake his slumbering daughter. “Is that you?”
John ceased his movements immediately, instead bringing his hand up to cup Sherlock's face and stroke his cheek. He moved to Sherlock's side and wrapped his other arm around him, holding him close.
He hesitates, debating with himself about whether to bring up earlier today. Sherlock seems to be in a good mood and he doesn’t want to bring him down. But he does want to check in with him, and has to admit that part of him is still curious to know more.
John puts on his best unamused face but secretly he’s looking forward to a chance for them to work on a case, uninterrupted, just the two of them…
?” – but he can’t force the words out and before he knows it a shadow has passed across Sherlock’s face and he senses that the topic is closed, at least for now.
"Touch me, John."
“I suppose the revelation must have come as something of a surprise to you,” Sherlock is saying, snapping John out of his reverie.
"I panicked and ran towards him. Got hit by someone on a bicycle. Fell over and hit my head. Got back up and kept running towards him. Saw his body on the pavement. Saw all the blood. By the time I got there it was too late. I was too late. I tried to take his pulse, but he was gone. I don't remember much after that. They took him away, they pulled me away, wouldn't let me try to help. But it was him. I
As he pours the hot water into the waiting tea pot he feels Sherlock’s eyes remain on him for another long moment before he turns his attention back to his work.
“The detective. Sherlock.”
John is concentrating hard on pretending to read the newspaper so it takes him a few moments to register Sherlock's words.
“You and Sherlock have been through a lot together, more than a lot of friends would ever have to deal with. It’s to be expected that you might start feeling differently towards him than you would any other friend.”
He opens the Air B & B app for the address and passes John his phone. John can’t help but feel bitterly disappointed that their time together in Cambridge has come to such an abrupt end, but he knows it would be silly to say so now that they’re not here solving a case.
sound. He didn't add the part where Mycroft had shown up, done his best to console him through his own very obvious distress. He had never mentioned the part where Mycroft had taken him aside and given him Sherlock's scarf, knowing that John needed something that had been Sherlock's…something more personal than his possessions at 221B. It didn't get much more personal than an item of clothing tainted with his best friend's spilt blood. John both hated and loved Mycroft for it, because he hadn't been able to part with it ever since, hadn't even been able to wash it. He knew the attachment he had formed was unhealthy, and had therefore kept the information from his therapist. But he also knew that he didn't care an ounce so long as it provided him with even just a sliver of comfort. It still had Sherlock's scent attached to it, and John clung to it at night as though it could genuinly bring him back.
“I’ll…I’ll see you later, okay.”
"That was…amazing," he said languidly, and smiled contentedly as he felt Sherlock move to place a few tiny kisses on his neck.
"Right so you knew that the three of us were in danger, what happened then?"
"Then that's something you can worry about if you have to, but honestly, Sherlock, you boys have been through much worse together and survived. I think you owe it to yourselves to give it a chance."
Sherlock gives a tiny nod, trusting John to do what he needs to, and his full lips feel delicious against John's skin. Satisfied that Sherlock is unharmed, he puts his arms around him, kissing him luxuriously. John's hands slide into his curls, stroking soothingly, and Sherlock sighs softly into his mouth. They pull apart and Sherlock takes a shaky breath, burying himself in John's neck once more. John holds him close, stroking his silken skin soothingly, whispering sweet nothings into his ear.
John could tell that the other man was exhausted, and he suspected that it wasn't just because of the physical exertion. He wondered, with a note of concern, when Sherlock had last slept.
"You're not alone anymore, John. I'm back and I'm not going anywhere."
So he had texted Sherlock the time and place and now here he was— early and anticipating and waiting. Waiting for him, waiting for resolution, waiting for an explanation, maybe for his world to be rebuilt. No, he dared not hope for that. John looked up just as Sherlock entered the room and his heart throbbed painfully at the sight of the man he loved, who he had only seen twice in almost a full year. He was still amazed that Sherlock looked almost exactly the same as he always had when he himself felt that he had changed so much. Sherlock's hair was the same, his impressive stature as ever before, the same billowing coat with the collar that he would always turn up, much to John's amusement. Not the same scarf though, John knew. His new one was darker and distinctly less covered in blood. John shuddered ever so slightly at the memory of Sherlock's broken body, the image that hadn't faded from his mind in the past eleven months. Sherlock ordered a drink from the bar and spotted John from across the room, walked slowly towards him, no doubt trying to deduce John's state of mind from his appearance and choice of venue. If he started that John decided that he was just going to walk away. He somehow felt that Sherlock didn't have a right to know so much about him when he felt that he knew almost nothing about Sherlock.
“John, I know you need some space but I couldn’t help but notice you’d left your jacket behind…”
John said nothing for a moment, thinking intently.
John did, and Sherlock’s eyes were particularly extraordinary that night – clear and pale jade as a polished gemstone – the shadows from the warmly lit room accentuating the cheekbones and porcelain skin, framed by the intricately wild curls. He understood, admittedly not for the first time, why so many people admired Sherlock’s physical appearance.
“It’s more than that though. I find myself thinking about him…physically.” A pause. “And then there was this moment the other night…”
"I…became aware of something whilst you were...away. But it's not something I can share with you. Things are complicated enough between us"
A violent shiver runs through Sherlock and John quickly breaks away to remove his own jacket.
He returns Sherlock’s smile but quickly goes back to gazing into the fireplace, lost in his thoughts.
“Yes it is,” he agrees quietly, and John feels his frustration simmer down minutely.
“Yes,” he manages to say.
“So that’s it then is it brother?” Sherlock spits.
John smiled back, momentarily transported back to a simpler time when he and Sherlock coexisted happily (for the most part), solving cases and slipping in and out of danger. But all too soon, the issues between them came flooding back and John felt his smile fade as he sat back in his chair, taking another large gulp of his drink and noting the resultant expression that was undeniably disappointment on Sherlock's face.
“And if you…ever want to talk about it, anything I mean, you know where I am.”
He pulls out of Sherlock and flips him roughly, the man's body exhausted and pliant under his hands. Then he's pumping into his own fist once, twice, and shooting across those beautiful cheekbones, over his perfect, partially open lips. A broken moan tears through him at the sight of his lover defiled this way, the force of his orgasm blurring his vision around the edges.
“And close friend,” John adds before he can stop himself, but is relieved to note that Sherlock seems pleased with this addition.
"I love you," he whispers.
John struggles to get his thoughts in order. He’s already decided that he deeply dislikes this man, despite this happening years in the past, and feels a strong surge of protectiveness swell up inside him. There are a hundred things he wants to say (namely, to point out how wrong it was for a professor in a position of power to have any kind of relationship with a student, no matter how clever said student had been) and a thousand questions he wants answers to (exactly what kind of relationship was this? Does this mean Sherlock
“Ah, back so soon, loves?” Mrs Hudson’s voice rings out cheerfully as John enters the flat.
His voice was so sincere that John didn't doubt him, but he said nothing.
"What if I'm not? What if I disappoint you?" he asked quietly.
"Oh god yes."
"What do you want, Mycroft?"
"Its okay. You were saying?"
"So...I failed the test then, did I?"
“We don’t have to talk about it if you--”
"Fuck," Sherlock cries out, "I can't, John, I'm going to come."
John paused and let the final internal debate run its course, knowing the inevitable outcome but not quite able to hate the fact that he could never say no to Sherlock. He took a deep breath then leapt into the oblivion with absolutely no idea of where he would end up.
"He's back," John had bluntly informed his therapist, Celine, that morning.
“I think I’ll need something a bit stronger today actually,” John replied, flicking the kettle back on and reaching for the French press in one of the cupboards.
"I'm…okay. And I am incredibly relieved that you're back, just in case you didn't get that," John replied, with a slight quirk of his lip.
“The professor?” he ventures, taking a stab in the dark.
And then of course all that had been ripped away from him as Mary had died in his arms, as he watched the life leave her eyes, a large part of his going with it. Despite everything that followed, Sherlock was infallibly
He trails off, unable to complete the horrific thought.
“These scars, they’re--”
"John, please..."
“John?”
At the moment though, there’s a brief respite and things are relatively quiet, despite the lingering discord. Rosie is occupied with a new set of building blocks that John had bought her in an obvious bribe so that he can have some time to himself, Sherlock is researching for an experiment and has spent the last forty five minutes curled up in his chair, entirely engrossed in his laptop and not uttering a word, and John is seizing the blissful peace and finally starting a new book that’s been at the top of his reading list for months. If only there could be more moments like this, he thinks wistfully, like the one early this morning in which he’d awoken when the light in the room was stronger than moonlight but paler than sunlight, the day still fresh and new. When he’d opened his eyes he’d been face to face with Sherlock, both of them on their sides and facing towards each other, their hands mere centimetres apart. He’d observed Sherlock openly, revelling in this rare opportunity to watch him without being judged or deduced, seeing his features just as they were, relaxed and free from the emotionless mask Sherlock often wears or the scorn that had been present this past week in the midst of one of his Dark Moods.
He trailed off, looking at John desperately. John smiled ever so slightly, seeming to take pity on Sherlock's obvious struggle to find the right words.
And that had been that. John supposed that any arrangement that encourages Sherlock to sleep through a solid chunk of the night in a proper bed had to be a good thing. But a larger part of him enjoys it for purely selfish reasons: that warm sense of comfort and contentment that he experiences when he’s close to Sherlock, the fact that his usual nightmares have been haunting him less, and when they do they’re less intense. Neither of them have verbalised their new arrangement and there seems to be an understanding between them that any mention would mark the end of it…and John senses that neither one of them wants that. So they go on pretending that it’s perfectly normal for two friends, who are now living and working together as well as raising a child under the same roof, to share a bed some of the time despite having no real reason to do so. But in a strange way, it’s working for them, so John tries not to question it too extensively. It is what it is.
"John, I'm sorry. I don't want this to feel like a confrontation but I want to be completely honest with you now that things are…different…between us."
Sherlock only moans again in response, barely managing to lift his whisky for a sip.
"Your apology means nothing to me, Mycroft, because I don't for a minute believe that it is, or ever has been, genuine."
"There are certain things that need to be explained. Sherlock thought that it might be easier if I were here, since I played such a large role in the subject of our discussions."
An indefinable amount of minutes passed before either of them could speak or even do anything other than breathe and cling to one another, letting their awareness and surroundings slowly slip back into place. Finally, John drew Sherlock in for a soft kiss, bringing their still entwined hands up to where their hearts were still beating rapidly beside one another. His mind wildly flashed through all the times they had been beside one another, sharing an erratic heartbeat from a chase or escape or a life threatening situation. This was so different and yet so similar…the sense of danger, the adrenaline, the excitement. But there was so much more this time. So much more than he could have ever even imagined.
"Sorry, Sherlock dear, went off on a bit of a tangent there. Let me make us a nice cup of tea and we'll have a chat. What was it that you wanted to talk about?"
“Can you tell me what happened?” John presses cautiously.
Sherlock nods minutely, looking slightly reassured but still not his usual self. John tentatively slides his hand closer to Sherlock’s on the table between them, carefully monitoring his reaction before placing it atop of his. Sherlock doesn’t visibly react, but John senses a small amount of the tension slip away.
Sherlock pulled him down and kissed him again, harder this time, grinding against John slightly and moving so his legs were spread further apart. John moved his hand back down, coating his fingers with the lubricant, and resuming his gentle stroking of Sherlock's entrance as he kissed him, Sherlock still moving against him. Sherlock moaned soft and low into John's mouth and John slowly, as carefully as possible, eased a finger inside him. Sherlock made a noise that was somewhere between pain and pleasure and kissed John hard, hand planted firmly on the back of John's head. John kissed back, his tongue exploring Sherlock's mouth as he slowly moved his finger, starting to feel Sherlock relax around him. He waited until Sherlock started grinding against him before adding a second finger, once again feeling Sherlock tense and then slowly relax. He dropped his head to Sherlock's neck again, kissing and nuzzling him as he moved his fingers inside Sherlock.
"Thank you for taking care of me, John," he says in a gravelly voice, starting to drift off to sleep.
“I’m alright, Mrs Hudson, it’s only superficial, no need to fuss,” Sherlock replies impatiently, waving her away gently.
John had sighed noncommittally, but had eventually nodded his consent.
love with you."
John nodded hurriedly, struggling to get a handle on his traitorous body whose reactions were betraying him. But then again, he thought, was his mind really coping a lot better? He was reeling, unable to take in a single fragment of the information Sherlock had just given him, letting the swarm of knowledge overwhelm him and take him over despite his better efforts.
he care what people think about their relationship? Why is he so bothered by Sherlock’s relationship, such as it is, with Irene? He doesn’t even know where to begin, doesn’t even think he wants to, and he makes a mental note to schedule a therapy session this week. The inevitable guilt has already started to sink in as he dwells on their exchange – he obviously has some issues to sort through but there was no need to lose his cool with Sherlock, who has (perhaps with the exception of this past week) been astoundingly helpful, patient and kind. John heaves a deep sigh, resolving himself to go home and apologise. He’s weary, miserable and freezing, having left his jacket back at the flat in his haste to retreat, and he knows at this point that he’s only delaying the inevitable.
Sherlock shook his head, opening his eyes to look into John's.
"You're the only person who's ever made me
Sherlock looks up now, eyes narrowing as he surveys John, deducing him with practiced ease.
John nodded once. He knew that. It wasn't what was bothering him.
"Moriarty had a wide network of contacts and I haven't yet been able to rid the world of every single one of them. I've taken care of the most dangerous threats, of course, but there will be others. There are always others. And I know I can't protect you from them all. But the less you know about what happened the better."
“It’s okay, John, it’s okay, it’s not real,” Sherlock murmurs soothingly, drawing John in closer now.
His expression is uncertain in a way that John has only seen a couple of times before, and John senses Sherlock grow even tenser beside him.
“The way he looks at you. The way you look at each other. You’re lucky.”
“It can be hard facing people from your past so what you did today was very brave.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and answered him as quickly and impatiently as his current state of arousal would allow for.
“I’m going to touch and kiss and bite you all over until you can’t take it anymore. Then I’m going to throw you down on that couch, hold you down and fuck you until you scream.”
John hadn't been with anyone since a few months before Sherlock had disappeared, his situation having proven to make dating almost impossible. And after he'd gone, John had struggled to even contemplate being with anyone else, something that had been confirmed very quickly the one or two times he'd attempted a date. He'd been tested since then and knew that he was clean. He started to quietly explain this to Sherlock, who reached up and kissed him before he could finish.
His expression is so pained and compassionate that John can hardly stand it. But Sherlock’s expression remains unchanged and John can sense he’s only half with them as his mind struggles to rapidly process this information. He reaches out and carefully places his hand on Sherlock’s, his thumb stroking the skin soothingly. The gesture seems to bring Sherlock back to the present.
John let it go for the moment, too mentally drained to bother arguing the point. Besides, there was a concern that was pressing on his mind much more urgently. He turned to Mycroft.
Sherlock shrugs.
The two weeks following the news about Eurus had been unequivocally difficult. All John had to compare it to was Sherlock's grief when Irene Adler had “died”. But although some elements were the same – the unending silence, the tangible sorrow – this time he was more like a cyclone and it was all John could do to stay out of the path of destruction. Sherlock had been manic in a way that John had never seen him before, chewing through cases so quickly that John could barely keep them straight. Worryingly, Sherlock had become convinced that every case he took on had a potential link to Eurus or a hint that she was somehow involved. When one case would fail to materialise the evidence he wanted, he would frantically scour his emails and the comments on John’s blog for hours on end for potential leads, and the whole cycle would repeat itself. As much as John wanted to believe Sherlock’s deductions, as much as he usually would, he knew that he couldn’t go along with it this time. Someone needed to be on the outside, making sure they didn't both get sucked into the black hole.
Trying to take a practical approach so he could feel as though he was at least doing
It was early afternoon and Sherlock found himself knocking on Mrs Hudson's door with a very specific purpose in mind.
"Do what exactly?" he replied, sounding genuinely confused.
"I can't be sure of what I saw. As I've said before, the whole thing is a complete blur."
"So I see you've found a new place," he started, in a voice of forced calm.
"I'm so sorry for everything I've put you through," Sherlock continued, moving closer and raising his voice to be heard over the heavy rain. "I know that it's not good enough and that I should have trusted you but I don't regret what I did because you're alive and safe. But if I said that was all I ever wanted I'd be lying. And I don't want to lie to you anymore, John."
Not long after that, John had given Sherlock the most heartfelt apology he could muster, then they’d all eaten cake. Looking back, John now knew that it was the end of the horrible misfortune that had separated them and the beginning of their next chapter together. From there the only way had been up, and the months since had seen them grow closer than ever.
Sherlock squirms against him in a desperate attempt to seek some friction against his now achingly hard cock. John changes his approach, pulling Sherlock’s head roughly to the other side and kissing his way down his throat, nipping at his adam’s apple and sharp collarbone.
Having poured himself a large drink of scotch, John settled into his armchair and flicked on the telly. He stared at it blankly for a few moments then, realising that he wasn't paying even the slightest bit of attention, flicked it back off again with a sigh. His mind was racing following that afternoon's therapy session. Would Sherlock ever really learn to be able to express his emotions, his thoughts, anything? Could he learn to open up, to trust John the way John trusted him? He'd thought a lot about these questions but had not been able to come up with any definitive answer. He had the feeling that whatever he decided would have to be the final decision, the final leap into or away from Sherlock's mad world and everything that went along with it.
"Exactly," Sherlock replied, relieved that she seemed to understand without him having to say everything.
John wakes with a start, looking frantically around himself as though he’s lost something but can’t remember what. He sits up too quickly and blearily peers into Rosie’s cot. Empty. His brain struggles to fight through the morning grogginess to remember where she is – could she be with Molly or Mrs Hudson? No – then remembers that Sherlock spent the night in his bed. He’s probably taken her downstairs, John thinks, and he sits very still and listens. He makes out a barely perceptible low voice – Sherlock’s – then Rosie’s unmistakable squeal of delight.
"She's glad to have you back, Sherlock. We all are. It's a miracle."
John's mind was immediately drawn back to a particularly painful session not long after Sherlock's…fall. As the rain had fallen with reckless abandon outside the window of the neat office, she had asked John what it was that he hadn't said to Sherlock. He hadn't been able to tell her. It was too raw and infinitely too personal and he doubted that he would ever be able to express it within his own mind, let alone to anyone else. But a couple of months later, the topic had come up again.
(See the end of the chapter for
The rest of the train journey is otherwise uneventful, with Sherlock’s nerves visibly calmer now that he’s confessed his reasons to John. They exit the station and hail a cab for the short ride to the apartment Sherlock has rented for them. When they get there it’s…not what John was expecting. It’s homely and cosy without feeling cramped, immaculately and luxuriously furnished without being overthought or showy. A country home, but with a modern flare. As John drops his overnight bag onto the chair beside the king side bed in his light and airy room, he’s already feeling as though he could get used to this. He meets Sherlock in the short entrance hallway and their eyes lock.
“Alright, if you say so. I’ll see if Molly’s free to take Rosie for the weekend.”
"Harder," he managed to gasp.
“Clearly even you’ve been able to observe that I’m anxious, not a difficult deduction based on my body language and uncharacteristic silence. You’ve surely taken into account that Cambridge is where I studied and, if so, it would be reasonable to conclude that my current state of anxiety is directly linked to our destination. But what is it that’s effecting me? Could it be the fear of running into former students, perhaps some of whom I didn’t get along with? Possible, but unlikely that I’d be experiencing such apparent apprehension when taking into consideration the statistically low chance that former colleagues would happen to be in Cambridge during the same weekend we are. So it’s something that is sure to happen, directly related to the case then. And what else could it be if it’s unrelated to the college itself, nor the students?”
at all," Mrs Hudson was saying "you know how it bothers me when you tell me the particularly gruesome details of the murder victims in the cases you're investigating, and when you talk about all those nasty experiments that you're always-"
“Goodnight, Sherlock.”
He was sans coat and suit jacket, his dark shirt rolled at the sleeves and top buttons open to the warmth of the day, spoon feeding Rosie gelato from a paper cup. John laughed as some missed its target and dripped on Sherlock’s ludicrously expensive shirt and Sherlock scooped it up, not phased in the slightest, with a smile that John had come to recognise was specially reserved for his daughter. He felt a sudden surge of affection towards his friend and it occurred to him, with striking clarify, that this is where he and Rosie were meant to be.
John thrust into him hard, his world crumbling around him at the sight of Sherlock coming so deliciously undone. He tried to lock it in his mind- the way Sherlock moved against him, the noise he made with each of John's thrusts, his dark eyes and parted lips, the heaving of his chest as he struggled to suck in enough air. He knew that Sherlock was rapidly approaching the edge and that he himself wouldn't be far behind him. He trailed his lips down Sherlock's neck once again, licking and sucking then biting softly. As he did so, he moved his hand down between them, stroking Sherlock's hard cock. Sherlock gasped at the contact, hand threading into John's hair.
“I’m so sorry, John, I didn’t know what to do, I can’t just leave with Rosie-”
This time John didn't need to think at all.
“And Sherlock, one more thing…”
"No," John had replied immediately, emphatically shaking his head. "No, Sherlock, you didn't. There is absolutely no excuse for what I did. And there are no words to put it right. But all the same…I am so, so sorry."
“Alright, take my hands,” Sherlock had instructed, coming to a standstill in front of John.
Their eyes meet and they share a small smile.
“Excuse me?” Mycroft replies.
“Can I take you to bed and kiss it all better?”
“Yes, that’s it exactly,” he replies with relief, glad that he’s being understood without having to spell everything out so plainly.
Sherlock gives him a satisfied nod, and John doesn’t miss the tiny smile playing about the corners of his lips, indicating that he’s very pleased with himself indeed.

"I knew that my life was in danger. And I also knew that if I told you, you would never leave me and yours would be too. So I invented the story about Mrs Hudson, knowing that you would go running."
"I assure you that it is."
John didn't reply for a moment but didn't look away, their eyes still furiously locked on one another.
Sherlock sucks in a shuddering breath, clinging to John as though he’s afraid he’ll disappear.
“I’m fine, John. Really. It’s in the past.”
Mrs Hudson took another sip of her tea, observing him closely in a way that made him feel exposed and uncomfortable. Is this how he made others feel every time he deduced them?
"I just mean that it doesn't matter anymore. It's in the past, it's done."
John chuckles and pats his own full belly.
He finds he can’t say the word and instead blows out the breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding.
For what seems an eternity the room is silent, too silent, with the weight of Mycroft’s words hanging heavily in the air. John chances a glance at Sherlock, who looks utterly shell-shocked. It’s John who manages to speak first.
John's time at work went slowly and he spent most of it thinking about Sherlock, not that this was anything new. So he was relieved but slightly nervous when the end of his shift finally arrived and he hailed a taxi to take him to the oh-so-familiar flat on Baker Street. He asked the driver to stop part of the way down the street so that he could pick up a nice bottle of red, and as he walked the rest of the length to their old flat he found himself second guessing that decision, his decision to come here, every decision he had made since Sherlock had come back. He firmly told himself to stop thinking so much, to relax, to breathe…this was
John gave him a small smile.
“Do you feel that those closest to you would accept you for who you are, whoever that may be?”
Sherlock nods against him but doesn’t seem ready to speak. He clings to him, trembling, and John trails soft kisses across his brow and eyelids then on his cheeks.
“He loves you too, you know.”
“You love him, don’t you?”
“Is it okay if I touch you now?”
To John’s immense relief, the living situation was working out remarkably well. In many ways, it felt like he had never left, with he and Sherlock easily slipping back into their routines (or lack thereof, in Sherlock’s case), their tea and takeaway, sometimes talking about cases, other times nothing in particular, sometimes enjoying comfortable silence in the evenings as John watched crap telly or read and Sherlock sat very still thinking then furiously tapped away at his phone or laptop. But then, on the other hand, there was Rosie. Whilst John had never seen Sherlock be anything less than charming and patient with his daughter, and trusted him with her implicitly, he had to admit he’d been nervous about the combination of Sherlock and a baby under the same roof.
“Things have been…a bit challenging at times, I know,” he continues, “so I want you to know how much I appreciate everything you’ve been doing for me and Rosie.”
“This isn’t
"John. So good to see you," Mycroft said in his impeccable accent, his voice as smooth and controlled as John had ever heard it, and extended a hand towards John to shake his hand.
He gave John a tiny smile and John felt a pang in his heart at the complete vulnerability of the man standing before him. But following just as quickly came a violent spike of the anger that he needed to cope with this situation, and he involuntarily let out a short bark of laughter.
"Talk about these trivial things that don't matter. Yes I have a new place. It was too hard to go home. I went there once to get my stuff. I couldn't even go through yours, not really, I let Mrs Hudson take care of that."
“Sherlock?” he whispers, in case he’s wrong.
His tone much gentler than John is used to hearing from him, which only serves to make him feel worse. John lets them into the flat, deposits his overnight bag at the foot of the stairs and heads to the kitchen to sort out tea, though something tells him they’ll need something stronger. When he comes back into the living room with a tray of mugs, he finds Mycroft settled in Sherlock’s chair and takes a seat next to Sherlock on the couch. John passes a sugary tea to Sherlock and takes a sip of his own, surveying Mycroft carefully.
John doesn’t reply but can’t deny that a tiny ray of hope has been illuminated within him.
“Ready as I’ll ever be,” Sherlock says with a sigh.
Sherlock said nothing but John heard the poorly concealed sharp intake of breath, felt the tiny nod against him.
Another loaded pause.
"No it's not you, it felt wonderful, I just got...overwhelmed with all the new data...too many new sensations...I couldn't take it all in, and I panicked," he explained slowly, sounding more like himself now.
Sherlock wouldn't meet his eyes and John briefly wondered if he was being too harsh. Why was this so fucking hard? He almost smiled at that— he knew why, he knew exactly why. He sighed heavily and reached across the small table to touch Sherlock's hand.
"Shh, it's not real, it's okay now."
His tone is calm but John can hear the concealed warning, a sign that his tolerance of the topic is wearing thin. John decides not to push it. The night has been hard enough for both of them and he had never expected this. He draws his hand lightly over the scarred skin again in what he hopes is a soothing gesture. He’s sure it’s clumsy and he isn’t even sure why he’s doing it. He just doesn’t know what else to do as thoughts invade his head and consume him.
“Yes, I’m alive, John, I’m here. It’s okay, it was just a nightmare.”
John retreats to the bathroom, rifles through the cabinet for his medical supplies, and returns to stand in front of his patient. Sherlock makes a tiny noise in his throat as John applies some antiseptic liquid that stings but John is pleased that he’s otherwise remarkably well behaved. He gently presses his fingers into the flesh around the wound, checking for swelling and making sure there’s been no muscle injury.
. The thought had popped into John’s head before he’d been able to stop it, and John had felt himself blush, furiously registering that Sherlock had almost certainly not missed it. He had hoped that Sherlock had interpreted it as John’s embarrassment over the awkwardness of the situation and his own ineptitude and not the far more humiliating truth.
so long?”. He feels anger lick at his sides again, but for a completely different reason to earlier that night. Sherlock, of course, doesn’t miss his underlying meaning.
"We knew that the time had come," Mycroft took over smoothly. "Sherlock asked me to feed Moriarty the information about himself, knowing that Moriarty would use it to destroy him. I was reluctant, as you can imagine, but it was the only way. So I complied, then I released him, and Sherlock and I awaited the fall that we knew was inevitable."
He thinks of something but isn’t sure whether to offer, torn between wanting to help and not wanting to overstep any boundaries.
“A little tender but otherwise fine, just as you said it would be.”
John shuffles about the kitchen, attempting to find the dinner plates and having much less success than Sherlock had with the glasses. He finally locates them and before long there’s a sprawling feast of dumplings, spring rolls, pork buns, rice and noodles, which they devour as though it’s their first meal in weeks.
"Oh dear, who is it this time? Not another one that has two wives and as many girlfriends?"
"So Sherlock managed to convince his best friend that he was dead. How do you think he managed that?"
John nods, trying to process his thoughts.
“Then you have to consider whether or not it really matters what strangers think of you. You might come to find that the person judging you the most is yourself,” she says gently.
“I just…”
"I don't think I can," he said carefully, not trusting his own voice.
“Stay with me. Please?”
"If you decide to see him again do you know what you might want to say? Or what you might need to say?"
And then the intensity kicked up another notch, Sherlock's nimble fingers making quick work of John's shirt buttons and sliding his hands over the skin of John's chest. John moaned softly, his lips recapturing Sherlock's in a passionate, frenzied kiss. Both shirtless now, their hands explored each others bodies freely, fingers grazing nipples and hot lips sliding over warm flesh. John found himself involuntarily grinding against Sherlock's hips, feeling his hardness through his trousers and he reached for the button, wanting more,
John cuts himself off as the light catches Sherlock’s back in a certain way, revealing the full extent of the scarring, and has to stop himself from letting out a gasp. There’s a plethora of scarring that seems to span the full length of Sherlock’s back, some scars deeper than others, some longer, some too perfectly round or symmetrical to be random. The scars look patterned,
“God, I want you so much, I want to make you mine,” John pants.
“Thank you.”
John takes his hand off Sherlock’s mouth and grips both hips firmly, starting a steady rhythm of thrusting as Sherlock writhes and gasps beneath him.
It wasn’t until all was said and done, and John had practically collapsed into his old armchair as Rosie napped upstairs after a long day of moving, that John registered just how surreal it felt to be once again living at Baker Street. He glanced at Sherlock – curled up comfortably on his chair across from John, silk dressing gown wrapped around him, engrossed in something on his laptop – and allowed himself a small smile.
John nods in agreement, suddenly feeling exhausted at the possibilities.
“I’m sorry you had to go through that,” John says, his voice rough and barely above a whisper.
An hour and several episodes of
Sherlock just hums, not looking up from his work and clearly barely even aware that John is there, and John can’t help but chuckle. He flicks on the kettle and leans against the kitchen bench with his arms folded as he waits for it to boil, letting his eyes linger on his flatmate. Sherlock is standing at the table in the centre of the room, his eyes alert and trained downwards to the paperwork he’s absorbed in. He’s wearing the dark purple shirt today, the one that John can’t help but notice each time he wears it. The shirt fits him particularly snugly and the colour complements his skin tone in a way that John can’t quite place. Tonight, the shirt has been rolled up at the sleeves, the collar left carelessly unbuttoned, exposing what seems like miles of alabaster skin of his impossibly long neck.
John nods, acknowledging that, yes, it’s certainly partially about Mary and Rosie. But, at the same time, it’s more than that.
John said nothing for a moment, then everything clicked into place and his face changed to one of utter disbelief, of his world crumbling around him for the millionth time that week.
They exchange small smiles.
Currently John is sat in his chair, flicking through the paper that he’d run out of time to read that morning. He’s resolutely trying to ignore the fact that Sherlock is practically draped over his own chair, his long legs dangling gracefully over one side, and wearing what appears to be a new silk robe and matching pyjama bottoms in a flattering shade of blue so rich it was almost black. It reminds John of the section of the ocean that transitions from shallow to very deep, and the way it looks against Sherlock’s otherwise bare skin is nothing short of criminal. Again, if Sherlock notices anything amiss he says nothing, seemingly absorbed in his emails on the laptop that is perched in his lap.
“Correct,” Sherlock says with a nod, “I’ve already said I admired him and that we grew to become close. But what I didn’t disclose is that our relationship was of a nature that would be considered to be…
"I made sure that you would see me fall but not land. You saw what I needed you to see. I asked Molly to place a body disguised as me on the sidewalk. And with Mycroft's help she was able to forge the death and autopsy records."
He chances a quick glance at Sherlock, who looks a little taken aback but pleased at the same time. When he speaks, his words are once again careful, considered.
"There's nothing you can do," John replied coldly, abruptly cutting off the thoughts in his head. "Just go. I'll...talk to you tomorrow."
But whilst Sherlock had forgiven him with such grace, it hadn’t been so easy for John to forget. He was acutely aware that it wasn’t the first time he had touched Sherlock with violence and was ashamed to recall his reaction when Sherlock had “returned from the dead”. The recollections still gnawed at him in both his waking and sleeping hours. They had piled onto the already extraordinary amount of guilt he carried with him – over Mary’s death and his affair, such as it was, over not being a good enough father to Rosie and not being a good enough friend – and compounded with his grief to sit like a dead weight around his shoulders and lead within his stomach.
"Fine, whatever, let's just get this over with then," John replied sharply, causing Sherlock's expression to abruptly change to one of hurt.
feeling this morning?” Sherlock asks finally.
"Please, John," he begs brokenly, swallowing hard.
“We should get some sleep,” John says, waiting for Sherlock’s murmur of agreement before reaching to switch off the bedside lamp.
John tries to find his voice, something within him too scared to speak, and his heart seems to be beating at three times its normal rate.
"Please say something, Sherlock."
"Does that feel alright?" he whispered into Sherlock's hair.
"Its okay, John. Just breathe."
John nodded and took another deep breath, had another gulp of coffee.
John drew back, nodded.
“Alright there?” he enquires and Sherlock manages a nod.
Sherlock’s eyes unexpectedly flicker up to his, their pale jade glittering subtly in the subdued light.
He undoes it most of the way and shrugs out of it, leaving his shoulders exposed but his back largely covered, and sits on the arm of his leather chair silently as John examines him.
“Now, Sherlock,” John barks, then immediately regrets the harshness of his tone as he registers that Sherlock looks slightly taken aback.
John struggled to do as Sherlock instructed, and finally managed to get his breathing somewhat back to normal. He had hoped that the panic attacks had gone for good, but apparently Sherlock was still more than capable of inducing them, whether dead or alive. When Sherlock was suitably convinced that John wasn't going to pass out he retired to the kitchen to make tea and was grateful to see that John was looking much more like himself when he returned, two mugs in hand. He handed one to John, who smiled weakly and took a sip.
The day after that he had decided that the longer he waited, the worse things would be. But he didn't want Sherlock to come to his flat again. He'd discussed it with Celine and had identified that he'd felt too overwhelmed and trapped when Sherlock had shown up there. And there was certainly no way he was ready for a meeting at 221B. To his mind, the place seemed to be a physical representation of everything he had been through in the past eleven months, a place that he had been forced to accept held nothing but painful memories and empty promises of someone who was gone from his world forever. Celine had suggested that they meet in a neutral environment and John had quickly decided that this was a good idea.
“Mind telling us what this is all about, dear brother?” Sherlock says, trying his best to sound impatient, but even John can tell that it’s a cover for his sudden nerves.
“It hasn’t yet been recovered from the waters surrounding Sherrinford. Given weather conditions at the time of the event, and the overall treacherous conditions surrounding Sherrinford, it is possible that her body may never be recovered.”
"We've booked the apartment for the weekend after all," he rationalised as John had attempted to pick his jaw up off the floor.
“You remember your safe word, yes?” John murmurs against his neck.
“It’s okay, I believe you,” John says in hushed tones.
The next thing John knew, they were back at Baker Street, kissing in the familiar and blissfully dry hallway. Sherlock pushed him against the wall in a way that was just the right mix of playful and forceful and John's breath hitched as Sherlock lent back in for another kiss, his weight pressing pleasantly against John. And it was amazing and all he'd been wanting and craving and it was oh so good and then…someone close by clearing their throat pointedly. They both stopped reluctantly and turned slowly to be greeted by the sight of Mrs Hudson standing outside her doorway with her arms folded. Her warm coat, handbag and umbrella suggested that she was just about to head out.
“Mmm, I’m awake. I’m evidently exhausted but can’t seem to get to sleep. Too tense, too much going through my mind. It’s quite frustrating,” comes the weary reply.
“Am I going to have to subdue you, Sherlock?”
John had cautiously floated the idea of moving back in with Sherlock, who had immediately agreed and had been beyond wonderful throughout the whole process. Though slightly flabbergasted and vaguely wondering what had happened to the sociopath he once knew, John was utterly appreciative of everything Sherlock had done for him and Rosie.
It’s a simple question but John reads it for what it really is – a challenge.
“It just…it doesn’t make sense. I’ve never…had these feelings towards…a man before.”
"I think I do. I just don't know how. It seems…too big."
“It’s certainly possible and it does happen. It doesn’t mean that you need to start thinking about yourself differently or labelling yourself in any particular way,” she says in her sensible but reassuring way.
“There’s nothing wrong with that, John.”
They manage to shakily climb to their feet and out of the bath, helping each other briefly rinse off in the shower before towelling off and making it to Sherlock's bed, falling between the blissfully clean sheets and kissing lazily. John settles back, with Sherlock resting on his chest and drawing small circles on John's skin with his long fingers, heavy eyelids already slipping closed.
“Have some tea, it will help.”
"Mrs Hudson, can I, uh, talk to you about something?" he asked when she opened the door, not sounding remotely like himself even to his own ears.
"Yes, please, John," he chokes out. John's hand reaches Sherlock’s cock, wrapping around it slowly and deliberately, and Sherlock shivers with pleasure.
John sighs.
John found himself even more annoyed to recognise that Sherlock was acting nothing like how John remembered him. Where was the strong, defiant, arrogant sod that he had known and...he forced his thoughts away from the word. What had happened to that man? John couldn't help but feel that this whole thing would be easier if he were to reappear.
“Why don’t you tell me a bit more about the argument you mentioned?” she eventually prompts.
“I guess with today’s situation I can kind of see where you’re coming from,” he says, still thinking of Brian’s unrequited love.
He thinks back to their argument and some of the new information it revealed.
“We’re what?” Sherlock cuts in abruptly.
They head out the door and towards the university grounds, and although John notices the pointed way Sherlock fastens his scarf around his neck and turns up his coat collar, he has the good grace not to say anything.
And he didn't even care how that sounded or about the fact that he never thought he had never before admitted to wanting, let alone needing anyone, ever. But this was John. John who changed all the rules, who made him feel things he didn't even know he was capable of. John didn't reply - instead kissing Sherlock softly but in a way that promised delicious things to come - and Sherlock hummed contently. They stayed that way for several moments, all gentle kisses and soft caresses, until things started heating up again. John pulled away, moving to finish removing Sherlock's trousers and boxers then his own, then straddling Sherlock's hips. He hardly knew what he was doing but it didn't seem to matter and he didn't feel nervous, just euphoric with a strong, sublime edge of adrenaline. He slowly stripped Sherlock of his shirt, kissing his way down his neck, his teeth grazing the sharp collarbones, his tongue dipping into the hollow where Sherlock's neck met his chest. Then he made his way further down, only now properly realising that they were both completely naked now, completely exposed to one another. He took a moment to admire Sherlock's body- the vast expanse of creamy flesh, the toned muscles, the pronounced hollows and hip bones. He trailed kisses down Sherlock's chest as Sherlock's fingertips carded through his hair, stopping at his left nipple and kissing it tenderly. Sherlock's soft moan turned into a hiss when John sucked it into his mouth, using his teeth ever so slightly to tease the sensitive flesh. He continued this as he allowed his hand to roam down Sherlock's body to his half hard cock, touching him lightly. He stroked him slowly for a few moments, moving his attentions to Sherlock's right nipple, and felt Sherlock's erection growing. John was also getting harder and harder, and he rubbed himself against Sherlock's thigh as he tightened his grip on Sherlock.
Sherlock inhales sharply, his pupils blown out and glittering with his arousal at John’s words.
"Thank you for meeting with me. I was worried that…" - he trailed off, staring down at his drink - "that you wouldn't want to."
“People would
He forced himself to pull away from Sherlock, only now feeling self-conscious about the state he was in and how he must look. Sherlock was staring at the ground, and for that brief moment John almost felt again that the man in front of him was a complete stranger. And in some ways he was. John took another deep, steadying breath.
John had done so without hesitation and with only the slightest blush, and Sherlock had easily swept them into a rhythmic pace. As he did his best to keep up with Sherlock’s effortless steps, he couldn’t help but feel a tiny bit lucky that he – and only he – got to see this side of Sherlock. He kept his eyes trained on his and Sherlock’s feet, mind struggling as it willed his body to follow along.
"With Moriarty dead I had no choice but to carry out my plan to fake my own death."
Sherlock smiled at John as he removed his coat and scarf and sat down at the opposite side of the small table.
“Cake,” John had confirmed with a nod.
“Thanks for this,” he says, making a gesture to indicate the drink, the apartment, the weekend, and everything else.
Between everything else, he and Sherlock been working on cases, though this had been challenging without a proper base. There had been nothing beyond a five really, and though Sherlock had proclaimed case after case to be “dull” and barely worthy of his time, John couldn’t help but notice that these condemnations were made with far less disgust than they had been in the past. John could hardly blame him, feeling less than enthused himself at the prospect of jumping right back into the deep end after everything that had happened.
“I’m glad, John,” Sherlock replies quietly.
John sat in a small corner table of the quiet pub he'd chosen as a meeting venue, tapping the table nervously with the fingers of one hand and clutching a pint of beer in the other. He absently realised that he always seemed to have a drink in his hand…he supposed it was another comfort, another way of coping, another addiction. It didn't seem to matter whether it was alcoholic or not, though he had to admit that he was consuming more of that these past eleven months than he had in a long time. After his counseling session he had managed to pluck up the courage to answer Sherlock's text.
“You made me feel things again,” Sherlock continues in a deep voice, “and life became confusing and exciting and frustrating and marvellous. And then of course Mary and Rosie came along and, well, you know how I feel about them.”
"I also managed to procure a small amount of the drug that you had both been exposed to at Dartmoor," the older Holmes brother continued calmly. "I knew that it would come in handy at some point…a suspicion that was proven correct, as Sherlock has already explained to you."
"I know that it's hard for you to talk about that day, John, but it's important that you try. I think you'll find that it helps."
Sherlock’s eyes meet John’s eyes briefly.
Then, “very well, if you must.” Another pause. “Yes. Yes. See you soon.”
“Given that I've never shown any apparent interest in relationships, have determinedly rejected sentiment and insisted that I'm married to my work.”
"Just the way I like it," he said approvingly, almost sadly.
“I never meant for you to know about this.”
John longed to close that gap, so he did. Because sometimes actions spoke louder than words. Their lips met, softly at first, but it wasn't long before the build up of emotions were pouring into the kiss, intensifying it quickly. Their tongues met sensuously and passionately as the rain dripped from their soaked hair onto their faces, mingling with the taste of their kiss. John slowly pulled away, coming to his senses enough to realise how ridiculous they were- kissing like a couple of teenagers in the middle of a busy London street, in a god damn monsoon-like rainstorm, no less. John laughed lightly and revelled in how good it felt.
And with that he snuggled into John's chest, allowing his heavy eyelids to slip shut finally, basking in the unfamiliar and terrifying yet strangely wonderful feeling of being loved.
“I was naive but I knew what I wanted, even then, and I wasn't afraid to go after it.”
“I’m so sorry, Sherlock,” Mycroft finishes.
"There will no doubt be time for that later," Sherlock replied in the especially deep voice that drove John mad with desire. "Right now I want to feel you...I want to be close to you...I just want you, John. I need you. And I trust you completely, I want you to know that."
“Why do you even care? You’re the one who encouraged me to text her back.”
“Don’t pretend you want normalcy, John, when you know as well as I do what happens when you try to seek that out.”
John turns and pulls back the covers on the other side of the bed and Sherlock climbs in gracefully then lies on his back, tilting his head towards John’s so they’re facing each other in the darkness.
And then John pulled Sherlock's mouth back to his and was touching every bit of Sherlock he could reach, hastily and clumsily unbuttoning the purple shirt and moving the silky fabric aside to feel the perfect, sensuous skin underneath. Then he was trailing kisses down Sherlock's neck, intoxicated by his scent, and dragging his teeth across those too-prominent collar bones. Sherlock moaned in a way that drove John crazy. He couldn't remember ever wanting someone more. He froze, momentarily stunned by the plethora of feelings for this man beneath him- he simultaneously wanted to devour him and never take his eyes off him again. Sherlock noticed John's confusion and reached up to gently stroke his face.
"I got out of the cab opposite St Bart's, tried calling Sherlock again. Got through this time. Finally. He started talking about how he was a fraud, trying to convince me that when we first met he knew what he knew because he'd researched me."
John considered him for a moment before answering.
John’s stomach lurches again as he thinks of the horrific treatment Sherlock must have suffered through.
John looked down, his breath hitching in his throat, tears pricking his eyes and threatening to fall.
“Let’s move on,” she says, “do you find yourself feeling concerned about being judged by others?”
John huffs out another short laugh at Sherlock’s reference to his now very mobile daughter, but he’s so exhausted that it doesn’t long for sleep to claim him once more.
Sherlock sighs as John gently kisses down his neck, stroking his chest and teasing his nipples lightly with one hand as he rubs him with the other. Before long Sherlock is moaning and writhing in his arms, finally crying out John's name as he gives into his pleasure and climaxes hard. John strokes him through it, feeling the waves of pleasure radiating from his lover, and draws him into another gloriously tender kiss. He rests his lips at Sherlock's hairline, hand running through his curls. His weight against John is heavy and John can feel his complete exhaustion.
He felt Sherlock nod against his head, resuming his gentle stroking of John's hair and shoulders.
He moved to the small couch and gestured for Sherlock to sit beside him, and they drank their tea in near silence, John still trying to process everything.
"What I meant to say is that things are...different between us. Since I returned."
My sincere apologies for the big delay between chapters. I was busy planning my wedding, getting married, and going on my honeymoon! I'm back on track now so will be posting regular updates again, though we're only a few chapters from the finish now. Thanks for your support and, as always, I'd love to hear your feedback and thoughts.
"What do you need?" John asks softly, drawing him closer still and placing a tender kiss on his brow.
"My homeless network. Mycroft. Molly Hooper."
John nods, he already knew this but needed to hear it. Ella seems to sense his reluctance to dissect this particular topic any further at the moment, and changes tact.
“All ready to go?” Sherlock says, and John nods his assent and drains the last of his drink before following him towards the door.
"There were very clear indications that you were lying. Not ones that would necessarily be picked up by an ordinary person but to people trained to read the signs, yes, you would have failed."
“Oh gosh, Sherlock, look at you! What have you done to yourself?” Mrs Hudson frets, rushing over to him to get a better look at the wound on his shoulder.
“I know I didn’t know you back then,” John says quietly, “but I do know there are aspects of your past that you’re less than proud of, we all have them, I sure as hell do. Just know that I’m not judging you and that I will never…get bored of you.”
Sherlock shivers, unable to speak, as John resumes his assault of Sherlock’s throat, his free hand coming up to tangle in Sherlock’s curls.
"Come to bed,” John requests again, “for me?"
John's glance shifted from Mycroft to Sherlock, noting his pained expression, and back again.
"But I have a few conditions. Firstly, you never keep me in the dark again, no matter what the circumstances. If we're going to do this we need to do it together. Secondly, you make more of an effort to tell me what's going on in that head of yours. I know it's hard for you but if we're going to be in a relationship it's the only way. It's all or nothing…just like it always has been."
He breaks away to softly kiss Sherlock’s neck, stretched out long against him, his hand sliding slowly down Sherlock's chest once more.
“You’re not exactly in a position to be making demands,” John points out, gripping his hips more firmly.
"God you're beautiful."
He wasn't sure what he was thanking Sherlock for. For coming back? For the means to be able to contact him? For the assurance that Sherlock would be there? For giving him space? John didn't know. All he'd known was that he wasn't ready to see Sherlock face to face again, not yet, but he had also known that he couldn't just let Sherlock suffer with no clue of John's thoughts. Then he'd almost snorted with laughter at his naive assumption that Sherlock could ever have no clue about something, especially when it came to his thoughts. Had he forgotten who he was dealing with?
Sherlock's voice was a throaty whimper laced with raw pain and more than a hint of vulnerability, and it seemed to shake John out of the trap that his mind had fallen into.
“Lock!” Rosie exclaims, clapping her hands enthusiastically.
"I trust you."
“It’s okay, Mrs Hudson,” John says, sounding far calmer than he feels.
His eyes were closed, but part way through the piece they fluttered open and met John's with an intensity that John wasn't sure how to handle, but neither of them looked away, and Sherlock kept playing and then—
Sherlock and John toppled onto the couch, still clinging to one another, and John tried to land gracefully on top, half succeeding and splaying his hands on either side of Sherlock to support his weight. He lent down towards the man beneath him and kissed him hard, their tongues sliding against each other, his teeth nipping softly at Sherlock's full lower lip. Sherlock reached for the bottom of John's jumper and pulled it over his head, throwing it aside and taking advantage of the easier access by sliding his warm hands part way up John's back. John moaned softly into Sherlock's mouth and couldn't even bring himself to feel self-conscious about it.
"Shh don't apologise, it's fine, I shouldn't have rushed you."
"How are you, John?" he questioned lightly, looking genuinely concerned.
“Nuh uh, get back here, Sherlock, I’m not done with you,” he says sternly, and Sherlock has the good sense to stop in his tracks and return silently to the living room.
"No. Mrs Hudson is...well, she's angry with me, John. Quite understandably. So I've been staying at a hotel on Glentworth Street." He sniffed. "She'll come around. I need to lay low for awhile anyway, for obvious reasons."
"You didn't have to..."
He was slightly annoyed with himself, had been ever since he had asked Sherlock to leave. He had so many questions to ask about what had happened, about how Sherlock was alive, about Moriarty and his men, about Mycroft and everyone else they knew. Had Mycroft known all this time? The thought caused anger to lick at John's insides hungrily. Mycroft had seemed so genuinely grief stricken, so plagued with guilt. But then again, he was a Holmes, and if he knew one thing about the Holmes' it was that they were never to be underestimated. But he hadn't asked Sherlock anything— just his presence in John's life after all these months of angst had been more than enough to process. John wasn't as strong as he once was. He was barely even a whole person anymore. And so, after Sherlock had left John had collapsed into his armchair and hadn't moved again for a long time, his mind reeling and still not quite believing that it hadn't all been another of his dreams (nightmares?) where Sherlock had come back to him, normally only to be taken away again just as quickly. Finally a noise coming from the direction of the coffee table had roused John back into conscious thought and he had vaguely looked around and realised that it was his phone. A text message.
His lover is trembling hard beneath him and John knows he'll need some serious care to recover this time. He strokes Sherlock's beautiful face, licking away the remnants of his own release and pulling him into a slow and gentle kiss. Before they can get too comfortable, John's reaching underneath with the intention of carefully checking Sherlock. Though he's made a habit of this whenever they have rough sex, Sherlock still whimpers quietly, burying his face in John's neck.
talk if they heard about this,” John can’t help but say.
This chapter was going to wind up being waaaay too long, so I've split it into two parts.
Sherlock finally finds his voice, though is sounds small and weak and barely recognisable as his own. He can't even bring himself to care, mind almost completely blank for once as he processes everything that has just happened.
John didn't reply for a moment. It had been eleven months but that day still haunted him like it was yesterday. Though his memory of it was hazy, tainted by shock and disbelief and a million other things, it didn't stop his mind from replaying it every single night whilst he slept. It was far worse than any of the dreams of Afghanistan had ever been.
"I have no idea what came over me, I barely even remember what happened. I was out of control, I was-"
“John, please, oh god,” he pants, fighting against the restraints that bind his arms.
to cover it. You don't know what it was like for me. You were my best friend and my world and you saved my life in so many ways and then you were gone and I was alone again only this time I knew what I was missing out on, what my life could be…what it was…with you."
He absently changed the channel and quickly skipped past a detective show. He couldn't watch those, not anymore. Not without Sherlock sitting beside him, or curled up in his favourite chair, deducing the characters and motivations and spoiling the 'mystery' before the episode was even ten minutes through. John turned his attention away from the television, leaving it on as background noise, to the book on the coffee table beside him. He had found it on the top of a stack of books on Sherlock's beside table the day after... the fall...and had been unable to part with it ever since. It was a thick, hardcover book on the topic of beekeeping. When John had first found it he couldn't help but snort with laughter at the mental picture it conjured up of Sherlock in bee keeping garb, desperately trying to convince John to let him turn their storage cupboard into a beehive. He might have even let him.
“Who?”
"John," Sherlock said carefully, the simple stating of his name seeming to carry on its back a thousand unspoken thoughts.
"John, I can't hold on, I'm going to.."
"If you really want me to. I'm a bit out of practice though— I've barely picked one up in a year."
John nodded, pulling his head back up to meet Sherlock's eyes.
“I guess that would be a reasonable deduction based on the evidence.”
Sherlock hums against him, considering this offer.
"John, please," Sherlock cried out brokenly.
John walks back towards the lounge room, closes his eyes and forces himself to heave in a deep breath and collect himself before scooping up Rosie from her playpen. She protests bitterly as John perches her on his hip and grabs her nappy bag on the way towards the exit. He gives Sherlock one final glance.
“Sorry, you talking to me?” he asks, lowering the newspaper to his lap and looking over at Sherlock, whose face is still buried in his laptop.
After that, Sherlock silently taps away at his phone, leaving John to his thoughts.
He keeps up his punishing rhythm, attacking Sherlock’s neck mercilessly as the detective meets his thrusts and moans with abandon.
. But Sherlock was nothing if not unpredictable and John (mostly) found it fascinating to learn more about his enigmatic best friend. He fondly remembers their first dancing lesson. Sherlock had first demonstrated the movement as John had stood there somewhat awkwardly, already feeling clumsy and inadequate compared to the other man, who somehow managed to look impossibly graceful whilst wearing pyjamas and a dressing gown.
“What does it matter if we share a bed? No, really. We’re already sharing a flat, a child, every other aspect of our damn lives.”
John laughed again but felt his chest tighten as they entered the room and he took note of just how similar everything looked. A lot of Sherlock's possessions had been packed up by Mrs Hudson after his 'death' but she had evidently been unable to give them away, just as she had been unable to rent the flat out to anyone new when it came down to it. John quickly noted that the couch, armchair, coffee table and the union jack pillow that he had always been fond of were still here. But not the skull. John had the skull sitting on the chest of drawers in his bedroom, along with the beekeeping book and a few other items that he had been unable to part with. He would have to bring them back now, he decided. That also explained the reappearance of the shirt- Mrs Hudson must have kept some of Sherlock's particularly treasured items of clothing. John found himself disturbingly grateful to her for keeping that particular item. Sherlock watched him carefully but kept quiet, evidently not sure exactly how to proceed and waiting for John to make the next move.
"One best friend," he clarified with a smile.
“No,” Sherlock repeats, rapidly getting to his feet.
"John might be a bit of a romantic and occasionally wear his heart on his sleeve...but he's not silly, Sherlock. He won't expect you to change just because your relationship has. And he won't want you to either, I'd wager," she explained softly, her warm, sincere eyes meeting Sherlock's.
“Has it occurred to you that just because you’re finding yourself attracted to him doesn’t mean that you’re gay?”
Of course she is, John thought hopelessly.
"Well, I forgive you, John. Completely and unreservedly," Sherlock had replied quietly in his low baritone.
"Wait until you hear what I have to say, and then tell me that," Sherlock grimly, his low voice, his eyes not meeting John's.
"Think very carefully about what exactly you saw, John. I went to great lengths to convince you that was you saw was real. But it wasn't me on that sidewalk, it wasn't me who you buried."
He’d noticed that evening that the chill in the air, which had been present for the past several weeks in London, had become more intense, a thinly veiled promise that winter would once again be upon them before long. They both shed their jackets and shoes and adjourned in the living room, so different from their own but still welcoming and pleasant. They're sitting side by side on the plush sofa and John has just finished shooting off a quick check in text to Molly when Sherlock produces a bottle of whisky.
"You haven't done this before, have you Sherlock?" he asked breathlessly, his fingers tracing Sherlock's hip bones and his eyes trying to read his face.
Sherlock looks like he’s been slapped, not managing to hide his surprise at the deeply personal question. He attempts to force his features back into something neutral, but there’s anger licking at the edges of the expressionless mask.
"I think you should go, Sherlock," he heard himself say in a voice that sounded as wrecked as he felt.
“You should get some sleep,” John murmurs, his fingers still gently carding through Sherlock’s hair.
“Strip down and wrap yourself in this. I’m going to get a fire going, get you nice and warm yeah?”
At this John has a strong visual of the terrible scene. The pale figure standing at the cliff edge, the furious wind whipping her hair and white dress, her face as she plunged to her untimely death.
, John had thought, once again unable to stop the word from entering his mind. He’d forced himself to roll away, lie on his back, and not think about the fact that watching his best friend sleep was
His voice was strained with emotion and his grip on John's good shoulder increased to the point of almost being painful.
“What makes you say that?”
Ella regards him thoughtfully before speaking.
"Okay, so what happened then?"
"I'm sorry, John," he said into John's neck, his voice muffled.
“She was mentally ill, Sherlock,” Mycroft interrupts, his voice cautious but certain.
Sherlock's new number then. The message had been simple, direct, and to the point, like the detective himself so often was. But John had known that 'I'll be here' was an assurance that Sherlock wasn't going away again, at least not anytime soon. And that had been enough for the time being. John had put the phone back down without saving Sherlock's name back into it and had fallen into a restless slumber, too exhausted to move from his armchair.
John laughed lightly.
Sherlock didn't move, his gaze dropping to the floor once more.
Sherlock blushes furiously now and, despite himself, John can’t help but find it endearing to see him so shy and uncertain, it’s so unlike his usual overconfidence and arrogance. He nods encouragingly, and Sherlock seems sufficiently reassured to continue.
"He didn't want to go through with it, you know," Mycroft said suddenly.
“Is this about our recently formed habit of sharing a bed?”
John found himself pausing in between kisses to kiss Sherlock's face, whispering absently as he did so.
At this, the overwhelming desire to take Sherlock in his arms intensifies, but instead John drops to his knees in front of his friend.
“The flat is clean. I made sure of it before I brought you both back from Cambridge to break the news.”
Sherlock's face was a mixture of surprise and hurt and something approaching relief, but whether it was relief at John's outpouring of emotion or relief that Sherlock was finally getting what his guilt told him he deserved, John wasn't sure. John stared into those incredible blue eyes that had once been his whole world and tried to fight the flood of emotions threatening to overwhelm him. Anger was battling hurt and betrayal and something else that he couldn't even identify. And yet, the close proximity to the man that he had been dreaming about, missing, craving, for the past eleven months was causing his heart to race in a way that had nothing to do with his anger. His senses were filled with everything irrevocably Sherlock: his subtle, strangely appealing scent, his thin yet muscular body beneath John's hands, the pale warm skin beneath the layers of clothing.
"I don't know."
John’s head flicks up and he fights against the urge to protest.
He forces himself out of bed with a sigh, deciding he’s delayed the inevitable for long enough. At least it’s Saturday and he can take his time getting himself and Rosie ready. Then maybe a visit to the playground, he thinks, if the weather is pleasant enough. He pulls on his robe and slippers and plods down the stairs to the kitchen. Despite his drowsiness, the sight he sees brings a genuine smile to his face. Rosie sits in her high chair, cheerfully dunking a biscuit in her “tea” – a special concoction of warm milk and a tiny bit of chai that he and Sherlock make especially for her so she doesn’t make a fuss when they drink their own tea. She has her special plastic tea cup and saucer and is completely unconcerned about the mess she’s made with her partially crumbled shortbread. So is Sherlock, it seems. He’s leaning lazily against the kitchen counter in his silk dressing gown, his own favourite tea cup in hand, reading to Rosie from
“Thank you,” Sherlock says again.
John gets back to work, kissing his way down Sherlock’s throat and chest down to his belly button. He gently nuzzles at the especially soft skin there then licks his way down the trail of fine hair until he’s kneeling in front of Sherlock. Sherlock watches him with fascination, biting his bottom lip to keep himself from making a noise. It’s so god damn hot that John almost gives in and swallows his cock right then and there. But he’s feeling far too sadistic today to give Sherlock what he wants so soon.
John’s tone is sharp now and the air is suddenly rife with tension that had not been there a moment ago.
He knew that his account of the event sounded cold and automatic. The truth was that he had been over it so many times in his head and out loud that there was no other way it
"I think the question, John, is are you prepared to stick by him whilst he learns?"
Sherlock seems half there already and doesn’t have the strength to protest and John helps him up and towards his bedroom. He pulls back the covers and crawls into bed, barely taking his eyes off John.
“Morning, John,” Sherlock says as he enters the room, “tea?”
“I know I haven’t been an easy person to get along with at times,” John confesses, not missing the humour in the fact that it’s usually Sherlock who is the difficult one.
"Okay, I'll tell you. Just...don't hate me," he finally said, and the vulnerability in his voice sent another pang straight through John's heart.
“That’s understandable,” John says softly.
“Of course, don’t mind me loves, I’ll let you get back to it and come back later.”
John read over Sherlock's text with a slight frown on his face. He suspected that Sherlock had always been blissfully free from those four words and the certain doom that they implied. Therefore it was likely that coming from Sherlock the words weren't an ominous warning of bad things to come, so John tried to relax. Everything had been fine, better than fine, just that morning…how wrong could they possibly have gone in just a few short hours? He groaned internally as he reminded himself who he was dealing with. Anything could happen when it was to do with Sherlock Holmes. Not that he himself wasn't struggling to understand and process everything that had gone on between them in the last twenty four hours. He was utterly confused, yet at the same time filled with a clarity of thought that was astounding. He loved Sherlock, had long since realised that, but everything seemed to be moving so fast. He knew that things always did with Sherlock. Like when he'd first met him and trusted him inherently almost immediately- something that had really never happened to him before. In fact, he had been sure enough of their connection to kill a man to protect Sherlock, without even thinking twice. So yes, he had to admit that life with the eccentric consulting detective didn't exactly move at a normal pace.
Sherlock nodded minutely.
John hurries up the stairs to their flat, taking them two at a time. He’s had a terrible day at the clinic and knows just what he needs to release that tension. He’s through the door and finds Sherlock at his desk, typing on his laptop without looking up.
John very nearly laughed in disbelief.
“Sherlock Holmes, you made it! Do come in,” says Soames, looking nothing short of delighted as he approaches Sherlock and shakes his hand warmly.
For several minutes they just lay there recovering, then Sherlock twisted his head around and caught John's lips in a soft yet insistent kiss, his fingertips stroking the skin just above John's groin which was sticky with semen. He moved his hand up to suck on his own fingers, licking and tasting, and it wasn't long before John found himself getting hard again despite the release they'd both just had. John pulled him in for another deep kiss, finding the vague taste of himself lingering on Sherlock's tongue strange but not unpleasant. He trailed his fingers down Sherlock's spine and felt Sherlock shiver slightly in his arms.
“He’s just disappeared! I was giving Rosie her bath and when I came out he was gone. It could have been a good twenty minutes ago,” she continues, clearly aghast.
“Another pot then?” he says.
"You're so beautiful, Sherlock, you're so perfect."
In an instant John has stopped, drawing himself back up to face Sherlock and clamping his hand firmly over Sherlock’s mouth.
to get past it, John?"
Now it was time to face facts- Sherlock just couldn't live without John. His brain had been consistently clouded with vivid memories of his time with the man, particularly since he'd returned. More than once he'd caught himself thinking about the kisses and feverish touches they had shared on the very couch that he now lay on listlessly, about how badly he had wanted more, how badly he still wanted more. Eventually he had retired to the sofa and hadn't moved for an entire day, missing John until his heart went from throbbing to horribly empty and back again. He couldn't bring himself to regret his actions because his plan had worked - John was alive - but then again he wasn't entirely able to convince himself that he would have been able to go through with them if he had known it meant loosing John forever. It had always been a risk certainly, but he had somehow had so much faith in their bond that he had, perhaps naively, assumed that things would work out in the end. He'd sat up quickly, ignoring the dizziness brought on by the sudden rush of blood to his head, deciding that the time for waiting was over. Sherlock had never been one to give up on anything he had set out to do, and damned if he was going to give up John without a fight. If John wanted him out of his life he was going to have to force him out. As he raced down Baker Street, eyes scanning the road for a taxi, he desperately hoped that would not be John's final word. He was so lost in his own thoughts that he bumped into someone forcefully, and he turned with a slight scowl to apologise. And there before him stood John Watson, the expression on his face undoubtedly echoing the surprise on his own.
“No problem,” John replies casually, taking a large gulp of his beer, and Sherlock heads towards the bar to pay.
They get back to work.
. He lived alone, but not at Baker Street. Even his brief visit there to pack up his things - their things - had been indescribably painful. It had been like Sherlock's essence was haunting the place, like he was there but not there. John could almost feel the high strung energy, could almost hear the strokes of violin. But John had finally accepted that Sherlock would never be there again. For a long time he had refused to speak to anyone about it. He had refused to accept that he was gone...his friend...his world. Finally he had started seeing his therapist again, for the first time since he had met Sherlock. He hadn't needed to see her back then— Sherlock had come along and turned his whole world upside down in the most wonderful way possible.
"Where is she?"
“…and I thought you might be cold,” he finishes, somewhat lamely, suddenly looking self-conscious.
"Anything you want."
“Thank you, John, that’s very…thoughtful,” Sherlock had muttered, a little uncertain and clearly not used to this kind of attention, but a small smile had played about his lips.
"I'm fine. I just need to adjust."
"So Sherlock asked me to approach you with the story that Irene Adler was beheaded, but to suggest that we keep the information from him."
"Of course he's dead, do you really think I'd be sitting here talking to you if he weren't? Honestly, John, sometimes I think that if you'd just use your..."
"Congratulations," John replied flatly, recovering from his mutism.
“I’ve booked us an apartment within walking distance of the Chem department until Sunday afternoon, that should give us plenty of time to investigate and wrap things up, wouldn’t you say?”
"Let's go to bed, John," Sherlock finally muttered in a sleepy voice, and John nodded against him.
He pauses, and looks down into his half-filled glass.
John spent a few minutes thumbing through the pages as he sipped at his tea. He'd already read the book from start to finish, obsessing to the point of seriously considering getting some bees himself, but sometimes he liked to scan through the pictures and read the captions, imagining Sherlock's voice spouting out the streams of information in the self-assured, arrogant way he used to do. It was a pointless distraction but was of some comfort all the same. A knock at the door interrupted John's light daydream and he set down his cup of tea, rose and crossed the length of the small flat to pull the door open. And then every effort he had made to rebuild something of a life suddenly became pointless, suddenly crumbled around him and fell defeated at his feet. Because he couldn't possibly be seeing what, or rather who, he was seeing.
"Top draw of the table beside you," Sherlock replied breathlessly.
Sherlock pauses and looks between their baffled faces with exasperation.
Sherlock remains frozen and seems to be holding his breath. He clears his throat quickly before speaking.
John kissed him deeply, increasing the pace of his movement slightly. Sherlock was moaning beneath him in the most delicious way, his breath now shallow, his eyes impossibly dark.
As moments passed, he’d felt hot oddly around the collar and tried to tell himself it was the physical exertion and nothing more. But the longer he’d stood against Sherlock, feeling every breath and every lean muscle underneath his coat, the harder it had become to convince himself. Out of nowhere, he’d had the mad urge to rest his palm against Sherlock’s chest, against that ridiculous shirt and at the base of that long elegant throat, wondering if it would feel as much like hard, cool marble as it looked. He’d slammed his eyes shut, forcing the thoughts away, until he’d become aware of Sherlock’s gaze upon him. “John?” Sherlock had questioned in a whisper, evidently concerned by this strange behaviour. They had exchanged an odd, heated look that seemed to stretch on into infinity. John didn’t dare breathe, almost positive his thundering heartbeat could be clearly heard. But the next thing he knew, Sherlock was pushing him out of the alcove and taking off down the alley in the opposite direction to which they came. John was off after him before he could give it a second thought.
His mind flashed to Irene Adler. The Woman. The only person who had ever come close to making him feel this confused and…lost. He respected her, was fascinated by her in ways that he couldn't quite place, he unarguably felt connected to her…but love her? No, he didn't think so. At least not like that. Their relationship was tremendously complex but one that was based largely on plays of power. They challenged each other, teased each other, and all but destroyed one another in a way that even Sherlock could recognise would make for a
Sherlock glared at him, and John could practically hear the gears grinding in his head.
“Shh I’ve got you,” he whispers, stroking his back soothingly.
John smiles at Rosie’s attempt at Sherlock’s name, a fairly recent addition to her vocabulary that she learned not long after “Dada”.
But Sherlock didn't finish his sentence, because John abruptly cut him off with a long, hard kiss.
“Urgh, I’m never eating again,” Sherlock moans, his head lolling back on the cushions.
John stops, breathes out slowly, tries again.
“But what if-”
He’s leant over the table slightly, bracing himself with his slim but toned arms, the delicate violinist fingers spayed on its surface. His curls are more untamed than usual, having not been as meticulously tended to these past few days, and hang over Sherlock’s face, creating interesting shadows over the already fascinating planes and angles. His brow is furrowed in concentration and his pink cupid bow lips are parted slightly, every now and then moving silently as Sherlock sorts through his thoughts and questions as he speedily reads the text, undoubtedly dismissing some and filing away others for further consideration.
All at once everything seems too much for Sherlock – the stress of the past year, losing Mary, almost losing John, losing Eurus. John holds him close as he sobs, having no real idea what to do or say. He wishes that somehow he could take away Sherlock’s pain. But Sherlock seems to not notice or not care, wrapped within his own emotional turmoil. He buries his face in John’s shirt and John continues his hushed words of comfort, one hand reaching up and getting lost in Sherlock’s curls, and drops a soft kiss on Sherlock’s temple. Sherlock’s lips graze the skin of John’s neck as he slowly manages to get his breathing under control. He’s awed by Sherlock’s trust in him, proud that he’s gotten to a point where he can let another human being see him at his weakest.
Out of the corner of his eye he sees Sherlock’s small smile, the same one he’s noticed in the past when John dishes out praise. Soames for his part seems unabashed and his smile remains.
John shrugged.
“Serbia,” he confirms softly.
He pulled away to look at Sherlock, who still looked divinely disheveled, and kissed him slowly, softly, trying to reassure him that everything was fine and that he didn't care how long he had to wait, that this was enough. Sherlock responded immediately, deepening the kiss and reaching for John's trousers, unbuttoning and unzipping them, pushing both trousers and shorts aside to free John's hard cock from the strained material. He wrapped his hand around John's hardness and started to stroke and John groaned unrestrainedly into Sherlock's mouth.
"Will you play for me?" he asked softly, gesturing towards the violin.
“I…I think so.”
And before too long, Sherlock was moaning and whispering incoherent nothings under his breath and John could sense that he was getting close. But something was holding him back.
"Moriarty wanted me to kill myself, thus concluding and confirming his story. I knew that I needed him to call off his snipers, and thought I'd found a way to do it but then..."
"I know. But it was the only way, John. I never would have forgiven myself if anything had happened to you," he said in a low voice.
John copies the address from the app, shoots off a text to Mycroft and presses the back button. Predictably, he and Sherlock’s text conversation record is the next one down. He can’t help but notice that beside his name is a small image where the icon has been changed from the standard. He taps his own name to enlarge the picture, figuring that it’s not exactly snooping when it’s his own conversation with Sherlock. But now that he can see the image properly it almost takes his breath away. It’s a photo of John and Rosie, taken the sunny summer day they had finished rebuilding 221B and had celebrated with a picnic in the park. In it, Rosie is grasping a strawberry in her chubby little hand and is messily attempting to feed herself, and John is lying alongside her on the picnic blanket and looking at her with both laughter and obvious adoration in his eyes. John had quite liked the photo when Sherlock had taken it, as he had always been partial to candid, natural photographs. He’s nothing short of touched that Sherlock has applied it to his contact record and wonders how often Sherlock actually looks at the photo. But before he can consider it any further, Sherlock is on his way back to the table. John exits the screen and hands the phone back to Sherlock with a smile.
"John. John! Wake up, it's just a nightmare. Wake up, John, it's okay, I'm here. I've got you."
At that Sherlock pulled him into a hug, wrapping his long arms around John's slightly trembling frame, bringing his lips to John's forehead and placing a gentle kiss there.
He pauses here for dramatic effect.
Now John’s sitting at his desk at the clinic, trying to focus through the static in his head and the grit in his eyes. He’s cursing himself for taking on an extra shift, the late shift of all things, but the clinic had been desperate and he’d rationalised that he could use some extra cash with Christmas not far away. He’d taken almost two weeks off whilst Sherlock was at his worst, but he knew he couldn’t be on leave indefinitely and it was hardly realistic for him to be with Sherlock every second of the day and night. Mrs Hudson had kindly agreed to take Rosie for the night, and keep an eye on Sherlock at the same time. He’s trying to catch up on some patient notes when his mobile rings. Mrs Hudson. His stomach drops at the sight of the caller display – she only ever calls when it’s something urgent and currently with her are the two people John cares most about in the world. He scrambles to answer the phone.
Awkwardly, but perhaps not unexpectedly, John’s finding it uncomfortable to be physically close to Sherlock. There had been the moment where he’d all but jumped out of his skin when Sherlock had leaned over him and whispered the answer the crossword puzzle question he was working on (because of course ‘desire’ was a six letter word for a state of wanting or yearning). Or the moment when Sherlock had actually cooked, and before John had known what was happening Sherlock had been upon him, spoon feeding him a taste of the sauce he’d been simmering (delicious, John had to admit). And, most memorably, when he’d walked in on a half-naked and very wet consulting detective who was fresh out of a steamy shower and wearing only a small towel slung impossibly low on his slender hips (
"But I already have once before."
“No,” he says, his voice as strong and cool as steel.
"I just mean that I would rather hear about you, about where you've been and what you've been doing all these months."
“You’re the only one I trust. The only one I ever trust like this. In the…in the past I have occasionally opened to people, and it’s always been a mistake. It’s always just reaffirmed what they knew about me already – that I’m a freak.”
"I was so broken, Sherlock. I think I might still be. And I was so alone...without you," John confessed, his voice barely above a whisper, no longer caring that tears were now rolling down his cheeks freely.
“Why so long?”
It’s become something of a ritual that when Sherlock goes to bed – if he goes to bed – it’s next to John. John’s not even entirely sure how or why or when it happened, just that one night not long after the night he’d found out about Serbia, he’d been just about to drift off and had heard the unmistakable creak of a floorboard near the top of the stairs outside the room he and Rosie shared. His door had been ajar – perhaps an unconscious invitation – and he could see a shadow floating hesitantly beyond the threshold.
“Get some sleep,” Sherlock murmurs, “You’ll need your strength for that bundle of raw chaotic energy you’ll be chasing around after tomorrow.”
"I also wanted to apologise for what I did to you."
“Well, there’s simply nothing else for it, we’re off to Cambridge,” Sherlock suddenly announces to the room at large.
Sherlock lets out a growl of frustration, raking his hands through his hair.
“Food’s here,” John says, somewhat unnecessarily, and Sherlock makes his way over to the door.
John silenced him with a kiss and moved his hand to gently squeeze Sherlock's balls, then move further back, his fingers stroking softly.
John doesn’t verbalise it but what he really wants to ask is “why did it take
“I must say I owe you a debt of gratitude for coming to help me out, it really is a most unfortunate situation.”
March/April – events of "The Final Problem"
"I did it for you, John," he said finally, his voice so low that John could barely hear it. "Moriarty and Moran would never have let you live. They would have taken you away from me, and I couldn't..."
John shut him up with another kiss.
“Until you came into my life, that is.”
. John feels his face grow hot at the thought but he seems unable to tear his eyes away from the man in front of him.
"Hi? Really? That's all you have to say to me after being gone for almost a year, during which time everyone, including me, thought that you were dead?"
"But what if we try and it fails?" He paused, looking down into his mug. "I don't want to loose him again. I can't loose him again."
The following morning sees them enjoying a lazy breakfast after a small sleep in, after which they decide to wonder around the town and take a long walk along the canals. It’s a gorgeous day, despite the chill in the air, and they fall into a natural rhythm and easy conversation as they walk. Around lunchtime, they choose from the many cosy looking pubs and settle in for a leisurely lunch. They Face Time Molly and Rosie from John’s phone and explain that they’ve solved the case early and will be heading back first thing tomorrow. John can see that Molly is a little puzzled as to why they’re staying without a case to work on, but thankfully she doesn’t question it. And, much to John’s relief, she’s made all kinds of elaborate plans for the two of them and they both seem perfectly happy, easing most of the guilt he feels for being away without a “proper reason”.
“Is it sore there?” he asks.
There was another long moment where neither of them seemed to breathe, then the wall seemed to break and John was lunging forward, pulling Sherlock to him and crushing their lips together in a bruising kiss. It only took Sherlock a second to recover from his shock and start to respond, his desperation to be forgiven evident.
Sherlock nods his acknowledgement but seems reluctant to speak, clearly unsure as to whether he should stay or go. John blows out a long, slow breath.
“That’s it?”
"I'd like to talk about what Sherlock told you, how it made you feel," she was saying to him.
John nods once and feels uncomfortable all over again as Ella considers him.
His answer was more than good enough for John, and he continued unbuttoning Sherlock's trousers then unzipped them and slid his hand inside, lightly stroking Sherlock's impressive erection through the silk of his boxer shorts. Sherlock groaned, pushing his hips towards John's hand.
Sherlock hesitated.
"Excellent, I'll get some glasses," Sherlock answered, retreating to the kitchen that was much tidier than John was used to when he and Sherlock had shared it.
“Would you say that you’re finding yourself attracted to Sherlock?” Ella asks. It’s a blunt question, but one that John accepts needs to be asked and answered outright.
Sherlock’s expression is calm and resolved, the most of his Dark Mood seems to have passed.
November – Sherlock returns
Sherlock pulled on his long, dark coat and headed hurriedly down the stairs of 221B. He'd been good for more than an entire week- had done what he suspected was the right thing to do and leave John to his thoughts, to let him come around in his own time. But now he was getting worried that he wouldn't. The thought made his chest oddly tight, like all the air in his lungs has been stolen, and he suspected that it had nothing to do with the fact that he'd smoked an entire packet of cigarettes over the last couple of days and everything to do with his panic that he had lost John forever. He still wasn't entirely sure how he had survived the week. He knew that had John been around he would have driven him mad, for he'd tried to distract himself with research and experiments and reading but had failed abysmally, instead spending most of his time wondering around the flat, fidgeting with things, throwing things, occasionally breaking things. He had gone through a brief period of anger, where he had caved and bought the cigarettes. He had smoked them triumphantly and briefly rejoiced in the fact that John wasn't around to tell him not to. But the satisfaction had departed as abruptly as it had come, leaving him feeling more empty than before. He'd even tried using alcohol to calm himself, as it always seemed to work for John. Without John there to share the bottle of red with him, as they'd done so many times before, it had been all too easy to consume the whole thing himself. Not surprisingly, the only thing he'd gained was neck ache from the awkward position he'd fallen asleep in and a persistent throb in his head the following morning.
Next to him, Sherlock is very still, and John feels his own cheeks turn pink. He focuses on pushing Rosie in the swing, and the little girl giggles with delight.
"Thought we might have a little celebration," he says with a slightly conspiratorial smile.
“Yes,” he manages to reply, his voice utterly wrecked. “It was incredible. Intense, but quite remarkable.”
But even Sherlock has to admit that he sounds completely shattered and knows it not entirely from the evenings vigorous activities.
"Sexuality is a complicated thing, John," she had said in her sensible yet reassuring way. "It's not always black and white. In fact, there is a lot of grey area for most people. Just because you find yourself having these feelings towards Sherlock it doesn't mean that you have to label yourself in any particular way. It's entirely possible for people to suddenly find themselves attracted to someone of the same sex even though they never have before and may never again."
Mycroft rose from his seat, umbrella handle gripped in his left hand, and approached John with an overly polite smile that made John want to smack him over the head with his own umbrella.
He can’t deny that Sherlock’s presence the night before had helped him immensely and he finds himself feeling slightly disappointed when he can tangibly feel the empty space beside him where Sherlock had laid. It had been one of the worst parts of adjusting to life without Mary – the empty bed that they had once shared may as well have been as vast as the ocean. He had to admit that having a warm body beside his for the first time in months had been wonderfully comforting and pleasant, even if that body did belong to one Sherlock Holmes. He thought of Sherlock’s strong arms around his shoulders as he’d battled through the throes of his panic attack, and how much it had grounded him. Amazing how powerful touch can be, John reflects. He’s never been an overly tactile person himself, not one who’s often prone to extended cuddling and certainly not public displays of affection. But in recent months he’s come to crave it more and he has to admit that being closer to Sherlock again is probably at least partially to blame.
"I don't hate you, Sherlock. I could never hate you."
"You like that?" John whispered hoarsely in his ear.
Satisfied, John slips his hand between Sherlock’s legs, giving his cock and balls a cursory stroke, and feels the base of the plug inside Sherlock. It’s of a modest size, just enough to for Sherlock to feel it, but it opens him up nicely.
"Things will be different now. We're in this together. No secrets, no excuses. Yes?"
"I thought you were straight," Sherlock replied immediately and John didn't miss the smirk in his voice despite his admirable effort at concealing it from his expression.
John complied, still watching Sherlock closely to make sure he was enjoying it.
"I can't tell him that. I can never tell him that."
“That’s alright,” John reassures.
“Try not to get that dressing wet,” John replies. “I’ll redo it tomorrow though.”
John drew in a deep, shaky breath. He wasn't ready to think about this right now, not yet.
John was looking at the table, his fingers gripping its edge tightly.
He remembers quite clearly one of the first times Sherlock had touched him. They’d been at Baskerville and were still cooling off the morning after their blazing row, in which Sherlock had vehemently informed him that he doesn’t have friends. John had been stalking away through the graveyard after a half-hearted apology from Sherlock. Then Sherlock had suddenly and very deliberately grabbed his arm and it had shot through him like an electric shock because Sherlock had never done that before. Sherlock had always seemed determined to avoid any kind of touch, any kind of emotion, yet here he was breaking all of his own self-imposed rules. For John. He had tried not to look too pleased but had felt a definite change within their relationship – now they were officially friends. After that there had of course been the odd casual touches, the handshakes and pats on the back here and there. The strong urge he’d felt to pull Sherlock into a hug before he boarded that plane when they’d both thought he was leaving again, this time forever. But that would have made their predicament too real, and he doubted that either of them were prepared to face the reality of the situation. Thank god they hadn’t needed to, in the end.
“There’s no reason you can’t still fit in,” she replies, and John nods, mulling this over.
“I’ll take care of him. I promise.”
noxious relationship. He moved on and a vague idea of Mycroft floated around his mind. He supposed that Mycroft loved him, somewhere under a thousand layers of cold indifference, of putting almost everything before him. He was there when Sherlock needed him, had been since they were children, but Sherlock had long since recognised that this did not include emotional need. He took a moment to acknowledge this before moving on. Then he came to Mrs Hudson's name. That one made more sense. She was like the mother he'd never had - the mothers he had read and heard about as a young child - the ones who fussed over their sons even though the children claimed to hate it, who cooked them breakfast so that they knew they had eaten at least one nutritious meal that day, who picked up after them even though it drove them up the wall, because there was no other way to be. The mothers who hugged their sons, knew when something was wrong, supported them and encouraged them and wanted them to be happy. The mothers who were always and unfailingly there.
"John, do you remember the drug we were exposed to at Dartmoor? The one that made us see what we expected to see…what we most feared?"
John sighed, shook his head, and stared Mycroft straight in the eyes.
He swallowed hard, focusing on his hands on his knees, the way his fingers gripped the fabric of his trousers tightly.
He felt the other man nod against him, remaining silent, never pausing in his rubbing of John's back. To John it somehow felt like both a minute and an eternity that the two of them stood there, half collapsed against the lounge room wall, clinging to each other as though their lives depended on it, which in a way, they did.
“Thank you again for looking after Rosie on such short notice.”
"Mmm we should get to bed. When's the last time you slept?" he asks with concern.
John slaps his ass hard and Sherlock cries out again, but he decides to give him what he wants, angling his hips to tease but not quite hit Sherlock’s most sensitive spot.
John huffs out a small laugh, looking over to Rosie in her cot on the other side of the room and relieved to find that she’s still sleeping soundly. The fact that she’s such a deep sleeper in another small mercy in his life.
February – Rosie’s birth
“God, I’m so sorry, Sherlock.”
They struggle to their feet and out to the road, taking shelter under a building awning until they can hail a cab. Sherlock is silent for the short trip back to Baker Street, shivering getting the better of him every now and then, allowing John to keep an arm around his shoulder. John shoots a text off to Mycroft explaining that he’s found Sherlock and that he will be with him. Then he calls Mrs Hudson to let her know they’re on their way back and to ask that she please keep Rosie overnight. He has no idea what he’s doing, he’s really just playing it by ear, but he knows that there’s no way he can look after Rosie and Sherlock at the same time this evening. The cab pulls up to 221 and John pays and tips then manages to get them both upstairs. Sherlock is still trembling mildly and hasn’t said a word since they left the bridge, John has followed suite, not wanting to push him too far too soon. He decides again that taking care of Sherlock in a practical way is better than nothing at all. Once they’re inside, John grabs a warm blanket from the linen cupboard and directs Sherlock towards the lounge.
"No, I haven't. But I want to. With you."
He paused and seemed to struggle with himself over something. And at that moment, Sherlock's phone rang loudly, causing all three of them to very nearly jump in surprise. Sherlock pulled it from the inner pocket of his suit jacket and glanced at it quickly.
for god's sake. His best friend, his flatmate, his partner. John found himself standing outside 221B, wondering whether he should ring the bell, which had apparently been fixed. It felt strange, but then again so did just walking in. Luckily he was spared the decision when the door swung open in front of him and Sherlock stood in its frame, wearing dark trousers but no jacket and the purple shirt that John had always secretly thought looked far too good on him. They greeted each other, things still noticeably tense between them, and Sherlock lead the way down the familiar hallway to the staircase.
John turns to Mrs Hudson, forcing a smile onto his face.
"Shut up, Sherlock, just shut up."
“I, uh, just asked if you wanted more tea.”
“Let’s get you home.”
Sherlock grunted in agreement, making quick work of John's shirt buttons and peeling the damp fabric away from his skin. John's hands went to Sherlock's trousers, unbuttoning and unzipping them but unable to help himself from rubbing Sherlock's erection through the material. Sherlock moaned into John's mouth.
At least he could say his name now without his voice cracking, he had thought. A trivial fact to distract him from the flood of relief he had felt at finally saying the words he had been storing for so long. He hadn't been sure when exactly he'd realised the truth— it had just sort of happened one day and the knowledge had settled upon him with as much certainty as the accuracy of one of Sherlock's deductions, or as the fact that the earth revolves around the sun.
They fell onto Sherlock's bed, kissing hard, hands frantically exploring each others bodies.
“I don’t know what’s changed. Or why. I find myself…watching him. Noticing things more than I used to. Wanting to be…I don’t know…closer to him?”
