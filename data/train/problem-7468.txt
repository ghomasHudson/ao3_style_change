gets him all riled up and defensive, especially when it comes to the same people he’s been living with for almost two years, and who are
“Thor, you’re the next closest to Nat. Can you intercept the spider bots in time while Iron Man comes to give her a lift?” Steve continues after he lets out a breathy thank you to Tony.
Hmm. Interesting.
“Go rest, Tony,” Steve repeats.
“Can you try to say something?” Bruce asks, sounding very much like the scientist he is. He’s leaning forward in his seat as he peers at Tony with intrigue. Then he quickly adds, “No pressure! You don’t have to if you don’t —”
“He’s not dead, Steve.”
he thinks as he slowly makes his way to the bathroom to freshen up, shaking his head as the remnants of his dream (
“Hey, Tony,” Steve greets, somehow sounding fond and reprimanding at the same time. “How you holding up?”
So it comes as a surprise when he’s halfway to the kitchen that he spots a lone figure standing in front of the floor to ceiling windows. Eyes squinting as it adjusts to the dark-lit room, it takes Steve a second longer to discern the person staring at the New York skyline.
When Tony’s done speaking, he has his glass refilled by Happy and has downed half of his drink before he dares to take a peek at Pepper. The auburn-haired woman is looking at him with a soft expression, one Tony is acutely aware of that means Pepper’s
“I’m here to guide you, sir.”
“Man, clean-up’s gonna be a bitch,” Clint remarks.
“Yeah, it’s right here. But I want Bruce to check it out first before we release it to SHIELD.”
“You are welcome, Captain,” JARVIS replies kindly.
For all that it’s supposed to come as a witty retort, there’s no mistaking the sincerity in JARVIS’ tone, and Steve can’t help the smile that blooms on his face when he catches sight of Tony’s face softening at the AI’s words.
Steve’s lips twitch upwards into a smirk at the colonel’s fond, albeit exasperated, tone.
Tony huffs out a laugh. It ends up sounding more like a sob, and the engineer is eternally grateful that his AI doesn’t say anything further.
“That’s it?” Clint asks shrewdly. “You didn’t feel anything when you got hit?”
Perched comfortably on one of the stools in the kitchen island, Clint’s in the middle of pouring a hefty amount of Lucky Charms into an equally huge bowl when his sensitive ears pick up the familiar footsteps of their resident genius. The archer looks up when Tony comes in, blearily making his way towards the coffee machine.
Oh. He had a nightmare, then.
Steve reluctantly steps back, already missing the closeness as he lets his fingers slip free from Tony’s. The latter quickly walks to the small bathroom situated in the corner of the workshop so he can change out of his undersuit. It only takes a few minutes before Tony comes out dressed in faded jeans and a grey MIT sweater. When he reaches Steve’s side, who didn’t move from his position, Tony doesn’t hesitate to reach out and tangle his calloused fingers around Steve’s left hand. The super soldier blinks, startled but secretly delighted at the bold gesture. Tony doesn’t say anything so Steve keeps his mouth shut, however he takes great pleasure in seeing the genius blush, the tips of his ears pink.
With Steve, he feels like he’s not partaking in a race against time. They’re both perfectly aware of their lifestyle, being superheroes and all, and they know that there’s no guarantee for their future. But in spite of all that, Tony is two hundred percent certain that what he has with the super soldier will last. Hell, they’re still building whatever this is between them, but Tony knows without a shadow of a doubt that he’s in this for the long haul. They both are, and that thought — that absolute
Don't Stop Believing - Journey
“Can’t believe that idiot disabled
. What I have for you is for your eyes and ears only. Hence, why we’re going to my suite.”
Steve feels Tony twitch, and he looks down to see Tony’s face scrunch up in discomfort. Chest tightening in sympathy, Steve makes shushing noises and gently strokes his thumb over the crease between the engineer’s brows. Emboldened, Steve leans down and presses a kiss to Tony’s forehead, all the while maintaining his caressing of the man’s thick, brown curls.
He doesn’t dare himself to look back, unwilling to find out who or what may be behind him.
“Huh? Oh, I’m going to take another blood sample,” Bruce replies as he gingerly takes hold of Tony’s left arm. He swabs a cotton over Tony’s forearm before taking hold of the syringe and carefully extracting blood. It takes less than a minute, Steve silently observing his friend withdraw the needle then swab another cotton to wipe off the excess blood and applying a bandaid over it.
“What’s going on, JARVIS?” Bruce asks calmly. “Did something happen to Tony?”
What would it be like, then? Tony supposes it would be liberating, but at the same time daunting. Still, he wonders what it would be like to have people think the best of him instead of the worst? To love and care about him in the same degree he loves and care about them?
Steve waits two agonizing minutes for Tony to reply, all the while worrying if he’s taken it a step too far. When his phone buzzes, he sighs in relief and slides his phone open to read Tony’s texts.
Fortunately, Thor obeyed their leader’s command (it wasn’t anything
“Befriending people at my age shouldn’t be a difficult job, Nat,” Steve says with a self-deprecating smile.
Yes, it’s Tony Stark sitting with them right now, but at the same time it’s not
you tell us then, Bruce? Pretty sure you’ve come up with a few hypotheses by now.”
Tony attempts to smile, but it ends up looking like a grimace as he answers, “I’ll be fine. Just having the worst fucking hangover. Fuck, those tequila shots got to me.”
in the engineer’s expressive eyes.
“Mr. Odinson left it there by accident as he became more preoccupied with beating Mr. Barton in Mario Kart,” JARVIS answers.
“Uh. Cool. Thanks.”
It’s a bone-deep exhaustion that causes the engineer’s shoulders to slump further, arms crossing over his chest as he chews on his lower lip. He’s thankful that he doesn’t have the chills anymore, and God help him should it come back. But that’s a bridge he’ll cross if it happens again. For now, he’s dressed in his thickest and comfiest clothes, surrounded by people he trusts to have his back in a fight but not… not in
“Hey, J, where are the others?” Tony asks after a brief silence.
His company. His friends. His
a command, obviously), albeit very reluctantly because the first time they attempted to bring that topic up over one of their team dinners, Tony had gone completely stiff and stared at them with guarded eyes. Bruce didn’t have to be a master spy to see the unsettled look that passed over Tony’s face when his eyes met Thor’s warm, if not gleeful, stare. Thankfully, Natasha was quick to defuse the situation by swiftly changing the topic to recount the meeting she had with Fury regarding the clean-up of their latest mission.
“That’s… oddly specific,” Steve replies, a small smile playing at the corners of his mouth.
for me to be informed that you were injured in the field?”
“What?” Tony asks, doe-eyes wide in surprise.
“Disgusting,” Natasha says dryly, but there’s a note of amusement in her voice.
Tony shrugs.“Fair enough. Then Fury and his minions would’ve done the same. It’s SHIELD who found you, after all.”
Pepper and Bruce snort almost simultaneously. A peculiar look crosses over Tony's face before it clears and he purses his lips in thought.
He enters the communal kitchen in the dead of the night after a fifty-eight hour engineering binge to make himself a cup of coffee. Of course, he could’ve done it in the privacy of his workshop, but DUM-E accidentally broke the coffee pot in his enthusiasm to cater to Tony’s ill-advised request, much to JARVIS’s disapproval.
His journey to accepting his worth is also a testament to how much Tony has grown comfortable in wielding Mjölnir that Thor (and probably JARVIS, come to think of it) has taken it upon himself to conveniently leave his weapon in the common area whenever the genius finds himself seeking her.
type of person who gets between a couple. Hell no, he’ll gladly remain Tony’s friend than be the one to destroy his relationship with a remarkable and beautiful woman like Pepper Potts.
“Can you activate JARVIS again?” Steve, more or less, demands.
He opens the fridge and takes out two bottles of water. Tony quickly empties one in record time and is halfway through drinking the second bottle when he sees a blond mop of hair peeking out from the edge of the couch. Eyebrows furrowed, Tony sets the bottle down on the countertop before he pads towards the living room, slightly faltering in his steps as he sways a bit.
It’s in that moment that Tony decides to lift the faceplate, and Natasha meets his worried look with an impatient one of her own.
I guess I just want a hug. And talking to you made me crave for it more.
“Director Fury has informed me that he’s dispatched SHIELD personnel to assist in securing the perimeter and to lend further support under your command, Captain,” JARVIS conveys.
“Sir? Do you want me to set your alarm?”
“Fuck, I pissed them off even more,” Tony groans.
“I don’t think so, Bruce.”
The super soldier shakes his head and states, “Honestly? This could’ve been avoided if I had been keeping a better eye on Tony in the first place.”
He doesn't notice Steve's stunned silence, and to be honest Tony's so far off now that he doesn't even realize what he's just said.
He clears throat.
This is enough, Steve thinks, but he doesn’t believe it for one second. It should be.
“You may be a huge pain in the ass, and yes, you may have the tendency to be high maintenance and a bit overbearing. But Tony, you can never be a burden to me. You’re my best friend. Do you think I would still be here if you were?”
“I… what?”
“Call it, Cap,” Natasha says then.
In the end, he swallows inaudibly and nods his head with an apologetic look aimed at Bruce. Silence reigns after that, and it’s after a minute or two that Clint decides to break it.
“Thank you,” the blond man whispers softly, reverently, before he finally —
Tony’s still blinking to get the sleep out of his eyes as he carefully sits up in bed. Bruce, who’s closest to him, doesn’t hesitate to reach out to assist the engineer before lifting the pillows a little higher to accommodate his back.
Thank you all for your comments! I hope you like this chapter. ;)
“You’re so sweet. So awesome. The greatest.”
“Well, you know. Waking up seventy years in the future is daunting enough. What more is it like consuming so much information on a daily basis as a means to catch up with everything you’ve missed? I mean, it’s been about two years since you woke up, right? But even then, there’s only so much information you can consume
“Sometimes, Tony, the answer you need is right in front of you. How about, for once, you do something that doesn’t require spending money? Or building something? Especially when it comes to Steve, I think he tends to lean towards the ‘it’s the thought that counts’ notion. Just think about it, okay?”
Mjölnir tells him one day in the middle of a training session.
“No, she wants to talk,” he hears Thor say reassuringly. “I believe she’s concerned for your welfare and only wants to be assured that you’re fine herself.”
Steve smiles at him and nods, and he can’t help but think that Tony’s reply sounded more like ‘thank you’.
Later on, she’ll blame it on the pain, but it takes Natasha a few seconds to understand the implication of Tony’s request and —
Jarvis has somehow become privy to his deepest, darkest, most intimate secrets. He's never felt this exposed in his life — oh wait, that's not true. “What the fuck. Is this even happening in my head? Are you even
There’s a faint rustle before they hear Rhodey say, “Yeah, all safe and secure.”
“Okay, but we compromise. Promise me that you’ll at least get a solid eight hours tonight? If you manage to get more, then I’ll be beyond thrilled.”

prior to Steve's birthday — just so that the super soldier (and Tony, who was invited by the blond man after practically begging him to come along. And who’s Tony to say ‘no’ to that adorable puppy-dog face?
“Tony,” Steve manages after swallowing past the dryness in his throat.
To say that Tony was shocked at the public’s reaction is a huge understatement. CNN, BBC, Fox News, and several other broadcasting channels
Well. If there’s anyone who has access to the codes, it’s definitely the formidable Pepper Potts.

Tony tilts his head and offers Steve a heartfelt smile that just about melts the super soldier’s insides. Doe eyes soft with understanding, Tony softly reiterates, “You belong here, Steve. In this time, in this century. You belong
Tony cackles as he gets up from his position on the carpeted floor, draining his fourth glass of scotch before he walks over to Bruce and starts to tug the other man to his feet.
“Lo and behold you’re an idiot if you think you can beat Clint in his own game,” Bruce says, deadpan. “Believe me, I tried.”
“You don’t have to tell us if you don’t want to, Tony,” Steve interjects placatingly, shooting Natasha a look of warning, but the redhead ignores him.
“Well damn, time does fly fast when you’re discussing history,” Tony quips.
Rhodey, on the other hand, blinks at Tony from the 85-inch TV screen installed in the living room. In fact, the colonel blinks again and stares harder at Tony, who does his best not to squirm too much under the military man’s scrutinizing gaze. It takes a few more seconds before Rhodey’s expression clears to one of mild alarm.
This time, Tony rolls his eyes in mild-exasperation at the blond man’s befuddled expression.
So between dates, board meetings, engineering binges, training with his team — and on occasion with Mjölnhir — plus saving the world every other week, the futurist in him thinks that all the pieces will fall into place eventually. On top of that, the hopeful optimistic part of him also thinks that the best is yet to come.
When Steve reaches Tony’s side a few minutes later, the engineer grins widely at the still-blushing man as he spreads his arms out wide.
“Rhodey, Rhodey,” Tony calls out weakly. He waits until Rhodey’s concerned eyes meets his to say, “Sorry, buddy, but uh, I gotta go. Need to go to the bathroom. Uh, I think there was something in the tortilla dip that Clint made.”
Tony’s eyes are downcast, brows furrowed in thought as his hand now gently massages the arc reactor and the skin around it.
It’s one thing to have your family and friends constantly remind you of your worth, and it’s another to have the whole world bear witness to him wielding Mjölnir, a feat only achieved by an alien god, and have them sing
Sitting on the edge of the bed, Steve lightly brushes his fingers over Tony’s forehead, pushing his fringe back as he caresses the warm skin. It’s odd that JARVIS says Tony’s body temperature is abnormally lower than a normal human being’s when he can feel the heat that Tony’s radiating, sweat starting to break out on the man’s upper lip. With a sigh, he goes to the en suite to retrieve a towel to wipe the sweat off.
The faint rhythmic pulse has stopped, and Tony next senses a presence behind him.
Though little did he know how he’d be proven wrong.
“It is perfectly fine, Tony, there is no need to apologize,” Jarvis says gently. To prove his point, the Brit lifts a hand to squeeze Tony’s shoulder as if in reassurance, completely missing the way Tony stiffens slightly under his grip. “After all, I’m here to help you reach your destination, and where we are headed will answer all your burgeoning questions.”
Yet the portal is still open.
However, he can also read between the lines just fine, and Steve’s perfectly aware that it’s not only the mother hen attitude Tony was referring to when he pointed out that they’ve been doing this song and dance for years. It’s also the shameless flirting, the blatant displays of affection (he’s lost count how many kisses on the cheek he’s received; but he’s also lost count how many hugs he’s given), the ridiculous pet names (Tony often calls him ‘honey’ while Steve likes to use ‘babe’, much to the their teammates’ exasperation), and the inevitable way they always gravitate to each other whenever they’re in the same room.
From the corner of his eye, Steve sees Bruce also look up from his journal, the three of them watching Tony fidget slightly as he comes up with an answer.
He looks down at his feet — he can’t even
He stays by Tony’s side for another half hour before he forces himself to leave.
“Thank God that he’s
The night something shifted in the team’s dynamics. The night Steve finally put a name to what he was feeling at the time.
“Then I’ll
Bruce looks up from the banana he’s cutting into pieces on his plate to meet the super soldier’s inquiring gaze.
Tony opens and closes his mouth a few times, but no word comes out, and that alone causes Steve’s worry to deepen. Frowning, he takes a tentative step towards the smaller man, and Steve silently sends a prayer of thanks when Tony doesn’t back away. In fact, he seemed to
There’s something niggling at the back of Steve’s mind, and although he’s wracking his brain for what it could be, nothing comes to mind. Frustrated but not wanting it to show, Steve inhales and exhales deeply as an uncomfortable silence falls over the group once more.
Tony sighs in relief and then closes his eyes when his head begins to throb painfully. He brings up his hands and massages his temples as he utters through gritted teeth, “J, tint the walls for me, too? The light is killing my eyes.”
“Right away, Doctor Banner,” JARVIS answers, and there’s no denying the thrill in the AI’s voice this time.
Steve grabs his beverage from the counter and walks to the couch, where he deposits the mug on a Captain America coaster (gag gift from Sam). He’s just taken a sip of his drink when his phone buzzes repeatedly in his hand.
. And yet, among the hundreds of hashtags generated within twenty-four hours, the most popular that the netizens use is
Yeah, that familiar sense of foreboding is creeping up his spine and Tony is certain he’s not gonna like what’s gonna happen next.
“What’s for dinner?” Peter asks as he starts to clean up his workstation.
“Steve?” Tony’s voice echoes in the silence of the communal living room. “Why are you still up?”
Yeah. No.
Anyhow, taking into account that humans lack the proper tools to analyze a god-like weapon, Bruce is still inclined to study the components of the hammer, even if he himself isn’t worthy.
It takes a bit of maneuvering, their knees and elbows bumping against each other as Steve throws half of the blanket over Tony’s legs and he picks up another cushion from the floor to use as a pillow. They end up on their sides, facing each other, their noses almost touching at the close proximity. And though Tony’s nursing a hangover, the idea of being the little spoon is a no-go. Well, at least for now. Maybe. That is, if this even happens again.
“I haven’t heard this in a while,” she says, sounding almost reverent. There’s a distant look in her eyes, and Steve exchanges a significant look with Clint, who’s still filming the whole thing. “This song was a wake-up call, Antoshka.”
“Yeah,” Tony utters as he fights back a yawn. “Yeah, it’s perfect.”
20/20 as it occurred to him several weeks later that what Steve said about the first step towards healing being the hardest was true.
“What happens if someone tries to do it? Hack into the system?” Clint asks, curious.
“I think so, yeah.”
“Mornin’,” Clint greets cheerfully, eyeing the other man in mild amusement as he gropes the content of the cupboard for a mug.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you like this before, Bruce,” Steve comments after his laughter dies down. He sees Thor pass the microphone to Natasha, just as the notes to a Cranberries song starts to play.
“I think it’s a great idea, Tony,” Pepper finally says. She takes Tony’s hand in hers and squeezes his slightly shaking fingers, the engineer squeezing back and shooting her a smile of gratitude. Then she cocks her head to the side as she remembers something. “Come to think of it, you pretty much took my advice to heart.”
Steve’s leaning forward in his seat, elbows resting on his knees as he listens attentively to Bruce’s narration. He belatedly notices that the others are in almost the same position as he is, though Clint is perched on the arm of the armchair that Natasha’s occupying.
“You are not broken, Anthony,” Thor gently interjects, a tinge of sadness in his voice.
Steve’s bringing up the rear, so he witnesses Natasha place a comforting hand on the middle of Tony’s back as she walks past him. He sees Tony turn his head to smile at the redhead, who smiles back at him with a warm look. Next, he sees Clint set down a bottle of cold water by Tony’s plate, the archer clapping a hand on Tony’s shoulder when the engineer thanks him with a small grin. Warmth blooms in Steve’s chest as he observes the small details of his teammates going out of their way to be considerate towards Tony. As he settles himself in his usual seat, which is in front of Tony and on Bruce’s left, Steve shoots the engineer a lopsided smile as he pushes the bowl of fresh fruits closer to him, a clear gesture that Tony should eat a piece of kiwi first.
, Tony. We came down here to see you gone — StarkPad discarded, coffee gone cold.”
Again, Steve shakes his head and smiles lopsidedly at his friend. “Doubt it.” He gets up from his seat, taking the empty mugs with him to dump it in the sink before he opens the fridge to rummage through the contents to prepare a late lunch. “Anyway, what do you feel like having for lunch?”
No response.
“Oh, if only it were that easy, Sir.”
Two years before that, it was a simpler celebration, wherein it was just The Team in Avengers Tower. They all pitched in to make something for dinner, which resulted in six superheroes gathered around the kitchen, weaving past and around each other to finish cooking and preparing the food they were going to eat. Bruce cooked Steve’s favorite Indian dishes, with the birthday celebrant helping out (as usual, nothing new); Natasha made a Russian stew that looked mouthwatering and tasted absolutely
Yeah, I will.
They are the ones who give Tony hope. Hope to believe in himself — that the person he once was isn’t the person who he is now — that he’s
“Yeah, yeah. So? Come with me and satiate my craving with me?”
No wonder he’s decided to keep the facial hair since then.
This was never about Tony freaking out because he can wield Mjölnir. No, all this time Tony’s been suffering in silence because a sentient war-hammer has just told him that he’s worthy. Not just worthy to wield Mjölnir, no — but that he was recognized as a person of
“Yeah. I’d love that,” Tony pronounces, sounding a tad breathless. The tenderness in his whiskey-colored eyes makes Steve a little weak in the knees. “I look forward to it.”
“Thanks, buddy.”
The way the genius grasps the handle of Mjölnir is one borne of ease and familiarity, as if he’s been wielding god-like weapons his whole life. Steve looks on in wonder as Tony lifts the hammer. He discerns sparks of lightning surrounding the weapon and Tony’s hand, and if the super soldier had to guess it looked like an affectionate gesture from Mjölnir. Mouth hanging open at the sight before him, one he’s secretly hoped to witness for
“How are you feeling?” Steve forces himself to say the words, internally sighing with relief that his own voice doesn’t end up wobbling, or worse.
Tony doesn’t hide a wince at the placid tone of his AI. A part of him thinks he’d rather hear the disappointed tone than this calm version, because at least he’d know JARVIS is reacting accordingly after Tony disabled him without a second thought.
Pepper grins, and Steve fights down the shiver at the thought of being on the receiving end of such an intimidating, but beautiful, smile.
“I can stop,” Tony started, half hoping Steve would force him to do so. “I can put a pin in it, right now.”
“Uh…problem? Nope, not on my side at least.”
They both knew the answer to that.
"Whatever it takes."
“Steve, Tony, this is a second chance.”
irritating light. He smacked his cracked lips together as he attempted to reopen his lids.
“Well, look what we have here. When was the last time you slummed it down here with the rest of us?”
Bucky weighed up his options, before finally speaking. “Stark’s was spotted last Sunday with that boy again, the one from Queens. He was dropping him off at his apartment block on the quieter side of town.”
Steve cringed at the tone in his boss’s voice as he weaved his way through the crowded room towards his desk. He bumped into several chairs and tables on his journey, almost causing a middle-aged man to spill his coffee over his mess of a workspace. Steve gave the man a sheepish grin as he apologised profusely but didn’t slow down. Yes, he was late, but only be two minutes and really, that shouldn’t be considered late at all. It wasn’t his fault anyway, the subway had been so crowded that morning, that it had taken four trains until he’d finally been able to squeeze into a carriage. That was the real injustice this morning.
She must’ve felt his stare because only moments later she turned her sympathetic gaze on him.
“You should get some sleep; it’s been a long few days. I can handle this.”
He’d yet to specialise in a particular category of writing, mainly due to his inability to write on topics that actually interested him. This week he’d been assigned to write about the institution of new meal plans at a selection of schools in Queens and how it had (or hadn’t) improved the academic performance of students. His initial draft had pointed out that the meal plans had only been granted to schools in high socio-economic areas that already had access to healthy, good quality food and therefore they would have little effect on academic performance. He’d tried to imply that the meal plans had to go to more disadvantaged schools, and then more than simply academic performance would have to be measured (preferably mental health would be a focus). Of course, his superior had felt that he had lost objectivity in his article and that he was close to stepping on the toes of the investigative team. He’d had to rewrite the entire piece and remove anything that made it remotely compelling. Now he was stuck with a half-finished load of garbage that he didn’t particularly want his name attached to.
“I need you in my office at 11.”
Bucky, upon hearing the door opening behind him, quickly stepped back and made his way over to Steve. This cleared Steve’s view, and he was finally able to make out Tony’s small form slumped over in his chair as much as his restraints would allow. The fluorescent lighting did little to hide the thinness in the man’s face, probably only making it look worse. Whilst his eyelashes were still resting gently against his cheeks, eyes closed in slumber, Steve could make out the growing signs of awareness. His head was lolling around slightly, and every now and then he’d scrunch his eyes face up and let out a little moan. If he hadn’t realised that he was probably in some kind of pain, Steve might have found the whole scene endearing. He wasn’t so naïve though, and his heart clenched at the subtle signs of discomfort, trying to bury the self-hatred he felt at being the cause of it. Whilst it was never the plan for Tony to go down the way he did, the agent really should have stuck to using the drugs he’d been given, Steve knew he had to take at least some degree of responsibility for how things had panned out.
“Didn’t feel that way.”
“You should rest; you’ve had to take in a lot today.” At that moment, Steve couldn’t be entirely sure whether the statement applied more to him or Tony. He could feel all of those hours without sleep creeping up on him.
Clint shrugs and puts and his hands up. “Hey, I’m not gonna judge you if that’s what you’re thinking. Just, uh, is making that list really necessary? We’re not in pre-school anymore, y’know.”
Fuck. Shit fucking fuck, it’s like 2012 all over again, Tony thinks grimly as he begins to run towards the direction the people are running away from. His one o’clock meeting ended on time just when the genius first heard the ruckus happening outside. Thankfully, the building he came from is only a few blocks away from where the portal has opened.
Another minute passes before Tony decides to give her an answer. And this time, he elects to be honest. It’s not like he’s gonna see her again. Besides, there’s something comforting about confessing to a stranger. They don’t know you, your story and history. So the only context they have is what you choose to share. It’s… freeing, in a way.
“It’s okay. It’s all going to be okay,” Steve says gently, and in an act of weakness he leans his cheek against the side of Tony’s head as he tightens his hold on the man. “And you have nothing to be sorry for, Tony. We’re here to help you in any way we can.”
— then we’ll figure something out.”
It’s Natasha who replies this time, much to the others’ surprise.
“Of course it’s okay.”
“You just know how to make a man feel special,” the genius remarks, and Bruce is decent enough not to point out how Tony’s grin falter at his heartfelt words.
Steve gives a short laugh before he tips his face to brush a kiss on the crown of Tony’s head. He breathes in the familiar, comforting scent that’s pure Tony, and he feels the shorter man exhale shakily before he squeezes Steve’s fingers once more.
The pressing weight in Steve’s stomach returns full force upon hearing Tony’s current condition. He bites his lower lip and trades concerned glances with the others before thanking JARVIS for the heads up.
, and
Tony feels Steve’s arms tighten around his shaking frame as the super soldier solemnly says, “Together.”
Bruce is frowning slightly, eyes faraway in thought, as he says. “It’s funny because — aside from his bruised ribs, Tony’s actually okay. Well, obviously, it’s going to take a few weeks until he’s completely healed. But aside from that, he
At least buy me dinner first, Stark.
Still, Tony hopes he doesn’t make a complete ass of himself.
Eyes crinkling at the corners, Tony nods in agreement.
Steve looks up to see Tony walking towards them before dropping inelegantly on Steve’s other side. Steve allows himself a few seconds to relish in the warm physical contact of Tony pressed up against him from shoulder to knee before he reigns in his emotions. He doesn’t think he succeeds, though, if Bruce’s sympathetic expression is anything to go by.
His body is trembling like a leaf by this point, his eyelids heavy with exhaustion. It certainly doesn’t help that Tony is awfully reminded of the gaping hole in his chest, that’s also somehow the cause of some really freaky chills that he’s felt since yesterday. Distantly, Tony hears JARVIS murmur something to him, but his mind is so far away from reality now, brain fuzzy with lethargy and feeling too snug buried under his thick comforter, reassured that his AI has done his bidding.
“What is it?” Natasha asks, eyes narrowed.
UPDATE: Thank you for pointing out that there's a missing text. I just fixed it and hope you re-read that part 'cause it's half a thousand words and provides some insight/information!
“Hmm catchy,” he hears Tony remark before he starts humming along to the song.
Of course, he also half expected the genius to take great pleasure in rubbing it in their faces, most particularly Steve’s. But in a nice way, Bruce thinks with an inward snort, considering Tony is head over heels for their leader.
He nods his head and takes a deep breath. “Right. Yeah. Thanks, Pep. You’re getting a raise.” He adds as an afterthought.
Before he can say anything over the comms, he sees Thor’s familiar figure flying overhead and sending a strong surge of lightning towards the oncoming Leviathan ships. In the distance, he can distinctly hear Hulk’s roar as he smashes the creatures left and right. Just then, a conversation from before is thrust into the forefront of his mind.
“You normally don’t listen to that kind of music,” Steve muses. Hands in his pockets, he leans one hip against the table. He’s standing close enough to Tony that he can see the light freckles dusting over his nose and the long lashes of his doe eyes.
Of course I miss you, Tony.
😚🤗😘❤️
, Clint quickly adds, “But weird in a good way. I’m sure Steve here likes it.”
“How could you have wielded Mjölnir by accident?” Bruce asks, stunned.
“You okay, Bruce?” Steve asks politely. He remembers the drink in his hand, some weird concoction that Tony carelessly thrust towards him, and takes a sip of the cool drink, careful to hide the wince at the fruity taste combined with the alcohol.
“Steve,” Tony whines, an adorable pout on his lips. “This is so not fair.”
“I — what — you…”
Tony feels Steve’s shoulders shake as he silently laughs, and the engineer stretches his lips into a lazy smile.
Have I mentioned that I hate long meetings? Cos I fucking HATE long meetings.
“I’m right next to you, Point Break, no need to shout,” Tony winces but there’s a genuine smile on his face as he looks up at Thor. “I’m fine. Peachy keen. What’s up?”
There’s a snort in front of him, and Steve turns to see Natasha staring at them with fond exasperation. Beside her, Bruce and Tony share a long look that has the former stifling a laugh and the genius to waggle his eyebrows in a suggestive manner.
Still, it’s great to see the genius take some time off of his busy schedule to attend a party that he wasn’t really obligated to attend, yet he still chose to come because it’s a farewell party for one of Stark Industries’ best R&D Engineers. Tony may be one of the busiest, if not
“Nobody wants a repeat performance of earlier,” Natasha pipes up with a knowing look. Everyone agrees with her with a shake of the head, and Steve doesn’t miss the guilty look that crosses over Clint’s face.
The silence lasts all of twenty seconds before the blond man hears Tony speak up.
Pepper sniffles against the curve of his neck, and Tony is filled with guilt for keeping one of his best friends in the dark. God forbid Rhodey finds out, and knowing Pepper, Tony knows he’ll be hearing from the Colonel sooner than later.
Oops.
“Yes, Captain.”
“JARVIS?” Steve calls out again.
, damn it. It doesn’t matter if he’s all jacked up with the serum because for Steve, he’ll always see himself as the short, stubborn, asthmatic kid from Brooklyn who still gets tongue-tied around the person he likes.
Secondly, Tony and Peter look disheveled in their sweatpants and stained white shirts. It’s their usual garb during lab time when Peter spends the weekend at The Tower, and Steve’s seen them dressed like this countless times already but the sight never fails to make Steve all warm inside.
“Of course.”
“Tony, you could be on to something,” Bruce speaks up then, and Steve averts his eyes from Tony to look at the bespectacled man who looks like he’s just discovered a breakthrough. “Would it be okay with you if you go through another MRI scan? I can use the results I got from before you woke up, but I’d like to see if there’s a difference between then and now. We can also pull up your last MRI results from before your attack. See if there’s a dissimilarity between them.”
, it should be a crime to look that delectable, the blond thinks as he swallows inaudibly. Try as he might, he can’t help the way his eyes drift over Tony’s, the material of the full-body suit clinging almost obscenely and proudly displaying the firm and compact muscles of the brunet’s lithe frame. The curve of his shoulders, followed by a teasing glimpse of collarbones that makes Steve’s mouth water with want, then to the well-defined pecs, abs and trim waist, and then those gorgeous thighs.
“Which he can’t.” Fuck.
“Didn’t stop you before when you tore down the schematics of the Chitauri’s weapons
“Morning,” the engineer says with a small smile at the Asgardian prince. “I’m fine. Thanks, Thor.”
“Wake me up in four hours, J,” he says.
Some notes:
Finally, after a long staring contest following his heartfelt declaration, Tony’s shoulders sag. Bruce remains silent as his friend lets out another sigh.
"We both know that you run the company, Pep. I'm just the pretty face," Tony said.
"You'd better," Bucky said. "Otherwise Sam might have to set you up with someone he works with!"
Tony woke up with a pounding headache, a foul taste in his mouth, an empty bed, and approximately a hundred and twenty-seven notifications. Before he could even look at his phone, Tony decided he needed coffee and painkillers. After a mediocre cup of coffee and a little bit more aspirin than is technically safe, Tony felt able, if not entirely willing, to check his phone. The first thing he saw was seven missed calls from Pepper, which filled him with dread. Tony's finger hovered over the call button as he weighed up the pros and cons of calling her back. Almost instantly, he decided that it would be better to face her wrath sooner rather than later. With a little trepidation, he called her back, putting the phone on speaker so that he could smother it with a pillow if necessary.
"No, why?" Bucky asked.
"If we were sober, it never would've happened!" Steve said, almost as if he was trying to justify his drunken mistakes. 'Because you hate me,' the unspoken ending of the sentence hung in the air between the two, not quite reaching Tony and not quite escaping Steve.
"So what happened?" Nat asked. "Apart from all the stuff about that girl you met last night."
Tony was dragged out of his drunken stupor by footsteps on the wooden floor of his hallway.
When Tony emerged into the hallway and saw Steve struggling to put his sneakers on, he felt a wave of emotion bubble up inside of him. At first, he thought he might explode like some sort of emotional volcano, but he didn't. He wanted to speak, but he didn't know what to say. Meanwhile, Steve simply looked like a deer that had been caught in headlights. He didn't dare to move, or speak, or even breathe.
"I'm sick of seeing you mope around," Sam said.
"You really don't have to do that," Steve argued. "Spend the night with Sam, I know it's date night. I'll be fine."
"Oh."
"Why are we drinking, exactly?" Nat asked after she arrived.
"Good morning to you too," Tony replied, his voice dripping with sarcasm.
"I've not moved on," Tony repeated. "All I've done since we broke up is think about you and miss you and love you. I still love you, you idiot! I always have and I always will, until the day I die and probably a long time after too."
"That's not true, Sammy," Bucky whined, pouting.
"I love you too" Nat shouted from the kitchen.
"Yeah, oh," Pepper said. "Obviously people shared them all over social media, the press got hold of them, and now you're all over the headlines. Reporters are claiming she's your girlfriend, that she's the reason you and Steve broke up, and even that you cheated on Steve with her!"
"You know that's not true, Rogers," Sam said. "If anyone's a third wheel here, it's me. I'm always the third wheel when I'm with you two."
"Yeah, that sounds great," Tony said, sounding very halfhearted.
"Not exactly..."
"That's exactly what happened! She was gone before I even woke up!" Tony exclaimed. "It reminded me of Steve, the way he just left with no warning whatsoever. I'm starting to think that everyone will just leave me!"
"I know, but I can't bring him back," Pepper said. "You need to sober up a little, you can't keep drinking like this."
As much as Steve wanted to curl up next to Tony and go back to sleep, he knew he couldn't. He might still be in love with Tony, but Tony was under no obligation to return those feelings. A drunken mistake couldn't be misinterpreted as romantic attraction. Steve simply refused to let himself get caught up in the middle of the conversation that would inevitably follow if he was still there when Tony woke up. He could almost hear Tony's apologetic tone. It would be mortifying. As slowly and carefully as physically possible, Steve snuck out from under the covers and started gathering up his clothes. It was only then that he noticed he was wearing a pair of Tony's sweatpants. He felt a slight twinge of pain in his chest at the thought of never wearing Tony's clothes again, but he refused to let himself get all sentimental. Steve carefully folded Tony's clothes and replaced them with his own. Once he was dressed, he decided to take a couple of aspirin to ease the headache that was beginning to linger like a dark rain cloud. Steve remembered enough about Tony's place to know where he kept the aspirin and the glasses. He poured himself a glass of water and winced when the pipes groaned dreadfully. He swore under his breath, hating himself for forgetting that the pipes grumble if you turn the tap on the wrong way. Steve just hoped that the noise wasn't enough to wake Tony.
True to his word, when Steve got home he pulled out his phone to install Grindr. While the app was downloading, he decided to scroll through social media. He didn't have a reason behind it, he just wanted to see if his friends were doing anything interesting. As it turns out, they were. His friend Sharon was on a date with her new girlfriend. Steve didn't know her personally, but she was pretty. A redhead. Sharon sure did have good taste. Steve scrolled past to see what his other friends were doing. Scott and Hope were having a movie night, watching some obscure sci-fi film. Steve carried on scrolling, hoping Grindr was almost finished installing. Carol and her wife Maria were looking after their daughter, Monica. Steve kept scrolling. Surely Grindr had to have installed by now. That's when he saw it. Tony. Tony was out with someone else. A girl, to be precise. Tony was out with a girl. They couldn't have been friends, he had his arm around her waist, pulling her close. She was beautiful and glamorous, she must have been a supermodel or something. No wonder Tony hadn't texted or called Steve. He was too busy. He'd moved on to someone much, much prettier. Steve felt physically sick. He could picture the things Tony was doing with his new toy. All the things he should be doing with Steve. The more Steve thought about it, the more ill he felt. She was a brunette. Did Tony even like blondes? Did he even like men? Was their whole relationship a lie? Steve felt like he could burst into tears at any given moment, so he called the one person who would always be there for him.
"Fuck that! You need something stronger. I'm bringing that Russian vodka I got last year."
"Goodnight, Tony," Pepper said as she left.
"Go away, Nat," Tony grumbled. "Nobody likes you."
"Yeah, obviously
"I know we were," Tony said, hoping that Steve would just shut up. It was so much harder for him, having to listen to Steve regret everything that had happened the night before.
That all happened weeks ago, but Steve never recovered. All he'd done was miss Tony. If he could go back in time and beg Tony to take him back, he would. Even better, Steve wanted to go back in time and stop the argument from ever happening. If Steve thought he had a chance, he'd call Tony in an instant. But he knew that Tony would never take him back. Steve was almost certain that Tony had moved on, found someone new. Tony wasn't sat at home, all by himself, wishing someone was by his side. No, Steve was. Steve was the one lying on his bed, wishing he could do something to stop the gaping hole of loneliness growing in his chest. Steve had felt low before, but never this low. He didn't want to say he felt depressed, but all he wanted to do was sleep. He'd been pushing his friends away. All he'd done was work and sleep. He was lonely. In fact, lonely didn't even begin to cover it. Steve felt abandoned. Steve was not abandoned, despite his beliefs. He had abandoned himself. There was a myriad of people waiting to help him if he'd let them. Unfortunately, Steve was as stubborn as a mule, and refused to let anyone help him. Ever.
Tony didn't say anything, he just sniffled and wiped his nose on his sleeve.
"I'll never leave you," Nat replied, taking the vodka away from Tony. "And neither will Pepper. You're stuck with us both now, until the day you die!"
"I don't mope!" Steve objected.
"No. I'm not leaving when you're upset," Steve said, sitting down next to Tony.
"Have I ever told you how much I love you?" Steve asked.
"I'm sleepy," Bucky whined, as he tried to get up off the floor. He stumbled towards Steve's bedroom, and Steve heard him flop on the bed. Steve was about to get up and join Bucky when another wave of nausea washed over him. He internally cursed whoever created vodka. Whoever it was, they were evil. Pure evil. Steve had just gotten up off the floor when he heard his phone pinged. He wasn't going to look at it, he assumed it could wait, but something deep inside him told him that he should check and see who it was.
"Steve?" Tony asked. "Is that you?"
"Gimme that," Tony said, snatching the bottle out of her hands.
"I know!" Bucky laughed.
"The one you put at the back of the cupboard that nobody's allowed to drink anymore?"
When Tony stepped down from the podium and away from the flashing cameras, all he wanted to do was go home. The blinding lights and endless questions had been a bit too much, even for Tony. He was very used to press conferences, but that didn't make them any less tiring. Despite every bone in his body aching and the overwhelming urge to nap, Tony still decided to go out to a club for a while. He did, after all, promise Nat that he'd try and find someone new, even if it was just for one night. He wished more than anything that he could text Nat and tell her that he didn't feel up to it, but he knew she'd just keep pestering him if he did. Half an hour, he vowed to himself. He'd go for half an hour. Talk to a couple of people, and if someone wanted to go home with him, he'd let them. Tony just prayed that it would be enough to get Nat off his case.
"Then yes," Nat replied. "I know I promised Pepper that I wouldn't give you any unsolicited relationship advice, but I have to. You need to move on. Find somebody new. Try and forget about what happened with Steve. Maybe if you find someone new, it won't hurt so much."
"What?" Steve knew he must've misheard Tony, because what he heard couldn't be true.
The rest of the night passed by in a blur and, true to his promise, Tony could hardly remember his own name. Luckily for both of them, Nat had only brought one bottle of vodka and they'd run out before they could cause any serious damage to either their liver or their memory. The sound of Tony's phone snapped them both pout of their drunken stupor. He wondered who it was, but assumed that whoever it was, they could probably wait. Then a little voice in the back of his mind said that it might be Steve. It was probably wrong, but it didn't hurt to check. Sure enough, there was a text from Steve. A sloppy, drunken text, but a text nonetheless.
"You know that's ridiculous!" Tony cried.
"I haven't been able to stop thinking about you. I've missed you so much I can't even put it into words. I wish more than anything that I could have you back. I know you've moved on and I'm happy for you, but it still hurts. It hurts so much," Steve barely got to the end of his sentence before tears started rolling down his cheeks.
"See! Look at you! It's like you've forgotten I'm single," Steve exclaimed.
"I don't fucking know! It was a spur of the moment thing, you know. I was pissed and I said stuff. I didn't really mean any of it! I was gonna call him the next day, but he blocked my fucking number! I would've gone to see him but I was too scared to just turn up on his doorstep and beg for him to take me back! Now he's moved on and I don't have a chance in hell to be with him again," Steve said, close to tears. "It sounds stupid, but as long as I didn't see him with someone else, I thought maybe I had a chance. Now it's all gone. He'll never want me back now! Not while he has her!"
"I haven't moved on," Tony whispered.
"Promise?" Steve asked, cursing himself in his head for sounding so pathetic.
Tony didn't think he'd been sober for much longer than fifteen minutes in a row. Having said that, he didn't know what day it was or how long it had been since Steve left, so maybe his judgement was a little bit off. He'd been drinking religiously since Steve walked out on him. He knew he ought to stop but he couldn't. Steve made him feel so much, so many feelings that Tony used to think he'd never feel again. Without Steve, he felt empty. It felt like somebody had cut him open and scooped all the good stuff out of him. He was a shell, that's all. A shell full of copious amounts of alcohol and bad decisions. Tony only drank to feel. He hated the taste of liquor and the burning sensation as it filled him up. But it didn't matter how much Tony drank. He could never feel even a fraction of what Steve made him feel. Even though it couldn't help him feel anything, the alcohol did help, in a way. It helped Tony to forget. If he drank enough, which he usually did, it temporarily wiped away the pain and the memories. Tony was able to pretend that Steve was still with him, sleeping in their bed. He could pretend that Steve still loved him, even though deep down, he knew that was impossible. People who love each other don't leave.
Steve knew he fucked up. He knew it from the moment he walked out of Tony's house and out of his life. As much as Steve hated to admit it, him and Tony were meant to be. Sure, they fought about dumb shit, but they could never actually stay mad at each other. Except this time. Steve couldn't see them making it back from this. This time, it was over. For good. Steve couldn't even remember what the argument had been about. It was something stupid and insignificant, it always was. Maybe the press had seen Tony out with someone else. Perhaps Tony was spending too much time at work and Steve was starting to feel like second-best. Tony might have become distant and Steve assumed he was cheating. Whatever it was, it pissed Steve off. It pissed him off enough to turn it into an argument. There was shouting and screaming. Steve called Tony a cheating slut, Tony called Steve an attention whore. Tony punched a wall, Steve slammed a door. Tony tried to calm down, make things right. Steve packed up all his things in a bag, told Tony he was leaving and not coming back. This time, there was no shouting, no slamming doors. Only a whisper, an unspoken apology, and the sound of a door clicking shut. All of a sudden, it was over. A relationship they'd built together for over a year came crashing down. All it left behind was silence.
"That would probably be best," Tony said, but Pepper had already hung up.
"For fucks sake," Pepper muttered, intending for Tony not to hear, and failing. "I'd better come over to coordinate damage control then, hadn't I?"
"Wow, you really don't remember, do you?" Pepper asked. Before Tony even had a chance to answer, she spoke again. "Have you even checked your phone?"
"How are you feeling?" Bucky asked him.
"Better? I don't know. It could just be the vodka."
"Yes you do," Bucky butted in. "If you're not ready for something long-term, at least download Grindr!"
"You're a disaster, Stevie," Bucky said as they walked into the lounge.
"No, not good, you have a company to run!" Pepper said.
"If you want him, go after him. He'd be an idiot not to take you back. A massive idiot!" Bucky said.
"Yeah, that one," Bucky said.
"Yeah, yeah, we promise," Bucky said. "I'm getting impatient. Either you come out or we come in." Steve grumbled, but got up to open the door.
"Yes, well, the pretty face has a press conference tomorrow afternoon, and he can't still be drunk by then," Pepper said, guiding Tony into bed. "Nat's gonna come see you in the morning to make sure you're alive and not too hungover. I've told her no to give you relationship advice, but you know hat she's like."
"No, I want to help," Steve insisted.
"You were the one that left him, Stevie," Bucky reminded him. "Why'd you do it?"
"So it is!" Tony said, slightly shocked he'd managed to sleep that late. "To answer your question, no, I have absolutely no idea."
"I remember Nat bullying me into going out. There was quite a bit of alcohol involved. I danced with a pretty guy, but I ditched him for somebody else. I can't remember who though," Tony admitted.
"Good," Tony replied.
"I know. I'm sorry," Pepper said. "Let me get you some water."
"Cheers pal!" Steve said, sarcasm dripping from each word. "You're not exactly a picture yourself!"
"I wish I'd never even done it! If I could go back, I'd undo it all!" Steve said, tears rolling down his cheeks.
"I did it!" Steve said.
"Sorry Steve," Sam said. "But you ditched Tony, not the other way around!"
"I love you too, more than I can ever say. I'll always love you Tones," Steve said, as he pulled Tony closer and kissed him. The kiss felt like everything Steve had been missing. It was fierce and passionate, but also gentle and sweet. It was Tony, and Steve couldn't have been happier to have him back.
"If you care about me, why did you leave me?" Tony asked, sniffling.
"We're worried about you, dude," Sam said. "Just come out with us and we'll leave you alone to wallow in your sorrows for the rest of the week."
"Fine!" Steve said, exasperated. "I'll look at Grindr when I get home."
"I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry," Steve said, stumbling over his words almost as much as he stumbled over his feet.
"Are you okay?" Steve asked, making Tony jump a little.
"Right now?" Steve asked. Bucky handed Steve his phone and glared at him until he started typing. Steve wasn't even sure what to say. He had a little bit more to drink, in the hope that some Dutch courage would help him figure out what the fuck to say.
Tony wasn't being particularly choosy when he picked a club to dance at, but he must have picked a decent one. He couldn't remember the name of the club, but the neon lights filled him with energy, the music filled him with happiness, and the alcohol gave him a buzz. He wasn't drunk, not yet, but he was definitely tipsy. Tipsy was good. For Tony, tipsy meant confident and fun. Drunk meant sloppy, emotional, and out of control. The music inspired Tony to go dance, which wasn't something he did very often. He found a handsome man that looked about his age and pulled him onto the dancefloor. They danced together for a while, but he reminded Tony too much of Steve. After a while, he decided to start dancing with girls instead to avoid the heartache and the memories. He found a pretty girl who went by the name of Skye and decided to spend the rest of the evening dancing with her. Sometime in between dancing and drinking, she kissed him. Sometime in between drinking and dancing, he kissed her. Sometime before 1 am, they left together.
Steve had just left Tony's place and was heading towards the nearest bus stop. Unfortunately for steve, the next bus wasn't due for over an hour. After a brief moment of deliberation, he decided to phone Bucky to come and pick him up. Steve rummaged through his pockets again and again, but he couldn't find his phone. He was sure he had it with him, but if he couldn't find it, then maybe he didn't. If he didn't have it, then it had to still be at Tony's. Shit. Steve did not want to go back, especially since Tony had made it explicitly clear that he didn't want Steve there. Steve realised he could probably survive without his phone for a few days, but he knew he'd eventually have to go back to Tony's to pick it up. It was probably better for Steve to get it all over with. Rip the bandaid off and all that jazz. Steve took a deep breath in, turned around, and summoned all the courage he could muster as he headed back towards Tony's door.
"I have a key, and I'm not afraid to use it," another voice said.
"Piss off, Bucky!" Steve replied.
"Hey," Steve said, trying his very best not to cry. "Have you seen the news?"
"I don't want water, I want Steve!" Tony cried.
"How do you feel?" Bucky asked.
"Are you sure?" Steve asked tentatively.
Many, many more drinks later, Bucky and Steve were completely pissed. Steve was sat behind Bucky, drunkenly braiding his hair. It was a sloppy braid, but a braid nonetheless. Bucky was rambling about all sorts. Steve wasn't really listening until Bucky suddenly started ranting about Tony. He turned around and grabbed Steve's face. "He's a prick. You listen to me, Stevie. He's a prick and he doesn't deserve you. You can do so much better than him, I promise."
"Go away," Tony said through the tears.
"Wake up, Tony."
Tony's only reply was a groan, as he burrowed deeper into his duvet.
"Sam will understand. Besides, he cares about you too. You need me, and neither one of us is gonna let you down," Bucky said, definitively. "I'll bring alcohol, we can get drunk and try to forget about this mess."
"I was scared," Steve admitted. "Everything was starting to happen so quickly and instead of acting rationally about it, I panicked and left. I was gonna call you the next morning to try and fix things but you blocked my number. I as too scared to turn up at your door and admit I was wrong. I'm really sorry, Tones."
"I know."
"Not yet," Steve replied. "I don't now what to say."
"Just shut up," Bucky shouted from the kitchen. Steve could hear him rummaging through the cupboards and could only assume that he was looking for shot glasses.
"Why?" Tony asked. "Why do you care? Why won't you just leave me alone?" Steve could hardly believe what he'd heard. He knew that Tony hated him, but that didn't sound like hatred.
wanted it to.
"Did you text him?" Bucky asked.
"Leave." Tony lifted his head from his hands and looked Steve in the eye. His stare was colder than ice and Steve felt a chill in the air.
"Do you know what you've done?" Pepper asked, without even saying hello.
"I'm coming over." Bucky didn't leave much room for Steve to argue, but he tried anyway.
Steve snapped out of his thoughts and his loneliness when he heard someone knock on his door. He didn't want to answer it, so he ignored it, in the hope that whoever it was would go away. They didn't. Instead, they knocked louder.
"Let's get drunk," Bucky said, handing the vodka back to Steve. "Maybe then you'll feel better."
"I'd like that," Steve said, with the tiniest hint of a smile."
"Just tell him how you feeeel," Bucky said.
Steve startled awake to the sound of birdsong, which immediately filled him with confusion and uneasiness. He lived in an apartment block that was shrouded by nothing more than other apartment blocks. There were hardly ever any birds nearby, so to hear so many of them singing so vibrantly, it threw him off guard. When Steve had woken up enough to actually take in his surroundings, he was taken aback even more. Tony was lying in his bed next to him. No, he was in Tony's bed! At Tony's place! What the fuck was he doing there? All Steve could remember about the night before was that he got drunk with Bucky. Something else must have happened for him to end up in Tony's bed. All of a sudden, a wave of recollection washed over him. He drunk-texted Tony. How could he be so fucking stupid? Steve cursed himself for not asking Bucky to take his phone away before they started drinking. Still, how had texting Tony led to him sleeping in his bed? It was all a bit of a blur, and Steve couldn't really remember anything after the vomiting and the text back. The text back! Tony texted him back! He went to Tony's place and they kissed and cuddled and drank some more. Steve had a vague recollection of sex taking place, but he wasn't sure if it actually happened or if he just
"You like me, stop lying to yourself. Now get up," Nat said.
"I'm still here because I care about you!" Steve said, exasperated. "Is that so difficult to believe?" At this, Tony started to cry once more. Steve, not knowing what to do, put his arm around Tony and gave him an awkward hug.
"You posted two photos with a girl called Skye. In one of them, you were making out with her, in another, you were cuddling in bed," Pepper said.
"Are you making coffee?"
"Yeah, it's that bad," Steve said. There was a comfortable silence for a few seconds before Steve spoke again, this time a lot quieter. "You're the best, Buck."
"Do you really think so?" Tony asked, sipping his coffee.
"Okay, just how much of last night do you remember?" Pepper asked, in a tone that resembled the one she reserved for her three-year-old niece.
"I can and I will," Tony mumbled.
"Not even checked Twitter?" Steve asked.
do," Pepper replied. "But the morons who write these articles don't. I'll put a statement out to clear everything up. I'll make it clear that you're not dating and that she had nothing to do with your breakup with Steve. Sound good?"
"Definitely!" Bucky said, grinning madly.
"What?" Steve asked, shocked.
"What if I don't want better, Buck?" Steve asked quietly. "What if I just want him?"
"Right we need to fix this whole situation," Pepper said, the very instant Tony opened the door.
"Text him. Right now." Bucky said.
"You're going to drink yourself into an early grave!" Pepper scolded him.
"I thought you were Steve," he said, his words slurring together ever so slightly.
"And what situation would that be?" Tony asked, still none the wiser.
"You should go after what you want!" Bucky encouraged him.
"No, honey, I'm sorry. It's just me," Pepper said gently, as she sat down next to Tony.
"No," Bucky said, sounding a little annoyed. "What's wrong, Steve?"
Tony woke up to an empty, yet warm, bed. He was a little confused, as he didn't remember inviting anyone over. He also knew that whoever had come over hadn't been gone long, otherwise the bed would've gone cold. He woke up properly when he heard the pipes groan in a most unpleasant manner. That meant that whoever came over was still there! Tony was surprisingly relieved that he hadn't been abandoned again, but it was weighed down by a sadness deep in his chest. Whoever it was in his kitchen, it wasn't Steve. Steve knew the correct way to turn the tap on to avoid making the pipes creak. After lying in bed for a few moments more, drowning in his sorrows and missing Steve terribly, Tony decided that it was probably a good idea to get up and see who the hell he invited over. Despite wracking his brains, he simply couldn't remember anything about the night before. His best guess was that he got drunk and texted some random stranger who came over and fucked him before they both passed out. Unfortunately, that was the best he could come up with until he put some clothes on and went to see who it was.
“Strange, you said one in fourteen million, we win. Is this the one?”
, watching our kid die right in front of me.”
“Papa sent me to come and save you,” Peter mumbled into his shoulder.
Even though his vision was slowly starting to clear now, the voice was coming from beside him, and Tony wasn’t willing to risk any other sudden or major movements. If anything, the pain in his head was getting worse without the extra triggers. Therefore, he was unable to see the owner of the voice, although somewhere in his mind he thought it sounded slightly familiar. He couldn’t deny that it was comforting, and the tension he didn’t even realise was there began to bleed out of his shoulders.
“You didn’t need to do that. You had the syringe, that would have been enough.” He scolded the second man, who held a small handgun that was dripping in the same red that was now coating Bucky’s hands.
“Tony, I’m sorry, for everything. I know you put your trust and faith in me, and I let you down. We didn’t see eye-to-eye on something, and instead of trying to solve things peacefully, I got hot-headed and rushed into things. I think I just needed to take a step back and see the wider picture. You’re a hero, Earth’s greatest defender, and you deserve better than that.”
Yeah, he’d make things right.
Tony’s heart was now hammering against his rib-cage and he knew that he’d be almost passed out from pain if he’d still had the arc reactor in. As it was, a dull ache began to radiate, not at all helped by the sight of Happy getting knocked out. It didn’t take him long to realise that these were probably the same people that had been after him for months now and that with any witnesses and back up out of the way, they’d be coming for him now.
Steve raked his eyes over Tony as the man took in the images that kept flashing up on the heads-up display. They were pictures of those missing, presumed vanished. Steve felt his concern grow but refrained himself from approaching. Earlier, once they’d managed to get Tony inside, he had almost immediately detached himself from Steve and didn’t seem to be too keen on them being close. Steve probably would have dwelt on that for a while longer if it wasn’t for the more pressing issues at hand. Tony’s face had hardened significantly as a photograph of Pepper appeared before him.
“Tony!”
“He’s been getting more restless over the past hour or so. Only now, he’s getting louder. Figured you wouldn’t want to be waiting any longer.”
“If I told you what was going to happen, it wouldn’t happen.”
So, Steve knew it was only a matter of time before Tony started to present a more serious threat. Best to get in early and stop the resistance before it got much further. No doubt Tony would be the head of it, so Steve hoped that by stopping him, he’d be stopping any opposition altogether. He knew that Tony was still unaware of his, and the ex-Avengers’, role in the slow takeover, but again, he knew that wouldn’t remain the case forever. Therefore, he’d spent the past four months trying to get his hands on the man, but either Tony was proving too smart, or maybe Steve’s men were just incompetent. It was probably a mix of the two, but Steve was beginning to realise that he was going to have to step up his efforts. All these failed attempts had only made Tony more aware of the target on his back.
“It does work.
“Hey, where’d you get that, you little rascal?” He reached forward and gently pulled the mask of his son’s head. The helmet was huge on him but still managed to mess up his hair, leaving his curls sticking out everywhere.
Pushed by the desire to make sense of his predicament, Tony forced his eyes open with an extended moan of pain. They only stayed open for a few moments, only giving him a blurry glimpse at the bare room around him, before he had to blink heavily against the
“Hey, don’t worry about it, happens to the best of us.”
Steve and Sam were spread out on the sofa, which was probably quite an accomplishment since it was a fairly small one and they were both quite big guys, watching the baseball game in front of them. The Mets were winning, so at this point, Steve was feeling pretty happy.
Tony was grateful that Steve was doing the talking. He was too caught up in the fear of losing Steve and Peter. The hand on his shoulder moved up and down in a comforting rub, seeming to sense his growing panic.
Steve did give him credit, much more than he’d ever express. He would be eternally thankful to his friend who had made all of this possible. Despite Steve’s obvious obsession with finding Tony, Bucky had helped him. He’d reigned him in, backing him down from some of the crazier ideas he’d tried to implement in his attempts to get him back, and now had ultimately been the one who brought him to Steve.
Tony slowly felt awareness creeping into each corner of his mind. First, it was the feeling of heaviness that was contrasted by a certain tightness around certain parts of his body. Next came the sounds, a distinct background humming that he couldn’t place, and at one point a few murmured voices. This was followed by a bright light that was pushing against his eyelids, and almost blinding him whenever he tried to push through the fog in his head. Now though, now he could feel his pain receptors awakening, signalling key parts of his body that were throbbing and aching. His head, primarily, was in near excruciating pain, causing him to groan at certain moments.  It radiated from a point behind his right ear, pushing against his skull and sending blood pounding next to his ears. There was also a burning sensation along his arms and a dry ache at the back of his throat.
“Tony, listen-”
“Shhh Sweetheart, you need to calm down.”
Yeah, Steve knew who the man was. He was a walking headline who couldn’t seem to keep it in his pants. “Billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, yeah I’ve heard of him. Not quite sure why we’d be writing about him though, since we’re not a gossip magazine. I mean, what does the guy even do, other than drink, party and sleep around?”
“Watcha up to?”
He was drawn out of his thoughts by a small hand thrusting its way out of the opening between the two tent flaps.
The rational part of Steve’s mind noted that what Bucky was saying made perfect sense. After every failed attempt, Tony had beefed up his security and taking a step back would be a strategic move. Only now, Steve wasn’t in a rational state-of-mind. He was pissed off and starting to get desperate. He wanted Tony
“I read your draft for this week’s article on the new meal plans-”
Tony grew more and more agitated as he continued to shout at Steve. His words were punctuated by the angry steps he took, closing the distance between the two of them.
Once it gave way, and Tony quickly picked himself up from a rather ungracious exist, he quickly spun himself around to face his attacker. Unsurprisingly, the figure was dressed in all black, but his muscled silhouette let Tony know that they were indeed a male. Quickly, thinking through a rough strategy, Tony raised his hand and shot his repulsor towards the man. With a surprisingly gracious manoeuvre, however, the man rolled off the car, dodging the beam entirely.
But then, his eyes caught the symbol in the middle of the chest. Tony felt his stomach fall away as he took in the all too familiar insignia.
Tony cocked his head at the boy, before realising that he was going to have to be the one to start the hug. Just as he turned to do so, Peter flung himself into his arms, probably with a little bit too much force, since it knocked the wind completely out of Tony’s chest. It only lasted a second, with Peter pulling back as soon as he heard Tony wheezing. “Shoot, sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to d-”
“Okay…”
have successfully been in and out.” Scott pleaded.
“Yeah…y’know, no talking to our past selves, no betting on sports events…”
“I am saved,” he responded, pressing his cheeks into his son’s curls.
“Tony, I know you’ve got a new life now, but we have to take a stand.”
“I mean…we can’t help everyone, right?”
“Steve, hey,” Natasha smiled at the sight of her friend. She skipped up to him and pulled him into a tight embrace. Much like Tony, Steve hadn’t kept in touch with the Avengers since they’d left five years ago. Tony knew it was to do with his guilt surrounding the fight in Wakanda, and their subsequent journey to space. As much as Tony tried to tell him that it wasn’t his fault, Steve wouldn’t hear it. He’d turn the words on Tony before they’d both settle into a silent understanding that it was something that would no longer be discussed.
His boss didn’t seem amused at being interrupted like that. “Hmmm…well that’s a shame really.” Steve’s eyebrows shot up at that. The man ruffled through some of the papers on his desk, before pulling one from a large pile. “I quite liked this piece as it was. You did your research, beyond the simple scope of the brief and produced something actually worth reading. A lot of effort for a one-off article buried in a Saturday paper.”
Steve finally moved then, bringing his hand, which had fallen onto Tony’s shoulder, up to his forearm, trying to calm Tony’s growing panic by rubbing up and down gently. Even though it felt kind of nice, it didn’t help much, with Tony’s breath quickening and his movements growing more frantic.
“Not that it’s a competition, but Peter loves me three-thousand. The last time I checked; you were somewhere in the low six-to-nine-hundreds range.”
Steve heard the words but remained where he was, staring adoringly down at Tony. Even the way his hair had grown out and was now slightly tousled around his forehead had Steve’s protectiveness growing stronger. Tony was meant to be innocent; he’d have to keep him away from the business side of things to maintain that. Leaving him in the care of another, even if it was his most trusted companion was frightening though, almost to the point where Steve never wanted to let Tony out of his sight.
you. Past tense. So that trumps what you need now. I said we’d lose, and you said we’d do that together. Well, we lost, and, where were you? I was in space,
Only Steve didn’t move. His brows furrowed, and he gave Tony a strange look of pity, but he didn’t move to help him out of his restraints. He didn’t so much as flinch either, which set off a little warning somewhere in the back of his mind.
Tony was well aware of the remorse that plagued Steve at the thought of his best friend, and no doubt the visit today was only amplifying that. He wanted to reach out, to comfort his husband, but he knew that the subject was sensitive, and Steve probably needed the alone time. Closing his eyes sadly, Tony turned away and headed into the kitchen to clean up.
Of course, though, the ever-present thorn in his side was forcing its way up again. Steve had tried to ignore the man, and his feelings for him, for the sake of his quest, but Tony Stark was becoming suspicious. Steve was almost impressed that he was starting to catch on, but his concern over the potential countermeasures he was starting to take was forcing his hand. By keeping tabs on the man over the two years since the whole Accords debacle, he’d taken note of the small force of individuals he was rounding up. On top of that, he’d only been showing just a little bit too much interest in foreign elections and politics for Steve to ignore.
Steve almost growled at the mention of Bucky, the same protectiveness he felt in Siberia flaring up again before he reminded himself that Tony simply wasn’t in the right mind, that it was his job to set things straight. He only took a small amount of joy in having to do so.
Peter sighed dramatically. “That was the worst story, ever. Papa’s was
“I know you’ve got a husband now,” Scott’s eyes drifted over his ring, “and a son, but I lost someone really important to me. A lot of people did. You can help bring them back.”
Tony’s tensed up as his son pointed over his left shoulder. The sound of a car door thudding shut seemed to confirm what his son had said, without him having to turn around. Finally, moving to face his new guests, Tony was near overwhelmed by emotions.
“We all lost, Tony…”
he resists,” He pointedly ignored Bucky’s eye roll at that “then we’ll start on his treatment.”
“Maybe we should stick to the penne next time, babe.”
, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. He’s the CEO of Stark Industries. It was his father’s company up until his death in ’91. Tony Stark only claimed the position a couple years back. The company was the top military contractor with one of the most innovative and advanced weapon production sectors out there. Now, the key word here is ‘was’. Yesterday, Stark announced that he was shutting down the weapons division immediately. This comes only two weeks after he announced he was shifting the headquarters of Stark Industries from Los Angeles to New York.” His boss paused to take a breath and stared expectantly at Steve.
Tony heard the quiet giggle of his son before he exited the room and pulled the door closed quietly behind him.
Although neither he nor Steve donned their suits and went around saving the world anymore (not that there was much they could do after failing so hard the last time), they told their son endless stories about the heroics of the Avengers, and all the times they had assembled in the past. The stories were all diluted, of course, romanticised versions that skipped over all the pain and heartache in between – it was fair to say that the name ‘Bucky’ had never been uttered in front of Peter. Peter loved them anyway, probably more so than he would’ve if he’d been told the full recounts, and would often run around pretending to be one ‘hero’ or another.
Tony was back where he belonged, and it wouldn’t be long now before he realised that as well.
It had taken some time, but Tony was finally starting to reconcile with the memories he had of the man, separating Steve’s best friend from HYDRA’s assassin. It wasn’t easy by any means, thinking about the man who had murdered his parents, but the more time he was given, the more Tony thought that he’d be able to accept it and move on. It seemed like that was really what his life was about nowadays – accepting and moving on.
Knowing that it was already getting late and that Peter had school in the morning (not to mention the fact that May would skin him alive if Peter got home much later), Tony carefully shook the boy’s shoulder. He knew that he was susceptible to nightmares and that suddenly waking him up was probably not a good idea.
Steve was sitting quietly in his small art studio. It was actually just the attic that had been stripped and converted, giving Steve his own little space in the house. They’d replaced the roofing with large windows, allowing streams of light to pour into the room all day long. At night time, it gave an amazing view of the stars above. Although Steve constantly tried to stop him, Peter could often be found trying to sneak up here at night to catch a glimpse of them.
Steve smiled at his friend’s attempt to redirect his focus. He spied the barista placing his drink on the pick-up counter with a little bit more force than was probably necessary. “Yeah, I’ll catch you later.”
The man who’d first attacked him now held him gently in his arms, cursing at the sight of blood running down Tony’s neck. Steve wasn’t going to like that, at all.
important was getting out of this hellhole.
“We already did. And we lost. So without a safe, reliable, certain way for us to navigate this ‘quantum realm’, I can’t help you.”
Peter nodded emphatically. So, Tony proceeded to tell him about the Howling Commandos, and their heroic adventure through Italy to capture Zola. He gave plenty of background too. He spoke about how Bucky would jump in to save Steve when he was getting beaten up by some bully in a back alley. He slipped in a couple of anecdotes about Steve’s endless bouts of illness throughout childhood, too, and how Bucky had been the one to nurse him back to health – or at least back to the closest he could get to health. It all ended with the fight on the train, and the very vague description of Bucky being thrown off the mountain.
Tony couldn’t stop the smile that quirked up on his lips at the announcement.
He couldn’t place a single one of his injuries, and whenever he tried the pain only intensified. The last thing he remembered was dropping Peter back at his apartment after a long weekend at the compound. He was pretty certain of the memories that were telling him that Peter had gotten home fine, an image of him running up to the entrance of the building with a giddy smile on his face. But if that was the case, Tony couldn’t place the events that could have led him into his current situation.
“Black Widow!” His son gasped loudly.
“Hey! What are you doing up Mister?”
He peeked around the corner into the living room, catching sight of his husband hunched over on the sofa. Tony sighed softly, knowing that it was just one of those days. They’d been doing so well lately, with no major slip-ups in the past month or so.
“I lost the kid. Our kid. Peter’s gone.”
The set of cold eyes travelled over to him. They didn’t light up with their normal spark as he let his eyes roam over Steve’s body, instead remaining dull and pained.
Only seconds after he had the gauntlets on, the same hand came through his window, showering his back in glass fragments. It reached around, feeling the air where Tony had been sitting only moments before. If he’d had more time, Tony might have taken note of the fact that it was a black, metallic arm that was reaching around, but instead, he just threw himself towards the other side of the car, fumbling for the handle.
“Will that be a problem?” His boss’s eyebrows were raised half questioning, half threatening.
“Good, because you had me worried there.”
“Good. I’ll be expecting you then.”
Steve began to grow uncomfortable under the other man’s gaze. It was already 11:12 and the man had yet to say a word. Instead, he almost seemed to take pleasure in the growing uneasiness of the man in front of him. Steve just fiddled with a loose thread on his trousers, hoping that this meeting wasn’t going to end in his firing.
Steve knew that the situation was heading downhill fast. There hadn’t been much of an initial calm period like he’d been expecting. Instead, Tony had almost instantly begun to struggle against his bonds and plan a mode of escape. Steve had really been hoping that his brain wouldn’t start-up again that quickly, that he could try and subdue the man before he got too worked up, but it was clear now that his moment had passed.
, if not three months ago when they first attempted to take him. “I don’t have that kind of patience, Bucky. You know how much I need this.”
He turned his gaze over to his husband, who seemed far away, lost in his own thoughts. Judging by the furrow of his brows and the slight downturn of his lips, he was probably thinking back to the day’s event as well. He was eating absentmindedly, but mainly just pushing the spaghetti around in his bowl and looking into the distance. Tony frowned at the sight, knowing just how torn up about failing Steve had been. Whilst both of them had their problems, it was common during the first two years away for Steve to wake up screaming out for one of the Avengers they’d lost, or zoning out for long periods of time, with Tony unable to bring him back. Together, though, they’d worked through that. They’d been able to overcome the worst of the PTSD, and Peter was a large part of that.
The surge of emotions flooding through him just reminded him that eventually, this would all be worth it.
“We’ve got our second chance, right here. We can’t roll the dice on it.”
It had been five years since he’d had any direct contact with any of the other Avengers, save for Steve and Rhodey. The memories of their failures, both before and after Thanos were still fresh for him. The desire on Nat’s behalf to continue to operate as a hero team, to help others out and maintain a sense of order was too much. All it did was remind Tony of what he’d done wrong, of how he’d come face-to-face with the titan, and come away alive, whilst others weren’t so lucky. No, he hadn’t been able to stick around, to dwell in that past and pretend that things weren’t his fault. Steve’s offer had been too perfect to refuse.
“You’re sticking with ‘Steven?’”
“Hey! I got him back for you, didn’t I? Give me a little credit.”
“Dad…Dad, no…please. I'm sorry. Come back. Pops, we can rebuild the time machine, we can bring him back.”
After an overly excited bath time, that ended with Tony soaked from head to toe – yet somehow Steve had managed to avoid all of the splashing – they’d finally managed to produce a clean Peter. They’d come to the agreement that Steve would put him to bed, whilst Tony now had to have another shower. He made his way slowly over to the master bedroom but paused at the soft sound of Steve’s voice echoing from the room to his left. Peering quietly through the open door, he took in the sight of Steve sitting at the foot of their son’s bed, running his hand through Peter’s hair.
Not wanting to have to repeat himself, Tony almost cried in relief at the sight of Peter running out of the front door. He launched himself at Tony, grinning widely as he was scooped up and plonked onto his lap.
“It kind of seems like we can…”
He’d had help of course. It wasn’t hard to get the Avengers who had sided with him over the accords to join him, and Bucky had naturally become his second-in-command. As much as it displeased him to do so, he’d kept the name of the organisation, to ensure that those who’d previously worked for it would stay on. Not everyone had left after the collapse of SHIELD, instead remaining a bunch of separate cells that were struggling for leadership. Now though, HYDRA worked as a fully operational network, on its way to unstoppable.
Tony smiled at his son, who was lying down in bed, a satisfied look on his face. Tony held the remnants of the orange flavoured ice block that Peter had chosen. He hadn’t eaten much of it, leaving the majority to Tony.
Tony fell back from his kneeling position, his body going limp under the stress of the moment. Hearing Bruce calling out worriedly again had Steve collecting him into his arms and rushing him over to one of the medical rooms.
“You can explain that to the Captain.”
“That won’t work. You know that, I know that. The most likely outcome will be our collective demise.”
Slowly, Tony’s eyelids began to flutter shut, as much as the man tried to resist it. Probably out of defiance more than anything else, he held Steve’s gaze with a glare, his jaw set as he inevitably began to drift off. Steve remained in position until he felt his body go limp. His eyes softened at the sight, the stress lines in Tony’s face fading away once more, his jaw slackening and his head lolling into his palm.
