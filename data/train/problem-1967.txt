“Talk to me Sherlock”
“Thanks, but she’ll be alright with Pepsi at Mike’s. What stuff in the evenings can he possibly have? “ John was sincerely confused.
“If I fall asleep and have a nightmare, I may be disoriented, and throw things around. She’ll scare.”
“Oh! Well thank you so much for that. And also for scaring the living hell out of us all. “ And she would say no more, just banged down the cup of tea, and the tasty cranberry scone in front of him.
“I did not deduce. That would have meant I thought about… your dating life. I was merely informed of the situation.” he answered.
“Of course, dear. Make yourself at home. I’m summer cleaning.” Sherlock took a seat next to her armchair, his shoulders against the arm rest, and hugged his legs, losing himself into thought.
“Ah, mate. I’m thankful Myc and I waited this long to sort ourselves out. Had it happened when I was still in the Yard, we wouldn’t have lasted. As is, I’m retired, and I can follow him around.”
You don’t think all of those actions show love? You may have never said as much to them, but your affection for Wiggins is clear as day. You even set him up with Molly!! Why? Because you knew it would be the best thing that could happen to him. You don’t abuse your Homeless Network. You make their bad situations a little, or a lot better, you act in favor of them, you care for each one of them. You know them. Where you got the funds for it, the time and the emotional energy, who knows.”
"Yes. You were having a nightmare. How is your foot? Do you need some medicine?” John was holding his hand, but using a neutral, doctor like tone.
*******
“Nope…” said Rosie.
“gone.... He took her.”  Sherlock explained the best that he could. Mycroft was able to put the pieces together.
“Sorry, it must be so hard! I don’t know what I would do without my mum! You have your real dad and the detective man, right? People say he’s horrible and mean. Is it true he does experiments in your house?” At this point, Pepsi had wisely come to stand between the two girls, as Watson’s eyes were flaming.
John also started to go on cases with Sherlock again. Granted, there hadn’t been a surplus of risky cases. This one, though was: A disgruntled ex-employee was suspected of killing three bus drivers of the route he used to work before getting fired for mouthing off at his bosses.
John had to admit the meeting had gone quite well. Mrs. Hudson occupied a central place on the tree, with Harry and Meghan, Mike and Bill as siblings of a sort, on his side. On Sherlock’s side, his parents, The Queen (how they had laughed at that!), Molly and Greg. Sherlock had delicately mentioned Mary and nearly had his head torn off with an emphatic “Nope!” Mike’s Melanie and Peggy (Whom Rosie called Pepsi, ever since she could talk) were labeled cousins.
Rosie explained. “He didn’t so much teach me, as much as allowed me to observe him.”
“Did he ever extend the same courtesy to you?” Harry asked.
They got together quietly, each undressing the other, kissing, getting in bed, touching and licking and kissing languorously. John kissed him lovingly. They had had make up sex, needy rough sex, playful, acrobatic sex that left them both panting and sweaty (and sore the next day, they were fit, but far from 20, even 30). This, though, this called for love, for savoring, for a deeper connection.
Sherlock then put John’s hands against the wall and asked him to raise himself on his knees, legs open. Then parted John’s cheeks and licked down the stripe of the part, wetting around the ring of tissue, making John yelp first, out of surprise, and then moan, loudly. Sherlock laved up and down the puckered skin, wetting it completely and teasing the entrance with the tip of his tongue, while his love made the most beautiful sounds. Sherlock had to will himself to calm down, to be able to continue. He touched John’s legs, his chest, his nipples, his hand slowly stroking over the sensitized skin, then came back to his task and circled the rim again, picking up the pace and pushing his tongue in, making John shout. He set up a quick, forceful pace, and slapped John’s hand away, when he went to touch his own cock. When he had done all the opening that could be done in this fashion, he moved out, not before smacking a kiss there, and lubed his fingers. John was tight, and very willing. One finger went in, while the other hand played with his balls again, the next finger went it with more lube, and soon John was fucking himself against Sherlock’s fingers. Sherlock took a moment, to give himself a couple of strokes, and lube up. He positioned himself and pushed in gently, without stopping until he was fully inside. Oh, John was so tight.
“Is there any substance to those fears?”
“Sherlock Holmes has been admitted with a grave injury. You were not only present, you have also accompanied him in the ambulance. May I ask why?”
John ended the call and turned the phone off. He put the package in a carrier bag, and went to meet Sherlock, calling him as he rode in the cab.
Please
“He told Rosie’s teacher we were “separated because we had never been married, therefore couldn’t divorce.”
Keep the mind busy, the body active, don’t think, don’t feel, can’t sort this out, not now. Work, research, phone on vibrate. No Watson, she’s with her grands, Box, Work, work, run, work.
“Back to my flat?” asked John, once they were done at the site, as Sherlock was clearly in the mood to continue his sulk.
-Worked through that. It’s alright, John. You decided against it. I was taken by surprise, and reacted badly. I should have stayed. We could have danced. SH
“You should know I am purposeful in my actions, John Watson. I do what I mean to.”
Afterwards, feeling better, he made his way to the kitchen, were Luther had made blueberry pancakes, served with delicious smelling, strong black coffee and honey.
Sherlock was sitting next to John, in a long sleeve maroon shirt and black trousers looking frankly uncomfortable, as if he didn’t know his place. They had smiled and Sherlock had deduced her new job as a dance teacher in a girl’s school, while John and Harry caught up on the lives of a few acquaintances. John laughed and placed a hand on Sherlock’s, who almost jumped out of his seat at the touch, but kept his hand where it was. Hmm, not so broken up any more? She looked at Harry, who was looking at the men’s hands, hawkeyed. Rosie was looking at her phone, trying hard not to show her smile.
John would have said no, if Sherlock hadn’t sounded sincere and added the “with me”. As it was, D.I Harris insisted on driving them, in his unmarked car. Sherlock sat in the front with Harris. Harris was talking about a town in Scotland, where Sherlock had some family. Sherlock steered the conversation towards the Yard and Lestrade. He included John in a conversation about some of their funniest cases. John joined in, soon all three men were laughing as John told the story of the flying monkeys.
“At the time, we thought she was running from AJ, the last member of AGRA, who was accusing her of having betrayed him. However, when we found her, we realised AJ had followed us. He had never left the country until we did. The local police ended up killing him because he was pointing a gun at Mary. I believe John wanted some kind of closure; from what he said, it was more about Rosie and also not knowing if Mary had been forced to leave, was hurt or dead. I know they were having trouble with the marriage. Actually since she shot me.”
“Think something came up. Goodbye, Luther. Say bye to Iyanna for me.” Sherlock said in a rush.
********
The man reached his car, and got away. John had the presence of mind to press the 999 on his phone as he reached Sherlock. Still alive. Oh Christ, he was reaching up. John stopped Sherlock’s hands from touching his neck and the blood that covered his shirt.
“Not only am I certain it is broken, it’s broken in three places. It’s hard to see this fracture here…” he showed her on the x-ray “...on the cuneiform bone. It appears to have slid out of place. You’ll need an MRI to see it clearly. The fracture on the phalange is simple, were it the only issue, a cast and six weeks of rest would be enough, but here…” John looked at the husband, who was grey with anguish, and the teacher, who looked incredulous.  “...the metatarsal has not only broken, but shattered. You will need an operation to remake the bone and prevent future deformation. Sorry, it will be a whole season before you can go back to work. Depending on your surgeon and your commitment to healing, you might be able to start your class next year. Till then, it’ll be bed rest, foot up for a month at least, then walking with crutches from 6-8 weeks.”
She didn’t. Taking her bookbag with her, she strode to the only bedroom in the flat and majestically shut the door, too soft to be a slam, to loud to be polite. John sighed; leaving Baker Street was supposed to mean leaving Sherlock behind. Now he had to deal with a mini version of him, who talked to herself in French just to goad him, it seemed, and rejected his invitations to play board games (they’re tedious) or read alouds (I can read by myself now. Besides you can’t make all the voices.) Rosie preferred to read her books on the sofa, with the telly on Discovery Kids.
The men fell asleep as soon as they got under the covers. John woke up before Sherlock did. He thought he could look at him sleeping all day long. Then he remembered how apprehensive the younger man had been about Lestrade congratulating them. Had he thought John didn’t want people to know about them? He thought about how sure Sherlock had been that John would go out with Sarah, and how Mycroft had used John’s past with women to make Sherlock believe he would trade him for an attractive girl..
Rosie soothed Pepsi, “Besides, Pepsi, you and I are a great team. You read the clues out loud and help me think, we will find things faster like that. Once we’re done, we’ll find Allison and go help her out.” Allison frowned.
They were having their drinks, when a new song came on, and they heard someone hoot. Angie smiled, looking out at the dance floor. “Well, somebody is having fun!” John half thought he may have to take Angie to the dance floor in a minute, when he turned around to look at the dancers, his heart speeding up when he spotted Sherlock, apparently alone, not just dancing, but putting on a full performance; “Now I’m out here looking like revenge, feeling like a ten…” Oh yes, he looked like a ten alright, God, he could dance. It was almost indecent  “Yeah I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this, but it gets worse....” God yes, did it hurt to see him down there and not be able to be there next to him.“...The grass is greener under me, bright as technicolor, I can tell that you can see…” John could see clearly that Sherlock was by far, the most beautiful human being in the club. His shirt was shiny, the bloody leather trousers must be painted on. Sherlock had cut his hair very short, his curls barely visible. John wanted to go down there and take him home with him, very badly. But he was on a date, and they were broken up.
Ms. Lane stayed, talking to them both: “ Now that I have you here, I would like to give you a heads up. The new unit we will begin next week deals with family. Our first topic will be family trees.”
“How did you know about the guilt?” asked the man, extending his hand to him, “Wilson Sternbach.” And Sherlock knew one of those names was a lie. American, 5’9, some 7 years older than Sherlock. Thin, low muscle mass, suffered a major illness a while back.  Brown sandy hair, lively brown eyes, nice smile.
Everything that is right is thanks to them. All mistakes are mine. I also want to thank the readers who follow this monster of a story, the ones who comment, those who kudoed,  those who stay for a chat, or reach out to me on Tumblr. All of you have made this experience so much better than what I expected when I started posting. You guys are fantastic! and amazing!
“Yes, I scraped that and my knee. I meant to clean it when I got home but kept forgetting.”

“Yes, but I didn’t take it.” said John.
John turned to Sherlock, astonished, to find the genius was no longer next to him, but sitting on the bench. John stepped towards him. “Did you hear what she said to us?” he asked.
He did feel the exhilaration of a job well done, and that made him think of John. It had been a while, seeing how this was the first day with a lull after the Watson days and the case that came immediately after. Now, without anyone to dissect the case with, and no desire to go box, Sherlock was restless with excess energy.
I will never be able to thank
John entered the room then, with Mycroft in tow. Sherlock smiled. “Of course, you had to have your hands in this, brother.”
Sherlock kept going to the Yard, working now on a case of apparent poisoning of a  homeless person, whose family members had been looking for him. He was able to report to Dr. Quentin that even though he was in the neighborhood where he used to buy, and even though he still felt urges at times, he had been able to go and interview the witnesses, without having to ask the DI for support once, even though Donovan had made sure he knew she was ready to be called in if needed. After what had been a long stretch with nothing new on the case, one of the witnesses had a name. Sherlock had also felt good about relegating the tip to Stewart, a young new fellow who showed some promise, and who was not an addict in recovery for suicide ideation.
To John this information filled in many gaps about the time after Cardiff. That he had voluntarily stayed with Mycroft meant the situation had been truly dire. John shamefully remembered thinking that if Rosie had thrown a tantrum, Sherlock would be in the same state. Mike’s and Greg’s reluctance to talk about Sherlock, Mycroft’s aggressiveness, and Rosie’s sadness, and Mrs. Hudson’s talk the other day made sense now. John had suspected Sherlock had been using, though he had carefully kept those ideas to himself, and he was now happy he had.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course I will. I don’t intend to change the arrangement! That was just for the weekend…”
“No! Don’t pull out! I...just need air.” Sherlock was pale and soft. John couldn’t kiss his lips as he would have liked, but kissed all reachable parts of him. “It’s alright if you need to stop. We can always try again,” John started.
Luther caught his choice of words. He smiled and took Sherlock’s hand in his huge one. They walked to his car, and went to Luther’s nice flat. Luther talked a bit about the club owner friend who asked him to DJ and how they knew each other since they had a rock band in highschool. He asked Sherlock about his hobbies, then about being a Consulting Detective a bit. He made some drinks for them.
“I would like you to - fuck me.” Sherlock was flushed and sweaty.
“I was scared they would take me with them. I was afraid they would do something to John and you!” Rosie cried
“Like a right arse. I want to live my own life, but I’m not out to hurt him” They moved along to talk about Rosie and school.

“How have you been doing with talking about Sherlock? Have you told anyone you guys are reunited?” She asked.
“John, it doesn’t matter.” grumbled Sherlock
There was a moment of silence, as the two looked at each other. John was amazed at what he saw. A young man, couldn’t be older than 20, in a white t-shirt that floated about him and jeans that had seen better days ages ago, rail thin arms, full of track marks. Eerie, beautiful eyes, ringed with blue, green and yellow, dilated, as their owner was high as a kite.
“I personally investigated the photographer who will be at the ceremony and the reception. There will be no surprises at this wedding!”
Harry told them, “She has been trying not to be worried, but she was afraid you two would fight, and that you wouldn’t stay together.” Sherlock sneaked a quick glance at John. John felt it and said, “We will stay together. I will do everything in my power to make sure we do.”

Sherlock took her hands away from her face, “I believe these people, very unlike you, did not have enough intelligence to carry out their plans. You, on the other hand love, were just brilliant!”
Sherlock kneaded the muscles, and John let out a moan, “oh, you mad man, you’re sodding terrific”
When he felt himself closer Sherlock said; “Change position.”
Sherlock looked at her wide eyed, then laughed. “Point taken Molly. I apologize. Don’t be angry. Answer the phone nicely, will you?” He said the moment before it rang.
on YouTube. Thank you for reading, giving kudos and commenting!!
John didn’t think that Mycroft was the solution, “Let’s think about that a little before we ask him. Fortunately these people are clearly amateurs. Not only is she ok, she’s shown us how well she can react in this kind of situation…”
People started exiting the auditorium, having to sign the children out in order to leave. The concert signaled the closure of the school year. Friends and family who had attended started leaving. Rosie saw Nyla and Pepsi and ran to hug them.
“Sorry, Molls. I didn’t mean for this…”
“He said not separated. He said I am broken up from him. It’s been 6 months and 3 weeks now. So this is my business, alone. I want to go with you.” Sherlock said, determined.

“Mendez attended him in emergencies, but he’s not the primary.” John said
The day of the races Sherlock gathered the three of them together and gave out his instructions. They competed against the other family. Even though the others were return guests, the Holmes Watson team would have won, had it not been for John being all over the moon looking at both his loves. He started late and lost to the other team’s mother. Her family celebrated noisily, while Rosie came running over to him to check if he was alright. Sherlock came as he assured Rosie everything was ok. Sherlock took one look at him, tilted his head and said, “Seriously? Really John?” His eyes however had gone soft and his face was pink with the cold. That night they waited until Rosie had fallen into an exhausted sleep in her room next door and made love quietly and oh so tenderly.
name!”
Mrs H knew what John was feeling. She had seen it in Sherlock many times since their break-up. John was jealous. Though personally, Mrs Hudson didn’t think Sherlock’s relationship had any real future. Sherlock was adamant that they were not romantic and that Luther had a family to go back to, she didn’t tell John that. Let him. Let him feel what Sherlock had more than once. It might just rightly wake the daft man up.
Sherlock stood straight immediately and brushed his hand off on his coat to shake John’s hand. “John…,” he said solemnly, as if he were greeting a long lost acquaintance from uni days, “...fancy you, out on a case.”
********
The evening went very well. They talked about the case, about Wiggins, who was indeed doing well, after a year of having broken up with a long term girlfriend, a lady some years older than him, who hadn’t been able to let go of an opportunity to teach the use of 3D copiers for planning difficult surgeries in South America. Bill had decided to stay, pursuing his promotion at Sanaf.
This story is brought to you by my patient, hard working Betas,
“Woohoo, Sherlock? DI Greg is here! He wants to talk to you!”
The drivers succumbed to poisoning, falling asleep and dying without recovering consciousness hours after their fatal encounter. Sherlock took the bus, calculated the average speed the drivers used. He graphed the speed at each different stop and kept tabs on them. When he saw a bus slow down drastically, he sent in Donovan, to check on the driver. He’s been poisoned, but after a couple of difficult days, he survived. Sherlock interrogated him and the man recalled the stop where a guy got on and struck up a conversation. The suspect had told him he used to be a driver, they talked shop. The bus swayed and the man almost fell. The driver held out his hand, the man took it, driver felt a tiny pinch, nothing really, bus started slowing down three stops later.

Dear Readers, beware! The New 221B requires lots of creative license! I took many liberties with space and major renovation times.
“It can’t be nothing, if it made you sad. What about tonight made you sad?”
Sherlock smiled then, “Try then, husband.” At that, John smiled a big happy smile.
“Eh, what’s tonight, Tuesday? Um, he usually isn’t available on Tuesdays or Wednesdays, has sports and-things.” Greg said.
DJ  announced his last set of the night. He put on “New Rules” to keep Sherlock dancing. Followed it with “Came Here For Love” (Sigala, Ella Eyre) , At “...I came here for love…” Sherlock took a deep breath and looked up to find the DJ looking at him, Sherlock smiled at him.. “Therapy” (Armin Van Buuren). At some point, he held up a new water bottle for him, which Sherlock gratefully took.  He mixed in “Dangerous (Roxette). Sherlock danced his way closer to the DJ stand. “Complicated “ (David Guetta-Sia). Their eyes locked. DJ winked, Sherlock smiled. DJ announced his last song was “This is What You Came For (Calvin Harris)” Sherlock danced for the DJ, who took his fill of looking him up and down. Sherlock lip synced the lyrics: “...I say, your place when we leave.” Then gave him a saucy grin
John proceeded to pretend he did not see the guarded, careful look Sherlock gave him, or his long fingers flickering against his thigh, as he went to join Rosie. John stayed where he was, and when Ms. Lane left to do her rounds, he talked to Ms. Ruiz, chatting her up.
Daddy gave him a moment, then called him to the window, to see the back yard. “Sherlock, come love. Look at all that he’s done. He looked at so many pictures. He wanted everything to match the colors in your eyes. Down to the little spot.” Sherlock blinked at that for a moment.
“Not really? Some more whisky would be nice?” John tried. Molly rolled her eyes. “Alright then, tea it is.”
Greg’s eyes went wide at that. He went on “...Sherlock you are being careful??”
Sherlock sat down once again in front of Dr.Q. ”I rather think we tore down our old relationship and are building a new one. In this one, I try my best to communicate. It's still a challenge for us. I was honest with John about the extent of my health issues resulting from the gunshot and the drug use. I hadn’t told him about the recent cardiologist visits. I lay out that it was the one of the reasons why I haven’t dealt with cases over a 6, other than a couple of exceptions. The most important reason is Rosie of course.”
“Well, maybe he was here more in a business capacity.” John said amicably.
“With all due respect, Dr. Watson, you do not have the clearance to participate in the Yard’s business! Sherlock needs a person who will not invalidate what he does!”
“Fair enough. How did you know I had a relationship with a man that didn’t work out?’ Luther’s smile was encouraging.
“That was - awesome!” Sherlock turned around, surprised, to look at the source of the voice.
John smiled. They approached the “mountain” which was tall enough for an adult. The birthday boy, Jackson, came running towards Rosie. “Grandpa says we have to stretch our legs first! We go to the trampoline! Your dad can go to him!” Jackson said, pointing to the side of the mountain.
“There you go, calmly. You don’t want to make a mistake and hurt an officer.” He continued his slow, small steps towards them. “Just put the gun down, give us a little information…”
They had parted today with something feeling lighter between them, that they could still work on something together, still laugh. John had been delighted to see Sherlock was not being the cold, aloof machine he had been during the last bit of their relationship, and the first weeks of their separation. Sherlock had made it clear he did not care what John did. Hadn’t demonstrated a bit of discomfort when John had his boxes ready and moved out.
“Tell me about Sholto…,” Harry asked quietly.
“The best way of successfully acting a part, is to be it. I needed to be an addicted, homeless, youth. I was working a case. Those Germans are trafficking young homeless people. I needed to attract them and infuriate them to get information.The DI doesn’t know who they are. I saw them all, know their names. I can identify them. I was also giving the government the finger.”
“Can’t you hear him from there? He most certainly is!”
“You know what?  I can’t take it anymore!! Another room isn’t far enough. You think my life is boring, I say it’s purposeful. I have a daughter to be there for, to be present for. And yeah, there has been no partnership lately, and certainly no affection coming from you. So, maybe I will relish time without you. Maybe I will take my daughter and let you be! No more little girl depending on you, no more partner to point out your errors and hurt your tender sensitivities.” John wanted to poke Sherlock out of his mask, wake him up...
For Sherlock, it was exhilarating, the case finally showing an opening! The suspect within reach! Young, strong, accomplice. The man looked frightened and insecure with the gun. Looking at Sherlock, hoping for a way out.
(See the end of the chapter for
The young man, Hal, came to stand in front of him and touched his legs with one of his, put a hand on Sherlock’s thigh, “I don’t think our age difference would be any problem at all. You are so hot, Daddy.”
Daddy Holmes handed John a manila envelope. It held the title to a cottage in Sussex Downs. “What is this? This is way to much, Mycroft.”
“I won’t go home with John. Nothing good would come of that. I came here alone. I would go home alone, but I would rather go with you.”
John deduced the situation pretty easily. “Wow, I see there is love between the DI and you. Lestrade must be jealous.”
Sherlock settled in John’s arms, head on his good shoulder. “Thank you John.”
John cleared his throat, “Timing, Sherlock.”
“Sherlock, it could be better for you than a visit to hospital. Some kind of assistance  is necessary for you to go on with your life, brother. You are not working, you stay inside, you can’t be at Baker Street, and John has been pestering Greg asking after you and why you remain here. I think he believes I’m keeping you against your will.” Mycroft said.
(The * show text responses that Sherlock thought he should answer John with, but didn't send)
“Now, touch my chest, make circular movements around my nipples, don’t touch them yet. Three minutes.” Sherlock followed directions, the sad, lost look lifting. John gave him several more directions, which Sherlock carried out. “You are so good to me, Sherlock. Kiss me now, kiss my face, my neck, my mouth.” As he let Sherlock do that, he touched his body, his back, his arms, noticed he was soft, but participating, wholeheartedly.
Sherlock took him past the kitchen to the second floor, where the tiny room he had used before they had been a couple was expanded. It had a bigger, comfier bed, closets and drawers, a bookshelf and a shared bathroom. This was Watson’s room.
John, who not so long ago would have turned around and walked away, now quietly followed Sherlock for a bit. Once they went inside, he stayed in the sitting room, looking at his phone. He got up to show Sherlock a picture. It was the day of Jackson’s birthday. Luther and Sherlock, walking away, hand in hand. Sherlock was closer to the camera, and his smile was beautifully captured. “I would never ask you to regret someone who made you feel like this. Honestly, it’s what I strive to do now. Make sure I show you how much I care in public, as much as in private.”
In the warehouse, she aimed the gun at John first, telling me she would give it to me afterwards and I would take care of myself, to make it a murder/suicide scenario. I was able to come out of the drug enough to try to get the gun out of her hands, but she still shot John. Fortunately, the bullet only grazed his head, but I thought he was dead. I threw myself on him, too late, but just in time to give Lestrade a clear shot. He killed her. Apparently, I had texted him and Mycroft knew of the warehouse.
After the grooms signed the Marriage Certificate, Rosie and Pepsi came up with the rings. In this, Sherlock had wanted them to match, and had a 24 k gold ring made in the style of Major Watson’s ring. Instead of “In Service Of The British Army” John’s read “In Service Of England”. The back sported an engraved  magnifying glass, a deerstalker and a bee, instead of the Lion and Crossed Swords insignia, with the name Holmes where the Watson was on his ring. Sherlock had kept the words on the inside; “loyalty, duty, respect, love”.
“Yes, we have established I am, now kindly shut up.”

Had he? Had he already? If he did, it had been the worst. No. He was still walking. So confused. Lost? In London? The lights looked too bright. Since when were these streets so noisy? Where to find Wiggins? Funny that! Wiggins now worked for Sanof, didn’t he. This wasn’t the right neighborhood. Nothing looked familiar. He was out of practice. His Belstaff looked out of place. He walked. His legs were made of lead. He saw her text in his mind; “...don’t do something stupid Bumble.” Walk, Holmes, walk.
For Sherlock, however, it was as good as over. He could neither lie to himself, nor continue to have sex with Luther, when his heart, idiotic transport, insisted on belonging to the man who broke it.
Sherlock’s neck, “This is for when you played with your collar in Baskerville."
“I was upset. He said it in front of people who didn’t know us. So I corrected him. I said that we were ‘broken up.’ For a second there, he looked hurt.”
These incidents had a common denominator. John had taken Sherlock for granted, or had been mean, even unkind towards him. The comment Harry had made about him behaving like Mary had stung John and made him think. Unfortunately, it was too late. Sherlock never initiated contact with him, nor did he answer any text not specifically about Rosie. John tried to tell himself it was normal, and that it was what he had wanted when he moved out, to be free of Sherlock.
They gave the movie a try, though neither man was interested. Sherlock gave up, lowered the volume and turned to face John.
“The restaurant on James Street will still be open  “
“Extensively, from what I understand.” Sherlock answered, drink in hand.
“Extraordinary! Simply extraordinary!” John piped up; he had been thinking it quietly ever since he had been able to make sense of Sherlock’s words.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Like you said yourself, you are basically married already. You have adopted Rosie. Now it’s a matter of you having the same name, and being able to include John in the Holmes family, and having shared healthcare, and filing taxes together, and all those things married couples have. That’s all it is! Look at me, Sherlock. A year ago, I was alone with my cats. Bill blasted through my walls like an explosion, and turned my life arse over tits. And I love it. I wouldn’t change this for anything! You know John, you have seen how much work he has put in to fix his mistakes. He loves you Sherlock and he is determined. Has he failed you these last months? Will you let him down?” Molly asked and looked at him with affection.
“You certain, Sherlock?”
The next morning, he woke up late, alone in bed and the sounds of giggling outside. Sherlock and the girls were playing catch. John took a shower, dressed and started sharing pictures on his blog, and social media. Rosalie came running in to hug him and tell him “Grandmere said come to brunch as soon as you’re ready. And she has “mimosas” for you, fruity drinks for breakfast.
“I will do everything I can for you John. Tell me when I’m doing something wrong.” He was quiet for a moment, looking a little dazed. Then he blurted out, “Don’t leave me again. Not even one more time. Alright?” Sherlock lost the battle for hiding his utmost fear, this one, most devastating thing, that had already happened. That John may back out and walk away, again. He quite hated the moment the words slipped out.
“What for? The evidence was all there,” he answered
John kept his mouth closed, but thought ‘No! I won’t be alright at all’
“No! NO! I want Sherlock! I don’t belong to you today! I want Sherlock! I want Sherlock! You can’t take me away! Sherlock!!” Her voice getting louder and louder; panicky.
“Well, my planner said bills, laundry, now boxing, then shower. A day of following some leads for a case Harris is having difficulties with. I have to say, John, Donovan is so much smarter! The amount of help Harris requires from me quite frankly makes me fear for the people that depend on him solving cases! Anyway, after that, I have therapy in the afternoon, and in the evening possibly some dull thing, such as “So You Think You Can Dance.“ with Mrs. Hudson at hers.”
That decidedly made John as giddy as a teenager. So what if Sherlock and Charlie were talking. Good for Sherlock to make new friends. Sherlock had thought of him. Maybe even missed him. That seemed like some progress to John.
As if on cue, the man seemed to know when John had been thinking about him. They had been out to meet the “Team” of Huskies they would be working with and his first thought upon seeing the happy, energetic dogs had been; ‘oh, Sherlock would love this!’ He had seen the face the detective would make, his eyes shining with delight, the real smile that John loved, the multitude of chins, surrounded by the beautiful creatures. John’s mind had gone as far as to thinking he would find out about booking them a stay when he remembered with a start that they were broken up.
Then Sherlock stopped talking. John wrapped his foot up in bandages and helped him to the living room. Rosie and Molly came in then. Both overjoyed to see Sherlock there. Molly went to the kitchen to “help” John.
Greg laughed, “Come have a pint with me and I’ll consider it you bastard!”
The next day, after breakfast, the guests took their leaves, as the Holmes, Harry, Meg, and the Holmes-Lestrade prepared for their trip. Harry and Meg were clearly happy for them, and Mr and Mrs Holmes assured them Rosie would be fine.
“We promised to talk things out, and be truthful to each other. So, no. I am not alright John. I’m done. This is it for me. It is not what I would want for myself or for my daughter. Enough.”
“I- I see you are together again. I have to ask,” the young man took a deep breath. “I recently - spent some time with somebody from my past. The person I have loved the most. He was my best friend since I was ten, we were lovers for a year. Seeing him again- It was fantastic, and he wanted me to stay, but I have my work and my life in a different country than his. I went through hell to get to where I am now. I’m so confused. He was married to a woman. He’s divorced now and swears that he never stopped loving me. He hurt me so badly though. I don’t know, how do you trust a person after that?”
John felt his blood run cold. Sherlock had never said “goodbye” to him. In all the time they had been together, not even when he left with his luggage and his daughter. This was the first time. It felt ominous.
“Yes… Captain.” low, quiet response.
“Oh! That’s nice!  Do you have a mum, Rosie?”
Sherlock had spent the week working himself to the bone. Until he couldn’t see straight anymore, until he collapsed from exhaustion. The only way to sleep. Even so, he was plagued with nightmares, where John was replaced by Moriarty, who had hidden Watson and teased him with clues he didn’t understand. When he didn’t go to the Yard all Monday and Tuesday, Donovan herself came over to the flat. Her suspicious look was overturned with softness.
John had been looking at him in concern. His eyes had been soft, caring? He had felt his torso with a doctor’s detachment, but his voice had been shaky. He was concerned for his ex-partner. Sherlock had been alarmed to see John’s eyes were moist and scared. Associations with the fall? After all this time? Even after he explained, John was still upset. Then, unexpectedly, he had pulled him down and kissed him. Sherlock’s heart had already been racing with the adrenaline of the chase and the capture. The kiss stopped any foreign thought processes. He stepped back, trying to breathe, to make some sense of this unprecedented behavior. John had never kissed him in public. Not even when they had been in the hot, early days of their relationship. Just as he took in a much needed gulp of air, John did it again, holding on tight to him, pushing his body against the detective’s.
Sherlock took up working cases again, John by his side. Without a fairy tale villain, the average case was less intense than those of their earlier years. Also, this time around Sherlock made an effort to come back home, to stay in touch, to sleep with John.
John was working. He had made up his mind to communicate with Sherlock only in relation to Rosie. He had avoided Greg, pleading work, not wanting to talk to him. Beverly was also in the blacklist at the moment, the last session ending in her telling John he had to communicate with people he still wanted in his life. John wasn’t sure he wanted any of his current acquaintances in his life anymore.
At that, Sherlock heard a bang from the laundry room.
“Yes, but after the trip to Cardiff, there were two entire months when I didn’t see you at all. You wouldn’t answer my texts, wouldn’t take my calls. That time was the worst since the time you were - away. I tried to move on, to date, to exercise. Anything to ‘get over’ you, but nothing helped. I was so happy when I finally saw you, but by then you were with Luther.”
“I don’t know what you mean. We fought like all couples fight. Never in front of Rosie.”
, Also a heartfelt thank you to all you lovely people who have given this Monster of mine such a warm and enthusiastic welcome! Thank you for the long comments, the short comments, the kudos and the views. From the writer's side, I can know confirm that all your feedback is life! I hope you can continue to enjoy.
Beverly was delighted to hear this: “This is such a positive development John! I’m very pleased you have realized there is more to the separation than just Sherlock’s working habits and unpredictability.  If you would like, we can figure out what contributed to the problems, and start to look for healthier ways to cope….” They started charting out the issues they would work out; Communication, anger management, letting go of the abusiveness of his past relationships… and his childhood.
“Two more hours? Since when does it take so long to go to Grandpa's?”
So Sherlock nodded, and they went. Some of the locals said hello to John, but didn’t stay to talk. They talked the case over, happy to have finally solved it. Sherlock predicting how Stewart would proceed to arrest the suspects. John talked about the veteran they had helped, how he was doing better, and had accepted to go into rehab. They continued talking once they left the pub, walking close together.
********
“John, kiss me.” They shared a passionate kiss.
"Well I for one, think it is good you can’t leave my side. You think I’m scared of confronting Moriarty? I’m not. I would be more scared of letting him hurt people, as he would to get to you. Sherlock, I am an army Captain, I have special ops training and I’m a crack shot. You have the genius, the strategy, the connections. Together, we can pull this off. Don’t leave me to save my life, Sherlock. My life is yours. My place is at your side."
They said goodbye to Dr. Sternbach, who had late afternoon and evening meetings, and changed for a stroll on the beach. John made sure to hold Sherlock’s hand as they strolled along. “You know…,” he said, as Sherlock looked at the ocean, “I came to the beach one school holiday, for a week or so with some blokes from Uni. We would set up tents in the beach, eat from cans and sing around the campfires, as we drank beer. I have some good memories of it. Did you ever do something like that?”
Sherlock had known John was on a date. They were broken-up. As in definitively. Of course, he knew this, It didn’t matter anymore. It wasn’t the reason for the heaviness he felt on his chest. That was the weather. Old scars and such.  So Sherlock decided to go to the club. His mind was circling the solution to the case. Before, talking it over with someone would have helped Sherlock would have found some sort of detail that was missing, but with no one to talk to, he decided to clear his mind. He went by Baker Street first to shower and change.
The music, as always, available at
It had been hard enough for him to cover how affected he was by seeing John again: he had to remind himself John wasn’t here because of him. He had to bring forth everything he and Dr.Quentin had talked about, that John had been responsible for the breakup also. He had to try to stop himself from staring, or from having physical proximity or contact with the ex-blogger, since that would only encourage him to remember the last time they had... The addition of Luther’s presence, the Birthday boy’s Grandfather!, was just unfair. Sherlock’s brain was reeling, as if stuck on buffering mode.
“No love, I want more, it gets harder to use words.”
“Don’t call me Greg, don’t you ever call me Greg. I’m Detective Inspector Lestrade to the likes of you.’ Yeah,  I remember. You ran off. I felt like an arse for saying it like that mate. Especially since you disappeared after. I even hoped you’d been high and forgot it. You came back after rehab sober, changed, distant. But Sherlock, I...couldn’t. From the moment we met, I felt protective of you. I saw you as a youth that had no one to take care of him. I couldn’t have done any of that with you.”
“So what makes you think he
“That would bring a whole new game to the table. Allen had dismissed diabetes in the other victims, though….”
“So, how was our girl?” Asked Mrs. Hudson, startling Sherlock out of the Mind Palace. He now noticed it smelled like chicken and bacon sandwiches. She was setting tea for two on the table in front of the olive green sofa. There was a fire on and the telly turned on a tattoo competition. Soon they were deep in conversation. It extended to a great variety of topics, except one. One smallish army doctor, who had a new address and a new love interest. When Sherlock went to sleep, on the new library daybed, (never in their bedroom, his bedroom again, now) Sherlock almost didn’t remember John’s brown trousers, with the blue plaid jacket with the gold stripe, and the cream colored shirt, the brown leather good quality shoes, new. He didn’t remember the smell of his cologne, nor his soft, dreamy, look, when talking with the art teacher. He didn’t remember the way he said goodbye, looking somewhere else, never having met Sherlock’s eyes at all. Bad memory was a definite advantage.
“And leave all that behind? He would be bonkers, mate!” yelled Harry.
“Hey there. I hear you need to hydrate, and also to eat something…” He held up a nutritional drink, chocolate flavored, pointed to a case of it on the floor. “...I want to run an IV on you, mate. If it weren’t for your hate of hospitals, I would recommend a nice 72 hour visit, but we’ll make do. Do you need something for the cravings?”
“That’s what people do, Sherlock. Never worry.” John said, with a small smile.
Sherlock gave Rosie her bath, and put her to bed, read her a story about “Little Red Ninja Hood” making the appropriate voices.
(See the end of the chapter for
“She loves you. She has seen nightmares, Sherlock. She won’t be scared. She will be angry if I let you go back to Baker Street to be alone.”
They danced and laughed together. The next song was a slightly modified version of Ed Sheeran’s Perfect, and everyone was invited back on the dance floor.
Sherlock ran down the stairs, barely looking at John, to pluck her out of his arms. He swung her around and threw her in the air, before hugging her tight, his nose on her neck tickling her; “Hello little Watson! Do you know how much I have missed you?” He asked as he playfully poked her belly. Rosie squeaked and laughed out loud. “I have surprises for you” he said as he took her upstairs and presented her with connecting building blocks, alphabet stencils, a busy book, and a plush dragonfly, to go with Little Bee.
***********
“What is it you want, John?”
“What? Do you want to fix that?” Sherlock smiled naughtily, seeing John on his knees.
What you did to us though. Beating Harry up for liking girls. She drank like you, you arse. She ruined her life. But you know what? She’s good now. Married to a woman. She works at an advertising firm. Manages a team. She’s been sober for seven years. She is happy even with all the shite you put her through.
********
“Yes??” John grinned
Sherlock looked at the man’s friendly expression. John would be in conference until after lunch. It was only 9:14 am. The man was not asking him for dinner. This was good, right? He would tell John about it. John would be happy Sherlock made a friend. “Scones!" he said to the man  “It’s your first time in England. Taste some decent scones.”
“John, I want my fiance, and partner to be my lover in our bed now.”
“That may be, Dr. Watson, however you can not tell me there isn’t some truth to that lie. The position has been offered to you and you have considered it enough to create a commute plan.”
“Going on two weeks, ever since we met, practically. We’re moving to Baker Street over the weekend.”
“This is us, putting back together the pieces that work, fitting in new ones that work better than before. You and I against the rest of the world, love.” Now John was having trouble getting the words out.
“Hi monkey. Yes, I love the flat, sweetheart. I love being home even more.” The girls squeaked and grabbed each other’s hands.
“What did he have to say?”
“I see. More interesting to make new friends and go off to breakfast with them, than go to meetings your partner is interested in.”
“How is the wedding coming along?”
Thank you to all my lovely readers. You have no idea how much you have helped me these last couple of weeks.  I was surprised and grateful for all the positive comments about my OC! I love him too!
“I just wanted to accept how he felt. At the time I felt guilty for having shared with my parents as quickly as I did. I was...overcome, I guess.”
Sherlock opened his eyes and put his hands on his legs, massaged that spot on John’s thigh that had used to hurt, long ago, John felt his body amp up, he felt his thighs rub on his man’s hips, their hands laced together, Sherlock’s eyes were all the colors of their wedding, as this man was everything. The sounds he was making, the words in French, “I’m so close love” Sherlock told him, and he was trembling.
“He informed me that everytime I had been with him, I called out your name. Always. From the beginning. It was never he that mattered John. He was just- company. Someone I could be with when I thought you didn’t want me anymore.”
“You really think I was smart? I’m so sorry I called you at work, when this case was only a two…”
“Well this time your beard looks smoother, better, it looks like it belongs on your face. She will love it.” Sherlock said, eyes looking away from him.
“That would never cut with Brother Dear. Luckily, I can tell you what will ‘suit’ him.”
did it later on?”
Mrs Hudson found him walking around. “Come, my boy, you look like you need some tea. Maybe a ginger nut or two.” Sherlock followed her then.
“So we’re not going,?” asked John.
Harry had listened open mouthed. “What?? What are you on about? You are The One for John. It was always you, Sherlock. That’s why I never bothered with Mary. Didn’t even go to the bloody wedding. John and I had such a fight about that. Not being his true self. Why would you doubt John loves you?”
by withoutawish. This was one of the first AO3 fics I read and it hooked me from the start. At Christmas time, John asks Sherlock to make a list. He does and John sets out to fulfill it. On John's list there is only one item. It's up to Sherlock to rise to the occasion. Lovely.
“I am in a right state, Hudson. May I sit on your floor?”
“He actually called Sherlock that?”
*********
*********
Sherlock thanked the girls and went back to Mrs. Burns. “This seems like it could have been someone from inside. It is improbable that a fellow student has done this and remained quiet this long. Also the patience and research necessary to go through our ancient history, archives and John’s old blog, indicates maturity beyond the primary school skill set. This shows the characteristics of an act of revenge. You can ask her teachers if they have witnessed any falling outs between Rosie and a classmate. Though I doubt the revenge is towards Rosie herself.” Mrs Burns went immediately.
If you haven't yet, go read all her universe! Especially the "Nothing Made Me" series, the above story is a part of.
“It distracts you.” He said, but he eyes were kind.
This chapter's inspiration was of course the extraordinarily, awe-inspiring
“How are the divorce proceedings going?” asked Sherlock.
In reality, there was little Mycroft Holmes would not do for Rosie Watson. They were fast friends. Rosie had long ago expressed to him an interest in learning how to be The English Government, so they would talk about countries near and far.
“Ah! There’s always something! It’s Molly who is from Edinburgh! Must have been the punches. Well, come on. Time to eat.”
“Don't go.”
“Yes Harris, please don’t repeat what I said, it’s downright tedious.” Sherlock repied.
Then he kissed him passionately, “This is how I should have greeted you when you came back from being away.”
Rosie didn’t like the fact that Sherlock was sick. That he didn’t really seem much better as the weeks went by, just even skinnier, worried her, but she did take some comfort in seeing Dr Stamford, and Pepsi, every Saturday at Mycroft’s. She took to going to her room and closing the door when she skyped him on her other days
Rosie’s heart leapt at the voice. She turned around “Sherlock!! You’re here!! You came!!” She threw herself happily into his embrace. One more day and she could go home with him.
“It’s not that I thought he didn’t want the responsibility. More like he would want to be sure it was the best for Rosie. He did ask me what would happen if I wanted to marry a woman. I had to assure him that will not be happening.” John said.
“A collaboration? What would that look like?”
“I admit your behavior did confuse me, especially since I saw the amount of emails from “Hearts for Africa” and believed they were all personal messages from him to you. I didn’t know about the breakup, or the depression. When we were alone and he asked me why I hadn’t made a move on you, I thought you had enough time to have informed him about our relationship, but hadn’t thought it important enough. That, added to the fact you were never particularly inclined to acknowledge our partnership outside the walls of our home, gave me the impression that you were not comfortable with me as your partner.” Sherlock didn’t look John in the eyes.
********
They sat in silence for a while as they sipped their tea. When it became clear Sherlock would not start the conversation, he took a deep breath and started with:
“Yes and getting back to that…,” Dr. Quentin said as Sherlock rolled his eyes, “...your thoughts about it. Why did it happen?”
So now he wasn’t sure if he should laugh, or despair that the one person that fit his brother like a glove, that one particular person, was the same that had an enemy in one Sebastian Moran. He remembered a quote, from an author he had read in his youth “I...see coincidence everywhere as an inevitable consequence of the laws of probability, according to which having no unusual coincidence is far more unusual than any coincidence could possibly be.” (Isaac Asimov- “The Planet That Wasn’t”)
********
“Why shouldn’t I go, Sherlock?” John’s voice was low, smooth like whisky. His name in John’s mouth made his tummy fill with butterflies.
“We won’t stop either. We won’t let him win. We will work with Mycroft, with your irregulars, gather the NSY, anyone who can help. What we will not do is let him separate us. We will not give him that power. It is the two of us against his web. Sherlock.” John then pulled Sherlock to him, and after a moment of going stiff, of being undecided, Sherlock gave in, and let himself be taken to the couch, where John hugged him and spoke reassurances to him.
They had a beautiful Christmas Eve celebration, with the flat hosting the Stamfords, the Watsons, the Holmes, the Woods, the future Wiggins and of course Mrs Hudson and the girls, who were happy at being invited and very grateful for all the presents they got.
“Well, do you have a… safe place to spend the night? A girlfriend’s flat, maybe?”
“John! No! I’m so…”
Sherlock had a question he wanted a sincere answer for, so he decided not to tease for today. Instead;
“Partner? What kind of partner have you been to me the last six months, John? You don’t even talk to me if it’s not about Watson!  Unless it’s to chastise me about my behaviours in front of people who are not important. When we are out in public the only sign you give of knowing me is the way you point out my errors. You can’t even look at me, much less touch me! We haven’t slept in the same room for months! That is what you call a partner? I thought you would have
“Harry?” he started.
One day, two days, three, falling asleep on his feet. His phone was dead. He spent time at the Yard, at Barts, he went to Lestrade’s. Wednesday evening had him considering how to negotiate the pick up on Thursday without talking to…
John realized he had been about to put his coat on and leave. Sherlock hadn’t really done anything wrong, had he. “Yes, go ahead.”
Sherlock didn’t text again, and the rest of the trip was pleasant enough, as Wells stayed away from John. Gianna texted, asking John when he would be back. They had gone on a date and it had been pleasant. They had exchanged various texts. He answered her and asked her out for a second date. She accepted.
Sherlock was somewhat frettish, but he was determined to prove to himself that he could be found attractive and be attracted to someone other than John. They talked easily for a while, about being a DJ, and an exotic dancer, and DJ, Luther, told Sherlock he was taking a break from his home in NY, where his youngest son and his ex wife lived. He was head of a security company, back in London to visit his daughter. The DJ gig was a favor for his club owner friend, a bit of fun.
“I wish I could tell you I was only protecting our privacy, but I have to admit, I was being an arse. It was never you, Sherlock. I never doubted my love for you, I’ve always wanted you. I’m the idiot. I preferred that my army mates didn’t know I was in a relationship with a man. Murray knew, as well as Darcy, but some of the other men were really idiots about same sex relationships. I don’t know why I held back. I needed to see you slipping away, another man leading you away from me, happily holding your hand in front of Queen and Country, to wake up.”
- You will bring the bicycles here? SH
Sherlock was unexpectedly enjoying himself at the party. It was in a park, and he didn’t really have to socialize. Watson was so happy he had come with her. She had dressed and commanded him to dress like her, burgundy slacks and a light blue denim shirt he was unaware he owned. Now they were manning the bubble station. Children were making and chasing bubbles and asking Sherlock to show them how to make big ones. Machines, bubble guns and old fashioned wands were provided and it was the most fun Watson and he had had in a long time.
“And she said, she would fill up our refrigerator.”
********
Sherlock looked at John, at a loss for an appropriate response. “I don’t know why you are showing me his picture.”
“Ha! Funny that, not run away. You abandoned a situation very recently....”
John looked at Sherlock’s face for a minute, not understanding. Then he looked down at his shoe. It was torn, ripped, destroyed. “The one they broke in Colombia?” Sherlock had shared few details of his time away. He had mentioned that his torturers in *Colombia had broken his foot. No further details had been asked for, or provided. Now, John thought this must have been one of the more traumatic experiences, given the near panicky tone of Sherlock’s voice. Sherlock nodded his head in answer, apparently unable to talk. Not good.
Greg stayed in uncomfortable silence for a while. “Well John, we’re all blokes here, you guys are done, so uhm, what he does in his, uh, free time, well, it’s up to him, right? At least now he’s not staying in by himself, curled up on the sofa. Anyway, uh, happy that the little Rose and the Stamford girls get along. And you owe me like 4 months of pints. I’m your friend too, you know. I promise no to say a word about Himself. Let me know.” and he promptly finished the call.
******
“Not really…,” said John, somewhat deflated, “... I… I wanted to say, I’m thinking of you, I miss you and want to be with you, love.”
“Sherlock, could we please move forward with this? *Can we start over? One more time…” John asked, trying to convey his feelings in every possible way.
The following week, John came home with food and supplies and heard a low, familiar voice in the flat, “I told her we had been to that bar in the Eiffel tower. Wasn’t that nice, Bay… Sherlock?”
“Rosamund!!”
Farris, believed the medicines ICLA were using for their target diseases, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus and autoimmune eye diseases, could also help with conditions such as psoriasis, pernicious anemia and celiac disease, if she adjusted the subjects’ immune systems. Lauren had continued her own personal research after being officially denied, and she had ultimately been let go of the research team and from the UCL for failure to obey authority.
The case there is absolutely fantastic! as is the whole series!
“Just playing love.” As he continued the task in hand, he turned Sherlock on his stomach, grabbing that arse with greedy hands, his tongue circling his guy’s rim, and going in. More of those delicious moans. John found himself incredibly turned on. He could do this all day. Sherlock whimpered. “John, John, stop!”
Sherlock was quietly amused. How could he have missed how much alike the two men were? As John remembered his manners and talked about his conference, Sherlock observed them. Same size, give or take an inch, similar build, similar expressions around the eyes. They were even wearing similar clothes. While John had a light green shirt and khaki shorts, Wilson had a brighter green polo, and khakis. Now they were companionably talking about the hospitals they worked in and how it ate up time with their kids.
They arrived and Mrs Hudson immediately went into the kitchen to help. The Stamfords were there with the girls, to Rosie’s delight. Some friends from Barts, two men, surely Bill’s friends and a couple who were smiling widely at Sherlock. At first he scowled at them, but after a good look, he recognized them from his homeless network, a long time ago.
anything and everything she writes, from
Alcohol? Drugs? Both? God how could he be so lost? Bloody phone ran out of battery, couldn’t even call a cab. He thought he had followed Mike’s directions, but then again he had been distracted, wondering just how much more could he possibly stretch the small amount of money he had left, before having to go beg Harry to take him in. Would she even accept him? He just had to get this job! Now he had ended up alone, in what looked like the worst place in the whole of London. He had been around this corner twice already. Shit.
It had been about six weeks, when coming back to Baker Street, daybag in hand, he found Lestrade waiting.
*******
John put his forehead to Sherlock’s chest. He grabbed on to the flaps of his jacket. Deep breath in, he asked  without looking up, “Please Sherlock, will you take me back? Will you - Will you take me home?”
“Just default, John.” Sherlock said, looking out the window. John said no more, but wondered about the tons of texts Sherlock received daily.
“I can “deduce” who you have been talking to.” John smiled, pointing at the Ginger Beer.
When they woke up, the flat was dark. Sherlock had just woken up and was looking at John, worriedly. “Hey there,” the doctor said.
“I ensure his safety. I. Am. His. Doctor and his colleague. He would not have called me otherwise.” John had his angry smile on. Sherlock had had enough.
Sherlock raised John’s face with his hand. “John. It was only a one story building. I’m fine. The suspect, though, he may have some fractured ribs. I fell on him.” he said.
“I know her too! Rosie doesn’t need all that knowledge. She needs a social life, friends, interactions with people. She needs to go out to movies, play sports, hang out with her friends, have sleepovers, not just study science and facts that will only isolate her…” John raised his voice over Sherlock's.
“Sherlock! The list! Tell me you made a list!” Scared, frantic,
“Well, he’s Mr. The Game is On. What else can it be about? Not answering? It was unfortunate he found the texts, but we were broken up. We are. So even without the pictures, getting back together wouldn’t have been instantaneous. We still would have to talk. Him not answering made me go look for him…”
“They are being secretive about these murders. I suspect the victims were somehow paid for participating in some sort of trial, but I can’t get them to confirm it, much less tell me what the trials are for! They might talk to a doctor, but they would never accept getting in a cab with me and coming all the way to your office.”
so kindly gifted me, and I proudly display in Chapter 7. Today, I will share a present that
“As am I.” Said Molly. “Please know that I owe a debt of gratitude to each one of you present tonight. This home is a new chapter for us; new neighborhood, new house, new status. Sometime next year, we will make this official. You will be receiving invitations for a ceremony. Now, everyone please raise your glass and help me toast, for I was so lonely, and one came along and turned on the lights that were darkened. Cheers!!”
Beverly smiled. “What did Sherlock say?”
“You’ve given up on Lizbeth then?”
“He didn’t really seem all that over you, not with the way he kept looking at you or with the way he talked about you. He doesn’t look like he considers you a ‘last resort’ …”
It took a long time for sleep to find them, Sherlock having a small meltdown over all the spent emotions and sensations, John hugging him tight and rocking with him in bed until he fell asleep; John soon after. The next morning, John laughed as he discovered he had tangled like an octopus, his leg over Sherlock’s, his foot intertwined with his, his arm around the lanky one’s chest, his hand in his curls. Sherlock had starfished on the bed. His chuckles woke Sherlock up. “What?”
Since John wasn’t getting answers from Sherlock, he started calling and texting Mycroft, with an equal lack of results. When he had tried several days with no result from either, he finally took himself to the Diogenes Club. Demanding to see Mycroft. Who was angry. Furious, even. John, who had never been afraid, or too impressed with him, had to admit he looked like a force to be reckoned with. He didn’t give John much that he didn’t already know.  Yes, Sherlock was working for him. No he was not sick. He didn’t know when Sherlock would be back to Baker. When John said that if Sherlock was so busy working, he could take care of Rosie until Sherlock had more free time, Mycroft turned feral. He stood up, head bowed brows furrowed, hands at each end of his desk. When he spoke, it was in a low growl.
“Waiting for me? How did you know I was here?” he asked, to give himself a chance to breathe.
John smiled. The word sounded alien in his mouth. He caressed Sherlock’s back, his cheeks, his hard thighs.
The tube ride was hell. The changing of lines, the people, the noise, the smells. His mood, bad to begin with, was black now. He almost went up the steps, then measured how angry he felt against how stupid he could get, and decided to knock on Mrs. Hudson’s door.
John gave him a sly look. “Gonna report to the British Government?”
John had known what was about to happen from the time he saw Sherlock walk towards Luther. It had been little more than two months since the night he had seen Sherlock dance. Now, Luther held Sherlock’s hand with their fingers intertwined, here at his grandkid’s party, as if they had been together forever, and steadily walked towards the parking lot with him, talking and making Sherlock laugh out loud.
To his surprise, Sherlock answered:
John slept in Sherlock’s room every night, until it turned into their room, and Rosie had no problem getting used to the smaller room being only hers. She was also quick to change Sher-lac for Papá. Mrs. Hudson had surprised the brand new couple the morning after, with a breakfast of all their favorites, muffins, almond croissants, a bacon fry up, hugs, congratulations, pictures, and a request for them to soundproof their room.
*******
“Of course…” responded Sherlock. “She said danger, and here I am.”
Those hopes took a hit, when a couple of weeks later, John  tried, with no results, to find out if Sherlock could look after Rosie an extra night,  so he could take a night shift for a colleague who was going out of town. Even when using “Rosie”, Sherlock was not answering his texts. After several tries and with no patience left, he decided to call Greg. “Oi! Do you know if Sherlock is on a case? I’m texting him and getting no response. I wanted to see if he wanted to look after Rosie tonight, before I asked Mike. I have a shift to do.”
*****
At that, DI Harris let out a breath, closed his eyes, and shook his head.
“No! I have never met Dr Sawyer. It was Molly who told me the two of you were going out.” he confessed. John noticed he was turning a little pink.
“What drives you to choose this career doctor? There must be easier choices within the psychology realm?” Asked Sherlock.
“Absolutely not.”
Sherlock hugged him, “You don’t have to keep that, John. I’ve only been truly home with you. You make me happy. And I have noticed all the ways you have changed. I hope you can accept how I have, too.”
*******
*****
“Oh well, sod that! He’s Mr. Oh So Busy and I have to get on with my life! Enough.”
“Well, Sherlock, now you are responsible for modeling self worth and positive loving relationships for your daughter. Measure your actions towards one another. Is what’s happening between the two of you something you would want for Rosalie were she in your situation? Does he treat you as you will want Rosalie’s significant other to treat her? The way you are interacting and reacting will be her guide about relationships. You can again use your little girl until being treated loving and respectfully is what you expect for yourself.”
He kissed him again, more than a soft gentle kiss this time, hungrier, letting the tip of his tongue part Sherlock’s lips and find that curious, eloquent tongue of his, feeling Sherlock gasp at the novel sensation, his breath quickening. John sucked at it, then at that lower lip, worrying it with his teeth. Oh, he would have kissed that neck and done much more to it, but he was hurt, and to be treated with patience and kindness.
Which made Sherlock look through his application and find her name: Rosalie Amelia Watson-Holmes. He also noticed that this wasn’t a proper application, but an adoption certification, granted upon his signature. With Rosie jumping up and down about her new name, Sherlock, having lost the ability to talk, got up and for the first time in his whole adult life, in possession of his senses, with no meltdown or overdose, of his own free will, stepped forward to hug Mycroft, who after a minute of stunned surprise, heartily hugged back.
Sherlock had been (free falling) working hard to keep himself together since that night. He heard John’s steps, heard his voice. Sherlock’s bloody leg started to shake. He pretended to analyse the body’s wounds, while he put his barriers up. One more acquaintance, nothing more. He turned around.
The night went so well, with Mrs Hudson and the girls making the side dishes. Mummy and Daddy brought a Christmas cake, and British trifle, Sherlock and John the main dishes, John the roast beef and Sherlock the turkey. Harry and Meghan were in charge of the (non-alcoholic) drinks. The Woods brought stockings stuffed with sweeties, Molly and Bill brought in salads, and the Stamfords brought home made biscuits. Everybody ate, and drank, joined into conversation.
Sherlock wanted out. He obviously had not made enough progress, if almost three months of intense therapy could be wiped out just with being close to John at a child’s birthday party. He had made an effort to keep his distance in the hopes of controlling his  feelings, but not even Luther’s presence could change the effect just chatting and laughing with John had on him. It was as if his body had a bloody magnet, pulling him towards the man. He could not keep his body still, his hands wanted to beat against his legs, his fingers wanted to flip, he wanted to sit down and rock. Instead, he walked blindly to the face painting stand, Rosie no longer on the queue, but close by, playing tug of war. Jackson was getting his face transformed into a pirate’s, wearing his costume present from Rosie.
“Oh yes. I want you to go so deep you erase my hard drive, Luther. Do you think you can?’
John decided to send a text. “Hey! Saw the videos! Looks like the experiment was a success! And like everyone had fun! I kind of wished I’d been there too.” Not that he would have gone. It was Sherlock’s night and he never got invited to the “New 221B” as he thought of it, but he had worked late last night.
A week of trying to match Moran with countless established drug lords, mafia bosses and serial killers had not had any results. Neither could they find the man himself; nor the Yard, nor Sherlock’s group of associates of dubious characters, his underground network. Sherlock was angry and restless and did not settle easily. John gave up trying to feed him and turned in for the night, taking a long shower before he went up to his mostly unused bedroom, intending to conduct an experiment of sorts.
*********
John looked at himself in the mirror. He should stay in and sleep. Staying asleep had not been easy lately. He kept thinking about things, such as Sherlock at his wedding. “The two people who love you most in the world…” Or Sherlock, quietly naming Mary as his shooter. His poor face when John had hit him at hospital. Sherlock’s expression when he heard John say “as always” to Sholto’s question “You two still ‘best friends’? 5 years into their relationship.
“Sweetheart, I don’t want you hurt. That takes preparation, and we haven’t…"
“Yes these last times we’ve been together have been pleasant. I suppose we could try to be friendly.” Sherlock said.
“Felt. Past tense. If it was, then why would he want a woman? Wouldn’t he want sex with a man, if he liked the man he was with for nearly 7 years?”
“Well, he did use to call me ‘love’. He did say, sometime close to the beginning. He would usually say ‘You know how I feel’.”
“Why would a villain gift me old shoes? What does this have to do with his ‘game’?”
“He won’t stop John! You saw that room! He has been obsessed for years!”
“Yes, but it’s just a suggestion… we can take some time to…”
Lizbeth gasped, put her hands to her face and half sat, half fell into the armchair behind her. “Oh God! Charlie knows? Sherlock, why are you doing this? Aren’t you back with John? Charlie told me there was nothing between the two of you!”
John didn’t understand what she meant, until Rosie gave him an evil consulting detective smirk, and took the beanie off. Her hair! Her curls! Gone. The hair that John brushed, and had lovingly learned to style and braid was now shorn off very, very short. His eyes opened wide and he gasped. Meghan paled;
“John! I’m ready, get on with it!” Sherlock sounded nervous and aroused.
It was time for John to look for things that he liked doing. In his case, cycling, cross training  and drawing, Rosie was his main muse, but Sherlock was there too, of course he was. He started making little comic strips with Rosie. The first one had been Rosie running her honey experiment, standing on a kitchen step to reach the counter and the tip of her tongue out the side of her mouth, spooning honey into different bowls with water… The next one was of Rosie taking off her beanie to reveal her extra short hair… This was fun
“That was fantastic, Sherlock.” He kissed him, and smoothed his hair.
“We can always schedule the next visit during the one in progress.”
John put Sherlock’s hand to his lips and kissed it. Then he ran towards the ocean, pulling him along. “Last one in is a rotten egg!!” said John and ran faster.
Yes, just as John suspected from the beginning, the “specialist” had his magnifying glass out and was now looking over some of the plants on the walkway farthest to the main road.
“You said his name over and over. You said ‘John’. You called out for ‘John’. You do sometimes, baby. This is why we could ever only be ‘friends with benefits’. It’s been clear since the first night.”
“He is a specialist in adults with ASD, John. He has given me invaluable resources to aid me through the tedious processes of daily life.”
“You see that as manipulating? Maybe there are some other issues at play for him? You told me he is on the spectrum?”
Another dream that plagued him was of seeing Sherlock sitting in his chair, at Baker, a pool of blood at his feet, down his sleeves, streaming down his face. Lestrade, dressed as a doctor, trying to find the wounds, plasters in hand, telling John he wasn’t needed, that he could go. Sherlock greyfaced, his head tilted uncomfortably to the side,  the pupils of his beautiful eyes vastly unequally dilated, unresponsive to Johns calls, then screams, then cries.
). The media room;
“Does she have any idea what she wants to study?”
all my love and gratitude. Without you I would have shattered by now!
The big man gave Sherlock a wistful smile. “You enjoyed those activities?”
-Where are you, you git? You are supposed to not leave me behind!
John looked at him in concern, and told the paramedic, “If he’s in too much pain, or loses the ability to move his toes, I’ll take him to the A&E. I’m a doctor. His doctor. I can stitch him up and prescribe the medicine he needs. I also have a cane and crutches he can use.” Harris came around, apparently, not having seen John and Sherlock… busy. John briefed him about gaining custody of the suspect. Harris asked Sherlock some questions, but got no responses.
“While I’m pleased to hear that I look well put together, I assure you Charlene, I have not had an easy time…”

*For this chapter I'm happy to recommend one of my favorite stories (yes I say that about all the ones I recommend, because it's true!) This one is a series,
Eventually Sherlock talked in broken phrases. “Last week, we fought. I said...bad things. They’re at Harry’s. It’s my days.  We had sex that night.” Sherlock stammered.
I want to also thank all of you who have read, and kudoed and commented on this little gift. It was so fun to write, and fun to share, so it's great to see readers enjoying it too!
On the third day,  Sherlock got a voice message  from an unknown number; a quiet whisper, “Sherlock...999R, please come! love you!”. He had been at Barts. One of the survivors was battling an overdose, of something that contained heroin and an element that seemed a pest poison. The other man did not have heroin or any other hard drug, there was evidence of corticosteroids, along with other substances he was working to identify. He had confirmed with Allan the mark he had found on the sole of his foot, was an injection site.   Upon receiving Rosie’s emergency call, Sherlock dropped everything and headed straight to the school. The assistant in the office told him they had called John trying to reach him several times to no avail. Sherlock’s own phone showed a couple lost calls he had received while on the way, when he had been busy giving Donovan directions to the school.
“Not applicable. I am totally indifferent to whom John decides to have sex with. I just wanted to know your opinion.”
Once inside, with no desire to stop by Mrs. Hudson to retrieve Watson, he went over what John had done. He had participated in the case. He had agreed to go to dinner. John had accepted Wiggin’s presence. Then he had suggested the local, because he “wasn’t ready to say goodnight”. John had talked as if he had been on a date, and he had ended it with a goodnight kiss. A good long kiss, that only served to remind Sherlock of all the other things he couldn’t indulge in.
“John? Me too… all that. Just...working now.”
Once outside, he placed Sherlock next to him in the car and started off. “The conference?”
John submerged himself in work. He did some sleuthing during his volunteer hours with the veterans, determined to proving himself useful in cases once more. He was able to interview and document that some veterans that had people approach them about “experiments” which sounded like medical trials. They had been offered pay. Some of them simply had not been approached again, but one had talked to a “girlie” about the experiment and decided against taking the trial. John had written down the man’s name and rank. He had taken pictures of where John had found him. He was going to send the info with Sherlock as soon as he could get a break. The clinic was in the middle of a dramatic allergy and asthma season.
At the pub, they talked about Donovan, and how good she actually turned out to be. Greg was quite proud of her. He had a different impression on Harris, thinking the younger D.I. was smarter than what Sherlock gave him credit for. “I’ve had a chance to observe him, while I hung out with Donovan a while ago. Kept an eye on him, since you told me about how you two got on. I have to say he seemed like a right bloke to me. He has great instincts, and knows procedures by heart. He does have quite a crush on you, though. Donovan knows it too. That’s probably why the poor bugger can’t find his feet when you’re around.”
John was walking around again and remembering; (
“Come here, love.” He loved Sherlock’s face when he called him that.
“Mrs Hudson reports she is tired of being pampered and that they have no proper tea at the resort, only ‘that vile green stuff’. She will be coming home when you are, Rosalie.” said Sherlock, as he knew Watson liked to hear her new name.
John went to work, met his fellow doctors and the registrar, Sarah Sawyer, who was precisely his type of lady. Pretty, with a dry sort of humor, smart as a whip. She checked him out appreciatively, flirted openly, touching his shoulder, taking his arm to walk him through the facilities and calling him to have lunch with, supposedly to talk shop, but conversing about everything else as well. John was happy to interact, but was surprised about how reserved he was being. His first thought was of Sherlock. How wonderful he was. How much smarter, how much more interesting and beautiful than anyone else. God, what was his life?
The day was a sunny, happy day. The closest of friends and family spent the day with the grooms at the Holmes’s. Harry and Meghan had prepared a karaoke game, in which Sherlock refused to participate, but John did pretty well, although the winner was Mack, with a surprisingly emotional rendition of “Hallelujah”. The grooms had hired ponies and horses for riding. They had a light lunch and then it was time to start getting ready for the wedding.
It was much past midnight, Rosie had been falling asleep in Sherlock’s lap in the cab. Once at the flat, she went to her room to change into her pajamas. Sherlock circled the living room with the last of his nervous energy. “John. I’m aware we must have a conversation. Could it please be tomorrow? I, I want to…” He looked towards the room.
I can’t forget the time we were broken up John. I did not think I could have survived it, but I did. I was forced to lean on other people, Luther included, obviously. I learned to walk on my own two feet. I finally went to therapy and learned valuable lessons for myself. I will not delete what we went through, because I learned from it. I can survive on my own and my life is worth living. I hope you will continue to live it with me, but do not dwell on what happened during the time we were apart. I know I will greatly appreciate never knowing what you got up to with Gianna or any of the other people you kept company with. Dearest.”
So Sherlock ended up going to Mrs. Hudson, to ask her for advice on how to behave, and what to talk about. Mrs. Hudson, of course, was delighted. “It will be so good for the girls!” Sherlock deeply regretted his offer, but he did feel bad about taking a night with Nyla away from her mom.
“Informed? Sarah said we were going out?”
However, things had changed a bit. Sherlock had softened somewhat. John had to be careful now. That look in Sherlock’s eyes as they met his, had done something to him, that he had told himself would not happen again. He had felt a tiny crack in his armour. Sherlock’s  bloody eyes.
When John came out of the shower, drying his hair, he called out “Did you put on the kettle, start the toast?”’no answer “did you go back to sleep, genius of mine?” John went to the bedroom, saw it empty and the phone on the pillow. His first thought was that Sherlock had gotten a call from the Yard and ran back to his precious “work”. He had been stupid to think the sex had actually meant something to the detective.
“You are not really helping, here, Molls?” said John, who didn’t need any reminders of that last horrible year and a half. Right now, he could only remember the good times, the times Sherlock had smiled proudly at his ideas, the times he had helped on cases, and the aftermath of solving them. John didn't want to stop thinking about how Sherlock was in bed, loving, passionate, undone. Then curled up, little spoon, or wrapped around him, like an octopus. ‘Move on’?. Here, in Molly’s cat hair covered apartment, with the knowledge that Sherlock was off doing he knew exactly what with a chocolate skinned Adonis, wrecking John’s heart and head, he knew he was going to fight to get Sherlock back. Back in his life, back in his home, back in his bed. Anywhere. Everywhere. But back in his life. Back with him and Rosie.
The goosebumps that raised on his skin surprised Sherlock. John had asked two questions, and his body reacted immediately. He compared his body’s visceral response to Rosie’s dancing and yelling pleasure at getting a bicycle for Christmas when she had been five. Sherlock took John’s face in his hands, had him look up. He knew the affection he felt would be plain in his eyes. “You went away once and had a wife, a house, a family. Then you came back to me. You left me again, saying you couldn’t handle me anymore, that we were done for good, but now you’re coming back to me once more. I let you go. I let you be free. I’ve let you look for the life that would make you happy. You are choosing to come back home because you are mine. Mine.”
“Who is then?” Pretty nurse asked.
“I’m terribly confused, Dr. Quentin. I confess, that when we started our sessions, I would have jumped into fire to get back with John, no questions asked. I’m very… careful now. At times, I still feel I’m better off without the risk of him leaving again. He did say he would respect my wishes, and go at my pace. He knows I’m very wary of intimacy with him.”
“She said you never asked her to keep a secret, and shut up, because you are listening to me now…,” he said in his Captain Watson voice.
John had nodded and shaken hands with the D.I. As to what exactly was going on between him and Sherlock; how could he explain it to him, if he didn’t know himself? Sherlock had quickly become one of the, who was he kidding,
“Yes, pretty much so.” John answered her question.
John and Sherlock have started their friendship in an epic way! Now, after the fight, and the chase and the sobering up, John has a job.  Mike is sorry he gave him the wrong directions. He takes John to meet Molly Hooper.  John joins Sherlock on a case and witnesses him working! The genius is upset, because John hasn't answered is calls. There has been some misunderstandings, but they can talk them out.
Another great story is
They sat on the bed, John’s hand going up and down his back, talking soothingly, but Sherlock was beyond trying to understand. John got off the bed, took his and Sherlock’s shoes off and took off his own shirt. Sherlock helped him with that, as John undressed him. Then they got in the bed together, in their room, at home, for the first time in almost a year. Sherlock had kept his pants on, while John was naked, he had kept the soft light of the lamp on, while Sherlock had closed the curtains and turned off every other light. The detective clung to his partner for what felt as a long time, overwhelmed, trembling. John got up on his arm and touched Sherlock’s cheekbones. “I’ve missed you so much, love. I’ve missed this.” Sherlock also touched John’s face. John continued, his hand gentle over Sherlock’s body, returning to his face, to touch his lips, to run his fingers through his hair. “John, would you be terribly disappointed, if… No, never mind.”
The teacher continued; “It wouldn’t be, if she weren’t so anxious and worried about not being able to resolve a conflict amongst her peers or about solving even the hardest math problem. She may be expressing some anxiety about her family situation? How is she behaving at home? I dare say she can’t be the perfect little girl everywhere.”
He turned right, remembering he had heard somewhere people tend to head in the direction of their dominant hand, and if he had, it hadn’t helped him at all. Not that the view was any better. He had apparently left Sex Worker’s’ Corner for Drug and Alcohol Street, where the men eyed him with hate and distrust. John tried to hold himself straight, but his shoulder wound was still painful, and the anxiety was making his leg even more uncooperative than usual. He knew that he looked even worse than he was feeling; an old man at 30, invalidated home, no family, no job, hospital issued cane, clothes from the second hand shop. The men fortunately lost interest in him, as he continued his straight line, hopefully out of there, towards… well, anywhere else, were there were lights, and buses, and people who didn’t want to sell him sex or drugs, or maybe see him dead.
These two lovely lifesavers are very talent story tellers, writers, video editors in their own
“Were all your guests there? Everyone present knew you guys are together again, right? Even the owner of the restaurant knew you as a couple.” Beverly stated.
“She looked at Donovan in the eye and told her she did it because of postpartum depression. John the woman never even had a child and Donovan knew as much. How she controlled herself and stopped herself from punching the woman I will never know.”
Then they went to the reception at the Savoy Place. Donovan came to stand next to Sherlock as Lestrade, looking very good in an excellent and well fitted blue suit, gave his speech and thanked the three of them, Donovan, Sherlock and John, for their friendship and help throughout the years and through his work as DI and later as Superintendent. Everybody cheered with champagne.
“No school today! We are going on a surprise trip!” John exclaimed.
The boy, no,  Sherlock, seemed rapt. He listened and looked and John had never felt so… seen before. Sherlock asked questions no one else had thought to, such as what kind of side effects had the medicines he received at trauma center had on him (the ongoing hand tremors) What did he think would help him with the PTSD? (Getting back into action? Not happening with his leg and his shoulder). Was he planning on moving closer to Barts now that he had a job? (John could barely afford his current bedsit).
Rudely interrupted by Molly and the smallest girl among the guests, Samantha. “Sherlock!! You look stunning! Wasn’t that entrance just wonderful! Well don’t leave us standing here, dance with us!” Sherlock danced with Molly, who put her tiny daughter in his arms, and it must have been the occasion, that made his eyes moisten again, looking at little Samantha, remembering when his Watson had been so tiny, and he had desperately wanted to care for her, but had been so sick, and ignorant, and lonely. There she was now, coming to look at the baby, telling Molly, Sammy smelled like the best thing in the world.
“Stop. No more, dearest.” said Sherlock. “That was then, look at what we have now! Let’s be happy, John. Please!”
“I thank you for saying that, Dr Q, but when I’m with him, when he’s talking to me with that softness in his eyes or he’s touching me, I do feel I need him, and go back to being willing to do anything for him. As it is, we have already had sexual encounters, even though when I think rationally I promise myself I won’t give in.”
“Sod it John! Piss off! Serious parenting? What about when she was a newborn and her mother ran away to Asia, while you were dedicated to drinking yourself stupid? Who did all the fucking serious parenting shite? Who walked her all bloody night when she was desperately missing her mother and retched non-stop  because of the formula? What about when you were drunk and irrational? Depressed and missing your murderous wife? Or later, so tired from work you couldn’t even think?
Sherlock turned his face to John’s and looked at him with his familiar intensity, “Luther and I are still friends, no break up. I do not need any more of those.”
Sherlock looked at him. “Thank you. I have to admit it’s thanks to Dr. Quentin.”
-We will each supervise half of the project write ups. We talked about getting together for some coffee and conversation when we don’t have the girls. Yes, I would have liked for you to share the evening with us. SH
“Are you going to call me that in front of people?”
“Umh, no there is one later than that.” Ms O'Keily said timidly.
*********
“Coffee please…”  Said Sherlock looking at the historic charts. “...black, two sugars. It would have been easier in those times. Just have me lobotomized.”
In a quest to annoy John, Sherlock and Watson subjected the Captain to the youngest’s entire playlist of Taylor Swift songs. Singing along loud and dramatically. John made all the appropriate protests; “Really?”, “Aw, come on, again?", “Stop it you two!” and “Sherlock, you git, stop this immediately!!” so they wouldn’t catch on to just how much he was enjoying Sherlock and Rosie screeching “So why can’t you seeee-ee-eeee,  you belong with mee-ee-eee, you belong with me.”
“And you? Grandpa? Did Jackson really call you Grandpa?” Sherlock stammered, not able to make sense of it.
There he was, looking incredibly at ease in a white guayabera and grey shorts and incredibly, loafers. He seemed to be actually eating, some kind of salad and a drink with an umbrella. He was laughing. Sherlock was laughing. The person who made Sherlock laugh was a brown haired, tanned man, a little older than John. He had the same drink and was currently talking with his partner, leaning over towards him to show him something.
“Quincy, you may call me Sherlock. I will  be retaining my given name in public, for business reasons. What may I do for you?”
Mike continued, “Dear friends; I would say we are here to celebrate the union of these two men in matrimony, but that wouldn’t capture the entire significance of this occasion. These two have had a complex, deep, loving relationship for many years now. And I take full credit for it.
John drank quite a lot and quite often after the Smith case closed, I believe mostly due to guilty feelings about the beating. Eventually, we were reunited, in great part due to Mrs. Hudson’s efforts. I suggested he come back home once it was better between us, and when he did, he tried to stop the drinking. He needed therapy for it. I too had to detox, and we went through it together, taking turns with Watson, who was just about two years old. We did have a lot of help, from Mrs. Hudson, my parents, Molly, the Stamfords. By the time Rosie turned three, we were back to work, sober and together.”
Sherlock accepted, waiting somewhat desperately for John to come to the rescue. “Sherlock, this is Alberto Contreras, my partner.”
He fell next to Sherlock in the bed and Sherlock immediately turned around to hold him tight, sharing the spent fluids between them. “You ok?” he asked him, Sherlock nodded yes, but said nothing, hiding his face in John’s neck. John thread his fingers through Sherlock’s curls and pretended he didn’t feel the wetness pooling on his shoulder, nor did he comment about Sherlock’s irregular breathing. When he had calmed, John got up. Sherlock sat up in the bed, looking as if he were getting up. “What are you doing? Wait. give me a minute.” John went to the bathroom, washed up and brought Sherlock a flannel, proceeding to clean him up. When he was done cleaning them, Sherlock got up. Instead of heading towards the loo, he seemed to be going to the living room.
“I’m his fiance, Mr Holmes and very pleased to meet you. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for the advice you gave this hard headed kid. He only gave me a chance after he met you. Your wedding was the most beautiful I have seen.”
“Me? Use trainers to go to a stable? Nope. Why shoes?”
“Anxious when I saw him. Then we fell back into our familiar banter. About Rosie, the Yard, Barts. That was easy. I had to think to remain at a prudent distance. I kept sneaking closer to him. Then he talked about his trip to Cardiff, and I tensed up.”
**********
Greg’s three children were to participate in the ceremony; his two boys, standing at his side, Todd, the best man, Mack’s little boy carrying the rings. Tara, who had danced with Sherlock at Greg’s retirement party, would be the one giving him away, Mummy would do for Mycroft. Sherlock showed them around the estate, sharing stories about his working relationship with Lestrade and the antics he had witnessed at the Yard. Tara wanted to know about cases Lestrade had actually solved, and Sherlock was able to cite quite a few, plus some where they had collaborated closely, to pass the time. In all, by the time he brought them back to the main house, Greg and Mycroft were there and he happily passed the Lestrades on. Then, he went to take a look at the bees with Watson.
They went to Sherlock’s room. John finished opening up his buttons. Sherlock, with unsteady fingers opened John’s shirt and reverently traced the edges of the doctor’s scar first with his fingers, then with his lips and tongue, while John opened up his belt and trousers and pushed them down. Then he pushed Sherlock down onto the bed and took his own trousers off, giving Sherlock a tantalizing view of his red pants, the front showing him the outline of John’s Three Continents acclaimed cock.
“Lizbeth, it isn’t really Charlie who asked me. The only thing between us is friendship, the understanding that comes from living through similar situations, in this case, still feeling deeply for our exes. I’m conducting this investigation, to help her out.”
Kaia was a caring, considerate person, who, having grown up without a mother, took to Mrs Hudson immediately. She was small, thin, with long black hair and dark skin. Claire was outspoken, bad mouthed, and quick to be angry. She was taller and bigger than Kaia, her originally blonde hair often tinted blue or pink. She had grown up in the streets after her mom had started bringing home a different boyfriend every week. She also took to Mrs H immediately, and to Rosie also, though she would not easily let it be known. Claire wanted to be an EMS, Kaia wanted to be a social worker, as a case manager had saved her life, even if the lady had been taken off her case soon after, and Kaia had had to run away from home. At first the two young ladies barely tolerated each other, but over the weeks, John saw they created an alliance of a kind, and wondered if Sherlock had purposefully picked each girl. Especially since Mrs Hudson took to them like a duck took to water, and insisted on feeding them both and having them over for tea, constantly. Her stories of the “good old days” endeared her to Claire. She was soon calling them “my girls”.
John left, not bothering to go back and tell Sarah, but concentrating on finding a cab. What had happened? John had noticed from the start how hard it was for Sherlock to ask for help. They had been bickering this morning, but in jest, John had seen Sherlock’s half smile as he left. Now his voice had been filled with sorrow, not the posh arrogance he affected when ordering John around. ‘I might get - get lost.’ Lost, back to the streets, back to the drugs. Not happening! In the taxi, in his distress, he thought to text Sarah, citing a family emergency.
The front door of the flat opened and Mrs. Hudson came in. “Don’t” she warned, looking at his lifted fist. “He’s not going to let you in. You best be going home, John. Rosie is resting, she’ll be better in the morning.”
“Yes love of course.” So John coated his fingers and prepared him, as they kissed, and he used his other hand to stroke Sherlock’s arms, his legs, When Sherlock said, “I’m ready, John” he didn’t ask about positions, because his husband clearly wanted to look into his eyes,
Even though Mel Stamford always claimed to be, Rosie found out what “freaking out” meant on Thursday, at noon. Instead of her usual time she was woken up at the crack of dawn.
John apparently had tried to contact him various times during the following week. He looked at the texts, just in case they said something about Rosie, but they didn’t. He still went to pick her up from school. His little girl knew something had happened. She recognized Sherlock was sad, even though they played tickles and he still read to her making all the voices when he put her to bed.
“We are a pair of aquatic animals, you know?”
Rosie thought. “You were not in love with Luther, but you went out with him. Did you kiss?”
Sherlock liked the way Dr.Quentin explained things. Feelings would always be harder for him to understand than facts, but filtering them through what he would want for Rosie was doable.
“The bloody work is not everything, Sherlock!! You have responsibilities other than your fucking cases! You have a daughter who looks up to you, who asks incessantly about you while you don’t even bother calling, not to mention a partner…”
). The rooms upstairs; (
Sherlock tried, he did. This was his “ex”, the one who left. The one who “couldn’t take it (him) anymore”. He knew tomorrow he would go home alone. That is what “broken up” meant. John had been kind enough, not leaving him alone to deal with his excesses. Sherlock had basked in John’s keen attention during the party. He took in the experience of being in John’s home, alone with him. He participated and listened to the conversation. In the end, he was overwhelmed. There he was, the person that still meant more to him than anyone, so bloody handsome, looking at him with kindness and maybe something more. His hands, right there, his gorgeous eyes, made Sherlock cease to understand what John was saying now. He just knew John was close enough for Sherlock to take in his scent, and oh, did he smell like longing, and love, and home. It was all Sherlock could do to tuck his hands under his thighs, and try to breathe, to keep himself from pouncing on John. He wanted so much, so bad.
With that, the three men, Stewart, John and Sherlock ran down the alley and into the abandoned house. As they approached the room  their contact had specified they slowed down. It was hot and humid in it. John was grateful for his cotton vest under his shirt and for the fact that Sherlock had left Coat at 221B instead of risking death by overheating. Still, the heat was stifling, and the humidity on old piping tubes condensed into big ugly drops of water that often landed on Sherlock’s curls. John was distracted by this, and almost failed to recognise Stewart’s signal. He was surprised that instead of Sherlock running full speed after Stewart, he stayed back and talked to the man who had stayed behind, leaning against the wall
“I’ve been exercising in the mornings. I even go dancing some evenings.”
“Those are truly positive developments, Sherlock! I take it John has continued with his sessions with Beverly?”
In reality, Mary summoned us both in our drugged state to a warehouse. I recorded the meeting on my phone. She confessed to us she had been Moriarty’s second hand all along, and now that Magnussen was dead, she had reconnected with Moriarty’s ‘business associates’ from around the world, she had left to claim her new territory. Later, during one of many Culverton Smith ‘confessions’ he confessed he had called Moriarty, Mary, for help covering up the true effects and uses of TD-12, so he could continue its’ production. That was how she had access to it.

“Dinner? Or coffee? Really Sherlock, you can’t work day and night without food or a break.”
“Yes. I’ll go by Baker Street, no problem.”
“Thanks for the invitation, Rosie. Always nice to come to London to see you.” Harry said smiling.
“I doesn’t appear to be broken, or sprained, sir. Mashed up and torn, yes. You should go to hospital and get x-rays. That is going to need some stitching and anti inflammatories. A cane would help keep your weight off of it.”
“Sherlock, John, Dearest brothers; So as to get to the part where we dance, eat, drink and be merry, I have one word I want the two of you to hold on to: Stay. Stay in each other’s minds, hearts, and lives. Stay interested in how the other is feeling, in what he is passionate about. Stay in his thoughts, by his side, in his bed. Stay with one another. You both do best when you are together, and Rosalie and I have big plans for the future. Let’s raise our glasses and toast to love enduring! Cheers!”
So they came to be having tea and biscuits at an odd hour,  with an acquaintance of John’s, who was very familiar to Rosie.
Luther looked at him, as if deducing him again. “He went dancing at the disco, where I’ve been DJing, and man, can he dance.”
“Can’t breathe John…” barely audible “...m’throat hurts.”
“These are very impressive, John.” commented Dr Gates said as she looked through them. “I especially like this one, the looks between Sherlock and Rosie are very emotive, the background characters well drawn out.” Beverly’s expression was filled with admiration. “So what was the aftermath of your surprise? You were worried he would balk at the responsibility, or that he would be overwhelmed.”
Sherlock gasped and woke up. “John?”
Bill was still and quiet, waiting to see how he would respond. John  was livid; “Yeah, I was married, and damn miserable until I wasn’t. Sherlock didn’t try to turn me. I’m bisexual. And I didn’t just ‘run around’ with him. I slept with him. I lived with him. He was my partner for seven years. Which is longer than any bloody relationship you’ve ever had, excluding the one with your hand.” They finished up and had the practice rides on the sled. When they were done, John stood up. Captain Watson in place. “I give zero shits about what you think of me. You. Do. Not talk about Sherlock ever again, or refer to anyone as a ‘faggot’ in my presence.” With Bill at John’s right, the Wells bloke was out of options. “Got it” he said, looking at the ground.
“Look at how his other wedding turned out!” Sherlock said miserably, “all my work, the locale, the clothes, the cake, the people! It didn’t make him happy. It didn’t make their relationship last! John ended up miserable and hating his wife!”

“Of course not! I’m just saying, let’s cool our heads before we go overboard. It’s over, right? You did great. You kept your head, delegated tasks, gathered the info, and found them. Then got a confession out of the woman.”
“Hey! I didn’t say a thing!” Lestrade’s smile did not falter.
Hearing that from Mrs. Hudson, their eternal supporter and never housekeeper, was just too much. He felt panic rising. It was hard to catch his breath and he had to sit down, head hanging down towards the floor. At some point, Sherlock must have left the building. What felt like an eternity later, he felt her hand on his shoulder. She put a cup of tea down on the table and sat on the sofa next to him, handing him some tissues. He was surprised to see he needed them. His eyes seemed to be  leaking.
“Lizbeth, what Sherlock is, with such bad taste, trying to convey is how miserable you will be when she actually moves back, close to her family and her old friends, and starts moving on.”
“I met Luther at a birthday party last week. He and Sherlock seem to be getting along.”
“You hungry? We could make a coffee stop. I’ll brief you on the way.”
“Ok, good because Mycroft is beside himself with worry. He told me what you said to him. That you wanted to ‘overdose’. Not just to ‘use’, mind you, there is a big difference.”
Sherlock let himself in and was surprised. Not a stuffy desk in sight. And the window was covered in heavy drapes. There was a sofa, and two armchairs, each of different styles and materials. There were different charts, historical and modern, of the human mind on display. He had some (Insects) pinned up. Books, medical, chemistry, alchemy, many first editions, very valuable. Vintage diagrams of different flying machines and spacecrafts. The doctor, Ian Quentin, sat on the sofa, reading a manual on some kind of yoga. When he got up to shake Sherlock’s hand, Sherlock saw he was 5’10, thin, a good fifteen years older than himself and had solved the issue of hair loss by shaving it all off. The man was dressed similarly to Sherlock himself, finely tailored form fitting white shirt and dark grey trousers with real italian leather shoes. Dr. Quentin seemed very comfortable in his skin and very welcoming.
“Always Sherlock” John pulled him in for a kiss, surprisingly gentle. He tried to open Sherlock’s belt, the trousers. Sherlock’s hand stopped him.
Sherlock felt his brother’s strong hands help him inside and take his coat off. He sat Sherlock down on a sofa. Sherlock let Mycroft look up and down his arms. “There are no needle marks. Your shoes are tied, your belt in place.” said Mycroft and he looked pale and badly scared.
John felt hungry and not at all sleepy, so he carefully got up and went to make himself some tea. The fridge was full of leftovers. He picked some cake, lemon and honey. He took it to the sofa in front of the fireplace. As he ate, he thought of how gorgeous Sherlock was, and how in love they were. To think he had left! He had thought he needed freedom, he needed to date other people. What an idiot. The women he had been with were mostly lovely, and willing, and it had been exciting in the beginning, but he had missed Sherlock terribly. John smiled as he thought of how the few men he had flirted with while they were separated had never stood a chance. He never could hold a whole conversation with them, much less date another man. John knew now, he had needed that time. The separation, the sense of losing him to someone else, to be able to drop the shit, work on his issues and tear down what was not working. They had a new relationship. This was built on the foundation of their long standing love, and also on their iron will to build it up, to make it strong and durable.  John startled and realized he had been falling asleep. He went back to bed. Sherlock opened his eyes, and cuddled with him
That day Sherlock was back on the case of the poisoned homeless, which was proving to be harder than he originally thought, now that they had found a second body, apparently killed in the same manner.  While the method of delivery was the same as before, the victim was a different demographic, and the drug was different too. He was trying to isolate one elusive component when Molly came in to talk to Allen. When she finished with him, Sherlock approached her;
Sherlock ran out of Baker Street, got to Rosie’s school and confirmed his worst fear. She hadn’t been in. She was absent. John had taken her. He entered her classroom abruptly, asked for her, then stared at the startled looking teacher, and left without explaining. He called John. No answer. He called again. No answer. Texted. Nothing. He tried to think, to deduce what happened. Crime solving skills apparently offline.
deserve so many thanks and love from me, for being the best friends ever. Please check out their work right here on AO3.  As you read my story, remember, I tend to make last minute additions, so mistakes you see are Not my Betas' fault.
"Not one bit. But if you call me ‘little Molly’ one more time, I will tie you up, and not in a good way.”
“You are doing fine, lo...Sherlock.”
It was Lizbeth’s turn to get up and pace; “Because it’s unforgivable! I left my child, my disabled child and ran away to the U.S. I worked at the family business and made quite a lot of money, none that I gave to Andrew. I met Charlie and started falling for her, and couldn’t tell her. We had a baby!! Charlie trusted me enough to have my baby growing inside her, while all the time I’m a woman who abandoned the child that needed her! When we came back I went to see him and that was it. His father had just passed away, he was left in charge of the business and his stress levels were affecting his health, I’ve seen numerous doctors and therapists so they could work with him. Throughout it all, Andy has been nothing but loving and understanding. His dad was 20 years older than me, he died in a car accident. Andy says his dad never spoke badly of me, that he taught him to give me a chance. He even wants to meet Nyla, but I don’t know what to do! I only know I couldn't’ ask Charlie to accept it. I’m not the kind of person she deserves!!”
“Well, Donovan was being a pain, something about the Superintendent visiting and kicking out non-personnel people. The one you tripped for calling me an ‘ageing twink’ not the one whose nose you broke. I needed access to police records and registrars, so I came here.” he said.
“Well, yes...but you weren’t screaming
******
“Listen, I
-Sherlock! Answer me! I will call your brother and send Lestrade after you!
“No comparison. Meghan loves you. You have known from the start. You were never second best, or a last resort for her. It is different when you can’t help but thinking any intelligent, attractive woman he talks with could be the “One” and I’m left alone again.”
“Yes Rosie, I will go back to the flat and pack everything. I’ll arrange something with the landlord. You will not have to go back there. You can stay in your room at home.”
*********
“What for, love?” smiled John.
If you are interested I also have copies of the articles. PM me at jobooksncoffee on tumblr.
About a week later, Sherlock got a text from John, not about work, or about Rosie.
“John does not drink, except for some beer when he goes out with Lestrade. We argued, but he never fought physically!” Sherlock insisted.
On his way out of the office, the woman presented him with a bag containing two clean vests, and gave him the room number. He took them and hurried.
Whatever the cause, other than his red, moist eyes and some color around his nose, Sherlock was projecting his machine persona. John said as evenly as he could, “I don’t know what you mean, love. Please explain.”
“I heard you are looking for a guy named Moran. Word is he’s hiding back where the Germans were doing business last month. Want me to take you?”
-Did you finish the experiment? Or are you getting together again?
“No. John told me they barely talked and he had taken to sleeping in the nursery. She tried to retake our friendship to get closer to John, but she would put him down, and played it as if I wanted her to be my partner in cases. We never spoke about anything other than the cases at hand in front of her. She wouldn’t take a hint. She was always with us. I wasn’t having it. John and I would text at night, to keep up with each other.
The substitute Principal, Ms O’Keily,  Mrs Burns out due to a broken leg, tried to talk to him. “Mr. Holmes, that is not the most recent document we have on file. Your name is not on the latest form.”
At this, Sherlock took a step back, sort of folded into himself. His head moved side to side and he started reciting “John, no, no, no, I’m sor..”
“Did you guys fight fair?” She asked.
“Yes of course, Mr Holmes. Yours is not the only student we have with security concerns. The security guards went through the footage, and all the children that left early today were clearly seen, with their respective parents.”
John had noticed. He loved Sherlock’s little changes. His new self assurance. His speaking up. Knowing himself better. Exercising consistently, taking better care of himself. Doing things around the house unprompted, depositing checks and paying the bills. He was wrong about this, though. John did have to keep the photo. In case he ever was so cocky to think he was Sherlock’s only option. He had even sent the photo to Luther.
“Have you talked about your situation?”
John laughed at that. “Stay you git. There’s plenty of room here.”
“As you were, you out shined Wiggins, who seems to have learned from your modeling.”
“Thank you John. I know I really have no right to say what I did to you. But I love both of my boys, and I can’t bear to see you tear each other apart. Believe me, when you were still living here, it was Sherlock I meddled with, for all the good that did. Now go wash up, in a while you will have to pick Rosie up from school. Let’s have a bite.”
Friends are such an important part of life. They listen to us, share our experiences, entertain us, provide us with small mysteries. In this chapter, there is Rosie interacting with her friends, and peers, sharing family experiences.  Our men will check in with some of their friends, and we will have a glimpse of the influence they have. Also, one daughter has not been fooled by her new dad's silence about a certain someone, who he shared some time with.  John will get a reminder that he is not the only person who knows Sherlock has a very human side to him.
“We will but only for the weekend. Myc has lots of loose ends to tie before we travel, in a couple of weeks. So, John is definitely not coming?"
The suspect and Stewart had climbed to a diner’s roof. Stewart quickly grabbed onto the man, as Sherlock joined them, but the suspect slipped just out of reach, pulling Stewart into a chokehold instead, and pointing a gun to his forehead. Sherlock held his hands out in front of himself, speaking loudly in a conciliatory tone. He moved towards them slowly. John made it to the roof stealthily, taking out his own gun, waiting, trying to control his breathing.
John wasn’t able to recognize him from pictures. He was tall, and slim, brown/black buzz cut, brown eyes, pale skin, and an irish accent. He had been dressed oddly, for a kidnapper; expensive short sleeve white shirt, tailored gray pants and leather shoes. It could be anyone. Even looking through the military files, there were too many people, and too many generalizations. Then Sherlock jumped up.
“It definitely made a great impression on Greg. I wanted my brother to see you.” said Sherlock, still looking mostly at Mycroft, and now also at Bill and Molly.
“Then do it. I’ve already prepared.”
Sherlock remained very quiet, but thought to himself ‘Ugh, Sarah again’.
The wedding guests were staying at Castle Goring, which Mummy and Anthea had succeeded at by cashing in every favor generations of Holmes in the English Government had ever been owed since such government had been established. Anthea together with Harry and Meghan Watson worked as a team, forcefully dedicated to supervise the final touches at the venue. Sherlock couldn’t help feeling grateful, as he was left only with entertaining Watson and the Lestrades, who were spending the day with Mummy.
That's all she wrote! We leave our men together, happy and with the prospect of future danger, in the support and company of their family and friends! Thank you so much for sharing this happier, loving version of them with me! Kudos and comments help validate my belief that some people might share my liking for these stories of mine.
“Home, John, call it what it is. Are you sure about this? You are ready to come home?”
Sherlock tasted Mycroft’s cake, which was an almond caramel cake, very good. Then he tasted the slice in front of him. Surprisingly exquisite. “Chocolate and whisky?” He asked. “This one.”
They finally stopped to take a breath. “That… that was the most ridiculous thing I have ever done!” John said as he caught his breath, but he was smiling.
“Thank you so much, Dr. Sternbach, for helping him, and for telling me what happened. I neither accepted the position nor have a commute plan. I’m actually going to leave in a while. I do have one thing to tend to. If you are ever in London...”
“It’s gonna be tough. You guys just started up again. Well, he’s been known for being “married to the work”."
“Yes! Sherlock is not good with surprises. I’m scared he’ll freeze. Go into his Mind Palace. I invited Nana Hudson, to help with him if it goes belly up.”
7:00 am
Sherlock’s hands went up in the are as he said, “Ugh, Harriet. Why can’t the woman keep a confidence? You don’t have to exp…”
********
“So that’s something for you to think about. Are you going to call Donovan?”
They spent a week at the cottage, but life beckoned at Baker Street. There was school to finish for Rosie, conferences and meetings for John, plus his art exhibition and comic book publishing, “The Family Life of a Remarkable Rose”. Sherlock was wildly proud of his husband and daughter. He continued working with D.I’s Donovan and Harris. Rosie made a new friend, who moved across the street, at Mrs Turners. Well mannered, shy and tall for his age, Martin also had two dads, doctors both of them, the Sternbachs.
John called emergency services and gave the man a more thorough check up. Definitely under the influence of something. He didn’t like that the man’s slurring got worse and his skin colder.
Sherlock gave him an apologetic smile. “I saw. I did find Dr. Sternbach less annoying than most. He was kind and funny. I like him. Care to guess the first thing he said to me?’
Sherlock’s face locked up at that. Harry took the conversation to the better, lighter way they were getting along now a days, though she saw clearly that Sherlock wasn’t able to trust John’s intentions. She really couldn’t see a solution, other than time and constant reassurance. Apparently, John was better aware these days and understood now that as much as he had always denied it, he too had been affected by their fathers’ homophobia. Also his lack of communication and his bad experiences with Mary, were a big part of their problems. John was working towards developing better skills. It remained to see if Sherlock could be patient enough
-Taking care of her is not a problem! The issue we are having is that she has a tear on her trainer. She caught it on that horrible counter corner at your place when you two were hurrying out. Her foot is unharmed. SH
***********
“Sherlock, thank you for being so frank. You are doing the right things here. You are very important to some people, me and my girls included. Don’t fight this alone. Let me refer you to an excellent therapist, who works with adults on the spectrum. He isn’t like anyone else I know.” Mike said, looking directly at him.
“Sherlock Holmes, your… colleague. You seem like a decent bloke, why would you work with a psycho that gets off on murders and suicides and anything bloody?”
“Back upstairs?’
John was reminded, not gently, just how much influence Mycroft had.  “Do you remember Charles Augustus Magnussen, Dr Watson?” The man in front of him snarled. “... I have much more intimate information pertaining you, your family and your activities and many times the influence he had. Documents that you may swear never existed might easily materialize, oath sworn and signed by impeccable witnesses. It’s in your own best interest to exercise utmost caution when considering my brother’s right to see his little girl.”
“It does because you look so beautiful! You are luminous and I don’t know what to do!”
So John took it purposefully slow . He gave Sherlock space, but texted him every day. Early, so he had a good morning greeting waiting on the phone, and late, to fill him in about what happened during the day. They exercised together. They went back to the boxing ring, but never sparred with one another. They rode their bicycles, and sometimes, they included their daughter. They got together at John’s place, and cooked for their family. Sherlock taught him how to make all of Watson’s favorite foods. John took pictures with his phone. Sometimes, when he was alone, he picked some and made them into his cartoons.
“Sherlock….”
“I had been hoping I had made an impression on you, Sherlock.”
“Why was he giving you the treatment? What problem do you have?
Sherlock’s eyes just filled with tears. Happy tears. Harry danced away, and John took Sherlock’s hand and they just started dancing. Friends and family cheered. Stood up in their seats and danced and clapped along. The girls let go blue and silver balloons.
“Thank heavens, she fell asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow, because the whole neighborhood heard.” Said Mrs Hudson, and her eyes held an expression he didn’t recognize “John, had you said that word, I wouldn’t be able to call you a friend anymore.” Clearly struggling with her emotions even now.
Sherlock blinked, confused. “Of course I was! I was screaming your name. Over and over!”
“After your divorce, you  had an affair with a man that didn’t quite work out. It ended and you decided to travel. You have had some one-nighters with men, but you haven't liked that much.”
The encounter had left him a little jealous in spite of knowing Sherlock was not attracted to women. He didn’t like the idea of Sherlock going to the morgue to be ogled by Molly Hooper. He got home, hoping Sherlock was in a stay in mood, so they could be close. When he got there, Sherlock wasn’t in, nor had he left a note.
They put slick on their hands. John got them to lay side by side.This was overwhelming him. John hadn’t realized just how much he had missed his madman, until he felt complete as he never had since he left 221B. He almost could not believe it, this miracle, Sherlock by his side once more. He remembered how his love liked to be handled, slowly, firmly to start, then faster and harder on the head. Too soon, he was close. His legs quivered, his bullocks tightened up.
Sherlock has been going to Dr.Quentin, working with him. He is now ready to be back home. Following doctor's orders he engages in activities not shared with John in the past.  One small indiscretion,  one date and one phone call,  and all of the sudden, Sherlock decides to conduct an "experiment".
“You don’t understand! This is a surprise!! Sherlock hates surprises! This is a bad idea!!” Rosie fretted.
“Like he don’t know about it. These days he gets it from Himself in the flesh.”
********
“You berk! This should have gotten at least a couple of stitches! You could have gone to Mike! Now I’m going to have to clean it. It’s infected. Come.”
“No, boring.” said Sherlock, looking at the ground.
“For me it’s this, doing things together, and not getting bored, finding these animals, and… John, did you ever open my luggage?”
Although there was a perfectly able photographer, who had no intentions of murdering anyone, John took his own pictures. One was of Harry showing mummy Holmes a dance move. One was of Greg sitting next to his ex-wife, on the stairs of the castle, looking at the ushers place the seats for the ceremony. One was of Rosie, looking up at Mel, as she put her hair up, with a look of total admiration. His favorite was of the brother’s Holmes, Mycroft standing in his usual rod-straight stance, as Sherlock fixed his tie for him. The brothers were deep in conversation, looking at each other, for once, true affection shining through.
As always a thank you and a shout out to two extraordinary beta readers, authors, artists and overall amazing friends,
“You are very loyal, very fast.”
John held her closer. “He texted me a while ago, he’s on his way and bringing fish and chips for us. Of course I called him.”
The cottage had a nice low lighting, there was a fire in the fireplace and there was John, an absolute vision in his uniform, looking at him with a smile.
When it was ready, Sherlock took a bowl, which John had only filled a third of. The Detective said, “This has... peas in it.” with such a dubious look, John couldn’t resist, “Excellent deduction!” Sherlock saw John giggling and he started up too, throwing his napkin at him. Now he relaxed, and started telling John about the case, how he had gone to Barts to check on the results of the testing on the first suspicious suicide, then, after talking with Molly, he had decided to go to Baker Street for some of his clothes, to look more ‘professional’. He told John about not getting along with Donovan and Anderson. As he talked, John noticed he had finished the risotto, peas and all. He sneaked a couple of spoonfuls more onto his bowl, which Sherlock also ate.
The River Boys opened the floor with “Better When I’m Dancing”. Watching John’s unbridled happiness, the way his eyes shined and his laughter reached them easily, watching his Watson dancing with Pepsi, laughing as Nyla attacked them with a bubble gun, he could stop telling himself that a wedding was unnecessary or insignificant, or dumb. That John had done this, was everything.
At the reception, Sherlock gave his best man speech and John couldn’t help but noticing the difference from the last time he had such a task. Sherlock was happy. It was noticeable in his eyes, his looks for the grooms, his rare smiles. He spoke about Lestrade, how much he had helped Sherlock when he had been a lost, confused young man, and how, in spite of Sherlock’s temper, he had remained a true friend.
John felt terrible, but decided to go with the truth. “It’s very different with me…” He said, looking at the desk in front of him. “...she hates the flat. Hates what I make for dinner. Resents me trying to check or review her homework. Rosie never tells me what’s wrong. She doesn't talk about anything she does with Sherlock. She has even stopped calling me Dad.” John felt a knot in his throat. He looked decidedly at Ms.Lane, not wanting to see a smug look on Sherlock’s face.
When they got to Mycroft’s he greeted her warmly, and showed her what would be her room. When she asked for Sherlock, Mycroft told her he was resting, he hadn’t felt well all week. After tea, for which Mycroft had given her the most delicious chocolate dipped biscuits, Sherlock finally appeared, and Rosie almost fell out of her chair  in her hurry to get at him and hug him. He smelled as if he had just taken a shower, like lavender and home. He hugged back and sat down on the living room couch with her on his lap.
“Yeah, I remember, you picked my locks, took my badge, my food, but never my money…”
Once at the Holmes’ place, Mummy’s upset face changed instantly as she saw who Sherlock came in with. John decidedly hugging Sherlock loosely, his hand on his back. Rosie, who had been worried Sherlock had gone to the hotel room to mope alone, brightened up seeing her two fathers walking in together, she ran to hug John. “You made it! You’re staying for the wedding, right?”
-Sherlock, this is Watson. John brought me to Harry's in Cadriff. He said it was an emergencu. I didn’t want to come. I miss you. Wait for me. I’m coming back. He promised. I love you. Please, don’t do something stupid Bumble. RWH
“You’re the one asking.” Said Sherlock, sounding a little drunk still or maybe already half asleep, as he came back to bed, he settled into John’s arms, head on his chest, lanky body curled up like a cat’s. The way he always did, after sex, or after cuddles which had been nightly until that last year. Sherlock fell asleep quickly. It was John who stayed awake, playing with Sherlock’s hair, he admitted to himself he had missed these curls so much. The sex had been spectacular, the best ever, it had always been better with Sherlock, bar none. Jesus, what was he supposed to do now? They couldn’t go back to the fights and sex didn’t cure anything. Could they maybe agree to talk it out? There was no way he wanted a life without this madman, but could they really be a couple again? Should they even try?
-We? SH
“She brings her work to me when she’s done, and she asks when she doesn’t know something, which is rare.”
Sherlock’s cheeks went slightly pink. “Who was this boyfriend I had?’ he asked, not looking at her.
“It might not be Sherlock, but I know what it’s like to love a little girl that should be your own, and want to do the best by her. I’m here for you. I got you if you want me to help you kick his arse. I’m friends with Lestrade too, and I’m a persistent Yard element.”
You never told me about the school conferences and the specials! Of course you didn’t, you were ashamed of living with me! You couldn’t even bring yourself to call me your  “partner”, I was always your bloody “best friend!” When we were out together, you wouldn’t even hold my hand! Even if we were miles away from the Yard!
They analysed different plans for taking care of executive functions for himself, finding a good combination of charts, calendars and apps to help him keep track of self care, caring for Rosie for his home and his finances by himself, as a way of being more independent.
“Do you see these situations in your relationship with Sherlock?”
The EMS had to call for a backup, as they were taking Mr. Bennes, the witness, to hospital to find out what he had been injected with and to ensure he was healthy. Now they were strapping the suspect, who was drowsy and refused to talk, to another cot, but they needed another vehicle. As the first ambulance left, the EMS paramedic tried to look at Sherlock’s foot, but in his near panic, he refused to be touched. John helped him take off his shoe and a very bloody sock. “There we are, just let him check your foot, love.” Said John, holding his hand.
“No, how could you know? She never says a word about what she does with the other. You two cook together? She actually eats?”
“Greg’s thing” Sherlock whispered.
“Yes, Captain Watson.” said Sherlock quietly as she went down the stairs.
“From what my friend, Dr Stamford told me, that would mean quite a loss for the well being of Queen and country.’
“Andrew Beckwith Sr. died last year. He had the sole custody of his son, who is his sole heir. He received a considerable inheritance, including the man’s make-up business, which is outstandingly lucrative. Andrew Jr. is a smart, bright young man, and a prosperous business man, but he is quite physically compromised by cerebral palsy. He can’t live independently, and although he has professionals that have been taking care of him for a long time, you have been feeling guilty and spending more and more time with him, reconstructing a relationship that dropped off when he was five, and you moved to the States. Lizbeth, those are the facts, right? Why would you think that Charlie, being a nurse, and a mother herself, would fail to accept Andrew, or fail to understand that a young woman felt ill equipped to deal with such a responsibility and moved away?”
Voicemail 9:30 am  “Ahmm. Sherlock, look. I’m on a train to Cardiff to see Harry. I know these are your days, but it’s an emergency of sorts. I’ll make it up to you somehow. We’ll talk when we get back.”

“Can I come with? I have my running shorts and trainers. We can catch breakfast later and I can, I don’t know, help with the case? Make calls? What do you say?”
Ms. Lane got down to business. “Rosie is doing very well in school. She continues to perform above grade level, even being the youngest student in the class. Her social skills are still appropriate, I’ve observed her getting closer to Nyla, whose parents are going through a divorce. They talk a lot during class. One thing I have observed, is that Rosie seems to have the need to solve problems. She has been striving for nothing less than perfection in her work…”

Our men will encounter plenty of challenges. So enjoy the party, the music and the dancing. Enjoy the sweet moments these two share... and invest in some tissues.
John then brought up something he had been keeping in, “By the way, did you know I was insanely jealous of Greg?”
John took Sherlock’s hands in his and looked him in the eyes. Finally, finally, he saw some hope there. Maybe they did have a chance after all.
They signed the papers. John helped Sherlock get dressed and changed his own bloody vest for the new one. They got Sherlock's medicines and caught a cab to John’s flat. What would be their last night there. Once they were in, Sherlock in the bed, his protests ignored, they shared a cuppa, and Sherlock asked John to tell him his side of the story, and John obliged. He also told him about his encounter with Mycroft.
**********
Sherlock did not like to feel confused. It was proving difficult to define John’s intentions. He was being friendly, letting Watson invite him to dinner, then splitting his salad with him, giving him most of the olives. Then, did he ask for dessert because Sherlock had only eaten half his part of the salad and the shiitake mushrooms? After so much food, he relented from getting a cab immediately in favor of walking with Watson. The walk was beautiful. John had kept remarking on different things until Sherlock felt compelled to talk about history, just to avoid any intimate subjects.
She burst into tears “This is so bloody stupid. I’m going to work to help save up for our house! We had a budget planned out, and because I’m an idiot, now you have to do it all by yourself!” She cried into her husband’s belly. “There, don’t fret you! It was my fault for coming in all clumsy like and scaring you! You should be angry at me! Don’t worry now, we’ll get the house. Just a little later than planned, huh? We got to get this sorted out and I’ll take a little time from work after your operation. Don’t get yourself in a state, love, I’m here for ya, I got you.”
They spent the afternoon together. At first, Mrs Hudson taking things from shelves and cupboards and closets and putting them in two different boxes; donate or trash. Sometimes she took a piece and talked about it, then either put it back or boxed it. When she was done for the day, boxes full, she put on the radio and started singing along. Throughout it all, Sherlock sat, and thought. He half listened at times until the smell made him happy. She was making her extra special cinnamon rolls. Hudders always used real ingredients, not the hateful vanillin, or the ‘sugar cinnamon’. The more the rolls smelled, the more Sherlock came out of his anger, so when the smell of coffee came through, he was ready for it.
“Shut up!” yelled Sherlock, sounding angrier than Lestrade deserved. When Lestrade left, Sherlock looked at John. “Did it bother you, that he knows?”
“So O’Keilie, you went from working for children to threatening them in such a short period of time. What was your thought process for such a plan?”
Sherlock looked at the picture, then back at John. “Is he new at the Yard?"
John bitterly regretted the fight. He had reduced himself to his pettiest, meanest form. The one he tried to vanquish, the one who had stayed in a sham marriage, without looking for a better option, neglected a daughter, and abused a best friend. He did not want to be that person ever again. Undeniably, Sherlock was as much Rosie’s dad as he was. Nothing would erase or equal the care Sherlock had given Rosie as a newborn. When Mary left, Rosie had never taken formula. Sherlock succeeded where Molly didn’t, helping her get used to the bottle, buying dozens of different formulas until he hit the jackpot with one she would drink. They hadn’t even been a couple yet. Sherlock was right, he probably knew more about Rosie’s thoughts, friendships and preferences than John did, and the love they had for each other was plain to see. They were both terrified that John would take away their visits. He had no intention to do so, he thought.

“Well, I’ll let you get back to work. Oh, remember, Harry and Meghan are coming in tomorrow. They’ll stay at a hotel. Hmm… maybe we could, you know, get together with them? Anyway.”
“You didn’t baby. You never pretended to want a relationship with me. This is a friendly arrangement. I will text you to see how you are feeling, ok? Don’t let it get to you.”
“I don’t miss having a mother, because I have
“Ahg, why the stupid coppers have to come, eh?... I don’t even know if he started the damn treatment.” said the veteran, who appeared drunk.
“Wait, Charlie wants to move back? I haven’t even been able to talk to her yet, and you know?” Lizbeth’s voice was raising, and her eyes seemed to flash.
The younger men walked away, arms around each other. Sherlock went into the cottage, that was illuminated with lanterns that mimicked candlelight. There was no sign of John.
-Everything alright? You left before I saw you.
Once dried and back in the room, Sherlock had John stand up in front of the bed. Looked at him. John found his concentrated gaze exhilarating. He could see the genius fast at work.
“There is no one else. There hasn’t been anyone for months. No one else ever mattered. Only you.” said John.
“One more thing, Johnny, what the fuck was that about telling His Nibs, he was going to annoy the teachers if he went to meetings? Or that he was going to cost Rosie her friends? That sounds more like Mary, than the John that defended him from other people’s insults and always found him ‘amazing’, ‘fantastic’ and ‘extraordinary’.” Harry was getting louder as their conversation went on.
“Goodness you are boring Watson, I really fail to understand what in the world Sherlock sees in you. Of course he is mine, I’m a clever, exciting Consulting Criminal. The only one in the world. I can give him lots and lots of work. What can you give him? Orgasms? Boring! Anyone can stimulate a body. I know how to stimulate his mind. You will bore him, sooner than later. Then he will look for me Captain. He will try to make it pass as fighting crime, but you and I know it’s me he wants,” Moriarty said, his voice thick as honey.
Another attendant came and talked briefly with John. Then she took Rosie to the small ‘rest area’ in the front. She came back twenty minutes later, with a raspberry Orangina and sat in her seat, facing away from him. He let her be, and suddenly thought that Sherlock might also be freaking out. He had tried to  call various times and Sherlock had not answered. He had left a voicemail and a text. John would deal with him when he got back.
