“You won’t change a letter of it. It’s mine now and you can’t take it back.” Tears formed in John's eyes and when Sherlock saw them, he dropped to his knees and hugged John’s legs. He buried his face in his lap, breathing too fast and then starting to cry, “No! No, no, no! I’ve done it again! You’re crying! You’re sad! I made you sad. I’m a horrid, horrible person, I knew it. I can’t help it. Stop it, please stop crying, I can’t stand it!”
By now John was muttering under his breath and jamming his phone with his thumbs.
He smacked him again and left his hand in place, rubbing the skin and squeezing the flesh. The way Sherlock was grinding and clenching his cheeks caused the plug to ease in and out of his swollen hole and John took advantage of the movement to grip and twist it. Sherlock bucked, almost wrenching it from between John’s fingers, but he held on and began to tug, just enough pull it up against the rim of muscle holding it in place.
Sherock groaned and stretched and then clutched John fiercely to him. He rolled them over so that he was now on top. He said, “I can’t break away from these chains, John. They’re yours.I don’t want to break them. Bad habit for me to get into.” And he kissed him.
John answered rapid fire. “He’s had breakfast. You can offer him something for tea around 1,” and turned around to glare Sherlock into silence, “BUT he doesn’t have to eat it. I will be here by 4. If there’s traffic I’ll call you for a car with sirens to come get me, but I don’t expect any problems. He knows there will be severe consequences for ANY infractions,” another glare, “and he knows he should be grateful to you for helping him out this way.” He turned once more at Sherlock’s indignant inhalation and fixed him with his best, grim captainly face and said, “Don’t you, Sherlock” in a tone that was far from questioning. Sherlock closed his eyes and raised his chin. Through gritted teeth, he spoke directly to John. “Yes, I know.”
There we are, he thought, that’s the mindset we’re looking for. Needy. Willing to ask for what he needs and at ease with letting go.
Sherlock took 3 shuddering breaths and began to sob.
“Yes. You are. Hurry up.”
“I know, love, but I had to make a decision. I haven’t worked since last week and—”
He hadn’t set the timer, because he hadn’t been sure how long he needed, so when he’d sturdied up his backbone sufficiently, he sounded the alarm tone and walked back to the chair. He said, “Ok, on to business, let’s get it over with.”
Sherlock managed to get out, “I’m not hun—“ before John cut him off.
Sherlock yelped and said, “Duly noted.”
“You’re muddled. Teasing is part of the reward.” John ghosted his fingers over the tender skin of his arse, bringing up chills all over the rest of him. He continued to provoke. “Are you sure you wouldn’t like a nap? Rest might be the best thing for you and your arse right now, you know. Speaking as your doctor.”
When Sherlock came back from the kitchen, a quartered scone was waiting for him. He rolled his eyes, but sat and fueled the transport.
Settling, Sherlock conceded, “I did not like disappointing him. Especially when he told me I was being ordinary. That it was beneath me to act like the savages we had to associate with at school. I never would have made it through school without him, taking over the roles of the adults. I hated him for it but he would not give up. He bought me chemicals, equipment, things no one else would when I did well, and yes, he punished me when I didn’t. He kept them from expelling me, reminded them they’d be sorry if they lost such a promising intellect. Ha! As if… He offered to handle the…disciplinary problems as they occurred. They were certainly happy to wash their hands of me.”
For this I am sorry. So, so sorry. If I knew any words deeper than sorry, I would use them now. I will not ask for forgiveness. It is unnecessary. You have already forgiven me, you ridiculous man. I do not deserve it. I am desperately grateful.
I did not anticipate that yours would be the hardest letter to write. Upon my initial consideration, I planned to overwhelm you with sweet sentiment, knowing how susceptible you are to such manipulation. But, damn you, the discipline of forcing my thoughts onto paper has deprived me of my exceptional gift for dissembling. It is second-nature for me to deceive in the moment, sometimes, even without intending to. You know this of course, and though you have had some little success in reforming these tendencies in me, I find that in the quiet reflection of writing you a letter, I cannot be other than honest and, to my disgust, sincere.
John nodded and stood up to strip without taking his eyes off him. It hurt to slide the jumper over his head and lose sight of him for even that moment. When he finished, he looked at himself, then back at Sherlock. “Look what you’ve done to me. I’m not going to last.”
John took a firmer hold on his waist, trying to keep him from jolting himself off. He knew he must be terribly sore, and ten more was going to be a struggle for him to bear. He didn’t need any more bruising to help him remember the lessons of the weekend. John let his hand spring off the firm muscles of his bum as fast as he could and the ten were over in that many seconds. He’d only just been able to hold him on his lap. The damage was clearly done, because Sherlock was limp and weeping and it sounded like a broken heart to John.
Wilder: Yes. Eat. You eat?
Dinner was indeed done when Sherlock returned, resplendent in a blue silk dressing gown and purple boxers. The table was set, candles were lit and all accoutrements in place. They flirted all through dinner, twirling their arms to drink their champagne, feeding each other strawberries and chocolate cake and trading innuendoes. Eventually, John looked theatrically at his watch and said, “Oh, quarter of eight! You have somewhere to be, don’t you? Don’t want to be late.” Sherlock froze, then started to rise. John grabbed his wrist and said, “You should open your gift first, though.” He handed the small box to him.
Sherlock was sitting there, waiting for him and John asked, “Are you ready?” He paused a moment before answering, “Yes, sir,” in a low, steady, voice. John set the chair so that Sherlock would be able to rest his torso on the bed, while his long legs hung off John’s lap. He sat down and Sherlock came around to stand in front of him in his dressing gown and pyjama bottoms.
He checked his watch—3:40.
“No. Trousers.”
Sherlock was stunned into silence. His mouth in a perfect circle, he turned to look at John. Then with a huff of irritation, he said, “You’re right John! How could I have missed that? How could you have understood that before I have?” Frowning, John looked around to see if they were in view of anyone, then he pinched him on the arse.
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and said, “It’s boxing, John, not ballet.”
When he returned, John took his seat and nodded at Sherlock who replaced his hands and faced the corner. John said, “I’m starting the timer now.” Sherlock’s shoulders settled. He needed two reminders, when John could tell from a subtle change in his posture, that he had left the present moment and gone off into his mind palace, but for the rest of the time, he was focused. When the timer went off, John gave him a quiet, “Well done.” Sherlock tried to hide a proud little smile, and John gestured him over. Sherlock approached determinedly and asked if he could get a pillow to muffle his head, but John said no. “I need to be able to hear you and I think you should hear yourself. I don’t want you running away inside somewhere.”
Between gasps, Sherlock stammered out, “You were right. You… you… you… were carrying a grudge."
10 smacks and Sherlock inhaled sharply, starting to shift on John’s lap.
Things go wrong, but not as badly as they could have. Still, there will have to be consequences.
Mycroft said, “I’ve often wondered if his paternal role—”
“Mmm, s’cold.”
In his most innocent voice, Sherlock asked, “Why are you in such a rush? Not enjoying yourself?” He looked positively mournful and John chastised himself.
Time to ease him back into his consequences. “How about we get ready for a walk?”
“How did I feel when I found you?”
“Rise and shine, gorgeous. It’s Day 48, quite a milestone, don’t you think?”
John puffed out all the air he had been planning to rage with in a choked laugh. He pushed Sherlock’s thigh back and slapped him right on the arse. Then he laughed out loud. “Thinking you’re clever, taking the piss when you want a bit of rough, yeah? But always bare-arsed, idiot. Asking for it, aren’t you?”
“You have one more day. What are you so worried about, anyway?”
“It’s going to be all right, love.”
John cleared his throat. He put down his tea and picked up the letter, folding it and unfolding it casually. He looked blandly at Sherlock, who took a sharp breath. He muttered, “Sorry. Go on.” John looked back at Mycroft and put the letter down.
“It’s gonna take me a few minutes to get dressed anyway.”
Sherlock blushed yet again, and stammered, “What’s for dinner?” to change the subject. John put the package back in the center of the table and said, “It won’t take long. A recipe of Angelo’s. Spaghetti with oyster sauce.” He looked at Sherlock from under his eyelashes. “You know what they say about oysters.” Sherlock swallowed hard. John stepped into Sherlock’s space and somewhere on the scale between whisper and growl, said, “Why don’t you take a shower? Do a good job. Thorough, you know?” His pupils were dilated and he edged closer and carefully pushed up his chin to close his mouth, which had dropped open at some point. “Pasta will be done by the time you finish.”
“Yeah—I need to get it off my chest. Five minutes, no violence.”
Sherlock obediently kept his hips still against the mattress, but he was thrashing his head back and forth as the waves of pleasure began to overwhelm him. John smiled around the beautiful obstruction in his mouth and inserted his finger to the first knuckle. Sherlock clenched around him and John wished they had enough time to pursue that avenue more thoroughly. Not now he thought sadly. He pushed a little farther and was rewarded with more head thrashing and a guttural, “Pleeeeeease.” Sherlock was twisting the sheets in both fists. That was his second request, he thought. Once more and it will be time. He pushed his finger in completely, and began twisting and sliding, twisting and pushing, and then the third time, “Please John, please, John, John, please--” his voice breaking on the last syllable and John knew he had him. He found his prostate and rubbed gently, once, twice, three times and Sherlock thrust his hips up helplessly, thrusting against the back of John’s throat, coming seemingly endlessly. John swallowed most of his release but allowed some to spill down Sherlock’s still pulsating cock.
To his great displeasure, the door to the locker room open and in stepped a tall, very young looking man with dark brown skin and black eyes. His shoulders were enormous.
“No.”
“Save it. You know you earned it.” John continued to rub gently, eliciting peevish sounds when he hit a particularly sensitive spot. “Sorry, love, but it will help. Are you cold? I don’t think you're going to enjoy covering up your bottom. When I finish I’ll get you a shirt.”
Not in Brixton. No word from Crosley. –B
If you're enjoying these words, be sure to send virtual hugs to tiaoconnell, who continues to make them better than they would be without her.
John walked abound to the other side of the bed and clambered across to him. He wanted Sherlock’s head out of the pillow and he eased himself underneath and gave him his shoulder to cry on instead. To remind him he wasn’t alone. He was itching to get a cool compress and aloe onto the stripes, but he was more concerned about Sherlock’s emotional health at the moment. They were messing about in sensitive areas and John felt a great responsibility to keep him feeling safe.
John reached down to kiss that delicious mouth and Sherlock rolled over to make it easier. Desperately, he said, “Fuck me John, please. Hurry.” John nodded in full seriousness and pulled back. Sherlock lifted his hips up and John rearranged the pillow underneath.
Sherlock shook his head and said, “More than ok. Ok is not enough. That was something else. Come here, you’re too far away.”
John held still, not in fear for Sherlock’s comfort, but to be mindful and take exquisite notice of the tight, wet heat that surrounded his cock. They panted together, the sound filling the otherwise silent room, each waiting for the other’s equilibrium. Sherlock adjusted his hips, one at a time, pushing forward, then pulling back, wanting more, but not so much. They both moaned at the slight shift, Sherlock as John’s girth and length took up new space inside him, and John, as those spaces molded themselves around him more closely. John saw Sherlock’s head tilted back, his mouth open in a perfect O, brow furrowed as if in pain or intense concentration and watched for the signs that would show he was ready for more.
Sherlock wiped viciously at the tears sliding down his cheeks, but answered softly, “Yes. I am.” In his mind’s eye, John saw a teenager as thin and sharp as fine crystal, steeling himself against the brutality of teachers and headmasters, trying to break him and failing and he was grateful they had never succeeded. He was so proud of him, refusing to shatter against trivial mentalities, but breaking himself open to his lover, brother and friends.
Sherlock closed his eyes and finally said, “I can’t think of any way for you to fuck me that wouldn’t hurt my arse. And I want to fuck you John. Please? Let me fuck you?”
“What if she cries?”
As far as the grounding was concerned, now that he’d seen the effects, he had no worries about Sherlock forgetting the nature of the paddling. He wouldn’t be forgetting about it for a while.
He walked to the door, and turned to watch Sherlock make his awkward way to the loo. He’d have to refresh the ointment for him after breakfast.
Mrs. Hudson was waiting at the foot of the stairs, hands held up to cup his face. “Sherlock,” she said chastisingly. He dutifully bent his head and allowed her to touch her forehead to his, then lightly kiss his cheek. “You had us all frantic.”
John phoned him. “If you come now, I’ll let you have at him for five minutes, but it’s only going to work if it’s really over when it’s over.”
Wilder addressed John.
When they’d finished, John asked, “Well?”
“And what else? What else was I feeling?”
Mycroft next.
John smiled and said, “There’s my snarky boy back again. I was starting to miss him. Silly me. Do you need help getting dressed?”
A. I regret having increased the difficulty of the conditions of your employment.
“Five.”
"Do You Wanna Touch Me" by Joan Jett
Sherlock snorted. “Raul is a professional, John, you could hardly measure up.”
Mickey looked at John, then away. “Jittery on coke. High. Or. You know. Strung out, in a nod. Hasn’t happened in a long time. Not since you’ve been in the picture, mate.” Mickey threw his arm around John’s shoulder. “Thanks for that. For making him happy.”
Upon revelation of the bum, John said, “Hmm. This color is very flattering on you. I think I’ll look for a scarf for you in just this shade.”
John said, “Hold on, hold on a second, that’s him.”
“Shut up Mycroft, it’s not about the money, you know that. Sarah is my friend. And I want to keep my hand in. And you know better than anyone, if I don’t have time away from him, I’m liable to kill him.”
“Back to the question: discomfort and embarrassment? Tell me how they’re correlated to the positive emotions. Why didn’t you feel those things before?”
Sherlock closed his eyes and took another deep breath in and shakily sent it back out. John went to work on his left ankle, then finally the right. He fastened his legs to the footboard at about the same location as his arms on the headboard, leaving him room to move his legs from side to side a bit, but not enough to close them all together. He could bend his knees just enough to let some of the weight of them rest on his heels, but not without a little bit of a strain. Sherlock had his eyes closed and was clenching and opening his fists, pulling his arms as far down as the thread would allow him. He slid his heels up and down on the sheet. His cockhead was wet now. John stood up and said, “Open your eyes, and look at me Sherlock.” Sherlock opened his eyes and had to look around to find John. He was panting again.
Sherlock got up reluctantly and John said, “Go and shower, then corner time. To put you in the right headspace.” Sherlock’s shoulders sagged and John felt a little sympathy, but reminded himself that Sherlock’s mindset was far more important than anything his body might be experiencing. He gave him a shove and said, “Quit stalling.”
John pushed the sweaty curls away from his forehead and kissed him tenderly.
“You were brilliant. Now. Go. Shower. I expect you at the table,” he looked at his watch, “in 12 minutes.”
“As a side note, have you ever wondered how much that costs, Sherlock? Scrambling special op units, helicopters? And how much it costs Mycroft personally, with his staff? Of course not…” He felt silly having brought it up.
Jack stuck out his hand and John gave him the sturdiest 5th Northumberland Fusiliers handshake of iron he could manage.
He kept it up just for the jealous little frown that flashed over Sherlock’s features at the mention of each name, then laughed and kissed him with a little more heat than was wise, considering that there will still hours to go before the drought ended. He reminded himself how hungry he was and set the table. John ate up the chicken salad while Sherlock picked. John nagged until he had eaten enough to satisfy him while the soup simmered on the stove. John said, “Might rain again and I’d like to get out before it does. You go get dressed, however you can while I clean up. Do you need to wear the coveralls again?”
Happy to be of service.—JW
After rousing himself twice, John forced himself to think of the uncomfortable itch of drying semen and extricated himself from Sherlock’s grasp. He grumbled, then grumbled some more when John wiped him clean, top to bottom with a warm flannel afterwards. John pushed him over to make room for himself under the duvet and rolled onto his side so that Sherlock could wrap himself around him. He had fallen asleep for the third time when Sherlock shook him harder than anything could have warranted under the circumstances.
Sherlock huffed. “You’re always hungry.” Naked now, he stepped into the shower with his body wash and shampoo. It was the cedarwood scent,
John kept running his thumb over the thin skin of the inside of his wrist. “There are all kinds of rules for games like these, Sherlock. Safewords, hard limits, soft limits, but you don’t have to worry about any of that. We’re only going to need two. Two rules. First rule. If you don’t like something, say stop. You say stop and I stop and that’s the end of it. You’re in charge. You decide. If you want to stop, I won’t be upset or disappointed. I’m so grateful that you trust me so much that you’re letting me try this out with you. For you. You just have to say stop. Ok?”
Lestrade stared at Sherlock without speaking.
Sherlock consciously attempted to relax, but John advised him, “Push back, love. It will make it easier for me to come in.” Sherlock did as he was told and the second finger slid in smooth as silk. Scissoring and stretching, John waited to hear the noises that told him Sherlock was ready for the third, a soft sigh. “What do you think, Sherlock, are you ready for another? Are you loose enough for my cock?”
“That’s not fair. We were going to sleep late and…do things.”
“Mmm,” Sherlock hummed, “your hands on technique is exceptional. Best I’ve ever experienced.”
Sherlock explained, sliding the towel across the skin of his back, between his two hands,
Looking down appraisingly at Sherlock’s quivering hole, then back at his face, John said “I understand what you want, love, but so help me Sherlock, if you let me damage you—“
Both of John’s fists were clenching now. He looked around, a little frantic, looking for a reason to speed the bastard up. The clouds of steam began to roll out from the showerhead and John thought, Good, that’ll cover him up a bit. “It’s getting humid, Sherlock. My temperature’s running high.”*
John let him go when he tugged this time and, exasperated, Sherlock answered, “Is there some sort of emotional insight you want me to come to here John? Can’t you just tell me what it is, rather than make me suffer through the interminable journey it would take for me to arrive there independently?”
John gave him a preliminary smack on his bottom and shoved him toward the loo.
Sherlock opened his mouth, “It wasn’t intentional."
Sherlock attempted to gather his dignity around himself and ignored him. His efforts were undermined by his awkward, halting steps. He shifted and winced, experimenting with his stride and John found his unusual lack of grace inordinately endearing. The walk took them longer than it usually would have.
God bless that cabbie, who was still waiting. As John ducked Sherlock’s head through the door of the cab, he noticed a familiar, long, black car pulling up tight behind them.  John ignored it, but Sherlock twisted his head, trying to keep his eyes fixed on it. John spoke calmly to the driver, “One more lap for the Gran Prix,” he said, as he gave a slight twist to Sherlock’s wrist, “221B Baker Street.”
“You're softening, John.”
“Hurry. Think!” Sherlock was somewhat incapable of rational thought while John was cupping his bollocks, but John persisted. “There’s no one in sight now, but we haven’t got the time to spare.”* He looked down at his hand, panting. “You’re naked. Christ on the cross, you’re fucking naked.” He pushed his head back down and kissed him, open-mouthed.
John gave him a filthy look. “You sure? I rather enjoyed it this evening.” He reached behind him and gave his bum a swat.
When Sherlock wandered, sheet- clad and yawning, into the sitting room, John was rested and full. He set out a plate for him and stood next to him at the side table feeding him bites while Sherlock was still sleepy and pliable. When he truly woke up he began to harass John again about hurrying to the lab so he could complete his theory of the case.
“Where the hell was he?"
John grinned to himself.
“Yes, you’re right, it was supposed to be a free day, love, and I’m very sorry, but plans have changed.” John spoke softly and soothingly, as if to a hissing kitten. He held Sherlock’s cheek and then stroked his wild hair back off his forehead. “We did talk about it last night, but we’ve also talked about how plans have to be changed sometimes. This is one of those times. Sarah’s been caught short at the surgery and I have to go. There’s no one else to fill in. So let’s finish what we started so at least we can have a pleasant morning,” he said, looking lasciviously down where his mouth had been a few moments before. His optimism was unwarranted.
“There’s a chicken in the fridge for this evening. I’ll be back when things have calmed down.”
Sherlock checked his watch and sighed with irritation. “So it is.” He gestured toward the sitting room. “If we must,” and they made their way to their chairs.
John had not been 100% teasing about the corner time, but he let the mild mocking pass, impressed by Sherlock’s constructive suggestion. “That’s brilliant. Ordinary, vacant humans frequently walk to solve problems. You've seen me storm out a few times, I'm sure." He slid him a knowing look out of the sides of his eyes. "Maybe it’ll work for your enormous brain, to figure out an emotional puzzle. By the way, you know you do the same thing to everyone else—make us work through things on our own. When you’re not showing off, that is. Especially me. Why do you think
“From a moving car? With the security detail following us? Should I consider myself to be in that much danger?”
“Yes.”
“Listen
“Holiday. Can’t be Christmas again already!”
Sherlock kept his eyes on him and trying not to make any noise with the chair, sat down gingerly.
The call was from Lestrade.
The shiny smear on Sherlock’s belly caught his eye and John maneuvered his chin around Sherlock’s erection, making sure to let the stubble on his cheek scrape gently against the hot skin. He kissed and licked at the wet patch noisily, blush spreading from Sherlock’s cheeks to his throat and down onto the pale skin of his chest. When Sherlock’s belly was clean, John turned his attention to the source of the stickiness. He rubbed his forehead, nose, cheeks, lips, all over Sherlock’s groin, inhaling the scent of his arousal, deeper and richer here.
The spankings proceed.
Sherlock was flushed red from his chest to his cheeks, with the combination of arousal and embarrassment that set John’s cock pulsing. Sherlock buried his face in John’s hair to hide. With his trembling fingers he brought John’s hand back around and along the delicate skin, covered with goosebumps. When he felt the base of the plug that Sherlock had buried inside him, John’s knees wobbled. He grabbed onto the sleeve of the coat to steady himself. “Fucking hell.” He swallowed and as he ran his fingers over it lightly, Sherlock shuddered. John rasped out, “How long have you had it in?"
“Yes, Sherlock, good.”
He texted again using a softer tone.
John walked over to him and pulled his head down to plant a kiss on his forehead. “I think it’s very sweet. Thank you.” Sherlock kissed him back with a shy hug and they companionably heated up the lasagna, poured the wine, and served themselves. It was divine. Sherlock ate what John considered to be a full portion and he watched him enjoy his entire tiramisu with abandon. Staring at him lick the spoon with a broad, swiping tongue, John regretted, again, the drought that would last until Sunday night. Sherlock swiped the inside of the container with his finger to scoop up every last bit of cream, and licked up from the base, humming as he sucked the last of it from the tip. John shook his head roughly to clear it of the filthy images flickering across his internal screen and cleared the table.
Sherlock swallowed and wisely said nothing.
When they entered the office Lestrade was already elbow deep in files, and Sherlock gave John a smug look. Lestrade looked pointedly at Sherlock, pointed to a chair and ordered, “Have a seat.” Sherlock blushed all the way to the tops of his ears and tightened his lips. “No.” John pinched his bottome and the blush deepened. Sherlock flinched. He stuck out his chin, closed his eyes, and corrected himself. “No, thank you,” he said. It put John in mind of himself as a first year French student, rolling words around his mouth, trying to make them fit.
“Won’t be necessary. You’re far too worried about this. Relax.”
John froze, shifted again and cleared his throat and Sherlock enjoyed his brief moment of triumph over the vibranium-strength will of Captain John Hamish Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. When he regained his composure, John gave him a tap and said, “Settle down and behave. Time for that later. Now, are you ready?”
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered and he practically sprinted towards the loo. John mirrored his smile and started to set the food out on plates. He set them in the microwave and went to the bedroom to strip and put on a dressing gown temporarily. He couldn’t gather himself to shower till he’d eaten. Sherlock was back at the table in eleven minutes, twenty-four seconds and John gave him a proper kiss. “Did I mention how amazing you were?”
Sherlock shouted in frustration, “Not fair!” and John called back, “Only two more days! Think of Mycroft.”
We will be unavailable for a few days.—JW
he thought.
Sherlock turned with his eyes drawn up, lids closed, lips drawn into a frown. He projected his infuriated but resigned tolerance of the entire situation. Restraining his impatience, he said, “Oh, do just get on with it, Mycroft.”
“This is only for us. You sign and I will present to the court my guarantee that the matter will be concluded in a manner agreeable to all. Your compliance with the contract will satisfy all parties.” Sherlock looked questioningly at him, but John only said, “You’re going to have to trust me on that. That’s my responsibility.” He waited until Sherlock’s eyes dropped and head nodded.
“You won’t let them hit you in the head, right?”
“Now, all of these…people,” his upper lip curling, “are watching and interfering and—”
“You going to be able to walk?
“You wanted to see!” he said indignantly.
“No. You don’t have to fix it. It’s not something you can fix. That’s what the letter’s for. Fixing the things you can’t fix.”
He held his breath, trying to remember if he’d seen Sherlock get dressed this morning. He hadn’t. Had he put pants on? But then John couldn’t decide if he wanted pants to be there or not so he let go of expectations and just enjoyed the view.
Sherlock gasped, “No, John. Aaaaah…aaaah…”
You sure he’s clean?—GL
Sherlock opened his mouth unconsciously, like a baby bird, then scowled when he realized what he was doing. He ate it anyway.
“Ok, love, you’re going to have to listen very carefully to this one. It may be too hard for you,” he teased. John slid his thumb inside the band of his pants, stretched it out away from his tight waist and let it snap. “What does that sound like, Sherlock?” Back to his ear, “Hmm?”
“Oh, nonsense you silly boy. Love isn’t childish. Not if you’re doing it right.”
“You’re a cruel man, John Watson. What makes you think I’ll even be in the mood tonight?” he said sulking.
After a few moments spent coming back down to earth, John elbowed Sherlock in the ribs. “Oi. Go shower so you have enough time to finesse your curls properly. I’ll make breakfast,” then quickly, to forestall the complaint forming on Sherlock’s lips, “Just tea and toast, no arguing. You’re not going to add low blood sugar to Lestrade’s problems this morning.”
He enjoyed a blissful few hours of quiet, reading the papers and working on the blog. He edited the letter to Lestrade a little more thoroughly, but overall was pleased by the portions that weren’t snarky or condescending. The insults seemed pro forma rather than intentionally hurtful. “In my defense, I was inadequately supervised.” “My transgressions might prove beneficial at a later date, incorporated into a training activity to improve surveillance protocols, for example.” Lestrade would expect nothing less.
Lestrade clicked off.
Sherlock flipped his hand over and kissed the back of the hand holding his own. John heard him whisper thank you, but it sounded very much like it was just to prove a point. No matter. He whispered back, “You’re welcome.”
“I can explain, John.”
She addressed herself to John next. “Well, I’ve taken a bit for myself, John, so show a little mercy, will you?” She headed for the door and John called after her, “I’ll keep it in mind.”
“No, no, Angelo, not that kind of sick, just a little…sore. Too much painting,” he said indicating the coveralls.
He rubbed at his face and said, “This time I really think I’ve gone as far as I can. Can you read it for me and see if it’s enough?”
“Yes.”
John pointed his finger at him. “Not another word, or I’ll add back the hour I so magnanimously deleted a moment ago. And depriving you of sleep is like trying to drown a fish. No wonder they couldn’t break you down.” He lowered his hands to Sherlock’s arse and gave a two-handed squeeze, causing Sherlock to whine and push his hips up against John’s. He stepped away quickly. The electricity between them was immediate. “If they’d known all they needed to do was redden your bottom, you’d have given up all of Mycroft’s secrets and brought the British Empire to its knees.”
“Uh, sorry. Squick. Uh. An uncomfortable feeling.” John pause. “But, come to think of it,” now John sat up, “Irene’s proclivities didn’t seem to disturb you, did they? I seem to recall you being somewhat, let’s say, intrigued by her hobbies. Couldn’t even look away, could you?” He stood. Sherlock was reorientated by the prickling of his skin, triggered by the primal threat of John’s simmering resentment. He looked up at his narrowed eyes and clenching fists. Oh dear. Bit not good.
Sherlock’s head dropped as the flush rose up from his throat.
John put the kettle on and brought Sherlock his plate. He patted his shoulder and said soothingly, “Only the citizens who matter, love.” While they were eating, John remembered his intention to boost Sherlock’s morale. “I read your letter to Greg,” he said, conversationally. “You were honest and apologetic, without fawning. You did a very nice job.”
“Another hour? Can you hold out that long or will you waste away?”
Please comment if you enjoy this at all. It's so very affirming.
The cabby gave him a face-splitting grin. “She already asked.” MI6 was always looking for drivers with nerves of steel. Somebody’d be profiting off the chaos of the day at least, John’s infernal optimism noted, always a silver lining.
“I’m in charge.”
As he followed Mrs Hudson out, John turned back casually and over his shoulder, called, “Eight o’clock, don’t forget.” He didn’t expect an answer and he didn’t get one.
John’s head dropped back and he slumped lower in the chair.
“Ooohhh, John please, I’m ready, I swear, I’ve waited so long already, now…”
“Because I misbehaved.”
John told himself he was being unreasonable and sat on the bench in front of the lockers. Sherlock sat down beside him and said, “I’m really… that is…I--you know…” John rescued him.
John laid a steadying right hand on his back and let the paddle fall onto Sherlock’s left cheek.
You’ll be the first to know—JW
John put the paddle down but he wasn’t satisfied. He snapped his hand down on the lowest arc of the delectable curves. Sherlock tensed and whimpered.
The next morning, or rather afternoon when John was capable of speech, he tried to explore Sherlock’s response to the idea of restraints. He was lying on the sofa, while Sherlock employed a surgical knife to carve up something hairy on the kitchen table. He began with feigned innocence. “We had a good time with Greg didn’t we. Funny conversation. I’m curious though, Sherlock.”
“You're almost better.”
The force of John’s lunging was sliding Sherlock’s chest back and forth across the slippery lining of John’s jacket, weakening the impact. Sherlock propped himself up on his elbows and braced his hands on the concrete to meet John's unstoppable force as an immovable object.
“Just try it.”
John held up his hand and Sherlock shut it again.
“Well then, you have my permission to stand up and walk to Lestrade’s desk. Sit in his chair and wait for me to ring his desk phone, then pick it up.”
John got up off the floor and grinned with shameless pride. He put his hands on his hips and said, “Basically. Yes.”
John said, “What’s that?”
Sherlock turned around and waved. John licked his lips and scraped them with his teeth.
“Be quick about it. I’ll be waiting. And wear your pyjamas. I’ll not have you distracting me with your naked perfection.”
Lestrade watched the exchange and came around to the front of the desk. He spoke directly to Sherlock now. “All right then, let me tell you what grateful looks like. You stay where I put you, you don’t pick any fights with anybody and no experimenting. And you,” poking his finger into John’s chest, “one minute after 4, and he’s in the cage. Oh,” he leaned over and grabbed a notepad from the desk, reading from it, “and a check-in on the half-hour and take-away for the division. Only the ones who didn’t volunteer to go out on patrol, which is half of ‘em,” looking pointedly at Sherlock, who attempted an innocent face. Lestrade continued. “You’re gonna sit at the desk up against the glass where somebody’s gonna be able to see you at all times. You can pace around the perimeter we set up but if you gotta use the loo, somebody goes with you.” Sherlock rolled his eyes, but to John, they sounded like well thought out precautions. John was impressed once again with Lestrade’s attention to detail, even if Sherlock wasn’t.
“That’s a detective for you!”
Sherlock moved to kneel in front of him, but John stopped him. “I have one question, before we start, and I’d like to know the truth. It won’t change anything, either way.” Sherlock gnawed on his lower lip, then nodded his head. “Were you really trying to escape the room? Or were you pleased with your cleverness?”
John gave him a matching blow on the right. Sherlock gasped, then cried out, “Two”.
John is considering early parole.
Sherlock nodded again and John smiled at him. He smiled back and said, “I understand, I have to keep talking.” John kissed his forehead.
John froze and forgot himself. “Sherlock!” He was bombarded with hisses and glares from the regulars who were sitting nearby. Even Sherlock was scandalised and gave him an indignant look. John grabbed his hand and pulled, but Sherlock resisted and pointed to the chair opposite him. John tugged again, to no effect, then tightened his lips and searched his meager mind cottage for the vocabulary he knew he lacked. Finally he outlined a child’s drawing of a house with his fingers, but Sherlock stretched out his legs and gestured to indicate that he was relieved and in no hurry. John jerked his thumb towards the door, and Sherlock stuck out his chin, silently refusing. At the end of his tether, John held out both hands, cupping them in the universal gesture for a luscious arse.
Angelo was solicitous. “You’re not sick, Sherlock? Let me make up some of Mama’s meatball soup, it will fix anything. Cured my nonna on her deathbed with the flu.”
And a thank you also to PsychGirl (snycock) for giving me a writing seminar I'll be learning from for a looooong time. Invaluable advice and amazing generosity from one person! How lucky am I?
Sherlock feigned great reluctance. “If you insist. At least it we can pretend there’s a purpose to your insistence on unnecessary promenading.”
“John. Sherlock.”
Since the day we met, you have seen me ignore the opinions of the rabble. Such is the change that you have brought about in my life, that I now care what some people think; some very few. (See previous letters). Most infuriatingly, I care, overwhelmingly, what you think.
II. I would recommend that you convey your gratitude to my spouse for the following realizations on my part:
“All right. Bed.”
Lestrade it was. He owed us anyway, John rationalised to himself. And I’m sure he could stash him in the cells as a last resort. Lots of restraining equipment available. He pushed the number.
He was startled out of his reverie by the chirp of an unfamiliar ringtone.
John took a deep breath. "In the wardrobe."
He reached the floor a bit breathless so he forced himself to pause a moment. Then he flung the door open and saw Sherlock through the glass, hands steepled under his chin and feet up on Lestrade’s desk.
Molly looked pleased. “Thank you Sherlock. I intend to. We might even have sex.” She grinned at them both.
“Because I frightened you.”
John stood up and muttered to himself, “I can’t believe I’m going to do this.” Honestly, he didn’t mind Sherlock’s sore arse in the abstract either. Especially when he didn’t have to be the only responsible grown-up in the room. Then to Sherlock, he said, “You know that if we do this, there’s no way on earth Mycroft’s not going to get his hands on them, right?”
They spent a quiet afternoon. As the sun set, John asked, “When do you propose we make the delivery?”
John gritted his teeth. “Tell me. Where you are.” He noticed that the cab driver had pulled over and was watching him in the rearview with a curious expression. John nodded to let him know he’d made the right decision. Wasted as a cabbie.
Sherlock grimaced. Four days would be the longest penalty period since he and John had agreed on the system that kept Sherlock responsible for his behavior. Grounded meant 30 minutes of fresh air and early bedtime each day. He would have to sit down, (or stand, more likely) for 3 formal meals a day, rather than the one John insisted on. Lost privileges meant no violin, internet, microscope or any other experimenting. He would be bored to madness. Most painful of all was no sex and no release. It felt almost cruel. A year ago such a theoretical deprivation of carnal indulgences would have been meaningless, but since John had awakened him to the pleasures of the flesh, its loss was grievous. It wasn’t that they hadn’t gone hands off for that long a period of time. Sherlock, in the middle of a case, was a virtual monk, forgoing food and sleep, least of all sex. It was the absence of even the possibility of physical intimacy that was punishing. Thinking about what he might be missing hurt. It added to the burden to know that John would be suffering also, despite his innocence. As John had explained it to him, the loss of that physical connection was a concrete reminder of the damage Sherlock did to a relationship when he failed to consider the effects of his behavior on others. The punishments John devised helped reestablish the connections. In this particular case, John said, “Molly and Mrs. Hudson will be right chuffed to see you fattened up a little and well rested and you’ll be eager and relieved to get back to your hobbies. It’ll make Mrs. Hudson happy to see you happy and make her shifts easier next week.” Sherlock sighed deeply. He acknowledged the suitability and nodded.
“Yes, it’ll just take me a minute.” John puttered, clearing away the flannels, gel and chair and putting his pyjamas on. He made him pick up his head so he could flip the pillow and slid in next to him. He fell asleep with Sherlock’s breath on his neck.
He thought, ‘Come on, Sherlock, 46 days. Don’t waste them.’ They had been good days, everyone agreed. Sherlock seemed to thrive on the predictability of a schedule. He had even toughed it through a sudden change when Mrs. Hudson had run a fever on one of her shifts and Sherlock had insisted (!) on taking her to the surgery for John to check her over. He’d gone home by himself after dropping her off at Mrs. Turner’s for her to fuss over, and he’d spent the afternoon composing. Positively domestic. They’d celebrated with Chinese takeaway and an epic night of shagging. Since Mrs. Hudson had spent the night, they’d exceeded all previous records for volume. John had had to order a new black silk blindfold after they’d discovered that somehow during the festivities they’d shredded the old one. John smiled dreamily. Good times.
Amends will be made.—JW
John’s jaw dropped and he took two steps back.
Please don’t hurt him. –MH
His stomach clenched as he dragged himself towards the stairs to Mycroft’s basement. He descended feeling more and more nauseated with each step. He took the keys from the pocket of his virtual Belstaff but leaned his forehead against the door, unable to lift them to the lock. He could not face the rehab rooms, the hallway of homelessness, or the echoing silence.
He paused and let the anticipation build, then let his second stroke fall parallel to the first. There was a frozen moment until Sherlock’s nervous system caught up to the stimulus. “Aah! Ah, ah, ah.” John watched as his back, thighs, buttocks, flinched, tightening and releasing, trying somehow to mitigate the maddening burn, but the lessons taught at school had been bred in deep. Lose your position and earn penalty strokes. Sherlock held himself in place, but for the squeezing of his hands and tensing of his muscles.
Sherlock’s breath stuttered and he bucked his hips up off the mattress. John seized the opportunity to shove a pillow underneath him. The lube was in the bedside table and he grabbed it, flicking the lid up and down because the click of it made Sherlock positively wriggle. John chuckled again.
“John, please. Please.”
“Or?”
Sherlock muttered, “Humiliating.”
“I heard you were here. Nice to meet you. Though I must say, he hasn’t told us much about you.” He called over to Sherlock, “Keeping secrets, are you Featherweight?”
“Come on back to the bedroom. I want to do some maintenance on you. It’ll be easier if you’re lying flat.” Sherlock allowed himself to be pulled into the bedroom and laid down on the duvet. He rested his hands on his folded arms. “You can lower your pants for me.”
Sherlock wriggled in frustration, “You said I was in charge, John, and I’m telling you to let me loose.”
Sherlock pulled off and ogled up at him. “Doctor’s orders. Not allowed yet.” He took his hand off John and stroked himself with a few slow pulls. Not to leave John neglected, he dropped his head as far as it would go and let John fill his mouth and throat. He gasped and looked down to try to get a glimpse, but Sherlock’s head was in the way.
John ducked underneath his arms and pulled Sherlock’s head down to whisper fiercely in his ear. “I’ll hug you whenever I damn well please, you bloody, gorgeous thing,” and did exactly that. The ruddy, pink glow on Sherlock’s cheeks flared red and he tucked his head down in pleased embarrassment. John stepped back and said, “That…was amazing. As usual.”
John leaned back from the hug and raised his eyebrows at him.
“It was my fault,” he choked out, the tears dripping onto John’s jumper as he stroked Sherlock’s hair and tried to soothe him.  “I made her cry,” he stuttered and gasped, “even though she’s always only ever been kind to me.”
“No need. Thank Molly when you see her.” Sherlock took a deep shuddering sigh and carefully maneuvered himself off John’s lap. In a slightly nervous voice he asked, “Are you still going to…take care of my…me?”  almost as if he weren’t sure it was worth a reprieve from spanking if it meant he wouldn’t be cuddled afterwards.
When he reached bottom, John sighed the deep satisfaction of a man who’d reached the end of a long journey. “Yeah… oh yeah… oh yeah…”* He stood and looked down, enjoying the view of himself, buried balls deep in Sherlock, his white arse gleaming beside the shining black leather and rich grey wool of the Belstaff. His rim was stretched, pink and drawn thin by John’s girth. He gripped Sherlock’s hips and held still, just tightening the muscles of his hips, thighs and pelvis, savoring the thrum of blood in his veins and the grasping of Sherlock around him.
She smiled, knowingly. “You love ‘em, but they’ll drive you mad.”
Success. The body was turning on and the brain was shutting down. John climbed on to the mattress and settled between his legs. “Oh, but you’re wrong. You weren’t listening,” he sing-songed. Sherlock giggled out loud, then said in mock frustration, “What? What is it?”
“I was careful, Sherlock. I knew minefields before I ever got near a warzone. I never needed to be rescued from anything, but you know who did? Harry. Over and over again. Drunk and stuck, drunk and lost, drunk and beat up, drunk and in lockup. Even after she left home, she would still call me wanting me to bail her out. And I did,” he admitted bitterly.
Sherlock glared at him, refusing to concede. “I’m not giving up. I’ll go layer by layer.” The ribbon slipped off with a tug. He examined it fruitlessly. The doily was next and he rubbed it between his thumb and forefinger. Nothing. He turned the package upside down and delicately peeled the sellotape off, testing the adhesiveness and clarity of it. The paper was as non-descript as everything else. The box itself was white and featureless. John laughed at his irritation and Sherlock frowned and opened it. He peeled away the tissue and just stared.
“Quick dinner.”
Sherlock echoed John’s bitterness and said, “We had that in common, at least.”
Sherlock’s brain reengaged.
John took a deep breath and squared his shoulders up. “You’re welcome.” Now he was the one pacing, talking himself up.
A week ago, when John dragged Sherlock to the pub for a pint with Greg, the pint had turned into 3 or 4 and somehow the conversation turned to the reputation of a certain Captain “Three Continents” Watson and the upcoming Valentine’s Day Weekend. Greg had pressed him for his most adventurous episodes but as the level of intoxication increased, the quality of the discourse degenerated. By the end of the evening they were trying to outdo each other with unbelievable tales of debauchery. The topic that finally broke up the evening was bondage. Whips and chains, to be specific. Sherlock’s look of horror and disgust sent the revelers into hysterical laughter and when John finally snorted lager out of his nose, it was clearly time to go home. Greg’s parting shot had been a hearty Happy Valentine’s Day to John. “Don’t turn your back on him, Sherlock. Your baby’ll have you locked up in chains before you’ve got your trousers off!”
Irritated, John checked the door and said, “Well, hurry up about it, then.”
John tested his stroke, bringing the cane down gently in the place he intended to land. It would not do to be careless. He was determined not to double up on any of the blows, and it would require careful aim to lay them parallel to one another. He hoped to keep from leaving welts that would bruise, mindful that there was still one more day of punishment to go.
He said, “Not necessary,” as he moved toward the bed. Without a word he removed his robe and lay down. The overall pink and red was fading a bit, John thought, but the purple bruises and welts would be hard for Sherlock to ignore. John gave a concerned hum and Sherlock looked around. “What, worse?”
“Time to wake up, Sherlock.” A few pokes in the side of his chest.
Sherlock scowled at John, then the sandwich. “Does this have—”
John could see her tilting her chin down, pouting a bit. He rubbled his forehead, then set his lips, determined. “I can’t have you undermining me, Mrs. Hudson. It’s hard enough staying firm with him. If you’d like to take over again, you’re more—“
They walked together into the bedroom and John opened the wardrobe doors. “I’m thinking… sweat pants?” Sherlock snorted. “Pyjama bottoms?”
John got up to pace. His hand was shaking and he kept clenching, trying to still it.
To John, Mycroft said, “I gave him parole. He didn’t last a week.” He turned back to Sherlock, “Would you say that the facilities were similar in their failure to keep to best practices?”
He growled and pulled Sherlock off of him. He pulled his bottoms up far enough to allow him to move and with the disguised strength in his compact form, he lifted him up from under his thighs and slammed his arse on the table. They both heard in the far distance, an ominous creak, but could no more have heeded it than they could have a bumblebee buzzing its wings in Birmingham. Or was it Brazil?
“One whole. WITH butter and jam.”
“You have forced me to repeat myself. What did Mycroft do when he found out you were missing?”
If you enjoy the work of this humble scribbler, please leave a comment. They make me ridiculously happy and eager to write the next chapter.
Sherlock whipped around and hissed at him, “Enough! I’m sure John is capable of drawing conclusions regarding the emotional implications involved without assistance, Mycroft. Especially from you.” Mycroft, nodded and with respectful discretion, looked away. John recognized the blush rising up Sherlock’s neck. He squirmed and looked at him. He forced himself to continue. “John. Please. You can’t be romantic about this. You are the sturdiest. Don’t let me manipulate you the way I have everyone else. You are stubborn and unrelenting, mulish to be honest, and that’s why I can trust you.”
John didn’t want to let the vulnerable moment pass. He took his hand and asked, “Why is it so difficult for you to use the words?”
He kept his question simple. “Will you remind yourself of that in the future before you decide to ignore the rules we’ve agreed on to keep you safe?” John knew that he wouldn’t be able to answer anymore, his breaths shuddering in and out rapidly between the sobs and he accepted the quiver of Sherlock’s head as a yes.
John froze and stared at his oblivious genius for a moment, then muttered “Come on, come on,” glancing frantically between the numbers above the lift and the door to the stairs.
“Good idea.”
“Remember, we have to give our statements, too, Sherlock.”
Angelo frowned at John. “You let him do the work by himself?”
“Course not. I’m not going to give him an inch. I’ll find somebody. Worst case scenario, I’ll bring him with me.” He was glad Molly couldn’t see him wince. The last time Sherlock had come to the surgery, 3 patients had left in tears and they’d had to stay after hours to clean the walls of the results of his experiment (“I’m on the verge of a major discovery, John. You should be thanking me, not tallying up demerits.”) Maybe he could hire someone…
John looked in Sherlock's direction and thought,
John looked down, ashamed of himself. Target locked on. Sherlock evaluated. “Perhaps I’ve failed in providing evidence of my devotion to you. I shall endeavour to more effectively demonstrate my affection, moving forward.” He sighed, sadly.
Sherlock was smug now. “Not only did I come up with a plan, it will be implemented this evening.”
“Seems appropriate. Stiff upper lip, chap, and all that.”
John interrupted, “Yes, all true, no doubt, but I’ve already gotten you a gift and since I don’t want chocolate or flowers, I’ve figured out what you can give me. And you won’t have to do a thing.”
Sherlock shook his head as the memory of his current status returned. “Why are you being nice to me? I’m in disgrace.”
Furthermore, you have presented me with unsolvable riddles. How could you possibly feel love for a person who causes you sadness and fear? I recommend that you abandon me at once. But you have promised that you will not; therefore I know, being who you are, that you will not. You are a dreadful fool and I pity you. If I were strong enough, I would abandon you to save you from your reckless and self-destructive obsession with me, and yet, the very feelings that you have inflicted upon me will not permit me to any longer. You have only yourself to blame that I can no longer disregard your pain, and so I must remain by your side, you self-sacrificing idiot.
Sherlock looked at John and said, “Raul looks like a baby himself, but he’s got 3 boys at home.” He walked over to his locker and took out some notes, which he handed to Raul, saying, “Give my regards to Yvette.”
“What does that tell you about your brother, that without a moment’s hesitation, he is willing to use all of the considerable resources at his disposal, to try and keep you from hurting yourself?"
“God, I think I like you better morose.”
“So, without snark this time, why did Mycroft send out helicopters and MI6 agents to look for you?”
John gave him a bland look, which, of course, increased Sherlock’s frustration exponentially. “Why are you so intent on civilizing me? Making me human or sentimental or soft or something?”
John said, “You are gorgeous.” He walked around the bed slowly, with the spool in his hand and looked him over. Sherlock followed him with his eyes, his limbs in constant restrained motion. “Are you ok?”
“Is that any way to speak to the man who’s making you breakfast? Come on, you lazy git, wake up.”
Inside was a tiny spool of golden thread. He looked quizzically at John, who licked his lips and said, “Unwind some. Feel it? It’s real spider silk. It’s almost transparent.” He took the spool back and unwound some of the thread. He held it up to the candlelight. “It’s stronger than steel, isn’t it?” Sherlock nodded. John snapped off a short length. “But in this thickness, it’s no match for a full-grown man. You couldn’t use it as a…oh, let’s say…” he looked up at Sherlock and licked his lips again, “a chain, for example. At least not the kind that you can see.” He gave the thread back and Sherlock ran his finger along a stretch of it, breathing shallowly through his open mouth.
Should he say something else?
She makes eyes at Janine. Sherlock says it's a rather good match. John makes Sherlock promise nothing happened between him and her. Sherlock reminds John that he is 100% gay and as soon as their sex holiday begins he will remind him of that fact in as many ways and positions possible.
Sherlock comes in the kitchen still looking sleepy but also fully dressed. Despite the fact that he's wearing the clothes from a day before he looks immaculate.
“Protect that heart of yours.”
John turns his head to look at Sherlock. Sherlock sees the question in his eye, but waits for him to speak.
John: Not really.
John not only hears it but he feels Sherlock’s lips move against his as they both try to come up with reasons why they should stop.
"I knew when Mike brought you in the lab that day. And then over dinner at Angelos.  I know when you showed up after I said danger. When you shot a man for me.  Half a dozens of times after that of course.  I completely knew when I had to leave and play dead. When I came back and when you got married. John, I've known I was in love with you for some time now.”
“Yes.”
Sherlock: Me too.
"Simply advising them would not entail explaining to each person on scene why they were all idiots and why they'll always be failures in life."
John puts the cards away, turns the tv off. He pulls down the covers and slips in. Sherlock comes back a second later with two glasses of water in hand and hands one to John who downs it and puts the glass on the small table. Sherlock drinks his as well while holding eye contact with John.
His mother stands and hugs him. His father reaches out a hand and shakes it then pulls Sherlock in for a hug. Sherlock gives a glance back to Mycroft as he’s leaving.
John takes Sherlock's hand and stands up. He only sways a little.
“Yes, and we won’t unless we get access to those archives which means calling your brother.”
She and John visit Mary's grave along with Rosie and Sherlock. They all leave a single rose for her. And bid her a final goodbye.
Sherlock: I liked it, of course.
John nods his head at that. His eyes still say he’s sorry.
Surely that John would come around as well. Doesn't he deserved to know, feel this?
And they made love. He had thought they would just tear each other's clothes off once they had started, but then it turned slow, calm, beautiful. He came blissed out on the love they shared. Well that paired with the expert way Sherlock could touch him and make him need to come within mere moments.
Sherlock watches him curious and John can't help but look away. He wriggles his nose and pretends to be hungry.
Sherlock looks at John, they catch each others eyes and seem to have a conversation.
“Alright?” John asks.
But Sherlock doesn't respond. He can still feel Sherlock sucking him. And Sherlock is kissing down his neck, then chest. But they don't speak and he needs them to say something.
"I'd love to."
“Good,” John said.
John smiles. Still impressed by the fact that Sherlock's genius will allow him to solve a case in a certain amount of time.
John gave a small laugh. “Try what?”
John nods. He stands and takes Sherlock’s hand. He pushes the coat off Sherlock’s shoulders and ushers him to sit. Sherlock does and John in turn sits atop and straddles him. They kiss for hours on the same cushions where they finally spoke their truth. When they’re finally breathless and smiling, John remembers they must pick up Rosie. He stands and offers his hand. Sherlock takes it and they walk to fetch their daughter from Mouse.
“No,” John turns back to look at Sherlock. “I don’t think we do.” John sighs. “What else did you do today?” John bites down on his tongue and doesn’t add ‘who else?’
“I don’t think we really attract the simple ones.”
There is only the light from the outside hitting Sherlock’s cheekbones and angles and John just fuckin wants, can't stop himself. He moves a little closer towards Sherlock who is staring,nearly unblinking at him. Fuck. This isn’t the fuckin right time and yet he can’t stop himself. He clears his throat.
Sherlock takes cautious steps around, as if any minute now John might decide Sherlock wasn't allowed to walk where she walked, touch things she had touched.  The cloud of confusion settles over him even more now that he's here. Mary was his friend and John's wife, but there was always a mystery to her actions. The fact that her last one was to save his life after previously almost ending it is something he still cannot understand.
"Here," Kate calls back to him.
“Yes.” Sherlock agrees quickly and if that isn't a sign that something is wrong then John doesn't know what is, but he won't push. Not when Sherlock has already been through enough. Yes, they both have but today John knows Sherlock needs to be handled with a bit more care.
"For Irene?"
Outside of criminal motivations he isn’t especially well versed in romantic entanglements or relationships and emotion. Sentiment. Yes. He admits it now. It's part of him and as long as he learns to control it, to structure it within his makeup then he should still be able to function as normal. He will still have the cases and maybe he will also have this.
In the corner of the room he sees Sherlock's dressing gown. Then he looks and sees Sherlock's dressing gown. Fine. Normal. Three sets of slippers sit next to each other. They're lined up by who left the shower last. John's ,of course, was first. Sherlock's was next and then Sherlock's of course was last.
They scream.
John smiles and looks into Sherlock’s eyes then speaks.  "Whatever happened to being 'married to your work'?"
Apologies for the long delay. I hope you enjoy the chapter. This work is now complete. Thank you.
John appears only startled for half a second before he returns the embrace while holding onto the spatula. Sherlock feels no tension in his hug and it’s entirely different from the last time, though there is still the ever present thought that he is allowing himself this, taking and giving all at the same.
“Sorry.” John says. He doesn’t elaborate beyond that. Sherlock is both grateful and frustrated. There is still a conversation to be had. He knows what it’s like when they hide things from each other. It never ends well. No matter which side it’s on.
“Ahh,” John says. “That’s not too long.”
John pulled him in by his scarf and kissed him. And it wasn't a mistake this time. He pulled back after long minutes.
Indecipherable words tumble out of John's mouth as he sits straight up in bed. He gasps for air. Breathing as much as his lungs can take. He tries to calm himself by focusing on anything but this feeling.
Sherlock turns away. John knows he is annoyed that John realized Sherlock is working on the list of top ten unsolved crimes in England. John also knows the act of a desperate man when he sees one.
John pulled his head down and kissed his forehead. He wiped his face with the flannel and said, “Of course I am. Git. Now lay down.” The bruising on Sherlock’s arse had faded and the doctor in John regretted having to bring it back up tomorrow, but was pleased that his ministrations had succeeded. Sherlock didn’t react as strongly to the application of the gel and sighed in contentment. Or as close as he could get with a sore arse and two more spankings to go.
“And…happy?”
John pushed him, keeping him off balance, to the foot of the stairs, then pressed his advantage, manhandling him up each step and pinning him against the door where he once again fiddled with the knob. Sherlock stumbled backwards, dizzy from John’s intensity and kept upright only by the death-grip on his bum. When he was certain Sherlock was stable, John let go and Sherlock stepped back. They were both winded. Breathlessly, John whispered, “Strip. Now.”
He rose off Sherlock’s back and came around on his side and pulled him up to standing. John reached for his jacket and searched the pockets for tissues. He gave a handful to Sherlock and then took a closer look at the jacket. He held it away from him in disgust “Ugh. This is going to have to go to the cleaners.” He wiped at the smears with some more tissues. The temperature had dropped and he was going to need it. Sherlock was still standing, tissues in hand when John turned back around and John laughed at his faraway expression. “Need a hand?”
“Hmph.” John translated, “I don’t care,” and so he opened it.
Ballet.
Sherlock muttered under his breath and John said, “What was that?” knowing he wouldn’t get an answer. “Nothing.” He smiled and set the timer for 23 minutes, just to irritate him in case he counted down anyway. He started out strong, 8 minutes but then a few twitches. John gave him a few seconds to see if he would stop by himself, but then said, “Sherlock.” He startled a bit and then stretched his fingers out along the outside of his thighs with renewed determination.
Sherlock was lying on the bed with his chin propped up on his folded hands. John looked at him with surprise.
“No you don’t, Mrs. H. I’ll not have you putting me in a better mood before I’ve made my point. Maybe on the way down.”
The dam that held back Sherlock’s sentiment burst. He heaved noisily, weeping in heartfelt remorse. John rubbed his back, saying nothing, not wanting to interrupt the moment of clarity. When the crying was less harsh, John pulled him back and helped him turn and perch on his legs. He leaned back in the chair so that there was room for Sherlock to rest his head on John’s shoulder. He took the flannel from his pocket and turned Sherlock’s face to wipe the tears and mucus off his face. Sherlock pushed his hand away but John grasped his chin and drove the lesson home.
“Sherlock…Sherlock, don’t…yes, yes, come, I’m…gonna…”
Mycroft continued, unimpressed. “Five facilities. What has been your longest period of abstention?”
Anyway, you’ll figure out what to tell him. He’ll listen to you.
Sherlock lifted an eyebrow at him and quoted his elder brother. “Is that sentiment talking?”
On his way to the loo, he grabbed his robe.
John smiled slowly, and said, “Very sensible. What’s it been, a few days? Skill levels have to be maintained. You’ve got to keep your hand in.”
“Can’t you carry me?”
I want to thank all of you who have commented so far. It's beyond encouraging. Most of all, a humongous, ginormous, crate-load of thanks to tiaoconnell for her above and beyond support. And being a beta! All hail tiaoconnell!
“Raul, the masseuse, has—“
At six, Mrs Hudson called out, “Ooh-hoo, boys. Can I pop up for a second? I have a Valentine’s Day thank you for you.” She appeared with a heart-shaped chocolate cake and John gave her a peck on the cheek, while Sherlock scowled. She ignored it and pulled him down for a kiss on the forehead. “It was so sweet of you to get me those tickets. I haven’t seen them in ages! And of course it means that you’ll be free to enjoy yourselves this evening as well. I hope you have plans.” She gave Sherlock a cheeky smile and he blushed instantly.
John was tremendously pleased. He beamed at him. “Seven. Seven options. I’m so bloody proud of you Sherlock. This is why you’re going to be successful this time around. You have options and a support system. You don’t have to try to fix everything by yourself. You’re not alone anymore. Come here.” Sherlock came, bashful and blushing, and John took his head between his hands, tilting his forehead down to give him a kiss.
“Who?”
John licked his lips and relaxed his shoulders. Target acquired. Of course, Sherlock was telling only a partial truth. He’d found some of her proclivities thoroughly intriguing. He pouted as a diversionary tactic. “I’m somewhat disappointed that you are still threatened by a,” he waved his hand around vaguely and made a mental note to encrypt The Woman’s contact info on his mobile, “non-entity who was never any threat to your complete possession of my heart. And other… assorted parts.”
John let it pass.
John smiled at him and kept on. “But the brain is complicated. It gets confused. Look at me. I hated Afghanistan, it almost killed me. But as soon as I was safe, I was bored to death. I missed the violence of it so much, I hooked myself to you and your danger and chaos. Ella says sometimes we seek out what we fear to try and conquer it. And surviving it, taking control over it, beating the fear, no matter what it is, triggers pleasure. Different kinds of course, for different people, but for some of us—them, it’s sexual.”
“Yes, right. My question is, that is, I don’t understand. Out of all the kinks we were talking about, what is it about bondage that gives you such a squick?”
Good old Molly he thought, and punched her up on speed dial. She picked up the phone and, knowing there could be only one reason for a call at that time, she started speaking immediately. “Sorry. I’m so sorry, John, I would, you know I would, but we have medical students coming and I have to show them around the lab and give a talk and answer questions and I just can’t have him deducing them and telling which one is going to drop out and who’s sleeping with the professor and correcting me and—”, he cut her off.
John blushed a bit. “Prat.”
He had reached Sherlock by then, grabbed his wrist and twisted his elbow up behind him. Fleetingly, he considered looking for handcuffs, but hearing sirens approach, he decided that a rapid exit was Sherlock’s best hope for arriving home intact, where John alone could be the one to tear him to pieces. He pushed Sherlock in front of him towards the lift, calculating that Lestrade’s adrenaline would send him up the stairs as it had John. As he pressed the button he heard brakes shrieking and the sirens cut off.
B. I regret the distractions caused by my less than adequate regard for my own physical safety and well-being.
John cut her off. “Stop it Molly, right now. If you blame yourself, we all have to blame ourselves. Do you think it’s my fault? Or Greg’s fault? Whose fault is it?”
Before he woke him, he’d have to find someone to take over. He didn’t want Sherlock trying to cope with the uncertainty of not knowing where he’d spend the day on top of having to spend it with somebody else. John leaned forward on the table with his head hanging down and braced himself for the hunt.
Sherlock seemed incapable of initiating any movement, so John turned him round by his shoulders and gave him a shove.
“Oh, right. That’s…good. Right, John? Good?”
Sherlock looked up and said, “What are you muttering about?”
When he was finished, he took his coat off the hook and for a moment he looked at it thoughtfully. “Where’s your kilt, John?”
“Smart mouth for a man with a smarting arse,” and he gave him a pinch, just to see him flinch. “If you behave yourself, I’ll let you play with my stethoscope this evening.” Sherlock turned around, spatula in hand and proudly displayed the admirable tent in his black silk boxers. He growled in a register that made the teaspoons rattle. “I’ll show you mine, if you show me yours.” John understandably lost focus for a moment, staring at the impressive display and licking his bottom lip. He couldn’t stop himself from cupping Sherlock’s bollocks and running his cupped hand up the rigid length. Sherlock’s head dropped back with a moan and he dropped the spatula, jarring both of them out of their lust-driven stupor. John stepped back and shook his head. In a hoarse whisper he said, “I’m going to take a shower.” Time for another wank. He turned back once and hollered, pointing his finger at him. “And don’t interrupt me this time. Or I’ll…do something.” He fled.
Sherlock opened his eyes and John marveled at the openness and vulnerability of his expression. John picked up his legs and hung them over his shoulders. He looked down at the spot where he and Sherlock were joined together and said, “Hold on tight, love.”
“Luckily, we have spares. Pillows, not me.”
Though he should have been thrumming with the excitement of tying up the loose ends of a case, Sherlock was unusually quiet. When they arrived at Bart’s, he looked at John, lost. He opened his mouth, then shut it again. He looked away. John pulled him by the cuff of his coat round to the rubbish skips where it was quieter. “What is it?”
It was like spanking an attorney for the defense.
They ate dinner.
"Oh, that one. Obviously a marketing scheme, a campaign to delude the rabble into spending money they would be far better off investing. Instead they’re drawn into a futile attempt to prove their worth as a sexual—“
“That’s right. Good boy.” Sherlock gave the tiniest of gasps and his eyes opened the tiniest bit wider, which John noted with interest. “Will I be upset?”
Sherlock inhaled sharply and counted, “One.”
Sherlock gasped out, “Aah, aah, that hurts! Because you told her I was missing. Because she was worried.”
“Obviously, I’ve been asking for
“A submarine maybe?” John added hopefully.
John nodded. “I think he’ll be satisfied. I am.”
John gave as good as he got. “Hmm.” But he smiled wickedly as he removed the petri dish of tarantula bits from the crisper and binned it.
Sherlock was panting. “We don’t need it.”
Sherlock caught his breath and said, “On the contrary. You’re an overachiever. As usual. I don’t want to finish like this and I don’t want to finish too soon.”
They breathed for a bit and John asked, “Now, should we stop at your arms or do your legs too?”
Molly replied, “Of course not,” and that was the end of that.
“Because I frightened you.”
Kasseem stuck the towel out to Sherlock and turned round toward John,
The security officer at the front desk was startled to see John racing in, and yelled, “He’s not here!”
“John, I assure you, I am here.” he cleared his throat again, “I…I never left the room. I swear it.”
“Berk, I couldn’t take my eyes off you out there and I’m sorry I haven’t come sooner. But hurry anyway. I’m…hungry.”
John rumbled, “Now. Now.” He grabbed the lapels of the coat and dragged Sherlock to the steps. He took off his own jacket and laid it on the top step, trying to cover the concrete to spare the tender expanse of Sherlock’s pale chest. There were already pink scrapes on him from the gloves that had hit him during the bout and John wasn’t planning on being gentle. Sherlock had been goading him all night and had had a goal in mind: it wasn’t lovemaking. The least he could do was spare his skin. He stepped back to release his rock hard cock and Sherlock pushed past him to stand in front of the steps. The coat began to slip off his shoulders as he grabbed the lapels to remove it.
“No! No, Sherlock, it…never mind. I’m not clever enough to explain it to you. So, scale of 1-10? She didn’t actually cry.”
His body reacting, despite the preparation, John sucked in a breath and arched his back, pushing forward to meet him. He opened his eyes wide, pupils black and locked eyes with Sherlock. He held still, suspended, then dropped back, sighing in pleasure and relief. Sherlock grinned victoriously, happy he’d taken his time. He savoured the liquid heat surrounding him. His John, gripping him, enveloping him in sweet friction. He pulled back and John moaned at the emptiness left behind. “Again, hurry. Feels good, Sherlock, go on.”
John laughed back at him and took off the last sock and dangled it over his bum, tickling his skin, just to hear him continue laughing. “All right. Naked. I’m ready now.” John rummaged around for the lube then carefully stilled himself and snicked the lid up, so the sound was clear and distinct. In a somewhat Pavlovian response, Sherlock shuddered and John enjoyed it immensely. He did not feel the slightest bit uncomfortable about his base manipulation. “I’m more than ready. I’m hungry.” On those gorgeous sit spots, John nibbled, tiny little nips that had Sherlock unsure about whether to twist closer or further away. It didn’t matter because every move created friction that ramped up the fever rising below his waist. John held his rigid cock and teased the head up from the base of Sherlock’s bollocks to the top of his cleft. Sherlock’s giggles were groans now and he followed John’s progress with his arse, trying to wiggle himself into position.
Indignation in his tone, he said, “Really, John. It’s not that unbelievable, is it? I do make you breakfast on occasion. Periodically. Sporadically.” As soon as he put the tray on the night table, John grabbed him and pulled him on top of him. Sherlock put up half-hearted resistance.
Run your fingers through my hair
He heard Greg’s patrol car door slam. “No worries on that. The helicopters are already deployed, damn it. Buggering FUCK! I’m gonna kill him. This time I’m really gonna kill him.”
“More ridiculous sentiment, John? It’s tiresome and will distract me from—”
Sherlock pulled away and a string of saliva and pre-come stretched from his lower lip to the tip of his John’s cock. Sherlock tried to lick it off, then used his index finger to swipe it away. He stared up at John with smoldering eyes and licked it off. John was hypnotized with lust. He stared, mouth open at the sight. It was obscene in the most delicious way imaginable.
“He didn’t!” Sherlock took a step forward with his fists clenched. John frowned at him. He began to spindle the letter, rolling and unrolling it. He tightened his lips and Sherlock retreated. “He didn’t. He didn’t realize…I didn’t know…” He paused and with more assurance, said, “It was new data. Without precedent. It was a successful experiment, with unexpected results, no one’s fault.” He pouted.
John sighed and said, “I’ve created a monster. Or a new level of monster.” Sherlock grinned and kept playing his imaginary violin.
John tried to take hold of himself but Sherlock grabbed his wrist and place his hand back on the bed. He leaned over John’s back and said, “This time, it’s my turn. Please?” He dragged the tips of his fingers lightly over the skin of John’s arms, tickling over his ribs, across his belly and then wrapping his fingers around his cock gently himself, still pushing in and out, but now giving his finger a little twist. The double stimulus brought out a gasp from John.
John said, “All we need to do is pop the trays into the microwave. I still need to get dressed. You can do it.” He cut off Sherlock’s protest, “NOT as a punishment, just to keep you from getting bored while you wait for me to get dressed.”
“Here, let me see.”
“Naah, really, he’s a welterweight, where he should be now, thank god, but there have been times he hasn’t been able make weight for a bout. Forget about the days you could have knocked him over with a feather. The nickname stuck though.” Mickey shook his head. “The bad old days.”
John remained impassive. “Well, what?”
John tried to drop the trousers onto the bed, but he missed and was forced to look away from Sherlock again. “Got it. Got it.” When he looked back, Sherlock’s left hand was cupping his bollocks and gently rolling them back and forth.
“Sherlock, wouldn’t you rather take a shower at home?”
As Sherlock opened the button on his trousers, John realized he’d been a fool. No pants were definitely better. It meant he got to see Sherlock’s cock poke its gorgeous head out that much sooner. His tongue traveled round inside his lips seeking some moisture then snuck out when it came up dry. Sherlock was paying very close attention to his zipper but John called his name, the better to see the flush moving up from his chest. He lifted his head but closed his eyes. John wouldn’t have it. “Look at me. I want to see you. I want you to see what you do to me. How much I want you.”
John hated to do it, but he insisted on a pair of pants. “I can’t have you flashing your bits at me all day. You’re going to test my will power enough as it is.” He helped Sherlock step into the lightest satiny pair that they kept especially for just such occasions; Sherlock still gripped John’s shoulders tightly when they settled on his skin.
John wordlessly switched the cane to his right hand and gave him a slap on his left cheek, trying to avoid the raised tracks, but not too hard.
John stumbled over his words. “But, but, you’ve obviously taken the lesson to heart, right? If you’ll forgive the expression. The punishment has…succeeded! Why would we need, or why would you want to continue?”
As soon as he was steady, John pushed gently again, enjoying the rise and fall of Sherlock’s tension. When his finger finally broke through, Sherlock groaned and John could feel him trying to relax around him. The slide of two inches of finger seemed so arousing, John kept it up for a while enjoying the view of his finger disappearing and reappearing, accompanied by the changes in Sherlock’s breathing. His anticipation built and Sherlock was ready for the next step, so he felt around for the lube bottle and dripped it down where his fingers had been a few moments earlier. He coated his fingers and went back to sliding, only adding a second finger when the first slid in unimpeded by the clenching of Sherlock’s arsehole, which had suffered from what they both considered to be neglect.
Shit. Whenever John was in charge, Sherlock considered it a day free from odious tasks like waking up, going outside and the other mundane activities, to which the ordinary human was subject. And he was right. They had talked about it last night. John always prepared Sherlock for the coming day. He did not handle surprises well (unless it was a new case), which was why John was hoping to move him closer to his pliant, sated, obedient self before he had to break the news to him. Shit. Oh well. Best laid plans, into the breach and all that. John rolled off of him and propped his head up, leaning on his elbow.
Sherlock stretched up his neck trying to feel John’s breath, but he was too quick for him and John took a step back. Sherlock reached out his hand, but John tsk’ed at him, “That’s cheating. Hands down.” Sherlock giggled the tiniest bit and gripped the pillow.
“Deep breaths, Sherlock. You’re going to hyperventilate and pass out before I even get started. Breathe with me. In and out.”
There was a period of silence that John was not pleased with and he brought the cane down, lower yet again, getting closer to the sensitive skin over Sherlock’s sit spots, without him having answered. He was clearly unprepared and let out a yelp that ruined his attempts at stoicism. “Ow-ow-ow-ow-he-he worries about me?”
He turned to Sherlock. “I cannot, nor would I rescue you from this peril and so, good luck, brother mine.” And then he quietly echoed Mrs. Hudson as he closed the door behind him. “You’ll need it.”
Sherlock looked up at where it was tied and started to increase the pressure of his pull until it was taut. He looked at John, who said, “Go on. Break it.” Sherlock looked back and gave it a tug and it broke. An infant could snap it. He looked at John and nodded.
“No reason to. Didn’t care what anybody thought of me before. Other people’s opinions were irrelevant.”
B. You are a better brother now than I will ever be willing to acknowledge.
John smiled warmly at him and stroked the hair from his forehead. “What’s rule number two?”
May I pass on assurances of forgiveness?—JW
“It’s supposed to. Now let me get the gel.”
Sherlock was writhing, twisting his arse into the sheet in frustration at not being able to touch John, touch himself, touch something. Struggling to bring in enough air to form the words, he said, “Good. Take your bloody clothes off already.”
“No, leave it on,” John ordered him. Sherlock obeyed and looked over his shoulder at him. He tilted up his chin and lay himself slowly over the spread-out jacket, head turning to the side on his crossed arms. John took another look toward the street and then moved on him, sweeping the coat to one side, over Sherlock’s hip. With one arm he grabbed him around the waist, using the other to rub the bit of skin on the inside of his thighs that was left exposed by the leather of the chaps. The back of his hand nudged up against Sherlock’s bollocks and he spread his legs wider, hoping to give John more access.
The Woman nodded, reminded of the horrors. "I felt it all. All of the loneliness and anger captured and compressed inside one mind, as endless as the sea. But while his rage is something he shares with one Sebastian Moran, his sadness is neither expressible nor to be buried. It is too infinite to be understood.
"Wiggins mentioned to me that you used to take cocaine together."
They had found his body and woken it, breathed the life back into it. They had freed his trapped soul and brought it back home. They had found his missing heart and linked it to another. Pounding wildly, happy to be alive again. Never to be alone again, making two hearts into one.
The salty taste of pre-cum floods his mouth and he absolutely loves it, hollows his cheeks around him, harder, just a bit more to-
They all turned their heads and they, too, like Mrs Hudson, now appeared to notice John for the first time. Surely, he could not be
Sherlock wiped a tear from John's cheek. He hadn't even realised he was losing tears, after he stopped trying so hard to keep them in.
He let the gun sink abruptly, but he didn't know how to feel. Seeing him again made his heart pound harder in his chest, made something bloom around his core. He thought he might have lost him. But at the same time, he felt shame. He felt like a disappointment. He should have protected him, he should have brought him to safety. All of him.
huge. The affirmation of his wet dreams and deductions (no one walks like that if they don't also have... you know) makes his cock jump with excitement and uncontrollable arousal. It intensifies, even, as he thinks about why he is allowed to know this now.
Only now that he had the peace and quiet of a cab ride alone, he realised that he had not asked a lot of questions any rational man would have asked after being called
John is properly dressed by now, at least. As opposed to Sherlock himself, who is still naked and partly wet, which he gets reminded of again as a mild breeze, caused through the now open door, cools the skin around his legs.
John tilts his head in mutual amusement. "Yes?"
"We are
He gave Sherlock the white bird mask, and he looked back at him in confusion.
Irene held out her hand for him to take and her smile broadened. "Nice to meet you. Dr Watson, I believe?"
"Oh!" is what John has to say when the tip of his head disappears inside of him. He can feel it throbbing to the rhythm of his heartbeat. He thinks. He hopes. He hopes it can feel like they're not two people at all but one, someday. He knows he doesn't make sense and decides to not give the slightest fuck about it. (Perhaps not the best way of saying he doesn't care, given his current situation.)
"Very pleased to meet you." The man poured them two glasses of wine and left the bottle on the table. It looked expensive, and John began to worry a little. He didn't have that much money on him, or rather generally, to pay for expensive.
John gave a laugh, an actual laugh, as he realised just how ridiculous this conversation was becoming.
He cannot make a wish. He does not want to make a wish, he would throw away his thousand wishes, because the one thing he really wants will never come true. Sherlock looks like a broken man. A broken man left alone in a dark alley. Beneath heaven's tent, shooting stars, next to the man he loves. He stares at him in a way a widow would look at her dead husband's coffin at a funeral, he looks as though John Watson had died right in front of him, in the middle of this beautiful night, and it is the most tragic, heartbreaking, metaphorical portray of the mess Sherlock has become.
"This is why I closed the door!"
John only nodded somewhat absentmindedly. Only on second glance, he saw that there were not just the three of them in here.
"After Victor Trevor ... I turned to the cocaine bottle. Thought it might make things easier."
"I've never seen so many at once. Must be some kind of event, or something,“ John says.
Instead, it cried out like a giant kitten, the sound resembling in John's whole body. And then the blood began to spill. Sherlock let go of the sword's handle. It had pierced through the orange fur, the skin and flesh of the tiger, and slid between its ribs like a knife through butter till most of the blade had vanished inside of the animal. Together, he and Sherlock pushed it over and off John's body. Without the armour on it would have crushed some of his bones for sure.
"Vampyres." The word sounded awestruck as it left his mouth.
"Do you?" He asked once more, quieter this time.
"You are amazing," he mumbles.
Sherlock does notice that John has stopped focussing on him, and that he instead keeps his gaze up to the dark blue, the dim clouded sky of the night. Maybe he is watching stars, or something else he himself doesn't know anything about. Although this is not quite true.
They lie together, cuddling and blissed out and fucking happy for the first time in what seems to have taken ages. Sherlock feels a smile stretching across his face. John’s thumb caresses long laugh lines as he is bent over him. But he isn’t smiling back. He looks like something worries him.
Sherlock still feels like he is dying, but it’s different than it was before. John deepens the kiss, and he feels utterly devoured. He’s never wanted anything more, he thinks. Wrapped up in all of him. It fuels his addictive personality in many dangerous ways, but he cannot think, can only indulge in this dance of drawing back only to lean back in again, tongues against each other in one hot wet mess.
John frowned. "No, it doesn't."
"Wait," Sherlock gasped, "He is right. We cannot get there without him."
Sherlock wasn't looking at him, still staring at the door. "You couldn't have considered mentioning that you invited my dearest brother over for a little surprise party, could you?"
John sends
John tried to type it all out, to explain exactly what happened.  But he kept starting and stopping and he imagined Sherlock on the other side seeing those dots start and stopped and he hated himself for that so he finally just wrote what he felt.
"No, you don't."
“Oh,” John says.  He remains silent for a moment then he laughs. And laughs some more. He turns to look at Sherlock who seems thoroughly confused and he can’t help but laugh even more at that. “It’s just.” He laughs more. “I kinda’ figured that out a while ago.”
“Wanna get that light?” John asks and Sherlock does. He reaches over nimbly, gracefully somehow and flicks it off. The t-shirt eases up just a bit revealing Sherlock’s abs and the small patch of hair that trails down to.
John: You didn't deduce the bins at all you cheat.
“Why not?”
He gets ready to leave and as he steps across the threshold he takes a deep breath. His phone pings and he immediately pulls it out. One new message from Sherlock.
Luckily Mouse does not require him for any tedious deeds and lets him go quickly with for a bottle of 1983 Ballblair single malt scotch.  His driver doesn’t say anything and somehow doesn’t need direction as he takes him directly to John’s home.
"Fantastic," John had said. Sherlock at first admonished him but then said it was fine. John noticed then. He absolutely knew at that point. If Sherlock wasn't wearing his coat John was sure that he could look down and see proof that he was right.
He takes another drink, looks over at John, then back down at the bed. If John didn’t know any better he’d say he was nervous and that somehow eases him.
John: Yeah...yeah I have.
John sees this for the clever ruse that it is and he knows Sherlock just wants to hear John tell him he loved him from the start.
“I didn’t…well not at first. But well I thought about things…when you know when she shot you. And there was a drive and blackmail. So I sat down and gave it a good think.”
Ella had told him to close his eyes and focus on a clean white room where the world outside was still, calm, fine. But he couldn't close his eyes right now. No, right now he needed to look around the room and focus on things which meant here and now he was alive and things were okay.
“Nothing,” John says quickly, and tries to focus on his own plate. He takes a bite to divert the attention away. Sherlock mercifully lets it go.
"I'm not a child, John."
And still nothing. Then the exploration of his body stops. He finds he can't open his eyes still. And suddenly he's so tired. He aches for Sherlock. He aches. He needs him. He needs Sherlock. And Sherlock. He needs to wake. But he drifts asleep unsatisfied and alone.
Sherlock pokes him. "You know what I mean."
Sherlock says John is an idiot because John is all Sherlock could ever want.
There were a few things Sherlock had decided in the past few months. One, he’d decided he wasn’t always in control, but even when he wasn’t he had to maintain focus to avoid mistakes. Two, he’d only reveal his hand when he was absolutely sure of the outcome. Three, sometimes he was allowed to go off script but only if it wouldn’t harm anyone but himself. His life was not his own to throw away, but it was his to live.
“Well it won’t work. Lestrade will call.”
He's warring with himself about possibly suggesting it, looking at the sofa and worrying his lip when Sherlock takes off his jacket and then starts unbuttoning his cuffs.
“Mrs. Hudson, you know--.”
Sherlock smiles. “Okay.”
So he left 221B on a cold day in November and didn’t look back.
But as minds are want to do he supplied a very reasonable reason that perhaps Sherlock was doing it as an experiment or for another reason. After all Sherlock kissed Janine and didn't care for her. Sherlock had told him that a few times, explaining that the entire thing was for the case and he truly felt nothing other than a bit of respect for Janine. So he kissed John out of respect? John shook his head and rolled the bin out and placed it securely on the kerb for the next day's pickup. He felt his phone buzz and reached immediately for it.
Then Sherlock moved his right hand to lay on John’s for a moment. The touch shaking John out of his momentary paralysis. He jerked his hand back and handed the phone to Sherlock who had turned his hand over, palm up waiting.
John huffs out a laugh which turns into a groan of frustration.
"And maybe in the morning," Sherlock says.
“It could be her,” John says. Sherlock nods. He doesn't say anything. John isn't sure what he's thinking and he needs to know. “What do you know?”
Sherlock: Apologies.
Today he’ll visit Molly and he wants to pick up Rosie, but knows he’ll need to impose on Molly even more. Mrs. Hudson is staying with her until they assess the damage at 221. They’ve both reassured him that they’re okay with helping for as long as he needs, as often as he wants. He hates that he needs the help, but there are still things to put in order.
The soft leather, the hidden driver, the mysterious presence were always meant to tell a story. A story of power and sophistication paired with a mystery so deep there was never a need to question. But Sherlock always questioned, especially when the evidence seemed obvious.
Sherlock: So you...you did mean to kiss me?
John reaches into the drawer and takes out the remote, turns on the TV. There’s a few different things he could stop on, but Sherlock doesn’t seem interested in any of them. He sits stiff in his corner away from John. He seems uninterested, bored. His fingers seem to twitch towards his phone sat on the bed between them, but he doesn’t reach for it.
Sherlock huffs out a breath in annoyance. “I’m not calling him,” he says. John is well aware of Sherlock’s habits. Making a declaration is Sherlock’s version of digging in, becoming unmovable. John reaches over and takes a last drink, he looks over at Sherlock and decides it’s for his own good really.
Mrs. Hudson was dressed in black. John was as well. And he felt heavy, so very heavy. He wanted to sleep, but he couldn't because a gun was being pointed at Sherlock and Mary was the one holding it. John just needed to find a way back. He needed to go back to days, months, years before.
Before John finishes his third clench and unclench Sherlock nods his head in acquiesce and begins to undress. He turns away from John and takes off the Belstaff first, divests the trousers next. Finally his shirt is unbuttoned and removed   He’s left in his boxers, waits for John to say something. The silence now is deafening, and he only hears his ragged breath.  John says nothing, makes no sound. He walks away and Sherlock slumps down to the bed, waits.
Then with John's free hand he reached out for Sherlock's face, ran his fingers over the man's jawline.
"I know. Just....look this isn't easy for me either."
John sways to the side and laughs at him, looks over at Sherlock still trying to figure it out.
“And you've never lied to me about being injured before have you?” It comes out more biting than he plans. Memories of the first night Sherlock came back running through John’s head. He was only hours back Sherlock had later told him. So he must’ve been hurt that night. The wounds were still fresh and he hadn't said a thing. John had attacked him three times. Unable to let go of his anger, hurt, and shame for not being smart enough to figure it all out earlier. “Sorry.” John takes a step back.
John: :Ahh.
Sherlock suggests the first case where John realised he loved Sherlock.
"Nevertheless what?" Sherlock said unfolding himself from his sulking position on the couch. With his wild hair and wild eyes both at attention Sherlock gave John a look of exasperation coupled with a heavy put-upon sigh. Now was the time. Now when he would do it for Sherlock's own good. He'd use the one thing he always knew worked.
Sherlock’s eyes close and he breathes in this moment. He doesn’t open his eyes, but begins to speak. "I knew a few times. "
“John, I want--.”
"For you really.” She gives a small, sad smile. “She'd sent out a SOS to all her trusted contacts. I wasn't one, but..."
Molly smiles and tells him all the details he does and doesn’t want to hear.
“Oh.” John thinks back to that night and how they finally said it. He smiles. “So you and Lestrade?”
John laughs and kisses him. He uses every tool in his arsenal to make Sherlock feel pleasure and Sherlock somehow finds new spots on John’s body which make him feel like he’s never truly understood what an orgasm was before now. They fall asleep that night and many nights after in their home.
“Good food?”
After a hearty meal John decides to put his plan in motion.
As they fall asleep John tells him about the one time things came close to happening with James Sholto and with a few others, but Sherlock is the first man he's been in love with entirely.
John: And it's a bit ...I dunno. It's a bit like us isn't it? No real conversation, just going forward.
As he searches for the memory of last night other memories rush back to him all at once. The past twenty four hours, hell the past twenty four days. Mary, his wife, is dead. He is a widower.  Their daughter has no mother. Fuck.
"I'll call my brother."
“It makes no sense! You’re saying the diamonds and hearts equal two points, but only if followed by a face card but then double if it’s a Queen and also I can get a second deal of cards if I remember to take a drink after counting to the number of cards in your hand?”
Sherlock opens the door and steps out the car. He looks at the house before him and the many like it on either side.  He finds them all the same, right down to the smallest detail. No one would ever think Irene Adler, former royal mistress and dominatrix to the powerful, could ever be found here on this dreary street full of carbon copies of tedium. And he supposes that's the point.
“Don’t what?” John says then pulls back. He blows a cooling breath then goes back to a delicate suck. His hands moves to Sherlock’s backside, grabbing himself two handfuls of Sherlock.
They say grief is lessening when you smile or laugh a bit more. John can't help but note all those moments have occurred because of Sherlock.
Before he can decide John maneuvers Sherlock closer. He can smell the alcohol present on his breath. It's both sweet and sour and reminds Sherlock of why John may be dreaming more heavily.  John's hands drift south and take in a handful of Sherlock's backside. The grip is incredibly intoxicating to Sherlock and try as he might to stop it. He lets out a small sound of contentment. To be touched by John is something he never felt possible even in the most amazing of circumstances.
"No, you're dancing around the latter. Quit wasting my time. What is it you're hiding?"
John is lying on his back looking up at the ceiling. Sherlock stares at his profile and tries to think, tries to think, tries to think.
“John, please don’t.”
He would say that, but he wouldn't agree with her. He doesn't respond.
“It's fine.”
John laughs. “No, it’s just me wanting to tell you how amazing you are because you are amazing.”  Then he sees it. Sherlock has learned to school his face even more but John’s eyes dip to Sherlock’s hands which are clutching his chair.
John shakes his head a bit as if to disagree. He does feel it a bit more then.
“What’s wrong?” John says. He moves without thinking, sets his mug down, and reaches out to Sherlock’s shoulder which seems to be aching him.
Sherlock takes a step forward. A version of honesty on his tongue ready to save him. "It's just--"
John closes his eyes and breathes. There is an ache still, one he doesn’t know if he’ll ever shake, knows it’s connected to unfinished conversations and unresolved plans. But there has been some growth. It's a small mercy that he doesn't see her like before, but she's still there in his mind, at the edge of his heart. And this is good. It's something he didn't expect. That he’d find that bit of healing so soon.
As John descends the stairs his gait is slow, changed. Somehow there is stress in him that wasn’t there before. Sherlock doesn’t turn towards him. The lights flicker off all around and John walks to him.
"But I would have..." Sherlock stops himself. He doesn't need to say and she doesn't need to know.
John mumbles, “I know.” And he lets himself fall deep into slumber.
At the end of the trail they find themselves in Prague with a gun pointed to John's head and a man demanding Sherlock reveal where Mary was hiding or else he'd pull the trigger. He doesn't believe she's dead and they have unfinished business. Sherlock says he knows nothing, but the man doesn't believe him. The man cocks the gun then Sherlock sees the world stop. He is knocked back and hits his head. Moments later he's come to, but with blood on himself and John.
Sherlock hadn’t made it far down John's driveway before a black sedan pulled next to the kerb. He rolled his eyes, opened the door,  and slid onto the empty backseat. Sitting down with a thump he let out a sigh which he was sure would be ignored. It was.
As Sherlock asks Molly and Mrs. H for more information he begins walking around and listening. He sets John’s phone on the counter and steeples his hands, paces. John continues with the dishes, soaping them up and enjoying this, just this.
With each passing kilometer the stress eased a bit, just a bit. Their unspoken agreement to ride in silence lasting through each turn, change in direction, and new road.  Ever so often they shared a glance toward the other, but never spoke a word.
"But tonight, my dear," John added and fluttered his eyelashes at him, "I'll take you out on that opera date that I promised you." On their last night out they had visited St James's Hall together and my
As he looks down at him, their eyes lock. Sherlock looking up under black lashes, having tears – actual tears! - in his bright blue eyes.
. Simply stared straight ahead, bewitched. John could feel it too, a distinct itching in his fingertips.
Silence. Magnussen didn't move for long moments.
In his youth he might or might not have found himself within the walls of such a building on occasions, throwing the little money he had around, craving for the company of a faceless temptation.
The stones beneath them vibrated as two horses arrived and came to a sharp hold before them. One was Silverblaze with the General on top. So she had made it! She looked smothered in her armour and as she heaved her helmet from her head, her hair was sticking to her forehead and the sweat ran down her temples. Lestrade was on the other horse with Molly seated behind him.
"Of course," he started, but did not sound entirely convinced himself. "I do like... some people."
John had joined the knighthood with a fiancée, planning a marriage. He had left it without one, never to be married at all. The engagement had happened too fast, the bond too weak to bear the weight of his trauma. With her, he felt misunderstood in his sufferings. With him, she felt like she did not mean enough to be forever. She was right. They did not share what he shared with his comrades, did not feel the losses that brought John and them together. And nothing in the world had ever come close to what he shared with James Sholto.
“Me too.”
Sherlock pants audibly and feels instinctively drawn to run his hands through this short, silver hair he admired so much before. Then he stops for a second, dangerously close to coming to his senses.
He picked up the cup again without even looking in its direction, ignoring how hot the tea was that was flowing down his throat in big gulps, and as he placed it onto the saucer again, the porcelain clattered sorely. He had no idea what to make of it all. But he did know that something stronger than tea would certainly help.
John now, how could he look away? – and now John looks like the one who is in pain, speeding up his pace. He is letting go of his throbbing cock, and Sherlock whines in protest, to put his hands on the back of his knees and give more tiny thrusts until he almost hits his prostate.
"Very funny. I was captured and stuck in Moriarty's underground fish chambers. Which you have clearly known about. Sherlock tried to locate his quarters for months! Why have you never reached out?"
"Rifles?"
The short applause returned and died quickly. Moriarty's dark eyes pierced through the crowd to find Sherlock and pin him to the place. The way he looked down at him made John's blood run cold. If he was the spider, Sherlock was his fly.
“You..figured that out?” Sherlock repeats. “How?”
“God why can’t you get this game?” John laughs and giggles and laughs some more. Sherlock is staring down at the cards with the most amazing look of confusion and John loves it.
“Did it happen when you were away?” John asks after long minutes. Sherlock wars between saying the obvious about the scars or explaining how John is forcing him to say the obvious about them. But he’s aware the desire for either is simply a way to avoid the subject. He can't always offer honesty about his life, but in this instance he can.
"Oh God."
Molly and Greg get married.
“Yeah,” he says, but he hears it. Strained voice. Thinks of an excuse. “Have a bit of a migraine. I’ll be out in a minute.”
"Sherlock, What? These questions are supposed to be about us. "
John waited.
With that he walks to the couch. He unfolds a sheet then a blanket. He adds the pillows at the far end. Sherlock doesn’t move.
John: Thanks.
He finished brushing his teeth.
When Sherlock pulls up to John’s home and leaves the engine idling John ends the silence.  He opens the car door without a glance back.
“Yes, she will. Part of her game you know”
“Yes,” John said. They spent the night in with Sherlock telling John about the very first case he and Lestrade solved together.
Once the car stops Sherlock estimates they’ve traveled approximately 11 kilometers. He sends this on to Mycroft as well. It’s not that he thinks Irene would harm him, but he can’t help but wonder about the subterfuge, the timing.
Sherlock said nothing, not a word. So John closed the distance and kissed him.
"Will you join us for dinner, Sherlock?" Sherlock's father asks, but he knows his mother is the true prompter.
John looked at the words without a question mark. It was a statement, of course it was. Because Sherlock was deducing it all now.
"Sherlock." John had said four days after Lestrade said he'd not call for Sherlock's help ever again. "Can you please call Lestrade to apologise?"
“I’m sorry. I really am. I thought I asked. I--I don’t want to force anything on you.” John takes a breath, inches further away creating a wide berth of space between the two. “We um--I’m sorry. I can uh...I can go sleep in my bed if you want.”
