“No” Cas pushes back Dean’s hand, “I knew what I was doing. I would rather live a handful of years as a human, grow old with you and die. Follow you to heaven. Than, spend a million more watching you die and living on without you as an angel. In whatever way you’ll have me.”
“Please” Dean croaked out clawing at Cas’s back, his eyes pressed into Castiel’s shoulder. Noticing how Cas’s chest rose and fell unevenly, as if he were scared. Dean knew why he never let anyone see him like this, but he couldn’t help it.
Castiel lifts his hand to the large metal bunker door, hand clasped in the form of a  knuckle. Ready to knock, he hesitates.
He makes his way back to the living room. Not finding him there either but Sam is. So he waits a while longer sitting on the arm of the couch. But Dean doesn’t come so he mustn’t be in the bathroom either.
“Well come on in” Dean beckons his parents the couple stepping away from the door, “Everyone is already in the living room”
Dean sighed maybe he wouldn’t understand. Just as he didn’t understand the meaning behind the mixtape. Although he might just have chose not to because he didn’t feel the same.
The bracelet snaps around Cas's wrist with a small clink. Falling perfectly on his wrist, not too small or too big, just perfect. Cas jingles it around admiring it warmly, holding the little charm lightly between his fingertips.
Dean looks around at everyone at everyone, each with a smile on their face. Then around at the house, he and Cas built together. A house that is growing, with a new nursery drying upstairs. Everything the two have always hoped for, and never thought they would have.
Though Dean knows it doesn’t help, it doesn’t make up for how he’s treated the angel. Cas seems to relax slightly into the blankets. For a while Dean just stands over him thinking and watching. After a while he leaves the room for a couple of seconds and when he returns, he places a glass of water beside the bed along with a bottle of ibuprofen. He’s not sure what good it will do for an angel of the lord but…
Dean looks up, straightening slightly, and notices Cas step a bit in front of him. Giving Dean a source of comfort though he feels as though Cas is the one who he needs to protect. As of what happened last time. When he looks up he sees John looking directly at him, with an air of regret in the way he stands.
Cas now had tears building in his eyes, both arms still wrapped around Dean’s waist to hold him. Bringing them closer than they ever seemed to be, except on their deathbeds, “Yes Dean. You know I love you. I apologize tha-ump”
There’s a bewildered look on Sam’s face. Dean reaches behind himself. When he pulls his hand back from his lower back. There is a layer of fresh red blood dripping off of it. His brother pales. He blinks. But he already knows. This is it.
“Damn it boy” John cursed slamming his fist on the table, to which Dean jumped “I knew it, I know that gay boy Castiel was no good. This is all his fault.”
"My mom used to tell me angels were watching over me but no I just did an essay on angels and demons a few years back," Dean explained a brief look of sadness when he spoke of his mom told Cas to tread lightly on that subject.
“So” Lucifer rubs his hands together greedily, “I was sent here to retrieve the missing God book and use it on Chuck.”
"That's no fair Dean" Cas pouts crossing his arms over his chest. The frown tugs at Dean's heartstrings but not enough to switch back.
Quickly Dean tears off the wrapping, curious as to what it could be. Cas’s gifts always seem to be the best. Inside is a felt brown cowboy hat, with a little metal horseshoe on the side of the length of the hat.
"yeah it's so fun" Benny one of Dean's friends grumble from across the aisle shifting in his seat "The straw isn't poking up my rear at all"
Michaels says it as if he didn’t mean to say it aloud. The words puckering his expression. Torn between a father whom he was created taught and beaten to serve, and worship no matter the ask or the consequence, and the rebellious nature that Dean knows in his eyes made him no different – no better than Lucifer, The choice to act against the one he dedicated such faith to for so long. Dean could sympathize and understand that which made it all the more crucial to his grasp of what he would do.
"Oh you know we do buddy" Dean may have been more upset about wearing them if Cas's face hadn't been priceless, "Come on"
"Um..." Dean coughed, but didn't make a move to leave Cas's clutches "Yeah. Thanks, sorry about John."
Jack waits for the tale, the reveal of how they are going to end God. He ignores the side banter between the Winchester brothers and Betty, even Dean’s snarky comments he blocks out.
Jack is fury. The wind blowing loose pieces of his bangs, eyes dead set on the man who is intent on breaking everything, he speaks “Just because you created the world doesn’t give you the right to destroy it or do what you want-”
After dinner the fake couple, washes and loads the dishwasher together in harmony. Just as they do back in their dorm, just a bit more touchy than before. Despite Mary’s insistence that they are the guests, and they shouldn’t have to do the dishes.
Dean's heart clenched painfully at the scared expression on Cas's face. He knew he shouldn't have come back. Cas had always been spooked about his makeup, which is why when he saw the collection Cas had a few months ago he hadn't said anything. Cas clearly didn't want Dean to know. He should have known, this was always Cas’s favorite day, Dean didn’t fail to notice the intricate designs he always did for Halloween. Or how he always managed to shoo Dean out of the dorm the passed two years.
Dean hobbled into the bunker’s kitchen putting his crutches to the side to pour a cup of coffee for himself. Relishing the way, the liquid burned down his throat. He smiled as he wrapped the dead man’s robes around himself, god did he love these things.
Dean could imagine that, hell he had spent a Christmas or two like that when Sammy was away at Stanford.
Dean grimaced at the sound of Cas’s voice. Clearly he had been crying, maybe he shouldn’t have left.
Just as Sam opens his mouth to reply, a bang erupts from the entrance of the bunker. The door slamming open. The brothers get to their feet quickly, racing back into the room.
“Whatever” Dean mocks, slinging an arm around Cas which makes him nearly jump in surprise, “Me and Cas are going to go do play without you then.”
“Yeah okay. I don’t care who you date dude . You’re still my brother. That’s not going to change no matter what mom or dad says.” Sam laughed as if his Dean hadn’t just rocked his world. Because he hadn’t it didn’t really matter.
Dean feels Cas's glove clad hand, press against his cheeks. His heart beats faster, leaning into the touch. Like a touch starved boy.
One moment Miracle is sitting there and the next he is disintegrating like a poof of sand snapping from existence.
Instead, he hears another boy yell “Hey!” He snaps his eyes open. Just as an unknown blonde-haired boy tackles Crowley to the ground, another crash into the rocks. He watches with wide eyes as; the two of them squirm around on the ground, the stranger successfully pinning his bully. The next thing Cas sees is the drawing of the boy’s fist back and the deafening crunch of bone when it collides with his bully’s face. The boy yells, “Don’t be mean to him! Stop being a bully!”
Dean steps into Cas’s room bobbing his head to the classic rock music coming from his Walkman. Everything has been calm lately, in the hunting department that is.
Cas’s graces balls at the center of Dean’s palm with a warm touch back to him. Then Dean drops his hand with a sigh.
Icy blue light shoots from the book, three pieces of light and power crashing into the metal bowls. Clanging out, the three pillars of light beamed up into the sky, sparking out over the clouds. Dying out like an assortment of fireworks. The light returns, sucking back into the bowl, bursting them away in all directions, still ringing. The wind whips violently through the trees. The loud ringing of the spell emitting from the bowl dies to a small whisper till it is gone all together.
“It’s funny because I stayed out in the backyard for hours crying over that bird, and yet at her funeral I didn’t shed a single tear.” Cas lets out a chuckle, but his voice is broken, “but you know what Gabe told me today? He told me I was never crying for the bird I was crying for mom.”
”Okay, I definitely will though” Dean joked feeling butterflies rumbling in his stomach. God, he is whipped no matter how he tries to deny it.
“And…” he repeats point back to Betty who just as he says it, thrashes on the floor. Coming back to life, she gets to her knees breathing heavily. Still weighed down by the chains around her.
Mary shook her head again while Sam just gave a sympathetic smile. Dean slowly dared to look at John. He could see it in his eyes the rage the hatred.
Jack flinches nearly jumping out of his own skin but when he looks back, he sees a woman with long brown hair standing. Betty, he figures based on the God book open in her hands, “I have opened the book.”
John smirks, “Likely” he barely breaths under his breath still Dean catches it. He’s sure Cas does to as his jaw tightens, “What boy can’t speak for yourself anymore?”
Dean laughs bumping foreheads with Castiel, "God you'd think you have a whole secret shrine dedicated just to bees. Oh wait, that's just your room..."
“And I thought you were rejecting me dude” Dean shook his head, but happiness still radiated off him. Nothing could ruin his mood right now. “I want to hear  your sweet nothings, and be your romantic valentine, your boyfriend, your lover, and whatever you’ll take me as I want to be it, forever. I love you too, idiot”
The ang- former angel, is staring at his hand in morbid fascination, flexing his fingers. The wound moving with it, gaping open and close. His voice comes out rough, and a little too light, “I’m human now”
"Come on fake boyfriend" Dean cuts off, Winchester boys don't do compliments. (Maybe just Dean Winchester doesn't) He swings open the impala door, walking around to the trunk.
"She is" Mary glared at John, "Here boys, after dinner we are going caroling, wear these. The green one is your Dean and the blue is for Cas"
They end up waiting in silence, machetes at the ready. Outside the house. As the sun sunsets and the darkness covers them. When a large black van pulls up and three skull mask-faced figures get out. Dean chops the head from one, and it falls to the ground with a splat. Blood spraying from his neck, out across the ground. Sam gets the other and the third a bullet straight to the head. Just as suspected vampires.
"Here you are" Melody holds out two cups, giving them an admiring look, "You two remind me of myself and my late husband, he was also very shy. Goodness we were so in love much like the two of you."
Then Michael storms from the room in a manner Cas has seen before. During each of his failures. Even as a cosmic being he had always been the same. Sulking in his shortcomings, preparing, raging anew for a different way.
Michael looks to the ground, with a shameful look written across his face. Though the four of them watch him, he doesn’t meet any of their eyes. Dean watches as he gulps, his only defensive “That was then” The thunder crashes in the distance reminding them just how far Chuck’s wrath has reached. Just as bolt of lightning cracks in the sky Michael looks up again. Directly to Dean, his lips pulled down into a permanent frown, “This is now.”
“Merry Christmas, mom, dad” Sam says while signing at the same time, making it easier for his fiancé to understand. Eileen nods wishing them a Merry Christmas as well.
Then he heard the rumbling of the impala come to a stop on the street in front of him. Dean hopped out taking his boxes and shoving them alongside what Cas expected were his own. Without looking back Cas got in, looking over at the sparkling green eyes beside him.
There was a deep breath across the line, and Castiel played with the lose threads of his tee shirt with trepidation. The movie all but forgotten, pushed into the background like his older brother’s fighting from upstairs and the slamming of the door as Gabriel left probably on another quest to get candy. Finally, Dean spoke “I won’t be able to come over this weekend Jody is out of town, because her ex-husband died, and Donna is taking Owen to his little league game. So, I have to stay with Bobby.”
Every Tuesday and Thursday like clockwork Castiel entered one of Lawrence’s small coffee shops the sign the storefront reading ‘Bobby’s coffee’. Sitting down with his college books splayed out onto the table – accounting 101. The routine he had begun a few weeks back after he started his third year of college. His first year at an actual university studying his major of choice.
“Hell yeah I do” Dean says with a pucker of his lips striking a pose like a ‘real cowboy’, “Thank you Cas”
Once they finish decorating the remaining cookies, Dean leans back with a self satisfied smirk. Hungry for some cinnamon rolls “When is Sammy and Eileen going to be here” Dean asks.
When he turns, he sees it “Woah, woah, look at you” His voice pitches a few octaves higher, as he bends down, “How did Chuck miss you”
Cas tenses his jaw, pushing away from the counter to stand level with John, "Sir with all due respect, you are wrong. Dean is bisexual and it is not just a fancy word he found off of the internet. It is a real thing that you need to accept because that is a part of Dean. As for our 'love'"
Dean's lips were plush against his own better than Cas could have ever imagined. It felt as if time stopped - as if it wasn't even real, nothing was real at that moment except for him and Dean. When they finally broke apart their bodies still flush against each other, Dean whispered on Cas's lips "I love you too dumbass. Let's do it let's run away together."
Billie and Cain pull the boy off Crowley after a moment with great struggle as he lashes against them. Hell bent on protecting Castiel and his newfound feather.
Cas knew this was it the last time he would see the love of his life. The last sacrifice he would make to save the righteous man once again.
Time seems to be going even slower than normal, Dean leaves his hand where it is on Cas’s back. He rubs small comforting circles up and down his spine.
“Gone” Michael says with a distance in his voice. Castiel can see the pain in his eyes, a hurt that he knows too well. Something in the way he shifts his weight, and sighs. Unbothered by the volume of the storm just outside. Seemingly unaffected by their presence, other than the few flashes where in the different shades of light he can see Adam in the brothers. Cas knows this. A love lost.
Dean pauses glancing to where Cas is enthralled in the show on the opposite side of the couch. Of course, they would be together how naive could he get ”We are going to a diner, I ain’t cooking”
“I don’t know” he says truthfully, as if the thought hadn’t even crossed his mind, “At the core of angels and demons alike we are like you – humanity, humans. As God breathed us into existence. Perhaps it is a test of whether we end up in heaven or hell just as you have. Of course, we are different. Since the beginning of our existence, the empty has been the resting place of those cosmic beings who have died. Maybe now when one of us dies we simply cease to exist, on this plane or another. I don’t know Dean. I was taught to never question God or his whims, so I did not.”
Cas had all his boxes pack neatly in his dad’s old car, there wasn’t much just a few boxes. He stood outside his family home, frowning up at the house. A letter left on the counter.
Dean tears his eyes away from the extremely upset, extremely hot Cas, even with his ugly sweater. Over to his father and he can practically see the steam rising from his ears the way he's feeling.
“Don’t you get it you already saved me.” His voice breaks. A single heartbroken tear, falling from his eye.
Dean tells him about John. The change after fire that killed Mary and almost killed Sammy. The way he withdrew from his duties as a father pushing that onto Dean, then pushed away everyone trying to help the two boys. Till his addiction to alcohol spiraled into violence and anger. A mission for vengeance on something that wasn’t even out there. Revenge from anyone he could find that seemed like they deserved it – Dean included - not that he told Cas that.
The room is small with a bed covered with a simple white and grey bedspread, and a few random blankets. The walls are covered with various posters, a couple from different bands, one from Star Wars featuring Harrison Ford as the center, a duke of hazard one, and even a few that are just cars. The walls are a plain off-white but don’t seem that way with all the posters. He has a dresser and a bookshelf on either wall opposite of the bed and a desk. The isn’t as messy as he expected but the desk is still littered in things CD’s, and schoolwork, and a few shirts are still on the floor.
Part of Dean has already conceded to the fact that, his family will react poorly to his bisexuality. He’d listened to enough of John’s complaining over queer people kissing on TV to know this. Though John often seemed harder to read to most, he wasn’t to Dean. He knew each eyeroll, each slight movement down to the tap of a finger of John’s mood, he had to growing up with him as his father. Dean has some hope in his uncle Bobby. After all he raised him, and his little brother more than John ever had after his mom, Mary’s death when he was four. But still, he could be wrong. He wondered if his mom were still here how things would have turned out, if she would have known, and if she would accept it. Dean supposes none of that matters now anyway.
His voice was just a whisper at the end, as he rolled onto his side facing Dean. For a moment they just stared, Cas could almost feel the wheels in Dean's head turning, the thoughtful way in which he tried to interpret Cas's words.
He sighs looking back down at the book in front of him, the words blurring on the page. As if it would be any use. They would still be gone.
“Thanks, but we don't have a stove remember, dorm rooms and all” Cas chuckles, taking a bite of his own. His eyes lighting up at the taste.
Cas nods leaning his back against the counter. Sending a quick text to Gabriel checking up on how his Christmas is. Though he’s not too concerned, Gabe could be in a meat grinder for Christmas and he’d still crack a joke about it. That is as long as he has candy.
No matter where he goes, he will remember Dean, they will be under the same moon, on the same earth, under the same sun. That's enough for him.
Snowflakes fall in little flurries, each their own intricate beings falling to their destruction. It may seem cynical but Dean doesn't think much into poeticness. It's simply circumstance in his eyes.  But he likes snowflakes, how the only way to experience their beauty is to destroy them. He thinks it just fits.
He's not sure how but in between the screaming inside his mind, they get closer till they are mere inches apart. Dean's hands gripping Cas's perfectly carved hips, keeping him from ever leaving. They breath in each other's icy peppermint breath. Close enough that if Dean just leaned forwards he could feel those lips he's only ever imagined against his own. So he does.
Taking a deep breath, Dean pushes all his thoughts away, staring blankly ahead at the road just outside the bunker’s garage door. He doesn’t turn on the radio. He just listens to the rain as the pelts of water splash on the windshield, and the engine rumbles. Dean just stares ahead with a frown on his face, and nothing in his eyes. Not once does he dare look at the rearview mirror, because he knows there is nothing – no one back there anymore. He suffocates, vision blurred and mind blank. He watches the road, the ditches, and nothing at all.
The other woman Donna is clothed in a police uniform wearing a large smile as she looks between the boys and Jody, “You betcha’” She holds out her arms taking the boy. Her voice has a drawl to it that is different from anything Castiel has heard in Kansas though he doesn’t know where to place it.
Cas keeps running. His feet pounding the floor as he rounds a corner. Down the endless maze of heaven’s halls. His voice raw from screaming. Vision blurred.
”That’s crap Cas” Dean stated bluntly but with gentle ease ”life is difficult yes, hard to understand, and maybe fiction is easier. But”
"What about me Cas" Dean repeated, dropping his hand, his eyes just on the verge of red, with unshed tears. Cas felt his heart drop to his feet, Dean never let anyone see him cry. Only a handful of times in the last twelve years he saw it.
Jack listens as the two archangels argue, focusing on the words from Lucifers mouth and the way he speaks, them. He’s already been tricked by his so-called father before; he knows that consequence and he’s not going to face that this time. Not again.
Castiel leans against the impala, as Dean rounds it to the trunk. He catches the tan piece of cloth; the hunter tosses to him. His original trench coat – the one from the lake. Dean kept it. Cas sheds off the burnt one slipping the other on. Inside the pocket he feels the small bee shaped charm Dean gave him from a truck stop during one of their hunts.
“Calm down” Lucifer shushes, still with the blade in his hand his hushes him bringing it down again, “she is the first reaper to check out since Billie”
Dean nods nervously, so Cas grabs his hand steadying him out. He knows how much he hates lying especially between him and his brother. After the falling out they had when the two of them were younger. Cas isn’t sure what exactly had happened, but he knew it was bad enough that Dean drove almost four hundred miles from Sioux Falls to Lebanon just to get a hug from Cas. When the Winchesters came back the following year for Dean and his senior year however everything seemingly had been resolved.
It isn’t as if Cas hasn’t met Dean’s family before. Hell, they had lived in a few different apartments together since the two became dormmates and friends at college. Cas had met the Winchesters on several occasions in fact. This was different though they are moving into a small townhouse together in a week. Dean decided it is time to tell his family about them getting together, as it had been a few months. He didn’t want to hide anymore he wanted to walk down the street proudly with his boyfriends’ hand in his own without a worry in his mind.
”Dean” Cas says a bit troubled, with a measured amount of anguish in his eyes. He just wants Dean to be happy ”What happened?”
Cas rolls up the sleeves of his 'Friends' jumper, washing his hands "I'll warn you, I'm not the best at baking. But I did occasionally bake for the people at the senior center when I was younger."
The two had begun to drift apart. Though they both still met on the weekends, they didn’t talk much over the week and had even missed a few of their usual meet ups.
“I can maybe do you one better,” Dean winked after regaining his composure, scooping up the remained of the books “I may be able to fix your car”
Reluctantly Dean drops his shoulders, he leans back on the bed. His heart pounding, he doesn’t do feelings, his dad didn’t and after Sammy needed him to be the strong one. To be his mother and his father, even with Bobby he still felt the need to be more than just a big brother, “I just-“ Dean begins and then he tells Cas that, tells him everything. He’s not even sure why it’s just easier with Cas; to tell him things he barely lets himself think.
Michael lets out a strangled gasp, the skin on his face cracks with lightning bolts of white seeping from his skin. As Chuck presses harder against the invisible force of his power the more alight the archangel becomes. His eyes turning a shade of white, the sight stolen from him, light flaming from his mouth. Covering his screams of pain. Cas watches as Jack takes in all in consuming the god powers and as he does, his stance gets stronger. Suddenly Michael bursts a million tiny flakes of white light dying out just as Lucifer did.
”What” Cas sighs pressing his grace into the injury. Dean always finds a way to pin something on him.
Dean’s eyes flicker back and forth across the floor, he grips his shirt pulling it away from his neck. Too tight, “Sammy. He said I love you, and I didn’t say anything back. He was about to die, and I just stood there…  And then I didn’t tell him to stay.”
“I got something” Sam announces proudly, his hair shaggier than usual, from fingers being tugged through it, thoroughly messed up, “I think I’ve started to understand it, got it pieced together.”
“Sush Dean” Cas bats at Dean playfully, “Don’t think I have seen you drinking from those mugs in the mornings over your plain ones. Thank you, Sam, I love it!”
Dean’s under eyes were smudged with black eye liner, in the corners a pop of green matched his hair. Topping it all off with the small spider on his right cheek bone.
Expecting Cas to shrink a bit more at his teasing he would stop soon. Instead, Cas looked up his eyes turning into slits his entire face on fire ”and so what if I am jealous”
"Hey Dean" Sam grabs his wrists, pulling his face out of his hands. Dean looks at him through unshed tears. Sam's voice comes out stern for a seventeen-year old "It is going to be okay. Maybe it doesn't have to end when you go home Dean. I guarantee Cas feels the same. He looks at you the same way that I look at Eileen with love."
“You always do this when he’s gone. Take a look in the mirror Dean it’s obvious how much you care about him. Have you even washed those pants it’s been a week” Sam accuses exasperated as he references to his hot dog bottoms that are more than a few days old, “There are bags under your eyes. I haven’t seen you touch the kitchen, and when you eat you push things around with your fork and then throw it in the trash. Hell, your hair is almost as long as mine. Look at this, the mess around you.”
The tension in Dean's shoulders drop, with the feeling of Cas's hand in his own, and the burden of all the things never said to his father off his shoulders. John's own shoulders do too, patting him on the shoulder, with a smile "Thank you for giving me a second chance son. I promise you what happened yesterday will not happen again."
He took in the hunter’s features, the freckles, the eyes, the hair, his flannel, the worried creases that became a permanent fixture on his face as the years grew by, even deeper now. The confusion and fear that overtook his expression when Cas spoke. Begging to Dean all that he is, the most selfless and loving man he’s ever known.
Dean snorts, taking large strides to the door. Only to be caught by his brothers’ hand on his shoulder, right where the handprint was. Anger flares in Dean’s chest, all he can see is red, “I don’t really give a shit.”
“Speaking of which. You my good sir need to get ready.” Dean pulled Cas up off the bed. Dragging him and the newly bought palette to the bathroom.
With that in mind he starts back at it, consulting with Jack and Amara. Rebuilding once more. Every part, for each place. Till after days of work, dedication, and grace, heaven is complete and renewed.
"Stop" Cas whines, pawing Dean's chest, effectively pulling him closer. Cas mumbles his voice groggy, clearly not awake, "Baby yo'so cold. Com're I warm you"
“Thanks Dean” Cas takes it into his hand, and he nudges the other boy’s shoulder. His chest feeling like something is about to exploded inside it. The feather glimmers with iridescent color still; no bother of the dampness of the feather.
“I have to go to the bathroom, I’ll be right back.” Dean says with wide eyes. Nearly tripping over his chair as he goes, Dean practically bolts out of the room.
Dean’s eyes flicker back and forth across Cas’s face, his tongue darts out to wet his lips, Cas bites the inside of his cheek impatiently, “Look Cas I – I don’t, I mean. What you said. I –“
His mind flashes back, all those years ago. To the original barn when sparks flew and Castiel angel of the lord entered. The way his heart stopped when those doors flung open and restarted when the shadows of his wings splayed across the walls. The scene before him is so reminiscent of that moment. Dean would be okay with this being his last one.
“No, it’s not okay” Dean yells with the same intonation, repeating the words Cas said early when he was dying. He grabs the angel’s – he is still Dean’s angel – hands again, “You always save me, saved everyone. Over and over. Sacrificing everything for everyone else – for me. Without thought as to the cost, nor hesitation.” Dean lifts Cas’s bandaged hand as an example, “You have always saved me Why won’t you let me save you for once.”
It started to seem to Cas though that no matter Dean’s reasoning he made Cas feel as though he had to hide more and more. Something he didn't want to do; not anymore, not after his aunt who raised him.
A repetitive banging grew louder by the second. Billie ever closer to breeching the magical barrier between them and the deadly end of her scythe. It felt as if at any second the metal door would shatter, and shrapnel would fly out in all directions. Yet in that moment all Cas focused on was the green eyes of the man he loved above all else.
Cas looked up at Dean from under thick black eyelashes, seemingly even more beautiful than before, “I wanted to surprise you. Sorry for not doing it with you but I left room for you to decorate it too.”
As the two vampires strike with unhuman force. Dean kicks toppling one of them to the ground. He slashes the other. Catching a piece of cloth with a loud rip. As he reels back the vampire, strikes out his weapon. He jumps back just in time bumping into the back of the other. He spins unhanding the other. The blade skittering across the floor. Dean groans at the one delivers a blow jaw. He darts out his tongue tasting the blood from his freshly split lip.
Cas sets his jaw, ready to again ravel the work he’s put into convincing Dean that he is not the same as how he sees himself. But when Dean gives him a silent look, he doesn’t speak.
Castiel didn't want to leave. When Amara offered, he wanted to say no, stay with the Winchesters - Dean. In whatever way he would have him. But he looked at Dean and the hunter didn’t say a word.
Later, when the small pelts of rain find the two snoring softly, Cas strewn across Dean’s chest, and Dean clutching the back of Cas’s shirt. The droplets rouse them awake.
”I” Dean tries. Instead, he pulls Cas into himself, all his love for the angel caressed into Cas’s mouth with the touch of their lips. His lips tracing the words for him.
Cas could feel the sigh from Dean, the tension ease. He couldn't help but let off a beaming smile as Dean answered ”we will just have to see”
Jack and Cas however stay outside, sitting on a blue rusted bench in front of the diner. Facing out towards the empty streets. Cas remembers the early days with the Winchesters. When he was afraid to rebel and only just begun considering it. How he would watch humanity, understand their actions, and learn from a bench just like this one. It was a bench where he felt for the first time the emotions humans so often glorified, in poems, movies, songs, and all of their creations. Where he first smiled and made his decision for humanity – for
The hunter ducks as a blade swings at his head, from another masked vampire who was waiting just outside. Cas holds his hand out pushing the masked vampire back. When they blade slashes across Cas’s hand, he stumbles back. In the matter of seconds, its head is rolling across the ground, bodiless. With the wave of Jack’s powers and Sam’s slice to his head.
“Sam don’t” Dean quietly tries cutting his little brother off, reaching his free hand over to touch his brother’s arm.
He doesn’t mean for it to come out so callous, but he can’t stop himself. There are things more important than himself.
Slowly Cas turned back, looking at Dean one hand behind Dean’s back. Fighting to keep a expressionless face.
Everything looked as if the previous events had never happened. Hopefully Cas would raise his spirits when he saw what Dean had.
There are still the tense emotions between Dean and Cas, but Dean can’t even bring himself to care as long as he has his angel by his side. Dean wants to tell him everything and say it back. Again, he looks at the angel by his side. The yellow light cast over him creating a halo above him, and all Dean can do is act as if everything is just as it was.  Placing one foot in front of the other, relishing in the sparks that radiate through him when he brushes against Cas.
“I wouldn’t say that yet”, He scoffs, though Dean is in the mist of having a panic attack, he recognizes Cas’s steady tell-tale signs of nervousness as well. For some reason that gives him a little comfort too knowing he’s not the only one who is nervous, “You know I am here for you too right?”
“You realize, he’s never going to take that thing off right” Sam comments, with a shake of his head at his cowboy obsessed older brother.
Cas nodded miserable waiting for the cruel laughter, or maybe the yelling about how disgusting he is, but nothing came but stock silence. Finally, Cas pulled his eyes from the cracked concrete beneath his feet, only to be met with the last thing he expected a smile. A warm and gooey smile that reminded him of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies.
Dean’s cellphone lets out a ring before he has the chance to say anything else. He looks back to Cas and lets out a frustrated puff of air before pulling the phone from his pocket.
They gasp once they’re out pointing their shaking small fingers behind Sam and Dean. Paling as they, cower into each other. Dean recalls a reflection just like this on the first hunting trip John took both Sam and Dean on.
“We’ll go with you then Dean you brought us here in the impala” Sam counters logically. Examining his brother.
Sam runs his fingers through his hair ”I don't know Cas. You know Dean sometimes he is just angry, and he doesn’t know how to deal with it so he takes it out on the people closest to him. But we aren’t going to fix it now. Not while he is like this lets just finish dinner and go back to the bunker. We can give him tonight.”
“I know Dean I remember” Cas sighed “but look where you are you are about to graduate with a degree in computer science and your parents can suck it. Plus remember what I told you back then, I believe in you.”
Dean sticks to Sam’s word, he cleans what he can of the paint off the floor, though the violent slashes of blue still remain on the wall taunting him. He cuts his hair and showers in the morning putting on a fresh set of real clothing. Not just pj’s. Even going as far as to eat a piece of toast for breakfast after his walk outside with Miracle. When he’s all done, he looks halfway like Dean Winchester again.
The four of them leave the barn, much to Cas’s surprise Dean stands just as close as normal. He thinks even if this is all he can have even after the small bits of hope for something else Dean’s given him. Then it’s enough.
When the sights around him become clear and he can see the stricken face of his hunter once again it finally dawns on him what he just did. The worry about everything else, the empty, Billie, Chuck, it all fades. All there is, is Dean holding his broken vessel to close to look anywhere but at him, and the words of his confession hanging heavily above them. So, he gives in he holds his breath and watches as the hunter opens and closes his mouth struggling for words. Cas knows what’s coming, he doesn’t need an explanation why or an apology. He has already made peace with the loss of something he never had. Instead, he feels embarrassed, and a little scared he didn’t think he would have to face his rejection he sacrificed himself for Dean. He wasn’t supposed to live to hear the I don’t love you the way you love me. He wasn’t supposed to live to see the fissures, to watch as Dean pushes him away because he’s uncomfortable.
Jack nods, “They aren’t his powers anymore.” Cas places a comforting hand on Jack shoulders proud of his son. Jack smiles back at him, giving him a hug, and Chuck looks at it with confusion and realization and loss.
That's it. Dean snaps, storming into the kitchen taking Cas's hand, the other pointing into his father. Part of his body blocking Cas. His voice cold, almost dead, the only readable expression anger, “Don't you dare talk about Cas like that. You have no right to even suggest that he doesn't deserve the whole goddamn world! Clearly you don't know me because if you did you would know I love him with every breath I’ve got!"
Dean shows up at the park where the two first met, where they met most weekends. Castiel hadn’t been in his usual spot on the park bench or even at the swing sets. That hadn’t been completely odd if Cas wasn’t there, but he hadn’t been at home either. Dean returned later.
Dean stands hidden in the doorway listening to the conferentation. He almost jumps out when John starts talking his blood boiling, but Cas is quick to defend him with his sharp witted tongue.
Sam he has to feel the same. He probably hasn’t said anything because Dean is always there, or worse he has and just is too afraid to tell Dean. Because of the way he always looks at Cas with googly eyes.
“O-kay” Cas’s voice breaks, and they look away back to the tv. Not before Cas swears he sees pink beneath Dean’s freckled face.
Taking a sort of black stick Cas tugged at his under eye. Smudge places with his finger. The whole while the process was interrupted with uncontrollable kisses.
Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel’s back ”Well I guess it's a good thing I'm the only barista who knows how to make it just right.”
A strangled gasp comes from Castiel his shoulders slump forwards. The tension that was holding him up is lost into grief.
Vampire number three while still knocked out, Dean ties his hands behind his back. Perhaps tighter than necessary but he can’t bring himself to care. They push him down on a tree stump in the yard, yanking the mask from his face. To reveal a basic-looking middle-aged white guy. He wakes with a start, flashing his vangs just as they pull the mask from his face.
From the corner of his eye, he sees Sam has managed to behead one, and the other is well on its way. Dean ducks as the vampire swings at him, dropping his own machete to the floor. Coming back up he locks his arm around him only to be pushed back across the room. Dean pushes off the post beside him, charging again towards the Vampire.
Dean laughed, albeit perplexed over Cas’s word choice. Cas cocked his head to the side in confusion at what Dean was laughing about.
Dean promptly likes Anna. She is fierce and snarky albeit a tad lost much like Cas but less. It seems at least to Dean, that Jo and Anna are happy with each other.
“Cas” Sam simply waves back with an unsurprised look on his face. Telling Cas that Dean hadn’t stopped talking about him finally coming out to the house. That gave Cas a flutter in his chest. He’d be lying if he said that he hadn’t done the same to Gabe and Anna when he could.
Dean turns his head but doesn’t lift it from the wall, looking to his shaggy haired brother. Another thing cut Sammy’s hair. In reality Dean knows this list he’s began to compile about what to do if they make it won’t matter. It’s just that a list, something that makes him think he will still have a tomorrow, and time to do and say all the things he needs. But at the end of the day there probably won’t be a tomorrow for him, maybe any of them. Even if there is, Dean knows the things that matter he will be too scared to do… say.
Cas here’s a shifting of the wind being displaced behind him. Suddenly Chuck is there standing at his five-seven all-mighty God stature. A crisp vanilla suit, clad to his body in a way that make him appear as a pseudo source of benevolence. Deeper the light of his being radiates past his vessel a true visage of his being, on show to display his power. For one final battle.
Chuck turns to see Jack upright and unaffected. The Nephilim stands his ground a complete beacon, exuding power, and confidence. He still has his child-like demeanor but there is something more there now too.
Cas gasped looking at the ring in Dean's hands, it was a small silver band with a black gem in the center and two smaller yellow ones on the outside "I know it's not much - that I don't have much either, but I love you Cas. I have my love to offer you every day for the rest of our lives if you'll have me. Will you marry me?"
“Merry Christmas” Cas and Dean chime at the same time, beckoning the other couple inside “Come on in”
"What" Dean panicked, reaching out to touch Cas's shoulder, "Why? I know your family, but why wouldn't you tell me. What about us - what about me."
"ugh" he groans, pulling his book from his duffle. A story of how an angel rebelled and fell for the righteous man, saving him from hell, and in turn the righteous man rose and taught him about humanity and free will. Slowly falling in love himself. A man who didn't believe in angels until he fell in love with one.
‘I learned from my aunt Amara who was born deaf’ Cas explains, though after she died he hadn’t used it much. Other than the occasional hard of hearing client he worked with.
Jack doesn’t say anything for a long while he just sits thinking, and Cas lets him, “Thank you Cas. I love you too. I just don’t want you to leave me.” He gives a small lopsided smile before hugging the angel, delicately careful of his wounds.
Cas feels his heart drop, obviously he was reading to much into Dean’s words. He felt so stupid for thinking - thinking Dean could have meant something.
Dean pressed a kiss on the top of Cas’s head “Cas, babe, you are beautiful. Your makeup is beautiful.”
Dean outstretched his hand, looking down at the trench coat clad man he now calls his own, "Come on Cas"
Now Chuck stands alone surrounded, by Team Free Will. Each ready to fight to their dying breath if needed. But they won’t need to.
But nobody was paying attention to any of that. All that mattered, occurred in the deep corner of that hidden bunker in Lebanon, Kansas. Where the fate of the world rested on the shoulders of a broken man and a fallen angel.
Chugging more down, till he is practically putty. He stumbles over to the mirror in his room. Looking at his dazed and heartbroken reflection in the mirror.
Lucifer chuckles at their shocked faces, he redacts his previous story, “Pops was the one who left me out of the empty. Ya know before it burned up or whatever he did.” Jack tips his head to the side in lieu of Cas, “Anyway I’m sort of the new favorite now.”
“oo, touchy subject I see” Lucifer groans, pulling the bullet from his chest. Healing both his body and shirt.
Dean doesn’t know what to say to that. He suspects there’s nothing to say, Cas just needs him to be there.
After Gabriel left no one ever cared, for years, except Dean. Countless nights he begged for Gabriel to come back, to save him, to do anything except just sending him postcards and letters. He didn't. In time Cas accepted this because he wouldn't have left in those years anyway, because of Dean. Even all the slurs, all the ignoring, and all the pain, there was Dean.
”I” Dean didn't know what to say, he couldn’t be happy with Cas but Sam could. The broken pleading in Cas’s voice told him he had to let them be happy even if it hurt him ”No Cas. I don’t want to be that guy. I don’t want to be the guy that is too selfish that he stands in the way of your happiness. I don’t want to push you away either. I am not selfish enough to hold you back. I will let you go. I promise. I just don’t want to lose you Cas. You can tell Sam you like him. ”
“Not to me, not to you, not to his angels” He points to Cas, who just flickers his eyes up for a moment then back to the archangels, “not to…” He pauses flipping his hands towards Sam and Dean, with a look of recoil, and venomously finishes “Humanity.”
“Fine” Chuck cracks his knuckles not a scar on them, not even a trace of blood, “I can make you guys give up.”
Pressing the pen down on the bumpy white surface Cas began his work, with only the low light of Dean’s lamp beside the bed to guide him. Cas is knelt beside the bed leaning over the hunter’s body to do his tedious drawings. Occasionally the former angel became distracted by the pleasantness of Dean’s face as he slept and the small little snores that came from his mouth every so often.
“What? What did you do?” Chuck asks in a meager tone, looking up at the four of them in confusion. Cas looks down at him though he thinks he should be pleased at his fear he isn’t.
Dean’s legs shake weakly as Cas returns his passion. Whether it’s day or night, he doesn’t know all he knows is he is here. They are so close, and they are kissing. A feeling he’s wanted for so long, even as he has it doesn’t know how to explain.
Dean shook his head regaining his usual bravado, “Yeah man.” Dean sits on the bed and seconds later Cas joins him. Not saying a word as he waits for the rest of Dean’s statement to fall from his lips. Dean continues while looking down at his hands,  “Anyway you came to hang out not deal with my family crap. It’s all good.”
“Dad, Bobby hey” Dean stands up to greet his family. Giving Bobby a hug, and John a curt nod. John has never been a touchy-feely kind of guy.
Cas starts to shuffle out of his seat, confused, because the three of them had just gotten their food. Before he can stand though, Dean pushes him back down, “No, no you two stay. Enjoy your meal, and… stuff. I just don’t feel up to it anymore, want to go home and sleep.”
Turning his back on where Dean left, he shoves it all down he can cry later. It won’t be the first Christmas he’s cried on.
The book is worn, the spine broken, pages wrinkled from where rain had fell on it, but Cas still reads it, in spite of it all. Nearly every nook and cranny of empty space filled and he still has more to comment on, to note down.
“Of course I care Cas,” Dean says, before pulling Cas into a hug that is more like a cuddle. However, Cas doesn’t mind, as he buries his face into the crook of his best friend’s neck.
Dean chokes, he can feel it coming the silent lull of death, he has felt many times before. Vision swimming as he looks at his brother face, tear soaked and broken, protesting against it. His words slur as he speaks saying everything, he want’s Sam to know before he’s gone. How proud he is, how much he looks up to him, and love him. Sam shouts against him praying for Castiel.
There was a moment of silent grief between the two of them who had fallen so quickly into the routine of seeing each other. The movie had paused and the only thing that pulled Cas out of his silent reverie was the door slamming closed and Anna stepping inside.
Dean knows that he couldn’t do this without Cas. He’s the whole reason for it though isn’t he; because Dean never once felt this kind of love before. The kind that John always talked about with Mary. This profound bond despite everything thrown their way. Castiel is it for Dean.
"Let me help," Dean said, wrapping his arms around his boyfriend resting his chin on his shoulder. He guided his arms into the throw watching Cas's face pucker with determination, and clank - all of the bottles fell to the ground.
Melissa goes back to her toys bouncing around as Sam and Eileen watch her. Dean and Cas join her sitting down cuddled into each other backs to their fireplace. There is something so familiar about it. Just like their first Christmas together, minus Jo who is meeting her new girlfriend’s parents for the first time, but promised to see them at New Years.
Blue eyes stared into green with soft smiles on their faces, Cas reached up and brushed a leaf from Dean's hair as it fell on him. They laced fingers on top of the soft straw, knowing looks in their eyes as if they were thinking the same thing. This very night in this exact spot, all those years ago, before the years of friendship, and now dating back to the night they first met.
“Hey bitch” Sam raised his hands in defense, his face making it clear he still found it comical, “it wasn’t me look who signed it”
It’s a dinky little gas stop with a small shop no bigger than, a living room, bathrooms at the back with chipped white men and women signs. A few rust-colored pumps, along the gravel.
“What’s it going to be?” Lucifer still taunts impervious to the anger coming from Jack, “What do you say?”
When Jack brings Sam back, after returning the kids safely to their mother. Dean and Cas are leaning against the hood of the impala, holding hands. Cas is pointing up at the sky with his other hand, explaining a constellation to Dean. Who is looking at his with a soft loving smile. Cas looks back down from the stars at Dean, and he leans over and kisses him twice.
Cas nods and Dean continues. He explains how Jack became a power vacuum after the events of trying to turn him into a cosmic bomb. How he’s been taking power from everything around him. Lucifer and Michaels battle. Lucifer’s death releasing all his power. And Michael.
“Dad” Jack grabs his father figure, hauling him up, Cas wraps an arm around Jacks shoulder, leaning heavily against him. He feels tired, weak, so entirely human.
Michael whips his head up, “Of course not.” He defends quicker than he should. Devoid of the conflicting turmoil that previously fleeted across his face.
The times Jack was there it was easier to distract himself from the heart ache, and work. When he wasn’t Cas found himself staring into the distance for periods of time, snapping back into reality and continuing again.
“So, do you, have it?” Betty asks the first time she’s spoke full sentences since appearing. She seems to be unphased by the fact that Lucifer kidnapped her, killed her, and then she returned as death.
Dean’s eyes fly open. Crashing back against the post. He groans, a sharp breath retching from his open mouth. He grabs wildly at the Vamps mask. Feeling the sharp pain of something in his back. Struggling against him. The pain grows overwhelming. He lets out a breath when Sam slices off his head. Dropping his arms back to his sides, head to his chest. Tired.
”I’m telling you Benny” Dean sprayed a swirl of whip topping on a drink ”it’s strange he orders a new drink every day and then doesn't drink it”
“Right” Cas grumbles in realization looking around the room, in Dean’s parent's house, with his family all right downstairs.
“Good” Cas yells back to John in final response as they open the door, the four of them stepping outside.
When he arrived in the white corridors of heaven, there was chaos. The first few days he didn't have much time to think. Though he could still feel the hurt, it was easier having something to focus on. Amara rebuilt the world and humanities understanding of the events after Chuck with Jack's help. While Cas set off to restore heaven. Rebuilding it to a way in which it was meant to be. Jack helped direct Cas between helping Amara.
Cas nods. Dean pulls the boy to his feet ensuring he is properly stable before letting him go with some reluctance. The park is still loud and filled around them, yet it feels as if Cas is in his own bubble of time with Jody and Dean.
The two never seemed to drift away after that day. They shared a mutual understanding and closeness. Best friends.
They walk down the center isle between the two rows of wooden pews, each looking around for any sign of life. Angels of Michael stand at the forefront, where a sermon or priest would give lecture. Bibles and scriptures lay haphazardly along the pews, abandon on a search for something, to be returned to again. Candles are lit around the church in various places. Serving as the only source of light in the dim building, other than the lightening bursts from the stain glass windows on the sides of the church. The candles seem to be newly lit, it seemed unlikely that they were left burning when Chuck ended the world. But that someone had recently began to burn them again.
Suddenly the door is being swung open and Dean is being pulled into a bone-crushing hug. Cas drops away from his arm before it can get captured too. He watches with amusement as Dean's cheeks turn a dark shade of scarlet, "Dean you are here" Mary's silvery voice exclaims, ignoring Dean's embarrassment.
“Hey” Dean grumbles with a smirk. Not dropping the controller in his hand, but sliding his eyes over to Cas with a flirtatious glance. He gestures downwards, “not my fault my legs are bowed”
Chirps rose from in the rusted white bird cage hanging beside the small bedroom window. Castiel watches the small creature offering it a drop of water on his tiny fingertip. The sunlight falls over it’s pastel blue feathers making them look even more ruffled than before. The fragile blue bird accepts the water from his finger pecking at the seeds below it.
”Anyways” Sam interrupts trying to ease the situation, Cas eagerly looks to Sam ”I found a new case”
The hunter and the former angel sit on the hood of the impala. Under the millions of stars, moon light streaming over them. The orange glow of the headlights at their feet. Dean’s jaw set tightly with anger, clicking as he works. Cleaning away the blood from Cas’s hand, disinfecting it. He holds one of his hands under Cas’s wrists, curling his fingers around it. He squeezes his hand lightly when Cas takes a sharp breath as the alcohol is poured over the cut. With his other hand he begins wrapping the bandage around his hand.
“Sorry” Dean mumbles squaring his shoulders, Cas wraps his arms around the other preteen. It weird – he knows he’s been told he is a little more, touchy feely than most people he can’t help it. Dean doesn’t ever say anything about it, though he did talk about personal space for a while, before those boundaries stopped being an issue.
“I don’t care” Dean shakes his head, with an affectionate chuckle. Then he smashes their lips together. Cas lets his eyes fall shut, as the breath is knocked out of him. Dean’s lips are soft, cold. Salty and wet from the tears and the rain. But its perfect. The kiss is filled with warmth and pleading. Making up for all the years they lost, all the death they’ve suffered. Filled with all the love they have. Filled with everything.
Once again, he flings Castiel back, getting him out of the way. Though he lands softer this time he doesn’t get up. Then the real suffering begins as Chucks throws punches and kicks left and right enhanced by his godly powers. Each of the punches sendoff waves of power strengthening Jack. He punches again. Cas can hear the cracking of bone, the blood, wounds collecting at a rapid pace. It takes all of his strength not to get off the ground and fight back. Not to fight for the Winchesters – Dean – that’s not a part of the plan. He watches instead not using his grace to heal himself but rather to save it in case they need it. It feels like it goes on forever. Punching, the cracking of bones, the brothers groaning, each time they get back to their feet. Again, and again. More bones cracking, blood spit from their mouths, and they get back to their feet. Though Chuck beats them down continuously, they still stand again. Fighting back.
Seeming to not believe his shaky ‘yeah’, Dean lifts up the blue-eyed boys pant leg to reveal a few small scrapes on his knees. Nothing a bit of Neosporin and a few cookie monster band aids won’t fix right up. It isn’t the physical pain that made Cas hurt it was the bullies, it hurt when they were mean. Everyone is mean to Cas it’s inevitable which is why he is surprised at Dean.
”Cas,” he calls into the room dedicated to their resident angel, finding it empty. Dean steps in regardless, intending to collect whatever clothing Cas may have, though recently he hasn’t noticed him changing outfits much. Sticking to his ‘holy tax account’ shtick. Which makes since considering Angels don’t need to do those things. Dean knows though often Cas enjoys the luxury of certain more human things, such as a enjoying a warm shower or changing his clothing.
Cas groans as Dean kisses down his neck, sucking a small mark onto the base of his neck. He recaptures his lips with his own pushing him back down. He grabs at the hem of Dean’s shirt, tugging at it.
The brothers and the angel all exchange confused looks. As well as a mutual understand. They must find whatever or whomever Jack is feeling.
This feels like the end, yet Dean isn’t sure this is real, or how he could deserve something like this. He doesn’t know the right words to say or how to end it. So, he doesn’t. He doesn’t say anything, the coward doesn’t breathe a word. Closing his eyes to the hurt expression on Castiel’s face and the tears that begun to bud in his eyes.
When Dean went to the store later, he proudly showed off his heart covered Valentine’s day cast (which he got many compliments on thank you very much), and his boyfriend who was holding his hand.
More people began to join the hayrack ride piling on until it was completely filled. Everything was so content, Dean thought how perfect. The tractor emitted a low hum as it moved them steadily along, away from the loud carnival where they had spent the majority of the day. All by themselves just the way Dean intended. Riding small rides, sharing pie and cotton candy, watching Cas fail at simple games.
"Don't let that influence you though. I just don't want things to be awkward between us after this if I go too far. I don't want to ruin our friendship all because I can't keep a relationship" Dean said sincerely, stepping closer and placing a hand over the horse as well.
His fingers brush away a greasy strand of dark hair from Cas’s blue tinged face. On the surface he looks better, healed even, but Dean knows. It’s just a façade, just for the rest of them, so they won’t worry. Because Cas always looks out for everyone else, cares for everyone else. Except himself. Dean dips the hair behind the angel’s ear and whispers aloud “I’m sorry Cas”
Cas crossed his arms angrily huffing at what he interpreted to be Dean’s flirting. He knew he had no right to be jealous or mad, but he couldn't help it. Of course, Dean would want someone like her, not someone as boring as himself.
Castiel turns around, his lip worried between his teeth, he doesn’t look up. He stares intently down at the road beneath his feet. His shoulders seem to hunch even more if possible. His normally messy hair is plastered to his head drenched in the rain. The trench coat a shade darker. For a moment Dean just watches him, not breathing, just watching.
"I want to thank you Dean this is quite more enjoyable than I thought it may be. Of course I thought I'd be third wheeling much of Christmas. But this has brought me much joy" Cas admits, and Dean's heart does a painful twist. Knowing even if Benny were here Cas wouldn't be the third wheel. Dean understands it now why Benny left, there's a freedom in it Dean thinks.
“Dad” Dean says, before wrapping an arm around his father. John pats his son’s back, before releasing him from the quick hug.
He breaths in Dean’s intoxicating leather and gunpowder scent. Feeling the full thickness of his body as if for the first time. There’s a rumble in Dean’s chest, Cas feels him pick his head up from his shoulder, softly, “I should have told you to say.”
But Cas bursts forwards, taking Dean’s soft slightly stubbled face into his own hands. Pushing a kiss into his lips just as intense as the one a second ago. They fall back onto the bed, lips never breaking. A hot frenzy of kisses exchanged a few down Dean’s jaw. Hands roaming over his chest, and Dean’s gripping Cas’s hips.
It wasn't as if Cas hadn't applied to schools too, he had. He and Dean had applied and gotten into the same ones, but Cas had never accepted because he didn't expect to be here for it.
He studies the metal door. The bolts surrounding it’s exterior with a growing rust on them. Scrap pieces welded on parts of the door as if repairing holes in the metal. It makes Cas choke up, he forgot about the little things.
Walking back to the couch Cas holds up the cookies. Watching how Dean licks his lips, and he swears he sees his pupils dilate the least little bit. Cas places the end of the mouth-watering morsel into Dean's open lips. Keeping the green one for himself.
Glancing at his shoulder, Cas tightens his jaw, aggressively “Shut up” The angel rips him from the nail, pulling him by his shoulders without warning.
“It was nice to meet you Cas” Bobby calls after Cas practically races up the stairs, towards the door that has Dean’s name on it.
The wound heals, death edges away from him. But Cas as he pours every last drop, he has of his grace into Dean’s very being. He feels it. Humanity taking root in him. The angel can feel as the inner coils of grace peel away slipping from his fingertips into his love. Castiel can feel himself becoming human. Still, he doesn’t stop. Allowing the last drop of his grace to fall from his hand. In a defining moment. Sealing up the final seam of Dean’s fatal wound. Maybe he just doesn’t want to be the one who lives forever anymore. Maybe he just wants to be human, feel things differently, taste without tasing just molecules. Feel hot water in the most basic sense rolling down him easing the tension from his muscles. Feel the warming touch, and the course yet soft touch of Dean’s skin against his if only for this moment. Maybe he wants to grow old and be human. It doesn’t matter Cas just knows he wants it, so he lets his angelic self go.
He pulls his head back sniffling slightly. When he opens his eyes he is met with a head full of dirty blonde hair. Cas stiffness in realization of what he has done. Pressed firmly against his best friend - fake boyfriend - love of his life.
They wrapped up in each other's arms the last ones on the trailer ”I’m thinking an autumn wedding surrounded by falling leaves, cinnamon, pie...”
Dean feels blood rush to his cheeks, Cas not much better. Tense against each other, "um" Dean grapples taking the peppermint hot cocoa from her hands.
‘Lovely to meet you, Sam has gushed to me about you’ Cas signs and says. Though his signing is a bit slow and sloppy from lack of practice.
Dean just nods as the two of them calm themselves. Cas holds out his hand for Dean to take, calmer now “So does that make us real boyfriends”
Something tickles at Cas's nose, waking him from his content sleep. One of the best nights of rest he's had for years if he's honest.
Cas’s breath hitches and he is suddenly speechless as Dean gives him a soft smile. It feels as if his mouth has turned into the Sahara Desert. When he finally finds his words again it comes out breathy “Maybe”
Castiel heads towards the gas station his stomach rumbling, as he sees the vending machine out front. He frowns at his reflection in the vending machine, the feeling of hunger and thirst taking over. Luckily, he has a few dollars in his trench coat only enough for a water. He shoves the bill a few times before it stops spitting it back out at him. The bottle clinking down the machine and landing at the bottom with a loud thud. Picking it up he drains the bottle within seconds, looking forlorn at the singular quarter in his hand which isn’t enough for even the fifty cent Twinkie.
Blinding light burns through the darkness; Dean shields his eyes as the light becomes too bright. Even behind his hand he can see the light duller by his eyelids.
Dean’s eyes dart towards the door of the restaurant before he even looks at their faces. He feels like he is about to puke when nothing is said.
A golden colored dog lays beneath a wooden pallet with puppy dog eyes that could even rival Sammys. His wet nose glistening in the sun. Dean brushes his fur, digging his fingers into the soft fluffy texture, ruffing his face up, “never thought finding a dog would be a miracle. Come on miracle!”
Once again for the last time perhaps Team Free Will is in the impala, speeding down the road. As Sam explained the spell had a certain set of ingredients which had to combined in a specific location. At a certain angle from the sun. The edge of a set of trees, down on an empty patch of dirt leading down to the open water of a lake, still full of life. Dean pulled into the opening they begun the spell combining the ingredients. Sam said a few words of enochian over the spell the book in the center of the three bowls of ingredients.
“Mmh” Dean moans when he bits into the rolls, with his mouth still full he says “thewse awe yummy Cas. You have to make us some back home”
"I guess we are doing a good job," Cas says with a small little smile, once they sit taking the cocoa from Dean.
Cas frowns stepping forwards, and taking both of Dean's hands. Maybe it's a stupid move but a part of him knows what's coming, "Dean 'boyfriend' or just bestfriend I was glad to be there for you. Besides you didn't drag me into this, I offered. Plus.."
”Anyways Dean where is your boyfriend you promised would come for Christmas? Tell me he didn't miss it.” Mary looks around them searching for a non-existent face. A sympathetic note in her voice.
“It matters to me Dean” Cas says softly, tucking a finger beneath Dean’s jaw and pulling his face back up. A tender movement, Dean drunkenly leans into, “Please just tell me. What is wrong?”
Dean doesn’t want to break the energy from Sam’s face, but he speaks “Sam…” His chest squeezes when his brother looks at him. He pats his abdomen where the pain is, his breath growing ragged, “I don’t – I don’t think I’m going anywhere.”
The evening yields an eerie quiet through the bunker. Though since they returned there hadn’t been much other than quiet. Just a somber hush drawn over them, dividing to their separate corners of the bunker.
Cas’s eyes were perfectly smoked out. From dark blue to black. He had drawn blue feathers out from the edges of his eye to his hair line, spilling from his eyebrows down to his cheek bones. Cheek bones which stood sharp, with his cheeks hallowed out by the makeup.
"I know" Mary sighs with a sympathetic frown "but I still feel as though I should apologize. John will come around."
Swinging his blade back out he manages to slice the vampire’s neck. It’s head rolling away, and body collapsing to the floor the machete landing with a clink.
There is something so easing and believable in his voice or maybe it’s just because he’s Cas. Still in his childhood home a home that was so loving. Yet one where he felt he could never really speak his truths “but I can’t though, you remember how hard it was for me to talk to them about college. I can’t do this.”
"What?" Sam waits patiently for Dean to continue. Sam has always been better at sharing his feelings and talking about things of that nature.
Cas looks at Dean, noticing the fine lines that have begun to form in crinkles around his eyes, “With you always”
Still the brothers don’t give in and continue to get up. Not saying a word, not giving Chuck any more power over them anymore.
This time it is Jack who is approaching with an intent, viewing God as just a man – Chuck, not a threat. His brows furrowed and his eyes looking over his shoulders at Castiel and the Winchesters. They are all giving him reassuring looks.
The park is fairly large for the small town of Lebanon, a large set of swing sets behind a jungle gym-like structure with two slides. Little benches all around, it even has a set of covered picnic tables and a worn-down basketball court a few feet away.
It is nearing nighttime, and the four of them have been cramped in the stuffy impala, riding on unease and hopelessness. As they make their way back to the bunker. When they get out to, grab supplies at a still unlocked Gas-and-sip on the way. The idiot ‘saviors of the world’ devised a plan to give Chuck what he wants. To accept their roles. Kill each other. Finishing the story ‘God’ wanted for them, saving the rest of the world. Returning it to the way it once was.
Amara frowns, looking at the brothers who are skeptical, wary of her. She looks different now softer, with less hard features on her face, even the mark is gone from her shoulder, “Look I know, you are worried. After everything I did, trusting my brother – protecting him. But you should understand Dean.” She swallows, and Dean nods he can understand, still that doesn’t mean they can trust her, “I learned, I apologize for my part in my brother’s actions. I didn’t realize just how Chuck he was till we became one. I could see every part of him. I won’t be like him. I won’t be hands on.”
But surely Cas wouldn’t be that scared, or mad about Dean knowing about the makeup. After all he had been listening to the mixtape, he made him while doing his makeup.
No response, Cas pushes the door open expecting to see the hunter asleep in the bed probably forgetting to turn off the light.
“As long as you can make pie, I’ll love you forever” Dean states getting a little too caught up in the banter. Though if anyone can make him pie he would love them forever.
Cas nodded a look of hurt and embarrassment flashing over his face. He’d been outside building his confidence for almost twenty minutes just to ask the favor “okay it’s okay I can get an Uber or something”
“Dean Michael Winchester” A young woman, with a toddler on her hip scolds, her mouth down turned and her eyes piercing Castiel’s savior.
“Of course” Dean pushed himself up, fumbling around to grab his crutches. Desperately trying to get away from Cas, away from his sad eyes that probably were only pity for Dean. The man who fell in love with the most breath taking, incredible angel, who didn’t love him back.
“The spell.” Sam says like that explains everything. He pulls a paper covered in his ink scrawling’s from the book before closing it shut, “The book describes a spell, steps to enact it. From Rowena’s teachings I could decipher it. The spell will summon God and end him.”
“Awesome” Cas said in an excited tone repeating the phrase he heard probably a thousand times from Dean since becoming friends. He also gave a small cheer. Adorable Dean thought, sometimes he would be this feisty guy and others a lil marshmallow.
The sound of logs crackling can be heard from the fireplace. Flames licking at logs, flickering towards the metal cage in front of it like a wild animal.
Dean smiled ”Let’s just be sure” he pressed Cas against the side of his car, lips meeting. His tongue mixing in with their hot but sweet kisses. When they pulled away both of them were out of breath, Cas seemed slightly dazed.
Cas joins him after a moment, grabbing his bag out, just before Dean slams it closed with a - Clunk.
But Lucifer just looks pleased with himself, and Cas seems unfazed by the whole ordeal. Angel’s man.
”You're probably right we can ask him in the morning” Cas reasons, waving it off. Letting them get back to their meal.
Though he misses Mary too because maybe he sometimes thinks of Mary as a mother figure he never had. All those nights at Dean’s house and days riding bikes. With Mary bandaging up his scrapes as any mother would. Maybe part of it was wishful thinking hoping one day she would be - a mother in law at least.
Before making his way towards the soft clamour down stairs, Cas goes to the restroom. Brushing his teeth, and smoothing down his unruly bedhead the best he can.
”Goodnight” he mumbles to Sam and Cas, not caring about their worried expressions, “I’m going back home”
There was so many things Cas wanted to say. Answers he wanted to give Dean. Things he wanted to get off his chest.
That seemed to ease Cas’s anxiety, as he gave a small smile. Dean listened to the old truck as it tried to start “I think I know the problem and can fix it”
Dean snorts at the way Cas puts invisible finger quotes around crap. As if he is reluctant to say a curse word.
Cas looks taken aback by the offer; he looks to the brothers. Sam is the first to speak “You have done so much for us Cas. We will always want you at the bunker, but this is your choice.”
Jack looks to Michael for his reaction, and watches as his expressions darkens to a deadly state. As Lucifer taunts him, his eyes flash blue with grace, and Jack can already feel the waves of power radiating off of him.
'The more you practice the better you get' Sam signs though his aren't as smooth as Eileens they have clearly improved since he showed Dean over Skype during Thanksgiving.
“He brought Lucifer back, destroyed the empty in the process” Michael adds looking away with a crestfallen look. His gaze focus on the floor but his eyes far away, “Didn’t even reach out to me.”
Overwhelmed by everything what did this mean. Dean didn’t care about the makeup. He liked it, and he actually thought enough about Cas to get him more. This couldn’t have been cheap either.
Cas had almost forgotten what he looked like when he almost rode his bike past him at the bank after school one afternoon.
Chuck flips the pages back and forth again, “There is nothing there,” his words are colored with confusion. Face filled with fear as he looks back up at them.
“That bullet to the head - soaked in dead man’s blood,” Sam tells the vampire, who nods his head with a frown.
"What is this Cas," Dean asked in a low almost careful voice as if speaking too loud would cause Cas to run "These boxes"
Castiel looked at the small cup reading the nickname Cas which Dean assigned him ”Thank you, I like the shortened version of my name”
“No problem, I just picked up the most bi things I could find and threw them in the cart” Sam snarks back. Cas laughs amused by Dean’s shocked expression.
He nods in agreement and continues, “He knows somethings up. Wouldn’t take the chance of showing up himself.”
Dinner goes by easily. The two boys with their knees touching under the table. Occasionally feeding each other bites of their food. If only to get a rise out of John, each time, his face shades a deep red. Cas smiles on the inside, glad to get under his skin. Other than John there is laughter and joy.
"What about Sam, and Bobby?" Cas asked about Dean's brother and father figure. though he had to admit there was a bubble of hope, and even if there wasn't. Cas could stand a million more years with his own family if it meant being with Dean.
Dean however choses to ignore his pessimistic statement, saying “Either way he-Miracle is coming home with us,” and lower “Aren’t you boy.”
They turn around to see him, be fitting the third long abandoned Winchester brother. Wearing the same broken, worn expression he always had. The same outfit he once entered hell in too all those years ago “You survived.”
He opens his palm the bird sits there a moment, taking one last look at Castiel before, spreading it wings. It falters in the air for a brief moment before soaring above the trees. Letting out happy chirps. His eyes trail the bird with a proud smile on his face until it disappears into the evening sky. When she does, he falls to his knees. Clutching the small blue feather, she left behind. His head falls to his chest and sobs rack through his small body.
“For your son” Cas shifts his eyes to Bobby as he says it and then back to John, “I understand I may not have been the person you were expecting when Dean told you he was going to bring a date tonight. But I am here for him and I want to know the people that are important to Dean and are a part of his life. And-“
The dogs ears shot up as he heard the name "You love dean"castiel said and jet wagged his tail "he is a good man. He saved my life, you know. He still is every second he let's me stay here"he sighed sadly "I kind of don't want to leave"
"I don't know what that is. I want to just let him go, let him live this life, but I cant...I can't let him go sammy"
"im dean Winchester. This is sam and cas. We're here to help you. The woman you went to see before she was trying to kill you, we just saved your life"
Not long after they pulled up at Bobby's house. They got out and walked towards the door, side by side.
"Listen cas" dean stood up and walked down the steps and then turned to face cas "I'm sorry. I've screwed up your life, you were happy with daphne. You had friends and a good life and i..."
"Thank you dean. Thank you for saving my life, and then keeping me warm. Giving me clothes and feeding me"castiel gestured to his toast.
Emmanuel chuckled and dean looked at him smiling. Emmanuel then looked back up at dean and they looked into each others eyes. Emmanuel looked away once the woman he was previously talking to came over and hugged him.
Emmanuel hugged dean which took him by surprise. After they pulled apart they both just looked at each other.
He didn't stop he pushed his way out of the door. Dean didn't care that everyone in the bar was staring. He chased after cas but he'd already got in a cab and was driving away.
Cas looked away uncomfortably. Dean stopped staring and looked down at his hands. His heart was beating in his chest. This was cas, cas was there stood next to him. But he wasn't looking at him like cas does. It's like he's a different person.
"no. he needed to talk to his wife. He needed to ask her what was the problem, they needed to argue, they needed to yell at each other. Then they needed to either get over their problem or separate. That"cas pointed to danny who was stood close behind dean and running his fingers down his arm "that is not love"
This guy is Emmanuel. Or was it cas. Maybe it was cas but he just didn't remember. What the hell is happening today?
The man smiled and nodded before leaving the room. Castiel usually wouldn't have gone to the strangers house but he had nowhere else and he was freezing.
"Actually"cas sighed "It's because the more time I spent with dean, the more I remembered who I was. With him I was cas, with daphne I was emmanuel"
Sam and Bobby were still worried about dean. They got into their suits and drove to the venue. It was the church were daphne worked. People were outside waiting to go in.
Castiel squeezed his eyes shut and then moved a step back. Balthazar walked back over and hooked his arm around castiel's.
"Yeah.....wierd"Dean replied and looked down at Emmanuel's lips picked his own then faced back to the burger in his hands.
Bobby walked down the stairs and then paused once he saw cas. He smiled and then began to walk slowly towards him.
Dean looked between both of them and then at his hands on the table "if it is cas maybe we can get him back. That's why we are going to the barbecue, to see if it is him. If not then I'll leave it alone, okay?"
Sam put his hand on Deans shoulder to try and comfort him. Dean squeezed his eyes shut to try and stop crying.
"Hey boy"dean laughed as he stroked the sides of jets face. Dean looked over at cas and smiled, castiel smiled widely back.
Castiel was still shaking. His jaw hurt from it shaking so much. His stomach muscles hurt from tensing. His heart hurt from all the extra pressure it was under.
"I should have chosen you sooner. I left it too long. I tried to ignore it, but I should have chose you a long time ago"
Dean took a sip of his coffee and made a happy sound "this is great" he went to take another sip but his house phone rang so Dean walked to the living room to answer it.
Dean smiled Then leaned down and kissed emmanuel. Emmanuel moved his hand and accidently put it in the pie. He held it up and looked at in shock, dean laughed at him and the emmanuel rubbed his hand on Deans face getting cherry all over him.
Dean came into the kitchen ten minutes later. He was wearing dark blue jeans, a black vest and then a plaid shirt which wasn't buttoned up and the sleeves were rolled up his forearms.
A few hours later dean ran down the stairs. He was carrying a huge pile of clothes and he dropped them on the table in the kitchen. Sam and Bobby went in to see what was going on.
"It's nice to meet you. Do you know him baby?"the woman held tightly around Emmanuel's waist and dean felt that hint of jealousy. Even though he should'nt this wasn't cas, it can't be cas.
Castiel looked around and realised they were walking along the bridge where he met dean. Where dean saved his life.
Both balthazar and lisa looked at at dean and castiel to see if that was okay. They both smiled and nodded.
The room was now uncomfortably silent. Dean walked over to emmanuel and stood infront of him. Emmanuel was looking at the ground and crying lightly.
"Since we listened to that song in the car. I can't stop listening to all of their songs"emmanuel chuckled
"yeah. I remember meeting him. his soul shone brighter than anything I had ever seen. They say anegls true forms are the most beautiful things in the world, but his soul. Oh god his soul. It was enough to make any angel stop and stare considering the pain he endured, it shouldn't have shone as bright as it did when they saw it, but it did, because he was a fighter"
Minutes later emmanuel walked into the room and stood at the alter. He spoke with the priest for a second then he locked his eyes with Deans.
He couldn't stop shaking. He was shaking so much the muscles in his arms and thighs hurt. His heart felt like it was working extra hard just to keep his body warm. The clothes he was wearing were offering no warmth but instead making it harder to breathe.
He had no track of time, so he could have been walking for hours or only minutes, but he didn't know. He now found himself stood in the middle of the bridge, over a river. He looked down to see the dark, murky water rushing under the bridge to the other side. He looked back and could barely see anything. Just the other side of the bridge, then trees behind that. A few large building and skyscrapers way down in the background. The world was so quiet. No cars, no people, no animals. It was like the world had been abandoned an he was th on my one left. Th only real sounds were the sounds of rain hitting the ground near his feet and the water from the river rushing down under the bridge.
Castiel was stood in Deans kitchen. Her the dog was sat behind him as he leaned on the counter. The kitchen was long with cupboard all around the walls. A sink and refrigerator at the end of the small room. Dean had been gone for an hour now, he went to talk to his girlfriend.
"It was nice having you around. Now I won't have anyone to make me coffee and breakfast in the morning"dean chuckled and castiel couldn't help but laugh back
Maybe she's an angel. Maybe she's a demon. Maybe she just actually does love cas and doesn't like way you look at him
Dean moaned around his fork full of pie "this is incredible. I might just have to keep you here, lock you in my kitchen"dean joked
He looked around the room. He was sat on a black sofa backed against a white wall. Two other walls were white and then th one with the door on it wa black. In that corner there was a large flat screen TV on the glass stand. A few shelved to the left of that with picture on it. There was a wooden table in the centre of the room, it had an old pie box on it. The window was on the wall opposite the black wall. It was large and covered in black curtains.
Dean looked back up at that and smiled as he saw emmanuel smiling. Emmanuel took one small step to dean.
"You baked? And also had a whole flour factory poured in here"dean laughed as he the flour everywhere.
Dean, sam and cas took danny home. He left pretty quickly and they said their goodbyes. Then they drove back to the motel. It was late so sam and dean went to bed. Cas sat outside on the impala. Dean joined him shortly after. He handed cas a beer and held onto one of his own.
That what this new place was like. Castiel found himself lost in a strange new place. He's never been there. He doesn't know where 'there' is.
Dean struggles to leave Emmanuel alone. Sam tells Dean that he's making a mistake when Dean starts texting Emmanuel. The song towards the end of this chapter is marketed with *. The song is called sorry by Jack garret.
It was soft and slow but it was perfect. Better than castiel had ever expected. Then dean moved his hands to castiel's hips and moved them around slowly so his tail bone was pressed against the tables edge. The kiss got rougher and more frantic. Then dean moved back a little, but their noses were still touching.
They both in a booth at the far corner of the bar. It was the quietest place and out of sight of most people. The seats were next to each other with a table infront of them. Dean ordered both of them beers and they sat drinking.
There was a woman at the end of the corridor. She had long dark brown hair and light makeup on her face.
Dean looked away for a second then looked back into the oven blue eyes of emmanuel"And what do you want to do?
The man who was with the witch stoop up. He pushed deans shoulder and looked angry but then his face changed. He looked down at his hand and then up into deans eyes.
