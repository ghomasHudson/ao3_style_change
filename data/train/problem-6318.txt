The truth, despite whatever the tabloids and the propaganda had said about him over the years, was that Steve wasn’t fearless. It was just that Steve had spent so long being afraid – being weak and fevered and beat to limping, bloody flesh – that the alternative, of hiding and hoping that life would change, was no longer a tenable option. An adrenalin addiction had been the only way to cope. Becoming attracted to that fear was all he had, and when the war came for him it was these tricks and ways of coping that had bore him through, that had carried him into the fray. He unpacks the boxes with shaking hands, finding bayonets and old posters, hats and pins and flags. He unearths maquettes of statues he knows sit all over the country and the world, old sketchbooks, newspaper clippings, an autographed film still. He finds a photo of his mother that he’s never seen before, her eyes laughing and tired all at once, and for a moment he desperately hates Tony for this, for subjecting him to this, to reducing him to this. Then it occurs to him that Tony likely has no idea that he’s here, sorting through relics of the Starks’ shrine to Captain America; the very idea would rouse nothing but fury and terrified shame from him.
Tony thinks.
“Yes, terribly sorry, but I have to borrow Mr. Stark for a moment,” Pepper says smoothly, extending a hand and neatly hooking Tony’s arm. “If you’ll excuse us?”
“Are you ready?” Tony called, grinning, and Steve took a deep breath as Tony raised a remote and a projection appeared on the wall behind him and Pepper. A series of eight zeros flickered, flashed, and then they were cycling, random numbers appearing and disappearing until they stopped on an unlikely combination: 00000007.
Steve blinks, closing his mouth and taking in a wet-sounding breath through his nose. “There’s blood, but yeah. Probably.” He sighs, scrubbing a hand over the back of his head. “God, I hope Bruce doesn’t have to re-break it. Remember that fight with Foolkiller?”
“Are you sure you want to be standing there when I do?”
Tony frowns, because hadn’t he thought something like that before?
“Yeah, oh,” Steve says, wry. He chucks Tony under the chin. “Are you taking care of yourself, at least?”
“That’s plenty of time,” Steve said, turning around in his arms. He grinned as startled delight stole over Tony’s gorgeous face, leaning down to kiss him and speaking quietly against his mouth. “Give me something to look forward to, since you’re gonna be gone all day.”
“Yeah, see, that? That’s why I didn’t tell anyone. I’m not crazy, Stephen. It’s a compulsion, but I can feel it. I know when it’s happening. Captain America didn’t rape me, shit.”
“Hang up, J,” he says, and then he turns back to the software he’s been writing for the lights on the float. “After this is done, I should probably go over there. Make sure everything’s okay.”
Thor is staring at his hands, feet planted flat on either side of where mjölnir lies on the ground before him. His posture speaks of defeat.
Tony watches Steve make his way back to the couch, the broad line of his back limned in the dim light reflected from the television. He goes about the motions of making his coffee, but he can’t seem to stop looking at Steve: a silhouette in the darkness, back stiff and straight and proud, even when he thinks no one is watching.
Steve’s brows raise, but Maria seems unsurprised by this as well. “You know where he is?”
“I take it you’re seeking something like diazepam, and not SSRIs?”
, Steve.”
“Kid,” Clint grunted, loud and firm. “Cap, go home. We’ve got this, and you’re fighting a nasty case of bond-sickness. If Bruce is right and worst case scenario happens, you’ve got a while left of this. You need to rest.”
“There are moments where you’re unhappy,” Steve says, glancing back at the screen. “I can see it, now that I’m looking for it. Don’t lie to me, Tony.”
“I thought you knew!” Tony snaps, waving a hand to gesture between them, at the clear evidence just presented to him. “How the hell is Barnes not in the surveillance footage?”
“That’s kind of my point,” he says, and Steve rolls his eyes.
"I take it you have everything you need to get ready with you?" Steve echoed Tony's question and she nodded over to him, placing the bag from the side of her legs to on her lap.
"Sorry, I've already said, I don't accept bribes or anything of the like. The only thing you can do for me is, step far away from me and give me directions to the nearest Hotel so I can have a shower and get some sleep, hopefully finding this whole thing to just be a dream." her sarcasm showed through and he narrowed his gaze on her, trying to see what she was getting at.
"I've had an average day, nothing of any importance has really happened, except all my friends grilled me because I didn't tell them that it was my birthday tomorrow, and so there throwing a party for me. That's why those two were looking for an outfit." he seemed sheepish, one hand coming up to rub the back of his head.
By the time came around for Steve and Tony to pick Kitana up, you could barely recognise her from before. Before, she was very pretty who did it almost naturally but now, as she wore the dress and heels with nearly all of her hair piled on the top of her head in curls with two framing her face on either side and her make up done as a natural Smokey eye and thin winged eyeliner and red lipstick, she looked something more than gorgeous. Or at least, that's what Steve and Tony thought as they tried to find the ability to form words again.
"No thanks, I have all the time in the world to check out New York, but at the moment all I want to do is have somewhere I can stay." Nodding at her in agreement, they both waited in silence, Tony occasionally glancing over at her. A thought going through both of their head was
Ignoring those two she greeted Steve. "Hey Steve. How's your day gone then?" The smile on his face seemed contagious because she soon held one too.
Pulling back, Steve grabbed Kitana's hand and pulled her over to where Tony stood and smiled, not letting go of her hand, silently asking whether or not he was ready to go.
The same red head spoke up, sneering slightly as she pulled something off the rack and placed it back on again soon after. "My boss is throwing a party just for the sake of throwing a party. It also happens to be one of our mutual friend's birthdays, which he conveniently forgot to tell us about until this morning, so were also going to celebrate that as well. There will be some business associates there that I'll have to deal with, so my outfit will have to be slightly more business than casual, but Natasha can have a casual dress or anything she likes. My boss is paying for the both of us." She carelessly spoke to Kitana, not noticing the frown on her friends face with her attitude towards the owner and how she was only interested in herself.
Walking at a slow pace, looking with wide eyes almost like a child would, she didn't notice what was about to hit her until it happened. A body hit hers at almost full force, knocking her down hard. Landing with a wince on her backside, she glared up and noticed a man equally as wide eyed as she'd been moments ago, only this time in shock and panic.
"I think anything you wear will look good. Now, do you know how to get to Stark towers? That's where the party is being held, up on the roof. Or do you want me to send someone to pick you up? I'm pretty sure Tony won't mind." He seemed so eager that Kitana had to laugh. She smiled widely at him and he smiled back.
Her eyes were wide as she took all of this in. It was like her dream come true. Especially the kitchen. Even though, from a small age, she was made to cook for her relatives, she actually enjoyed doing this and there for to have a whole kitchen to her disposal was wonderful.
rinning mischievously, she pulled her phone out and bought up a new text, selecting Tony's number before writing.
"Alright. Deal. Now show me to a hotel, so we can hopefully never meet again, alright?" She wasn't in the best of moods at the moment and she knew she shouldn't really take it out on him, even though most of it was his fault. Even thought he was cocky and annoying, he seemed like a mostly nice guy, but at the moment, she just wanted to relax and try and figure out what she was going to do.
"You're not looking quite so bad yourself Steve. I'm glad you took my advice and wore those skinny jeans, they look great on you." her voice was exactly the same and it somehow suited her look even more. Steve hadn't stopped blushing once but had found the courage in him to smile over at her and thank her through his blush. Tony was kind of surprised although he knew he shouldn't be. He'd been checking Steve's arse out in those jeans the whole elevator ride down (not that he's gonna admit that anytime soon) and now he knew he had Kitana to thank for that.
"You don't want anything? At all? I don't believe it; any normal person would jump at the chance of me owing them something! So what'll it be? Clothes, shoes, makeup anything you want I can give you!" He grinned the same grin as before, faltering slightly when she just shook her head.
"No, I know where that is. But, I wouldn't mind if I walked in with you. I don't like loads of people staring at me, but if I was with you, it'd be worth it." she knew she was flirting with him slightly, but that morning she'd decided that she could give a relationship with him a try. She'd long since figured out he was on the abornormal side of the spectrum, with him being an Avenger.
Pepper continued before Tony could say anything.
"Thank you for shopping here, I hope you enjoy your party and come back another time if you need anything more." she said that to just about every customer, but she made it seem like she was only saying it to them because she liked them. Her phone ringing bought her out of her thoughts as she watched them walk towards the door.
"Yes Tony, that is a girl you see and yes she is attractive, from both the front and the back. But these are not dates... Or at least I don't think they are. Look Tony, what do you want? I'm kind of in the middle of eating Lunch with Kitana." Realizing what he said, he blushed a little bit but continued to speak. A blush also came across Kitana's face before using her phone again to try and see Tony's face when Steve spoke her name into the phone.
"He's right, Kit you look amazing and I cannot wait for all eye's to be on us as me and Steve walk into the room with the most beautiful woman on our arms. What do you think of that?" she could see he meant every word and for that she didn't try and deny what he said. She may feel pretty, or prettier than she's ever been before, but she didn't feel like they were describing her but then again he never had the best self-esteem in the world thanks to Dumbledore and the Wizarding world. Thanking them both, she remembers the bag she bought over with her and the card and present it held for Steve. Walking back to the vanity, she had to bend slightly because of the heels to grab it and turned around holding it, a bright smile on her face.
A laugh came over the phone and it made Tony frown even more. He didn't know why he kept Pepper on as his secretary, he didn't like her that much, she treated him more as an unruly child than a boss, always making out what she was doing for him was more important that what Tony was doing at all. The only reason he kept her on is because no one else could probably put up with the stuff he did like Pepper does.
Fishing it out of her pocket, she saw that it was Steve calling her like he did every day before they went out to lunch together.
didn't expect her to be having lunch with you. I didn't even know you two knew each other. How did you two meet?" his cheeky personality seemed to re appear again and the other two at the table shook their heads smiling.
She choked back a sob and checked everything had come through with her. The Elder Wand was strapped to right arm, her Holly strapped to her left. The Resurrection stone was around her neck in a necklace, strapped together by a leather cord and the Cloak was tucked in her pocket. After the war, no matter how many times she tries to get rid of them, they'd all find some way back to her eventually. In the end, she gave up and accepted it. She had become the Master of Death, or Mistress as Hel liked to call her. As Mistress of death, she had some control over Death itself and can travel in-between Earth and Hel's dimension.
"You don't have to do that for me. I was going to invite you to the party though. I know you've met Tony and now Pepper and Natasha. And an outfit for you isn't a problem. So, what do you say? Are you going to come?" he seemed so hopeful, that even if she wanted to say no, which she didn't, that she couldn't say no.
"Alright, Kitana's meant to be getting ready for your Party, so why don't we go show her to the room. Natasha might already be there. That was you can get ready and we can give you the thumbs up when you come out, okay?" Tony being Tony, put both of his thumbs up at her, setting off all three of them in a laughing fit. Composing themselves, they stood up and being a gentleman, Steve took her bag for her. Tony leading the way, he took them to the lift and told Jarvis which floor to go to. All three of them were hoping for tonight for go well and end on a high note.
her laugh grated on his nerves and he gritted his teeth at what she was insinuating.
"Would you like to try it on? I believe that, because your hair is a darker red than your companions, that this colour would suit you well. You certainly have the figure for it as well, and the right shoes would make it so you're not stepping on the dress." Kitana questioned, noticing Natasha didn't jump at all, making her think that she'd known she was there the whole time. Turning to the owner of the shop, Natasha showed her a rare smile.
"So Kitana. Since you now know who I am and I know who you are, because I knocked you down, dragged you off and kissed you, taking your first kiss apparently, what would you like in return? Money? Cars? A night with yours truly?" His cocky attitude never ended, going as far as to leer at her and wink at the end.
Interrupting her thoughts, she heard the bell on the door go, watching as two red heads walk in, eyes wide in obvious curiosity. Walking over to them with a modest smile on her face, she introduced herself.
Shaking her head slightly, she skipped over them and thought about the dinner her, Steve and Tony had at the little cafe down the road from her shop. A smile came up on her face, eyes glazed slightly as she though on it. They'd talked more over lunch, sharing nonsensical things about each other, laughing at little stories that Steve and Tony told about each other and genuinely having a good time. Before Tony turned up, she'd been thinking about pursuing a relationship with Steve, but now she's got to know Tony, she wasn't so sure anymore. She liked the both of them, but it also seemed to her that Steve and Tony kept eyeing each other up and they didn't even know it.
"Actually, I would like that. I was thinking of having a black bag to match it but having green shoes. I don't like black shoes; they make my feet seem even smaller than they actually are." Her voice was soft but well-spoken with a slight accent there, but Kitana couldn't quite tell what it was. Ignoring that, she returned the smile and nodded over to the dressing rooms.
"He kissed me to hide from the fans chasing after to him. Took my first kiss he did." she teased Tony about it and caught Steve's slightly shocked look. Tony noticed it too and laughed.
"Go on, say Hi to Jarvis." The grin was still there, making her look wearily at him, seeing a smug look on his face as he proudly told her he was the one who created him. "Hello miss Kitana, it's a pleasure to meet you." The voice came again and this time she was ready for it, no longer trying to find an unknown person but a computer.
A ding bought both of their attentions to the lift and the door opened revealing someone into the room.
Pulling it out a little confused as to who would be ringing him, it cleared up when he saw 'Tony' flashing on the screen.
Turning back to Steve, she noticed him with a smirk on his face and an eye brow raised slightly as he caught her checking Tony out. Blushing slightly, she gave him a quirky little grin back and he let out a little laugh.
"It pretty great isn't it? I mean, I am the one that designed it, you know. Okay, so this is the communal area, this is where anyone who lives here can go. My lab is one floor down but to get in you have to be invited in or have you own special pass code, and my assistant Pepper is the only one with full access, but that's only for the next few days while she tries to find a new job. Which reminds me. Jarvis, Miss Potts is not allowed anywhere with her high access pass code unless it is her own rooms or I am with her or in said room." Nodding to no one in particular and hearing an affirmative from his AI he continued.
Down at the lobby, Kitana stepped through the doors, looking slightly wide eyes at how the inside looked compared to the outside of the building. Stark tower was different to say the least. If the building looked futuristic and technological on the outside, it compared nothing to what it looked like on the inside! Every wall was covered in glass that let you see out but nobody sees in, the chairs and tables looked like something from Alice in wonderland but more comfortable and every employee seemed to have holographic pads, phones or computers, projecting up into the air. It was so different too what Kitana had seen before that she wouldn't even know where to start if she was in there on her own. It seems Tony definitely doesn't do anything by halves.
“I’m fifteen,” Riri said primly, but with an undercurrent of resignation that said she already knew she had lost the fight.
said about you trusting too easily?”
“Get. Out. Of. My. Way,” he bites out, voice cold. Cap wavers, but holds true. “Fucking move!”
Behind him, the sky is lit dark blue and beautiful. His eyes are crinkled closed with laughter. He is still the most beautiful man Steve’s ever seen.
Steve’s eyes flicker to the right, down Tony’s body. Tony can’t imagine the sheet is doing much to hide the state of him. “If you’re sure,” he says, and his voice is mostly exhale.
“Almost done,” Riri said, sounding apologetic now, and Steve closed his eyes.
Steve rubs a hand over the back of his head, frowning out into the dark room. He reaches his arms over his head in a stretch he can’t really feel. He wishes he could see Tony. He wishes Tony could see him. He wishes he could give Tony a kiss good morning, talk about what happened last night. He wishes he could ask Tony why he never chose Steve, if he’d loved him all this time.
They look good, Tony has to admit. His fingers are wound tight in Steve’s hair, grasping white-knuckled as he tips his head back and moans.
“As in, in bed with me.”
At first, Steve was glad that Tony had stopped punishing himself and was relying on his support network again. Now, he isn’t so sure. He thinks, perhaps, Tony reaching out is actually a sign of the darkening skies of his internal landscape. Finding nothing when Friday ran every possible scan she could think of on Steve has been hell on Tony’s confidence in his own sanity. With every day that passes, he looks more haggard. Regardless of whether or not he is provably insane, he isn’t provably sane either. No matter how much he sleeps, he always looks tired. He’s visibly lost weight.
harmless at all, isn’t that the real truth? It hurts people, when alphas talk like that. It hurt
“Okay, okay. Okay. I think maybe I skimped a little on the aftercare this morning. I thought you’d be fine since we spent the night together, but clearly I fucked up, and that’s bad form on my part.” He glances up to see Loki looking quizzical, and Tony takes the moment to step into Loki’s space while his defences are down. He dips his head a little to peer into Loki’s eyes. The words he says next feel foreign in his mouth, but he has the feeling they’re entirely necessary.
“What the heck,” he mutters. He reaches a hand out towards the door, then tries to push his way through like he did with the helicopter. One more step. Just one more step-
“Why don’t you get off your high horse-”
“Now you’re just messing with him,” Steve murmured, but he leaned down for another kiss. And another. He pulled back when Natasha cleared her throat.
“Almost definitely,” he promises. “Come on, handsome. Give it to me right.”
“Fishing for compliments?” Loki asks, twisting his fingers brutally to hit Tony’s prostate, and Tony gasps and bucks up. Loki laughs, low and possessive.
“Okay, first of all, slow your roll so much,” Tony says, putting a hand up. “You do not get to question my relationship with Pepper. No one does, except for Pepper, so you can fuck right off about that.”
“I’m sure he did,” Steve says softly. He can’t imagine how Howard could have done anything else.
It took Steve three more months to go prying into Tony’s secrets.
“He’s…I don’t know that I really have an opinion,” Evan says.
Tony is lying next to him in bed. He’d clearly cried himself to sleep, and Steve stares down at his face. He reaches a trembling hand out to touch, his fingertips dipping into the bags beneath Tony’s eyes, through, to the bone. All he can feel is the faintest sense of warmth.
Steve frowns. Unlike Tony, he’s unwilling to talk with his mouth full.
He doesn’t think he’s ever come this hard in his life.
Rhodey’s mouth is a thin line, and the knee he brushes against Tony’s shakes a little. Still, he leans forward. “I will tell you right now, and this is no exaggeration; no one else in the world could have done that. But if the Avengers don’t have autonomy, they can’t make split-second decisions, or use what the law might deem “excessive force” as needed against enhanced adversaries, or administer untested aerosolised compounds in civilian spaces, or fly abroad to help with the landslide in Colombia as soon as the news breaks.”
The thing that gets Tony the most is how long it takes him to notice.
“It’s just a design, Tony. You can leave off if you want,” he’d tried one night, and Tony had flipped up his welding mask and gave him a look that a lesser man would shrink from.
So, as some of you have noticed, I’ve decided to cut the twins out of the picture for now. Why have I done this thing? Well, firstly, I found the relationship between Steve and Tony had frankly soured too much after Ultron for me to conceivably work with it, because Bruce is right when he chastises Cap in Age of Ultron; Steve trusts an unknown “enhanced” human who has demonstrated mind control powers and then – and this is the important bit for me – enacts violence upon Tony’s person, and Bruce, ***with her help***, after she made Bruce kill a shiteload of people. What? Was that not a red flag for anyone else? Secondly, it was just easier for plot manoeuvring, and you will find out why soon enough. Thirdly – and this is less about plot and more about my personal feelings now – I’m really just 100% not on board with the decision to make two characters that are canonically half-Jewish/half-Romani join the Nazis. As someone who is mixed myself, and grew up in a heavily Jewish city with a large proportion of Jewish friends, I’m just not. I was pissed that they did so when the news first came out, and I’m still kind of pissed about it now. So whatever characterisation of the twins that might be appearing or not appearing, it won’t be with the “we joined Hydra” backstory. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Sorry to any folks that liked angst and eyeliner Wanda. (Personally I like Ultimates’ mathematician Wanda better, but now I’m just being petty.) Feel free to disagree with my politics at great length and at your leisure, of course. All criticism welcomed.
, now?” Loki asks. His eyes gleam dangerously, a green that makes Steve think inexorably of snakes and poison. “Did you think that because I went to my knees for you, you held dominion over me?”
“Right,” Tony said, but his eyes were soft, now. Steve leaned in closer, enough that their noses brushed together. He swallowed. “The fridge door is beeping.”
“This is more important than your continued-”
Eventually, the candle is burning in a bowl filled with thick sludge. Steve can’t smell it, but whatever it is makes Tony wrinkle his nose curiously, his perfectly arched black eyebrows winging down to sit in thunderous creases over his closed eyes.
“Okay,” Bruce says patiently. “But if you could-”
“Steve, what are you
“Okay,” Tony says. He lets Steve guide him upstairs, almost as if in a trance, or a dream. He keeps sneaking peeks at Steve’s face, almost as if he can’t believe he’s real. Steve knows the feeling. He can’t bear to stop touching Tony’s skin, even if it draws attention when they pass Sam and Clint in the hall. Sam just touches Tony briefly on the arm, smiles at him, lets them go by without a word. He hurries Clint away in the other direction, and so Steve is able to ferry Tony up onto the penthouse balcony without much interruption. He sits Tony down, then pops into the kitchen to ask Jarvis to make some hot tea. He brings out a thick warm blanket, and then he takes it all out and wraps both of them up in it. He presses the warm ceramic into Tony’s trembling hands.
“Did I interrupt something?” she asks. Tony doesn’t need to turn around to see Steve’s telling flush; the delighted glitter of Natasha’s eyes betrays him. “Take a seat at my table, boys.”
He remembers the first time he and Steve made it to a bed—Steve’s body curled around his, warm and safe.
He pulls out the little blood tester that he and Bruce retrofitted—left over from his palladium poisoning days—and pricks his finger, feeding a hefty drop of blood into its mouth. The results come back the same. He’s in a nascent bond, and his cortisol levels are rising. His body wants him to finish claiming his mate.
He stands there for a long moment, sipping his drink and feeling like an idiot. “Call Thor?”
“Boss, I really think you should call someone.”
“Yeah,” he says. “We haven’t had much time to ourselves.”
Or maybe,
“So I’ve been told,” Steve had sighed, easy, but Howard had just shaken his head.
“Agent Romanov is on her way. She says to tell you that she comes bearing a black eye, ‘the good stuff.’”
“Can I ask a question?” Steve asked, biting his lip. He’d wanted to know for so long, and now seemed as good a time to ask as any.
Tony laughs. “Okay, Cheech. I know you cooked this up.”
“Listen to you,” Tony says, and he can’t stop himself now. He’s drunk on power, and his orgasm is so far off—a freight train still climbing a mountain in the distance. For once, he’s the one who could go all day. “Begging so loud and shameless. Can you hear yourself?”
JARVIS sounds alarmed, but also confused, and Tony takes a deep breath before lifting one hand to wave away his question, the other swiping over his face.
“I know you’ve gotten spoiled, what with the other Avengers picking up the slack—you know me, anything to get out of doing my real job and go blow something up instead,” more laughter, “but Miss Potts insisted, so here I am. I know I’m no Thor, but just remember, he’s married, and I’m unattached.” Tony lifted left hand, wiggling his fingers, and Steve swallowed heavily. It was almost like Tony
, from
Loki sips his scotch, smiles wickedly. "I think you know the answer to that, as well."
“He woke up, and Loki had bounced.” Tony begins to laugh, quiet and somewhat hysterical. “Oh my god, that bastard.”
, and then Steve had been forced to run and get a roll of paper towels because apparently his tears are radioactive. Steve had put a trash bag full of stained green paper towels into a metal container in Bruce’s lab marked with a biohazard symbol. Eventually, full and exhausted, Hulk had fallen asleep.
Tony sucks in a sharp breath. He blinks, fat tears rolling out of his eyes, down to soak into the pillow. A sob works its way out of his throat.
"I know you haven't-"
Tony, predictably, doesn’t notice. He stares at his reflection in the mirror. He looks tired, dark bags welling up under his thick lashes. Tony’s got movie star eyes, something Steve has always been just a little bit fascinated by. Steve knows he can’t pull off sultry or brooding the way Tony can, and he has the strangest urge to cup Tony’s face and run his thumb over the edge of them: let the gentle, butterfly-wing’s sensation of them skim over his skin.
The first was Tiberius Stone’s parents. They were everything the media said they would be: coiffed, beautiful, perfectly matched. A textbook alpha male/omega female couple, they’d passed their perfect genes on to their son. Ty was an almost unbelievably conventionally attractive alpha: gleaming, wavy blond hair and blue eyes. Broad shoulders. A crooked grin. He’d had Tony wrapped around his finger from day one, and Tony had been utterly helpless to him. He’d shown Obeisance to Ty as easy as breathing, and Ty had abused it. Then Ty cheated on him, and the relationship had disintegrated in a terrifying flashbang of slammed doors and the kinds of terrible things that could not be unsaid.
“This does not meet my definition of harm,” Loki explains. He sounds tired, as though he is explaining a simple concept to a child.
Steve nods against Tony’s shoulder. “Fair enough.”
It’s been less than a month. He’d forgotten that, until now. He and Loki had been dancing around each other, flirting, for months, but from the time they’d first slept together to now had been less than a month.
“Consider yourself ignored.”
“Tony,” Steve says slowly, and Tony turns back to him with a frown. Steve’s eyes are wide, almost frantic. “Isn’t the UN committee meeting on the accords happening soon?”
“Yeah,” Steve says, “it is.”
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the fic!! Let me know what you thought. This one was hard to end for me. :<
Reed smiles: it’s an uncanny, wise sort of smile. There is an age to him that separates him from Tony. If asked, Steve might attribute it to his years of fatherhood. He’s been the patriarch of a family longer than he’s been a childless superhero now, and it shows sometimes in little ways. He’s never had the boundless enthusiasm and spark that makes Tony run and run and run until he collapses under his own exhaustion.
“You’ll adjust,” Bruce told him.
“I know,” Pepper says, impatient. “That’s what I’ve been telling you. It doesn’t help that we’re harbouring the international poster boy for Most Wanted Megalomaniac.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, slowly. “I’m learning that.”
“You don’t have Extremis anymore.”
Peter rears back as though Strange has slapped him. “You’re a miserable, callous man,” he tells Strange. It’s a shockingly angry sentence from Spiderman, but that was a shockingly harsh truth, even from Strange. “At least I did something, instead of hiding in the arctic circle.”
Now, he was standing at the doorway to the workshop with his fists clenched at his sides, not sure if he was strong enough for this next part. He didn’t exactly know how it would feel to walk into the workshop without Tony there, blasting music and welding something or other, but he knew it wasn’t going to be good. He knew Clint would have come with him if he’d asked, but he didn’t know if he wanted an audience for this part, either. He felt like his skin was on too tight.
“Move your ass!” Tony calls back. He’s got work to do.
“I lived through the AIDS crisis,” Tony says bluntly. “The stakes were higher even just a few years ago. Steve likes women well enough. He wanted a family. It’s easier, for some men, to pretend like that’s all there is. Especially when you’re a public figure.”
Tony has been fiddling with a vast array of sensors for the past few days, trying to find what it is that’s projecting Steve into Tony’s brain.
Something occurs to him, then: a strange thought, something like embarrassment skittering over him as he processes it.
Tony pressed a hand flat against the glass, and Steve walked to him and met the gesture. The pain that blazed through his chest at the action was expected, the desire to have his alpha’s skin pressed against his less than sexual: just sheer, animal desperation for his mate. It was enough to white his vision out, his ears filled with a surging roar, the ground tilting beneath his weakening knees.
“And what did he say?”
“You look like shit,” Bruce observes. Tony snorts and sits up, taking the cup from him.
Tony blinks. It doesn’t sound like the first time JARVIS has asked for his attention. “Yeah, sorry J.”
“Sir,” JARVIS says, perturbed. “An unidentified woman has just appeared outside demanding Mr. Odinson come and face her. She seems to be wielding magic similar to Mr. Laufeyson’s.”
Steve shifts, just the barest rustle of fabric to betray his movement. There’s an uncomfortable pause, and Tony wonders what exactly the content of that discussion was like.
“Do you need me to come up right now?”
Tony laughed, shaking his head. He pulled off his still-damp britches and shirt, leaving himself only in his underclothes. He hung his clothes to dry on the back of the chair, then slipped into bed. Rogers was quick to bundle him close, the warm length of his body pressing up against Tony from behind, chest to spine, thigh to thigh. Tony let out a soft sigh of pleasure at the warmth of him, nestling back into Rogers’ embrace.
A tug, and then something he can’t describe; like the non-Euclidean geometry of the Chitauri mass, maybe, or the unsettling feeling of numbness and pressure that had washed over him as he passed through the portal to space. He closes his eyes, and when he opens them he’s standing on the tower landing pad in Manhattan, as though nothing had happened and he’d never left.
“Et tu, Brute?”
“You’ll take exactly what I give you, won’t you?” Tony asked, and Steve could feel his eyes watering from the pleasure as he nodded. “You’re mine, and you’ll take what I give you and you’ll thank me, won’t you?”
“What thing?” she snaps, and Tony closes his eyes and tries to get it together. “I’m trying to get to a very important meeting with the EPA, Tony-”
He’d been counting on having Cap at his back for the coming negotiations. He was not looking forward to having to tangle with Ross without the weight of Cap’s disapproving stare on his side.
“Does he have somebody he really likes to work with?” Steve asked, because now that he thought about it, of course Tony would have a jewellery guy.
Tampa, FL 33612
The grin that Tony offered him was wolfish, and Bruce cleared his throat uncomfortably.
Tony smiles into the space between his folded arm and the table.
“I don’t know if ‘want’ is really the word I’d use there, Mata Hari.”
Steve looks at her, expression one so naked it almost makes Tony uncomfortable to see. Natasha stares back solemnly. “What do you mean?”
“Why are you so calm about this?” Pepper demands, glaring at him. Tony shrugs, swallowing a mouthful of yoghurt.
“It’s not your fault,” Tony said, gently, and that- that was just embarrassing. Steve took a shaking breath, rubbing a hand over his face.
"Yes," Loki says in his ear.
“Yes, dear.” He clears his throat. “I sense I’ll be strong-armed into a bit of rest, so I may be sleeping when you come by. Just wake me up, of course.”
“I can wake you if Mr. Laufeyson, Mr. Odinson, or Captain Rogers make an appearance,” JARVIS offers, and Tony hums, considering.
“A moment’s rest,” Loki says, and Tony can’t argue with that. He lets Loki touch him, exploring his body with gentle fingers. It feels nice enough. He closes his eyes. “You’re a singular creature, Tony Stark.”
The bathroom door opens, and Tony cracks one eye to the sight of Steve carrying a clear plastic takeout container full of sea salt.
“Don’t you think me being in bed with you implies a bit of an adrenaline addiction?”
Behind his eyes, he sees Steve Rogers as he first truly saw him: pulling off the cowl in the cramped SHIELD jet, and with it releasing a cloud of alpha battle pheromone, fierce and unapologetic. There was something wild about him that was almost beautiful in that moment. A warrior of old, myth come to life. It was like returning to lucidity while dreaming and understanding, suddenly, the absurdity of the life you thought you’d been living. Steve was something gleaming and purely himself. It hurt Tony to even look at him.
“Tony-”
“Let me stay here,” Steve finds himself saying. “Just for the night. We don’t have to do anything, I just…I don’t think we should be alone, tonight. Either of us.”
“When do you have to leave?” he asked, knowing he sounded plaintive and not giving a damn.
Steve presses a kiss to the back of his head.
“I didn’t take you for a sweet and intense kinda guy,” Tony goads, and Loki smirks at him and moves even
“Shut up,” Steve says, and then he kisses him, because he doesn’t know what else do to. He kisses Tony hard, teeth clacking unattractively before he’s able to get the angle right, but that seems fitting for this moment. He pours everything he’s felt since his death into the kiss: his anguish, his frustration, his anger, his tenderness. His sorrow, guilt, grief. He lets it all go, and Tony just takes it. He takes it, and he holds Steve in his arms, and he lets him come apart.
If someone cared enough to ask Steve if he thought the future would be this different, he might laugh and never stop. Because it wasn’t the cars, or the airplanes, or even Tony’s mind-shattering science that was unbelievable. It was the fact that every social interaction before he went into the ice had been clear-cut, because dynamics said more than simple, clumsy human words ever could. It had been how he led the Howling Commandos—a strong streak of empathy, enough to be able to read someone’s scent and know exactly what they needed to be effective in the field. Bucky’s acidic beta stress scent said he wasn’t sleeping well, and so Steve knew that he needed someone to sit by the fire and razz him until his cheeks ached because that was the only way to stave off the nightmares. The sweet and sour scent of Jim’s wavering fury/fear usually meant that there had been more bad news from back home about the internment camps. Steve had known that meant Jim could probably use a quiet walk around the base, with the reassurance that his captain wouldn’t let him be sent packing and locked up on a bullshit dishonourable discharge. He’d known all of his men, down to the barest fluctuation of their base scents. It was an easy intimacy as old as humanity: to know your pack, and care for them, as was the alpha’s eternal honour.
Steve glances up at him, startled. “Yeah?”
Steve woke up with Tony’s fingers pressed inside him, three wide, circling maddeningly over his sweet spot. He was halfway to an orgasm already, the sight of Tony’s mouth wrapped around his cock getting him to the edge quicker than he’d have thought possible when he was so spent.
A visible shudder moves through Steve’s body in a wave. His eyes snap shut, his whole body shaking in Tony’s grasp. The sound he makes is close to a whimper. “
“I’ve provoked you.”
What had happened was this: Tony and Rogers had apparently been volunteering at a youth centre, teaching self-defence classes. When he’d asked why they had free time to volunteer post-apocalypse, Rhodey had just given him a look and said that it had been a year, and if they didn’t find things to keep them sane, there was no way they’d be able to fix what had been broken before. He’d said it with the strangest look on his face, as though there was some irony to what he was saying. Tony, of course, had no idea what he was talking about, because he
Clint waves a hand over his shoulder in response, disappearing around the corner towards the maintenance stair to the roof. Steve watches him go with what he expects is a mournful expression, because what he feels for Tony makes him want to run and hide, or on some days, level a building. Instead he turns around and puts a hand on the side of the doorway. He meets Tony’s unreadable expression with aplomb, straightens his shoulders.
all(beyond win
“Thor, I want you on Executioner. Hawkeye, it’s gonna be your job to take out as many doombots as possible while also keeping Amora too busy to hit. Stay out of range.”
“Come on,” Tony says, but Steve shakes his head. He pulls away, sits back on his heels.
Tony gestures vaguely at his body. “You didn’t sign up for-”
Steve shrugs, a bitter smile coming to his lips. “I wouldn’t know,” he says. “No one wanted me then, either.”
Tony waits, frowning when it goes to voicemail again. He doesn’t know why there’s no one home to pick up the phone at all, not even Wong or Clea.
“Well, we’ve established that I can’t do it,” Tony said, sliding smoothly into one of the stools at the island. He rested his chin on his hands, his eyes lowering to half-mast. “You said you were free all day.”
“Steve?” Tony says again, voice wrecked, and Steve nods against his face. “What-”
“Yes,” Loki says, grinning wickedly, and Tony rolls his eyes at the pun.
“Should’ve called Rhodes,” Natasha intoned. Steve didn’t tell her that he had wanted to be the one to rescue Tony this time. He knew it was petty, but also this was Natasha. She probably knew exactly why he’d made this choice, and was rubbing his nose in it.
“Okay,” Natasha says, holding up a hand. “You boys can bicker later. Loki, where is Steve?”
superhero. A good one.”
“Who knows about this?” Tony asks, tapping the arc reactor absently.
“Oh God,” he says. “My God.”
Tony nods. He tilts his head to the side, curious, and then his brows lift in surprise. A faint flush appears, just the barest hint of it across the bridge of his nose. Steve is uncommonly fascinated by the sight. He doesn’t think he’s ever seen Tony blush before. Steve didn’t think he even could. He wonders what it is he’s feeling.
because of course it is.
—before Thanos killed half of all life in the universe was. Well, it was a lot to process.
“I think you will enjoy Spirited Away. It is about a young girl transported to the spirit world, working to save her parents from a witch’s curse.”
Tony makes a face, thankful for the elevator ding. He waves a hand as he steps out and heads for the workshop stairs. “In my defence,” he says, “Pepper told me to. And anyway, ‘enemy’ is kind of harsh, don’t you think?”
he makes. It’s broken and desperate and utterly lovely, all at once.
“Better than dead,” Tony retorts. The expression on Pepper’s face is tired, withering, and Tony lets out a rough breath, fiddling with his tie where it falls over the reactor. “Teresa Alvarez went back for her dog, who she’d left in a warm parking spot with the windows cracked like a good dog mom. His name was Sunny. She was four months pregnant.”
“I bet Steve would be the one to make a move,” Beth says. “That was pretty smooth of you, though, good job. I concede with grace.”
“Or thousands of years old indigenous medicine, but ok.”
“Iron-Man, get to the roof. That’s an order.”
“I have something,” Tony says, slowly. The very thought of it chills him, makes him want to retch up all of the rice noodles and shrimp and vegetables he’s just consumed, but he maintains a steady hand as he pulls out his phone. “I had all the prototypes destroyed except for one, but I can get to it. Pepper can get to it.” He grimaces. “We can use it on Barnes, too.”
Tony is silent as he works. It’s one of the only times he is: all of that manic, whirlwind energy focussed in, a hurricane narrowed down into a tornado. In the beginning, he’d blasted music so loud Steve’s head ached, but once Steve started spending the afternoons down here he’d turned it down to more manageable levels, or put on headphones. It was such a minimal thing, but it means a lot to Steve, because it shows that Tony is trying. Despite everything, he’s willing to make concessions, however small.
Welp this got so fucked up and depressing. I’m really sorry everybody. Like I said, I thought this was gonna be the “confession! happy ending!” instalment but then seasonal depression was like “heyyyy remember me” and so here we are with…this, I guess. Fuck.
“Obviously.”
“I’m gonna stuff you full,” Tony promises, and Steve groans and tries to push back against him.
When Steve pulls back, his mouth is red and gleaming wet. He looks utterly debauched, and Tony can feel his hips rock forward without his meaning to at the sight.
“Tony,” Steve says, helplessly. Blue eyes flick back to the screen, lidded dark with anguish. “I ordered you to do things. While we-… while I was touching you. I ordered you to let me touch you. I ordered you to let me tie you up.”
“Uh huh,” Peter says, and Tony blinks up at him.
“Ah,” Tony says, caught out.
“Thanks?” he tries. Tony leans in and takes as much of him into his mouth as he can in reply.
After the parade, the float gets parked in the Memorial Park below Avengers Tower, dedicated to all of the civilian lives lost in the battle against supervillains/alien invaders/vengeful gods/etcetera the world over. Tony had been firm about that when The Avengers had moved in. The SI Saint Patrick’s Day planning committee had been remarkably efficient at getting a small fair kind of thing going, fit as promised with educational information about the history of Irish American immigration and Irish American contributions to New York City. Some booths offer food, and the lawn is crawling with hyper-engaged children ready to pose for photos.
“Fight smarter, not harder,” he mutters, petulant, and Pepper snickers. “We don’t have a lot to stand on here, Pep.”
“Before…before we even bonded, I knew. Since the day I asked you to, in front of the team.”
In the back, a huge platform sits, with a little tucked-away hub hidden by backdrop and skyline where Tony will be running the controls. All of the SI team members who were interested have a place on the float, lining the sides all around, and Tony climbs up into the back to do a few last minute checks on everything. He wants to make sure the colours on the Empire State building are going to light up the way he wants them to, and he sits down at his station and runs through a few of the settings just to double check everything is as expected.
“Neither have
“I’ve had heat sex before, without taking the precautions,” Tony admitted, sounding guilty now. “I’m, uh. I can control myself. But this way, if it happens, it happens.”
“Good old Ulrich,” Tony says, shaking his head. He takes a slow breath, rubbing a hand over his mouth in thought. “This is a double-edged sword. Before, this was relatively quiet. No one pays attention to the UN mandates. Loki’s forcing my hand. I’m gonna have to talk to the team about this, if it’s running on Fox News.”
“Sir, yessir,” Tony says easily, saluting the air. Clint tosses a pinch of flour at him, and Tony ducks. “Hey!”
"Only if you promise to teach me the names for all your armour bits," Steve bargains, and Tony laughs.
“Tony,” Steve groans, and then he’s easing Tony’s legs down.
“Oh, really?” Tony asked, and the low, dangerous greed in his voice was enough to make Steve moan weakly. “You want me to use you, even after you’ve tapped out? Want me to fuck you while you’re sleeping, until you’re full, until you wake up on my knot-”
“I- can you stop doing that and look at me?”
. And your ma. And I never said anything to him, because he was my friend. I knew it was wrong, and I let him go on like that. So aren’t I responsible for that?”
“What-?” Clint talks right over him, but that’s alright; he’s used to that, these days, and Steve is pretty sure he already knows the answer.
Tony is sure Steve can feel his pulse against his fingers, heavy as hoofbeats on the Belmont racetrack. He turns his head, and meets Steve’s eyes for the first time since he walked out onto the landing pad. Steve’s fingers tighten around his wrist, and for a breathless moment, it feels as though they’re falling.
“So you were blazed out of your mind-”
"Don't mention it," Tony says, when the silence has dragged on for too long. He ducks his head, fiddles with the end of a pair of forceps. "I've found myself paying attention when Pepper talks about art, which I'm sure has absolutely nothing to do with you. Tell me what the hell luminism is while I try to get this couter to work properly."
"What? Et tu, Brute?" Clint looks at Bruce, who shrugs.
“The UN is in the middle of coming up with a proposal for oversight. For us, and any future groups like us. I’ve been dealing with the US government’s pressure on that front since the Potomac Crash, but saving you was a dangerous op for our own self-interest. We went in to save one of our own, and we got people killed. It was the last straw.” Tony takes a breath, putting one hand over Steve’s mouth to forestall his questions. “Listen to me, Steve.” His eyes are wide in his face, beseeching as he leans in. “They are talking registration of all enhanced individuals. Every mutant. Every science experiment. Every techno-genius. Do you know what the Overton Window is? Ross has been talking about this stuff since The Hulk came out of the gate. He has been steadily pushing this agenda for six years, and now he is the
He goes to look at his body, but there’s nothing particularly exciting to see there. Just the same pane of glass, slightly frosted with cold, his body’s pale bluish face beneath it.
“Why?”
The ocean was cold even in summer. Steve always seemed to forget about that until he got in the water, and the Pacific was particularly freezing. Tony had spent the morning teaching him how to surf, putting on this skin-tight wetsuit that made Steve want to roll over and beg. Of course, he had to wear one too, and Tony had looked at him like he wanted to devour him, so maybe that was alright.
“Please,” Steve said, rolling his eyes. “You’ve already spoiled us all with gadgets. You built Banner his own personal lab.”
“It’s almost time,” Bruce said. “He’s probably backstage with Pepper.”
. “Let- uh. Can I?”
Then Peter told him: “Tony’s being an idiot.”
“Come on,” Tony says, and then whines as Loki adds a fourth finger. The stretch is good, and unnecessary, and entirely maddening. “Loki.”
“Nothing,” Tony says, and Stephen raises both his eyebrows at him.
“I don’t mind,” Steve says, and Tony swallows audibly.
“Call incoming from Colonel Rhodes.”
“How kind of you, sir.”
A/N: Look at me, actually updating! I haven’t seen the new movie yet (I know, I know, I’m waiting for the weekend so my brother can be out of school) so plz no spoilers.
Reminder that the next work in this series will have a happy ending, even if this one doesn't! I promise it will all work out.
“I like them,” Tony had told him, but Steve had just shook his head, pressing tender kisses to Tony’s thighs, his hip.
“The most incredible thing is that I actually love you for your personality even when you look like this,” Tony murmurs, his eyes travelling unabashed over Steve’s body as he shimmies out of his pants, leans over to show Tony the toned curve of his ass as he works them off his ankles. Steve grins sweetly at him over one slab-cut shoulder.
Steve moaned, his whole body lit up from the inside as Tony’s stream of wicked praise washed over him in waves. He could feel Tony’s knot swelling now, catching slightly on Steve’s lips every time he pulled out, and he’d be fine if that was what Tony wanted. He wanted to taste him. He wanted to be good for his alpha.
Tony quirks a half-smile, glancing out over the city. A red tailed hawk glides by, slow and gorgeous in the afternoon sun.
Tony scrubs a hand over his face, then heads out into the central courtyard where they left the suits on sentry mode. Outside, a few cadets are posing for photos with the War Machine rig, but they startle when Rhodey claps his hands together.
“Sheriff. To what do I owe this pleasure?”
“That exactly proves my point, though, doesn’t it?” Tony asked her. “We have a glaring dynamic hierarchy in most countries, with male alphas at the top, then female alphas, all the way down to male omegas at the very bottom of the list. The domestic violence statistics from RAINN in this country are fantastically depressing, Christine, and we’re supposed to be an example of freedom and justice or whatever to the rest of the world. Anti-dynamicism is about levelling that playing field. The primary way my dynamic has at all affected my life is because certain people feel that they have a right to know intimate details about my body that are, ultimately, none of their business. I created the best WMDs in the world for years, and back then they assumed I was an alpha. Now I create prosthetic limbs and cell phones, and they say I must be an omega because I’m soft-hearted. It’s all sexism. What do my reproductive organs have to do with either of those things? Are alphas not allowed to have a conscience? The omega soldiers protecting U.S. advisor John O. Brennan in Yemen this week are certainly just as capable as their alpha and beta counterparts.”
Steve opens his mouth, then closes it again. There are so many things he wants to say, most of them angry, but he also knows that none of them are fair. He’s trying to be more careful of the things he says, after seeing what his one thoughtless comment had done to Tony. Sure, he could tell Xavier about all the horrible things he saw, but he’s right; that’s not in conflict with his point at all.
“I love you,” Steve speaks against his mouth. “Bring me back to you.”
Tony raises an eyebrow. He pulls his head back away from the armour, turns to look at the holoscreen.
“It looked like it barely caught her forearm,” Bruce said, flipping forward a few frames to see where Williams went down, clutching her arm. Now that Steve was watching, the motion looked exaggerated. She was faking being more hurt than she was.
Tiredness takes him over in a wave. An undefinable sensation builds in his mouth.
“Oh,” Tony said, struck silent with wonder. “I don’t know who they oughtta feel more sorry for, then, Sheriff. The town drunk, or the good sheriff who’s only got the town drunk to tell his sorrows to?”
“Why are you asking me stupid questions?” Tony says tiredly. “Look, I have a lot of work I need to catch up on, so-”
“He can melt any kind of metal?” Natasha says, brow furrowed. “Only metal? How does that not melt the flesh off, too?”
“Bond Stress-induced cardiomyopathy can be fatal over time, sir. I strongly recommend you speak to someone.”
Tony wandered out not much later, barefoot and yawning. His hair was a wreck, a hickey visible just below his bondmark, and the low roll of arousal that washed over Steve was expected and familiar.
talking about?”
bit of a kink.
reactions, was a black and white picture of Tony wearing a white t-shirt with a symbol Steve had never seen before on it, framed in the V of an unzipped, oversized black leather jacket. From the viewer’s perspective, it looked like that was the only clothing he was wearing at all.
Tony studies him for a long moment, wetting his lips. He glances at the screen, then back at Steve.
“Nice ride.”
“I would suggest you move to the heat room.”
And that’s the million dollar question, isn’t it? Tony reaches a shaking hand out for his drink, curling his fingers around it and taking a long drag. Steve reaches out a tentative hand, placing it on the inside of his wrist just for a second. It’s enough to calm the shaking, and Tony offers him a small, grateful look.
“Good morning, sir. It is 10:00 AM on Saturday, April 16
he thinks, suddenly. The thought settles inside of him like a stone falling to the bed of a lake.
. How could he not know you loved him?”
“Wanna talk about it?” Tony says, finally, when he can’t bear the silence anymore. Steve lets out a breath, sketches out a wrinkle at the corner of Tony’s lips. They’re curled into something halfway between a grimace and a smile. He doesn’t look at Tony once to check his lines, and Tony wonders if the image is that firmly imprinted in his mind. Perhaps he just knows Tony’s face that well.
“The floor, it’s kinda rough on you, isn’t it?” Steve says knowingly, and Tony sketches out a tired sigh.
, Tony,” Bruce says, a small smile playing around the corner of his mouth. “That’s what I’m telling you. Steve is treating you like his alpha. He won’t ask anything of you. He’s waiting for you to ask him.”
, Tony thinks, then fights back a grin. He doesn’t think Loki would appreciate it.
“Steve,” Tony groans, and Steve laughs, wicked and low against his skin. He traces his fingers over Tony’s hips, his hands moving over his body like his clothes aren’t even there. He hadn’t tried to touch him like this when Tony was fully clothed. All the other times Tony had undressed himself, had placed his handsome naked body into Steve’s care with all the reticence of a frightened animal. So he’s never noticed that before, that he can’t feel Tony’s clothing when he touches him. Only his skin, warm and smooth and alive.
“I don’t trust her,” Bruce says, but he’s smiling as he says it.
When the movie ends, Steve chances a glance at her. Her eyes are still on the credits.
“We’re not dating, and he’s a big boy,” Tony argues, knowing how petty he sounds. “Honestly, he won’t understand. Cap’s not the virginal boy scout we pretend he is for kicks, but he’s not the sleeping with the enemy for intel guy either.” Natasha doesn’t disagree with him, and Tony thinks it over in his head, nibbling his lip. “He’s too polite to ask who I’m fucking, even if he suspects it’s Loki, and especially after a blowout fight like that. Plausible deniability, for now.”
“You’re gonna rot your gut straight through one of these days, Stark.”
“JARVIS, I’m serious about that Star Spangled Man thing. Make it happen.”
“Maybe for idiots who don’t think omegas who can bench-press an SUV are smoking hot,” Tony retorted. “And who cares about idiots?” He pulled up his pants, now faintly wrinkled, then tucked his shirt in before closing everything back up. The overall affect was still devastating, because while the charcoal suit was tailored beautifully and fit him like a glove, he definitely looked debauched.
What was startling was Tony’s reaction. His brain scans hadn’t betrayed any abnormalities. By all measures, Tony is processing information as normally as possible for someone of Tony Stark’s calibre. But the discovery that there is nothing to suggest that Tony has been hallucinating was not enough to soothe Tony’s frayed nerves. If anything, it sent him into overdrive. More than once Jim has come into the workshop to find Tony strung out on too much coffee and too little sleep, his hands shaking. He is a master of soothing Tony’s tattered nerves, of gentling him into rest. A small, bitter part of Steve knows that this is something Jim has seen and done many more times than he can know, and it makes him jealous enough to want to dig his fingers into Tony’s hips, his wrists, and leave his mark there.
“Good,” Sam says putting the glass on the drying rack. “Captain America makes mistakes sometimes. Reminds everyone that you’re human, somewhere in there.” He turns off the kitchen light, then heads for the stairs, trusting Steve to follow.
A tug towards the hall distracts Steve, and he fights it a little, wanting to see what happens next. But then the tug happens again, harder.
Tony clears his throat, and Steve’s face snaps up. He can feel himself blushing, and when he looks at Tony’s face, Tony’s staring straight at him. His expression is complicated, like he doesn’t know what’s going on, or where he is.
Well.
Then Tony blinks, mechanically, exactly once. It’s an expression Steve remembers from when Tony had Extremis: a visual marker of Tony’s brain saying
“Open your mouth,” he said, and Steve’s eyes snapped open.
A G A I N
"What kind of New Yorker are you?" he demands. He pushes play, and the swelling sounds of a big brass band envelop them, loud and triumphant.
“Not that I’m aware of.”
“It seems I have caused some dissention in the ranks.”
“Nobody here was born yesterday,” Bucky tells him.
“Pot n’ kettle, Spidey. Or was it another web-slinging hero who started at the ripe young age of 15?”
. Completely lose his temper in the helicarrier lab (part 2) which was probably because he’d managed to figure out that Tony wasn’t impressed with him and the alpha in him couldn’t bear the thought.
“I’m trusting you,” Steve said, but he turned to Thor. “You’re the strongest on the team, and you’re indifferent to our scents. You might be the one who has to keep me down.”
Tony yawns into his coffee cup. “Mmph.” He rubs a careless hand across his nose. “Sorry. Morning, Luke. Morning, Tiny Human.”
H U R T S
Tony blinks, slowly, exactly once.
“Tony,” Rhodey says, voice quiet and breathless, and Tony remembers, suddenly, that no one knows what he has just done. Loki was the only one.
“Tell me when you’re ready for me. I’ll call SHIELD for clean-up.” Bruce wasn’t even trying to hide his laughter.
Tony grimaces. He reaches up, feeling around the bridge. “It’s gonna hurt.”
“I could not begin to guess, but I suppose human courtship is beyond my parameters.”
“What do we do, baby?”
“I got so fucking high I couldn’t feel my toes?”
Pepper smiles at him in surprise and takes his hand as she steps off the plane and onto the metal staircase. Her hair whips around in the wind, long strands curling around her neck, and Tony beams back at her. She's sporting a few new freckles, and he can see the hint of a sunburn under the sheer sleeves of her white blouse. She pauses on the lower steps as he walks her down.
“We can afford it,” Tony says, embarrassed. “Denham’s a sweetie.”
Steve considered the question seriously. On the one hand, the knowledge that his mate lay just on the other side of the door made him want to tear through the metal plating with his teeth and hands alone. But it was a distant ache, like a bruised rib, and he took in a shaky breath and stepped back. Then he took another. And another.
“Sir, should I reboot?”
He feels more like blown glass right now.
Steve fairly melts into Tony’s lap. He buries his face into his neck, wraps around him like an octopus. He never wants to let go.
“We’re not asking for you to look for magical residue, we’re telling you to look for his ghost-”
“That’s your first problem, then, isn’t it?” Pepper asks, not unkindly, and Steve glances up to stare at her from beneath his furrowed brows. “Have you read Plath’s “Colossus” by any chance?”
“Friday, open a new project folder on my private server. Title…Unchained Melody.”
“It’s not your shield without the paint, Cap,” he’d said, looking incredulous. “You have to know that. It’s a symbol of hope and freedom and other patriotic bullshit. People see that shield emerging out of the smoke, and it tells them they’re gonna be okay.”
“I, um.”
“Yes,” Strange says shortly. Steve looks incredibly unhappy, and Tony glances at him, head tilted to the side. “I’ve already looked Cap over, and he’s clear. It seems the curse is focussed entirely on you, so we can leave him here.”
“I dunno how many times I’ve gotta go over this with you Sleepy Jean, but not everybody’s got super-solider metabolism in this madhouse,” Tony says, pushing half of the fruit over onto Steve’s plate. He pops a slice into his mouth and crunches down on it to appease Steve’s frown. “What’s that mean, anyway, the opposite. I’m un-fired? Promoted? Hired? Hired for what?”
“What? We have no alternative facility, I told you-”
“It just hurts because I know he’s hurting, and I want to be with him,” Steve said, shaking his head. “It doesn’t mean anything, Thor. Don’t worry about it.”
“You wanna come?” Tony murmurs when they pull apart. He picks up the pace a little, twisting his hectocotylus brutally into Steve, pushing more of the tentacle inside of him. Steve looses a completely broken gasp, eyes flashing open wide. “You wanna come for me, baby?”
“How long?” Tony rasped, and the expression in his eyes hurt so much that Steve stumbled against the glass, bracing a hand against it to steady himself. “How long have you known?”
“Yup. Still me. I came to get you. We all came to get you. Are you good?” He rubs at the back of his neck, sheepish. “Maybe I should have kept Widow down here, she’s better at this bit than me. I do in a pinch, but I’m a shite commander.” Cap still looks lost, a little vacant and wary, and Tony reaches a hand out to touch his cheek. “We need you to be okay, Cap. Can you be Captain America for me right now? Up and at ‘em, Avenger.”
“Don’t be a smartass.”
“Have I overstepped?” Loki asks, and Tony is learning to read wariness as the fear of rejection now. He’s learning how to read Loki’s masks of protection for what they are.
Now, he took his time to explore Rogers’ mouth, the way his hand felt tangled in Tony’s curls, the other tight around Tony’s waist. His jaw was firm, strong under Tony’s questing hands, and Tony wrapped his other arm around Rogers’ broad shoulders and dragged his nails through the short hairs at the back of his neck. The sound that Rogers loosed at that was heady, a low rumbling purr, and Tony licked it from his mouth with an answering moan.
“Sir’s bloodwork is clear. He is in decontamination now.”
The little tin disc hits the basketball and crumples a bit on impact, and the ball rocks, rolling up onto the edge of the branch, before falling back into place.
“I don’t know that, actually.”
Tony stills. He does his best not to sigh. The old ache starts up in his chest again.
“How’s Riri?”
“I’ve got you,” he whispered, pressing soft kisses to Steve’s mouth, his jaw, his bondmark. “I’ve got you, baby, let go. Come on, I wanna see you.”
“Don’t you start with that,” Tony warns him, and Steve laughs. It’s low and throaty, and it makes his muscles clench in a way that makes Tony see stars. “
“Nope.” He sighs, glancing down the long driveway. “Kids, huh?”
Some warnings! All sex is very consensual, however, there is mild choking, BDSM elements, some somnophilia, etc. This gets pretty hardcore/explicit. Just a heads up.
Tony’s face wipes clean of all mirth, and Sue scoops her son up into her arms and scowls out across the whole room.
“It doesn’t,” Tony snaps, a little more shortly than he meant. “That’s…God, these are
“I will,” Steve says. “I promise.”
He almost doesn’t catch it. He’s about to do another circuit of the room, maybe do some shadow boxing or katas, but something about the cryochamber stops him.
“Alright,” Tony said, but neither of them moved for quite a long time.
Steve has always loved this. That first moment after a fight, where the adrenalin is still singing in the veins, and triumph sits on the tongue like hard candy. A tremulous smile takes over his face.
He thinks that it’s likely Peggy would have worn blockers all the time if she could have, too.
“No, negative, send-”
Steve lets out a broken sound, somewhere between a laugh and a sob. “Oh,” he says.
“Don’t do this,” she says, her eyes flashing, and Tony’s glad he’s wearing the suit. He doesn’t know what expression he’s making, but it would be too easy for her to read. He was always so easy for her to read. “Fight it.”
Despite Steve’s most selfish, fervent wishes, time insisted on its inexorable forward march.
.” He puts his hands on his hips, the spitting image of his mother. “I’m gonna be a
“Sir…” JARVIS begins, reticent, “I understand the phrase ‘opposites attract’ from a linguistic and metaphoric standpoint, but in practise I’m not sure you and the captain are compatible. You have several significant ideological differences. And Mr. Laufeyson is certainly not ‘boyfriend material’, so I think perhaps my opinions on this matter leave something to be desired.”
Tony’s looking up at him with a little glimmer in his eye, like he knows something Steve doesn’t. Steve can’t help but grin helplessly down at him.
“He never said what he wanted. I mean, he said he wanted to negotiate the terms of his surrender, but I was the one who suggested he wanted information exchange and his help in exchange for freedom. He never asked for anything, or said what he wanted, or why he wanted it.” Tony raises his eyebrows and closes his eyes, rubbing absently at his brow. “He swore he did not intend to cause harm, and wasn’t plotting our demise. It wasn’t much, but it was all I could drag out of him.”
The shirt has the shield on it. For a long time, Beth just stares at it, the fabric stretched between her clenched fists. Inevitably, Tony steps closer, close enough to see what’s stymied her. Then Tony takes a shuddering breath, and for the length of that breath, Steve feels as though he and Tony are one being. One body, experiencing one, terrible moment of horror. The silence in the bathroom is thick as molasses.
“I would hate to have chosen the wrong side.”
“Wooooow,” Tony says. He rubs a hand over his face. “This is it. This was Loki’s plot all along.”
“I thought I was created for plausible deniability,” JARVIS says. Tony starts, then laughs at himself.
There was very little sleep to be had for the rest of the night.
“Stark-”
He turns and looks around with newly informed eyes. There’s a hall visible to his left, lined with heavy steel doors, and he makes his way towards them. As he gets closer he can see various warnings on the signs, lights that go on when the rooms aren’t to be entered. No one’s here, and so Steve slips through one door. He can’t make heads or tails of most of what he’s looking at, but he makes sure to consign everything that looks vaguely important to relate to Tony and Reed and Franklin later to his memory.
“Ooh,
“Anything?” Peter asks eagerly.
“You think things were black and white during World War II?” the professor asks, amused now, and Steve frowns.
Sue, predictably, leaves without another word. The last thing Steve sees is Franklin waving at him over his shoulder. He waves back until the boy is out of sight.
The elevator opened to the penthouse, and Steve dragged him out with a hand in his belt.
“We had lion dances almost throughout the whole building,” Tony says stubbornly. “Which, hey, I don’t want bad spirits haunting my employees while they’re trying to work. I’m a big fan of multiculturalism. I live with an actual alien from another world.”
Steve looks up, his lips a flat line. Tony offers him a weak, tired kind of smile.
He carried the weight of the first suit, the metal fighting him every step of the way. He carried his aching, broken body through the searing desert with a battery strapped to his chest. He carried himself through the snow, limping and half-dead and dissociating, into Harley Keener’s garage. This was nothing.
“How many do you need?” Joyce asks.
“Go for it,” he says, waving a hand, and Minoru nods at him like he’s just given her a serious field order.
“Loving him doesn’t make you
“What?” Tony manages.
“Turn it off,” he mutters, walking into his closet. It’s been a long week, and he’s suddenly exhausted. “Thank fucking god it’s Friday.”
“Damn, you’re too good at that,” Tony said, and then he was pulling back, and that-
The girl turns to look at him, then tilts her head to the side. Her entire body is covered in a thin layer of brown fur. “Captain America, huh? He says he’s coming, give him a sec.”
It’s too easy to imagine the way the years might have played out differently if he’d just given in: no Sunset, or Tiberius, or Madame Mask for God’s sake. No War. But there are parts, too, that they would both have been sorry to miss. Rumiko. Sharon.
Steve sits down hard on the kitchen floor, because this is…this is maybe the worst thing that’s happened to him since he’s died. Worse than his funeral, worse than the pain of jumping out of Tony’s window and plummeting 90 stories to the pavement. He feels like he’s been hit in the chest by the Hulk.
He hadn’t realised his shoulders had stiffened, but he could feel them relax as soon as Tony’s hands slid over them, one slipping up over his jaw to tilt his head to the side. Before he could react, Tony’s mouth was there, hot behind the curve of his ear. His teeth scraped slow over the side of Steve’s neck, nowhere near his gland, but closer than anyone had ever gotten. It was a statement, both of intent and acceptance, and Steve melted back into him with a gasp, body going near-limp as he braced his hands against the counter.
“Come here,” Tony tells him, and Steve rises, moving closer. His skin nearly glows in the twilight. He’s so pale. A statue of an ancient hero, risen again.
Tony swallows, heat flushing up from his belly. His pulse thunders in his chest.
The sensation lessens, and Steve frowns. That’s never happened before.
“You, Pepper, and Rhodes used to be a Pack before he was deployed. That’s very common. Families, high school and college friend groups. Adults not having proper Packs and being socially maladjusted because of it is practically
Tony slaps his hand into Peter’s and lets himself be pulled up. “This is a dumb idea.”
Steve’s open hand flexes, once, before he pulls it back into his lap. “Yes,” he says.
Tony blinks. He turns to look at Cap, who’s staring at him with his brows furrowed. Blood is streaked messily over his chin, across his frowning mouth. Clint doesn’t waste time. He stumbles forward, his shaking hands beginning to run over Natasha’s body. She’s wearing the clothes she usually lounges at home in; black leggings, a soft cotton shirt. Still, he manages to pull two knives from her ribs, tucked in against her skin in a harness. She wasn’t using them, and that’s enough to make Tony pause, frowning.
“I am going to be finished before you fuck me if you don’t stick that thing inside me right the hell now,” Steve gasps. He slumps forward, still trembling in Tony’s arms. “I think I just came dry. My
"You accepted my invitation," Steve points out, grinning now.
“We need to talk about this if we want to fix it, Tony. I messed up, you lashed out, I should have known-”
“I have to stay here, because I smell like Tony,” Riri said, slow, as though Natasha was very stupid.
, we’ve talked about this.”
“Don’t be sad,” he tells Steve. “Daddy will help you.”
As always, feel free to disagree vociferously in the comments. I love talking about this stuff, or I wouldn’t write about it.
They lay there spent for a few minutes, Steve weakly combing his fingers through Tony’s hair. He was absolutely high as a kite on endorphins, and when Tony’s knot finally released and began to go down, the loss made him shiver with want.
“I know,” Bruce says, but Tony doesn’t know if he really hears him. Eventually, he heads for the elevator and back up to the penthouse.
“Hi,” Steve says. And then he leans in and kisses Tony on the mouth.
. Tony should have prepared himself better for this. “I’m not sorry you did this time. I’m
“Tony,” Steve says, and he sounds sad. “What happened?”
“I am touching you,” Tony says, and Steve lets out a frustrated growl. The chains clink for a moment before he remembers himself, subsiding and lying back against the sheets.
If asked later, Steve wouldn’t be able to say exactly when he knew he was in love. It was more of a slow creep than a revelation; a dazzling smile, a kind word, a casual brush against Steve’s shoulder on a bad day. Slowly, Tony wove himself into Steve’s space, a kudzu vine edging into every inch of Steve’s routine until he couldn’t even think of being without him.
“Shh,” Tony tells him. He grips him tight, tentacles winding around Steve’s legs as he hugs him around the waist. “I’m okay.”
He was so dizzy with anticipation that it was hard to see straight. Instead, he focussed on putting one foot in front of the other on the plush carpet, until he managed to reach the sunken dais in the centre of the room. It was less of a bed than a pillow nest, an enormous circle set into the floor and filled with the finest washable fabrics money could buy, and a base mattress with just enough bounce to make certain activities a little easier. The little kid in Steve had wanted nothing more than to use it as a trampoline when he first saw it, but there was nothing of that impulse now as he stepped down into it, adjusting the pillows and blankets a bit before kneeling in the centre of the whole thing.
Steve knows what is going to happen. He knows. He wasn’t even nearby when the building fell; the images that are being shown are from his memory of the footage he saw afterwards. But still, when he sees the building, his heart jumps into his throat. He cannot stop himself from running towards it. He cannot stop it from collapsing.
“So instead-”
Even the histories only mention Sarah Rogers; how she worked so hard for her son, how she died so tragically young. Steve never once mentioned his father to interviewers, and never said anything about him to his colleagues or the Commandos for it to be repeated. Tony hadn’t even been sure Steve had known his father, from how big of an absence there was.
He wants so badly to say it and have Tony hear him.
“Here,” Tony says, gesturing with the glass cutter he’s holding before realising that’s probably a bad idea. “Why did I decide to make the Empire State Building a to-scale model?”
Don't forget to check the work's endnotes for the spoilery warnings! Please me know if there’s anything you think I should have warned for that I missed. I know this story deals with a lot of shit, and I hope that y’all can find it healing and/or fun instead of hurtful. If at any point you feel I’ve missed the mark, please, please let me know.
, please.
“Probably, yes.”
Tony looses an ambivalent noise, then takes another sip sip of hot chocolate. “I wanted you to know what’s going on because you’re the most likely to do it if I need to be taken out, or know when to knock me around the head if Loki tries something. I know he’s watching me, and right now we don’t have any way to counteract that. He could be listening in right now.” He grimaces. “I underestimated the strength of my relationships. In my defence, I’m not used to being a real boy with real friends. My bad, I know.”
Steve laughs, low and overwhelmed. He rubs a hand over his eyes. "There's not much to tell," he admits. "Died when I was real young. Drank too much. He had PTSD from the first World War, although we didn't have the words for that then. All I knew was that he was a mean drunk. But my ma cried when he died, even if I didn't. She knew a version of him I never got to see, I'd guess."
Steve nods, then sits, resting the bouquet on the edge of Pepper’s impeccably clean desk. “Tony and I had a talk, worked some things out. So I thought I should come by, and settle things between us, if I could.”
“Of course,” Tony sighed, sounding defeated now.
,” he cried, and oh, that was embarrassing. His voice broke horrifically over the words, thickness building in his throat. “I was willing to wait, but I would have been fine if you’d never told me. It was your choice. I was forced into playing alpha, but you-”
“Can I say something you might not like and not have you kick the shit out of me?” Tony asks. “Only, it seems like your brother’s busy, and no one’s here to jump on you and give me a chance to get suited up.”
Before, he would have been delighted to know that his soulmate was a mad inventor. He’s always loved science-fiction and fantasy. Now, it’s just one more way that he’s not good enough.
” Tony trilled to himself, “
Strange smiles thinly at him. “And will that assuage your guilt for your part in their War?” he asks.
He presses a kiss to Tony’s temple. He lets him go.
Tony sighed, wiping his hands in the dishrag and coming to stand by the side of Rogers’ bed.
Which isn’t to say that Tony stops working. More that he begins to work on everything that he’d left by the wayside. More suits, clean energy, foldable all-screen laptop tablet things. He keeps circling back to Steve’s blood, trying to figure out the trick of why Steve hadn’t healed, but he doesn’t get anywhere. Tony’s amazing at many things, but biology has never been his primary area of expertise. And the experts have their own things to deal with. Crises arise. Villains attack. Other people come back from the dead. The world spins madly on.
Steve shakes his head, grinning. “Tell me about your neuroscientist friend. Did you work in the octopus lab? Did they have names?”
Bucky huffs a laugh. There’s a faint clink of metal on glass or ceramic. A drawer opens and shuts. “I’ll see you in Florida, Tony.”
as though the very idea was ridiculous,
“Sir,” JARVIS says, and Tony raises an eyebrow.
There was a pause, just long enough for Steve to notice, before JARVIS spoke again. “Should I presume that you are asking for the ring size for the third finger of Sir’s left hand?” The AI’s voice possessed a warmth that made Steve smile, a bit of pressure burgeoning in his chest because,
“No, you’re the other brain on the team and Loki’s right; I’ve got some tech wrangling to do before we ship out, even if it’s only to amp up one of the secondary suits a bit.”
"I do like it, especially how it looks on me, but I'm a little weary on the price." Her voice trailed off as her hands slowly followed the dress downward, a slight longing in her eyes. Kitana frowned slightly before sighing about to say something, had Pepper not piped up them.
Deciding then to take the lead, he stepped forward so he was level with Steve and agreed with everything Steve had said, without adding a sexual pun in there. He had his moment, he knew now wasn't one of those sexual reference time but a serious time.
"So, we have 40 minutes to get ready before Tony wants to meet you and Steve, what would you like to do first? I'd suggest makeup so if it goes wrong we don't spill it down our outfits." Natasha's voice sounded as though she'd already made up her mind and Kitana knew it, so she just smiled and nodded along agreeing with that. Magically putting her make up pack in her bag she pulled it out and set it onto the bed. Seeing this, Natasha ushered her over to the vanity table there is and made her sit down. Critically looking her over left from right and letting a small nod go, she decided that she'd be able to do what she wanted with Kitana's hair and Makeup and she knew it was gonna knock both Steve's and Tony's socks off when they saw her.
"Are you talking about Tony Stark? He's your boss?" she didn't mean for it to come out as surprised as it did and she inwardly cringed at it but obviously couldn't do anything about it now it had been said.
"Yes, it was fine. I've just got a mini tour off of Tony here and gave me an information overload. You should have heard him, his mouth was going a mile a minute!" she laughed teasingly back, winking over at Tony to show she was teasing and all three of them burst into laughter once more.
"Well Tony, we met in kind of the same way as you and me did. Only Steve didn't cover my mouth and drag me off into an alleyway just so you could use me to hide from your fans." letting a smirk cover her face she insinuated to what actually happened. Laughing at his sheepish look she saw Steve's confused face.
The first red head, who wore a professional dress and heels and longer red hair, spoke up first. "Yes, you might be able to help us. We've never seen this shop before and due to the fact my boss is hosting a party tomorrow night, we need outfits and we thought we'd see what you have to offer." The way she spoke was very professional and slightly stiff and Kitana took an immediate dislike to her, reminding her too much of Hermione but in Ginny's body. Still smiling, she nodded.
"As you wish, sir." JARVIS replied as the sound of a phone dialling came through the room.
"You got everything you need? I'll show you up to where the communal area for Stark Tower is and then show you to where you can get changes. Natasha will definitely be joining you, but Miss Potts may already be ready by the time we get there." She noticed how he used 'Miss Potts' Instead of 'Pepper' but didn't say anything about it, because it was not of her business.
Setting up her bank account was the easiest out of her accomplishments during that month, as she had money to go into it but it was slightly annoying when she had to confound the woman behind the desk because other than her I.D. she had no other way of saying who she was and where she came from. This also made her realise she needed documentation and so she forged everything the best she could, creating a background story that would hopefully stand up unless someone looked to closely. Kitana got herself a mobile phone and after some debate with herself, she reluctantly added Tony's Number to it. Health wise, she set up a food schedule and exercise regime so that she can stay on top form. You see, she wanted to keep fit. She may only look 25 but she was 35 and while she knew she wasn't going to be aging, she wanted to look and feel her best. On top of that, she'd made a new friend. Only, she didn't really try to be his friend, it just sorts of happened.
A poor choice of words if I do say. You looked about ready to clock me one on the face." Steve didn't know what to say to that, so he only looked towards Kitana.
"Tony? Hey, what do you need?" Steve questioned over the phone a slightly puzzles look over his face.
About to speak, she was stopped by a large hand covering her mouth and a male voice whispering in her ear frantically. "I'll give you anything if you don't scream my name right now, I'm trying to hide from some fans and they're going to be coming around that corner any seconds now, I need to hide from them and after their gone we can talk about what to do to keep you quiet, okay? Good, you're coming with me!" With that, he let go of her mouth and grabbed her hands, pulled her up and dragged her back to the alley way she appeared from. Pushing her into the corner hiding both his and her body from view as well as both their faces and shocked her by kissing her full on the lips. Kitana stiffened in shock, eyes going wide and letting out a squeak. Just as this happened a hoard of people ran past, screaming a name she couldn't quite make out at that moment. She started to feel slightly light headed when he finally pulled back. She breathed in the much needed air and her mind cleared. Her eyes narrowed and she looked to the man in front of her, who was looking away from her checking for any fans nervously. Finding none, he let out a breath and turned to her, a shit eating grin on his face. It slipped off when he saw the angry look on hers.
His grin became even larger if possible. "Kitana, a beautiful name for a beautiful face." He grabbed her hand and extravagantly kissed the back of it. Unbidden, a blush made its way to her face.
In Stark Tower, Tony was having a very unpleasant conversation.
Tony's voice went from very happy to slightly wary and sad. Looking slightly concerned, Steve nodded before realizing Tony couldn't see him and saying 'yes' into the phone.
"Alright, say you actually don't want anything from me now, I don't like the thought of you being able to call in a favour at any time at all. So how about, I give you my personal number and that way if you think of anything you need, you can call me and then we won't need to speak to each other again, alright? Although, you do seem like the kind of girl I would like to get to know, so... You never know." his trademark grin was on his face again and didn't let up this time until she nodded, but only after looking him over to see whether he was lying or trying to trick her into something.
"Alright, since your girl might top what I got you, let's go down to party and not only show off the birthday boy but this beautiful angel here." Tony's as smooth as ever when it comes to words and they both smile bright megawatt smiles back at him and they head towards the elevator and towards the party, hoping everything goes alright and to plan.
"Fine, I'll take that as your resignation. By end of play Monday, i want your desk and rooms all cleared up.  Since i know you have an apartment not too far from here, i'm giving you till monday to make arrangmenet to move out of here and back into there. I'm going to need your pass codes and pass keys Monday evening, and you will be put onto restricted access until that point. You'll get this month's pay and you can still attend the party. Come monday, the notice will be going round that i'm officially looking for a new secretary and that you no longer work for Stark Industries. Is that clear? Good. Now, on to other things, I don't need you and I don't want you, not like that. I liked you at the start, Miss Potts, you were nice, kind and good at what you did, but lately you've turned into a nasty evil cow. You sneer down your nose at everyone, including me and my friends, thinking yourself better than us. Well you're not, you have no right to do so, especially when you know us and yes, were all annoying in one way or another and yes, I am childish most times and don't want to do the work I'm meant to be doing but that's because I'd rather be in my work room, inventing something new, rather than being weighed down with paperwork. That's why I hired you, so don't you dare start complaining about that, I made it very clear to you what you'd be doing when you started. As for getting a lower pay, don't make me laugh. I pay you way more than I strictly should, I pay for things such as clothes or shoes for any parties I host. Just because you have got used to living lavishly and pay for things when you get the money and then pay the rent on your penthouse that you are barely in, leaves you with hardly any money at the end, isn't my fault now is it!"
"Alright, so let me get this straight. You've met before and he took your first kiss by dragging you to an alley way so he could hide from fans? And you didn't hit him one for it? You've got some staying power, had than have been me in your position, I'd have hit him as soon as his lips touched me." All three laughed at his words, even though they weren't that funny, it was just the image of Tony trying to drag Steve into an alley way and kiss him. It just wasn't possible. Especially since Steve could just plant his feet and nothing would be able to move him. No one really noticed due to their laughter but Steve had a slight blush on his face and curiously enough, so did Tony.
"Yes, I did want to sleep with her, but she said no and I don't sleep with anybody unwilling. I'm not that kind of guy." Pepper
"She's not lying. I did give her a lift home, after bumping into her pretty hard on the street and I didn't want her to walk home like that on her own. I did want to spend the night with her, but she said no and so I just gave her a lift home. And gave her my number too." he shook his head at the phone, rolling his chair back to his computer and typing a few things into it.
"Yes Tony, I've told her. Before you rang up, Kitana was deciding on what she was going to wear and I asked her if she wanted to walk in with me. At least that way, I know she got there safe and wasn't alone." Steve explained to Tony, blushing at his admittance on the second part, trying to defend himself in the end. The grin on Tony's face told him he failed but he also noticed a gleam in his friend's eye's that he couldn't recognise and didn't get the chance to try and decipher as Kitana spoke up.
Tony's voice sounded down the phone and due to Kitana's enhanced hearing, she could hear loud and clear what he was saying. She hid a grin as she realized Tony didn't know who she was. That grin soon turned down as she realized, somehow Tony was looking over at them. Pulling out her own phone, she used it as a reflection to see where he was. Noticing he was at the end of the street, where she'd seen Pepper and Natasha last she put her phone away. Listening into the conversation, she let a smile spread across her face.
The buzzing of his phone didn't disturb Tony in the slightest. It wasn't until JARVIS announced he had a message from an unknocwn number he identified as a Kitana Potter that he paid any attention. Telling JARVIS to read it aloud, he kept fiddling with the wiring of the gauntlet in his hands as he listened.
"That will be $1,063.99 please." she saw Natasha's eye's winded slightly at the price but before she could say anything, Pepper had already handed her a card and she swiped it through, the name 'Stark' showing up on the screen before accepting it. Nodding at them, a bright smile still on her face, she handed the card back.
Shaking herself out of it, Kitana stepped out of the alley way and looked around her. She had not travelled very much in the years after the war but she'd recognize New York anywhere. But it looked different, more... Modernized. Especially the big building with 'Stark' written on the side. That building looked so much different to the buildings she was used to, that alone was her proof she'd travelled somewhere different, whether it was into the future... Or a different dimension all together.
"It's your birthday tomorrow? Why didn't you tell me! I need to go and find you something to give you as your present! And a card!" Her shocked voice came out louder than she expected it to and a red blush came on her face as she ducked her head from the stares she received.
"Kitana! You made it! I take it the walk here wasn't as hard as you'd though It'd be?" It was Steve and he was his usual kind and charming self, teasing her with the last part, pulling her in for a hug just as long as the one she and Tony shared downstairs, if not longer.
While she was changing again, Natasha walked out of the dressing room in her dress as well as her shoes too. She's chosen the open toed ones as well as the plain black clutch with the diamante opening. The dress had two straps but they rested more on the edges of her shoulder rather than the centre of them, giving the illusion of being held up wherein realistic they were non-functional. It had a semi low cut neckline, low enough that it shows off some cleavage but not enough that it's indecent. At her left hip, there was a cluster of fake gems that pulled the dress together slightly. It was on the same side as the slit up the leg and it accented the dress nicely. It hugged her figure in all the right places and made Kitana quite jealous as she didn't have, and probably would never have, the curves that Natasha has nor the height, as she finished growing some time ago.
The first time Tony Stark met Kitana was by accident. Well, more like it was he was trying to hide from his fans and she was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
"Hello Kitana, how nice it is to see you again. I take it Capsicle has invited you to my little shindig tomorrow. Were also celebrating Caps birthday too." His voice bounced back too normal, as did his face as he looked the green eyed girl over at the table. Today she was wearing black peep toe heels, with 4 black straps going up the foot to the ankle that had gold bits attached, see through black tights and a black and white Skirt that came to mid-thigh. For her top, she was wearing a white vest with a black lace off both of the shoulders top on over the top. The pattern in the lace were roses and it went perfectly with the skirt and accented her body well.
"Pepper, how goes the dress hunting? Find anything that I'd want on my bedroom floor? And what about the lovely Natasha? Has she found anything the is more than likely going to be off her body before the end of the night?" He's only joking with her; he doesn't like Pepper that way. Natasha on the other hand, that red head he wouldn't mind trying to get with but he likes his balls exactly where they are, thank you very much.
Her hand was in the corner of his elbow, almost like couples would walk in the 1920's and 1930's.
Kitana had just travelled through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries, carrying everything she owns including all her money from Gringotts, in a never-ending bag. It was 19 years after the war had ended and she wanted to get away. She was still in the body of a 25-year-old girl, never looking any different and never changing. The first few years she didn't notice but around the age of 34/35 she finally agreed with what she'd known for a while. She wasn't aging and it seems everyone else was finally noticing too. After the war, she'd fallen out with Ron and Hermione and the rest of the Weasley's too, except the Twins and Bill and Charlie. But they were gone now too. All of them were gone now. And it was all her fault.
“You have no idea.” He is, maybe, feeling a little too emotional to hide the truth of himself from this preternaturally intelligent, extraordinarily powerful boy.
“Yeah,” Steve agreed, smiling against Tony’s skin. “I’m yours.”
“Man’s gotta defend his ride,” Steve agrees, laughing. He stands, gathering up his jacket. “Thanks, Professor.”
“He had my weapon,” Loki says primly. “I used magic and did not reveal myself, but I am unsure of what he suspects. If he knows, he knows what I can do to him, and so he has said nothing. I had thought he died when the building collapsed, so I was surprised to find he’d survived. He must have fled the battle like a coward.”
Tony rolls out of bed sometime around noon, and spends a good twenty minutes in the shower. Steve sits on the floor outside of the bathroom, waiting, and tries to puzzle out what the hell the trick is to interacting with the world around him. He doesn’t fall through the floors, but he can go through windows. Sometimes, he can lean against tables or counters. Sometimes, his hands go right through.
“I gave my word I did not intend you harm,” Loki says, some of the desperation leaving him for wariness, and Tony turns his head to suck Loki’s thumb into his mouth. He’s rewarded with those sharp eyes lowering to half mast, and he licks at the pad of Loki’s thumb and drags his teeth against it. Loki surges up to kiss him again, brutal this time, and Tony bites at his lower lip in retaliation. He freezes when Loki lets out a low moan, then does it again.
Tony glances up, his breath stuttering in his throat to see Steve walking across the penthouse floor, expression soft and determined. His stride is resolute, and when he opens his arms, Tony offers him a small nod. Steve pulls Tony into his chest without a word, and Tony rests his forehead against Steve’s collarbone. He smells like wind and leather and good, clean sweat. Immediately, Tony wants to take that nap he’d promised himself.
"Yeah?"
“We can try to find some time,” Tony says. “After all this is over, maybe.”
“I’m sorry,” he tries, mostly because he’s a coward, and better now than later. “I’m trying.”
“So. You drove four hours to my house on a Friday night to escape a scrap with your new best friend?” Sam looks at him. “What’s really going on?”
“No,” Steve says, blinking the moisture out of his eyes, and now Tony just feels like an asshole, He grabs hold of Tony’s biceps with fingers that are a little too firm for comfort, desperate and pleading. “Stay. Please, stay. I can’t- I need-…”
“I’ve read those,” Steve protests, sounding a little offended. “They came out in the 1800’s. I’m not that old.”
“Yeah,” Steve murmurs, moving closer. Water laps softly against the side of the tub. “That exact expression.” And then he leans in and kisses Tony, hard, with unmistakable intent.
Steve leans in again, knocking their foreheads together gently. His eyes flutter shut. “I miss you,” he murmurs, and Tony swallows.
Steve lets out an inhuman sound and leans down, swiping his tongue over Tony’s throat where the last bit of his release had landed. He can’t taste anything, but the sound Tony makes is gorgeous, wrung-out and wrecked. It makes Steve set his teeth to the tendon there, his whole body shaking. He tucks a hand under Tony’s lower back, puts the tips of his fingers to the dimples there. He pulls him up into his body, makes himself at home in the cradle of Tony’s hips, and surges up to kiss him on the mouth.
“Stark’s got deep pockets,” Logan says, and Steve tilts his head a bit in confusion. Logan’s never cared much for the high life. “I bet his bar is top-notch.”
“Tony,” Steve said helplessly, and he could feel Tony’s smug, rumbling laugh against him. A warm kiss was pressed to the back of his neck, and then Tony pulled back, slow enough to give Steve a few moments to collect himself.
Steve takes a breath. He shrugs. Reaches out, as casual as he can, and takes a long draught from his coffee cup.
“Tony?” Stephen says, not looking away from the book he’s sliding onto the shelf.
Steve pauses, halfway through spooning some duck stuff over white rice. “I’m not fragile.” It comes out differently than he wanted it to; angrier, maybe, or more vulnerable. JARVIS, to his credit, says nothing immediate. “Sorry, that was. Uh. You’re probably right.”
“None taken,” Collins says, amused. “And the U.N. is meeting this week to discuss just that. But you’re operating on U.S. soil, Stark. You are American citizens, and you must answer to the American government for your infractions. Unless you’d like to answer to Ukraine’s legal system?”
“Where were you?” Clint asked. “Tony saved you half a chicken broccoli.”
Steve needs a fuckin’ hug, y’all.
“I know that Loki’s sort of less-evil right now,” Tony says, “but I seriously don’t trust him to undo a mind-control spell on me.”
“Yeah,” Steve admitted, “but also because I want to.”
“Look, Pep, what do you want me to say? We’ve had this fight a hundred times, and the end result is always the same. I go, and you’re mad at me, and I come home, and you forgive me because I’m a mess. It’ll be just peachy.”
Tony smiles, all teeth. "Well, you could kill me pretty easy without my armour."
“Who’s Evan?”
It was legal, now, and it wasn’t even that controversial. Steve didn’t know what he was waiting for. It wasn’t like Tony would have stopped him, if he wanted to come out. He was sure Tony would love a chance to brag about him, in fact. He did it to Clint all the damn time, mostly to irritate him. Clint pretended to think they were gross, and Tony pretended to be offended. It was a weird bonding thing. Steve didn’t get it, but he did think it was kinda cute.
“I love you,” Steve confesses, mouth pressed to the space over Tony’s heart. Perhaps he is a coward after all. He knows Tony cannot hear him, but it feels so good to say it out loud. It feels like letting go of a weight he has been carrying all his life.
, Steve thinks, standing outside of Tony’s bedroom in the penthouse. He isn’t here, Steve knows. He’s being a coward again. He sighs, drags a hand over his face.
Steve pressed his fingers inside himself, curling them and growling in frustration when he couldn’t quite reach what he wanted. He pulled out and used the slick to jerk himself roughly, Tony’s praise washing over him in a wavering tide, and then he was coming. It took him with such force that he lost a minute, pleasure whiting out his brain, desperate sounds caught in his throat as Tony’s hands gripped in his hair. He could feel Tony coming again, liquid trickling down his throat, and the feel of it made him shiver as he swallowed reflexively, again and again and again.
“Wait, Cap, stop,” Tony says, reaching out and taking a hold of Steve’s wrist with his free hand. Steve’s expression is determined, furious, and he turns to Tony with wild eyes. “Listen! You’re forgetting that we have a brainwashed super-spy assassin double agent living in the tower with us. Again.”
probably has it.
Rogers folded the covers back, raising his eyebrows knowingly. “Come to bed, Tony.”
“It is the truth.”
“You were created to be the first and best of your kind,” Tony tells him, shutting off the water. “You’re the best thing I’ve made in my life.”
“Good crying?” Steve asked, but he was grinning, fierce and full of as much love as he could muster.
She turns and studies the armour for a moment. She tilts her head to the side. Then a small, wicked smile overtakes her face.
Steve rocked his hips back, panting. He wanted. He wanted so badly, so much he could feel it in the marrow of him. He wanted Tony’s hands on him, his mouth, his fingers, his cock. He wanted him. He wanted to be claimed.
“Your mission was to get Tony Stark to back The Avengers Initiative. Now I’m your patsy and your sugar daddy and your R&D and your landlord,” Tony finishes, and Natasha inclines her head. “Is this the part where you tell me our friendship wasn’t a lie?”
“Thank you,” Steve whispers, “for believing him.”
Tony cuts off the comms again. “There, done. Go to bed. Nat and Clint can get a flight out from Seoul when he’s patched up. Some breathing room will be good for everyone before shit hits the fan.”
The most fucked up thought floats across Tony’s brain, then:
“No. I’d tell you to forget about the press, go home, and take a nap,” Steve tells him crossly. “And then we’d argue about it, because you are terrible at taking care of yourself when you think there’s something that needs doing. But there’s always something that needs doing, and so you never take care of yourself.”
Steve wants to be sick all over again.
“There’s an unusual amount of variation on that data, for you.”
The smile that Thor offers him is broad and knowing, uncanny in its softness. Then he laughs, a low, rumbling noise that Tony still manages to feel in his bones. Even when subdued, Thor’s laughter could never be called quiet.
“You bet I am,” Tony says. He worms one tentacle up and flicks at one of Steve’s abused nipples with it. They’re puffy, pink and used. Tony wants to put his mouth on them. “Look at you.”
The woman looks discomfited, waffling between furious and hesitant. “You are allied with Loki?” she asks. “And yet I can sense remnants of mjölnir’s magic all along your parapet.”
“Then I can’t help you, Captain. I’m sure you know your way out.”
“We change the world, sir.”
Tony melts under Steve’s hands. He always does, for him. He trembles, his arms coming up to grip the corded muscle of Steve’s forearms, sliding up and over his shoulders, then down, firm, all the way to his ass. Steve makes a luscious sound into his mouth, tips his head and kisses him deeper, like he’s trying to crawl into Tony’s skin. It flushes him up to the tips of his ears, makes him ache with longing. He can feel Steve with every tentacle—wrapped around one ankle, and over the back of one knee, and the soft, lightly-furred place between his thighs-
Natasha shakes her head. “It’s not just the conditioning. Between that, and the magic…”
They found Thor, predictably, by the refreshments table. Waiters moved through the room with platters, but here there were all sorts of plates full of things that Steve couldn’t identify. He went for what was clearly fish and cheese on a cracker, popping the whole thing in his mouth and watching Thor charm a whole group of SI employees with effortless charm.
“No,” Peter says, frowning up at Tony. “We all saw it. You would have let him kill you. I know you don’t remember, but I do. I was there, on both sides. You made some terrible choices, I’m not disputing that. You did some really truly reprehensible things. But Tony… You thought that maybe he could end it, because you knew you couldn’t. You wanted to compromise, and he hit you with the EMP. You asked him to kill you, so you’d stop fighting. You
On day five, Steve begins to take Tony’s absence personally.
“Don’t pull a Houdini on me,” Tony bids quietly. “I know you want to, this is embarrassing, you want to be alone with your- uh, whatever that was, but turnabout is fair play, right? My turn to make you breathe slow and hug you until you feel like your skin is on right again. So come on.” He takes one of Loki’s hands, braces it over his heart. “That’s it.”
“Excuse me,” Steve stammers, and speed walks out of the kitchen. Tony blinks after him, too shocked to be properly offended.
Tony laughs, turning back around and picking up his coffee again. He rubs a tired hand over his eyes. “Sure, Peter. Ask away.”
“Nope.” Tony nodded towards Bruce, whose eyebrows were raised. Apparently he hadn’t known that, either. “I learned my lesson last time, so I figured someone on the team should know, in case things went south while we were in the field. Pepper’s clearance doesn’t always allow her to keep up with what we’re doing. Bruce’s got the medical degree, and at the time we were closest. Logical choice.”
“Sir’s sexual history is many things, but private is not a term I would ever use to describe it.”
Steve’s chair scrapes against the tile, and Tony glances across the table to see that he’s stood up. His blue eyes are wide. He’s looking at Tony like he’s never seen him before.
“Only ‘til tomorrow morning,” Tony admits. “I just…You got killed because of me.
Tony winces.
“Found Rogers,” Tony grunted. The snow had begun to melt into his clothes after a few minutes of warmth, cold water slithering down his spine and tensing his muscles. “Injured on the pass road. He wasn’t even shivering. Didn’t have a damn coat.”
He collapses back into Steve’s arms with a gasping breath, his lungs filling with blessed oxygen as he tries to get his bearings. “Fuck,” he gasps, and Steve lets out a low purr of agreement behind him, his arm slipping around Tony’s waist to pull him back until they’re slotted together from head to toe. Steve’s still half-hard inside of him, but Tony doesn’t mind that one bit.
whatever they want.
Widow tilts her head to the side, and then her brow furrows. Natasha slips out from behind the mask, bemused. She stops moving, her fists flexing open, then closed again.
A scruffy blond teen huffs from where he’s apparently decided to watch Minoru’s back. On a better day, Tony would remember his name. Right now every single thought he could possibly have about the boy is uncharitable, so he lets it slide.
“I didn’t forget anything, did I?”
“Steve does a lot of things that no one does anymore,” Bruce reminds him.
“You don’t seem overly worried for your captain,” Loki says, and Tony stills, tension sinking into his shoulders like sand. “And you have been circling each other like feral animals. Yet I have seen your interactions, before, and there was affection and tenderness where now there is avoidance and tension.”
“I haven’t done enough to earn my rest yet,” Steve says. It wasn’t what he meant to say, but there it is. Guilt curdles into the pit of his stomach, and Bucky laughs. It’s a mean, nasty thing, and it makes Steve’s throat tighten. Bucky’s tags clink softly against each other as he straightens up, the cot creaking beneath him.
“You planned that pretty well, then,” Tony laughed, and his eyes were shining, bright bottle-glass in the spotlights. A few people whooped their agreement. “I don’t think anyone in their right mind is gonna fight Captain America for me.”
“We’re Pack Bonded, Tony.”
“I’m going,” he said, shortly, and then he was moving, back up towards the surface. “How are we doing this?”
“It was I who felled your would-be killer,” Thor says, matter-of-factly. He does not bother to hide his sorrow when Loki pulls out of his grip.
“And I loved every minute of it,” Steve said, letting his eyes drop to trace over Tony’s body, lingering on his cock until it twitched under his gaze. He licked his lips, and Tony laughed outright.
“That makes me sound like a supervillain,” Tony crows, laughing, but he does as he’s told. After all, Thor can be wise, too, sometimes.
But mostly, Steve thinks, it’s because even without knowing what Tony felt like under his hands, his mouth, he already loves Tony. He loves him so much it hurts. And it’s dangerous, that feeling. Loving Tony feels dangerous, like a cliff’s edge he cannot come back from. It’s always been just as alluring to his adrenaline-loving heart. He and Tony are wildly combustible, and loving him in that way had always felt like a step too far. To love Tony in that way means that he would own every inch of Steve, more than he already does. Even before his death, it still felt like Tony was a magnet. Steve has always been pulled firmly to Tony’s North Pole, always intensely aware of everything he is. Everywhere he is. Tony has been his home, and his first anchor to this life, and the abstract representation of his desperate wish for a utopian future that they both know doesn’t really exist. But sometimes, on good days, Tony can make him believe in it. Some days, Tony can make him believe in anything.
“Oh,” Pepper says, one fine-boned hand coming up to cover her mouth. “Tony.”
“I’ve seen worse.”
“Steve,” Tony says, reaching out a hand. Steve lets him brush his knuckles over one high, sharp cheekbone. He’s got stubble, something Tony’s almost never seen on his clean-cut Americana face. He can count the times he’s caught Steve with facial hair on his fingers, and Tony swallows at the thought of that stubble brushing against other places. The inside of his thighs, chiefly.
“Sir, yessir,” Tony drawls. Steve sighs, steps out. The door slips closed. “JARVIS, you’ll tell us when he’s gone, yeah?”
Steve was more than happy to comply, crawling over the sheets just to hear Tony snarl at the sight of him. He dropped his head to his forearms and spread his thighs, and was rewarded immediately with a “Fuck, Steve,” and then-
He glances back at Loki, leaning against the bathroom doorway. His arms are crossed across his chest, brow furrowed, and Tony wonders if human body language can really be applied to Loki, if he’s projecting an image for manipulation or his defensiveness is real. Cursing himself, Tony moves back towards him, slipping into his space and leaning in to meet his eyes.
"Miss Potts, you look ravishing, if I do say so myself."
DUM-E whirred gently at him, and Steve smiled and patted the bot’s strut again. Then he made his way towards the elevator, and pressed the button for the Tank.
“Tell me, Stark, if you love a woman as much as you claim to love Pepper Potts, why would you leave her pale mortal form so woefully unprotected?”
“That’s the whole thing,” Tony says, trying not to laugh. “They’re called oysters, basically a stomach and not much else. It’s an Earth delicacy.”
“I know that. Relationships are about hard work.” Steve smiles, bittersweet and true. “We’ve had a lot of hard, recently. But it’s worth it, I think. He’s worth it.”
“Tony,” Steve tries.
“I don’t think I can do this again,” Tony whispers, and Steve’s heart crumples in his chest. He reaches out to touch the skin at the back of Tony’s neck. It’s soft, he knows, from hugging Tony, because it’s the one spot he can touch Tony when he’s in the armour. It’s a place his hand is familiar with. He gets the barest impression of warmth against his fingertips, but he can’t touch Tony. His hand passes right through.
your mouth.”
Tony goes into the bathroom to perform his nightly ablutions, and Steve crawls into bed, smiling a little at how decadent the sheets are. He’s never slept here before, and this wasn’t exactly the scenario he’d imagined when he thought about being here for the first time.
“I didn’t know,” Tony says, shaking his head. He’s staring down at his hands, gripping the glass so tightly Steve wonders if it will break between his fingers. He feels like he’s watching the scene through a film of plastic. “I didn’t…you. You said it was hard to love me, but you have no idea, you have
“For you, maybe,” Tony says. Then he pauses, letting a slow, filthy grin sweep over his face. The change in Steve’s expression is instantaneous. He looks poleaxed, and he freezes in the bathroom doorway, one hand braced against the frame as if to steady himself. “Morning, Captain. Feel free to take a long, long shower. I’ll just be here. In bed.” He spreads his legs, arching his back in a decadent stretch. He lets himself moan a little at the feel of it, then extends all the way down to his curling toes, his grasping fingertips stretching up to grasp at the headboard. When he opens half-lidded eyes, Steve’s mouth has fallen open, shallow breaths barely moving the defined planes of his shoulders, his chest. “Take all the time you need, because I’ll certainly make use of it.”
Eventually, his eyes drift shut. The tension goes out of him. He’s exhausted.
Steve straightened, his heart leaping into his throat. “Oh.” He stood, polishing off the rest of his water and putting it in the sink. Then he turned around, then went back and picked up the sponge. He should wash it. “How long?”
I think this is me working up to an elegy. I’ve been a Cap/Iron-Man shipper for a long time. It’s an old ship, sturdy and still going strong, but lately I've been wondering if it’s time for me to step off of it. I’ve always had some serious issues with Cap, which let me tell you, has always required a lot of doublethink. I always wanted to shake Tony and tell him that he was worthy, and Cap could be a real asshole too, and his golden hero was far from perfect. In the comics, I was actually more on Cap's side from a moral standpoint, even if I thought Tony had a lot of good points considering House of M/the political climate. Having watched Captain America: Civil War however, I came out with nothing but incandescent hatred for Movie!Cap. With the changes made for the film, I found his position surprisingly un-American, rather  imperialistic, and ultimately indefensible without extreme and dangerous arrogance. He seemed so OOC to me. Tony makes his mistakes, but he always owns up to them. His unhealthy self-deprecation ensures that. Steve’s moral superiority won’t let him acknowledge any fault at all.
“You’ve dated more folks than I can count,” Steve says, and Tony raises his eyebrows.
job."
Tony waves him on. “Lead the way! I want to blow something up. Can you make that happen?”
“He- he was
And it doesn’t matter, that Tony had once again proved himself to be un-killable, unbeatable. It doesn’t matter that Tony has always saved himself, always wrenched himself, bleeding and desperate, out of the hands of death. Steve remembers reading Sherman Alexie’s “Survivorman” and immediately thinking of Tony crossing twenty five miles of desert and carrying a newly born superhero inside of him, the chest plate simultaneously weighing and buoying his heart. Every time, the final lines of that poem echo inside of him: “Do you think you could be that good and strong? /
“Star Man hurt Tin Man feelings. Puny Banner try to talk to Tin Man. Tin Man get scared.” Hulk shrugs; it’s a massive movement, huge slabs of muscle shifting like platelets under his skin. It’s a humbling sight, just enough to distract Steve from his own useless guilt. “Puny Banner think he so smart. Stupid. Should know Tin Man not like talk feeling. Banner fault. Star Man fault, too.”
Thor studied him, then nodded. He turned to Bruce. “I do not need a mask, correct?”
“Dude, I figured out years ago that Nat’s hot because she’s terrifying. Where have you been?”
“Yes, Boss?”
“I dunno, kid,” Tony sighs.
Steve waves a hand in the air, brushing off JARVIS’ unspoken apology for deactivating his alarms. The motion aches a little, and he rotates his neck in place a few times, then the rest of his body, testing his aches and pains.
Steve wakes to the smell of cold metal and damp, aching all over. He cannot move, and when he opens his eyes the only thing above his prone body is darkness, stretching up and onwards into black and black. At the corners of his eyes, he can register a glow of some kind, a quiet green, the hum of electronics and machinery. He is unafraid, and unthreatened, and unconcerned by this predicament. Distantly, he knows that this is very wrong. Everything within him is numb.
Bruce smiled softly at him. “I know it’s hard to understand, but it’s not an equal system, Steve. Consider the impact your pheromones have on a room as an alpha. Not just any alpha—an enhanced one, who has put higher-ranked officers on their knees just by growling at them. After the sexual revolution in the 60’s and 70’s, blockers were the only way omegas were able to have any kind of social mobility on their own merits. Imagine working with an omega in the field, having to send them out into battle. No matter what kind of alpha you are, you’re fighting your instincts. Imagine an alpha supervisor at a job having to criticise the work of their omega subordinate and forcing them into Obeisance without meaning to. After Title IX, that’s a potential lawsuit that provides a company incentive not to hire mixed dynamic teams. Omegas and alphas now work together because of cheap and easy access to blockers, and that right was fought for. Fiercely. Omegas’ right to work, to their bodies, to positions of power is questioned even now. The activists and theorists of the sexual revolution argued that dynamics are an evolutionary trait that’s stopped being quite so helpful, and instead gets in the way of things. Blockers are the only reason omegas have been allowed into med school, the army, any number of places. It was how the Equal Rights Amendment got passed in ’72. So not wearing them, being against the idea of them, Posturing or Obeisance in public…these things are seen as a very specific kind of political statement.”
Tony hears as Steve backs into the elevator, picking up his shield. He keeps his gaze steady, keeps his mask on.
“Not for a while,” Rhodey replies. He’s thrown back by the might of a blast from Amora, her eyes wild with fury. The Winter Soldier is back up, shooting at his faceplate. “I got this.”
“I understand,” Steve said. He took another sip of water. “I guess we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it, huh?”
“Lover’s spat over?” Beth asks sweetly, and Steve grits his teeth.
"Pancakes. Lots and lots of buttermilk pancakes."
“This man would have killed you,” Thor says, as though Tony hadn’t heard him the first few times.
“You are notorious for hiding your hurts,” Stephen repeats, and Tony frowns at him. “For you to mention the issue, willingly, signalled to me that there were dire circumstances involved.”
Tony sighs. He straightens up, wiping a hand over his face. “Did you put the time in so Pepper knows?”
“Steve was so dedicated to the whole, Victorian pining from afar thing,” Tony jokes, but there’s no humour in it, and
“Black Swan is a 2010 psychological horror film starring Natalie Portman,” JARVIS replies immediately, well used to this kind of inquiry. “Shall I read the full Wikipedia summary for you while you shower, Captain?”
‘Even the Warhols?’ Pepper replies almost instantaneously, innocent as a blood-lipped lion. ‘It will be a pity to see them go; they were Tony’s favourite.’
By the way there, Mr. Tin Man
“If you do that,” Tony said, amused, “I’m not going to be able to finish this.”
“No,” he says, and Steve’s heart twists in his chest.
“You wouldn’t have even been there if Loki didn’t ask you to be,” Tony says, and Thor closes his eyes and lets out a heavy breath. “Loki wanted him dead, and so you killed him.”
“You think you’re a regular curly wolf, but look at you; fat’s in the fire, and the town drunkard’s gotta fish you out of the brush by your ankles,” Tony griped, urging Flower on a little faster. “Stay with me, Rogers. Look alive.”
“You want to see who gets picked, don’t you?” Bruce asked, mindful of the ears around him. “It’s okay.”
it scares the hell out of me,” Bruce says. “So you know I know what I’m saying when I tell you to ask for what you want from us.”
Bruce smiles. “Tony, whose territory is this?”
“I haven’t yet,” Tony says, but it’s a half-hearted protest.
“I never asked you to kill someone for me,” Tony says, and his shoulders are shaking now. He’s about four breaths from calling the armour, Steve can tell. “It’s not the same. In fact, I explicitly said-”
“‘Kay, Tony,” Steve slurred, and that was the last thing he remembered for a while.
“I’m afraid not, sir.”
"Are you here to harm anyone on my team?"
“Let me make something very clear, Captain,” she says, folding the StarkPad into its case and tucking it under her arm. “You are here only by the grace, blood, and sweat of Stark Industries. Doctor Erskine’s original project succeeded because of Stark Industries technology, your legacy ballooned instead of fading into oblivion largely because of Stark Industries’ licensing and distribution of Captain America merchandise, and you were only found in the ice because Howard Stark made sure that said licensing and distribution of Captain America patented materials funded the search for your remains into perpetuity. You have a home, and a job, and a shield because of Stark Industries. You are paid by Stark Industries, and any tech that you have on your person, the very uniform that you wear into battle, was personally designed by Tony. In short, Howard and Tony Stark are the only reason that you exist, as you are, right now. They are why you are alive.”
“I’ll have someone drop us off, parking in midtown is such a bitch,” he says, and Steve shakes himself and follows behind him.
“Well,” he says, philosophically enough, “it was bound to happen sometime. What the hell set him off?”
“Did you even think about the consequences if Loki gets attached to you?” Bruce asks, voice genuinely curious. He’s angry, Tony realises with a start. “One family spat turned into an intergalactic war, and Earth was the loser. People died, Tony.”
This is, Tony decides, brushing Loki’s hair behind his ear with one shaking hand, either a special kind of Asgardian panic attack, or that was an honest-to-gods bout of prophecy. Which is confusing, because he was pretty sure that Frigga was the one who was supposed to be able to do that.
Tony stares at him, the barely contained temper in his body, and has no idea how to approach this situation. “Barnes escaped. With Amora. But I-”
“These aren’t just people, they’re super powered criminals,” Secretary Ross says, and Tony glances over at him. “There is no facility on earth at present that could safely house these things. We had to improvise.”
“What’s going on?” Falcon asks, sounding winded.
“No throwing food,” she said, and Clint fell to the ground with a thump. Steve wasn’t entirely sure how she’d done it. Clint just lay on his back and stared at the ceiling with a look of betrayal. “It’s not Tony’s fault you suck.”
“I am simply following my protocols, Captain.”
. It was considered gender discrimination in the US now. Put in simpler terms, Steve had acted like a bully.
“It felt like you were in rut,” Steve mused, and Tony offered him a rueful smile. “No, please. I’m not complaining. At all.”
“How do you think I feel?” Selvig demands, looking at Coulson with tangible fury. “Loki took my mind, my will from me, and you used my research on the tesseract and Loki’s sceptre to brainwash
“He was that fucking close and we couldn’t find him?” Clint had groused on the phone when Steve had called him and Natasha to come home. “Nat didn’t even get to torture anybody.”
"So this is who you are under all that aw shucks bullshit, huh?" Tony asks, because he's not going to take this lying down. If Steve wants to play, he'll damned well play.  "You're a mouthy little brat."
“I’m Sight Bonded to a soulmate who hates me, and he’s got a stick up his ass a mile long. I just needed a break.”
Tony stops, turns the water off. Steve studies the tight lines of his back.
“Is that so?”
“I know, he’s just…he was rubbing me the wrong way in there.”
“I don’t think so,” Tony says faintly. “How much time am I missing, Bruce?”
Minoru nods at him, then takes a step back and gestures towards Chase. “Need a hand?”
“JARVIS, fire on my command,” Tony says. “War Machine, double shot?”
“What are you talking about?” Tony asks, baffled, and Steve frowns at him.
Tony turns, raising an eyebrow at him even as he takes another sip of his drink. The ice has melted significantly throughout their chat, but Tony doesn’t seem to mind it.
Tony laughs. He can’t help it. Steve’s wry, self-deprecating smile tells him it’s alright, though. “Come on, old man. Let’s go try to interrogate the world’s most famous super-spy.”
“I know. You haven’t exactly been subtle.”
Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?
“Oh?”
“Tony wanted me to talk to you about options for counselling,” she says, suddenly all business. “I didn’t want to interrupt your down-time, after the trauma you’ve been through. Of course, SHIELD has excellent counselling services, and you can see any of the professionals we have on staff. I can give you their files and their CV’s. They are, of course, all sworn and legally bound to discretion.”
A deep, searing heat seeps into Steve from where his hand has just touched Stark’s, like molten rock into a pool of water. His sentence turns to a wordless vocalisation, almost a shout, and before he knows what’s happening he and Stark are standing there with their foreheads pressed together, shaking, holding each other up. He can smell the top notes of Stark’s base scent even through the blockers from this close—coconut, copper, something high and sharp like the static in the air before a thunderstorm. It’s rattlingly unusual combination of scents, but Steve can’t help but take in a deep, bracing lungful of it. His hand tightens on Tony’s skin.
“My parents died in Christmastime. In a carriage crash,” Tony said, trying to explain, and Rogers sucked in a harsh breath. “I’ve been…trying. You know I’ve been trying.”
He’s dressed as inconspicuously as he could manage, so as to look least like himself. He’s got a baseball cap on, one of Tony’s stolen t-shirts, a hoodie and sunglasses and jeans. He does his best to avoid anyone’s eye, even as he passes tributes with his shield on them and murals with his face. When he gets to the white-pillared building he stops and looks up at it: the tall columns still standing like sentinels, holding up the peaked roof with its little cross. It’s beautiful. It’s still here.
“I’ve got to look. He doesn’t have his horse. If he’s hurt, there’s no way for the man to navigate in this storm. He’ll die out there.”
“Lord, I thank you for your grace and compassion and love. I pray that your blessings flow through me, that I might serve as a vessel for your will. Lord, I ask forgiveness for my sins, and the strength to do what is asked of me. I swear to abide by my penances, and to avoid temptation, and to right the wrongs I have done, and that I know I shall do, for as you know I am an imperfect man who only seeks to do the right thing. Amen.”
“You’ve been bedding the guy for a month and you haven’t managed to ply him with StarkTech?” Steve deadpans, and Tony can feel embarrassment flood his face with heat. Steve can’t see it, but his expression says he doesn’t have to. “How do you usually get in contact with him?”
“Kiss me, you fool.”
“Rude,” Tony says, but he can feel his shoulders releasing some of their tension. He pours himself another three fingers of scotch, rubbing his forefinger and thumb over his aching eyes. “Fuck, I’m so
, and that self-knowledge sparks and ignites in his chest: a small ember of hope. He closes his eyes, leans back into the couch, and breathes in deep. Coconut, copper, electricity. Fresh wind. Wet earth. The old story about Benjamin Franklin’s key and kite comes to mind, and a smile breaks over his face. Tony, encased in metal, streaking through a storm. A comet. Brilliance and light.
Senator Cochran takes off his glasses, setting them on the table and clearing his throat. “You know I’ve always respected you, Colonel Rhodes, but I strongly believe registration is in the best interests of the country.”
“No,” he says. “I was lucky. Can you really imagine a younger version of me being careful? I was incredibly lucky, and then I was scared as hell.” He rubs a tired hand over his face. “Omegas are so vulnerable. It’s astonishing, how vulnerable omega biology makes a human being. To be incapacitated during a heat season. To be hyperfertile. To be biologically weaker. Omegas are built for breeding, with the expectation that we’ll be taken care of. We were super-spreaders. Heat parties, you know? Normal, in the scene, but one omega invites over a handful of friends for a heat and suddenly you’ve got thirty, sixty people infected. Suddenly, the stereotypes were electrified. Must be right, huh? Male omegas are filthy knotsucking whores. Fucking fags deserve to die.”
