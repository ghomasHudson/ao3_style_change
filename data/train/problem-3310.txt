Ten minutes later, Meg was still red-eyed but looking much happier as she sat at the table and ate the heads off of every animal cracker on her plate. Castiel was sitting with a cup of coffee that Dean had brewed for him. He looked exhausted.
Dean covered their waists with the trench coat, “Five minutes, Sam, please.”
“Oh… oh, Sam.” Castiel moaned. It sounded like a warning, but Sam went ahead anyway.
This time, Dean melted. He gasped out of the kiss and moaned as Castiel rocked his body so perfectly. Castiel had never heard anything so beautiful. He held him close, nearly brushing their noses together, just listening to Dean’s voice as he panted out his pleasure. When Dean started cursing, he knew he’d gotten the angle right. Within seconds, Dean was completely unraveled, taking everything Castiel had and wanting more. He was moaning out encouragements and undulating against the mattress.
“I forgive you, too,” Castiel rasped.
“Okay, but wait… how are you…?”
“Castiel. May I have a word?”
Castiel’s eyebrows rose. “Oh, I’ve heard about you.”
Castiel took a guilty breath, “Right. Sorry.” He looked away quickly.
Dean’s touch seemed to wake Castiel. He saw the spilled water all over the floor, heard the birds singing outside, then felt a wave of humiliation wash over him. He took a deep breath, collecting himself quickly.
“Cas… stop...”
Dean could have kicked himself. Why did he have to be such an ass? He stared Castiel down, anything to avoid looking at the cabin.
Sam paused, taken aback. Dean hadn't called him that in a while. Sam looked between Dean and Castiel's tousled heads and smiled, and Dean knew he was forgiven. Hell, if Sam was still with him, ready to kill wendigos and fight their fate, maybe Castiel would be alright, too.
Distantly, Sam felt Crowley unzipping his pants again.
Castiel didn’t dare break the silence. He joined Dean at the table as if answering a silent prayer. Aside from a nod of greeting, Dean didn’t look at him. Castiel could see Dean's world shifting in his eyes and he knew at once he needed to stay. He decided it would be best if he didn't sit around staring at Dean, however, so while Sam disappeared into the catacombs of the bunker Castiel opted to polish his angel blade.
“Does Sam know?” Dean taunted. “How bad it really is?”
“No, it’s not! It’s…” Meg started.
"The campers are fine, by the way," Dean added, but when Castiel only squinted harder at his arm, Dean sighed and added, "I'm good." He shifted his arm to prove it and doused the resulting pain with a rough smirk. "Why don't you go check on Sam?"
Dean didn’t open his eyes.
His head spun as he felt Dean’s boot tap his straining cock. Sam sputtered, and Dean could tell it would have been a groan if he could breathe properly. Dean gave him just enough room to breathe so he could tease Sam's cock without consequence.
“Shut up.” Dean glowered at him. “And get me a popsicle.”
“Ha! There we go,” Dean grinned.
Before Sam could prepare himself, Dean knelt down and slid his lips around Sam’s cock.
For some reason, it wasn’t ghosts or demons that surfaced in his mind as he sat there, listening to the pounding of blood in his ears, it was something Garth said at the Roadhouse. Castiel realized in that moment that he’d been dwelling over it for a while.
It took practice to get good at fucking Castiel. Fortunately, Dean had had a lot of practice. He knew exactly how fast and how hard to thrust to get Castiel to start panting. He knew the perfect spot to make Castiel shudder and gasp. Once Castiel started moaning Dean’s name and arching his back, Dean knew he was close. He reared up and took full control, working his hips like a porn star. Castiel's cock was leaking onto the Metallica shirt as he writhed in ecstasy.
Sam laughed.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
Castiel had been a medical student at St. Francis. He and his wife both worked there for years, but after Meg’s untimely death Castiel left the hospital to care for his children. He’d been less than six months from becoming a registered physician and had been one of the most promising young doctors.
The silence grew louder.
The hallway was cool and quiet, and Castiel could hear his kids murmuring to each other again. He closed the attic up, locked it, and tucked the string out of sight.
It was common around this time to see out-of-towners in Derby, due to the popular Rock River Rapids aquatic park and the outdoor Field Station, in front of which stood a life-size tyrannosaurus rex, but one unfamiliar SUV stood out among all the others that afternoon. It was an older model, brown SUV, and it had a bright orange moving trailer in tow.
Gabriel snapped the lights on and caught Dean aiming a shotgun at him with his pants around his thighs. He was flushed, breathless, and very erect.
“Hey!”
Dean collapsed on their bed, groaning miserably.
“Same time tomorrow?” Crowley purred, “Let’s try to knock you out for thirty minutes, hmm?”
“Hey,” Dean spotted the fixed wall, “nice work.”
Sam gasped, “Crowley!”
“Dean...” Castiel growled, “I think I understand now.”
Sam sometimes gave Gabriel a look that Dean referred to as ‘bitch-face’, but Gabriel better. It was a knowing, goading look that never failed to get Gabriel going, and it was look he gave Gabriel in that moment, despite being breathless with want. Gabriel grinned and opened Sam’s mouth. Sam rested his chin on the seat obediently while Gabriel placed the gag into his mouth. He smoothed his thumb up Sam’s tongue, because he could, then popped his fingers out and tied the strap around his head.
Castiel watched from the kitchen window as the Impala streaked away, then he headed to his office to work. He managed to get a lot done, and he even had time to unpack the last few boxes. After he finished he went upstairs to put the folded-up cardboard in the attic with all the other empty containers. He pulled the string in the upstairs hallway and climbed up the rickety, folding stairs.
A powerful need suddenly rose in Dean and he started to fight back. He wanted Sam to consent to this, not just be driven by his Alpha brain. He needed Sam’s consent. Dean remembered what it was like when they were kids. When Sam went into his ruts, he locked himself away in his room because he was so afraid of hurting someone. Dean couldn’t let Sam feel like that again.
Unfurling them was like taking off a heavy coat after a very, very long day. He stretched them out and was surprised by how good it felt. They didn't hurt any more, but Castiel never presumed they would feel
“Fine,” Castiel said, although an unexpected sound from his stomach betrayed him.
It hadn’t been entirely Ketch’s fault. Sam had certainly played his part.
“Fuck.”
"Does Sam know?" Castiel asked quietly.
Ketch smiled, then pushed Sam down onto his knees, “Then I’d have to put you in your place.”
“But you forgot the pizza,” she purred, smirking wider than ever. “
Sam bit back a smile. He continued getting undressed, “You know. Most people fill the tub with water before they get in.”
They met a similar welcome at the grocery store. A few people greeted him, although none of them lived in his neighborhood. While waiting in the check-out lane, a woman came up to them and asked if Meg was her new daycare attendee. Castiel recognized her from the daycare’s website at once. She had olive skin, pretty eyes, and a wide, welcoming smile.
Finally Sam relented. “Alright... What’s up?”
Sam looked at him hotly, and nodded.
Dean didn’t seem to care. He was in a daze. He’d never seen Castiel wearing those kind of clothes.
“You want it so bad, don’t you?” Gabriel goaded him, running his fingers over Sam’s firm, muscular stomach, “You want to be filled up so bad. You want me to breed you full of nephilims...”
“No," Dean said firmly.
When Dean came back into the kitchen with the compound and some tools, Castiel looked away awkwardly.
“Hannah,” he said.
Suddenly, Castiel saw Dean’s eyes flash upwards. Before Castiel could even turn around, Dean had grabbed the rifle beside them and fired. Castiel didn’t need to ask why. He could feel the dark presence behind him retreat, but only momentarily. He finished tying up Dean’s knee with surprising speed. When he released it, Dean felt like his leg was being compressed from all sides. Castiel sat him up slowly, but Dean’s breathing instantly became shallow. Castiel could feel it, too. The flames were consuming all the oxygen in the room and they could no longer see the outside through the front doorway. Castiel tried not to think about it.
Crowley raised a brow back at him. He went to the table without any more explanation. Sam watched him, waiting with his pants around his butt. Crowley returned with a something small and metal in his hand. It sent a Sam fresh wave of arousal down his spine.
As much as Dean wanted to know what Ketch’s cum tasted like, he didn’t want to be throat knotted, so when Ketch’s smell became stronger than ever, he grabbed his hips and pushed him off. Ketch stared down, pupils blown. Dean’s lips were swollen and his eyes were dark with promise.
Urged on by what was most likely a dream of some kind, Sam thrust slowly in Dean’s ass, leaking precum and wetting his insides again. Dean’s breathing went shallow. He was erect in seconds. Call it Omega heat or whatever, but Dean could feel his channel tingling and urging Sam on, blissed out in satisfaction at being used. Sam nuzzled Dean’s neck, scenting him more. Dean groaned. Sam was claiming him in his sleep. His hand flew to his cock and he began stroking himself between his belly and the floor. Sam’s knot was full again, and Dean could feel the weight of it pressing him into the floor. He yanked his arm out of the way, and just humped the floor while Sam sleep fucked him at a teasingly uncoordinated pace. The motions of Dean’s hips aided Sam’s cock in sliding back and forth, and Sam soon orgasmed with a pleasured whine, spilling his seed deep in Dean’s plugged hole. The effort woke him and Sam slowly realized what was going on. He felt Dean rolling his hips, pinned beneath him but awake.
Castiel shut the door behind them then led Dean into his connected office. Dean sat himself in the chair beside Castiel’s desk with a huge effort. Castiel was watching him sadly.
“So uh...”
“Mr. Shurley...” Kaia said seriously, “There was a kid crouching in the corner!”
Castiel put the pot aside and got down on the floor. He took a deep breath, and opened the cabinet beneath the sink. He looked past the cleaning supplies to the silvery pipes coming out of the wall. There was a stain there. It had been there since he moved in. He strained to listen, but he didn’t hear the creak again.
“I’m going to let you off easy tonight, Sammy. Because I’m so impressed. Your body wants me so bad, it can’t get enough of me, can it? Swallowing up every... last... inch...” He punctuated each word with a deep thrust, then he angled his cock down, giving it a slow, practiced rub into Sam’s prostate.
“You can do better than that.” A low, drawling voice coated the room. It was patient but severe, and it sent angry chills down Dean’s spine.
Dean gave him a distant look, then sipped his flask in the passenger’s seat.
“If you need me I’ll just be unpacking the office down the hall,” Castiel cleared his throat, and his thoughts. “Meg’s in the living room but she shouldn’t bother you.”
“Oh yeah, talk dirty to me.” Gabriel snapped again, disrobing himself, then hoisted Dean into the middle of the bed.
Sam's palm hit the table rather forcefully. “Uh… fine. Great! Actually. H...how are you?”
A large white van with the word ‘GhostFacers’ was pulling into Castiel’s driveway. Dean stared at it in disbelief. Castiel closed his eyes in defeat.
"Kind of hard to miss when you're over there preening."
From five to thirty, Cain went all out. Dean’s cock and balls were stimulated constantly, and his inner thighs were red and throbbing. His stomach and chest hadn’t escaped the torment either, especially after Cain found a sweet spot between Dean’s cock and belly button that was just as sensitive as his inner thighs. That, too, bore the marks of the cane.
Dean took a breath. “Right.”
Castiel smiled at her. “How about this weekend?”
“Cas…” he murmured, but no more words came to him. He suddenly felt helpless, unable to communicate. He realized, perhaps inappropriately that Sam would know what to say if it were him in bed with Castiel. Sam would be able to sort out his feelings and express them to Castiel. Sam would be able to treat Castiel right.
“I haven’t done that in a while,” Castiel confessed.
A smile tugged at Castiel’s lips. He took his tie off and joined Dean on the bed.
“What...what are you doing?” Sam said, getting to his feet.
They had leftovers for dinner, and Castiel was happy to finally meet Kaia. He could tell she was as strong-willed and rebellious as Claire, but she was soft-spoken and polite around Castiel, and she smiled at Meg when Claire wasn’t looking.
Castiel paused on the other end. “For physical therapy?”
”I thought you were full.”
“Good… good job,” he panted. “C’mon.”
“What that… okay?”
She gave them a sharp look.
Castiel gave them a piercing look, then took the flowers to the kitchen to put them in water. “We have very romantic ghosts,” he said loudly over his shoulder. He heard renewed giggles break out in the living room, and found himself smiling, too.
“Oh just shut up, will you?” Ketch sighed and pushed Dean into a chair.
Sam’s plea was so beautiful. Crowley couldn’t help himself. He came right there, filling Sam’s ass and watching it seep out around his cock. Sam could feel the cum dripping down the back of Sam’s thighs. Crowley moaned, and it was a moan Sam had never heard before. Even in Sam’s current state, his body shaking in ecstasy, Sam knew he had left a mark on Crowley as deep as the one throbbing on Sam’s neck.
It took another few seconds for the words to sink in. Finally, Dean licked his lips and said in a gruff voice, “Then you’ll get my blood.”
“Fine,” Castiel lied. “You said you had a lead on Crowley?”
Castiel looked sympathetic. “Where is he now?”
It took a long time for Castiel to relax and fall asleep. Halfway through the night, he awoke with a start. He’d felt, rather than heard, his door open and was relieved to see it was only Charley. Castiel let him sleep in his bed, internally grateful for the company. He watched Charley’s silhouette crawl under the covers then heard the familiar sound of his son breathing.
Castiel smiled back.
“I’ll check on her,” Castiel replied. “Get some sleep.”
Castiel and Dean both looked at each other. Garth was looking at Dean, but it was Charley who answered.
The conversation changed quickly, but Castiel’s mind had lagged behind. That was the second time he heard the word ‘legend’. The first time, Dean had said it. Was there something more about the house than just the deaths?
Gabriel stopped at once.
“Uh… Cas?” Sam huffed then smiled. “What are you doing?”
Castiel returned and Dean flew off Sam, who cleared his throat and was red in the face.
Dean was already a mess, but he collected himself enough to stammer, “H...how?”
“Cas…!”
“Now long now,” Castiel said quietly.
The feeling of Crowley coming on him was the most contact Sam’s cock had received all day, and yet, it wasn’t what sent Sam right back to the edge of orgasm. It was Crowley’s voice. It was Crowley claiming him. It was Crowley needing him. It was each any every mark on him, culminating in the single love bite on the side of his neck for everyone to see.
Jack looked at his father for a moment, then smiled. “Okay.”
Sam had turned a spectacular shade of pink, “Just…” he took a steadying breath, “it’s called sex, okay? And...”
She rode Castiel like a bull, grinding her clit into his hand. Castiel began fucking her in earnest and she cried out in pleasure. She shivered and she soaked Castiel for the second time.
“What are you thinking about?” Meg asked him beside him.
“I thought about it, but… that’s not where my life is headed anymore.” Castiel looked at Dean.
Sam smiled at last. “Screw you.”
The demon roared and began to shake violently.
Castiel’s hands swept up Dean’s body, feeling his muscles shivering with pleasure, “Yeah, Dean. Yeah...”
Dean x Ketch
Dean frowned, “Really? You can’t just… tell me how to do it?”
Sam felt a rush of fondness for Castiel. He smiled. “We’re doing this again.”
“You can,” Dean countered, “I know you can.” Still, Dean pulled out and lined himself up at Sam’s sweet hole, “But you’re in luck. Because I’m going to fuck you anyway.”
“Do you still have any of that joint compound left?” Dean asked from the coffee pot. “If not I’ll need to pick some up.”
Sam groaned and trembled in approval. He could feel the lube from earlier being replenished by Gabriel’s precum, and it made him dizzy in arousal.
Kaia got into Claire’s bed and Claire laid back down on her sleeping bag on the floor. The only lights came from the moon outside and Claire’s stereo clock.
Castiel turned around. He could see Claire backing up towards the house, just out of sight of two scruffy, young men holding a camera.
“Yeah,” Dean replied, “Sanctified blood. But you’re not human, are you?”
“Now nothing can get to your cock, Sam.” Crowley answered his unasked question, “Nothing, but me.”
Sam stared in disbelief.
“Any time,” she said. “Just… give me some time before the next one so I can rinse my eyes out with bleach.”
“Meg is my youngest, then there’s Claire, Gabe, Charley, and my eldest, Jack. He just started his second year at KU. He’s pre-med,” Castiel smiled fondly.
“It’s Sam.” He panted.
Dean mirrored his smile.
Dean fought the urge to roll his eyes. He remembered when Sam used to try to get him to drink kale smoothies. “Uh-huh.” He fought back a smile. “You know, she’s the one pregnant, right?”
on tumblr!
The whispering grew louder as his head approached the dark attic. He felt like it was right in his face, bouncing off his eardrums. The hair on his neck was standing up. The phone’s light flashed as he passed each dusty, metal step. Despite all of this, Dean suddenly had a horrible sensation that there was something waiting for him not in the attic, but behind him. He heard a strange, rasping sound coming from the hallway.
Dean knew that meant 'let me read,' so he stopped talking, idly rubbing his shoulders and staring at the ceiling. It had started to rain at some point; Dean could hear it in the background under Sam’s clacking keyboard.
“Yes,” Castiel paused, recalling something as if from another life. “Tod? As in…”
“I am. It’s nice to meet you, Megan.”
“Why would I lie, Cas?” Sam asked seriously. He turned to face Cas and put his hands on his shoulders. “He reveres you, you know.” He almost sounded annoyed by it. And yet, he slid a leg over Castiel’s lap and smoothly sat himself down. “Besides, Sam’s got the juice to force me out if he wanted to.” He put Castiel’s hands on his waist and leaned in to whisper in his ear. “And uh… if you haven’t noticed… I’m still here.”
“You know, Sam. I’ve been thinking about how gorgeous you look bound in leather… but how would you look in rope?” Crowley pondered, “Well, luckily for you, I have the perfect image in my mind, and all you have to do is sit there.” He purred in Sam’s ear.
“Yeah,” Dean said quietly.
“No. Not happening.”
Dazed and seeing lights, Dean pulled his head out of the cabinet to see Meg covered in exclusively red finger paint.
Dean rolled his eyes, “Whoever this guy is, he’s a freak.”
“Shut up!”
Dean stared at him for a second, then laughter slowly rumbled through him, shaking Castiel gently.
“Please… what?” Crowley stopped. He walked around Sam and tilted his chin up to look him in the eye.
Castiel, Dean, and Garth exchanged looks.
Crowley’s smirk widened, “Oh good. I was hoping I’d have to tease it out of you.”
Castiel sat at the table for a moment, lost in his thought. At last, he heard the Impala roar down the street. He got up and put Dean’s half-emptied coffee cup in the sink. He rubbed the bridge of his nose, as if he were fighting something off.
Rowena and Balthazar's shamelessly nude, intertwined bodies were draped in Crowley's expensive furs and silks, and Crowley's aged bottle of scotch was opened and half drunk.
Sam’s hands were big enough to hold each foot and massage them at the same time. It wasn’t a full massage, but it was enough pressure at the right spots, and it had Castiel beside himself with pleasure, completely undone. The sight made Sam’s cock throb.
Castiel seemed beside himself with Meg’s body. He groped her breasts and sucked at her collarbone. When his lips found her nipple she moaned softly. Castiel may not have understood much about social cues, but he knew that that was a very good sound.
“Was that really your brother?” Kaia leaned over to look at her.
Sam nodded distractedly, but Dean knew it was sincere. He angled his cock into Sam’s prostate as if in reward, and Sam shouted in pleasure.
Lucifer and Michael decide to keep Castiel around after they've taken over the world. For SPN Kink Bingo.
Jack didn’t ask what had happened, but he did offer to take care of Meg when the boys went out for a bike ride. Castiel accepted, eager to get more work done in his office.
For a while the silence felt explosive. It reverberated like an unearthly presence after Mary’s departure, but after it faded a much worse silence took its place—a black hole had opened up, producing a heavy, suffocating silence like the kind at a wake, or a funeral.
Dean alternated between soft nuzzling and kisses, occasionally coming back for one of Cas’s weaknesses. Cas eventually gave up the movie and set aside the laptop and turned his head to capture Dean’s lips. He could feel Dean smile against his lips, he must have been aiming for a makeout session. Cas chuckled softly. His swiped his tongue against Dean’s lips, his boyfriend happily opened his mouth for him.
The second Gadreel and Micheal were in their sights they made their way over to greet them. Cas made sure he hugged them both, Dean’s hugs were more reserved but they knew he was happy to see them.
I hope you guys liked this new chapter. I actually went back through the timeline I had laid out and redid a lot of things to streamline but also make it flow better. Were you surprised about Gabe? I've had that planned for sooo long. It was originally scheduled for later and to happen a little differently but I like how it happened here, I hope you guys did too. I am going to try and get back to the original schedule or atleast as close to it as possible. I like writing and putting out new chapters for you guys ^-^ Thank you all for being so supportive and understanding, it means the world 💙💚 I'll see you guys next chapter.
Dean curled up to Cas’s side pouting like no tomorrow.
“Don’t worry Dean we’ll get our chance one day.” Cas was actually really excited. Without needing to discuss things they three of them had decided that this was the house they wanted to pledge to.
“Don’t either of you read fanfic?” Charlie finally spoke in between laughs.
Eventually a doctor came out and told them that Dean so far had some minor internal damage, a mild concussion, and a broken collar bone. They had to run some more tests before they knew if there was anything else.
“You look a little sad.” Cas kissed the top of his head. “I know you miss him. Good thing we’ll be headed home as soon as finals and baseball season is over.” Dean couldn’t hide anything from Cas.
Cas yawned as he rested his head on Dean’s lap. He was looking at his tablet scrolling through amazon.
“Oh no don’t you go and try that one on me.” Dean pouted and pointed at him.
Dean chuckled and shook his head. “Guess sammy knows now….i think he approves.” He turned to smile at Cas.
“Dean,” Cas whispered as Dean’s hand slowly moved to the inside of his thigh. “I thought you wanted to watch this?” Dean had suggested a movie for one of their study breaks. Dean had made sure they were both taking breaks and staying as healthy as two teenage boys could be in college. He had to admit that Dean had really gone above and beyond for him.
He stood up straight. “I refuse to go one more day the way we are. The way we have been. Any of us could die….right now, or tomorrow. “ His jaw clenched.
He talked to his Ma a lot. She was worried Cas was overworking himself. Dean was feeling the same.
Oh Dean did not like this. Especially not when the guys next to Elliot looked like they were holding back smiles.
My college football knowledge is limited so please excuse any mistakes. I did take some creative liberties with it on purpose though XD
“If you think I am a workaholic that guys doesn’t do anything but go to class and work on personal projects. When I get the time I drag him out so he gets some sunlight.” Michael shook his head.
A pillow suddenly came sailing from the bed at him. “Damn it sammy, too early for your yelling,” dean growled now half sitting.
------
“I do.” Dean grinned and pulled out some folders from his bag and placed them on the table. Cas leaned in and read the handwritten labels on them. Each one had a different major and inside had lots of information both written and printed.
“Oh man I can’t wait until one of these two gets married or graduates, we’re gonna have so much good material for embarrassment.”
“God,” Cas whispered. Cas kept his eyes on the roof of the sorority house in front of them. Never in a million years would he have imagined himself standing naked next to his boyfriend in the backyard or a sorority house about to jump into a pool with his future fraternity brothers. He just knew that water was going to be cold. Not to mention why were they subjecting these women to this? He didn’t understand all these odd traditions.
Hey Everyone,
“Mmmm,” cas nodded with a serious look on his face. That made sense. His barista friend had seemed very shy when he first met him, he stumbled over his words a bit the first time they spoke.
He got the feeling Cas was just working along with his stuff going step at a time. Normally that would work for him but Dean figured with so many things going on at once the poor guy needed more structure, more guidelines to keep him on track. He hoped Cas wouldn’t get pissed.
“I think Gad’s mom has pictures.”
Cas was happy the next football game was a home one. He’d made a couple of friends along the way and now had a group to sit with. The away games sucked since he couldn’t go with but he did watch it live. He usually had it on when he was taking a break or even when he was working on things.
“Shhh,” The guy next to them gave the angriest shush Dean had ever heard.
“I can't….you can't keep doing this cas.” Dean practically growled as they passed the map table.
"Why don't I believe you?" Dean teased.
Cas nodded and looked to Dean. “I don’t even remember what I yelled at them. I was just so mad, tired and had so much to do.” Cas sighed knowing that was no excuse for his outburst.
“What does that mean?”
Hey guys hope you enjoyed this weeks post. I really wanted to get this up last week x..x unfortunately the store I work had had a HUGE game release last week and it was just a crappy week overall. But here we have the boys moving forward. Thank you IceMan for the house recommendation. Probably not the route you expected me to take but it was very fun to use ^-^
They boys had gotten pretty good at focusing in on work. Dean would get distracted or need to take breaks more often than Cas. It worked though. Cas kept Dean on task and Dean got Cas to remember to take time to step away.
“Yeah, Michael and me were able to find some time. If you don’t mind us crashing your Halloween night we can definitely make the trip down.”
“You’re one to talk. Okay so tell me what’s the damage.” He hadn’t really moved much or even looked over himself this whole time. His focus all on Cas. Now that he looked over himself he saw that his left arm was in a sling.
“I will, I’ll talk to you later. Love you.”
“Cas you need to take a break.”
“Damn Cas where did you learn to talk like that? The Pizza Man?” He let out a breathless chuckle. He felt himself straining against his pants.
“Alright Cas why don’t you call Dean’s coach, he’s going to need to know.” Cas nodded, he was already thinking about that but didn’t know if he should call so early in the morning. But, the sooner the better.
“Got a point. The others comin’ down?”
Dean threw his head back in a laugh, “I don’t know man. Maybe get Sammy to tutor you if you need it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He felt Cas’s warm hand on his, he smiled and opened his eyes to see Cas sitting next to him. He was fuzzy around the edges but his dark hair and blue eyes easily recognizable.
“Yes our anniversary.” Cas ducked his head and smiled, Dean could see the blush coloring his cheeks.
They all agreed on the Halloween party Dean and Cas had been invited to. It was being organized by a sports slash professional focused fraternity. Dean was pretty sure they were trying to get one, if not both of them to pledge. The two had discussed it and agreed that they’d look into fraternities if they popped up but they wouldn’t be making any commitments yet. They also agreed that it was perfectly okay if they didn’t want to join the same one.
thanks for reading guys, I am going to try and reply to comments this week. If all goes well chapter 3 should go up on time <3 <3 <3 thank you all so much I'll talk to you guys soon
“Dean this is childish and unnecessary. Utterly ridiculous.” Cas crossed his arms as he stood Next to Dean.
“No way.” Dean sat up looking a lot brighter than before. Cas nodded happily seeing Dean perk up.
“What about Gordon and Cole?”
“Okay,” Cas perked up and placed a kiss on his cheek. “Thank you.”
This chapter was actually supposed to go over finals and christmas but I could pass up some football. Not as detailed as usual but it was fun none the less. It was a lot of fun adding in new friends for the guys. I've been dying to add in Max for a while now.
“Have you told the school yet?” Cas nudged him playfully.
“Oh yeah,” Gad gave a wide grin.
“You don’t even know how it’ll end it’s so far off into the future.”
“Dean it’ll be fine.”
“We could go as Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne.” Dean grinned knowing it wouldn’t be over the top and comfortable.
Since classes ended about ten days before Cas’s last game Dean went to every single game. The last three were away games up in Oregon. Dean drove up there and along the way picked up Gad and Michael who had some time to make it to watch Cas play.
*****
Cas sighed and scrolled through more google search images of outfits and shops.
“Cas it happens. It’s not like you didn’t talk to them before. They were being rude, Alan wasn’t being a good roommate. Yes, you got mad and lost your cool. But, it’s not something that happens normally and they pushed you to that point. Babe, it’s okay.” Dean gave him a loving smile, Cas could practically feel it through the phone.
“He was in a car accident. It wasn’t his fault, the other driver ran a red light.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas’s smile grew even brighter, “I wouldn’t want it any other way.” Now he was dying to know. There were so many good options for him here. He could easily see Dean working any of these jobs, Mechanic and car restorer, Law enforcement, Kinisiology, there were even programs that would have him go to trade schools. There were some corporate job titles here and some Cas had never even thought of like a history teacher.
Valentine’s day went over great. Cas had asked Eliot a favor and used the houses large community kitchen to bake Dean an apple pie. In return he made some pies for the house.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas's roommates and the first couple weeks
Now not all of Dean and Cas’s interactions left people in heart break. Sometimes they led to the exact opposite. Dean and Cas were quite observant when it came to others, just not themselves. So when they noticed their friends were feeling a little lonely and looking for love they had the idea to see if maybe they could make a match.  This isn’t something they normally did but the puzzle pieces just seemed too right to pass up.
“Sure you don’t mind us crashing your anniversary?” Michael asked adjusting his bag.
“Talk to yah later brotha’.”
“Cas don’t do that eyebrow thing I love so much, especially not while we’re both naked.” Dean whispered.
“Nope.”
Like the girl from Dean’s class he couldn’t even be mad that Dean was the one with Cas. Dean was friendly and nice. The guy could see Dean was absolutely enamored with Castiel and really just looking at them it was hard not to root for them. He felt a little less heartbroken when he found out they’d been dating for over a year. He was a little confused as to why that information made him feel less heartbroken but when he thought about it, it was probably because he hadn’t missed a chance. There had never been one and that was far better than rejection to him. In the end the barista found himself a casual friend to the happy couple. He didn’t see Dean often but when he did he greeted him with a genuine smile.
Dean shook his head and tried to hide a laugh behind his hand.
“Sorry, you’d think I’d have let them all out last night. I am just so glad to see you awake.”
“I get how I can do the Clark one but what about Bruce? He a rich guy in a suit.”
“I know. I guess I am just really attached to the characters you know?”
The hunter slowly and reluctantly pulled away, he smiled as the Angel tried to chase his lips. “Cas, no more hiding these feelings between us. I refuse to go one more day with the possibility of losing you or me and regretting never having told you or allowing this to happen between us.” He didn't ask Cas if he felt the same because he knew deep down that Cas did. Just as Cas knew Dean felt the same. Dean didn't use the word love, not because he didn't love the Angel but because what they had was more. A profound bond, something beyond a human emotion, something no word in any language on earth, in heaven or hell could describe.

“Any time babe,” Dean kissed his cheek.
“We got an invite for Halloween.” Cas said as he pulled out his laptop. They were at a coffee shop near the campus. They decided to do work outside of their rooms and library today.
“Hey sexy, wanna help a girl get a drink.” A busty brunette wrapped her arms around Gads and leaned in close. He looked to the guys who motioned for him to go along. Micheal practically shoving him towards the kitchen.
“Oh my god….oh my….I knew this was going to freaking happen one day. Ugh,” he blocked his view with the half eaten piece of toast. “Not how I wanted to know I'd win the bet.”
------
He practically had to drag Cas along the sidewalk, while some people might be bothered by it Dean found it both hilarious and adorable. He wouldn’t give up grumpy pants for anything.
Been a little under the weather this week but I am getting stuff done. Drawings for DCBB and this chapter. Even got some writing on an idea I had for a different Destiel story.
“Hey wait scroll back.” Dean gently tilted the tablet so he could see. “Wanna be superman to my batman?” He winked.
“Awesome.”
“ABO.” Charlie gave him a duh face. Gad laughed again.
------
Dean and Cas were fully naked. Dean laying on his back one leg bent, one arm wrapped around Cas's shoulders the other rested on the pillow just above his head. The blanket only covered up to mid thigh leave crotch up fully exposed. Cas was tucked against his side, the blanket also leaving him exposed from the knee up. The angels eyes were now open.
“Please.”
“I know,” new tears welled up. “But, I wanted to do this. I wanted to have a backup in case anything came up...I thought...I really thought I could do this. I was doing it. But, it’s slowly just started wearing on me.” He let out a shuddering breath and dean pulled him in.
Dean continued to frown and pout.
“This is quite an in depth world all these creators have collectively added to.” Cas was more fascinated than anything by the intricacies of the world and that so many people worldwide have adopted it into their stories. Dean had a pile of questions and seemed to still be trying to wrap his head around it all.
“I know,” Cas winked and sipped his tea. Dean sighed, he had a feeling this was going to be a reoccurring theme between them, him being unable to deny Cas. Funny how that didn’t bother him as much as one would think it would.
“Your your car.”
“I know how hot you find it.” Dean winked at Cas only to then burst out into laughter as Cas rolled his eyes.
Shut up.
“I am glad to hear it.” Cas stood and gave his cousin a shoulder squeeze before heading for the door.
The hunters hands moved to gently cup the back of Cas's head and card his fingers through the angels unruly, messy, sexy hair. Dean had always imagined Cas's hair to be soft but this was a whole other level of soft. He wanted to nuzzled against his hair and feel it against his skin. Woah woah woah, since when was nuzzling on the Winchester menu? As his fingers ran through the angels hair he started to think maybe it was time for a menu update.
He didn’t remember much from anything after the drinking contest. He glanced over at Dean who was half draped over his chest. He smiled and slowly moved up on his elbows and looked over the beds edge, he was surprised to see no one sleeping on the ground.
Dean chuckled as he grabbed Cas's tie. “Hmmm I am not too sure. Maybe you can try answering again?” Cas raised a brow. He wasn't exactly an expert at flirting in any sense of the word, heck he could barely be called a noob. So when the next words left his mouth it left both him and dean surprised.
Cas had played beautifully as always, Dean as always was his number one fan followed close by their two friends. Dean sported a Novak baseball jersey, now he knew how Cas felt during football season. While the team didn’t make it to championships they had done amazingly and loved having Cas. He was already set to start the next season.
“From what we’ve seen yeah.” Cas had a hand on the small of Dean’s back.
“Yes I called your dad. I knew he wouldn’t sugar coat things for me. Yes he wouldn’t steer me towards something simply to make more money but he would be honest about things and he was. We talked for a while and he really put things into perspective for me. “
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean smiled down at Cas as they both calmed down their breathing after their climax. Cas held his face in his hands. His touch gentle but firm. Dean turned so he could nuzzle against his palm and place a kiss at the center.
“I ain’t going anywhere anytime soon. Way too young and way too much to do.” He gave Cas’s had a squeeze. Cas gave him a teeny tiny smile, it was like the sun came out to Dean.
“Alpha, Beta, Omega?” Gad stared at them with wide eyes.
Summer snipits
“No, but I have an appointment tomorrow after class to take care of that.”
*Story plans*
I am sorry it took so long guys. It's been rough writing recently, even drawings been hard. I've tried to stay creatively motivated in other ways. Small doodles and small writing things. I actually got a Cricut and new printer as an early Bday gift and I am gonna work on making stickers and stuff of my artwork ^-^
“What happened?”
“God Cas,” Dean squeezed him tighter.
At his offer to help she followed him after class and was quickly introduced to Castiel. She knew as soon as they approached that her crush was one hundred percent one sided. For some reason it never crossed her mind to ask if he was single. Thinking back his gestures were truly just friendly and helpful. She couldn’t even be jealous once she met Castiel. He was kind and welcoming. Smart, helpful and in his own way charming. She was heartbroken for a small while but she was able to move on sooner then she expected. In the end she ended up with two new friends and found herself cheering on their relationship and hoping one day she’ll find herself someone to love her as much as Dean loved Cas.
Eliot threw his head back in a laugh, “You say that now Winchester, just you wait.”
“So for the final acceptance test we’ll be getting the aid of our sister house.”
“No?”
“Sir, I mean actually,” John cut her off.
“I want to do this Dean,” Dean looked up at the ceiling as he collected his thoughts. His boyfriend was stubborn as fuck, and he knew he wouldn’t let this go.
“I don’t know. We haven’t really talked about Halloween yet.”
“Cas, get here when you can. Please drive safely, I don’t need two boys in here. He’s in ICU right now so we can’t see him. Hopefully we can by the time you get here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dude this is not the first time this has happened.” Dean whispered.
Halloween
If anyone's interested I was feeling much more relaxed and inspired this week I even wrote a new Destiel Oneshot
Just like at ABΩ they were given a warm greeting. They were happy to see like at the last house the guys seemed laid back. Gaming, sports talk, study groups, and lazing around. So far both seemed pretty similar. As they dove into more questions Cas was liking that they weren’t hard focused on them being athletes. That got them recognized but if any of them left their sports that wouldn’t bring up any problems. The other house seemed a bit more focused on their athletics. Cas was happy to see a wide range of majors in the house. Dean was loving the rooms. They were more like apartments than anything. The guide explained that they kept a lower number of members at the house to allow them more space and not feel cramped or overcrowded.
“It might not be your fault, Cas.”
Dean didn’t bottom often, but when he did it reminded him just how awesome it was sleeping with an angel. Castiel was a force of nature, raw and powerful, ravaging Dean over and over again and hitting pleasure spots Dean didn't even know he had. Dean was in heaven. Castiel wove their fingers together above Dean’s head and kissed him deeply.
Soon the bathroom with filled with the sound of running water. Castiel got the water temperature in the tub nice and hot, then got out to get the bubble-bath. He read the bottle as he padded back to the tub.
The Impala roared as it followed after Garth, it’s headlights fading into the night like two blood run moons.
Sam smiled weakly. “It’s Sam.”
Sam and Crowley have been hooking up in secret. Crowley suspects Sam gets off on the sound of his voice and he’s determined to prove it. For SPN Bingo.
Dean's emerald eyes lingered on Castiel before returning to the gun. "Yeah. I can."
“Yes, sorry,” Castiel said. “My schedule is a little full next week. But I can refer you. I know a few good…”
It wasn’t until dinner that Castiel finally remembered. “Sam, did you say you needed to see Gabriel?” He asked curiously.
The sound startled Dean and he looked over at him.
"Ever since we went to Heaven," Dean said. "Sam says he can't see them anymore, but…"
“Uh…”
The second moan meant Castiel was getting close. Dean had discovered that perfect pace that made Castiel fall apart molecule by molecule. A clumsy, broad hand found Dean’s head, and Dean nearly smiled as Castiel patted him like a dog. Dean ignored it and continued. With anyone else, he would have tied those hands up after that, but it was different with Castiel. It was like Castiel didn’t know what to do to show how good he felt. But Dean got the hint. He lavished him with suction like a damned porn star and pulled him deep into his throat whenever he could. He’d never been particularly experienced with this, but it was the amazing what the right motivation would do.
Claire shook her head, taking the bag from her.
"Good," Dean crooned, feeling Sam up. His balls felt ready to burst with pleasure. Dean bled a little on Sam cock and slid the ring right off. He needn't have stroked Sam, but he did anyway.
“Call me Dean.” Dean said. “Sam, you can fix computers, right? That’s your job?”
Sam couldn’t even try to relax, not with Crowley edging him. Sam moaned, unable to do anything but tremble on the verge of orgasm, defenseless against even the smallest drag and lick. When Crowley finally stopped, Sam went limp. He couldn’t control it. He’d reached a depth of submissive pleasure that he never had with anyone.
“Like this… hi-yah!” Dean was showing Meg, who was using her new moves on Gabe. Charley was laughing.
Before Castiel left he said he needed to come by for coffee more often, and Sam privately agreed.
Sam was scenting him, just like when they were kids. Except now Sam wasn’t doing it because Dean needed to hide his own scent. Sam was flat out marking him.
Ketch rose a brow.
Dean didn’t respond. He’d taken out his phone and checked it halfheartedly.
“Ow!”
A black figure had risen behind Charley, one spider-like arm extended inches from his head. Charley was slowly waking, trying to hold Felix still. Mrs. Bishop’s black holes for eyes reflected in Felix’s beady one. Then Felix snapped his tiny jaws at her and she lunged.
“You know… Sam wouldn’t say no to you.”
Charley yawned slowly. “Some guy… tied up in a small room. I think he was a prisoner.”
“Dean?” Castiel opened the door for him. “What brings you by?”
Sam sighed into his palm.
Castiel and the nurse both grinned.
“Oh, yeah, someone bit it here,” she said bluntly, taking a bite of potatoes. “My friend told me.”
Sam suppressed a shudder. Crowley touched Sam at last, and he jumped slightly. Sam cursed silently. He could hear the smirk on Crowley’s face. Crowley traced his finger tips down Sam’s back, then slipped his hands around his waist. Sam hadn’t noticed until he looked down, but Crowley had a long, silky black rope in his hands.
Castiel only left when Ellen, Bobby, and Jo arrived. Sam happened to show up around the same time with Garth, so Castiel left Dean to his family.
Sam rutted into Dean over and over again, grazing his cock over Dean’s prostate and making him moan shamelessly. Dean’s head fell back against the railing, leaning over the back of the couch as Sam used his knee as leverage to fuck him. Sam was so deep, and he came out nearly completely before sliding back in. Dean could feel his thrusts radiating through his whole body, amplified ten fold by his restraints. Soon Dean was writhing and panting encouragements.
Beta-ed by my tumblr friend
“I want to come.”
Dean glanced at him.
Castiel nodded numbly.
Claire stared at her in awe. “You are so weird.”
“It’s no problem. Officer Hanscum would give you her cabin if you said you needed a place to stay,” she smiled fondly. “Now, I need to ask. Is there anyone you know who would do this?”
“If this doesn’t work…” Dean said, “you know what you gotta do, right? You got the stomach for that?”
"Hey, Cas," Dean said, dropping his voice.
Jack didn’t fall for it. In a quick, playful movement, he grabbed her and hugged her tightest of all.
They both collapsed on the floor, sweaty and breathless. Still, Sam was surprised when Dean pulled him into his arms. He hadn’t hugged him like that since they were kids.
A sudden laugh made Castiel jump, and he looked down to see he’d trodden on the Halloween clown decoration he’d thrown up there the other night. Castiel kicked it aside. Beneath the clown, he spotted the old, worn marks on the floor. Curious, he got down on his knees and wiped the dust away to reexamine them.
Sam smiled breathlessly, precum wetting the hem of his polo. The office was filled with the sounds of sex as Gabriel ravaged him on the desk, not caring if the whole office building could hear them. Sam tried to grab hold of something, anything, but only succeeded in trashing the office further by knocking a lamp over.
“Is it true?” Charley asked, as if he couldn’t help himself. “About the house?”
Castiel hiked Sam’s ass onto his lap, and the resulting angle made Meg cry out in alarm. Castiel nearly stopped, until he realized what had happened: He’d found Sam’s prostate. Castiel grabbed Sam’s thighs to hold that position, then fucked Sam’s prostate until both he and Meg were a trembling, cursing mess. Meg had stopped stroking Sam, so Castiel took over, pumping his cock expertly. Sam, or maybe it was Meg, stretched out with their arms above their head, mouth open wide, completely lost in bliss. He arched on Castiel’s lap and moaned his name over and over again. The sight of Sam so undone, murmuring and whimpering with Meg’s simpering tone, was almost too much for Castiel. He was going to come any second.
“Are you going to narrate the pornography frozen on my screen or fix the problem, Wesson?”
Castiel could feel the weight of the silence pressing down on them. Yet, he felt bulletproof more than ever before.
Feeling the need to put distance between themselves and the staircase, Castiel steered Gabe into the kitchen. He sat Gabe at the table then pulled out a chair to sit in front of him. Castiel couldn’t stop thinking about the smell in his bathroom and the strange, inky figure on the porch. A pit in his stomach was opening up, born of the poison-like fear seeping through him. But he suppressed it all and put on a stoic face for his son.
Something about the way he said it made Dean look back at him. “Hey… Look, I am loving this,” he prefaced. “For the love of God, you can tease me all night. Fuck.” He breathed, shuddering slightly as Sam idly fingered his slit. “But… no chick flick moments, okay? I don’t blame you for anything, and if this is something you want to do then… I’m here whenever you need me,” Dean said tersely.
“Wouldn’t want to spoil it for you.”
Castiel had a hard time breaking away this time. This was the most affectionate Dean had ever been with him, and it made Castiel very happy. So happy that he realized his wings had puffed up, despite their newfound desire to hide behind his back. The resulting spark of self-consciousness urged him into speech.
“You like them, don’t you?” Garth asked sagely.
Dean was no different. He knew his only relief, his only redemption, his fate, would be that of fire and brimstone.
They both rested against the Impala, catching their breath while they resumed keeping watch. Once Sam came back and they all piled into the Impala to go home, Dean put on a Led Zeppelin song and hummed along, loving the silent look of blue-eyed realization in his rear-view mirror.
Sam swallowed.
Dean repays Sam for a fantastic face-fucking session, but a simple blow job turns kinky when Castiel arrives unexpected. For SPN ABO Bingo.
“Oh...f...fuck…!”
“Don’t tell Sammy?”
Dean wore. He was loving this, even if it was seriously fucked up. Dean felt a brief but powerful rush of sympathy for Sam regarding Ruby. This was… hot. He looked over his shoulder at him. “You can do that?”
“Meg, she...she had problems,” he explained. “She’d gotten better but... those kinds of problems… they always come back. She’d been off her meds for a few days,” he sighed. “I should’ve known. Shouldn’t have let her drive. Someone hit her and, well, she came into the hospital while I was working. There was no chance.”
“You luffit,” Dean muttered back, his mouth full of cock.
“...he had a hammer. He attacked me…”
Mooseley (Sam x Crowley)
Sam could feel Dean’s heat drizzle over his bare chest. He could feel Dean’s thighs shaking against him. Finally, it stopped and Dean leaned over him, panting. Sam couldn’t move. He gave him an approving smile, his eyes fluttering closed, and Dean was finally satisfied.
High on pain and no longer giving a fuck, Dean reached out and pulled Ketch to him by the hem of his pants. Ketch made no attempts to resist, which was as good as a marriage proposal for him, so Dean closed the distance between them, planted his lips down, and tasted the sweat off of Ketch’s body at last.
Meg giggled. “I want ghost dogs. A hundred of them. They can eat my carrots.”
Castiel had just finished and was about to go upstairs when he saw movement on the front porch. Without thinking, he moved to the fireplace and grabbed the iron poker. Little sparks of dread coursed through him as he stared at the door, waiting to see the movement agan. But he didn’t. Instead, he heard a scuffling sound. Seeing flashes of distorted faces and inky black figures, he slowly approached the door. But just as he neared the peephole, an unexpected noise made him jump.
“Okay, but, I am still inside your mother.”
“Hello, Sam,” Castiel said. When he looked to Dean, his eyes fell straight down. “Dean,” he greeted him, his voice cracking.
Castiel’s heart sank. There was a reason he’d been ignoring Dean’s texts, and he desperately wanted to sort it all out, but he also didn’t want Dean to see who he had invited to his home.
Dean looked pained. He stroked Castiel’s hair gently.
,” Castiel clarified, “I just wanted to make sure I was satisfying him in every way possible. But whenever
Castiel led Dean inside. The kitchen was clean today, and an assortment of teas were set up on the counter, presumably for Castiel’s clients.
As they crossed the road, Charley realized there were cop cars everywhere and neighbors had started gathering outside. Claire was waiting for them on the sidewalk and hugged them frantically as they approached.
Dean wished he could’ve gone to the Roadhouse with the others, but Dr. Hannah told him it was too soon. It would be a few days at least before he could get back on his feet, and then he would need to start physical therapy.
“Yeah!”
"Really?" Sam sighed, "this is an exorcism, if you hadn’t noticed."
"Oh, Cas," Lucifer purred through Sam's voice. "Such a bad angel…craving two humans. But they loved it, didn't they…?" His voice was slow and sensual, and it sent chills down Castiel's spine.
“Dean. Come on. This is serious.”
“Cas...” Sam panted out of the kiss, “Can you… do the thing?”
Crowley nodded slowly, “Of course.” He took his hand off Sam and walked around him, expecting his every muscle and curve like a prize race horse.
Then there was Dean.
Castiel smiled at her. “Nice to meet you, Charlie.”
“That’s because…!”
“Howdy, pardner.”
Castiel looked wearily at him. “I… I don’t know. Dean’s been coming by all week to help with the house. I thought… I thought I could trust him. But...”
“Hello, Dean,” came his usual greeting.
Dean grinned and put an arm around him.
“Assbutts,” Meg finished for him.
Yeah, this was just as good as the sex.
Balthazar never took Castiel for a top. He was a great angel, sure. He was righteous and brave, and he’d even gained his own following to take on Raphael. But Balthazar was there when Castiel was first placed on Earth, and he knew that deep down Castiel was a follower, not a leader, but he was doing what he had to do to stop the other angels from starting the Apocalypse anew. He had been forced into dominance, the poor lovesick pup. Balthazar almost felt sorry for him; him and those monkeys he ran around with who were always stopping this crisis and the next. That’s why Balthazar, in his wildest dreams, would never have taken Castiel for a top.
One night, something slipped out while Sam was being fucked. He’d said the magic words that ignited a spark of lust so deep in Gabriel that he pulled out and changed tactics immediately.
Dean moaned, widening his stance and sinking back on Sam’s cock. He could feel himself dripping from his cock and his hole in unison.
Sam moaned as Dean fingered his prostate, forcing more precum out of his cock. Dean stroked him from the inside, fingering him just right so that Sam was out of his mind with lust.
you could’ve.”
“You know the rules, Sam,” Dean said, “You don’t come until I’ve had my fill.”
Sam takes a bath with Castiel. For SPN Bingo.
“Do you like it when I fuck you, Sam?” Castiel rasped. It made Sam’s grip on the headboard tremble. “You like when I claim you? Dominate you?” His voice was quiet and dark, but Sam caught every word.
"On the front door?" Sam heard clothing being put on and chanced a glance at them, but was met with the sight of Dean's bare ass. "God, damnit…! Put...put some clothes on, Dean."
Castiel looked at Dean sadly. “Humanity…” he said slowly, monitoring the blood rising in the syringe, “...it is worth it. And so are you, Dean.”
Dean was kneeling on the floor of a rustic cabin, counting his breaths slowly and carefully. An antique rug and coffee table had been pushed aside, leaving a wide, wooden space in the middle of the floor for Dean to be chained to. He was completely naked, with long red marks covering his back. The only other noticeable mark on his body was the Mark of Cain, stretched tight over the taut, strained muscle of his forearm. There was no fire lit in the fireplace, but he was sweating profusely.
“Yes,” Castiel said in relief. “I think she was just overwhelmed yesterday. Thank you again for coming to the rescue.”
Ketch put his knee on the chair between Dean’s thighs, pressing it into Dean’s growing erection, and Dean ripped Ketch’s pants down.
Dean nodded, but then swayed and fell. Castiel couldn’t keep him up. He couldn’t get enough air.
Castiel chuckled. “We have a fresh start here. We can do anything we want in this house.”
Castiel nodded back.
Sam could tell Dean was letting go, so he gave him a reward. He fingered Dean on the couch, stroking him from the inside until Dean’s head was s pinning in submissive ecstasy. Sam’s strokes were slow and soothing, but firm. If Dean’s tongue was s in, then Sam’s fingers were, too. Finally Sam could comfortably fit four in Dean’s body. Sam was a big boy, but Dean loved it. Sam withdrew his fingers and lifted Dean from under his thighs. He angled his hips beneath him so his cock was pressing against Dean’s entrance.
Dean laughed breathlessly, but the sound transformed into a moan as Sam pushed in. Dean arched back over the couch as Sam reared up and entered him slowly, completely. Dean pulled at his chains, flexing his muscles as pleasure seeped into him from all sides. Sam panted and groaned in pleasure, holding Dean tight. Finally, Sam’s hips were pressing into the underside of Dean’s ass.
Sam lets Meg possess him in order to save her life. She immediately tries to seduce Castiel. Sam is so okay with this. For SPN Bingo.
Sure enough, when Castiel rubbed the pad of his thumb over her wet clit Meg moaned again. The sound was beautiful to Castiel. He moved his head down and Meg helped without complaint, guiding his lips right down. She draped her legs over Castiel’s shoulders and cried out when Castiel’s tongue replaced his thumb.
“I made that decision for you…”
Just as Castiel was about to get back up, a loud clatter made him hit his head on the cabinet. He swore, feeling water spill over his leg. The tea pot was rolling away and water was slowly seeping over the tile. Castiel stared at it in shock. The teapot hadn’t been anywhere near the edge of the counter. He looked back to close the cabinet, but the stain on the wall was no longer there. A thrill of horror paralyzed Castiel as he realized what had replaced it.
Dean grinned sleepily. “Yeah. That. But...”
It was the little things Sam loved about Castiel. Like how he kept the shower running hot even though Sam knew they’d burned through their hot water heater by now. Or how Castiel freshened Sam’s forgotten cup of coffee after they got out of the shower. Or how he stuck around to help Sam clean. And while Sam wiped down the foggy mirror and shaved, Castiel sat on the side of the tub and watched, like there was nothing in the world he’d rather be doing.
The sound was deafening. There was a crack, then a mundane thud. When Charley opened his eyes, he and Mrs. Bishop were both staring at her husband crumpled on the floor. Blood pooling at the side of his head, gleaming in the daylight. A clock ticked somewhere in the house. And then, Mr. Bishop moved. His head drooped and spilled blood as he picked himself up. When he turned to look at his wife, he was grinning—It was a wicked, yellow-eyed smile.
Sam and Dean held their breath, half expecting some girl crawling out of a well to appear on the screen. But the computer started up just fine, and slowly their fear turned to embarrassment and relief. Dean’s personal log-in screen appeared and Sam stepped aside. Dean sank into his chair and numbly entered his password. Still, they didn’t speak.
"Hello Sam," Castiel greeted him.
This is complete crack, but I couldn't
“No, Cas. You’re going to wait this out. Rowena’s on her way.”
Crowley didn’t answer him. He bent down and resumed rimming him.
Sam shook his head defiantly, “No. No… turn it on first.”
Dean’s glare faded the smallest amount before Castiel plunged the needle into his arm. Dean roared in agony but he didn’t thrash. Castiel’s gentle grip on his arm seemed to still him completely. Castiel could practically feel the last of his grace leaving him through the syringe, purifying Dean’s body. A tear slipped past Castiel’s eyelashes, but he continued to watch Dean.
Charley and Gabe were both standing in the doorway to watch. The minute Castiel and Claire walked up the back porch the boys exploded into questions.
Dean went pale. “W...why would you say that?”
“You should have told me you wanted to hear my voice, Sam.” Crowley slapped him again and groped him firmly, watching Sam clench down.
Charley, Gabe, Claire, and Meg, were standing on the sidewalk across the street in their pajamas, staring up at the house, their pale faces looked like ghosts in the moonlight.
“Why are you even here? Where you just watching me while I slept?”
“From who?”
“Yeah.” Sam cleared his throat. He smiled a little at the thought of Castiel researching Dean like a case, “Anyway. Dad told me off in front of Dean. He obviously didn’t know Dean had been into guys since I could walk. I think he said something like, ‘I have enough to worry about with you boys being hunters. I don’t need you becoming fags’.” Sam sighed, “And that was that. I never brought home guys, and Dean… well, I never saw Dean with a guy again. Until you, of course.”
Sam tried to peek at the monitor screen, but it was pointed resolutely towards the large windows. “I uh, I’ll have to see it,” he smiled bravely.
Castiel chuckled. That cocky, toothy grin of his looked even better than usual.
It sounded as if Castiel had woken him, but Dean agreed to come by right away. Castiel made extra coffee for him, set up a few activities for Meg to occupy herself with, and made her promise to be on her best behavior. She capitalized on the opportunity, and Castiel may have agreed to make M&M tacos for dinner in order to get to work on time.
Sam cried out in pleasure. It was a sound Castiel couldn’t have dreamed of. It was so indulgent and radiant that he couldn’t help but begin fucking Sam at once.
Sam was hung over in the air, being fucked like a toy with Crowley panting and grunting into his ear.
next time,” she piped up. “He has a grenade lunch-er.” Then she added in a disappointed voice, “Teachers don’t get to use those.”
although he always sort of looked like that.
For the first time since Dean had been hit with the sledgehammer he looked pained, and Castiel knew it wasn’t from his surgery.
Castiel leaned back in his office chair and looked out the window when he noticed something black and shiny. It took him a moment to realize what it was. The Impala was parked in front of his house, gleaming in the bright Fall sunlight. Castiel got up quickly.
Coming Untouched
“Hello, Castiel,” she smiled at him. She was a tall woman with dark blue eyes and a firm yet kind smile.
“Right,” Dean panted, feeling self-conscious. “Because this is how Lucifer trained you, huh? Tied you naked to the floor?”
"From now on," Dean whispered to him, "you drink from me. And only me. Got it?"
“Oh, right. It’s in the laundry room. I’ll get it.”
Bloodplay, Blood drinking, Blood as lube, aggression, confessions, consensual rough sex, cock rings, dark fic, dom/top!Dean
Dean closed his eyes and smiled, “You don’t seem to mind.” He could already feel Castiel’s growing erection pressing into his leg.
“Yeah, Sammy. You love this.” Gabriel breathed. He came a lot, more so than usual anyway. Sam wondered if he was doing it on purpose. Gabriel answered his question unconsciously, “I want your belly full, Sam. I want you pregnant. You’re gonna look so gorgeous.”
The staircase creaked and both of them jumped. Charley was peering at them sleepily. “What’s going on?”
“Sure.” Sam took a stubborn breath, staring into those acidic green eyes. "If by fair you mean psychotic.”
Although Dean bore the brunt of this insatiable void, exposed to it on a level Sam never could have been, Sam was united with Dean in this silence. He supported him without flinching and Dean appreciated it more than words could express. Or perhaps words could express it. Perhaps they were words for only a mother's ears, to be purged and healed by the gentlest of love. How cold and uncaring irony was.
“Mm...” Crowley dabbed the precum beaded up at his slit and Sam bit back a moan. It felt like he’d been electrocuted. Crowley withdrew his finger, pulling a strand of precum away from Sam’s length. He lifted his finger to his lips, inches away from Sam’s, and sucked Sam’s precum off.
“Did you guys hear something?” Jack smiled.
Finally, Sam smirked, “Well I’d say that worked out pretty well.”
“I’ll join you,” Sam said stiffly as he followed Dean back outside.
Castiel slowed down a little, making Dean look up. His green eyes were hazy with lust.
Sam was completely hard in minutes. Dean could tell by the rustling of the metal cuffs behind his back. Sam was on his knees in front of Dean with no means of relief, and Dean was half strangling him on his cock, pulling that leash to keep him moving.
Dean had all the power and blood lust of Sam, but none of the style. Dean was all swagger and sarcasm, coated in whiskey and topped with a short temper. Why the King of Hell let his asshole of a brother stroll through whenever he pleased was beyond them.
Crowley walked around Sam, not showing him what he’d taken from the table, “So Sam. I’ve been thinking.” He hummed, “We’ve done just about everything, haven’t we? The chains, the restraints, the toys...” Crowley came to a halt behind Sam, “...all but the one thing I’ve been dying to try most.” Crowley knelt behind him.
Gabriel chuckled.
Back in Wichita, Sam Winchester was exhausted. He had spent all weekend at the hospital. When he had returned that Thursday night to see Dean, he was surprised to find him in a solemn mood. Sam was no stranger to seeing his older brother struggle, but it had been a long time since anything seemed to shake him so much. It took Sam all weekend to get Dean to tell him what was wrong. It was only after Sam got angry with him for putting off finding a physical therapist that Dean finally broke down and told him about the phone call.
Sam and Castiel had a perfectly normal conversation while Dean hid, tormenting Sam’s cock with pleasure. It was a perfectly normal conversation to Castiel, anyway. Sam kept shutting his eyes and stuttering when Dean swallowed. When Dean played with head, Sam's voice would raise mid sentence. Every attempt to shake Castiel off failed miserably.
Sam swallowed. He opened his mouth to respond with a better, more convincing response, but Crowley cut him off.
“Wow, they cut open your knee?” Claire was asking.
Gabriel looked at him curiously.
"Next time we're inviting Cas to watch," Dean murmured playfully in Sam's ear, putting an arm around him. "You never knot out of heat, you kinky son-of-a—"
Castiel didn’t know how to respond. It seemed not even the new, flighty Castiel knew what to say. So Castiel merely rolled back over and let Dean lay next to him in silence. The warmth of Dean’s side against his back was comforting, and Castiel’s quiet, breathy sobs soon subsided.
Sure enough, Sam’s expression opened up. His head dropped on the table and he took a shaky breath. His face was still slack with sleep and his hair was tousled. “What do you want to know?”
Castiel watched him leave in vague concern, but he didn't ask questions. The Winchesters had never been prime examples of healthy coping mechanisms. Far be it from Castiel to stop Sam from going off on his own, especially if Dean didn't have issue with it. Castiel listened to Sam's footfalls fade and the heavy door swing shut.
Castiel nearly fell off the table.
Claire didn’t answer. Finally she asked, “How’d you know something was out there?” She saw Kaia’s outline shrug.
“You’re an idiot,” Dean said in disbelief, even as he held Castiel’s hand tight.
Sam exchanged an awkward smile with the janitor who was the only other person in the elevator and watched the doors slide closed.
Dean turned in early. Sam didn’t say a word. He was too tired to keep asking the same questions over and over again. Dean was grateful.
“Can I take a shower first?” Sam’s smile warmed.
Sam Wesson
Dean caught it gingerly. Sam gave him a look.
Dean was a different story. Dean liked the feel of leather on bare skin since he was sixteen. It's practicality only made it kinkier; you couldn't break leather like cotton or slip out of it like silk. Leather was a man's material, Dean said. It's inflexible, unbreakable, merciless, and Sam only realized how much he loved it once Dean put it around his neck.
The relief of being free of the Ghostfacers was palpable for the rest of the afternoon. They may not have gotten rid of the ghosts, but at least the Ghostfacers were gone. It wasn’t until a bit later that Castiel began to consider the implications: his plan hadn’t worked, and Castiel was left to solve the haunting of his home by himself. The reality settled on him like a weight, compounded by the image of Dean glaring at him, looking resentful and—Castiel realized for the first time—hurt. Castiel could have kicked himself. In one short afternoon, he’d ruined everything, or so it seemed.
Sam’s chest swelled, “You’re not going to let me do anything productive tomorrow, are you?”
“Hey Charlie,” he waved at her.
"Uh, hey, could you get me another cup?" Sam interrupted Castiel.
“Yeah!” Gabe said, forgetting his argument at once.
Dean glared at him. “You know, this thing works rectally...” He warned.
Claire and Kaia went back to Claire’s room as Castiel turned the lights off in the hallway. Claire shut her door and gave Kaia a wide-eyed look.
Tessa looked a little disappointed.
It’s been a week since Sam and Dean narrowly escaped Dick Roman Industries with their lives and a stolen block of clay in a briefcase. It had been days since the demon tablet was recovered and Castiel woke from his penitent slumber. And still, Dean couldn’t accept the fact that Castiel might never truly be himself again.
Dean sat up and smirked, his lips swollen and wet. “Wait here.”
Another hit, and Dean bit back his surprise, instead trembling as the sensation hit him all at once and then spread nice and slow, licking down bound muscle and limb.
Sam woke him from his daydream, and he nearly fell out of his seat at the Men of Letters table.
Jack sipped his water and Castiel caught him making a funny face.
“No,” said Harry shortly. “We’re going to find the ghost haunting your house using a device of my own making.” He showed off his utility belt where an EMF meter was holstered. “An
Dean hefted Sam's legs up over his shoulder, leaned forward, and fucked him fast and deep. Sam shouted in bliss. Dean’s own knot began stroking Sam's walls, and within seconds it swelled up completely. Trapped in Sam’s ass, he pounded him into the bed with his hips.
“Now what?” Claire asked, seeming to share Castiel’s sense of anticlimax.
“Charley,” Castiel whispered, “Are you okay?”
just left. Only a few minutes had passed, even though Castiel was sure he’d spent at least ten just standing there trying to breathe. Castiel’s mind became overburdened at last, and he went numb.
"Oh." Rowena deflated, "Winston,” She answered shortly, "the incredibly wealthy and tragically single heir to a large family estate that I was kind of courting. Turns out the family was head of the largest vampire nest in New Hampshire so..."
Ketch swallowed and groped a hand through Sam’s hair, “Although, if you were truly smart, you’d have shorter hair. Harder for an enemy to pull.” He seemed to be speaking more to distract himself, but Sam wouldn’t let him get distracted. He licked a broad stripe up the underside of Ketch’s cock.
“Gabriel.” Sam pulled him to him, “That… that was...”
“I thought the mom killed her kids.”
Kaia laughed.
Castiel put his head in his hands. When he looked back up, Dean was once again startled to see him so exhausted. He looked like he’d aged ten years.
"Liar! Get em, Felix!" The boy named Gabe replied, holding up the plastic container.
“You’re still so tight, Sam. Even after Chicago. I’m going to have to keep breeding you until your ass remembers me.” Gabriel pumped into him at a steady pace.

“No, I’m not!” Sam’s voice shouted.
“I want to shoot a gun,” she said at once, then looked to Dean. “Can you teach me?”
A rush of wintry air blew Dean's thoughts away as the cabin door opened.
Sam watched him steadily. "I’ve been sneaking around... to drink demon blood.”
Castiel closed his eyes. Horror was rising in him like black water. His hand shook slightly around his glass. “And they, um, they found one of the children, right?” He prompted at last.
"Tell us where it is!" Dean roared back.
As Sam finished, mouth agape, Castiel reached out of the water for Sam’s trembling jaw and pulled him into a kiss. Sam rejoined Castiel, sinking back down in the bathwater which had become mysteriously hot again. Sam lay atop Castiel, kissing him into the last remaining bubbles. They caught their breath together, engulfed in each other’s warmth and the warmth of the bath.
The first man to arrive at the hospital was Dean Winchester. He was suffering from smoke inhalation, multiple burns, and a shattered knee. The staff was surprised to see that the stint he was wearing hadn’t been constructed from materials from the ambulance. It was effective nevertheless, and after some quick x-rays Dean was rushed into surgery.
Castiel smiled and kissed him.
After the kids left and Castiel walked Meg to daycare, he made a third pot of coffee and got his office ready. He had his first few house-visits in the new home. In no time at all, the doorbell rang and Castiel stifled a yawn. He put on a smile and opened the door to greet his client.
“Oh… that’s it, Cas. Come on, love. Knot me...”
Dean glared at Sam. “Hey. Go to sleep.”
“Gabriel!” Castiel yelled, but their argument was cut short.
They were sweating and panting on the floor in front of the fire. Castiel picked her up, making her giggle, then deposited her onto the bed. She pulled him down with her and they cuddled close, their bodies ringing with satisfaction.
“Claire…”
Ketch had a response prepared, until Sam swallowed Ketch’s back into his mouth and sucked. Ketch sighed in pleasure instead.
Castiel put a hand on Jack’s shoulder in a way of greeting. Jack smiled up at him. He looked a lot like Kelly, but he had inherited Castiel’s smile.
Sabriel
Sam grinned at him. He suddenly looked like the little kid who followed Dean around his whole life. “Sorry...” Sam fought back his smile, feigning seriousness. “Is this too chick-flick-y for you?”
“Yes…” Sam moaned, “Oh god yes, Dean.”
“Ma’am?” Gadreel reached out to touch her.
For the first time since Mary's rebirth, Dean felt as though he had something sturdy to latch onto. Something immovable to stand sentry amidst the void threatening to break apart his world. Dean couldn’t think too hard about it, though. The thoughts clouding his head were too blurry to commit to and yet so heavy that they seemed to press against his skull and weigh him down. The silence helped. Cleaning his guns helped. The illusion of productivity kept his mind in survival mode, leaving the thoughts to simmer in a cloud of noxious nothingness, not existing and yet existing far too much.
broke the door.”
The boys both looked at Castiel, who was smiling tiredly. “It’s true.”
“...But I always knew you’d be good in bed.” Sam finished.
of him. Dean groaned and dropped his head on the mattress.
“You’re weak, Cas…”
Sam ignored him and was examined himself lazily. “Kudos, Sam. Looks like the adrenaline and powerbar diet is really working out for you.” He picked vaguely at his fingernails.
Sam shuddered and gasped, his cock pulsing in Dean’s mouth on the verge of orgasm. It had been pressing against the surface of Sam’s body for hours, and it finally, slowly, tipped over. Sam yelled hoarsely, his voice breaking as he came down Dean’s throat. The continuous stimulation made Sam’s orgasm swallow him completely. He went numb, shaking and gasping as Dean swallowed his come and sucked his orgasm out of him.
Dean knew it before he saw it: he was completely erect. A part of him was mortified, but Castiel didn’t seem to notice or care. Dean cursed his own twisted sex drive while Castiel made quick work of his own pants. Then he grabbed Dean by the thighs dragged him across the trap.
Sam was keeping secrets from Dean, and Dean didn’t like it. It wasn’t because he was worried about Sam. He knew better than anyone else that Sam could handle himself. Sam was fine. He was better than fine, actually. He had as much demon blood coursing through his veins as human these days, and he was only a few steps behind Crowley. Soon Sam would claim his rightful place as the King of Hell. Dean liked the sound of that. It wasn’t because he was vain, or because he wanted Sam to spend all his time sitting on a throne in Hell. It was because he wanted to know what it felt like to have the King of Hell, his little brother, on his knees begging for Dean’s cock.
“Who asked you to?” Dean demanded. “I hunt ghosts, Cas. This ain’t my first rodeo. So if you want to keep me away from your family to keep them safe, fine. I get it. Hell, I probably agree. But don’t tell me you’re doing it for me.”
“You know you’re in a library, right?” Gabe, who was the shortest in the group by a head, cut him off, “Can you even read?”
Dean finished cleaning up the study area then left the room again. Sam watched him go and, once he heard a door slam somewhere in the bunker, he carefully moved his laptop to couch arm and crept out of his blankets. Dean had arranged the case books completely out of order. It’s like he was doing it on purpose, now.
“I admit that I don’t often see death from the living perspective,” Mortimer went on. “I mean to say, the moments before death are not often revealed to me. I found Mrs. Bishop’s expression particularly disturbing. I expected her to die. I expected to see her in a similar state at my office the following day. But of course, as you know, she did not die. Not then.” He took a sip of tequila and helped himself to a chip. “Mr. Bishop left town the following day. I saw him watching his wife being loaded into the ambulance. He looked particularly troubled. But he was the subject of much sympathy. To lose his children, wife, and house in one short week...”
to his own age, at least. He couldn’t even remember the last time he’d talked about Meg or Kelly to anyone outside of his immediate family. It felt good, even if Dean was practically a stranger.
Castiel thought hard about this. Dean was listening now, too.
bought a friend over. I think I was nine. He was just a friend, but dad got suspicious of us and...”
Sam's body was powerful, Lucifer knew that, but he couldn't have imagined how good it would feel to command it. To get lost in it. Sam was incredible.
“The attic light flickered constantly. We’d never seen the attic used before, you see. Then we heard noises. Strange, terrible noises. And then, a few days later, we were all awoken by sirens. Many of us came outside to see the Bishop house in flames. Firefighters arrived and put it out. They saved most of the house, but then we saw paramedics remove Mrs. Bishop. She was badly burned.”
"No, we found it." Dean said, then added, "I found it."
“Yup.” Dean folded his arms over his chest, watching Sam intently.
Castiel stared at it in resignation. He’d wondered if that was what they’d been doing at his house. He glanced at the phone number at the bottom of the poster. Deciding he wasn’t
“So…” Gabe asked, glancing at Meg. She was listening, too, but wasn’t taking in as much as the boys. “...it’s haunted then?”
Castiel smiled slight and kneeled on the bed. Dean had never been so turned on. Castiel was dressed only his vest, tie, and chaps as he slid over Dean. Despite his enthusiastic consent, he was shaking a little. Castiel kissed him soothingly, mutterings words of encouragement in his false accent. Dean had only ever ridden him before, so Castiel was surprised when Dean lay back and let him between his legs.
Sam swallowed, his jaw clenching in anticipation.
The man stepped inside graciously. He was wearing a long, black coat and shiny black shoes. As he stepped inside Castiel noticed he was carrying a wicker basket.
He stalked around Dean, letting the rod drag over his hips and thighs.
Dean didn’t need to ask.
They didn’t talk much as they walked down the long hallway to the front entrance. As they passed waiting room number 11 they heard a loud commotion. They turned just in time to see a small dark-haired blur run at Dean.
“Why don’t you make me?” Gabe mimicked him.
Dean didn’t say anything. He’d put his beer down and was staring heavily at his phone.
Dean flashed him a grin. He’d taken a condom out of his wallet.
Crowley was hard again, “So good, pet. That’s it. You’re absolutely perfect.” Crowley finally removed himself from Sam’s entrance, leaving the dildo deep in him.
Sam sucked in a breath as Dean licked the beaded precum off of his cock. He tasted like heaven, ironically. Dean savored the flavor, then licked Sam nice and slow, making him shiver in response.
Dean blinked.
“That’s it, Sammy. That’s it.” Dean said soothingly. He stood up, still pumping the toy lazily, and brought Sam’s chin down for a kiss. Dean was naked as well, and just as hard. But he’d already come several times. He stroked himself as he pleasured Sam, loving Sam’s hot, ragged breath against his lips. Finally, he said the words Sam wanted to hear, “Do you want to come like this?”
Castiel gave them both a reassuring look. “I don’t know what’s going on here, but we’re going to fix it, okay?”
Kaia grinned and shoved her.
Meg eyed her shyly.
“I know, right?” Claire grinned at her. “It’s so stupid.”
Castiel sighed. “Dean…” he said quietly.
Castiel sighed contentedly. He looked so comfortable, so Sam began massaging him. Castiel’s eyes closed and he sank a little in the bubbles. Sam smiled. He’d never realized just how expressive Castiel could be, in his own unique way. Sam loved it. He loved everything about Castiel. Even that fact that he nearly flooded his bathroom to take a bubble bath. He wouldn’t trade it for anything.
Castiel wanted to stay and see how Dean fixed it—If this house was one of Dean’s regular stops then Castiel would need to acquire some handyman skills—but he knew he needed to take advantage of the quiet and unpack his office if he wanted to start work the next day. Plus, he kept finding his eyes drifting to Dean’s muscled arms as he worked.
Sam’s eyes were dark, hungry, raking up Dean’s neck and face.
“Yeah. Why?”
‘In...here…’
Castiel smiled in relief, then took him into another kiss. Dean was still for a moment, but then he folded his arms around Castiel and kissed him back. Castiel resumed fucking him at once.
“It’s okay, it’s okay!” Jack assured her. “Let’s get outside, come on. Dad!” He shouted, urging Gabe, Meg, and Claire to their feet.
The grief he was experiencing was unlike what he’d felt when Meg, and even Kelly, had died. This was a different kind of grief. This was grief for a person still living; a grief that Castiel had chosen to bear in spite of everything he wanted to keep someone safe; a grief for the pain he’d not only caused himself but someone he truly cared about.
Gabriel didn’t deny it. While Sam tried to remember what the fuck soul eaters did to their victims, Gabriel scooped his arms under Sam’s hips and brought his bottom half onto Gabriel’s lap. Sam wasn’t sure what Gabriel was up to, so he just tried to stay relaxed. It was incredibly hard to do, however, with Gabriel licking and nipping at such a sensitive area between his balls and ass. His muscles kept jumping uncontrollably, and Sam just knew Gabriel was loving it.
“I assume that’s what you were going to tell me the other day,” Castiel said resignedly.
Sam glanced at Dean, flushing slightly, but Dean could tell he was off the hook. Counting his blessings, he sat down beside Sam and watched him work. “You really are good at that, you know.”
“Nothing. Working.” Charley hid the papers behind his back, but it only made Gabe more interested. “What are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be in class?”
“Oh yeah.”
“You’re telling me,” Castiel sighed.
"I froze," he said simply, "and the wendigo got away. God, dad was pissed." He gave a wounded laugh. "He came running and saw me standing there. I'd never seen him so mad."
“Hm,” Dean said. “My brother used to do that. He’d have dreams about stuff that… well, there was no way he could’ve known it.”
Several long minutes passed as they lay comforting each other in the dead of night, on the eve of what could be their final mission. Dean suddenly didn’t want to go. He wanted to stay in that bed with Castiel and never think of Leviathans or Dick again. He wanted to join Castiel in his isolation, quarantining himself from the world, or perhaps the world from himself. But he couldn’t. If there was anything in life that Dean was certain of, it was that he would never be able to stay behind, no matter who he had in bed with him.
Dean worked Sam’s cock like a pro, making his eyes flutter and threaten to shut tight with long, teasing strokes.
Sam moaned, pressing his hips against Dean.
Gabriel’s face lit up deviously. “Oh I’m in. I’m so in.”
“Why didn't you ask me sooner? It's on route 83 just past the diner."
with him. Castiel slept with a complete stranger. He’d never done anything like that in his life. He felt sick with himself.
“Ah. I’m a little late, then,” Dean said. “Welcome to the neighborhood anyway.”
“Is everything okay?”
“So uh...” Sam said, anything to break the tension, “You must have your hands full with this prankster running around here.” He gestured vaguely to the speaker above them.
Dean had already spent hours edging Sam, and Sam was well past the point of being able to control himself. He was begging Dean, bleary eyed and panting, but still, Dean wouldn’t let him get off. Not yet. Dean was slowly, tortuously, fucking his cock with a hollow flesh toy. Sam was a big boy, so it was custom made toy. It swallowed him up repeatedly while Dean watched the remarkable, humbling effect it had on Sam’s already wrecked body. Sam trembled and sore, he writhed and tried to buck his hips, his shouted himself hoarse in pleasure, and it made Dean heady with satisfaction.
"What are you waiting for?" She yelled.
Ten minutes later, all the comforters in the house had been laid out in front of the TV and all the pillows were arranged on the floor. Castiel turned off the lights, but left the bathroom light on down the hall. The TV flickered quietly while the kids fell asleep, until it was only Castiel and Jack who were awake.
Castiel considered this. “And if I go with you, maybe things won’t go sideways.”
“Many of us were privy to the more… nuanced goings-on of the Bishop family during that time,” he said. “Many of us, myself included, were there when it all happened. Many moved. I stayed, naturally. It was my mortuary to which the family, or rather what was found of them, was taken.”
“Jack!” They echoed.
Gabriel fucked him through his orgasm, until he’d pushed every last drop of it out of Dean’s cock. Dean whimpered. He actually whimpered. He clawed at the sheets and grit his teeth. Gabriel came with a moan and slowed to a halt at last.
Meg looked up from her coloring and frowned. “I’m not a boy!”
“Wildlife of Derby...”
Dean’s expression fell. “Oh, yeah okay,” he said dismissively. “Another time, then.”
Castiel and Dean finally came back outside carrying glasses. Castiel avoided Sam’s eye, who was grinning at them, and caught sight of Gabriel in the yard.
They both got cleaned up and dressed, and began covering their tracks. They made sure the bodies were burned to ash in the backyard before heading back to the car. Ketch was shocked when Dean threw him the keys.
Sam sighed again. "Alright, well, I say we head out in a few hours. Get some sleep. See you later, Cas."
Suddenly, Sam felt Castiel leaning over him. Castiel captured Sam’s hands and locked them above his head. Sam opened his eyes, his vision going hazy with arousal. Castiel was shorter than him, but he was also stronger. Castiel lifted Sam’s thigh, bending him over so he could fuck him and pin his wrists together. The angle sent wave after wave of pleasure through Sam, making him groan in ecstasy.
“Dean… oh, Dean,” Castiel panted, “that’s it.” Dean had once told him he liked the sound of his voice, so Castiel tried something new, “Dean… I love you so much.”
“Woah, woah, easy tiger...”
“Bed?” Castiel breathed.

“Really?” Dean grumbled.
“You?” Sam gawked.
They both looked around despite themselves, but nothing happened.
"Someone ordered a stripper for a bachelorette party and gave them Dean's office address by mistake."
Dean wasn't cleaning his gun anymore. Castiel wondered when he'd stopped.
Castiel looked at him incredulously.
“Ninety-seven.”
Dean hesitated, but then decided they’d shared enough in the past ten minutes to share this, too. “’You’ll never catch me, because causing trouble is what I do, and I love my job.’” Dean huffed, “Everyone will probably be getting this email in five minutes. You watch. Actually, why don’t you head back downstairs and warn everyone to trash it. Don’t even open it. We can’t indulge these… Sam?” But by the time Dean looked up, Sam had gotten to his feet and was headed out the door.
Sam shook his head and chuckled, then paused, "Wait, three?"
Castiel realized Dean was looking at him now instead of Meg, and Castiel ran a hand through his untidy hair. “So uh… the sink,” he said, making his way to the coffee pot. “It’s working fine now. It must’ve been a blockage like you said. I haven’t had any problems since.”
“Alright. I’ll be back as soon as I can. Call me if anything happens.”
“Really?”
For some reason, it was these words that made Dean unable to go on. He shut his eyes, willing himself to keep steady. He would have given all the whiskey in the world to keep it together, but half of him wanted to stick his arm into the fire again and burn off the memory
Dean smiled and kissed him back.
“I want you, Dean.”
Claire’s eyebrows rose. “Hi stalker,” she said hotly, folding her arms.
“Stupid teenagers,” Castiel muttered. “Come on, Claire.”
Dean heard someone shift over the table, then Sam leaned back, dragging Dean forward slightly.
Castiel looked over his shoulder and smiled. “Meg helped.”
The throne of Hell was nothing compared to this. Sam’s ass was Dean’s favorite sin, and he could have buried himself in it night and day. It was so tight despite the years of use, and it reacted perfectly to every thrust. Soon Dean was panting and cursing right along with Sam.
“I could use a servant.”
Castiel absentmindedly bit into a pickle chip. The salt tasted good against the tequila.
Megstiel
Cain nodded in approval. “Very good.” As if to reward him, he dragged the cane over Dean’s nipples and down his side. It would have tickled had Dean not been so aroused. By then again, his skin was so tender that even a light touch felt overstimulating. It almost made Dean slip up again, but he got to five soon enough.
“Are you sure?” Dean demanded.
Sam Wesson was caught somewhere in the middle. The pranks were hilarious, he thought, but he seemed to be targeted more than others, not that anyone paid this any mind, however, except for Ian.
“Come back tonight though!” Castiel called after her. “And text me! Often!”
Castiel hurled himself up the stairs two at a time and saw, to his horror, Charlie laying on the floor and begging dragged into the dark corner of the landing. A tall, inky black woman was moving backwards, taking Charley into the wall with her.
Leaves had begun to turn yellow in Derby, dappling the town with Autumn color. Castiel’s kids were walking home from school, following the path that went to their backyard. Claire and Gabe were bickering as they walked behind Charley.
“I thought Mrs. Bishop survived the fire,” Castiel said.
When they returned to the bunker Dean went to his room to get cleaned up and Sam started the laundry. He was able to get all of the blood stains out of Castiel’s suit, plus a stain Sam refused to let Castiel explain.
“Shibari, love.” Crowley breathed on the back of Sam’s neck, wanting to break him more than ever.
Castiel glanced at Gabe.
“Okay… Thank you, Donna,” she forced a smile.
Sam looked guilty, “I… no.”
“Hm.” Castiel was now sitting in the tub, watching the bubbles slowly overtake him, “That would explain his eyebrows.”
The Ghostfacers looked up at Castiel in unison. When they saw that Castiel was serious, they all began talking at once.
“Hey. Why aren’t you answering your phone?” he asked.
This was Sam’s favorite part; When Castiel started talking.
Castiel sighed and began playing with Dean’s fingers, “No, I didn’t. I meant it.” He said simply, weaving their fingers together.
Castiel loved Sam’s smells, but he also loved his taste. He was earthy and deep, and he tasted even better after a sip or two of whiskey. The sweet perfume of alcohol complimented his natural flavor so well. Castiel couldn’t get enough, stealing as many kisses as he thought he could get away with. Luckily, Sam had an endless supply and was never bothered by Castiel’s brusqueness.
Sam and Dean had been more of an obstacle than either Archangel predicted. If it wasn't for their pride, they might have acknowledged that they had this in common. But alas, Lucifer and Michael rarely agreed on anything.
“You still have frosting on you,” Dean realized, putting his hand on Castiel’s elbow. “Hang on.”
Gabriel was loving this. He kissed under Sam’s balls, taking in his musk, then left a trail of kisses all the way down to…
Castiel smiled, but it faded quickly. Seeing that Meg was engrossed in the pictures on the cracker box, he murmured to Dean, “I knew there were a few deaths here. Before I bought the place,” he confessed, “it’s just… all the other houses were so expensive.  I knew I wouldn’t be able to... “ He broke off and sighed miserably. “I’ve been around death all my life, I was planning on being around it for a living, it didn't seem like a big deal. I didn’t think about how it might affect my kids.”
It took awhile to get the kids to bed that night. It was eleven o’clock before the house was finally still and quiet. Despite being exhausted, Castiel went downstairs to make tea. It was a windy night and he could see the tree branches casting long shadows on the front porch. He filled the teapot at the sink, silently thanking Dean Smith.
Luckily, Dean was perfectly sane by the time Castiel got home. The house was still standing, and Meg was napping on the couch. According to Dean, the only problem they had was when Meg didn’t want any of the food Castiel left for her lunch, so Dean had to get creative. He made mac and cheese with…
“Yes, Cas?”
Castiel elbowed him.
Dean finally lost it, watching his brother so beside himself with heaving, raw pleasure. Dean pulled the flesh toy off of his cock and threw it aside.
Dean proceeded to lay wide awake in his dark room for ten minutes, silently cursing Sam. At least he’d learned one thing from failing to summoning Gabriel – he wasn’t magically attached to Dean as he feared. After all, the mere thought of him hadn’t caused the earth to crack and suck Dean down into Gabriel’s zebra printed, lava lamp filled sex dungeon. Whether that was good or bad, Dean didn’t know. What he did know was, it was probably safe to masturbate. Thank god. No, that made him feel dirty, too.
“You mean like, flickering?”
“Oh… you’re an angel, Clarence.” she smirked.
"What happened?"
Yet, all of the stimulation produced the desired result: Dean was shaking and sweating, but he was silent. Suddenly, Cain stopped, and Dean was left breathless again.
“How long do you think it’ll take before you overflow?” Gabriel seemed to be reading his mind, “Six, maybe seven times?”
Meg bit the head off a cracker.
Claire watched him in nervous excitement.
This didn’t seem to help, however. Dean stared at him. “So you were planning on dying, then? To save me?”
Castiel was dreaming as usual, although tonight it sounded worse than ever. His breathing was uneven and his back was moving up and down roughly. Dean went to the side of the bed and touched Castiel’s shoulder, but this time Castiel didn’t relax. This time Castiel jumped and turned to look at him.
Finally, Dean felt both versions of himself in perfect sync – two of Gabriel’s cocks filling him so heavily that Dean could barely move. Gabriel was panting against his back and Dean felt his wings drape over him, although he wasn’t sure in which bedroom. Gabriel kissed Dean’s neck in both realities, then he started to move.
"So," Dean finally said, "are you gonna poof away now or what?"
Dean set the reassembled gun down at last. It gleamed as brightly as Castiel's angel blade buried in his pocket.
“Have you tried turning it off and on again?” His neighbor asked. He was a tall man with long hair tucked behind his ears, speaking into his headset. He tapped his pencil against the desk, trying to ignore the eavesdropper, until... “You… you did what?” The man cleared his throat, glancing incredulously at his neighbor, who leaned forward excitedly. “You…” He closed his eyes and, with an incredible amount of skill, forced all of the annoyance out of his voice. “Well, once you’ve removed all of the… peanut butter… from the CD tray, you’ll want to take it to your nearest repair shop.”
Sam shook his head in amusement, “I’m gonna take a shower. There’s bubble-bath under the sink if you want it.” He got into the shower and turned the water on, “Don’t tell Dean.”
sub!Dean
Sam collapsed against his laptop, shaking. Dean kept up the suction as hard as he could, and Sam whined quietly, trembling all over in bliss.
Castiel eyed Dean curiously, and Dean had to fight the urge to take his arm back. Why did Castiel have to look at him like that? It made Dean feel weak, and he didn't want that. Not there, in that cabin, with Sam's knowing gaze burning into his soul.
“Crowley...” Sam whined.
“Nerd,” Gabe whispered.
Gabriel gave him a guilty, roguish look, then said quickly, "Come on, let's go save your brother."
"Dean."
Dean grinned.
Castiel wasn’t sure what had come over him, but he
Dean glanced at the end of the thermometer sticking out of his elbow, then caught Ketch stifling a smirk, “You’re an asshole. You know that?”
“That’s it, Sam. Relax. You’re still mine.” Crowley drew his free hand up to play with Sam’s nipples, and he got a little more slick out of Sam’s cock, “You’ll always be mine.” Crowley nudged Sam’s jaw and left another, final hickey on the opposite side of Sam’s neck while he played possessively with Sam’s abused cock.
Sam knew Dean and Castiel were fucking. They’d never told him, per se, but Sam knew. And it wasn’t because of any brotherly bond crap. It was because of clothing. Or rather, a lack of it.
Dean winked at him and Castiel chuckled weakly. He stood back with his kids as the ambulance shut its door and pulled away, sirens blazing.
Dean spread his legs and let Castiel fuck him right there in that trench coat. Castiel was normally all instinct and passion when he topped, but tonight was different. Tonight he wanted to claim Dean. He wanted to mark him on the inside just as his trenchcoat marked him on the outside. He took his time, unraveling Dean piece by piece until Dean was beside himself with pleasure and groaning Castiel's name.
“Dean…” Castiel tried to explain.
“Cas...”
Gabriel’s cock was spreading him so wide, filling him so deep; it didn’t seem possible to feel this good. Even the way Gabriel’s skin brushed against Dean’s stretched hole at the end of each stroke felt incredible. Then Gabriel’s hands were smoothing around Dean’s hips stroking his cock. Dean cried out in pleasure, bucking back onto Gabriel’s cock even as it pinned him to the bed. It was like it had all happened before, and yet was happening for the first time – like he was stuck in a time loop. Dean couldn’t count how many times Gabriel touched him just right, only to have it happen all over again. He felt completely distant from his body, and yet bound by it, experiencing each moment of pleasure to infinity.
Dean was well aware of his good looks. However he wasn’t egotistical about it. He had his insecurities and was rather modest at his core. Castiel was less aware of his universally good looks. The only thing he knew about his looks were that his boyfriend thought he was the most amazing looking guy around, honestly it left him flustered and happy.
“Gad I don’t know what that has to do with fanfiction.” Cas’s frown increased.
A smirk appeared on Sam's lips. He peeked over the toast. “Boyfriend?” Another pillow flew at him. He dodged it and slammed the door shut. Through the door they heard him shout, “fucking called it.”
All of the sudden the door to deans room swung open. “Dean I think I found…” There stood their favorite moose in the doorway. Toast in one hand and laptop balanced in another. His eyes comically wide as he froze before the scene in front of him.
“How about I try again in the bedroom?” Deans brows shot up.
“Thank you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Honestly 15 books is quite a long series.”
“My...my dad gave you a hug? John Winchester?”
“Yeah, their roommate has no issue with it and neither do we.”
“Perfect. Now we can work on our next big college decision.”
“Your parents are out getting food. Sam is at my house. My family is going to come visit later. I am going to text the guys and let them know you’re awake. Charlie isn’t back home yet but she’ll visit the second she’s in town.”
“Shhh, later.” Dean smiled then leaned down and placed a kiss on to Cas’s cheek. Oh and did Cas have to wait until later. By the time Dean finally got them out of their clothes Cas was begging for Dean to take him. It was all so slow and sweet he could barely handle it, it was amazing. Every touch, kiss and thrust was done with purpose. They’d had a lot of sex over the almost year and a half they’d been together and he had to say this came close to the most intense sex they’d ever had. He wasn’t sure what brought it on but he wasn’t complaining. If anything it just instilled how much they loved and cared for each other.
He had tests and assignments to get to. Probably more work than Dean realized. He sighed and typed away. He was about an hour into his work when his phone went off. It was a Dean. He smiled and answered the video call.
“You do know that they can turn this on us, don’t you?”
“You’ve been doing your research.” Cas felt a swell of pride for Dean. This was important to his boyfriend and he loved seeing him working hard towards his goal.
“Are you behind in your other program?”
“Right. So I’ve been working on figuring out what I want to do. I talked with my parents and the counselors. My parents just tell me do what makes me happy and the counselors seem to be trying to steer me toward sticking with football and making a career around that.” Dean sighed. Cas gently rubbed his back, he was well aware that Dean was weary about that route. There were so many if’s and Dean wasn’t sure if that life style would suit him. “So….I called your dad last night.”
Dean clapped his hands together loudly. “Alright Ness when does the fun start?”
Cas had in the past counted visible freckles on dean when he had slept from across the room. It had been a way to pass the time. Now he could count them and see them up close. He didn't need to count them to know the exact number of freckles and locations of all of them though. He knew each and everyone of them because he had placed them there when he'd rebuilt Dean's body after pulling the righteous man from hell. But, he counted them anyways because he enjoyed it.
“Cas it’s fine.” Dean had Cas on speaker as he drove home. Benny lived on the other side of town.
They talked for as long as they could until Benny got called off to work.
“That makes sense.” Cas gave his attention back to Dean. “So are you sure you don’t want to try and fly home for winter break?”
“He said to think of it as a birthday gift.”
Big Life Changing Surprises
“Woah talk about college party,” Gad whistled as they walked up to the fraternity house.
They hurried out and slipped on their swim trunks before the rest of the party goers came out. The other guys took their time, they didn’t mind the ogling. If Dean from a few years ago were here he’d probably be doing the same, but Dean now didn’t have eyes for anyone else but the guy standing in front of him. He chuckled as Cas dried off his hair only to leave it sticking up in all directions. Dean reached over and ran his fingers through the unruly locks getting them slightly under control.
“No way, they came to me too.” Ash held up a pamphlet with the fraternity's logo on it. They all got into a discussion over the houses they were looking into. The trio wanted to try and stick together. Gad and Charlie worked their computer magic and looked more deeply into each house.
They stared at each other for a few long moments. Long stares were common place for them. Hell sammy even named these particular moments. “Eye-fucking” as he so eloquently put it.
“Dean...hey...up I don’t think Cas is doing well.” He gestured over his shoulder. Dean sighed and nodded. He didn’t say anything as he walked in. The door quietly closed behind him.
“Apparently we get to put trunks on and then pool party with the sister house.” Dean chuckled and gestured for Cas to follow him out of the pool. Luckily they’d both finished up all their assignments so they could spend at the party. If they were part of the house they’d also have to socialize.
“Thought I already was.” Cas teased back. “You want to wear the full on costume?” Looked tight.
I am glad I was finally able to get this specific chapter out. The hospital scene was actually part of the original plan for the story. it was a big scene for Cas and John and went through a few variations but at it's core stayed the same. Don't worry about Dean he'll be fine lol.
“Time difference, work, school makes it hard.”
Dean woke up Cas so they could walk over and have breakfast at their favorite diner. Cas grumbled and complained the entire time he got dressed. Dean just watched in amusement as Cas stumbled his way into jeans and got lost putting on a sweater.
“Huh, I don’t know if we’ll have that pop up anytime soon but it’s something to think about.” The girl nodded thoughtfully and wandered off to go get a drink. That was way different than what Dean and Cas expected.
Castiel knew what he had to do, even if he didn't like it. If something happened to his family and he hadn’t exhausted every possibility, no matter how ridiculous, he wouldn’t be able to live with himself. That was why, a half hour later, Castiel was by the front door waiting for their new guests to arrive. Simultaneously anxious for them to arrive and dreading it, he started when he heard a car pull up. Yet, it wasn’t the car he’d been anticipating.
Gabriel carefully undid Sam’s messy bindings. When he sensed Sam wasn’t going to be able to stand, he scooped him into his arms. Gabriel was a full head shorter than Sam, but with his grace he could lift Sam as easily as a feather. By the time Gabriel was lowering Sam down, his bedroom had been transformed back to normal. Gabriel lovingly left the pool of cum, however. He couldn’t possibly take down that work of art. Not yet.
Once Dean arrived, Castiel thanked him profusely and hurried out the door. As soon as he was gone, Meg and Dean both looked at each other.
In the staff lounge, the kids were having a good time with the nurses and doctors who were taking their breaks. They all loved Castiel’s kids, even Gabe who kept startling them by carrying Felix around. Castiel knew he was doing it on purpose, but he couldn’t help but smile when the nurses leapt back from him, making Gabe giggle. Meg was the center of attention, but Claire had gravitated to the surgeons who could answer all of her awe-struck questions about brain surgery and amputations. Even Charley was having a good time with Jack and Jack’s friend Sam. Samandriel had just started his shift and came by to see them all. He was a good-natured young man who hadn’t seemed to age at all since high school.
“Seriously?” Ash walked in and plopped down next to them. Then for the next twenty minutes Ash gave them a run down of what ABO was. Michael noped out part way through while Charlie and Gad watched Dean and Cas eagerly.
“Huh?” Dean rubbed his eyes and frowned as Cas shushed him. Cas held his finger to his lips then pointed towards Gad and Michael.
“Tired them out, they’re asleep.” Gad winked and took a beer Michael offered him.
Castiel followed closely behind. He cocked his head to the side. “What do you mean?” His deep voice only showing a hint of confusion. He wasn't quite sure what the hunter was angry about.
“That’s so great to hear. How is everyone?” He could only imagine how everyone else was faring.
Shut up.
thank you so much for reading guys ❤❤❤❤ I am sorry I haven't replied to comments, I do read them all though. I am going to try and respond when I can. Have a great week and see you next saturday
Christmas
“Wait are you guys serious?” Stood up from the couch he was sitting on.
Cas woke up with a soft groan. He stared up at the ceiling, it was early morning, the sun was breaking through the curtains falling over the center of the room. He was so happy it didn’t land on the beds. Sunlight and a hangover did not go well together.
“See yah Benny.” No way in hell either of them was gonna say they missed each other, because no chick flick shit here.
“Shh, shh. It’s okay, it’s okay.” Dean rubbed his back.
Dean had been surprised with a beach picnic. They kept it simple and had burgers and pie. Dean loved that if they wanted to do grand gestures the other would love and appreciate it. If they wanted to keep things simple and small they would also love and appreciate those gestures as well. There was no pressure to out do the previous year whether it was holidays or birthdays. They just did whatever felt right.
“Cas what’s going on.” His tone calm and soft. He watched as Cas frowned and then his eyes welled up and the tears flowed. “Cas,” He whispered and pulled him close.
Hope you guys enjoyed it I'll see you next week.
“I love you too, so you better take care of yourself because I plan on keeping you for a very very long time.”
Spring break was spent in California. With practice and midterms coming up there wasn’t room to travel home. Dean was really getting worried as they neared midterms Cas was getting a little snippy which wasn’t like him at all.
“Cas supernatural can’t end.”
“Do you think he’ll ask her on a date?” Cas turned his eyes away from them.
“They’re gonna make it home.”
The rest of the day was talk of book theories and watching episodes of the show.
“Oh we need a copy of those.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can’t wait.”
“I feel like dis is a trap,” He could imagine Benny smiling and shaking his head.
I wondering if I should change the schedule posting to Sunday 12pm or see how the next couple weeks go.
That long stare held even more this time. The gates had been opened and they're feelings were left bare for the other to see. A smile tugged at Dean's lips. “So tell me Cas, how do you feel about this?”
“Dean, I have a shit ton to do and I don’t need this right now.” Cas turned and he looked so angry but Dean didn’t back down. He stayed calm and would wait patiently just like Cas would do for him.
“Ugh fine.” Dean slumped down and waved over the waitress so they could order food they’d be here a while.
“Dude we are freaking professional cupids.” Dean grinned after taking a long sip of his coffee.
Cas shook his head. “No, I am on track with both and I am doing perfect at practice.”
“You saying we in Eliot.” Ash nudged him.
“Benny you checking up on my Ma for me?”
“I gotta ask man, how accepting is everyone?” Dean was aiming for an honest answer.
He could tell she was trying hard to stay calm for him. He nodded but soon realized she couldn’t see so he answered her. His dad was upstairs but he couldn’t waste anytime so he called him as he got into the car. He told his dad to stay home and he’d keep him updated. Bart had been reluctant but agreed in the end.
I swear I went through sooooooo many different roommates for Cas everything from Donatello, Max banes, and a few others. Donatello and Max will show up later but they weren't quite what I was looking for. In the end it was a tough choice between Kelvin and Alan. Ghostfacer's won in the end XD. I think it'll add something special to the story lol
“Why don't you come and find out what else I've learned?” He smirked and with a sudden sound of fluttering wings he was gone. Where the hell had those words come from? He didn't know but he was so glad he said them as he heard Deans rushed steps headed to the room. The door swung open revealing Dean breathing heavily. “Dean maybe you should take up Sam's offer and run more.”
“Don’t take on a lot of pledges?” Dean wondered why.
Cas chuckled softly, Dean caught on that there was little joy in that laugh. “Cas...what’s wrong?” Concern laced through his tone
------
“Thank you Dean.” Cas was exuding love and affection. Dean knew just how to get him to calm down. He still felt bad for yelling but he was okay admitting that Alan and his friends pushed him to that point.
Ps: I chose Tau Delta Kappa for the letters. T representing Team, D for Dean, and K/Kappa can also represent C so that be for Cas. Soooooo the letters represent TDC or Team DeanCas XD
“No, you’re done for the night. I love you so don’t get mad when I say this but you’re a mess right now.” Cas frowned but he knew Dean was right. “We’re gonna pack up. Go to our 24hour diner, get some food and get you to eat a real meal. Don’t think I haven’t noticed how little you eat recently. Then we’re gonna get some paper and download one of those fancy apps for your phone and we’re gonna plan the heck out of the rest of the semester and the next.”
Thank you guys for reading I'll see you next week and if you get the chance leave me a comment and let me know what you thought of this chapter 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
“I mean yeah.” Dean shrugged.
“He’s my son, now do I have to get a superior out here or you gonna let him come?” John stared her down. The woman huffed and decided it was way too much to bother with and let Cas go with John.
“I love you Dean Winchester.”
“Let me talk to Dean,” Cas was about to turn to his boyfriend and ask but Dean already gave him the thumbs up. Guess his phone was louder than he thought.
“It’s the best part of being an upperclassman.”
I am back, sorry I was gone for so long. I didn't not plan on going this long without an update. Hope you guys like it ^-^
“Yeah, how could you tell?”
“Hmm, do you want to go to one?” Dean set down their drinks.
Cas slowly moved back so Dean could see his face. His eyes were puffy and his cheeks were tear stained and red. Dean reached up and brushed a fresh tear away. His poor boyfriend looked so tired.
“They always go all out like this?” Michael sidestepped past an extremely drunk girl and her friend.
Dean knew he would have broken early on if it were him. His boyfriend was scarily impressive.
Mary and John went to go grab coffee and some food for them, they were in one of the waiting rooms that allowed them food. Cas was grateful they’d thought to go get some. His mind was all over the place. He moved slowly to grab his phone, Sam had moved and was now sleeping with his head in Cas’s lap. Castiel didn’t want to wake the youngest Winchester so he kept his movements minimal.
“Dean?” He rubbed the sleep from his eyes.
“Excuse me nurse, can you let him back?” Cas turned to see Mr.Winchester walking up.
Cas closed his eyes and listened to the hunters soft breathing, his heart beat. He felt the rise and fall of his chest. It was relaxing, calming, practically meditative. It let his mind relax and for a few moments forget about the mess that was the outside world. It let him  for a little while, focus on the tiny world that was just him and Dean.
“I know but… but now we can see an end. Before there was the chance of it never ending.” He sighed. “It’s gonna suck.”
“God it’s been forever since we just talked.”
Cas read more into the folder and saw some extra stuff Dean wanted to add in.
Confusion. That was Castiel's first though. But dean already had him? He opened his mouth to say as much but his words died out as dean's lips met his. Oh, oh he meant in a different way. His eyes fluttered as they closed. His hand gripped dean's arm tighter. He had not had many kisses on his time here on earth but this was by far the best one.
He bit his lip and held back tears he had to get to the hospital.
------
“It was...scary. You’re parents were amazing though.” Cas then whispered, “You’re dad lied to the nurse and said I was his son so that I could go to the waiting room with them.” His dad had done that? Wow. “He also gave me a hug.”
So sorry the chapter came out late this week. it was a full week. Mom had knee surgery, bro had school registration, sister had a doctors appointment and like a million other things @-@ being the oldest I handled it all. But, in the end I was able to get this chapter out and I am happy I did <3
“Yeah.”
“I’ll let you know now, that while I do love you your dad urged me to not make decisions just to stay near you and I didn’t. I am choosing something because it’s what I want to do.”
“My dad is a practical one.” Cas nodded in agreement.
So Dean asked his friend if she wanted to come with him and Cas for coffee. Cas made sure to introduce her to his barista friend. Castiel did his best to keep it casual and mention some things that they had in common. Then without any other help the two fell into easy conversation. Dean and Cas collected their coffee and watched happily from afar.
“I already did,” Of course Cas had, he was always thinking ahead. “And don’t worry about him. He said to rest up and when you were healed up your spot would be waiting for you.”
“Have you slept?” Cas couldn’t lie to him it was written all over his face.
“Wait, legit they’re dating?” The most aggressive of the girls asked.
Big Family Thanksgiving
“I know I know….”
“Damn don’ remind me.”
In the end it really came down to Tau Delta Kappa and Alpha Beta Omega. Both had great connections for all of them and were very accepting and inclusive. After ending their call with Charlie and Gad they scheduled some time with Ash to go check out the houses in person.
------
“An’ pray tell Winchester what are yah gonna do from all da way out in California?”
Football
“Yes and no,” cas whispered.
Cas leaned in and hugged his good side, “I am too.”
“Dean not right now.” Cas huffed from his desk as he hunched over a book.
Castiel saw the jaw tick. He didn't know what Dean was building up to, but he knew he was pulling something up from deep inside. Feelings were always a hard subject for the older Winchester. The words never flowed as freely as they did for Sam. But when they did, they truly meant something deep and lasting. So Cas stayed quiet and waited. Waited for Dean to find the words and take the time he needed to pull these feelings up. Feelings he'd trained himself his whole life to bottle up. Good and bad. He gave Deans forearm a gentle squeeze, a sign that he was here for him. Accepting, open and patient.

Now on the USC campus there are many students some more known than others and some more known than they realize. Dean and Cas aren’t the most well known students but people from different circles know of them. The two however don’t realize their own popularity. There is chatter in the sports circles about the surprisingly talented freshman players. A couple of Castiel’s professors speak of his promise, Dean has a professor sings his praises always happy that Dean speaks up more than any of his other students. And of course, both of them have caught more than one persons attention with their looks and personalities.
“No seriously they’re dating.” Eliot said as he threw his arms around Dean and Cas.
Halloween
“No,” Dean struggled to keep himself from laughing at Cas’s antics. But eventually Dean burst out into laughter and kissed the top of Cas’s head. “......let me….god I can’t believe I am saying this….let me think about it.”
“Don’t care.”
“See told you they’d know who we are.” Dean nudged Cas.
“No doubt where you got it from.”
“Alright boys,” Elliot stood on the sidewalk outside of the fraternity house. “We’re a pretty laid back house and our entry process is mild compared to most wouldn’t you all agree?” Elliot looked over to his fellow brothers who nodded in agreement. He turned to the other candidates who made it this far.
“Hello Dean.” Cas smiled and held his phone close.
Cas understood that, that's why his heart swelled with the same emotion as Dean. He didn't care that dean didn't use the word love, because he didn't need to understand human emotion or words for this. He didn't need to understand a single human emotion to know what he felt for Dean because what he felt was beyond that.
A girl in one of Dean’s classes had fallen for his general kindness and instinctual need to help people. It started when he helped her pick up her stuff when her bag fell and all it’s contents ended up all over the ground. She took a chance and sat next to him. Dean,the ever charismatic and friendly one, spoke to her and befriended her. To him that was all it was, friendship. At one point she mentioned needing help with a test and Dean said he knew the perfect person. Looking back she realized the misunderstanding was solely on her part. She read too much into something that wasn’t there.
“Dean there are still so many more in between.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The angel stared at him affectionately. “I liked the way you called me angel last night, but i think I like hearing the word boyfriend more.” The angel smiled. Dean chuckled and pulled him in for a kiss. “I'll keep that in mind. Now let's go get food. That was quite a work out last night i need to refuel.”
Between the pledging process, school, and practice the boys were all very busy. Dean was starting to worry as they moved through February. Cas was seeming very stressed and tired. Any time Dean brought it up though Cas tried to brush it off. Dean didn’t know what to do, normally it was Cas helping him sort through things. He felt really shitty that he was at a loss.
“Guess we gotta catch up.” Dean raised his cup and got to drinking.
“He is family,” John gave her a leveled look. The nurse looked ready to roll her eyes.
Well Cas was certainly not expecting that. “My dad?”
“That’s awesome man, gotta say we get a little worried about you out here.” He chuckled but it wasn’t a lie. Being a firefighter wasn’t an easy job.
“Fine, you win this one. Especially if that inebriated college guy could figure it out from that far away.”
Like his football playing boyfriend Castiel had also unknowingly left a few broken hearts in his wake.
The second they walked through the doors Dean ordered two coffees and went and got them a corner booth. Cas didn’t start speaking in full sentences until he drank all of his coffee and made it halfway through a second.
'Rewind Real Slow' https://archiveofourown.org/works/21524746
He looked up to Ash’s bed and had to suppress a laugh. Gad was fast asleep on his stomach and Michael had an arm around Gad with his  head resting on jis best friends shoulder blades.
“I do,” Dean nuzzled against his cheek. His nose moved across Cas’s cheekbone, his lips ghosted against the shell of his ear. Cas could feel the warmth of his breath on his skin. He wasn’t going to be able to concentrate on this movie for much longer. Seconds after the thought entered his brain Dean’s lips wrapped around Cas’s earlobe and all other thoughts left Cas’s brain. It was a weak spot for him and Dean knew it.
I hope you guys like Dean's decided Major and the house they are joining. I think I've hit a good spot where I can finally go at the pace I want to move at.
While Gad was off having fun the rest of them had been drinking. Cas and Michael at some point got into some sort of competition and were now leaning against each other and were very well into being drunk.
Dean tended to have a harder time getting Cas to step away from work. He did his best though. He didn't want him burning himself out. Cas so much ahead of him Dean didn't want anything to get in the way of that.
“Oh babe, don’t cry.”
To everyone who's left comments thank you so much. I read every single one of them I just haven't been able to comment back ;-; I am going to try to get to them when I can 💙💚💙💚
“I think it’s perfect Dean,” Cas ran his finger over the neat handwriting.
Thank you for being so patient with me so far. It's been a while since I've posted and I apologize for not getting to you guys sooner. I've been having trouble writing and drawing as of late. I am upset with myself, I love writing this story and I love drawing.I had so many art ideas and I have the entire story, part 3 and the spin off all planned out It's just fleshing it out the story that I have left. I've been trying to write it out but it seems more like I am taking steps back than taking any forward. So I am going to take a break and not force myself to write or draw anything. Just do things outside of writing and drawing and if the inspiration comes I'll create when I can but for now I am not going to make myself post something. I feel like I could be giving you much better chapters and I want to. So for now the story will be paused but hopefully be back soon. You guys are the best and you've been so supportive I hope I can be back soon with more for these boys. ^-^ If all goes well I hope to talk to you all very soon.
“Are you two sure you don’t mind sleeping in our dorms?” Cas asked as they made their way back to the impala.
“Have fun?” Dean raised an amused brow.
“Cas you're important to me….to both of us. You're family, my best friend, hell my guardian Angel. I...i can't lose you. You can't keep being so reckless. Promise me.” He sighed as he head dropped so he now stared at their shoes. This isn't a chick flick moment. This was honesty. Honesty at its core. His grip on cas tightened a small degree, the angel didn't move.
Cas snorted as he tried to hold in his laughter, he wished he had pictures of that.
They left feeling really good about the house. They guys were great and the rooms were nice and they could imagine being apart of the fraternity.
“And I’ll do the same for you.”
“I am so tired Dean. There’s so much. I can’t do this.”
Castiel’s hands moved gently to Dean's sides. He felt the taunt muscle under the elder Winchester many layers. Castiel would like to grumble about too many layers but he wasn't much better. His hands slowly snaked around to dean's back. A soft moan left his mouth, he practically melted as he felt the hard toned muscles of Dean's back. He felt the twitch of a smile against his lips. Dean had liked that moan.
Dean took to making drinks for their group and company. Cas knew they should pace themselves better but he was in such a good mood having their friends here and it being their one year anniversary he couldn’t help but indulge a bit. At one point Michael got up on a table and made everyone take shots in celebration of Dean and Cas’s one year.
“Busy as hell,” Dean had to admit Benny sounded tired. “But, I like what I am doing so I can’t complain.”
Thank you for sticking with me guys it really means so much, I hope you guys liked the chapter and I'll see you guys as soon ^-^
was getting into a Skype debate with an online group about whether their newest footage had real examples of ghost activity.
“I need to see Dean Winchester. He was brought in from a car accident.” Cas was doubly lucky to not have to wait in line.
“It’s so late….just be careful, okay? Call me when you’re home.”
“Do you really want to dress up this year?”
After waffles and bacon were ordered they got to reading through all the houses on campus.
Cas nodded along, he could really appreciate that.
The second the boys walked through the doors they were greeted with hugs and a billion questions. They were happy to be home.
Why is Cas so tired?
Thank you so much for sticking around guys, it means so much. I hope I can get to everyone's comments soon and get you guys some destiel fluff  ^-^ 💙💚
“No Cas, I don’t wanna.”
Dean told him a story Gad had told him about a time when they were seven and Michael stayed the night. Gad had always slept on his stomach. He woke up to a weight on his back. It ended up being michael full out passed out on top of Gad back to back.
“Damn It Cas,” it was more of a defeated sigh then anything. He looked up to find cas with his head cocked to one side. A furrowed concerned brow. The concern filling those deep ocean blue eyes speckled with the color of a spring sky. Dean had always thought black was his favorite color, that was until he met an nerdy angel of the lord. Now black had been replaced by blue, not just any blue, a deep blue that rippled with the power of an ocean and the gentle calm of a forest brook. The color blue that he'd only found when looking into the eyes of his best friend. The color gave him comfort, faith, and reassurance when he needed it.
“It’s not your fault Dean. That man was under the influence and ran a red light. It was all on him. I am just grateful that you’re still here.”
“Mrs.Winchester?” He looked at the time, it was two am, Dean should have been home around twelve thirty.
“Love you too.” Dean let Cas hang up so he could keep his hands on the wheel.
“Are you looking into doing more than being a regular law enforcement officer?”
“So, are you letting them room together?”  The girl asked.
The phone call went better than he expected, Coach was a little grumpy but understanding. He grumbled and growled about stupid drivers and he hoped the guy got what he deserved. Coach told Cas to tell Dean not to worry about his spot on the team, just to recover and come back when he was cleared. Cas was so grateful, with so many players vying for the spot he was worried Dean would lose it. However, Dean had shown his skill on the field and that had secured him his spot.
Cas chuckled, “Yes, I was shocked too. But he did. I was having a hard time and he knew that.”
“I don’t think you do. Cas you’re wearing yourself out. We’re all worried. We talked about this.” His tone still calm and reasonable.
Cas felt his throat tighten up as they walked. He knew John had just said that so he could get through but it meant so much to him that he did that. He knew what a huge thing that was for John to do. They entered a small waiting room. Mary was in the corner speaking softly into her phone. Sam was curled up in a chair asleep. Cas stood near the entranced and dropped his head. He was so scared, he didn’t want to break down but he was so worried. A gentle hand dropped down on his shoulder. He looked up to see Mr.Winchester standing in front of him looking worried and understanding.
“I was always scared there would always be this wall between you two...but...I am so glad to know that things are getting better.” John Winchester wasn’t much of a hugger so it was a huge deal, he in his own way showed how much he’d accepted Cas as a part of their lives.
Cas smiled, he really thought of everything.
Hey guys hope you liked the new chapter. I couldn't help but give you guys some more Luci screen time ^-^ not to mention big family gathering for these boys.
“There’s so much.”
“Dean,” cas have him
Dean's Major

“Okay, okay.” He got up and pulled Cas to his feet. He clicked the save button on Cas’s computer and closed it.
I wanted to take a step back and get a mini look to those around the boys as opposed to them directly. I also wanted to highlight those they meet that aren't close friends and family but more casual acquaintances and friends. It was a bit of a cute side story in their lives.
“Dean,”  Cas’s left hand reached up and gently gripped deans right forearm. “Could you make the same promise? Could you promise you wouldn't recklessly throw yourself into danger for Sam...for me?” He knew the answer.
“Come one Cas we gotta.” Dean was reading something on his phone, his fingers dragging slowly through Cas’s hair.
“Yeah, two years in october.”
Dean had to admit the building was impressive. He loved all the wood, lighting, and large windows. He could feel the history as he made his way through the building. It wasn’t as old as you would think but it’d seen a lot in its time.
Thank you for reading and loving this story so far.
Cas saw his phone near his pillow and slowly reached for it. This was great blackmail material and he refused to pass it up. Cas could tell they still had their pants on but their shirts were tossed off to the side.
So just at the beginning I want to say that this is very very different from any other chapter I've posted for this series but something that's been on my mind for a while. I hope you guys enjoy it. Let me know what you thought of it in the comments.
Gad happily accepted the flash pin from Cas and put it on his shirt collar as well.

“Pssh, we don’t have embarrassing photos we have mushy ones.” Dean teased and yanked Cas back down to get another hour or two of sleep.
“Don’t worry Dean I promise the guys are fine with any sexual orientation, it’s bad taste in movies and music where things start getting ugly.” Eliot grinned as they all laughed. “I will say you wouldn’t be our first gay or bi members but you would be the first couple to join together. “
“Oh and let us not forget moving into the house.” The three were moving in that week. Dean was ready to check that off the list.
“Heya Angel.” Dean turned his hand and held Cas’s.
“We can go out instead, or we could do both?” Dean nudged him. “Bit like Halloween last year. Party first then some alone time afterwards.”
Dean and Cas had gone at it all night making up for all that lost time. Castiel had been thoroughly impressed by his hunters stamina. He had left the Angel breathless and tired. Cas laid there next to Dean, pressed against his right side. The angels head on his shoulder, and arm draped across that beautiful freckled expansive chest.
“Cas,” His name left dean's lips like a whisper, like a prayer. It was a prayer, he heard it echo faintly in his mind. “I am not going one more day without you.”
Their lives weren't perfect, they weren't safe. But that didn't mean they couldn't be happy. Who said an apple pie life had to be picket fences, 9 to 5 job, wife and 2.5 kids. Dean had his Angel, his brother, and his impala. That was dean's apple pie life he didn't care what anyone else had to say about it.
I know it's been a long time. I am sorry it's taken me this long to give you guys any sort of update. Needless to say this last year has been crazy. I wanted to give you guys a little life update and talk about what I have planned for this fic.
Cas stared at the computer screen looking so confused. His head cocked to the side. He could not figure out what was so funny. Gad and Charlie were in the middle of fits of laughter. Micheal watched on looking unamused as he sat next to Gad in one skype window. Dean sat next to him looking annoyed and confused.
“Your dad recommended I add some extra skills in in case I want to one day. If I want to move up or move to different departments in the government I’d have the skills to do so.”
“I don’t think so, Michael said something about doing some military summer program and Gad decided to take summer classes. Says the sooner he can graduate the sooner he can pay off student loans.”
Cas pulled out his tablet and opened up the web browser. They decided they wanted to join a Fraternity. They’d been approached by quite a few of them but Cas wanted to do research before they joined one.
“I do but we are talking about these.” Cas gently steered them back onto topic as he tapped the folders.
“Hmm we gotta get back earlier than others because of sports. So about two months I think.”
Cas nodded, that could work. He began scrolling through online stores for a pin. Etsy would probably be his best bet.

“I know, it’s not how you usually are but it happened. It’s completely human to lose your cool. Don’t worry, you’re still the level headed one in this relationship.”
There was a gentle knock on the door.
Frat initiation
Dean hid his face against Cas’s shoulder as he held back a laugh.
“Woah, I thought those were just rumors.” A few girls pouted but most let it go.
“Dean please.” He didn’t even look at Dean. Dean moved closed and crouched down next to him.
Football Surprise
Cas leaned his head onto Dean’s shoulder, hugged his arm and looked up at him making his eyes as big as he could. “Come on.”
“But the roads.” Cas did his best puppy eyes.
“Yeah, over a year now right?” He looked to Dean and Cas.
Car Show
“Glad they could make it down.” Dean wrapped an arm around Cas’s shoulders. A few guys they knew from classes said hi to them as they made their way to the kitchen. Once they got there they saw Michael with a completely different girl. Gadreel still had the girl clinging off his arm but a guy was making moves on him.
“That door is room one and that door is room two. Both have their own bathrooms.” All three looked surprised.
“He’s doing better. Taking breaks more regularly, not looking so pale. I was really worried there. But now, he’s doing good. Back to being that ray of sunshine we all know.”
“Cas, sweety.” That was not Dean.
After Thanksgiving
The man’s heart sunk to his feet as he watched them approach. Like the girl from Dean’s class he could see there was no way anyone could get between those two. How could anyone want to get between them? They looked like a perfect couple and completely in love. He steeled himself for the friendly conversation he knew was coming. He wondered by how long had he missed his chance. Was this new? Or was this a long standing relationship? How had he never known the handsome baseball player had a boyfriend?
I do have something planned with Frat houses and I'd love your input. I want to have some made up house names if you guys want to contribute i'd love to hear names if you guys have any ideas ^-^
