“I’m honored by your trust,” he says. The words are strangely formal, but somehow seem all the truer for it.
“Noo,” Iron Man says, drawing out the word. “I’m just embarrassed for you. Because of how wrong you are.” He’s attempting to sound stern, but Steve is certain he can hear a smile lurking at the edges. “It’s everywhere,” he adds, with a soft sound of dismay. “All over the blindfold—you’ll have to take that off, the last thing you want is that getting in your eyes—”
The other, deeper problem, of course—and where along the way did you allow yourself to forget it?—is that the world just
Steve hears a loud, almost cartoonish smooching sound, and then Iron Man is leaning over him and pressing a callused palm to Steve’s cheek. Steve can feel the damp imprint of Iron Man’s lips against his skin. He presses his hand over Iron Man’s, holding it in place as he turns his head into the touch, fitting his own lips over the place on Iron Man’s palm where the traces of his kiss still linger.
—some sort of oblique reference to Steve himself? When a quick flip-through revealed that one of the main characters was actually living backwards in time, Steve had set the book aside and hadn’t looked at it again for months, certain it was some sort of joke—well meant, perhaps, but ultimately tasteless.
and what else was there for him to do? It wasn’t even vengeance. It was one of the fundamentals of the universe. What’s an eye for an eye but Newton’s Third Law played out on the human stage? Action, meet reaction.
You never imagined he might want to stay. Of course you’re not going to throw him out into the streets. The tower is his home; you’re not going to take that away from him. Not after everything else you’ve taken.
Steve smiles, a little reluctantly, at the phrasing. “I’m not worried,” he says, which is almost true, “and it’s not about what’s required. I just… want to.”
Also, jsyk this coming update is the last batch of completely prewritten material, so updates after that will be a bit more sporadic.
“Well,” Iron Man says tartly, “I’ll be sure to consult a thesaurus next time. Glad you’re feeling chipper enough to lecture me, though.” There’s a slight uptick in his voice, the barest hint of a question.
And wouldn’t it be just like Tony, to indulge in that kind of—of shameless self-indulgence. His home bathroom was probably filled with scented bath oils, lined with as many bright and costly bottles as any lady’s boudoir. Steve knew his body for what it was, a tool, something to be maintained in both appearance and functionality, but Tony— Tony would view his as something to be pampered. That was what came of being—being rich, and handsome, and having the world itself dropped at your feet. Tony just didn’t understand—
“Oh! Sure.” Iron Man’s eyes—what Steve can see of them through the mask, anyway—are wide and a little taken aback, but he continues gamely enough, “Just say the word and I’m yours.”
Thor's jovial mood went a little sad at that, and he said in a quiet and humbled voice, "My brother was not always the misguided, power-hungry fool you know him to be. But jealousy is a vicious monster, and my brother fell victim to those that would seek to exploit that weakness in him and use it to further their own gains."
your problem?" Steve mused and reached out to snake an arm around his shoulders. Tony let him, and he let him use that arm to pull him close so as to smack a kiss against his forehead. "It is…a
"We know the damage that scepter can wreak. Put it in the wrong hands, we could have another event like the one in New York a couple years ago. We had a home-field advantage on that one. No guarantee we would the next time."
right after Christmas. What the hell was this nameless 'journalist' doing trying to? Who was he trying to rile up?
The water still running in the bathroom, he reached down with his right thumb and forefinger and pulled the ring from his hand. He turned it over a few times and saw there was an inscription inside of it: three numbers separated by dashes, 04-24-2014, and what looked like an etching of a robotic face of some sort. It was small and hard to really tell in the light, but it sure looked like a face of some kind.
Tony snorted out another laugh. "Steve's a very…frank kind of guy. Doesn't like to sugarcoat. Tells you exactly what he thinks about something."
Tony let out a laugh. "That might be a little too—" He sat upright and rested his elbows on his knees. "It's kind of hard to explain when I don't even think you know what a computer is yet."
"Yeah?" he glanced over to her. "Well, I wasn't about to sit around on my ass while my tower was being attacked."
“Now,” Iron Man is saying, “and not that I’m complaining, mind you, but wouldn’t, say, team training sessions be a better time to discuss new exercises? You know you don’t actually have to run anything by me, right? You’re a full Avenger, same as any of us. In fact, if this is a seniority thing, I’d say you have the advantage on me by a couple of decades, although if that’s the standard you’re using, Thor’s got us both beat to flinders.”
Hastily, he jerks his mind away from the thought of Tony, but… radio. He could do that. He used to like listening to the radio.
Well. He knows exactly what he needs, or at least, what he’s about to need. It’s just that it had been such a good morning. For a little while at least.
The Avengers are only a press of the identicard away; you’ve got SHIELD on speed-dial. But what you’re thinking about is Maya. Brilliant, ambitious Maya Hansen, a virtuoso whose symphonies are written in genetic code, and Extremis—her magnum opus—wasted on a mad dog like Mallen.
Iron Man gives a breathy chuckle. “Yeah, I gathered.” He reaches over and flicks a thumb over the corner of Steve’s smile. Steve tries to turn his face into the touch but Iron Man’s already pulling away and Steve’s a little too lazy to pursue him.
The water feels different today, his skin still strangely sensitized. The sheer amount of information… it’s as if he’s individually aware of each point where the water touches his skin. It’s a little overwhelming, but soothing, too, the way that white noise is soothing. It’s a shame he hadn’t thought of a shower earlier; he could have asked Iron Man to join him.
both of you—to your relationship. Planting himself like a tree by your side and refusing to be moved.
He eats slowly, lingering over the last few bites, just in case. When he’s finally done kicking his heels, he gets up to wash the dishes. He does it by hand—always by hand. He likes the ritual of it. He takes his time with each plate, thinking of what the other Avengers must be up to right now. Probably out and about as usual, fighting the good fight. Just like Steve would be, if things weren’t so—
. He decides in the end that the risk of running into one of the other Avengers at the gym is too high, but passes a few pleasant, mindless hours doing calisthenics on his floor instead. It’s not easy for him to get a good workout with bodyweight exercises alone, but sheer persistence allows him to work up a decent sweat.
Tony spins around and sweeps his arm across the surface of the desk, sending phone, complimentary pens and notepads, and agonizingly tasteful flower arrangement crashing to the floor. “Do not,” he gets out, “fuck me on this, Rogers. I want.
Steve has already begun to turn the doorknob when it occurs to him that he’s still naked. He wraps a towel around his hips, opens the door, and steps into the room beyond.
He knows this for a simple fact. Ever since his post-Manhattan panic attacks opened up a thrilling new world of ways for his body to betray him, he’s made sure that each of the suits contain an override protocol to stabilize against involuntary muscle movement. He could be in the middle of an epileptic fit, and the armor would hold him as still and steady as one of the guards at Buckingham Palace, albeit infinitely better dressed.
, she did turn me back into this to make it 'easier' for me—" He again used finger quotes on the word 'easier.'
Natasha just gave him a flat 'you're an idiot' look and took a sip of her drink, and Steve said, "It's not that." When the eyes of the table were on him, he added, "It's just…easier…I think to have a boy— to raise a son."
"The Goddess Esmeralda," he said, "or Esmeralda the Divine, was the keeper of fertility for the most ancient beings of the universe. It is believed she is a physical manifestation of life itself. It was she to whom couples that wished to conceive would pay tribute. She was a benevolent creature, but she was also, as I said, quite naïve. She sees the universe in a simple way. There are those that are bonded, and those that are not."
"Thinks you're annoyed with him, thinks you don't really want to talk with him, thinks you wish he'd just go away—"
Maria. It's Olivia. Which probably was something suggested by my old man of a husband, who I just— Do you think we have sex? You think his old ticker can take it?"
Barnes just shook his head a little, like he was having a hard time accepting whatever it was he was thinking. "Never thought Stevie'd get married before me," he murmured. "And to a rich feller at that."
Steve just shook his head. He reached out and began to push that 'corn popper' toy, as it was called while Tony, done with his phone, looked over what appeared to be a comic book of some kind and muttered, "And who the hell wants to read Avenger adventures featuring Hawkeye? He sits in the corner, shoots arrows at you, and makes asshole comments like he thinks he's the funniest fuck in the world. No one wants to read about him."
He pulled his hand away and looked over to where Natasha stood cradling his newborn baby girl, gazing down at her and singing something in what he took to be Russian as she bounced her ever-so-gently in her arms, attempting to soothe what Tony realized was a fussy baby.
"Daddy said we could," he said quickly, which seemed to alleviate her concerns, and for the next hour, they sat and sketched out various things. Tony drew schematics for a new armor. Olivia first drew a picture of her family — and what the fuck! The Cap wasn't
"No," Steve said, shaking his head some, nose brushing against his hair. "No, it— Don't act like it was 'nothing.' It wasn't 'nothing.' It was— This is amazing, Tony. This is—
show up, Darcy probably would because, well, she'd been at the Christmas party, hadn't she? Had she been at the New Year's party? He'd been kind of sick that night and couldn't really remember (thinking he'd had a stomach bug — good god, if only he'd known!), but she'd been at his birthday party.
Tony was already to the point of scraping Steve's plate when he said, "Yeah, but he's got a pretty nasty case of 'resting murder face.' I don't think there's anything they can do about that. Kind of a turn-off for man, woman, and beast."
He took a breath, closed his eyes, and stood back up, exhaling the breath as he willed himself to work through the pain, reminding himself that he had to do his part. He had to help. He couldn't let these bastards win. And the hell he would let any of those fuckers come anywhere near his baby.
expensive sports car, staring down at his phone, the light from the street casting long shadows over the sidewalk that made the whole thing look like it was out of some spy story. He stood there, unsure, wondering if he should say 'hello' or continue on his way, and he wondered if Tony was waiting there for someone, though a museum seemed such an odd place to meet someone.
He glanced down at Steve and met his soft, earnest concern. "Tony," he said, his tone even but firm if just a little pleading, "please. Just finish one slice."
"No, see, I still am Tony, I'm just not physically male." He took a breath and let it out and said, "Long story short, Steve knocked me up."
"Hmm? Well, maybe they should give the cosmic pain-in-the-ass a call. She can wiggle her fingers and give them the, well, us treatment."
Steve chuckled again and pushed inside him, and Tony groaned out in equal parts pleasure and relief. There was something almost comforting about having Steve inside of him —
But now that there was no chance of Tony ever going back to the body he'd been born with, and with questions about Steve and Tony and 'Natasha' and the Avengers as a whole growing by the day, there was really no reason for him
because, as Barton likes to insist, I'm spoiled. It's because it sounds better than 'Rogers-Stark.' I'm sorry, babe, but it just does. I know the other way is alphabetical, but it's that 'S' at the end of your name and the beginning of mine. It fucks it up for you. Stark-Rogers just sounds better, and even you agreed with me. You didn't just
Tony just hummed again but said nothing, a coy little twist to his lips, and he reached down and grabbed his bagel and took a bite of it. "Want your coffee?" he asked through a mouthful of food.
Steve just nodded his head toward the doors and said, "Oh, Tony and I going to be late. Nice talking with you," then expertly led Tony away from the reporter and over to the entrance, the various paparazzi shouting demands and questions at them.
"Well, that's…terrifying," Tony said as the reality of what that meant hit him. Multiple unconnected and uncoordinated Hydra factions to contend with. Fuck, they were really going to have their jobs cut out for them going forward. "What did they want?"
"Because I'm going to finish this bad boy in, like, two minutes. It won't have enough time for your enzymes to begin to break it down."
"Eh," he said with a shrug. "A little too close to home for my comfort. I mean, would it be easier to get onto the elevator and go back up to the penthouse right afterward? Sure, but—"
Tony shrugged. "Look, all I'm saying is that your stomach is a bottomless pit, and so far — as my tits can attest to — so is your daughter's."
"And yet," she murmured quietly, "I don't see you going to any federal investigators with this information."
New Yorkers cared about something like this, because he and Steve and Bruce all went over together, and from the safety of his dark-tinted sunglasses, Tony could stare point-blank at anyone he thought was staring at them a little too long.
"Right," Steve said. "You're not going through this alone. Physically, yes. I can't share the burden with you. None of us can. But we're here for you. We're not going to let you fall. We're not going to let you fail. We're going to find our way through this no matter what it takes."
stew, to be perfectly honest, because he wasn't thinking about this. He wasn't thinking about some magical brat that suddenly appeared out of the blue, he wasn't thinking about the best thing that had ever happened to him leaving him high and dry, and he wasn't thinking about—
"—so, in the immortal words of a vice president of the United States to a sitting Senator on the Senate floor, go fuck yourself."
Tony groaned and rolled his eyes. "What are they even doing 'training' at this time of the morning?"
"Nah, that would be my friend, Clint. The wolves that raised him forgot to slap decent manners on him."
"Yeah, mini lights come in after a while — the incandescent ones — and then they got replaced by LEDs. I think you like the incandescents better, but you humor me with the LEDs."
that I know what that tastes like. Too much. All right, I have a helper-bot that puts it in everything
He thought about this a moment then shook his head. "No," he said, "this is— I don't want to outlive my family. I don't want to stay like this forever. I want to grow old with Tony."
But Tony just steeled himself and pushed forward with his plan, reaching over to mouth by the man's ear (and yes, the man was actually a little shorter than he was with his heels on), "I didn't want to say it in front of the others, but my girlfriend and I have been looking for someone to join us for a while now."
Tony just shook his head as he stepped more fully into the kitchen, Olivia nestled into the carrier that had been bought for them by either Wilson or Barnes. According to Natasha, both were laying claim to it because Barnes had been the one to point it out but Wilson had been the one to fork over the cash and neither one was backing down from the assertion that
"We're human beings. I think we should be afforded some amount of privacy even when we go out to a burger joint."
Steve just moved closer and said, "You're pregnant, Tony, and if what Esmeralda said is true, and if what Thor says about her is true, then it's incredibly high-risk, and I'm not having you risk giving yourself a miscarriage out there."
Steve heaved out a heavy sigh, his hand now dropped away from Tony's abdomen. "I don't know, Tony. I don't— If I could take it on me, if I could do it instead of you, I would in a heartbeat."
"OK, we'll talk about it later," he decided at Steve's silence on the matter. "Hey, question. Where'd all this food come from?"
"You'll see," was all he said before he leaned down, pecked another quick kiss against Tony's lips, murmured something that sounded an awful lot like 'I love you,' and then dashed back off to the portal, answering Olivia's queries about what they were doing with, "We're going home, doll-baby."
Because he had the support network for it: he had a husband that would stand by his side no matter what, friends that would do anything for him, and he had the money and the connections to keep this as far on the down-low as possible. Yes, it was a horrifying sort of body horror that should never have existed in the real world, but this was the kind of world they lived in now, and Tony could make the sacrifice so that this wouldn't have to happen to anyone else.
Steve nodded his understanding, and he bit into an egg roll and chewed it a moment then said, "Who got turned into what?"
He set the tablet on the cushion and got to his feet, and he went up the steps and grabbed her one hand and said, "Hold onto the railing, OK?"
"No," Steve said with a shrug. "Just figure it's not enough to feed her, and I'd hate to see it go to waste."
Another 'rip' sounded from the floor, and Steve crouched down and pulled the little girl's hand away from a box that practically towered over her. "Hey, there, sweetheart. You OK?" He set concerned eyes on her and ran a hand over her head to check for any lumps or bruises. "They treating you OK here? This is a terrible thing to…" He thinned his lips and shook his head. No sense in being too drastic about the thing just yet. He needed to formulate an escape plan of some kind, and if that was real snow outside, he really didn't want to run out there in his skivvies.
Tony’s brows knit, his tongue darting out as his lips part in question, and Steve turns on his heel and flees before the situation can get even further out of hand.
“Enough for us,” you say, scrambling now, “for you and me to work out in the long run. We’re too different; you have to see that.”
Where he found half of his team and Wilson sitting around the TV, Wilson and Thor in the middle of a heated game of…whatever…while Bruce and Natasha cheered them on.
"No, I'm kinda comfortable. I mean, unless you're really dying to see Nat giving Stevie's princess a pedicure."
he was, and he at least had a name for the odd, short man with the messy, dark hair. Whatever this place was, it was almost as though someone had brought his deepest, darkest fantasies to life. This was the home of a wealthy man, or at the very least someone that did not worry about where his next meal was coming from. Steve had always wondered what it would like to live like that. There was little need to dress in layers or pile on blankets. He hadn't felt so much as a cool breeze since waking up.
Tony sat back and put a hand over Steve's mouth. "Stop. Don't even go there. Don't even think about it. It's not going to happen. That was a once-in-a-lifetime freak event that will never, ever be repeated. Besides, you got him back now, and he's… He's going to be OK. He might not be exactly the same Bucky that you remember from before the war, but he's going to be OK. It's going to take some time, though, and babe? I know you love him, and I know you want what's best for him, and I know you just want him to go back to being your buddy from the block, but he's… He's changed, and as I understand it, you've changed as well. So,
He did so, and Steve pushed back into his mouth, tip of his prick hitting the back of his throat, and Tony grunted and tried to relax his throat to allow Steve to push in further, and Steve said, "This is the first one," only moments before his rhythm became jerky and irregular, and he came in Tony's mouth.
He then felt Steve's hands on his breasts through the material of the negligée, squeezing and kneading, and he let his head dip a little as he huffed out a silent moan, and Steve pinched his nipples through the gown and said, "You've definitely gotten bigger. They used to fit better in my hands."
? No offense or anything, but I didn't take you guys for…religious…and I'm not really…into that kind of thing."
But he'd been dead and fine with it until they'd gone and disturbed him, rattled his bones and dragged him back to the land of the living. And now—
Tony snorted a laugh and, after finishing his recalibrations, ran an equation to see if it was possible to increase the power of the thrusters without increasing the drain on the reactor.
He shook his head a little and dropped his hand, and he looked over to where DUM-E was hovering by the door, either like he was waiting for Steve to come back or he was waiting for an invitation to actually do some helping of some kind. Tony took pity on what he supposed was technically his 'eldest' and he sighed a little and waved at him and said, "OK, come on. I can probably find something for you to do here."
But Tony sighed as Steve made his way over to the elevator, and he followed him over and said, “Wait for me.”
under false pretenses. That's not the way they present it, of course, but yes, given that Captain America tried to con the draft board in World War II, I could completely believe that he's sitting here now trying to con me into a marriage license."
"That's stupid," Barton said. "You guys aren't finding out for sure, you're stupid to think telling yourselves it's a boy is good enough to get you one. And what's wrong with having a girl? What's the problem? You're both so dead-set against it. Do you see something
He shrugged just a little so that he wouldn't startle the baby, and Tony nodded and said, "Well, next to my voice, yours would have been the one she would have heard most, so, I guess it makes sense."
Steve, weirdly enough, was shoving wrapping paper and ribbons into a garbage bag. Someone must have laid one hell of a guilt trip on him to get him to do
like Captain America's gorgeous mystery date? You know, the sexy one he's been seen around town with several times in the past couple weeks."
" he yelled as his interface shorted a bit before it rebooted and came back online. He lost sight of what happened with Steve and Barnes, but the pressure of the steel against his suit lifted, and he saw Steve straining as he pulled the girder off of him, and once he'd got it lifted high enough, Tony was able to use the jets to blast his way away from the steel and into the open air.
Barnes' face went a little pinched, and Tony had a suspicion he was, rather than taking insult, filing the information away for future reference, especially considering the little nod he gave it.
for the first time in his life. He'd gotten taller, he'd gotten healthier, and hell, maybe he'd even gotten a little smarter. But what he hadn't become, what he so desperately wanted to become, was
"Last night. You were already asleep. They took my shield away from me," he grumbled, and Tony snorted a laugh.
Steve shrugged, but he was having a hard time hiding the cocky smirk on his face. "I mean, you like it, right?" he said without really answering Tony's question.
those scars in this one, and I don't know why. But anyway my parents? I don't know. They died in a car accident. My father liked to hit the bottle once the clock struck nine every morning. Beyond that, I couldn't tell you."
He tried to watch as Barnes went about setting it up for him, crouching down to lock the casters in place, but Bruce was on his other side and was saying something about he had an icepack for him, and Tony frowned and said a very eloquent, "Huh?"
And then they'd won the battle. And then they'd gone out for shawarma. And then he was extending an invite to them to crash at his place whenever they were in town. They next thing he knew, there were half-asleep Avengers at his breakfast table, a super soldier in his bed, and life, a few disturbances aside, was pretty damned good. It was everything he'd never let himself imagine could be his because, well, why would it be? Why would anyone want anything from Tony Stark other than what he could buy for them? If he at any time wondered if the Avengers were at all like all the rest and only after his bank account, that worry was laid to rest once it became apparent that his penthouse had become to them like the main set of a sitcom — the main meeting spot for all the characters where they hung out. If they only wanted him for what he could buy or make for him, they'd keep to their quarters or the other parts of the Tower — like that communal floor that barely got any use — not his own apartment.
"Incidentally," Steve said, swiping down a page on his tablet, "you have another doctor's appointment tomorrow."
After ensuring that the hem was correct for the shoes Tony had chosen to wear, the straps were even, the accent piece wasn't going anywhere, and the gossamer flowed and swayed the right way when Tony took each step, the designer and her assistant gathered up their things and left, and as the designer stepped onto the elevator, she turned back and smiled at Tony and said, "I'm sure Miss Potts will forward my bill to you."
"I mean, it won't be apparent overnight, but it will... There may very well come a time when it will almost seem like you never had the serum in your veins at all."
He talked about the Avengers, about the advances in technology and society and medicine. He talked about the Chitauri and the downfall of SHIELD and that incident down in the Financial District back in the fall. He talked about what it was like to fight alongside an alien that had been taken for being a Norse god. He talked about what it was like to have to talk down a giant, green rage-monster or watch his back around a couple of master spies. He even talked about working through some of his survivor's guilt — though not that he called it by those words — with his buddy Wilson.
Clearly the very idea of what was happening to him, what was in him, disgusted Steve. To be fair, he wasn't all that happy about it himself, but there wasn't much he could do at the moment, and he'd thought Steve, at the least, would be able to understand that there wasn't anything he could do about it. He hadn't asked for this. Hell, even he could admit it creeped him out a bit.
"You had a family, too," Tony said, and the Cap looked up like he couldn't believe had so easily read his mind. He blinked, his face drawn in wonder and…
"Tell you what? She's slept long enough. How 'bout you go grab the munchkin, and I'll grab us something to chow down on?"
Steve glanced down at the baby resting against his shoulder, and he opened his mouth like he was going to protest but then sighed and shook his head and said, "It's time for her nap."
He blinked and acquiesced to her demand, and he saw panic looking back at him. "Tony, the Board. They're asking questions—"
Tony made a face at this. "You know, English really needs some gender-neutral pronouns. I mean, we have 'they' and 'them,' but technically those are plural."
"You." She nodded at the baby in his arms. "And her. Think they were a little disappointed when 'he' turned out to be a 'she.'"
Tony didn't think it was purely coincidence that he got a few jabs in the gut at that. "Yeah, I'm gonna have to agree with my petulant parasitic offspring at that," he said and rubbed his abdomen some. "I can't eat? Bullshit. Do you know how fucking
So, he kissed back, all tongue and teeth and saliva, and put gentle hands to Steve's narrow waist, and he kissed Steve until his lips hurt and his jaw started to ache, and he pulled his mouth away only for Steve to take him by the shoulders and pull him into his arms. He turned a little to allow for the best means of folding into Steve's embrace with his belly sticking out, and as he put his arms around Steve's waist, Steve put his mouth by his ear and murmured, "You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, and if I had to, I'd burn the universe to get you back again."
"Whatever," he said, breezing past Bruce's statement. "This is discrimination! I'm being discriminated against!"
"No," Thor said, his tone grave and serious. "That is a worry for another day." His face and his tone brightened immensely as he continued, "No, my friend, this is something that...I think will be most welcome to you, given our conversation of yesterday."
Steve was still apprehensive, face pinched and arms folded tight against his chest. "She doesn't have any defects or anything, does she?"
"So long as we agree it doesn't change anything," Steve said. "She's our daughter. We're her parents."
"I have to do a physical exam, Tony," he said with a sigh. "I'm going to need to see how dilated you are."
"Don't say that," she said, and Tony glanced up, surprised by the amount of fight in her voice and the sharpness of her green eyes. "Don't talk like that," she continued with a curt shake of her head. "Even if Steve's not…" She closed her mouth and thinned her lips as she seemingly thought over her next words then said, "Boy or girl, Steve would have loved that baby no matter what." And then, she tweaked just the hint of a smile and said, "Might've been like pulling teeth to get him to admit that, though."
She nodded. "Good. Now, may I, or do you have some other asinine question you wish to ask? A trait you appear to have picked up from your bonded, I might add."
"Buck would want to deck me over something stupid. Jim would never do that to you." And then, he gave Tony a pointed look and added, "He'd deck me before he ever even thought about decking you."
"Are you kidding?" he asked as Natasha slipped it up his leg later that day, sitting it over the lace-trimmed top of the white stockings she'd insisted he wear. "I mean, isn't that he height of tacky?"
"Tony—" he started to say, and Tony turned to address the group again and said, "Good lord, you try to attach one eggbeater to a drill, and suddenly he thinks you're out of your mind."
"Oh," he said just before Rhodey called out to him, "Hey, Tones!" He turned, and Rhodey was grinning and holding up his phone. "Somebody wants to say 'hi' to you."
you're not really a woman," she continued, "and he knows you want to go back to the way you were, but there's a part of him that just sees this whole thing on the surface, and maybe it is just an old-fashioned sense that's completely ingrained in him and will never be fully wiped, but he sees you as the person — the
The elevator came to a stop and 'dinged' to announce its arrival, and the doors slid open to reveal a more bustling corridor than they'd left behind. Tony slipped a pair of wire-rimmed, rose-tinted sunglasses over his eyes and schooled his face into something neutral as he followed Pepper and her fucking six-inch heels off the elevator and over to a small dressing area adjacent to the room where the press conference was being held. He recognized Pepper's PA, who came over with a notebook in her hand and gave Pepper a rundown of what had gone on while she'd been upstairs, and Rhodey nudged Tony's arm and nodded over to another corner of the room, further away from the doors that led into what could very well be Tony's doom.
, but I'm still alive? Look, what does it matter?" he asked at Pepper's unhidden worry. "Even if I am dead, the company goes to Steve, and he trusts you not to run it into the ground as much as I do."
"That's not what I meant. We've done a lot of good, and there's a lot of goodwill toward us from the public, but I'm starting to hear rumblings about us being a rogue group that answers to no one but ourselves."
"Tony, please," Steve said, voice just above a whisper. "Don't believe that. You can't believe that."
"Well, no," he said with a chuckle. "Probably get an order of fried rice. Some spare ribs. Couple of spring rolls. An egg roll or two. Maybe a wonton soup."
Tony stopped stirring but didn't look up from the mess of yellow and pink glop. He knew he wasn't Olivia's real father. He
"Whatever," Jim replied and rolled his eyes before he carried the baby over to the couch and sat down on the end opposite Thor. "So, we gonna open presents and be all happy and shit or what?"
"Aye," Thor said, strolling into the conversation, dressed in a pair of board shorts and a garish Hawaiian-styled button-down, Mjolnir in hand. He set the hammer down on the coffee table, long, blonde hair flowing and small, thin braids swinging, and added, "I have explained to you many a time it is the bond that they share. It unites them and draws them to each other in ways those that are not bonded to another cannot understand. It is how the union of their souls manifests itself and draws its energy, reaffirming its bond and casting all others aside."
"Evidently, JARVIS thought it was better to get us the powered stuff, which requires boiling and mixing and shit like that."
Tony motioned with the glass of orange juice in-hand in the direction the vagabonds had retreated once they'd taken their share of coffee and doughnuts.
She was quiet a moment, like she was thinking things over, before she said, "Did you run this by Steve yet? I'm not sure Captain America wants to be seen on a date with someone that isn't Iron Man."
Bruce just shrugged, and Wilson turned to Barton and said, "You know, you never finished your explanation for Thor."
Tony shrugged. "Actually stumbling into an alternate universe? Hasn't so far. Getting a glimpse of an alternate universe, though?" He scratched at his jaw. "Yeah, we might have some experience with that."
"Well?" Steve asked, and Tony opened his eyes to see the precise name — or as close enough to — that his finger had landed on.
Tony turned, greeted with the sight of his returned paramour. "Finally. Where the hell did you park the car? Hoboken?"
Pepper was blinking now, avoiding eye contact, and Tony knew she was trying, oh, she was trying oh-so-hard not to cry, and he shot a look at Bruce to get the little brat out of there, hoping Bruce would get the idea. Bruce just gave him a funny look, frowning, head tilted, and Tony had to nod at the brat then nod at the door, and Bruce seemed to get it after that.
Tony stayed quiet a moment, and when the traffic passed, he motioned for them to cross. Steve led them, slipping only the slightest in the middle of the intersection, and when they got to the other side of the street, Tony only said, "You'd be surprised."
"Yeah," she said and scraped up the rest of her mac and cheese with her spoon. "Papa, c'n I go stay with Anna Tasha and Unca Bucky, too?"
"It's worse if you're having a girl, and the way I remember it, yours was pretty bad," Barton replied. "Also, I'm sure Bruce's told you. What's the fetal heart rate? Is it over 140?"
But maybe for a moment, just a moment, there was a little pang of jealousy that hit him when that little girl had clung so tightly to Tony's legs and called him 'Papa' and had wanted nothing more than for him to scoop her up and comfort her in her time of need. And for a brief, brief moment, and one he was ashamed of, he wondered how it was fair that
He shrugged some, humbled but not entirely embarrassed. "Well, I wasn't there," he explained, and Tony noted a slight tone of bitterness in his voice. "I didn't get to— I wasn't there to help you through it. I didn't get to see my daughter born with my own eyes."
Steve shrugged noncommittally then went back down to staring at the baby, his confusion breaking and being replaced by a soft, warm joy. He tightened the arm he had on the baby and pulled her just a little bit closer, and he tightened the arm he had around Tony and pulled him just a little bit closer, and they sat there in quiet contentment until Olivia's fussiness got to be too much, and Steve frowned and said, "Is she OK?"
Steve stopped just as soon as he'd stepped off the elevator, the Iron Man armor right behind him, and Tony watched as he swallowed and raked his gaze over the sight before him. Tony had hedged his bets that the look would appeal to Steve, but he hadn't honestly been one hundred percent sure until this very moment.
Steve just put his hands on his shoulders and made like he was going to knead them, but Tony smacked them away and said, "No, no, that's taped, too."
Tony just squeezed his hand again, and that was when a door opened and a nurse stepped out and said, "Natasha Carbonell?"
"Please don't wear actual bells," he heard Steve mutter after he'd turned to go and make himself look presentable. He stopped a moment and gave consideration to looking for the elf's hat with the jingle bells on it that Barton had been wearing at last year's Christmas party. Steve didn't want him wearing bells? He'd wear the most obnoxious and jingly hat anyone had ever seen.
Tony startled as the barista held his tea out to him, and he tweaked a smile at her, took the beverage, and then carried it over to the table. He stood there for only a moment before he said, "I don't usually come to this part of the city for a number of reasons, but I've been to worse, so I guess I really can't complain."
Steve, that he’d have to leave some of it on. Steve understands why he might’ve wanted to keep the helmet—too easy to identify a face through contours alone, even without the benefit of sight, and there was the question, too, of Iron Man’s voice. But Iron Man took the helmet off in the end, if only for a little while, and that—Steve licks his lips, remembering—that was a hell of a thing.
Steve cracks open one eye, then the other, staring down at his sweat-slicked torso, at the place where his hand vanishes beneath (
It’s certainly nothing Steve hasn’t resorted to before, although things had felt a little different in times of war. He hadn’t thought Iron Man would be the sort, that’s all, to have ‘discreet’ and ‘reputable agencies’ on hand. A strange way of talking about it, too. Briskly pragmatic. Impersonal.
“What you told me, about your… condition never causing problems in the field before. Was that true? Because—” He breaks off for a moment, before resuming. “Because I’m going to be honest with you here, if you were lying about being fit for combat that’s… that’s a big deal, but if this is a new development… No one understands how the serum really works, and if the effects are changing after all this time, we need to have that looked at. We can find someone discreet. Hank Pym’s brilliant at that sort of thing, and I think he’s a friend of J— of Wasp’s. We could—”
“I should call you in,” Tony says. “Christ, I should— I’m the international face of justice and you’re a goddamn criminal.”
You open your mouth but you seem to be operating on a lag—it’s several seconds before any sound comes out. “That was— We shouldn’t have—
“Here’s my problem,” Tony says. His fingers drum consideringly against his thigh. “I know you come to me for Extremis, even if you tell yourself you don’t. You come here so you can feel whole again. You’d pay almost any price for that, I think.”
Karim is leaning against the counter of his hotel bathroom, eyes intent on his own reflection as he glides a razor over the contours of his chin. You wonder if he knows about the cameras. It’s not just the Brits that have him under surveillance—you could construct a 3D model of this most domestic of scenes from all the angles in all the quadruple-encrypted feeds you’re tapping.
“You’ve cut yourself shaving,” Tony says, softly, eyebrows still knit. “I wouldn’t have thought that was possible, not with your reflexes. Here, and—”
There was no “and then.” He had Gail waiting for him. Gail whom he loved, Gail whom he would’ve been faithful to, and anyway he wouldn’t— He wasn’t—
He shifts a little on the mattress. There’s a profoundly unerotic squelch—he can’t help but be glad that Iron Man’s already left the room—and he feels something sticky sliding down the cleft of his ass. Iron Man is probably right about the sheets being ruined. The thought clenches briefly somewhere inside of him, a reflex born of growing up through the Depression years, when you had to scrimp and save and stretch everything you owned and still never had enough. But there are other sheets. Tony’s the one providing them, after all, and he’s sure Tony’s never lost a minute’s sleep over a ruined sheet in his life. He doesn’t think Tony would mind anyway. Tony wants to give him things, he likes it, he
“Aw, hell,” he hears Iron Man say from behind him. “Cap. Cap, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that. I didn’t mean to make fun, I’m just… processing.” He lets out a staticky laugh. “I mean, I’m a guy walking around in a custom-fitted tin can. One of my coworkers is an actual god, and I used to hang around with a modern-day Jekyll-and-Hyde. Only, you know. Greener. Who am I to judge?”
Steve swallows fruitlessly as drool masses in his mouth. Tries not to let the shame show on his ruin of a face as he waits for whatever fresh indignity Tony has in store.
“You couldn’t have paid Ross a visit, if you were that desperate for a jail cell?” A laugh crawls its way out of his chest. “No, you just had to come here, didn’t you?”
There’s a dull ringing growing louder in his head; his jaw aches where he bit down instinctively against the gag.
Steve shuts his mouth. The words echo in his mind, the sound twisting, shedding its computer-modified artificiality, taking on a familiar accent—cultured, but just a little bit rough at the edges, like singed velvet.
You collapse yourself back into your body just as Maya squeezes down once more, but you must’ve fucked it up somewhere—come back too fast, or somehow wrong, because the sensation seems wan and distant to you, like something glimpsed at the far end of a long tunnel. You are in your body, but you can’t seem to remember how to inhabit it. Sensory data skims across your awareness like clouds reflected over the surface of a lake, transient, impossible to grab hold of, while at the same time at the forefront of your consciousness, the stolen image of the woman in Alberta stutters like a bad disk sector, glitching in eternal, prayerful truncation: “I lo— I lo— I  lo—”
Tony’s mug is still steaming on the counter. Steve can see—the advantages of super-soldier vision—the faint wet gleam where Tony’s lips met the porcelain just minutes before. It would be so easy to fit his own over the mark, a secondhand kiss.
“Speechless, huh? I can work with that.” Iron Man drags a thumb along the nape of Steve’s neck and Steve shivers and arches into the touch. “Good speechless or bad speechless?”
And that was Tony’s fault too, now Steve came to think of it. All those ridiculous fairy tales about… what was it?
From behind you, you hear, very low: “I think maybe you don’t know my principles as well as you think.”
Steve looks down at the mess in his hand. Slowly, he raises his hand to his mouth, and imagines it’s the evidence of Tony’s pleasure he’s licking away, Tony’s come marking him like that, inside and out,
Steve Rogers is a rock, but the future is a tide, and a rock can cut through the tide but it can’t stop it. Not ever.
Iron Man gives a little gasp. “That’s cheating,” he says. “Using the Captain America voice like that.”
Maya’s eyebrows lift. You’re staring. With a muttered apology, you step aside. You try to summon up a smile, some small sliver of your much-vaunted charm. She just nods in return, like you’re distant colleagues passing in the hallway at some conference. And then you’re stepping back and the door is swinging shut in your face and you’re alone in the sullen silence of the aftermath.
you begin, and god, what a blunder, his name in your mouth. It bursts on your tongue like overripe fruit; you have to close your eyes just to process the half-rotten sweetness of it, the way it clings like syrup to the walls of your mouth.
The image flashed across his mind of the look on Tony’s face as he said it, his shoulders drawn tight as if bracing for a blow…
Rogers stands slowly, keeping his movements open and easy like Tony’s some sort of twitchy woodland creature he’s trying not to startle. Even now there’s a kind of coiled grace to him. No one else in the world moves like Steve Rogers. Tony forgot that. Or maybe he just hasn’t wanted to remember.
“I’m going to put the armor back on,” Iron Man says, “so just knock on the door before you come out, okay?”
He comes twice more in the space of an hour, both times, despite his best efforts to distract himself, with visions of Tony on his mind.
You shrug, helpless—as if you’re going to stop him?—and he sinks into the easy chair to the left of the night table. You’ve seen him there so often, after a battle or just a particularly difficult day, flipping through stacks of Avengers reports or, less frequently, a newspaper or one of those pulpy fantasy novels he likes so much.
done that before, not in all the time I’ve known you. We all have off days, but you don’t have to be a genius to spot the pattern here. Something’s up.”
“It was… before, when I first smelled it, I was thinking… and then you came out in that— Looking like—” Steve swallowed. “And I…”
And yeah, maybe that hadn’t worked out so well for him with the chaise longue, but this was a different piece of furniture, and anyway, it wasn’t really a question of strength so much as will. Steve had that in spades. All he needed to do was put it to work.
On Capitol Hill, the junior senator from Montana sends a backchannel proposal through a private e-mail server: increased farming subsidies for her state in return for a yes vote on a certain controversial bill. If the bill makes it through the House, of course. From the tone of the e-mail, the junior senator from Montana doesn’t find it likely, but then, what does Montana care about superhumans?
“What do you need?” Iron Man rasps. He’s moving, but still too careful, too shallow and maddeningly slow. Steve tries to take him deeper but he can’t quite get the leverage. He lets out a growl of frustration.
. The way the pull and burn of muscles during exercise feels right. The sort of rightness that comes upon him in the midst of battle, a clarity and purpose that guide him through each duck and leap and swing and blow, the sense that this is where he’s meant to be, this is what he’s
“I wonder,” Iron Man continues, as if he has no idea of the effect he’s having, “what he’d think if he saw this—saw you like this.” Something dark is curling around the edges of his voice. “Saw all the things I’m doing to you with his invention.”
Steve nods and tilts back his head, opening his eyes to stare up at the ceiling. He takes a steadying breath.
shouldn’t—” You swallow, turning away from Maya’s bright, attentive stare. She deserves to hear this. You deserve to have to say it. “I’m with someone. I fucked up. I’m sorry.”
Maybe it was that very night, when Steve’s body lay spent and sated and tangled with yours. You pulled him tight to you, feeling the arc of his smile where it curved against your chest, and let yourself imagine that to have was to hold, that everything you ever wanted could ever be yours to keep.
He doesn’t wait for a response, just flashes another perfunctory smile and shuts the door in Iron Man’s face.
He’s really not feeling too hot on secrets at the moment, even the ones that don’t belong to a bunch of terrorist shitheads.
Steve lies on his back, feeling the ache deep inside him, the faint strain of exertion in the muscles of his stomach and thighs. They’ll fade soon—the serum makes sure of that—but he wants to savor them while he can.
and the awareness of it… It isn’t right—isn’t fair: you’re just data now. Ones and zeros shouldn’t be able to feel like this, sandpapered raw with possibility.
Maya gives you a little shove and you fall backwards onto the mattress. Give yourself over to gravity. You could lose yourself in this, you think.
“I feel—” he says, but he can’t think how to put it into words, the way his body feels like a match about to ignite, like any moment the scrape of their bodies together could send the pair of them up in smoke.
He palms himself through the fabric of his trousers. It hurts, the way the zipper and rough cloth press and drag against his over-sensitized skin, and yet somehow it’s still not anywhere near enough. An involuntary moan escapes him. It’s all he can do to keep his lips from forming Tony’s name.
Steve’s abs tighten as he hauls himself into a half-seated position, hands still tugging fruitlessly at his cock.
“Oh, I didn’t mind,” Steve assures him, stifling the yawn currently threatening to balloon its way out of his throat. “I liked it, actually. It was good. You really sounded like him that time.”
So there you are, two of the greatest minds of your generation, picking away at each other, small jabs and petty cruelties and somehow all the while drawing closer and closer…
“All we could ever do was postpone the inevitable.” The suitcase lies open on the bed like an empty mouth, wordless and gaping. “There’s nothing left here to save. I’m sorry.”
, he wants to say, but he can’t seem to get his throat to work. Anyway, it’s not true. Not really. It
Steve’s mouth is open. As you watch, heart beating in triple time, he reels it shut. A crease appears between his brows, and whatever you thought this moment would be like, this is worse, because he’s not stupid, he’s never been stupid, but it’s like he’s translating from a language half-remembered and mostly forgotten, and you know, then, that until this moment it never once occurred to him that you might do this. That’s how much he trusted you. That’s what you’re pissing down the drain.
You think you loved him all the more fiercely after that, a vigorous, implacable ache of a love, constant and relentless in its motions as the hands of a clock. A feeling sowed with the salt-bitter promise of its own ending, the way you’d love anything singular and lovely and cherished and impossible to keep.
There’s an awkwardness to the question, tension still clinging round the edges of his voice. Steve finds he wants to
Steve twitched his shoulders, trying to shake free the slow, crawling heat that had somehow insinuated itself just beneath his skin.
He picks up a shard in a pair of forceps, holding it up to the light. Is that pitting functional, or a result of the explosion? Or both?
“—so good,” Iron Man promises. “Just—on the count of three, okay? I want you to pinch both your nipples as hard as you can, okay?”
Maya is sweating now. A droplet lands on your chest, another on the dip of your chin. You haven’t broken a sweat in weeks. You’re not entirely sure you’re still capable of it. She lets out a groan and you feel the tightness that precipitates an ending.
His hips are moving of their own accord, bucking upward, driving him further and further into Iron Man’s mouth, and that’s—that’s wrong he knows, he shouldn’t— He tries to still himself, but two hands slide beneath his ass, lifting it upwards, an invitation.
Steve knows he should object, but his head is filled with noise and he can’t seem to figure out how or why.
like Iron Man is laughing at him. Iron Man’s laughter is a little manic, sure, but also bright and warm in some indefinable way. If Steve didn’t know better, he’d say it sounded…
It takes a few moments for Steve to get his breathing back under control. “I know,” he says, finally. “I know you won’t. I’m sorry. I do trust you, Shellhead. You’re the only one I ever— It’s just… hard.”
for the first time since that night and somehow it’s all there, all of it, the beauty and the horror and the grief and the anger and the longing and the fear, because he doesn’t know how or when it happened but somehow that’s what Rogers is to him now, always,
He throws up a hand, palm out—lets the repulsor charge, radiating heat and light and power just barely restrained.
It's well past midnight on the third day. Steve has taken to seeking food at irregular hours to avoid potential embarrassment. He forgot that Tony also tends to keep odd hours when in the midst of a project. Then again, he’s been doing his best to think of Tony as little as possible, and when he does, inevitably, think of him, it’s not Tony’s sleeping habits he’s thinking of.
—and smacks his lips. The sound, in context, is so obscene that it makes Steve laugh and shudder and blush all at once.
It’s not agreement, not close to it, but it’s clearly the best Tony’s going to get. He can figure the rest out later. And that’s a dangerous way of thinking, he knows, but…
but there are so many people, so much input lagging your processor, and somewhere in the distance a rifle cracks—
“And you,” Tony continues, “you’re the worst of all. You want me to heal you, you want me back on the team, you want me to be like I was before, you want me to
Rogers said that, months ago, before they crossed the line of no return—or at least before they realized they had. Now the weight of Tony’s hypocrisy lies heavy on the air.
Maybe it was in a cave in Afghanistan, when a man you barely knew saved your life and taught you that the engine of the future is fueled by sacrifice, and that change—real change—always comes hand in hand with destruction.
“Is this really the time to be debating epidemiology?” Iron Man mutters into the crook of Steve’s knee.
Iron Man’s hands are running back and forth over Steve’s shoulders and upper arms, a comfort and a torment.
He rubs a hand over his face, dragging it around behind to clutch the back of his neck. “I see,” he says, voice as neutral as he can make it. Really—glancing down to where his dick hangs limply between his thighs—it’s probably for the best.
It’s four years ago and you have a mission. You’re barely a year sober and still clawing together the pieces of your life, everything that has been taken from you and everything you took from yourself. Now someone has robbed you again. This cannot be allowed to stand.
“Take this,” Steve says, in a tone that brooks no argument, and hands him the damp washcloth, “and give me the spare.”
“I told you it was… worse. Than it’s ever been. But it’s also… It’s not usually picky. About who I find— I find a lot of people, uh. Appealing. Attractive. But this time it’s… It’s only one. And every time something reminds me…”
Because he can see what’s before him, plain as anything—one large hand wrapped in a steadying grasp around his arm, fingers creasing the costly linen of Tony’s shirt, the whole tableau framed against a darkening sky, the city beyond the window falling into dusk.
you think, something turning over in your chest. For a moment you think it’s your heart, but your heart is as supranaturally hale as the rest of you and,
Tony’s lips pull back in a snarl, an awful, animal distortion. “Do you realize,” he asks, “what you’ve done? I might— I’m going to have to take you in!”
next time: "oh, well, now that Steve's onto Iron Man it's only a matter of time before he puts two and two together probably I should imagine; revelations shall abound, tears and laughter and full-frontal snogging and... wait. Chapters: 12/20? what do you mEaN we're barely halfway through the story??? silks? SIILLLKSS????" (<--you the reader)
“Loki,” Tony says, watching the scotch arc amber through the air, “only tried to take over the world.”
He's not exactly surprised by what he sees, but the sight sets something cold leaking out of him nevertheless, like air from a punctured tire. The far side of the bed has been remade, covers and sheets tugged haphazardly into place. There’s a folded piece of paper sitting on one pillow, but apart from that, the bed is empty.
“Nicolette and Anastasia,” Tony says, as if reading Steve’s mind. “Anastasia’s a model and Nicolette… something in astrophysics, I think. It wasn’t really her degrees I was paying attention to.” Tony leers down at Steve. “Such lovely girls, and so kind of you to get me ready for them. After all, I do have a reputation to uphold.”
He hopes to god it’s true, that if it comes down to it he’ll make the right choice. Put sentiment aside. Do what needs to be done.
“They weren’t rattling around inside a pressurized tin can,” Iron Man says. “Yes, that does change things a bit, doesn’t it. Well. Do you
It’s a relief, undeniably, to hear his friend speak again, but Steve can’t help but feel a little pang of regret. The very sound of Iron Man’s voice, so familiar in all of its mechanized inhumanity, suddenly seems emblematic of the distance between them, and Steve knows it’s wrong—knows that the Avengers are pledged to respect each other’s needs for privacy, but he can’t help but think… Iron Man already knows the worst of
“I’m doing good,” Steve tells him. “Really, really good. Better than I’ve felt in… well. A while, anyway.” He clears his throat. “I… just wanted to say I really appreciate—”
Tony ignores the nauseous pang the ‘we’ sends through him. Not a bomb then. Just something someone wanted to keep hidden.
“You’re so good, Steve, Christ, better than anything he’s ever had. Better than anything he’s ever dreamed, you—”
“I just can’t believe,” he’s saying, “I mean… I’ve seen a thing or two, but Arthur? The actual King Arthur? That’s something else, you know?”
. The kind that hang on the wall of meeting rooms, say, marking out time in steady intervals, offering order and comfort when the seconds seem to stretch into minutes and the minutes into hours with scarcely an end in sight.
Steve feels a little tug on the cloth at the back of his head, and then Iron Man’s hands are falling away.
“Save the flattery,” Tony snaps. He chances a quick glance down at his hands—still rock steady—then forces himself to look back at Rogers. “If someone’s spotted you, they’ll have people waiting at the border. At
You don’t kiss much after the beginning, which is probably for the best. Your mouth is dry, sour and mucus-thick. Her mouth tastes like fire and woodsmoke. Tennessee’s finest. The taste of defeat.
Steve makes a non-committal sound. “It’ll be good to, uh. Get back to it,” he says vaguely. “But actually”—a warm flush is creeping through his body, up into his cheeks, across his shoulders, down through his chest, down and further down—“there’s something else I had in mind first.” He scratches his nails lightly across his abs, barely an inch above where the head of his cock rests against his skin, and feels it twitch and swell against his stomach.
“Nah,” Steve says. “I’m committed now.” He rubs Iron Man’s leg reassuringly with his thumb and tilts his head back so Iron Man can see his smile. “Same goes for you, you know. No harm, no foul.”
You pull back abruptly, reeling back long strands of self from where they’ve entangled themselves in the hospital’s computer systems. Faintly, you hear footsteps retreating in the distance, so you shut down your senses as well, lock yourself deep within the impregnable fortress of your body.
Luckily, he’s living in the future now, and the internet, he has been reliably informed, is for porn.
“’Twould be my privilege,” Thor intones, and launches into the air, only for half a dozen of the clones to fasten onto his cape and drag him inexorably earthwards. “Foul varlets! Unhand me, or you shall taste the wrath of the son of Odin!”
Genially, Sal unspools the accomplishments of your life and shows them to be small. You were supposed to be road testing the future, he says. Why aren’t you running the table, he says. You can barely look at yourself in the mirror, can you, Tony? he says. He tells you there’s a dam across your life.
The urges are fickle in their object, that’s the main point. Infinitely distractible. They don’t… fixate. They’ve
You called him a hypocrite and he let the door slam as he left, abandoned you for the badly-upholstered consolations of Sam’s living room couch.
Steve can’t help himself. He starts to laugh. It feels like the first time he’s laughed in a very long time.
So now you’re in close combat with a machine you designed to take down the Hulk, which isn’t great, and what’s worse, it’s anticipating your every move. Because your subconscious is operating it, of course, and that’s when you know how to take it down—how you could’ve taken all of them down, if only you’d thought of it, if only you’d dared to follow through.
“Yes,” he says, “because when I think of ‘Capsicle’ I think ‘there’s a guy who’s great at flying under the radar.’”
“You’ve been running scared for months,” Steve says, as if you haven’t spoken. “Maybe even longer. I’m sorry it took me so long to see, but I see it now. What’s got you so afraid, Tony?”
Now he cradles his forehead in one big hand, and sighs. “I guess,” he says, and then he doesn’t say anything for a little while. “I guess I was mostly hoping you could answer a question for me.” A bit of old New Yawk has crept into his voice, the way it does in his most unguarded moments. “’Cause I’ve been turning it over and over in my head and I can’t— God knows things have been rough lately and a lot of that’s on me, but what I can’t figure out is
Which is right about when the physical manifestation of your own hubris slams into you like the fist of god and knocks you clean out of the sky.
Doesn’t dare to is more like it. Sleep brings dreams, and dreams mean even less control over his own mind than Steve has while awake.
“Steve? Everything all right?” His voice is sharp—urgent. “I can be there in ten—no, make that seven—”
No, far more likely that Iron Man kept it on for Steve’s benefit—that there’s something there he wanted to hide. Some kind of scarring, maybe. Something distinctive. Identifying. He finds, strangely, that he likes the thought. Not, of course, that he wants his friend to be scarred—of course he doesn’t—but just. The idea of it. Iron Man’s life printed on his skin in a way Steve’s can never be, not since the serum. The idea of Iron Man being—being
“It was something else,” Giant Man says, shaking his head. “I’ve never seen Iron Man fight like that before.”
Except then he came back, and he saved you, like he’ll keep coming back, like he’ll keep trying to save you, because that’s the kind of man he is. And maybe you’re three parts drunk, but you’re not too sozzled not to know what kind of man
“I know part of you likes this. At least this way, you’re useful. It’s been a long time since you were last useful, hasn’t it?”
“Hi,” Iron Man says, and Steve manages another smile, slightly less forced than the first. “So, normally I like a bit more foreplay, but I’m getting the sense that things are more… immediate this time?”
Spots dance across his vision. He blinks them away. His mouth is dry; his chest heaves with every breath. The storm in his mind rips his defenses away like they’re made of paper. He knows the name of that storm now, recognizes its lash, the bitterness of ice in its sting. It’s not anger after all, although he can see how he made the mistake.
Natasha, Wilson, and Barnes all found seats at the island, and Tony sighed when he realized that Barton looked like he was cooking up enough to feed an army.
"Tony, come on!" He turned back to his tablet. "They have all sorts of suggestions for things you can do—"
He shrugged then said, "It's human, right?" At Bruce's questioning look, he added, "May have sat through a couple viewings of
"I'm not saying this because she's a big donor — she's not — she's just a little old lady that wants to say 'hello' again to her idol. She has a picture and everything."
"You said that little squirt claims that we're married." He began to fiddle with some of the implements laying on the table. "Not you and me, clearly, but me and…whoever this 'Daddy' person is. And that's great and all, whatever. But I just…I'm not the marrying type."
Tony shot a bemused look at him, and Bruce just shrugged but didn't take back what he'd said. "Whatever," he said and turned to leave.
"Look," Barnes added with a shake of his head, "I'm not sure I'm ready for that sort of thing — I don't even know if I want to do that sort of thing! Maybe I want to, I don't know, run a coffee shop or something?"
Their eyes did a dance together, brown locking in with blue, and Steve flexed his fingers a little possessively over Tony's abdomen before he choked out a sort of laugh and broke the gaze to look down at where his hand lay.
He bit into the bagel and chewed, cream cheese gathering at the corners of his mouth, and Natasha went into the kitchen for a moment before she reappeared with a napkin and held it out to him.
, and that was frightening because what could be so bad — so permanently scarring — that even the serum couldn't touch it? So, he'd hidden it. Forced himself to tamp it down and never let it see the light of day. Hell, he'd even convinced Bucky that he was all better now, much to Bucky's relief.
No, no, he wasn't going to think about that. He wasn't going to think about that horrible violation of his body.
Plus, he felt he owed it to Tony to repay everything he'd done. Steve wasn't sure he'd ever be able to wipe out that debt.
"He saw it," Bucky said. "He's playing dumb. He's a shit liar. He'd be asking more questions if he really didn't know what you were talking about."
Bruce began a long-winded spiel on the life and career of one James Marshall Hendrix, and Tony tuned out and instead let his mind and his gaze wander. Most of the photographs in the vicinity were of dead or now-aged rock stars, which was interesting in theory, he supposed, but he had an internet connection. He knew how to use Google. He could look this shit up in no time and buy a fucking reproduction if he wanted it so badly.
He started to lead Barnes back toward the cabin, arm around his best pal's shoulders, talking to him like the last seventy years had never happened.
, 'Roger'!" at him then turned on his heel and stormed out of the room in a huff. He huffed a little at the nurse that was standing outside the door waiting for them, but he followed her down the hall, Steve, that bastard, right behind him.
was as much a part of some of the stupider pranks they'd pulled as Tony was), but no one was there to really embarrass Steve, so Bruce went online and found a biography published in the '60s of the great war hero Captain America. It included quotes from the Commandos and Peggy Carter and even fucking Howard, but that's not what Bruce focused on. No, Bruce read aloud passages that sounded like they were straight out of a tacky bodice-ripper, the ones that went on about Steve's 'rippling muscles' and 'azure eyes' and the 'firm grip' and 'masterful control' he had over the shield, which was like an extension of his 'exquisite physique.' Steve sank down into his chair, hand covering his face as he practically went beet-red and begged Bruce to stop reading, but the gales of laughter from the group was enough to keep him going until Barton said, "Wait, wasn't this considered the definitive Captain America biography until it turned out the old codger was still alive?"
"Oh, that," Steve said and rolled his eyes, and Olivia bounced a little in his arms of her own volition. He steadied her and added, "You mean that con perpetuated by the department stores."
He chewed the bite, and Natasha said, "I figured that," a tiny smirk tugging at her mouth. "What sort of clothes?"
Tony and Hill brought up the rear, and Natasha picked through the selection to find what she'd determined was Tony's size, and when she'd found it, without a word, she pulled it from the rack and held it up for approval. Hill nodded and said, "Looks even better in person."
Steve lifts his head. There’s an empty, aching desolation in his eyes, so much worse than tears. “When did you stop loving me?” he asks.
He shifts down the bed, toeing at the sheets, tugging them down his torso and hips until he’s just barely on the right side of decency, his erection still covered but tenting the fabric enough to expose his flesh to the cool morning air. His balls tighten at the shift in temperature, goosebumps pricking at the tops of his thighs.
So you will search. And search. And find nothing. Freeze frame: you and Maya, glaring into one another’s faces with barely the space of a breath to separate you. Press play, and somehow, suddenly, you’re kissing. Let the footage roll on and it’s not too much longer before you find yourself here. (On your back. In a bed. Not yours.)
“Indeed,” Thor says solemnly, and with what Steve, is his current state, finds to be almost maddening hypocrisy. “I am certain we all have things we must attend to. Fare thee well, comrades.”
Steve, god,” Iron Man groans as Steve grinds his hips onto Iron Man’s pelvis, feels Iron Man’s balls plump against his ass. “Just like—”
Steve runs a hand across his left pec, as much to shut Iron Man up as anything, but his fingers catch on the puckered nub of his nipple, and he and Iron Man groan in concert.
When the rest of the dishes are dried and put away, the glass disposed of and an apologetic note left on the refrigerator, Steve goes back to his room. He’s aware he’s dragging his feet, thinking longingly of the gym the whole time, but he knows this mood well enough to know that it could turn at any moment and he doesn’t want to be in a public area when it happens.
The hand on his cock withdraws. There’s a liquid sound, and then Iron Man is parting Steve’s cheeks, baring him, and Steve wonders if it’s possible to die of anticipation.
“You don’t get to decide that,” he says now, steel in his voice, and then, as silence begins to stretch between you again, “I don’t think it’s an unreasonable question.”
, sharp and raw and scraping. How can he be so tight and feel so empty? He pushes further in and is rewarded with more pain. He’s barely halfway to his knuckle and already it hurts so much. He thinks you’re supposed to use something, some kind of lubricant to make it easier but he doesn’t have anything like that and he needs this
He snapped it up and read the read-out, and he choked on a breath when he saw that it was a call being placed by none other than Captain America himself. Ordinarily, his first thought would be to muse aloud to Rhodey, "
"Hey, for all you know he's a real jerk in real life. Maybe he's a sexist prick? He's from the forties."
But she just nodded resolutely and then leaned forward onto the tabletop again. "Yeah. He's a sup'rhero. He's being a sup'rhero with Anna Tasha and Unca Sam and Wanda."
Tony put the glass to his lips and tipped it back, letting the liquid flow back into his mouth. He closed his eyes before he felt it hit his tongue, and the moment it did, he braced for disgust but was surprised to find instead that it…honestly wasn't that bad. Nothing he'd make a habit of drinking, but not the complete abomination he'd been expecting.
He put gentle hands on Steve's pecs and reached up on his toes to press a light kiss against his jaw. Steve huffed out a breath, and Tony took that opportunity to press a little closer, rubbing his hip ever-so-gently against Steve's rapidly growing interest and reaching to the other side of Steve's jaw to press a matching kiss.
"Oh, just finishing up some work that I didn't get to finish before," he said and rubbed her back a little. "Why don't you go back to bed?"
