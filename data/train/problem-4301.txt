“Okay,” says Sam. “Step one, you actually talk to Cas about how you’re feeling. All of this. Maybe he feels the same way. If you’re not talking about it, you don’t know.”
Finally they get out of the car and step into the house, into the mostly empty living room.
Again: Mostly it’s good. Really good. Dean is just starting to feel, yet again, like maybe he’s not cut out for this. That something bad is on its way, that Cas will get taken away again, everything will get taken away again. Dean doesn’t get to be happy. He never has. So why start now? The world has always been a collection of sharp objects waiting to impale Dean Winchester. It’s only a matter of time until something gets him.
Dean’s drunk too, pretty drunk, but not quite as drunk as Cas. They lean on each other the whole walk home, Dean’s arm around Cas’s shoulders, Cas’s arm around his waist. By the time they make it back to the room, they’re laughing so much that it takes Dean a good while to get his keys out of his pocket, then a good while longer to get the door unlocked. This only makes things funnier. Neither of them moves their arm from around the other.
Castiel thinks for a second, then reaches into the pocket of his trench coat.
“Okay.” Dean isn’t quite sure how to proceed. Is Cas hiding something from him? Did something happen? It’s not like he really knows how to do this whole
He claps Castiel once on the shoulder. Castiel stands and leaves. As he steps out the door, he looks back over his shoulder at Dean, who isn't paying him any mind.
He just grunts.
“Honda Pilot,” he says. “You’ve gone soft, Sammy.”
“No, you’ve… You’ve responded favorably.” Cas gives him a reserved smile. “It’s just that since we’ve returned to Lawrence, I’ve taken on a more dominant sexual role—”
“With the fingers,” Dean says, mimicking Cas on his own glass. “All tippy-tappy. You got nervous hands. It’s cute.”
INT. KARA'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Sam regards him cautiously for a second. “What else is bothering you? I can tell this is the top layer of, like, seven layers of Dean Stuff.”
?” he grumbles. “Fuckin’—seriously?”
They go back to the table, trade old stories. When Cas gets up to take dinner out of the oven, Sam’s eyes follow him.
(tentatively)
“Paint samples,” Dean says blankly. He stands and walks over, mostly operated by a confounded curiosity. Sure enough, it’s just a metric ton of paint samples: mostly varying shades of beige and dark blue, with a few random bright colors (coral?) tossed in for good measure.
“Who’s here?”
“We’ll do the hand kiss then,” Cas says graciously. “Dean, how do you kiss with hands.”
When Sam arrives at the hospital he’s inconsolable. Cas stays a few minutes to make sure it won’t overwhelm Dean, then leaves the room without drawing much attention to himself.
“Sorry I’m late,” Dean says when he shows up two minutes past his usual arrival time, still slightly tense and distracted. “Cas is sick.”
“He went on a victory lap,” Dean says, incredulous.
“Oh,” says Dean.
I don't think Castiel is homophobic, Dean.
“Especially Gregory.”
“I imagine he does.” Everything he says is worse than the last thing. He thinks,
Sam stares.
“Not angels? What does that mean?”
Sam grabs him by the shoulders, looks him squarely in the face.
“Casti-
(then)
Dean blinks at him for a second, processing—he doesn’t think he’s ever heard Cas say that many words in a row under non-emergency circumstances—but then his supportive partner instinct kicks into gear and he pulls him back in for another kiss.
.” He spits out the last word like a curse.
, he thinks.
“You know I feel weird about holding hands and stuff in public.”
I mean, you pressed me pretty hard for a good answer. And you don't seem very ashamed.
“No, I know,” says Cas. “I just—a birthday present.”
The answer, of course, is that Dean doesn’t even talk about this stuff with Cas. He avoids it as much as possible. He doesn’t want to make Cas feel guilty—although he’s not totally sure what Cas would feel guilty for.
“I’ve recently made some changes,” says Cas, smiling his small smile again. It looks like an attempt at something. An apology, maybe.
That doesn't count. It has to be a secret.
When Cas’s legally recognized birthday rolls around, they both get a present: Cas gets a truck and Dean gets a job. Dean has just picked the truck up from a guy on Craigslist—a fairly normal interaction, all things considered, though he convinced Sam to come as backup on his lunch break—and is pulling it into the driveway when he gets a call.
anything. He just has to sit and play house while the life he knew his whole life circles the drain. Well, he doesn’t
I don't know. Kiss you. Have you. Any of this. You're an angel. Maybe you don't actually feel how you think you feel, you know? And I still get so mad at you sometimes - I get so angry, I don't know why, and I get mad at myself too, I know I've hurt you so many times, I've let you down, I've let everybody down, I can hardly look at myself in the mirror sometimes without seeing all the times I've hurt you, and sometimes I'm not even sure you're really here, and -
About thirty minutes later, Dean is polishing off a bag of chips in a Gas-N-Sip parking lot down the street—things really do come full circle—when Cas texts him:
,” he sings. “They never think that’s funny. You wouldn’t either because you don’t know any songs. Man, I wish I’d made you listen to more music. You could have brought good taste up to the heavenly coast.”
“Then keep going,” he says, voice dark.
“Good question,” says Cas, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. This is why the lip balm is useless. “Hard to say. Many major players are reasonably upset about the installment of the biological son of Lucifer—"
sound and everything.
“They’re all his,” Eileen says when Sam raises his eyebrows at them. “He looked adorable in everything, I couldn’t say no.”
“Last time we talked you said he was a great fit,” Dean says, careful. If he’s not thriving up there—well, Dean really, really doesn’t want to have to do the God-coup thing again. Especially not to Jack.
For a moment, Dean stares at Sam and Sam stares back.
“It’s yours,” he says, wrapping an arm around Cas’s waist. “Happy birthday, Cas.”
“Pity,” says the guy. “All these geezers have been here for years. We could use a couple new faces.”
And this compulsion to be honest...
“Cas?” he says.
Tom just nods, eyebrows raised again, pursuing his lips slightly.
STILL CLOSE ON THE PENNY. But now Castiel is standing at the bathroom sink. He looks up into the mirror. Places the penny on the sink.
“Dean?” Cas whispers, and Dean realizes he’s being staring into space.
There’s a long, quiet moment. Sam is right, of course.
“Interesting,” says Cas. “I haven’t been to one of these.”
but he knows the answer to that question, and he doesn’t want to give Cas the opportunity to turn it back on him. Instead, he leans in a little closer, pets the back of Cas’s head.
Cas nodded.
“I’m right here,” says Dean. He leans down to kiss Cas’s neck again, then his jaw, then his mouth, slowly this time. “I’m here.”
Last night. She said she wasn't gonna mention it because it seemed crazy, but it really freaked her out. We should probably head back ASAP.
Dean thinks,
Still pretty spooky to see your boyfriend's mom get ganked.
. He wants to say
“What are you talking about, man?”
the crazy ones,” she says breezily, then looks back down at her book so Dean doesn’t have a chance to reply. Sam chokes on a laugh that he tries turning into a cough.
homophobic. A man can't wear panties once without being gay?
“The deal is,” Sam continues, “I’ll give you enough to get you through the rest of the summer. That’s enough time to get through whatever’s left of the monsters, right?”
“I’d like that too,” says Cas, moving forward slightly. Dean leans in and pauses. Cas does the same. Then they do it at the same time, which results in a kiss, slow and sleepy.
(points at FBI logo on jacket)
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas says earnestly, still not looking directly in his eyes. “It’s an adjustment, to be sure. But to be honest, I’d been losing my powers for a while by the time I—by the time I returned to Heaven. It’s not like I was operating at full capacity the entire time. So I’m managing.” Finally, he looks up at Dean. “It doesn’t hurt that I’ve had good models for human living all these years.”
has put me off the concept.”
Suddenly, he’s humiliated, glad he didn’t send it.
“You can have the bed,” he said, standing. “I’ll take the chair.”
Dean closes his eyes, hoping that maybe he’ll simply disappear instead of having to explain this out loud to Cas. When he opens them, he’s still there.
“Is that why you haven’t been answering my calls? Too busy?” Sam waggles his eyebrows and Dean puts his face in one hand.
(sighs - then)
Nothing from Dean this time. He just takes his eyes on a grand tour of the garage.
“And now I’m alive again,” he says against Dean’s mouth, quietly, hardly pulling away at all.
“Honestly, not so much,” says Dean. “I’m working on renovating this piece of shit house, and Cas just got a job.”
Sam stares at him: What the fuck, man? Dean looks at him, eyes empty. He just looks exhausted.
Dean laughs bitterly, looks up at the unfinished ceiling.
I know. Crazy, right? Anyway, I'm just calling to let you know I got engaged.
“No need to thank me,” says Cas. “I’d be truly happy to make a pie any time.”
There’s a long pause.
Cas hums a little indignant noise. “Well, God is my son, and I love him very much,” he says. “I think I’m entitled to some reasonable concern.”
“I’m sorry if I ever let you believe that I didn’t.”
“It’s okay, Dean.” He pulls away slightly, but leans his forehead back in, thinks carefully before speaking again. “My colleagues all like you very much.”
, but he’s trying to be less unnecessarily mean, so he says, “Cas, you’ve already saved the world like three hundred times.”
or fuck, whatever, anything at all. Now they’re staring at each other for a beat too long and Dean wishes Tom had just said
“You can do this in the morning?” asks Cas as they head out the door.
Dean leans back on the foot of the bed. Don’t you fucking cry, he tells himself, but he’s already crying.
Come on in.
“It’s different now,” he says. “You’ve just gotta make it home, you know?”
So it's good luck after all.
, but Cas knows that. Cas has been there now. And maybe it’s fucked up, Dean realizes, to expect Claire to pull it off by herself just because he has. It’s not like she’s totally alone—she’s got a home to come back to, several even. But out there it’s a different story, even when the night’s a little less bumpy. “I’ll gather up the nonperishables.”
(clipped)
Okay, Dean thinks. Okay. So Jack, in his theoretically infinite power and wisdom, is just… tired of being God. Barely two years in. Even Chuck never got
“Who you thought was dead,” Dean supplies, “don’t forget that part.”
“Good is relative,” he says, teeth gritted with the effort of speaking. “I’ve been dead. Better than that. Still bad.”
“So,” says Sam during a short lull in conversation, like he’s been waiting for an in. “Now that you guys have, you know, the rest of your lives… What are you gonna do?”
“Don’t get too excited,” Dean says. “He’s a vegan or something.”
“Gotta get ready for work,” Dean whispers, and he leans down to press a kiss to Cas’s forehead. The moment is so normal, so domestic, that Dean feels a pang of disgust. Then it subsides and he’s just in love.
“Fine,” she says, “but I’ll miss daddies dearest.”
Sam’s thumbs up becomes more aggressive, now accompanied by vigorous nodding.
So he's loaded.
“We don’t,” says Dean, the weight of guilt and resentment settling in his chest, though he’s not sure who it’s directed towards.
“Yeah, you’re not goin’ anywhere today,” Dean says, placing a hand on Cas’s forehead. A little warm, but not burning up. Just for a second, he thinks about calling in to the shop and telling them he can’t come in today, but then he realizes that whatever Cas has, he’s probably in the running to get it now too. He shouldn’t waste a day off; he’ll probably need it next week. There’s no way to avoid it now. “Text your people and tell ‘em you’re not coming in. Gonna be okay while I’m at work?”
Hello again, gentlemen.
He reaches across the table to touch Cas’s hand again, gently. “Being a human’s pretty fucked up,” he says. He looks around, vaguely anxious that someone’s going to overhear, but he’s had weirder conversations in more public places. “You never ask for help and I just—I just want you to know you can, okay?”
On Brad, confused and upset.
“It has nothing to do with you, Dean,” Sam repeats. “Seriously. We just wanna do something for just us.”
“It’s the only thing that’s good for me.” Dean’s fist clenches, unclenches. “It’s the only thing I know, Sam, and it’s gettin’ ripped right out from under me, and if this has anything to do with you, I need to know.”
“Nah,” says Dean. Sam and Cas both look at him. “I don’t need the meds anymore. I can handle it.”
“I don’t mind your snot,” says Cas earnestly, and Dean laughs this time, is relieved when it stays a laugh.
“Hey,” Dean says. “Required is a strong word.”
“So don’t think about it. I don’t know.” Sam shakes his head. “Take it day by day. Just don’t go around pretending you’re gonna leave Cas. That’s insane.”
Brad was a good man.
Dean rolls his eyes in a big way.
You talk about your sexual conquests frequently. You've had no problem making it our business before.
—they laugh so hard and for so long that Dean nearly has to pull over.
“At the—” Cas narrows his eyes again, then realizes. “Did you get a job offer?”
“Well,” he says, hoping dearly that the sentence doesn’t get away from him, “I don’t like people. I do like cars. But I’m very charming, so I make do.” He flashes a patented Dean Winchester smile. Tom looks unimpressed but sympathetic.
The corners of Cas’s mouth slowly begin to turn down from his smile. His eyes trace Dean’s face, looking for something.
“I love you, Cas,” he says. “I love you. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”
Castiel walks in, avoiding eye contact with Dean.
“Not sure,” says Dean, “but there’s stuff in the fridge, probably. So don’t wait up.” He grabs his jacket and his phone and is halfway out the door before Cas even has a chance to reply beyond a surprised “okay.” Dean doesn’t want to hear
“Think of it this way,” Cas says. “I was at the front desk, answering calls.”
“What’s up in there?” he says, glancing over the divider.
Cas just nods, his lips pressed together in a straight line.
“I don’t think it works like that.” Cas chews his lip, deep in thought. Another new habit. Seems like every day he gets more and more human in tiny ways. Dean doesn’t know where he picks half of it up. “I don’t know. The whole situation is so… comprehensively new.”
Dean shrugs. Another sip. “No. I don’t know. Just—feels weird.”
“A charm?” Dean says, his eyebrows shooting up near past his hairline. “Like, a spell? As in a magic spell? I thought you were done with all the hocus pocus, Sabrina.”
“Time to go,” says Dean.
Kara laughs, then sighs.
“I’m sure,” Dean says, unbuttoning Cas’s shirt the rest of the way, kissing his stomach. This is one thing they haven’t done—they’d gotten in a groove over the summer where Cas usually used his mouth and Dean usually used his hands. And when they fucked, Dean was the one doing the fucking; it just felt more familiar that way. Less weird somehow. For some reason Dean could especially never get past the idea of sucking dick. It felt like the final frontier. Right now, though, it’s all he can think about.
“It’s your room, Dean. I should find somewhere else to sleep.” Cas stood up with great effort, crossed his arms. Nodded. Started to turn, but slowly, so mostly he was just standing there.
Then Sam comes barreling in.
Then it’s morning and Dean is blinking awake, vaguely hungover but alive.
“But those were fake.”
His phone rings. He checks the caller ID: KARA PARKER. He picks up instantly, but tries to seem nonchalant.
Sam is confused. Then, realization dawns on his face. Oh.
“You’re doing a thing,” he says, and Cas blinks, taken aback.
“What else?” says Sam. “I don’t know, maybe we can talk about what you and Cas have been doing alone together for
Cas thinks for a second. “More like a campaign trail for office he’d already won.”
“Cas,” Dean says, and what he really wants to say is
Under the weight of a brain that’s somehow entirely full with thoughts and also entirely empty, Dean deflates. Something about it feels weird—not bad, just weird. Letting Sam do this. But he’s not really
I'm - Cas, you gotta understand how hard this is for me. I don't wanna spill my guts right now but I kinda can't help it.
I know, but I'm pretty sure I'm close to something here. Something... Yep, right here.
Dean will worm his hand out from under. He can tell it bothers Cas but neither of them say anything.
Sam’s eyes soften.
“Oh,” says Dean, “sorry, yeah, this is Dean.” He pulls the phone away from his ear just an inch and mouths
Dean swallows hard.
You mean, you're - you -
and it scared you,” Sam says, like it’s finally clicking into place.
Oh my god.
He pulls away just enough to tap their foreheads together, brings up a hand to touch Cas’s face. Rubs his thumb along Cas’s cheek.
“Wow,” Dean says. “I have
And our luck.
“Oh,” says Sam, suddenly softer. The gaze he sets on Dean is equal parts concern and suspicion. “Did something happen?”
“Shit,” he said, “your birthday’s in less than a month and I haven’t thought about what to get you.”
That particular phrasing cuts a little close, given the circumstances, so Dean shuts his mouth. When Sam leaves the room to gather sandwiches, Cas stands too, and comes around the table to place his hands on Dean’s shoulders.
I didn't say sexual. I said romantic.
So they heard. They both heard, and Cas waited it out. It hurts a little to hear. But Dean nods.
Drinks in hand, they make their rounds: Ren is in full, functional cosplay as some video game character; Kristi from the front desk is wearing what looks like it’s probably just her cheerleading uniform from high school. Gregory, thankfully, is nowhere to be found.
“No,” Dean says. “No. You were trying to be there for me. And you fuckin’—” He looks around. “You did it. You saved me. Again. Here I am.”
“Oof,” he says, sitting up with effort. Memories start to piece together in his brain and he takes a deep breath. Pushes them away. He looks over to Cas, who’s still curled up in the bed by the wall, fast asleep and snoring.
Dean puts his hand down one final time. Looks Cas square in the face. Takes a deep breath.
Me too, man. When I woke up this morning I felt like I'd slept for three straight days.
“She works in accounting.” Cas returns to scrolling—doesn’t say anything else.
You know, I think it's sweet.
“I didn’t think it mattered,” Cas says, tilting his head, just slightly. “Is that what you’re upset about? You want to know where I am all the time?”
“Why d’you think I’m having you do it?” He climbs down from the ladder and leans in the doorway, crossing his arms. “Then again, maybe it’s just funny to watch a tall man hunched over like that.”
“Oh,” says Dean. “Yeah. I mean. Yes.”
Dean is still processing this line of thought when he realizes that Cas has led him to a real, actual person, who is taking off his headphones and smirking like he knows everything Dean is thinking. Okay—maybe it’s not smirking. Maybe it’s just smiling. Dean unclenches his hand.
“How’s the birthday boy?” Dean says when Cas slides into the car, and Cas gives him a modest smile before leaning in to kiss him.
“One’s for you,” he says, picking up the nearest one. “Bottoms up.”
Cas grabs the remote, turns off the TV. He leans back on the headboard and folds his hands over his stomach, looking pensive.
Gregory and Cas both laugh. Dean also laughs, albeit less convincingly. Is he… jealous? Is that what this is? Jesus.
“Can’t he just… retire early? Pass it on to somebody else?”
Silence.
“Sweet and beautiful.” Dean can feel the smirk.
“Intolerable,” Cas groans, rubbing his hands over his face. Dean thinks about cracking a joke but decides it’s not the moment.
As they turn the corner, there she is: Kara, gagged and bound to a chair.
“I’ve had space,” says Dean. “I want back in.”
“You may think your pain tolerance is fairly high, but I assure you, Dean: It’s not high enough. Unless you have a legitimate reason for refusing the medication, I think it’s in your best interest.”
“So you think I’m gonna break his heart?” He looks up at the ceiling.
He’s not totally sure how to respond; he’s still feeling a little tipsy. Tipsy—god, what is he, a teenage girl? He snuggles up closer to Cas.
Cas, man, I'm so sorry. I don't wanna be saying this. I don't want you to know how I feel.
getting married, given the crazy amount of illegal paperwork kind of bolstering my existence.”
Whoa. That's - I mean, okay. Do you?
I'll let you know when we're hiring.
“I don’t know,” says Dean, voice tight, “I don’t know. It just—you adapted so
“Make it up to me? Not to look a
“He’s good,” says Cas. “He likes the work. He stays fairly hands-off—he says he doesn’t want to get involved and mess everything up, so he’ll just let things run their course. Maybe someday things will be different, but… Well, he’s the Almighty. He can make that decision when he wants to.”
She takes another long sip of her beer. “All I can say is I’m not the first preteen to have Daddy leave town and come back different with a hot twink on his arm.”
He feels Cas exhale a warm breath against the lower half of his face. “I know, Dean.”
“I love you,” Cas says, serious as a funeral, completely incapable of a casual bye-love-you, as Dean gets into the car.
With his word bank for the next year or so exhausted in a single stretch, Cas just smiles and nods.
“Anything about the past two weeks make you think I
“Obviously,” Dean chokes out.
“Oh,” says Cas, dragging his hand slowly off Dean’s back, as if he’s scared to remove it. “Anything I can help with?”
On Castiel - up to Misha's discretion about reaction.
Dean gulps. “Yeah.”
“All of the above,” Dean says, mostly to get Cas to shut up. “Everything that’s not one-night-stands and hook-ups and only going back to someone when you have nowhere else to go.”
“A gift,” he says.
“Claire,” Cas says, leaning forward seriously and speaking slowly, carefully, “Dean and I have something to tell you.”
“You good?”
Then he realizes he has no idea when Cas talked to Sam about any of this. He really needs to pay more attention.
“Well, for one thing, I’m giving up hunting for good,” Dean says. The thought keeps recurring to him: This is the end. And he gets to decide what that means. “Not least because I already got most of the bastards this summer. Makes the decision a little easier.”
“Shit,” says Dean. This is all above his paygrade. But at least Jack’s letting him live his own life. Theoretically. “Good on him for trying. If he figures it out, though, don’t tell Sam.”
“And Naomi,” Cas says, nodding.
The coroner winks.
Yeah, well, this is what you get for getting involved in my business.
Sounds pretty cool so far.
“That just happens when you get old.” Dean strolls back into the kitchen, barely disguising a smirk. Glasses. Now that’s rich. All these years Cas has had the personality and bearing of a nerd in an eighties movie, and finally he’s gonna look the part. He’s also gonna look real damn cute, but Dean’s not gonna give him the satisfaction of saying that part out loud until the glasses are actually on his face, because by then Dean won’t be able to help himself. It’s another reminder that Cas is human, fragile, aging—that someday Cas will die—but after last night, he’s feeling a little calmer about that. One day at a time.
“What did
So he heads back over, and Cas is waiting outside for him, barely concealing a huge smile by tightly closing his mouth, which makes him look both unsettling and endearing, like a sock puppet.
None of you are married.
Dean grunts.
To be honest, Dean can’t even remember the last time he had a cold. It’s because of the whole deal with Chuck, he guesses. He’s lucky twenty years of backed up minor sickness hasn’t caught up with him since they killed God, despite his newfound tendency towards the accident prone. In the kitchen, he panics for a second. Does he even know how to take care of somebody who’s sick anymore? He did it all the time for Sam when they were kids, but that was so long ago. His hands are making tea while he frets about what he’s supposed to do for Cas; he hardly realizes he’s already doing it. He picks up the honey Cas got from the farmer’s market when Sam insisted on taking them—honey is good for a sore throat, right? He squeezes some in and carries it back to the bedroom. Cas is sitting up a little more than he was when Dean left, his head lolled over, his forehead scrunched and eyes barely open. Dean sits down gingerly on the bed, wordlessly offers Cas the mug. Cas takes it, takes a sip. His whole body seems to relax a little bit, and he leans his head back on the headboard as he turns his eyes towards Dean again.
Dean wheels around, suddenly remembering that Cas is there, it’s real, not some kind of murder-induced hallucination. Cas is on the floor, sitting up with the support of one hand, blinking fast, splattered with vampire blood.
“Better be a damn good reason for this,” Dean grumbles as he makes his way to the door. He looks through the peephole and sees something shaped like a man. Grabs his machete off the nearest table. “Better not intrude on my four hours.”
“You do look professional,” Dean says. “And very handsome. You’re gonna charm the asses off ‘em. You ready to go?”
Dean visibly tenses.
Ren opens their mouth, probably to say
Sam looks up slowly, like he’s surprised.
“Before what?” Cas says, colder and calmer than ever. “Before we were together? Before we were intimate with each other? Before I came back to Earth? Before we—before we became close, before we met, before I raised you from hell? What, Dean?”
Everybody looks at him, a little tense, a little worried.
Dean nods. Keeps nodding.
“Okay, I’m recording,” says Emily. “Go!”
Cas isn’t paying attention—he’s licking the spoon from his coffee, absently, kind of obscenely. Dean clears his throat. Crosses his legs.
“You stay in the car,” Dean says when they’re almost to Sam’s. “It’s gonna take him a second to get caught up, and I don’t want him trying to take you out.”
INT. BUNKER - HALLWAY - NIGHT (DAY 4)
“I’m sure,” he says, gazing up at Dean. Dean feels it like an arrow through his heart: This is the name he gave Cas, and Cas wants to keep it forever, for good. No more
“For years you made me feel—you made me feel unwanted. And I just need to know that if you want me, you truly want me.”
Sam grins and pats Cas on the back, and then Cas and Eileen are gone and Sam’s in the living room, pulling up carpet, while Dean puts drywall on the ceiling of the kitchen.
“You can’t, uh,” Sam stutters, wiping at his mouth, “well, I mean, I guess you
“Come on,” he says. “I’ll show you the bedroom. It’s a little less depressing.”
No, I - you'd just be surprised how often we get that. Today, specifically. Or I guess maybe you wouldn't.
“No,” says Dean, “nope.”
Dean has questions, but he’s not even sure really what they are. He settles on: “Do they—you know. Do they like him?”
getting undue attention.”
“Fuck, okay.” Dean sits up on his elbows. “Gettin’ kinda close there. Do you—do you want—” He’s not even sure what he’s asking.
Cas tilts his head, just a little. Doesn’t say anything for a second. “I don’t know,” he says finally. “I just didn’t think you would be interested.”
Sam rolls his eyes.
“What?” he says. “Oh, uh, yeah. Well, there’s always the classics. You know. Fairies. Good ol’ Nessie. I’m sure there’s plenty of stuff we never even found, just out there, waiting.”
“You might not wanna talk about it,” Dean says, “but how is he?”
“I had myself on secretary duty,” Cas says tersely. “I thought it was only right that I be the one fielding complaints. Many of which were about me.”
,” he says, and he tries to roll over, but it’s harder than it should be, hurts more than it should. Hurts at all, is the problem.
“Dean,” Cas says softly, reaching for his hand.
“All right,” says Cas. “Okay. I’m going in now.” He doesn’t move.
So Cas is thinking about it too. Getting married. Someday. That’s good, right? That has to be good. But he’s not ready. But it’s good. Right? Someday.
(teeth clenched)
Dean cocks the gun. Marjorie holds up a finger.
BLACKOUT.
“Cute baby,” Dean mumbles, still lost in his thoughts. Cas looks up at him, confused—but then he says, “She was.”
Accidentally?
“Vegan rotini with roasted vegetables,” Sam shouts back.
Dean is about to protest, but realizes that in order to do that, he would have to unclamp his teeth from the inside of his cheek. He smacks his mouth, stretching his jaw, not looking Cas in the face.
“You know,” he says, pulling back, “it—it all made me miss Jack.”
I suppose it's a welcome distraction.
Cas hums a reply, and in a few moments he’s snoring right into Dean’s ear. Dean wouldn’t give it up for anything.
“I’m not sure. Maybe both. I’m just… I’m not sure he’s happy as God.” It sounds like something Cas is afraid to admit, maybe even embarrassed.
“Ah, of course,” says Cas.
“Well, ever since you pretty much singlehandedly put the hunters’ union out of business,” she says, and Dean shifts his weight, clears his throat, “not a whole lot.”
“I noticed,” Cas says coolly, eyes trained on Dean’s face. “Why?”
Cas swallows hard, nods.
Oh. Uh, yeah. No worries. See y'all at home.
Dean rubs a thumb gently over Cas’s jaw, barely conscious that he’s doing it. “Couldn’t Jack, like… Put ‘em somewhere?”
“Is that true?” says Dean, turning to the other one. “Pretty crass of you.”
“Well, we’d better get you some hunting clothes,” says Dean. Cas looks up at him, wide-eyed and hopeful. “I mean, if you’re gonna be sticking with me, I’m hunting, and I expect you to pull your weight, so.”
Castiel is quiet. He's the only one who knows the truth. He feels guilty, burdened, humiliated. He can't stop staring at Dean - more than usual.
“Dean would never pass up an opportunity to wear a costume,” Cas says, which is true, but hey. “We’d be delighted.”
“I gotta—I’m going,” he chokes out abruptly. Cas furrows his brow at him in question. “Sam texted me,” he lies, “right before you got here, and he needs something, so I’m just—yeah. Gonna go over there.”
Dean looks at Cas, smirking, but—speaking of
He reaches out to pick it back up, but Dean grabs for it too. Their hands almost touch but don't.
You gotta wipe my memory, man.
By now it must be around 9, because a few more folks are starting to filter in. A middle-aged butch lesbian walks in and shouts, “Y’all gonna play any Etheridge tonight?” to raucous laughter from John D. Then there are a few tittering college girls, not too many, and some younger folks, all with dyed, asymmetrical hair and jean jackets. The music is getting a little louder—Dean realizes he hasn’t been paying much attention to it, but now Cas is swaying just slightly in his seat. Not like he’s too drunk to sit up. He’s just… kind of dancing. His shoulders moving back and forth.
(then)
Hey, uh, Sammy?
But he knows Sam is right.
Cas lurks behind Dean for a while he cooks, still sleepy, arms around Dean’s waist, chin resting on Dean’s shoulder. Finally he pads off to the table to read the newspaper, and Dean hears him make a few quiet frustrated noises.
“Perhaps you just need to reframe it,” Cas says thoughtfully. “It’s also like cowboys.”
WHAT'S UP FOLKS!! sorry for the delay on this one—holidays, finals, etc etc. but i'm back in business and we have officially reached Domestic Sitcom Territory. can't wait. ALSO BE WARNED..... THERE IS ANOTHER SEX SCENE. if u actually know me i would like to apologize. ANYWAYS: ONWARD INTO SEASON 16
I get it. Grief can be weird. It hits everybody differently.
“I’m serious, Dean.” Cas reaches up to pull Dean’s hand down to his chest. He holds it there. Right over his thrumming heart. “This is a lot for me to take in.”
“It’s acceptable,” says Cas. “As you know, sometimes my—” He seems to think hard about the right word to use. “My recurrence on Earth can cause… nudity. This outfit was the best available alternative.”
! I could just listen to him talk for hours.”
They’re at a diner, and Cas has ordered enough food for three men again, but he always eats all of it. Dean doesn’t know where he puts it.
“Where are you
“Of course,” Cas says.
I guess we'll just have to wait for Rowena. I'm at a loss, man. I'm so sorry.
Today, Dean has errands he doesn’t need much help on—grabbing some books from the town library, taking their clothes to a laundromat. There’s a lot more laundry to do now that they wear the same set of clothes. Dean makes an internal note to grab Cas some new stuff while he’s out, now that he has cash. It’s Sam buying him the clothes, Dean reasons, which he would do if he was here, so it’s not just Dean wasting all his money. Anyway, he doesn’t
The bedroom, at least, is a habitable space that looks like someone lives in it. He brought most of his stuff from the bunker over: the bed and mattress (memory foam), the quilt, the dresser, the desk. The record player and all his records, a few posters on the walls. He already ripped up the carpet, just in here, so he knows there are genuinely nice hardwood floors underneath, and he can’t wait to refinish them after all is said and done. The attached bathroom has new tiles, a new tub, new counters. All in all he’s pretty proud of the work he’s done so far. He just dreads having to do the rest of the house.
(slightly muffled shouting)
Dean looks at his hands.
“You need more cash?”
Cas intertwines their fingers, squeezes Dean’s hand.
“That’s so thoughtful,” Cas says in the same way he always does when Dean does anything remotely nice for him. It actually makes Dean feel really guilty—if Cas is really that surprised when Dean does nice things for him, what does that say about Dean? “Thank you, darling.”
“Not much other than your boyfriend running his tight five by me.”
“You idiot,” says Sam. “He’s still in love with you. He came back to earth to spend a human life with you. Don’t you have any thoughts about that?”
He realizes with a start that actually he wants everybody to know how he feels about Cas. Or at least he wants to want that. It’s what Cas deserves. Somebody who’s proud to love him. And it’s not like Dean isn’t proud to love him—he is.
film, Cas starts to nod off. Dean would wake him but he thinks it’s sweet—how his head will fall just a little and he’ll startle awake, which always happens a few times before he’ll settle, warm and heavy, into Dean’s shoulder and start mumbling nonsense.
“No, you’re welcome in!” she chirps, pointing into the next room. “It’s an open floor plan, and Cas’s desk is towards the back, on the left.”
While Sam is thinking, Dean and Cas make eye contact across the table. Dean thinks maybe he’s going to explode. It’s not even about sex this time—it’s just that thinking about Cas changing his last name to Winchester, thinking about Cas holding a baby, thinking about Cas with Jack, then thinking about Cas in the garrison when they’d first met, solemn and devoted and violent—it’s all stirring some stuff up that Dean hadn’t even realized was there. He’s not sure what to call it, what to make of it.
“Anything’s enough,” says Dean. “I appreciate it, Sammy.” The stack weighs his hand down. Of course it’s too much. Dean immediately resolves to spend less than half, unless there’s an emergency. He stuffs it in his jacket pocket.
Dean just nods. Nothing he can really add.
“Well, Dad’s already stopped you from doing a lot of stuff you wanted in your life,” Sam says. “Don’t let him do it again.”
Come on, you gotta have something sordid to dig up for us. Always the quiet ones.
Cas makes a small, thoughtful noise. Dean goes into the bathroom, locks the door, stays in the shower for a long time.
Dean hurtles forward, blood running hot. He isn’t sure what he’s feeling, but whatever it is, he hasn’t felt it in years. The vamp throws a hand out and scratches at him, but he ducks just in time, punching him in the stomach with all the power he can muster, machete handle packed into his fist. The vamp doubles over, groaning, and Dean elbows him in the middle of the back, taking him down to his knees. One hand holds the guy’s shoulder while the other holds the machete to his throat.
Dean looks away. His eyes fall on some tasteful wall art.
Just helping things along,
“You talkin’ financial, or you gonna come sling some wood?”
“Just shut the door,” Dean says, shutting it in Sam’s face. He reopens it just long enough to say, “be right back,” then slams it again.
. And then last name… Novak? Probably be easier that way. Trying to get them to change the first
“I’m glad you’re okay,” she says when she pulls away, looking earnestly into Dean’s face. “Welcome home.”
“Better how?”
“And the hospital visit was covered by our health insurance,” Cas says. Dean bites the inside of his mouth.
“Keep the change,” he says. “Thanks, man.”
Brad is reeling. He stands up, starts to pace.
Sam looks down at the book again. He almost doesn't want to say.
. “Whatever you think is reasonable. I trust you.”
When they make it to the room, Cas doesn’t put anything down.
And then Sam pulls him in again and he groans, a half-attempt at feigning displeasure, but he yields to Sam’s arms around him, Sam’s hand patting firmly the area between his shoulder blades.
“Suit yourself. Come on into the kitchen and I’ll grab you a drink.”
Cas grumbles for a second, refusing to look Dean in the eyes. Then he mumbles, “PB&J?”
“What was I supposed to be watching?” Cas says as they head back to the room.
Within minutes, Sam has already emailed him one, specialized for mechanic work, plus a pre-written cover letter; he must have had this prepared since they talked last week, maybe even earlier than that. Dean rolls his eyes but deep down, there’s the pang of the knowledge that he’s cared for, cared about, even (maybe especially) when it comes to stupid stuff like this. He works through the applications—Cas sure wasn’t kidding about having to memorize a whole-ass script distinct from his real life—and sends them off. Then he just sits there some more. It all feels like playacting, like throwing a paper airplane into the wind—no way is he actually gonna hear back from any of these places. Anything he can imagine looks fake and two-dimensional in his mind’s eye. He does
Sam and Eileen exchange a glance.
“Sore throat,” Dean says, “okay, shit, I’ll make you some tea, you like tea, that’ll help.” He starts to edge himself out of the bed, but almost unthinkingly scoots back in to press a soft kiss to Cas’s temple. He can’t help himself. Cas looks so breakable, so distressed.
The coroner nods at the personnel member with the phone baggie, who takes Sam aside to give him Kara's information.
“Anyway,” says Sam, sitting back in his chair, passing Eileen a meaningful look. “Do you guys have any plans for the evening? Gonna show Cas around town, maybe see a movie?”
On Brad, shutting his laptop. This is all he's wanted to hear for the past year.
The clothes are a little preppy for Dean’s taste—sweaters and cardigans, khakis and button-ups—but probably suitable for the kinds of jobs he’s applying for, and he buys it from Eileen that Cas looks very cute in everything. He sits down in front of Cas and nods intently at every item. Cas is obviously ecstatic to have his own stuff, stuff he picked out for the first time in his life. He could have changed clothes any time, but he always said he liked Jimmy’s clothes, was used to them, so there was no need. Last time he was human, he stole his clothes—the hoodie, the t-shirt, college kid chic—from the laundromat. Over the summer, he just wore whatever flannels and jeans Dean had around or picked out for him. But now, Dean supposes, it’s different.
Dean closes his eyes and leans his head back. It feels good, feels really good. And if he keeps his eyes closed he can pretend it’s—well, somebody else. A woman. He tries that. Then he realizes for sure he doesn’t want to. He wants it to be Cas. It feels so good to have Cas touching him, Cas’s hands, Cas’s warm, wet mouth. He looks down, runs his fingers through Cas’s hair again, and Cas looks up at him with those eyes.
“Two of ‘em. Well.” Jake straightens up, wipes his hands on the front of his coveralls. “Still didn’t answer my question. Where’s he live?”
. Pretty fucked up.
“It’s like cheese.” Sam rolls his eyes and Eileen giggles.
With a soft
I hope Cas is okay. I don't even know how he learned to drive. He's kind of a bad driver. It's cute.
“Any time. But I’m sure you would have ended up going out to eat with one of your super cool coworkers.”
The book said you needed an object to set the curse. What did we leave here?
Cas shakes his head. “With Amelia gone and Claire an ally… I don’t think there’s anyone left to wonder about him. I’ve been able to impersonate him a few times without issue.”
“Their youthful ardor is contagious,” Cas says, watching after them fondly.
But sometimes, they’re lying in bed, after sex or late at night or in the early morning, and Cas will touch his face like that’s the only way to communicate the depth of his feeling, and Dean knows that for the first time in his life he’s in love, real love, that this is the thing he’s been waiting to find, the thing he tried to convince himself so hard he didn’t need. Now he just has to not fuck it up.
“Not really,” Cas says quietly. “I didn’t feel right about reaching out.”
gonna break his heart?”
Agents Bruce, Clapton, and Baker FBI. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?
Is that how Sam feels about Eileen?
Right in front of him, it’s Claire: her hair cut short above her shoulders and shaved into an undercut on one side, her eyeliner heavy and smudged, her clothes all black.
But tonight Cas keeps kissing Dean’s neck, slowly, thoughtfully, like he’s stalling for something.
Not dignifying this with a response. Goodnight, dude. See you in the morning - curse-free.
“Yeah, yeah, sure,” says Dean, still absently rubbing Cas’s shoulder. To be honest, he kind of doesn’t want to. With the weird first date energy that’s already hanging around, it feels almost like going to your prom date’s house to take pictures. But it’s the polite thing to do, and Cas wants to see Sam tonight, and Dean doesn’t like telling Sam no about stupid, mundane shit like this. Life’s too short.
“Merchants is great, very hearty, kind of farm-to-table. And 715 is Italian, good atmosphere for a date. All of these are downtown, so you could just go walk around and see what you find.”
“That’s the deal,” he says. “I pay for the summer and then you come back. I help with the house. Cas can make his own decisions.”
But he’s Dean Winchester and it doesn’t work like that.
“Okay. Like what?”
“Cas,” he says, swallowing down the voice in his head saying
“How do you know?” says Cas. He doesn’t take his eyes off the screen. “You’ve never had a job.”
“Hello, Sam,” Cas says. He sounds equal parts pleasant and wary.
“Well, yeah, but—” Dean can’t think of a clever retort, so he just says, “Do as I say, not as I do, okay? And I say you deserve a good birthday. Birthdays are
“Nowhere else I wanna go,” says Dean. He rubs Cas’s shoulder. Thinks about saying
Cas sighs, then turns his face up towards the ceiling. “You should know he forgives you for everything,” he says eventually. “I didn’t think it was my place to speak for him, but, if we’re having this conversation…”
But then Dean remembers his fucking solemn daily vow to do better, to do better for Cas—in general, but especially for Cas—and this isn’t doing better. This is letting Cas handle his shit for him, yet again. So he leans in tentatively, giving Cas a quick peck on the cheek before he loses his nerve.
“Hey, okay,” Dean says, throwing out a stabilizing arm. “Feelin’ it now? Yeah, maybe sit.”
“Maybe it’s the dramatic reunion with your best friend who’s been in love with you for many years.”
In the following long, awkward silence, the longest and most awkward so far, Dean chugs the rest of his beer.
Sam and Cas glance at each other, panicked.
“Shut the fuck up.”
“It matters what you want too, Dean.” That’s all he says.
“I have a, uh. I have a surprise for you.”
“I was just
“Jack?” Dean shifts. “What’s up with Jack?”
Sam looks up as he folds the last of the carpet over itself in the middle of the room, brushes his hair out of his face.
Dean ignores him, smoothing down the wrinkled shirt with his hand, then waggles his finger at the bathroom door. “Sam, uh, he heard the shower over the phone. He thought you were my… friend.”
Sam looks at him, into him, one eye narrowed, then nods once, as if intentionally stepping away from the conversation.
“I’m starving,” he says once he’s stared enough. “Let’s go.”
“Depends on who
Cas had surprised Dean with that one—when Sam dropped him off at the house, he dropped the paper in front of Dean on the table and said, “Look at the birthday.”
Dean hesitates just long enough for Sam to get concerned.
“He’s not interested in that. Like I said: democratized.”
would run his hand up and down Cas’s back, press kisses to his forehead, until Cas calmed down enough to go back to sleep. They’ve never spoken about it during daylight hours, and for the most part he doesn’t know what Cas dreams about. Dean supposes if he’d gotten by without sleep for millennia, he’d be pretty freaked out by dreams too.
The second she turns her back, Dean has his hand in the bowl, rifling for a candy bar. He grabs a couple tiny Snickers, stuffs them into his pocket, and runs to catch up with Bridget.
Dean, hey, maybe you shouldn't -
,” Emily gushes. “That is so funny.”
God, this sounds so crazy. I sound like such a gold digger. But, like, Brad and I used to date, right? We were together for five years. And I dumped him last year because I couldn't see myself marrying him. And then I met Trent, my fiancé, and my family loves him, and he got me this amazing apartment, and this incredible ring -
“Go time,” he says to Cas, opening the car door, and they walk back up to the door together.
It takes a second, but Cas sits up slightly, shaking his head to clear the sleep out.
I did not.
“I’m gonna take a shower,” Dean says, but when he tries to stand, he can’t. His back hurts too much. “Fuck,” he hisses, doubling over. For a few minutes he’d forgotten about it. Cas looks mortified.
“Yes,” says Cas, who is blinking very quickly, but otherwise holding up well. “Very funny. Different Deans, I assure you.”
Safiya presses on. “How did you meet, anyway?”
That's why I don't let Cas drive my Baby.
“I really…” he says. “Cas, I really missed you.”
I want the necklace Brad gave me.
“The whole time?” says Dean. “Come on. No way.”
, he thinks,
about him, obviously. It’s no secret, not anymore. So there’s no point in trying to treat it like one.
“Emphasis on the
Please. Cas, please.
“If that’s what you want, I think it sounds perfect.”
“Oh, am I finally getting the fashion show?” Dean calls out after him, and Cas calls back, “Maybe.”
“There can be Home Depot,” Dean says, trying very hard to get back around to the point, “but I thought you were gonna be here and you weren’t. And I didn’t know where you were. And I was worried.”
From Cas, a short, dry laugh, so short and dry it’s mostly just a quick exhale.
He points to the glass. “You nervous? You do that when you’re nervous sometimes.”
“Cas?” he says, edging into the room mug-first. “You awake?”
(to Dean, mocking)
I don't want you to leave. I never want you to leave. I wish you were here all the time. Every time you leave it's like you take a part of me with you. "Every time you go away, you take a piece of me with you" - that's a Hall & Oates lyric. Classic.
“I think we’re good,” Dean says. “Seriously, thank you. Thanks for… everything. For letting us stake out here.”
Almost there with the rift. We'll get it open pretty soon. We're just gonna need some good luck.
Castiel is already halfway out the door. Dean grabs his head (please make it stop) as if that's going to help somehow. Sam has no idea how to react to any of this.
“Hm.” Dean looks up, sees that the girls are still on the bench, staring.
Dean feels his jaw set but he can’t do anything about it. “And why don’t I get to be a part of any of this, huh?”
The next night, stopping through a rural town in Oklahoma and still feeling restless from the visit to Sam, Dean is itching to get out of the motel room.
“You know you’re always welcome,” he says. “No matter what.” Then he pulls away, heads towards Cas, says, “You too, buddy. Always.” They embrace too, and a soft place in Dean’s heart is really happy to see them back together.
Dean blinks his eyes open. Looks at Castiel. Notices the hand on his face. Castiel removes it.
There’s one bag that Cas saves for last. “Wait here,” he says, and he hops up with the bag, carrying it into the bedroom.
“What do you know the words to?”
Sam glances between them. Castiel also seems surprised by this development.
“Did you sleep?” Dean tries, following suit, sitting down on his own bed, facing Cas. He takes a bite. “Are you feeling better?” Everything he could possibly say feels like a landmine but he can’t just say nothing.
Look, I tried to call one girl and I don't think I can do this. I told her I was cursed. I can't just not say I'm cursed. 'cause, you know, I'm cursed. I'm freakin' these poor girls out.
“First of all,” says Sam, bringing his elbow up on the table and lifting one finger, “it’s environmentally friendly. Now that we’ve saved the world a couple times, I’d kind of like to keep it around. Second—” He brings up a second finger. “It’s healthy.”
Sam mentions it over dinner in passing, like it’s no big deal, and then he says, “I mean, it’s not really a big deal.”
“Well,” he says. He coughs with the strain of speaking. He can’t tell if he can or can’t feel his lower body—if it hurts or if it’s just not there. “I didn’t think it would be today.”
No rings.
“Biologically I’m all yours, pops,” Claire says, kicking her feet up on the table, tilting her head towards Cas.
He means it when he says, “Yes. Very lucky.”
“Yes.” Cas leans over, smiles into his shoulder. “You would.”
So what do we do?
That does make Dean feel a little better—just a little. The bad feelings stir back up almost immediately.
Dean hadn’t been spending much anyway, had planned to give most of it back—all he really needed was gas, hotel, and supply money. He wasn’t really eating much, maybe one big, cheap meal every couple of days, and beer as often as he could swing it. Beyond that, spending was minor. But now Cas is here. Cas who needs a bed to sleep in, food in his stomach. A lot of food.
Dean finally looks up at Castiel. Whoa. Harsh.
“How’d Sammy propose then? A knife?” Dean smirks, and then realizes how plausible it is, so he stops smirking and pretends it was a real question the whole time.
Cas just blinks at him. “Oh,” he says, placing the bags gingerly on the table. “I guess I didn’t. I’m sorry.”
“Such an interesting establishment,” he says. “The décor is inconsistent, but it feels… homey.”
“Crowley. Shall I go on?”
“I’m okay,” Dean says. “Hey, I’m great. I promise.”
content warning sam is a huge normie now
Cas looks up at him, eyes wide like a terrified cat, Dean’s fingers still scratching absently at his scalp. “I’m—I’m under a lot of stress.”
“Yeah,” says Sam, shifting uncomfortably from foot to foot. “I hadn’t really thought about that, I guess.”
mercy, and you hardly even know it, and I don’t deserve you. You’re a better man than me and everybody I’ve ever met. And even if you weren’t I’d still—because it’s you. It’s always you. So I’m glad last night happened, okay? It was good. Because you’re good. And every second I’m with you is better than every minute I’m not.”
“I don’t know,” Dean says. He shakes his head. “I don’t know. I’m done asking Sam for help, you know? He’s his own man, I’m my own man.”
Witch stuff strikes again.
“It is a shame,” Cas says sincerely. “So is this… the crowd?”
“Listen, I just need to get the oven replaced and then you’re gonna forget Sam ever even cooked you a meal, all right? I’m gonna cook for you. I’m gonna do everything for you. And I’m—I’m gonna take you out sometimes, if you want, ‘cause you deserve it.” He places a hand on top of Cas’s, thinks for a second. “It’s just hard to adjust. I’ve been hunting for literally my entire life, you know? I’ve never been a go-to-restaurants kind of guy. Never been a settle-down kind of guy either. But now I guess that’s path I’m on, and it’s kind of freaking me out, because I don’t have the first fuckin’ clue how to do any of this, Cas. Not one clue. But I’ll do it for you, because that’s the kind of life you’ve earned, the kind of life you came back down to Earth for, and I always, always want you to have everything you want.”
After a few minutes, they both pull away, Cas saying, “I don’t know if I can tonight,” at the same time Dean is saying, “Maybe we should sleep first.” They stare at each other. Then they both laugh.
“Still crazy that you love me,” he says. “Every day I wake up and it’s like—whoa. He loves me. You know?”
You know the answer to that question better than I do.
Not sure. It just says the spell requires an object given "from the lover to the beloved."
“Got a little too convoluted for us,” he says, shrugging.
This is what you get for getting involved in the business of others.
“I’m an open book. You only have to ask.” Cas shrugs, then points his drink towards the guy’s chest. “Dean, this is Nick. He’s in the office about once a week. Nick, Dean.”
cute. Right, Dean?”
Back on the floor, they’re playing “Jackson” by Johnny Cash.
Dean feels a flash of pity that turns into self-pity when he realizes that he hasn’t had a lot of repeats either—mostly it’s been one-and-done deals for him. He kisses the top of Cas’s head.
On Sam. Here we go.
“That’s crossing a line, man. What’s that shit even for?”
“Not once,” says Cas. “Never.”
Cas drags Dean to his feet, helps him over to the bed. He starts taking off Dean’s shirts without being asked, then inspects the wound.
“How about this,” Sam says, finally, slowly. “I’ll strike you a deal.”
“Yeah,
You, uh... You... figure it out. Okay.
Sam exits, leaving Dean and Castiel alone together. Dean tries to discreetly put his hand back over his mouth. It is impossible to do so discreetly.
“Not so fast,” Dean says, holding out a panicked hand. He thought Cas would be happy but he doesn’t even seem to realize what’s going on. “It’s supposed to just be one.”
Just because you honestly believe it doesn't make it unequivocally true.
“Cas.” He starts to say a word beginning with
“I—I don’t know what—”
Dean moves his eyes from Sam to Eileen, who is following Cas with her eyes and beaming, and to Cas, who is staring straight at Dean.
Cas shrugs. “He said he was planning on keeping it in retirement, but I needed it more than he did right now. Again, he emphasized its safe return.”
“He’d be God whether I was with him or not.”
. You got it?”
“Successfully.”
Dean rolls his eyes. When John D gets back Dean gives him a glare. John D winks, putting down the rum and Coke and two unordered shots.
“I think he would be glad to hear from you,” he says between bites, not looking Dean in the eyes. “And I would be glad to see him.”
A few minutes pass and Dean is starting to get really curious—he stands and considers going to knock on the door, but stops when he hears it creak open. Out walks Cas, smiling proudly, and Dean feels like all the breath has been knocked out of his body. He’s wearing dress shoes, black slacks, a blazer to match, a white-button up. A blue tie. Dean looks back up from gawking at the outfit to see Cas’s face fall, and he doesn’t know why until he realizes he’s crying.
He rolls on top of Cas and Cas lets him. One of Cas’s hands keeps fluttering between Dean’s upper arm, his shoulder, and the small of his back, over and over and over. After a few rotations, Dean recognizes the pattern: handprint, ladder, gunshot.
Dean falters.
"Actually,” says Cas loudly, leaning forward over the table, because he still isn’t totally sure how speakerphone works, “Dean is taking me on a date.”
Dean sighs again. This is gonna be rough.
Sam shuts his eyes and exhales. Like he knew this was coming.
“At least I’ll
“We’re here,” Cas says with both a finality and a tenderness that make Dean’s sleep-addled brain feel a little mushier.
Dean considers. It
Excuse me?
Dean presses his lips together, trying to get any sort of read on Cas’s feelings about the situation. Did he fuck up somehow?
“Nothing. Why do you ask?”
Cas looks away but nods. “He’s on his way. I called him once you were stable. I didn’t want to give him news without knowing what kind.”
Tom shows him around: the garage, the back, the office. It’s a small place, all things considered.
So many people I had sex with died that I thought maybe, you know. My dick was cursed.
Oh, Kara, dear, I'm so sorry.
“Yes,” says Cas, looking equal parts exasperated and fond. “He went to every individual Heaven to explain the planned changes before they were implemented.”
So for you to come in here and make me say - for you to endanger the love of my -
“Do you wanna dance?” he says, wiping the last tears from his eyes.
Which is a ticket right back to guilt-town, population Dean. This isn’t the first time he’s thought about it—when the gates of Heaven and Hell closed for good, when the monster populations started dying off at what would be a concerningly rapid pace if they weren’t monsters, Dean didn’t really mean to take things into his own hands. It was just kind of what happened. Most hunters knew he was back on the road and had stayed out of his way unless he called them up himself. He’s not so sure what that says about his reputation anymore. Maybe it says the thing he’d realized a few weeks into it, before Cas had come back: He put a whole lot of people out of work. And yeah, it’s thankless, unpaid, deadly work; yeah, maybe everybody should be grateful. But hunting isn’t just a job, it’s a lifestyle, and it’s a lifestyle Dean Winchester unthinkingly crushed under his boot when he saved the world. Some of these people have never known anything else—don’t want to. Honestly, Dean was one of them. How are they supposed to assimilate into society, get jobs, live normal lives? Theoretically that’s what Sam’s little assembly line is for, but Sam can only do so much for these people. He can’t change how they feel inside, can’t make it less of a loss.
“I mean like—” It’s weird, maybe, that they haven’t had this conversation—but then again, they’ve been
Bridget laughs and holds out a candy bowl she picked up from the console table.
“You didn’t have to come back for me.” Cas looks like he’s going to say something, but Dean keeps going. “I mean that. I’m so, so glad you did, but—if you were happy up there with Jack—”
What?
“Plenty,” says Dean, “I mean, define plenty.”
Sam, I think I'm in danger here.
“I’m sorry if I’m not handling it with very much grace.” Cas picks the sandwich back up, takes a bite. Says through a mouthful, “So to speak.”
Inside, Cas is emanating a manic energy.
“You’re fragile too,” Dean says. “Just as fragile as me. Gonna put you in a bubble so you can never break a bone or contract a disease.”
Okay, I'll... I'll go first. Um. When I was with Ruby...
“I told you when I arrived,” Cas says, “I didn’t do this all for you. I did it for me. I wanted to be with you. I want to. I want to be human. And like I said, as nice as it was to be with Jack, it was a little weird. No matter what changes, Heaven will always have… certain connotations for me.”
“Second,” Dean says, “I’m the one who should be sorry. I was weird to you all night—you know, talking about the gas station, applying for jobs, everything. I don’t know why.”
a job,” Dean says, louder than he means to. He rocks the ladder just slightly, grabs the ceiling for balance. “Shit. And I was a construction worker for a while when—you know. Lisa.”
“C’mon,” Dean says, trailing his fingers over Cas’s bicep, “time for work.”
“Yeah,” he says, scratching at the back of his neck, suddenly aware of how warm he feels. Holds up the bag again. “Uh, this is for Cas. Um, Novak. It’s just his lunch, it’s not like, anything weird, you know.” He barks out a nervous laugh and the girl blinks at him before breaking out in a smile.
“Yeah,” he says, turning on his heel and heading into the kitchen so Cas doesn’t see him tear up. “Yeah. She can.”
“I hope she’s getting along well on the road,” Cas says as they’re getting ready for bed, stumbling just a little as he takes off his shoes. “I know she said she is—I know she loves it, but…”
“I’m almost finished eating,” says Cas, suddenly concerned. “What’s the hurry?”
“I don’t know,” Dean says, and despite the hour he just spent unpacking it all with Sam, that’s still basically true. “Why didn’t you just tell me you’d be late?”
(quiet)
“I didn’t exit the company on good terms,” Cas says seriously.
“I feel very—” He pauses. “I feel very connected to most of these lyrics. It’s as if they’ve been written for me specifically.”
He’s not totally sure what to do but it’s not as foreign as he thought it would be. He just does what usually feels good for him, and it seems to be working: Cas moans, one hand grabbing Dean by the back of the head, the other grasping at Dean’s still-sleeved upper arm, right where the handprint used to be. He doesn’t even think Cas knows he’s doing it. It’s just automatic. He’s so turned on he has to stop for a second to catch his breath.
.” Around that final phrase, Cas does some little finger quotes around the beer in his hand.
“The lawyer’s apprentice,” says Dean. “Okay. Okay. Go on.”
“Gotta tell you something.”
When they’ve dumped him in the passenger seat of Baby and everybody has said their see-you-very-soons to Sam, he turns to Cas.
There's a knock at the door. Then a woman's voice:
“Are you surprised?” says Dean, collapsing into the recliner.
I just don't understand. He was alive. I just talked to him. And then - and then -
When they get back to the hotel room, Dean makes a call while Cas is in the shower. Sam picks up on the second ring.
Cas today. It’s fine if he stays in the room. So why does it feel so bad, the idea of leaving him alone all day? Then again, maybe it’s good not to be around each other right now.
“Don’t like people, huh?”
The process is slow, but he makes it into the bathroom, shuts the door. Dean exhales loudly. He returns to the laptop.
(taps book)
Cas looks up at him, bemused. “But you’re… experienced.”
“Have you talked about any of it?”
“Do you love me?”
“Duh,” she says, and clearly she knew what he was going to say the entire time and was just enjoying making him squirm. “You’re together. Glad to see you weirdos finally got your shit figured out.”
“Can do,” Sam laughs.
“You’ll be seeing me in these clothes for a long time to come,” says Cas, sitting down on the newly hardwood floors and carefully pulling clothes out of bags, placing them in stacks. “I’ll just show you what they look like off my body for now.”
Dean can’t help himself—he cracks up, burying his face in Cas’s shoulder, still swaying, still pressing Cas close. Cas scratches his back lightly, which eventually turns into Dean kissing Cas’s neck, which turns into Dean undoing the tie, throwing the blazer across the room while Cas mumbles again his mouth, “Make sure I hang that up later.”
Well, yeah, but she's still got Mr. Millionaire on the line. Not so shabby if you ask me.
“Dean,” Cas calls from the doorway. He shuts the trunk and heads inside.
The doctor looks at Dean over the tops of his glasses.
For a second, Dean thinks about asking if there’s porn in Heaven now. Then he realizes that Jack would have had to put it there, if it is, so he doesn’t want to know.
“You’d be set for life, man,” says Sam. He leans up against the wall. “That’s all I’m saying.”
“Yes,” he hisses. “Yes. Now do you wanna go or not?”
Castiel is taken completely off guard - total deer in the headlights. Not what he thought Dean was going to say.
Castiel doesn't move, but he looks away for a moment. He'd like to say he can't believe it but he can.
INT. BUNKER HALLWAY - NIGHT
“Maybe,” Cas says, scooting up just enough to lean in close to Dean’s ear, “we can watch
“No,” says Cas, “no. It just seems like maybe my vision has gotten a bit… fuzzy.”
“Fine,” says Cas, rolling his eyes and his whole head with them. “He encouraged me with force.”
Marrying Cas. Okay. It’s not like the thought doesn’t occur to him a few times a week ever since they started talking about Cas’s last name; the call comes from that part of him that wants more, always more. But they can’t, right? They can’t. Well, maybe they could. But they can’t. And anyway, why would they? Things are fine as they are. And weddings are so—they’re so
You can't do this to me.
Dean can’t argue with that. He physically can’t, because the language part of his brain is short-circuiting. He puts a light hand on Cas’s head, strokes his hair. Then Cas is sucking his dick.
Claire grins, sticking her tongue out slightly from between her teeth. Dean has never seen her this happy, this adjusted. He’s proud of her.
Cas regards him suspiciously. “Great?”
poster and a yellow-and-purple flag that Dean maybe vaguely recognizes, but can’t place.
Dean nods, scoots to make room for him. When Castiel sits, as per usual, they just stare at each other for a long time. Dean tries to crack a joke.
“You know I’m headed back to Lawrence for now,” Dean says, stuffing a shirt in his bag after doing an insufficient job folding it. “That’s the deal with Sam.”
“You have no idea,” Cas says, still smiling, and okay, at least that’s something. “He had so much to say on the topic of pornography.”
“Yeah,” says Dean, too overwhelmed to muster up the stores of charm he usually has in spades for old ladies, but Janine doesn’t seem to notice. “Absolutely.”
“He’s a great chef,” she says.
“Talk about daddy issues.”
He turns his head back just far enough to look at Dean, smiles. “Wouldn’t miss your retirement party for the world, man.”
What doctor would be able to tell you -
“That’s what I’m trying to say, Dean. I don’t know how. I mean, I—I’m an adult. I’ve lived eons. I’ve learned how to brush my teeth. I fought wars and raised a son. But there are things I simply haven’t had an opportunity to figure out. Much of the time I feel helpless and stupid, and it—well, to borrow a phrase from you, it fucking blows.”
When Dean stands to dig out the takeout menus, Cas grabs the back of his shirt, tugs at it carefully.
“Whatever we’ve got, that’s what I want.” He grabs Cas’s hand, rubs gently at it with his thumb. Sam was right. Sam was so, so right. There’s no way he actually wants out of this. For the first time in maybe his entire life, he feels—well, he doesn’t know quite what to call it. But there’s not a single atom in him that wants to leave or wants Cas to go. Not at all. “Did you ever eat anything?”
There had been dancing at bars and clubs over the summer, sure, when Dean was drunk and anonymous enough not to care who would see them or what anybody would think. Sometimes they’d even gotten tipsy in the motel room and turned on the radio late at night; Dean would show Cas the dumbest dance moves he could think of and they’d take turns trying to dip each other until they collapsed in laughter on the bed. But they hadn’t danced at all since they’d gotten back to Kansas.
“Of course, Dean.”
Cas is loose and languid a few beers in, one ankle crossed over a knee, arm draped over the back of the couch.
“We have the money, dude. It’s seriously no problem.”
Sam doesn’t sign anything back, just gives her a half-shrug.
, but he can’t bring himself to do it. Why not? It’s not like he’s a fucking virgin. He’s a grown-ass man and he can talk about sex like an adult. “I enjoyed… what we did after the bar the other night. I’d like to try it again. Sometime.” Great. Fucking nailed it.
Am I wrong?
“Promoted to leadership role…” Sam mumbles. He stops to think, taps the pen to his mouth. Then he says, “Middle management.”
By the time Dean heads home, he’s forgotten almost all about his morning unease. He likes working in the garage—the guys are fine and the work is fun. He changed somebody’s oil and felt on top of the world about it. He can do this, he thinks. He can actually do this.
“I’m good,” he says, voice hoarse. “Just gotta. Be right back.”
Beat. They all stare at each other. Then Dean pointedly looks away from both Sam and Castiel.
Of course I love you.
“It’s not like it’s the Trials,” he says, standing on the highest rung of a ladder as he hangs drywall on the ceiling and Cas stares fearfully into the organization’s website on his laptop (an old hand-me-down from Sam). “They’re not gonna kill you.”
“I do insist.” He looks up at Dean, dopey and a little drunk, his head lolling slightly to the side. Dean’s chest feels tight. He coughs.
Tom is waiting for him outside the garage when he pulls up, an older guy, maybe early sixties, with glasses and a scruffy beard. He’s leaning against a car out front—Toyota Corolla, Dean notes with a hum. Dean sees raised eyebrows as he pulls up and feels the swell of pride that always accompanies people taking notice of his Baby. It distracts from the low buzz of discontent that’s still pulsing through him from breakfast.
Sam can’t come. Dean didn’t expect him to. But he offers anyway.
“I—” Cas starts. He looks away, shakes his head slightly.
Cas considers that notion for a long time. “Glasses,” he says, chewing over the word. “I guess so.”
“We just figured, you know, it feels like the right next step,” Sam says. He’s eyeing Dean with an expression that Dean can’t name, which is funny, because Dean also can’t name any of the sixty emotions currently hurtling through his own nervous system.
“Oh, right, I forgot. I’m mean and cruel.”
“I don’t—” Dean sputters. “I’m not—” And then, before he can stop himself: “You know, they should be so fuckin’ lucky. I’d be a sexy as hell lady.” He didn’t really mean to say that. Should he be embarrassed? No. He’s right. Not that he wants to. He just could if he did.
Cas nods and suddenly somehow looks ten years younger. Though Jimmy Novak’s body wasn’t supposed to age while Cas was taking up residence, Dean had noticed a few times over the past few years how ragged Cas was starting to look. How tired. How much older. It was, he supposed, because Cas had been through so much, metaphysically speaking—all the transformations, the possessions, the losing grace and getting it back. Maybe it was also because by then, Cas was a little less than an angel, a little more than a human. Now he’s just a person in a person’s body, and he’s going to keep aging like any man would. Someday, Dean realizes, Cas will have grey hair. Someday pretty soon he will too. In fact, it’s a miracle he hasn’t gone grey already. Sam started greying out basically the minute they settled into the new world. For the second time in as many days, an awareness of time—how quickly it seems to be running out now that the world is no longer ending—lodges itself into his body.
In the car on the way home, Cas gazes as Dean with unfettered affection, like he’s done something good. He hasn’t. He starts to sweat a little under the pressure, says, “What?”
“It’s fine.” Dean climbs back down the ladder, brushes the drywall off his hands before he comes over and scratches the back of Cas’s head. “I know you’re nervous. Don’t be.”
“I’m just saying,” says Sam. “I think you’d better make some decisions pretty quickly about how you feel and what you’re willing to do about it.”
He puts the penny down on the table between them. Dean just looks at it, then looks back up at Castiel.
“Would you like to help me with dinner? I’m making shepherd’s pie.”
Do you... feel any different?
Tentatively, Castiel opens the door. Dean is lounging on his bed.
“No,” says Dean, “no, I just—" He kisses Cas on the forehead, and Cas visibly relaxes. “Just took me off guard, that’s all. Haven’t seen you like this in… well, in a while.”
“No,” Dean hears himself say, and he didn’t really mean to say it, but there it is.
Cas places his hand gently over Dean’s on his arm, rubs it absently. Dean recalls the case with the guy whose heart beat out of his chest.
Of course. Jamie?
I wanna suck your dick.
“I’m gonna need you to stop talking about vomit,” Dean finally says, trying to get his Jell-O down. Cas looks surprised but doesn’t say anything else about vomit for the rest of Dean’s stay.
Dean laughs. Castiel doesn't. Dean stops.
On Sam. Not the reaction he was looking for.
Well, you work quick. Yeah, it was the ex. Kara Parker. Lives across town.
“Not much to do,” Dean says as Cas takes off his jacket. “We could watch—"
“No. The fact that I—” He blinks away, but when he turns back, his gaze is steady as ever. “Anything could happen to you and I couldn’t do anything about it. I can’t heal you. Can’t help. I can’t do anything.”
“Do you miss hunting?” he says before he can stop himself. “‘cause it seems like you don’t.”
“Yeah, maybe,” he says.
“Another drink?” Bridget raises an eyebrow at him from behind the counter.
FADE IN:
Uh, obviously.
“We’ve gotta get going,” he says. “We have a meeting with the coroner in twenty minutes.”
“Okay,” he says. And he tells Dean everything: about the open floor plan in the development office and how nervous it makes him to have people surrounding him on all sides, though the office’s structures and power dynamics do remind him in some ways of Heaven; how everybody insisted on taking him out to lunch but he felt bad about wasting the sandwich Dean made him, so he promised they could do it tomorrow; how there’s one younger employee who reminds him a little of Charlie, a fast-talking IT employee with purple hair and a bunch of bobbleheads on their desk. By the time Cas finishes narrating, they’re both sitting cross-legged on the floor, despite the three chairs next to them.
Dean tries to suck back a smile but it turns into a full-blown laugh. Cas has never been a human in real, requited love before; until now, he’s never listened to a song and thought,
(refers to the text)
“Thoughts on the music?” Dean says finally.
“And a half?” Gregory raises an eyebrow. “Color me flattered.” Before either of them can reply, Gregory says, “You’ve got a sheltered one on your hands, Dean. The church really did a number on him.”
Dean takes a drink, then another. He hasn’t been drinking so much lately but he feels like if he doesn’t put this one away right now he might die.
“I think the intern girls wanna say hi,” he says, pointing to Emily and Safiya, who are waving down at the end of the hall.
“Kind of a drifter.” He thinks about what Cas said last time Claire visited.
“Whoa there, cowboy,” says Dean anyway, turning his head to touch his nose to Cas’s. “Save that energy for another day. I’m all tuckered out.” He sees it in Cas’s eyes from mere inches away, the calculation of deciding what to say next, whether the conversation is worth pursuing at all. “I’m kidding,” he says. “I love it too.”
She smiles, bares her needly, yellow teeth.
Dean hadn’t said Cas’s name in the garage so far and he hadn’t really planned to—hadn’t used pronouns, said
“Dean,” she says, like she’s ready to divulge her deepest secret. “I just cannot tell you how delighted we all are to have you here. I mean, at the party, yes. But Cas has been such a find for us and—oh, well, I imagine for you too.” She cackles. “It’s just so nice to have you two around.”
“Of course not,” says Cas, rolling over to face Dean. “I thought I had pressured you.”
“Heaven has been effectively democratized,” Cas says. “I think I mentioned that Jack has done away with individual Heavens. It’s really more of just a… just a place now. And most of the former angels are just people. Kind of. It’s a little hard to explain.”
, even before Cas left, he’d been drinking a little too heavily for a while. Not that he never drank on the job in prior years—but this was different. He would say things he didn’t mean. Sometimes to Sam. Mostly to Cas. Or he meant them, but then, later, he would realize he was wrong and wish he hadn’t said them. But by then it was always too late.
(softly)
What matters is that I got the penny -
Kara, you'll be married.
in the
Sure you do.
“Perfect,” says Sam. It’s immediate, almost before Dean is done speaking. “We’re really excited to see you, Dean. We want to know how it’s all going.”
So, after a second, Cas does it again, then again, then he’s fucking into Dean’s mouth, holding him still. He pauses for a split second and Dean takes back over, and then almost immediately Cas is coming in his mouth, moaning, clutching the back of his head with one hand and grasping the edge of Dean’s bedtable with the other. For a moment, they’re both still. Then Cas pets his hair again, says—like he has no idea what else he could possibly say—“Good, Dean. Good.”
Honestly, speaking of that, I'm not even being totally honest right now! Which is crazy, because I'm under a truth spell, and I'm still managing to lie by omission because I'm Dean friggin' Winchester! You know, sometimes I get tired of the lying - I was thinking about this earlier on the phone with that girl - like, with hunting and everything, sure, it's easier not to tell the truth, but sometimes I wish I could. I wish I didn't have to lie. But I lie even when I don't have to, all the time. Sometimes it gets to me and I wanna stop, you know, but other times I think it's a permanent fixture, and I'll never get away from it, I'll never untangle myself, and oh my god, Cas, you have to make me stop talking or I'm gonna say some more stuff that I'm really, really gonna regret.
Extracurricular activity—meaning the dying, the resurrecting, the Leviathans, the time in Heaven and the Empty, the acquiring and losing of grace, et cetera. All that. Dean has no idea either. He shrugs.
“Mm,” Cas says dreamily as Dean finally gets the button undone. “I believe you.”
“Sam,” Cas says definitively.
“Options,” Dean parrots, still staring at the samples.
“Forgot your lunch.” He shrugs. “Thought, you know, I could stop by.”
Cas kisses behind his ear once. Then again. Nuzzles against Dean’s jaw. “You’re beautiful.”
The waitress comes and sets the food down in front of them. For a few minutes, they eat, discussing case details. From the jukebox in the corner, “Love Shack” by the B-52s begins to play.
Cas thinks for a moment. “”Believe It or Not’ by Joey Scarbury, ‘Truth Hurts’ by Lizzo, and ‘Livin’ on a Prayer’ by Bon Jovi.”
“We made you a pie,” he blurts out, setting it down on the table. “It’s an apple pie. We made it. I helped.”
More awkward staring from both parties.
Dean gulps, taken aback by the sincerity in Cas’s voice. “Dinner too,” he says, dumping the fast food bag unceremoniously onto the motel desk.
“That’s all right,” says Cas. He heads over to the doorway, stops, puts his hand on the doorframe. Turns to look back. “You have time to figure it out now.”
Cas says, “You know.” Leans in to kiss him.
“Good. That’s—that’s good. Because I don’t know what I would do if—”
Sam and Dean share a look.
, which, weirdly, is working for him. Cas’s various forays into appropriating sex appeal have had mixed results; usually it’s hottest when he’s not trying at all. But he’s learning.
“Yeah, but—” Dean can feel himself sputtering. “But I’m still me. You’re still you. I don’t—”
“Well,” he says, “I’ll think about it.”
“You met Johnny Cash?” he says. “You met Johnny Cash in
“I have things to say,” Cas says, resolute, cringing slightly when his voice breaks.
“No fair,” says Cas. “Pick something I know the words to so I can be romantic.”
A little bit of office romance. You and Mr. Serious over there.
night, he doesn’t go back. But the night after that he does. He doesn’t know what else to say, but he feels compelled to talk, so he tells Cas about his day.
Safiya just laughs. Maybe she senses that the conversation is making them nervous, or maybe she’s just chatty, because next, she says, “You two are so cute together. I’ve told you that, right? That you’re cute together?”
Ren purses their lips and squints an eye. “Technically they do the Vulcan hand kiss.”
Cas is silent for a moment. He sits down cross-legged on the floor in front of the bed. Not on the bed, not in a chair. Dean looks at him, all covered in blood, having made the weirdest choice possible about where to sit, looking small and real on the ground. His chest still hurts.
“Hey,” he says, finally coming up for air, “okay,” and Cas pushes him up against the bedroom doorframe, grabbing his hips, kissing his neck. Dean’s not even sure how they made it that far. He untucks Cas’s shirt, starts unbuttoning. When they travel inside the bedroom, Dean shoves Cas up against the wall next to the bed, pulls back to look at him. God, he looks so hot, his shirt half-undone, his hair all messed up, looking at Dean like it’s the first time, every time. Dean kisses across his collarbones, then before he really knows what he’s doing, he drops to his knees.
There's nothing to apologize for, Sam. We'll figure it out. We always do.
Cas’s hand is bloody, grasping at Dean’s shirt, turning him over, carefully, carefully. Dean notices that it’s his own blood, pooling around him. This is it, he thinks. This is it.
I couldn't have my beautiful daughter-in-law distracted from my son by some lower-class yokel.
“Hey,” says Dean, raising his eyebrows. “If I’m gonna get it, I’ve already got it.” He leans back in and this time Cas lets him brush a kiss over his cheek, the corner of his mouth. When he pulls back, Cas looks at him with a mixture of tenderness and consternation, then rolls onto his back again.
“I did.” Cas picks up his phone, starts scrolling through them. “I don’t know, Sam, I—I don’t think I’m qualified for any of these.”
He feels Sam exhale ten metric tons of tension when he walks by and claps him on the shoulder, and Cas’s eyes follow him as he gives Eileen another quick hug.
what's up friends........ i'm back and ready to absolutely forget that 15x20 happened at all!!! that being said, content warning in this chapter for an event that significantly mirrors [redacted biggest 15x20 spoiler] but i reiterate: EVERYBODY'S ALIVE (AND PROCESSING THEIR EMOTIONS) UP IN THIS B*TCH AND THEY'RE GONNA STAY THAT WAY
“—just came from a showing,” Gregory is saying to Nick a few feet away, “yeah, yeah. Well, I must play a mean Frank, since they invite me back every year.”
Dean nods, confused, thoughtful. Kind of weird. But whatever. He heads off to bed.
This revelation pushes Dean to his feet. He takes the two steps to Cas’s bed and sits down there, then shifts his legs up onto the bed, crossed at the ankles. He leans his head back on the headboard too so that their bodies form parallel lines.
“Good old Gabe,” Dean says. “Bet he’s missing Earth right about now.”
Like matchmaking?
“—and I just want to make sure you’re still comfortable with it.”
“Good for me what?” says Dean. “What’s good for me? What’s that supposed to mean?”
Cas comes back with some ice in a Ziploc bag; Dean thanks himself silently for giving Cas his work lunch sandwiches in Ziploc bags all week, because before that, Cas definitely didn’t know they existed, much less what drawer they would be in. He presses it to Dean’s shoulder, so careful. Dean brushes his fingers over Cas’s forearm, a silent
The words feel ridiculous falling out of Dean’s mouth.
“What am I missin’ over here?” Dean says as he nudges back into Cas’s space, throwing an arm around his shoulders. Cas’s drink is mostly empty now, and he gazes at Dean with unbridled affection, which makes Dean feel—okay, fine—a little better.
She nods, smiling, and says, “That’s good. Because if you made Sam feel bad, I was going to kill you in your sleep.”
“You and me both, sister,” Dean says, more confident than ever that she isn’t actually listening when he talks. Before she starts asking about their sex life, he says, “Speaking of, I should go check on him. You know. Can’t say what he’ll get up to if I leave him alone for too long.”
Sam just rolls his eyes. “Okay, okay. You’ve been thinking?”
“We don’t even have a little time?” Cas says in a manner Dean might describe as
“I’m having a very, very good time.” He looks at Dean the way he’s looked at Dean many times before. Dean now has the vocabulary to describe this look as
What about Meg? You didn't boink Meg?
Cas hums, then burrows his head back into Dean’s chest.
“Do you realize, Dean, that when you told me you loved me earlier this summer, that was the first time anyone had ever said they loved me?”
Dean waved him off. “You kidding? I’ve slept in chairs for years. I’m good. It’s your first night officially back as a human and you deserve a good night’s sleep.”
“Hittin’ you hard?”
I really don't think I have anything to offer here.
He thinks about Cas all morning; it’s a slow day and he checks his phone surreptitiously as often as possible, his heart panging every time he sees a text roll in from Cas, who’s livetexting him thoughts on
“That’s not what I—fuck.” Dean runs his hands through his hair. Try again, asshole. “I just mean like—you know, in the past, I would meet a guy like that and… and get nervous, you know? And for a long time I thought it was because I didn’t want to be around people like that, but eventually I realized it was because it makes me think about… things. It showed me things about myself that I didn’t used to be comfortable seeing.”
Dean nods, looks away, starts to chug his drink—realizes again that it’s just water.
“Honestly I’m not sure anymore,” says Dean, staring at his hands. “Was she coming onto you instead of me? Have I lost my mojo?”
“Damn, it’s good to have him back.”
to keep you alive.”
“I mean—” Dean pauses. “I mean, that doesn’t really count.”
“Pardon me,” Cas mutters.
Cas turns his head down abruptly, blinking at the table. After a moment, he returns to his omelet, then moves on to his hash browns.
“Cas—” Dean starts, because that’s not true, of course it’s not, but Cas doesn’t let him talk.
John D grabs Dean’s glass without a second glance.
Cas just lets out a long, satisfied sigh. He presses his chest, warm and solid, along Dean’s side, and soon enough his breathing starts to even out.
“Also I’m scared he wants to fuck you,” Dean blurts out. Okay, that too.
. But he was supposed to hear them.
“All right, folks,” yells John D. “Y’all know what that means. Don’t have to go home but you can’t stay here.”
, he tries thinking again, and it feels a little more right this time.
Dean swallows a laugh, says, “Mhm.”
The look Sam gives him is totally withering.
Cas looks up at him, his expression light but serious. “The truck doesn’t have to be a woman.”
. Having to stand in front of everybody and talk about how you feel, and then everyone knowing how you feel, even though, okay, the point of a wedding is that everybody already knows how you feel—he doesn’t want anybody to know how he feels about Cas. That’s just for them.
“Much of my processing I’m able to do internally,” Cas says plainly. Dean is about to question that notion when he adds, “I’ve also talked to Sam a bit about Jack. Not everything. Just the basic concerns about his well-being.”
to say?
Dean shrugs. “Yeah, but that don’t mean I don’t feel bad.”
“Thanks so much for coming, Dean,” Bridget says, turning his way with a smile that looks a little out-of-place on her sharp face. “Cas is a delight, and we really want to make him feel at home with us. Both of you.”
“So you’re coming back to Lawrence?” says Eileen.
“Seriously.” He’s still smiling, despite himself, amazed and a little invigorated by how normal it feels to hear Cas say
Dean’s filling his days as best he can: his arm healed up pretty quick, so he’s back to working on the house, which takes up a good chunk of his time. A few days a week he meets Sam for lunch, and sometimes he goes out of his way to meet up with Eileen for lunch in Olathe. Lots of Netflix. Lots of staring at his phone. He’s starting to look at other jobs, thinking about maybe asking Sam to throw him together a bartending resume. He’s been looking at cars for Cas too, trying to find something sensible and affordable that’s not also massively lame. The thing about all Cas’s previous cars is that he stole them, which added a cool factor that isn’t necessarily attainable now. And when Dean asks Cas what he wants, his tastes are inconsistent at best: Mostly he likes trucks, but once he pointed at a Kia Soul downtown, said, “That one’s nice,” and Dean’s soul left his body momentarily. Honestly Dean isn’t sure where the truck thing came from.
How... how you feel?
“It’ll be here all night, but you can go ahead and pick your poison. We probably won’t get any more trick-or-treaters at this hour.”
“It’s fine,
Dean looks around, realizes there are no other glasses in the room, no dishes, nothing. Normally he’d be grateful for the cleanliness, but—
The next night, the same thing. He sits down. He says, “I think you changed me too, Cas. Maybe just not enough.” And then it’s too hard, so he goes back home.
Cas’s whole face softens. “You talk about me?”
,” Cas says.
“He loves the Food Network,” Dean offers.
“I was with him,” Cas says slowly, “in Heaven.”
“Sometimes,” says Cas. Something about this answer strikes Dean’s heart with incredible force, and without thinking, he leans forward and kisses Cas gently. And then he thinks,
I thought you meant
“On a Monday?” she says.
Cas sits up too, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. Dean has to look away.
“You said we needed to paint the walls,” he says. “So I got paint samples.”
“Got your ears on, Cas?” he says. “Guess not, huh.”
“But I’m not changin’ my last name,” he grumbles.
There’s a big part of Dean that thinks he shouldn’t push it—that Cas regrets it, of course he regrets it. Why wouldn’t he? It’s weird. Sleeping with your best friend—the person you’re pretty much trapped in a room with for the next two months at least—in your newly human body, super drunk, after just returning from a long absence from Earth that was instigated by your own confession of romantic feelings towards that very person. Cas is the one who would hardly touch Dean last night afterwards. Cas is the one who got back in his own bed in the middle of the night.
On Sam, settling into the Impala. Maybe this is a good sign.
“Fastidious,” Dean mumbles. “I mean, you can’t say it isn’t clean.” He looks at Cas, who’s inspecting his face. Somehow Dean is still surprised every time he looks in Cas’s eyes just how big they are, how blue, how tired, how emotive. He doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to having Cas see right through to the core of him, like a one-sided mirror.
“I didn’t think it was necessary. I didn’t want to draw undue attention to myself. You and Sam never seem to celebrate birthdays.”
Cas nods with an expression that Dean finds unreadable. Worry and irritation bubble up inside him simultaneously. He doesn’t want Sam and Cas keeping secrets. But he doesn’t even know if they are.
These are FBI agents. Guys, this is Trent's mom, Marjorie. She's amazing.
“Dinner,” he says as he sits down, then holds out his hands as if that means something.
Which is that you still loved him.
She glances up from her magazine, looks at him, looks over to Cas, looks back at Dean.
“So you get to decide when we’re past it?” Cas is totally still and calm, his hands folded in his lap. “Because it seems like that usually results in nothing getting resolved.”
“I don’t know,” says Sam, staring at the ground. “Maybe just that you have a tendency to fuck things up when they get too real. Especially with Cas.”
Cas just lifts Dean’s hand to his mouth, kisses his knuckles softly.
Dean barely peels his hand off his mouth, just enough to say:
Cas makes a tired, disappointed noise that saws Dean’s heart in half, and he thinks about getting back into bed for a few minutes, snuggling up to Cas again, getting warm and cozy. Falling back asleep. Being late for his first day of work. Okay, he probably shouldn’t. He ruffles Cas’s hair a little and stands. Immediately, Cas rolls over and pulls the blankets back over his head.
Turns out, Sam can do him for a lot. Sam’s essentially been running a black market job market for ex-hunters since the end of the end of the world, forging and falsifying identifying documents to beget more legal identifying documents, matching up Apocalypse World refugees to their real world paperwork where possible, using his dozens of cell phones to serve as a job reference in basically every field. His own mortgage is totally illegitimate, which makes Dean feel a little better about the whole situation.
DEAN and CASTIEL are having a drink together in the library - just hanging out, talking. The Apocalypse World portal comes up, as always.
“Hey, Cas,” he says, wrapping Cas up in a big hug. “Really good to see you, man.”
Well, thanks, man. I'm gonna get some shut-eye.
“Is he excited to see me?” Cas says.
Deans looks away from Cas’s eyes, focuses on the little tuft of hair right by his ear. He reaches to smooth it down. “And… And he forgives me?”
“Our son,” Dean says, turning his head to nuzzle into Cas’s hair. Cas turns his head too, his eyes big, looking warmly at Dean from centimeters away.
“Of course I got you a birthday present,” Dean says quietly, stepping forward and taking Cas’s hand firmly. “And I’m gonna fix her up real nice for you too.” He clears his throat. “Uh, at the garage. I hope.”
I don't understand.
“Worse things have happened,” Cas says, and before Dean can respond Cas is kissing him, holding him firm by the back of his head.
All Dean can think is how stupid he was not to notice this in front of him the whole time. Almost every day for twelve years Cas wore an approximation of this outfit—looking so handsome, so simultaneously orderly and disheveled, so vaguely goofy in a business casual way, like a kid dressed up in an adult’s clothes when really he was an ancient being wearing a molecule costume—and Dean didn’t kiss him, actively refused the idea that he might
“Even Gregory?”
“I, uh, I met a couple girls out there—”
No. What? Of course not.
“Yes sir,” he says again, and he considers interrogating the “sir” impulse, but decides against it. He knows well enough where it’s coming from.
“It’s just—” Dean says from between clenched teeth. “It’s just the idea.”
“Hey!” he says, somewhat breathlessly. “Everything okay?”
Sometimes Dean does get annoyed—when Cas tries to touch him a little too intimately in front of other people, not in a sex way but like they’re a couple. Which he guesses they are. But other people don’t have to know that. Sometimes it’s that they’re undercover and Cas, who still has some trouble lying to strangers even by admission, forgets that they’re supposed to be serious agents, not lovestruck teens. Other times it’s just that Dean feels like it’s nobody else’s business. That he worries the wrong person might see them holding hands or something. So at lunch, when Cas will sometimes reach his hand across the table and place it gently on top of Dean’s
Dean makes a sound somewhere between a groan and a sigh.
Weird?
,” Cas says, and he doesn’t have to finish the sentence. A silence. Then Cas says, “If you ever felt differently than that, you had years to tell me. You never did. I returned to Earth on a hope.”
Not so fast, dear. It's a living curse. It can survive without me, and I imagine you don't know how to break it.
Cas shakes his head, looking a little sheepish.
You dropped this.
Well, we don't know what we're dealing with here, so better safe than sorry, okay? Everybody's participating.
“What?” Cas tilts his head again. “Sorry for you?”
That's probably a good idea, but I want you to come in the Impala. I mean - well...
“Uh-uh,” he says. “You’re good. Both for me.” He shoots one back and sets the other to the side.
Give me the necklace back.
“You were very recently in the hospital,” says Cas, eyebrows raised slightly. “If you don’t recall, you were shot.”
“I love you,” he says, almost unintelligible. “Okay. I’m Cas. So I’m good.”
“That’s what lying’s all about,” says Dean. “You gotta find the true parts and roll with those. Every lie is just a truth in different clothes.” He wonders if maybe he’s revealing too much about his philosophy.
“Great fuckin’ song,” Dean shouts over the music. “Fuckin’ classic.”
“Two PBRs,” he says, holding up two fingers. He notices a piece of paper taped to the wall behind the bar that says, “WE DON’T PLAY SHANIA HERE — DON’T ASK.”
“Buddy, just wait until you have the job,” says Dean, laughing. “If I know anything about nonprofits—which, to be fair, I don’t—it’s all gonna be coffee runs and petty office drama. You’re gonna wish for the halcyon days of the Gas-N-Sip.”
“When did he—why? What?”
Cas looks around the room like he’s considering.
since Jack—well, since Jack. Every week, Jack would convince Cas to watch the new episode, and Dean would wander in about fifteen minutes in, leaning in the doorway, pretending not to care but asking so many questions—
“Oh my god,” Safiya says. “That is
“Get over here and do your line, then, Captain!” Gregory calls.
“I’m probably too old, though,” he says. He should have gone with Charlie when he had the chance. But what chance? There was never time.
“I think it should be nice,” Cas says, crossing his legs at the ankle, still looking pleased. “The Bunker wasn’t unlike a house, so I do have a frame of reference.”
What?
Eileen looks around the table again. Starts to laugh. Then Sam. Dean and Cas look at each other, Cas just a little red in the face now that he knows to be embarrassed, and Dean thinks,
“Yeah.” Dean scoffs. “Well. Me too.” He tries to think of something clever to say but nothing comes up, so he just says, “Still crazy that you’re down here fretting about the well-being of God.”
Castiel drops his hand. Opens his eyes. Looks at his reflection. He squints, tilts his head at himself. It feels like... Was he upset about something? He can't remember.
They last a decently long time at the party, all things considered—Dean thought he’d be itching to get out in the first thirty minutes. He strikes up a long conversation with Ren about their cosplay, how they’d designed it for their first ever Comic-Con and realizes that maybe, someday, he’d like to go.
BLACKOUT.
“Oh,” says Dean, “I, uh,” and Cas touches his forearm gently.
Right to the point. Okay.
There’s a sudden ruckus behind him—some gasping, some clapping—and without thinking Dean is whipping around, reaching for a gun he doesn’t currently have on his person, finding his plastic phaser instead. A totally useless rage wells up inside him, just for a second. He hasn’t carried a gun since they got back to Lawrence. He even stopped keeping one under his pillow over the summer, for Cas’s sake.
“All right, all right,” Dean says, grabbing Cas by the arm. “Get your little drink and come back out here.”
Hey, guys. Wanna hear about a case?
Dean puts a hand over one of Cas’s, craning his neck to look up and back at him. “You excited to finally be within reach of the long arm of the law?”
The next day Cas doesn’t try to bring it up again. They pretend it’s a normal day for hunting, but it’s not—not just because of this weird, unresolved tension, but because it’s the last day of the summer road trip. Tomorrow they’ll be back in Lawrence and Dean will be done hunting for the foreseeable future. It doesn’t sound possible.
“Alone?” Sam puts his hands out, palms up, elbows in, as if to say,
“What? What are you talking about?” Sam looks genuinely confused, then affronted. “What, you think I cast some spell and, like, genocided all the monsters?”
As soon as they stand and turn towards the door, they crack up, clutching at each other, trying to be quiet as they hurry inside. What the fuck is up with that? Do they really like the car or not?
“I live and I learn,” Cas repeats.
For a couple weeks, it stays like this: They research, they hunt, they come back to hotel rooms with two separate beds. They don’t kiss again, don’t talk about it. Don’t talk about much of anything besides the day-to-day. Dean picks up hustling pool again for cash. He’d only budgeted enough to support himself through the trip—“budgeted” meaning that Sam just gave him the money. He and Eileen have both managed to get solid jobs pretty quickly, Sam as a paralegal and Eileen commuting to teach at the Deaf school in Olathe. Dean isn’t sure how they both managed to go real-world so quickly. How they adjusted.
Thankfully, one of the guys shows up and saves Dean from having to explain his absolutely idiotic word choice.
“One of my favorite things about you is that you are never not making me uncomfortable,” says Dean. Cas squints, trying to figure out if that’s a compliment or not. “Look. You never push me to do anything. And besides, I like trying new stuff with you. It’s fine—it’s better than fine. Since day one with you, every day has been a fuckin’ adventure, and I don’t expect that to stop now just because we’re settling down.” He says it as a joke but suddenly it feels quite true. He can’t imagine a future without Cas in it, right here next to him—doesn’t even want to try. He feels settled. Maybe not in this house, hell, maybe not even in Kansas. But with Cas? Yes. It’s the only thing that makes sense, the only thing that has ever made sense, despite how little sense it actually makes. “And especially, you know, when I’m an asshole and I need to make it up to you.”
Consider Dean alarmed. He transfers the bacon over to a plate and heads to the doorway, crossing his arms, waiting for Cas to say something else, anything.
“Depends on who’s asking,” he says, and whoever it is on the other line laughs as Sam steps out of the Impala and gives Dean a quizzical nod. Dean has given up all but one of his cell phones to Sam’s little side gig, so if this is some hunter calling, he’s not sure how they got his number.
So, what, just having a little fun with us?
“What is that?”
It's simultaneously the happiest and the worst moment of Dean's life.
Kara is inconsolable in an ornate chair, with Team Free Will assembled awkwardly in front of her on a couch that's not built to fit three large adult men comfortably. Castiel hands her a tissue from a box he has in his lap. She's obviously been sobbing long enough that they realized they needed the tissues.
“It looks like they all require a college degree. I didn’t go to college.”
Dean has to admit: Cas is really killing the game here. He squeezes Cas’s hand once, a
Sam scribbles something down. “Okay,” he says, “you’re sure you don’t want Castiel? Might be a pain in the ass later if you change your mind.”
I still think she should visit. You deserve to have a nice time. Some crazy MILF action.
“Yeah, but when do we ever go to the hospital? We just patch shit up at home. And it’s not like we’re gettin’ beat up on the daily anymore.”
, Emily and Safiya whisper something to each other, giggle loudly, and then start chanting, “Kiss. Kiss. Kiss! Kiss!”
“Can’t wait to see you either, little bro.”
“Hey,” he shouts, and he barrels forward. “What’s going on here, ladies?”
“Your recovery is going as smoothly as it could,” the doctor says. “You’re very hearty. But your blood pressure is incredibly high and you’ll want to keep an eye on that. We can discuss more later. For now, just keep resting, and we’ll keep you on the pain medication.”
Yep. It's like - it seems related to a love spell, kind of, but it's cast by a third party on two others.
“Well,” Ren says after a long pause, rolling their head from side to side in a show of thoughtfulness, “next summer, you and me, road trip to Comic-Con. Cas is invited. And Claire too, if she wants.” They kick Dean’s foot lightly. “If you can fit us all in that ancient car.”
“Wait,” he says, looking up at Dean, one corner of his mouth turned up in a nervous smile. “How was your day?”
“Oh, I’m sorry.” Cas looks genuinely apologetic, like he’s done something wrong. Every day, Dean knows he has more and more to make up for—years and years of making Cas feel less-than, of never saying how he really felt, of not listening, of pretending he wasn’t listening when really he was.
Dean wants to say
Exactly. Leave it to me to figure out the loophole in a truth spell where I talk about sex so I don't have to talk about my feelings.
“Maybe we can call him up on the holidays.” Dean grins. “Then again, maybe he’ll be busy taking other calls. We can try for Arbor Day. And his birthday.”
“Thank you,” he mouths more than says, and he reaches out a hand to caress Dean’s knee.
“You’ll never have to know.”
I'll confer with the maintenance man.
“You realize you can’t just abandon this one on the side of the road when you get tired of it, right?” Dean shuts the laptop, puts it on the bed table. “You know, like you’ve done with literally every car you’ve ever had?” He switches off the lamp, slides down under the covers, slides a hand under Cas’s shirt and pulls him close.
