"The liquor is for patients," Watson chastised, then busied himself starting a fire in the parlor hearth.
"Are you implying they're afraid of me?" It seemed unlikely. He was no one, a clanless vampire without status or bloodline. He didn't even have thralls.
Watson rolled his eyes, there was nothing else to be done. “Oh, undoubtedly. And did it not occur to you that
"Of course I-” he began, then stopped. “No. I mean- I'm meant to watch you from afar," he reminded. "You are not supposed to know where I am, in order to keep us both safe."
Mycroft looked mildly surprised, which meant his shock must be great indeed. “Fifty years? Unlikely. The Diogenes would have found his victims long before now. He is surely lying to you; these creatures do little else.”
Holmes refused to be baited, though he had to admit his brother was as skilled as himself in the art of verbal warfare, on the rare occasion he could be bothered to participate. That he was doing so now spoke eloquently to his agitated mental state, and that meant Holmes would have to take care. There was a delicacy in dealing with his brother right now; he would need to forego the usual banter in favor of a more practical approach. Mycroft was immune to all emotional displays; heartfelt entreaties were received with clinical detachment and did not move him, even those presented by Holmes himself.  But he could be swayed by logic.
“I assume he relayed to you the conversation that took place between us this morning, thus there is no need for repetition; we shall move on. I have spent the day examining our historical records for the past one hundred years. There is a notable decrease in vampiric activity within the city starting approximately fifty years ago, supporting your assertion that you have been present in London and disposing of all challengers to your claim since then.”
Sorry to have missed the weekly update. In our defense, one half of the team is busy with Uni and the other half was busy trying to weather spring break with an overactive six year old attached to their leg.
acquiesce, but not willingly, and not for long. Does that conform with your knowledge of a man in grips of thrall?”
"I know you are lying," he said gently, "but I will not insist on the truth. You have been through a trial, and it is enough to know he was here. You understand why I could not ask in front of your husband, nor in his present state of mind would he have consented to a private interview."
Of course, Holmes came prepared for this. "I come here ta London lookin' fer work," he answered in a rough, smash-mouthed northern accent. "But thar's no work ta be had."
“Not since Langley,” Watson admitted, throwing himself into a chair, and Holmes’ face hardened in judgement.
“My God-” Watson breathed, sitting back heavily against the settee as the weight of Holmes’ words pressed him down like a paving stone.
At the end the vicar smiled pleasantly. “I believe you may work out well; go with Father Newman and he will look after you.”
"Doctor, actually," the man answered. "Doctor Jackson. I apologize for not introducing myself; this matter has me quite concerned."
Watson. Freedom from "Them", from their society, their games, their rules. Freedom even from your own sire. You will never feel indebted to one of them, their games mean nothing to you. You spit on their graves because you have never been given a reason to do otherwise. You never knew your sire, and thus your heart will never be moved by one of them suing for clemency in her name. She picked you out of a multitude of soldiers and killers and brave men following orders. And then she left you there to either live or die on your own.
Mycroft shook his head. “That is not the way thrall works, Doctor. A verbal command is irrefutable and absolute, until such a time as it is revoked by yourself, or the thrall fades. Thus, having told my brother to leave off, he should have done so immediately and without question. And he
. “The books at parliament document every heraldic crest in Europe going back centuries. If it is not there...”
. He didn’t want to try to anyway. He let Watson’s arm fall from his weakened grasp as his head lolled against the doctor’s side.
Watson laughed again, looked human again. “He surely does.”  But then he sobered, regarding Holmes with a solemn expression.
“A vampire laying claim to city typically means more death," Sturgerson spoke up, “for he brings his clan with him. Even for smaller clans, the numbers add up. To hold a city the size of London, the clan would have to be substantial.”
Watson felt something inside him shrivel, and said no more. Holmes had given him his answer, and it was a bitter pill indeed.
Jackson’s smile dropped, replaced by subtle annoyance. "I can be made to be much more dead than I am now. Surely you have heard of the ways to kill a vampire."
"Mmmm, are you familiar with Ophiocordyceps unilateralis? It was discovered about twenty years ago by a gentleman named Wallace."
It was an illuminating bit of information, and Holmes filed it carefully away. To Newman he offered only a cocky, crooked smile. "I have not lived so long in this profession by waiting to be saved," he countered, though unfortunately that was exactly what he must do, this time.
Mycroft's voice deepened as his concern grew. "You should be wary. This is not one of your trifling mysteries, Sherlock. It is an ancient evil from before the dawn of civilization; countless men have lost their lives to it. We have safe rooms here, and wards they cannot cross. Now we know they are coming, we shall stand watch at night. You will find no safer place in London than here. No one could bother you, not even that doctor."
"Indeed, thus the difficulty in solving this mystery." Holmes pressed his hands together neatly, gave them a pleasant smile. "Well, thank you again gentlemen. I will of course keep you informed of any future developments." He started to leave but turned back, "Ah, there is one other question. If it is not an imposition, what can you tell me of the unfortunate Mister Langley?"
“Holmes,” he said, wavering slightly. “Tonight is not-” but Holmes was already inside, speaking quickly.
The place he chose that morning was a deep, dark hole beneath a bridge he'd cleaned out and spruced up. A heavy stone no mortal man could move blocked the way in, half sunken into the soft earth. He sealed himself inside like a wretched thing, laid down and waited for the dawn to take his consciousness away.
deliberate, occurring organically between vampire and victim, for reasons unknown even your kind.” He sighed heavily, “It is also quite permanent.”
“I was not indoctrinated into the inner circle of the Diogenes until a few years ago. Before that I was a causal member, and had no inkling of its true purpose. I am afraid I never met Mister Stamford in an environment where we could speak freely. But given he was your friend, it seems likely that he did.”
Holmes offered him a look the verged on the edge of fondness. "My dear man your very existence is a feast of data; never presume you are anything less than fascinating."
Watson stared down at Holmes and marveled. Whatever he had been expecting, it had certainly not been
Holmes stood obligingly. "I had thought the meeting would require a good deal more explanation on my part and a good deal more disbelief on yours."
Jackson didn't flush; if anything he became paler, his eyes hard as flint. After a moment he sneered, lip curling back against glittering white teeth. "My appearance is hardly important. A man is going to try to take my life, Mr. Holmes. Are you going to do anything about that?"
Holmes nodded, unsurprised by this revelation. "Have you checked upon on her at all? I would take the first opportunity to do so."
Lestrade’s head spun around like an owl to regard Holmes in open disbelief. “Eh? He’s killed two men already, and nearly a third on his way out the door.”
"This is a tragedy," Lestrade sighed, removing his hat and threading the brim through his fingers as he glanced down at Lucy. "I do need to take her in, as well," he added softly.
He closed his eyes against a sudden spear of pain like a trephine being drilled into his cranium. “He- killed the priests, yes. Though that may be the least of the punishments they deserved. As for my present state...you’ve Deighton and Newman themselves to thank for that.”
“That fits with the timeline of events so far. It has been three months since indigents began disappearing off the streets around the church.”
"What kind indeed?" Watson asked softly, watching him go with a bemused smile. Then he too slipped away, retracting the path of Kramer's last night alive.
“Back to the matter at hand,” Mycroft continued, his eyes daring any man in the room to speak over him, and none of them taking up the challenge.  “You have held a claim on London for the past fifty years, and during that time there has been an almost unheard-of peace. We have encountered less than a dozen vampires since then; unprecedented for a city this size. For that, I suppose, the Diogenes must thank you."
Holmes blinked up at him a moment, then shook his head. “No, no, not the crest. I searched the books of heraldry...it was not there. No, what I have to say involves our dear friend Stamford.”
Holmes leaned forward slightly, that the rasp of his voice could be better heard. "Once, when I was seven, I smuggled a milk snake into my room. When it escaped and was discovered I blamed the cat."
“Surely your sins weigh heavily on your soul.” Deighton said, and Holmes couldn’t stop the breathless puff of air that escaped his lips in lieu of a laugh.
Holmes was talking. “-possible you made an error?” he asked, and Watson’s attention snapped like piano wire, left him blinking like a half-witted fool who’d just been asked to do sums.
He was still thinking it all over as he dropped down onto the window ledge, opening the casement Holmes had left unlocked for him. He would eventually have to start using the front door, but that required influencing Mrs. Hudson’s mind and he didn’t feel like it at the moment.
Father Deighton nodded, “Then all has been made right.” He turned back to Holmes. “If you would keep from sinning again, repent. God is merciful, and bestows forgiveness upon those who truly desire it. Pray daily for strength and he shall grant you perseverance."
“All right now, think of another object...but this time when you feel me start to push, push back. Try to keep that one thought away.”
“He has been here fifty years,” Holmes reminded him, “long before either of us were born. If he wished to take London, it would have been done before now.”
“The victim was a murderer; the kind below even your notice, brother. A degenerate wretch who will be mourned by no-one. Indeed, it will no doubt be decided London is better off without him. Is that sort of human filth considered when assessing the boundaries of your doctor’s moral code, or does the Prince of London take out his own trash?”
Watson shook his head. “No. I mean yes, I could, but I hesitate. I could perhaps manage another drop or two but that would not be terribly helpful beyond staving off infection. To achieve the miraculous would require enough blood to make you a thrall.“
Holmes set the papers down, looked up at his brother with a placid expression. “We already know a threat is lurking; we can take this as evidence vampires of a less congenial variety have finally arrived in the city. You’ve obviously informants among the Yard," he nodded meaningfully to the report, "what do they tell you?”
"I've noticed you're fond," the doctor replied, nodding towards Holmes' arm, the crook of his elbow marred with a number of needle marks, some old and some new.  "Your wounds are healing exceptionally well, no sign of infection. Could be considered a miracle, considering the condition you were found in."
"The last six hours or so?" he asked. "There is a contingency of course, but it would require me to tell the truth and I've become rather fond of subverting it these last few weeks." His higher mind reminded him he probably shouldn't be goading a vampire, but he was under pressure and out of time and both of those things were indirectly Watson's fault, so.
Holmes roused himself, licked at lips that were dry and cracked as old leather. "I've felt better," he croaked, voice sounding like something dredged up out of a gutter.
“Cocaine,” Holmes answered, unashamed because he saw no benefit in guilt. His vices were his own; he refused to apologize for them.
ensnaring him once again. "Holmes - I can't, I refuse! I've never turned anyone into a thrall, it wouldn't be right!"
The man gave a quick bob of his head. "Indeed sir. He was here earlier, but you’d yet to wake. I could fetch him, if you like."
Contrary bastard. "I am not gambling your well-being for the sake of scientific inquiry, Holmes. We'll think of something else."
The inner door opened and Mycroft came striding out, Sturgerson in tow. “We have matters to discuss,” he said promptly, and Holmes glanced over lazily.
Besides, while it was true that he hardly ever read people’s thoughts with intention – most of what he picked up was received passively from the world around him – he was not opposed to doing so with Holmes himself, and in fact had been harboring the secret desire to touch more of Holmes’ mind than the small, unsatisfying glimpse he had been allowed before.  The only stumbling block was that he’d never given anyone instruction in the art of mentalism before, and wasn’t certain how to go about it at all. So much of what he knew was intuitive that he was unsure if he would be able to properly explain it. But Watson suspected Holmes was a quick enough study when he wished to be, and they had a connection of sorts already, which should make things a good deal easier.
of her pain, because it was Montressor himself who had done that. But Holmes had his hand in it none the less.
"I know, my son," the vicar said wearily. "I'm so sorry I made you wait so long, it simply wasn't safe, and the last one died before he could confess-"
Holmes did not respond to that, turning his attention to the cadaver once more. “I found burnt cedar and sage in the alley where he fell, and these in his pockets,” From his coat he produced a few small items; a pinch of salt sewn into the corner of a small square of cotton, and a plain white crystal made of smokey quartz.
The two priests shared a tilted look. "He was a member of my congregation," the vicar said sadly. "A troubled man, with a troubled soul and his past sins wore heavily upon him. He joined the army at a young age, and while there saw and committed many horrors of which he could not forget. Father Newman and I did our best to help him, but..." He gave a trembling sigh and Newman stepped quickly forward, placing a steadying hand beneath his arm, and displaying a level of concern that had been absent in every other interaction Holmes had observed between them.
For a moment Holmes looked bleak and a shadow passed over his face, something that - on other men - might have been called fear. But then resolve hardened his features and he turned the lad ‘round by the shoulders, walking him briskly back to where the other boys waited in an expectant huddle, whispering back and forth in hushed voices. They pressed in around him as he approached and he crouched down, speaking quickly.
Watson didn’t pay him much notice, flashing him a doctor’s smile, warm and reassuring. He reached out with his preternatural senses and probed the man’s mind, finding it imminently open to suggestion. Perfect. “Everything is fine, constable,” he said pleasantly, tone disarming in its open friendliness. “Why don’t you
"Yes," she replied, extending a pale, thin arm for his examination. There was an obvious scar from frequent bloodletting at the crook of her elbow, where the vein became visible just under the surface of the skin. But it bore a single mark, one long incision rather than a puncture wound.
"I'm afraid I don't keep up on zoology," Watson replied a bit stiffly, tone turning frosty as a petulant feeling welled up inside him. "I focus on human medicine."
“-Passes through the Green on the northeast corner,” Mycroft continued with a sage nod, “and what is thrown in eventually finds its way to the Thames.”
Holmes was obviously thinking the same thing. "Well, it is comforting to know your assistance is available for twelve hours out of the day. I will endeavor to face peril only between the hours of sundown and sunup."
"Yes, I will," he promised. He kissed Holmes once more, trailing his fingers down the length of his spine.
"I'm not entirely sure that makes sense," Watson replied, and a moment later they were leaping up and out, Watson springing to the rooftop nimble as a dancer. He paused a moment, letting Holmes orient himself and then they were off, a dark blur against the London skyline as they raced across the city towards Pall Mall.
the bedridden horror shrieked, and Holmes knew enough from his own experience to recognize it as a command, and Order that even
It was well after dark when he knocked on the door of an inconspicuous house on a quiet street near Canvendish Square that doubled as an after-hours clinic and surgery. After a long stretch of silence the door opened, and the doctor smiled at him very wide.
"The fire? Oh it's ghastly," Mrs. Hudson said, shaking her head. "That young doctor was so nice the night he stopped by with your letter."
Newman shook his head. “I was on Mission work in the north part of the country when Langley died. By the time I returned, things had quieted. As I was not present at the time I was not interviewed, and as I had no sure evidence for my suspicions I did not believe I would be taken seriously. In any case, it seemed unchristian to cast such aspersions against a man’s character without being certain.”
"He seems to care for you, in his way,” Watson commented and the banal sentiment of the statement grated on Holmes’ already delicate nerves.  Of course Mycroft cared for him. Such an obvious, useless observation...and yet he found himself not as bothered by it as he might have been. There was probably a reason for that but Holmes was not feeling up to the task of self-reflection at the moment.
Holmes was breathless by the time Watson let him go, face flushed fever-bright and hands fluttering like crippled birds against the hard marble of Watson’s shoulders.
Watson blinked at the sudden change of conversation, then smiled. "I would very much like that as well."
"And the doctor's voice, it is pleasant to listen to?" he prompted, leading her neatly down the path of erroneous conclusion.
Holmes gave a small huff of almost laughter. "I do not discount the possibility, but thus far I have seen no evidence of its existence."
Holmes caught his wandering hand and brought it to his lips, "Go," he said, "I will see you tonight."
Lestrade looked him over with a skeptical eye. “I’d accuse you of jest but I know you better than that. I spoke to the surgeon; your leg was shattered, Holmes. Even if I had you carried up the steps, you’d be either in too much pain or on too much morphine to be of any use. It's been cleaned up anyway. We already know as what happened, so there wasn't much point in leaving a mess.”
"Is it?" Watson asked in earnest. "I had assumed the purpose of an investigation was to reveal the truth. But I am grateful nonetheless."
Once alone Holmes’ face crumpled in agony and he leaned his head against the back of settee, closing his eyes against the onslaught. His body screamed at him in an eloquent symphony of pain and he momentarily cursed his brother for setting him down so far away from the morphine bottle in his desk. A calculated move on Mycroft's part, no doubt.
"I suggested he take a walk, actually," Watson replied, and situated the chair next to Holmes’ bed, taking a seat.
It was Sunday, and the whole of the household at Mass when Holmes' dark figure sidled up to the kitchen door of the clergy house, made quick work of the lock and slipped inside. What he found was for the most part a typical manse - smaller than some but more than spacious enough for its purpose - and simple but comfortable arrangements; the reverend at least did not appear to concern himself with material gain.
Her lips pressed together so hard they went white, and she shook her head determinedly. "He couldn't have. He
"The papers there- ammonium hydroxide will suck the iron out of the ink, so long as they are not too burnt. Here-" and then was off, that familiar focus back. But this time when he took to his desk, he dragged Watson along with him.
She huffed at him in response, but tarried long enough he had time to make himself look presentably pitiable; his arm back in the sling and leg propped onto pillows.
This was not surprising. That Montressor would attempt to leave the city was nearly a foregone conclusion. He was a frightened, superstitious, somewhat cowardly man and such men did not  often linger after being questioned by detectives in regards to crimes they most definitely committed.  Even when the questions were as innocuous as Holmes' had been.
He followed his feet back to Baker Street but did not go inside; he already knew what he would find there. Instead he walked round to the side alley by the coal shed, kneeling with one knee pressed hard into the dirt. He looked, he observed, he was satisfied. That done he made a similar examination of the ground beneath his parlor window and, finding all as he expected it to be, left.
"It is forbidden in the common areas, where causal members who have not been indoctrinated into the coven often mingle with those of the inner circle. No need that way to worry over loose tongues. But here only senior members are allowed to pass, and writing notes to each other would swiftly become tedious. Even so, we do not make a great habit of it."
“What’s happened?” he asked, meeting Holmes halfway across the room. “Something is troubling you...”
But the detective, it seemed, had other ideas. “No, stop- put me down, you fool,” he rasped, and Watson couldn’t even find it in himself to be miffed at the insult, because it meant Holmes was feeling better already.
That made the inspector laugh outright, a jarring sound that bounced off the white-washed walls. But this was not the sort of place that encouraged merriment, and he sobered soon enough. "Well, I suppose you know him best."
“Holmes!” Watson cried, and shook him gently, but there was no response, no awareness in his blank, staring eyes. Watson reached out with his mind and encountered a solid wall of noise.  A moment later Sturgerson came striding out of the inner room, alerted by Watson’s voice.
Holmes stomach flipped over as Watson sprang out the window, his senses assaulted by the pungent night air, the various stenches that wafted in from all over London; the squalor and the refuse and the burning coal, all covered by the low, fetid stench of the river.  Watson took instantly to the rooftops, the air no more fresh but at least less malodorous.
“Oh, oh I am sorry-” he babbled, barring Holmes' path, "we are closing for the day – a family emergency, you understand...”
Holmes felt Watson’s temper flair like a distant thunder storm, but he mastered himself, corralling those monstrous instincts with the ease of a hundred years' practice.
"Nothing so severe as this, no. Despite what fanciful stories Stamford might have shared, I do not make a habit of walking blindly into certain danger."
He ignored the spectators and got to work. The man had been dead some hours already, skin pale and waxy, rigor mortis beginning to stiffen the limbs. The body was dry, but the roof beneath it wet. He turned the man’s head to see his face and recoiled in mild surprise.
Watson could hardly blush, but his mannerisms belied his discomfort. “Holmes-” he cautioned, glancing in mortification at Mycroft, who was far too used to his brother’s provocateur nature to react at all.
Fear immediately took hold of her frail frame, hands flying to her mouth. "Oh no! I don't have any idea! He was supposed to be at the shop all day!"
Holmes made no answer but gave the priest his full attention and the man spoke on, his voice growing fervent, eyes ablaze with a light other men might call zealotry. "Many a man comes to the church seeking forgiveness because he fears for his soul, fears the judgement that will be cast upon him, but such men as this are not truly willing to repent and atone for their sins. When a man seeks forgiveness out of fear alone a lie stains his heart, for his motives are impure. A servant of God such as myself or Father Deighton may forgive a sinner all other trespasses, but that one is beyond our reach. To truly accept the love of God and the forgiveness of Christ, a man must let go of all fear."
"Hmmm," Holmes said without comment. He finished the toast and left, neither aware nor concerned that he had been wearing the same clothes for three days straight.
kill it, if for no other reason than Watson had not wanted to answer that particular question when it was posed to him.
For a moment he sat unmoving, stunned and star dazed, drawing breaths he did not technically need but which calmed him none the less. Then he looked at Holmes.
you, brother. You make your days dangerous enough without involving yourself in the world of the supernatural. And you would have, had you known. Indeed, barely a month has passed and yet here you are; a vampire’s thrall already. How could you begrudge him either his secrecy or the lengths he went to in order to secure it? He was
He wasn’t much bothered by the fact. Walking was good for stimulating the mind, and there was much to consider.
Holmes smiled wryly with his eyes still closed. "Apologies, my dear Watson. I can control the direction of the thoughts, but not the flow. Observe-" he opened his eyes, turning his attention to Watson’s wardrobe.
“The you recall only half the conversation. The promise, Doctor, was that you never use your powers to influence my mind without my permission. In this instance, you have it.”
Holmes remained unmoved, pressing the tip of the letter opener against the pad of his finger, drawing a small pinprick of blood. "Calm yourself, sir. Father Newman said you had brought forth a charge of adultery against the doctor, before your other, more serious claims."
"Get a full night's sleep," Watson urged. "I will end my employment with the Yard tonight, and procure a body. I assume it is best to get this done sooner rather than later."
"Allow me to prove to you that there is nothing in the dark, and no reason to fear the night. The sun has just set; accompany me outside. Both of you."
It had been warm and humid that day in his memory, and his lace cravat had been terribly uncomfortable; over-starched and scratchy. But fashion had been different back then, too. So much had changed in a century... he turned, his reminiscing interrupted by the distant sound of Holmes' approach, the steady beat of the detective's tireless heart now a familiar sound that seemed to quicken his own sluggish pulse.
"Knee, shoulder, head in... roughly that order, I think. Is there water?" he asked suddenly, and Watson felt rather foolish to have not thought of that himself.
"There was a plan," Holmes conceded, "and it worked. I admit I should have liked it to work a little faster, but I am alive and that was the main objective."
He aged as slowly as his heart beat; which science would posit there being a correlation. The affliction, curse - whatever one called it, not causing death but rather slowing it, reducing the natural wear on mortal flesh to a fraction of its usual pace. The average human heart beat eighty times a minute. Watson’s beat only once. One heartbeat per minute. One minute per day...how long before that golden hair finally turned grey? Did they ever live to see themselves grow old, or were they dispatched before then?
"I apologize again for your flat," he heard himself say, and found that he quite meant it. He wanted Holmes to think well of him.
“How on earth do you know that?” Watson demanded, and Holmes cast him a sharp look blunted by fondness.
The worst part of it was that Holmes was right. Of course he was, the bastard. But it still didn’t sit well with him.
Holmes harrumphed at him. "If I am not to be noticed it hardly matters." But he did up the buttons anyway. Well, some of them.
“Of course we should not tell them,” he answered sternly, “not yet, certainly.  We do not yet have enough data to know how to proceed; to act in advance of the facts is folly.”
He waited for the man's answer, having maneuvered the three of them to reach this very moment, this scenario.
Holmes looked up at his brother and held his eyes. "Do not make me responsible for the death of yet another friend, brother." Then he left.
"Very good, sir" he replied with a quick and informal bow, taking his leave and the corner of Holmes' mouth quirked up at the constable's insistence on treating him as some sort of superior. It was a harmless quirk at least.
"Better some days than others," Holmes admitted with a lackadaisical shrug, and it was a good day so no one privy to his inner thoughts - as Watson had just been - would guess at the organized chaos raging behind those dark eyes. "Cocaine helps. So does morphine, and music. But nothing helps so well as work. When there are problems and puzzles...that is when my mind is most at peace. When I've something to
"A feint. You say he is clanless, but what if he is not? He has positioned himself quite well here as our 'ally'. He requires only a common enemy to engender trust. Once he has achieved that, he can begin to destroy us from within."
He had not properly prepared himself for the feelings that flooded through him at the sight of Sherlock Holmes laying in a hospital bed, his broken body held together with needle and thread and strips of cloth, stitched together like an urchin’s rag doll.
The dark mutterings died down as each man grudgingly accepted Mycroft’s reasoning, because when Mycroft deigned to speak only a fool would dismiss the words, and Mycroft Holmes did not employ foolish men.
“If the men who did this are dead, and their prisoner fled, how would I account for being bandaged and cared for?”
Holmes nodded in agreement. "Precisely. Him, and any constables unfortunate enough to be with him. Thus what would exposing you to the Yard achieve except more death? The end goal of any investigation is to prevent more crime, not exacerbate it."
“You were in my mind,” Holmes reminded him patiently. “There could be no misunderstanding. I knew what you did not want me to do, and I did it anyway, and was successful. If you gave me an order right now, I could refuse if I desired.”
Watson nodded, gaining far more understanding from Holmes’ mind than his words. Holmes’ control was impressive, but even he had limits, and there were times when that chaotic ocean of sensory input broke like a tsunami, threatening to drown him. In times like that, cutting himself off from the world and retreating inward was simply a matter of survival, and to do anything less was to court madness. To use it as a weapon was theoretically possible, but that was a sword that could cut both ways.
“Yes,” Watson acknowledged, reminded again of the sight of Holmes’ blood on the cellar floor, the bowl at the end of the trench half full of it. He’d understood immediately it had been intended to feed the pathetic creature in the attic, for why waste fresh blood?
"You want me to move into Baker Street?" he said dumbly, and it was such an odd thing to consider, as bizarre a suggestion as if someone recommended he try living on the moon.
It was perhaps no great surprise then that the vicar soon sent Newman on a three day Mission to the north, hinting to everyone that his brother of the cloth might be in better humor when he returned. During that time Holmes was left to himself more than was probably wise considering the penchant for larceny Holmes had built into Mr. Blevins' character, but Father Deighton kept quiet on the subject. Determined, it seemed, to treat him no differently than before.
The next day there was one more beggar huddled on the steps of Saint Cyprian's. It didn't mean much; the state of the empire was such as to ensure a steadily revolving cycle of ragged men, women and orphans hovering about the church, each spot abandoned and taken up again as the unfortunates of society met their various untimely and oft unpleasant ends.
The barest of smiles frosted the edges of Holmes’ mouth as things that had only been suspected were at last confirmed. “Then let me ask a less dangerous one: where did he live? Provide me with an address, and I’ll take my leave.”
"Plying my trade, nanny," he replied coolly, ignoring her fluttering as he glanced at the plain white envelope. "And securing your rent. Do be a dear and bring up some tea."
And then, too late, Watson realized the danger; the direction all those innocuous questions about thralls had been pointing. “Holmes, no!” he chastised. “You do not understand what you are asking! A thrall is a cruel thing to do to a man. You- you would have no free will; if I even suggested that perhaps you should or should not do something, you would consider my opinion as superior to your own. My will would supersede yours in all things...that would be terrible!”
Whatever Holmes had been expecting Jackson to say, it certainly wasn’t that. But he kept his face neutral and gave nothing away. "I'm sorry I cannot be of assistance to you, Doctor. I do hope your situation resolves itself in your favor. Goodnight."
"You are in pain," he observed, already moving toward the brandy decanter. "Did they give you any morphine?"
“The world of the vampirium contains many secrets,” he began. “Indeed, vampires are such bloodthirsty, treacherous and duplicitous creatures that secrecy is a simple matter of survival. No vampire reaches an advanced age who is not skilled in the art of keeping his own council...nor in discovering the weaknesses of others. It is therefore understood that any weakness which may be leveraged against one or even all vampires would be deeply buried indeed. It is that secret you seem to have so unwittingly discovered, and it is one that leaves yourselves, this coven and my personage in something of a predicament.”
Mycroft shook his head. "I have read of no such thing. There are many years of research here; not a single page speaks of thrall causing the vampire to become infatuated with his victim."
“I had always said he was the most remarkable of men,” Holmes murmured after a long moment, subtle irony shading his voice.
Mycroft was not entirely satisfied with that answer, but seemed to accept it, for the moment. "We may hope his life returns to being quiet again now that all of London believes him dead."
Holmes seemed deeply unconcerned. "Montressor will be behind bars within the next few days, and if I am correct in my hypothesis things will come to a head at the church very soon. Afterwards, you will be free to go your own way and resume your practice, provided you keep your hands clean. You should not need to feed before then."
"You know, I wish I could remember," he said with a mirthless laugh, shaking his head. "I think I was delirious at the time. I suppose she must have asked if I wished to live. I most certainly said yes."
Holmes gave Mycroft his full attention, because his brother would not sport about such things. Point in fact, Mycroft never sported about anything. Ever.
He could not say for certain whether or not these differences effected the taste of the blood directly, but they certainly effected the overall experience. Back before he had learned to feed without killing, he had chosen his victims based on the repulsiveness of their thoughts, culling the most foul and corrupted minds he could find from humanities’ throng. He had not enjoyed feeding from them, touching those diseased minds with his own.  It had made him feel like twice the monster to have their polluted blood coursing through his veins, sustained by evil.
the detective - not quickly anyway – but he could keep him alive, and relieve the worst of his agony. Already the bleeding from the larger wounds had slowed, and smaller ones stopped entirely. He was hardly well but he would survive.
“The- the graveyard... turn it up.” It was all the wisdom he had strength for, and then the darkness claimed him utterly.  He gave himself over without a fight.
Watson knew this, of course. He could feel it; the emotions and thoughts thrumming through Holmes like an echoing drum beat. "You're healing so well," he approved, fingers trailing over the skin of Holmes' shoulder as it knit itself together, millimetre by millimetre. And then he was pressing their lips together, because he could, and because Holmes’ wanted him to anyway.
"Yes," Holmes breathed, arching his neck in invitation and the pulse thrumming there begged for Watson’s teeth, “drink.” Neither of them seemed to remember that this was meant to be a minimum thrall, done to the barest amount necessary to get Holmes back on his feet.
"Aye, if ye think it ought ta be done,” Holmes replied a bit doubtfully and the reverend laughed like a broken recorder.
Mycroft nodded gravely. “The only logical conclusions to be drawn was that something had gone wrong...or the affliction my brother suffered was not thrall. I immediately contacted several other societies such as ours in various cities on the continent, and yesterday received via special courier correspondence from a slayer coven in Amsterdam, who’s leader is quite knowledgeable in the arcane lore surrounding vampires.”
injure; though it would have to be a prolonged exposure to inflict real damage," Holmes commented, steering the discussion down more interesting and less melancholy paths.
The man’s eyes met his with a crack, telegraphing shock for the span of a heartbeat, hand flexing towards his breast pocket before he mastered himself, curling his fingers into a fist and forcing his hand back to his side. He looked away, frustration in the line of his shoulders, the irascible set of his jaw. “Kramer believed in a lot of things.”
"Indeed." Watson stood again and left to wander about the house, making certain to leave a trail of bloody footprints down the stairs and to the door first.  As chance would have it there was a journal, thick sheets of vellum pressed between dark leather. Watson only glanced at it long enough to confirm it belonged to Father Deighton, then quickly returned to Holmes. He didn’t like leaving him alone.
Beside him Watson shuddered, his body curling towards Holmes like a question mark, one hand braced heavily against the settee. “Holmes,” he moaned out in a broken, breathless whisper, “stop, enough-”
Lestrade blustered, mustache flipping upward in rage. "I am only asking to ensure you are not hiding evidence from the law!" he thundered.
Holmes glanced at him. A younger man, but already with a wife and at least two small children at home. He smiled congenially, flawless bedside manner. He'd do well enough for himself in private practice, once age lent him a more distinguished air.
Watson considered, speaking slowly. “In of itself, very little, I think. But politics abound in the world of the undead, both their own and those of mortals. As I understand it many older vampires have a surprising amount of control over human affairs; those who lord over a city hold the title of ‘Prince’. I believe it’s a game of sorts they play against each other, maneuvering for control of cities, resources and empires, shaping human society in accordance to their whims and each vying for leverage and power against the others. In that respect, the church would be a powerful tool.”
Mycroft glanced at him in an offhand manner. “You do seem somewhat improved,” he admitted grudgingly.
“You didn’t think it pertinent, yes I know.” He sighed. “But what is done is done. In light of this information, I think it would be best for you to find new sleeping quarters as soon as possible."
Nonetheless Newman seemed pleased at Holmes’ competence and passed on his recommendation to the vicar and Holmes found himself in the employ of the church by lunchtime.
The vampire at least had the good sense to catch on quickly. "I meant for your own health," he amended lamely.
"You had just seen me. Ergo, I assume you have urgent news." Holmes peered at him expectantly, and Watson's discomfort grew.
"I'm sure there are many who would marvel upon their first meeting a vampire as well... before they saw the fangs, and considered the perils of closer acquaintance."
"And here I thought the point of the New Covenant was that no more blood would be spilled in his name,” Holmes countered, “And I rather think the diocese would agree with me."
"That is my concern as well. I have already told you this, brother, but I would much prefer that you stay here until this business is concluded. However long that may take," he added, casting a meaningful gaze Watson’s direction.
Watson laughed softly. “I can Order one or two, certainly. But not a whole group, and not permanently. They would certainly return once the command faded, and likely in greater number. It is a useful trick to escape immediate detection, but not a permanent solution by any means. How are you faring?"
Holmes was nearly purring, eyes heavy-lidded and body laying languid against his own and he looked shatteringly beautiful, a dusky-hued angel made flesh and blood.
"Narrows our list to whom, exactly?" Lestrade demanded, folding his arms. Across the table Watson idly finished up the autopsy, stuffing all of the man's parts back inside him for the undertaker to dispose of.
"Yes," Watson said with a resigned sigh, "and my advice to be cautious remains." He stood as well and walked Holmes to the door. "If you present yourself as a man of science who does not believe any of it, that may work to your advantage. They will certainly not think you are an agent of darkness at the least."
Holmes glanced at him and shrugged.  Holmes was always shrugging at him, it seemed. "When he next hires someone my Irregulars will inform me of it. I will then apprehend him, hopefully before he is able to kill again."
Holmes did not feel like guiding the doctor to gentle understanding. His mind was hurtling swift down those fast-flowing currents of logic and he needed Watson to keep up.  "Why would you think it unlikely, when you have just revealed to me that vampires so enjoy controlling the power dynamics of human society? It should have been your very first suspicion." And it would have been Holmes' too, if he'd known then what he knew now.
try to contact me here, and that will undoubtedly cause an incident. If you insist on my being here then let me speak to him first, that he will know to keep his distance."
“I don’t have to; ever since the thrall your emotions I can sense without effort, and with greater nuance than before.”
Jackson grinned widely as he watched Holmes think, enough that the glint of fangs became visible behind his pale lips. "I've got the teeth, though I suppose you would say I could be using a prosthetic, yes?"
"I hope you are right," Montressor said at length, squeezing her shoulder and looking at Holmes with desperate hope. "Will you bring this man to justice? He has done us great harm. You cannot imagine what I- what we have endured. The- the
“Of course,” he said, and looked about for a distraction, eyes falling on the vicar laying still and dead in a pool of his own blood. “To think
"It's alright!” he reassured quickly, “not enough to thrall or turn you, I wouldn’t allow that. But a little blood can heal minor wounds, prevent infection in larger ones, you will be perfectly well, I promise..." He was rambling, trying to both reassure and relay all important information at once.
Holmes found himself rather distracted by the buttons on Watson's shirt, and the promise of skin underneath. "Hmm, possibly. In either case, it hardly matters. What has befallen us is an unforeseen consequence, but hardly a terrible one. I am, as you say, enamored with you, and you with me. That is a better outcome than my being helpless. As to it's permanence, we shall simply have to wait and see." Nimble fingers danced their way over Watson's shirt, popping open buttons as they went.
It was a natural consequence of feeding that Watson be given a glimpse into the minds of those he drank from. He did not know why this should be, but it was an immutable fact of his strange existence, and one he seemed powerless to prevent. How much of a glimpse he received appeared dependent on several factors, including how deeply he drank and the people themselves; some minds were simply more “open” to him than others, and some more vivid and rich with color and nuance.
"More so," Holmes corrected. "If he did not know you were upstairs, I would be very much surprised."
Holmes paused, glancing at him in a way that made Watson feel lacking in some fundamental area; as though he suffered from a deficit of understanding. “Is it not obvious?”
It was an indeterminable amount of time later before the door scraped open again, lantern light blinding after the utter darkness of stone and mortar.
“Could it be a ruse?” Watson asked, though he did not sound hopeful and Holmes reached out, laying a comforting hand on the side of his arm.
“However,” Mycroft continued, “While the face of the Diogenes as a gentlemen’s club is a recent development, it has existed as a slayer’s coven for time immemorial, and it has kept careful records of all vampiric activity in London and its surrounding cities for well over a century. I will consult these records today and confirm the doctor’s claims. If it is true that he has kept the city free of their influence for the past fifty years, it will be noted. If proven right, I will need to speak with him. We shall need to formulate a plan."
“You are lucky it is not longer," he replied crisply. "The blood I gave you in the hospital has accelerated the healing.”
"Montressor did not stumble into Langley’s involvement on his own,” Holmes replied. “Newman’s scent is all over this business. There are unanswered questions within the church, and something dark brewing. This still of course leaves the question of where you will go once your current abode is torched."
"No." Holmes sat, and didn’t miss the predatory grace of the doctor's movements. Lithe and lethal, like a tiger. He wondered how anyone could mistake him for anything but an apex predator. But perhaps he wasn't bothering to hide it, tonight. No genial, mild-mannered doctor here. No cane he didn't need, facilitating a limp he didn't have, the result of a wound that didn't exist anymore.
We are aware that this version of Mycroft deviates from Stephen Fry's portrayal in the 2011 movie. Simply put,this Mycroft did not want to be that Mycroft and refused.
But Holmes' mind had run down all those avenues long ago, though it seemed unsporting to point it out. Instead he said, "Duly noted. My next few missives will likely not be in person."
An hour passed, and Holmes knew it had been an hour, though it felt as if only minutes had gone by. Then Sturgerson coughed discreetly behind them, and offered an apologetic smile. "I have to send for Mycroft now," he explained, though it was nowhere close to dawn.
"The church, yes... I thought for certain Newman was behind the order to kill me. But Langley and Kramer were both victims of Montressor, in the end."
"I don't know – a week or two perhaps, even for a low-level of influence. I- I'm not sure how much more blood it would take for that to happen; it can be subtle at first."
exist, yet did. Far from being terrified, Holmes found himself examining the doctor’s existence with the keen interest of a scientist on the verge of some monumental discovery. Everything about John Watson was a mystery, a fascination that had forced him to rethink all he believed he once knew about the laws of science, nature and man.
Lestrade bristled like a bulldog, shoulders hunching up beneath his uniform. “The man’s only just started, it’s hard enough finding a competent sawbones willing to work the night shift for Yard pay; I’m not about to let you barge in and scare him off without a damn good reason. What it is you think he can tell you that you can’t get lookin’ at the body?”
“Mister Blevins was not allowed in house proper,” Newman said in a frosted tone, the first emotion he'd shown since Holmes arrived. “He broke in once in an attempt to rob the place. He was caught, and Father Deighton forgave him. But after that he was refused admittance until he had properly repented.”
"Mmmm," Holmes said, and the next moment had his ear pressed to the doctor’s chest, listening for the beat of his heart. He thought he would like to bring Jackson upstairs, where he was better equipped to examine him...
It was in the papers!" She gave a small giggle and pulled back, pleased as any child to share her secret wisdom.
Holmes shook himself as if waking from a dream and fixed Watson with a pleasantly false smile. "Nothing of importance to the moment." He reached to his pocket for a pipe that wasn't there and made a face, allowing his hand to fall to his lap again. "Now then," he began, "We must to the business at hand. You are in danger here. Montressor wants you dead; at the very least, he wants you found out and he has already killed a man to be rid of you. I may have convinced him you are only human, I do not know, but no one will convince him you are not a threat. It is only a matter of time - possibly a very short time - before he grows impatient with the Yard's lack of progress and points them in your direction. Even if all they wish to do is interview you...you know what will happen."
His breath stuttered, shock pouring through him like he'd been thrown in an ice bath. The good doctor had indeed failed to mention this critical information, and Holmes bit back a curse, casting silent aspersions against Watson's family tree all the way back to the founders. He was less successful at keeping the surprise from his face; not with so much of his concentration already allocated to fighting off pain and nausea.
The Diogenes club at Pall Mall was one of the most exclusive and peculiar clubs in all of London. Far from being a place for conversation and socializing, it's members were forbidden to speak to each other at all, and passed the time in what could only be described as ‘companionable solitude’, each busying himself with his own thoughts and hobbies while staunchly ignoring his fellow constituents, who returned the favor with zealous equanimity. Its membership had long boasted to be comprised of some of the most unsocial and misanthropic men to be found in the whole of the city.
"Holmes!" he nearly sobbed, voice breaking and he slipped a cold hand into his trousers, fingers wrapping around him as he pulled him in for another kiss. “I’m sorry,” he said between kisses, “I can’t- this is all I can do for you.”
He crossed to the window and examined the glass, unsurprised to find a lack of fingerprints. Fingerprints required oil from the skin to adhere to a surface. If one were wearing gloves - or the skin in question had no oil - there would be no transference. There was however a bit of dirt on the windowsill and upon the floor inside the room, but nothing else. No rope fibers, nor marks where a grapple hook might have taken hold.
"That is exactly what I believe he did," Holmes interjected calmly. "A bright light, soothing music, a pleasant voice and a touch of chloroform to addle the senses. I ascribe more of a charlatan to the doctor than the supernatural."
apologize, you would do better credit to the words if you saved them until after the thrall has ended, and I am myself again.”
Holmes sighed. “That is a far more complicated question than you realize. This case has many threads. Even woven together, I am not certain they contain the whole truth.”
He waited until he heard her leave again, her scent fading from the room then stepped away from the wall, coming back to Holmes' side and noting the detective’s eyes had already gone soft and unfocused from the drug. He felt a pang of something that might have been jealousy that someone else was caring for Holmes, easing his pain and making him whole and that - oh that was a dangerous, dangerous feeling and he tried to lock it away.
"I was going to suggest you leave before dawn," Watson replied. "That would give you a few hours to recover, with time to slip away before being noticed." He glanced at Holmes, keeping watch over his recovery. "It's the least I can do..." his voice trailed off, remembering the taste of Holmes' blood in his mouth, the mad rush of thoughts from his mind. "Thank you," he added softly a moment later. "That was not something most men would consider doing voluntarily."
"No," he replied, and Holmes heard the loneliness of years echo in his voice. "When you are bleeding to death after sunset on a cold battlefield you do not ask the angel in white who appears before you if she is saving your soul or sealing a covenant with the devil."
Mycroft held a glass out to him. “You should have a drink,” he advised, and the strangeness of Mycroft of all people encouraging him to partake any sort of medicament – even on as mundane as alcohol – made him reach for the glass.
Watson watched him avidly, thoroughly invested and Holmes felt gratification spark in his chest like a warm ember. The rapt attention of men he was used to; this was something different, something
In that respect, Holmes had put another's happiness above his own. Completely, and for the rest of his life.
“He is not part of any clan,” Holmes assured him. “He never even knew his sire. He learned to survive on his own, and on his own he has been for a very long time. Indeed, he is the proverbial lone wolf, and London is his home. He has killed every vampire who has stepped foot within it for the last fifty years.”
"Of course I haven't," she assured Holmes, putting a hand on her husband's arm. "I believe my husband, that the doctor was doing something terrible; I have no desire to go back."
"I know. You were dying - I just... did what I had to do. And now I have to get you out of here,” he said, preparing to take Holmes in his arms once more. Baker Street was both close and convenient, but what Holmes truly needed was a hospital.
“What sort of secrets?” he asked suspiciously, gaze wandering again to the leather straps on the bed, a dim sort of understanding beginning to foment  in his eyes.
"If I wished him dead, I'd have no compunctions against killing him in front of you," Mycroft answered to his unspoken fear as he ushered him through a long, windowless hallway and up a staircase.
For a long time Watson made no reply, staring at the body between them as though it were a divination pool that he might unravel the secrets of if only he gazed into it long enough. Finally he looked up.
"None that comes to mind. Though if you let me go, I shall hobble about a bit and give it some thought. I'll be sure to keep you informed."
“And you have a better idea, I suppose?” Watson challenged, thoroughly exasperated but of course that was a statement born at the very height of stupidity. Were he not so very rattled, he would have known better than to issue such a challenge.
Montressor was already pacing. "I saw him, I saw him," he muttered, fingers twisting together in agitation. "I went there, one night- I - I'd had business in Cavendish, you see, and she was at his practice, her weekly appointment...I thought we would share a ride home. I had no suspicions- none at all-" He turned, staring at Holmes with eyes that bordered on desperate. "The doctor did not expect- he didn't see me, but I saw him! I
It wasn’t that he wasn't interested - fascinated even. But there was something about Watson that unsettled him, something beyond the obvious fact that the man shouldn't exist. Oh, their paths would likely cross again; Holmes fully admitted his inability to turn away from a mystery. But this mystery in particular
Holmes hesitated, and being in his mind Watson felt his trepidation. This was not an aspect of himself he cared to share.
"Fleeing? Why sir?" the constable asked. To his credit, he'd already started walking towards Montressor's door.
“And how many of them did you introduce yourself to using the honorific?” he asked dryly, nodding in grim satisfaction as Watson caught his meaning almost at once. “They know a rogue Prince exists in London, but they do not know
The headline was predictably sensational. An artist's interpretation of a burning house filled a whole quarter of the page and the accompanying article detailed the gruesome murder of the well-respected local physician, Doctor Jackson. The confessed murderer, James Montressor, was a confirmed lunatic whose obvious madness was not likely to spare him the rope. Among other things, it was speculated that "dangerous excursions into the occult" were to blame for the man's unhinged mind.
He left the shop and took up watch across the street, slouched up against a light post with a newspaper spread between his hands, the breath from the London crowd hanging in the air.
“England has never acknowledged sovereign Irish nobility,” Mycroft agreed, “or clan rule. Many clans have in the past made their own coat of arms in defiance of the crown, but they were never recognized in any official capacity.”
"The meeting will not take place here. I am sorry brother, I will not risk it. I know what you would do for my sake; breaking your word is the least of it."
The body lay face down on the cobblestones, one arm outstretched toward the street in a futile plea for deliverance. The brick walls of the narrow alley were stained with arterial spray, blood that had appeared black in the moonlight now a deep rust color in the flickering light of the oil lamp. Beneath the dead man the sticky remains of a puddle seeped and trickled its way through the cobbles toward the main road, filling Holmes' nose with the coppery scent of blood. A crude chalk circle had been drawn around the body, criss-crossed with strange symbols and lines. It was only partially intact, the man’s blood spilling over and obscuring the markings. Next to him lay three dried sprigs of sage.
“Then you had best get started,” Mycroft answered, deeply unsympathetic and a faint smile touched Holmes' lips.
Watson could see why that would be so. To have such a connection with a mortal would be a fatal weakness, and one no doubt eagerly exploited. Assuming, of course, one planned on staying mortal...he looked up at Mycroft, a dim understanding starting to take shape in his mind.
“Not entirely solitary. From what I understand they usually form clans; united by their sire’s blood.”
