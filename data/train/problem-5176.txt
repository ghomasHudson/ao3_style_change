Tony took a shuddered breath, wiping the moisture from under his eyes before he starts crying here and now; turning his eyes to Harley, he sniffed when he saw that the boy was asleep in his chair, his head pillowed by his arms. "I… I can't bring him back, Betty…." Tony said going to the barista and telling her about packing his order to go, ignoring the disbelieving noises that Betty let out in her rage. "I am taking him home, I am sorry, but I can't bring him back," Tony stated with a strong voice, clicking the phone shut and ignoring Betty's calls of his name.
"That's all I need to hear…" Steve grin at the Omega, who squeezed his hand one last time before letting go as they both heard Peter whine a little, and sit up rubbing his eyes as he woke up slowly and raise his one of his hands wanting to be carried. Tony's lips twitch in a smile as he raised his baby so he can sit in his lap, which only successes in making the pup purr loudly like a cat and snuggle in Tony's chest smiling happily as he saw Steve. Tony can't help but thinks about Steve's words, his mind repeating the words over and over again which made the Omega held his pup tightly to get a little comfort.
"Why does it matter? Steve would appreciate it either way." Rhodey said after he finally gathered himself enough to stop the giggles that wanted to leave him; count on Tony to surprise him with his unexpected questions and actions. "Anyway, I came here to get you; Serpentine nearly killed everyone trying to get them seated so the ceremony would start soon," Rhodey stated, only to tilt his head when the music starts playing.
It was a few minutes later that the camera that was put in front of Steve started recording and Steve had to swallow his fear as he instructed Tony to never give the codes or anything or what the two of them planned will be over, Steve's heart pounded in his chest as he finally dared to attack the Alpha in front of him.
"Mommy, you're back!" The pup squealed and Bucky had to hold his gasp taking in the boy that refused to let go of the Omega, the boy was a little on the pale side and was a small one too, but he sure as hell has Stevie's nose and face shape, the only thing different was his eye color, and the cap hides his face that he couldn't see his hair.
Steve took his glass of water and took a sip from it, looking at the table deep in thought before he looked at the man with a tired look on his face, letting out a sigh when his eyes fell on Tony's pleading face. "You sound so certain that we could solve everything and make it alright…" Steve said as his eyes fell on his glass and he starts swirling the water inside. "Just so that you remember, this is a one chance offer only… you do something wrong or make Peter sad, we are over…" Steve said after he took another sip of his glass and put it down, looking at Tony who had a determined look on his face…
"Tony… what do you mean? How did you get this information?" Peggy smart and sharp, it was easy for her to snap out of her shock, and asked him; she was already in her Captain America posture, preparing to make a backup plan after a backup plan with the information Tony was going to share.
Tony pursed his lips, taking the jacket out of the hanger, staring at it with curiosity, pondering what captured his attention, thinking that it was nothing but his overactive mind playing with him; that was until he decided to search the pockets, assuming that Steve may have left behind something inside one of the pockets and that was the reason he was distracted.
"Calm down, Rhodey-bear, nothing happens I was just clumsy." Tony laughed, hoping that Rhodey won't catch on how the laugh was strained and shaky; some part of Tony refused to not only admit the truth but refuse what he felt. "Look what I found though!" Tony grinned changing the direction of the conversation toward the sliding door Tony found, hoping that Rhodey won't start asking questions; Tony really doesn't want to deal with that at this moment.
"What? Tony I will never force you to do something like this? Do you have such a little faith in me?" Howard asked looking at his son with a shocked look, which made Tony look at Howard for a long time.
…" Steve was so sure that the last word, Howard said in a whisper, but somehow Steve was able to hear it as clear as if Howard was shouting it in his ear, and Howard seemed to notice his mistake, especially when Steve's eyebrows twitched in anger. "Anyway, while you spent three days recovering, my foolish son spent that time crying and sniffling like a babe, refusing to leave your side… I expect you to have a talk with him about responsibilities later, I can't have my own son turning this useless every time something happens to you." Howard stated hotly, raising his nose in the air and turned to leave the room, causing Steve to roll his eyes at the overdramatic way Howard deal with the situation.
"Steve please, calm down, Tony couldn't come because the city was under attack, please." Bucky said after he closed the door looking at Steve who was glaring daggers at him angry at Bucky for daring to interrupt him, something that Bucky knew he will receive the cold shoulder for, for the next three weeks.
"P-please don't, please let go!" Tony cried out, only to let out a hysterical scream when he felt the knife coming near his belly and giving him a small cut, which did nothing but caused Tony to cry uncontrollably letting out screams and sobs as he tried to push the bigger man off him.
Tony was saved from answering by his mother calling his name, he ends up giving a halfhearted excuse to get rid of the child and the woman, he tried to ignore the pup's sad look when the Alpha rushed away, feeling like the lowest of the low when the woman lowered herself to wipe the boy's teary eyes and whisper something in his ears, Tony had realized the pup was smart when he told his aunt about what the gala is about, so Tony knew that the boy thinks that he did something wrong because the Alpha starts acting weird when he heard his name…
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, fluffiest fluff, maybe a little crying, Peter is cute, and Steve being protective AF! And who knows what? All reviews are appreciated.
Tony sang under his breath, an amused smile playing on his lips as he turned around deciding that he will buy a few candy bars just to be on the safe side. "Watch out!" Someone called out, causing Tony to turn, only to groan when someone slammed into him, a small someone at that.
Peter let out a sob as he clutched the Omega's shirt tightly; taking in big breaths as he tried to calm himself down, but Tony could feel that it wasn't working. "B-bad man… Papa, bad man… used his scary voice…" Peter let out a whimper as he said those words, and the tears that clouded Tony's eyes start falling as the Omega tried to desperately shake his head.
"You look… happy." Bucky stated after he raised his eyes from the book he was reading to take Steve in, giving a smile as he saw Steve skip to the living room to look around. Steve was nearly vibrating in his place, the huge smile refusing to leave Steve's face as happiness continued to run through him. Steve was defiantly walking on cloud nine, the happiness the note Tony left for him in his car was still running inside him like mad.
"No, Mama… don't go!" Peter said as tears start running down his face which made Tony tear up and that and pull the pup into his embrace and cooed to him, which made the pup sniff at that and hide his face in Tony's neck.
"Then let's cut to the chess, tell me, what the hell do you want me to do?" Tony asked, already closing his eyes, wondering how huge his headache was going to be when he made his escape from this hellhole, Steve was probably going to bother him when he returns home. Curse Fury, curse S.H.I.E.L.D., curse the world and every stupid person in it, why him? Why? Wouldn't it be easier if Rogers wasn't an Addams or if Bucky managed to catch his attention? It was all Tony's rotten luck and his knack for getting in trouble. Seriously, what did Tony do in his past life to gain such torture? Stealing a grain of rice from a witch?
"Snap, Pietro, look what you did!" A voice of a girl greeted Tony, making the Omega raise his head to find a girl, with long dark hair, glaring at the boy who was cowering behind Tony, which was a little shocking, to be honest. But from the look at those two, Tony can state that the two of them were siblings.
Taking several deep breaths, Tony tried to calm himself down before he did something rash like firing his repulsors in Howard's face, that won't do. After managing to calm down a little, Tony managed to order his armor to disassemble, leaving him in one of his fancy suits as he entered the house, his eyes narrowing as he took the villa, his mouth twitching down when he saw the pictures of his father and mother hanging around, happiness surrounding them in every picture… what really made Tony's blood boil though, is that there was not even a single picture of him anywhere, even a small one, nothing, nada, yadda, null.
By the way, I publish another story of my own, with the name 'Stardust', go check it out and tell me what you think!!
"You made them for him using your Shield, and I'm part of him… I really want my ring back Steven." Tony stated with a happy smile. Four months later the two of them get married, and not surprisingly, a year later they had a baby together. At first, Steven was unhappy with the name that Tony chooses which was surprising 'Morgan'. "Don't you think it's only fair to give someone a second chance?" after hearing Tony says these words to him, Steven finally agreed to the name.
Tony pressed his lips tightly as he took in the baby that continued to squirm and whimper and make a nuisance out of itself; Tony couldn't help but wonder what kind of asshole would throw a baby away in the dumpster when the baby was no more than a month or so (Well that's the best estimate Tony can give, especially with how small the baby was) Rolling his eyes, Tony huffed, planning on leaving this alley and the baby with it; this was not his problem, Tony doesn't do babies, especially normal babies, even coming near them was a red line. The best thing Tony can give that thing was to call child protection after leaving the alley, the last act of goodwill before returning to his search for the trash that was Zemo.
"For now, let's take him to rest, we can decide how to help him when he wakes up." Peggy instructs after a while of tense silence, which made everyone nod their heads, trying not to feel as awkward as they did after Thor's explanation…
Jarvis' monotone voice made Tony growl as he looked up at the ceiling, wondering how his A.I. would dare betray him like that. Was he on Rogers' side? "Are you on his side? Did he infiltrate you? Are you betraying me?" Tony snapped as he stood up from his chair, growling at the ceiling, and only got a tired sigh in return. Deep down Tony wondered how his A.I. turned out to be like that; sassy and so done with Tony's shit at the same time.
"The what-ifs and doubt will destroy any relationship that will blossom between those two, and by doing that, the dark end will come, the spell will wear off after a little bit of time, to show the true intention and hidden faces behind… and when that happens, Steven will be there to stop that fight before it started… and it was also to teach that foolish martyr to man up and confess." Frigga's last words got a chuckle from Loki as he shook his head and look at the pair that kissed.

/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of sadness, a little bit of violence, Tony being mean, and poor Steve! All reviews are appreciated.
not the one who destroyed it years ago?" The woman asked in a false innocent, and Steven's heart dropped at her words, especially when she leans toward him to stare in his eyes. "Tell me, what does it feel like to be the reason of our people being killed?" The woman spat, her words attracting the attention of James who frown at the Alpha who was looking at his mother strangely which made the pup let out a hiss, causing the woman to snort at that and roll her eyes. "I am sure if you followed the river in the forest you will reach what left of your husband's pleasant surprise." The woman then turned around and start walking away, ignoring Steven who was too frozen in his place to react.
"Don't." James hissed as he took a step toward Tony, making the shorter Alpha take one back. "Don't ever call me by that name, not you nor is your family allowed to call me by that name, not after what you did!" James snapped causing Tony to bite the inside of his cheek to stop himself from saying something that he will regret.
"Let me get this straight… you idiotically agreed to go out on a date with an Addams, and didn't foresee doing some research on the Addams traditions before agreeing on the second date?" Rhodey summed everything up as he started massaging his forehead and letting out a pained groan that informed Tony he really fucked this up. "What am I going to do with you, Tony? Everyone knows that once an Addams get married you are with them till death do you part, and no one, not Satan himself can stop an Addams when they are after something, and to top it all you are marrying The Original Captain America/The Scariest Assassin of All The Winter Soldier?" Rhodey let out a pained noise when Tony nodded his head, looking from side to side like he was trying to find somewhere to get out of this scary nightmare that doesn't seem to end.
"Tony listens to me, your pup is fine, he is sleeping in the other room, your baby is fine." Steve crooned making Tony look at Steve with disbelieve.
Hearing that, hearing Steve calling his name, remembering his name, made Tony smile as the call disconnected and he let go of the missile closing his eyes, Steve remember him… the last thing he remembered before closing his eyes, was him praying to God to give him another chance, just another chance to see Steve… to tell the Omega that he still loves him after all these years, after all the pain and hurt and betrayal, he still loves the small Omega who captured his fragile heart.
"Wha… happen…" Peter mumbled, rubbing his face on Steve's shoulder trying to wipe the sleep away from his eyes, his arms holding tightly to Steve's neck as he looked around the place, snuggling into Steve's neck and letting out a whine when the alarms continued to blare loudly.
Chaos broke once again, but this time it was between the Avengers and the Scarlet Witch; Steve could only watch in mute horror when the person behind Wanda came to light, taking their hood off to reveal Nebula, one of Thanos children… Thanos was here… Thanos knew Steve was here, he knew Steve was here and was planning on kidnapping him and hurting his family.
"Well, Mr. Rogers it seems that the child has imprinted on you, which I considered strange, coming from the environment he was in…" The doctor said, making silence fall on the group.
“Well, I don’t know about getting Fury to approve their visit, that one is all on Mrs. Carter, you may not know it yet, but if you wanted something to be done, ask Mrs. Carter and her husband, they are responsible for the town, she is kinda the mayor.” Natasha pointed out, leading Tony’s eyes to widen, which caused Natasha to laugh in delight. “Don’t worry I can offer to bring them here with me, I have to go to the next town in a few days with Clint, to visit his sister Laura.” Tony grin joyfully, feeling excited at being able to see his best friends sooner than he expected; it ended with him bringing Natasha in a tight hug, causing her to squeal in embarrassment.
Today was such a day that Harley needed a little time alone; Harley didn't even notice Lila coming to convince him to play with how occupied his mind was which made his friend roll her eyes before going back to Peter and Cooper and jumping her brother to strangle him. Harley hummed as he tilted his head a little, his eyes were tracing every movement taking place on the street, counting the flowers in each lawn, tracing the movement of pet cats and dogs, and counting the leaves that fell from the tree and were blown over by the wind.
"You don't understand if I don't… we… we will lose…" Tony whispered these words, causing Steve to let out a sigh and close his eyes. Steve knows that Tony was scared, even if the inventor was trying to hide it, and it's within Tony's right to fear for his son and family's safety, but if Tony went through the path he chooses, there won't be any family left for him to worry about them.
The rest of the honeymoon went great! Tony and Steve spent most of their time going to haunted places and terrifying people half to death, and trying interesting food; not that surprising after they destroyed people's lives and sanity, the two of them would go to their room to enjoy their night together, which were passionate and full of moans and sighs, and creepy howls. Who knew that with all of Steve's scariness and dominating nature he would make a good submissive top? Surely not Tony, but that didn't mean he didn't enjoy himself chaining Steve and torturing him to near madness before relieving them both of their torture.
“Nothing,” Steve answered, and his answer probably didn’t satisfy the man, for he frowned at him. “I’m just a kid from Brooklyn.” Steve raised his eyebrow at Howard, the Alpha seemed lost in thoughts at his answer, a frown taking over his face before it smoothes out and his face turned into the perfect blank mask, and Steve sower if Howard was going to pull something as he did a month ago or even eleven and half years ago, he will break his nose this time without hope for even surgery to sit it right.
"So what?" Tony grunt in boredom, wondering about the poor sandwich he left in his office when Fury barge into his safe place and dragged him into S.H.I.E.L.D. he hopes that the sandwich survived the trip and that at least Pepper found it and gave it to someone because Tony is sure as hell is not going to eat a dry sandwich now. "I am sure that it is going to cool off in a week or two, it's not like it didn't happen before when people knew about me being Iron Man," Tony stated, stiffening a yawn that was about to escape him, it seems like he was going to return home earlier than usual today, straight to the bed.
Everyone watched in fascination and horror how the Beta pales so much that he resembled a pale sheet of paper. "Did… did Tony knows about this?" Rhodey asked with a shaky voice and he cursed when Pepper nods her head… "Oh, God… this is bad, this is so bad, and Tony is going to kill him." Rhodey hides his mouth behind his hand thinking.
Steven took a few shaky breaths as he leaned on the rough barks, looking at the sky that was covered by branches and leaves that were letting a few beams of lights through, making the Omega close his eyes for a second as he breathes through his nose scrunching his eyebrows at the disgusting taste that stayed in his mouth wondering if he had time to go and get a sip of water from the well not that far from the house.
"What the fuck is wrong with you? Let him go!" Steve had screamed as he tried to pull one of the doctors away only for the huge Beta to push him aside.
The silence that blanket the place after Steve left was suffocating; Tony could do nothing but look up at James who was glaring at him with disgust and hate shining in his eyes. "Like father like son; don't you think big brother?" James asked with a mocking tone, and Tony tried hard not to bristle at the way his brother was talking to him, James always hated them, all of the Stark family, so it was no surprise that he will sneer and mock him at him when they were alone. "Does that scene remind you of anything? Because it sure as hell does; remember when your father did the same thing to my mother? Not even giving her the respect of solving the problem in the secrecy of their own bedroom, instead, he screamed at her in front of Stane and all the servants, do you remember what happened after that big brother?" James asked in a faux innocent voice as he tilted his head, his words causing Tony to grit his teeth, trying to shove the unpleasant memories away.
Edith said which made Steven pause and touch his glasses before putting them on his face gently. "Do as you see fit…" Steven said gently which made the AI chirp and seconds later the suit materialized on Steven's body which made the older man look at his body with an eyebrow-raising. "That's a handy trick." Steven ends up saying as he looked at his body in the mirror, he looked just like he did when he fought in 'The End' it is funny how he didn't change a bit.
Opening the door, Tony was greeted with the sight of Natasha and police chief Fury, forcing him to blink at the both of them. “Sorry to wake you up early, lad.” Fury said, and Tony wanted so much to ask them what this was about. Why are they here? He wanted to ask them if the reason they were here was about last night if they learned what happened. “… We received a number of complaints from the neighbors living here, apparently a group of teenagers decided it will be fun to go and terrorize the tenants living near you. Did anything happen last night? Strange noises you heard? Breaking in? Any unusual activity you noticed?” Fury asked, and Tony couldn’t help but remember last night’s events, doubting what happened to him was just a joke from the local kids who decided and try to play Halloween.
"…Like the piece of shit that you are, did he take the money or not? Answer me!" The team heard Tony's growl as they finally reached the room the screaming was coming from, the team wince as the saw the room, furniture was thrown around the place broken in pieces, the huge hole in the ceiling followed by smaller ones from Iron Man's repulsors, and there was in the middle of the mess, Howard Stark who was cowering behind his mate who was trying to calm Tony, but the Alpha was having none of that as he tried to sidestep his mother and attack the older Alpha.
Harley knew he should have stayed with Mr. Tony when the man told him to distract Peter, he knew he should have pulled Mr. Tony with him and ignore the harsh looks the woman was sending, he knew he shouldn't have left Mr. Tony alone. The thing was, Harley was scared and as soon as Mr. Tony gave him the permission to leave, he took it and run toward the house hoping that Mr. Clint would help and save Mr. Tony from the scary woman outside.
"Silly old man… it's enough for me if you loved me for the rest of my life." Tony said looking at his wrinkly hand that was held gentle between Steve's bigger ones, that made Steve look up at Tony's sad, so sad, and understanding eyes. It made Steve let out a small 'Oh' and tears start gathering in his eyes… how did he forget, how did he forget that his love was dying, that any day now the Arc-Reactor would give up, or worse, Tony's body will give up, how did he forget that he would lose his love any day now, how did he forget that…
What Tony couldn't wrap his head on was how everyone seemed to be swooning over Rogers. At first, it was only Bucky who was madly in love with the man. Then it became two when Thor started showing interest in said man, always telling him about how Rogers reminded Thor of home and his brother (Tony still refuse to think about that statement, uh-huh, nope, he was not coming near that line of thought at all). Then Natasha came into the mix, something about her always having a crush on the man and that said man was the one who trained her when she was still in the Red Room. Then Clint hopped on board in a creepy way really, because Tony may or may not have caught the man stealing Rogers' underwear… and the most surprising development was Bruce… something about Rogers not fearing the Hulk and seeing Bruce as a real person… Needless to say, Tony was 100% sure that Rogers brainwashed his teammates.
Seeing that caused Tony to let a relieved sigh, and lean back on his seat, pulling his son in his embrace which got him a happy purr from the small pup, who was waking up from his nap, rubbing his eyes with his small fist, calling out for Tony. "I am here baby, it's ok." Tony whispered to his pup pulling him toward him hiding his pup's head in his neck, away from the flashes of cameras and the questions from the screaming reporters.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, Fluffiest fluffs, sadness, cuteness! And who knows what? All reviews are appreciated.
"Yes, darling, I am back, sorry I was late but I had a lot of work to do." Steve said gentle to the boy leaning down to kiss his forehead, a woman appeared from behind the door smiling happily at Steve, but sending a questioning looks at Bucky. "Hello, May, I hope that he wasn't a little maniac when I was away." Steve said looking at the pup who giggled a little which only made the woman laugh softly at that.
"They are fine, sweetheart, they are with Ma and Winnie." That got a sigh of relief from Tony as he thrust his face in his husband's neck, trying to calm his fried nerves further; Steve continued to whisper reassurance, complements, and '
"You do not understand Brother Stark, things were not always like that, he was actually… despised for centuries… by every other star out there…" Everyone can feel the shame rolling out of Thor, in waves, which made them concern. "As ancient laws have it when a new king from Asgard is born, all the stars in the universe must turn their sight to their birth, to approve of the new king, and to give him luck in his quest to kinghood…" Thor tried to explain, but his voice vanished, and in the back of his mind, he can hear his voice chanting
." Peter said a small yawn made itself known as the boy snuggled to Steve, causing the star to let out a happy sigh as he held into the boy, hoping that Tony will leave Peter with him.
Like every other thing related to emotion these past months, Tony ends up burying the strange way he felt and react to the Alpha in the darkest corner of his mind, never to see the light again, but it still didn't stop Tony from thinking about the sweet pup or his huge/scary/blond father who looked like he was ready to break something, or someone, with his bare hands… he was scary. Though Tony could get out of his way and admit that he didn't really know the Alpha other than the judgment he passed base on his looks… Tony hoped the man was not really scary as he looked.
Tony took a few deep breaths, trying to calm himself down before facing his brother once more; opening his eyes, Tony was greeted with the blank face and dead eyes of his brother, that was the only face Tony knew, the only look James bestow upon the Stark family since he was a five years old piece of nothing that finally made himself into something. Tony hate him, he hates him for stealing whatever piece of attention from their father when he couldn't, and he hated that he was forced to consider him a family and a brother, but want it or not, his father has that strange fascination with James, which meant he was forced to tolerate that bastard, he hated that love/hate relationship that was the base that the Stark family build all of their relationships on.
As much as Tony wanted to explain everything to Winnie, he was too workedup to even react rationally, dealing with Sarah Rogers, was heartbreaking and painful, especially when he used to consider the woman as a family, but until she got her act together, Tony was left with nothing but trying to handle the collateral damage that was heading his way. With a nod of goodbye to Winnie, Tony marched out of the house, trying not to let the weight of the world dragging him down until he reached his house…
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, sadness, a little bit of violence (?), feelings, mention of past abuse(?), mention of rape(?), panic attacks, maybe fluff, And Steve finally gets his shit together while Tony scream his head off about something… And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"You know, Stark is not that good for you, Steve, please, just forget about him." Bucky said when they reached his room, causing Steve to still a little frowning at his friend, darkly ignoring the glare Bucky sent his way. "Look Steve, I don't know what Stark did to you, but he is not good, he is as normal as they come, he doesn't understand what makes you, you! And if he had it, he would have changed the best of you and turn you into nothing but normal, why can't you understand Steve?" Bucky plea, causing Steve to press his lips tightly and try to shake the hands that were latching into him which caused Bucky to glare at him, not a few moments later Bucky's hands left his arm and latched into the front of his tact gear, pulling him down.
"I don't know… maybe?" Steve was unsure as he answered Tony's question, letting go of Tony before heading to open the door, with Tony behind, no doubt the two of them were trying to remember if they forgot something or someone. "Who is… what the hell are you doing here?" Steve's harsh tone caused Tony to still for a second before shuffling behind Steve to see the person who dared to gain such a reaction out of his husband.
"Calm down, sweetheart…" Steve murmured in his ear, and Tony turned around to give Steve a piece of his mind too, no one was going to tell him to calm down while his baby was probably traumatized by his grandparents. Turning to Steve, he saw how soft the Alpha's eyes were, taking Tony with awe and love… love shining so strong that it left Tony breathless. "They left him alone for five minutes before they ran back to him; Peter told me the two of them were so scared that they start crying in the supermarket… I don't think it's a good idea to remind them of what happened." Steve stated, his lips twitched up in a devilish smile, which informed Tony that Steve will use this information to his advantage and as blackmail material, Tony had really married the devil… nice.
It didn't take a long time before the Avengers (With Steve and Peter) flow back to the tower, leaving the burned mansion behind with the helplessness of knowing that there was nothing to save, not when the fires eat everything in the mansion. From the rooms to the basement, to their belongings, even some parts of the garden, nothing survived; everything was turned into ashes and coal. Seeing his home burn, hurt Tony deeply, especially when the mansion that burned was the one Tony was raised in since he was nothing but a young child. In the end, Tony swallowed the pain of seeing his childhood burn, being happy and thankful that his son was unharmed; Tony will let the mansion burn again and again if it meant his baby will be safe.
The wedding was breathtaking, it was beautiful and everything Tony dreamed of. Holding Steve's arms in his, was what grounded Tony and informed him that this was real and that he was marrying the love of his life. Gazing at Steve's eyes as they both repeated their vows made Tony breathless, his heart was like a bird fluttering in his chest as Steve's blue eyes never left his, shining with love and adoration that was mirrored by Tony. When they both said 'I do' Tony felt like a fairy tale coming true, especially when the two of them kissed after Steve put the ring around his ring finger; Tony never felt his breath leaving him as he felt it when Steve gave him that gentle kiss, sealing the deal of them being husband and husband.
"Thanks, Buck, talk to you later!" Steve called out, sending Bucky a grateful smile as he made his way toward his husband's office, wondering what Tony was going to do when he will see him. Running his hand through the envelope in his pocket, Steve smiled a flush taking over his face when he reached his husband's office.
When the team reached the Stark mansion, they were greeted with screams and the sound of shooting, that made the team run as fast as they can toward the sound of Maria Stark ordering Tony to stand down, but the Alpha was having none of that as he snarled and the sound of shooting continued.
Tony watched Steve come undone underneath him, back arching and eyes frail and wet again. Steve's loud moans fill the room. It seems to go on and on, and Tony seemed completely lost in it until his own release hit him suddenly and he lunged to bite Steve's neck hard, pounding into him like an animal and whimpering through his own orgasm in just as exposed manner as Steve. Steve's hands wrap around him and keep him close through it.
Pepper's fearful tone made Tony tense unconsciously; feeling like something bad was going to happen any minute now. "What's wrong, Pepper?" Tony asked, wondering if his friend had seen something outside and that's why she was fearful all of sudden, maybe she saw the lake and the truth lying underneath it.
"It seems death is the answer," Anton called out, avoiding one of the bear's claws as he made another swiping motion; the bear was huge, not like any other bear Anton saw before. A bear this enormous would be on the list of creatures Anton would have avoided; unfortunately, Tyber brought the bear's ire, and if they do not kill it, it's possible that the bear would raid the village and kill his people.
Opening the door to the mansion, Steve was greeted by a scowling Tony, which caused the smile on Steve's face to slip, especially when Tony looked between him and Bucky and let out an angry snarl. "Where were you?" Tony growled as he stalked toward Steve, sending him a harsh glare that ordered him to spell everything up.
I'm sure that you know the reference to Peter's name right? Gave you a spoiler for the chapters that will come of that story ;)
So imagine his astonishment when he showed up in the living room only to be greeted by the sight of Tony trying to comfort the child, and failing at it badly, an unpleasant surprise indeed, both of the father and the son look close to breaking down, Tony from frustration and Peter from whatever clouding his mind. "Please! I beg of you, tell me what's wrong!" Tony grumbled, which made Steven's eyebrow twitch, resolving to take petty on the unreasonable man. Maybe he could get something out of it.
Tony swallowed and looked at the building that was going to change his fate any minute now, after taking a big breath Tony marched toward the building with a gift bag in his hand. When he reached Sam Wilson's office, the smile fell off his face as he saw the Beta with his head in his hands looking at the file on his desk with a tired look on his face.
"Steve…" Tony groaned as he dives in for another kiss, getting a small moan from the Omega whose hands were gently caressing Tony's cheeks, causing the Alpha to shudder and dive in for another kiss, and another… and another, ignoring the fact that the two of them were in the living room and that Peter could walk in on them at any point. Steve would probably break his leg if he noticed the pup who then would start asking them strange questions about why Mr. Stark was kissing his mother.
"Fine!" The Alpha snarled as he hit the bars with his fists making a loud bang that made everyone jump, everyone but the Omega who was glaring harshly at the Alpha. "You got what you are after foolish Omega! Your people are granted their freedom, the only thing you shall worry about from now on is your ability to cook and clean, and hope that your son is as good as he claimed." The Alpha hissed as he turned away from the Omega, snarling at the servants making them jump in fear before he stalks toward the stairs, climbing them fast hoping that some fresh air will calm his fried nerves.
Waking up, Steven had to gasp in pain, looking around the place he was in, blinking his eyes tiredly when he was met with endless dark blues with white dotes, which made Steven tilt his head as much as he can while laying on whatever hard surface he had the unpleasant luck of lying on.
"She… she destroyed him. She took everything and kicked him out. As much as I wanted to believe that she is innocent in this world… I can't… I can't separate her from the woman who destroyed my husband's life," Steven whispered feeling drained every time he was forced to remember what that woman did to his husband. Every time he remembered his husband's teary eyes as he told Steven what she did made his blood boil.
Tony whimper as he pulled the fuzzy pink blanket tightly around him, ignoring how Dum-E gave a sad beep as he tried to coax Tony out of his hiding spot from under the table; so far Dum-E had failed and Tony had been hiding under the same table for ten hours, contemplating how the universe hated him and wished to kill him by sending an Addams his way and forcing him to marry the said Addams without him knowing.
"Your phone…" Steve whispered when Tony was about to dive in for another kiss, which made the man groan and hide his face in the Omega's neck, letting out a whine, when Steve pulled his ear gently taking the phone from Tony's back pocket and a slap it in the Alpha's hand, making the Alpha glared at the piece of technology with hate for ruining the amazing time he was having with his mate.
Now, this was the best chance for Tony to say no, and run away to the hills, hoping that Rogers won't catch him. but even Tony knows that this is the best deal he can get out of Steve because an Addams is a magnet for trouble and horror, they can't just tone their urges down like any sane person… they get more creepy if they did (Tony still remember that awful sight of Steve when he tried to be normal) maybe if Tony played his cards right, he will be able to save people who don't deserve to be Steve's next victim.
"Oh, he took me to the hospital… My shoulder was broken and I had a concussion, but I lived… and he paid for my stay at the hospital. You should have seen him, baby, he was panicking and running around every time I let out a gasp." That got a giggle from the child; the thought of Iron Man panicking and running around the place was too funny! Peter was going to glare at Mr. Stark though; no one hurt his mother without getting his shin kicked! "But we became best friends after that." Steve nodded his head at those words, and Tony wished for the ground to open and swallow him whole after this embarrassing conversation, but he did give a happy smile when he heard the laughter and giggles coming from his little family.
"It's OK, no harm done." Tony smiled gently, causing the teens to give mischievous smiles, and run away once more, leaving Sam twitching and groaning in pain. "They seem like good kids." Tony offered with an amused smile on his lips, causing Sam to let out a sigh and nod his head.
"He is sleeping…" The king offered, finally letting go of Steven, his hand falling to his side as many different emotions played over his face. "He is with Petrus, the two fell asleep in Petrus's room after you have fallen into an exhausted sleep." The king stated, and deep down, Steven was grateful that the king didn't make a mockery of his terrified reaction not a moment ago, in fact, the king was acting like nothing strange happened, which was bliss in disguise.
Tony had to wait for half an hour a really short time to destroy a criminal organization to say the truth (No one, not even the most experienced agent or superhero can do such a thing, count on Steve though to plant the fear in everyone's heart and destroy them) but for Tony, it was a long, long time. So long that he nearly jumped out of his seat and called Steve's cell phone, demanding his husband back and force him to come back so the two of them can go and hunt the asshole and their organization when they return back home.
"Who are you?" The king repeated his question but in the Hydra's language, looking at the king who pales then at Steven up and down. "A servant?" He gazed at Steven's clothes with an amused look on his face. "Your fancy clothes say otherwise…" The Alpha then starts circling Steven, though the Omega didn't move he just looked forward trying to stop the fear from taking a hold of his heart. "The Queen?" He asked in a mocking polite tone, but then Steven had to hold his gasp of pain as his hair was pulled back harshly to show his neck, Steven had to bite the inside of his cheek when the Alpha lean to inspect his neck with a hum. "Interesting, no
"Everything is fine," Anton stated, his hackles rising as he saw Steven walking out of the forest with a… boy? A boy?! The Omega accepted a marriage proposal from a boy? A boy who was a Beta on top of that! Anton's Alpha snarled at that, causing Anton to hold into his growl and turn to his friend. "Prepare a hunting party; we are leaving in an hour," Anton said in a clipped tone, making Jamti narrow his eyes but did nothing to change his mind. Anton turned around marching toward his workshop to prepare for the trip, trying to stop the growl that wanted to leave him as his mind replayed the even over and over again; so what if the foolish queen wanted to remarry? It wasn't Anton's concern at all…
Unfortunately, Steve couldn't come with him, having to stay an extra time with his boss Fury, the man was scary, Tony will admit, but he seemed so happy last time Tony saw him; Tony believed that it was because of the new comic that his fiancé was working on, but until this day, Steve refused to tell him what it was, stating that it was a surprise.
What happened after they were done made Tony flush in happiness, and embarrassment; no one had ever cared about him as Steve did when he brought a soft towel as he cleaned him. Just thinking about it made something melt inside Tony's chest because no one he ever slept with cared about Tony when they were done because they will try to leave as fast as they can when they took what they wanted, even Ty. But Steve, amazing and gentle Steve didn't do that; he just cleaned Tony before carrying him to the bathroom, where a tube full of hot water was waiting for them to slide in.
Anton's breath hitched as he was suddenly thrust back years upon years in the past, back when everything was simple and the only thing Anton had to do was make his father proud and take over his job of being the blacksmith of their village. Back when Anton had to do nothing but fix and repair and fantasy about the Omega who promised him marriage upon returning home.
It went from Gamora pleading with her sister stop to Nebula accusing her sister of abandoning her in Thanos' clutch, and it ended with the two of them fighting like their lives depended on it, more with the intention to kill and not restrain, leaving Steve sick when he heard the sound of skin slapping skin, and bones breaking against harsh blows.
"Interesting…" Steven murmured as he stood up from the couch, coming to where Tony was standing and gazing at the pieces of the armor around the table. "You know, the last time I gazed at Midgard, you have only just invented the first steam-powered railway." Steve smiled as he said those words, his gaze becoming distant like he was lost in memories.
The older man just smiled and shrugged his shoulders, Steve was told that day that he inherits the doctor's house in Queens, New York, it had made Steve jaw fell a little, he tried over and over to tell the man that he was wrong that the doctor's children or grandchildren will be better at getting the house, Steve was scared that this was all dream that he will wake up from it soon, but the older man insist that everything was as it was said in the will, that the will specifically mention Steve and that if the Omega refused the house it will go to his pup, it was all surreal that Steve felt like he was half asleep when the older Beta put the keys to the house in his hand.
"What the fuck is wrong with you Rogers?! Enough of this circus show! Get out all of you!" Stane screamed as he saw Steve head under the basement stairs. Stane rage as he pulled Steve's arm making the Alpha growl and turn around toward him like a raging beast… Stane let go fast but he growls at Steve and starts dragging him away. "You are going to hear from this from my lawyers-" Stane didn't finish his sentence as he found himself pulled from his collar and slammed against the wall behind him…
"Someone like me… huh…" Steve could only whisper, feeling what's left of his heart breaking at the truth Bucky present to him; to think that Steve thought Tony trusted him enough to tell him about his secrets. Steve should have known that Tony would never go for someone like Steve… stupid, idiot, foolish, and still lived in a fairy tale world. Of course Tony would go for someone like Pepper, someone realistic and accomplished.
"It was Tony's favorite food, wasn't it?" Steve asked after he finishes the cleaning. Jarvis raises his head at that and smiled tiredly.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, a little bit of violence, feelings, fluff; And Steve being a BAMF… And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
In and out, in and out; Tony can do this, he was finally calming down a little, and OK, maybe Pepper was right on this one, Tony will defiantly do this again. The next pose was a kind of OK one if Tony had to say for himself just as Tony did the wheel pose, a breeze ruffled Tony's hair making him blink his eyes, wondering from where the ghost of wind appeared.
"He knows about his father… Anthony Carbonell." Steve ends up saying after a while of silence making Tony lower his head trying to hold a new wave of tears, because if it was a known truth between Steve, Tony was not Anthony Carbonell anymore, that man died ten years ago and Tony Stark was born. "He doesn't know you other than a superhero and well…" Steve let out an empty laugh at that. "I don't even know how to tell him the truth when the only thing he has of his father is an old picture." That made Tony nod his head leaning on the counter behind him… it was a miracle that Steve was talking to him, let alone telling him about their son, so Tony had no right to feel as heartbroken as he does now.
"You are here! Why did you come here without telling me? I am going to tell Papa, so mean!" That was Peter who skipped into the room, running toward the giraffe and hugging it tightly, ignoring Harley as the teen trying to pull the boy away from the tony least he broke the toy or something.
"Steve…" Tony tried to say in a warning tone when Steve sat in front of him, on the opposite side of the grave; Tony's hope of being able to dash out of here was ruined when Steve send him that dangerous grin promising something horrible was going to happen. "You don't have to do this, please!" Tony hates pleading for anything, but if it will get him out of the cemetery; Tony will marry Rogers, right here right now!
"Sorry, man, but this is the only way for her to leave you alone, if I didn't then God knows what that psycho would have done," Clint stated, causing Tony's eyes to widen even more and for his stress to raise off the chart; a part of Tony was terrified of what Peggy would have done if Clint didn't arrive on time or if she had spotted Peter and Harley without anyone seeing her… just who the hell was Peggy Carter, that Clint thought bringing out the guns was the best way to drive her away? "Dude, are you alright, you are turning white!" Clint said in alarm walking to Tony who seemed to be swaying on his feet. Tony could only give a dumb 'Huh?' before everything turned dark and his legs gave up on him, causing Clint to shout and rush to catch him before he fell on his face.
Steve reached up to Tony's face, pulling him down to kiss him like he needs it to breathe, and Tony gives him everything he got, his mouth caressing Steve's tongue dedicatedly, his hips thrusting in an angle he figures must be good from the sounds Steve makes. It feels like they're breathing life back into each other. As they part to get air, Tony pushed himself roughly upward enough to be able to let his forehead fall on Steve's.
"How did I… how did I arrive here?" Tony finally dared to ask, wanting to know how he arrived at what looked like the past when he was sure that he spent yesterday night in the boat, guarding Morgan without sleeping until dawn broke the horizon.
His life was amazing, he doesn't have to worry about money, because let's face it, as much as Tony know Stane influence on his father, he knows his father wouldn't cut him off financially, his father even being under Stane's illusion was a family man, who loved his family. He just wished that his father hadn't met the other Alpha, he was sure he and his father would have been close if he didn't have. He has good friends, understanding friends, who made him happy, they even planned his Baby shower/Welcome to the neighbor and made it such a lovely surprise. Rhodey was also there returning from the basic earlier to surprise him, but if he was honest with himself, Pepper, Happy, and Rhodey's gift was the best out of all he received, the made such a beautiful
"I can ask that of you Tony, this is too much, especially when you have work." Steve said groaning when his phone starts ringing once more which made the Alpha growl and open the phone screaming at the person on the other line which made Tony wince at that but waited until the Alpha finished, wincing as he saw Steve's stress rising every second he was on the phone.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, a little bit of sadness, fluff, and cuteness, time-skips, family bonding together, unexpected events, and the baby is here! And who knows what? All reviews are appreciated.
Pepper's exclaim made Tony chuckle and shake his head, looking around the place with a soft smile. Rhodey had already finished the rest of the room, and the only thing left was connecting Jarvis to the rest of the cameras/sensors/speakers that were installed around his baby's room; now Tony can say he will sleep comfortably tonight knowing that his daughter was going to be OK.
' and that it was his fault, causing Tony's heart to break and curse whoever caused Harley to turn out like this, feeling scared at the notion of a broken glass that Tony can buy a million of easily.
But then Steve met Anthony and fell in love, then he knew he was having a baby that needs him to stay strong, then his best friend returned from death, then he met Anthony once again, and the two of them made up, they made up and planned to tell their son the truth, they made up and Steve was promised a second chance, and with that second chance came in the selfishness of him wanting to live just a little bit more, just a little more to see Peter all grown up, just a little more to be with Tony and tell him that he loves him, just a little bit more, to roughhouse with Bucky and tease him about his hopeless crush on Natasha Romanov who seemed to tease and flirt with him at the same time, Steve wanted to stay just a little bit more to see Ben and May's boy, whose name will be Harley, and who will be Peter's little brother and best friend… just a little bit more…
"E…e-Edith…" Steve gasped as he raised his head to look at the people that were throwing him concern looks, the room felt so small with so many people crowding his bed, Steve flinch as he felt Peggy's gentle hand on his knees. "I died Edith, I should have died! How am I still alive?" Steve asked with a touch of hysteria in his voice. Everyone flinch as they heard the statics coming from the speaker installed in the room, it made Steve take a deep breath thankful that his mind was distracted by something other than the panic he was feeling at the moment.
… the woman could only think as she gazed at the man her Steven always sower he would marry one day.
"Yes?" Tony asked when he heard the AI call his name, which made the AI pause if it was even possible and call his name again. "Yes? What do you want? uh, Ellen, right?" Tony asked as he raised his head to look at the ceiling.
"Hello sweetheart, how was work?" Steve asked as he turned toward the Omega with a soft smile, which made the Omega give a wobbly smile and walk toward the Alpha, hugging him from behind tightly, which made the Alpha pause a little in his steering. "Love, did something happen?" Steve asked in a gentle voice, words only meant for Tony to hear, making the Omega take a shuddered breath.
"Daddy, Mr. Steve!" A whiny voice made both Steve and Tony look up from their place on the floor (The two had fallen without noticing) to look up at Peter who was gazing at them with the most heartbreaking pout in the world. "What about me? You promised you will call me if something fun happened…" Peter sniffled; gazing at Tony with a look that told Tony, Peter was so disappointed in him (Damn Aunt Peggy! What did you teach his boy?)
They lay on the sofa in silence, save for the sound of them trying to catch their breath. Steve wanted to broach the subject, of why Tony still refused to mark him even after two years of marriage, but Steve decided to do it another time, he didn't want to ruin the good time he was having with Tony because he couldn't wait.
it was when he reached his five hundred years, and that day Sara let him fly in the realms in his Astral Form alone, something about finally being old enough, and that day he spent it playing and enjoying himself to the fullest and being old enough, he decided to see Midgard, he was old by then, an adult, even with Sara's warning, curiosity made him daring.
" A demonic voice hissed behind Fury not a second later after Fury's order, lights start flickering on and off and a few light bulbs explode, causing everyone in the room sane Tony to squeak in fear, even Fury, stood still in his place, his back stiffen and his only eye widen a bit.
Nattalegg wonders if the reason for the king's decision was the small child, she has to admit that yes, the youngster reminds her a little bit of Petrus, he has the same blue eyes and hair, but he was pale… too pale to be healthy, just like his mother, and just like the rest of the servants, which informed her that all of them never step a foot outside of the palace, that they were imprisoned there with a no way out… she can understand why the king will soften a little when those teary blue eyes looked at him, especially when it had been a year since they have last been in the village… Petrus was supposed to be six by now, and she knows that the king's heart shrivels at the thought that he missed another important day of his son's life, maybe the youngster was the reason for the king's strangest decision.
"No, he only annoyed me, and if he knew what's best for him he wouldn't anger me." Steven said which made Loki throw him a look then glance at Dr. Banner an amused smile taking over his face as he studied Steven.
The reason for Steve's suffering and pain, the egoistic Merchant of Death, the object of Steve's hatred… Steve wished with all of his heart that it went another way that Bucky just ran and left that Alpha to die, but knowing that jerk, he will stand between the missile and Stark if it meant that he will protect someone.
and he had to laugh when he saw Thor hugging Loki and crying loudly, ignoring how Loki was cursing and trying to shake his brother's gripe so he can escape.
"… R-Rogers?" Tony asked, unsure when he opened the workshop's door, tilting his head a little to gaze at the person that greeted him on the other end. It was clearly Rogers, but he wasn't wearing any black, leather, or his tactic gears, instead, he was wearing a white button-down with blue slacks, his slightly long hair was slicked back showing his blue eyes and face, and in his hands were a bouquet of roses, actual roses, not only the steams, but with roses attached to them. Tony had to admit, the man was handsome; he looked like a… a normal person, a handsome normal person, but seeing Rogers like this after getting used to the creepy version of him is almost concerning.
"Lunch is ready." Tony said as he put the soba noodle with black sesame seeds with side dishes of cubed chicken, snap peas, clementine, chocolate raisins on the table, which made the pup 'Oh' and 'Ah' with sparkling eyes. "What are you waiting for bambino? Dig in, Cooper, Lila, and Nathaniel are coming over in an hour or two, so you can play with them as much as you like." Tony said which made the pup smile and start eating his lunch, talking about some school project with excitement every bite, which made Tony smile into his food.
"Thank you…" Tony whispered to Steve who nods his head and went to open the door, the Alpha smiled a little at the pair and went outside, a few seconds later, Tony watched as his family entered the room slowly and calmly as to not scare the pup that was trying to hide behind the Shield watching the newcomers with suspicious eyes. Tony had to swallow as he saw Pepper and Rhodey looking at him with tears in their eyes, but they didn't dare to come near him, they were just shaking behind the group taking a step forward then stop like there was something that stopped them from running toward him. "What? Can't I get a hug from my friends?" Tony tried to say in a joking tone, but the words come out trembling, that made Pepper let out a sob and rush to hug Tony tightly crying on his shoulder, the pup that was sitting in Tony's lap slid away, and sit beside his mother watching as the woman with strange hair hugged his mother crying.
Anthony had been with him, through the ups and downs of his life, he had been with him when he was given a scholarship to the art school he always dreamed of, had been with him when his best friend's family left New York, had been with him when his mother died from cancer when he was nineteen… and Anthony promised to be with him for as long as they lived. The Alpha had proposed to him today, on their one year anniversary, and Steve never imagine he will be as happiest as he was, he felt so blessed when a smart and amazing Alpha like Anthony choose him.
Tony thought, he could only press his lips tightly; Tony can already imagine how Steven Rogers must have felt, to feel like everyone is standing against you, how no one would believe you no matter how much the evidence proved that you were on the right… that was Tony's life before, where everyone was content with living in ignorance if it meant that they would live their happy lives undisturbed. "Then Steve Rogers died not two days later, no body was found no matter how many days we search, and then suddenly Rogers was back as a vengeful spirit bent on taking revenge, did I miss something or is there more to the story?" Tony asked, already dreading the next part when he saw Fury shift in his place.
The other Avengers blinked their eyes in shock and they turned to Tony who was flushing at the thought of Steven watching over him all this time, a smile twitched on his face when he saw Peter squeal in happiness and jump around the room at the thought of being forever lucky because of Steven. "Mother-Ouch, Natasha!" Clint whine as he nursed his feet this time, for Natasha has stepped on it with her heel. "Stark, buddy, my friend! Why won't you talk with Steven to give us some of his luck, you know I am in dire need for a bit of good luck right now, maybe then Natasha wouldn't break my bones!" Clint growled at Natasha, who was inspecting her nails with a smile, his words causing Peggy to roll her eyes and sigh at them.
The rest of the flight was spent with Tony laughing madly as he chased the leader down, nearly chopping his head off several times before the worm managed to sidestep his attacks. When the plane finally landed at home in New York, Steve and Tony had the widest grins in all the world as they unboarded the plane after the terrified pilots and flight attendances who ran to safety as fast as they could, trying not to throw up at the blood and body parts that decorated the interior part of the plane. As for Tony, he could only hum happily, with a skip in his steps as he held Steve's hand, smiling at the dark laugh his husband was letting out…
The door opened showing Captain America in the flesh that made Tony pause a little, Peter who looked up after smelling the familiar scent, called the Captain happily in joy from Tony's lap stretching his arms toward the Captain wanting to be picked up and hugged again. That display made Tony froze in fear, after all Steve Rogers was a stranger, his fated mate but a stranger so for his baby to be strangely attached to someone that the Captain only saw when he rescued the two of them was bad, and an Omega trying to force parentage on someone, this was something that will make any Alpha enrage.
The spent the last hour together chatting and laughing; Pepper and Rhodey promised to stay in touch more, now that Howard and Obadiah stopped sending detectives and spies to their apartment, it was all thank to Rhodey threatening to expose Howard and Obadiah's treatment of Tony, which would have caused a lash at Howard and the company's stocks.
By the time everyone sits a foot inside of the Stark's mansion half an hour had passed, entering the house, Tony let out a small sigh followed by a small gasp as he put his pup down and start looking around his house, swallowing as the nostalgia become too much… his home had change… the furniture changed… everything changed… it made Tony stunned as he looked around the place wondering if his room was still the same or it too has changed.
"No, don't say that I'm sure Peter will get better." Tony said biting his lower lip in deep thought. "The clinic I go to, it's a good one, really good." Tony said which made Steve raise his head to look at the Omega. "I always go to them on Saturday and Sunday, if you want, you and Peter can come with me…" Tony ended up saying which made Steve press his lips tightly.
Tony let out a strangled noise as he heard the office's door being slammed open, he bit his lip and held his breath butting the phone down gently, he tense as he heard footsteps searching in the room, after a while the footsteps left making Tony sighs in relief and move his leg a little… it was a mistake. His leg hit something making it falls into the floor with a loud clank…
"That's it, you two are so grounded!" A familiar voice snapped behind Tony, which made Tony sigh and turn around, already planning to apologize and hightail it, while ignoring the twin squeak of disbelieve coming from the teens behind him; Tony's eyes widen when he saw who was standing behind him. Sam Wilson, whose eyes also widen when he noticed Tony.
The Alpha looked at the runes decorating the Omega's bicep, rubbing them harshly trying to see if the Omega engraved them himself to pass as one of them, but the mark was real, that much the Alpha can say, and it was old… too old, maybe a decade and a half since the Omega was marked with those runes. "How did you gain these runes?" The Alpha finally asked letting the Omega's arm go, which made the Omega pull his arm away from the Alpha's grip and glared at him.
"And this little bear is for you…" Steve said getting a Winnie the Pooh toy out and hold it near Peter who was looking at the strange thing that his Papa was holding.
"I'm sorry… I'm going to fix it later." She grumbled making Steve sighs and start the car once more. "What's the name of Clint's mistress?" Natasha asked Steve which made the older man sigh at that and throw the teen an annoyed look.
"That's amazing Tony!" She said with excitement in her voice which made the Omega look at her with a little bit of embarrassment. "Do you know that only 21% of the world populations have fated mates?" That got a nod from Tony as he sat straight to look at the woman. "What was your sign? You know, how you knew that Mr. Rogers was your mate." That got a pause from Tony and a little frown.
"Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, I will be honored!" Pepper said making Tony laughed at that happily. "What are you doing Tony? We should go and celebrate! Come one, I know the best place that sale ice-cream in New York, come one!" Pepper babbled happily getting up and nearly tripping making Tony laugh at that and help her standing up, the two of them went to buy ice-cream and talk about when the baby was going to arrive, and how far Tony was, and how Pepper was going to host the most epic baby shower there is, and… they talked about a lot of things…
Tony waited inside his house until Peggy and Bucky left, and when they did Tony only gave a tired sigh as he slides down until he was sitting on the floor, his mind going into overdrive after his meeting with Peggy and Bucky.
Fury narrowed his eyes before he let out a sigh, putting his cup on the table before turning his attention to Tony. "You know, Carter and Barnes told me about this, and how crazy you were for believing something like that." Fury stated, letting out a tired hum as his eyes still on Morgan. "To be honest, I don't blame you for that kind of thought, not when we didn't give you any reason to believe us. To answer your question, no, Steve doesn't have any relation to your daughter, she is yours, we were there when you gave birth to her; so everyone can testify that you are her parent." Fury picked up his cup, taking a sip from it, his eyes still taking in Morgan who was waking up.
It was a few days later that they returned to the mansion, with the little pup that Tony named Peter; the name gained a knowing smile from Steven that Tony was only now able to detect because of him eavesdropping on Steven and Peggy a few days later.
Tensing Starkad rushed toward the healer, already feeling that there is going to be bad news he will receive, for his friend never looked as panicked as he did right now. "What is wrong, Braes?" Starkad asked when the Beta stood in front of him trying to catch his breath, it was only a few seconds later that the Beta took his hand and start dragging him somewhere, and Starkad was forced to run unless he wanted his face to meet the ground.
"Thor!" His mother's melodically voice caused Thor's heart to beat in his chest like a hummingbird, and as fast as Thor can, he ran toward his mother who was walking down the grand stairs. Reaching his mother, Thor could only hold into her tightly, trying to stop himself from shaking and breaking down; not now, not when everyone was counting on him, not when his mother was crying and holding him tightly just to reassure herself that he was here.
Waking up from sleep made Tony confused because he remembered neither falling asleep nor remembered feeling this content while doing so, when was the last time Tony got the much-needed rest doing that simple thing? It was too long for him to decide, hearing his baby's giggles made a happy smile stretch on his lips as he blinked his eyes open to see what made his baby this happy. The sight in front of him gave him mixed feelings but a smile made it to his face despite everything, because there his baby was, sitting in Captain… no, he will call him Steve, as the Alpha told him to do… Steve's lap while giggling as he touched Steve's Shield, it made Tony's eyes widen a little, and for them to sparkle, if he remember correctly that Shield was made of Vibranium, the scientist in him wanted to pull the Shield toward himself and inspect it, wanting to know what made it works and how much force it will take to bent it, but Tony shook his head at that and sit up stretching his body a little.
"… I… l-love you…three thousand…" Steve whispered before swaying on his legs, the last trace of magic bending him to this body, finally left him, leaving Steve crumbling to the ground turning to stardust before he even landed on the floor underneath him, the last thing Steve heard before everything became dark was Tony's screams and cries of agony…
"He is… with a child…" Braes's voice cracked as he whispered, realization painted his eyes, Braes' face was taken over by rage and he nearly turned to Hamar to finish what Starkad started, but thankfully the Beta was able to calm down and he turned to the Omega, knowing that saving the queen is more important than killing Hamar… everyone knows that not all Omegas can survive the shock their bodies go through if they received a fatal injury to the stomach while pregnant. "Starkad, take him to my hut, Bótey is there she will be able to stop the bleeding until I arrive, I will bring Petrus there shortly, I just need to send a word to Nattalegg and Klint, so that they will come and hold the Alphas until their trial." Braes send him a warning look when Starkad was about to protest.
"Why are you here?" Steve asked, his voice nearly vanishing when he asked that question, he wanted so much to scream at the Alpha in front of him; he wanted to scream, and hit him, and throw things at him, just so he will realize how much Steve was hurting inside.
Tony flipped through the album, letting out a laugh when his eyes fell on the picture of Steve holding the small pup in his arms, looking so panicked, like he was afraid of hurting the baby, and it was so funny to see how a huge Alpha like Steve, was carrying the small (too small) baby in his arms, carefully, like he was going to break him any moment now.
Harley may not be smart-smart as Peter, but he was people smart, he knows what change people, he knows what to do to appear unthreatened, he knows what to do to make them happy and how to force himself to smile and give them what they want so they would leave him alone. Peter may think that Mr. Tony was special and amazing, and maybe he was, but Mr. Tony, Mr. Steve, and even Peter would change once they have another baby coming into the house.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, and we got to meet a lot of different characters! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
After seeing nothing interesting the creature turned his attention back to the boy sleeping, he crawls toward him and pulled him away from the edge to get a good look at him, making sure not to sit near the sleeping boy least he dripped water on him and wake him up, something that the creature doesn't need. Just as the creature thought, the boy was young, too young; the boy was probably younger than what the creature was told. The creature though, didn't pay that too much attention, for something caught his sight, and that was the big belly of the boy; at first, the creature thought the boy was just overweight the first time he came around, but when the creature touched his belly a month ago he knew for a fact that the boy was carrying a child.
"Yeah, sorry, was busy thinking." Tony said which made the Alpha take a seat next to him and look at him with a look that clearly says 'About?' which made Tony's lips twitch up. "How much I wanted to go and explore the city… but the thing is, I can't… because no one will leave me alone as soon as they see me, so I'm stuck here." Tony sighed once more which made Steve bite his lower lip before a smile taking over his face.
"It's just a drink! 'm not even that drunk!" The man defended as he tried to take a step toward his husband, and in the back of Steve's mind, he had to admit that he was impressed with how collected the man was in his speech. "Sorry babe, come on…" Tony said as he pulled Steve toward him and tried to kiss his lips only for the Omega to turn his head away.
What helped Tony in the hardest time to get over the nightmares and fear was surprisingly the lake. If Tony couldn't sleep or was having a hard time; Tony would just take the boat and some blankets and start rowing to the middle of the lake, where he will end up falling asleep in a record time. Tony wasn't really afraid of what will take a place when he leaves the world of the living to the land of dreams; not when he knows that when he wakes up, he will wake up in his living room, cocooned in his blankets, and warmed by both the blankets and the fire burning in the fireplace, even when he never sees his knight in shining armor who made it his priority to keep him safe.
He wanted to tell Steve about this so much, telling him about his want for the two of them to leave, about them being able to start a life away from America, where Steve can continue his studies there, and Anthony finally doing the things he loves, he wanted to tell Steve so much, but the day before he did, his father had walked inside of his lab and inform him that he had three weeks to get ready before he needs to leave for Japan, that he was going to do the presentation there, and that if he did it right and got them the deal they wanted, Anthony will finally become the next CEO. Anthony wanted to refuse, he wanted to say no, but the amount of money he will gain when he comes back will be enormous, it is what he needed to start his life with Steve, and the two of them could finally leave and start their life together!
A gentle voice whispered causing Tony to let out a hitched breath, gazing around the place trying to locate where that gentle voice was. The voice soothed Tony's frazzled nerves after what he endured not a few moments ago. "Please…" Tony plea feeling the tears hot in his eyes, feeling vulnerable and small in a way he didn't feel ever since he was six.
"You don't understand Steven, you don't, an Alpha who lost a mate is not a mentally stable one, never is and will never be, and if someone tells you otherwise they are lying, do you know what will happen to Tony when we find Barnes?" Peggy asked in a small voice, and God, how Steven hated himself for being the reason the woman talked in such a small voice like that.
"That… that… No! I wasn't even informed of these rules, so it meant they are null!" Tony nearly screamed, desperation and shock taking over him leaving his legs shaking in their place, how in the hell did this happen? How did Steve mess up so badly as to not inform him of this? How did Tony fucked up so badly that he ended up agreeing to marry an Addams? Tony should have known not to go to the cemetery; it was a bad, bad idea!
"Oh…" Serpentine let out when a… she really doesn't really know how to describe the goo that came out of the bathroom… swamp monster (Crawled? Slide?) Letting out moans and groans as he continued his way, ignoring how the red spider passed out (Legs up) and how Bucky's fabric face turned purple with him holding his breath desperately. "OK… I can work with that." Serpentine shrugged, chanting a few spells she knew will reverse whatever her boy did to his friends.
"Do you know Italian, Mommy?" Peter asked excitedly, forgetting about his project in the hope of listening to his mother telling him something new, maybe his mother will be in the mood to tell him about his father today after all the Omega didn't talk about his father for months now.
So far the two of them had a fairly normal date; a good one even. Steve had taken Tony to a fancy restaurant that seemed to be open at night and was hard to find; the shock was when Steve told Tony that the restaurant was owned by the Addams family for generations and that every person he was seeing was an Addams from the branch family or someone associated with them. Something that nearly caused Tony to have a heart attack when he realized that he was surrounded by Addams from all sides. On another note, the food turned out to be amazing, and the serves were good, the place would have got five stars… if the waiters and waitresses weren't cut off hands that run so fast that Tony nearly fainted once he saw them.
Tony could only blink his eyes when he saw all of his friends sitting around the breakfast table, everyone seemed to be lost in their own world, even Thor was here, playing with his pop tarts more than taking a bite from them, it had been six months since the last time Tony saw Thor, six months since the God had holed himself in London with Jane, unable to stomach the thought of going back to Asgard ever since Steve's sacrifice. Tony just let a tired sigh, hugging Peter tightly as he seat on the chair with his baby in his lap, he could only lean on his son, hiding his face in his baby's neck, raising his face only when Peter, would pull away and try to shove a forkful of pancake in Tony's mouth.
Tony sighed as he looked outside of the window, keeping his eyes on Peter who was sitting on the carpet coloring and singing a childish song he learned in his class, that made a smile take over his face as he looked outside of the window with a sad look, grimacing when he saw a paparazzi who was idiot enough to climb over the fences and run to the house got chased by the mansion's guard dogs and Shield agents. God, will they ever leave him alone? Even after half a year, and the media world was still going on and on about the story of Captain America rescuing the Starks' heir from Stane, all of the topics they talk about were outlandish! From them saying that he get deformed from the torture he went through, to them saying that he secretly went with Stane to help he create weapons, to him going crazy and that he was actually in the loony bin, it made Tony want to throw up every time he heard them talk shit about him, especially that woman whose name was Christine Everhart who seemed to make it her life goal to dig into Tony's past destroying his image by doing that, going on and on how he was nothing but a playboy in his teenagers years, and that he probably gave Stane the idea that he was his… it always made his mood sour when he hears her voice.
From that time on, Stane didn't enter the room if one of his minions wasn't with him, Tony always fought… always, he wouldn't let that crazy fucker touch him, he may be an Omega but he won't lower his head for any Alpha, the only thing he was thankful for that Stane didn't use his Alpha voice to on him, only a truly demon would do that, Alphas' instincts wouldn't let them hurt Omegas… but some were demons and nothing can stop them…
"Why wouldn't I be dead?" Steve raised his eyebrow at Peggy an amused smile playing on his lips. "You are all dead after all." That made the room feel into awkward silence, though the only one who didn't seem to notice was Steve, as took Edith from the bedside table and inspect the AI, smiling happily when he saw that no harm had come to Edith, he wore the glasses and smile as he saw that the AI was rebooting.
It was a few stops later before the three of them returned home, Peter hanging in Tony's arms as he yawns and snuggled into the Omega's chest murmuring sleepily about wanting to stay up, which made the Omega roll his eyes but smile happily at that, when he changed his baby's clothes and made sure he was sleeping, he went to search for Steve, finding the Alpha in his room, getting ready to bed. "Tony?" Steve's gentle tone as he questioned the Omega made the man swallow but he steels himself and gazes at the Alpha in the eyes trying to stop his eyes from wandering to the Alpha's chest, considering that the Alpha was in the middle of changing shirts.
"Oh, well, you see, this is Pepper's!" Tony panicked as he said those words hoping that Steven will believe his excuse even if it wasn't believable at all, and it seemed that Steven didn't buy it because he narrows his eyes and gazes at Tony with that look he mastered, the one that made you feel like Steven was gazing at your soul and uncovering the darkest secret you have.
"Unfortunately, can't, he is… holy fuck! Is that Rogers?" Tony asked when he saw Rogers appear out of thin air beside Hammer in the full Winter Soldier getup, looking like a demon out of hell which caused Hammer to turn to his side and scream loudly (And God, did Hammer scream like a girl) "How… why… oh God we have to stop him!" Tony stood up when he saw Steve pull out his scary ritual knife that had dried blood on it.
Tony admit that it was fun, he was happy, overjoyed with how his babies opened up to him; this trip Steve took, proved to Tony that he can and he would take care of both Peter and Harley if the need arise or if Steve was too busy to be available. Considering that today was the start of the weekends, Tony was trying to think of a fun activity to do with the kids who were playing at Clint's house.
The man had changed, Steve can say, and not only his looks but his attitude as well, instead of the clean shaved face Anthony usually kept the man sport a goatee, it was a strange seeing the Alpha like that but it only showed how much handsome he was, also his hair, instead of the messy bangs he usually kept when he was out, it was now slick back giving him a sharp look, it made Steve's heart give a bang and he increased the volume of the voice, hoping to hear what was exchanged.
"It was Tony… it was… I didn't notice that my child was suffering until I found her ready to kill him; I was the reason that he feared Omegas, I was the reason he was hurt and scared and in pain… it was all on me." Steve's voice cracked and Tony tried to shush the Alpha as he held him tightly, kissing his forehead hoping to calm him down. That day Tony realized…
"Can I help you, Sir?" Hearing that voice behind him sounding so tired, it made Bucky turns fast, probably scaring the Omega, but Bucky couldn't help but look at the Omega in front of him taking him in, Steve had changed so much, he got more beautiful as the years passes, more beautiful and tired, the Omega tilted his head in confusion, than his eyes widen and his jaw to drop. "Bucky…?" Steve choked out which made the Alpha run toward the Omega pulling him in a tight hug, shaking all the while as he felt the Omega chanted his name and pulling him tightly sobbing on his chest. "You are alive! You made me so worried about you, you jerk!" Steve said punching him on the chest when he let go, which only made Bucky laugh a little and look at the Omega that was smiling happily at him.
"So what are you going to do Steven?" Peggy asked that night when everyone was lead to their rooms, everyone was exhausted from what they have learned today, and they all were concern about Steven and his counterpart, after all, they just learned that Steven was supposed to be their 'Steve' while their current teammate was supposed to be from the other universe but they have switched places, it was draining and mind-blowing in away.
"Yeah, it's good to see you too, doc, and please call me Tony." Said Tony as he put the magazine down, the appointment started with Dr. Cho taking his height, weight, and checking over the tests that Tony has done period, and writing more tests for him to do, she also informed him about how she want to carry amniocentesis and that Tony should come into the clinic next week, she gave him the 'do's and 'don't's, telling him all he needed to know about his baby (Not that he needed her to tell him, after all, he spent the past month reading all the parental books his hands fell on) ending their check-up with her taking another ultrasound of the baby. Tony's heart flutters happily when he saw the baby on the screen; he told the doctor he needed six copies of the picture, after all, his friends threaten him if he didn't bring them pictures of the baby.
Though before he can even apologize, Steve put his hand on Tony's cheek before giving him a soft peck on the lips, before pulling back, and Tony doesn't even know why this small kiss left him flushed and wanting, but the gentle smile on Steve's lips was worth it, it took his breath away. "Come one, I will prepare the guest room for you; God knows what type of accident you will get in if I let you leave when you are tired." Steve said as he walked toward the guest room, and Tony tried to hide his laugh behind his hand, already knowing that Steve was too embarrassed to want to talk about what happened not a few seconds ago and this was his way of deflecting… though warmth made Tony's body tingle as he followed Steve, a happy smile making itself known on his face and refusing him… maybe they can go through this… together…
"Call me Tony, please, and well, me and the kiddo thought that it will be a good start for a change, you know what I mean?" Tony said as he glances at the woman seeing her hum not taking her eyes off of the road, saying something under her breath as they finally left the town behind and headed to Lake House, it made Tony smile and return his gaze outside.
You don't know how many times I wrote and rewrote this chapter, writers-block is a bitch I will tell you that.
"You know, you could call me by my name if you want, no one is around, Margaret, or do you prefer Peggy, I heard Angela loved calling you by that name." he hummed with an amused look on his face, causing the Beta to flush and turn her face away from him, as she helped him wash his back.
"He doesn't have any living relatives…" Peggy said slowly, making the Alpha glance at her before giving her a file making the woman snatch it out of his hands and flip through it with interest, frowning when she didn't see any photos, just dates, numbers, and little information to be known with the grandson's address. "Fine then, it seems like I need to visit someone very soon… let's hope he knew something." Peggy said to herself as she closed the file humming to herself at the thought of meeting the man's grandson, that thought made a smile take over Peggy's face…
"Oh, show them to me." Steven said as he stood up, following his son when the young Alpha pulled him toward the desk full of books and papers. Steven's face darken, as his eyes fell on the book his son pointed at and he pulled him as far away from that book, he will not make his son read this monstrosity, he refused for his son to learn about Hydra's retched history. "Good thing I am here now, darling come, I will teach you about something very important today." Steven said as he pulled his child toward the small rounded table, surrounded by two chairs.
"I… I don't know! You got married! I… and I… I don't know…" Harley start sniffling, wiping his nose with the sleeve of his shirt, biting his lower lip hard to stop himself from crying, the action made Steve let out a tired sigh, standing up before coming to sit beside the small boy pulling him in his lap, allowing Harley to hide in Steve's chest. "Mr. Stark wouldn't like that… you got married, so you… you… can't hang out with me anymore." Harley's words were muffled by Steve's shirt but the Alpha did manage to hear him, and it broke his heart hearing the boy say these words.
"I… I am sorry; I should have been there…" Margaret's voice cracked, which caused Steven to close his eyes trying to stop the pain from entering his heart and hurting him even more, when Steven was able to collect his barriers he smiled at Margaret, even when he was feeling like he was dying on the inside for what he was going to say next.
Steven coughed as he spat the foul taste in his mouth, having retched not a few minutes ago, making Steven frown at that thinking that he may be falling ill, which was not a good sign at all especially with the Iron King watching him for any misstep like a hawk watching his prey. It happened when Steven was tending to the garden, the dizziness that was followed by nausea, and then Steven was running to the woods behind the house, hiding behind a tree as he retched, groaning in disgust and pain, leaning on the tree behind him after he was done, burying the evidence of his sickness with a few layers of dirt.
But it seemed that he remembered something else, a nightmare of another night similar to this one. Every person Tony questioned, asked him who was Ty, even Angie the one she told him who the bastard's name is was. It was crazy; this was making Tony feel crazy, especially when everyone starts looking at him with concern.
Tony could only let out a relieved sigh as he went to Peter's room, he could only thank his husband mentally for being considerate and not let him in the face of loose cannon in the form of their ten years old son. It took a little of tricky moving to climb the stairs with Harley in his arms, the small boy grunt and wipe his face in Tony's neck as if he was about to wake up; Tony ended up rocking Harley a few time, shushing him softly as the two finally reached Peter's room. Tony considered it a win that they didn't fall and break any body part, especially with Tony's mind being in another place than the present.
"Do Parks open at night?" Steve asked curiously and only then did Tony realize that Steve falls asleep every time the sun comes up. Steve practically turn into a puppet that had its strings cut when the sun touches him, something that freaked Thor (And everyone really) the first time they saw him collapse when the sunrise the first day he was with them. After that everyone made sure that Steve is in his room before the sun rose, no one wanted a repeat of that day, especially in front of Peter.
"Mr. Rogers." Tony nods giving the sleeping pup to his father, and as much as the Omega didn't want he had to pray the pup's hands away from his shirt. Which made the Alpha pause a little and maneuvering the pup until the pup snuggle into him hiding his face in Steve's neck and purr happily.
Letting out a huff in annoyance, Steve glared at the note hoping that it will burn to flames and send his real feeling to Tony, it was a few seconds later that Steve turned around when he heard Bucky asking if he was OK; nodding his head, Steve walked toward Bucky, giving him a grateful smile before they both start walking outside of the mansion to Steve's car.
With that, Steve spent the first week of Tony's vacation trying to finish the commissions he had, cursing these stupid hormones that made him cry at the thought of his husband not paying him and their baby enough attention as it is. Steve didn't want to complain, not when Tony was doing his hardest in catching whoever dared to trespass on their home, still, it was hard.
Tony swears, and he will swear to his dying day that he blinked for only a second, only one second before he opened his eyes; but when he opened them, Tony wasn't in the room but in the closet, huddling with Steve who was shushing him, fear lacing in his crystal blue eyes… eyes that were familiar that Tony was looking. "Someone… someone broke into the house, you need to stay quiet…" Steve whispered shakily, causing Tony's lips to tremble… what was going on… what the hell is going on?
The knock on the door made Steve look up from his charcoal painting and blink in confusion, it was two weeks since Anthony had left for the presentation and two more weeks before he returned home, and Steve wasn't waiting for anyone so he was surprised that someone was knocking at his door at, Steve looked at the clock, 11 p.m., the knocking continued making Steve frown and put the pencil down and stand up, maybe it was one of the neighbors who locked himself out of the apartment and needed help?
Tony sighed to himself as he moved a little, waking up with a smile on his face as he saw his baby snorting happily beside him, making Tony give a content smile and nuzzle the little pup, making him hum and snuggle into Tony's chest. The Omega smiled widened as he looked over the edge of the bed to see Steve sleeping silently with Goose, the Alpha never demanded anything from him the past three months since they start dating, always patient with him, always understanding, and the Omega really appreciates the Alpha for that, for giving him the freedom to make his choices… it's been three months and the most advance thing Tony got was a kiss on the cheek and a loose hug, which made Tony pout as much as it made him swoon how the Alpha was
"I want you to know that just because I agreed to the therapy; it doesn't mean that I am going to like it." The Omega ends up saying after a while of silence which made the Alpha chuckle and nods his head.
Shakily, Tony took the phone in his hand putting it between his ear and shoulder as he dialed the number he memorized years and years ago; hitched breathes and sniffled could be heard as Tony tried to get a gripe, Tony needed to stay calm, he needed Rhodey and Pepper to understand his words without the sobs mixing with his speech and turning it to a mess.
Serpentine's mad cackles made Tony wince and let out a sigh, turning to his Pepper and Rhodey who were pale as ghosts, having seen Steve torturing someone for the first time since they have known him. Bruce had already run out of the room when Steve started his torture season, not too keen on letting the Hulk out with all the madness and screaming that was taking a place. Natasha was wincing, but she was tilting her head as if she was engraving this torture season in her mind, probably thinking of it as an opportunity to expand her torturing technics. As for Bucky… Bucky was looking at Steve like the sun was shining out of his ass, sighing and like a lovesick schoolgirl, and letting out a giggle here and there making Tony really concern about the man's mental state.
Steven let out a sigh and bit the inside of his cheek, already knowing what the king meant… how many children, such a hard question with a harder answer. "The ones I birthed or the ones I adopt?" Steven ended up asking, for the king's question has many answers, and could go either way; Steven had many children and he grieved for every one of them, some more than the others. The king let out a choked noise, turning to Steve with wide and disbelieving eyes, and even Steven won't fault the king for looking at him this way, for no Omega will care for a child they have not birthed. "Six in total…" Steven ended up answering the king's question, trying not to think of the king's wide eyes and hitched breath. "Three of my own womb and three I raised; all of them are dead except for two," Steven stated but didn't answer more of the king's questions. "Why the soft heart all of sudden, foolish king? This is not you." Steven finally pointed out the king's strangeness the two of them were dancing around.
If the queen's words were true… Anton know they were, so far the queen never dared to say something he didn't mean… not only will Anton have a reason not to tie the knot with the Stone clan, but it also meant that they were deceived by them, it was just like the mess of Stane and Brookland all over again, but this time it involved the deceive being hidden under the layers of heroism.
"He was an angel, unlike someone I know." Rhodey joked just to be a little shit, and this time instead of Tony pouting or calling out a loud hey, he just laughed and shook his head, punching the man on the shoulder making sure it was an extra hard punch, knowing that Rhodey couldn't do a thing now Tony was pregnant and showing, not if he didn't want to get pound to the ground by an angry Natasha and Pepper.
"What's dat, Mama?" Peter asked as he looked outside of the window pointing at the big thing with small green papers attached to it, it made Tony sigh a little in sadness and kiss his head and look outside of the window, it hurt him deeply that his son had to ask what a tree was, never having the chance to go outside once in his small life until now that is.
When his sight cleared up, Steve could only give a tired 'Huh?' as he took in Howard who entered his room closing the door behind him. It made Steve curious, it made him wonder what was the older Stark doing in his room when he probably has more important things to do than rub it in Steve's face that he was dying; not that Steve will blame the man, he knows how much Howard hate him, even when he never knew why.
"Hello young Master, my name is Jarvis." The man said which made Peter smile at that and touch the hand the man extends holding it with fascination at how big it was, it wasn't big like his Papa, but it was bigger than his.
"Did we wake you up?" Bucky asked as he took the boxes of takeout from Peggy and headed to the kitchen, leaving Peggy holding the cherry pie they brought. Bucky's words only made sense after Tony yawn and rubbed his eyes trying to wake up.
"So you finally return, Starkad!" The joyful voice made the Omega turn to the caller to see a woman with a fiery red hair just like the woman with the green eyes but this woman has a blue instead, not far away behind her was a man with dark skin like coal and dark eyes that were looking at Steven with suspicion. Though the Omega paid that look no mind, after all, he was at the end of that look one too many in all of his years of life, though it was interesting to learn that the Iron King's name was 'Starkad' a name that caused a pang in his heart, he shook that thought away just like he shook it for more than two decades.
"But… it's yellow?" Peter asked as he looked at Steve with confused which made the Alpha smile at the small pup and ruffle his hair which made the boy giggle and shriek, trying to pat Steve's hand away, Steve was proud to say that the small pup's vocabulary got better in only two weeks, it was obliviously that the small pup was a genius just like his mother, or his speech wouldn't be as perfect as it was now.
"Probably in six months or so." May said through happy laughter which made Steve grin happily and pulls her in for another hug, cooing softly to the woman as she sniffed a little and hide her face in Steve's neck. The Omega knew how much May and her husband wanted children, how they tried for more than ten years without success, and it broke Steve a little that he had to ask May to babysit Peter a lot of times, knowing that every time the woman looked at his pup her heart will be a little pained for not being able to have kids, but hearing this, hearing that May was finally with a child, it made Steve happy, his heart fluttering in his chest.
The boy looked at his father who was holding a pillow and touching his nose while glaring at the blond man, and then he returned his sight to the man who was smiling and hiding a pillow behind him. "Oh, can I join?" The small boy jump in excitement as it clicked in his head that the man was saying the truth which made him rush to his father, tugging his shirt. "Please, Daddy, can I join you two? Even Dum-E got to play!" The boy pointed at the robot that was holding a pillow ready to throw it at Steven but drops it when the small boy pointed at him.
"Pierce happened." Fury spat, slamming his cup down, his face darkened even more at the mention of the man that was the reason for Rogers's death. "Pierce was… he was looked up to by many people in the town, he was a man with a bright idea for the future, promising our town many good changes and even made it true on some of his promises; it was obvious that people all around him were going to protect him and his reputation of being a good man. What we didn't know, was that everything he has done was only for his personal gain and for manipulating the town." Fury explained, making Tony frown, already thinking back about what he read on Pierce.
"Mama, he is here! The oathbreaker who stole Hvítur Úlfur is here!" James's voice became louder the nearer he came toward them, and Anton wondered if there was a way for him to stop the fight before it started. But knowing the foolish queen, there will not be such a thing; the queen will fight and fight and Anton will be left with the consequences, which meant more work than Anton would have liked.
Seeing Steve move away from him, that was what unfroze Tony and the Alpha rushed upstairs heart pounding in his chest hoping that he will be able to catch Steve, and he doesn't know, maybe plea with him? But for Steve and his son he will do anything no matter what the consequences will be. He reached the second floor and rushed toward Steve's room, heart pounding in his throat when he saw Steve sitting on the bed with his head in hands causing Tony's hands to shake as he took a step after step toward the Omega until he stood near him, sitting beside him on the bed and pulling the Omega in his arms, holding him tightly. "I am selfish…" Tony said after a while of silence holding Steve tightly in his arms. "I am a mess, but you knew that when you start dating me, I was never a good man, not like you, I am the farthest from anyone you can imagine… but I can't lose you… not you, not Peter, can't… I already did, I lost you for eleven years, and I can't do it again, I can't… I am sorry… you don't know how much I am sorry, how much I hated myself because I know that it's my fault, it will always be my biggest regret, falling for Howard's mind games and not seeing the truth earlier, for letting you and Peter suffer while I was out there making a fool out of myself, I am sorry…" Steve sniffed at Tony's words when he moved Tony feared that the Omega will move away from him, that he will rip himself and push Tony away, but when Steve leaned on him, the Alpha let out a stuttered breath of relief and pulled the Omega toward his body.
"I ask a few questions and you answer them, easy is it not?" The king asked with a smirk, which made the Omega blink at that a little not expecting the man to ask that of him considering that he was his '
"Nat, he is my brother-in-law!" Steve shook his head at his friend's pout, turning his attention to his melting ice-cream; letting out a sigh, Steve picked up a cherry and put it in his mouth sending Natasha a mean look. "Besides, did you forget that I'm married? I don't do cheating if that what you were implying." Steve said as he chewed his cherry, getting an eye roll from Natasha.
They walked for a little while until they reached the golden hall of Asgard, or more simply the throne room, to see Odin sitting on his throne with two big ravens perching on his throne looking at the Avengers with their small and black eyes, and Steven could hear everyone behind him shuffle closer to him, which made him blink at that. While everyone kneeled for Odin and showed him some respect, Steven stayed standing, glaring at the older man, a few decades earlier, before Steven knew of Loki's sacrifices through the queen of the New Asgard, he may have admired the man and showed him some respect, but in the light of what he has done to his adopted child and the pain he caused the nine realms for his idiocy, Steven will say Hell to the no to that, he wouldn't show respect toward some bully. Steven could see the king's one eye looking at him with a thoughtful look on his face, especially when Frigga whispered something in his ear.
"Do you not remember what happen a few hours earlier?" The king asked after a few minutes, his question made Steven blink his eyes when he drew blank on the memories. As far as Steven remembered, he was heading for a nap with James before he woke up with the foolish king beside him. "You woke up looking like you have met Hela in the flesh, and start looking for James like the hounds of Hel were behind you." The king stated causing Steven to blink his eyes and turn his gaze to the ceiling with a frown; he does not remember any of this.
As much as the Alpha wanted to introduce himself, he couldn't, not when the small pup in the Omega's arms called for the woman with a happy smile, not when the queen's eyes soften as he held the woman as she starts crying on his shoulder, and he thinks that the Omega wouldn't take kindly to him staying, not after what he informed the queen of…
In the end, it was his son who surprises him. "Mommy, do we have a picture of Daddy?" The little boy asked Steve making the Omega lose his words and just stood still staring at his son like an idiot. "I mean… Daddy is not here, and you never told me about him… so if he was gone… can I have his picture?" Steve should have known, the one thing that his son inherited from his father the most, was his intelligent, his baby was smart, super smart, just like his father, he loved science and robots and inventions, so for his son to think that way, with all the pieces of evidence being laid in front of him that pointed to that… it was an unenviable situation.
All in all, everyone was enjoying themselves, Tony too, for he had met so many amazing people, and was finally able to spend time with all of his friends who he missed dearly and didn't have that much time to spend with them out of their weekly meeting, the only thing that dampened his mood was his father not showing up, which he tried to hide from his fiancé.
"Hello, little one what's your name? My name is Maria…" The Omega said as she looked at the small pup which made the pup detangled himself from his mother and walked toward the old Omega, Maria wondered to herself what Steve will do, if he will pull the small pup away from her or if he will tell her to leave, but the blond Omega did nothing, only taking a sip from his tea.
“It’s OK, Ben.” Steve said as he went to his friend, hating how rough his voice was, and how it was almost gone, but Steve needed to stop Ben before he shoots Howard, and then all hell will be on them. “He helped us; he shot the one who did this.” Steve explained, causing his friend to gaze at him with concern, biting his lower lip, Ben nodded his head and lower the gun down, giving Howard a nod before he herded Steve toward May who was holding Peter tightly in her embrace, ready to take them in his house, thankfully it was then that the police followed by the ambulance arrived.
Tony let out a moan of pain as he straightened himself, running his hand gently on his forehead, wondering if there will be a pump left on his forehead with the way it was throbbing. "Tony!" Rhodey's scared tone, made Tony shake his head and grumble to himself, narrowing his eyes when he saw a light coming from a slight in the closet; he should really wait for Rhodey, but the rebellious part of him, once again acted on its own.
"You will regret this…" Carter hissed, causing Tony to stiffen in his place, but the gentle hand Steve put on his back, relaxed him, letting out a tired sigh, Tony watched Peggy leave the house, stomping her way toward the taxi that was waiting for her no doubt…
At least Steve was making a notable process with Harley, which Tony was thankful about even if he was a little bit jealous at times. but after three months of Harley living with them, Tony can safely say that the boy started to warm up to everyone, and by everyone Tony mean himself mainly, then his and Steve friends' and extended family, which was a process if Tony saw any.
It was only when the elevator door closed behind them that the two of them moved. Like someone possessed Tony, he pulled Steve and kissed him like his life depended on it, and maybe it did in a way, maybe Steve felt it too because the star held his tightly as he kissed him over and over, dominating him and leaving Tony breathless and under Steve's mercy; who would have thought that such an angelic face would hide behind it such a devilish nature?
"Listen, boy, I do not know what my counterpart has done, but make this known to you, I will never hurt my son." Odin hissed after he stopped in front of Steven which made the man look at Odin with cold eyes.
"I know it, its, it is iron!" Megan said happily, making Tony laugh at that and nod his head. Three years passed since that day, the day he promised himself to be better, to do better, and in those three years, a lot of things changed.
It seems that the inspiration and the will to write had flown out of the window the moment college started…
"But we will be all right, won't we, Steve?" Tony asked after a moment, snuggling tightly into Steve and pulling him back into his arms. It's more a statement than a question. And Steve smile when Tony kissed his hair, his palm pressed over Steve's stomach protectively.
By the time they reached the tower, both Steve and Peter were dozing off; the exhaustion was clear on both of their faces. "Steve…" Tony's voice cracked as he tried to wake the star, wondering if he should call Thor and Bucky to carry Steve to one of the rooms in the tower; Steve was probably back to sleep and won’t wake up until the sunset, which they have seven hours before it does.
"Rhodey, who was he?" Maria asked taking a step toward the Beta which made him snap and look at the Omega who was on the verge of crying, because no matter where she turned her head the people around her all being secretive, and Barnes wouldn't say anything as he was taking every evaluable moment to leave and seek Howard to kill him.
Tony watched as Natasha and Clint collect up their things, Natasha leaving the bag with the remaining food and orange juice in the kitchen, glaring at Tony as she ordered him to eat. Natasha and Clint said their goodbyes and head back up the trail, Tony watching as Natasha ordering Clint to move fast so they will be able to bring the mattress faster.
"Nice to meet you, Harley…" Howard smiled as he said those words causing the little boy to give a fleeting smile before letting go of his hand, and that was only because he nearly got run over by Peter who pulled him into a tight hug and squealed happily that his friend was coming to live with them…
"Oh, so cute! Your crying face is the cuties thing I have seen in eighty years! Not since my Stevie pouted when his hidden rabid cat couldn't kill me!" The ghost giggled as she gazed at Tony who was giving the ghost a terrified look. "Oh, and by the way, I'm Steve's mother, Serpentine Addams!" The ghost chirp happily, lowering herself and start tidying Tony's tie, causing Tony's eyes to nearly roll in the back of his head.
' and an arrogant Alpha that the Omega wouldn't mind showing him his place, but actually, the Alpha's request was not a hardship, so the Omega shrugged and nodded his head. "Where is your family, princess? I am sure they would have searched for you high and low, especially with those runes." The Alpha said as he pointed to the Omega's covered arm, making the Omega look away from the Alpha, his hands tightening on the mug once more.
Though Tony remembered that Steve told him about the characters in the book being real friends of his, the Alpha always uses his friends' names in his comic books, look at Captain America, Tony laughed when the character's name was Steven Rogers, something that the Omega always teased the Alpha about, Tony grinned as he went through the comic, wanting to know which of Steve's friends the Alpha used in his comic this time, having not read the comics since he wasn't that interested in it, but knowing that Peter was the main character, considering that the pup told him about Steve drawing that comic for him as a birthday present.
