The letters are all intimately private, gorgeous words of prose and love and little mundane things that reminded Howard of Maria while he was at MIT and she was in California. Tony can feel the emotion welling in his throat as he reads, disbelieving that the Howard he knows could've written these beautiful poetic words.
The kit doesn't have enough to build beyond the arm, but he figures it out on his own. He has to scavenge parts from his father’s workshop to make the little robot functional but he is careful to only take the pieces and wires he needs from the recycling bin, making sure not to disturb any of his dad’s work.
It's way too fucking early and Tony is not nearly lucid enough to operate at full capacity. His face is mashed against the top of the table and he's probably drooling slightly when he's woken from his doze. The hall outside is filling with other students, chattering inanely about their summers. Tony tries his best to block them out by covering his head with his arms, but suddenly there’s the sharp black smell of coffee and he groggily lifts up his head, sniffing the air.
On the second day, he does the same thing all over again, spending his breaks and lunchtime locked in the labs, begs his lab partners not to let anyone in, especially not Steve. The only person he's willing to talk to is Pepper, and he's so grateful to have her, he doesn't deserve her. She brings him food and coffee and makes sure Thor and Sam doesn't get any ideas about accosting him with futile pleas to talk to Steve.
Steve instantly turns an endearing and rather alarming shade of cherry and Tony has to resist kissing him again. He turns before he gives in to the impulse and tries to ignore the stares as he walks away, Steve’s gaze feeling the sharpest and hottest between his shoulder blades.
Tony is running through the grass and throwing himself into Steve's waiting arms, laughing when Steve swings him up. Steve's large hands are cupping the crest of Tony's hips and he's curling his legs around Steve's waist and he's pulling Steve closer and in and then, his lips are pressing against Steve's, warm and soft and pliant and—they're kissing.
“And you really are like Spock,” Steve says after a yawning stretch of silence. “You're incredibly smart and focused. I've never met anyone as smart as you. But you're also very hard to read. You have all of these layers and you build all of these walls to keep people out because you don't want people to see your real emotions.”
Tony's breath hitches in his throat, remembering the night they danced at Thor's house. “Guess so,” he agrees softly, and his voice strangles in his throat when Steve drops down to kneel on the floor between his legs and takes Tony's hard cock with one gentle hand.
Tony convinces Steve they’re pretending they’re running away together on grand adventures, riding giant locomotives across the country. Steve laughs and indulges him, doesn’t see the sad truth in Tony’s eyes, wishing he can really run away with Steve.
Steve scrunches his face a little. “It’s—the exhibit looks interesting. It’s only going to be around for a few weeks, but if you don’t have time, it’s fine—“
Sometimes he runs up to Steve on the field after practice, and ignoring the ribbing and good natured teasing from Steve's teammates, presses his cold nose against Steve's warm cheek. Steve is usually a furnace after practice, and there's no better way to warm up from the cold than to walk back to the school with Steve's arm draped snug around his shoulders.
Tony takes mercy on him and moves down to take more of Steve’s cock in his mouth, swallowing down as much of the considerable length as he’s able until it presses snug against the back of his throat. He’s not sure if the next moan is from himself or from Steve whose head is tossed back against the chair, broad chest heaving with heavy breaths.
Tony nods dutifully but he can’t help thinking they’re not, not really. Starks are simply war mongers who sell to the highest bidder, bottom feeders with no honor and even less scruples. They’re not a military family. He feels like a fraud again, an imposter in all things.
It’s a force of habit for him to reach for it whenever he feels the claws of anxiety grip his throat and the smooth plastic centers him a little. Even now that he’s back on earth, the thing feels like a lifeline.
“Hey, you,” Steve replies, pulling him in for a kiss as his hand tightens around the crest of Tony's hip. His fingers slot perfectly along the day old bruises there, squeezing softly before his palm slides down over the curve of Tony's ass and further still to the dip of his spine.
A second sound, one that instantly sets him on edge and immediately silences their laughter comes comes from the cover of trees to their left. Footsteps crashing through the brush.
Steve is swiping through the pages with increasing incredulity. There’s the Sullen Steve Stare complete with creases in his brow as he reads.
“Another time,” Steve says. “You need to sleep.” He cuddles closer and winds an arm around Tony's waist holding him snug.
,” Tony texts back as Steve messages him for the fifth time that hour. He hadn't even noticed the sun has set and it's nearly five already, so Steve must be sneaking breaks at practice to send him these messages. He feels terrible for making Steve worry. He knows that Coach Coulson has been extremely hard on the team with the championships coming up, but Steve still finds time between drills to check up on him.
“It's nice to see you too, Tones,” Rhodey says affectionately, laughing. He still has an armful of clinging Tony, who absolutely refuses to let go of him, even when they make the rounds of introductions.
By day four, cabin fever sets in and Tony clambers his way out of the medbay despite Bruce and Rhodey’s protests. Because he’s fine. Really. All healed, spic and span. Good as new. He just needs his own bed.
“Not puny,” Tony corrects, slumping further against Loki. “Fun sized.” He wants nothing more than to stay in the lab and work on his robotics project. Sports are stupid and pointless.
Tony takes a final look and heaves a deep breath before turning around, feeling the hot pit of emotion bubbling in his chest swell. It’s a bright tangle of feelings he’s too overwhelmed to pick apart at the moment, and his stomach is tied up in knots. There’s a dense mass of anticipation entwined with a glowing line of excitement and happiness that heats his chest. His throat feels tight and his hands are trembling and there is a flock of butterflies flapping a tornado inside him.
“Good!” Rhodey says cheerfully, smiling at the both of them. The smile grows blade sharp as he addresses Steve again, “so that means I don't have to tell you I
marrying Steve feels like the end of a journey. Tony remembers their first night, a decade and a lifetime ago. A fumble in the dark on a small rickety farmhouse bed, Tony full of anger and self hatred as he hissed at Steve to fuck him harder, wanting it to hurt. And now—now with Steve tenderly pushing the shirt from his shoulders and tipping him gently onto their bed as he mouths words of love against Tony’s skin and fills him up like he’ll never be empty again, handles him like something precious—how did Tony live for so long without this?
Tony is jostled out of his spiraling thoughts by Pepper squeezing him tighter. The sideways look Pepper levels at him was far too knowing, and he tunes back in enough to hear, “don't worry about him, Rhodey. I'll keep him on track, and he'll be fine. We'll see you at Christmas, and we can come visit you during spring break.”
“Tony,” he says, blinking the burn of tears gathering in the corners of his eyes away, “how can you possibly think you’re anything less than the incredibly courageous, infinitely strong, insanely smart, tremendously selfless, wonderfully loving, gorgeously beautiful man I see and married?”
Tony almost laughs. He's reminded sharply of the first day he met Steve, on the first week of their freshman year. Tony was the new spectacle at their school, the infamous Stark Industries heir whose name constantly appears splashed across tabloid covers with equal parts outlandish rumors and news of innovative tech projects.
“Okay!” Tony interrupts loudly. “That's enough of the Let’s Embarrass Tony Hour. Who wants cookies? I want cookies. I love cookies. It's cookie time.” He hops up off the floor and runs for the kitchen before anyone can reply, the sound of their laughter trailing after him like merrily ringing bells.
like the tone of his voice at all, “to tell Steve how glad I am you're both finally together. Anyways, Steve, did you know Tony has had a crush on you since—”
Natasha hums quietly to herself. “Maybe,” she says. “But you don’t have to do it alone. We’re all here for you.”
Tony discovers that the only sport he might potentially be better at than Steve is skiing. He's been skiing since he was a child with his parents in Aspen and the Swiss Alps on rare family vacations, and it’s Steve's first try.
A low simmering hunger claws at his belly, the feral side of him that only Steve can bring out coming to the surface as he watches his husband dress in the mirror. The gala tonight is important, but all priorities suddenly disappear when Steve looks so resplendent in his finery, all dark velvet and silk and gold.
Steve’s smile is still trembling at the edges, and so full of open joy it sets the butterflies in Tony's stomach into another frenzy. Tony's heart clenches in his chest, echoing his own happiness and excitement. For the billionth time, he wonders how he got so lucky and thinks wondrously back to how they even got to this point, to stand before each other now with their friends and family in witness on this day.
Tony spent a lot of dark nights in space with the universe crushing down on him while he drowned amongst the stars thinking about that day. Would he have regretted killing Barnes? At first, he had thought he wouldn’t, because he had thought it would’ve been justified vengeance for his parents. But the more time he spent with Nebula, the more his feelings on the matter shifted.
Tony sighs, the breath coming up from the tips of his toes to the top of his head, released in one long gust. “Yeah, fine,” he says, trying to inject lost cheer back into his voice. “Just SI stuff.” He waves his phone a little.
He pauses for a brief moment to try to swallow the lump in his throat again, blinking back the tears at the edge of his eyes. Steve is smiling encouragingly at him, and the sight bolsters him. “I guess this is the part where I promise to love you for the rest of my life through everything, to love and to cherish, to have and to hold. And I promise, all of it. I love you so much, and I'm going to love you for the rest of my life. We fought the universe to be together today, and I’ll do it again to keep you forever. This is a warning to the forces of the universe. Don’t try me. I’m going to keep you, Steve Rogers.”
Tony sighs, deflating and feeling lost all over again. He had wanted someone to be blindly anger on his behalf, but Rhodey, ever the voice of reason, had never been that person. It's more than he can bear at the moment.
“Let's get down to business,” Tony says brusquely before Steve can say anything else. “As I was saying, proposition. I think we can help each other, Rogers.”
There’s no reason for Tony to feel any way about seeing Steve with Peggy, and it’s certainly not his place to be upset or angry. He definitely has no right to feel as though he’s been kicked in the chest, his heart shattered from the force of the blow.
be clutched in Loki's hand now, mocking him that of course, his computers would never fail him but something as simple as
“I’m never going to surrender!” Tony says, feeling giddiness bubble up inside of him. The hysteria must be infiltrating his brain as it runs haywire from the overload of the tickling and Steve's warm weight bearing down on him. It's just too much.
Each drag of Steve’s cock sliding into him draws a deep moan from Tony’s throat. Steve has the perfect angle from the start, the head of his cock brushing against Tony's sweet spot with every downstroke. Steve’s hand is tight around the curve of his hip, holding him down against the chaise, and Tony has nowhere to move. He can only take it as Steve thrusts into him again and again, his toes curling against the towel beneath him as he’s overwhelmed with sensation.
Tony shakes his head and pointedly takes another bite. “Wow,” is all he manages to say, hoping fervently that Steve doesn’t notice how much this is affecting him, but Tony is sure that he can probably hear his heart trying to pound its way out of his chest. He turns away so Steve won’t see how fast he’s blinking.
“That you are, sir,” Jarvis says drily from the other side of the kitchen where he's preparing dinner. “I'm quite sure Mister Rogers will be amply impressed with your delicious cupcakes.”
“The one and only,” Tony had replied with a sarcastic salute, and admittedly in hindsight, that was probably dickish of him and only reinforced whatever rumors the others might've heard about him. Yep, there was definitely disdain in Barnes’s answering scowl. He didn't miss the answering glare Steve gave his best friend.
There’s a familiar sunspun gold. A swath of forest green. The warmth of pale skin. And almost always there, in the corner of his eye is deep blue, warm and achingly familiar. That’s what he wants the most, and he finds himself reaching towards it. But he’s always falling just short of touching.
The state championship game is the Friday before the start of Christmas break and the week leading up to the big event has the entire school abuzz with excitement. Everything is decorated with the team colors in garish swaths of red and blue and Steve can barely walk ten feet down the halls without someone clapping him on the shoulder and trying to give him a high five.
Rhodey looks like he’s about to say something else when Captain Rhodes shuts the trunk of their van with a click that sounds of finality and Mama Rhodes walks over to pull Tony into a tight hug.
“Okay,” Loki echoes. He gives Tony a weird look before reaching into his bag. “I received this in the mail this morning.”
They weave through the winding streets after leaving the shop, eventually losing the paparazzo after some sharp turns and calculated risks through narrow alleys. They end up having a quiet early dinner in a small restaurant with cracked plaster walls tucked between a florist and a butcher at the end of an unnamed street.
“Wanna come inside you,” Steve rasps, sounding wrecked, even though Tony’s the one who still feels the stretch of Steve’s cock in the crick of his jaw.
“Howard pays them enough in donations,” Tony reminds her, rubbing a hand over his burning eyes. “He basically funded this lab.”
They get lost in each other, pressed as close to each other as possible in the chair with Tony straddling Steve’s lap as they kiss. Steve’s big hands are already sliding underneath Tony’s jacket, brushing up the back of his sweater and pulling the hem from his pants to reach skin. The first touch of Steve’s palms against his sides sends a full body shiver down Tony’s spine and heats him to the core. Steve’s touch is reverent where he runs gentle fingers along his ribs, careful along Tony’s right side where his scars are raised and red and sensitive, heavy keloid ropes he’s still self conscious of on the bad days. But Steve’s touch always burns him from the inside out warm and slow, and he can’t help but feel whole in his embrace.
He shakes his head, feeling numb all over and almost misses seeing the hangdog look on Steve's face, like he actually thinks—like he actually thinks Tony doesn't feel the same way, like he's resigned to Tony rejecting him, like he believes Tony hasn't been thinking about him after that day in freshman year when they were fifteen and stupid and every day since. Like he ever stood a fucking chance—
Tony finds it comforting somehow to know Steve is sitting in the corner of his lab as he works and nibbles his way through the sandwich Steve brought. He doesn't even need the loud music when Steve is there. His mind is clearer than it's been in days and he goes back to his code with renewed energy, getting lost in the lines. He's resolved almost all the bugs by the time he raises his head again, hours later. There are only a few minor kinks left to fix. Maybe he should have Steve around more often.
After that, with Steve’s hands at his waist gently guiding Tony, they settle into a slow rhythm that slowly stokes the burning blaze between them. Tony bears down on Steve’s cock as Steve thrusts up into him, grazing against that starburst spot with each stroke. Tony can feel the pleasure building even without touching his own cock as he clenches around Steve’s dick, the weight of it heavy inside of him, filling him so full he can feel Steve
Now Tony doesn’t know anymore if he would’ve regretted killing Barnes, but it seems as though Thanos had done it for him anyways. And seeing Steve’s devastation over the loss of his best friend brings nothing but a hollow ring of emptiness for Tony.
“He’s too much,” Tony says. “He even walked me home. Who does that? Granted it was like ten blocks from that section of the park but still, Steve was all ‘it’s getting late. I want to make sure you get home okay,’ like yeah the Upper East Side is
“You can’t keep avoiding problems by kissing me,” Steve says, looking slightly dazed and his lips are pink swollen from the kiss.
“I do too,” Tony echoes. “Of course I do,” he says as Steve pulls him in for a gentle kiss, even before Rhodey pronounces them married.
“I would never stop you from anything,” Tony replies softly, reaching over to squeeze her hand. “Especially not anything that's paving the way for your world domination.”
The soft blue glow is a comfort in the dark of night when he wakes gasping for breath, hands immediately flying to his ribs, looking for a wound that’s already healed. His hands find the empty space on his sternum where his arc reactor had attached, gone now into the guts of the
Tony immediately sits up. “Who—” He stops when he sees Natasha’s expression, her beautiful face twisted with guilt and remorse. “Tasha—” he tries, his voice sticking in his throat as the realization overwhelms him. “Please,
. His hands scrabble for purchase along the wide breadth of Steve’s shoulders as he fucks Tony with his fingers, careful as always to stretch him enough to take his cock.
Tony almost considers making Happy turn around so he can go home and change when Steve spots the car and runs up to open the door for him. Tony thinks about ducking under Steve’s arm and booking it on foot anyways. He can’t believe he’s somehow managing to fuck up a fake date. He’s wearing an old Beastie Boys shirt that says “get off my dick,” in huge yellow letters on the back for chrissakes. To a children’s museum.
Bucky eventually comes around, and somewhere in the third week of knowing him, Tony realizes the spiky attitude is his way of trying to protect Steve from anyone who has the potential to hurt him. Tony wonders if Bucky would act the same way if he knew their relationship is fake. He reminds Tony just a little of Rhodey and in that moment, he misses Rhodey with a fierceness that burns. The guilt of not calling Rhodey and ignoring his messages bubble up high in his throat until he felt like throwing up but he forces himself to swallow that all down.
“It's been a bit weird to see people with their phones aimed at me whenever I turned around all day,” Steve continues. “A lot of the posts I saw in the couple of minutes I bothered to go online haven't really been flattering. Figured it would be good to escape for a bit and go outside, get away from the scrutiny for even an hour. It got overwhelming to be in there. Felt like I was surrounded, you know.”
Tony's smile widens and the butterflies settle a little more. “Wow, a twelve. Thank you, offspring. You can keep your inheritance after all,” he says, pulling Morgan in for a loud smacking kiss as she protests loudly about him messing up his newly applied lip gloss.
“This is my house, Barnes,” Tony replies primly. “I can make out with my boyfriend wherever I want.” He pulls Steve into another kiss for emphasis, exaggeratedly dragging his tongue across Steve's lips as Steve grimaces but gamely pulls him closer.
Tony laughs awkwardly and has to remind himself that his friends don’t know their relationship is fake. He can’t just blurt it out that Steve is too perfect and he’s too good for Tony even as a pretend boyfriend and Tony is in way too deep with this mess. Steve is too good for him, and that realization hurts like a bitch.
Tony considers not replying to that either but something makes him answer, “Yes, Pepper got a letter too.”
as his brain short circuits and completely fries again. He's reaching down and pushing his palm against Steve when a strong hand gently grips his wrist and stops him.
Steve surveys the field for a brief moment as he cocks his arm back, eyes roving the field to look for an opening. Tony is on the edge of his seat, waiting with baited breath, Pepper equally tense next to him. Even Loki and Nat are silent. The whole stadium is quiet as they watch Steve make the final throw with seconds on the clock.
Steve leans his cheek against the side of Tony’s temple, and takes him gently by the chin to tilt his head up until they’re staring back at each other through the mirror. He doesn’t move his hand until Tony stops trying to avert his gaze.
They all eventually nod off in pairs, heading to bed by the time the fire banks low in the hearth, and the only ones left by the fire are Tony, Steve, and Pepper.
“I think you're wrong,” Jarvis says mildly. “I am entirely of the belief that Steve has great affection for you. I'm most certain he loves you.”
to power them home. He breathes harshly in the pitch black as he fumbles for the flip phone on the nightstand and his panting breaths don’t slow he feels the familiar plastic between his fingers. He curls his grip around it, tight enough to hear the casing groan as he breathes.
“Oh, Tones,” Rhodey sighs as he pulls Tony into a long hug. He holds Tony tightly, rubbing reassuring circles into the middle of his back like he’d always done from their days at MIT to the later years through Tony's extensive recovery after the War. Tony calms almost immediately under Rhodey’s hand, even as the tears threaten to spill anyways. Rhodey smooths his palms down the front of Tony’s jacket again when they pull away and brusquely wipes a hand across his eyes.
“I hate all of you,” Steve mumbles, burying his face against Tony's neck. The shiver Tony feels traveling down his spine is a simple reflexive physiological response to stimulus on the sensitive skin of his neck, and nothing more.
Last year after he lost his mother, Tony holed up in his lab, working on one project or another for SI and doing his best to ignore the festive cheer and forget things like holidays and families exist for other people. Pepper and Rhodey had to pull him out of his work just to eat. Their saddened fondness was often more painful and unbearable than lack of family ever felt. He’s never really known what a holiday should feel like, but he thinks maybe what he has now is what the storybooks and movies are trying to sell.
Tony sighs, caving under Steve’s concerned frown as gentle hands brush the hair from his forehead. “Almost a week,” he mumbles, rubbing at his sternum.
And so, Tony had refused to do any of his writing homework. He gets sent home with a note that Friday, and his teacher is clever. She doesn't give it to Tony because she knows Tony is not to be trusted, she knows Tony would never show his parents. She makes sure Happy gets the note when he picks Tony up and Tony can do no more than scowl the whole drive home.
but the sound is on mute. He sits up as he yawns, tugging at Steve’s hand. His brain feeling like it's drowning in molasses and he struggles to stay awake. “There’s no way I’m making it back uptown tonight. Let’s go to bed.”
It’s a party and a wedding and it’s perfect. They’re surrounded by the people they love most, and Tony doesn’t stop smiling the whole night. His face is aching by the time Pepper kisses him on the cheek good night with Morgan in her arms, and he’s finally alone with Steve.
, flooding the darkened room with warm yellow light. They startle when they hear a throat clearing and Tony looks up with mounting horror to see a blond woman with Steve's eyes standing in the living room entry. Steve notices her at the exact same moment.
The feeling of Tony’s fingers closing around their cocks, slowly stroking them together is almost too much for Steve. Every touch along his skin feels electric as heat pools in his belly, the hollow of his chest feels aflame.
Tony is swimming in the jacket as he settles into his seat next to his friends now, the seam of the shoulders falling halfway down his biceps and the hem of the bright blue edge dropping down to his thighs. He tugs the sleeves over his palms, reveling in the way the leather and wool surrounds him, snuggling deep in its proffered warmth as he presses close to Pepper beside him.
Tony smiles and stands on his toes to kiss Jarvis on the cheek. “Pass that on to Ana for me, J. I'll come by day after Christmas.”
“He made us dress up in costume too,” Sam continues, pointing an accusing pickle at Steve. “And not just any costume! We had to make them. It's part of the experience, he says. I had to spend the entire weekend walking through giant crowds with enormous wings strapped to my back.”
“I'm glad,” Sarah says. “We all need someone like that. And I'm glad you have Steve now too, honey.” She pats Steve's hand and gives them both a warm smile. “But when I saw the both of you sitting together outside that office, scraped and bloody, clinging to one another, I knew it was only a matter of time. Took you long enough,” she says, directing this to Steve.
Over Morgan’s shoulder, Pepper is smiling and shaking her head. She’s a vision in emerald green, her bright hair twisted in a low chignon. Tony grins back as he meets her eyes, lifting his shoulder in a small shrug as Morgan finishes applying the pink gloss to his lips.
Too soon, Tony is teetering on the brink of coming, and still Steve is relentless with his strokes. Tony's throat is dry and he barely has the ability to form words, garbled sounds falling from his mouth that only vaguely resemble Steve’s name. He tries to tell Steve he’s almost there, but the only sound he makes is another loud, keening moan.
Steve, it turns out, is a pretty terrific fake boyfriend. Almost perfect, in fact, to the point where it’s unfair how great he is. He’s kind and considerate and observant and caring and he’s driving Tony insane.
He builds his first robot from the discovery channel engineering kit Jarvis and Ana gave him for Christmas, a box of mostly plastic building blocks and rudimentary circuit boards with a handful of blinking lights. It's a simple thing, but Tony has never been satisfied with simple. He doesn't really care to build a toy bot arm that swivels back and forth. No, he wants it to have fingers and dexterity, and he wants it to be able to close those fingers to pick things up.
“You've never built a fort before?” Steve asks, arranging a quilt atop a haphazard frame he made with the love seat and some kitchen chairs.
“The first five pages are a contract I had my lawyers draw up to include all the clauses of our agreement. And the very last page is an NDA. That’s the most important one.”
It takes three months, but Tony is so excited to show his father what he'd made by the time he's done. He has a plastic robot arm with three clunky fingers that can close around a small plastic ball and pick it up. It also has a set of remote controllable wheels and makes a beeping sound. He is so sure his dad will be proud of him. His dad has been going on and on about how Starks are supposed be strong and brilliant and clever and inventive. Here Tony is, inventing!
“Gee, thanks,” Steve replies with an equally fond smile in return, and he’s gladdened to see some of the joy returning to Tony as he stares back at Steve, the shape of his mouth a soft curve.
“She’s fine as far as we can tell,” Bruce says. “She wouldn’t exactly let us check. The only person she’s willing to talk to is Rocket, and that usually devolves into screaming matches. She’s been spending most of her time pacing the door outside your room the entire week while you were asleep, only leaving when Steve comes in—“
“Hey, Brucie,” Tony says, finding his own voice to be hoarse and sandpaper rough. He clears his throat. “Give it to me straight, doc. How long have I got?”
Steve catches his wrist as Tony gets to the corner of the block, his strong grip pulling Tony to a stop. “Please just let me explain. It’s not whatever it was you think you saw.”
Before Steve can reply, the shrill ding of an incoming message distracts Tony. Pepper must be very angry if she went through FRIDAY to bypass his dark mode to reach him. He leans over to dig through their pile of clothes for his phone while Steve tries to keep him from falling off their bed, letting out a tiny cheer when he finds the device.
fun. Instead, they're on a bus to the Poconos with the other seniors, headed towards a unchaperoned long weekend of debauchery, contraband alcohol and knowing some of their other classmates, lots of drugs. All under the guise of the student council taking them on a ski trip.
“Good, I can't wait,” Tony mumbles into his pillows. “No one cleans on a Friday night. We should be having a party. Or at the very least taking advantage of dear old dad being out of town and invading his liquor stores. Or doing lines of cocaine or something. Like our other classmates. Instead, we’re doing what? Cleaning my room. We’re so fucking boring.”
“Hey now,” Happy says quietly in warning, stepping between them to lay a firm hand on Steve’s shoulder. Tony shudders, twisting his wrist in Steve’s grip, but the hold is strong.
They've made it a habit to take the subway so Happy can have afternoons off when Tony goes to Steve's house, and he's loath to admit it, but he doesn't quite mind the train when he gets to spend an hour hugged in Steve's arms as a pretense of support.
Steve doesn't say anything for a long time. He looks like he’s chewing lemons. The coffee between his hands is cold now and he still hasn't touched the remaining half of his sandwich.
One day soon after camp ends, Janet skypes to tell him she met Hank Pym, and Tony knows he'll never have her.
“I will not have Iron Man disparage my gorgeous husband like this,” Steve replies with a smirk, his fingers lightly pinching at Tony’s side.
The equations suddenly line up in Tony’s head and the numbers fall into place. Time dilation. He knows before Bruce murmurs softly, “it’s been four years, Tony. You were gone for four years.”
It's as though the floodgates have been opened, and Steve is both incorrigible and insatiable. He takes every opportunity to kiss Tony. He would reel him in for a quick peck in the halls, and pull him into little niches and empty classrooms for longer presses of lips with tongue and teeth and wandering hands. Steve meets him every afternoon at his locker, and they go home together to spend quiet golden evenings in bed, loath to leave for anything at all.
On the fifth day, he skype calls Rhodey and tells him everything. Rhodey is the only one he can stomach talking to, because Rhodey isn’t physically there. Tony can hold himself together a little better when he’s only staring at a screen and a lagging image of his best friend. He can pretend he’s just telling an interesting anecdote and distance himself from the pain for a few minutes.
“Contrary to what people might think, Howard didn’t keep anything of yours in the house,” Tony continues. “His mission to find you was always top secret, but he would tell me about it. About how his greatest failure was never having been able to find you. He left it in his will that there would be a trust set aside to continue funding the search for your body, so you could be brought home. Howard wanted to at least give you that last service, so you could be buried in the country you fought so hard to protect.”
“I call people weird names all the time,” Tony protests. “How about snookums? Honeybunny? Sweetcheeks? Okay fine,” he concedes at the return of the Sullen Steve Stare. He swallows around the rest of the babble bubbling at the back of his throat. “Steve it is.”
Long fingers reach up to tangle in Tony's hair as gentle hands tilt his head slightly for the perfect angle, their mouths slotting together as Steve's tongue slips between the open seam of Tony's lips. Tony can feel broad hands brushing over the ladder of his ribs beneath his shirt, the touch like liquid fire against his skin. He gasps, every nerve alight with sparks as he tries to get as close as possible.
Tony’s words die on his tongue as he turns around to the vision of Steve as he steps out of their bathroom in a cloud of billowing steam. He drags his eyes along the very tall and very broad length of his husband, savoring the sight of a smiling half-ready Steve that knocks the breath from his lungs.
Tony’s heart is full to bursting by the time Steve is stripping quickly out of his own suit, letting the velvet and silk fall from his shoulders to be cast carelessly to the side, joining the growing pile of clothes. And finally, finally, Tony can run greedy hands over the illustrated skin of his husband, tracing along the birds captured mid flight at his throat, down to the roses blooming on his shoulder, to the letters TS on his sternum. To the radiant heart that belongs to Tony, and the very real beating one beneath the inked skin that belongs to him too. Tony pinches at Steve’s nipples, his fingers tugging at the barbell in one of them before sweeping his palms down the stretch of Steve’s arms curled around him. He reaches back to touch the Mark VII bracelets still circling Steve’s wrists.
“I had to almost fistfight Maria because she was really insisting that grey and black were a good color theme for
Tony gives as good as he gets, his hands already at work with Steve’s fly. He can feel where Steve is already hard against his thigh, and he presses his palm down against him as they kiss. When he finally gets Steve’s pants open, he’s drawing his cock out to stroke along the length just as Steve’s hand reaches his nipple and pinches them between his thumb and forefinger. Tony moans low in his throat and has to draw away from their kiss just to breathe, his heart working overtime in erratic stuttering beats.
Tony isn’t sure whether to scowl or smile like a fool, and he somehow ends up doing both. He’s sure he looks insane, but he can’t stop.
Tony sighs again. “I'm sorry for thinking otherwise,” he murmurs. “I'm sorry for not trusting you to be the mature one, because we both know we can't count on me to do that like ever, but I should've known you would've understood and made everything okay.”
“Tony, we need to talk,” Steve says, and Tony can hear the pleading desperation in his voice, but he has no interest in anything Steve Rogers has to say.
Tony is so eager to show his dad his creation, he runs into his father’s study the very night he finishes the final touches, the tiny bot cradled protectively in his arms. Here is the first bot Tony made, all by himself. It is his first taste of creation, and what a heady feeling it is, to make something that
He had some choice words for the oafs standing menacingly in front of him, and after the second time they called him a fag, he had yawned and calmly asked, “you got anything more creative than that, you singled-celled diatoms?”
“I know what can help!” she suddenly declares as she scrabbles out of Tony’s arms. He sets her down and she runs over to Pepper. Morgan whispers something in her mother’s ear as Tony watches on in amusement. With a long suffering sigh, Pepper reaches into her purse and hands Morgan a small pink tube. She walks back over to Tony with it gripped tight in her hand.
Tony can feel the way Steve is staring down at him with the wild look of desperation in his eyes, panic tensing the grip of his fingers. Tony turns slightly. He doesn’t want to look at him. He doesn’t want to see Steve’s expression, or hear whatever excuse he wants to say.
Natasha disappears for a week and comes home with Clint. His presence is a happy surprise but wholly unexpected, and Tony has long since thought maybe—maybe he didn’t make it. But there he is cradled protectively in Natasha’s arms, looking for all the world like a different man. His once sharp eyes are shadowed and his clever mouth clenched shut. Heavy sorrow dogs his steps, and Clint walks like he’s lost the world.
“Good morning, sleeping beauty,” Steve says as he pads across the rug to rummage for clothes in one of the suitcases and Tony is struck by how domestic it feels. How comfortable, and
Tony hesitates. “Me too,” he finally whispers. He finds that he means it, and in the space of the next breath, he forgives both Steve and Barnes. Understands them for who they are, and in the face of imminent death, what really is the point in holding such a grudge?
“And nothing ever will,” Pepper says, gently tipping his face to look at her with the pads of her fingers. “You have to trust me too, Tony, that I wouldn't have let you think the letter could've come between us. I knew then and still know now which letter was the only letter that was ever meant to be, and I'm
“Don't worry about it, Rogers,” Tony says, trying for levity. “It's not like you're the only one who got one.”
“Everything is exactly the way it's supposed to be,” Tony replies, pulling a blanket over his head. “I can find everything like this. Besides, we just survived the first week of senior year. It's nap time.”
“When I came out of the ice, I had no one, nothing. But you gave me a home. You gave me a purpose, a team, and a family. I cannot thank you enough for that, for giving me the things and people most precious in my heart, you yourself above all.
Earlier back at school, Steve had looked stunned when Tony met with the team to wave them off as they loaded onto the bus. He watched Tony with brightfire intensity, his eyes dragging a long line from Tony's head down to his toes. Tony was wearing Steve's old jersey instead of one of his usual tattered t-shirts, and he could see something like heated pride sparking in Steve's eyes, but that's probably his own delusion.
There's a lump in Tony's throat he has to work past to ask, “And what happens if you don't get one?”
The edge in Rhodey's voice all but screams that under no circumstances is Tony supposed to throw all of his hard work away, but how the fuck is he going to survive without his best friend? They grew up together, thick as thieves since they met in elementary school and now Rhodey is leaving and everyone is growing up and things are changing and nothing will be the same ever again.
Tony has already put her through so much—she deserves every happiness in the world. She deserves everything he was never able to give her.
Steve had always known he would be Tony’s forever. He had resisted the notion on the Quinjet a lifetime ago standing beside two gods, refusing to rise to the bait of a sad man wearing a mask that’s cracking at the seams far too similar to his own. He had been a coward in the dark of night in a farmhouse with danger rising with the morning sun on the horizon curve and their own unknowing destruction not far ahead. He had slunk away in shame and regret and sorrow in the cold tundra bunker in Siberia, his shield and soul left on the concrete floor with no hope for forgiveness, and no king’s share of gold could’ve been enough to seal the pieces of his heart back together again. He had thought he was too late when invaders fell out of the sky with a hail of fire and tar, and they all had to answer the call to arms the universe over, only to lose in the end, and he’d thought the other half of his soul was gone, gone, gone. His heart had broken when Tony stepped off of the Benatar and into Pepper’s arms, to move on away from Steve and cobble together the scraps of a life from the ashes, deserving of every happiness Steve could not give him.
Tony frowns. He realizes in that moment he’s never actually seen Steve’s room before despite the many times he’s been over at the Rogers house. They usually spend most of the time in the living room and then dinner in the kitchen before Tony goes home for the night. He wonders if the room is really as horribly messy as Steve claims, or if he’s hiding something. Like a Peggy shrine.
And Tony knows, the memory washing over him in a cold wave. Steve must notice because he puts a hand over Sarah's but she continues.
“You’re not too shabby yourself,” Tony quips, his shy grin easing into a lopsided and fond smile, an expression he saves for Steve alone. His eyes are warm dark amber in the low light of their room, the edges crinkling with the beloved laugh lines Tony had silently criticized in the mirror. This expression of his is Steve’s favorite.
“Tony,” Steve tries again, sounding breathless. There he goes saying Tony’s name with that tone again.
“Tony,” Nat sighs. “You have to stop torturing yourself like this. It’s not healthy for you to look at any of that nonsense.”
. Tony had asked FRIDAY to order them a myriad of foods, ranging from pizza to chicken wings and burgers and sushi and barbecue and tacos. There are donuts and cookies and petit fours and cupcakes. Some time after the food arrives, someone asks FRIDAY to play music, and soft pop ballads begin to play over the speakers. Steve and Tony hold each other close as they sway to the beat, their friends and teammates eventually joining them on the impromptu dance floor.
so when he’s wrong. So seeing Loki look unsettled wakes Tony up faster than the coffee, and he can't help but feel a chill crawl down his spine.
That night, Tony calls Howard and agrees to take the SI internship. Afterwards, he sits down with shaking hands and writes his fifth and last letter.
“Yes you are,” Steve agrees softly, sliding his fingers gently through Tony's hair. Tony leans back against his legs and tilts his head up for a kiss.
Steve doesn't refute that he's going to remove all of his limbs and throw him into a fifty-five gallon drum of concrete though, Tony notices.
“Because this is how the rest of the world lives, Tony,” Steve replies easily enough, but there's an edge to his words, sharp and jagged. “This is how I get to school. Not all of us are so privileged with cars and drivers and fancy houses uptown.” He pauses and looks back at Tony, his eyes softening. “I’m not going to let anything happen to you,” he says, his voice gentler now.
Steve looks like he wants to pull him into his arms and drag him away, their gathered audience be damned, and Tony is sorely tempted to let him. But then Rhodey is prompting Steve to speak.
There are five letters. They were written so long ago, when Tony was young and stupid and had dumb ideas about love. They were never meant to be read, never meant to be sent out. So now comes the million dollar question: how did Loki even get that letter? And if Loki has his—where are the other four?
“Did you even hear any of what I fucking said?” Howard demands as he begins to wind down. Tony can hear the clink and
“Tomorrow,” Tony whimpers, heat curling low in his belly as Steve's eyes darken instantly, pupils blown wide. Tony watches avidly as Steve wets his lips, eyes tracking the swipe of his pink tongue and the bob of his throat as he swallows, and that’s the end of his patience. He pulls Steve back in for another desperate kiss that's all slick tongue and clinking teeth and bumped noses, wet and messy.
“Gotta go in a few,” Steve murmurs sadly as he threads his fingers through Tony's sleep mussed curls. “It's getting late.”
Janet can keep up with Tony's rambling brain any day of the week, and her knowledge of quantum physics far surpasses his own. She's the only one who doesn't ignore him because he speaks in tangents and she leapfrogs with him from one subject to the next. She's not scared of his parents and what the Stark name means because her own family name weighs like a similar heavy yoke. She doesn't shy from the challenge of his pendulum moods, doesn't frighten because of his short temper and bouts of melancholy.
And just like that, Tony's mood sours and he's only vaguely aware that he's crushing the bag of popcorn in his hands and there's a rip at the bottom now and the kernels are falling out, they’re going everywhere, spilling onto the ground in front of him and Tony—Tony just wants to go home.
“I can't believe you avoided us for over two months for something so silly,” Pepper returns, not unkindly. She pushes his coffee into his hands and walks over to the closet to grab his coat. “Now let’s go, Happy is already waiting upstairs. I'm sure Steve is done with practice by now too. You’re going to properly introduce me to your boyfriend.”
“I don't know if you remember, Tony,” Sarah says when they sit down to eat the dinner they all prepared together. “But we met years ago, just once.”
“Aw, Rock of Ages, you wound me,” Tony pouts. “I thought I was going to be the trophy wife in this relationship. Since your dad has way more money than mine, and even after you split it with Thor, you can still be the sugar daddy here.”
Impossibly, Steve somehow catches his eye from across the field. Steve looks like he wants to run over and say something but his jaw clenches and he turns away when Tony doesn't bother lifting his head from Pepper’s shoulder.
“It wasn’t about propaganda or accomplishment for him, to have you home,” Tony continues. “He wanted to do it for you, and for Aunt Peggy, so she could have that closure. It was the one thing he wanted to do right.”
Tony thinks of the little doodles Steve draws in the corners of the folded notes he gives him every day telling him he's been thinking about him, wishing him luck during a test, and reminding him to eat when he gets too obsessed with his lab work to step away for lunch. They’re usually simple little stick figures and smiley faces, sometimes little doodles of hearts Tony rolls his eyes at but make him feel all too warm inside. Tony never really gave too much thought to the scribbles until now. Tony really wants to see what a fully finished drawing of Steve’s would look like. He would bet real money they look amazing.
“Never better,” Tony lies, reaching for Steve. He reels him in for a kiss to stop any more forthcoming questions.
Steve’s concerned face is enough to calm his rabitting heart slightly, and he presses a shaking hand to his chest. Tony doesn’t even realize he’s gasping for breath until Steve is rubbing his back, murmuring in a soft apologetic voice barely audible over
Tony doesn’t realize he whispers the name until Nebula relaxes marginally next to him as he slumps down, the black dots seeping into the forefront of his vision. Her strong hands are gripping his shoulder, fingers digging in painfully, but all Tony can focus on is
Tony blinks rapidly, the emotions all rushing up at once. There’s a mix of overwhelming awe with a healthy dose of disbelief and then the painful thought that outside of Jarvis, Pepper and Rhodey, no one else has ever cared this much if he eats or not.
Tony is probably hyperventilating, he isn't really sure, but there are black spots dancing at the edge of his vision and there is a long arm pulling him against a soft chest, and it is Pepper, thank god Pepper is still going to be with him for senior year, damn Rhodey for being a whole year ahead of the both of them, goddamnit, he should've applied for early graduation, why didn't he do that, he could've hacked the system to change that old failing grade in freshman Phys Ed, the school records are a fucking joke, he totally could've done it if he was able to get into the Pentagon after a couple of hours that one time when Reed Richards dared him, the school system will be nothing in comparison, and besides most security systems nowadays are a fucking joke, and if he had changed his dumb grade, he wouldn't have had to waste time on another whole fucking year—
so very desperately, everything aches with the intensity of what he feels for Steve, wishing fervently for any truth in Steve’s words. But it’s just sex and Tony is smart enough to know that sex doesn't equate love, no matter how carefully and affectionately Steve handles him. Tony is also smart enough to know with unquestionable certainty that Steve does not love him, and likely never will, but it's nice to believe it for just a moment when Steve is inside him and whispering his name so reverently.
Tony’s hands tremble as he reaches up for the arc reactor in his chest. His fingers press against familiar warm metal, and his nails clatter against the casing, the familiar staccato beat a small comfort.
It’s tense seconds before the tall figure clears the shadows of the tree line and steps into the light of the wane moonlight and Tony falls to his knees then. The unexpected relief floods him so strongly, he doesn’t have the strength to hold himself upright.
, because if they had gotten any closer with no working comms, the Compound’s security system would’ve read the
They should probably have an actual conversation, but even the thought of talking about it is more than Tony can bear, and so he resorts to using physical intimacy like a weapon. If Steve catches on to Tony’s distraction tactics, he doesn’t say anything about it. The first couple of times, he gives Tony a wry look, but he seems to be all too happy to drop the conversations too when there are much better things to do with his mouth.
“You should've stopped me from running,” she insists with a loud sigh, but her expression turns gentle as she looks from Steve to Tony, a little smile playing at the edge of her lips.
“You can't possibly go empty handed,” Jarvis had said earlier that day as he pulled ingredients from the fridge. “I will not allow it. It is rude after Miss Rogers has so graciously invited you to spend the holiday in her home. Now kindly get out of my kitchen. I have not yet forgotten about your green cupcake debacle, and you are absolutely not allowed to touch anything here.”
“This,” Steve says, following the path down his prosthetic arm, skin warmed metal and gently humming circuits, “is your brilliance. Your incredible mind and your perseverance. Nothing can stop you.”
“Steven draws comic strips of us as a group of superheroes who save the world together in his spare time,” Thor says. “You should show Tony your drawings sometime. They're terrific!”
“I’m sorry for everything,” Steve says, insistent. “I’m sorry for what happened between us, and I’m sorry for not listening. About the invasion. About what was to come.”
“Archery is great,” Clint says, shrugging unapologetically. “It's really builds your arms and core.” He flexes to show his admittedly impressive biceps and strikes a ridiculous pose, grinning playfully at Tony as he waggles his eyebrows. Tony has to bite back a laugh as Steve's arms tighten around his waist.
Yep, Tony nods numbly. The plan. Yes. The plan. The one they've had since childhood. Eight whole years now. Pinky promised and everything. Stick to the plan.
“It's just SI stuff,” Tony finally says. “Just crap Howard wanted me to build and it's not even working properly right now, the code is a mess and I'm still trying to figure out the right components. It's not really good enough to talk about yet. It's not done or anything. It's really boring,” he finishes lamely.
She holds up a hand to stop him and says, “Honestly, Tony. It’s been two months and you’re already falling apart without me.” Her stern look melts away into a fond smile that makes Tony weak at the knees.
He heaves a great sigh and does the only thing he can think of to avoid the Pepper conversation. Just as she's rounding the corner, he reaches out and grabs the front of Steve's shirt with both hands and drags him forward. Steve yelps in surprise as Tony forcibly brings him closer. Before he can rethink it, or give it any thought at all, he's pulling Steve in and standing up on the tips of his toes and he's
Tony curls his hand against the nape of Steve's neck, fingers twining around the short strands of Steve’s sweat drenched hair. He whimpers softly when Steve tightens his grip, pulling him flush until there's no space between them. The hard plastic of Steve's sports armor digs painfully into Tony's ribs, but it's all white noise drowned beneath the feeling of Steve's lips against his own.
Tony tucks his face into the crook of Steve's shoulder and sighs. “I'm—better now,” he says, honest.
Jarvis smiles sadly as he places a plate of cookies in Tony's hands. “Lies are unbecoming of you. Now I believe your friends are waiting,” he says. “Also, do visit us after Christmas when you have the time. Ana has been complaining about how she hasn't seen you in nearly a year. We don't only exist on birthdays and holidays you know,” he chides.
Peter had laughed as he took their photo, even as Tony griped, “wow, that was lame, Rogers,” because that was the best comeback he could manage at the time, secretly loving the dumb clichés Steve liked to use. They had smiled goofily at one another and there was warmth swelling in Tony’s chest until he thought he was going to burst with the affection he had felt for Steve in that moment. He had barely managed to turn back in time for Peter to catch his smile for the camera as Steve nosed a kiss against his jaw.
On the sixth day, Saturday, he spends a day in his lab, barely able to eat, and drowns himself in work. He’s fine until he isn’t. It’s a wire that finally tips him over the edge. A red wire that would not cooperate with him, and the rage boils over from one second to the next. He hurls the motor he spent hours working on across the room, relishing in the way it breaks against the concrete floor.
Steve laughs softly, shifting them both to lay more comfortably on the narrow cushions. “You clearly do. Stop pouting.”
sound sorry, like he feels bad that Tony isn't going to get a happily ever after but Tony has long gotten used to that idea already, and he does not need Steve Rogers pitying him.
Tony curls up happily against Steve's side as the opening credits start, feeling safer and braver in the dark. It's almost instinctive by this point for Steve to wrap his arm around Tony's shoulders and Tony decides definitively that the space between Steve's side and Steve's old couch is the most comfortable spot in the world.
“Tony!” Steve cries out after him, but Tony ignores him, walking faster. He bursts out of the school doors and all but runs towards where Happy is parked, desperate for a quick escape. Happy is waving cheerfully at him before he sees the expression on Tony’s face, and he immediately switches to protective mode, moving around the car to get the door open.
Nebula had dedicated herself to seeking vengeance against a titan who had taken away not only her family but her life and her limbs, and she had nothing to show for it but bitterness and the regret of having aimed that bitterness at her sister.
“Let’s hope this was a fluke,” Loki says with false cheer neither of them believe. Dread settles heavy in Tony’s belly as Loki tries valiantly to comfort him. “Perhaps I was the only one who got my letter.”
“Three more hours?!” Pepper exclaims. She sighs, and Tony can hear the exasperation in her voice. “You're working way too hard, Tony. It's unhealthy.”
Tony clutches at his chest dramatically. “Ouch, you wound me. I’ll have you know I’m an incredible catch. Brains as well as beauty. And an inheritance to a weapons company with a buffet of stock options all bundled up in one amazing package. Military liaisons sold separately.”
“You never were very good at listening,” Tony says, trying to keep his voice light. “Not one of your stronger traits.” He almost regrets the words, he’s not sure how Steve would take them.
Steve huffs a sigh but there's a smile pulling up the corner of his lip and laughter dancing in his eyes. “First,” he says, in the obstinate tone that Tony's grown to love, “it's gross that we’re talking about my mom knowing anything about my sex life. Second, it doesn't mean we should confirm her suspicions.”
That doesn’t make Tony feel any better or worse. All of the rage and sadness empties out of him in a rush as his stomach sinks to his knees with the quiet settling of everything. He just feels numb.
Tony hesitates for a moment before he replies. He sees no reason to hide anymore, not if what he fears is true. If the letters had gotten out, Loki will find out sooner or later anyways.
Tony doesn't quite know what to say to that, but his chest freezes cold at the thought of Steve enlisting. It's the same cold feeling he gets when he thinks of Rhodey's future in the Air Force, when his best friend will be overseas and there will be nothing Tony can do to protect either of them. He thinks of his father's weapons, and the words bubble up to beg Steve to never consider something like that, but it's not his plea to make. He can easily pay Steve's tuition to any college he likes but he knows Steve would never take his money. Not strong independent Steve who works hard for everything he has. It would be insulting to even offer.
