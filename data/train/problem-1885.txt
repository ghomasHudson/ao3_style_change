Acid churned in Sherlock's stomach the entire ride to Baker Street. Ella's terrified cries echoed around the halls of his mind palace, so he couldn't even retreat to there. How was he to protect her now? She was alone, without connection to the remaining few people she trusted. He knew logically she would gain trust of whatever insipid adults she was placed with, but how could Sherlock know that for sure? There was always a possibility that she would be placed with a family that didn't treat her with the care and attention she needed.
"Because of you and your lack of divulgence, this innocent infant is without parents, lost to a faulty adoption system. Where she's likely to just end up right back with drug users, this time not recovered. If not already killed by your partner instead."
The lack of praise stung a bit. (Sherlock was waiting, but John's compliments were still down by 20% since the fall.) "Yes, that's the most important piece of information. Well spotted." He snapped.
Sherlock continued carding his fingers through John's sandy hair. He felt a twist in his stomach at John experiencing such pain, and sick that taking on this case was probably the cause of it. His nightmares had mostly seceded, and it was obvious to him that this case was a trigger for their return. With this guilt, he couldn't lose himself in the feeling of John holding onto him. He wished more than anything John would just choose to do this instead of needing it as an anchor for staving off a panic attack.
Not to mention the families and friends of all the victims. Eleanor in particular. At least the others didn't have a whole human depending on them for everything.
Sherlock smelled Mrs. Hudson's perfume and noted that she must have come back from her sister's while they were out.
He shook himself out of his reverie and noticed the food was finished being cooked and the two men were settled at the table with plates in front of them. John raised his eyebrows at him, silently asking him to eat something too. Sherlock reached over and stole a small piece of bacon from John's plate and ate it quickly. John rolled his eyes.
Sherlock's brows furrowed and John chuckled. He pulled Sherlock to a sitting position and removed his socks and shoes for him. He could sense Sherlock staring at him, causing the back of his neck to burn. He felt embarrassed and that this was a bad idea, but there was nothing for it. He made it this far, he was a soldier, he would see it through.
"What kind of sociopath kisses their landlady, offers to help an invalided soldier, and worries about said soldier's mental health? Just during our first day together, might I add."
The rest of the day and part of the evening, Sherlock could tell John wanted to say something. Something he felt was important, but difficult to talk about. He observed the tension in John's shoulders and slight crease in his forehead. Whenever John thought Sherlock wasn't looking, he would stare at him, open his mouth like he would speak, then close it again. After most of the day consisting of this behavior, Sherlock was at his wit's end over not having deduced what exactly it was.
John moved closer and spoke again, calmly and softly. "Sherlock, can you take a breath in while I count? In one, two, three, four, five. Out one, two, three, four, five, six, seven." He kept the repetition going and eventually Sherlock must have heard him and tried following along because his breathing grew less rapid and his fists slowly relaxed. They did this for around five minutes before Sherlock abruptly looked panicked and fled to the bathroom.
He unswaddled the now restless baby and made quick work of the nappy, and set the dirty one aside for now. They would need a proper rubbish bin for them, otherwise, they just had the regular bin which contained no odor eliminating properties. The thought stalled John for a second, who then wondered why they never had one in the first place. He constantly had to take out the trash when it was barely full due to Sherlock's disposed of organic matter and noxious substances. It was a chemistry professor's worst nightmare.
This time he keyed u[ the song I bet YOU Loook Good On The Dance Floor by ARctive Moknekts , and before he hit play, he inserted coins into the second player slot.
Sherlock looked over it silently, so Mrs. Hudson piped up. "Thank you, dear, would you like to meet Eleanor?"
Sherlock began rocking the baby when her whimpers hadn't died down on their own. He swayed his arms to a slow tempo, the same he used when composing songs that remind him of John. She stared into his eyes, seemingly captivated by this stranger, and was coaxed back into sleep. Then he heard John call his name, evident from his tone that this was not the first time it was called.
Frustrated with the case (and himself if he was being honest, which he wasn't), he stomped down the stairs and into Mrs. Hudson's flat. His eyes quickly observed that they were having tea at the dinner table and fresh scones.
It was unacceptable. The whole thing. And as much as he tried justifying his anger at her departure solely on the rapid environment changes, he couldn't deny that he was angry because he missed her. He wanted her back, and maybe that wasn't such a terrible idea. He couldn't trust anyone with her care and already did the research. So why not?
And Sherlock kept saying, "I shouldn't need practice. I know all of the logistics and have higher than average dexterity, there is no logical sense behind this being difficult."
Once inside the unntyle. everyheitn was black and ark. I've never been inside onw so i have noidea how they look.
THey kept going untli eventiualy Sherlck gasped-yelped-came on his stomach and the clencing of the mucles in his arse pushed John oaver the edgel as well.
I wasn't sure where to go from there other than ending the story. The bit with therapy was meant to be an in depth introspection on Sherlock's psyche and I wanted a realistic portrayal of healthily dealing with one's mental illness and interpersonal problems. The therapist character was based off of my favorite psych professor, I miss her a lot lol. I'm also a psych major so using what I learned for this portrayal was important for me.
Mrs. Hudson sat on the couch with Ella while Sherlock sat next to her with a spreadsheet open on his laptop. If they passed the process, each person would be scored on different categories and the one with the highest number of points would be hired. The categories included availability, personality, preparedness for emergencies, knowledge, Eleanor's receptiveness to their presence, and other factors.
Their eyes met, and though nothing was said, John's gaze was like a momentary balm on the chaos in Sherlock's mind.
The determination was futile at the moment. Every few paragraphs his mind and gaze wandered back to Sherlock. They both grew rather fond of Eleanor in the time she was with them. She wrapped her little hands around their hearts and pulled until they were sufficiently under her spell.
Several times during this process, John made a comment. "Is this really necessary? I don't mind switching off guard duty with you. I was a soldier remember?"
Sherlock's forehead creased in confusion, "This behavior is not characteristic of me, how could you possibly have guessed this?"
Beyond the body on the floor, it was apparent that a struggle had taken place. Lamps, books, and pillows were strewn about. The coffee table was also definitely knocked out of alignment with the sofa. Sherlock was combing the room for things Anderson's team would miss.
Eleanor cries grew quieter and eventually ceded entirely. She couldn't keep her eyes open and yawned a final time before letting sleep pull her in.
John huffed a small laugh, "He'd only do that by accident, you still used that big brain of yours." He smiled softly at Sherlock and gave his hand one final squeeze before letting go.
The man finished unlocking the doors and allowed the two entry behind him. Motion sensitive lights flickered on on their own as the man, Mr. Evans going by the nameplate on the desk, took a seat and fired up the computer.
Part of Sherlock wanted to complain about John acting that way toward others, and the other part wanted to kiss him for making the idiot secretary willing to cooperate. When doctors and therapists began coming in for the day, Sherlock left John to wait for the patient list and started meeting with each individually.
Sherlock parades back in forth in front of them for a hot minute before John iterrupts ans says "that's enough, drama queen."
Mrs. Hudson coddled the baby while Sherlock and John put all of the new supplies they purchased away. They didn't need to make much extra space for Eleanor's things, however, that would change the older she got. For now, they simply had to clear off counter space in the kitchen, clear out a couple drawers in the bedroom. The final touch was setting up the video monitor in a way that angled it at the cot. John hoped it would be broken and therefore postpone the sleeping arrangement change, but as expected, it worked perfectly.
"He doesn't have a password John. What kind of moronic murderer doesn't keep a password on their computer?" He looked seriously disturbed by this.
Lestrade must have noticed them in the doorway because he appeared in front of John, blocking his view of Emmett. His eyes held sympathy and frustration both. He opened his mouth and Sherlock cut him off.
But he would try and remind himself of John's words. And maybe let him know when he's having a danger night. He felt he owed John the honesty, but he also knew John would help him through it. As for John never leaving Baker Street, he hurt too much to think about the truth. So he let himself, just for tonight, to believe that John meant it because Sherlock was as vital to him as he was to Sherlock. To believe that John meant Sherlock fulfilled his needs in a life partner. And loved him in all the ways Sherlock loved him.
"Lestrade does, and so does Mycroft. It wouldn't have taken long to check, but the name is unimportant to us now."
There he saw the curly headed boy and some greasy haired, bug eyed frat boy staring at each other. John's crush wa s standing there trying to look indifferent but faililng , and the greasy guy was grinning like he just kicked somone's puppy.
He spent the night before tracking John's sleeping pattern and knew John should enter the REM stage after about an hour and a half after falling asleep. Once in that stage, Sherlock would move closer to him. Not touching, but close enough that John would feel his body heat and hopefully subconsciously react to it and move forward to wrap his arms around Sherlock. Sherlock reasoned it wasn't taking advantage because he wasn't the one initiating contact.
John sensed Sherlock stiffen beside him, so he leaned over until their shoulders were pressed together.
Sherlock knew he wasn't able to hide the flash of hurt that flit across his face at Mycroft's words. And it seemed John saw it. He sat in his chair, violin now on the ground, with his hands trembling slightly. Mycroft was right, and he hated him for it. For throwing his own fears back in his face. He knew Mycroft was just trying to get him to give up this whole 'charade' but it wasn't fair.
The silence of earlier this morning made a reappearance for the next couple hours. Sherlock was about ready to resign himself to waiting for another murder victim when John suddenly sat up straight and the sound of clicking and typing sped up. One didn't have to be Sherlock to deduce what that meant.
Sherlock closed his eyes. If only John knew how accurate that was. After meeting John, he didn't know if he'd survive going back to a time without him. The thought of going back to John was the only thing that kept him alive during his two years away. His thoughts were broken up by that very man.
About twenty minutes later, and to their relief, Emmett answered the door of his cheap flat. "Mr. Holmes? What uh-"
Sherlock hummed and steered him towards the door. John supposed he would be eating in the taxi then, ceramic mug and all.
The song began and the two followed the arrowed beat.s Sherlock was beteer obviously but John tried his best. They kept going, John being seduced more and more by Sherlock and and Sherlock seduced more and more by John's charming inability to dance.
"The names are in alphabetical order, but if you rearrange them in chronological order from when they sought out treatment, the murders follow it exactly." He leaned close to John so they could both peer at the paper. He definitely wasn't distracted by John's cologne.
John didn't want to picture a devastated Sherlock, but he couldn't help it. Unable to stop himself, he placed a hand on Sherlock's chest. "Sherlock, you don't think that was your fault do you?"
Mrs. Hudson didn't comment and everyone acted as if John hadn't said what he just said. Sherlock's body was still malfunctioning, more so now. What did that mean? Why would John say that? It could be completely platonic, but what if it wasn't. No, John would never feel that way toward him and it'd be best not to entertain that possibility.
Mrs. Hudson was done waiting for a response. "You two drive me mad, and not with the messy flat." She kept muttering to herself as she walked up the stairs. "Men, hopeless, the whole lot of them."
He looked at Sherlock, but Sherlock's face was an unreadable mask besides the slight downturn of his mouth. He didn't know what to do and distractedly noticed his hand was grasping the elbow of Sherlock's coat.
Sherlock visibly relaxed and his heart rate climbed back down. With one last boost of courage, he lifted a hand out of the water and rested it on the edge of the tub and closed his eyes.
Sherlock rejoined the other two in the living room a short while later, now clad in pajamas and his blue silk robe. John handed him tea that was still warm, he must have guessed Sherlock would be out soon. He grabbed his laptop and set it on the floor, then placed the baby toys in a neat line.
John suggested sectioning the interrogations into covering those who were scheduled to work at the center today versus those who were scheduled on other days. They made it through several staff members, some being discredited immediately by being on maternity leave or out of the country during the time of the murders. To John, they made progress. To Sherlock, they didn't make nearly enough progress.
John feared their nightly routine for bed would be awkward. It was one thing to admit to each other in the bravery that only night provides, that they needed the other's presence to sleep. And another thing entirely to do so in the day.
At this, the gresasy guy, moriaryt, gto scared at Joh'n's face and obvious muscle mass and left without another worsd.
And sure enough, they heard footsteps and then her door opened, as she must have heard them come in.
UPDATE: Chapter 6 is now past 2000 words and still going, but I'm working on it every day so hopefully it'll be ready soon.
was adorable, not the baby. He cleared his throat and refocused his attention on the tiny human in his hands.
John quickly caught on and smiled his best honeymoon phase smile at his 'fiancé,' which frankly wasn't that hard.
Sherlock plopped the nappy bag unceremoniously on the floor by the couch while John went straight upstairs to his own room. He came back down and explained to the others.
Sherlock woke slowly, enveloped in warmth and the smell of John. This brought him to the realization that they were still holding each other,
"Yes. That's why I'm frustrated, John. Our man has more than one brain cell apparently. He must have used one of those random character generators for the password, because it certainly has nothing to do with his life."
John pictured a happy kid Sherlock, running around and crawling through the dirt with a bucket to put worms in.
John placed a hand on top of Sherlock's, the one supporting Eleanor's head. "I disagree. Between the two of us, we know as much as the average new parent. We're okay."
Sherlock scowled at the reminder of Eleanor's imminent departure. What did that matter? He still needed to do his best, especially after all he
A few minutes later, he heard the springs of John's bed upstairs and then subsequent padding of socked feet down the stairs and through the hallway. Sherlock remained still while the door opened, and presumably, John walked in.
After two hours and no news, Sherlock had progressed to laying on the couch in a fetal position, still fully clothed including shoes. John couldn't bare just sitting around any longer. He felt worse about how Sherlock felt than he did about the killer still running about. He thought he should probably feel more guilty about that.
At Scotland Yard, the trio garnered many double takes. Donovan would never believe in a million years that she would one day see Sherlock Holmes walking around with a human baby strapped to his chest, looking for all the world like it belonged there. Sherlock strode through the halls with a sense of grace and both hands placed on the carrier in an act of support that wasn't actually needed. There were definitely pictures covertly (not really) taken.
John held up his hands. "Alright, but also if we think we've happened upon someone dangerous we call for backup. Every. Time."
On the couch laid Sherlock, but he wasn't alone. The small sleeping body of an infant laid on his chest with a bee firmly caught in the grasp of a tiny hand. It had to be Ella.
John couldn't judge his tone, and certainly not his face in the darkness. John scratched the back of his neck, "'Course you do."
"How did you know I slept with you?" The connotation of those words brought a flash of embarrassment to him.
This was an absolute roller coaster to write, idk how it was for you all! I hope Sherlock sounded in character for this, let me know if you have any suggestions to correct any ooc-ness? He's my soft boy.
Waking John from his nightmares was far from a new thing, but he'd never done it while in the same bed. Wary that John could mistake him for an attacker, Sherlock didn't touch him and instead called out to him.
John stifled his bark of laughter with a fist as they entered Sherlock's bedroom and began rearranging.
I didn't stumble upon it accidentally either. A good six months ago when I was still in the outlining stage and struggling to choose a good nickname for Eleanor, a friend suggested Ella, which they had gotten from the title of this song.
John was still hesitant, but he couldn't deny the relief he felt at seeing Ella resting once more against Sherlock earlier. It looked right and felt right. She already belonged with them, by some strange coincidence. And he didn't doubt for a second that Sherlock would be able to provide Ella's emotional needs. I could think of a lot of people that would, but he saw Sherlock for who he really was. Someone who was incredibly selfless and gave everything to the people they cared for and expecting nothing in return. Loyal to a fault and willing to give everyone a chance. Only when people ruined that chance by treating him like a freak by default did he turn cold toward them.
wasn't. I couldn't be there, so I'm telling you now. You're never going to be alone again. The fall was the last time, I promise you."
It was still morning when they got in bed, so John could only laze around for a few hours before his traitorous stomach signalled hunger. It growled audibly and he groaned into Sherlock's shoulder blades. He didn't want to leave their cocoon of comfort, but neither of them had eaten anything all day.
Sherlock opened his own box and picked at some of the curry covered chicken. He sighed when he noticed John glaring at him and deliberately put a bite in his mouth, raising his eyebrows to say, "happy?"
The door was frosted fflass, but since John was in the shower theres was nothign to see besides the vagues dark shape of clothe ing on the flor.
He instructed John to lay Ella into the small wooden cot which they had positioned in front of the foot of Sherlock's bed. John, too defeated by the incessant crying, did as asked without question.
The receptionist assured them that Eleanor wouldn't be in foster care very long, as there were many couples looking to adopt infants. It wasn't reassuring.
Sherlock waved one of his hands, "We'll cross that bridge when we get to it." It was funny, in a sad way, that John thought he would still be living here when Eleanor was a toddler. That was more than enough time for John to find a stable girlfriend he would leave Baker Street for.
"Oh, well in that case, thank you." He placed a kiss on Eleanor's forehead and laid her down belly first on the blanket, then moved to sit on the couch nearby so he could keep an eye on her.
"Don't be an idiot...I need to speak with him," and through gritted teeth, "Fine." He hung up and threw the phone onto the bed then mussed his hair in frustration.
For the next half hour, Sherlock performed the experiment and recorded his observations in the spreadsheet on his computer. He counted how many times Eleanor reached for each toy to begin with. Then he held up each toy within her reach and pulled it away before her tiny fingers grasped it. He noted how annoyed that made her and internally marveled at how expressive she was. He concluded that the yellow plush bear was her favorite and rewarded her patience.
Because of this and the recent resolution to the case, he was ready to confront John about the unspoken tension between them. It seemed like anger John still held towards him about the fall. But sometimes the tension seemed like the moment before two people kissed for the first time. Maybe there were two separate issues. He'd have to tread carefully because he absolutely did not want to get his hopes up with the second thing. He was already lacking in emotional intelligence, he didn't need to make things harder for them by revealing his desires only to have them not reciprocated.
The silver haired man stepped in and leaned his hands on the table, looking between John and Sherlock. "I need to know what details can be released to the public. We have almost nothing, but maybe putting it out there that drug users are at risk would make people more cautious. Or it would encourage our killer to get cocky, now that there's limelight."
Emmett picked Eleanor up from the floor and bounced her a bit on his hip. "It's all good, your landlady made scones to hold me over. She's very nice."
In Sherlock's head, he could see Ella crying and missing this toy. He didn't think she would be handed off so quickly. He thought they had more time, they would have packed a bag for her. Now she was starting over with new people and new objects
There were too many bags to carry back to the flat, so Sherlock texted Mycroft to send a car for them. When it pulled up to the curb, Anthea stepped out to help transfer the bags inside. Not before greeting the little girl, though.
He decided to play it casual, not let on that he stayed because of their position, but instead stayed because he was tired.
Emmett breathed a huge sigh of relief. "We're going to be okay baby girl." He brought her to his face and snuggled his nose against hers, letting the stress of the past few days dissipate.
The flatmates ate in comfortable silence, broken only by the babbles of the baby sat in Sherlock's lap.
Hands slammed on the metal table along with the metallic clank of the cuffs. He spoke with quiet conviction, "They all deserved to die. They would have hurt other people."
Sherlock just received a text from Lestrade, requesting his assistance at the latest crime scene, as he walked back into Baker Street. He ran out of body parts in the middle of the night and walked around London instead of waking up John. (Last time he woke John before 7am without a case, he was yelled at and did not want a repeat.) However, now that a case
"But we kind of did. Our address is online, which is fine for regular clients, but sometimes we get the occasional revenge visit."
He stopped speaking though the story wasn't over. John tried to give him a push to finish it by scooting closer until Sherlock could definitely feel his body heat.
Sherlock agreed about the theoretical knowledge but didn't have the energy to argue about what exactly Mycroft was implying. So he changed the subject. "Hand me my phone."
That night, when they went their separate ways to bed for the first time since the case started, there was a lingering moment in which they both stared at each other after uttering "goodnight."
Sherlock nodded once and the two made their way back to the main room. John stood off to the side where Lestrade was overseeing the investigation and tried examining the room without looking too closely at Emmett's body. No point in removing a person if they're already dead.
Sherlokck takes the flecks out of the evidence bag with tweezers and sets then on a petri dish. Unsure what they are, he suspends them in a general distelled watwers solution. He separates scales out (that much he can tell, they are scales) so he can test different things on them.
John got into his usual side (when had it become his?) and said goodnight for the second time. This time though, it was accompanied by a smile.
him. Wait, no, one had to stay in the living room at all times of the night. That wouldn't do. He could easily come up with ways in which both would be able to sleep in the bed and also be alerted of any intruder. Something important nagged at him though, just poking at the back of his head.
Though Sherlock still felt he deserved any ill will, he conceded to John's command to make him happy. "Fine, it's- I accept."
John leaned back against the couch and let himself process all of that before speaking. "You really did think about this."
Sherlock placed his hand on the small of John's back and moved closer to him. "Hi, don't tell me we missed Logan?"
((No joke this was like 3 months after writing this fic, while in that very inebriated state I gasped and had an epiphany that I could write my first sex scene ever.)) BUT WAIT THERES MORE , hello this is me again , Iaccidentally drank on an empty stuomach and it feels like a very different kind of drunk. Point is imma write this bitch.
Sherlock started walking toward the street, but was halted by John grabbing his wrist. He turned around to face him. He could see concern written in the creases of his forehead and slight downturn of his mouth.
"For years, Redbeard was by my side, always. We explored the whole estate to collecting things I deemed important for experiments."
Sherlock nodded and John helped pull him up off the floor. John fetched him a glass of water while he brushed his teeth and the two met up in the hallway. Sherlock looked at his room where the cot was in view from their position.
He blew his nose in the tissue and nodded. "We all went to the same one, London Rehab, it's how come we went to the same NA meetings, because the doctors there all told us to."
Sherlock was pacing back and forth and muttering to himself in the foyer of Brown's flat building. He wasn't allowed in until the police completed the official search, after all he was only a consultant. But that left him moody and impatient. He'd already checked on Emmett and Eleanor's status at Baker Street, so there literally wasn't anything to do.
Sherlock knew he was referring to the interrogation. "Yes, I was trying to be intimidating and it worked."
"This is the work of a serial killer Mr. Wilson, your information will prove invaluable to the search I'm sure."
Meanwhile, Sherlock was sitting in the center of his bed with his arms wrapped around himself. He knew he probably could fall asleep without John, but he didn't want to. He even tried holding the sleeping Eleanor to get that human connection, but it wasn't the same. He wondered if John felt the same.
"Oh." Sherlock's face heated, but thankfully John couldn't see due to the dark room. He cleared his throat, "Lestrade's officers arrested him just now. He won't let us go down and see him until morning, and even then I'm not allowed to interrogate him."
John informed Emmett and went to remove the night's DIY burglary alarm. He'd already gotten dressed before making breakfast, as some attempt of distancing himself from the way he woke this morning. He woke exactly as he'd constantly imagined, enveloped in Sherlock's warmth. However, it wouldn't do to think Sherlock 'I'm married to my work' Holmes liked it in the same way he did.
"Sherlock, there's plenty of workers who I'm sure work different days or different shifts. The important thing is that all the patients are safe now."
John groasned and latched ihs mouth on Sherlock’ s collarbone while one hand raached down and pulled the pants down. Sherlock lifted his bum and then feet off the bed so John could pull them all the way off. JOhn thew the bee pants away and cupped Sherlock’s now bare ass with his hands.
An entire werek where Sherlcok didn't show up happened, and John was concerned,.  IT wasn't lilke this boy and he worried itwas because of his actions with the bully or because of the bully himself. But soon enough Sherlock did come back.
The victim was a male, late twenties, dressed in cheap but clean clothes. A discarded hypodermic needle lay in his right hand, and the sleeve on his left arm was rolled up, revealing a fresh puncture wound. Gloved hands pulled up the other sleeve, this time revealing many healed over track marks. Sherlock examined both hands closely, as well as the position of the body. He stood up when John came up beside him.
"Of course." He replied, smiling to himself. He was starting to believe there was a specific reason Sherlock was doing these things. These little touches, the bed sharing. He started suspecting that maybe his reason was the same one John had for agreeing with it.
Anyway, They observe the scene and Sherlock collects evidence. It's some green flecks and he's not sure what it means yet. Sherlock and John bring these flecks to the morgue and test them and fisa no HOLY SHIT MY HAMSTER. What a fucking idiot she's drinking from her water bottle like she ain't never done this before what a fucking loser. Anyway.
It was bright enough to see inside just from the daylight, so Sherlock immediately started analyzing everything. It was sparsely furnished, with used furniture probably found in thrift stores. The personal touches were minimal, including a few framed paintings and some fiction books on the coffee table. Maybe the man spent most of his time elsewhere, or just hadn't planned on staying here long.
The sent noise pinged on Sherlock's phone and he tossed it on the couch. "We're going to do some digging about Brown on the internet. See if we can't find an answer first."
Sherlock went willingly into John's arms. John had one wrapped around Sherlock's back and the other clasping the back of his head, a lover's embrace. Sherlock warmed at the intimate contact and closed his eyes. He wrapped his own arms around John's back and let his brain stop analyzing. He inhaled the scent of home and John and relaxed. He hadn't felt so at peace ever, not even in Baker Street before the fall.
John relayed the information to Sherlock who suggested they station people at any nearby location with a boat and access to the sea. Sherlock knew the only way the killer would come out of hiding is if he had a guaranteed method of travel, likely one posited to him by local homeless people part of a crime network.
Lestrade waved him and John into the room, but didn't send in an officer for security. He knew John had that covered.
Sherlock had only moved to rest his head face down on his knees, hands now gripped his curls. Something tugged in John's stomach at the sight. He walked over and sat down in front of Sherlock on the coffee table and pressed the warm cup against one of Sherlock's hands.
"I was very distractible as a kid," his tone changed. "Out of sight was literally out of mind, which is dangerous."
Bowser's big ass greeny ass turtley ass body rtried running to get to the river surrounding the castle, but then Rosalitea drifted down from the heacens and magicked his ass. Causing him to float back to Sherlock and John and therefore into custody.
John glanced at Sherlock and sure enough, he was still in his mind palace. His brow was furrowed in concentration, so whatever he was doing didn't look terribly stressful. John left Sherlock to it and grabbed the book he was partway through.
Sherlock and Joihn went off to Sussex to go to a county fiar. Sherlock's parents had tickets and had to conacel, s they gave them to Sherlock instead.
Of course he knew what John was thinking. John resigned himself to permanent maker of tea once more and stood up to head into the kitchen.
Sherlock mentally shook himself and typed a couple scores into the spreadsheet, Connor was already making a great first impression. "What would you do if she showed signs of a fever?"
The two week period of learning and situating came to a close, and Sherlock was thankful. He needed a case soon or he was going to start throwing tantrums too. It seemed John was also done only providing care to the masses. Apparently, people with fevers keep coming in, expecting some kind of treatment, as if they didn't know mild fevers are meant to run their course at home.
Relieved, John waltzed into the kitchen to begin preparing lunch, leaving a now sulking Sherlock in the other room. He made a mental note to make enough food for their guest as well then got started.
Inside the room, Lestrade placed each file folder on the table spread out, so all seven could be seen. He opened each and placed photos of each victim on top. He stood with his hands on the table and leaned forward a bit to tower over the killer, giving off an air of authority and aggression.
John was about to ask how he got in when he realized Mycroft probably had a key to most doors. "Morning. Sherlock isn't awake yet."
Once Sherlock's hair was more than shampooed, John repeated the process of dropping handfuls of water on his head to rinse it out. Thank god there was still conditioner to do, John was far from ready to stop running his hands through Sherlock's hair after being granted this opportunity.
Ella's attention was immediately diverted to this and she stared at the object in wonder before grabbing it. She realized that moving it produced the sound, so naturally she started shaking her fist and let out a series of vowels in excitement. She'd never heard this sound before.
With one hand, he cradled the baby. With the other, he browsed a multitude of websites including new mother forums and milestone blogs. He'd ordered a few books that weren't available to read online and expected their delivery in the next 24 hours.
Brown looked as if he was about to cry. Pathetic. "I didn't mean to. Really, I swear, I wouldn't have gone after a family. I- Do you really think he'd kill a baby?"
Sherloskc stared at him in awe and then John pushed down his trosuers and pants the rest of the wat and tuggetd his wrists so he'd be pulled in to the shower if he so please.d
Emmett was about to protest when Sherlock interrupted him. "Of course I'm not doing anything that could harm her. I may be a sociopath, but I'm not a psychopath. I'm going to observe what type of toy satisfies her most, which would of course prevent some tantrums."
Sherlock looked at him in askance and John told him to wait on the pavement. It took around five minutes to come back outside, file in hand, where he found Sherlock speaking softly to Eleanor and bouncing slightly on his feet to soothe her. Honestly, he would chuck the files in the nearest puddle and just go home with Sherlock if he could. But he couldn't. So instead he steeled himself.
John's breathing began to even out once he was no longer trapped. His expression was distraught, at the man firmly gripping his biceps, he pulled Sherlock into an even tighter embrace.
"Thank you," he sighed in relief. "If there's anything else I can do, I want to help. I need to for them. For Laney."
Finally, an idea formed in Sherlock's head. Whenever he heard John tossing around upstairs during a nightmare, he would play the violin to soothe him into better dreams. If it worked for John, why not this infant?
Sherlock fell asleep while watching John's diaphragm and chest move with his breathing. His body synced up with it against his wishes and pulled him under.
Sherlock hummed in response, and the two could finally sleep peacefully. You know, when Eleanor wasn't waking up at four in the morning.
. As if I was the one hurting it. Stopped throwing punches real quick when I managed to get a hold of the gun again. Then I injected him and took off."
"One time when we were studying, he kissed me. We were a couple after that, I suppose. Never in public though. I mean, it wouldn't have been safe at the time, but we never went to places where it was safe to be open like that." Sherlock changed position, and couldn't maintain eye contact with John. "We did other things, but it hurt. I complained and he offered a solution. I was high for the first time, and it was a solution. It felt like the answer to a lot of problems at the time. I wasn't bored anymore, my mind quieted whenever I shot up. I didn't do it terribly often then. Not yet."
He sighed, "Because she has a three syllable name and is it not common to shorten them when speaking?"
Sherlock was observably attached to the little girl, and more than a bit intrigued by her. He could only hope Sherlock didn't grow too emotionally attached. A voice that sounded suspiciously like Mycroft's whispered the word "Redbeard" in his ear.
"Sherlock, I am so sorry. You have a huge heart and deserve so much happiness, and you got all of that pain instead. I wish someone, or me, had been there to tell you you deserve better than Victor and that you were good enough, and
Sherlock rubbed his hands down the suit jacket, making sure it was straightened properly, and reentered the living room. John was sitting up on the couch and rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.
I'd like to dedicate this chapter to all the people who say there's no way Sherlock and John can have a kid safely while still being consulting detectives because I'm kind of petty !
Eleanor smacked a hand against his chest, and John laughed before joining Sherlock in the other room.
"Our best hope is that he comes out and one of Mycroft's people spot him on CCTV. He's smart, but he knows he's trapped. It's only a matter of time before he gives up and turns himself in, or tries making a run for it."
Sherlock held him back and placed one hand on the back of his neck. "Yes I'm fine. Everything is okay."
" John chastised him the same moment Evans squawked in indignation. "I apologize for my partner's behavior, sir." He flashed the grin he used when picking up to appear as friendly and charming as possible. "I'd really appreciate if you could get that list to us as soon as possible, and we'll interview staff as they come in and try to keep it brief."
"Okay." John walked behind Sherlock and stopped next to him on the pavement outside. "You don't think he'd be stupid enough to try leaving the country do you?"
Sherlock felt the double absence in the morning harshly. He tried distracting himself with updating his tobacco ash spreadsheet, then identifying the types of mould he secretly grew under the lip of the sink, then indexing John's socks, and finally with composing. Nothing seemed to work.
Sherlock through his coat and suit jacket on the ground. He was sweating and felt too hot all over, but at the same time, his body started shivering. He felt a weight pressing on his chest and he couldn't catch his breath but he really needed oxygen right now please because the nausea was getting worse and he'd like to stop it. He didn't know what he needed, but his mind screamed 'danger' and 'get out.' Disconnectedly he recognized it as a panic attack. Thank you brain, how helpful to name it, can you please stop it?
Sherlock kept asking more questions and Connor answered most of them in a way that suited Sherlock's requirements, while also showing a willingness and understanding to correct themselves if the answer wasn't exactly what he wanted. The entire process took around half an hour and they both met and exceeded Sherlock's expectations.
"Yes, I'm going to conduct an experiment on your daughter so if you could place her on the blanket in front of me that would be swell."
While he'd stopped paying close attention to her, said baby decided his hand was much more fascinating than the bear. She bent forward and latched her mouth to the side of Sherlock's thumb and gurgled.
John stood taller at Sherlock's praise. To be trusted so fully by this man, when he thinks of himself as useless and merely a backboard for Sherlock's deductions during cases. Sherlock felt he was capable, more so then trained officers who hadn't gone through career ending injuries.
Sherlock's eyes were closed tightly and one hand gripped his curls and pulled while the other was fisted in the front of his shirt over his heart. He tried focusing on John's voice, but there were so many things happening at once.
Sherlock wanted to argue that food was a waste of time, but it was still an affirmative answer and he didn't want to test the stubborn soldier. He could have him pinned on the floor if he wanted to after all. That didn't sound like a negative thing at all actually, but in this case it would just waste more time they couldn't afford. "Okay. Cook something, takeout takes longer."
The DI shifted his weight awkwardly. "Right. And we have our men placing the ones on that list back into custody."
Some time in the night, a muffled whimper roused Sherlock from sleep. He jerked upright, concerned first that the intruder broke in and was inflicting pain on Baker Street's inhabitants. Another whimper, this time definitely coming from John, disregarded that worry and replaced it with a new one. He looked down and saw John tangled in the sheets, face down. His hands were clenching and unclenching the sheets and the pillow muffled any sounds coming from his mouth.
know Sherlock better than to do that, Sherlock has done nothing but proven over and over what a capable caretaker he is. Feeling acid in his stomach, he got the carrier and fit it over Sherlock's shoulders and Belstaff.
"Okay." John smiled and stood up, though he took Sherlock's hands and tugged him up as well. "Come here."
Sherlock sighed, "Obviously not, you're not intelligent enough to go this long without being caught."
The wall above the couch still contained a collage of photos and documents from the case. Sherlock always waited until the suspect's verdict was announced before taking it all down, for some sense of closure. Lucky for them, his meticulousness allowed them to jump straight into reexamining every detail.
John smiled at the praise and laughed at Sherlock's exuberant reaction, he felt the excitement as well. This was the break they've been looking for, they could finally move forward. They made eye contact and only now did John realize how close they were. Sherlock's hands still clasping his shoulders, faces flushed from excitement and something else. John's breath hitched and he glanced at Sherlock's cupid bow lips.
Lestrade ran down the hallway with Donovan. He called into his radio to send any nearby units to Brown's address, and the rest he voiced was lost as they reached the elevator and the doors closed.
John peered at Sherlock through his peripheral vision and could just make out that the lanky man stretched across the bed to reach him.
John closed his eyes and sighed. He couldn't believe people were still doing this but at thes ame time he coud. He turned to the object of his fantasies and said, "Srorry if I played int things, I just...I didn't want assholes like him thinking that was a bad thing. Cause i'ts not. TO be gay, that is."
Sherlock pointed his bow toward the doorway and the two moved to the living room. Here they could speak at a normal volume without waking the baby.
His fists which were clenched tightly around the rim of the cot began hurting, his tendons were strained. He clenched harder and closed his eyes.
As all hugs do, however, it ended. John seemed as reluctant to let go as Sherlock had and neither were ready to go their separate ways. John suggested they watch crap telly before going to bed and Sherlock agreed because it meant not going to bed now.
"He doesn't want to be alone again, and I don't think he likes the idea of her being alone either. It just makes sense to me."
He made breakfast quickly and once the two of them finished eating, he cleared his throat. "We need to make a list of essentials to get for Eleanor today."
He may have tripped on the edge of the rug on the way and the others may have hidden their laughs. He wouldn't know, he was busy trying to remove himself from the situation and bury himself in a non existent experiment.
They'd never slept in John's room together, but their combined exhaustion didn't leave room for awkwardness as they settled under the covers. They were only apart for a few moments before John curled up around Sherlock's back, effectively spooning him. Sherlock needed the comfort of physical touch right now, he argued. And if John could benefit from the comfort too, well, no one would know.
Sherlock listened to him, and wondered if John really hadn't noticed that he placed a comforting hand on Sherlock's arm. That hand was everything to Sherlock, but he had other things to focus on right now. "I know, it's just tedious. We'll have to go to them instead."
Sherlock was going to question him further, but Lestrade gave them the green light from upstairs. The two jogged up and Lestrade handed Sherlock a laptop.
Oh. A flash of hurt went across Sherlock's face. "You would do well to give me the benefit of doubt. We're going to Scotland Yard so I can look at photos from the crime scene because our babysitter isn't available on Tuesdays."
When they pulled away they looke at each ohter in awe, wonderng if the other felt the sparks, though they could tell once they obsered the stars in the others' eyse.
"'Cause they're a drain on society. They're a danger to others and they're a burden to everyone. Even the people who claim to love them would be relieved if their junkie whatsit or other disappeared."
Both of their beds felt too big and cold. They wondered how they ever slept at all without the other being there.
Sherlock's groan indicated that there was some type of development. John put his phone away and walked over.
John held his gaze steadfastly. There was a world of guilt, pain, and compassion in those eyes and combined with his words it pushed Sherlock. His traitorous body formed tears which he prevented from dropping, but only just barely. It would be a long time before he believed the words John was telling him. After all, a lifetime of being conditioned to believe one doesn't matter, doesn't reverse itself in the span of a single conversation.
John didn't want to break the delicate bubble they were in, but he had to know. "Did you write that?" he whispered.
A short minute later, Sherlock joined John in the bedroom with his violin and bow in hand. He stood near the bed and raised his arms to the proper position and began to play.
SHerlock merely said , :"I have to urinatte." Before pulling his trousers and pants down ans doing just so.
Sherlock didn't have long to miss the contact because they finally arrived back at home. He paid for the cab this time and the two went inside together.
I'd like to thank myself for managing to find a way for Sherlock and John to share a bed in their own flat.
Sometime later, a couple men arrived at Baker Street to drop off a few bags and one box of supplies. They left discreetly without a word, though John did thank them.
"Perfect, you can look over this while I go tell Sherlock." He handed over the menu and padded over to Sherlock's room.
Back at Baker Street, they found Emmett playing with Eleanor on the rug in front of the fireplace. Mrs. Hudson was in the kitchen cleaning some dishes and stopped when they entered the room.
The prompt was "Mario kart au" so there was a lot of liberty and I decided it meant Sherlock and John are literally in the game.
In response, he scoffed and took up his violin by the window. He was playing a soft melody, akin to happy children's music, when Emmett came back down.
Sherlock's arm tingled at the point of contact, even though it was covered by his sleeve. The warmth from john's hand bled through and he cursed himself for not rolling them up earlier. John was so, well, John, that he
Neither of them pulled apart for the rest of the night, even when they both fell back asleep. Both of their minds dreamless.
The two arrive at Baker Street just as the sun sets and shadows fall across the street. John unlocks the door and nearly trips over a pram tucked into the side of the foyer. He makes a mental note of their client not being entirely alone, and heads up the seventeen steps to enter their flat. Sherlock follows close behind, eyes glued to his mobile screen as usual.
Then Sherlock had asked him if it was the right thing to do to inform someone that their partner is unfaithful. John, of course, said yes and that's when he learned that Mary is not the sweet nurse he thought she was. It didn't take him long to get over her, his thoughts were now occupied with Sherlock. So in the end, it wasn't a big deal, it was a whirlwind relationship he planned on settling for after all.
John came back in and shut the door behind him softly. He sat down next to the tub with his legs stretched out. His leg would surely ache later, but it was worth it.
John closed the laptop and crossed the room to the detective. He caught his arm and gently tugged Sherlock to a seat. "We only have two known victims from a serial killer. How could you possibly deduce things with that amount of information?"
John smiled and cleared his throat. "Mmm, so six recovering addicts who were all patients at London Rehab were murdered by injection of their drug of choice. All the bodies were found in back alleys or ditches."
John stepped around him and gasped. A few paramedics were surrounding Emmett who was laying on the floor. It looked as though they just stopped treating him, but instead of readying him for travel, they slowly packed away medical supplies as if they had all the time in the world. Which meant-
First, John fetched a towel from a rack in the bathroom, laid on the ground, and rested Eleanor on top, giving her forehead a kiss as he let go. He made a quick stop in the kitchen to microwave some water, and while it was heating he went back into the living room and prepared to change the girl.
It was obvious to Sherlock how much he loved her. Emmett was sleep deprived and grieving, probably still craving cocaine, but devoted all of his energy to this baby. He hadn't complained about her, and he probably never felt the need to. He accepted all of the hardship of being a single parent effortlessly, all because it meant he would get to keep her.
They'd shifted positions somewhat, which placed John's head higher up on the bed. Sherlock's was tucked into his neck and John's arm was still wrapped around the brunette's chest. Perhaps John hadn't moved because he wanted to be courteous and not wake Sherlock, especially after what happened in the night. For this, Sherlock desperately wanted to slow his breathing and continue feigning sleep, but he knew they needed to get moving. There was a serial killer after all.
"John," he waved his fingers impatiently in the air. "I know I can be impulsive, but I would never do that with a decision like this. It's sudden, but don't think for a second that I haven't run through many scenarios in my head looking for any possible negatives. Between the work and my inheritance, I have more than enough money to support her financially. We know of no less than three people who are qualified to babysit during cases and emergencies. My experiments can be kept above ground level so she's unable to reach anything dangerous, and when she gets older I can simply move them elsewhere. Our line of work is no more dangerous than that of a police officer or firefighter or soldiers, and they have families all the time."
If he couldn't make progress on the victims, he could at least narrow down the motive. It couldn't be lust, as the autopsy report showed no signs of sexual abuse. It didn't appear to be a thrill seeking kill either. An overdose would have been boring, to administer and to witness. There were no signs of torture or struggle either, making it even more unlikely. Driven by psychosis? Statistically unlikely, and no signs of it either. But a mission based killing, addicts were considered a plague on society to some. It made sense, though they could really do with actual evidence to suggest this rather than speculation.
"What?" John questioned, though he moved to sit in his chair by the fireplace regardless of any confusion.
At least John understood him. He always had, even if he disagreed with the practicality of it. Anyway, it was clear to him that whoever the killer was, it was someone working in the rehab center. They knew names of patients and addresses. Could it be a doctor or psychiatrist, someone specifically in the field to get close to the very people they loathe? He was certain he'd determine exactly who it was once he was able to interrogate the employees.
John goes uwu and Sherlock starts researching different types of scale cells. He discovers that only one species has green scales of this make up, howber multuple racers are a aprt of this species.
John was surprised, but came back in and closed the door behind him before sitting on the tiled floor next to his friend. "Is there anything I can do?"
John ignored the tickle of Sherlock's curls against his cheek and focused on the words in front of him instead. Sure enough, in order of date, the names of each victim were in succession. He noticed something else too. "Sherlock, Emmett's name is next."
By the time John came back, Sherlock discarded multiple files as obvious accidental overdoses. He looked up as John walked in and saw that John brought him his own coffee. John handed it over without a word, and started on one of the untouched piles.
Unspoken between them was Sherlock's fear from last night. John thought he knew how to distract him. "Send a picture of this list to Mycroft and then you can continue your spreadsheet from when Emmett was here."
The two men took a cab, and Sherlock gave the instructor an address for a more expensive neighborhood just outside the city. During the drive, Sherlock took the list of patients from John and scanned it, frowning at what he saw.
"We're to take clients on a set schedule, that way there is stability even with the use of a babysitter. And we take them on a case by case basis. High profile cases are out the door, too much room for blackmail and psychopathy. I take it you're as keen as I am to never encounter another Moriarty?"
Lestrade said, "We have a wobbly confession and a stack of circumstantial evidence, so it shouldn't be an issue to prosecute. Not as clean cut as I'd hoped though."
They spent a nice long, hot shower pressed to each other and getting off. They'd talk more about feelings once they got to bed that night.
"No, he wouldn't right now. I suspect he's going to lay low in a cheap hotel for a few days if he has enough cash. He wouldn't use a card because we can trace that."
He shook his head in amusement and mouthed the word "later" at Sherlock, before going back to his task of making tea for the evening. He also noticed that the bottle warmer was set up again near the toaster. How in the world were they to deal with this?
Lestrade pinched the bridge of his nose. "Then there's probably not a higher risk of more deaths if we release an official statement?"
He didn't want to stare too long, afraid Sherlock would notice, though he seemed to have fallen back into that dark place again. John kneeled next to him and cupped water in his hands then let dumped it on Sherlock's curls. When Sherlock didn't object, he repeated the process until they were properly soaked. Next, he reached for Sherlock's expensive shampoo and popped the lid, secretly taking a whiff of the light lemon scent. John poured a generous amount into one hand and put the bottle down, then reached for Sherlock's hair and started massaging it in.
Another half an hour went past and finally, Lestrade texted back, though with nothing new. Sherlock tried forwarding the text to John but realized he left his phone in the room when a quiet ping sounded somewhere.
Sherlock looked from the gift to John, then back to the gift again. He reached for it slowly, almost as if he expected it to disappear or be taken away. Once in his hands, Sherlock began to peel away the blue wrapping paper (a small part of him noting how it matched John’s eyes).
Sherlock froze at the contact and turned to face John. The small point of contact pulled him from the loop of thoughts which switched between frustration and self loathing. It felt steady and warm, and he focused on the calluses for a moment, imagining how they'd feel caressing his face instead. Finally, he spoke. "Doesn't matter."
Sherlock spun around to no doubt tell John to stop being an idiot, but John cut him off. "No, I understand it. I mean, I don't understand how that would lead to killing all these people. One? Yeah, he's very angry. But why go after so many others when he's just miffed? You're always saying that love is a more vicious motivator, but he didn't give us any indication that was the case."
Sherlock met his gaze but didn't say anything. He didn't want to lie to John (who would see right through it anyway), but he couldn't bring himself to admit that he wasn't okay either.
John knew he was right when Sherlock's eyes widened and he leapt over the coffee table onto the floor. "See, this is why I need you." He said as he pulled out his phone and began texting.
John pulled a business card out of his pocket and handed it over. "You can always bring her to my clinic for check ups, I'd be happy to see her again."
In his mind palace, he weighed the pros and cons of a possible solution. He could use the monitor as a walkie-talkie of sorts and ask John to come to bed. But that would open himself up to scrutiny, and possibly reveal his true feelings. But John was a good man, if he didn't want to then he would simply ignore the message and feign sleep. That is if he isn't already asleep and wouldn't hear it at all. On the other hand, John could be awake and hear it and listen. Honestly, the chance of that happening, albeit slim, was enough for Sherlock to push his roiling anxiety aside.
Once she was gone, John moved in front of Sherlock and placed one hand over a clenched fist and the other against the side of Sherlock's stony face.
. That wasn't your fault and neither would this be. But no harm is coming to her, we're both here for her. You can research all about babies tomorrow, but you're doing your best right now and that's enough. Please, don't do this to yourself." I love you.
Guess who's back after an impromptu month long hiatus? It's okay if you lost faith in this WIP, however I haven't and should be back to my regular once a week schedule because exams are finally over!
But HECK I keep thinking about the pain I'm gonna cause Sherlock when Eleanor has to be turned into foster care, rip.
Sherlock scoffed and John elbowed him, but they followed Lestrade out the door. The silver haired man took his patrol car, and Sherlock of course hailed for a cab instead.
HE laened his hands on John's chest and looke dhim in the etse nad said, "Sorry  , I'll be on my eay.:
They allowed a few moments to settle and finish their first drink, after which John added another two fingers to each glass. Finally, Sherlock was ready to start.
Given confidence from Sherlock's bravery and the alcoholic buzz, John leaned forward placed a hand on Sherlock's knee. "I think I do."
He ignored the whispers gnawing at his heart that declared him too volatile and inconsiderate to care for someone. For once, he wouldn't believe them.
Connor's character is lowkey highkey pulled from Connor in Detroit: Become Human because I just couldn't help myself. The babysitter was meant to be a one off line just so the boys would have someone, but it turned into a whole ass thing and now Connor is going to be an important part of Ella's life. I hope you like them as much as I do!
John's fists were clenched in his lap, and he finished his drink while Sherlock was speaking. He was appalled that this man would hurt Sherlock, and offered drugs instead of empathy. His heart ached for though. For this young Sherlock who was so alone in the world that he didn't know or think he should stay away from Victor. He wished he was there, he wouldn't have let this happen.
"I-I didn't know. I don't stay in contact with them when they stop seeing me." He covered his mouth with his hands, slightly muffling his speech. "But they don't change. They-they don't make families."
Sherlock's pulse sky-rocketed for reasons completely unrelated to the case. John was staring at him, at his
John smiled himself at that last thought and lost himself in picturing it as he unlocked the street door and jogged up the steps. He opened the door to flat B and walked through the living room to the kitchen, glancing at Sherlock briefly to say hello.
Meanwhile John asked if they found anything else. They didn't. Lestrade said he was surprised that there weren't any traces of drugs here, but conceded it was possible that Brown got rid of them before he went on holiday. Something about that stuck in his head, but he brushed it aside. They'd find any important information in that file.
While John made tea, he covertly watched Sherlock pace around the room and pause once in a while in front of the case wall. John wracked his brain to think of any distractions when the blessed (for once) sound of a baby crying came from the other room.
He squeezed John's wrist. He needed him to know. "You didn't, I slept better last night than I have in years."
Sherlock took a shaky breath and wiped away the stubborn tear that managed to escape. "It's possible I do something like that with Ella. That's why Mycroft is right."
It sounded like a fine enough plan to him, and he was worried that Sherlock would run off without him regardless. Agreeing was perhaps the only way he could keep Sherlock safe. "Fine, but we come back before it gets dark
Sherlock looked down at the hand John had wrapped around his own. John must have been able to tell how hard he was thinking. In reality, he was trying desperately hard to not think at all, but the intrusive thoughts wormed their way in.
"Not sure, we still don't have much data on him. I don't know how he thinks yet." The disdain was obvious in his voice.
Sherlock manually pulled the contents of the drawers out and crumpled them up, leaving them in a pile on the ground. The final file he grabbed belonged to the killer himself. The label on it was blank and if he looked at it too closely he would be able to make out indentation of a name, only the letter 'Z' was discernible. It seemed the quick deletion he made during the interrogation was successful in keeping the man's name out of his head. That man didn't deserve a name or any recognition at all.
Sherlock moved to his chair and brought his hands together under his chin, staring at John all the while. John was in his own chair, pretending to read for the past hour. Sherlock noticed how he'd barely turned more than five pages.
John hoped the morning would go rather quickly so the two could find somewhere to eat sooner rather than later.
John's fist clenched around the fabric of Sherlock's shirt. "No, Mycroft is fucked up for making you think this. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that you'll never do something careless like that. Because you will, we're human. There's a possibility that either of us does something like that. The chances of that mistake harming her are very small though. And it's just a possibility parents have to accept, okay? We're more likely to get carried away watching telly and she starts screaming to let us know we forgot her lunch."
Mycroft smiled, though it looked somewhat strained as usual, and made himself comfortable in John's chair. "I see that. And tell me, how was the 1000 thread count sheets?"
"Of course." Connor took the baby from the woman, pulled her close to support her body. Eleanor immediately felt dejected at leaving her caretaker's arms, so she turned her head and tried to seek them out. Connor quickly noticed the increasing anxiety on her face and shifted her to their hip so they could reach one hand into the tote and pull out a toy.
Emmett sat down on the sofa and ran his hands through his hair, the bags under his eyes were even more pronounced than yesterday. "How does that work then? Will you be staying here with me?"
The bits and bobs they purchased for the baby were mostly on his bed and in the cot. He approached the cot and began rifling through the items, analyzing them based on how much they used or didn't use an object. A plush bee stood out from the pile, and Sherlock took it and sat down on his bed.
