When everything seems to calm down completely, bringing to their reality the time to deal with the world without Chuck, The Empty or any other great threatening power, Amara appears at the basement door.
Dean brings a bitter harshness in his voice, he clearly doesn't want to expose his resentment after having a brief experience of hope defeating Chuck, but the feeling that history would repeat itself again, even if he wants to trust Jack, after all Cas saw him...
Dean calls out, awakening Castiel from his thoughts. He didn't notice that he was staring at Dean, looking beyond that moment.
, which they won't mention again, will still haunt Dean for a while or until the other shoe drops. But he knows that if he asks Cas to help, Cas will stay…
And Cas was so wistfully sincere that Dean for a moment relived the feeling of having lost Jack, of not even being able to enter the room and say goodbye to him. Dean sighed. He understood.
Dean is taken by surprise, as he was with his low guard. His eyes go to the beer label, and he begins, without realizing it, to tear off small pieces of paper. When he looks up, he manages to smile at Sam affectionately.
And Castiel exchanges a glance with Dean, who holds his gaze before moving suddenly, feeling the armchair become uncomfortable.
"This possibly wouldn't be the strangest thing that happened over there." Cas adds this observation."
"Rowena is about to call us." Sam speaks, catching Dean and Cas' attention. "I'm going to answer her video call."
Jack had said goodbye to the Winchesters, two of his parents and two of the people he loves most in his life, but the farewell was colder than he wished. He couldn't explain exactly why, but he knows that Sam and Dean somehow realized that Jack was not just Jack at the time.
Dean got up and wandered around the Bunker. Some nights when he couldn't sleep and Cas was home, they’d sit together for a drink, watch a movie or exchange a few words… Somehow this was reassuring and made the night less lonely, not that Dean really cared about it, but... Well, he decided to go to the kitchen, after not finding Cas in the library, along the way, Dean noticed that the light in Dean Cave was on, and deduced that Cas must be there. Very well. He grabbed two beers and headed toward that room.
Jack still feels the flow coming out of his body and is a little stunned to respond, however, he manages to regain his stability and smiles in agreement. Perhaps a new and more hopeful world can exist in this reality.
Dean stares at his hand holding the flower for a few seconds, not knowing how to react. He could make a joke out of it, but he can only see the little marks on Cas' fingers, where the thorns have scratched and pierced, and how he's still holding the flower somewhat insecurely. Dean reaches out and takes it carefully.
They fell silent again, their eyes still locked on each other after the first hesitation. And Dean wondered if he should ask more, if the ground in front of him wasn't too dangerous for both himself and Cas… Years ago he thought his own happiness lay with Lisa and Ben, in a peaceful life without supernatural beings, with a complete family and not torn apart or touched by the violence he experienced so early… It was something he wanted to have, but he couldn't keep up… Currently, he was no longer sure about that dream, it felt like something from another life, from someone other than himself. Now his family was a bit messed up, really messed up depending on the occasion, they were far from perfect or well-adjusted... Hell, he didn't even know what that really meant! But this time, he felt that his family was complete, more complete perhaps than it ever. He had Sam, and by a miracle, their mother was back, slowly becoming part of the life they live now. He had Cas around and Jack was their child… And there were so many other people that Dean came to consider… His family was what it should be, it was what they built and found together, and it couldn't exist without Cas... That was the kind of thinking Dean came back to quite often, the kind of thinking that ran through his mind and made him feel something he wouldn't dare name. His breathing became more ragged and he felt the silence between them... This was the kind of silence Dean got used to sharing with Cas, it wasn't uncomfortable, it was their thing, filling the space that kept them apart as if there were stable bonds between them… There was a good feeling about not having to be alone while you needed nothing more than to be present to be accepted.
Dean bites his lip. Of course he wants to share nice things with Sam too, but for now, he would like it to be just between him and Cas… That somehow, even if indirect, he was the reason Cas decided to stay. After everything that happened, of almost dying, once again, with Billie intending to take him to the Empty and not Heaven (or Hell in the worst case scenario)… Dean wants to have time with Castiel too, he wishes he could ask for that... But he knows he doesn't have that right, yet…
Charlie seems to be special to Dean and Sam, someone whose safety affects them personally and whose presence lights up where she is... Castiel can't see her aura, the energy that emanates from human souls, as he no longer has his powers, but he could feel the lighter mood reflected in Dean's warm smile and hearing him laughing at something they were talking about as he walked down the stairs with her, with her bags on his shoulder... She approaches, her red hair falling over her shoulders and a wide smile as she uses her fingers to smooth her bangs, and Castiel no longer wonders how that human being couldn't be copied by the leviathans in all her integrity.
And when Dean carefully takes the ring from Cas' hand and looks at it in a comforting, welcoming and warm way, Cas sees it, as in so many other moments since their first met: The man whose soul shines with an intensity that Castiel has never seen it, neither on Earth, nor in Hell, nor in Heaven or Purgatory, and he is being literal in that statement. This is the caring human being that Cas loved and still loves.
without carrying any guilt, no burden, no fear, no doubt or price to pay. He feels love and happiness, and that happiness multiplies because Dean is smiling. Dean is happy too and the world is saved for good.
Dean can't contain the stab of agony that hit his chest. Then he finishes the sandwich and tries to give Cas a grin, disguising that feeling.
, but he doesn't want to risk shouting or looking angry. He doesn't feel angry at Cas, but this situation is complicated… Everything that Dean found himself feeling is complicated. However, he knows he needs to say something this time, as there are too many words stuck in his throat, too many things to ignore and move on.
Sam shouts, then he approaches and starts to read a spell, little by little the black spots regress and try to regroup away from Castiel and Dean.
was the only stable and continuous point in their lives, that old car was the only thing that kept them from feeling homeless.
. They hear the Bunker's door open, and Sam and Eileen go down the stairs, while Miracle follows them. Soon they will be there too.
Claire reciprocates with a wry smile and she and Kaia leave their backpacks in the corner of the table while they sit down.
Dean frowned, an edge of anger wanting to snap at the tip of his tongue. He held back, he was without thoughts for a few seconds. A deal. But Cas was still there, so the story wasn't over yet.
Dean Winchester hasn't really cried in public since he was 4, when he lost a toy on the playground. Dean Winchester did not cry in front of the others, or did not usually cry, that had been who he was for almost four decades. But now Dean Winchester is in front of his brother, his friends, the best friend and love of his life, the whole family he found along this tortuous
Older hunters, who already live a rare condition within this branch of work in which growing older was more of an exception than a tradition, were also struggling to understand that the world has changed completely, and that it would continue to change. After all, what did that mean? Everyone was trying to find some satisfactory answer.
" Dean no longer remembers that he had a pie plate in front of him, all of his attention is turned to Castiel.
. His relevance had been measured in these terms, however, Castiel also knew that he challenged all of this more than once and Dean told him… That he was not just a piece of the
Dean blinked, a part of his brain seemed to stop at those words, at what they would mean ahead. He only managed to say
Dean is on one knee, body tense. He starts breathing and relaxing again. Okay, he was sleeping next to Cas… It wasn't the first time something like this had happened. However, Cas continues to glimpse him, not in an intense and inquisitive way, but with a softness that has Dean close to blush.
Dean has no words. He just chokes on some sound he tried to make pretending to say Cas is still drunk. But he doesn't say anything, because Cas keeps looking him in the eye without flinching and Dean doesn't want to break it, even though a part of him is on alert telling him to leave, saying the conversation with Charlie wasn't relevant, that if Cas feels something for him, it can't be what he feels for Cas… And what exactly does he feel for Cas now that it's just the two of them there? No grand plan, no archangels and true vessels, no end of the world knocking at the door once more.
Dean starts to speak, but he is clearly scrambling for what to say next. He is beside the chair on which Castiel is sitting with his hand resting on it.
Amara remembers being imprisoned and if at that time she was able to feel something with intensity, it was the pain of being betrayed by the only being who had known her since the beginning. She was silenced for ages, alone... When she was released, all the anger she felt was used to sum her up to that role she did not ask for: she was the villain, the crazy one with "emotions" out of control, a female figure that needed to be stopped in the eyes of her opponents... And the human world perceived her as any other angry and out of control woman, with the addition of supernatural powers…
Jack is in doubt. He is certainly not human, he was never fully human, at least not without the price of his own mortal body, but he is not a god and does not feel ready to take on that burden. Jack wants a life, he wants to wake up early and eat the cereal that Sam doesn't approve of. He wants to sit with Dean and watch the movies while Dean recites the lines decorated with imitations in different voices for each character. Jack wants to sit with Cas and play some new game, show him funny videos from the internet or go shopping while Cas tells jokes in Enochian, which he never fully understands. But none of this will be possible if Jack cannot keep the world in order and, apparently, if he does, there will not be much left of him to want and desire these banal pleasures with the same intensity.
Jack has glimpsed this possibility while carrying the power of Amara and Chuck, but now he no longer knows what is within his reach and what his options are.
path, crying. Dean Winchester is crying with a big grin as he thinks he's being silly about it, but it doesn't matter. Dean is satisfied,
The smell of breakfast spreads through the kitchen. Cas and Dean approach with their hands busy, bringing plates and the frying pan. Claire gets up to help with the mugs and coffee, there is also a bottle of juice that Sam left in the fridge.
Sam, try to organize that discussion. Behind it are two panels, one with the map of the country and the other with a list of monsters and supernatural creatures with their current status: if they still exist or have ceased to exist, and what are the last places that have sent news.
Dean stares at him for a while, realizing the simplicity of that interaction with Cas... He can't let some things go, like Kelly Kline, the distance with his mom, the British Men of Letters... But something small like judging himself because he watched and maybe liked a
Then Castiel lifts the beer bottle and, with a bit of firmness, speaks, looking at Dean in agreement.
Jack looks up, now watching closely. He still has his responsibilities, but he would like Amara to be there to answer that.
Jack hears Dean calling him and the invitation in his voice to return to the Bunker makes him happy. He can look at Dean now and see thousands of versions of his life, and all of his memories and sufferings, his smallest and brightest joys (albeit brief). It’s too much for one human to carry. However, Jack feels that something between them has been fixed, not entirely, but it is a small bridge of humanity that still connects them to a common path. Maybe Dean isn't fully aware of it now, because there are so many urgent matters in his mind and heart, but a part of him is willing to try.
Amara looks through Jack and he feels that she sees all the layers of history that have gone through that place until she arrives at the time of her arrest.
In this way, Dean falls on his back on the basement floor, it is not the worst fall or the worst hit to the head that he had ever suffered in his life. He’s fine, although his arms are sore and heavy, but when he opens his eyes, he realizes that he is hugging with both arms tight around Castiel's body. He holds Castiel tight and keeps him safe. His hands go to Cas' shoulders, and Dean makes an effort to lift him up, trying to see his face, trying to confirm that Castiel is alive and well...
Jack is calm, he can't hurry any more or be bitter any more. Everything he feels seems to unfold in infinite planes of existence and it seems silly to be hurt before time.
Dean had already attended birthday parties, some before the age of four, which he did not remember, and some when he was with Lisa. With those exceptions, none while growing up or after adulthood, and none organized by his family and friends to honor him. He remembers being in the corner of the parties he witnessed, seeing strangers having fun, interacting, talking banalities. He was unable to appropriate it, but he tried as hard as he could, for Lisa and Ben. Deep down, Dean felt for a long time a stranger to everything that could be considered a
Dean hears someone clear their throat and his attention moves to the person sitting next to him. Kevin has a raised eyebrow, a frown that says
Almost a week ago they found the dog wandering the desert world, as a last sign that they were not entirely alone, until Chuck made it dust like he had done with everyone else. After they got rid of Chuck and started checking to see if their friends were safe, Miracle appeared again, seeming to sniff out where Dean was.
Dean forces a cough and then asks if Cas is okay, when he nods, Dean looks at Sam who came over to help them get up.
Jack says everything very spontaneously, but in his head he wonders if he could draw a parallel with Star Wars to make more sense.
Jack doesn't know how to explain what's going on inside him to the Winchesters, but he does know that they are his family, or hopes they still are, so he tries to stay together. He needs time and needs to find out what is possible (and what seems impossible) and there is no way the Winchesters can help with that directly. What Jack can do for them right away is to bring the people of the world back, save his friends and keep them safe until he comes back... At least he would like to be able to go home.
Cas responds more seriously than Dean expected. Then he looks thoughtful, his shoulders slump slightly.
The memory of Kelly always brought a kind of sadness to Jack, even though he was grateful for everything she means to him.
Jack ponders that question and answers it with the sincerity that is still his greatest characteristic "
Dean coughs and then tries to stare at Sam, who's mouth slightly open, his expression hard to read, until he changes.
And Cas responds determinedly as if he's been given a crucial mission… Which Dean thinks is maybe an exaggeration, but maybe it's an effect of all the times he's been calling attention to the mess Cas, Kevin and Sam leave when he's not around.
Jack replies with his mouth full and letting some of the cookie crumbs escape. The truth is that Jack isn’t calm. He appeared in the Bunker after finishing transferring Chuck's power to Amara, and Sam and Dean were surprised and relieved, hugged him and then embarked on a hurried conversation to find out what had happened and how they would rescue Castiel. Now Jack is voraciously discounting in the cookies while the anxiety grows in his stomach.
Dean looks around. They are in Sam's room, trying to watch some Game Of Thrones episodes. The place is definitely small for the five of them, and it would be awesome to have a bigger room for that. Sam and Kevin, each in a chair, but Charlie, Dean and Cas are sharing spaces on the bed. Cas is in front of the bed, in the corner to Dean's right, awkwardly trying not to get in front of the screen; and Charlie closer to Dean, leaning against the headboard. Now everyone seems to have noticed Dean's rambling, with Sam and Charlie having arched eyebrows, loaded with some meaning and little subtlety, mostly on Charlie's part.
Charlie starts, but stops as she looks at them, still frozen, half scared, half not knowing what to do with their faces and hands.
They remain in bed, ignoring the alarm clock. Later, they will have to hear a speech from Sam complaining that they were late to meet them at the beach...
had another meaning for him and the loyalty they inspire each other, despite their problems and failures, is impressive. And Jack, for the first time in an eternity, trusted Amara.
Dean Winchester puts the ring on Castiel's finger, and quickly the transparent stone takes on the color and brilliance of angelic grace. For a moment Castiel shines before he returns to normal. The world changes again and that is indeed a good thing to happen.
But Dean never chose to forget. He remembers everything and everyone he loved and lost, he remembers the people he saved and those he failed… And he keeps fighting, so Castiel recognizes not just fury, not just anger, but an unparalleled will to defend others… Once Dean convinced Castiel that it was worth fighting for people and families on Earth, at that moment Castiel understood that Dean extended to billions of strangers his instinct to protect, to save whoever he could until it was no longer possible... Castiel has never met someone like Dean, who would have the power of an Archangel awaiting him, who was faced with the possibility of the world ending, who was belittled like an ant facing a greater plan outside the anthill inside the aquarium, and still stood upright and chose to rebel, chose his own weapons and his own heart…
Castiel then takes a deep breath and looks beyond Charlie and Kevin, he recalls the beginnings, talking to other angels, building the world, and everything is somehow untouched inside him, surviving like a second life.
She knows he has his doubts, the boy is innocent, but smart enough to be suspicious of an almost perfect offer, and yet he chose to trust what he saw and felt in her. Amara could be heard and seen like never before, and the final sentence was not to be cornered and trapped, it was not betrayal under the suspicion that she would lose control of so much power... On the contrary, Amara was recognized as capable, her growth up to that moment and her small changes while on Earth were valued... And Amara wants to live up to that, because maybe for the first time she can find a role for herself that isn’t assigned by others and at the same time it isn’t just about her.
Cas stared at Dean with his mouth a little open. He recovered and clenched his jaw, after some thought he decided to share another concern.
Dean leans over to Cas, who wanders his eyes over Dean's lips. It is fast and both are not interrupted. Dean presses his lips to Cas', and they kiss, slowly accepting each other, accepting what's going on. The kiss becomes more intense as they feel each other, the correspondence, the time spent with so much miscommunication and silence now pushing them closer.
And Dean and Cas are sitting close to each other, as they used to be, but there is a subtle difference there in the way they act. Before the movie started, Dean tried to do an act of kindness and gave up his self-proclaimed right to choose the movie, he passed the opportunity on to Cas, but Cas was panicked for a moment and said they could watch what Dean wanted to, and they both played that responsibility to each other to the point that they were already annoying themselves and the other witnesses to the little argument, until Sam intervened and decided the movie they were going to watch. However, as the film progresses, they don't annoy each other as they usually did (with Dean leading the way), on the contrary, Dean and Cas seem more comfortable than ever.
Before they could answer anything more than that, voices from the hallway grow louder and Charlie, Kevin and Sam enter the kitchen.
Dean gives up on sleeping, well what can he do? They don't plan on going out on a case for the next day, so if he needs to, he can take a nap later. He sits up in bed, running a hand through his messy hair. But what can he do now? Well, Cas never sleeps, and he must still be in the Bunker… Sometimes he leaves without warning or without giving much details, however, since they returned from the mission to help Benjamin, Cas seems to need a while before returning to look for Kelly or anything like that. A part of Dean wants him to stay longer, in the end it's their home, Cas' too, at least that's how Dean wants him to feel, but… Hell, he already said he needed him and Cas left anyway, so… But the only time he seemed willing to stay any longer, Dean had to send him away...
Dean doesn't really consider himself a man of faith, or a righteous man to be fair, yet he will be a man of faith this time, because that is what he can hold on to at the moment, and because Cas, of all people, beings and things, taught him to believe that good things can do happen to him.
Sam laughs. Castiel slept more than twelve hours straight after becoming human, but he looks fine despite the confusion after waking up. Eileen and Jack went out in the morning to shop at the supermarket, and Sam received a text message from her, letting him know that they stopped to buy food for lunch and that Jack wanted to stop for ice cream too.
And Cas opens his eyes a little wider, tilts his head slightly and then pushes the plate towards Dean, who picks it up and doesn't take long to take a bite.
Whether it was his fault or not, he felt responsible for the pain Dean had suffered, and for the irreparable damage to the world Dean had tried to protect from the bad things in his life. So Castiel did as Dean asked, he erased Lisa and Ben's memory, he wiped the evidence that Dean Winchester had once lived with them, he brought back Matt, Lisa's boyfriend the demons had killed… Everything this while he was in the middle of a war, during a desperate search for Purgatory, just so Dean could have what he thought was needed for once. And if Dean had asked him to erase his memories too, so he wouldn't suffer remembering what he couldn't keep, even if Castiel had thought it a mistake, he would have done it. If that's what Dean needed, it's what Cas would give him…
1h 40m later, Cas and Dean watch the final credits. Out of the corner of his eye, Cas sees Dean rub his hands over his eyes, and he thinks Dean's eyes look more watery. Dean clears his throat.
Amara asks, leaning in his direction. He has considered it kind of her to wait a few moments before waking him from his thoughts.
Dean blinks then chokes and throws a portion of his sandwich away, coughing to recover. The eyes open and he starts to smile.
"You certainly fulfilled a good part of that plan, but, Jack, you are not Chuck" Amara says firmly "Nor could it be."
"She is a very efficient Queen, apparently." Sam shrugs "Maybe she really can get Amazon to deliver there after all."
Jack puts more force into his movements, his feet seem to want to sink into the hard floor as he struggles to pull the invisible bond between them and Cas.
It is Castiel who this time leans over to Dean and hugs him. Dean hugs him back, with a smile on his face, and he knows that Cas already has his decision and that he is willing to go ahead with it.
Two days ago Charlie arrived at the Bunker and did a lot more than just fix a computer. Castiel and Dean need to talk about something between the two of them.
The Winchesters were also not the kindest to her, of course, she had chosen to trust Dean and this proved to be a mistake. However, she no longer blamed him. He made mistakes, but like her, he didn't ask for the role that Chuck tried to force him to act. Unfortunately, some beings and people received special attention from her brother, and that included the Winchesters and therefore those who were close to them. And Jack...
Amara wanted to have the right to express the power of which she was formed, nothing more and nothing less than that was her initial desire when walking on Earth... But, this planet and these fragile beings are capable of awakening feelings that she herself did not know how to be able to feel. Even if it is not how a person feels, anyway. However, that tenderness born of the ability to appreciate everything that she could not be still dwelt in her, and that, of course, included the humanity.
He says keeping his body upright and his eyes on the wall that days ago had swallowed Cas to an infinite emptiness, but full of remorse and fear.
When they get back to the Bunker, Dean is a little disappointed. He doesn't really know what to say, but this one sure wasn't like the dates that, when he tried to date someone, he's already had... Their dynamic was basically the same and maybe that's not a problem, but maybe they aren’t what they were thinking they could be. They walk down the hall, close to each other and Dean can feel the anxiety churning inside him, the undeniable presence of Cas so close. They stop in front of Dean's bedroom door.
"‘Dean Winchester was wrong’ he thinks now, for good, as he hears his family wishing him congratulations, with Patience taking some pictures and Cas close by hugging him. Everyone has fun and tells jokes, talking banalities... But in the case of this family, banalities involve telling about the time that fairies were a national threat or when a werewolf once had to remove all teeth, or when vampires pretended to be vampires to attract people who wanted to be attracted to vampires. It is the normality that Dean knows and wants to share with others."
Castiel does not have a ready answer for this. As well as the lack of his wings, riding in a car, shopping, buying food, drinking beer, watching movies… All of this became part of him, and although he still feels strange between angels and humans, Castiel had finally found the familiarity in being who he is, close to the people he loves, and those people are human… He just started wanting to walk at the same pace as them, and every time he noticed Dean’s aging, for example, he allowed his body to advance the same time stage. He didn't want Dean or Sam to look at him and feel that he wasn't one of them... Although that sounded ridiculous, because Castiel is certainly not human...
After hitting the road, only Dean and Sam at Impala 67, as they hadn't done in a while, decided to stop at a bar to play pool, betting money just for the fun of seeing their opponents' surprised and upset faces. Sam made sure to assure Dean that they didn't have to hurry to get to Krissy. He wanted his brother to enjoy that trip, because he knows that Dean doesn't miss the problems, but he does miss the old days on the road. No matter how much Dean has changed, he hasn't stopped loving what he loved before Chuck lost.
Cas is not so sure what to do, he gets up and goes towards Dean, considering that he must ensure that he understands that they are family and that this has not changed.
Then Dean sees that Eileen comes over too and grabs Castiel's other arm, both of them pulling until Cas' entire body is ejected from that hole. Sam finishes reciting at the same time and closes the book, he drops it on the floor while rushing to catch Eileen who staggers until she falls into his arms.
As he gets out of the car, Dean pretends to be surprised, almost crossing the line of what is a convincing pretense, and exchanges a look with Sam, who rolls his eyes, but says nothing about having been discovered before. Dean realizes that they are having a barbecue, with Garth helping to serve the meat.
Sam hears the Bunker's door open and Dean comes down the stairs after taking Miracle in his arms. Dean looks soft and comfortable holding the dog down the steps, careful not to lose his balance.
Dean, Sam and Cas exchange looks in Jack's direction. He was watching the whole situation, with a little disgust at the tip of his stomach. Jack participated in the decision to heal all monsters, and he knew back then that no matter how promising the consequences were, it could still have a bad side effect for someone. He remembered having his grace taken away from him in a non-consensual way, he was hurt by Lucifer and it cost him a part of who he was. However, he knows that this traumatic experience did not remove him from his main characteristics and did not prevent him from moving forward, but that did not invalidate the fact that it had been difficult and painful... He did not intend to inflict this type of loss on anyone.
They have the laptop, the popcorn bucket and some beers in front of them. He needs to choose a movie. He thinks of the options in front of him, the Netflix catalog is so vast, it feels like it's going to take forever before he finds something to watch. Suddenly he sees a blue image that catches his eye.
Since the big television crashed, he's been visiting that place less often, in part because the time didn't seem in his favor either, with all the new stream of hunters he's met in the Bunker after Michael returned him… And Michael… Dean for sure didn't have much time to relax between that and losing Jack.
Charlie presses a hand on his tense shoulder, almost giving him a start, but then Dean relaxes a little.
Jack has a bowl full of popcorn for himself. He eats without even realizing it, while with his mouth full, he points to something in the scene, either because he is excited or because he needs an explanation. Jack likes to hear the comments from each of his parents, because Dean answers something as if that thing or speech is the coolest thing (or boring, depending on the movie) that the character could have done, but Castiel usually corrects him by making the meaning of what’s on the screen strictly direct and literal, except when he decides to explore some philosophical allegory, and in turn Sam contextualizes the production of the film and why the director would have chosen such speech, photography and ... It is as if Jack saw multiple movies at once.
And Castiel doesn't doubt that. Often, he and Dean don't talk about what's going on between them, or about possible disagreements before it gets out of hand, but Castiel knows... There's a light in Dean that can be recognized when someone gets close enough to him, he radiates a unique warmth, and everyone who knows Dean sees it, feels it in him... He is like a Lighthouse, lighting the way, as he hides himself in the shadows, he barely realizes that his light is what keeps so many sailors safe, is what illuminates the tides and the rocks, preventing so many souls from sinking, drowning… But Dean isn't just the Lighthouse, he's also the one who makes it his job to keep the light on, he wakes up every day, he lies down thinking about the dark world that needs light, even if he's not sailing the same waters... What Dean doesn't know, or perhaps hasn't told himself yet, is that Castiel doesn't need to see his light to get to him, Castiel could find his light even if he was blind...
Dean stops spinning when his vision finds Cas, standing there with his head bowed. He's been watching Dean's reaction intently, and Dean remembers to breathe. Cas has felt he has failed ever since Sam was shot and kidnapped by the British, then Lucifer remained on the loose, Kelly escaped pregnant and he and Sam were captured… However, Dean knows that Cas doesn't need to feel that way… For sure the last few days didn't help, all the mess with Billie didn't help, and Dean wished he could express his concern in another way, but no matter how bad he wants to, sometimes things just come out of him defensively or angrily… And Cas has only been trying to help. Now with this room he has been trying to help Dean, not with the fight against Lucifer, the British, or the next antichrist… He wanted to help Dean have something more for him in his own house, a place where other problems couldn't enter .
and he had returned home when everything seemed to be lost and he brought with him a hope that they would be able to rescue Cas from the shit of deal that the angel made without telling him.
Jack is still confused and as time goes by, he feels that all the power he carried a few moments ago is drained more quickly.
In the corner of Dean's mind, countless preconceived guilt and insecurities come together to threaten him.
Dean caught himself, frowning and drawing his brows together as if inwardly scolding himself for making it this far, then continued.
speech and he wasn't the least bit kind when he used those words or his hands on him... And Kevin is exhausted. Castiel now understands how much human exhaustion can weigh, it weighs on the bones, the flesh, every part of the body, but it weighs on the mind and feelings in a way that Castiel has so far not been able to digest. The earthly experience, in a human vessel, was already intense in itself, but nothing compares to actually feeling everything at once, without a filter, without a healing process and without being able to silence every physical or other need that insists on making an interior noise. It's disconcerting. And Kevin lost his mother in the process, Castiel can't imagine the pain of that loss, just thinking about it something scratches and squeezes, reducing the space in his lungs.
They took the dog to the Vet, to check if it had a chip or was being looked for by someone. Sam has never seen Dean show such an almost instantaneous appreciation for an animal, and he has feared that his brother would have to give up that dog he barely knew and had already given a name to. They paid for exams and kept Miracle in the shelter until the situation at Bunker seemed calmer. After all, they didn't want to have to worry about the dog jumping into the strange void of the Empty while they tried to bring Cas back.
Dean hears Castiel speak in a low, tired voice. Dean closes his eyes and in that second everything is fine.
Cas starts but is interrupted by a Charlie saying “no, no, you better stay here and…” and she looks at Dean as if asking for backup.
Cas shook his head slightly, looking slightly surprised and confused, an almost imperceptible smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. Dean noticed this and cleared his throat before speaking.
Castiel notices that Dean tore small pieces of the beer bottle label with his fingernails, it's something small, but it still catches his attention. Castiel accepted Dean's words, the support they offered, Dean knows how to be tender without realizing what he's offering, but Castiel sees it… Dean almost brought Ben into the conversation, and despite what he did for Sam during childhood and for a lifetime already qualifying him to understand this kind of affection, Castiel knows that the experience with Ben had been important to Dean, and painful… Even though Dean said it was better to forget some things, he himself didn't choose to forget Ben or Lisa… Castiel, years ago, after a succession of unintentional mistakes, tried to give the minimum comfort to that family, whose safety Crowley threatened without his consent. It didn't matter, he still feels responsible for part of what happened.
When they get there, they find Jack with his mouth full of cereal and a surprised look. He greets them with a smile, his cheeks full.
Castiel smiles, his eyes not following this movement. He remembers breathing as he admires Dean at his side, filling his hand with popcorn. They are in this cycle: Dean forgives him and Castiel saves him, like last time, by deciding to kill Billie. Neither of them is willing to give up on the other, neither of them will put their stubbornness aside for now, as they have very strong wills, and in most cases, they tend to have more compassion for the other than for themselves…
Dean raises his eyebrows and hesitates a little, Jack can see how that thought goes through Dean like an icy blade. He pulls himself together as best he can before Sam or Eileen turns to see him.
She stops as soon as she finishes down the stairs, with Dean beside her. Castiel is already up waiting, Kevin and Sam join them. Charlie speaks first.
Sam turns to everyone, he has that responsible posture that inspires authority and admiration without straining.
Jack nods, but there is an inner discomfort. He realizes that in one way or another he is playing god, deciding the lives of thousands of people without consulting them. He knows that this is more complicated than a simple decision, but he considers that the monsters exist there as a constant threat created by Chuck and that as far as possible they are balancing the forces between the human and the supernatural world.
Charlie walks towards Castiel and hugs him, catching him off guard, he's still not that familiar with these gestures of human affection coming from people he doesn't know very well… The only person who initiated a hug with Castiel so far was Dean.
As he speaks, Dean arranges the place for them to sit in the way he suggested. He then smiles at Cas and turns the body to the empty wall in front of them.
Jack is barely three years old. He certainly learns things very quickly and easily compared to an ordinary human, as Jack was never quite an ordinary human. Now, every piece of his body radiates internally with a strange power, that power takes over his body transmitting thousands of small and large knowledge every second. Jack is not comfortable with that and something inside him reacts.
Jack shouts, feeling that the noise inside the Empty is stilling. And it isn't just noise, it is like waves hitting everyone... Maybe the whole world will wake up with a migraine the next morning.
Dean gasps wordlessly, actually he has the words, but as usual they refuse to come out easily. He looks at Cas, with more affectation than he intended.
Amara smiles and there is almost tenderness in her, and something deeper in his eyes that Jack cannot describe.
All of this lasts less than a second in the eyes of Sam and Dean, who watched their victory against Chuck. After the final verdict, they leave him in the middle of nowhere, as human as any other vulnerable being in their stories since the beginning of all creation.
And at the same time the two are in another universe. The sky inexplicably close, with soft clouds that seem to dissipate without the wind. There are thousands of stars, literally blinking, and eventually there appear to be small, bright, colorful explosions.
This is something Dean is sure of, because Cas would have heard every prayer he made trying to reach him, he would have felt Dean like every time before, and Lucifer knew it... Lucifer knew how to stop Cas from reaching him, how to silence the request to an angel... And he must have got everything ready before he was sent back to Hell. Dean wants to hug Cas, but restrains himself so as not to make the moment any awkward.
"Sam laughs. Castiel slept more than twelve hours straight after becoming human, but he looks fine despite the confusion after waking up. Eileen and Jack went out in the morning to shop at the supermarket, and Sam received a text message from her, letting him know that they stopped to buy food for lunch and that Jack wanted to stop for ice cream too.
Cas kept his expression steady, but a shadow hovered there…apart from a few sad spots in his blue eyes.
Jack speaks for himself, but he also includes the Winchesters in his thinking, because he knows that they will not give up on bringing Cas back if there is a single miserable spark left.
Cas has his back to the door, washing the dishes with the warm water. Dean stops by the door and watches him, the blue T-shirt, no sleeves, he'll end up getting cold.
Dean tightens his fingers on the steering wheel, and blinks for a second. It's not that, but some memories of him when he was a teenager and realized he was attracted to men and women, with a slight panic about what his father might think, return to the surface. He shakes his head.
Jack is stunned. He had felt a fraction of what it would be like to carry the weight of Chuck's power and barely recognized himself. He can still feel Amara's pulsing power around him and knows he has a choice to make. Jack is afraid, as he had not been since the first moment he saw himself on Earth and had to grow up fast to feel more secure.
Cas doesn't need Dean to do his job to light the way to find him, because Castiel was set on fire by touching Dean for the first time, he's been lit by Dean since pulling him out of Hell... Castiel every day, and at each new moment, he is able to hear Dean, see him and feel him with something the angels are not supposed to have… Castiel's heart was incredibly filled with love for humanity, and he professed his faith in front of the man who made him believe that the world deserves to be saved. Castiel has faith in Dean Winchester. Dean Winchester has faith in Castiel, and this is more than he could ask for in return... Dean Winchester is not alone, and there is more love between them than Castiel can describe in words, one day maybe they will get there... A part of the angel, a part that perhaps remains more human than he thought possible, wishes he could help by being present as one of the lights that illuminates Dean's return to safety. Because if Dean finds a home to return to, Castiel knows there's a chance he belongs somewhere on Earth too, with him.
I hope this fic can bring good feelings to anyone who is willing to read it. It was something I didn't intend to write, but I ended up enjoying writing.
They park Impala 67, and before they leave, Sam moves Dean's box of tapes, he arches an eyebrow when he finds a mixtape with a tag identifying the
And then he held Cas' gaze until he deflected it, taking a sip of beer as if it were something casual
Cas said softly. Too soft for Dean to maintain any good wit posture. This idiot would make him look like an idiot one of these days, Dean thought.
Cas says with a raised eyebrow, picking up his fork and eating another piece of the pie that Dean had completely forgotten to finish.
Charlie came to visit them after being fired as she found out that the company she worked for was outsourcing to child labor, so she took a big Wikileak all over that... Now she is helping them to learn how some of the old computers, relics powered by magic and technology, work... She has been in the Bunker for two days and for the first time she has met Kevin and Cas. They decided to take a break and watch some series and movies, so far they managed to watch almost the entire first season of Game of thrones.
The confession is quick, but not painless. Dean wonders why he finally decided to talk about it now. He certainly could have deflected or avoided the subject with a few excuses and barriers, although he knows how strong Charlie's presence is… But Cas is human now, Cas is living with them, perhaps more permanently… Cas is sharing the kitchen, the bathroom, the library and spending nights watching movies and falling asleep beside Dean… For the first time Cas is a constant, and the whole reality of their relationship, the looks, the closeness, the accidental touches and the not-so-accidental touches… And the desire to hug him, to laugh with him... Everything is more present than it has ever been, and maybe Dean doesn't want to shut it all up, maybe if there's a chance he wants to hear about it... However, he's sure he isn't ready to ask and hear from Cas himself, so Charlie is his best option because she is there asking, leaving everything open and being herself, no awkwardness, no judgment, just his best friend and sister saying he can talk and it is alright.
Dean lowers his eyes, before looking up again, expressing something that Cas can't describe. A sincere half smile appears on Dean's face.
Dean flinches and swallows. He prayed a few times in his life, but most of the time he prayed only to reach one of the only beings he trusted entirely, even after dark times. Cas had asked him to trust Jack years ago, and so many times later... This time Jack asks Dean to trust him by alluding to the one act that connected him to Cas when they were both separated and lost from each other.
Dean thought about them watching a movie in his bedroom, but Cas called him as soon as he got the laptop. They walk down one of the Bunker's corridors, Dean has already been to that part of the place and he knows that the room Cas is going to has a pile of furniture and boxes, possibly things that the Men of Letters owned and hoped to accommodate in the Bunker before them being interrupted by Abbadon. Sam and Dean promised to organize that room after finishing the inventory of magical objects, but since the first goal was not completed, they came to the conclusion that whatever was in there could wait.
English is not my first language, but I wanted to practice and I wanted to try to write about SPN and I combined these two. So, unlike Castiel, sometimes I get the words wrong, usually tenses. But I'm glad that some people liked the fic.
Cas turns his face fully to see Dean, eyes narrowed, head tilted and eyebrows drawing together as he tries to figure out what that detached vibe of what happened on television is all about.
Dean felt the air around them grow heavier. It was a brief sensation, but it made him watch Cas more carefully, usually when Cas started something that seemed pointless, the truth was that the point was more of a choked lump in his throat.
And Dean realizes what happened. Amara finally fulfilled another part of her promise and the monsters, perhaps all of them, were healed. However, Garth's reaction did not seem to be something that was already resolved with everyone happy on board this solution. They would have a lot to explain.
And Castiel is again visible in the Bunker. Dean's voice calls out to him, his steps going towards him. Castiel thinks about debuting his new wings, but decides to remain petrified as he is. When Dean appears at the entrance, Castiel puts the ring in his trench coat pocket. He has to face some pending issues that seem almost from another life.
I've been writing it as an exercise, so it's possible that there are errors that have passed without me realizing it. I'm not really sure about the final product of this story, but I leave it here. I hope it was on some level a good read, at least.
Cas doesn't lower the plate he's holding, but his eyes continue to stare at Dean, now with more attention.
And after that Dean nods, first to Cas and then to Amara grudgingly. Then Amara proves what she was saying, and with a snap of her fingers she and Cas are no longer with them in the basement. Dean looks at Sam, mumbles something, but takes a deep breath when looking at Jack, who seems to be less shocked and worried about the whole situation and just tilts his head when he doesn't get a
Despite this excerpt, this chapter is mostly devoted to Sam and Dean. And although it is a story with a happy ending, one passage may resonate due to a specific line from 'Carry On' (but it is a brief thing and this is a happy story). Nobody dies.
When they finally arrive in front of the door, Cas opens it using one arm, while holding a bucket of popcorn in the other. Dean stops at the entrance, his eyes wandering around the place, clean, the boxes all piled up in the corner. A small wooden table, two armchairs, and the shelves are also clean. There's nothing impressive there, but for sure the storage room is more organized and the space it has is more visible.
Dean snorts a little skeptical, a little terrified and surprised. A familiar sadness crosses his eyes again.
Then Dean enters the room, puts the laptop on the table. He knows he'll be able to demonstrate better than telling Cas that everything is fine.
And the rest of the sentence was suspended. Maybe one day they could all really feel what true happiness was? Cas sure deserved it, Sam too, Jack and who knew… Maybe even he deserved it one day.
Dean asks, leaving the rest of the pie on the plate. The hand touched Cas' shoulder and squeezed it to express presence and comfort.
more easily. Now he didn't have to swallow it. He places the small sphere in the center of his hands and closes it, cupping it, concentrating on the image of The Garden. When he brings his hands close to his chest, he pushes the sphere inwards and with the awakening of a light, the small object starts to be in it, without difficulty. When Jack opens his eyes, he is standing in the middle of The Garden.
Jack ponders that question and answers it with the sincerity that is still his greatest characteristic "I don't know, I should defeat Chuck, I think. Die for it if it were the case and save my dads, my friends and the world... But now I know that Chuck's power still exists, is still here ” Jack gestures to himself, Amara and the entire Garden.
Dean raises his eyebrows in warning, he knows that something is wrong, that something is bothering him.
"Three days after they beat Chuck and Amara to take control, something happens. During the night Jack wakes up to find Castiel in the map room, both alert because the world has definitely changed, and they can feel it."
Dean was sleepless, which happened quite often, even after Michael left his body, and even before… Sleeping more than three or four hours was a great achievement for his body, already unaccustomed to relaxing.
And the conversation gets lost for Castiel, because none of that means much to his understanding… Maybe he should look for Tolkien's books in the library later. For now, the only thing he can think of is that those two humans were essential to helping clean up the mess he'd caused in the world, the first of them... And that in the end, he wasn't even able to protect Dean from being dragged to Purgatory.
Cas, without saying anything, nods softly as if he agrees with the question. Dean runs a hand over Cas' cheek.
Amara puts her hand on Jack's shoulder and he immediately feels an avalanche that shook his whole body. A noisy crowd seems to infiltrate Jack's head and a high-pitched buzzing crosses his ear. Amara removes her hand and everything returns to the previous calm.
Charlie had gone on a new adventure with Dorothy towards Oz and the Emerald City. Kevin and Sam stayed in the Bunker, trying to unravel the angel tablet and keeping Crowley under control. Meanwhile, Dean and Cas went to a mid-night session to watch Tombstone. The romantic date didn't actually present any big news to their dynamics. They watched the movie, shared popcorn, Dean commented, whispering some parts and was totally silent in others, and every now and then they missed parts of the movie to see each other's reactions, finding themselves in the middle of a session reserved just for the two.
They had taken some of Bunker's own tables there, on the larger one, there was a lot of food and a cake with Rice Krispie treats, which Alex, Jody and Jack helped to prepare. Castiel bought green balloons, because they reminded him of Dean, and some blue ones, because they were cute, with luck, he managed to keep they tied to the floor by a line, floating. There was a considerable amount of gifts on another table.
Dean had found Cas in the library and called him into the kitchen. Now Dean is looking for some beers, because after all, he's already awake anyway, and Cas for some reason is making a sandwich. Dean notices that Cas is peeling off the bread.
2. This story started because I saw a post saying that Claire and Jack never met, so I wanted to write the kitchen scene, but I ended up thinking too much about everything that would have to happen for them to get there ... And then I ended up thinking about what would come next
Now they are in the Bunker with the projector on. It seems like a scene that has repeated itself so many times, but now it is as if they finally live what that moment is: a banal, but no less valuable part of their lives. They pushed the table away and placed cushions on the floor. Sam and Eileen are very close, from time to time Eileen raises her face to kiss him and for some reason this always seems to make Sam smile cheerful and a little awkward, as if that precious gesture was surprising despite the repetition.
Maybe one day, Dean thought... Maybe one day he’d be able to ask Cas again what the answer to his true happiness was, and Cas would answer without fear of having what he wanted... A small hope, which Dean no longer wanted to recognize, spread warm in his chest. Perhaps he would be able to face that door without fear of moving forward, he would approach knowing he deserved that place, allowing himself for the first time to open the door and find the words he missed to describe what he wanted to be truly happy too... If something like that were possible for someone like him... And maybe, if that happens, Dean wouldn't be alone when he decided to open that door… Could good things happen to him? Dean thought again about his family, catching a glimpse of Cas beside him, and told himself
3. I'm unsure of posting this story because I don't usually write like this, this is my first fic, and because I decided to write in another language that limits what I can do... I hope it was understandable for those who followed.
And that's all Dean manages to say without giving too much away, but letting a not-always-appearing softness fill the sound of those words.
Amara wanders her hand over the garden floor, it is as if she feels everything that is buried there as part of herself.
After two full plates, Dean steps back a little and supports his back against a tree. He watches Cas from a distance, he is holding baby Castiel and playing with him all silly.
1. Well, this chapter was an accident that I liked to write ... Maybe accidents don't happen accidentally, after all
Dean feels bad, for many reasons. He couldn't react to Cas' loss, he couldn't fight, think or say anything useful in those moments before he found himself alone and sitting on the floor, with his face on his knees and crying... He still hadn't discovered that the world had become an immeasurable loneliness, but at that moment it was as if he had lost any chance of moving forward. Not only did Cas leave the basement and an empty chair in front of him, it was as if a part of him had been sucked in while Cas kindly still offered him a smile and a new world with words of welcome full of... love.
Castiel nods, still speechless and with his fist hiding the ring. Amara waves a hand. "And take care of Dean... You know." and with a smirk she disappears.
Dean asks, slightly in awe, pointing his arm at the sandwich, beer in his hand. He raises an eyebrow.
Sam and Kevin interrupt at the same time, and Charlie just half smiles and nudges him with her elbow.
Being a restored angel was advantageous, and if the world got off track again, he would be more useful in a battle if he had his powers... A part of Castiel was agitated by these thoughts, because for so long his nature was tied to the fact that he should be a
Cas pulls back a little and Dean notices a tear coming out. He reaches into his pocket and takes out a silver ring, with a transparent stone that covers the entire circumference.
