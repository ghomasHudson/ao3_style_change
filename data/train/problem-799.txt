Dainty hand guides the keys to the door, trembling fingers missing the opening. It takes three times for him to get the key in, shaky breathes of frustration and furrowed brows giving away the struggle and making the point of hiding it useless.
2AM. He is not waiting. There's something wrong with the glass of the windows. There's no John crossing the street and picking the keys out of his pocket behind the glass. Or maybe it's just the dust.
Lestrade looks baffled at him, lips parted and head tilted forward. When he sees John is not joking, he seems to get a grip on himself. «'sorry man, but I don't even think Sherlock likes- » he gesticulates eloquently, hands waving and eyes looking for agreement in John's.
«I am normal.» three heads snap fast towards a death-looking Sherlock who is leaning against the doorframe, gripping it weakly with a pale thin hand.
«Then answer me, what is all of this about?» touch is still steady on his pulse, voice a little softer now.
Sherlock was not allowed to look at John. Everytime his eyes rested on the doctor he felt punches and kicks all over again. Bruises forming in new spots, bleeding cuts opening on the other cheekbone. He couldn't look at John. And John didn't know why and something kept telling him he shouldn't investigate further for once in his life.
Sherlock is staring at him with wild eyes, breath laboured and goosebumps on the skin of his forearms. What's going on?
Guys as some of you might have noticed, I modified the chapters. It's basically the same as before, but i wrongfully titled the first two and missed a bit of the first chapter so i just corrected it and uploaded another fresh chapter! My sincere apologies,
A couple of times she swore she heard him sobbing. He told her everything, about his bestfriend committing suicide, jumping in front of his eyes. What he didn't tell her, his nightmares did. He talked vividly, screaming often and crying and trashing and sobbing and it was horrible. But she could not deny that after almost two years, his reactions were still a bit unusual. He was a soldier. He saw death. He's a doctor and a surgeon and he'd seen blood and dead bodies and death of loved ones.
Sherlock's lips hesitate a little, faint stubble on his upper lip now visible. Sherlock never lets his beard grow. «Yeah, that's...that's fine. Thank you for helping me today. See you tomorrow, John.» the detective force a smile on his mouth but it comes off like a grimace.
«Everything and nothing, I am afraid. These episodes do not need a particular trigger to happen, doctor.»
Sherlock knows the tone too well, memories of childhood full of whispered diagnosis exchanged between Mummy and the doctors, lips moving carefully while Mycroft covered his ears with both of his hands, holding his little brother close to his chest while matching his back and forth rocking. «You don't need labels, little brother.» it's what he said to him during the bad moments.
Not that John is looking at him, though. He's to slabs away from him, discussing papers with Graham? Giles? Greg Lestrade.
There's a soft thud coming from his room. Sounds like the headboard of the old bed is hitting the wall in a shaken rhythm. If she didn't knew Sherlock was inside the room, She might have thought about something dirty going on between the four walls. But since IT IS Sherlock, the anxiety is tugging at her stomach, bile running up her throat. «Sherlock, can i come in...?» she barely thouches the door handle that something crush loudly against the door, wood cracking ugly and the thing shattering against it and on the floor.
Two years of runaway thaught him one of the most ridicolous and yet important lessons of his life: comfortable silence is overrated. And what stood between them was not comfortable. It was not silence. It was loss and mourning and he didn't think it through.
He wished he could fill his empty heart with water, the same way he replenished half drank scotch bottles to make them look untouched.
She is real, she is alive. It's not a nightmare or a drug-fueled hallucination. Mary exists in John's world.
John turns to him, careful eyes searching for emotions. Does he look sad? Do i look sad? Does John look sad?
«Hey, you here? You zooned out.» fingers are running in front of his face, just long shadows disturbing his concentration. He shuts his eyes harder.
He didn't. He sits up and walks past John and into the kitchen. Fridge open, eyeballs out. Bin open, eyeballs in. He turns to John, arms open and a petty expression playing on the tight curve of his lips.
John is angry at him. Stupid, stupid Sherlock! Of course he's angry. Of course apologising has not been enough! He hurt John, stil hurts him.
This reminds Sherlock of the first chase after the mad cabby. That walking cane gone long forgotten in a nook. He needs to shake his head to clear his mind.
Pulling away, John watched as Sherlock’s eyes remained closed, his mouth pouting in search for more kisses; his face was flushed, a pale pink that was dusting over his cheekbones and his nose.
and his skin felt like it was crawling and the old lady was rubbing her hand on his back and it felt like razor blades and he needed to
John pulled himself out of her grip and covered his eyes with one hand, exhaling loudly. He was beginning to feel more sober as time went on and he felt ashamed of himself for acting this way in front of Mrs. Hudson.
"What is it?" John automatically brought his hand up to his hair out of fear that she may have messed it up somehow.
“Yes, yes, John is handsome. I’m quite aware,” Sherlock snapped impatiently. “Now if you’ll excuse us –“ Sherlock took John’s hand and started to lead him upstairs.
John nodded, put on his coat, and made his way across the studio to the door and opened it to leave. He stopped when he heard Sherlock rushing over to where he was.
Okay, so re: John and Mary sending out invites with only four weeks to go until their wedding ... I know four weeks is hardly ANY time with a marriage to be sending out invitations, but for the sake of the story, I’m saying four weeks. Maybe John and Mary are just super duper slack and haven’t gotten around to sending them until now, okay? Don’t judge their procrastination.
John moved so he was sitting up, his open legs kneeling underneath Sherlock’s so he could lift Sherlock’s legs and angle himself at his entrance. He pressed gently, nudging, and Sherlock sucked in a breath. John raised his eyebrows.
“What do you think?” Sherlock said sarcastically, quirking his eyebrows at John as he returned his attention to John’s feet, starting on his other shoe.
“You … you told me, remember?” Sherlock was becoming more uncomfortable as time went on, understanding now that him showing up unannounced was slightly presumptuous on his part. “But I have to, uh, meet a friend anyway, so I can’t stay.” He lied.
“Right,” Sherlock announced, spinning around to move into the middle of the room. “First step goes as follows.”
John stood in his doorway watching Sherlock go – he felt terrible and slightly dejected. John had told Sherlock he would love to show him where he worked, but that was not how he wanted it to go. Looking over at Marlene, she was regarding John with raised eyebrows.
John blinked slowly and met her gaze and suddenly his face crumpled into anguish, wet mazes of tears tracking down his cheeks.
“Mrs. Hudson,” John attempted to sound normal, moving forward and taking the bags from her hands. “Here, let me help you with that.”
He squinted against the bright light, finding Sherlock standing in the kitchen, his hand reaching into a cupboard, back turned.
“You can’t keep running away from this, you know,” she said. “You’re gonna have to tell her at some stage.”
“I’ve decided to take up dancing lessons,” John spoke quickly, his eyes not looking up at his fiancé who was standing across from him in their kitchen - he didn’t want her to catch a glimpse of the rosy red that was creeping up his neck.
“Don’t laugh, John,” Sherlock said in mock indignation, his hand coming up to half-heartedly cover his wet locks.
John stood, clenching and unclenching his fists. He was working himself up, starting to get furious at Harriet for being so damn unflappable about this. John turned and started pacing across the floor before turning and angrily launching a kick at the base of the bed. Couldn’t she see that he loved Mary too? Couldn’t she see what it would mean if he were to tell her about Sherlock?
Mary was standing in the car park, her eyes watching John darkly, and he knew she had seen his entire interaction with Sherlock, including their kiss. John hurried up to her, excuses already spilling from his mouth, but she raised one hand to silence him. She was dressed in her bone white wedding dress, looking utterly beautiful, but the expression on her face made her terrifying at the same time. John had never seen her like this.
John didn’t answer, instead he angrily brushed away the few tears on his cheeks and watched the houses pass out of the window. How could he have let this happen? It wasn’t meant to be this way. He was supposed to be learning to dance for his fiancé, going home to her, getting
“Yes! In this case, it is! Mary isn’t some doll that you can just manipulate for your own agenda! She is a human being with feelings and emotions and she deserves to know that you’ve done this to her! This isn’t some fib you’re telling a child! This is your future
“Do you …” John was licking Sherlock’s left ear, tasting the salty sweat that was now wetting his skin. “Do you have lube?”
He heard the crowd erupting into enthusiastic applause, but he didn’t stop to clap with them. He couldn’t – he needed to get out to some fresh air so he could still his beating heart. He needed to close his eyes and attempt to scrub away the imprint of Sherlock’s haunted expression as he danced. If this performance was for him, he didn’t know what he was supposed to do with it.
Sherlock gave John a small smile and he automatically reached out one hand to grab onto John’s, their fingers linking together, fitting into the imprints they had left behind. For a moment, John wanted to lean forward and kiss his full lips, but instead he pulled his hand out of Sherlock’s and stood hurriedly.
Although John knew she was telling the truth somewhat, he still couldn’t help but feel defensive: he wasn’t
If it had been anyone else, John would have argued back, insisting he wasn’t trying to make it out that way, but for some reason, Mrs. Hudson was making it all so clear and he didn’t have it in him to try and talk his way out of her bad books.
“I can’t listen to this,” John stormed over to where his coat was sitting on the countertop. “I wouldn’t expect you of all people to understand. I don’t know why I even bothered coming here.”
John thought back to the way Sherlock looked at John when they finally said they loved each other: he looked as though he were suddenly breathing again, like the light in his eyes were somehow brighter. He knew that was real. He knew their love was real. He wasn’t ready to give that up. He wanted to fight for Sherlock.
“Oh …” Sherlock wouldn’t stop looking John up and down, as if he couldn’t quite believe his eyes. “You … you followed me here to tell me that?”
“Take it, John. It belongs to you, after all,” Sherlock thrust it in John’s direction again, his aggressive movement betraying the real emotion that was boiling underneath the surface.
John picked a quiet, relatively secluded table in the back corner of the café, allowing Sherlock to go ahead to the counter and order two coffees for them to takeaway. He watched him stand in line at the counter, his hand coming up to his hair and mussing it so his wind swept look was replaced with tidy, small ringlets. When he returned, he sat down opposite John, his inscrutable gaze falling on him.
Sherlock let out a surprised yell, pushing John off him aggressively so he went stumbling backwards. John swore as he regained his balance, before turning to find an older woman, standing in the entryway with a pair of gloves in one hand and a cloth in the other. Her face was one of pure shock and … delight?
It was as though both the men had a million words they wanted to say, perched on the tip of their tongues, but they were unable to say them.
“Okay,” Sherlock whispered, his voice now enticingly close to John’s ear. “I’m going to lead you now. Just feel the music, follow me, and remember to
John allowed his eyes to rove over the sea of people sitting in front of him, thinking about who Sherlock was to John. His friend? His boyfriend? An acquaintance? None of those options seemed to fit.
Sherlock chucked, low and heavy. “John, I don’t care where we do this, just as long as it’s with you. Do you have any idea how long I’ve been waiting for this moment? Please stay.”
John flushed at the compliment and suddenly he was very aware of how intimate this situation felt – green eyes drinking him in, soft hands holding each other tenderly, skin on skin, breathing so close to each other’s space he could almost taste Sherlock – and suddenly John felt …
“No, no. It’s fine,” she answered, relaxed as usual. “Just make sure you bring me back something nice from Sussex, okay?”
"Why are you here?" John's tone was more accusatory than he had intended it to be - he was overwhelmed at seeing Sherlock and it felt like he were suddenly drowning with the need to either hug him or run into the nearest bathroom and hide there until he left.
Once both men were clean, they stepped out of the shower and wrapped themselves in fluffy towels Sherlock provided, padding with dripping hair and feet back down to the bedroom and collapsing on the bed, side by side. John took Sherlock’s hand as they lay together and Sherlock couldn’t stop the smile from appearing on his face.
John ran his hands through his hair, his breath coming out in hard bursts, misting in the cold air. If only Sherlock would come down and just talk to him for once, he could try and make things better. He was sick of being avoided. He had tried multiple times to call him and text him, but after every attempt ending in radio silence, he had given up trying. Now, he felt seeing him in person was the only way they would talk.
having a nightmare, so when you actually found me in the kitchen and suggested that, I found that quite ironic. I guess I should have seen this coming.”
“You’re going to come?” John asked, watching Sherlock closely. The veins in his neck were standing out and John could see the throb of his heartbeat coursing through his body.
“This is my local chiropractor – she’s very good and will help with your shoulder,” he explained, pointing to the number on the front. “And next time I see you, you better be wearing better shoes than … whatever those are.”
John paused, feeling dumbstruck at the exquisite creature in front of him. “Have I told you how happy you make me?” John whispered.
Sherlock nodded, leaving the practice, feeling utterly mortified. This was the first man in many years who he felt he actually had a chance with and somehow, in those few minutes, he had fucked it all up.
Sherlock looked up from unlocking his front door and his mouth fell open when he saw John, his body frozen for a moment as he registered the situation.
Sherlock’s eyes moved up onto John’s and he saw Sherlock’s vulnerability laid bare for him. “How can I be sure you’re telling the truth?” he said in a small voice.
“And …” John slipped another finger inside, slowly allowing Sherlock to become accustomed to the sensation, “this?”
He wasn’t sure why he had called his sister of all people – it wasn’t like they had the most perfect relationship where they could confide in each other when times were tough. The last time they had spoken was over a year ago when their father had suffered from his first stroke, ending up in hospital. Harriet had chosen not to visit and had caused a lot of tension between them, making it difficult for either of them to bridge that gap and contact each other again; it was only now that John had dialled her number and finally taken the first step towards them reconnecting again.
like normal adults. You two love each other, yes?” At John’s emphatic nod, she continued. “So do what people who love each other have done for years and
“Do you want them tracked, sir?” the girl’s voice was bored, her expression echoing that. “People do that with wedding invitations, so …”
Somehow I have managed to finish this chapter, however please let me know if you spot any mistakes or errors in syntax.
John’s eyes welled up again as he took in the bruises Sherlock had sustained from the beating in the morgue. He could never forgive himself for doing that to Sherlock, not ever. However, he did vow to never allow himself to get to that point again.
“Thanks for wake up call,” Sherlock murmured, his lips in John’s sandy hair. “What’s the time anyway?”
John spied Harriet exit the chapel to come and find him, only to stop in her tracks when she saw the tense confrontation. There were a few people around eyeing the pair curiously.
Both Angelo and Sherlock didn’t seem to hear him as Sherlock had taken John’s menu already and was placing an order for them: eggplant parmigiana and a mushroom risotto. He also ordered a sparkling water for himself and, when John was prompted, a red wine. Angelo moved off to place the order, leaving John and Sherlock alone together, regarding each other across the table.
“Well, I’m finished up for the evening and I know a place a block or so over that makes a delicious spaghetti meatball … if you are interested, that is?” Sherlock’s heart was in his throat.
He is so messed up. Everything is so loud. Why is this happening? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?
Small steps, rings clicking on the handrail. Mrs Hudson. Smell of food. She thinks he could confuse gnocchi and human thumbs too. «Sherlock, dear? I brought you something to eat. John said he was going to be late, so i thought-»
John sees red. It looks like in Holmes family runs a bad habit of dismissing one's risk of death. Mycroft voice is so composed, his posture is so relaxed.
risk John's safety. Mrs Hudson's safety. It was madness, the prospect of hitting the concrete for real hunting him the two years he spent away. He didn't
It's not. This is the thing that fuels Sherlock's anger the most. It's not okay, he's not okay. His world is coming crusching down on his head and melts like glue and all he can do is trash around to keep breathing. He's not okay.
He moved out. More than a year ago. It took him months to get himself to open Sherlock's bedroom and another couple of weeks to get inside. It took seven months for his thing to be safe and secure in a couple of cardboard boxes. Two more months for him to actually move out. For the first weeks he kept coming back at 221B after work, keys wouldn't fit in the keyhole and he would hiss profanities under his breath, tears threatening to escape. He couldn't sleep, spent night after night staring at the foreign ceiling; changing side because the bed felt like concrete.
Both: used as a function word to indicate and stress the inclusion of each of two or more things specified by coordinated words, phrases, or clauses.
. His tongue sticks to the roof of his mouth as he thinks so. Dead. It looks like when he visited Mrs Hudson the day he proposed to Mary and Sherlock came back. Dust fills the room, the courtains slightly parted, one side is stabbed to the wall as to remain open.
The first time they went out together, she invited him to get a sandwich at the hospital's bar during a quiet hour. They eated almost in silence, Mary swallowing bread and ham with a bite of anxiety when she saw the man fagocitating the meal with bad hidden hunger.
Mycroft is standing behind his brother, not sure if he should interfere or let them be. But Sherlock is not shaking, he is not tense, his shoulder are not squared in defence. He looks smaller as his black mop of curls hangs lower and lower, fists slowly relaxing.
the tension in the soldier's shoulders leaves his body in a whiff, eyelids heavy and tired. «Jesus Christ.» he rubs his face, thumb and index on each closed eye, pressing down tears. «What was that about, Mycroft?»
calm down Sherlock? He's not remotely reassured by Mycroft's existence, he never looked like it anyway. John's head spins a bit.
«I'm impressed.» John's talking around a mouthful of salad, bread and tuna. In another context Sherlock would have found it disgusting.
The man straighten his shoulders and rubs one finger on his eyebrow. «My bother, he- he often said he saw you back then.»
«Wh-? Sherlock, it smells like shit. Please just throw out that stuff.» increasing voice tone, higher pitch. Frustration.
John, on the other hand, falls from the clouds. «He is?» did Sherlock lose weight? He can't really assure he eats theee meals per day now that he's moved out. «I d-» idn't notice, it's what he almost says, but what kind of friend would say so? He's ashamed and «I don't think he is.» is what comes out next from his mouth.
«Alright, alright Sherlock. Calm down, stay put.» A firm hand takes his pulse. John's hand? Rough but clean, nails cut short. John's.
Finds out John is out tonight. Well since this morning, there are no traces that suggest he's came back home and then gone out again.
«I have no idea where Sherlock spent the past two years, but i know where i have been. Honestly, I don't think this is a conversation we should hav- »
And after two years of six new languages and dialects, just before english started tasting sour on his tongue, he was not allowed to look at John.
He left Mrs Hudson behind. He moved out with no notice, packing his things up while holding breathes to avoid the smell of home to adhere too firmly to the walls of his lungs.
He is going to bring John lunch. He would usually buy something in his pause, but he forgot his wallet this morning, too busy running out of the flat. So that means he had no money for lunch, nor for a taxi. So he had to walk to Bart's and is probably starving by now.
«Neces-» John stands up suddenly, fists tight. «What the hell is wrong with you all, exactly? Is there one of you who is normal or-? »
BETWEEN YOUR HANDS, YOU ARE-» Mrs Hudson pokes out of the door, gives him a stern look. He lowers the tone. «You are the
John watches him as he exits the kitchen with the corner of his eyes, head not lifting, chin tucked against his chest. He needs to clear his throat once,
«Us all? So it's not just me, isn't it?» he's grinning wide, proud of his point being made. Jesus christ, humans.
«Let it out, it's fine. It's fine. » A gentle touch strokes his leg, up and down up and down in a soothing rhythm. It's all fine. An ugly sob shakes Sherlock's whole body, sending all of his limbs in shock by the sudden release. His tongue leaves the pressured contact with the roof of his mouth and the back of his teeth, he can taste blood. «Sorry sorry sorry I'm so sorry John I-» blabbering is not his thing, the words are not the one he'd chose. His body is finally failing his collected mind.
“Yeah, that’s right, John. Just leave me to clean up as always!” Mary called after him. “You’re a bloody lazy bastard!”
“What are you thinking?” John blurted out, attempting to decipher Sherlock’s expression, but failing. He was, as he always will be, an enigmatic masterpiece of actions and reactions that would only be allowed to come forth when Sherlock permitted it.
He thought about what he had said to Sherlock last night – about the fact that he loved him and he considered him home. Did he ever feel this way about Mary? He couldn’t remember. When had he ever felt as if his heart were going to explode from being filled with so much love for her? When had he felt as though she were his oxygen, his reason for getting up in the morning? When had he ever felt as though
He seemed to be talking to himself more than anything, battling with his inner voice, trying to rationalise an irrational situation. He was clenching and unclenching his hands again, his legs moving automatically underneath him.
Four weeks. That’s all that was left until John was going to get married to Mary. That’s all that was left before he had to decide whether to continue the farce that was his relationship with both Mary and Sherlock, or tell the truth to both of them and face the consequences. Four weeks. He told himself he would have decided by then what to do, when really he was nowhere near figuring it out. It felt good to pretend, however.
“Sherlock Holmes,” Sherlock said kindly, extending his hand, his eyes staring intensely into John‘s.
Mary raised her head and kissed John, her hands moving up into his hair. He closed his eyes and kissed her back, desperately searching for the spark he had once felt. She moved her hands to his belt buckle and began to undo his trousers, a giggle escaping her lips.
And John knew he had to leave, before he did something he regretted. So he turned on his heel and began slowly walking back to the carpark. He could feel Sherlock’s gaze piercing the back of his head.
“I don’t know if you’ve noticed, John,” Sherlock started, his eyes in a constant motion of gracing over John’s features as if he were memorising the lines on his face, before moving to look at the table, abashed. “I’m not one for letting my heart tell the truth. My world is very black and white. But now …”
. So don’t you dare tell me I’ve never experienced heartbreak when I’ve been battling with it my entire goddamn life!”
Please remember to comment your thoughts! I always love hearing what you all think and it's good to know if I'm falling short anywhere.
John followed awkwardly, not knowing where to place his jacket, so he just kept it on him, feeling slightly warm, but suffering through it.
?” Harriet couldn’t stop her grin and she leaned forward gleefully, her hands spreading out on the counter. “Oh man, just wait till Dad finds out he has
,” Harriet turned and regarded him seriously. “You are getting married. You can’t continue this way. Mary deserves to know.”
John swayed slightly, feeling lightheaded, and steadied himself by placing a hand on Sherlock’s dresser. He closed his eyes and allowed himself to choke out a quiet sob as Sherlock’s words repeated in his head.
John pulled Sherlock’s wrist that he was still holding onto and placed his other hand on Sherlock’s neck, his lips moving onto the exposed jugular where there was a faint pink bruise forming from his earlier assaults. He grazed his tongue up the side of Sherlock’s neck and then used his teeth to nibble the skin. Sherlock’s body melted into John’s immediately and a breathy “
“Yes,” Sherlock answered simply, as if it were the most normal thing in the word. “I was getting quite tired of her warbling. I’m much more interested in
He wasn’t really sure what he was expecting – all he really wanted was to see Sherlock so he knew he was okay. It had been a few months since their interaction at the wedding and since then, after John and Mary had split up, he hadn’t tried to contact Sherlock, deciding time alone would benefit not only himself, but Sherlock as well. And now he felt as though a weight had lifted off his chest and he was free to breathe again and although some nights were still hard, with the dark thoughts creeping their way into his dreams, those nights came less often. All he needed was to see that Sherlock was in a better place now; he wanted him to be happy, even if it was without John.
“I don’t think I’ll ever get used to that,” Sherlock spoke quietly, his eyes watching the barista behind the counter rush to prepare orders.
Sherlock got up and walked, still naked, into the bathroom. John heard the shower turn on and the door close and took a moment to shut his eyes, allowing himself to move his hands over to Sherlock’s side of the bed, feeling the warmth of where Sherlock had just left.
“The interview is at 9:30am at the studios, so if we catch the 7:30 train tomorrow morning, we should get there in enough time,” Sherlock continued.
John snatched the paper from her, forever marvelling at her ability to not only be incredibly perceptive, but also incredibly vulgar all at once.
John Watson had always been miserable at dancing, especially when compared to Mary who looked positively perfect as she wove her way naturally across the dancefloor, allowing the music to guide her. In the beginning, she had begged John to come out dancing however after the embarrassment of the first few times, it seemed they had given up his attempts in favour of watching his soon to be wife shake her hips while he absentmindedly tapped his feet under the table and nursed a few pints. Now, however, what with their wedding fast approaching in the upcoming months, John had been overcome with the feeling of complete dread at the thought of having to dance in front of all of his friends without any previous practice. Which is why, after much deliberation, John had decided upon a private dance instructor (god forbid if he had to do public dancing lessons in front of others) and had finally gotten round to telling Mary.
“Oh stop playing with your food, John! You’re a bloody child!” Mary suddenly burst out, slamming her fork down on the table.
Sherlock was holding back tears, that familiar crease on his nose making it even more difficult for John to leave. He stood so the pair were face to face and John heard Sherlock’s breath escaping him raggedly.
She turned away from him, moving to their bedroom, leaving John standing in the living room, his pants still undone. He quickly bucked up his trousers and followed Mary, stumbling as he did so. Of course he wanted to sleep with her. Of course he wanted to feel the comfort of her wrapped around him, but truthfully, his heart wasn’t in it. And no amount of alcohol could change that. Entering the bedroom, Mary was sitting on the bed waiting for him, a mischievous glint in her eye.
He pictured himself, years from now, with Mary by his side, a wedding band on his middle finger, possibly a child underfoot, and his stomach tightened even more. But he had promised to her that he wouldn't walk out. She had told him to be sure and now was the time he needed to keep that promise.
His relationship with Mary had always been strained: it had started with his parents not liking her at all. “She’s too promiscuous for you, John.” His father’s words echoed through his mind, remembering the countless fights he had with him when his dad brought up Mary in that way. And of course those fights had sowed the seed of discomfort between Mary and himself, so for the first 6 months of their relationship nearly every few days they were having yelling matches with each other. And Mary, as strong as she was, held her own, throwing back whatever John aimed at her with a passion John hadn’t witnessed before.
“Yeah … well, no actually.” John never knew he could be such an excellent liar and if he weren’t feeling so guilty, he would almost be impressed with his performance.
When he finally felt John kiss him, he felt as though his whole world were suddenly in colour. John pushed his free hand into Sherlock’s soft curls, and as Sherlock’s mouth sighed open, John pushed his tongue inside and
“I don’t know, Harriet!” John exclaimed, his hands being thrown in the air with frustration. “All I know is that everything is a fucking great big mess and it’s
Mary’s face fell into a pout as she lay down in bed next to John, her hand coming to rest on his forearm gently. Her touch seemed to burn into his skin and all John wanted to do was rip himself away from it; instead he simply allowed her to keep her hand on him as she closed her eyes and sighed out “goodnight, then.”
John’s stomach lurched as the voice of Sherlock Holmes came from behind him. Turning automatically, John quickly positioned himself in front of the counter, shielding his current transaction. Sherlock was wrapped in his coat with the collar up, green eyes examining John with ease as he shook out his windswept hair which was in fluffy, soft curls. John could see the people in the line behind peering at the tall, statuesque man with something akin to curiosity – the same curiosity John had felt when he had laid eyes upon him for the first time. So it wasn’t just him that could be automatically swept up by this man, but it was John and only John who had managed to acquire his affections.
“You don’t …” Harriet paused and John glanced up at her – she was staring at John with wide eyes. “You don’t ...
“You need to loosen up, John.” Sherlock stated calmly, as if viciously shaking a man you’ve only known for a few minutes was the most normal thing in the world. “You’re never going to be able to achieve it on your own, so I am going to help you.”
,” the woman admonished Sherlock, stopping him on his way up the stairs. “Don’t be so rude! I’ll bring up some tea.”
She retreated back to her desk, muttering under her breath as John closed the door to his office and threw himself back into his chair, pinching the bridge of his nose between his fingers.
It only took one solid strokes before John was coming undone in the shower, seed spilling from him, only to disappear down the drain. John bit down on one hand to stop himself from crying out, feeling like he was going to cry out Sherlock’s name. Instead a muffled groan escaped his throat as his orgasm rattled through his body. In that moment all he could think about was Sherlock.
John was glad to have his face in Sherlock’s neck so he couldn’t see the flush across John’s face at exposing his emotions to him so openly – be it the afterglow of his orgasm or not, John was allowing his heart to be bared for a moment, which he was not used to doing so easily.
“So did you,” Sherlock answered. His bottom lip quivered slightly as he took in John’s wild face and when he spoke, there were unshed tears sparkling in his eyes. “Go home, John.”
Each week, I will be adding new songs, some of which (like this week) aren't technically featured, but are a part of the story on their own merit. Feel free to follow!
"Yeah, I'm not that hungry at the moment. I'll be fine," John replied, pushing his plate away from him.
Mary was lying in bed asleep, her arm sprawled out onto John’s side of the bed with her book lying open, inches from her fingers. John undressed quickly and slipped quietly into bed next to her, switching off the light. He had attempted not to disturb her, but with the wine making him fumble awkwardly, she woke immediately, eyes opening and falling on John who was now lying in bed.
John accepted the strawberries, putting them on his desk with a quick thank you. The two were still standing awkwardly in his office, neither of them feeling very comfortable at all. Sherlock could feel the awkwardness radiating from John as he stood across from him.
Sherlock was cut off by John abruptly looking up into his face, all tear tracks and bloodshot eyes. He was still holding onto Sherlock’s shirt with tight fists. “I have
As John shut himself in the bathroom, allowing the water to heat up, he leaned on the sink, looking at himself in the mirror.
John used his thumb so trail across Sherlock’s lips, feeling the soft flesh that was so pliant under his fingertips. Sherlock’s blush increased as he allowed John’s fingers to graze over his mouth, pulling his plump lower lip down slightly.
“Oh no, love, no …” John used his free hand to cup Sherlock’s cheek, brushing away the tears that were sitting on his skin. “I don’t want you to cry. Please don’t be sad.”
“I know, I know. I never expected to do this and I hate myself for it. I brought it on myself! And now he’s found out I’m engaged and –“
John was staring out the window of the shop watching people pass by, thinking about the text he had just received from Sherlock confirming their lesson on Monday evening; they had decided instead of seeing each other every seven days, they would now be having lessons every three days – what they would achieve in the multiple times he would be seeing him over the next few weeks John was not certain, but he wasn’t complaining. He was nervous, but also incredibly eager to see Sherlock and be close to him again. John allowed his mind to wander to thoughts of what could possibly occur next time he was with Sherlock – would they end up kissing at the end of the lesson? Would they dance together, closer than they had been before? Would Sherlock pull John back when they broke apart, his lips crashing into his, hard and rough? Or would he be gentle and shy, allowing John to take the lead, pushing his tongue into his mouth with fervour? He imagined Sherlock’s hand pulling at the soft hairs at the nape of John’s neck, tugging them slightly, him sighing into John’s body as they held each other close, their bodies desperate for each other.
John turns and gives him his back, and Lestrade's face looks like he's apologising to Sherlock. In some way. For some reason.
How can he explain the way his brain turns into a swarm of wasps everytime he smells Sarah's parfume on his clothes? There's no rational explanation foor that.
The scents in the room are slowly dissipating, his lungs can't yet expand properly. His chest is hurting.
There's something so wrong about this picture, so wrong. They way Sherlock keeps looking at him with panic, eyes oozing with distress and anxiety.
the detective looks annoyed, his mouth trembling with the instant wave of nausea that comes along with his petty eyeroll. «Why should I? Are you my mother?»
John knows it yet it scares him how misplaced Sherlock looks. His moves are frantic, as if he's trying very hard to make a point but his words just...don't match. He's
Hide like he did when he was 25 and the last fix hit too hard and too soon and he had to crawl in a black wet corner before Mycroft could get to him and help.
«Oh! No dear, he was with such a nice lady. Sarah, was it? Been quite a long time now.» she puts a little tray on the kitchen table. She notices the little faltering of his pocker face. «Oh Sherlock, why don't you just tell him already?» his head snaps up, he feel the muscles in his neck strain a bit.
Maybe that's the whole point right now. Nobody seems to recognise the hell he's been through to save their life, but at the same time he cannot bring himself to believe he deserves recognition. He hurt them, he hurt
«I nee-» he gulps and shuts his mouth, forehead suddenly worried, eyes closed. He presses a hand on his lips and it becomes clear. John rushes the bin in front of him, the recipient full of balled up pieces of paper and glasses and needles. As soon as he sees the bin, Sherlock empties his stomach in it. John sees Mycroft facing away from the scene and then drops his eyes on the vivid red in his friend's vomit. Blood.
eyes lifted, take the image in. John's hands are up in the air, his walls are all down and so is his sureness. Breathe!
More groaning, shuffling of the coat missing the hanger and slipping on the floor. Door closing. Irregularities in the walk.
A confusing chapter about details and realisations. Sherlock doesn't want to die and John doesn't know it. Also, mood swings are definitely a thing.
«I understand you've been through hell. I know what it feels like.» he absently rubs the bad shoulder, Sherlock can almost see the nasty scar under the shirt. «But I had therapy and...friends and it got better.»
He sees what looks like syringes near his naked feet. Nedleless, dirty, broken, empty syringes. Used.
«That's exactly why I didn't tell you before. That look. I told you I am autistic, not that I am dying. Calm down, you're gonna lose your hair.» and he smiles a bit, a tiny little smile that makes John want to fucking cry.
Mycroft puts the small notebook back in his hidden poket, he looks at John with a fake smile plastered on his lips. «My brother is a long term addict, Doctor. His habits have been way worse than this.»
Too much light it can filter through his too tin eyelids and too much noise it keeps pounding in his ears passing throughout the back of his desperate hands shaking the very core of his bones and hammering into his tympanum.
It was supposed to be a nice- no, the best night of his life. He wanted to propose to her. He wanted to start again, all over from the start. Mary was his new start.
«He let me grieve. He knew and he let me grieve. I was about to give up, I w-I almost-» John's voice shakes. It breaks.
«It's not-it's not the same thing, I am afraid. A-and your limp is back anyway.» he's fighting the urge to pull at his curls, to hit his head until a bruise appears. He wants out, he wants John to leave him here and
«Of course he did, it's just the wrong conclusion.» Sherlock's voice is so weak. He is covering his eyes with his palm, face laying in his hand to cover the acid light of the kitchen. «I am not an addict, I am a user. I can stop.»
It's a death wish. John looks at the flat with a fist in his throat, every breathe taken stops midway. Sherlock would never try to kill himself. He would never, right? Sure, his lifestyle is not
Is he safe? What's going on? Mycroft is staring at him with a lopsided grin, displeasure showing in his cold cold eyes. «Sherlock, what did we say about emotions? They get you
«You are not subtle, you know.» Molly is smiling briefly and sadly. Everyone around Sherlock seems to be doing that lately. «You look sad, when you think he can't see you.»
«Yes, because surviving torture was too tiring and I needed a vacancy. What's on your mind, John? How can you possibly think I would ev-»
But even if she knew, no words could have prepared him. He cracks the door open, careful not stepping abruptly in the detective's space.
No date shoes, best shirts and jumpers still in the closet. Not that John knows which shirts fit him better or which jumper brings his eyes out the most. NOT THAT SHERLOCK DOES, anyway. Buzzing in his pocket. Phone. Message.
He's so lost, even more lost now that Molly left his side to put a body is its cell leaving him to the complete mercy of John.
do you want.» he needs his hands, he needs his fingers to be healthy and safe. No serious injury, check. Red lines on his skin, no blood, check. Burning pain, check. Damn John.
Eyes shut, but he can see in the back of his eyelids Mrs Hudson moving things around in her tiny kitchen, cutlery clinking loudly in the sink, the plates sliding against each other and hitting the table surface with a muffled screeching.
«Sherlock?» Lestrade, again. His voice is hammering at the back of his head. «Try not to poison John's shampoo, will ya?» a smug smile on his face. Why is he smiling.
There's too much noise, too many feet stomping around in the building making the floor cracks and too many door shutting and opening shutting and opening shutting and
He gave up so easily, swallowed that miserable act like a medicine for his rampant depression. Not even fucking Anderson believed that shit. But John did. He
John watches as his friend shrinks in size under his sudden mood swing. He never does that. It's not a Sherlock thing to do, being...shaken by people. He rarely has
dare you to think you could leave him like this! In his state, John?» she now does sound like a mother lecturing his son.
His own brows furrow in confusion. «Why are you angry? I'm stating the truth. You stayed more at that woman's place than here, your return home wasn't quite sure so I didn't feel the need to tidy the kitchen.»
«I won't remind you who is a soldier and who's an addict coming down from a suicide mission fueled by life threateting drugs.» he takes a step back, distancing himself from a taken back Sherlock. «But
John is an idiot. «Of course not, but it's still horrible. It's distracting and your dear intended made sure to put her mawkish parfume on it one- no,
«Alright...Mycroft, 'mind to give me a hand?» they lift the detective's arms over their shoulders, one on each side, to help him walk to his black chair. «Sherlock, I need you to look at me. Look at me, Sherlock.»
“Here you go, boys. Much more romantic.” He spoke, lighting it and moving off before John could protest. Sherlock simply smiled, taking a sip of his water.
“No, it’s not about Dad.” John was pacing up and down the street, his anxiety forcing his legs to move. He didn’t know what he wanted to gain from his call to Harry, but it her familiar tones seemed to help him breathe a little. “M’at Victoria Station.”
Eventually the stage was filled with dancers and as they started moving together, their motions elegant and fluid, snowflakes began to flutter from the ceiling on top of their heads. John suddenly sucked in a breath as he realised
When Sherlock saw John walking over, it was as if he suddenly realised where he was, and he quickly turned and fled the church. John quickened his pace, rushing to reach Sherlock before he left entirely, and when he reached him in the parking lot, he grabbed the material of his coat with one shaking hand, forcing him to turn and face him.
John sucked in a quiet breath and withdrew his hand from Sherlock’s face. He couldn’t be hearing this from him, not now. He had been so sure of himself yesterday, almost excited at the fact he was getting married, and yet now …
Mary sighed again, a frown gracing her forehead. “I know when you’re fibbing, John. I’ve seen you these past few weeks and something’s going on. Be honest.” Mary paused for a beat. “Are you … are you having second thoughts? About us?”
She glanced back at John, raising an eyebrow at him and, as if she were reading his mind, she blurted out: “Jesus, you’re getting old. You look like shit, mate.”
"You're talking about Sherlock, aren't you?" John asked, turning back so Harriet could finish up with his hair.
“Just …” John waved his hand in a nonchalant fashion, attempting to play off his dark mood. “… stuff at home. I’m fine.”
“What, so you’re just going to keep this from her then? You’re just going to marry her and never tell her about your affair or the fact that you’re in love with someone else?”
“Not at all - go right ahead.” Sherlock answered as he gestured towards the bathroom. John flashed a quick halfhearted smile at Sherlock before he turned and walked towards the bathroom, leaving Sherlock standing on his own, feeling . . .
Sherlock’s voice rung through the air and John stopped on the outskirts of the garden, just about to enter the carpark, turning to find Sherlock rushing up to him, his cheeks still wet from tears.
John watched as Sherlock focused intently on his trousers, smoothing the fabric out, a frown knitting across his brow. It was only when the small crease on the bridge of Sherlock’s nose appeared as he looked up at John, his curls swaying delicately in the cool breeze into his eyes that John couldn’t help himself and he reached out and brushed the soft hair away from Sherlock’s eyes. The motion was so tender and Sherlock seemed to crumble underneath his feather light touch.
Except then he heard his sister’s voice, breaking through his reverie, and her hand was on his shoulder, leading him to a seat out the front of the building, forcing him to sit.
why is this coat still in the way?!” John demanded, mirth in his voice as he fumbled with the many buttons on Sherlock’s heavy coat.
John looked up at Mary and found her smirking into her cup of tea before she sat it down on the counter and spat out “
yell at me, Mary,” John spoke low, warning her that he was ready to argue if she really wanted to start something.
“I guess … when I see her tonight?” John didn’t really believe the words coming out of his mouth and he was afraid now that he had said them to someone else, they were now set in stone. It was all so much so soon.
The eyeballs in the fridge are starting to smell like proper death. John always groans when he opens the fridge. But John does groans at almost everything in their flat so maybe it's not that bad. They're sitting on their chairs. At least they were until John decided it was time for a snack. "Snack" as in "I didn't eat at Sarah's and i am quite hungry because God knows what we did".
John talking, or real life John talking. He doesn't know if his Mind Palace is failing him again, he can't see the bricks landing and turning into dust and walls crumbling down but
«What is this even about, Sherlock?» Anger. Eyes open, pupils alert. Brows furrowed, lips tight. Shoulders tense. Fists tight. Definitely anger.
«I don't know! I don't know, Sherlock! But you don't exactly look healthy, do you now?» you don't even look alive. He doesn't say that.
«Do you think you're going to ask me questions or may I consider myself free?» his voice is only slightly annoyed, just the right bit of annoyance he used to put to piss off John.
«So you're telling me I need to accept that my bestfriend has been tortured and will suffer from PTSD while I am still recovering from my own trauma and I'll have to be here babysitting him as my soon to be wife and mother of my chil-»
But now there is no Mycroft holding him still. Just his own teeth biting his tongue and drawing blood, fists hitting hit head repeatedly. He is so stupid!
What are they talking about? Why are they even talking? Does he look sad? He tries to smile convincingly at them.
John is looking at him, deep deep blue eyes burning in Sherlock's scalp and taking in the sudden change of mood. The detective looks younger, childish smile playing on his lips and fingers moving swiftly in the air, low and quietly as if Sherlock is trying to hide it, tapping one the invisible keys of a piano.
«Well, yeah. But sorry won't make things right.» the doctor rubs his forehead, fingers pinch the bridge of his nose. He looks so tired. «I know you are sorry. But why on earth- » small crack in his voice, steadiness falters and fails «-why did you not tell me, or anyone really, about this. What's happening, Sherlock?»
Water closed. He slips in the bathtub, under the water, lower part of his face under the surface. Deep water. Deep deep water.
Case after case, it became more evident. But John's movements were still gravitating around the detective's. If Sherlock moved on the left, John would too, but few metres behind the younger man's back. He could not stand being beside him, a gloomy pressure crushing his lungs everytime those eyes lended on him for a fraction of a second. And it's not like Sherlock was proposefully avoiding John, he's not been pushing him away by pulling his strings as he used to. But the looks and gazes lasted less and less every time, a quick apologetic smile as soon as the cold eyes left the doctor's face.
John's gaze meets Mycroft's, understanding speaking for them both. Mrs Hudson is barely containing her tears.
and that's when John's inner bell starts ringing. Sherlock can sense it in the air, the short and sudden intake of air the doctor forces through his lips and into his lungs. It stays there few seconds and then comes out of his nose with frutration.
to hear John, always. Because when John is not with him on a case, or simply out with the woman, Sherlock can hear his voice in his head forming thoughts and formulating ideas.
«I have no idea what you're talking about. Are you all going nuts?» he starts walking again, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot.
Every step he takes towards the men is reminding him how consumed his body is, how proved and stitched up and bruised it is. The cracks in his ribs, the infection eating his flesh of his shoulder, his over worked brain asking for
Eyes fixed on the cuffs of his shirt, studying the simple path of the cotton thread drawing the delicate seams. Alert.
Greg gives him a weird look, then eyes the corpse. «Alright. But where's John? How can you say it was intentional poisoning? How can you even tell he was allergic?! For God's sake Sherlock you can't just- where is John? We need his medical opinion.»
John is lying on his forearms, elbows steady on the desk. Sherlock can feel his stare burning holes in his scalp.
he's afraid of the answer. He feels anxiety crawling under his skin like cockroaches in a decaying corpse, his head feels light.
«What? We just finished, can't you live another day without me?» if he rolls his eyes, it might look like he's not actually
7:32AM. Eyes open. Mind alert. Movements. Noises from the door. Keys fumbling with the lock. Uneasy steps. A pause mid-stairs. A groan. John?
«John, I need you to understand that I don't need any kind of romantic entanglement and as I have already told you once, I consider myself married to my work and I can't let distractions to interfere with my thought process.» he was clear, right? This should do.
Lestrade looks at him with pity. «Look i know, okay? I know you have move out and you're about to get married and Mary and the surgery and everything but please? Will you just-» his hands flutters in the air, theatrical gesture completing the phrase.
When Sherlock came back after his fake suicide, after John finally let got the memory of his fake funeral and a fake coffin with a fake body in it and a fake tombstone which he visited every day for a year, John had not been happy to see him. He wasn't prepared, he spent a year and half worth of therapy sessions trying to say Sherlock's name out loud without his voice sounding strangled and broken and dead. He was prepared to propose to Mary. He was prepared to start a new life with her, to attend surgery every day of the week to bring home money and pay his rent and
«You have to promise you won't take anything from now on.» John's up again, wandering around the flat with the trash bin under his arm, quick hand throwing away needles and ashtrays from every surface. «You have to promise me, Sherlock. Because I can't be here twenty four hours a day to babysit you. Plus, you hate it when I babysit you.» It should sound like humor, but it stings his eardrums.
«You should slow down, you'll get bloated if you keep eating like that!» she tried to joke. She really tried to get to him.
The doctor's brows are raised, bottom lip sucked in, eyes trying to translate the detective's actions whose feet are already walking away into his bedroom. The door shuts loudly, Mrs Hudson calls out from the lower floor. The building is old, she says.
Everyone knows and seems to be keen to never let go the opportunity to remind him how NOT clever he is, but he notices.
What is that room about? He feels something in the pit of his stomach but can't rationalise it. Is he hungry? He probably is since he didn't touch solid food for more than a day but that's not it.
«Deduce it, doctor. Do i look fine?» he looks annoyed yet less dead, but the mood swings are disorienting John, and
John thinks Mycroft was okay with the whole plan? Of course he does. He doesn't know what they were playing with, he doesn't know what Moriarty's plan was.
John has always been used to be quiet around the him, but after his return it was more of a coping mechanism than a courtesy. Yes, he was happy Sherlock was back and not dead. But the anger and sadness won't leave.
John's voice is so little, so broken. No Captain Watson voice, no Doctor Watson imposing his knowledge over him. Just John. The same little voice that told him to hush and be quiet and listed him all the stitches he would have needed if he ever got out of that cellar. «If I wanted to stop, I very easily could.»
When he went to bed that night and he looked at her, his chest collapsed under the weight of guilt. Because he could stand Sherlock being dead, he was about to get on with his own life to move on. He could live knowing he was dead. But he couldn't possibily bear the existance of Sherlock without it gravitating around him.
Mycroft hand slips behind Sherlock's back, careful and slow. He tries to pry open the hand still clinging to the curly hair and brings their interwined hands in Sherlock's lap and then slides behind the younger man.
«Sherlock, Sherlock wake up.» as soon as John's hands touch the younger man, he starts screaming again, fresh tears sliding down his cheeks.
it happened. He can't see the exact moment when it started. But then he started noticing, small little things that got his mind back to him over and over and over and John, John, John John
Not dark blood, which reassures him, but still blood. It could be the result of the constant puking messing up with the gastro-espohageal tract. It could be ulcers, it could be anything. He sees his medical degree rip apart in fron of his eyes. Panic.
Maybe because Scotland Yard is running after him. Trotting after him, to be fair. Trotting like a puppy around his owner.
. Tea has gone cold in Sherlock's mug, Mycroft has given up the staring contest as his brother refuses to look up at him. Sherlock is studying the wooden table's pattern, pupils running between dark spots and lighter lines.
«Check her hands and bag, husband was allergic to something, she puts it in his saop. Separate soaps, really? And separate beds too, according to the king sized bed. Only one side looks freshly done, the other one wasn't slept on. Look at his left hand, the ring is not even o the tan line of his ring finger. An hot shower would have floated his hands, the ring couldn't have slipped from its place. He took it off, didn't mean to spend the night out and was in hurry to go back home before the poor wife debunked the affair. He was sleeping in another woman's bedroom. Wife discovered, went out to buy what she used to trigger the anaphylactic shock, waited in her car for him to arrive home. Is that what couples do? Love must be so boring.» boring boring boring «I have to go.»
In years of sharing a flat, as well as his whole life, with the man, John's sleep has been disturbed many times by loud noises, explosions and shouts.
Little catch up of life just after Sherlock returned from the dead and how everything drifted apart.
the rambling goes on for a bit. The speaker are muffled by a thick layer of a gooey matter, fog that lays and melt on the walls and lights and windows and
Hickeys? Why would she ever do that. Why do people do that. Why would anyone do that do John anyway.
«Please, you need to look at him John!» the old woman looks miserable. «Please! You were his only friend, he doesn't want anyone near him!» she's obviously figthing tears now.
I've struggled a whole lot with this chapter and it still doesn't sound entirely right to me. I still hope you will enjoy it and I ask all of you to please please please leave me a comment to let me know IF and WHAT went wrong in this chapter. If you're not registered, this is my personal mail and I encourage you to send me an e-mail. Thank you!
«Have you seen him, honestly? Does he look like his normal self, John?» she shakes her head with sadness, wipes her eyes with the back of her aging hands. «He's so lost, I don't know what to do.»
«I WAS ALMOST THERE!» his own voice echoes in his head. John is looking at him, hands raised. He looks scared. Did he scare John?
His friend is curled up on himself, whole body moving back and forth repeatedly. It feels surreal. There are nails scratches on the headboard.
Slow minutes go by as they all stay still, all except for Sherlock whose trashing is coming to an end.
«Sherlock, it's a nightmare! I am here, it's all fine!» tentative touches try to get a firm hold of those pale hands, he tries and tries to make him stop. «Sherlock, you are safe! You're home!» he holds him by the wrists, arms stretched in front of his trashing body.
«I did. I did want to die. Put a gun in my mouth. Thought i would be brave enough. Guess I am not.» he smiles at the floor, sniffles again. This is his defense mode, short answers, brick wall between them. A barricade. A trench. He's hurting.
because he overdosed on street drugs.» John hates how polite his voice is despite the things it just described.
«Nope, working.» tap the cases, pretend to work. Pretend to work so they leave you alone, it always worked with his family. He'd pretend he was doing homeworks for
So i can eat too because you always remind me to eat or otherwise i would go days without eating a single crumb of bread. He doesn't say it.
Is John leaving? Why is John drinking again? Why Mary? Why him? What is happening? Why is it happening?
His nose fills up with dust at every intake of air, he can feel the weeks of closed windows compromising his flesh and lungs and blood and he feels so dirty inside
«John.» His eyes are taking in every bit of John's face, pupils darting left and right and up and down and
The detective's words are calm and light and John's face goes red with shame. Then the colour washes away, capillaries drained out and blood flowing back to the growing abashment knot in his stomach.
It felt like home in a dark, smelly, dirty and bloody alley. And he was so angry with himself for putting himself in this situation and with Sherlock because
It feels like being forced awake for seven days, chained by his wrist and pushed into insanity. It feels like razors on his tongue, between his toes. Like knives on his chest and arms, like hard leather on his back. Blood on his urine-soaked clothes.
That's what he noticed. The way his brain seems to fill up with fog and bags under blue eyes and deep blue deep blue
«He said you couldn't possibily have a crush on her.» careful, careful words. So gentle, his John. «Because you are not interested in her. Or in Molly. Or Sally. Or any other woman on the planet.»
The waiter arrived at their table, carrying two takeaway cappuccinos. He glanced at the pair holding hands and smiled sympathetically, before setting their drinks down on the table and moving away to continue waiting tables.
Once he was finished, he moved silently back into the bedroom and his eyes fell on Sherlock’s long feet poking out the end of the bed. He remembered the moment weeks ago, when he had removed Sherlock’s shoes, and the feeling he had felt when he imagined kissing them, loving them for their perfection and beauty. Unable to help himself, John perched himself at the end of the bed and slowly started to place soft, gentle kisses on the arch of Sherlock’s left foot, his hand massaging the other. He kissed along the arch, moving up so he could place singular, loving kisses on each perfect toe, and then moved up to Sherlock’s ankle. By this stage, Sherlock was stirring, a sleepy moan escaping his throat. John continued, his hands holding the blanket up so he could slowly make his way underneath, continuing his kisses up his legs, until he reach Sherlock’s exposed shaft, which was already somewhat erect.
Mary eyes narrowed playfully and she leapt from her seat, grabbing onto John’s hand, pulling her up with him. “Come on, Mr. Watson. You’re going to dance with your wife to be.”
“Do you need me to call anyone, love?” her heavily lined face peered into John’s and through his tears he saw her pity.
John nodded and handed over his cash to the woman. He took his programme from her and threw her a distracted word of thanks, his eyes moving onto the crowd around him, noticing the multiple performers mingling in the throng before the show started. John immediately felt anxiety bubble in his chest – he was worried Sherlock would also be out in the crowd before he went on stage. He hadn’t expected dancers to be out before the show, but then again, he had never been to a show like this, so he didn’t really know what he was expecting in the first place. All he knew was he didn’t want to bump into Sherlock right now and have him find out he was here – his plan was to slip in, watch Sherlock, and leave.
Turning, John saw Mary's maid of honor making her way towards him in her pastel pink bridesmaid dress, her face breaking into a bright smile. She hugged him tightly, placing a kiss on his cheek.
