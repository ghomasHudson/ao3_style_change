The boy sighed, and there was frustration in his voice when he next spoke.
“Sometimes your brother forgets he can be very little for as long as he’d like.  When that happens, he finds a new way to get attention that makes him feel more comfortable,” he said.
“I gotta be spanked?” he asked, voice pitifully small.
"Do you think you can support Bunny when she's feeling like a girl?" he asked.
Now, however, Bunny glanced up to see Sherlock huff a sigh and hunch himself lower into the kitchen chair.
Sherlock sighed and sat up to peer over the far side of the bed, coughing as he glared down towards Bunny.
Sherlock glared at Mycroft and stormed out of his bedroom with the towel clutched in his hand.  Mycroft heard the man stomp down the hallway and then listened as the bathroom door was closed and the shower turned on.  He shifted his attention to John, who seemed to have fallen back to sleep.  The man looked so innocent and calm while sleeping that Mycroft was unsure of John’s current headspace.
Greg swore he’d be good, and if Mycroft managed a few
“That’s it,” Sherlock said.  John supported himself by placing his hands on the mattress on either side of Sherlock’s shoulders.  He could feel his boyfriend circling the pad of one thumb against his arm in comfort, and gasped when he felt another other hand reach to cup John’s groin.  “Good job, sweet boy.”
Mycroft smirked but began switching out the band aids John had used from his medical kit for both blue and orange fish band-aids and yellow and green puppy band-aids.  The man placed them in even numbers, the way Sherlock preferred, and Sherlock kicked himself for feeling comforted by how much Mycroft understood him.  Now wasn’t the time to take comfort in his brother’s quiet efficiency.  Mycroft had lied to him, or at least kept information from him.  He’d chosen John, and if Sherlock needed to learn how to get along without Mycroft, he needed to stop looking for his brother’s care.
Mycroft seemed a bit surprised, but recovered quickly.
“No,” John said, shifting his arm before Greg could resume his hold on him.  “You stay here and socialize.  I’ll be alright.”
“You're a very smart boy, kid,” Greg said, glancing towards a surprised Mycroft and a now bashful little Bunny. Mycroft could see that Greg knew he needed to give Mycroft some semblance of privacy with Bunny, even if there was no way he could leave them alone at the table.  “But even smart boys have to eat their salad if they want popcorn and dessert during movie night,” Greg said.
“I’m scared,” he said, “I don’t like it in that room alone.  Can I sleep in here?”
Sherlock guessed a monster probably wouldn't know that about him unless he could read minds, and there probably weren't too many monsters who were that advanced.  He shuffled closer to the closet door and slid it back a few inches, peeking out at Uncle Greg.
“Now, do you want to tell us what this is really about, lovebug?” Mycroft prompted as Uncle Greg took a step back.
Sherlock whined when the first spank hit, but he was rather eager to be put in his place.  He didn’t want to regulate his emotions any longer, didn’t want to keep navigating an in-between headspace.
Mycroft crossed the room to pull down the window shades, blocking the midday light despite the fact that, soon, dark clouds from the anticipated thunderstorms would block the sunlight.  John had managed to stay young while Mycroft went through the naptime routines they fell into whenever Mycroft deemed the man in need of an afternoon rest--trip to the bathroom to pee, into his bedroom where he was helped out of his trousers because John preferred sleeping in just his underwear, blankets and stuffed animals gathered, pacifier placed on the nightstand beside a glass of water--but as Mycroft smoothed his blankets and bent to kiss him on the forehead, Bunny could feel himself struggling to stay young.
Mycroft poured the pasta into the now boiling water.
Mycroft kissed the boy on the top of his head.  He vowed to remember that, although Sherlock and Greg had grown close, the boy was still dependent on big brother.  He needed to do a better job of assessing the boy’s moods and anticipating his needs, even in the middle of the night after one of John’s nightmares.
“Sherlock?”
“I’m not a little boy right now, Mycroft, although no one seems to have noticed.  I’m probably seventeen at the youngest.”
But as Sherlock slipped into a booth and John ordered them each a pint, he could sense there was a hesitancy to the night and to Sherlock.  John suspected their inability to come upon a mutual topic of conversation had less to do with the triple homicide and more to do with the events of the past weekend.
Greg laughed, but did not object, nodding as he pushed in his chair at the table.  He was exhausted and more than ready for bed.
“I see,” Greg said.  “A big boy who can dress himself.  Well done, lad.”
It was why, when he felt a stab of need, he released his heavy bladder into the pull-up Papa had dressed him in the night before without much hesitancy at all, releasing his urine into the padding.  The warmth spread beneath and behind him, and although Sherlock still felt overheated, the warmth in the pull-up was a welcome comfort.  He sighed, moaning a bit before he realized just how content the action had made him, just how much he had needed to go, and just how young he had become in the past few minutes.
At long last, they were tired out, and lay against each other with hitching breaths.  Th thunderstorm had begun to decrease in intensity around them.  Sherlock knocked his shoulder against John’s with what John knew passed for affection in Sherlock’s book.
Sherlock emerged from the loo with a newfound energy, and he leapt into his place at the table, growling like a dinosaur as he clutched his stuffed toy under his arm.  Mycroft and John shared a look of amusement before the three men settled down to tuck into their waiting lunch.
“I didn’t go all the way.” John could hear the smile in the admission; Sherlock was clearly enjoying the fact that he’d been caught.  “I only let out enough to let him think I’d gone.”
I apologize for the lack of little Sherlock and little John in this chapter--it's really just a resolution to Mycroft's angst.  I'm thinking of starting a one-shot collection since I'm not sure I can commit to another multi-chaptered story at the moment (and I still have to complete A Little Training, eventually), so that will give you all lots of opportunities to see some age regression with Sherlock and John.
“Did Uncle Greg feed you boys lunch?”
John felt more comfort in Greg’s endearing ‘kiddo’ than he had all day; he had to steel himself against the wave of vulnerability that attempted to wash over him.  He had already made Greg come all this way; he didn’t need to make him care for him in littlespace on top of it all.  Besides, if they were heading back to Greg’s family, John could not afford to let himself get small.
“I might need to be punished,” he said, and this time a grinning Sherlock initiated the kissing.
In an inability to find his own coat in the overstuffed closet, John yanked on Greg’s.  It was warmer than his own, and he was tired of the cold; he’d been frigid all day, even feeling a chill while pressing through the warm mass of bodies scattered throughout Greg’s parent’s house.
John nodded.
Mycroft clucked his tongue.  “Come, now, Lock.  You need to eat something.”
He sank onto the end of the bed, head in hands.  The nightmare had jolted him into his hyper-aware adult self, but the smaller side of his mind was not far off, and his smaller side was desperate for Papa.
Sherlock began to speak up, moved to push the plush toy off of the couch, but Mycroft spoke first.
Once they’d entered their flat, Sherlock turned to do up the deadbolt on their front door.  John raised his eyebrows, and Sherlock actually smirked.
John bit his tongue against cursing at Greg for talking to him as if he were a child.
“What makes you think you were bad, kid?”
John turned over towards Greg and blinked awake.  He looked sleepy and content, and tried to crawl closer to snuggle up to the man.
"Thank you, sweet boy," Mycroft said.
“Yes, baby?” Greg asked.  He had to admit he found it adorable when the boy was on the younger side of his headspace, even sweeter and more compliant than usual.
And then Bunny was feeling less like Bunny and more like John, suddenly fiercely protective of his boyfriend and desperate to assure the younger version of Sherlock that he understood how hard it could be to process while in headspace.  Hell, it was hard enough to process emotion as an adult, let alone while in the mindset of a child.
Sherlock leaned in and kissed him, hard and without warning, to wipe the goofy grin off of his face.  John smiled, too, opening his mouth to breathe a laugh and returning the favor as he took Sherlock’s lower lip into his mouth for a moment before reaching to intertwine his fingers through the mussed curls at the back of Sherlock’s head and snogging him in return, pulling him close once more.  He guided Sherlock’s hand down beneath the sheets until it was back in place, cupped around his groin.
“My little brother seems to have tired you out, Dr. Watson,” Mycroft said when John all but collapsed into the kitchen chair.
“Mycroft?” It was Sherlock, tugging on Mycroft’s shirt with a whine.  “I’m hungry.”
“Love you, too, My,” Sherlock said, leaning forward until his forehead was once again resting on Mycroft’s chest.  “Love you always, too.”
“I’ve got him,” he said, seeming to jump immediately into problem-solving mode.
“It’s okay, I promise I’m not mad,” Greg said, knowing there was a real chance Sherlock would hang up were he to feel uncomfortable talking.  “Where’s Mycroft, sweetheart?”
“You did nothing wrong yesterday,” Greg said, voice soft but assured as he placed a hand on the kid’s knee.  “There’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
“It’s been a long day, is all,” he said, unsuccessfully attempting to keep his tone off-handed and cavalier.
Mycroft was at Baker Street within fifteen minutes, stepping up the stairs and into the flat without knocking.  Sherlock was at the kitchen table, sitting over a cup of tea and, Mycroft assumed, sorting the details of the most recently solved case into his Mind Palace.
John sent a half-hearted glare Sherlock's way and dodged the unused pull-up when he tossed it towards him. Sherlock ignored John's eye roll and simply smiled cheekily as he stepped around John to leave the room.
“Good as new,” Greg said after tossing the pillows back into position at the head of the bed.  “Need some help getting dressed?”
“He’s about to piss himself,” he said, turning back to face front, and John immediately swore, telling Sherlock to fuck the hell off.  He was not in the mood to deal with Sherlock’s antics, and his anger came fast and harsh.
“I’m sorry for being a bad boy tonight, Uncle Greg,” John said as Greg turned out the lights.
“No,” Sherlock said.
Bunny mumbled that Sherlock didn’t want him sleeping with him and blinked back tears as he scrambled out from beneath the bed to press himself into his Daddy’s arms.
Here were Sherlock's real concerns on display, the thoughts and worries he'd been fighting against all day.  When Sherlock reached to wipe the tears from his face, puzzle pieces were stuck to his palms.
“I know, love,” Greg said, knowing the most important thing was to ensure the boy was not embarrassed about asking for what he needed.  “But we’ll get you home and into the tub and you’ll feel good as new.”
If Mycroft thought the drama of the evening had ended once the boys had fallen back to sleep, he had vastly underestimated the troublesome nature of his kiddos and the impact their stressful day had placed upon them.  It was half two when he was awakened by a sniffling Sherlock climbing into John's bed beside him.
“Fuck, I’m going to do it,” John said, tensing his thighs around Sherlock’s in an effort to keep control.  “I can’t...ah…”
“—and fire fighters,” Bunny added.
John was grateful she left the door propped open to let in some of the light from the hallway.  His heart was beating wildly, confused and concerned and afraid over letting himself slip towards Bunny in the presence of a stranger.  He pulled the plush dog close, hugging it to his chest and desperately grateful for its presence, and gave in at long last to the tears that had been threatening to fall all day, which he tried to stifle by slipping his thumb into his mouth.
Greg sighed but stepped into the bathroom and turned on the faucet in the bathtub.  He would need a few moments to get Sherlock’s sheets changed and to find some clean pajamas for the boy; it wouldn’t be the worst idea to have Sherlock occupied while he got things settled.  Besides, he was a kid once, too, and he remembered how uncomfortable and disconcerting it could be to wake up in a wet bed, not to mention feeling sick.  If Sherlock was allowing himself the outlet of emotion, Greg needed to listen to what the boy most needed.
“You’re mine,” Sherlock said, voice little more than a mumbled whisper.  He knew it wasn’t the right thing to say, that Mycroft didn’t like when he was selfish.  He was supposed to share with Bunny, even when it was hard.  But it was all he could do to keep from crying.
Thank you all for your kind words on the last chapter, lovelies!  It's been a tough few days for me, but I'm hoping I'm out of the woods and that things will start to look up soon.  If you're in a similar state, know I'm sending you love and encouragement--we got this :)
“Okay!” Sherlock said, jumping down and grabbing Uncle Greg by the hand to pull him down the hallway.  Greg glanced back at Mycroft with a look of amusement, and Mycroft could not help but laugh.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft called in a warning as he stood from his spot next to Papa at the kitchen table, who had chimed in with his own disappointed, “not okay, kid.”
“Oh, lovebug,” he said, pulling John, still wrapped up in the blankets and sheets, into a hug.  “Uncle Greg didn’t buy diapers for you.  He bought them for Sherlock.”
, Mycroft told him.
“Too little,” he whined, feeling particularly young and afraid.  “Too scary.”
Nothing was going well.  He was sick and tired and didn’t want to be alone but Sherlock was mean.  He had left his blanket on top of the mattress and he wanted to go climb into bed with his Daddy and Papa.  But his head ached and his throat burned, and he was worried Sherlock would pinch him again if he climbed out from underneath the bed.
“Goodnight, My,” he said.
Bunny nodded.
“Feel better, little string bean,” he whispered as he pulled the boy’s bedroom door nearly all the way closed.  “Call for me if you need anything.”
Bunny could tell that his Daddy didn’t like his new pull-ups as much as he did, or even as much as Uncle Greg did, who’d commented on how sweet he looked when he offered to change him into one before lunch.  His Daddy had tried to look pleased when Bunny showed him the new pull-ups, but he’d straightened the cuffs of his sleeves and only hummed in response, and Bunny had become self-conscious, and quickly stepped into and pulled on his sweatpants.
Mycroft raised his chin and peered down at him as if they were strangers.  He was withdrawn and short in a way he had not behaved towards Greg since their earliest interactions.  Sherlock would always come first; Greg had long since learned that.  But Mycroft truly seemed to believe that allowing himself to acknowledge any sentiment surrounding his relationship with Greg in times of crisis would cloud his instinctive judgment, and that, to Greg, was disappointing.
There was a sudden fear but a welcome, blissfully quick shift into his smaller headspace, urine streaming fast and strong into and through his pants.
“He’s not doing well,” John said, needing to process his concern for his boyfriend, imagining him fitfully tossing and turning in the room across the hall.
Sherlock, although sniffling and whimpering a bit, did not argue or complain; he simply allowed Greg to guide him into the bathtub and obeyed when Greg held a tissue to his nose and asked him to blow.
Sherlock rubbed his nose on his sleeve and turned towards his Uncle.  He was clutching the new plush alligator in his arms and sucking his thumb, begging for Mycroft to chastise him because both he and John knew very well that there were no toys allowed during time out and that, by Sherlock’s own rule, he was not allowed to suck his thumb like John was.  Mycroft shuddered to think when the boy’s hands had last been washed.
“That level of loss sticks with you,” Greg continued, recalling cases steeped in sorrow that he’d covered throughout his career.  “He’ll realize there’s more to his remembered pain than a lost pet.”
Hi, all!
Here is the as-promised beginning of little John and first appearance of Lestrade.  A bit of wetting (as always) and general Sherlock brattiness are thrown in for good measure!
“Right!” Bunny called.
“You tell Sherlock he isn't supposed to have accidents,” John whispered.
Read the new ficlet for this series, "Birthday Blues," on my tumblr,
“Who played pirates, love?” John asked.
“And?” Mycroft prompted.
“Good boy,” John repeated again and again as he worked.  “You’re doing very well.”
“Yummy,” Sherlock said, his arm held straight out, as if he were trying to feed Mycroft off his little spoon with the plastic pirate handle.
Bunny nodded, still sniffling from the recent tears, thumb planted in mouth.  Greg carried the little one upstairs and into Bunny’s woodland creatures bedroom, where he sat in the rocking chair and situated the kiddo onto his lap so that Bunny could lay against his chest as they rocked back and forth.
John took a seat in his chair in order to watch over Sherlock as he worked at his feel.  The man enjoyed the keen attention of an audience; it had been, roughly speaking, John's initial purpose.
They had been drinking whiskey after putting the boys to sleep, processing the events of the day and planning for the next.  Mycroft’s exhaustion from his lack of sleep the night before as well as the alcohol had made him a bit cheeky, which had led him to tease Greg good-naturedly when Greg admitted he had suffered his own bedwetting problems as a child.  Eventually, however, Greg had gotten Mycroft to focus back on the topic of conversation at hand.
“I can’t tell you, Daddy,” he cried, slipping his thumb into his mouth.
Sending you all love and bunny kisses!
.  They were thoughts only just re-emerging, thoughts from when he was a kid,  wondering what he’d done all those years ago to make his father run away from him and Harry and their mum.  He should have played more sports, like his father had wanted him to.  He shouldn't have argued with him so much.  He should have kept his room cleaner.
His Daddy sighed, but Bunny gave him his most pitiful, pleading look.
The kid glanced up at him after rubbing at his eyes again.  Greg guided his thumb away from his mouth, where it was once again hovering, by taking John's hand in his own.
Sherlock squirmed a bit under the intensity of John’s focus, but he made eye contact before nodding.
“Sherlock Holmes, are you purposefully trying my patience today?” he asked, tone veering towards anger.  “Don’t think I’m above putting you over my knee on the side of the road.  You’re clearly in need of some discipline.”
Mycroft waited until he’d finished wiping his brother down with baby wipes to answer, taking the time to gather his thoughts.  He had been anticipating this conversation with Sherlock since Bunny had chosen to express himself as female.  And, although he hadn’t expected it would happen in the midst of a middle-of-the-night diaper change, he knew it was a conversation he could not shy away from.
Mycroft glanced down the hallway towards the bathroom, and Greg knew what he would say next.
Greg snorted and, after wiping his soapy hands on a dishcloth, pulled Mycroft to him and kissed him.
Greg had already sensed that the kid had had a bit of an accident.  His pajama trousers were dark, but the way the kid was holding himself and the fact that he’d woken from sleep and had come searching for help had clued Greg in to the potential problem.
But Sherlock’s breath hitched, and Mycroft knew he was trying to hold back tears.
Sherlock pulled his head from Mycroft’s shoulder and blinked up at him before realizing they were at the window.  He shifted his gaze to glance down toward the street.  It was a tactic Mycroft had used when they were younger, distracting Sherlock from what had upset him by giving him the challenge of observation.
He suddenly remembered an afternoon in the backyard, playing with Harry.  He had been young, maybe five or six, and they had been racing around playing superheroes, towels tied around their necks.  It had been John who had ended the game, because he had suddenly bent over and began peeing into his pants, unable to stop once it started and red-cheeked with more than just exertion.  He hadn’t even known he’d had to go, but suddenly the evidence was all over his trousers and down his legs, and Harry had been staring wide-eyed, one hand between her own legs almost as if she were sympathizing with him.  He had been embarrassed to the point of tears when he approached his mother to tell her what had happened, unable to say anything and flushing red when Harry explained to her that he’d “gone potty.”  And although he was not punished for wetting himself, the incident had shaken him up for weeks, had made him an even more cautious child.
Mycroft was calling from the other side of the door.  Sherlock could not help but bite back a sob.  He couldn’t ask Mycroft to help him, no matter how much he wanted it.  Mycroft would see the pull-up if he helped him untie his pants; Mycroft would know Sherlock had been bad.
“You can go play, now, Sherlock,” Daddy said, “Thank you for being patient.”
Sherlock sat rocking back and forth on the creaking mattress of the lake house bedroom.  He knew he should get up to use the loo.  After all, he had woken up in time.  He could hold it long enough to make it to the bathroom without an accident.
Sherlock did not respond.  He was content to rest on his brother’s lap with his eyes closed, cuddling his stuffed animals and sucking his pirate pacifier.
Sherlock’s breath caught on a wail, and then his crying lessened in volume, and he turned over his shoulder to watch Mycroft pour juice into a blue and green dinosaur sippy cup.
As he’d jerkily stuffed fistfulls of torn cardstock back into the envelope in which the dolls were stored, he crossed his fingers and prayed that Bunny wouldn’t want to play with his paper dolls that day.  He tried to convince himself that it served Bunny right, that now Mycroft and Papa would really have a reason to give Bunny so much coddling attention and to buy him new toys at the store.  But a sinking emptiness driven by more than his refusal to eat breakfast made his stomach ache, and he hadn’t been able to look Bunny in the eye when the kid had come into the living room to play.
And after a morning of darkness and uncertainty, Sherlock spent the afternoon on his hands and knees in the multi-roomed blanket fort Mycroft had built on the backs of couches and kitchen chairs.  He sat in Uncle Greg’s lap and listened to his new book being read aloud, played dinosaurs with Mycroft and then paper dolls with Bunny, and had even managed to get away from Mycroft during a diaper change, and he’d laughed and laughed, naked from the waist down, as his brother was forced to chase him through the house.  It had only been moments before Mycroft had realized his best course of action was to stay still and wait for Sherlock to tire of the game, but Sherlock was pleased he’d managed to get his brother to chase him at all, and that he’d gotten him to laugh in the process.
Mycroft cleared his throat and turned his attention back to John, placing aside the grim images of Eurus locked in her sparse cell at Sherringford.
“I know you need time.  You can take all of it that you need.  But it doesn’t have to be this way.  Let me help you with this.”
“Is there anything you want to talk about, kiddo?” Papa asked, and this time his voice was quiet but close.
John paused and turned around to find Sherlock looking smug.
“Greggy boy!” the first smirked, clapping Greg on the back.
The line was cut off before Greg could say anything else, and Sherlock’s phone went to voicemail when Greg hurriedly called back.  Swearing under his breath and advising himself against expecting the worst and working himself up, Greg pulled back onto the road and began to make his way back into the city, pushing speed limits.  He called Mycroft’s phone on the way, but the man immediately sent him to voicemail, clearly unaware of the current state of Sherlock and increasing Greg's unsease.
“John, I’m going to make coffee,” he said.  “Come on down when you’re ready.”
“I want you to read me my story,” Sherlock said, suddenly sullen and upset.
Don't forget to check out my Tumblr for oneshots linked to this series (or to click a certain button to share a cup of coffee if you're feeling generous ;p),
“Will you be okay for a few minutes while Papa goes to take care of your bed?” he asked.
“Hey, love,” John said, heart wrenching as he took in the state of the boy: hair mussed and eyes red-rimmed from crying.  “Is it alright if I talk to you for a minute?”
John sighed and handed the stuffed dinosaur over to Mycroft.  “I’d like both you and Sherlock to stay,” he said.  “I’ll just finish the washing up and then I’ll join you in Sherlock’s room.”
He had never meant to take Mycroft away from Sherlock, something he knew Sherlock must have accused him of in his angry inner-rants up in the bedroom that morning.  John had simply grown accustomed to Mycroft’s care, desperate for it as a means of emotional comfort.  But he hadn’t been thinking of the impact John’s own need would have on Sherlock, and now that he had seen the tangible evidence of his betrayal, he felt nothing but a deep, sticky guilt.
John turned to leave, then paused.
“Is it sexual?”
Greg chuckled again, patting the boy’s knee to calm him after reaching across his chest and clicking his seat belt back into place.
John seemed noticeably relieved.
Mycroft nodded and Greg turned to reach a hand to pat Sherlock, who had finally stopped crying long enough to catch on to the fact that they might be able to return someday, on the knee.
Greg pushed his chair back as he stood from the table.
“Yes, poor Sherly looks as if he’s about to drop on his feet,” their mother said, crossing back into the living room as she dried her hands on a dish towel.  She moved to the couch and kissed first Mycroft and then Sherlock--who could not help but try to squirm away from the forced affection at the moment--on the forehead.  “Get on upstairs, both of you.”
“Now, we’ve got more shopping to do, don’t we, princess?” Greg asked.
"Or did his wife and kids a favor," the bald man said, holding up the weathered wedding ring in the evidence bag.
This chapter gave me a bit of trouble, but after the third edit I think I got it to a place that I'm okay posting it.  One of you lovely readers gave me the idea a while back to potentially explore the idea that John's father was not exactly the best influence in his young life, which was interesting to play with here.  Thanks also for those of you who suggested that an argument and/or other commotion may set John sinking into headspace at the crime scene--that was a great help in getting me over a major hurdle of this chapter!
John blinked up at him.  A part of him saw how much easier that would be, how John could go on without needing to change his own day to day routine to meet Sherlock’s needs.   But there was another part of him that longed to know more about the way Mycroft could care for Sherlock, a part that longed to join in what he knew was exactly what his boyfriend needed.
“You’ll be mad,” Bunny said, sniffling as he wiped at teary eyes.  “You won’t like me, anymore.”
Mycroft leaned down to kiss John on the forehead, then walked to the other side of the bed and tried to kiss his brother’s forehead, but Sherlock squirmed away from the kiss, raising his arms up to cover his face.   It was clear Sherlock's patience level and ability to accept comfort had been exhausted for the night, but that was okay.
Mycroft had sent Greg away with thanks and with assurances that he owed him, pleased to be back and eager to ensure that John was feeling okay.  He had clearly been able to see just how much of a toll the case had taken on both John and Sherlock, but on John particularly.  It was why he had told Sherlock to arrange for Greg to be let into the flat at Baker Street when he and John arrived back in London, why he had encouraged Sherlock to send John home even while Sherlock continued to tie up the loose ends of the case.
Sherlock was paused in the doorway, his back to John.  John hadn't realized he was still in the room.
No, he couldn’t be little right now.  Not when he had Sherlock to watch over.  He’d just spent an entire weekend being young.  He could wait a few more days for Mycroft’s care.
And then Bunny was crying, which Greg knew was likely due to the guilt the boy felt over wetting his backseat.  He also knew there was no amount of verbal assurances that would convince Bunny that Greg was not upset, so instead he focused on showing the boy through his gentle actions as he helped him step out of his wet jeans and underwear and began wiping him down with baby wipes.
Bunny gave a last little whine before rolling over to snuggle his stuffed rabbit beneath his neck as he went back to sleep, pacifier bobbing once more.
There was a peaceful silence to the front yard that stood in sharp contrast to the drunken, cheerful revelry occurring inside.  It was still snowing, thick flakes falling heavy around the house.
“Young,” Greg amended.  “Sometimes they feel young.”
“Shush, no need for any of that right now, kiddo,” Greg said as he crouched before the boy and began to pop the button of his jeans.  “Just let Papa take care of you.”
“Are you sure you feel brave enough to go with Uncle Greg and Sherlock today?” Mycroft asked once he had sent Sherlock to use the toilet and was alone with John. He began picking out clothes for John to wear that day.  “We could always go to the park to see the ducks.”
It was a relief that Sherlock seemed to not have placed an identity to the girl he’d remembered.  If Mycroft acted quickly, he may still be able to keep that particular association hidden.  It was time to adopt the most fitting role.
He left Sherlock to play and set about washing the breakfast dishes Greg and John had left in their haste to get to the crime scene, stepping back into the living room every few moments to keep tabs on Sherlock.  He wiped down the counters and the stovetop before moving onto the floors.  It was rare that he had a moment to clean up in the midst of ageplaying; often there was simply not a quiet enough moment to tidy the place to the state Mycroft found most comfortable.
As Mycroft helped John out of his pajama shirt and into a plain t-shirt, he found he did feel actual pride at John’s decision.  Caring for John was an entirely different beast than caring for Sherlock.  It had been a long four months of learning how to adjust his caretaking to meet both Sherlock and John’s needs, and Mycroft was pleased John felt comfortable enough in his headspace to venture into public.  He was a bit concerned that John wanted to take such a large step at a time Mycroft would not be able to be with him, but John had been growing more comfortable with Lestrade each time the man visited while the boys were in headspace.  Besides, John was rather reserved, even in headspace.  It would be unlikely he would speak to anyone besides Lestrade and Sherlock (and more likely he would only speak directly to Sherlock), and unlikely anyone would realize the man was in a younger mindset.
Sherlock often went through the pointless charade of refusal, excusing himself with what even their father could categorize as flimsy excuses and downright lies.  This year had been no different, Sherlock begging off as early as mid-November.
“I should have told you, earlier, buddy,” Mycroft said, leaning close to Sherlock’s ear.
“Something must be really wrong if you’re dismissing capitalism,” Greg said, and Mycroft, with the hint of an exasperated eye roll, smiled.
John smiled at her conspiratorial tone and sat again--albeit a bit sheepishly--as she busied herself by putting away the dishes.  When she’d finished, she turned to him with a smile, but when her cheer shifted into concerned, John knew he must not be doing a particularly good job of hiding his current struggle against sleepiness and sadness.
“I didn’t fucking mean to,” Sherlock argued, but the anger was exhausting to keep up, and his eyes were filling with tears.  “I’m in so much trouble,” he said, voice small when it was too hard to keep up the vexation.
“It’s good that I let Bunny be a mermaid, right, Mycroft?” Sherlock asked.  “I didn’t make him be a pirate when he didn’t want to.”
He burrowed down beneath the comforter on his bed and, at long last, let his thumb slip into his mouth as he curled his legs up towards his chest.  He didn’t have the strength to force himself to be a bigger boy, anymore.  He had disappointed Mycroft and Papa and had hurt Bunny’s feelings probably as much as he had when he’d torn up her paper dolls at the lake house, maybe even more.  He’d never wanted to be mean like that again, had promised himself he wouldn’t hurt like that again.  But now he’d gone and done exactly that, acting without thinking.
“You can talk to me if you need to,” John said, voice quiet and sincere.  “It’s not like I’ve never been there.”
Greg set down his phone with a sigh and glared at the red light.  Maybe he should have followed his first career instinct, after all; he certainly felt as if he were spending his day putting out one fire after another.
“Of course not, bud,” Mycroft said, voice gentle.  “My relationship with you is the most important thing in the world to me.  Always has been.”
But Bunny was beyond being able to keep himself from tears, and he wailed until he grew too tired to do anything but hiccup and sniffle.  His throat felt raw and his eyelashes were stuck together with wetness.
John’s cheeks pinked again, and he let his head fall into his hands once more.
“Don’t call me that!” he said, voice muffled by the couch and his tears.  “I want Papa.”
“I’m down the hall if you need me,” he said, but Sherlock waved him off.
“Aw, none of that, now,” Greg said, stepping forward to heft Sherlock into his arms.
“This is himself,” Greg said.  “John’s spent years in the military.  He’s lived by a very specific code of conduct.  I think headspace gives him a chance to explore a side of himself he was never allowed to previously, to let go of the pressure to be constantly masculine.”
“Want to tell me what happened here?” he asked when his curly-haired brother stood pouting in the doorway of the bathroom.
Greg laughed, downing his wine in a few gulps and reaching for the bottle to refill his glass as well as Mycroft’s.  Mycroft had finished drying the fruit and now began slicing it, teasingly threatening Greg with the knife when the man tried to steal a handful of washed grapes.
So sorry to keep you all waiting, loves!  It's been a busy summer but I'm hoping updates will be a bit more consistent in the near future and as we head into the fall (so ready for cooler weather!).  I'm also hoping to get a few more one-shot ficlets up on tumblr sometime soon, since it seems like people are enjoying them over there, which I'm grateful for!
“You didn’t have to pee your pants to get me to like you again,” Sherlock nearly squealed, body wracked with laughter.
“I won’t pretend I fully understand it,” the taller man said, patting Greg on the back.  “But I’m happy for you, Greggy.”
“I don’t care, I don't care, I don't care!” Bunny yelled defiantly as he, despite his struggling, was put into the back seat and buckled in.  “You’re mean.”
“I’m not,” he said.
Bunny could not help but feel tears building.  He shouldn’t have said anything.  He’d wrecked everything again.
If only Sherlock would agree to a bath himself, Mycroft knew he could have him fully little in no time.  As it was, he simply had to let the boy call the shots.  His hovering was a good sign that he was feeling a bit vulnerable.  Mycroft helped Bunny out of the bathtub and wrapped him in a waiting towel.
By the time he sat watching Sherlock paw through old vests and jackets and hats and gloves, John was as settled into his headspace as he’d ever been, and was feeling at his youngest.  He watched wide-eyed at the treasure trove of costumes emerging from the trunk.  There were ties with geometric patterns and braided belts and dresses with fancy ribbons and gloves with specks of gold thread woven through the fabric.  Bunny reached out and ran his finger along the hem of a flowered dress with a green satin sash.
Bunny nodded, rubbing at tired eyes, and obeyed.  Mycroft watched him make his way towards the bedroom, then gathered the wet clothes from the bathroom to toss into the hamper on his way upstairs.  He found John’s comfort items where they were always tucked away in the man’s closet, then made his way back downstairs to Sherlock’s room.
“I’m not with Sherlock, Mycroft,” he said, still feeling short-tempered and moody.
John pulled out the red tissue paper and reached his hand into the sparkling bag.  He pulled out a soft, fleece baby blanket, cream colored and covered in realistic looking brown rabbits with green eyes.  Ever since Sherlock had given him his new nickname, bunnies had started to become John’s favorite, although he hadn't said anything about it out loud.  He was not surprised to find that Mycroft had picked up on his new obsession.  John rubbed his cheek against the blanket and smiled up at Greg, who had paused to watch the gift opened.
“We’ll be fine,” Greg said, not having the time to convince the worried man any more eloquently.  He stepped into the closet and began sorting through the dress shirts he kept at Mycroft’s.  “I’ll keep an eye on him.  We’ll be home before you know it.”
Mycroft did not speak.  He took a step back and pointed to the floor to signal that he was waiting for Sherlock to remove himself from the closet.  Sherlock scrambled to his feet and clambered, dripping, out of the small space and into the bedroom, where he found Mycroft seated in the desk chair.  He was over his big brother’s knee after little more than a jerk of Mycroft’s arm.
“Better yet, when’s the last time you used the loo?” he asked.
“John is small at the moment,” Papa said, helping Sherlock out of his shirt and only pausing momentarily when the four cuts along Sherlock’s arm were exposed.  “He had a tough time today, too, so he's resting right now.”
John seemed to breathe a bit easier.  His gaze was steady upon Mycroft, almost eager for his words.
Greg knew there was a likelihood that Sherlock would attempt to leave the lake house even without a known destination, however.  The vacation home had become synonymous with their little family lifestyle, something Greg knew Sherlock wanted nothing to do with presently.  And so, ignoring the fact that various parts of his clothing--his waist and thighs from when Sherlock had sat in his lap and his hip from when he had carried Sherlock to the bathroom, and somehow one knee of his pajama pants--were wet with urine, Greg took up his post in the hallway.  If there was even the smallest possibility Sherlock may need something or return to little space and want company or even the slightest chance he might try to escape, Greg needed to be there.
“I apologize it had to be brought to light,” he said, standing from the kitchen table.  “But it couldn’t be helped, unfortunately.”
“What did I do?” he asked, voice loud and defensive.  “I didn’t do anything!”
“It’s alright, sweetheart,” Mycroft soothed.  “You’ve had a hard day.”
“My little brother has always been a far more fragile being than he’s ever cared to admit.”
“Fuck it,” he mumbled to himself, reaching for the comfort of Willa before standing from the bed and crossing to the closed bedroom door.
Mycroft had admitted in the past that he often felt inadequate in the eyes of his parents, misunderstood.  It was a shock to Greg that anyone could find Mycroft Holmes unsuccessful or inadequate in any way, but he had listened carefully, attempting to parse out the truth from Mycroft’s perceptions.
“Okay, baby,” he said, glancing at Bunny.  “Do you want me to take you to the potty?”
“What do you mean?” he asked.  “You’re...you don’t think I’m strange or disgusting?”
“I’m sorry, Papa,” Sherlock said, and although he knew Papa would think he was apologizing for locking the door or for spilling the juice or maybe even for his attitude that morning, he was really apologizing for the fact that he was lying to Papa’s face, that he was misleading him.
Sherlock nodded, and Mycroft now understood why Sherlock hadn’t wanted to change out of his pajamas for the car ride.  He must have been feeling rather vulnerable to want to wear his nighttime pull-up on the car ride.
“Can I have chocolate milk for breakfast?” Sherlock asked, eyes wide as he turned to Mycroft.
When Sherlock had calmed down a bit, Mycroft guided him to sit back so he could see Sherlock’s face.  Mycroft’s face was soft, but it was clear he wanted to talk.  He passed Sherlock his stuffed dinosaur—Papa must have brought it before leaving with Bunny—and placed the boy’s pacifier on the kitchen table next to them.  Sherlock looked at it longingly, but Mycroft turned his face towards him, and Sherlock understood he was expected to talk before he would be allowed that particular comfort.
And then John was stringing his arms through the Little Mermaid nightshirt, and any chance of staying adult dissipated.  He could not help but stare at the cartoon images on the front, tracing the lines made by each figure.  The feeling the nightgown gave him was a contented happiness he’d rarely felt before, one reminiscent of the quiet times Mycroft cuddled him in his arms, one that cast him down deep into the calm of headspace.  He found himself bouncing on his toes, young and innocent and, more than anything, happy.
John wanted the same type of comfort Mycroft had given him after his accident and during dinner, the same type of comfort he had received when Mycroft bathed John and fed him and cuddled with him as Greg read aloud.  He thought it might be the only thing that could work to lead him to the sleep he so desperately needed.
“It’s okay, hon.”
, where I hope to have a new post up before the end of the week.
“I can’t tell you exactly why we have to leave tonight, honey,” Papa said, “but I need you to trust Daddy and Papa.  In order to make sure both you and Sherlock are always safe and happy when you’re little, we just need to give your Daddy and Sherlock some space, maybe just one night or maybe a few days.  We have to trust that your Daddy can make everything alright.  Do you think we can do that?”
Sherlock sighed.  “I know," he whined.  "Bunny’s not a baby.”
“You’re okay, little one,” Papa was saying into Bunny’s ear as he hugged him close, rocking him in his arms.  “I’ve got you.”
“Don’t tell me what you think I want to hear or how old you wish you felt,” he said.  “Tell me how old you truly feel right now.”
“No no no,” Sherlock whined, hiding his face behind Dimitri and forgetting to force himself to stay older.  “I’m not sick and Bunny’s not sick.”
Mycroft smirked up at Greg, who shrugged from his place just outside the bathroom, looking a bit contrite.  Greg had always had a bit of a soft spot for Sherlock; it was no wonder he had come up with excuses not to spank the boy, despite knowing it would have been Mycroft’s course of action.
“Bun, come on with me and let’s use the loo,” Greg said, holding out his hand.  “Your brother and Mycroft will join us in a moment and we’ll all have some lunch, okay?”
“John’s your little brother, but he’s not a baby.  It hurts his feelings when you call him that name.  I want you to stop calling him that, no matter what he does or how young he slips.”
“That’s a bit of a different issue, kiddo,” he said.  “You know the usual punishment for lying.  Your Papa and I will discuss whether we feel that would be best for this situation.  As for now, I want you to know that I will never be angry with you for having an accident, and Papa and I certainly aren’t going to make you put an ‘x’ on your chart if you do.”
Greg stepped close and held a hand against the boy’s forehead.  He was warm to the touch, and Greg could hear from the boy’s stuffed nose that he was perhaps even more congested than Sherlock.
“Nuh-uh, I’m not a baby, either!” he said, spreading his fingers and placing his hands flat against his shirt to hide the ketchup stains.  “I’m a big boy like Sherlock.”
John woke at Sherlock’s movement, yawning awake and turning to him with a smile.
John was unaware just how long the panic attack lasted.  But eventually Mycroft’s steady, unending counting and his practiced tone became prominent over the flashbacks and agitation, and John, exhausted and gasping for breath, collapsed to the floor at his feet.  Mycroft was beside him in a moment, arm wrapped around his shoulder protectively.
“Yeah, buddy?”
“You were so excited about the pull-ups,” Mycroft said, and John could not help but flush, suddenly aware of the presence of the pink pull-up he’d discarded on the floor when he’d first come upstairs for nap time.  “I’m sorry I did not respond well to that excitement.”
“Bun, you need to breathe and talk to me, kid.  You’re worrying me.  Let me know you’re okay.”
Greg woke in the middle of the night with a groan when Mycroft elbowed him in the ribs.
“Dirty,” was what John admitted first.  “Wrong.”
John could not help but feel a quick stab of embarrassment as he remembered the way he had wet his pants while playing with Sherlock that afternoon.  There had been no option for him within the moment to leave the game and listen to his own body’s needs instead of to Sherlock’s demands, something which fascinated the strong-willed and self-admittedly headstrong man.  There was a reason John sunk lower in age than Sherlock did during ageplay.  Given that he had always felt the burden of being the older brother, he enjoyed slipping low and letting others make most of his decisions.  But that afternoon he’d lost himself to the extent that he’d been unable to act of his own accord, which was a bit disconcerting.  The entire situation had been rather overwhelming, and had led to his teary cries for Daddy.
“Thanks, kid,” he said.  “I knew you’d be the best boy for the job.  But I also need someone to pick out a special surprise for Sherlock’s brother, Bunny.  Do you know anyone who might be right for that job?”
“Jeez, ah, sorry,” he said, reaching for his wallet in order to cover his bill.  “I’ll just…”
“It didn’t work, anyway,” Sherlock said, his admission of a failed plan as much of a ‘you’re forgiven’ as Bunny was likely to get.  “I was naughty but nothing changed.”
Bunny turned his back on his Daddy and dove back down to the bed to hide his face in his pillow.  He could feel the irritation on his tongue, had felt it since he’d woken up and knew it was worse than yesterday, but he wanted his pacifier more than he wanted his tongue to stop hurting, and he knew he wouldn’t be allowed to keep it once Daddy saw the sore.
Mycroft pretended to be deep in thought for a moment, but he soon relented, giving his okay.  Sherlock leaped into Mycroft’s arms with a litany of exclaimed thank yous.
Mycroft entered Sherlock’s bedroom and yanked the comforter from Sherlock’s body.  He was surprised to find John face-down in the bed next to Sherlock, one arm thrown over Sherlock’s bare back.  Mycroft hadn't been expecting to find them in bed together and so had not noticed the man beneath the blankets.  He’d come to learn that, generally, Sherlock tired of sharing his space with his boyfriend and, when they did go to bed together, Sherlock often woke up and sent John to his own room sometime in the middle of the night, always complaining that the man radiated too much heat while he slept.  The two men must have gotten in too late or have been sleeping too soundly to rearrange their positions last night.
Sherlock groaned in the back of his throat and pulled the quilt farther over his head as he leaned to lay against the arm of the couch.  He had been able to keep himself from slipping, had been adamant about staying adult.  But here was Mycroft, close and his alone, and Sherlock could feel himself acutely aware of his plush dinosaur and the newly washed sippy cups Mycroft had left overturned in the drying rack next to the sink.
Mycroft looked thoughtful, then smiled at Greg.
John filled the sippy cup halfway with apple juice, then diluted it with water and screwed the top back on before placing the cup before Sherlock.  The man reached for it and drank greedily from the spout.
The relief of that realization and the thought that Mycroft had been observing him had the unexpected effect of causing him to slip down in headspace for a moment.  He was surprised to feel tears welling in his eyes.  He wished Mycroft could be with him.  He didn’t want Lestrade, especially when Sherlock was away.  He’d never been alone with Uncle Greg while little.  What if Lestrade was only begrudgingly following Sherlock or Mycroft’s orders to watch over him for the night?  He couldn’t bear it if that were the case; he would rather be alone.
“What, honey?” he asked.
Bunny was holding a unicorn horn, rainbow-colored and glittery and attached to a purple headband that could tuck just behind Bunny’s ears.  She could not help but beam with happiness, bouncing once more where she sat as she giggled up at Papa.
It was clear they needed to take stronger action to encourage Bunny in his interests.  This was not only something the boy wanted.  Greg could see now that it was more than that, that, on some level, it was what he needed.
“Okay,” Greg said, holding the boy close as he ran a hand up and down his back.  “Papa understands, Bun.”
Wow, was this a difficult one to write.  I'm not sure why I had such trouble with the narrative here, but it's the reason it took me so long before updating--I had to leave it alone and come back to it numerous times before I even felt like I was marginally getting across what I was hoping to.  Hopefully the flow is okay, and, if not, we'll chalk it up to my busy week and try for something better in the next chapter :)
Sherlock blinked at the sight and his thumb fell from his opened mouth.
They were soon making their way back toward London, John babbling to Willa in half-coherent statements, wondering about the presents Santa may have brought and telling stories of Santa's reindeer.  It was a relief that the kid had finally given into headspace, but Greg was eager for Mycroft and Sherlock and home, eager for them all to be together.  Greg had been planning their little family Christmas for weeks, had set aside the stockings and the ribbons and the gingerbread biscuits.  It had been a tough few days, but he finally had the chance to spoil the kids rotten, and he was planning to take full advantage of the opportunity--no matter how much Mycroft teased.
“Itchy, Papa,” Bunny said, wiping at his runny nose above the pacifier and looking as exhausted as Greg felt.  “Yucky.”
It was John who pulled away after some time, making a distressed noise at the back of his throat and rutting himself quite forcefully against Sherlock’s hand.
Bunny seemed not to notice when they stopped walking altogether.  Greg bent down to the boy.  Although Mycroft argued, Greg felt the boys had far too few toys and items for when they were little; it wasn’t often he got the opportunity to spoil them.
“I don’t have to,” he said, glancing up at Mycroft for only a moment before his gaze returned to the ground.
Mycroft smirked once more, attempting to hold back laughter as he paced back and forth with Bunny in the hallway.  The boys were both so predictable at times, theatrical in their own individual ways.
“Get some rest, sweetheart,” Greg’s mother said in his ear when she hugged John goodbye.  “You were so well behaved today.  I’m sure Santa took notice.”
It was more than he usually got from a man who chose his words exceedingly carefully, but Greg waited for him to go on, knowing that Mycroft wasn’t being entirely accurate in his personal assessment that he was ‘fine.’
“That one,” he said.
John blushed and tried to believe Greg.  After all, he had made it through the day.
Find me on
“Does Mycroft know about the arrangement?” his brother asked.
This chapter is basically angst and accidents, but it does introduce a few questions that will begin to be answered in the following chapters.  I have a sense of what's coming next, just need to find the time to get it all on paper!  That said, if you have suggestions please send them my way!
There was a pause in Mycroft’s string of questioning.
Sherlock looked unsure.
Mycroft had insisted that he try to “use the potty” before they left Baker Street, but a grumpy Bunny had not been in the mood to listen to his Daddy after the spanking.  He’d pretended to use the loo, then he had been ushered downstairs towards the waiting double-parked car.  No one had been paying enough attention to notice that he hadn’t actually peed.  John could now feel the consequences of his stubbornness; his bladder was heavy, and persistent, jostled as they twisted through the London streets.
“That hurts,” Sherlock lied once again, squirming in his seat and attempting to yank his hand from Mycroft's grip.  His voice high-pitched and huffy.  He needed Mycroft to stop talking.
Sherlock whined but allowed himself to be lifted into a sitting position.  Greg coaxed the boy’s thumb from his mouth and held up the dosage cup of cough medicine, which Sherlock sipped in his sleepiness but then spluttered and cried about when he realized what he was taking and Greg made him swallow it down.
“Listen,” Greg said when he’d finished paying at the counter inside and had climbed back into the car with John.  “I know yesterday wasn’t easy.  But you did good.”
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier,” John said.
“You don't have to do this in front of Sherlock if you're not ready,” Mycroft said.
He’d messed up; he knew that.  He needed to explain that he’d been defending his mother, that he hadn’t meant to start a fight and compromise the evidence collection but his thoughts had been shifting back to all those years ago, when he had just been a scared kid fighting to keep his family together.
“Have you been thinking about me?” Greg asked in the midst of snogging, enjoying the image of Mycroft fantasizing about Greg when they were unable to be together.
“John? It’s, uh...I’m not Harriet, I’m Cassie? Her girlfriend?”
But Mycroft had been surly and aloof and loathe to involve himself in the family drama at the time, insisting on burying himself in his books.  The drama belonged to Eurus and Sherlock and Sherlock’s little friend, and was thus too childish for Mycroft to take much interest.  It was not until Eurus’s sing-song rhyme had become the background of their lives for a very trying week, and then, not long after, she set the fire that sent her away, that Mycroft realized he may have been too flippant about the entire ordeal, too quick to assure himself there were others dealing with the problem, too self-involved and cold.
“I’m sorry, Papa,” Sherlock said, and Papa Greg nodded knowingly, then winked to show him all was forgiven.
Bunny was chewing on his thumbnail and rubbing tears from his eyes, but he pointed towards the pull-up after very little consideration.
“Daddy, were the pull-ups in the trolley for me?” he asked, voice sweet and small, standing with a blue and green striped pull-up in his hand.
“Bad news, I’m afraid,” he said, slipping his mobile into the pocket of his pajama pants.  “I’ve got to go into the station for a bit.  There’s been a…”
“Okay, Papa.”
“Do you have any other questions, buddy?” Mycroft asked as Sherlock yawned around his thumb.
Enjoy!
“First you wet your bed and now you wet your pants” Sherlock said, not looking up from his handheld game.  “You really are a baby.”
“I don’t have latent father issues,” he said, eyebrows furrowed.
“So there must be a female in your past that will recall trauma of some kind,” John said, but Sherlock shook his head.
Sherlock hopped over to Uncle Greg and let him dress him in his pajama pants to cover the exposed pull-up while Mycroft led John, still clutching Sherlock’s plastic dinosaur in his fingers, back into the bedroom that had been designated his.
Sherlock was restless, twitching one foot of his crossed leg incessantly as his mother bustled around the living room passing out gifts.  He tossed his gift to the coffee table with a dismissive flourish of his hand.  Sweater.  On Christmas Eve, there were always sweaters, scratchy and woolen and wrapped in last year’s gift wrap.
Sherlock turned to peek up at Mycroft, wiping his face on the crook of his elbow.  A part of him wanted to deny that the soiled clothes were his.  Papa couldn’t prove Sherlock had been the one to wet them, could he?  But he was tired of lying, and he was suddenly feeling very, very small.
Sending you all love and positivity!
“Let me put him down for his nap,” he said, nodding towards Sherlock, whom Mycroft hoped would settle quickly.  “I’ll be back.”
Sherlock keened in the back of his throat, unsure whether to be distraught or ashamed but ultimately settling for grateful.  In one fell swoop, Mycroft had settled his anxious mind.  He had left him with nothing but the reality of punishment and the expectation of future comfort.
“My?” Sherlock asked.
Mycroft could not help but smile at the over-dramatic nature of children, the clear division between adult and child John.  More than amusement, he felt relief that he once and for all had his little Bunny in his arms, even one who was wet and upset.
When John pulled away after a long moment, Mycroft placed a hand on John’s shoulder and held him at arm’s length.
I have a very clear idea of where I want the next few chapters to go, so I'm just hoping I'll have the time to write them this week!  I'm in the midst of busy real-life things, however, so that comes first, I'm afraid.
“We had a bit of trouble,” Lestrade said when Mycroft looked up at him.
When he was at least dried off, he stepped into the pull-up and then the joggers--the drawstring of which he tied tightly to keep them from slipping to show the top of the pull-up--before finding his striped pirate shirt in one of the middle drawers.  He pulled it on, grateful for the comfort item and the fact that its oversizing would allow it to fall well below the waist of his joggers, providing additional peace of mind that his choice to wear a pull-up would go undetected.
Besides, Mycroft could see that something more than a head cold was bothering Bunny, and if he could find a moment to talk with the boy without distractions, maybe he could get to the bottom of whatever was on the kid’s mind.
“Told you,” Sherlock said, an eyebrow raised.
“Aw, don’t be a Grinch,” Greg teased, catching Sherlock’s eye and winking. “Christmas has its own rules about sweets before dinner.”
Mycroft chuckled at the boy’s staunch efforts at clarification and reached forward to continue lathering the shampoo in his hair.
“Yeah,” he said, trying to laugh in order to conjure some kind of nonchalance.  “I’m good.”
“Tell John and big brother what’s wrong,” Mycroft prompted.
“Uncle Greg bought it for me at the store,” he said, voice rough from sleep and a bit shy.
Mycroft rolled his eyes and bid them goodnight, leaning over to kiss their mother on the cheek as he gave in to her sentiment before turning down the hall to trudge up the stairs.  Sherlock was all too happy to follow close behind.
“Wash your hands, Sherlock."
Sherlock came when Joan next moaned, calling out and reveling in the warm mess streaming from John’s cock to wet the sheets beneath them.  He did not take his eyes from John even after he’d finished, and, as soon as it was clear John’s bladder was empty, he snaked his fingers down over the band of John’s underwear until he had pulled his cock free of the soaking wet fabric.
Sherlock was unresponsive, but he did allow himself to be picked up into Mycroft’s arms once more.  He slipped his thumb into his mouth, and Mycroft did not chastise; The boy was not currently in need of any scolding; Mycroft just hoped he wasn't dealing with his own negative criticisms.
Hope you're all well! Sending positive vibes :)
“You don’t need to be little to deserve comfort, Dr. Watson,” Mycroft said.
Mycroft set down the knife on the cutting board and hurried into the living room to find the boys where he had left them on the couch.  They were no longer peacefully watching telly, however.  Bunny was now crying, one hand clapped over his forearm.  Sherlock was sitting with his arms crossed, tucked in the far corner of the couch with his knees bent in front of him, glaring.
“Now,” he said, “Are you ready for naptime?”
Greg and Mycroft arrived at Baker Street, Greg’s duffel slung across his chest.  Quarters were tight at John and Sherlock’s flat, but it was unlikely, given the late hour, that they would be able to get the boys back to Mycroft’s flat without causing additional stress or facing arguments.
“I’m driving, bud,” Greg said, choosing not to engage with Sherlock's accusations of neglect until he knew just what was going on.  “What’s wrong?”
“It’s been a hard day and I’m sure that head cold isn’t helping matters,” Papa said.  “I promise this is for your good as much as for Sherlock’s, baby.  Your Daddy and I never want you to feel like you have to hide who you are, and we certainly don’t want you to change just to make someone else comfortable.”
Dinner and its clean-up had run later than usual given the events leading up to it, but Greg had convinced Mycroft that a little more screen time for the day wouldn’t be the worst digression from his established rules, even if it did extend bedtime by a few minutes, citing the stress of the day and the appeal of a quiet, calming movie night for the kiddos before bedtime.  Bunny had cheered when Mycroft agreed, and he immediately complied when asked to get ready for the movie by cleaning his teeth and putting on some pajamas, racing out of the kitchen with a nodding smile.
Greg could see that something had upset his kid.  He was hunched with his hands in his pockets, and he did not even glance up at Greg’s worried questioning.
John could not help but snort into his half-finished pint.  Sherlock did not look amused, pretending to be hurt by John’s laughter and vowing to give him the silent treatment for the rest of the night.  John apologized and half-heartedly consented to the fact that the origins of liquor certainly made for riveting party conversation.
“I’ve been desperate for hours,” Sherlock breathed as John--others in the pub be damned--tilted his head up to kiss his still-pissing boyfriend.
“Uncle Greg, the bunny needs his pacifier,” Sherlock called, and Lestrade pulled the Peter Rabbit pacifier from his shirt pocket and passed it back to Sherlock, who guided John’s thumb out of his mouth and then held it against the Bunny’s lips until he took it.
But Sherlock had either not heard Bunny’s request or was choosing to ignore it to prolong his own game.  He was crouched on all fours drawing a treasure map, having earlier rushed downstairs to grab crayons and paper.  He had left Bunny alone in the attic, and Bunny sat for a long time before he started to worry he’d been forgotten.  He thought about leaving, but he was scared there were ghosts or monsters in the dark corners of the attic that would grab him if he moved.  Eventually Sherlock’s loud footsteps in the thick boots he had pulled on to complete his pirate costume had come at last, and Bunny had breathed a sigh of relief.
John was standing on the childish stepstool over the sink, brushing with his Little Mermaid toothbrush.  The pirate pacifier rested on the sink beside him.
He needed more time to process before he could talk with Mycroft.  And the best way to do so would be to give himself some space and time, space and time best spent little so he didn’t stress himself out with overthinking and overanalyzing.  If he was little, he wouldn't feel self-conscious about asking for the comfort he knew he needed just then.
“I’ll never stop liking you,” Sherlock said after a moment, stilling the worries in John's mind by addressing the question Bunny had first asked when burrowing against Sherlock to stave off the fear of the storm.  “I’m quite fond of you.”
“Oh, kiddo,” Mycroft breathed, not immune to the guilt and doubt the kid's words instilled within him.
“You’re frozen, kiddo,” Greg said, pressing warm hands against John’s raw cheeks before reaching for John’s overnight bag and slinging it onto his shoulder.  “Let’s get you into the car and warmed up.”
“Sherlock needs wetting and thumb sucking to be responded to as an infraction.  You don't need that or want that.  It's why we have separate rules for each of you.  Do you understand?”
“Head hurts,” Bunny mumbled as Mycroft swapped the boy’s thumb for a pacifier and handed Greg a tissue.
“My?”
.  Greg texted.  Then:
Greg sighed and turned the key in the ignition.  The kid had been under a great deal of stress; he could forgive a bit of dismissiveness for a time.
“Slow down,” Mycroft said when Sherlock whined for more.  “Chew and swallow.  There’s plenty more.”
When he stood from the bed, John had to use the dry corners of the bed sheet to wipe urine from his legs, not wanting to drip across the floorboards.  He found a pair of Sherlock’s more adult pajama pants--a thin blue cotton, and brought them to Sherlock as the man stripped out of his sopping wet clothes before using the remaining dry sections of the sheet to clean himself off.
“Be a good boy and stay there,” he said.  “I’ll get some cream for that rash of yours.  It can’t be feeling very good after that spanking.”
A part of him was terrified that, were he to admit to Greg what had upset him, Papa would just confirm that it had been all his fault, after all.
Mycroft looked a bit skeptical, but he nodded and reached a hand around the back of Greg’s neck as he pulled him in for another kiss.
Sherlock blushed, unsure if he was more upset that a potential monster had noticed his wet bed or that Uncle Greg had.  But, in the end, his curiosity got the best of him, and he leaned forward to peek through the crack between the closet door and the door frame.
Thank you all so, so much for your wonderful support in the comments after the last chapter.  My heart was so warmed by your kindness and well-wishes, and I truly am so grateful for all of you.  I'm feeling better now than I was at the beginning of this week, so thank you for helping me through a rough few days.  Currently I'm doing well but am in desperate need of sleep, so I'm going to post and get some rest.  I promise to respond to every comment in turn once I'm finished with work tomorrow!
“I know, princess,” Mycroft said, taking Bunny’s hands in his own.  “And you didn’t do anything wrong, kiddo.  It was just an accident, and you had on your pull-up so there’s no harm done.  Daddy and Papa were only teasing about Santa, love, which wasn’t very nice of us, was it?”
You're all such lovely humans--thanks as always for your love.  I promise to respond to all of your comments on the last chapter tomorrow morning after catching up on some sleep!
Thanks once again to Pantera72 for reminding me to keep Sherlock and John's relationship in mind throughout these events and to all of you who consistently comment with what you like and what ideas you have (MorbidMotive15, TheGriefPolice, Yvoxy, whispered, Sandrina, and dandelionlad come to mind but I know there are others of you that I'm forgetting!)  A lot of you mentioned angsty Sherlock throwing temper tantrums and acting out, which will definitely be showing up in the next few chapters.
“Come on, love,” she said, nodding towards the doorway.  “The kids won’t let Greg leave until he’s helped them put together their new Lego sets, and you look like you could use a bit of a break.”
"You might need these more than me," Sherlock said, stepping out of the pull-up he had been wearing.
“I’m okay, now,” John said.  “I’ll be okay.”
“I didn’t do anything to him, brother mine.  He had a bad dream.”
“You can’t fault yourself for your decision to keep him from pain,” Mycroft said.  “You were protecting him.”
“Can you pretty please stay with me until I fall asleep?” John asked, still sitting on the toilet with his pants down around his ankles.
“Now, Sherlock,” Mycroft said.  “Unless you’d like me to call your Papa and tell him how you’ve behaved today?”
John nodded, straightened out his rumpled clothing to the best of his abilities, then followed Greg downstairs, where he put on the front of adulthood while he exchanged a litany of pleasantries--thank you for having me and see you soon and Happy Christmas again and again--while Greg fetched their coats and hugged his family.
“I don’t need it,” he said, almost as if he were trying to convince himself.
Mycroft smiled, relieved that Bunny was expressing his desires.
Sherlock finished pulling on his briefs and crossed his arms over his chest.
Hope you're all well :)
“I don’t want it,” Sherlock said, feeling rather irrational.
“Mycroft is going to know,” Sherlock said, gesturing towards John with a spoonful of cereal.  “You’re not exactly inconspicuous when hungover.”
Hi, all--enjoy the second chapter of the day!
“Only if John does,” Sherlock said quietly.
And then John was alone, closed into the back seat as Greg went to check in with Donovan, to make some excuse that would allow them to leave.  John wanted to suck his thumb, but he was too afraid someone would see.  He was desperate for his pacifier or one of his plush toys or his bunny blanket, perhaps more than he’d ever been before.  He needed something to calm him.  He needed Papa, whom he was anxious for until he came back into sight, hurrying towards the car and climbing into the front seat.
I'll do my best to get the next chapter posted very soon because I've left you all waiting far too long for this one.  I've already started writing it, and I'm excited to see where it will go.  Sending you all love and hoping you're having less crazy weeks than me!
Sherlock paused in mid-sentence and the boys turned over their shoulders to look up at him.  When they registered that he had their swim suits, they abandoned their task and rushed across the living room to crowd around him.
“For now, at least,” Greg said.  He took a sip and leaned back into the chair.  “The poor guy’s painfully self-conscious.  Almost always settles down after a few stern words to put him in his place.  Follow that up with a bit of reassurance, and he’ll see reason.”
“Don’t want to go,” Sherlock mumbled.
“Another, Mycroft,” Sherlock said when the storybook was finished, eyes half-closed as he struggled to stay awake while leaning against his brother.
“Shut up or I’ll tell Anderson you’re actually capable of being nice,” he said, falling back against the pillow, still catching his breath.  “Then again, I’m not sure I want anyone else to know.  They might realize how sexy it is, coming from you.”
Sherlock nodded, then braced himself as Mycroft began spanking once more.  His skin felt raw, and each slap stung until he felt numb and pliable.  He was young by the time Mycroft decided he was finished, wiping tears from his eyes as Mycroft sat him up and helped him back into his trousers.
“We should get you changed into a diaper, little string bean,” Mycroft whispered.
Sherlock spat out his toothpaste and glared at John, who had managed to get a tiny trickle of urine into the toilet.  John felt sad that Sherlock was angry with him; there had been plenty of other nights when Sherlock had been put to bed in a pull-up beside an underwear-clad John, but it was obvious the contrast had upset Sherlock tonight.
John struggled to hide his shock and confusion, then decided he didn’t need to.
Sherlock nodded absentmindedly, pacifier between his lips and plush animals snuggled into bed with him.  It was a bit early for the boy to nap--normally, Mycroft would wait until after lunch to attempt to get the boys down to rest--but it had been clear Sherlock was ready to sleep, and keeping him awake would only lead to a very grumpy baby.
“We’ll put it back up when you’re ready,” Mycroft said with a smile.  “For now, let’s not worry about stickers and charts, okay?”
Bunny reached forward to hug Mycroft, who wrapped his arms tight around the other man.  Mycroft was keeping notes on the actions he took to pull Bunny out of sadness.  He’d had years of practice with distraught Sherlock, knew how to read his brother’s emotions in both adult and little headspace.  But Sherlock’s fits and upsets were different than John’s; Mycroft at times still felt unmoored when faced with John’s tears, so it was a relief to feel the man a bit closer to contentment.
“My little brother is far from rational in any state,” Mycroft had explained.  “But there’s no denying he’s most rational when adult.  He won’t be able to process the revelation in any other headspace.”
Daddy cupped the back of his neck to hug him close as he told him it would all go away soon.  Bunny tried to believe him, grateful that Daddy never told him it was
Mycroft nodded.
“Night, Mycroft,” John yawned.
“Sherlock,” he said, stepping behind the boy and placing a hand on his shoulder.  “Let’s go use the loo, lad.”
John finished his bourbon and Mycroft poured him another.
And then it was not a question of waiting for permission, because there were sniffles and tears sounding from within the bathroom.  Greg sighed as Mycroft turned towards him once more; it was not hard to ascertain what had happened.
This chapter has been basically finished for a few days now, but has been giving me a TON of trouble--I've gone back to edit again and again but still haven't felt that it's as successful as I'd like it to be.  Depicting Mycroft's intentions and motivations was tough without getting into my usual trap of over-explaining, but I tried to pare the exposition down to only what was necessary.  Maybe I'll come back and edit a bit, but I figured I should probably just get it up and move forward.
Mycroft was quick to deny the child’s assumption, smiling as he attempted to focus Bunny’s attention away from himself.
“Hi, Papa,” Bunny mumbled sleepily as he rolled over to snuggle up against Greg.
“Yeah, okay,” he said, and all of the tension that had been building in his body seemed to slip away.
A voice in the back of his mind told him he was overtired and overreacting after a nearly sleepless night, that he was jumping to conclusions and that all would be set right again after some atonement.  But Sherlock was not in a position to accept rational mindsets at the moment, and allowed the sudden possibility of ageplaying without Bunny to bring about loud, guttural sobs which made his throat ache.  His mind was swarming with questions: What if Bunny didn’t want to play with him anymore? What if Papa and Mycroft decided Sherlock couldn’t be Bunny’s brother now that he’d been so rude and mean?  What if they didn’t let him be little anymore?
It was nearly eleven by the time Mycroft arrived at Baker Street.  Greg had planned to come along, worried after both John and Sherlock had left Mycroft’s flat the previous day, but he’d been called away just after breakfast.
“Let’s snuggle in the living room a bit, love bug,” Daddy was saying over him, his voice soft and assuring as he helped Bunny up off the floor by a hand because he was still carrying Sherlock.
Greg knew that Mycroft had been able to see John’s change of state the moment he had appeared in the hallway, just as Greg had.  But Greg also knew just how much Mycroft worried about John’s state of mind while adult.  They had spoken about John’s seemingly constant feelings of guilt, his inability to express emotion, and his unwillingness to put himself before others.  Mycroft’s use of John’s little nickname had been an attempt to shift the man back down again, an attempt to settle him back into a headspace that allowed for comfort and Mycroft’s own peace of mind.
Bunny became increasingly frustrated, but every time he asked Sherlock if they could stop and play something else, Sherlock said he was a baby who obviously couldn't handle games for big boys, and Bunny kept his mouth shut.
“My?”
“Fair enough,” Mycroft said, a bit relieved that he was not going to need to facilitate a conversation regarding ageplay with his parents.  “Then my second question is: would you like to be little for the rest of the car ride?”
He quickly stepped into the cartoon underwear and yanked up his pajama pants.  He strung his arms through his flannel dressing gown--it was patterned green and Sherlock had teased John that that was a Slytherin color, but John liked the warmth and comfort of it too much to give it up.  When John emerged from the bathroom, he felt an immense relief to find Greg waiting for him with the Chinese food unpacked and the table set.
Bunny hadn’t realized they were heading towards a spanking until the moment his Daddy shifted the boy out from between his knees and nudged him over his lap.
Greg sighed, but, after making a silly face at his nieces who were pressed against the glass of the living room window to say goodbye, he shifted the car into reverse, and they were on their way.
Mycroft could see John begin to slip.  This was getting to be a bit too much for the man who was clearly tired from the emotional toll of the day.  But he needed to get information while John was willing.
Sherlock turned to Mycroft with his mouth open, his face full of all the shock of someone who felt they’d been unjustly wronged.
“Bun, are you feeling like a boy right now because you think Sherlock would feel sad if you were a girl?”
John waited for Sherlock to brush his teeth and spit the toothpaste into the sink.
"No apologies, dear," she said, giving his shoulder a comforting squeeze. "We all need a little rest from time to time."
My gift to you is a new chapter :)  I was planning to pick up the narrative the next day, but our little Sherlock had too many questions and concerns left unaddressed, so we ended up with something a bit different.
he texted over to Greg, pleased when he could see the man was typing immediately.
“Guest bedroom or Master bedroom?” Mycroft asked after he’d towelled John’s hair a bit.
“But why are you crying, bud?” he asked, wiping tears from his brother’s cheeks.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft sighed, allowing himself a moment of frustration as he pushed the blankets back and climbed out of the bed.  “You know better than that.  I thought you were a big boy.”
“But you’re not my Daddy,” Sherlock said, biting the edge of his thumb.  “You’re just my big brother.”
John liked when Mycroft used the word ‘potty,’ as if it were normal, as John he were young enough to still be potty training and Mycroft was the one training him.  The idea pleased him.
Mycroft shushed Sherlock’s tears, suddenly ashamed of himself for being so intent on Sherlock remaining adult.  If Sherlock needed to be small, who was Mycroft to make him feel as if that were wrong?  Yes, they were heading to visit their parents, but that didn’t mean Sherlock couldn’t have been small on the ride there.  Hell, if Sherlock wanted to be small
“Papa, ‘Lockie,” Bunny said, voice as young as Bunny got.  “Uncle Greg is really just Papa.”
The shock to his system when he’d landed hard on the cement had steadied him a bit, and he no longer felt the type of blind anger which had prompted him to take a swing at the poor bloke who had been at the wrong end of John’s tough day.
It was an hour after the boys had gone down for the night, and Mycroft set out two highball glasses and the bottle of bourbon.  He assumed he would be having another late night conversation with John, who Mycroft knew would need help processing the events of the day.
“Sherlock will come around, ladybug,” Daddy said.  “He said some nasty, hurtful words, but he loves you very much.  He may need a bit more time to process this new change, and his actions were wrong in every way.  But he would never intentionally hurt you.”
“Juice,” he said as John placed a child-sized spoon beside his bowl and told him to blow on the soup so as not to burn his tongue.
“If you used the potty upstairs that means you get to pick a sticker, ‘Lockie!” Bunny exclaimed, bouncing on his toes in excitement, clearly unable to fathom a situation whereby Sherlock would have “gone” before lunch without using the loo.  He turned to Papa for confirmation when Sherlock was unresponsive.  “Papa, Sherlock used the loo so he gets to choose a sticker for his chart, right?”
“Let’s get you home, champ,” he said after a time, patting the boy’s back to signal that he needed him to sit up.
“Unlikely.  If you had your way, we’d be here till morning while you teased me with your dry humping.”
“I know, kiddo,” Greg said.  “He needed to make sure you would think twice before putting yourself in a dangerous situation like the other night.”
“Uh oh, bud,” he said.  “You had a little accident, huh?”
“I thought you were a big boy, Sherlock,” Mycroft said from his place in the kitchen where he had been folding the laundry. He was frustrated with his younger brother’s antics that day.  They had already had to deal with two time outs--one for refusing to brush his teeth and another for throwing food he didn't want to eat--and Sherlock had been fussy and needy the entire morning.  Mycroft stood with his hands on his hips and sighed as he took in the state of Sherlock’s wet pajama pants and the puddle on the carpet in the middle of a scattering of Legos.
Sherlock wasn’t sure he could face an adult John at the moment, at least not when John was likely to find out Sherlock had hurt himself.  He could sense Papa didn’t want him to focus on Mycroft or John at the moment, but Sherlock couldn’t help it.  He had resolved himself to the fact that he hadn't been able to turn his mind off all day, and now he needed as much information as possible in order to anticipate each potential scenarios that could emerge from the current circumstances.
Greg wished he had some sort of comfort item to provide for the boy beyond the pacifier he’d tossed into the glove compartment early on in his days of caring for the boys.  At the time, he’d had to shrug off Mycroft’s loving teasing about him being far too committed to his role as Papa, but the foresight had clearly paid off.  Little John would not be completely content until they were home with his plush rabbit and his blanket and his Daddy, but, for now, Greg would take what they could get from a little bit of red plastic.
Thank you for your comments and kudos--I'm super behind in responding to comments, but I promise to respond to each and every one of them very very soon (hopefully tonight, although they're saying the archive will be down for a bit tonight).  Let me know what the boys should get up to in their last afternoon and morning at the lake house as well as (possibly) on their car ride back to London--looking for suggestions for anything cute and fluffy to end this story on a high note!
“Alright, buddy,” he said.  “Will you be alright alone for a moment while I go gather John and Greg?”
Greg reclaimed his seat with a sigh as Mycroft sipped at his tea.
“Keep your hand out of your mouth, Bunny,” Mycroft said when he noticed John about to suck his muddy thumb.
Mycroft sighed a sigh to rival little Sherlock’s when he’d been sent to time out, and Greg crossed around behind the man to wrap an arm around his shoulders.
“Sherlock’s a big boy, today, Daddy?” Bunny asked around his pacifier, sitting up as Mycroft came closer.
Mycroft nodded, the closest Greg would get to an “I love you, too” when Mycroft was sober and shifting into problem-solving mode.
Christmas Eve at the Lestrades was a bustling, cheerful affair.  Greg’s parents’ house was warm and inviting: crackling fireplaces in both the dining and living room, wreaths and garlands hung on doors and across mantle pieces, and no less than three Christmas trees scattered around the ground floor.  Beneath the twinkling lights and glittery reindeer statuettes were pictures of Greg and his older brothers--recent pictures from commendations Greg had received after solving difficult cases or promotions his brothers had received at work, graduation photos from various university commencement ceremonies, even an elementary school picture where the photographer had caught Greg in a laugh, freckled and missing his two front teeth.
Mycroft lifted the man by the armpits and carried him down the hallway to the bathroom where he whisked off John’s pants and, after situating him by the toilet, pulled down the now soaked pull-up before helping him to sit.  John finished his wee in the toilet, wet pull-up hanging around his ankles as he cried.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft called across the room.  “Say thank you to Uncle Greg.”
For his part, Mycroft looked concerned.  It was an almost imperceptible change in the man's general emotional state, but John could see the man was flustered all the same.  John had come to learn he would see this side of Mycroft if and only if the man was worried about his little brother.  John nodded towards the far side of the kitchen as Mycroft dropped his briefcase to the floor and moved quickly towards his brother.
They sat breathing together until John was well enough to stand.  Mycroft led him back to the guest bedroom, where he sat on the edge of the bed, told John to lay down, and began rubbing John’s back.  He told him he was safe, told him he was not alone.  The plush rabbit was placed beside John’s pillow, and John jerkily reached to tuck it under his arm, hiding the blush spreading across his cheeks by shifting deeper into the sheets and blankets.
“I didn’t do anything mean,” Bunny said while perched on Greg’s hip.  He sniffled as he wiped his face on the back of his wrist.  “I only asked if he had to potty because he was holding between his legs.”
“Is this what was on your mind, earlier?” he asked.
The voice sounded like Uncle Greg, but Sherlock wasn't sure whether to trust it.  What if a monster had stolen Uncle Greg’s voice like the sea witch in the mermaid movie John liked so much?  What if he opened the closet and it wasn't Uncle Greg at all?
Sherlock squirmed again.  Mycroft knew that squirm.
,” John said, getting as close as they’d ever come to talking about Sherlock’s youngest headspace.
Bunny was having a tough time concentrating on anything other than how safe and small he felt in his Daddy’s lap.  But Daddy rubbed his arm and nodded to the stickers spread out on the table beside Papa--stars, mermaids, dinosaurs, cupcakes, ladybugs, lizards, pirate ships, princesses, planets--and the bright colors and sparkles caught his attention.  Bunny wanted to look through all of them, had already began planning the ones he would choose to stick onto the rows of his chart.
Even still, they both had long drives ahead of them, and Sherlock would not have denied that he missed John’s presence.
“Yeah,” John nodded, feeling a bit more confident after Uncle Greg’s game.  Uncle Greg wasn’t mean or scary; he was the same as he had always been.  And, John realized, if he was, he would have Mycroft to deal with.  If Greg wanted to sustain any type of relationship with the man--romantic, as it had seemed lately, or otherwise--he would need to keep Mycroft happy.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was a thought Bunny had never put into words before, one that had occurred to him now and then but that he had never fully acknowledged.  Now that the words had been said, they were all he could think about, and Bunny knew they were part of what contributed to his headache.  Did he really not want to be a boy anymore? What did it mean if he wanted to be a girl?  He was pretty sure Papa wouldn’t mind, but what about Daddy?  What about Sherlock?  And if he felt like a girl last night and today, did that mean he had to be a girl every time he was little?  What if sometimes he still wanted to be a boy?
John nodded.  He trusted Uncle Greg, and knew he would take good care of blanket.  Greg placed a stack of clothes on the end of the bed, next to where John was sitting.
The decision was taken from his hands when Papa’s brother was suddenly approaching the bottom of the stairs.
“Does he still want to color?” Sherlock asked, a bit unclear as to what Papa expected him do with the information he’d just given to him but remembering that Mycroft wanted Sherlock to support Bunny however she was feeling.
“Sherlock, could you come in here, please?” he called.
Mycroft stood from the kitchen table.  He had half a mind to pull Sherlock over his lap and spank him right there on his bare behind for the snark he was showing, and he opened his mouth to tell his brother as much.  But it was Greg who spoke up first.
John groaned and fished in the cabinet for aspirin, popping the top from the bottle and tipping the pills into his palm.  He turned on the faucet and cupped his hand beneath the stream of water in order to drink down the pills, then filled the kettle and turned the burner to high.
“You’ve been there for your big brother throughout it all,” Mycroft continued.  “And you know what?  That’s how a big boy acts.  I’m proud of you, Bunny.”
“Turn this way,” Mycroft said, and Bunny was suddenly blinking up at him.
Bunny was interested in getting a closer look at Sherlock’s diaper, wondered how long Sherlock would wear them.  His Daddy had mentioned he would put Bunny down for a nap in the big bed with Sherlock; maybe Bunny would be able to crawl under the covers and see if Sherlock had wet himself, too.
Okay, enjoy! Thank you all for your lovely support <3
“And are you ever...small?”
Greg scoffed, then joked with his mother about wishing she were the one monitoring his stats when he went for his yearly physicals.
“I don’t want to put you out,” John said.  “I was frustrated before, overwhelmed, is all.  I’ll be fine to head back to Baker Street.”
Sending bunny kisses on this rainy (where I am, at least) day! <3
Sherlock’s face became intense as he typed a sequence of keys furiously. He sighed in frustration, then shifted his attention to John.  “You looked peaceful.  The probability was that you were still small.”
Sherlock nodded, reaching forward to toy with the buttons on Mycroft’s shirt.
“Thank you, Ma,” he said, pulling her in for a hug.  “This world doesn’t deserve you, you know that?”
“I’m finished, Daddy,” Bunny announced.
“Good?” John asked, sitting beside Sherlock and starting in on his own halved grilled cheese.
“Sleep well, ladybug,” Daddy said, leaning to kiss her on the forehead.
“I was in deep, Mycroft,” John breathed as he looked up at the older man.  “I’ve never been in that deep.  I knew I had to go but I kept telling myself it would go away, that I would miss something if I went.  Then I thought Sherlock would be upset if we had to pause for Uncle--for Greg to bring me to the bathroom, and also for some reason I was nervous to tell Greg I had to go.  He had just asked ten minutes before, and I’d lied and told him I didn't have to.  I’m not even really sure why.  So I rationalized holding it.  I truly was under the impression that it would go away if I just ignored it.  But then it got bad enough that I knew I had to tell someone.  And by the time I got to Greg, it was too late.  Oh, god, Lestrade must have been so mortified.  I just stood in front of him and pissed myself.”
But Mycroft had come this far, and he was not about to slide back on the rules just because it was Christmas night.
“Do you need the loo, lad?” Uncle Greg asked, and Bunny pulled his hand out of his pants.  He had been tracing the patterns on the front of the pull-up.
Mycroft paused, then deliberately cocked his head towards his brother.  Sherlock, last Mycroft had known, was under the impression they’d needed to put the dog down.  But if that had been the case, Mycroft would not have been so concerned, and Sherlock would not have recalled Redbeard as connected to a young girl.  Many children had experiences losing a pet to euthanasia.  If Redbeard had faced the same fate, why would Mycroft have taken such care to keep the memory contained?
Mycroft refrained from teasing that his brother was a bit too late for protest given that he was buckled into a car at the beginning of a four and a half hour journey out of London.
“John?” he asked.
Finding his mobile where it had been left on the desk in his bedroom sometime after he and John had dropped into headspace, he called Papa.  If Mycroft wasn't going to help, maybe Papa would.  Maybe Papa would call Mycroft and yell at him and tell him Sherlock needed him, that Sherlock was more important than the important people on the phone.  But the phone rang and rang and went to voicemail, and Sherlock, anger re-emerging, threw his mobile to the ground.  He turned, buried his face in the pillows, and yelled, struggling against anger and sadness and the dark thoughts he'd been suffering with all day.  No one was going to help him, because no one thought he was most important.  Mycroft had picked John the night before and picked the important business people now, and Greg had picked John to go to work with him and now they were working on a case where they clearly didn't even need Sherlock. No one cared that he was sad and angry and wet; it all just felt so hard.
For now, Sherlock led his boyfriend up the stairs, and they stripped down and fell into bed.  John’s breathing steadied as they lay bare chest to bare chest, pretending for a moment that his only worry was how he would build up the energy to pull the sheet over their intertwined bodies.
And Bunny at last knew Daddy was right, because the shapes of the room began to get softer and the tight fear stopped choking him with its threatening squeals.  He felt the weight on his chest lightening as the image of the monster fell away, and he was at last able to breathe normally.
Sherlock tried to push Bunny forward, suddenly shy about having woken them up, but Bunny ducked back behind Sherlock and tried to hide behind him.
John wiped his face.  He felt much better after talking with his Daddy, and, if he were lucky, Mycroft might be home tomorrow.  John reached a hand down and felt the wetness of his pajama pants.  John had more liquid in him, and, as he waited for Greg to get off the phone, he wondered what it would be like to release his bladder fully.  He wanted to feel smaller, wanted it to soak himself even more and wanted to let someone else worry about cleaning him up.  He wanted to forget the pain and the stress of the day.
“Me and Redbeard,” Sherlock said.
“You two ruffians are gonna be the death of me,” he said, but he leaned over until Bunny was able to crawl onto his back.
“Take all the time you might need,” Mycroft said.  “Thank you for telling me.  I will follow your lead.  For now, do you have a sense of how you’d like me to respond if it does happen again?”
“And John?”
“I have to go again,” John said, quietly.  He wasn’t sure Mycroft would believe him.  He wasn’t even sure he was telling the truth.  He could feel a fluttery feeling in his tummy that may have been tinkle but may just have been nerves because Mycroft was about to leave him alone.
The chair rocked them back and forth, and, with a contented sigh, Sherlock at last gave into his younger self.  He allowed his mind to go a bit fuzzier, concentrating only on the feel of Mycroft beneath him and the back and forth motion of the rocking chair.  He was comfortable and for the first time in what felt like hours did not feel on the verge of dissolving into a coughing fit.  He hoped Mycroft would never make him get up out of the rocking chair.
“You’re wet, little one,” Mycroft said as he stroked the boy’s cheek.  He knew how sensitive the boy was feeling at the moment, so his voice was gentle when he next spoke.  “It will only take a moment, love.”
“I received a call one night.  It was Sherlock.  He’d failed a recent group project because he’d refused to work with the others and turned in his own work individually, and he’d had an argument with his roommate, who’d put in a request with student services to have his room changed, who’d taken to calling Sherlock a freak.  He sounded so small on the other end of the line, the way he had as a child, and I drove to university and picked him up in the middle of the night.”
Bunny hesitated as Mycroft turned to leave the room.
Keep sending your ideas and letting me know what you like so I know what direction to continue in.  Sending you all positive vibes and bunny kisses! :)
He carried Sherlock back through the house, gathering Dimitri and Bunny’s offered baby blanket, Sherlock’s pacifier, and his still-half-full sippy cup of juice from breakfast before sliding open the glass door which led to the porch.  It was a beautiful summer morning, sunny enough to warm them but breezy enough to keep them from feeling uncomfortably warm.
Sherlock had known as soon as he opened his eyes that morning that it was going to be one of his bad days.  They came consistently but without much warning, settling him into a form of hopelessness he had trouble navigating.  If he had been back at Baker Street and not in headspace, he would have locked himself in his bedroom and tried to ride out his distress and apathy with the help of drugs or, on his worst days, self-harm.  But he had not woken up at Baker Street, and he most certainly had not been in an adult headspace--it was fairly hard to consider aging up while lying in wet pajama trousers in bed with three other men.
Mycroft had not originally had any qualms about Bunny’s requests for mermaid bath toys or glitter crayons.  He’d bought the boy what he asked for, pleased to see him feeling comfortable in little space even while coloring princesses and watching Disney movies.  But, as the weeks passed and John became more comfortable ageplaying and more likely to express his desire for feminine items, Mycroft had begun to worry that John’s desire to express himself in this way was less healthy for John than he had originally anticipated, and it was this worry that brought out his unsurety and displeasure.
“We do not throw things in this house,” he said in the voice he used which meant you were in trouble, calm but dark.  “You’re in time-out.”
“Alright, goofball,” Greg said, drying Bunny’s hands and bending down to let the boy climb onto him from the step stool for a piggyback ride.  “Let’s go find your silly Daddy and your silly brother.”
Bunny’s eyes seemed to light up at the prospect of presents.  No one else would have known to look for it, but Greg had seen the glances of longing John had cast towards Greg’s nieces and nephews as they’d opened their presents from their grandparents the night before.  He’d been dying to tell the man then and there that there were toys waiting for him at home, wrapped in Christmas paper and hidden in the closet of the guest room.  He’d been waiting to put them out beneath the tree, waiting for their little family Christmas.
Sherlock nodded, currently feeling as if he would agree to anything if it meant he could stay cradled in his big brother’s arms.
Bunny scrambled to his feet and hurried out of the living room as tears filled his eyes.  He needed to find a spot where he could be alone.  He needed to hide.
“I need to get back to Baker Street,” John said, shaking his head.  “Just, ah...take care of Sherlock?  Let me know if I can do...anything.”
Papa’s voice was at its gentlest, which made Sherlock feel like crying again.  He yanked the duvet tighter around him.
Lastly, thank you to Simi, falc0nwing, and tiaoconnell for pointing out that Mycroft will not be a very happy camper given the way John chose to use alcohol to numb his emotions throughout chapter 13.  That idea was spot-on, and allowed for some interesting teasing between Sherlock and John in this chapter.   You were all right that Mycroft will likely have words (or punishments) for John in regards to his drinking, and I'm interested to explore what that might look like in the next chapter or two!
Greg and Mycroft turned to see John standing in the hallway behind them.  The man must have been listening to their conversation from the bathroom, must have watched to parse out the situation.  Despite being dressed in his bunny pajamas, the outline of a full pull-up visible beneath his pants, his manner had changed.
Greg filled the boys’ plates and then Mycroft’s and his own, and they all began eating, hungry after the travels of the day.  Sherlock was scooping large bites of pasta and chicken into his mouth until Mycroft reminded him to slow down and chew.
He felt much better now that he was dry, but there was still the issue of the wet clothes and the stain on the carpet in the guest bedroom.  He couldn’t throw them into the hamper; Mycroft or Papa would be sure to find them.  He couldn’t bring them to the washing machine; it was in the downstairs bathroom and he would have to walk past the others.  He had to hide them somewhere no one would be likely to look.  He gathered up his wet things, careful not to press any wet sections against his chest as he moved the chair blocking his door and crept back out into the hallway and down to the guest room.
