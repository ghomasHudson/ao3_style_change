Dean's glare didn't lighten as he yanked the angel up, not caring when he cried out in agony wings twisted, body mangled. Blood, rain, and dripping grace everywhere
"No need to explain. I get it. Just, as long as you know what you're doing just... Uh" Dean stammered.
"Heal him. Now"
"Listen, Cassie, everything is under control. Like you said, we got a hand in one of the largest banks. Half of our industry now has a solid cover." The blond leaned forward, arms rested over his knees as he clasped his hands together.
"I can't do this anymore." He sniffed, blue eyes blinked several times to clear the fog of tears, red and puffy from hours of silent sobbing. He had sobbed loudly, ugly cries had torn through his throat when he found Dean. Begged him to wake up, eading for this to be some ugly twisted joke, screaming at him to wake up and be fine, to breath, to smile, to shout at him, anything! But now all Castiel could do was silently let the tears fall.
This one is chapters 5,6 and 7. Enjoy
But the angel kept th heart beating and the breath breathing anyway. It honestly was a comfort to Dean, to feel, and hear the strong heart beat under his hear. The warmth of Castiel pressed against him was soothing. Dean didn't say anything, and Castiel didn't press him to.
"Her name is Kelly Kline. She is an Omega maid, unmated and I suppose uninterested. She works here in the castle because she has proven to be able to care.for herself against any clouded Alpha with ideas." Castiel chuckled remembering some younger Alpha's he had known that were knights or training to he that had attempted to make a move on the woman "Why do you ask?"
Dean spun around ready to either punch or bolt he was heavily conflicted on which, his body tried to run but his hands clenched into fists, when someone grabbed his arm with a growl.
"I feel we should come up with something different. Just sign a treaty or something instead. They're close enough as friends, allies even. Sam is next in line for the throne and has expressed he wants nothing but continued peace among Heaven and Earth. Dean has expressed that Michael feels much the same and I'm willing to work with the boy when he's crowned the day of the wedding." John explained spreading a hand out as he spoke to put emphasis on everything he had just presented.
"I'm sure we will Castiel. I mean it." Lucifer spoke softly to the Prince as he knew how upset the boy was. "History will not repeat. We will find him." As the words left Lucifer's lips his nostrils flared and his eyes moved over Castiel's shoulder, his features hardened and a growl bubbled in his throat, at the end of the hall, getting handsy with what was obviously an escort of some sort, was a demon with white eyes and the smell if burning ash and burning coals. The scent was right there and it matched what Lucifer had smelled throughout the hallway, and yes, the lingering and faint smell of vanilla, leather and Omega in heat faintly came off the demon as he made his way past the two angels without a care in the world.
"So, you enjoy babysitting me?"
Michael was nothing but a white feathered, dark haired ball fo worry.
He was pushed to sit on the bed and his boots were removed
With a deep breath the Angel's deep black wings lowered slightly and the young Prince let his breath out.
His couch had been scooted and so had the coffee table, some of the dining room chairs were in here. A fort of sheets took up most of the large room, tied up like a triangular tent of sorts, the ends tied to the damn ceiling fan. Conveniently the TV was included in the tent.
However, once Dean mentioned Barton and Howlett, the frown on Michael's face disappeared only to be replaced by a sincere chuckle and smile to go with it. "I swear those two drove me mad. They always made you feel like such a curve, but if the goal was to fill someone with daylight, Howlett never disappointed." Mike joked, hinting at the very few but very obvious talents the two sergeants had. "Books? Winchester, if there was a book on how to catch a mafia family, I'm pretty sure we wouldn't be sitting here." he chuckled, adjusting his watch and rolling the sleeves of his light grey dress shirt up another bit.
"Than I will braid it as a crown..."
Lucifer growled, rubbing his arm with a glare, he took a few strides to the side mantel Castiel had I'm his home office, pulled three crystal glasses out and poured some whiskey for each of them. The eldest Novak glared at his reflection, another detective to dodge. Didn't they just give up? They never could actually link any of them to any crimes. It was all suspicion because they were rich, illusive, and had a foreign heritage. Okay, and how they attained their fortune was a mystery, they maybe had one bruno try for some eased sentence and told them the Novaks had hired him for this drive-by that had targeted and assassinated a rival mobs head. But before the guy could testify, Lucifer had him in a pair of cement shoes. So the feds didn't give up. But this new Detective surely would.
"I suppose we will. Have you ever..."
"Good morning to you too Lydia." Dean sighed now with Emma standing beside him as he fussed with Ben's buckles and grabbed their bags
"That's very Kind. I assure you I'm alright. I didn't suffer any serious injuries." Michael explained running a hand through his already messed up dark hair, blinking a few times to clear the sleep from his eyes as his icy colored gaze met his father
"I'm sorry did you.. Say something?"
"What's so funny Michael?"
"A lot of-- gunsels, huh? I never paid attention then." Mike lied, "Why pay attention to men if there are just as many stunning dolls dancing about?" he chuckled, playing his part. "But I do see how you always get what you want." Mike rambled, without giving the sentence any second thought. Was that flirtatious?! Shit... "You knowing how to trick even men into telling you what you want to hear does speak for your acting qualities." he swiftly added, hoping he didn't raise any suspicion - though he was pretty happy with his save.
Gone. Painlessly gone.
"You keep her name off your lips wench!" Chuck's wings ruffled, eyes wild as he pushed past wedding goers to stand before Rowena, but maintained a little distance
"What struggles?" Michael raised an eyebrow at the demon and folded his hands neatly before him on the table
"Prince Dean, we need to talk about Michael."
"You're not the usual maid." Crowley's voice echoed from where he stood by the window
The Winchester simply shook his head and bit his lip
The thought of simply plunging into the dark swirling water seemed so very tempting, to end this pain that ate at his shattered heart and his very soul.
While Michael wasn't angry, and not exactly hurt that Dean had fallen for Castiel, he was a little shocked that his little brother actually/ went through/ with conducting an affair with Dean.
Gabriel smiled an evil little elfin kind of smirk and nothing but playful mischief dancing in his eyes as he saluted and nodded again.
"No."
Gabriel's day passed in a flurry, and by the time he watched Dean and his older brother Michael ride off into the woods, he was exhausted.
"How's that been going for ya? Never had a man chase you out a bar before?" he joked, shaking his head in amusement. Yeah, so he admitted to pretending from time to time to be some homosexual, Michael shouldn't take it weird right? He wasn't actually like that. Nope.
"Tell him Dean." Sam spoke up rubbing his arm and shifting his weight awkwardly
They stared at one another for a moment before she moved forward and again their lips met.
Sitting up the Crowned Prince stretched out his arms and wings, spine letting out a series of gentle pops.
"Nice seeing you too. Congrats on the marriage by the way." Turning his face to Castiel Dean continued "I will text you with the run down by this evening before we close."
Lilith's smile only grew more snake like as she tilted her head and cupped his face in both her manicured hands, her eyes flicked white and her leathery black wings flexed slightly
As he opened the door one ot the Beta gaurds had just raised his hand to knock. The young Angel looked rather startled but with a twitch of his wings seemed to relax.
The four remaining Princes of Heaven stood before their Kingdom, with heavy hearts. Before them lay the casket of their fallen brother Raphael, an angel that had foolishly betrayed his family, making them suffer terribly for it.
Sulfur.
"Alright alright. I won't pry." John's hand came up to rest on the side of Dean's neck, the prince involuntarily flinched, but relaxed only little when the hand was gentle. "But I do want to know eventually." His voice was soft, a tone Dean rarely heard from his strong King of a father.
"I happened to see him heading to the stables as I made my way here this morning. If you hurry you may catch him... Though bring that satchel of rations to him. It would make for a decent excuse I believe."
"Y-you don't understand what it's like Sam." Dean whimpered as his watery eyes blinked back tears, he licked his lips and sniffed a little trying not to cry anymore "I have so much on my plate right now. I-I'm not ready to be a mother."
"Gabriel you cannot actually be serious. You don't even know if Crowley can be trusted, but you'll go off this information he gave you? It's rather vague don't you think?" Sam braced one hand splayed over a map, the other fisted over his hip as he stared at the older Prince. Gabriel had to be mad to do this, ludicrous to even think of doing this on his own "Does your farher know? Or Michael? Castiel? Balthazar? Anyone?"
Dean bit the inside of his cheek again and squirmed in his seat with a grunt.
"I know." Dean mumbled and pulled the trenchcoat closer to his body. The warm smell if coffee was comforting.
Both Alpha's looked to the door with soft smiles
With a sigh he wandered around the garden for quite some time just trying to get his mind off of this. To get his heart off of it.
Is it even possible for him to be feeling this way? Ever since Dean arrived Castiel has felt an overpowering urge to Protect, the word mate keeps bouncing in his mind and it scares him.
Chuck snapped his mouth shut, grey and white whinga raising with anger, his hands were shaking, his face burning red
His head snapped up to Castiel, eyes widening and mouth opening to speak, hands reaching for his gun, as the angel strode forwards before the hunter could actually get ahold of his weapon, The angel touched his forehead, putting him to sleep, scooped him up in his arms and disappeared.
"Because I have a feminine scent. I'm short, I'm weak, I'm passive aggressive, I don't enjoy fighting or arguing, and I tend to be a bit maternal when it comes to little ones. I have no desire to lead, and I rather live in peace raising a family, than rule a kingdom and fight in a war." Gabriel blew out in exasperation as he flopped on the carpet and crossed his legs, gold feathers twitching in discomfort, his face in a pout as he stared into the cold fireplace.
Dean's laughter at something Charlie said quickly died out as his eyes fell on Michael. An uncharacteristic quietness fell over the freckled Winchester as he took his horse, Baby's, reigns from Kelly. Michael frowned and gave a sigh as Charlie appeared very closely beside him.
"Wow Cas. Okay. We can't get pregnant we're dudes. Stop reading that fanfic shit Becky sends you."
Alpha -
"I hope your affairs are in order, for I am going to send your head to your whore Queen." With the rage of the Heavens Castiel flicked his blade from his sleeve as the demons white and swollen bloody eyes widened in complete fear.
Dean's green eyes finally met the angels. No words were exchanged, Dean simply jersey his head in the smallest of nods, that yes, he did want to talk about it. Though no words came from the hunter Castiel understood. Dean didn't know where to start, what to say. He was hurting though.
"I should be! You're only to he King because you're the favorite! But you are soft, weak, and most disturbing, in love with another Alpha! Do not expect me to serve and obey a weak Alpha as yourself." Raphael but out, his scent of Eucalyptus and wintergreen nearly suffocating the entire room, clashing with the anger rolling off of Michael
"Michael will understand, Dad will understand- Castiel? What does Castiel have to do with this?" Sam asked suddenly very confused as to why Dean was so concerned about what Castiel thought of the matter.
"He'll ruin it by not telling her. They always want to know. They always end up making tracks out of sheer fear if they only learn the truth later on. It never works, but who am I to tell a grown man what to do," he sighed, shaking his head in annoyance as he closed the heavy book in front of him with just a bit too much force.
The angel holding Dean suddenly let go, stepping away from the hunter with a low growl that made the room seem to tremble
So that could only mean good things right? But Dean couldn't shake the smell of ocean spray and winter rain from his nose as Castiel stood beside his oldest brother.
Lucifer rolled his eyes and looked at the Prince with a sigh.
Lucifer smiled, blood on his lips and teeth but he hardly noticed
The two stared into each other's eyes for what Dean swore was an eternity. Blue blue blue and more blue. It's all Dean saw, Castiel's eyes were a blue that outshined all blue that the human had ever seen.
Castiel's mouth tugged into a tight line, he took a step back, holding his hand out he opened his gloved fist slowly. In his palm was a pendant the size of a large grape, flat and mostly clear, oval in shape with something black seemingly pressed into the gold edged glass on a slim gold chain.
The sound of metal on metal echoed heavily through the air. The citizens of Heaven were silent, each creature on baited breath waiting to see who would rule them.
Dean seemed to notice and quickly pulled Sam into a tight hug, holding his brother's head on his shoulder, his other hand rubbing his back to soothe him.
It's simply not how society worked.
"No, and stop examining me, brother dearest," Cas ordered in fake annoyance. "You know I'll remain loyal to Hannah for as long as I can and have to. She's not to blame for dad's slip up back home." He smiled, though it didn't quite reach his eyes. To put it frankly, Cas missed home. New Orleans was great but he missed Salerno, he missed home.
The use of his full angelic name through the angel off, it sounded so formal, so bitter coming from Dean. "Alright." Castiel turned in the doorway, glancing over his shoulder "I'll be in the entertainment room if you need me."
Again
Gabriel wanted to ask, but didn't want to overstep any bounds. He and Sam had become close over this whole ordeal, and were pretty good friends. Sam had seen the Archangel get angry and even cry, but how far was pushing?
The morning went by quickly, tucked under some SUV trying to get an annoying clinking to stop, Dean focused on the blaring radio and less on what Benny and Garth were yammering about.
"See if he is awake. It's rather important."
"Are you trying to make a nest Dean?" It came out as almost a statement versus a question, but Sam was concerned
"Well, if she is the one to make this guy settle, I'll know in time. I mean, if Luc can get dizzy with a dame I'm sure I can." Gabriel smiled as he turned the radio up laughing as the swinging notes of saxophones and the deep voice of some man started through the vehicle.
"Your Highness! Dean!" Charlie sobbed as she clung to the taller Omega
"I can walk on my own you son of a bitch." He growled dropping his filter again. This guys scent was nauseating. Usually the smell of blown out matches and cut wood wasn't a bad smell at all, in fact Dean liked the smell of blown matches. But this guy? Nope.
"I told you Dean. I am not making you call me that. Not even in the company of the strictest Kings must you call me Alpha. I am Michael, nothing more." Michael laughed at the end hoping to lighten the mood as he took his own horse. Ths Crowned Prince mounted and Dean did the same without much word.
"We are nor discussing that right now Crowley. You need to give us answers before a war breaks out after one just ended. We have not even had a year of peace and trouble wants to brew." Michael explained with a sigh as he examined the rather casual demon at the end of his family's dining table
It was a foolproof plan, money laundering without raising any suspicions if there wasn't this one journalist… And now the mine? What if they actually find gold? What if there are diamonds down there? What if they find nothing but get busted anyway? It was too risky and Lucifer simply did not want to let his brothers into his big plan just yet. The one plan that would put them on top. This couldn't end well…
Chuck tilted his head, nervousness lightly lined his scent as he rubbed at his beard
"Than strike me again."
Please check it out it's PHENOMENAL
He had spent a long time washing the blood and dirt from his wings and they now shone and shimmered with pure white, whiter then the anything Dean had seen.
"Dean Winchester is MINE!" His voice thundered as more lightening flashed outside
"Hey-" Dean took a step forward, lifting Castiel's chin so the Alpha had to look up that fraction of an inch to meet the Human's face "Just say what you want to say, and-and give me what you want to give me."
"No. It has nothing to do with that." Michael swallowed as he searched for his words. Starting to regret coming out here without a plan, and only coming out here on instinct.
"I /know/ who you are." Castiel hissed as his angel blade slid into his hand "I suggest you leave. You are not welcome here!"
It was time for him to take matters into his own bloody hands to protect this family. To protect Michael.
"Yes." The Alpha gaurd smile looking down slightly at Dean as the Prince gulped
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"I'm sorry."
"No." Castiel's voice fell deep as he closed his eyes, silent tears slipping down his cheeks "I can't. I can't lose you again D-Dean I can't." When he opened his eyes he looked so lost, in so much pain Dean couldn't help the feeling of sadness that filled his chest. The Hunter knew if he was in this Angel's shoes, he to wouldn't stop until he had found a way.
"Dean I wasn't-"
"We had an issue over eggs this morning." Dean sighed running a hand over his face "Emma suddenly doesn't like ketchup on her eggs and then wouldn't eat the ones I re made for her. Ben claims he doesn't like orange juice anymore but that's all he wanted to drink yesterday." Dean explained setting Ben's bag on a chair "Heya Sammy."
"Regardless let us eat! We've had a long day, Crowley is a guest as is Prince Sam here!"
The Omega held no emotion but anger and hare in his eyes. His scent poisoned with burning rage and sorrow. He pulled the blade from her chest, holding it beside his head as he raosed it up again
Castiel said nothing, but he did blink rapidly, taken aback by Dean's outburst. One step, two steps back away from the hunter, hands still trembling, tears streaked down his scarred cheeks like he'd been slapped in the face
Sam vowed silently that whoever was responsible for doing this to his strong big brother were going to wish they never messed with the Winchesters.
"Hush now you've both said to much!"
Lucifer had searched everywhere.
"So have you." Michael hiccuped as his own tears silently fell
"My elephant." Big round hazel eyes blinked up at Dean "The pink one Uncle Sammy got me for Christmas" she added as if her father didn't know which elephant she was talking about
"Inias go inform Castiel that Lilith has arrived to begin getting measurements for the outfits."
The Alpha seemed to pause at that and in the dim light Dean caught the glint of the demons horns, curved up and to the sides from above his white dead eyes, one of them was much shorter than the other, probably broke. But there was no rustle of leathery wings though, which confused Dean. Didn't all demons have menacing black wings?
This was good. This made the Omega part of him happy. It felt nice, of course the fact that he was in heat, and losing the battle of his self control paid heavily into all of this.
"I'm being serious Gabriel."
Gabriel opened his mouth to try and console his eldest brother when there was a light knock on the door
"I love you to Kelly." He spoke softly, turning to kiss the top of her lovely smelling hair before the light turned green
That was when Castiel noticed the elder Winchester had tears down his cheeks "Dean." Cas reached a hand out, took a half step forward, Dean took a half step back
For the entire month Michael was snappy with the guards, snappy with his brothers, and even snappy with Sam and his Father.
Gabriel sat across from the Demon, his shoulders tense, jaw set, chin up
Dean watched Castiel hurry off, Benny returned moments later.
Dean lifted his chin, set his jaw and tried to act nonchalant as he headed back to his room in silence. The guards said nothing to him, one tried to speak but Dean shot the short young Beta a glare.
His amber eyes scanned the dust cloud and then he noticed blood splattered in the dirt.
"What the fuck." They spoke in unison. Sam moved his hand to the string, it moved through his hand, warm and misty feeling, one thing Sam found weirder than his String being connected to Gabriel, was the second, fainter string that came from his chest and diverted off and out an open window, less red and more pink in color.
He was going to be everything that Lucifer wished he could be and it made the Alpha furious.
"Fuck." He muttered running a hand through his hair successfully messing it up "I've made a damn nest..." Dean rubbed at his scalp a moment, his other hand on his stomach again as a fresh wave of nausea came to him.
Reaching.
"That doesn't answer my question." Dean bite out setting his jaw to glare at his kidnapper "And if you know me you know I won't die without putting up a fight."
Dean didn't even look at Raphael at all but motioned for Michael to come closer. The Alpha did, as Dean reached down, took his face gently in his hands and leaned forward to place a kiss on the Crowned Prince's forehead.
Dean held himself back from leaning into the loving touch and simply nodded.
"I would like to understand then." Dean spoke simply with a lift of his chin throwing away any submissive behavior he may have been displaying out of respect
Gabriel stiffened and his wings twitched before the four of them fluttered slightly and came still folded neatly behind the short Prince's back.
"Damn right it's a hard boiled case. There was one single trial in court with little to no result at all. All it was good for, was to actually have a face to this whole thing, though I'm pretty sure Loki is not his real name. I mean, come on using Norse deities as a cover up is just dingy. The guy's face is all we have right now. We know they live somewhere outside of town and that they own a bar downtown." he summarized while flipping through some coffee-stained notes from half a year ago.
"What? Pfft no!" Dean scoffed tying his robe around him and glancing to the vary obvious nest "Is it obvious?" The older Winchester croaked
Sam's hand rested heavy and warm on Dean's shoulder, the concern from his younger brother met his nose, the smell of pine smelled wet and uncomfortable. Full of sorrow.
"I can whatever I want." Michael muttered raising his eyebrows
"You are too sweet, stop showering me with presents, Luc. I-- we're going dancing?! Have I mentioned that I love you?" she laughed, pressing a kiss to his cheek as the blond drove. "How ever did I deserve you… thank you, Luc. None of this would've been necessary, but thank you." she smiled, resting her hand on his as he was changing gear. "You have no idea how huge a gift you've already given to me."
"Dean, are you really ok?"
"We needed something else heavy!" Castiel's gravel filled voice called from behind the wall made of cotton
"I do not believe anyone gave you permission to speak." The Archangel hissed, the four wine purple wings twitched in irritation
"It's ok Castiel." Gabriel whispered running a hand up and down Castiel's back between his wings
Sam once again opened his mouth to speak when the door burst open, Benny stood with his sword at the ready. Only to freeze in confusion at the sight of the brothers
Raphael pulled his sword and with a raging cry swung at Michael.
"I told you when we met, when we spoke looking over the ocean, I'm an odd Alpha alright?" Michael gave Dean's shoulder a light squeeze, brushed some of the hair back from Dean's forehead, and placed a gentle to kiss to the Omega's forehead.
"No. But my brother almost did, he hit the dog though and now he's got a dog." Dean laughed again, one hand rubbing up and down one of his thighs "Did get in an accident when I was younger with my dad and brother though. We rolled a few times, completely totaled the car."
"Inias, fetch Prince Gabriel and Prince Michael, tell then to meet me in the library. Be sure to inform them it is of the upmost importance."
Dean watched Lydia get Emma in her car and drive off without much more to say.
He felt like a cheating dog.
"He said he could make my life with you very difficult."
"I know. I'm sorry I'm a typical knot head."
Michael watched as Dean was lead off my Charlie and they disappeared into the castle.
He wasn't ready for this.
Michael, Gabriel and Balthazar all looked to their younger brother with shock
Dean finally sniffed and croaked out a muffled
"I-I'm sorry Charlie." Dean picked up the coat and carefully began to fold it "I just. I don't want other scents on the coat..." Dean explained as he finished folding the trenchcoat into a neat square and set it on his vanity. Dean stared at the coat for a moment as he spoke "Do you think you could have someone deliver more pillows to my room? I just need more pillows."
Benny knew this couldn't be a good idea. Especially since the Prince had been through so much, a strange Alpha in his room at night may not be a good thing. But not wanting to cause a problem for the king, the blue eyed Alpha exhaled as he carefully opened the door
"But no dares this time, I'm still mad at you for last time. I'm a hopeless cement mixer on the dance floor." the youngest Novak groaned in amusement.
The warmth coming off the two of them and filling the little cocoon, the feathers seemed to ripple like the night sky's reflection on the ocean below.
Lucifer Novak, known discreetly as 'The Devil' in newspapers, leaned back in his chair. He looked up at his baby brother, the distress in his brother's eyes and seriousness of his voice did not go unnoticed.
Deam blinked as his Father snapped his fingers in front of his face
As he opened his mouth to speak the bedroom door burst open and both Alpha and Omega spun around
"We head home heroes, but none as much a hero as they who died for their people, Long live the Freedom of Heaven!"
"You are though, aren't you?" Sam placed a hand hesitantly on his older brother's shoulders
"Y-yes Alpha." Dean whispered to Michael avoiding Eye contact
Laughter hit Dean's ears making the freckled man look over his shoulder towards the living room.
With a shake of his head Michael sighed, running a hand through his dark hair he looked at his brother's
"As-as you Wish... My King." Lucifer smiled blinking slowly. His breathing sounded wet and labored, making worry spike through Michael.
"Maybe we should give him some space. Afterall he is still adjusting, his family went home yesterday, and wedding planning goes full swing tomorrow and he is expected to make a majority of the decisions." Michael reasoned hoping that it was only the pressure getting to his fiance.
"Do not threaten me Chuck, you cannot threaten war over something so stupid as your own fear. Accept what was said and call off the wedding. I cannot put my son through more heartache. If he loved Michael, or could love Michael I would continue to allow it. But he's expressed that it only hurts more people for them to marry. Do not tear your own children apart. Haven't you done that enough? You allowed Raphael to challenge Michael and agreed to allow them a duel. What father lits their sons against eachother?"
But the words that Raphael spoke were crossing a line.
Nope.
Dean let out a small huff and shook his head letting out a chuckle as he looked down at the tumbling waves
"No. His scent was filling the hall, full of anger and distress and a demon Alpha he was taken." Michael explained as he relaxed slightly under his stiff little brother's hand
From now on he would think of Michael as no one but his future King. Not as a friend, not as anything else that his heart ached for, but only as his King. It's how things needed to be now. Even if it hurt.
"See something you didn't expect Pup?" Abaddon roared in cackled laughter, her black eyes fixed on Michael and then on Dean.
"It's about the Omega Prince. May I come in to speak with you privately?" Gabriel looked up at Lucifer with a steady and serious whiskey gaze, something the Prince rarely had.
Benny nodded and gave the future King a bow not uttering a word as the two Princes headed off towards the castle gates.
Dean closed his eyes when she did and took a deep breath before gently taking her wrists and pulling them away
"My apologies. It was, soothing." He shifted his weight and took a step back
If only the booze would kick in, if only the light feeling of the pills and smoking would settle and make him completely numb!
The people of Heaven were highly impressed with Michael as their ruler. Some had an issue with his truemate being an Alpha, but most respected the Truemates Law. He had also pardoned The Witches, many coming out of hiding to live life's back among the people of their home Kingdoms, and all seemed well.
"I can't tell you." Dean wasn't sure if he said it outloud or not but Castiel's concerned expression softened and a little sad smile tugged at the corners of his lips
"Thank you Prince Balthazar. It is quite the pleasure."
"No need to Apologize. Really I should of announced my presence." She smiled sweetly at Lucifer and the stern Alpha let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding.
_________________________________________________________________
Sam tilted his head at his brother's position and rolled his eyes
Not that there was anything wrong with them... They just rubbed him the wrong way. Raphael especially.
Lucifer put a hand on his shoulder and took a deep breath to hold back his own feelings on the matter. His job was to be Michael's friend, and General, nothing more.
Castiel wasn't a child. He was 18 and yes, the youngest in the family, if he ever took the throne it would only be if everyone in his family died, but he was already a Captain and was very skilled with a blade. He didn't need to be treated like a child!
Suddenly there was silence on the battlefield.
"Yes yes but of course Michael." Crowley spoke with fale sympathy before this certain, knowing, look came over his features "Such a shame your dear brother Raphael. It is to bad that Abaddon wiggled her way into his ear. He had been so loyal to you up until recent years." He stood and followed the maid to where he would be staying without so much as another word.
Heirs.
Afterall his heart ached with such sorrow that surely a siren could sense it miles away and league's deep.
Cas tilted his head, squinting with slight confusion
On the border of Heaven and Hell, outside a small mining village that was no longer thriving as much as it had in the past, as the war had strained many small villages and towns such as this.
"What's your favorite color? It's imperative I know this before you marry my big brother."
"Dean told you?"
Shaking hands found the pill bottle in the nightstand, and took a palm full with another gulp of a new beer, trembling fingers carefully lit another joint and brought, what he wished was relief, to his lips. He used to find relief in these things, something to keep his mind numb of anything other than survival and Dean.
"Sleep well Highness?"
"You won't get that chance." Dean's Castiel ground out before moving quickly to Dean, placing a hand on his shoulder, and disappearing.
He also had a more, private mission, but for that he would need to speak to Heaven's secret and highly unwanted guest the Alpha Demon King Crowley. Who was hidden away in his quarters drinking wine by the fire as he read.
"You could lose the Crown Michael. I know Heaven is strict on Alpha's with Alpha's. It simply isn't done." Dean responded running a hand through his hair, the other resting on his now slightly soft stomach. He still had so many mixed and jumbled emotions about the entire pregnancy thing. He was terrified.
Dean threw his arms up to shield his face with a laugh and an all out food fight broke out among the Princes.
But dreams were for commoners and peasants. Not future Kings. Or so he had been raised.
Dean also remembered the stories his father and mother used to tell about True Mates. Love at first sight, and a scent to drive you mad. Their scent would be perfect it would be home it would be comforting, and no one would smell like that. Ever.
"I promise Sam I will." He grumbled forcing a small smile "I am going to retire to bed now. Do not let Gabriel pull you into trouble. He is notorious for such things."
"You can't stop me. I NEED him!" The dark Castiel as Dean had coined him hissed out, an angel blade slide down from both his sleeves "Don't make me kill you."
"Are you ready Dean?" John asked softly offering Dean his arm, who took it with trembling hands
But of course it was just another thing that he was just to blind to see.
"And if I refuse to do this? Do you even realize what it is you are asking me to do? I refuse to do anything to make Michael uncomfortable. He is to be my husband, I am not some whore for you to use." Dean was still so appalled by the very thought that Chuck would ask him to take advantage of and seduce Michael.
"Sam and Jack have retired for the night. It's only us." Cas added this time holding his hand out again for Dean to take.
The Detective removed his hat so it wouldn't blow away as he drove.
Gabriel turned to Sam and with an apologetic smile simply bowed slightly and spoke
"Oh my dear sweet Omega, there are bigger plans for you."
"Yes. Prince Cas is fine." His lips twitched into a small smile that he didn't think could go away.
Michael threw an arm over his younger and shorter brother's shoulders and led him down the hall
He opened his arms to Dean, making grabby hands at the freckled hunter Dean rolled his eyes, arms crossed over his chest
"It has nothing to do with Dean marrying, nor his kidnapping, though torture is a more accurate word for what he was put through." The human ground out trying to keep his own scent relaxed and neutral enough. How Crowley remained so neutral all the time in his demeanor was a mystery John wished in the moment he knew the secret to.
"You'll pay for that."
Dean was taken aback by this question. It didn't matter did it? There's nothing that could change this arrangement, Michael wasn't that bad either, he and Dean actually got along pretty well.
Dean had nothing against what most called 'His Kind' really he had high respect and only ever treated Omegas well.
"So Castiel, what happened to your car?" Dean finally asked turning from the doorway that his coworkers had occupied and focusing back on Castiel
He never tolerated his brother being treated like a peasant.
Dean stopped mumbling apologies the second Cas took a hand and gently lifted the Winchesters chin to force some eye contact.
"I can't heal him completely. I'm to weak to do that."
His knees ached and his back hurt, he knew what was going on, and the thought terrified the Prince.
"You want me to what?"
"He is not my Prince! I serve one Royalty, the Queen of Hell! Abaddon will  reign! She will crush the kingdoms beneath her heel and rule then with an iron fist! She will bring Chaos and Death to all her adversaries! She. WILL reign." With a deep chuckle he tilted his head, eyes white and unsettling "I enjoy the Omega whore. He's pretty." The demon than spat on Castiel's boot which made the Prince frown, a look came over his face that had Lucifer shift his six large wings nervously.
"I am content." He replied dryly Officially not wanting to dig into the subject of what would be his unchangeable future.
"I'll let the cars be for now until the OK is passed to resume our business." Gabriel brought the Crystal glass to his lips, smiling slyly at Cas with that near-permanent mischievous glint in his eyes.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"But know this, I've already lost one son, don't make me lose you as well." The King spoke with sadness in his tone as he looked at his second oldest son.
"You first Castiel." Smile still gracing Dean's face, Castiel thought he was breath taking, even with the yellow and blues if healing bruises obscuring the usually flawless freckled skin of the Omega Prince
Sam, Dean, and John headed away from the gravesite with the rest of the funeral party, and Royal family.
The way he said it, it unsettled Michael a little.
Castiel opened his mouth to speak, wings raised slightly in anger, hands balled into fists when the doors bursted open to reveal Lucifer.
As much as the smell of the Alpha on the far side of the room seemed, the only smell Dean actually wanted near him was coffee beans and old paper. It was weird, but that's all Dean wanted. But honestly, the longer he stayed here, with Alistair, the less repulsing the Alpha seemed.
The fluttering sound of angel wings was a sound that Dean would never get used to, though his first reaction was to spin around and stab whatever popped up behind him, his second reaction was to smile, turn and greet it, it was hard to tell if the angel appearing behind him was friend or foe.
Sam turned and his face was bright red with an embarrassed blush
Dean needed to process. He fell onto a bench and pushed his feet out as he slouched. He worked on steadying his breathing and rapidly beating heart as he leaned his head back to look at the bright blue sky.
Castiel simply shrugged his shoulders as he plugged the blender in, poured in strawberry koolaid powder and ice
The second he was gone, Little Dean and Mary Ellen exchanged a look, an unspoken conversation passed between the cousins, and then they pounced the adult with a couple of battle cries.
"Go be with Michael and your family. I will take this into my own hands, it shall be dealt with." He gave the worried Prince a reassuring smile and shooed him away.
"We'll take care of Michael in a minute. Right now we want /you/ to be alright."
"Mommy!" Emma cheered running to her mother where she stood parked beside them
Entering his own room Michael closed the door and slid down it into the floor. His wings flopped their pure white feathers onto the marble floor, limp and unmoving as Michael rested his head back on to smooth door.
Raphael scoffed and crossed his arms over his chest before glaring at his father
He couldn't breath, couldn't think, couldn't see past the tears in his eyes. Lucifer looked around wildly unable to hear over the shattering of his heart, the beating of his frantic wings, and the gaspy sobs that tore from his throat in painful heaves.
Castiel didn't say much, but greatly appreciated his older brother more than the other Alpha would ever he able to fathom.
Sam watched curiously when it hit him
Dean watched Castiel leave, lost in thought until the clearing of a throat jolted him.
"Yes?"
Gabriel on the other hand went rigid and stiff, he caught his cup with a sad frown and glanced briefly between his two oldest brothers and then to Sam.
"What did you think I wanted to talk to you about Miss?" Michael crossed his arms raising an eyebrow "I am not here to fire you and send you back to your previous Lord's"
The floppy haired human quickly scrambled off of his brother and hoisted his trembling brother to his feet
I'm very sorry in advance....
"CaAs" Castiel mocked before putting a hand on his hip, the other on the counter "Enough goofing off. Let's see if I've Gabriel-ed myself something tasty. Hold the flashlight Barbie Boy."
"Then wonder no more my King." Lucifer held Michael's chin as their lips met. And everything seemed to alot into place, as their hearts shattered like porcelain.
"Let's move brother! Kali is meeting me in an hour and that's how long it take to get there." The whiskey eyed con man turned and danced his way dow. the stairs, humming some song he'd heard, grabbing their butler and spinning the taller and older man around, all the while laughing at the lack of amusement in the old man's face
True Mates weren't a thing.
"And Gabriel, one more thing..." He said as Gabriel had begun to turn to leave "Don't  ever call me Mikey again. Ever."
"Because he threatened to expose me, it would bring a lot of heat on him, but he'd do anything to prevent Michael from being with another Alpha." Gabriel swallowed thickly
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"Your Highness!?" A maid called and Gabriel beckoned them in as he quickly stood up and shook his wings out
To say Michael was confused was an understatement.
Hell could not be held responsible, Heaven had won and Hell had surrendered.
"Why did someone hurt Dean? Is it because he's not an Alpha or a Beta? Is it because he's getting married to that Michael guy? Dean is the most nicest brother in the world! He reads me stories and sings to me and teaches me stuff. He's nicer and stronger than any dumb Alpha or Beta." Adam was practically sobbing at this point
"Dean. Everyone just calls me Dean. I ain't a Mr anything."
Their wings barely brushed against each others both hiding the shock that hit them at the little gesture.
"Alright Benny. Thank you." Dean stated as he closed the door and prepared to sleep, still feeling sick to his stomach.
"Nuff bumping gums*, as for where to start... These guys got any chicks in their lives? I mean there's gotta be some poor patsy* out there stupid enough to rat out something and give us a lead. Some sort of flapper* with their number or something?" Dean mused tossing the paper on the desk space between his desk and Michael's, a sort of shared space between the two desks.
Castiel's mouth fell open as he stared at Michael in disbelief.
"I'm sorry to have Scared you." Castiel's tone was soft as the Alpha smiled softly at the little human. Wiping his face to try and make it seem as if he hadn't been crying like a baby "It was Adam right?" A smirk came across Castiel's lips "Dean's big brother?"
"You utter bastard." Lucifed sniffed, a few tears slipped down his cheeks and he ignored them, his eyes locked with the conviction of ice in front of him "I told you not to say stuff like that. I told you, and you don't listen you utter dumbass." Lucifer huffed, wings shaking as he contained his emotions to the best of his ability "When I see you at the alter with him. I will wish it were I standing hand in hand with you. That it was I you will hold at night, that I will have your mind, body and soul, not just your heart. I will spend everyday protecting you as I have always done, and protecting your children and even Dean. That won't change. But now you've gone and said some things that change everything."
"His Majesty the King asks for your presence in his study."
Michael tensed a little remembering the threat Dean had told him that Chuck had made. Before Michael could speak Dean had grabbed Michael's knee under the table with a desth grip, making the Prince look at Dean concerned. All Dean did was shake his head
"We wanted to check on you." Sam shifted his weight. He had hit a major growth spurt upon presenting and was already as tall as his brother even though four years younger.
"Is he alright? He was rather angry  when I told him of Dean's disappearance, and then I only made matters worse by treating him like a child." Michael explained as he ran a hand through his hair, his gold crown in his free hand, feathers unkept
Dean was quiet for a moment before he stood on shakey and numb legs, still wrapped in the blanket, he had pants on but his shoulders were bare and covered in bruises where the blanket fell. The Prince wobbled slightly when he walked and approached Castiel before grabbing his coat in his hands and looking down slightly at the shorter Alpha
"Most likely stress." Charlie chimed in, she began to make the Prince's Monstrous bed, the moment though that she picked up Castiel's coat there was a hand on her wrist and a growl.
His mind wandered back to dinner, and the things Raphael had said.
"Gabriel, what is it?"
The sky reflecting on the sea below was breathtaking.
"Your Highness! We are ready to proceed to Heaven as soon as you are mounted."
"Tch, let's get this over with Michael." Raphael sneered as his wings stiffened, hand hovering over the hilt of his sword.
His brother's words hurt.
Soon the gaurd announced his arrival and Dean entered into the parlor. Michael was already there and greeting the demon woman.
His people.
Michael groaned and ran a hand over his face, before looking over his shoulder with a fake glare
"Well when it comes to ladies, You just gotta know how to talk to talk to them and you can get information on anything you want. Because honestly, women are everywhere, at our hips, in our arms, raising our children, buying our groceries, making our meals, ironing our shirts, taking our phone calls. They know everything," Dean noted pulling out of the parking lot with ease
Stopping after descending the stairs he slammed his fist into a wall, a few pictures rattled and a maid yelped where she stood with her laundry basket
Gabriel simply smiled all the more evily
Garth Fitzgerald also held a heavy family oriented attitude, but he was shorter, a string bean squirrelly kind of guy with a long neck and big ears. A soft Midwest voice, and was an open minded kind of man. He was also a hugger, and while Benny thought it was amusing, Dean had mixed feelings about it
Sure enough as Michael made it to the nearest balcony that overlooked the main courtyard the gates had already been opened and down below were horses and Angel's and humans.
The hunter felt the almost familiar pull of grace course through his body, aches and pains gone along with the throbbing in his head. Vision cleared and buzzing gone his eyes focused back on this alternate Castiel. Reasoning was obviously off the table.
"Sit here." He smiled shifting his weight nervously, gripping a throw pillow a little tightly as Michael helped Lucifer be seated gently on the couch, his white wings shifting with nervousness that laced the edges of his scent
"What's wrong Castiel?"
"You sound like him." Michael muttered as he lifted his hand to hide a yawn
"Are you sure Alpha?" He asked a little uncertainty in his eyes, but all else seemed to be purely Dean, Chin high, shoulders back, riding his horse like he was born riding
Michael and Lucifer dismissed themselves to clean up and rest, promising to see everyone at Breakfast the next morning.
Michael retreated back to his room and closed the doors to the balcony. He was taking Dean away from Castiel, this was turning into a giant mess and everyone was powerless to do anything about it.
The Prince watched as the demon struggled in Lucifer's grip, with the white eyes the demon was almost equal to an Archangels strength, almost.
"Michael is a guy that, Dean, was with briefly back in high-school." The burly man muttered as Dean turned to look at them, both Garth and Benny backed up into the garage as if they hadn't been spying in their friend
This felt right for the both of them, there scents tangled in eachother in an odd combination of vanilla and old books, leather and coffee beans.
"No." Michael lied as his gaze hardened "Why do you ask." He stated it rather than ask as he knew where Raphael stood. Raphael was the Alpha Archangel directly below himself. It was no secret he did not agree with Michael ascending to the throne, in fact he made it well known that he should be on the throne instead.
"We will have to discuss something else. Dean is in a delicate state at the moment. I have already declared him as my future husband and mate. Hell and Heaven are currently at peace with the treaty signed at the end of the war. While Crowley was standing King at the signing, it was still a treaty /you/ cannot break. Should you break it." Michael stood and looked Abaddon in her soulless black eyes, Michael's own flickered with angelic grace as his wings lifted to display his superiority "It would be catastrophic for your nation."
"Just leave me alone! Sammy you wouldn't understand! You don't/ get/ it! You wouldn't- you couldn't understand!" He yelled running his hands through his hair.
"That's all they ask." Dean smiled softly as he patted Bobby's shoulder and motioned headed towards the door, walking backwards to smile and wink at Charlie, throwing her some finger guns.
Breakfast went by in a thick blur of near suffocating silence. Nearly the quiet sound of chewing, the small clink of silverware of the occasional scrape of knifes against the glass plates.
All Gabriel did was smile and put a blanket over his older brother with a soft smile. If only Michael and Castiel knew how the other felt about this marriage. Than maybe a new arrangement could be drawn up... With a heavy sigh Gabriel exited the room making it quickly down the many hallways until he reached the quarters where all of the guards slept when not on a night patrol.
"I'm going to need an heir eventually but I'm not doing anything with this slut." She growled before smiling at Alistair "Make sure I am provided with an heir. I have things to attend to."
"Alright." He smiled giving her hand a squeeze with both of his own "I'll see you out there."
Before Dean could fully process the words the other Prince had said he was standing, gripping the blanket around his bruised and cut torso as he came to the angel and gripped him tightly he whimpered out a simple command he prayed the Prince would carry out
"Dean, you worry to much. Let's head inside." Castiel added with a smile tugging lightly at Dean's hand.
"Tonight /will/ be special…" Kelly mumbled quietly, leaning into Lucifer as he drove. The mere thought of having this child with Luce was painting another smile on the dark-haired woman's face.
Assuming that's what was going on, he did still take the route to his room that went past Dean's chambers.
Then his baby brother Castiel, who was in the midst of assisting Dean from his horse.
Michael tried to offer the Omega prince a smile, but it felt strained and more like a grimace. Out of the corner of his eyes though the Archangel noticed Castiel's eyes widen like saucers, and his lips part in shock as he watched Dean walk towards the alter.
Castiel wrapped himself in his robe and with two beats of his wings flew down and landed gracefully on the cool sand.
"Can you not uh-" It was different for Dean, for someone to out loud, call what happened to him. Sure everyone/ knew/ what had happened. But for someone to say it outloud was a lot. Dean put a hand to his chest, the other on his stomach
Castiel swallowed thickly and finally looked at his older brother with guilt in his eyes
"I know what you're thinking. You're thinking right now that I'm going to ask what he'd expose you for, and keep pressing the subject. You're wrong. I want to ask, I want to press, but Gabriel you're my friend, so I won't. You've been family to me the past many months that Dean has been here. You were with me when I was going nuts when Dean was missing, and by my side as I've been here. You don't have to tell me a thing. It's none of my business. You're a great guy, a fantastic Alpha, and one of the best brothers over ever seen. You serve your Kingdom, family, and people well and that is what matters." Sam laid his hand over Gabriel's with a soft smile "Let me help you map your course and pack. You need to be there for your family in the morning."
He deserved someone that would love him, or grow to love him. Not someone who had fallen in love with their little brother.
Michael looked at the Prince with a soft smile.
To Chuck's right on Dean's side of the table sat Michael, then Gabriel, while on the left was Castiel and Balthazar. There was an empty chair on Chuck's right between Michael and Gabriel but Dean thought nothing of it.
"You think I'm ashamed of you? You think that? Is that what I've led you to believe?" John muttered looking at his eldest child with nothing but heartbreak as Dean struggled to keep the tears at bay.
"Get rest little brother." Michael smiled laying Castiel back and covering him with the fur blankets.
"Typical Alpha."
Tensions filled the air between the Alpha and Omega and both refused eye contact for a few moments.
Both young Princes stared and dared not say a word, they both barely breathed as Dean's hands clenched from the fists that were tightly holding Castiel's robe. He smoothed out the wrinkled silk with a look of determination and a blush starting at his ears at how close the two were.
Dean flinched, hands swinging up to protect his face, taking a step backwards was a gasp when a hand suddenly clasped his shoulder.
Dean swallowed hard. This could not be good. This was not going to end well. By the way the Alpha had moved back into his personal space and was to close to his face, the way that nasally voice seemed to relish in how it grated on his ears, or the way the Demon smiled with a light flash if fangs and a flare of nostrils. He could smell Dean's fear, he had been keeping his face calm and his scent betrayed him.
"Try."
Dean cracked a smile before Bobby slapped him in the back of the head, "Michael, this is Dean. Dean, this is Michael, one of the best we got, so behave."
"Alrigth Cassie! Grab your hat and coat wr are going dancing!"
The young Alpha nearly collided with a maid as his boots slipped along the marble floor as he turned the corner.
"Get to the point Michael!" Lucifer finally blurted out, his voice coming out full of exasperation, or was it desperation? Michael didn't know
Castiel held onto his horses reigns and watched as Dean was swiftly taken inside. His heart pounded as the urge to run to the Omega, to hold him close, pet his head, kiss his hair, and keep him away from the world roared through his body.
Lucifer stalked down the hallway wit tears in his eyes and a set stiffness to his shoulders.
"Please Madame Lilith, a bit if warning first." The Prince rubbed the back of his neck with a nervous chuckle to which Lilith gave him that fake blood red smile and turned to Dean.
Lucifer was right, though, Cas wasn't getting much sleep as of late, though he wasn't entirely sure why.
It seemed so cold now, and granted it had been cold for a while, but, it was near freezing without Dean.
Dean squinted as he let his eyes slowly adjust to the light.
Dean shrunk back slightly and looked down at his hands not sure how to answer that.
"Yeah, when I'm sweating do to working on a car, or, y'know... Other stuff. Not when I'm trying to be comfortable in my own damn apartment!" The Winchester whined even going as far as stomping his foot like a toddler.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"I am aware but still... I've never been so far from you all before... Let alone a weeks travel away." He sighed and rubbed the back of his neck "It's a bit nerve wracking."
"I Don't fear anything John Winchester, but you ought to know when to hold your tongue! The right for a duel for the throne is in the law! As for the wedding they can both get over it!"
Like really hot.
His father stood before him, dressed in Earth's most regal and looking like an Alpha King should.
Gabriel gave a devious smirk and folded his four golden wings closer to his body revealing Sam and Adam
"I will see what I can do. But I cannot promise anything." Dean finally said his eyes flicking up to meet Chuck's, his head mot raising from it's lowered position.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"But I'm not." Dean swallowed thickly, emerald eyes flicking up to gaze into almost familiar blue, but they swirled with electrically flickering grace, full of rage, sorrow and power
"I'm not afraid Dean. I've been to war, I just got back from one. Nothing scares me."
"Very well Dean, here we are." He glanced over his shoulder tucking his wings a little closer as he opened the tall, wide door.
"That's fine. So he was comfortable and taken care of?" Michael's wings twitched as he became nervous to meet his future husband
Charlie smiled widely and grabbed Michael's hand in both of her shaking it almost violently
"Gabriel, go find Dean and ensure he is safe. Balthazar, get someone to investigate her claim of Crowley's death and the throne of Hell. Castiel, find Lucifer. I want her removed from my Kingdom post hast!"
"One at least does. That's the trip I'm going on after the funeral tomorrow. My father may have had them hunted down and executed but I have on good authority one still lives. Off on an island a days journey from the Capital. From here."
"Not as dashing as you buttercup." He chuckled returning her kiss and offering her his arm
Dean blinked at his brother and a tear rolled down his cheek as he parted his lips to speak, but nothing came out.
"But anyway, how was your week, love?" she asked, her light blue eyes blinking up at Lucifer's amber ones.
Castiel stood, taking one step towards Dean before the front door burst open, blasting off its hinges windows shattered. Standing in the doorway was Dean's Cas. Eyes ablaze with the wrath of God, angel blade at the ready. The sillhoute of his wings stretched proudly behind him as his eyes glowed, halo mixing with the flashing lightening behind him.
"You are not my Master. You will never be my Alpha. S-so get out bitch." He snapped staring into eyes darker black than any demon he had ever met. Her fiery red hair was tied up in a bun and she wore a tight long sleeved floor length silky black dress, her nails long and nicely manicured, horns were small but came out slightly from above her eyes on her forehead.
Dean Winchester, the eldest of the Princes of Earth, well built, attractive, and kind.
The young 15 year old Alpha looked at Gabriel with a raised eyebrow, yes the older Alpha of 24 was short, but he was also an Archangel afterall.
"You have a pillow."
The Queen never responded as Chuck swept them away to eat.
"If you want Samoose, you can head to your room and change. I'll meet you at breakfast." The blonde smiled over his shoulder
When the demon tried to pull his hand away Dean bit down harder and shook his head around like a dog with a tennis ball.
"What guy?" Sam called down reaching into the crater to help haul the battered Cas out of it
What felt like hours later, Dean was standing in front of a full length mirror, white suit trimmed with silver and lace. It clawed up his throat and along the shoulders of his suit. As traditionally Omega as he allowed them to go without wearing a full on gown.
Castiel pulled the blankets around himself, pulled his knees up, resting his cheek on them as more tears fell. He was surprised he could even still cry.
Lucifer was pulled from his thoughts by the sound of wings and the crunch of the stone walkway.
"How do I ask this of you?" The King grumbled before he finally exhaled "I need you to seduce Michael."
An idea struck him, a place that perhaps His beautiful Dean would be. The bunker in Kansas. Of course Dean would be there, probably with Sam, if he was alive, and anyone else that they valued.
Chuck left his children alone. He considered heading to his room as was the original plan. But something else came to mind.
"Don't fret baby bro, I'm the sibling therapist for some odd and dumb reason, and I don't take it lightly." Gabe smiled a kind smile as he tried to tame Castiel's insane hair "I've got a few things rolling around up here," he tapped his temple with a smirk "One of em is bound to help you out. For now head down for food and I will join you shortly. I need to speak with father about something."
Sam raised and eyebrow letting go of Gabriel's swollen knuckles, one hand going to his hip as the other tucked hair behind his ear
The Alpha headed to a window and climbed out, flying up to a small ledge on the backside of the castle above his room, he used to come here all the time to clear his head, it looked over a portion of the sea and was a sheer drop below into the bellowing depths. Lucifer was not, however expecting to see Michael already sitting on the wide ledge, his thin gold crown in his hand instead of atop his dark hair.
Trophies.
"Because Castiel is in love with Dean, and Dean is in love with Castiel."
"Not what you are thinking. It's shattered glass and splintered wood mostly." Michael explained his wings readjusted behind his back as he looked at the funny little Beta
"He'll be alright." Gabriel smiled patting Michael's arm "Wanna come in my room? I have hot coco and donuts..." Gabriel smiled up at his older brother
Mama Moose.
"Don't ever speak his name like that again!" Gabriel shouted as he stood up. The short Alpha had tears in his eyes and his wings rose in aggression
"Go. I'll be along later" to Gabriel.
But there was nothing.
Instead he chose a safer route
"I know. Trust me, I know."
Gabriel leaned against the wall, empty glass in one hand, the other still buried in the pocket of his slacks. "Nice change of subject." Gabe laughed "Well, the garages are fun. I get cars from all kinds of places and to all kinds of people. As for music, jazz is in. You'll have to deal with it" Gabriel pushed off the mantel, setting his glass down, hands up as he did some funny shuffle and spin "Maybe learn some swing." He spun around and pointed at Castiel "The ladies dig a cool cat with a swing."
The maiden shook her head
So naturally she allowed the forces of Heaven to camp in the fields of Purgatory.
"Cassie, Castiel." He dropped the nickname to put emphasis on the importance of his next words "The Smith Scandal will blow over. Promise we won't get caught or whatever. Just, balance out the books and get some shut-eye. You ain't been sleeping much."
"Alistair, I thought I had heard you had returned." The click clack of the woman's shoes echoed in the room before stopping in front of Dean. "He is a pretty one for sure." Dean flinched as cold delicate fingers combed through his hair, only to slide down his cheek and lift his chin "He smells simply Devine." She purred so close to his face, he wished he could see what monster was touching him with long manicured nails.
Deam sat beside his Father at one end of the table as King Chuck sat at the other head of the table.
Without regard for what he could maybe be barging in on he burst through the door to Dean's rooms and began searching for him. The fireplace had been lit hours ago but was starting to fade, his clothes from this morning were draped over a chair and ready for the maids to take, along with the towels from his bath, his dinner was set on the small table by the fire. Cold and untouched.
Upon the party entering the inn and dispersing to dinner and their several rooms, of which Lucifer insisted he gaurd Castiel. As the boy was one of the Prince's and a good friend, Cas looked at Lucifer with a deadpanned expression
"Struggles of the heart young King."
"I agree to this crowning." Eve spoke as her gaurds parted their ring around her to show the woman. Hardly a dark hair out of place from the commotion
Dean rolled his eyes as they seemed to glow slightly, giving Charlie a side look
"Hey Dean."
Dean couldn't hide the little chuckle that escaped him as he drove.
"I'll join you in a few minutes. I promised Sam I would look to see if we had blessed goats blood for the case, before heading to bed, then we can discuss this other issue."
Dean blinked a few times, his eyes watering but he couldn't let Michael see. He had already seen him so vulnerable he couldn't cry in front of the Archangel again.
"If I could. I would set my crown down and leave. I would steal the stars from the sky, and ths moonlight from the sea for you. I know, it isn't normal to feel this way but-"
"Again with Gabriel having it under control! What does that even mean? And why Does both Charlie and Father know but not me?" Dean groaned crossing his arms over his chest as his mother sat on the edge of his bed. He ignored the way he wanted to shoo her off the bed and fix the now scooted over extra pillow. She was disrupting his near perfect nest and it was irritating.
There was a grating sound, like a chair against a stone floor, it stopped in front of Dean and his nostrils were attacked with the overpowering smell of burning coals and ash.
"You willyou will do as I say or I can make your stay here very, challenging."
"I'm sorry." Dean whispered as he watched Castiel's fingers slip from his hands "I'm so sorry."
Michael bolted out the side doors towards the stables, Lucifer was grumbling and petting his horse's nose as Michael hurried up to him. The Crowned Prince stopped, put his hands on his knees and tried to catch his breath
"I don't know, she might come over, who knows. That woman's busier than her dad..." he half-joked, half groaned.
"Oh Sammy, just call the dear thing Jessica, that is how she insists we address her Afterall." Dean chuckled and to him this was good. This felt good. It felt right, he needed just time with his family.
This peaked Crowley's attention, the Demon King turned, red eyes fixing on the Archangel, seemingly examining the Prince before he took a couple of steps forward
Lucifer looked up at the star dotted sky with a frown. He knew this day had been coming, when Michael would marry...
Sam of course laughed as they entered the library that Gabriel had shown the Alpha human.
Speaking of Lucifer had lectured a few other guards about the way they had been talking about the Prince. He knew Michael wouldn't appreciate the constant talk about the Prince's Omega ass.
Adam watched Michael's face with extreme scrutiny before smiling and nodding
Chuck entered and gave Dean a respectful bow
"She went into labor! That's amazing! And about damn time. No offense to Eileen but she was huge y'know?" He laughed and then groaned an 'ouch' when Cas slapped his shoulder
"Wha-oh." Dean looked down at his Ninja Turtle mug, complete rejection on his face
Michael had pardoned the Witch of her Banishment, and all seemed to be going well.
"Dean, you're like no one I've met before. To hear you ask to be told what to do about yourself breaks my heart. You're a free bright soul, own it and let no man, Alpha or otherwise tell you how to run your life and what to do with your body."
The door opened and King John looked up from the letters and papers littering his deck.
His six, pink and blood red wings flapped hard in anger and then spread out fully. Slamming things off of the table and knocking a chair over, hands bawled into fists, knuckles white as his blunt and short nails dug into his palms. The dull sting didn't bother him as the Archangel let out a roar of raw emotion and sorrow, as he slammed his fist into the mirror.
The Archangel dropped his sword and fell to his knees from a mixture of sorrow and exhaustion. Reaching forward he closed Raphael's eyes and pulled his brother's bloody body into his arms.
A laugh erupted from Dean's chest as he laid back, holding his stomach "Don't worry! I didn't tell her she was some weird gift from her big brother that happens to be fucking God now so she wasn’t exactly born!"
Gabriel lifted a hand making the other angel halt
It wasn't long before Dean had packed a couple of trunks with nearly all.of his belongings.
Michael entered the the castle through the servants entrance. He tried to shake off as much water from his wings as he could, but with six drenched wings it was rather hard.
"Your brother will be alright." Michael tried to comfort the human, wings twitching not knowing how, it was a lot of information to take in "He's strong. I'm sure it's ok."
Claire was standing gaurd outside of Dean's door. The small blonde Earth Human opened her mouth to say something but stopped, snapping her jaw shut. The only indication of the pressing questions in her mind was the subtle twitch of her nose as she obviously had observed Castiel's scent mingled with his own coming off of him.
Dean was very very surprised when they crossed the border without incident, and when they went through the city without a problem.
Opening his mouth to say something Sam decided it against it, mouth clicking shut and eyes falling to the table when Michael finally looked up at the boy
Chest heaving as his eyes glowing white with rage and grace scanned the parking lot for any sign of Dean, the angel, that beautiful car, something!
A small smile slipped onto Michael's lips
Both princes snapped their mouths shut and stared at eachother.
Dean pulled one of the Angels dark wings back with a crack
"Those things don't define you Gabriel. Look at Dean. He's an Omega but he likes and acts like everything people say Omega's shouldn't be and he's still an Omega. Honestly there need to be more gentle Alphas."
The room stood silent, the only movement was the shuffle of wings, or the twitch of a nose through the thick scent of anger that filled the dining room.
Gabriel chewed his bottom lip avoiding Sam's confused and worried gaze
The scent that greeted him was not one of an Omega in heat, it was the smell of burning coals, ash, and angered Alpha, the vanilla and leather scent of Dean and distress, mixed with something Michael couldn't exactly place, was still lingering in the hall and it sent Michael on edge.
"I need to get a search party out immediately. Father needs to be informed, and I just-" Michael looked up as Gabriel's hand rested on his shoulder
Michael spun around and smiled slightly at Lucifer before it slipped into a frown
They both exchanged and smile and then quickly looked away.
"It is settled then!" The Minister announced as Michael practically fell to one knee, the crown of a Prince removed from his now messed up hair, to be replaced wjth the Crown of a King." Michael stood, turned to the crowd, all of his blood splattered white wings spread out as nearly everyone applauded. Though Michael still shed a few silent tears.
Castiel reached forward, placed two fingers on the other angel, some of the bigger injuries closed a little
"Let's move." He growled as he mounted his steed and without more than a whistle to his men and a kick to his horse he was galloping off out of the village.
"It'll be Fine Sam." Gabriel patted Sam's shoulder, giving it a light squeeze "I've got back up, I will be back as soon as I can, hopefully before the ceremony. The Witch will be there, I'm sure of it." As the Alpha spoke he turned his gaze to the horizon. The dark water rolling under the moonlight
Dean's body relaxed as his shaking hands came to wrap around his brother's waist and pull him closer, his nose buried in his taller little brother's neck as he breathed in deeply, the sharp scent of pine and leather mixed with fear and relief came in familiar waves as Dean found comfort in Sam's familial scent.
"Alright both of you, I'm off to see what Father needs and we will meet you in the dining room for breakfast."
Lucifer bit the inside of his cheek. He knew what he wanted, what he wanted would be married soon.
Eventually Dean finally decided to get off the bench and go for a nice walk. Afterall there was a certain Prince he needed to get off his mind. He had a wedding to plan afterall...
"It's stupid. It's so fucking stupid!" Dean slammed his fist into the seat beside him as he turned away from the back window and looked to his father "Why can't any of us be happy? Why are we cursed with such pain? It makes no sense!" His green eyes started wide and wet at his father, his arms instinctively wrapping around his middle "Why do such horrid things happen to people that are just trying to do right for the world?" His final question came out so quietly that Sam and John had to lean forward to catch it all over the thundering rain
