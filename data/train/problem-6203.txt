“You’re not straight?!” Tony shouted over what Steve was trying to say and he sounded angry, no, he sounded completely furious.
He spluttered and coughed and Steve almost left him to choke but thought better of it and smacked at Sam’s back, with more force than necessary.
Spending time with Tony had always been the highlight of his day and the thought of not being able to be there for one of Tony’s mad spiel rant on some AI he was working on, and not having the constant chatter and energy with him while he ate his lunch or was working on one of his art assignments sat heavily on his heart.
He remembered the embarrassing idiotic things he had blurted out to him, even though he knew full well Erik had been in the nearby vicinity. He might as well have just told tony he was in love with him he had been so obvious, Tony’s hurt angry face popped up in his head.
"Does this mean I can stop acting like I don't know about Charles and Erik's relationship?" Bruce asked the room.
He had then decided to let off a little steam along with his frustrations by jerking off. Why not, he was a perfectly healthy man in his twenties and his dick was very on board with the idea.
After running for a while, Steve mind cleared a little from the shocked hurt as he evaluated the situation.
“Shhh” his mouth was covered with Tony’s hand, “Just- you don’t have to do this you know” he ran his other hand over his hair frustratedly, making it endearingly messy. With Tony’s hand on his mouth, Steve couldn’t ask what 'this' was. “It’s not even-” he was cut off by a loud cheer from their friends, they both glanced at them, Jane was doing a freakishly flexible pose with her limbs twisting and crossing with Natasha and Clint was complaining loudly while getting himself up from the floor, apparently the cheer was because of his fall.
He didn’t even realise he was staring and tuning out his friends’ conversation and had to valiantly fight off another blush when one of them (probably Bucky) kicked him under the table.
Steve was weirdly nervous about talking to Tony after a few days of radio silence, he was immensely relieved when Tony spotted them and exclaimed “Steve!” like he was exactly the person he wanted to see.
He looked at Tony, who was silently laughing at Clint’s reaction, his shoulders shaking with his face scrunched up in pure happiness.
“Holy fuck! How are you still sitting up?” Tony sounded impressed and Steve preened and shrugged. Tony should always be impressed with him and give him all of his attention.
“Well, I guess I did that anyway, in the most shitty way possible and I’m sorry. You don’t have to feel obligated to do anything or feel sorry for me. I’m a fucking idiot and this is all my fault-”
"You shut up" Tony pointed at Loki, "This is your fault anyway. You made Steve drink your potion of doom!" his tone was gleeful instead of angry.
He had never really dated anyone after that, he went out with Billie, a girl from her Art history class on a date once in his first year, Natasha’s matchmaking was relentless when she thought you needed a date.
“Slow down, you idiot. You’ll make yourself sick” Bucky admonished with a sigh but he was already sipping his first beer too albeit a lot slower than him, Steve decided his advice was stupid and ignored it.
The plush lips that he had a habit of biting raw and red while he was deep in the zone of his engineering work to the little smattering of freckles on his nose and cheek that one can see only if you stand close enough and paid attention.
The next day was a Sunday and Steve couldn’t find time to meet Tony, Phil was unavailable and Steve had been put in charge of the restaurant for the whole day and he hardly had time for breaks. he couldn’t even go to the party Janet Van Dyne threw that night because he had an urgent assignment to submit.
It was sweet and taste a bit like wine but also not, it tasted kind of thick which didn’t make any sense.
Tony was his usual cheerful self, sending Steve random memes anytime he felt like (Steve felt an unreasonably vicious amount of pleasure at that just because it means Tony was still thinking of him from time to time).
“Was that a multiple-choice answer where I have to pick one?” Tony looked very amused and Steve decided he liked amused Tony very much. He liked all of Tony’s moods, even when he was angry, he was like a firecracker, beautiful, passionate and infuriating.
Then the meaning of what Tony just said finally caught up to Steve and it felt like a punch to his gut, a very unfair and painful punch that left him breathless.
ask you, I mean I guess it makes sense? Because then I would be sure, I just- well- um so yeah I like you and wanted to ask if you’d like to go on a date with me?”
Steve grinned, he could hardly wait for breakfast to be over so they could rush back to Tony's apartment. But he also savored the warm feeling of having everyone at one place, content and happy.
“Tony” He gasped out half in reverence and pain. Tony was staring at him silently, assessing him with concerned eyes.
He knew Tony was one of the most beautiful person he had ever met, from the lush brown curls that usually go everywhere if Tony ran his hand through it enough times, to the expressive clear brown eyes that’d would light up and sparkle mischievously and turned amber under the sunlight.
Bucky punched his arm lightly, “You just agreed to have an arm wrestling match with Logan” he whispered. He knew Steve too well and wasn’t fooled by the way Steve was trying very hard not to look confused at what exactly he just got himself into.
Steve turned towards the intruder with an annoyed wince, it was Clint. He was speechlessly gesturing at them on the floor, mouth opening and closing silently and then back at Natasha who was standing calmly behind him.
“I thought I was straight when you asked me out-” Tony snorted in disbelief, “No, I promise you Tony. I genuinely didn’t know I liked guys as well, I never thought about it. It was actually because of you that I started to realise I wasn’t quite as straight as I thought I was”
Tony had been dating him for close to two months now, he was apparently very serious and in love with Lehnsherr. Steve had mostly been fine with it, as fine as he could be while being completely jealous, hurt and trying to hide his obvious feelings for Tony.
Steve couldn’t see the guy’s expression but Tony looked like he was trying to communicate something without actually saying it. Pepper was busy choking on her orange juice while the others gawked at the two.
Lehnsherr had stood behind Tony, hugging him from the back while he worked, brushing aside his hair, kissing his cheeks, calling him 'babe' all the time even if all he got was an irritated huff from Tony.
Steve was absolutely behind that idea because even though they weren’t close at the time and he wasn’t there for it, he knew it was bad, but Tony had been improving a lot in communicating what he wanted and even his feelings.
“I am!” He replied even though she wasn’t talking to him, she raised one eyebrow at him (seriously, how can everybody else do that!). “I feel great!” he declared with a wide smile.
“Loki must be so smug right now, where is he? I want to know if he changed the formula. Bruciebear! Erik, where’s Charles?” Tony started to get up and that was so not okay, Tony should not be going anywhere else especially with that shark Erik, completely unacceptable.
Things had been quite normal for a few days after Tony’s announcement in the cafeteria, Pepper had told the others that Erik and Tony had been messing around for a few days and had apparently decided to be in a relationship the night of Janet’s party. (Steve had been so close it hurts).
me Rogers! What is wrong with you?” He got up and okay Steve was officially very confused and distressed now.
“Oh stop interrogating the poor boy” Janet chimed in and Steve glanced around the room. Clint was sniggering while Sam was taking a video. The others all looked amused including Logan who was perpetually grumpy.
Bucky groaned, “Stevie, you had a crush the size of a freaking continent on Adam Jefferson in high school before you moved on to Peggy Carter”
He then thought about other beautiful people who had intrigued his artistic side, there was Peggy of course because she was an absolute beauty, and Bernie who he had a little crush on, she always looked ethereal in her glassblowing workshop in high school. And Emily, a theater student who played the most compelling character of Shakespeare’s Portia.
That was the extent of exposure Steve got of same sex relationship. It was in high school that he realised that there were also people who liked both after he met Carol, he took all that in stride and was never bothered by it.
Steve was too focused on the pain that he didn’t even hear the footsteps that approached him. He jerked when he felt a hand on his shoulder, he opened his eyes and inhaled sharply. Tony was there, he didn’t leave, he came back. Everything was tumbling around in his head, overwhelming him.
They broke up right before he started college, Peggy was a fierce girl who always knew what she wanted, she had her whole career and life planned out and she really didn’t see herself settling down, so they had broken it off amicably.
It seemed very important that they know. It was unacceptable to think they might not be aware of how much Steve loved them.
He still had two more classes to attend but he didn’t feel like going, his professors would understand, he never miss classes unless he absolutely had to.
“What?! You drank Loki’s potion of doom and you’re coherent?!” Tony turned to him with horrified eyes.
Then, he had planned to tell Tony in the morning, meeting him with his usual cup of coffee just like Tony had done before with his confession.
Thor and Loki were brothers from New Asgardia in Norway and their family were royalty or some big shot like that. They were still acclimating and talked as if they were in a Shakespearean drama although they were so much easier to understand now compared to their first year.
“Hey, it’s okay. I’m happy too, so fucking happy I might just spontaneously burst into a song with dancing wild animals and throw flower petals all around the room like a fucking Disney princess”
Steve gasped, horrified. How did she know? Did Bucky tell her? He glanced at Bucky whose eyes were wide and looked a little scared.
Tony, clearly picking up on his distress because he knew Steve too well to not see through him, snorted a little. It made Steve relax a little too, because if Tony was still laughing at his awkwardness then maybe it wasn’t too bad?
“Natasha! What did I tell you about sneaking up on me?” he exclaimed, mortified that he was so blatantly wearing his heart on his sleeves.
As he mindlessly sketched what should be his little Brooklyn neighbourhood back home he thought about how he had never actually questioned his sexuality.
But Steve was miserable, Tony had been hanging out with Erik’s friends more and more, sometimes even sitting with them during lunch. He hardly had time for them anymore and Steve felt neglected and despondent. He knew Tony always gave his all when something held his interest, and apparently that include relationships.
Steve jumped at the sudden noise and was rudely startled out of his musings. Bucky was banging on his room door with “Stevieeeee!!”
He sighed again and turned to Sam who was looking at him expectantly, “I think I might be bisexual” he blurted out.
And that was what hurts the most, the fact that he had built himself up to be more than those people in his head and had allowed himself to hope for something more. And now that he had realised his feelings for Tony which was so much more than just a fleeting fancy and closer to being terrifyingly in love than he had ever been, just to find out Tony had moved on and even had a boyfriend. An attractive, smart, charming boyfriend.
Before Bucky could come up with any response Sam said, “You know it’s completely fine if you are or aren’t bisexual Steve. None of us are gonna look at you any different. It would be completely hypocritical for most of us too”
He didn’t go to hang out with Tony in his lab after that, he had no right to feel angry about Tony and his boyfriend doing couple things in Tony’s private space.
“But you spent so much time with him. You barely had time for us anymore and you looked so happy” his tone was petulant, still incredibly jealous over that fact.
Steve couldn’t breathe, he had told only Bucky about his plans after he finally snapped and told Steve to
Tony had been fine, almost nonchalant about it too and he didn’t look affected much when he left. But Steve, if possible, was still reeling with the new information.
Steve’s heart thumped merrily in his chest, so happy that Tony was not ignoring him, beckoning him and patting the chair next to him (Steve’s usual seat).
“Oh and Stark’s waiting for you in the kitchen-” Steve promptly choked on his mouthful “-and he does
Steve just hadn’t wanted to consider the possibility that he was just the same as the various people Tony hooked up with, he had always known Tony was attracted to nice shiny things and was just easily distracted and often lose his interest just as quickly too, he had thought he was a little more special than that and had hoped Tony won’t move on so immediately.
That was dangerous territory and Steve was not supposed to be doing an analysis of his friendship with Tony just because of this and cheapen it to some plan concocted by Tony to get into his pants.
They had fights about things they never argue about when they were friends but it was still the best relationship Steve had ever had with anyone.
Steve had tried to protest about playing the game but was quickly overruled by everyone. By the looks Nat and Clint exchanged and the way Bruce grinned to himself, he had the slight suspicion that this was not as spontaneous as it seemed. He glanced over at Tony who was sitting right across from him, and supressed a sigh, instead looking down on his pieces of paper trying to think of something to write.
The rest of the day was spent with the usual bickering, laughing and joking around and most importantly playing with the puppy. Thor had his new blanket wrapped around his shoulders the whole day and refused to take it off under any circumstances.
“I locked you in.” Now it was the super soldier’s turn to look confused, as he turned around to Bruce.
Natasha smiled softly at the picture. They looked warm, comfortable and content. She looked at Bruce next to her who seemed a little nervous. She knew that he hated confined spaces, always afraid that something would trigger the Hulk and in a small space like this he could do a lot of damage.
Watching Tony sleep like this now, so peaceful and calm, made Steve feel- he didn’t know what it made him feel. But it was good.
Apparently, the others had also waited for some sort of signal from Steve. Thor, now abandoning his hairdresser, began to explain how they decorated the tree and Clint started putting Christmas decorations all over Tony, including ornaments around his ears.
“Hey, I’m all with you, why do you think I gave you this? But he was brainwashed for decades and might still not be himself.”
The other man’s eyes darted from his task of chopping up onions for a salsa up to Steve’s face. The moment they locked eyes, Steve knew that this was it.
Steve shook his head. What was he supposed to do with that information? If Tony indeed knew about Steve’s feelings for him, then the lack of action on Tony’s side said all he needed to know. If Tony knew, he evidently didn’t feel the same.
A normal day with the Avengers was bizarre, but today had been just a whole other level of weird. And Tony had seen his fair share of bizarre in his time.
Everything about this place screamed “temporary hide-out” to Steve and he would be surprised not to find a ready packed bag somewhere.
With a slight frown, Steve turned to Tony. “How come you never give me any jewellery?” He asked in mock hurt.
Tony turned to his side, tugging an arm under his head. “Now the question is: what do we do about this whole mess?”
Tony fixed his eyes on the other man and almost let something slip. Something along the lines of: “Give me thirty minutes alone with you and I show you what kind of feelings I have,” or “How about you put some feeling in me.” But he kept his mouth shut for once and just looked down at his drink.
All Tony could do was nod. Such blue eyes. So calming. And Tony could have lost himself in them if it weren’t for Hammer getting to his feet, shoving blonde guy aside, or at least trying to.
The others nodded in agreement. “This is our family. We found it all on our own. It’s little, and broken, but still good. Yeah, still good.” Nat whispered in his ear. She knew he loved Disney movies and he especially loved “Lilo and Stitch”, for obvious reasons.
“I think you need to dial it down Steve. We’re on your side and we’re just trying to help.” Bruce spoke up. Tony was one of the closest friends he ever had and witnessing him being spoken to like that made him… angry.
“Flirting, for a start. And shoving him against a wall and shouting at him doesn’t count. Although I bet, he enjoyed at least one part of that.”
“Battle plan: Everyone will change into their best garments and we will meet here in 10 minutes to acquire more food!”
Thor looked around, trying to figure out who made this incredible piece of work and Natasha winked at him. He almost fell over some of the other presents on his way over to Nat to pull her into a bear hug. “Thank you!”
The soft rocking of the waves combined with the lack of sleep on Tony’s side and Thor’s emotional exhaustion, made them both fall asleep next to each other on the big bed. At some point during their nap, they must’ve reached out for each other and so when Tony woke up, he had Thor’s arms wrapped tightly around him, imprisoning Tony in a giant bear hug. To be fair it wasn’t the worst or even the weirdest thing Tony had woken up to but holding hands with the Norse God of Thunder definitely made it into his top ten list.
“Sprained wrist, bruised knuckles and some pretty deep cuts that need stitching. Did he deserve it?” Strange asked, looking Tony in the eyes for the first time since he entered the room. Suddenly at a loss for words, Tony just nodded but Strange seemed to understand.
Tony was sitting in his comfy armchair in the back of the shop when he heard the bell above the front door ring out.
“Hey Mr. Stark!” After almost two years, Peter still refused to call Tony by his first name and by now he had stopped trying to convince the kid.
“Okay that’s fine Steve” Sam said neutrally without any hint of judgement in his tone and Steve felt relief coursing through him. But he still had a question.
He then had planned to tell Tony first thing in the morning which also didn’t work out. Steve was frustrated now, how hard was it to get Tony alone to tell him about his feelings (extremely hard apparently).
“Loki gave him a special wine of some sorts” Rhodey answered for him as he passed a bottle of beer to Tony.
Lehnsherr though, was still smiling his shark smile, not even wavering under the weight of all their stares.
He had also decided to not tell Tony yet about his possible bisexuality. He didn’t want to give Tony hope just for it to be crushed if he was just exploring and realised he was in fact straight after all. He didn’t want Tony to be some experiment, he could never hurt him like that.
“So what are you doing here?” he said rudely, without any preamble pointing his plastic spoon at Lehnsherr.
Tony would text him when he was ready and Steve was determined to give him the space he had asked for. He finally fell into a fitful sleep after a few more minutes of brooding.
He disappeared into the throng of people in the house and Steve decided it was high time he looked for his friends. He was feeling great, better than he had felt in weeks and he wanted to be with his friends he loved so much.
Steve had went to their study meeting once before Peter joined because he was curious and never went again, nothing made sense and Tony spent half the time arguing with Loki and then Reed, Steve didn’t even get a word in the whole two hours.
Steve took a calming breath and averted his eyes from the soul searching brown ones, he was about to lay out all his cards in the open and it was terrifying.
Tony stole his fries like he always did without even looking at him, he was still talking to Clint, acting completely normal as if the last five days didn’t happen at all.
“Arrghh!” Tony slammed his mug down in frustration “I’m leaving” he said and stomped towards Steve who was still standing next to the door.
“I had it all planned out, I was gonna- well, it doesn’t matter anymore because I was too late and you were already with Erik, clearly over your crush on me”
Clint crowed in delight and started tapping happily away on his phone while Bucky face-palmed and groaned into his hands. Steve blinked and Tony was slapping his back excitedly (the contact tingled).
But no one gave them grief about it, they were the nicest couple too and Steve and Bucky still sing praises about their homemade cakes every chance they get.
Thor’s house party was, as always, wild and chaotic. It was already in full swing with music blaring when Steve and Bucky arrived. Thor greeted them with a booming laugh and a crushing hug, he immediately showed them to the kitchen where the drinks were kept. Steve didn’t waste any time, he picked his favourite brand of beer and started chugging.
Thor had come in once to check on Steve and told everyone it was just a different kind of alcohol that Loki was experimenting on and won’t do any harm to Steve. Bucky had been very relieved to hear that and he let his tightly coiled posture loose after that.
He found them all lounging in Thor’s game room/home gym away from the general crowd, Thor’s family were even more loaded than Tony’s and their house was honestly something college students shouldn’t be able to rent, let alone buy.
he thought morosely to himself and groaned. This was going nowhere. He didn’t even try to start on his art projects because he was never going to do a good job with his head like this.
Speaking of Tony, he still hadn’t texted or called Steve at all, not once during the weekend and this was a record for them, the longest time they’ve gone without seeing or talking to each other even if they were fighting.
He felt Bucky’s hand on his knee and looked at him. Bucky tipped his head to Steve’s right hand where he was crushing his plastic spoon that was making ominous cracking sounds. He breathed out and dropped it on his plate. He wouldn’t be able to eat anything anyway.
“He’s not anymore, never really was but that’s besides the point Steve! You lied to me about being straight, explain!”
“Tony!” he exclaimed brightly on hearing the familiar cadence of Tony’s voice even before seeing him.
There was a weird moment when Pepper eyed him a little strangely, as if studying him, but that was only for a few seconds.
“I know you said something about Erik not being your boyfriend anymore. Even with that, I hope you know i don’t expect anything from you please-”
Bucky perked up and looked at Steve sheepishly “Yeah sorry Stevie, you just go on and figure it out in your own pace” He patted Steve’s back fondly and turned to where Clint was and hollered a challenge. Just like that he was stumbling away and Steve loved them so much for not making a big deal out of this.
He slammed his room door with a bit of unnecessary force and lied face down on the bed before even taking off his shoes. He felt completely drained by the day, which was funny because it was his most relaxing day of the week, usually.
He wished he could just move on as quickly, or better yet never realise he was in love with Tony but dwelling on those things was literally no help so the next best thing was getting wasted.
Maybe if Steve hadn’t wasted so much time mulling over things and wasn’t such a fucking oblivious idiot he would have had a chance to really be with Tony, he would be the boyfriend that Tony proudly tell his other friends about. He should’ve told Tony sooner and maybe that would make a difference, if he had, maybe Tony wouldn’t have tried so hard so to move on and he would still want to date Steve (
“You know what? I don’t fucking care anymore, this isn’t worth it. I’m done! fucking done agonizing over why you were being distant and avoiding me and now this? I’m so over this bullshit with you”
“You can hate me and not talk to me for however long you need. I completely understand and I won’t even bother you at all, I know I have no right to ask this of you but I just want to be your friend if you can please forgive me, I promise I won’t burden you with my feelings, I just don’t want you to cut me off. I won’t be able to handle that please Tony-”
Steve breathed out, relief warring with cautious happiness and hope. He slumped over tony, limbs loose with the unbridled feeling of enormous relief. All the fight and caution went out of his body and he felt like a puppet with its strings cut.
"If you two don't stop necking at the breakfast table right the fuck now, I'm gonna burn both your eggs"
Steve basically did a lot of thinking and introspection for the two days, he thought about his friendship with Tony and how different it was from his friendship with Bucky or any of the other guys. He couldn’t even think about kissing Bucky, that was like kissing his brother
He had woken up with the mother of all hangovers on Thursday, drinking more because he was happy had definitely not been a good idea and he could barely function with the massive headache he had woken up with. He had sworn off drinking with Bucky vehemently agreeing.
Tony was looking at him expectantly, clearly nervous as if waiting for an answer and that jolted Steve out of his shocked silence.
Sure, he flirted around but he was never really serious, he flirted with everyone, even the vending machine sometimes. It was amusing to watch most of the time and that was Tony just being Tony, Steve never thought twice about it even when Tony flirted with him.
Clint and Rhodey started making gagging sounds, loudly protesting the PDA. "There are children in here!" Clint exclaimed.
Tony turned back to the door and Steve firmly shut his eyes, letting the tears fall, he couldn’t watch Tony walk out of his life, even just the thought was like a hot searing pain in his gut.
Tony was fidgeting from foot to foot and still babbling “I mean I’m sure you’re straight and all that but Pepper won’t let me
They wrestled, Steve trying to pin Tony down while the smaller man actively tried to punch, bite and kick any part of Steve he could reach. He struggled but he was finally able to pin both of Tony’s hand over his head, flushed and panting. Tony was still angrily trying to buck Steve off of him but it was impossible because Steve was much bigger and stronger.
Steve rubbed Tony's arms bemusedly as he watched his friends eating and bickering with a few amused look thrown their way.
“I didn’t lie!” Steve said indignantly, he was still busy processing everything in his sluggish hungover head.
Sam and Bucky were the last to arrive, Bucky nudged him irritably to move a bit as he sat down, he compiled with an annoyed huff and only realised a little too late that this just brought him so much closer to Tony, so close that he could catch the perpetual coffee and metal scent that was uniquely Tony’s and their thighs were brushing. He felt electrified at the contact and fought back a blush.
He was scared stupid of what tony will say but Steve Rogers had always been a stubborn mull in the face of danger, not that this was an alley fight or anything but he felt his adrenaline pumping, gearing himself up for the confrontation.
“Heh. Don’t you glower at me. Here, take this” He shoved a mug with steaming rich coffee at Steve who grunted his thanks, not really in the mood to talk to anyone.
“You confused me that day, I-I never really thought about you that way before but you managed to turn my whole world upside down. I started analyzing my feelings towards my previous art muses and Sam helped, Bucky too. They helped me understand more about my own feelings and I- well, I wasn’t actually sure at the beginning so I didn’t tell you.”
At his weekend work, Phil had taken one look at his face and put him in storage duty indefinitely, away from interacting with customers.
Steve pulled Tony back down a little forcefully than he intended and Tony sprawled half over his lap, almost tipping his beer over.
They weren’t dating but they had a weird friends with benefits thing going on but it was only likely a matter of time before it turned much more serious because Bucky was completely ass over kettle over Natasha even though he was an incorrigible flirt.
He knew Tony was out and proud bisexual, had always known even before they were friends and hated each other’s guts. He knew Tony had an older boyfriend who did a number on his emotional well-being but Tony had never actually dated anyone after that.
He could hardly think about anything else that was not Tony. Even when he was talking to one of his friends, one thing they say or do would remind him of Tony which would inevitably lead him to space out of the conversation.
“No matter” Thor boomed cheerfully, making Steve jump a little from his morose musings. “The vital question is: will he be attending my weekend party?”.
Steve pulled him more firmly on top of him and Tony immediately got with the program and straddled him. Oh fuck, this was so much better. He didn’t even care about how long he had been lying on the hard wood floor as Tony
He had started slow, thinking of a random person with big hands, rougher than a girl’s, stroking him. He groaned imagining the featureless man sinking to his knees and taking Steve’s dick in his hot, very wet mouth and it was incredible.
Steve felt short of breath like he used to when he was still a weak asthmatic kid and his heart was beating wildly, pounding at his rib-cage.
As soon as they were out of sight, Rhodey turned to Pepper who was still glaring at the door where Tony had disappeared to.
He didn’t want to mingle yet so he stayed in the kitchen while Bucky went to find Natasha and their other friends. A few people came in and out but no one bothered him.
After browsing a bit, he found something that looked relatively normal and a lot less scripted and after watching for a few minutes he concluded that yes, he was indeed hundred and ten percent bisexual based on his physical reaction.
“O…kay? Not as coherent as I initially thought” Tony smiled indulgently and patted his chest, “Let me up gummy bear”
"I didn’t want you to think I was just asking you out just to blow off some steam. And I didn’t want you to think I was still pathetically pining over you while I fuck other people pretending it’s you or whatever so I panicked and just blurted that out", Tony looked a little shamefaced telling him that, "I’m surprised you didn’t figure it out, Pep and Natasha figured it out the next day but I begged Pep to cover for me”
"Well, I never!- " Tony started but was rudely interrupted by Clint who had loudly shoved a plate in front of them.
For the first time since Tony’s unexpected confession, Steve was feeling overwhelmed with everything that had happened in the past few days. His breath hitched as if to cry, he rubbed his eyes dry.
Natasha rolled her eyes and jumped down lightly, she took the whole coffee pot and left, slamming the door shut behind her.
“I-well, Charles is really smart, you know” Tony said sheepishly while Steve squinted not really seeing the correlation, “He’s smart and he and Erik had fascinating theories about genetics and mutation which is really interesting if I can incorporate the theories for my AI projects but- well the point is Charles is smart and we had a lot of things we wanted to research together”, he sighed and darted his eyes away.
Bucky groaned longer and thumped his head on the sticky surface of the table. Both Steve and Sam wrinkled their nose in distaste.
Steve tuned him out. They weren’t fucking, it was just a little bit of heavy kissing and exploring hands. They would have gotten right on the track of ‘fucking’ if they hadn’t been so rudely interrupted.
Clint was, as usual, complaining about Natasha stealing his leftovers this morning while Sam and Bucky were making fun of how he’d never complain to Natasha’s face while Clint vehemently protested.
“And why are you so generously offering me this?” Steve retorted, he didn’t even want to know how Loki had figured that out.
Steve burst out laughing, God, he loved this ridiculous man so much. He pulled Tony back down to him, silently asking permission to kiss him. Tony just rolled his eyes and leaned in.
Steve had a momentary short circuit as his brain took in the new immense information. Not his boyfriend? What?
Steve supposed that made sense. Loki had the same reckless curiosity that comes with being a genius and Steve had witnessed Tony and Bruce doing various experiments out of that same curiosity.
He knew Tony’s family didn’t really care about his sexuality as long as he didn’t get himself into public scandals, that would be a media spectacle with his family owning one of the biggest weapon’s manufacturing company in the world.
Everyone started to discuss about Erik and Charles and how they were going to repay them for the ridiculous charade they had put up. Clint complained loudly while he made breakfast for everyone.
Tony was perched on Steve's lap, a comforting weight that made Steve thrum with happiness. It was all ridiculously domestic and happy, Steve couldn't have kept the grin off his face even if he tried.
The little bright spark in Tony’s eyes flickered and he smiled a little sadly, “well, that’s what I told Pep too and I- well”
“Hey, hey” Tony said gently as he wiggled out from under him, Steve automatically turned towards him and Tony peered down at him with soft fond eyes full of love and cupped his jaw. “Are you okay?” he asked while he gently caressed Steve's cheek with his fingers.
Steve nodded, not even arguing how Tony hadn’t actually passed him up. He tried very hard to swallow the lump in his throat as tears welled up on his eyes. They sat there in silence again, both of them ignoring the silent tear or two that Steve brushed away from time to time.
✪✪✪                                                            ✪✪✪                                                             ✪✪✪
He missed Tony like a missing limb, he truly didn’t know he had become so dependent on his interactions with the younger man and now being deliberately deprived of that was a very rude and painful awakening.
Tony made a surprised sound at suddenly having all of Steve's weight over him but hummed contentedly as he twined his legs around Steve.
After coming down from the high of his orgasm, Steve had taken a quick shower and had felt inexplicably guilty at imagining Tony like that at first, but then realised this solved all his reservations about pursuing a relationship with Tony.
He was grinning from ear to ear, feeling so much better after talking to them. Maybe he’d drink a little more, he just loved his friends
"Oh no noo, you two are totally gonna be those disgustingly cute couple who can't keep their hands off each other" Sam said in dismay as he entered the kitchen eyeing them skeptically.
He turned to Sam who was rolling his eyes at their two friends antics and occasionally telling them to “Keep it down! you morons, your teams aren’t even playing tonight”.
Clint and Sam started cackling from somewhere behind him while Bucky choked on his beer. Steve didn’t know what was so funny but he smiled, he was happy as long as his friends were happy.
He gasped a little and opened his mouth to let Tony explore as much as he wanted, he did the same with Tony’s mouth tasting coffee and
Tony immediately came to view and was smiling at Steve, he was so beautiful in his leather jacket and skinny jeans with wind tousled hair. Steve could only stare in wonder at how he had never noticed the fluttery feeling in his stomach every time Tony smiled at him.
“I’m so sorry, Tony, please, please-” Steve babbled and Tony shushed him gently while he helped him back on the couch. Steve was still crying, he didn’t know if it was in relief or the lingering pain. He was laid out on the couch and Tony crouched next to him, running his hand over Steve’s hair, calming him down and it felt so nice Steve never wanted him to stop.
Sam gave him a dubious look that told him he didn’t believe him even for a second. Steve sighed and looked around. Clint was now enthusiastically playing darts with his new friends while Bucky was flirting with the pretty blonde bartender. Steve snorted, Natasha was going to have Bucky by the balls tomorrow. She had an eerie way of knowing whenever he was fucking around, Steve honestly didn’t understand their relationship.
“Thank you Steve, I mean it really, thank you” he sounded genuine and fragile and all Steve wanted to do was gather him up in the fiercest hug possible but he wasn’t sure if that would be crossing a boundary just after what Tony had confessed to him, so he slipped his hands into his jeans pocket to stop himself
“What the FUCK!” He finally found his words, “I thought you said they were talking, Tasha! Not fucking on the kitchen floor, Oh my god my poor eyes oh my god when the fuck did this happened, oh my-”
He had to be hundred percent sure that he wanted to have a relationship with him, Tony deserved that much.
He had been inordinately happy at finally solving his problem and extremely giddy thinking about being Tony’s boyfriend.
“Just please listen to me, you can hate me however much you want afterwards but please let me finish” Tony stubbornly didn’t even acknowledge him and Steve took that as permission to start talking.
As much as Steve was enjoying his friends giving Lehnsherr the third degree he despaired at their complete lack of manners. He knew they were protective and very much intimidating towards new people but honestly this was just rude.
Steve silently processed the information. It made sense but it still didn’t quell the ugly doubts and fears screaming in his head.
He quickly went to the bathroom, washing his face with cold water to clear his head and started towards the kitchen on heavy feet, like a prisoner marching to the guillotine.
Lehnsherr (still looking smug with an amused glint in his eyes) decided to answer that, “Charles isn’t my boyfriend anymore and he’s completely fine with this. Right, babe?” he asked Tony
Before Sam had the chance to answer Bucky butt in “Why are we talking about Steve’s bisexuality?” he was obnoxiously munching on a candy he pilfered from the counter.
Steve felt electrified at the touch, it was even more perfect than he had imagined. Now that he wasn’t caught off guard or frozen in shock, he gave as good as he got. And it was glorious, the slide of Tony’s plump lips over his and the electrified feeling as Tony darted out his tongue to lick over Steve's lips.
“Tony” he whimpered pathetically, feeling tears welling up at the thought of what he was about to lose.
The more he thought about it that way, the more his confusion grew. Bucky had endlessly teased him about his crush on Peggy and Bernie and even Emily at one point, he didn’t know if those were also him admiring aesthetics or him having a crush on the people themselves, even just a bit.
“But you’re not sleeping with Erik anymore?” Steve tried to sound casual but was awfully off the mark.
“But- no I’m sorry Tony whatever I said, please-” Steve was feeling a very rapid mounting distress as Tony pulled away.
It made his heart race and palms sweaty just imagining what it would be like, it would be amazing, he’d probably taste like the toffee candy that he always munched on non-stop and Steve was infinitely tempted to find out personally.
“After that it just never felt like the right time to bring it up, I missed my window with you and you were clearly happy with Erik and I guess it was just easier to not tell you and pull away, I’m so sorry for that. I was a coward, scared that you might ask more questions if I tell you and find out how hopelessly in love with you I am”
“Hey, whoa whoa, calm down. it was a joke Steve. Of course, I knew you wouldn’t do that” Tony hurriedly said with hands out in a placating gesture.
Steve would draw or get started on his assignments and he was usually the most productive when he was hanging out in Tony’s lab.
Even though he was as loyal to the Dodgers as Bucky was, he knew better than to pick a fight over it with a drunk Clint. He turned down Clint’s offer to get him another drink, he didn’t want to wake up with a terrible hangover tomorrow after all.
He thought about his last girlfriend Peggy, who he had fallen fast and hard for in high school and dated on his senior year. After dating for a few months, he realized that he had built up the relationship so much in his head while he was pining after her that it wasn’t nearly as perfect as he thought it would be.
“I mean you’re obviously my best friend and I love you but I don’t like you like that?” He rushed out to say.
Sam turned to him again then and raised one eyebrow (Steve had always been jealous that Sam and Tony were able to do that so easily, If he tried he’d just raise both his eyebrows and look like an idiot).
He had wanted to call Tony as soon as he finished showering but no, Tony had been so brave asking Steve to his face and not hiding behind a phone. Steve had decided he owe him the same courtesy, he would tell Tony everything in person the next day.
Which only made the whole thing funnier when Natasha showed up to their usual table and Clint promptly shut up. Everything was completely normal.
It was also apparently very strong as Steve immediately felt slightly dizzy from the shot but not in a bad way. It felt good, the buzz in his veins felt so much better than any kind of buzz he had gotten from hard alcohol.
Steve groaned quietly despairing at the idiotic ideas his friends came up with but couldn’t really bring himself to be too upset at being the butt of those stupid ideas.
He wished he could text Tony right now, even if it was some nonsensical conversation about how different metal react to different chemicals. But he refrained from texting first, barely.
Steve knew that he wasn't that big on holidays, but he would be lying if he said that he wasn't a little disappointed about the lack of enthusiasm.
Steve immediately sprang into action, placing his shield over one of the grenades, before it could detonate and cloud the room in thick smoke. Meanwhile Bucky knocked two of the policemen that came through the windows unconscious, making his way to the third on the balcony. Only thanks to Steve’s quick reflexes, did the man not fall over the railing to his death.
Steve had his arms crossed in front of his chest, his huge frame blocking the elevator doors of Tony's penthouse apartment in the tower. They had been fighting for hours by now, neither of them willing to give in.
Sam was about to pick up Bucky’s unconscious body, but Steve knocked him aside and shot him a glance that made unmistakably clear, that no one but him was to touch Bucky. Without a word, Steve picked up his friend and carried him into the jet.
Taking out his phone and browsing through his contact list, his finger ended up ghosting over Pepper’s number. She was the only woman, the only person, who had loved him. Who managed to live with him. Who understood who he was. The woman had the patience of a saint, the wit of a genius and balls of steel. And even she couldn’t stand to be with him longer than a few months. How could anyone else? If Pepper couldn’t manage to be with him, no one could.
He sat down between Clint and Bruce, right opposite him was their fearless leader, nursing a Whisky, Natasha to his left and Thor to his right.
Due to his injuries he had taken a couple of painkillers that made his body feel like he was floating. But then again, he
Pepper crossed her arms and just looked at him. To most people her face would betray no emotion and Tony knew she prided herself with that. But he noticed the slight tension in her shoulders, the thinning of her lips tightly pressed together.
Steve ran his hand across his face in a futile attempt to regain his composure, making Tony laugh again. It was the most beautiful sound in the world. If embarrassing himself in front of strangers is what it took for Tony to smile and be happy, then he would gladly spend his life doing just that.
Tony walked up to one of the workmen and put on his best authoritarian face. “Who is in charge here?”
“You know Cap, sometimes it’s okay to break the rules.” Before Steve could ask her what she meant, Nat already got up again to continue making drinks. Rules were never meant to be broken.
“It was a mighty battle!” He exclaimed, smiling brightly. Tony rolled his eyes so hard, he was sure they would get stuck in his head.
“Okay maybe the team needs a little rest, but I am good to go. It’s not like I could relax anyways.”
Thor smiled sleepily at Tony, maybe not noticing that they were hugging or maybe he just didn’t mind. Tony had no idea how the Asgardian’s regarded situations like this, and it was quite possible, that this was just normal to them. Either way Tony didn’t mind and instead of getting up, he went back to resting his head next to Thor’s.
Tony snorted at that and crossed his arms. “Sure, they are.” That came out way bitchier than he had intended and by the way Bruce was looking at him, he knew that he was about to be questioned by the scientist.
Instead, he faked a yawn, mumbled a half-hearted goodnight and darted out of the fort, almost tearing it down in the process, and up the stairs to his room.
“You don’t understand!” Nat sat up and put her book down. “I did this. I hurt them. So, I need to fix it!” Her teeth were clenched, and she had that distant angry look on her face again. But this time it wasn’t because she was upset with Steve or anyone else, she was angry at herself. She was angry because Bruce was right: her meddling did cause more harm than good, and that was never her intention. She just wanted her friends to be happy and she knew that Steve and Tony could make each other happy. She needed to fix this. She needed them to be happy.
Natasha stepped away from Steve, shooting him one last glance before helping the pillow mountains building their fort.
Movement behind him, forced Steve to take his eyes off Bucky. He made quick work of the policemen, but by the time he was done with them, he had lost sight of Bucky.
There was no mistake here. But it couldn’t be. Why would May sell her bakery, it was her joy and pride, she worked so hard to get this place to what it was. And now some guy with a great ass just swooped in, tore down her sign and destroyed everything May had worked for all these years?
After they had eaten, Clint and Natasha went for a swim, while Bruce was clearing away the left-over food and dishes with Steve. Thor meanwhile devoted himself to the things he had wrapped up in his towel.
Five pairs of eyes were fixed on the super soldiers, his friends faces showing a mixture of shock, astonishment and untamed curiosity.
“Why didn’t you say something?” She shot back and he knew she was right. “Steve, I’ve seen the way he looks at you. I promise you no more meddling. I just want you to be happy. So please talk to him.”
That left the rest of the team to decide on a movie to watch. The fact that there was only a limited selection of movies to pick from the small DVD collection in the house helped. The fact that it only consisted of Rom Coms didn’t. Tony had the distinct feeling that this was in no way a coincident, although Natasha seemed truly surprised about it. Then again, she was a brilliant actress, and an even more brilliant plotter.
“What… what do you mean you found Bucky?” Steve asked in disbelieve. He didn’t even know that Tony had been looking for him.
“How is any of this helpful, Nat?” Steve asked, rather impatiently. This whole situation frustrated him.
“I’m sorry Tony. For yelling and for what happened.” She said, her voice no longer harsh and accusing.
Natasha surfaced from a dive to see Steve standing in front of her at the edge of the pool. She glanced up at him and swam back a little to get a better look. As she opened her mouth to speak, Steve raised his finger as if to shush Natasha. “Not a word.”
Both of them got back up from the floor, but before Bucky could jump out after his rucksack, another policeman stormed in, firearm blazing. To protect Bucky from the hail of bullets, Steve placed his shield in front of his friend, bullets bouncing off it. As soon as the clip was empty, Bucky neutralised the man, throwing his gun across the room.
And so, they did. Bruce had packed snacks for all of them and Steve made sure, everyone carried enough water with them so they wouldn’t get dehydrated, also making sure that they put on plenty of sun lotion.
“Well then, this is the right address and the owner did sell it to me, which therefore makes it my place now.”
They remained like this for what felt like hours, Tony with his head resting on Steve's shoulder, arms wrapped tightly around each other, eyes closed. Calm.
The god came over to him to explain his present. “They are runes. If you put them on, they will grand you knowledge. It’s different for everyone. I thought you might like it. Also, it’s a necklace.”
But what he hated the most was that in fact he did not hate any of it. Apart from the hike. He really hated the hike.
So, he kept going, kept inventing and kept drinking. And then Afghanistan happened. And him finding out about Obidiah happened. And Tony finally decided that being the head of a multi-billion weapons company was not his future. Signing the company over to Pepper wasn’t nearly as difficult as he thought it would be and neither was finding something else to do with all of his spare time and money.
He really should talk to Steve about all of this, make it clear to him, that he had chosen the wrong guy to have a crush on.
The before mentioned “battle” took place about an hour later and consisted Thor and Tony stamping all over their creation, Tony trying to sound like a dinosaur, which actually sounded more like a dying cat, and Thor giving his best impression of Godzilla. By that time Clint and Nat had finally emerged from the ocean and watched the destruction with Steve and Bruce.
And off they went. Tony was very much aware of the fact that Steve was only going about half the speed he was capable of and he was also very aware of the Captain’s ass right in front of him. He tried his best to keep up with Steve, while at the same time trying not to die. It wasn’t like Tony was unfit, but it was nothing compared to the super-soldier.
Since he couldn’t decide which one was the right thing to do, and he sure as hell wouldn’t ask Nat again for relationship advise, Steve just decided to wait for a sign. People in movies always waited for signs and then everything worked out fine. So, why shouldn’t it be like that for him?
Steve could feel his blood rush to his head the moment Sally started to moan, his body temperature rising, his heartbeat going nuts. Suddenly he was feeling very hot and claustrophobic. He tried to focus on something, anything distracting himself from the noises coming form the television. He looked over to the others, who started to giggle, and he noticed that the only other person looking uncomfortable as well, was Tony.
Steve was 90% sure that Clint wasn’t the only one they had such a list for. Especially after yesterday. “Well, then I’m glad you guys went easy on me.” He said with a shy smile.
Clint blinked a few times and huffed. “What’s up, trouble in paradise?” It was hard to tell who kicked him first under the table, Nat or Bruce. “OW!”
Just thinking about being Tony’s prey, made Steve thoughts jump to a very different kind of situation, with a considerable lesser amount people involved. But to be fair it would include Tony seeing his tattoo.
The moment the words left Steve’s lips everyone stared at him in disbelieve, making him instantly regret having spoken. Clearly, he said something wrong or offensive and they were mad again.
They stayed like that for a moment longer, just enjoying the closeness. All of them had suffered before, had lost people they loved, got betrayed by people they trusted, and had their hearts broken. But what they had here, right now, was all that mattered. They had people who would lay their lives down in front of them, who would protect them from harm and hurt, and would love them beyond the grave.
Bruce, Clint and Natasha hadn't celebrated Christmas in years and seemed really excited when Steve first suggested celebrating together.
Just as Steve attempted to have another light and brief conversation with Tony, in which he asked the other man if he preferred flathead or cross screwdrivers, Clint leaned over to Natasha. “Is he having a stroke?”
Just before Steve was finished, Tony walked over, coming straight from the beach by the look of it, his feet still covered in sand. “Is it Christmas already? Because let me tell you Cap, this is all I’ve ever wanted.”
Steve was fighting the urge to leave and just hide in his room again, but instead he sat down on the sofa with them.
Tony jumped at the sudden outburst, spilling some of his coffee on his pyjamas. “What the fu- oh you have got to be kidding me!”
“Right boys, I have decided what to do with Mr. Barton.” Steve let out a shaky breath. Finally, something else to focus on but Tony.
“What do you want me to do? Walk up to him and say: Oh, hello Mister Iron Man, I sure do like you. Would you accompany me to dance, I bet you’re a real jive bomber?”
Really, the business pitch that followed could’ve been the best damn thing since sliced bread, could’ve been the most earth-shattering innovation known to man, but Tony wouldn’t know because the next thing Toby did was slap a hand down on his shoulder, right where it met his neck.
“Oh, sorry. Should I add that to the list of forbidden joke topics, along with anything related to your height? Or...lack thereof?”
“Oh right, like I plan my work binges around when a bunch of revamped doombots are gonna launch a spontaneous attack on several major cities.”
Desperation claws at his chest, tightens in his throat, hinders his breathing, because even now it’s not enough, he doesn’t think it’ll
Steve flashed him a smile, all bright eyed and playful. “Apart from the fact that you were almost killed two weeks ago?”
An adorable little frown creases Steve’s forehead as he rests his chin atop Tony’s chest, peering up at him with earnest blue eyes.
Somehow, the horror in his expression, in the way he stood ramrod straight, like he was reacting to Tony’s words on an almost visceral level, was even worse. Steve Rogers had a soul that burned fiercely with almost everything he did, and it scared Tony sometimes, just a little. He couldn’t imagine openly wearing his heart on his sleeve that way, without trying to hide somehow. Pesky deep-seated hang-ups about allowing himself to be vulnerable and all that, courtesy of his lovely father.
he looked, lips pressed into a thin line of suppressed anger, shoulders held high, chest puffed out.
Tony shrugged. He had a vague feeling that installing a projector into both the common room and his own room had been a sleep-deprived and/or barely coherent decision.
“Now, now, cupcake, no need to go all saviour complex on me. I’m just tired, must’ve blanked out for a bit. No big deal.”
him. Steve casually takes one as he talks, and Tony bites the inside of his cheek so hard that he tastes coppery blood. He doesn’t know how he can eat so casually, how he can look at that bread and see anything but carbs and fat and calories.
Tony aimed for a laugh but fell drastically short, ending up with a choked sort of noise that was awfully close to revealing just how intensely uncomfortable he was suddenly feeling. Which was ridiculous, obviously, because it was
even, from his morning brush. He googles the menu for the Italian restaurant they’re headed to, dread slamming into him when nothing,
“Look, I’m not necessarily against being your glorified teddy bear, but is this like, a coping thing or something? A life-affirming thing? Because I thought it was pretty evident already that I am, in fact, alive. And breathing. And functioning, somewhat.”
He was informed by a beaming Sam upon re-entering the living space that Clint had a wardrobe malfunction, and would likely be delayed for several minutes. Tony settled down beside the man on the couch, eyes narrowed skeptically.
Tony nods. His heart is beating so rapidly that he’s surprised it hasn’t burst right of his chest yet, he can hear the echo of it in his ears and feel the thrum of it in his head.
It had been so unbearably easy for Obadiah to position him exactly how he wanted, with the front of a man who cared, with constant touches, with constant attention. In hindsight, the thought had nausea churning in his gut, how young he’d been and how
Tony struggled to contain a smile when Steve raised his hands, eyes suddenly glimmering with a contained sort of mischief that might well have been overlooked by someone who didn’t know him. A deadly mistake, if you asked him.
“Yeah, that was Thor-level eating, I’m honestly impressed,” says Clint, a teasing smile painted across his face.
it until he found Steve hopping between the rooftops of some ridiculously tall Manhattan buildings, all because Sam had bet him 20 dollars that he couldn’t. Tony’s blood pressure had spiked one too many times that particular evening, hovering around in his iron man suit like some helicopter parent while thousands of stars winked down at them from the night sky, practically
He wraps an arm around Tony’s waist as they enter the restaurant. Tony feels dread surge in his chest, knowing that he can feel the softness there that just won’t budge no matter how much he works his sides.
The Avengers smile and poke fun at him for being one of those health-freaks, Tony pokes fun right back and tells them they’ll need to start doing it too, soon enough,
Steve is trailing kisses from Tony’s jaw down to his collarbone, feather-light, warm breath ghosting over his skin. He shifts and hums, languidly arching upwards, running an idle hand up and down Steve’s back, following the lines of muscle as they shift. It’s been a few days since they’d had a moment like this, where the kisses don’t become heated, where they’re surrounded by relative quiet. Steve’s thighs bracket his legs, and he sits back with a smile. Tony’s thoughts are slow, hazy, and he feels a pleasant lightness all over, humming just underneath his skin.
“Not that I mind,” he murmured, once they’d found a moment of quiet, “but usually you end up in a corner with about ten women hanging onto your every horribly awkward word. Any reason you’re playing bodyguard today?”
Without a word, the entire ceiling was illuminated by a riot of stars, smattered across a spanning canvas of black. Deep shades of purple entered the mix too, and Tony’s eyes were drawn immediately to all of the constellations. He heard a sharp intake of breath somewhere from above his head.
“Which is exactly why I have a supersoldier with a motorcycle,” he said, offering him a sugary sweet smile. “Why else do you think I keep you around?”
“My business card,” Toby said as a last-ditch effort, leaning forward to tuck it into Tony’s front pocket and
Tony has for trashy novelty Captain America merchandise, and that at this rate, they’re not even joke gifts. They’re
Steve’s eyebrows furrowed, as though he wasn’t quite sure of the answer himself. He remained silent for a beat or two, turning the words over in his head.
Tony presses his lips into a thin line. He can’t see the kitchen, he doesn’t know how much oil they add or how many ingredients they add.
He hears more than he sees Steve approach, feels the strong arms that wind around his torso, feels the solid chest that he’s drawn back into.
He thinks, as Steve pulls away to look at him, to run gentle fingers along the side of his face, that Steve
“Oh, I’m sorry, are you an inventor? I must’ve missed that. It’s been a few seconds too long since you’ve reminded me.”
“Yeah you are,” Tony agrees, dropping his voice to a heated murmur as he smooths his hands along Steve’s back, feels the muscles jump just slightly beneath the layers of fabric.
Tony hesitated for a moment, before giving a small nod, brushing a strand of hair away from Steve’s face like the horribly sappy person he was. “I do.”
Panic overwhelms him each time he nears his calorie limit, each time Steve’s eyes linger on him when he scrutinises his dinner before eating it, each time the Avengers suggest ordering in, and he has to scramble to figure out what to order, think through and rationalize what was once an easy, off-the-cuff decision.
“I’m sure it is, pal. As much as I’d love to cuddle the night away, I think we should start getting ready.”
But it doesn’t dissolve the tightness in his throat, the dread that twists itself into knots inside his stomach, it doesn’t keep the sudden onslaught of tears from stinging at his eyes.
Then a man approached. Which also would’ve been fine, for the record, it was just that everything about his disposition just
He decided then and there that his favourite version of Steve may just be tired and kiss-rumpled Steve, with his hair in disarray, lips that were pinked up ever so slightly, and a smile that crinkled his eyes. Maybe he’d even tell him that one day. Let him know what kind of power he held, without even knowing it. Maybe.
staring. The reflective surfaces of his lab, storefront windows, his phone’s dead screen, the bathroom mirror. He lingers without meaning to, scrutinises and takes apart and checks, checks to make sure the pounds he lost hadn’t returned to his face. It’s just a precaution, he reasons, so that his work isn’t undone. He knows the exact way his stomach looks when he sits down, has categorised the myriad of ways his jawline appears from different angles. He gets lost in thought about what Steve sees when he looks at him, what the Avengers see what they look at him, what passers-by see when they look at him.
expensive shoes. FRIDAY was probably ordering some as they spoke, if he was being honest. She was intuitive like that.
Ice races through Tony’s veins, gathers in his chest and tightens in his throat, makes his breaths come out in short, sharp puffs. He’s had his body scrutinised inside and out by the press, it’s just sort of part and parcel when it comes to being a public figure, and he’s never spared it much thought, had certainly never agonised over their opinions of him or his body.
“Ah, right! Gaining access to confidential S.H.I.E.L.D. files. I’ll tell you what, the secret is not giving a fuck. That seems to work out pretty well for me.”
“Nothing so drastic, cap,” Tony teased, hooking a leg over his. “I don’t know what you’ve heard about me but I’m not that kind of girl.”
He turned his gaze to Steve as he sucked in greedy lungfuls of air, and something hot, something like
But right now, it feels like a monumental task, a treacherous trek up a steep mountain, that shakes and crumbles even when he reaches the crest, even when he looks out at rolling plains and low-hanging clouds and various shades of ochre.
Not one word escapes his lips in return, but Steve seems satisfied regardless as they re-join the buzzing crowds, giving Tony’s hand a brief squeeze.
“When I was growing up, uh, I’m sure you know this, but food was pretty scarce. Money was tight.” He pauses. “It confused me, when I first realised what might be happening. I didn’t push, when I think I should’ve, I didn’t—I didn’t do a lot of things, because I didn’t want to overstep, and I didn’t want to be wrong. I did some research, and I’d be lying if I said I’m an expert, or not confused about a few things, but I want to be here for you, Tony. I want you to be okay. The team needs you, the world needs you,
Call him stubborn, but once Tony started working on a project, he found it incredibly difficult to stop. He’d never been one for breaks or quick five minute walks around the block, no matter how often it was harped on, no matter what sort of supposed wonders it could do for his wellbeing. Once he was in the right headspace, he didn’t care for being interrupted unless aliens had spontaneously announced their intent to enslave humans, or if he’d run out of coffee, or if he’d hit a sudden roadblock and he needed to vent a bit of frustration. As was the case for these pending Starkphone optimizations.
He lifts his shirt almost every time he enters the bathroom, scrutinises his stomach and his arms and his back, tenses and un-tenses his muscles, stands up on the edge of the bathtub to get a full view of his body, looks and looks and
He knows the science behind it, he knows the logic, he knows about water retention and he knows how the body responds to a temporary surplus in calories.
“Well, take it easy. I can bring you up some water, maybe? Think we have some anti-nausea stuff laying around too.”
Instead of taking a break, though, instead of wandering up to the kitchen he shares with Steve, he just...doesn’t. He dives head-first into work and feels a twisted sense of satisfaction in how empty his stomach feels, how he’s pushing himself despite that, how he’s...
The laugh that left Tony’s throat was a bitter thing. “You obviously weren’t around for the myriad of charming people that have targeted me
) poked fun at him for his extra time in the gym, tentatively approaches him and asks him whether he thinks he’s overdoing it.
“Quit talking, Cap, and quit it with the pouty face you’ve got going. We’re almost home and I’m summoning up as many of your lectures in my head as I can, so I can perfectly emulate your Captain America tone of disapproval and throw it right back at you.”
Steve’s features smoothed out with shock, but only briefly before that spark was returning to his eyes, burning a whole lot brighter now. He swallowed, and Tony couldn’t help but track the movement.
giggle, as they wrestled around on the couch like a pair of fourth-graders. He’d passed by the training rooms on numerous occasions of course, pausing to watch in amusement as Sam and Steve’s sparring devolved into playful wrestling, but he generally preferred to train alone unless he’d been coaxed into joining one of his teammates. Usually Steve. Or Nat, for that matter.
Steve’s smile widened just a little, but it was more than enough for Tony. He seemed steadier now, more clear-eyed, and his hair looked almost gold where the light hit it, in a way that managed to remind him of rolling cornfields on a clear blue day. It was unfair, really, that Steve looking all warm and rumpled was all it took for his brain to start turning to flowery metaphors. Maybe he
His gaze flicked to Steve, who was currently pressed up against him in every way imaginable, arms around his waist, head tucked into the crook of his neck, legs tangled with his own. He could even feel the occasional flutter of his eyelashes.
A warm smile spread across Steve’s face at that, and his stance became more open, relaxed. “I know you don’t take it lightly. I don’t either. I can’t promise much, but...I’ll work on it.”
him. It was nice, though. Hearing Sam and Steve’s laughter, carried away by the wind, had sort of made it worth it. Not that he’d ever tell them that.
He wasn’t surprised when Tony’s breaths fully evened out, a peaceful expression stealing over his face as sleep pulled him under. Shifting slightly so that his neck wouldn’t be on such an awkward angle, Steve couldn’t help but press one final kiss to his forehead before letting his own eyes flutter shut.
The furrow returns to Steve’s eyebrows. Tony reaches up to smooth his thumb over the crease it creates. A sigh escapes Steve’s lips and he dips down, nuzzles into the space along the juncture of Tony’s neck, right where he dabs his cologne in the morning. He lingers there for a moment before drawing back so that they’re face to face, so close that their breaths mingle in the space between them, that Tony can feel each exhale against his parted lips.
But when Steve approached Tony, he quickly joined the others around the table, leaving Steve standing there by himself. “Oh, look cheeseburgers!”
The first minute passed in silence, Natasha had her feet popped up on the dashboard again like usual, while Steve stared very intensely at the road ahead of him.
Steve and Bruce came to a halt about 20 meters in front of them. “Do you see what I see?” Bruce asked, his voice sounding very concerned. Steve just nodded.
Clint just rolled his eyes and made space for Tony on the sofa. Bruce wordlessly handed him a plate loaded with food. He knew Tony hadn’t eaten much today and as the “mother” and cook of the group he had to make sure all his hatchlings were eating properly. More or less.
Maybe he shouldn’t call him “Captain America” when he asked him. Maybe he shouldn’t ask him. Maybe he should just pretend that he didn’t know any of this and then surely it would go away. Yes. That was a good plan.
“You’re setting the bar too high man. Now whatever I give her for her birthday has to be better than those.” Clint hissed, hoping Nat wouldn’t hear him.
Thor’s lips twitched slightly, as he looked at the people around him. There was so much love in their eyes, and he felt like he was wrapped up in a warm cocoon. They were right, this was his family and he wouldn’t want to trade them for the world.
Thor’s face lit up. “That sounds most incredible!” And with that he went off into the nearest store as if running into battle for an imaginary place with talking animals.
“And then I proclaimed: Nay you are the chicken!” Thor’s laughter rang through the house again, just as they all walked into the common room.
According to the file, Bucky was in Bucharest in a small shitty apartment that reminded Steve so much of the first apartment he and Bucky had shared back in Brooklyn. Before the war. Before the serum. When things were easy.
Even though Pepper had officially paid for all of May’s treatments, they had never met before and Tony had preferred it that way, trying desperately to keep his past and his present sperate. But even he knew that some things were inevitable.
Just as he was about to put the paper down on the kitchen counter, Steve heard a soft noise coming from the front door behind him. Any normal human wouldn’t have been able to pick up on it, but thanks to the serum Steve didn’t only know that there was someone else in the room with him, but also who it was.
Taking all of this into consideration it was even more astonishing when Bruce came out onto the sundeck with a bunch of aprons in his hand. “We’re cooking.”
“This is amazing! I don’t know how to thank you Tony.” Steve breathed against Tony’s now smiling lips.
“Alright, but not the same. The surgery took a lot out of me Tony, and I have a long recovery ahead of me. My hearing is still not as it used to be, and it might never get better. The tumour could return and if I have to go through all of this again, the last thing I need is to worry about the shop.”
Steve’s palms started sweating again as he got into the car with Nat. After the ice cream and the sort of apology, he had hoped that everything would be okay between them, but evidently it wasn’t.
They had landed on a beautiful beach, the deep blue ocean crashing against white sand. In front of them rose a small cliff and on it stood the most amazing house. It consisted of three stories, with a pool on the middle and top floor, both of them surrounded by large sun decks. The few walls of the house were wood but big window fronts dominated the layout, everything was open and spacious and just breathtakingly beautiful. Around the house was nothing but jungle and a narrow path leading up from the beach.
He was beginning to feel like himself again. He went to work and kept the company moving forward. He was working out at a normal pace again, making time to see his friends and family again. Life was returning to normal and he was beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
Tony knows he’s in a healthy weight range for a man of his height and age, JARVIS has made sure to inform him of that fact on multiple occasions, but he sees a photo in the press that captures him at a particular angle and hey, he’s not getting any younger here, so he gets the idea in his head that he should lose a few pounds, just to make sure he’s still got it.
A smile tugged at Tony’s lips as he approached, clearing his throat. “So what’s it tonight, then, cap? The futility of existence, the inevitability of death, or some good old fashioned fatalism?”
Steve shushed him, and Tony was almost glad he didn’t have to keep up his rambling nonsense, his futile efforts to explain without explaining.
He ventures down to the gym between projects and does his usual strength training, ignores the fact that it feels just slightly more difficult than usual, that his breaths start coming out in short, sharp puffs a bit quicker than usual.
It’s a quarter to eleven and the sky is a canvas of black outside Tony’s room, illuminated by a warm lamp and nothing more. Steve hovers over him, fingers twisted up in the bedsheets on either side of his chest. His hair is a little longer than usual, golden strands hanging down as he peers at Tony with those perceptive blue eyes that reflect the city lights through the window. He watches as the colours play over his face in rapid motion, watches as he shifts back onto his haunches and regards Tony, lips turned down into the slightest frown.
Steve shifts back onto his knees, hands landing on either side of Tony’s head as he leans in, hovers over him. Tony trails a hand up his side, can’t help it, really, fingers brushing along warm skin and settling somewhere around the slight jut of Steve’s hip.
Steve took a moment to try and gather himself again, but the mirth shone through stubbornly at the corners of his mouth.
“The arc reactor, he got too - if he’d just, just kept his hands to himself, it would’ve been goddamn
It’s nothing compared to the rush he feels when his app informs him that his calorie goal is too low for a man of his height and age, that the amount of weight he’ll lose in a short period of time is unhealthy.
Which, really, was why Tony didn’t mind so much when Steve’s hand found the small of his back as they navigated the dinner tables. People didn’t tend to lay it on so thick with the contact when Captain America was hovering somewhat ominously by your shoulder like a guardian angel.
The windows shift, flicker for just a moment, and Steve jumps a bit, clearly startled, before scrambling to his feet. His face is blotchy and red, stray tears clinging to his cheeks.
He smiles, points a playfully accusatory finger. “Don’t think I haven’t forgotten about those family-sized pizzas, Birdbrain.”
When Steve suggests they go out somewhere for dinner, he doesn’t look forward to spending time with him, to the gelato they like to get afterward from their favourite store, he
He sent a playful glance in Steve’s direction as he dropped down onto the couch beside Rhodey, more than thrilled to find that a blush had spread itself across his cheeks.
Tony threw him a smirk. “I dunno, honeybear, depends on who’s playing nurse. You know I’d have you any day of the-”
Tony knows the science. He knows that his BPM has dropped significantly, he knows how the human body adapts to a lack of calories.
He stands in front of their obscenely large bathroom mirror and stares, tan skin a counterpoint to the rest of their sleek marble bathroom. The changes are minute, a few more hints of sharpness along his jawline, his stomach far less bloated, which throws his abdominal muscles into sharper relief than usual.
“You know, I didn’t realise I was dating Sherlock Holmes, but I have to say, it’s not an unappealing thought.”
He’s over-eaten before. Everyone does, it’s just a part of life, occasionally eating more than you can handle, for a variety of reasons.
He logs his meals for a week, he uses kitchen scales and measuring cups and feels irrational panic tighten in his chest each time team dinner rolls around. A different team member cooks each night, which leaves him with only one day a week where he knows exactly what’s going into the dinner. He doesn’t want to draw attention to himself by making separate meals anymore, but he can’t keep on guesstimating the ingredients and the oil and the spices that go into each dish, logging it and hoping desperately that it’s accurate. So. He develops a couple of strategies.
“Jesus, cap. You don’t need to butter me up, I’m totally at peace with being relegated to teddy bear status.”
“I bet these baby blue eyes really did it for the dames back in your day, huh?” Tony mused, running fingertips along the side of his face.
He starts checking the nutritional panel for cereal boxes, for protein bars, for just about anything that enters his body,
look at him and see imperfection, right now it’s almost glaringly obvious, staring him right in the face.
Tony shrugged, unapologetic. “Two minutes, maybe? And get that damn shield off your back, Cap, wearing that with your suit is pure sacrilege. I
“Oh, come on. An assassination attempt is tame compared to all the shit we deal with in our day job. All I want right now is my workshop and some coffee.”
damn coffee from his favourite café. It was hard to say what exactly had opened the floodgate, but suddenly, brushes of contact became something more lingering. Steve had waltzed right into his personal space like he belonged there and set up shop, which... it was amusing, Tony would give him that. He wasn’t exactly
A thrill runs down his spine at having set out to do something, at having actually achieved it as planned. At having
him, per se, but he does like to cook for him, does like to share food with him. Tony thinks it has something to do with growing up during the Depression, during an era of food rations, where sharing food must’ve been almost intrinsically tied to affection, to showing friends and family that you cared about them, that you were looking after them.
Steve’s smile looked a little abashed when Tony arched an amused eyebrow. “If you wanna be my fella, that is.”
Tony’s eyes narrowed playfully. “Because I didn’t read much on your file about the serum giving you superkissing abilities.” He schooled his smile, feigning contemplation, before adding, “I guess I should be glad you’re even kissing me before the first date, with your delicate 40’s sensibilities and all.”
A teasing smile tugs at Steve’s lips. “Oh, I know. The amount of times you’ve randomly yelled out the solution to an equation I didn’t even
He swallows once, twice, three times. “Of course I have. Had a light lunch, because I knew we’d be going out.”
“Can I get you anything, Captain Temperance? Some apple juice, maybe? Sugar may not be alcohol, but it’s all the same poison.”
When they get the menus, Tony’s eyes scan for anything with minimal ingredients, anything that could be reasonably low-calorie, heart stuttering in his chest when he realises that Steve is regarding him, blue eyes following the finger that Tony runs along the laminated paper.
He gathered up the scraps of his remaining dignity and offered the man a quick smile as Steve herded him away. It wasn’t his fault that Tony happened to have some pesky unresolved trauma, after all.
Attention successfully deflected, Tony goes back to picking at his remaining waffle and internally running through what Steve normally uses in the batter, as exact as he can get it.
dead, I’m very much alive, and I’d very much like to work on some new suit upgrades and get on with my life.”
When the number on the scale remains static between one day and the next, he finds that increasing his calorie deficit isn’t enough to satisfy the dread that hangs over his shoulders.
Every time he enters the bathroom, the scales sit there mockingly, they goad him into checking, into making sure that he hasn’t regained any of the weight.
matters with all of the positive reinforcement he had going either - wistful sighs, hums of content, leaning into every point of contact and warmth like a man pathetically starved for affection.
“You’ve watched me almost die multiple times, but you only started getting touchy this time around. Why?”
He pressed himself up against Steve’s side once they’d exchanged a good amount of  lingering kisses, almost deliriously happy. Steve’s arm remained around his waist, fingers trailing up and down his side.
Steve didn’t seem surprised by the intrusion; he’d probably heard Tony coming from a mile away. He wondered briefly just what the extent of his superhearing was. Maybe he’d conduct an experiment some time, in the name of healthy scientific curiosity.
Steve let out a long-suffering sigh. “The sniper is in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, because Fury seems to think this could be Hydra-related, even though I told him they probably hate me a whole more than they hate you. The guy’s refusing to talk so we don’t know if he was hired by anyone yet. I offered to help out with a bit of creative persuasion, but apparently that suggestion wasn’t appreciated very much.”
He turned when he heard a long-suffering sigh somewhere behind his left shoulder, trying and failing to keep the smile off his lips.
need sleep, after all. He’d keep that thought safely locked away inside, or else FRIDAY would start rejoicing.
Steve sank back down into his seat with a sigh, radiating an aura of helpless defeat that really wasn’t characteristic of him, even after an intense fight. Tony wasn’t a whole lot better. His usual state of low-level exhaustion was rapidly approaching ‘might-fall-asleep-standing’ levels, and his multi-tasking capabilities had taken almost abysmal plunges. He could barely maintain two lines of thought at once, couldn’t even muster up concern at the tension wrought through Steve’s body, or the slight clench of his jaw as he examined his hands.
In hindsight, Tony should’ve seen it coming. Steve had always been a little… intense when it came to his safety on the field.
But, he’s always been a practical person, so instead, he loses himself in daydreams about how he’s going to make up for the food he’s going to eat, the exact exercises he’s going to perform and for how long, the exact foods he’s going to eat tomorrow, calorie totals and all, the dinner he’s going to make, because it’s his night tomorrow, and that means he can use water instead of oil while he’s cooking, that means he can log each and every ingredient, he can choose something that—
“Sorry. Too dark?” He almost looked a little sheepish now, gaze shifty and hands running more insistently along the creases of the couch.
It was all sort of a blur from there. He remembered entering the compound, a few forms that were probably people surrounding him, exchanging quiet chatter. He remembered being laid down on his bed by strong arms, belonging to someone who looked suspiciously like-
“Tony Stark!” the man exclaimed, with that perfect spark of familiarity in his tone that was commonplace for events like these, like Tony knew who the hell he was.
He drinks water religiously, to keep himself as full as possible before the meal, tears of frustration welling in his eyes when it doesn’t quite work, when the smell of garlicky bread hits his nose, and he can’t deny how
It’s horrible, and suffocating, and he sort of wants to bang his head against a wall until all of it falls silent, until those thoughts and desires and fantasies have been forcibly eradicated from his mind.
Then, because the human body was an unfortunate thing with inconvenient needs and laying down doing absolutely nothing for hours on end was among them, his vision blacked out.
Anxiety needles at him constantly, his brain muddied by thoughts of food, of what his next meal is going to be, how many calories it’s going to have, how he’s going to prepare it to ensure it has that exact number of calories, what his meals will be the following day, what his next suggestion for takeaway should be, what will ensure that he won’t near his calorie goal that day. It’s an endless cycle that feeds into itself, he feels like he’s in a tailspin on an endless icy road and he’s just barely keeping himself on track, just barely steering himself to safety.
, Tony was a little gobsmacked. Sue him. He liked the guy, but he’d spent an afternoon with Bucky and Sam once swapping stories about all of their romantic misadventures, and Steve was about as smooth as the pothole-filled New York streets.
“Oh Bucky, won’t you come jogging with me? Oh no, no, no, Steve’s busy, trust me, it’ll just be us. Oh Bucky, I can’t believe you’d jump in front of me like that with your big, strong metal arm, you’re such an idiot, I think I might-”
while since he’d been chased around for days on end by thoughts about one person, because one person shouldn’t have all that power over him, not when power was so easily abused. He shouldn’t be distracted by internal musings about blue eyes, or the curve of Steve’s mouth when he was being snarky, or the way his arms looked while he was tossing his shield about in the training room.
“Am I?” he asks absently, attempting to chase Steve’s lips, but he just draws back further, eyebrows knitted together with worry.
It really strikes Tony sometimes, just how much Steve wears his heart on his sleeve with the people he trusts. He’ll casually mention things that make Tony’s heart leap inside his chest, heartfelt admissions that float in the air, like they roll of Steve’s tongue with ease. He doesn’t think he’ll ever quite get used to Steve’s specific brand of sincerity in all of its bashful yet earnest glory, is not quite sure he deserves it, really, but he appreciates it all the same, despite his token protests and his snarky autopilot responses.
Steve’s hands balled temporarily into fists, knuckles turning white with the pressure of it. He released them with a long, shaky exhale, directing his focus towards the bed again.
Maybe he notices every time he has Tony shirtless in his bed, every time Tony shifts to grab something from the bedside table, every time Tony doubles over with loud, uninhibited laughter.
Tony let out what he hoped was a long, even breath, even as guilt tried valiantly to claw its way up his throat. “I can’t - I can’t guarantee -”
“It’s true though,” said Steve, looking unfairly like a kicked puppy, confusion drawing his eyebrows together and creating that
Tony didn’t know what it was about about those words that had him softening, but in just a few short seconds, he’d melted back into the pillows with a defeated sigh, digging the heels of his hands into his eyes.
The silence that followed lasted a shade too long to be comfortable. There was a quip on the tip of Tony’s tongue, ready to lighten the mood, a reflex that came easier to him than breathing at that point. Steve spoke before Tony could give voice to it.
“Are you okay?” Steve asks him, once they’re away from the thick of it all, warm evening breeze gusting in through a nearby open window. His voice is all low, rumbly, concerned, and Tony can hardly stand it.
“Don’t think for one second I’m dropping this conversation, Tony,” he said, with just the slightest trace of sheepishness in his voice. “You’re laying low for a few days at least.
Steve’s smile took on a sheepish edge, and he sidled forward to join Rhodey on the couch. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, Buck.”
Toby looked as though he wanted to protest some more, but Steve wasn’t having it, ignoring him entirely in favour of pressing a hand to Tony’s back and coaxing him forward with a murmured “come on, let’s get you out of here.”
Steve placed a bottle of water on the sheets beside him before settling down on a chair, eyes scanning over him like he was confirming that everything was still okay. That Tony wouldn’t spontaneously drop dead or something along those lines. The shield was resting by his feet, and the glances he kept tossing towards the door were beginning to border on excessive, like he was expecting someone to burst in at any moment for a second go at him.
, gripping Steve’s blazer like a lifeline and pressing forward, trying to disappear completely into the embrace through sheer force of will.
No, it’s energy, it’s fuel, it’s a basic necessity, can be broken down into its very base components, can be
“It’s good. I can look at something for a second and memorise it. I can remember faces, and names, and phone numbers.” He paused here, running fingers along the seam between two couch cushions. “I can also remember the faces of everyone that’s ever died in front of me.”
not being able to calculate the exact amount of calories that will be in his meal, he spends an inordinate amount of time pondering whether it’ll be too risky to order gelato in a cup, just so he can cut down on calories from the cone.
Tony probably should’ve figured it out from the distinct lack of light that had been trying to worm its way under his eyelids as he laid there, but the realisation only hit him then that it was night time. The fluorescent lights had been shut off, leaving only the pale glow that seeped in beneath the door.
An hour crawls by. His muscles protest the hard ground. DUM-E wheels up to him with a questioning beep and stays by Tony’s side when he doesn’t move.
too close. Steve snatched it up before he could do so, and Tony felt himself melt a little with relief.
“Whoa there, steady buddy,” said Bruce as they exited the Quinjet, a hand curling around his bicep. He stumbled a little, footsteps clanging against metal.
Whatever it was, he could feel the dread grip him almost instantly, could feel his skin crawling, a shiver bolting its way up his spine. His stomach felt as though it’d been dropped from the peak of a building right into ice, his heart was in his throat and he could barely
“Well, you better start learning how to override your impulses, because I categorically refuse to lose you. And don’t take that lightly because I don’t half-ass shit. I’m stubborn like that.”
He scrambles toward the edge of the bed and stands up, ignores the sharp pain that twists through his head, the dizziness that descends down over him and the nausea that roils in his gut.
He swivels around in Steve’s arms, unable to keep from softening in the face of the grin that greets him. He leans in and presses a few chaste kisses to Steve’s lips, before letting them linger, letting his lips move against Steve’s in a lazy exploration of familiar territory.
Silence followed, but it was comfortable, filled to the brim with a sort of unspoken warmth. Tony found himself wondering whether sleepless nights were more common for Steve than he’d originally thought, whether he often found himself awake beyond midnight, planning out their missions right down to every possible contingency, positioning them all as well as he possibly could to ensure the least amount of risk.
“Tony. That armour...it’s great, obviously, but you’re still not enhanced underneath it. My uniform could’ve taken a lot of the impact, and my healing factor would’ve taken care of the rest. It was a split-second decision but I still stand by it.”
His eyes had a sheen of brightness now that they didn’t before, Tony couldn’t help but note. He wracked his brain, trying desperately to think up something along the lines of reassuring. There were no two ways about it - he had self-destructive tendencies, half of which he’d come nowhere near close to addressing. He knew just how deep they ran too; deeper than he’d ever be willing to admit aloud, never satisfied, not while he still had ghosts to make up for, or pieces of himself left to give.
make him feel ill, it makes his mind feel like it’s going to burn up with all the thoughts racing through it, an endless tailspin of panic and dread and horror that tangle up inside his chest, refusing to dissolve despite his best efforts.
And this isn’t the first time either, you have a worrying habit of jumping directly into the line of fire to protect me. Which is like, y’know, sweet I guess, but Cap.
Tony let out a loud sigh. He managed to keep the smile safely off his face as he directed his attention to the ceiling, following the lines between the panels for a moment. It was awfully plain.
Steve looked over at that, something like a smirk settling on his lips. “Oh, sugar, putting out before the first date? How’d a fella like me get so lucky?”
Tony folds under those words, under the tremble in Steve’s voice. He’s helpless against the way his next breath shudders and shatters and breaks apart at the seams. Shaking breaths claw their way up his throat, devolve rapidly into sobs, and all of the stress, all of the frustration and the anger and the fear and burning need for more, more,
And because Tony was weak, he swayed into Steve before he could stop himself, beat the urge back down with a stick. He righted himself almost immediately, but he knew Steve noticed. He always noticed. Great for missions, bad for hiding.
He’s constantly cold, and shivering has become a normal thing for him, something he can almost shove to the background. It’s another aspect of this whole thing that has sickening satisfaction roiling in his gut, the fact that it’s having tangible effects on his body. It
be satisfying, is the thing, he knows that on a deep, visceral level, he knows that this is all so painstakingly
been messed up, but he noted with a small hint of satisfaction that Sam’s had been too. Majorly. His hair was probably a bit tousled as well, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. The dishevelled look hadn't worked out too badly for him in the past.
He’d barely registered the words that left his mouth until they were out there, lingering in the air between him. Steve dropped his gaze down to him, tilting his head to the side in question.
Punishing his body for every time he’s lost control in his life, every time he’s made a mistake that cost lives, every glaring imperfection that stares back at him from the mirror, every worried glance that Steve sends his way, all under the guise of healthy eating, it’s just, irrevocably
Steve leans in again, eyes roaming Tony’s face like he’s getting lost, like Tony is something worth getting lost in, which is a nice fantasy.
Which, of course, was how he’d found himself in the common room at 2 am, nursing a mug of coffee and muttering distractedly as he walked the hall. He froze momentarily upon noticing Steve, who seemed to be sprawled across the couch, staring up at the ceiling with a glazed sort of look in his eye. In the darkness, every single hue was muted, and silvery moonlight streamed in through parted blinds, falling in pale strips across the couch. The part of Steve’s face that was illuminated seemed almost...well, ethereal, really. If he was going to be sappy about it. A palpable stillness blanketed the room, save for the faint rustling of leaves outside.
“Oh yeah, that time you walked into a pull door six times before I took pity on you sure was something.”
He didn’t say a word about the way Steve’s hands gravitated towards his wrist, towards his chest, or the distinct sigh of relief he felt against his skin when he must’ve found both a pulse and a fully functioning arc reactor.
But as Adam was growing up and was showing more interest in girls and his body was changing and Tony thought it was time to have the talk and show him that they were there for him if he had any questions. But he was worried how Steve would react or if he would continue to bury that deep down.
“Snooping huh?” Steve teases and captures Tony’s lips with his own kissing him softly and slowly. “But yes I would like that very much.” He answers before kissing his fiancé again.
“No!! Shots!” The brunette share a look with Rhodey who just laughs and shakes his head. He knows that if Pepper wants shots they are doing shots! So they order in tequila and they all know that they won’t be able to get up tomorrow but it would be worth it because Pepper would be happy now. She claps her hand and jumps in her seat as they share the shots in front of them.
“What was the fight about?” Steve wonders, knowing it could have been anything that had triggered David to a rage that caused the damage on Tony’s body. Tony at once started to look down at his hands that he once again had covered. The empty coffee mug stood on the table forgotten. It was quiet between them and for a moment Steve wonders if he maybe pushed too far and Tony would shut down completely.
But i can finally say that everything is under control and I feel like myself again and I do have my own apartment now, so it was worth it i think.
” Pepper just nodded before placing a last kiss onto his forehead and then they were alone in the bedroom. “Come here big guy…” Tony’s voice was soft and fragile like it would break any minute.
“Doesn’t make it okay Tony.” He holds on to the first aid kit harder than he had intended but if was literally the only thing right now stopping him from running out the door and hunt David down and kill him slowly.
He stood by the counter and considered if it was worth getting a bit late to work to clean up the kitchen. But then he realized that he wouldn’t a
Happy just shrugs. “He is my boss. I follow his order not yours.” Happy replies as he follows Tony to the car leaving David and Steve shocked at what just had happened.
“I don’t care Tony! We are two in this house! And soon I am pretty sure we will have pests!” Steve shouts.
“Yeah… It was a lot of things I stopped doing for his sake. To make him happy…” He admits and takes another sip of coffee. “Today was the first day in almost nine months I was at SI. I have worked a lot from home lately…” He stares intensely at the coffee like he was scared to look anywhere else. Like he thought that Steve would say that David was right and he should sacrifice his life to make David happy.
“Hey Tony. I heard you wont be coming to Nat and Bucky’s wedding. It wont be same without you. I hope you change your mind.”
“I am going to take a nap okay?” Tony mutters and gets more comfortable on Steve’s chest and Steve just tightens his grip around his small frame.
“You are so good for me! Such a good boy!” Tony praises and Steve feels some sort of pride swell inside of him. He was doing well for Tony and that was all that mattered. Tony thought he was a good boy. Tony steps back again and continue to hit him systematically ten more times, each time making him cry out in pain more than the one before and he could feel tears pooling in his eyes. His butt was on fire, his dick was aching wanting release and his shoulders were starting to hurt from being in this position for too long. He took a deep breath wanting to make Tony proud and finish this. “Good boy.” Tony place a soft kiss on his tail bone and the softness was such a stark contrast to the belt.
“I know! But I am working to you know!” Tony replies. “I have a business to run, people count on me for their paycheck and I am sorry that the house has been on the backburner for the last month but I have been prioritizing my job!” Tony moves past Steve and was on his way out.
“I am sorry…” Tony broke the silence. Steve looked down to his husband in confusion. A small smile was playing on Tony’s lips like he was reading Steve’s mind. “For not fighting harder… for not staying around for our anniversary… for not beating this shit I guess.” That broke Steve’s heart.
“I can get some drinks. I just wanna catch up with you.” Steve says, desperate to hold on to his friend.
and second I hope you enjoy this chapter I think it will be about two or three more chapters after this. Hopefully i can finish before Christmas but let´s not get our hopes up.
Taking generous amounts of the shampoo he starts to wash his hair with it and rinse it out before taking the conditioner in and lets it sit as he opens the tub of body scrub and starts to scrub his body raw from any grime or dirt that might have been collected there during the day, when he is done he is a light shade of pink before stepping under the spray of water that took the scrub and conditioner with it down the drain, then he takes a bar of soap and wash over his skin with gentle hands and made a few lazy strokes over his growing erection, thinking in his head that his entire body needed to be clean and that included his hardening dick. He rests his head against the cool tile closing his eyes by the sensation. He knows he shouldn’t… He groans at the touch before taking a final stroke before letting his hand move to the backside and finger push inside his hole, then a second to stretch him open for the plug that was waiting for him. He gasps as he accidently moves over his prostate and then decides to stay there for a while massing himself, making his aching dick leak with pre cum. He pushes a third finger in and increases the pace as he imagine it being Tony’s fingers deep inside him, whispering filthy things in his ear while doing so. He groans again letting himself come against the tile while groaning out Tony’s name. He turns of the shower and pulls his fingers out and takes a deep breath before taking a small step outside and took the lube and plug. He poured a generous amount on the blue toy before starting to push it inside himself causing him to groan in pleasure and discomfort. There was always that feeling of nothing could fit in there but somehow everything came into place, today was no different.
Oh that. He had been looking on a few before dinner… In Tony’s workshop… He must have forgotten to close it down. “I was just looking.” Steve mutters. He knew if he wanted to try a spreader bar Tony would get him a spreader bar, just like he had gotten him the collar, different gags, flogger and riding crop just to mention a few.
“Come on and sit on the couch.” Steve changes the subject because he would only be mad if they continued to talk about David. Tony obeys and sits down and Steve sits down next to him and carefully pulls of the hood. He is not shocked when he sees more bruising and a few cuts that may need stitching. He opens the box and takes out the antiseptic and cotton balls so he can clean the wounds and get a good look at them. “This will sting.” He warns and Tony winces slightly but nothing major. “So what did you do at SI?” Steve wonders hoping he still worked.
Tony hovers over him and place a soft kiss on his lips. “Absolutely.” Tony agrees. “You want some boxers or sweats for bed?” He asks softly, brushing he blonde hair back.
It quiet for a second to long before David pulls on the biggest smile and takes Steve’s hand. “David!” He introduces himself and Steve can’t put his finger on it but his gut instinct say that something is very off about this man. “You are the doctor right?”
“There is a support group at my church…” He begins. “If you would like to go there? I could come with you if you don’t want to do it alone.” He offers and Tony glances up towards him and down again not giving an answer. Well at least he offered and when Tony decided what to do Steve would be there for his friend.
“Such a good boy.” Tony praises him and smacks him one, two, three, four, five, six times alternating sides making him gasp out in pain he was not prepared for that. He feels Tony’s hand there soothing the warm area. “You are such a good boy for me.” Steve feels warm and fuzzy inside. He was being good for Tony that was all that mattered. “I will give you 15 more and I want you to count them for me. If you miss one we start over.” Tony informs him in that hard tone.
He was muttering equations, a way for him to prolong this feeling also a sure tell sign that he were close. Steve had been hurt the first time he had done it thinking there was something wrong with him but when he found out it was because he thought that Steve was too good at sucking and he would come to soon Steve had welcomed it and knew that he was doing something right whenever the equations came out.
Two weeks after Tony’ 31th birthday they welcomed home a three year old baby girl. They named her Maria Sarah Virginia Rogers. Tony didn’t understand how he loved someone so much when he barley gotten to know them. But god he loved her more than anything in this world. He promised her then and there that he would never be the cause of her pain and she would never doubt his love for her.
When they break apart Tony moves around to the back and starts to move the leather over the skin there, muscles rippling where he touched softly and without a warning he is hit over his shoulders one, two, three, four times, each one harder than the one before making his skin burn and him bite his lower lip to not scream out. The leather moved over his spine down to the perfection that was Steve’s butt. At least if you asked Tony. Two clashes on each side. “Your ass could even make a guy like me believe in a god.” Tony mutters as his finger traced over the probably red marks that lingered there now. “What is your color sweetheart?” He asks softly.
Simon he knew that name. There was someone in David’s circle named Simon. But he couldn’t put a face to the name but must be important since she named her son after this person. Tony realized he didn’t really knew Davids family and friends like he probably should when they where living together. Then again they rarely did things outside of the house because David needed his alone time and if Tony left the house alone it made David anxious so Tony usually stayed home with David or alone. For both of their sakes.
“No he doesn’t! He is busy trying to establish himself as a doctor! And it’s not like you try your hardest to talk to him when you see each other!” Tony replies trying to keep calm but it was hard when someone was constantly pushing your buttons and was certain that you’re cheating.
“I am asking you. Because I know what I would do to you and I think you know what I would do to you but that doesn’t seem to bother you. So I ask you again what do you think is a fitting punishment for this crime?” He didn’t loosen the grip on the blonde hair causing him to whimper slightly and his cock to twitch under his jeans.
“You know I can handle myself just fine. I always have and I always will. I am grateful that you want to protect me but you don’t have to Tony.” Steve says softly. Tony looks at him and bites his lower lip thinking about Steve was saying and wondering if he was right.
“Yeah let’s talk.” Tony agrees. “I am sorry that I haven’t been doing enough around the house but work caught up with me and you know that I loose myself in my work when I am on the verge of a break through.” Steve nods agreeing.
“Oh really?” Tony taunts again. He hears a loud smack and feels the burning sensation across his butt. A cane he thinks as he whimpers from the pain. “You should have considered that this afternoon.” Tony repeats. Another hit with the cane across his butt making him wince. “So how about that punishment? How many times should I use the belt on you? What is a reasonable number for disobeying my orders?” Tony asks voice hard and cold while he was soothing where he hit with the cane.
“Both please.” Tony just nods and gets up from the bed and goes to the closet and gets Steve the clothes he wanted and returns with the grey sweatpants and black boxer briefs in cotton.
There were days that were easier than others. But they were few and far in between and losing someone that close to you made easy tasks like getting out of bed in the morning near impossible. So he rarely did. Just burying him in the covers that still smelled like him and whishing it all was just a horrible nightmare. That Tony was going to be down in his workshop the next time he went down there.
“Tony what is taking so long?” Steve joins them in the doorway shocked to see the man he had heard so many horror stories about. “Come here baby.” He turns to Maria and lifts her away from Tony and onto his own hip before placing a soft kiss on Tony’s cheek and a look that let him know that if he needed him he was there then they disappear back into the kitchen.
“Tony be nice, you know how nervous these things make Bucky!” Steve scolded his best friend since high school and crush since college. They somehow became friends even though Tony had been a cocky asshole when he was 13 and Steve 16 and probably because no-one else wanted to be friends with either of them since Tony was so much younger and smarter than everyone else including their teachers and Steve was a scrawny kid with health issues, which would mostly disappear when had his last growth spurt at 17. He still struggled sometimes with his asthma and allergies but nothing compared to his younger years. Then when they went to college and Tony began to grow up, mostly into his body his mind was still a 13 year old boy. Steve started to realize that he felt something more for the younger man and the feelings didn’t disappear when he started to hang out with Rhodey whom he at once saw as competition for Tony’s attention and affection. Of course he would later realize that Rhodey is as straight as they come and was only looking out for Tony and was now one of his closest friends.
“Surprise me. I trust you.” Tony smiles at this knowing that Steve truly trusts him now. Something that he had to work hard for to earn and hoped that he would never break, but going on four years and their wedding in the upcoming year told him that he was doing something right.
“Maria it’s okay. Call me whenever alright? Tony can lose track of time so easily and forget about everything around him.” He lies smoothly hoping that Maria will buy this, which she seems to do because they are able to say their goodbyes. Steve rests his forehead against the cold locker sighing heavily. He was truly concerned for Tony. What if he was really hurt and couldn’t reach out? Or he was just happy with David and moving in together only strengthens their relationship? He didn’t know what to think or do right now.
He sighs. He should go he knew that he hadn’t been there in three weeks but he was not in the mood to get up at five am tomorrow morning on his day off.
“Yeah he did. He is surprising me on Saturday with a date. He said dress comfortably and good shoes!” She giggles but she seems happy Tony decided.
“What does that entail exactly?” Steve wonders and he can practically hear Tony getting panic over their staring contest.
David rose from the couch and started pacing back and forth in front of the TV pinching the bridge of his nose as if he was trying to stop the rage that was running through his body. Why was Tony always trying to undermine him and make him look like an idiot? Why did he insist on ruining their time together? They both worked long hours and at the end of the day he just wanted to come and unwind with Tony and not think about work unlike Tony who never stopped working and would talk about his ideas all night long. He was smart and he had to tell everyone about it.
“You will probably get a concussion but other then that you were lucky it could have been mush worse.” The female doctor tells him and smiles after stitching him up. “The stitches will dissolve on the their own and if you feel dizzy or nausea after 10 days you should come back and make sure it’s not something worse.”
“You know exactly who I am talking about Tony! Are you on your way to his place now? To fuck him behind my back?!” Tony just shakes his head as he looks at David.
“No you are staying at a friends house tonight and Steve will go back to work because I had it with you always arguing and never getting along and tonight I just want some peace and quiet.” Tony orders and begins to walk out to the parking lot where Happy had parked the car earlier.
Tony belonged to him and no one else no matter what his stupid friends thought or believed was the last thought that ran through his head before Tony lay down next to him again. David snuggles close behind Tony body and press sloppy kisses to his neck and shoulders.
Stupid Steve who was in love with his Tony. David thought bitterly and deleted that text as well. Tony just had to realize that he would never need anyone else besides David. And that his stupid friends were only trying to break them apart.
Steve who had never been able to say no to Tony on his best day was sure as hell not going to tell him no when their time together was limited to hours. He walks over to the bed and goes under the covers so Tony can lean on him, an arm around his now bony shoulders drawing invincible patterns onto the skin there, Tony’s head find its way under his chin. It felt good and secure, like nothing could take Tony away from him. But the thing that was taking Tony away from Steve was not an outside threat but on the inside of his body.
Again Tony smiles and ignores the glaring bruise that was screaming at him. Instead he goes back to his bedroom and picks up his phone and start typing a text message to David.
A small smile play on his lips as he reads the card again and again, ignoring the sore wrist that had a hand shaped bruise on it. Instead he went to the box and opened it and was surprised with a bracelet, it was a simple gold chain bracelet and nothing to eye catching but still beautiful in its simplicity. There was a small note at the bottom of the box which Tony picked up and read.
His partner whom he lived with and had been with for almost a year had a son he hadn’t even mentioned. No that can’t be right she was probably one of his crazy exes that couldn't let him go and just wanted to ruin the relationship between the two of them.
