He opened his eyes. It was fairly dark, just one small lamp on the desk on. His bed was empty and his heart started to pound a bit.
"Cas?" Dean looks even more nervous now. He should say something. "I am so fucking sorry I hid this from you. I promise I'll tell you everything from now on. Please, just... you have to believe me."
"No."
The line goes dead and a sob rips from Cas' throat.
"Yeah, he was. But I can't be that any more. I can't be around him and not want more. He made a choice, and that's the end of it." With that, Dean turns away and lays down with his back to Sam, hoping he'll understand that Dean's done with this conversation now.
-'See you then'
Dean leaned against Cas, sliding his arm over the back of his chair. He felt Cas lean into him, and lay his hand on Dean's thigh.
"I'm fine with it." Cas says, and settles back into his seat.
Cas continued, slowly, until he was completely sheathed inside Dean, then he stopped moving and just stared down at him. Dean took a few shaky breaths, getting used to feeling so... full.
Cas shook his head. "No, Dean, I-" but he was cut off by Anna leaning over and speaking into Dean's ear. Dean turned to her, and Cas inwardly groaned, downing the rest of his beer. He silently got up and went to the bar, ordering another, and one for Dean too. It was something they always did, whenever one got a drink, the other did too.
"Why did you leave? Why-" Cas' voice cracks. "Why didn't you say goodbye?"
"You should not be driving" Cas said, looking at her seriously.
The woman waved down Scott, putting 2 fingers up. He came over and poured the amber liquid into Dean's glass, then set another on the bar and filled it as well.
"I see that." Cas says, his voice lower, completely against his will. "I'll see you later." He tears his eyes away from Dean.
Dean pressed his lips to Cas' again, another shockwave coursing through his body at the touch.
"Don't deny it, and don't sell yourself short. You are fantastic." Cas hands over the box, and Dean takes it without opening it. "I think you should start your own business. You can work out of here until we finish building you your own space, but I know you can do it. I believe in you." Cas nods to the box and Dean opens it.
Dean's heart was beating out of his chest. His head was screaming at him now 'Do it. Fucking do it! You're gonna lose him forever. Do it. NOW'.
"Can you stay?" Dean asked.
Cas smiled back at him, and they entered the room further.
"What are you talking about?" Cas was confused. Then he realized, Dean's timing was way too good coming into the war room. Had he overheard him? He must have. Cas' heart sped up.
Once he was done, he turned around, looking into Cas' face. He saw something there, something that looked like worry.
"Much, thank you. Okay, there's food on the way because I assume if you haven't been showering then you probably haven't been eating," she says, then turns to look him right in the eye. "You really did fuck up, but Dean's your best friend." Cas pushes down the need to cry again, and just nods. "He won't be mad forever, but you're probably gonna have to give him some time. You broke his heart."
Also, can anyone clarify Timestamp is and why, for tags, some are just underlined and some are dotted underlined. Thanks!
“Cas-Castiel and you really don’t have to.”
It took the help of one large moose, one red headed hacker, one half-angel kid, and lots of online shopping (with fake credit cards) to pull it together. But finally a week later it was ready.
Michael is a very domineering personality but he and Cas are in a fully consensual relationship.
still an angel, so he couldn’t get sick and he could cure Sam and Dean. That doesn’t do much good though when people give you dirty looks for even going outside.
“Come on, Dean. You’re very drunk right now.”
“Dean, I can’t believe you did this all for me. Thank you. I-I don’t, it’s…” Castiel grabbed Dean and kissed him hard in the place of words. Dean got the message loud and clear.
“Sober up, son.” Dean became aware of the gruff officer standing beside him.
“Are you drunk, Dean?”
“Yeah. Next time you may want to lay off on the brandy.”
"Hey Cas." After working jobs at the hall for a while you knew everyone, even if only by name.
“Heya Cas.”
Dean goes back to Pontiac.
I think we need some space please forgive my timing… :) You see, I woke this morning prepared to walk on air but realized you cramp my style as I did my hair. You’re just not that same person, the guy I used to know. I’m not in love with you now but you seven years ago. You used to be a rock star, you were going places, and now you’re just a wedding singer. I hope this note is something you can rise above. Deep down you weren’t in love with me, you were just in love with love. And so it’s best we end this before we even start...
“I’m fine, Dean. One, you deserve something for yourself. Two, I’ve been okay all the previous times you’ve stayed with Cas. I’ve actually been working with this hunter named Eileen. She’s really cool.”
“Look, I know why we’re here.” Castiel interrupted. Better get it over with.
Cas launched himself at Dean. “I’ve always wanted bees! They are just so important and really cute! Did you know when they bump into each other, they make a little “whoop” sound?”
The lights of the station were too bright and he blinked as he was led to a chair. A cup of coffee was put in front of him and he was grateful that his hands were handcuffed in front of him.
(See the end of the chapter for
4. Vodka
“Like the gun?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I should tell him, just in case he doesn’t know.”
“The end?”
“Hunters?”
Dean gets married. Yippee!
“Oh my god! Yes!”
"...love is what I do!" Dean finished the last line of the song and applause filled the reception hall. "Thank you! We're the Wedding Angels, I'm Dean Winchester, that's my brother Sammy," Dean pointed to the man behind the keyboard, "And playing the drums is Charlie Bradbury. Now I present to you for the first time, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Hart!" The crowd clapped once more as the newlywed couple entered the room. "Robbie and Julia are very lucky to have found each other and have promised to stay together forever. I myself will be making that very same promise to my fiancé tomorrow. This next song is to celebrate that eternal bond."
“Morning, jailbird.” Sam said way too cheerfully as Dean walked into the kitchen.
Over the doorway to the library there was a sign that read ‘Happy Pride’ and on either side of it were two giant flags, a gay one and a bi one. Dean was pretty sure he told Sam that this was all about Cas, but Sam must’ve not listened and ordered the bi flag in secret. He appreciated it though.
"Say something." Dean says, looking at him with supplication in his eyes.
Cas pulled his head back, looking into Dean's eyes. He was a little concerned he may have crossed the boundary Dean had set.
"We're gonna go sit outside. You guys can join us if you want." Emma says, grabbing her bowl and walking away before Dean can say anything. He stumbles after her without a word, skeptical of his daughter's motives.
"What?" Dean finally asked, turning to Cas.
He stands there, leaning against his desk, just breathing. What the hell was that? God, it's been so long since he's been subjected to one of Cas' intense stares, and it's left him breathless, heart pounding. How can one fucking look do that?
"Damnit Cas" Dean said, before leaning his head down and kissing Cas one more time. After pulling back, he climbed out of Cas' lap and sat back in his own chair. His hard cock was throbbing with want, but he wasnt going to take Cas right here in the library, with Sam right around the corner.
As he got closer, he could smell fresh brewed coffee. Sam must be up already, he thought to himself.
Cas tried to hold back a smile, but failed, letting the grin cover his face, reaching his eyes.
Cas pulled back slightly, looking into Dean's face questioningly.
Dean is lost in these thoughts when he hears a wail from behind him. His head snaps up to look in the mirror, and sees a woman with a protruding stomach doubled over clutching at it.
"You know Dean. He doesnt ask for things he wants." Sam said.
Sam returned a few minutes later with 2 plates of food. He sat one down in front of Dean, and returned to his own table with his plate. Dean looked at it. Ham and cheese sandwich and chips. That was very unlike Sam, to not try to push some healthy crap on him.
Cas didnt return to the bunker for 4 days. 4 long, excruciatingly painful days for Dean
"I said..." Dean took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. "I said I love you."
Dean pulled back, looking into Cas' face. "You sure?"
The tears continue their way down his cheeks, and he forces himself to swallow around the sobs threatening to come out. He will not let himself break down anymore.
Sam looked back and forth, from Dean to Courtney, and back again. Then he nodded. "Okay" he said.
"Hey, that's enough." Dean says, staring them down. One of the men laughs harder, and they turn back to the woman who now looks frightened, shoulders hunched in on herself trying to make herself seem smaller. "I said, that's enough. Knock it off or get off my bus." Dean says, holding himself back from approaching them.
He's wanted to comfort Cas since he sat down, wanted to hold him or touch him in some way, but he's pretty sure the only reason Cas allowed it before was that he was mid panic attack and needed something to hold onto.
While he drives, Cas starts to wonder. If Dean's shop is over on Main, that means he's really close to where The Bean is. It's very unlikely that Dean has never gone there, or that he and Grabriel hadn't run into each other at all over the last twelve years that Dean has lived here.
Taking his hand out from underneath Dean's shirt, he slid it downwards, pressing his palm against the hard line in Dean's pants. Dean thrust his hips forward, desperate for the friction.
Dean tossed his phone onto the bed, then, thinking about, it he picked it back up and shoved it in his pocket.
Dean felt it. He felt the love that Cas had for him. He felt the need and want that Cas had to be close to him.
"Shuddup" Dean says, but he can't wipe the smile off his face. He pulls out his wallet and hands Charlie his credit card while yelling for Emma and Claire to come downstairs.
"Yes, I did enjoy that very much" Cas replies, blushing.
Dean nodded. He could still feel his heart pounding. He was used to waking up like this, but not with somebody else there with him. Everything inside him broke in that moment, staring into Cas' eyes, and he pushed his head up, pressing his lips to Cas'. His mind was filled with nothing but 'Want. Need'.
Dean took a deep breath and shook his head slightly. Then he reached around, wrapping his arms around Cas, and pulled him flush against him.
Dean looks around the road and finds a semi safe place to pull over and throw the hazards on. Once the bus is parked, he rips off his seatbelt and is walking down the aisle in seconds.
"That's weird" Dean said, staring after them. "Wonder what he needs her for."
Dean tells Cas that he can follow him if he wants, but Cas says his car should be fine there for the night and he can come get it tomorrow, so Dean leads him to the Impala.
Dean looks at Gordon's steak, and it looks perfectly rare. He can see in Cas' face he thinks the same, but he quickly takes the plate, apologizes, and says he'll have it right back out.
"No," Dean interrupts. "No, I can't. I can't see him, not now. Maybe not ever. I can't take it any more. I need to move on."
The cafeteria is closed, so they wander around until they find a vending machine. The coffee is shit, but he gets two cups anyway, and gets Emma a hot chocolate, and they head upstairs. By the time they do all that, and find the correct waiting room, about a half hour has passed.
Dean should be the one freaking out, really. In true Dean Winchester fashion, at any sign or word of serious commitment, he's usually gone. And really, it did scare him at first. But, it's
"Hah no Cas, Dean would never admit to his feelings unless forced. I have eyes. I'm an observant person. And I know my brother very well. Trust me." Sam smiled.
Emma sighs and looks up at him with a guilty expression. "I know, I'm sorry. Since she's coming over tomorrow, she was worried her dad would think it was too much."
"I freaked out, and then I got scared. I thought it was too soon to talk about it, but then I thought maybe it wasn't. Maybe we should've already talked about it. I don't know if you want kids, or want to get married, or if you even want to live together. And if you don't? I didn't know what to do with that. I'm scared that we'd want different things, and then what? We break up, or one of us does something they don't want to do? One of us would end up getting hurt, or both of us. But I was wrong. This, right here? Losing you? It's so much worse than anything I could've imagined. I don't care about your answers, because I can't lose you. I'll do whatever it takes because I love you, so much. Please, don't leave me."
After what felt like an eternity of just standing there, Cas could see the panic slowly fall from Dean's face.
Suddenly, a black smoke-like mist began to materialize in front of them. A disembodied voice rumbled through them "Castiel, it is time."
They found her already at the bookshelves, pulling out leather bound books, and staring at them open mouthed. "I've died and gone to heaven."
Dean was smirking now. "Good thing you took those shots."
Cas' arms gave out, and he collapsed on top of Dean, trying to catch his breath. Dean's arms came up around him, holding him tight against him. Cas could feel Dean's lips in his hair, and he smiled against Dean's chest.
He asks himself the question. Why? Dean has been amazing since the second he was thrust back into his life. He's been there for him and his daughter. He's kind and thoughtful and funny and beautiful and everything that Cas remembers. But, there's always that one thing, the one thing that happened that Cas just can't get past.
Cas gets a small smile on his face. "Have you ever seen the movie Heathers?"
Cas ducks his head, worry flowing through him at how Dean will react. He bites his lip, stalls as long as he can, then finally just says it.
After a while, Cas climbed back up onto his knees, pulling his spent cock out of him. Looking down into Dean's face, he knew he could never give this up.
"I needed to keep them safe. What are you doing?" Cas repeats.
"It wasn't your fault. Guys like that, they're overbearing and entitled and rude, and they walk all over anybody in their way. Unfortunately, I'm quite versed in that kind of man, and I've been in your situation before." Cas huffs. "You handled it better than I did, and I think its noble that you stood up for what you believe."
"So since it's summer, you can start staying here a lot more." Emma says to Claire. "Like, all the time. You should even bring all your clothes and stuff so you don't have to go back to your house."
"At least slouch a little" Dean snickered.
Dean didn't say anything, and slowly walked over until he was standing directly in front of Cas. Cas noticed a glint of something in Dean's eyes as he reached his hand out and laid it on Cas' bare chest, which sent an immediate shiver through Cas' whole body.
"You can get comfortable, Cas." He said.
"I'll be honest Dean. I didnt know what I was doing. I had some help." Cas replied, looking down.
it. But he doesn't know if Dean does. If he doesn't, what's he to do?
"Its nothing of import, Dean" Cas replied. He felt Cas' hands on his waist, then a second later he could feel his whole body pressed against him.
He texts Dean about it, and Dean says she's definitely welcome and that it'll just be Claire and Emma because he doesn't want to overwhelm her with too much activity, and they can do a big sleepover again another night, and Cas is thankful for that, because it's one less thing to worry about. He says that if Cas isn't cool with it though, then "Emma and I have plans with my brother that I completely forgot about". Cas laughs at that, and as nice as the offer is, he doesn't take it and agrees to let Claire go.
And it wasn't fair to Dean, because it's not like he knew that what he was doing hurt Cas. Dean was the kind of person that, if he'd known, he wouldn't have brought it around Cas. He would have kept his relationships away. But Cas knew that was wrong, and that Dean had a right to date and touch and kiss whoever he wanted. So, he just avoided the situation altogether.
He can't help the smile that overtakes his own face. "Hello, Dean. Thank you."
Cas leaned down, pressing his lips to Dean's again, as he lined himself up and slowly pushed in. Dean's tight heat enveloped him, and he couldn't stop the gasp that escaped his lips. "Dean, fuck you feel so good."
"Hey, if I told you, you wouldn't have come." Dean replied, shrugging.
When it was over, they just laid there for a while, tangled in each other, pressing soft kisses here and there.
Emma squeals her delight. "Yes, thank you daddy! I'm gonna go call her." She jumps up and runs out of his home office.
Cas stopped for a second, but didnt turn around. He sighed and took another step, foot landing on the first stair.
Dean turned around, and Cas could see the panic on his face.
Dean's left alone with his thoughts, and the hope that sleep will come soon, because he can't take much more of this pain.
Dean looked again into Cas' face, and, unable to control himself, he leaned up and pressed his lips to Cas'.
Cas doesn't look at him, continues to stare at the tv though Dean's pretty sure he's not actually watching it. "I told you I was happy you're here." He says.
Dean looked around his room, thinking 'what do I do?' He noticed the card sitting on his desk, walked over and picked it up. Pulling out his phone, he wrote out a message.
Dean nods again, and before Cas even registers what he's doing, he's pressed against Dean, kissing him. It's a grateful kiss, a thank you for being so kind and understanding and wonderful. And for making something that he will cherish forever.
"Yeah, we can go tomorrow when I pick you up if you want."
Dean nodded, trying to muster a serious face.
"I'm sorry that I'm such a shit person that you think I would do that to you." Dean said.
Dean turned onto his right side, and placed his left hand on Cas' arm. That's the last thing he remembered, before he drifted off to sleep.
"Hmm?" Dean doesn't stop what he's doing with the coffee. He needs caffeine in his system as soon as possible. And for Cas to just go. He got what he wanted, so why is he still here?
A few minutes later, they're passing the bus stop and Cas is pointing him in the direction of his house. Dean pulls down a long gravel driveway to a nice two story farm house and stops the car.
The drive back to his house is nice, peaceful, just the rumble of Baby's engine filling the space, helping calm Dean's nerves. It's been a long time since he's been with anyone, and he wants so much for this to work.
He got an immediate response back.
The front door opens after a few moments and a young girl with long brown hair greets Claire with a hug. Cas smiles at the show of friendliness, and both the girls turn and wave at him before heading inside.
Cas pulled up his messages to Sam, as Dean backed out, and typed.
The ride is nice, though pretty quiet, but once they're settled into their table at the restaurant and their food is ordered, conversation rarely stops.
Dean nods, breathing out a "yeah".
"Cas, I dont want to talk about it. I just want 5 minutes to be happy about what we did." Dean said, half turning around to look at him.
Dean's eyes are scanning the room, then come to rest back on Cas. He can see Dean loosen up a little the longer they stare at each other. "I want you." Dean says, then pulls Cas against him into a searing kiss.
He stalled as long as he could, but it was pointless. He'd told Dean he would be there, and he would. So, with resignation, he steeled himself and left his apartment.
Dean kissed him back, the adrenaline of almost dying surging through his veins.
"Rough night?" Scott asked.
“I suppose I could spend a few more days here.”
Dean waited by the beautiful altar covered in roses, Sam by his side. In a few seconds Lisa would walk out, in a few minutes they’d be married.
“Sammy wanted me to stop skipping class. Can’t say no to the kid’s puppy eyes.” They ran for a bit in silence.
Dean opened his eyes. “Cas?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I love you.”
“I drove her. You decided to take a cab tonight, remember?”
“Kitchen!”
“I’m sorry. If you don’t like it, we can take it down or just-“ Dean said quickly.
His first thought was maybe an obscure book, but the bunker basically had every first edition and long lost text there was. And books are kind of impersonal gifts anyways.
“So I'm going to go back inside and you're going to fuck off.” Dean knew somewhere in his alcohol muddled brain that he was being a dick but another part was screaming ‘I'm horny and need to drown my problems in liquor’ so he ignored the former.
Castiel shrugged,”I’m waiting for a call and I don’t want to miss it.” Him and Michael hadn’t seen each other in awhile and their anniversary was coming up. Michael was calling to talk about plans.
Dean let out a low whistle. “That’s the fanciest place in town. Dude’s probably going to propose.”
“I got it, Dean.”
Dean Winchester was gone.
Castiel frowned. “Come on.”
“Just enjoy it. When’s the last time we had a honest-to-god packed lunch?”
“Three days ago.”
While the officer called Cas, Dean put his head down on the desk. It wasn’t as nice as the car window, but good enough.
The rest of the walls were covered in streamers and balloons and there was a giant sheet set up so they could project the Zoom meeting that Dean had set up.
He knew Cas would be happy with whatever he got him but he wanted it to be absolutely perfect.
“Open your jacket.”
“Dean, guess what?” Before Dean even had time to answer, Cas continued, “As I was walking through town, I saw this garden and there were bees everywhere! Bees are such an important part of the environment, you know. I’m so glad there is a colony thriving in this area.”
“That is
Thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed! I’m sorry for taking so long to write this. I was busy and lost inspiration for awhile but I’m trying to write more now. :)
“Yes! Of course! We can even grow our own vegetables! Why did you set all this up?”
Comments and kudos always make my day!
“God, what did I do?”
“Get running!”
“Got in a fight with a guy who wasn’t taking no for an answer from a girl.”
3. Brandy
“You’re high or something aren’t you,” Cas figured that made sense, it would explain some things and Dean wasn’t the best kid, “and you have the munchies.” Cas gestured at the bread and peanut butter.
Dean heard the flutter of wings and he didn’t dare hope.
It took a surprising amount of work and planning, but Dean would do anything for his man/angel. (Not that he’d actually ever tell anyone that, he had a reputation to uphold)
“That’s it. I’m never drinking again.”
“No.”
The maitre d lead them to their seats in the middle of the room.
“Do you really think so low of me, Sammy? This was given to me.”
He said goodbye to Cas at the door before getting into the Impala, the kiss Cas gave him still lingering on his lips.
Cas was second in his contacts, after Sam, and all it took was a press, then the dial tone was ringing. Cas answered on the second ring.
"Maybe, if he ever asks me."
Dean had no doubt about who it was from. Luckily, the middle and high school in Pontiac were in the same building. He found Sam in front of his home room.
“Cas?”
“Holy shit.”
“What?”
Sam and Jack themselves were decked in color. Sam had a shirt that said ‘Ally’ in rainbow and Jack had changed his hair to multicolored using his mojo; they both had face paint on too. The map table was pushed to the side and covered in food.
“Good. I like it when you smile.” Dean purposely smiled wide and Cas blushed. “You know, I’m probably going to regret this in the morning, but how about another round?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hello, Dean.” Cas looked like how Dean felt. His usually messy hair was everywhere and looked like it hadn’t been washed in a month, there were dark bags under his eyes, and he looked like he was about to collapse. “You’re really not drinking?”
“What happens?”
“So you want my help finding a gift because you can’t have sex?”
Cas glared at him. “We were just making plans, there wasn’t much to say.”
“Hey, if you don’t like gym, why are here now?” Cas asked.
“Shut up.” Dean left the kitchen, he wasn’t actually mad or anything. (To be honest, Sam was right.) But he had to make a point, dammit!
“Course. What would I be without my angel? Need you, Cas.” Dean said but it was probably closer to slurring. He was no angel after all. “Yeah, need you this much,” he gestured wildly with his hands.
“Werewolf.”
This was originally supposed to be two chapters and have Dean go to Pontiac looking for Cas, instead of accidentally finding each other. Oh well, I like how it worked out.
“I mean, we have sex. I mean just last night Cas decided to try this thing called edg-”
“What?” He snapped.
“I’m the only relationship you’ve ever had.”
“I’ll be right back.” Dean muttered to Ava. He followed Castiel’s tan coat out into the cool fresh, slightly sobering, air.
“This is the end, isn’t it?”
“Did you know without bees the whole ecosystem would collapse?”
“You sure? ‘Cause I can go on. And on. And on.” Dean fell against the table chuckling. Castiel laughed brightly with him.
“Okay, we’re here.” Dean attempted to pull off the blindfold with a flourish, but it got stuck and he had to carefully untie it. “There.”
Dean realized what he said and froze as well but he knew that it was true. He did love Cas, and had for a long time. But Cas didn’t feel the same and his mind was currently going
“Seven, he’s so stubborn.” Gabriel sighed dreamily as he looked over to Sam, who shot him a glare.
“How many times did it take?”
Now that he was closer to him, Cas noticed Dean was swaying a bit and shivered a bit despite his jacket.
Dean knew he wasn’t doing anything wrong but he still felt kind of bad.
“Yeah, whatever. No chick-flick moments.”
“As do you.” Castiel replied. They fell into silence until the waiter came over.
“You look good.” Michael commented.
But slowly, Dean spent less time away from Cas.
Late that night, Dean and Cas were slow dancing in the middle of the room.
“Winchester! Novak! If you’re talking, it means you aren’t running hard enough!”
“You don’t know who Darth Vader is but you know about pinatas?” Dean grumbled.
Hope you enjoyed! Leave comments and kudos!
Cas clapped. “Thanks Cas, I think I know where this will go. You should be like a song writing coach.”
Dean worried then that he was pressuring Cas into pleasuring him but Cas assured him that he was comfortable doing that and found great joy in seeing Dean happy.
Epilogue. Also known as the Happily Ever After.
Although he wasn’t having much luck. Every woman who came up to him had something wrong, she was too tall or didn’t have the right eyes. And he knew it was unfair to the women, he was judging them based on imperceptible slights. Dean didn’t even know what he was basing his decisions off of.
“Pride, I’ve seen it mentioned on the internet. Apparently it’s this month?”
“I promise I’ll pay you back, -.”
“You said, you said ‘I love you.’”
Dean thought for a second. “Awesome.”
“Would you like some champagne?”
“Would you ever get married?” Castiel asked Michael, wanting to end the silence more than actually know the answer.
“Only because I forced you to watch the movies.”
“But you’ve said I don’t make good jokes.”
+1 Never miss a day again
“It doesn’t matter.”
He decided he was willing to brave asking Sam for help.
. I probably wouldn’t have watched it on my own perhaps, but I had an enjoyable time. I consider it to be our first date. You fell asleep on my shoulder, I thought it was very cute.”
“Gabe, what if Michael breaks up with me?”
By the time they were five minutes away, Dean was tapping nervously on the wheel. What if Cas didn’t like it? What if it was too much? What if-
Dean looked at the clothes. “I don’t do shorts.”
Dean sighed and joined the rest running laps. Cas ran a little faster to catch up to him.
Dean wanted to do something for Cas and there were only so many blowjobs one could give.
Ten minutes passed. The crowd was starting to shift in their seats and Dean was silently panicking. Maybe there was something wrong with the dress or maybe the hair and makeup.
“Not for at least another week.”
“We’re...going to keep bees?”
Thanks to my best friend who unknowingly encouraged me and everyone who has stuck through this!
Your pal, Lisa
Swiggity Swip, Twelve Year Time Skip. And this is a case fic now, yay!
So Dean left.
“Thank you for inviting me here, Dean. It is very fun.”
there was). Cas had his trusty blue tie covering his eyes and was interrogating Dean about what was happening.
Cas continued to babble on until Dean interrupted him. “You really like it?”
“Yeah.” Dean rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly.
Dean came up with the idea the way many of his ideas started, with a clueless, dorky, angel.
“Right, because that's the one thing you never seem to get: when you're not wanted.”
“How about a trial period?”
Dean heard Cas gasp and walked into the room to see how it turned out. It looked like a unicorn threw up, which is kinda what he was going for.
“Don’t be an idjit, you’re taking a vacation, you should finish it. It ain’t anything urgent.”
“Outside.”
“Oh god.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That you love him.” Sam whispered.
“That’s bro-bril-birl- a good idea.”
Cas basically carried Dean to his room where Dean collapsed on the bed.
“What would you suggest I do then?”
“I’m trying to write a song for Lisa and I love this place.”
“...shut up.”
Castiel knew he would probably never seen Dean again.
“Lisa’s your fiancé right?”
He spoke into the darkened room, fingers combing through Dean’s hair. “Stay?”
“You-uh-asked him to marry you and put babies in you.”
“Dean, I'm not leaving until you come with me.”
Later when Dean saw Castiel in Physics, he gave him a small nod of acknowledgment.
“Really?”
Dean sat on a bench that was outside of the hall. The party was over but he didn't feel like going home just yet. Castiel came out.
I meant to do this closer to the holidays but, oh well. Happy holidays and new year!!!
“You’re actually right,” Castiel’s heart dropped. “Because I think we should be married.” Michael dropped to one knee. “Will you marry me?”
They continued like this, long periods of times interspersed with short visits.
“Last name?”
“I’m so sorry.” She said.
Sexy times are here!
“Dean, what happened.” Castiel gestured to his arms.
“You’re in my physics class.”
“Give it a rest, Cassie, it’s never going to stay flat.” Gabriel commented from where he was sprawled on the bed.
The next day, Dean wasn’t in school. And he wasn’t there the next day, nor the day after that. His brother, Sam, wasn’t either.
Little cliffhanger!
(See the end of the chapter for
“Totally.” Dean slurred.
“Definitely should've done that earlier.” Dean said once they separated.
“When is your dad coming back?” Castiel asked quietly.
“Yay, I’m a hero.” Dean said sarcastically. “So why do I have a  huge hangover.”
“Yeah, the end of us dating.” Castiel sighed.
“I know who Darth Vader is!”
“You do today.”
And that was all fine and well, but Dean wanted to do something for Cas.
“Oh, okay.” Cas didn’t talk about it again.
“But I’m funnier in Enochian.” Dean surprised himself at his memory of the angel’s words.
He packed up his stuff, years of practice had him able to leave in ten minutes.
“You should go back to wherever you’re staying.”
“We have a case. Sam wants to leave early tomorrow. He sent me to come get you.”
he missed him.
Castiel looked as if he was about to say something, probably call Dean out on his awful lying, but they pulled into the garage and Dean quickly got out of the car.
“Can’t do that for me? Dude, you made me come three times last night.”
“This isn’t a ‘yes’, Cas. Just a ‘maybe.’”
And he was so fucking happy.
5. Flaming Sambuca
“You are incorrect.” Castiel was right in front of Dean and if not for their tense body language, it would have been intimate.
Cas suddenly saw Dean everywhere. Sometimes Dean would greet him, a deeper meaning in his “hello”, a thank you for the lunches that Cas definitely didn't get up early to make and place by Dean’s locker.
“I’ll take your word for it. So what are your plans, if you don’t mind me asking?”
“Thank you for telling me. I’m glad you trust me.”
“I wouldn’t say
“Well, uh, you always make me feel, uh, good. And you don’t like the, you know, sex thing. So I wanted to do something for you.”
While this is technically the last chapter, and you could end here, I’m planning a short epilogue. So stay tuned! Hope everyone is safe and healthy!
While he was walking through the war room, Cas came through the front door, arms ladened with groceries.
Dean was drunk again. But this time it wasn’t his fault! Sam had insisted they celebrate after finally finishing a difficult hunt before heading back to the Bunker the next morning. Sam had called Cas that they were going to be late and then they found the nearest bar.
Dean had gotten concerned when Cas never let him return the favor. He gave him hand jobs, fingered him, even fucked him with a dildo, and yeah that was all amazing but he never seemed to want Dean to do anything for him.
“You’re funny, Dean.”
The next day, Dean found a large paper bag taped to his locker. Inside he found two roast beef sandwiches, two apples, two bags of chips, two cartons of milk and a note. It read:
“Not for much longer! What are you doing out here? I thought everyone was still cleaning up.”
Dean wanted to snark back a retort, but this day was all about Cas. If Cas wanted to call him cute...well, so be it. As long as Sam didn’t find out.
Dean didn’t like stealing, but Sammy was growing fast and there were no bars in Pontiac, Illinois that would let in a sixteen-year old, so Dean couldn’t hustle pool.
“You do?”
I've surprisingly have had less time to write even though I only leave the house once a week. I wrote this during my classes and trying to write smut while your teacher drones on about Trajan's forum is quite hard. Anyway it's here now. Enjoy!
Dean let his eyes roam her body, quite obviously. “Hello yourself.”
So, like a true Winchester, Dean decided to avoid him back by getting very drunk and finding a warm body to sleep with.
He got a part time job as a mechanic, apparently being able to restore a classic car from the ground up was enough of a credential.
“Sure.”
"Why? Most couples get divorced anyway, like your parents."
“Wait, forgot what it is.”
Cas realized he’d never seen Dean’s arms and he may have stared at them longer than he should have. His arms were muscled, tan, and- and had long thin scars running down them. Scars that were way too familiar.
2. Tequila
“Who did you hustle to afford this?”
“Well,” Cas reasoned, “There are only two reasons to go to a fancy restaurant, to propose and to break up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I wish I’d known that sooner.”
They spent the night playing online board games with Charlie, Jo and Ash, Benny, and some other friends. Charlie had some video footage from past Prides that she played, and they watched a bunch of gay romcoms. Which Dean thought would be awful but weren’t even that bad.
We’re nearing the end, I’m planning on only one or two more chapters so it’s wrapping up.
He’d also hadn’t seen Cas in a month.
The coach threw a bundle of clothes at him.“Go change into your uniform.” The coach pointed towards the locker rooms.
“I’d do anything for you.”
“Why would he do that?”
Castiel took a deep breath. “I-uh-A few years ago, I wasn’t in the best place. And for a while I, well I took it out on myself.” Castiel rolled his long sleeved gym shirt up to show Dean his own scars. “But I got help. I’m now on medication and I see a therapist weekly. I’m not saying I’m completely cured, I don’t think I ever will be. God knows I still have bad days, but I’m definitely better than I was before. I know I cannot possibly understand what you might have been through but just know, I get it, if you ever want to talk.”
“I’ll take it.”
“What?! No! I don’t do drugs, this isn’t for me, it’s for my brother.”
Castiel fell silent.
Dean’s signature leather jacket bulged in unusual places, making Cas suspicious.
“Which reminds me, there’s something I need to tell you.” Deep breath. “I’mbisexualandkindainlovewithCas.”
“What’s in the jacket?” Dean jumped and turned around.
“I think I’m going to try it for a while.”
He led Cas out of the Bunker and around to the back where there was a clearing (or at least
“Dean?”
“Dean…”
During the car ride home, Dean kept trying to climb into Cas’ lap and he pouted each time Cas gently pushed him away. He finally settled for leaning heavily against Cas, face practically buried in his neck.
“I just can’t seem to get the words just right.”
“What?”
Dean shot him a grateful smile.
“Fine.”
They didn’t actually plan to go anywhere on the drive. But Kansas had a lot of random fields so it’s no surprise they ended up in one. They spread a blanket out on the hood and propped up the cooler. Their conversations were easy, the silences between them even easier.
"It said it wouldnt take me then. It said..." Cas stared at him desperately, pleading with his eyes for him to understand. "It said it would wait until I was really, truly happy. And then it would take me." He finished.
Cas reached behind Dean's head again and crushed their lips together.
Cas leaned down to kiss Dean again, pulling his shirt up as he did so. He pulled back long enough to yank Dean's shirt over his head, and toss it to the floor, returning to the kiss.
Slowly, as Dean watched, Cas lightly grabbed ahold of him, and licked a line from base to tip.
She looked at Cas. "I'll have the same." Cas did this a lot. He didnt eat, but if they were having dinner with someone else he would order whatever Dean ordered, and nibble on it throughout the evening. Then Dean would end up eating it as a midnight snack later.
"You didn't ask me if I wanted any of that. You just assumed, or thought of the worst case scenario. But you could've just asked. I would've been honest with you. I'm always honest with you."
Cas looked down at himself. "I'm fine" he said, matter of factly.
Dean shrugged. "Been sleeping well the last couple of nights." He said, glancing at Cas. "What about you? How did you sleep?" He asked, looking back at Sam, pointedly.
"What? How?" How'd she get out? Are the other chickens out? Cas is worried now.
"Oh yeah?" Dean says with a smirk. "What's that?"
"Well, somewhere around seventeen years." Dean says with a blush.
Dean looked at Cas "she and Sammy would get along well" he said.
He needs to talk to someone. The only person, aside from Sam, who knows what happened. His best friend.
No. This is absolutely different, and it will be good.
Cas could hear Dean's breath increasing, could feel his eyes on him as Dean didnt even pretend to be reading anymore.
"Cas.. cant... hold it... FUCK... dont stop!" Dean couldnt breathe, he couldnt think, he just felt.
Cas shakes himself out of his thoughts of the past, and back into the present. It doesn't matter. He's only here for Claire, and once this lunch is over, he never has to see him again. That thought makes his heart ache, but he pushes it down. He doesn't need that in his life again. A second time, he really probably wouldn't recover.
"I already told you, I'm helping. Unless you actually dont want me to." Dean replies with conviction.
"Thanks" she replied. Turning to Cas, she said "ready?"
Once he's showered and dressed, Cas goes to the kitchen and gulps down an entire glass of water, then half of a second, while playing over the events of the evening in his head. Their first kiss, their second kiss, Cas' confession, then their third kiss. The last one makes Cas blush, his body tingling with the memory.
"Hello?" He says, assuming it's probably work wanting him to pick up a shift, or maybe Dean checking in.
"I don't think so." Cas replied.
Its cathartic, working with wood. He's always felt so. He could get caught up in it for hours, just his body and the machine and the wood. He's sure this is how Cas feels when he's working on a project, and completely understands how he loses track of time.
Dean laughed behind her, watching Sam's face change from anger, to confusion, to concern. "Sorry Sammy. We had drinks. A lot of drinks. Thought it would be safer if she came back here to crash, instead of driving home."
--'Omg that's so great! I'm glad you worked it out.'
"Is it?" Dean asked, looking at Cas.
Emma turns her eyes on Cas. "Hi mister Novak. We'll be quick, I promise."
"Good luck" Sam said.
Cas reached over and gripped the side of the table with his right hand, biting down on his lip harder. It was taking everything he had not to thrust his hips up into Dean's hand. Not to reach over and pull Dean into his lap, crushing their lips together.
Cas basically jumps off the stool. "I can go with the girls." Then he turns and follows them into the livingroom.
The police escort everyone off the bus, and Dean explains what happened. Everyone who was on the bus backs his story, and before long the guy who punched him and his two friends are being cuffed and pushed into the back of the cruisers, for assault and sexual harassment. They say Dean will have to come down to the police station to file an official statement to press charges, but it can wait until tomorrow. After the police heard about what they'd done to the young woman on the bus, they're more than happy to let the guys cool their heels in a cell for the night.
"She assured me that nobody comes here" Cas whispered.
"I love you!"
He hasn't been out to get anything new in a couple weeks, so he figures there's probably a good batch of things out there for him to find.
"Yes Dean?" Cas asked, glancing sideways.
"Hah, yeah, no." Gordon says, finally looking up at him. "I'd like the actual manager." And he waves Cas away.
"Look, it's fine. I'm sorry if I snapped at you, I was just surprised and it's been a long day. I don't mind giving you a ride." Dean says sincerely.
"'Ello?" He says as Cas groans behind him. He can feel Cas bury his face into his back, and can't help the small laugh that comes out.
They sit in silence for a while, Cas unsure of what else to say, before the girls come into the kitchen. He looks over at them and notes Claire's face is red and she looks sad.
"It's a Southern Tier Pumpking. Pumpkin ale. You can only get it in the fall, but it's one of my favorites" Cas says, taking a drink of his own.
The restaurant is almost empty, Dean's three beers in, and he's warm and feeling really damn good. They've moved closer together, and Cas is pressed all along his right side, the warmth of his body making Dean heat up in more than just temperature. The man is beautiful, smart, charming, sucessful, and funny, and Dean is damn lucky to be sitting here with him right now. He says so, because why the hell not.
If Dean was being honest with himself, he really hadnt felt this refreshed in a very long time. His ass hurt a bit, but he expected that.
Leading him around to the bed of the truck, Dean stops and looks at Cas. "I'm really sorry I cancelled. I just" he glances at the tarp, then back. "I wanted to get this done before I saw you. I thought it would be finished by last night, but it took longer than I thought. I spent last night and this morning finishing it, and came over as soon as I got it loaded and showered, because trust me, I needed one."
"That was awkward as hell dad."
They make their way to the door silently, and Cas feels vaguely like he's heading to his own execution, which is ridiculous. Okay new plan. Knock on the door, hand the bag over, and leave. Don't go inside, don't participate in small talk,
Cas sat back, pulling Dean's pants down his thighs, and throwing them onto the floor, before following with his own.
Finally, Dean moves. He's across the threshold, pressing their lips together. Cas makes a surprised sound, startled for a second, before bringing his hands up and gripping Dean, pulling him closer. It's been so long, too long, and he needs this. Needs Dean. He pulls Dean further inside and pushes the door closed, backing Dean up into it.
"What?" Cas asks. Dean's not usually one for hesitancy, and it concerns him a little.
Dean kissed Cas again softly, then tucked his head down and laid it on Cas' chest, resting his body down on Cas'.
Sam uncrossed his arms and slid forward a bit. "What happened?" He asked again.
Dean looks to Gordon, and sees he's almost finished with his meal, that was supposedly almost inedible. "That was a bit harsh. I didn't think everything was that bad." Dean says.
For the third time in two days, Cas pulls up outside the beautiful white house.
They're halfway through dinner, the usual "how was school" "fine" "how's homework" "fine" "how's Emma" "fine" exhausted, and they're eating quietly when Claire actually starts a conversation, which is unusual.
"You ready?" Cas managed to croak out. He had to make sure that Dean was sure, but fuck it was hard not to just go for it.
He couldn't, because it hurt too much. He'd been in love with Dean for as long as he could remember, and had forced himself to push his feelings down. Ruining their friendship by telling him was never an option, but now he was ruining their friendship by avoiding him. This was a no win situation, Cas knew. It's not like he never wanted to tell Dean, and he would have if he'd ever gotten any indication the man felt the same. But, he hadn't, so Cas had kept his mouth shut for almost fifteen years.
Then Gordon had messaged. Gordon Walker, 32, single, head director of sales at some large company downtown. His profile picture was nice, a handsome man with a stunning grin. In his message, he'd asked Dean about his car, which had spurred a whole conversation, as Dean restores them for a living, and Dean was hooked. They've been talking for most of the week, and it seems like they have a lot in common, so Dean said yes when Gordon had asked to meet him tonight.
"Well go finish your talk. Sorry I interrupted, I thought you'd gone to his room. Tell you what, I'll run out and grab some food." Sam stated, taking a sip of coffee and setting the mug down. "Tell Dean I ran out and I'll be back with food. And that I know 'dont forget pie.'" Sam said, in a mock Dean tone. Sam smiled, turned around, and left the kitchen.
Sam stood there confused for a moment, before reaching his hand out and shaking hers. "Sam".
A man that Dean knows, very well. Michael, Cas' ex. The man who was almost the end of their friendship. The one who hated Dean so much that he took every opportunity to belittle him and make him feel worthless. The one who held Cas on such a short leash that, at one point in time, Dean and Cas didn't speak for months.
Cas leaned in, pressing his body flush against Dean's. He put his face against Deans ear, whispering "dont forget again" and bit down on Dean's earlobe.
They climb into the truck silently, Cas starting it up and pulling out onto the road. He thinks he's avoided Claire asking questions, until they're halfway home and it starts.
"Youre... not mad?" He asked. 'Please dont be mad' he thought again.
Dean shrugged, looking down. That answer wasnt going to cut it, so he asked more forcefully "Dean, what do you want?!"
He's close enough that Dean can smell him, coconut with an underlying hint of acetone, and Dean breathes in, very much enjoying it. Cas presses a light kiss to his cheek, and when he pulls back, he's blushing and it makes him even more adorable. "Thank you Dean."
"Jesus Cas, no. Nothing is more important than you. And you're perfect just the way you are. Shit." Dean looks behind him for a second then turns back to Cas. "Can you put your shoes on and come out here for a minute? I'll explain why I cancelled."
"Oh, umm, sorry. Didnt know you guys were in here. What's going on?" Sam said.
"Whatever you want is fine Dean. I'll take my cues from you."
"Oh honey, I know. Though how you could've missed it, I'll never know. Just like I don't understand how he could never see how in love with him you are." When Cas looks up at her with wide eyes, she smiles a little. "Neither of you are very good at hiding your feelings, except apparently from each other."
Running his hand along the side of Cas' face, Dean smiles at him. "More than okay." Cas' hand finds the back of his neck, and he pulls Dean into a slow and sweet kiss, before wrapping his arms around him, and Dean settles down, head pillowed on Cas' chest, content.
"What the hell happened, Dean? Where is Ca-" Sam started to say.
: I can even have Sam write up a contract, so it's all legit and legal.
Cas is on him the second the door is closed. He's pushed Dean up against it and Cas is pulling at his shirt until he lifts his arms and let's him pull it over his head. He gets the same back, and when their lips meet again their bare chests press together and it feels so damn good.
Dean looks away. "I know, but I was ashamed."
He's already left at least twenty messages, but he leaves another one anyway. "Dean, please call me. Please. I'm sorry."
: So, how about tomorrow? - Cas
Jesus, when had she gotten so good at using his words against him? "Haven't you ever heard the saying 'do as I say, not as I do'?" He mumbles, while resolutely turning the truck off.
Looking down at his book, Cas moved his hand toward his own crotch, stopping when his hand reached his hard member. Cas could feel his heart beating hard. He had no idea what he was doing, he was just going with it. He slowly started rubbing up and down, the way Dean had done, with his palm. It felt good. Not even close to when Dean did it, but it was still enjoyable.
"I'll wash em" Dean said, turning the water on. "You go shower. Your health stench is starting to seep through."
The friction was incredible. Feeling Cas' hard body beneath his own, the noises Cas was making into his mouth, as he unmercifully stroked Cas faster. Dean bit down on Cas' bottom lip, sucking it into his mouth, then pushing his tongue back into Cas' mouth.
When it seems like Dean isn't going to elaborate, Emma pipes in. "Dad owns a restoration shop, Winchester Restoration, over on Main."
Dean remembered, Cas' face was the last thing he thought about before he lost himself to the darkness. He looked back over at Cas, who was now covered in his blood.
"There was no cat, Dean" Cas said, tilting his head. This caused Dean to laugh harder.
Pulling away, Dean says, "I can't do this right now," but Cas grabs at him again and Dean whirls around so quickly, Cas drops his hand and takes a step back. "What?" Dean almost shouts. He lowers his voice when Cas flinches. "What?"
Heading upstairs, he peeks in Claire's room. She's already asleep, and it actually looks like she made decent progress on her boxes finally. He really hopes she gets settled easily, and knows that having a new friend will really help that.
Cas held a hand up, stopping Dean from moving any further. "I understand wanting to be there for Jack, but he is very powerful, and Sam said he could handle it. You jumped at the first opportunity to leave. Again."
Dean and Cas sat down across from them. "I believe we did." Cas said.
"He's not. He's bisexual." Cas clarifies.
"So, did you guys figure out your project before you moved on to manicures?" Dean asks, giving his daughter a knowing look.
Pulling out a couple of items, Dean turned around and tossed them to Cas. "Put these on."
Once outside, Dean sucks in the chilly fall air, filling his lungs and cooling his body. Cas still has ahold of his hand, and pulls him around the side of the building before stopping and turning to him.
Oh shit, Cas thought he'd only kissed him to get him to stay, Dean thought. Like Dean would actually do something like that.
Eventually, the doctor comes in and evaluates Claire, deeming her okay to go home. They start the release process, and within the next hour they're on their way home.
They stare at each other for a minute, until Dean can't take it and pulls his eyes away. "Oh, uh" he reaches into the bag and pulls out the sandwiches. "I didn't know if she has a special diet for after surgery, but I grabbed one with egg whites and turkey bacon so it'll be less heavy on her stomach." He hands Cas the normal one, then hands over the (gross) light one to Claire who gives him a quick thanks in response.
And it seems like Cas just doesn't want him anymore.
As Cas moves to get out, Dean suddenly doesn't want to leave yet. Just another minute. "Hey" when Cas stops and turns back to him, Dean scrambles to think of something to say. "If, uh... If you ever need help with anything, you can call me. I don't live too far from here, and I have a truck. She's old, but she gets the job done." He says, really unsure of why he made the offer but not taking it back because he means it. If Cas asked for his help, he'd absolutely be there, but he's not even sure why he feels that way.
Once inside, Cas stayed still for a few minutes. It was excruciating, the need to move his hips almost overtaking his resolve to give Dean time to adjust.
That hits like a punch to Dean's gut. "Oh" is all that comes out, because he thought this was going really well, but if Cas wants away from him bad enough to take the bus, then it must not have been. "Alright."
"Sorry, mister Novak, for pulling Claire away. I wanted her help on ideas for my party, but I should've asked you first." Emma says, looking contrite.
Cas felt like his whole body was on fire, every single place that was touching Dean, as Dean's lips crashed into his. Cas made a startled noise into Dean's mouth, before he moved his hand up to the back of Dean's head, pulling him closer and deepening the kiss.
By the time Dean leaves the building and is back to his car, he's fuming. Fucking asshole douchebag, nothing better to do than complain when all Dean did was the right thing. He's so damn pissed that he barely remembers the drive home, in a fog of frustration and dispirit.
"Winchester" he heard someone growl directly behind him. He whipped around, pulling the demon knife out of his pants where it was tucked. But he wasnt quite fast enough. As he stabbed forward, digging the blade into the man's chest, he felt something pierce his stomach.
"I'm really glad you're here." Cas says, surprising himself. But he means it, so he let's it hang there and just holds on until the doctor comes in.
"You can come too of course" she says, flicking her eyes to Cas, before focusing back on Claire. "It'll be great! We can set you up in the guest room so you'd even have your own space."
The man actually looks like his profile picture, and he's dressed nice. He's friendly and open, and is smiling a lot. Dean had read horror stories about people being catfished, so this is a pleasant start.
The possessiveness he feels overwhelms him. "Look at me Dean." When Dean opens his eyes, he growls "you are mine. You understand?"
Cas knows a string of incoherent noises are leaving his mouth, but he can't stop. It feels so good, so amazing, so
"Harry Potter, again?!" He mumbled to himself, looking at the TV. "That's what I get for telling Sammy to pick. I'm an idiot."
"Yeah, Jody is great. There's another one, too; Patience. Shes about the same age, and has been with Jody about a year now. They'll both be at Emma's sleepover next weekend." Dean says before shoving a bite of his ice cream in his mouth. It's half melted by now, but still fucking delicious and he can't help the pleased sound that comes out.
When she eventually wakes up, he apologizes profusely for not being there, and she tells him it's fine and it's not his fault.
"He did say that, Sam" Cas chimed in. He still had that pleased look on his face. Dean wanted to ask him what it was about, but he figured that could wait.
"That sounds like a good plan. You know you're welcome here as long as you need though, right?"
Cas followed Dean to his room. When he got there, Dean was already rifling through his drawers.
But, he goes. He goes through the motions, and the fake smiles at the passengers, and acts like every second of this isn't slowly killing him inside.
"This was not planned, I swear!" She's looking at him pleadingly, and he knows she knows better than to lie again after all that.
Dean grabbed ahold of Cas, and shoved him behind him, facing the smoke. "No, you cant have him." He yelled.
Dean's stomach growled at the thought of food. "Yeah, thanks" he said. Sam nodded and walked out of the room.
Feeling confused and disappointed, Dean figures he'll try one more time then go home, so he knocks again. After a minute, his shoulders slump and he gives up.
Dean sidled up behind Cas, getting very close before he leaned around him and set his plate next to the sink.
Stunned, Dean doesn't say anything for a minute, trying to grasp what Cas just said. "You're asking me on a date?"
Dean is biting his lip and watching him, his face covered in the most wonderful blush.
"No. I mean, yes he did, but that's not the problem." Cas shook his head.
It feels like seven hours have passed when Cas finally speaks. "I was hoping to meet Emma's parents today, if she and Claire are going to be hanging out. Where is her mother?" The question seems awkward, almost forced out, and a pang of uncomfortable sadness he hasn't felt for this in a long time washes through him.
Cas holds Dean as he cries, reeling from this new information, his own silent tears falling.
Cas was both a little annoyed, and a little impressed that Dean would use sexual teasing to get back at him for offering to help Sam.
Dean walked over to the edge of the cliff to take one last look, while Cas packed up the blanket and bags. Once they were stored back in the trunk, Cas quietly walked up and stood beside him.
Dean looks down and swallows hard before looking back up, staring into Cas' eyes. "I know. You know that Gabriel wouldn't have told me where to find you if I didn't have a good explanation. Please, just let me in for a few minutes so I can explain. Then, if you want me to go, I will and I'll never bother you again."
Sam looked at Cas almost helplessly.
Cas was stunned, he couldn't move for a second. What was happening? Why was Dean kissing him? After the shock wore off, Cas pressed back, deepening the kiss. He let out a small involuntary moan.
Cas looked up from his mug, into Dean's eyes.
Dean feels really good, and Cas is great. He can't help wondering what it'd be like to kiss him, if Cas will want that once this night is over. The way Cas keeps looking back at him is making him feel warm all over, making him feel things he hasn't felt in a long time.
He misses... No, he can't go there anymore. It's done. It had to be done. Everything is broken, and there is no coming back from what happened.
"Dont hand out what you cant take back, Dean." Cas said, trying to hide a full blown smile now.
Dean shifts on his feet, fingers playing with the hem of his shirt now that his hand is empty. "I guess that's it. I'm just really sorry, and if you'll go grab your manager I'll talk to him next."
“Come on, Dean. We’re getting you out of here.” Cas unlocked Dean’s handcuffs.
“You might have good karma but I don’t think Bell’s Whisky cares about that.”
Even though their near constant texting that made Dean feel as though he was right next to Cas, it was actually a little under three months before they saw each other again.
Technically Cas
“I know it looks like that but it’s not.” Dean was starting to think that this may be a bad idea. It really
“Baby! What are you doing here?”
Someone began talking to him, voice muddled like an adult in Charlie Brown, and all of a sudden the cool window that his forehead was pressed against was pulled away from him. He was practically lifted from the car and barely had time to steady his feet before he was being pushed forward.
There were two things that Dean knew: he was drunk,
“No, like people who aren’t straight or cis.”
And every morning after, Dean found two lunches on his locker.
Dean sipped at his coffee and by the time Officer Springly asked for Cas’ number, Dean was coherent enough to tell him it was in his phone and then his password.
“Take the bread, I’ll cover it.” Castiel clarified.
*singing* “You make me feel awesome. Like I’m the king of the world and you are my queen. Side by side, it’ll be eternity.”
“I know!” Dean’s voice sounded far away. That was his voice, right? Man, his voice was weird.
“Take it.” Cas blurted out.
“I guess we’ll have to make up for lost time.”
“Fine.”
Dean gestured for another round of tequila. He couldn’t believe Cas decided to come with him but he wasn’t complaining, the kinda angel was a fun drinking buddy. While he didn’t get hammered (so at least one of them had a sound mind), he got tipsy easily and loosened up. And he was a happy drunk.
Dean opened the note. It read:
“Dean.” He slurred.
It was a warm spring day that he was finally ready. He was slightly worried that Cas had figured out what he was planning but Cas was never that good at picking up context clues.
Wow, I can’t believe this done. This is my longest fic, and definitely the one I’ve put the most work into. (Although I’m not done! I’m planning on going back to make minor edits)
Castiel tensed and looked like he wanted to punch Dean, which would be well deserved, but instead his eyes shimmered and he turned, disappearing with a soft swish of wings.
Dean had thought it was just his fault, but Cas calmly explained that he just didn’t want sex. Whether that was an angel thing or a Cas thing, he would never know. Sam called it asexuality.
He was just about to leave when he felt someone sit next to him.
Hope you enjoyed!!!!!!
Cas’ phone rang.
“I don’t understand why I need to have my eyes covered. Am I going to be hitting a pinata? I thought those were for celebrations? Are we celebrating something?”
“He’s going to be fine. He just got hit awfully hard, concussion, bruised ribs and a broken arm.”
Leave comments and kudos if you enjoyed!
“Fuck yeah, I am.”
Across the room, Castiel Novak was clearing tables with his cousin, Gabriel.
This is much later than I meant it to be. (Which I know I say every time, I should really keep a schedule). This time it’s because I had to study for finals and stuff, and just procrastination. But I finally finished! And today is my birthday too, so finishing this chapter is like a little present to my self.
Cas followed him to the bunker door, which Dean opened for him with an “After you.”
Now for the sad part. "There were complications all through the pregnancy, and the delivery was terrible. She, uh... She didn't make it. They saved Claire, but there was no coming back for Amelia. She knew it too, going in. Told me that whatever happened, I needed to be there for Claire. Of course I would be, but I had no idea it was that bad, and I don't know how she knew she wouldn't make it. She just wanted her child to live."
"What do you want?" He asks her, and she just stares up at him making another '
Dean glances up at Cas, who's eyes are half lidded, mouth open just a little staring back down at him. Dean takes the head of Cas' cock into his mouth, swirling his tongue around the head and dipping it into the slit, and Cas lets out a strangled groan, fingers digging into Dean's shoulders.
"You were just a kid."
Dean softly takes the box from his hands, and Cas swipes at his tears. "Alright sweetheart, let's get her inside."
Cas nodded "yes, that would probably be wise."
"Its fine, come in. Coffee should be ready in a minute" Dean said, wrapping his head around what shed just said. Sam left a note. She was wearing Sam's clothes. Dean's many things, but hes not an idiot.
Cas sighs, resigned. "I knew Dean when I was seventeen, back in highschool. He lived here for a little while."
That didn't add up. Because, if Cas
"I know. I'd still like to have a typical first date." Cas said, giving Dean his 'please' look.
: Okay
Maybe, just maybe, this is what he needs.
Dean nods. "Sounds like they deserved it. I approve."
Cas looks down at the chicken, then foward as he keeps walking. "Oh yes, that's Lunch."
As Dean drove them back to the bunker, he pulled Cas against his side. This had been the perfect evening, and he never wanted it to end.
Dean looked her her. "I'm surprised you're still here." He said.
Cas laughed. "Nothing. I just like watching you enjoy things."
Cas grips Dean even harder and flips them over again. He pulls up to his hands and knees and angles himself just right then starts pounding into Dean's prostate with every thrust.
Cas pulls back from Dean, staring into his eyes.
Tears are streaming down Dean's face again, and his eyes are still closed, so Cas leans forward and very gently places a kiss to his lips. He pulls back a little and wipes Dean's tears from his eyes and cheeks as Dean's hands come up to rest on his hips.
Sam leaves without another word, and Dean buries himself back under the covers.
It took about an hour, Cas telling him which roads to take and when to turn. He kept looking at his phone, Dean assumed for directions.
She let's them know that surgery went well and Claire is still asleep, but he's welcome to go in her room and wait for her to wake up. Dean encourages him, says he and Emma will be there waiting if he needs them, so he reluctantly let's go of Dean's hand and follows the doctor back, listening intently as she fills him in on everything.
"Yes, well she insists that she can take care of herself now, so I guess I'm no longer needed." Cas says, but he's smiling a little so Dean knows he's not completely serious.
Dean nodded, and taking that as he was ready, Cas moved his hips back, slowly pulling his aching shaft almost all the way out, then back in. He did this a couple more times, very slowly, making sure he wasnt causing Dean too much pain.
"Than what, Cas? What the hell happened? Because I sure as fuck don't know, and I've spent a week trying to figure it out."
Dean turns around, and can see nothing but concern in Cas' eyes. Immediately Dean's shoulders slump, all the fight seeping out of him. "Because there's nothing else I can do. And I can't just not work." Dean says, setting the beer down and pulling Cas closer. "Please understand."
"I'm sorry Dean, you just seem like a chicken guy." Gordon says, with what seems like an almost forced smile.
When Cas reached Dean, he put his hands on Dean's chest and shoved him against the wall, staring into his eyes. Dean took a deep breath, then Cas crushed his mouth to Deans.
Gordon's head snaps up, lips in a tight line. "Dean, we are paying to eat here. They're being paid to serve us. If we aren't getting what we want, then they should compensate us." Then he turns back to his food.
"Oh yeah. I've had my fair share of flings." He replied, turning back to the car and adjusting something under the hood.
Cas looked down at himself, then back up at Dean. "This is what I always wear. It's all I have. Plus, this is your shirt."
Dean watches a fond look cross Cas' face, and after a moment he says "fine, but if you lie to me again..."
Cas laughed, pulling back again. "Yes, you do. Come on." Cas pulled completely out of Dean's grasp and walked around him.
This was the same bar they'd met at the other night, as it was the only one in town. Dean didnt know how Cas would feel about it. "Cas, man, if you dont want to-"
"I did." Cas says, but doesn't elaborate, and Dean can't help but laugh to himself.
"Shuddup" Dean says, but he's grinning too as he turns back to his own ice cream, which is actually a little disappointing when he takes a bite now that he's had Cas'.
"I hid something because it's embarrassing and I'm ashamed of it." Dean says, rubbing his hand over his face. "I wish I would've just told you, but I didn't know this would happen." Dean drops his hands down into his lap, clutching his bag as he looks at the wall. "I like wearing underwear. Women's underwear. It turns me on, and sometimes, when you're not around, I-" Dean sighs. "I touch myself while wearing them." Dean's face is red, blush covering him down to his neck.
"I meant tonight, dad. After we eat. Please? I really wanna try the caramel popcorn flavor they have, I've been thinking about it all day since Emma told me about it." She's practically bouncing in her seat.
The two stared at one another for, what felt like, to Dean, a very long time. Then, Cas nodded. It was very subtle, but Dean saw it. He also saw Cas' mouth twitch, holding back a smile.
Cas is staring into the bed of the truck where there's a chicken coop. It looks like a tiny house painted a light blue, actual windows on the sides, shutters and all, with little flower beds underneath. There's a ramp leading up to the door, and chicken wire all along the bottom.
"What?" Cas is still standing in the same spot, so Dean turns around and looks at him.
The second Cas touches him, Dean collapses against him and let's the tears fall. Tears of anger and frustration and sadness that he couldn't just fucking hang on anymore.
"We were talking" Cas looked toward the hall after Dean.
"Yes like that. Seriously Dean, I can see it. Why are you pushing it away like that?" She asked.
Dean adjusted himself, crawling up onto his knees to get a better angle, but never letting his lips leave Cas'.
"Gimme one sec." Dean says as he types out a text to Charlie.
"Excellent guessing." Dean says, unable to look away from Cas' profile. The pink has moved to his neck and ears, and Dean gets the urge to press his lips to it, see if his skin is as warm as it looks. He drags his eyes away after a minute, focusing on the beer.
"So, what do I do?" Cas asked.
Sam shook his head and took another long drink. He set his glass on the table and said "you guys are ridiculous."
Charlie says from the other end.
"No I'm not. We've got a job to do, so let me do it." Dean said, throwing clothes into the bag.
A couple of hours later, it was approaching time to go. Dean headed back into the library to find Cas, but when he walked in Cas wasnt in there.
Dean needs to make a decision, and soon, because he doesn't know if he can take the
"Until next time" Cas said, smirking.
"Thank you Dean." Cas said, his eyes roaming over Dean's body. "You look..." Cas paused for a moment. "You look really nice."
"It's not your fault, you couldn't have known." Dean says, and Cas realizes he must've been talking out loud. "These things happen. It's all going to be okay."
"It's alright, we had a busy day" Dean says, running his hand through Cas' hair one more time before slowly pulling back. Once the contact is gone, Cas misses it immediately.
"Man, guess I should've taken longer. Oh well, foods here. I got pizza. Come get it before it gets cold." Sam said as he continued to laugh. He turned around and left, closing the door behind him.
As he unbuckles, he looks over at her and she has a smug smile on her face. "Knock it off, and get out of the truck." He says, opening his own door and stepping out, bag in hand.
Dean just shakes his head. "I'm not sure what part of this is wasting my time. The part where I help you with something you care about? Or the part where I get to spend more time with my gorgeous date? Because either way, it's definitely not a waste."
As he came to stop at the end of the tables, Charlie squealed "Cas!" And jumped up, hurrying over to throw her arms around him. "I can't believe you actually came. It's been forever." She said, slugging his arm.
Cas settles at the kitchen table, across from Dean and with the girls on either side of him sitting across from each other. He doesn't know if this is better or worse than sitting next to him, because it's already been so hard to keep his eyes to himself today.
Courtney jumped out of the car, looking around. "Wow. This is insane!" She said.
Cas looked back into Dean's face, feeling the change.
Gently, Cas removes the rest of Dean's clothes, and takes in the sight of Dean spread naked underneath him. It is so beautiful, he is so beautiful, and Cas tells him, between kisses to his body.
After a while, he carefully untangles himself and slides out of bed, hitting the bathroom before heading downstairs. He's sure the girls will be up soon, so he'd better get started on breakfast, and coffee because that's a necessity for mornings.
"You never have to apologize for being happy." Cas said, leaning into the touch.
That surprises him, but it really shouldn't. Cas was always smart as hell.
He opened the door, looking out. "Cas" Dean said, raking his eyes over his form. Cas was wearing an untucked light blue button up shirt, with the top two buttons undone, and a pair of tight dark blue jeans. "You look great." He said.
Cas stood there and stared at him for a moment, before pushing open the door and walking out.
The conversation is light between them this time, and it is such a relief that Dean just let's himself enjoy it, makes himself not think about all the shit that went wrong in the past.
"Please."
Dean turned to Cas again. "What the hell are you doing to me?"
Most of the messages he'd received had been awful, some pretty obvious that they just wanted sex, and some downright disgusting.
Cas looks at him then, expression still blank, eyes distant and unfocused. "Thank you Dean, but I think I just want to go home and sleep. I'll talk to you tomorrow."
"Okay" Dean said. "Breakfast anyone?"
She nods, says she'll be right back, and heads off to the back of the restaurant and through a door.
They discussed what they were looking for, and got to work.
"Go ahead." He says with trepidation, because if she's asking permission, it's probably something serious or personal.
"Its not that" Dean shook his head.
"Yes Cas, please." Dean said, knowing what the question was. "I need it. I need you. Please" He leaned over and pulled a bottle out of his nightstand, handing it to Cas.
Cas moved his hands, so his left hand was holding both of Dean's wrists above his head. He slid his right hand over Dean's chest, down to the hem of his shirt, teasing at the edge of Dean's pants. Then he slipped his hand up underneath Dean's shirt, rubbing against his bare stomach and chest, as he continued his assault on Dean's mouth.
"So, you're repurposing chickens how, exactly?" Dean asks with a laugh.
Cas presses his mouth to Dean's neck, kissing and sucking on it until he's left a claiming mark that shoots possessive desire straight down to his cock.
Cas is smiling, Dean's smiling, and they're both just standing there smiling at each other for a minute before Cas says "So, I'm just gonna run upstairs. I'll be quick, but make yourself at home."
"Dad, this is Claire" Emma says, as Claire waves.
"I said I would." Cas replied.
By the time he's walking into the emergency room, he's a frazzled mess and is just barely holding it together. He tells the nurse at the desk that his daughter's here, and she leads him back to a room in the emergency department.
Dean finished what he was doing, closed the hood, and leaned against Baby one more time, before sighing to himself and heading inside.
After he'd dressed, he went back to his room and climbed into the clean bed.
He'd settled on dark jeans, with a black tshirt and a light blue button up over the top. It was nice, but not fancy. It would have to do.
Lost in his thoughts, he was at the mini mart before he knew it. The lot was empty. He parked Baby in a spot and went inside, grabbing a basket and throwing in random things he knew they probably already had at home.
Cas could see Deans eyes widen in surprise. Cas smiled to himself, knowing Dean hadnt expected him to 'fight' back.
"Oh, you're up" Cas said, looking at Dean's still half asleep form.
: I need to talk. You busy?
told her it was fine too, but you know how they are. Extremely dramatic." Cas says, and boy does Dean know.
"As a heart attack, Deano." Gabriel replies, now working on a drink.
Cas read the message to Dean, and could see a blush creeping up his cheeks. It was unbelievably adorable.
Cas ran his hands down Dean's sides as Dean attacked his neck again. Gripping his sides, Cas pulled Dean against him as close as he could. He felt like he couldn't catch his breath, and, as an angel, he didnt even need to breathe.
The kiss ends slowly, until they're just lazily pressing their lips together. When Cas finally pulls back enough to see Dean, Dean has a blissed out happy look on his face.
"Nah. Mmm fine." Dean said, closing his eyes.
Wasting no time, he hands the man the money, lugs the clock up onto his shoulder, and heads out to the nearest bus stop, hoping to have enough time to get started on it before his date tonight.
They sit in silence for a long while, and Emma starts to nod off in her chair, so Dean folds up his hoodie and lays it on one end of a row of chairs, and Emma lays her head down on it and promptly falls asleep.
Sam turned and looked at him, a mix of anger and amusement on his face. "Got it bad, dont you?" Sam asked.
"It's gonna be okay, they're gonna fix her right up." Dean is saying, and Cas slumps in his arms.
and adorable and perfect. Tears prickle his eyes, and he doesn't know what to say. Cas believes in him this much?
Dean has no idea why Cas is doing this. Hitting the on switch, Dean drops his hands to the counter and leans against it with his head bowed. "Don't worry about it, you don't owe me anything."
He's in love with Dean.
They make idle chitchat until Cas comes back with their wine, and asks if they're ready to order.
"Don't wanna talk about it," Dean replies, heading straight for the hallway to the guest room. Once there, Dean drops his bag on the floor and flops face down onto the bed.
"Good" she says, and plops down into a chair.
Putting the laptop away, he uses all his willpower not to go snooping through it. He's extremely curious about what Dean's life has been like, but he won't stoop to digging through his personal information without permission.
"Oh, I dont eat" he replied.
Dean grabbed the bundle of dirty stuff again, and made his way to the laundry room, throwing them in and starting it up. Once that was set, he headed to the kitchen.
When he gets back on the bus, it's to applause, which is very unnecessary but it feels good. He feels good. Smiling, Dean gets the bus back on the road and back on route. He's about fifteen minutes behind, but gets lucky with few passengers and little traffic and quickly catches up to schedule.
"Dean, I'm your brother, whatever you tell me, I will still love you." Sam said.
"That would be awesome!" Claire says excitedly.
Fuck.
Next, he went to his drawer and pulled out clean clothes. He made his way to the shower room, and just stood under the hot water for a while, letting it scald his skin until he was pink and felt the cleanest he'd felt in days.
"I understand, but I disagree. There are plenty of things you can do that won't have you dealing with deranged people every day." Cas says, hands tangling in Dean's shirt. "Please just think about it. I can handle things for a while, while you figure it out. You're miserable."
Dean led Cas through the hall, past his room, deeper into the bunker. He stopped at a door and they went into what Dean called their 'livingroom'. It was stuffed with a large couch, a recliner, and a flat screen TV.
"Your fucking mouth" Cas says, licking over the spot he bit into Dean's neck.
Dean stops, his heart in his throat, stunned by the words Cas just shouted at him. He slowly turns around, and takes in Cas' rumpled appearance, the bags beneath his eyes, the heartbreak on his face. "What?"
Dean's watching him with an indiscernible look on his face. It's several moments before he speaks, and when he does, his voice is quiet. "Do you still want to die?" Cas is sure he can hear hurt in Dean's voice, and it breaks his heart.
Cas just gives a halfhearted twitch of his lips, says "goodbye Dean", turns around and gets into his car. He's driving away before Dean can even move from his spot.
It wasnt enough. Cas wanted to feel every part of Dean, to know he was alive, to know there were no marks left from that horrible moment. This wasn't about sexual gratification, this was about feeling Dean alive against him.
The love Cas feels is beyond words at this point. This is everything he's ever wanted, and he won't let it go again. Won't even give it a chance to fail.
As Cas pulled his head back to breathe, Dean moved down to his neck, kissing and biting any skin he could get to. He reached his hand down to the hem of Cas' shirt, and pushed it up, trying to get to more skin. Cas leaned up a bit, allowing Dean to pull the shirt over his head.
Claire sighs, then turns her puppy eyes on him, as he internally groans. She doesn't use them often, so when she does they are quite effective. "Please, dad. This is the only friend I've made in a long time. I don't want to scare her away before I even have a chance for her to get to know me."
Realization hit Cas. When he'd figured out Dean had overheard them, he didnt even think about the fact that he'd said he loved him.
Castiel stands in his workshop staring at the wrought iron bench he'd picked up the day before. This is a personal project for him, not something he'll be selling or giving away.
Dean stood up, and took a look in the mirror over his dresser. 'Hmm this could work' he thought. He just hoped Cas liked it.
They headed out to the garage and climbed inside Baby. As she purred to life, Dean smiled. "I havent been out of the bunker in almost a week. This is nice."
"Wha-? How did that come up?" Dean said, looking baffled.
It's silent for a couple of minutes, the only noises the car and the chickens settling in in the back. Finally, Dean has to ask, because he's been waiting fucking months and he can't wait anymore. "So, chickens? I mean, you've brought some weird stuff on there, the door, the statue, the fucking toilet? What's up with that? And why chickens?"
The pain's too much. A part of him is gone, a very large part of him that he will never get back. He never would've thought his marriage would end this way. Hell, he never thought his marriage would end. He thought they'd been happy. That they'd grow old together, have kids, and grandkids, maybe great-grandkids. Retire, and spend their days working around the house, and their evenings curled up in each others arms, until the end.
Pulling into the driveway, Dean can feel the sexual tension ratchet back up, thick in the air. He puts the car in park and looks at Cas, to see he's already looking back, undisguised lust in his expression. They stare at each other for a few moments before Dean motions his head toward the house and they get out, walking up the steps to the porch.
Dean chanced a glance at Courtney, and saw a smirk on her face. After a moment, she laughed. "Funny." Then took a bite of her burger.
He looks back at Dean and can see the open honesty and hurt in his eyes. "I get it, I do. I'm a mess, I don't remember things, and get caught up. I've tried to be better, but-" he can feel tears prickling his eyes, and now is not the time for that. He's just so tired. Physically, emotionally. He's tired of losing people because he loses himself. Cas rubs his eyes again. "I can't."
"Wearing my clothes, Cas. Does something to me" Dean breathed out between kisses, as he slowly moved his hand inside of Cas' shirt.
Sitting on the floor again, Cas pulls another box toward himself as he thinks. Coming back to Lawrence was never in his plans, and it's starting to bring a whole slew of memories and emotions, most of which are not pleasant.
Leaning his head up, Cas placed kisses onto Dean's neck, anywhere that he could reach, wrapping his arms around Dean's torso. He bit down into Dean's neck, suckling on the tender spot where his neck met his shoulder.
When he turns around, it's to a sight full of beautiful man and his daughter, and he can't help the surprised "Cas" that comes out of his mouth.
"It's okay. You have other things to do, other people to hang out with. It's not your fault, it's mine." It hurts to say, but he knows it's true.
Cas is speechless. He believes him, how could he not with the proof right here. He didn't sleep with someone else. He has a panty fetish, which, if Cas is being honest with himself, is actually quite a turn on. Though he understands why Dean would be embarrassed about it, he wishes he'd have told him.
Cas looked on disappointedly as Dean downed the entire glass.
It's another few minutes before Dean gathers the nerve to even say anything, but he figures fuck it, why not, Cas already laid his cards out earlier in the night. "I, uh... I didn't really wanna leave you alone here, but I wasn't sure if you'd want me here."
leave and he
"No, he didn't. I figured that part out myself based on the story he told me."
Cas smiled, a small blush creeping over his cheeks. "I'm glad you like it, Dean."
Laying down on the couch, Cas pulls the throw blanket from the back and covers himself with it. Fuck it, if Dean's not coming then he's going to lay on the couch the rest of the day and feel sorry for himself. He'll pull it together tomorrow and get back to work, but for today he gets to sulk.
Smile falling just a little, Dean replies. "What? Why?"
), children's bikes decrepit with age, and so many other things.
"How long?" Cas asks, because it's important he knows how easy to take it.
"I hate you." Dean says to her, and she laughs.
Dean wakes up the next morning and forces himself out of the warmth of Cas' embrace, heaving himself out of the bed. He has coffee, skips breakfast, and kisses Cas goodbye. Cas actually opens his eyes and pulls Dean into a deeper kiss which, okay, that makes the start of his day much better.
Dean downed his last drink, and nodded. Standing up, he threw enough money down on the bar for the drinks they'd both consumed, then he turned and looked at her. "I'm sorry."
As Sam walked into the library, he said "Oh no, who is it this time?"
"What? God no. I wouldn't touch him with a ten foot pole." Understanding dawns on him. "Uh, actually I met someone else."
"Look at me, Cas."
"He wanted to know what happened to Emma's mom, so I told him, the shortened version of course. Then he told me about Claire's mom, and essentially told me I fucked up his entire life."
Once inside, they headed into the library, where Dean figured they'd be. Both Sam and Courtney were sitting at the table closest to the entrance, staring at them as they entered. Courtney had a huge smile plastered on her face.
Cas had grown so hard at the anticipation, it was becoming painful, until Dean finally grazed it. A loud moan escaped Cas' throat, right into Dean's mouth. This noise is what drove away any worries Dean might've had, as he grab ahold of the base of Cas' cock.
Dean watches as Gordon fills out a zero in the tip spot, signs the receipt, and closes the folder, and something snaps inside him.
"Oh" Sam's face lit up. "Well it's about time" he said.
Cas stands up and quickly divests himself of his clothes, grabbing the bottle of lube from his nightstand before climbing back behind Dean and running his hands up the backs of his thighs.
Cas didn't move for several seconds, breathing hard with his face pressed against Dean's neck.
Cas didnt say a word, just continued to wash. By now the dishes were both clean, but he didnt want to move. He was enjoying the closeness.
Cas blushed a bit in the almost darkness. "Sorry Dean. It just happened, I couldn't control it" he said.
"Come on dad, you can tell me." Claire pushes.
Cas will get caught up in something, per usual, for hours at a time. When he resurfaces, where before there would always be a text from Dean, this week there's been nothing. Cas has initiated most of their contact, and it's really starting to worry him, especially with the no sex thing. He wonders if maybe Dean is going elsewhere. They haven't exactly had the exclusivity discussion, but Cas assumed they were. Now, he just doesn't know.
Tearing his eyes away from the sheets, he looks around the small rundown one bedroom apartment he calls home. No. This isn't his home, and it will never feel like it is.
"Okay," Cas says quietly, overwhelmed with how understanding Dean is. His insides are warm, and he really wants to kiss Dean again. "Can we do that now?" He asks.
Dean climbed onto his knees, trying to get a better angle to deepen the kiss. He slid himself so his left leg was in between Cas'.
Cas caught the clothes and looked at them. It was another pair of plaid pajama pants, these ones black and white, and a black t-shit.
"Yes! Awesome." Cas could hear the relief in Dean's voice, and it made another twinge of guilt pull at his heart. "So, see you at 8?"
This is the last chapter. I havent decided if I want to continue it or not. We'll see if inspiration strikes me.
"You didnt send me any messages." Cas said.
Staring at Dean, Cas is hit with the overwhelming urge to be closer, be in his arms, kiss him again. He can feel the tension between them, can see in Dean's eyes that he wants it too.
The phone goes straight to voicemail again, and Cas growls as he slams his phone down on the couch next to him. He's tried calling Dean all night, and after the first couple times it was clear that Dean turned his phone off.
"I told her it was fine, and she even texted Emma and
"No reason to be sorry. That was... really amazing." He said.
"I find I quite enjoyed them. The way humans perceive magic is quite entertaining to me" Cas smiled, sitting down on the other end of the couch.
"Don't. Don't you dare say you're a failure or you did the wrong thing." Dean lifts his eyes to Cas' face, the ferocity he sees there taking him aback. "You did exactly what you should've done. You protected someone, and if your job couldn't see that, then fuck them." The curse leaving Cas' mouth startles him a little. Cas isn't one for curses, and Dean knows he's serious if he let one slip out.
Cas rolled his eyes and sighed, and Dean knew he'd won. "Awesome. My turn to get the drinks, be right back."
Dean smiles. His thirteen year old daughter is his world, but kids at this age are so mean. Emma is so much like her dad, she enjoys older movies, and music from before Dean was even born. She loves old cars, and spends weekends going to car shows with her dad. She'd rather spend her free time under the hood of a car than at the mall like most girls her age. All of these things add up to her not having very many friends. It breaks Dean's heart, but Emma never seems to care.
Dean moved his right hand down along Cas' side until he reached the line of his pants, squeezing his hand between them until he felt the bulge against him.
Dean's stomach flipped. He felt like he'd been waiting to hear those words for so long. He leaned forward and kissed Cas, with everything he had. When he pulled back, he said "I love you too, Cas."
Cas sat back and popped the lid on the lube, pouringing some over his fingers. Dean opened his legs wider, and Cas leaned down, dragging his fingers along Dean's crack and over his hole softly. Dean's body jerked beneath him, and Cas bit a smile back at how responsive Dean was for him. He use more pressure, and his finger slipped past that tight ring of muscles. Dean groaned as Cas pushed his finger the rest of the way in, working it around to stretch him.
Dean took a deep breath, and closed his eyes. It had been so very long since anybody had been this loving with him. In fact, he couldnt remember a time when anybody had done this for him. He could hear Cas' heartbeat in his ear, hard and quick at first, but as time slowly ticked by it settled down to a normal pace.
"Yes, I'll come." Cas replied, a small smile pulling at his lips. He couldn't deny that he really did miss being around Dean, outside of work.
"Cas?" Dean said, looking over at him.
Dean rushed to the kitchen, where he found Sam dumping out the popcorn machine, the smell of burnt popcorn filling his nose.
"Yes, Dean. I'll see you then." Cas hung up the phone and sat back on the couch, feeling the swirl of nerves and excitement that Dean always made him feel.
"You feeling okay after that?" Dean asks, and his concern about Cas' wellbeing makes him care for Dean even more than he already does.
Cas looked over at him, and shook his head. "He didnt say that."
"Hah right. That's why you threw a glass at me yesterday" Sam fake laughed.
"She was my dad's." Dean says fondly, watching Cas run his hand along her shiny black frame. "I rebuilt her at one point, after an accident totaled her."
There's a noise to the side of them, and they both look over to see a chicken, with dyed red head feathers, standing on the work bench, watching them. Cas laughs. "I really don't know how she keeps getting in here." He says fondly.
Dean ran over to the door, but when he opened it he didnt see Cas. "Damnit, Cas!"
"Because we should finish talking" Cas responded.
Dean smiled, and turned his hand over, grabbing ahold of Cas'. He pulled lightly, until Cas scooted closer to him.
"It still is a great night." Cas smiled a little.
"You, a gorgeous forgiving restaurant owner with high patience, beautiful eyes, and sexy smile, want to go out with me?" Dean replies, still a little shocked at this turn of events.
Dean: Going home with Cas. Don't wait up.
"Cas" he whispered, desperation in his voice, before he fell over and passed out.
"You sure? You don't look like you're having a very good time." Asa says, and Cas immediately feels guilty.
As he changed out of his jeans and t-shirt, he couldnt stop thinking about the look on Cas' face. It was a look of pure betrayal. They'd lied to each other many times, but nothing compared to the hurt on his face tonight.
"Of course, Dean." Cas says, another kiss pressed to Dean's hair. "I love you. I love you more than anything. And I missed you so very much."
"You want me to dress you." She said, grinning.
Dean shook his head, but didn't say anything. He hadnt felt this happy in... Well, he didn't think hed ever felt this happy. This satisfied.
"Again, what the fuck Gabriel?!" Cas is upset, and annoyed, and all around pissed about this situation.
Dean laughed, and looked at Cas. "Alright, let's go."
: Yes
"He did not say that."
"Dean, no!" Cas shouted behind him.
"So, Mister Winchester, I hear there was an altercation today." She says, eyeing him.
Sam snickered "mhmm yeah the cutest."
On top of that, the stupid chicken is standing directly in front of him, squawking. "Gotcha." Dean says with a nod, and turns around taking the last few steps to the car. It shouldn't feel this shitty. It was just a date.
Dean does all the talking to the receptionist, and Cas just stands there feeling useless and guilty. They take Lunch right to the back, and then he has Dean's arms around him.
She shifts around on the bed so she's facing him full on. "You're different people now, and you can't judge someone as an adult for something they did as a kid. He's a good guy, dad, and I think you could be happy." Claire settles back into the bed and turns the tv on.
It's been three days since Dean left, and the pain hasn't gotten any better. He's barely left the bed in Sam's guest room, only to use the bathroom, and even though Sam and Jess have both brought him food countless times, he's barely eaten. All he does is sleep, and even that doesn't make him feel any better since his dreams are filled with Cas.
"I won't" Claire says, and as soon as Cas turns back around she rolls her eyes at him. Dean can't help the chuckle that escapes his lips, as he gets back to making lunch. Teenagers.
Once Dean had finished with the rest of Cas' skin, he crawled back up and slowly kissed him. "You are so beautiful" he said.
Dean holds him while he cries, rubbing along his back, and whispering encouraging words into his ear. When someone comes up to the desk behind them, Dean leads Cas over to the chairs and sits down, pulling Cas back against him.
"Yes, that's probably a good idea." Cas stated, as he poured the coffee into the two mugs. He turned around, handing one to Dean.
"What?" He whispered.
Dean was saying the things Cas had wanted to hear for years, and he couldn't wrap his mind around it. Joy surged inside his chest, and before he could even think about it, his hand was on Dean's face, cupping his cheek. "I've been in love with you for so long." Cas whispered.
: Oh, earlier I was talking to Bobby Singer over at Singer Salvage and Auto, I worked there for a few years when I first moved back. Apparently he's been looking for someone to do his books too. Says he's getting "too old for that shit" lol. I may have told him about you, and he said to tell you to give him a call or just drop by anytime they're open.
"Right." Dean replies. He wishes he knew what else to say. Wishes he could apologize for everything that happened, for making Cas hate him, and for making everything so uncomfortable.
Dean nodded, and rolled off Cas. He reached down and tried to unbutton his pants, but struggled, the booze and tiredness winning out.
Dean chuckles a little. "I don't know how, I can't stand the stuff. I dread it every month."
Dean nods. He knows. He knows there was only so much he could've done, but it doesn't hurt any less. "I know." He says quietly.
That evening, Sam came in again. "Seriously Dean, what's going on? I cant get ahold of-"
Biting his lip, he takes a moment and then nods. "Alright. I have errands to run anyway. I can drop you off about nine, and pick you up when I'm finished."
Dean leaves without argument, because he knows the sooner he gets home the sooner he can tell Cas, and then it'll either be really bad, or the most amazing thing that's ever happened to him.
"Bitch" Dean replied.
Afterwards, Cas made his way back to the livingroom.
A third finger was added, as Cas swallowed around Dean. Suddenly, Dean's hand on Cas' head was yanking him off, as Dean's other hand came to squeeze at the base of his cock. Cas looked up, and Dean was panting. "Not yet." He breathed, voice already completely wrecked. "Want you, Cas. Want you so bad."
Cas growls against his neck and bites down as hot liquid spreads between Dean's thighs. That's all he needs, orgasm crashing through him as he moans out Cas' name, dick pulsing, come spilling out over Cas' hand, dripping down onto the bed.
Dean's hand made it's way to Cas' thigh again. As he rubbed, it made it's way closer to Cas' already semi hard member.
"Research, huh? Well, I'm suddenly a big fan of research." Dean actually laughed.
With a sigh, Dean rolls over and sits up so he's facing his brother, but looks at the wall past his shoulder. "I got off work early yesterday, and went home to tell Cas how I feel about him," Dean says.
Dean is desperate, desperate to stop him, to get him to stay. If Cas is dating... shit. "Can we please just start over?" Dean asks quickly, but he's already sure what the answer will be at this point, because if the answer was yes then Cas wouldn't be leaving to go on a date with someone else.
"I don't sleep, you know that" Cas responded.
Dean shook his head. "Its not like that." He sat back down, drinking what was left in his own glass. "And his name's Cas."
They were sitting at the table, and Cas was laughing. Actual, full blown laughing. He glanced over at Courtney and saw a genuine smile on her face. Dean had no idea what they were talking about, but seeing Cas like that, it put such a big smile on his own face.
Cas looks at Dean for backup, but Dean just continues to eat his burger, not even looking up or acknowledging their conversation.
"Dean" Cas whimpers out, as Dean sucks a mark into his neck. He doesn't know if he's trying to get his attention to get him to stop, or to keep going. Everything in his brain is firing in different directions, and his body is not cooperating.
Cas sighed, and moved his right hand into Dean's hair, slowly running his fingers through it.
"You sure?" Dean asks, pupils dilating with lust even more, until the green is all but consumed.
Cas moved his arms from around Dean, and grabbed Dean's upper arms so he could look at him. Cas didnt say a word, just pulled Dean to him and pressed his lips against Dean's.
"I dont sleep Dean" Cas replied, with a small head tilt.
"This isnt easy" Dean said, looking at his hands.
Extremely unlikely.
"Dean." Sam said, looking at Cas then back. "I think you should stay here. Jack and I can handle it."
Enjoying the quiet of the empty bunker, with nothing but their breathing, and the noises Cas was making, Dean didnt want to stop. But he realized how tired he actually was. He felt like he'd had no rest in a week.
Cas wanted this so much, but Dean had set up boundaries. Boundaries that they were about to cross.
-'He was gone. Came back after 4 days. I explained, he seems okay. We kissed.'
Courtney smiled. "Dont be. Go work it out. And here" she reached into her purse." Call me if you ever need to talk" she said, setting a card into his hand.
"Ah, yeah. Been there." Dean says, and Cas flicks his eyes back to Dean to see him blushing.
Sam shrugged, setting his fork down. "Who knows. So... You're not upset?" He asked.
"Castiel" the voice sends an unpleasant shiver of recognition down his spine.
Everybody who gets off the bus makes a nice comment, all except the man with the scowl, who gives Dean a death glare as he deboards, but Dean smiles politely at him anyway, and continues on his way.
--'you better text me back in the morning. I'm dying here.'
"Okay." Dean nodded. "Okay. Then I guess we'll... set something up."
On the drive back to Cas', Dean feels really good. A kind of good he hasn't felt in so damn long, and he realizes he's having fun. This is fun. It's a really nice feeling, and Dean doesn't want it to stop.
"What do I do?" He asks her. She stares at him for a minute before giving him a serious '
"Chickens." Dean responds, not looking up.
He's really fucked up, and has waited way too long to fix it. Or even try to fix it. He's sure Dean's done, even though he still sends his morning text every day, but now Cas is sure it's just because he was so attached to Lunch. He cares about her.
"Cas, talk to me." When did Dean get so close? Cas could feel him, right behind him, his body a solid mass of warmth along his back. Cas wanted to yell and cry at the same time.
When he'd first seen it, it spoke to him. Rusted black metal, swirling designs through the armrests. But it's the backrest that really drew him in, made him feel connected. A design of feathers, intertwining throughout each other so they look as if they're floating, spinning and twirling around each other.
Cas flipped through netflix, putting something random on that he didnt really care about. He honestly just wanted to get lost in his thoughts. His thoughts about Dean.
"I dont get out much." She replied, taking a swig from her own glass. "Just needed a night to unwind and forget my troubles"
Cas nodded. "Well, when you figure it out, come find me". He started to turn toward the doorway.
Dean held himself still, resisting every urge to thrust his hips up. He felt Cas' hands grab ahold of his hips, pulling him closer.
Normally, Cas is the distant one. He doesn't mean to be, but he gets so caught up in his work that sometimes a half day goes by before he replies to Dean's texts, but Dean is always fast to respond.
"We hunt monsters." Cas said.
Unable to process what he'd just done, Dean grabbed his coat and keys, and walked out of his room. Cas was still standing outside his door, so Dean rushed past him and down the hall toward the garage, not saying a word.
These are clearly people that know Dean well, and respect his opinion, and Cas is really wondering why Dean would put his neck on the line for him when he's only seen a tiny portion of the work he can do.
Dean's hand continued down, now only centimeters from the off limits zone.
Dean nodded. "That's why I told you this time. I wanna be honest with you. I dont want her, but its... nice. To talk to somebody. About things." Dean didnt know if he was making any sense.
It was several minutes later when Dean returned, which wasn't a surprise as the bar had gotten quite busy by then. A beer and a shot glass were set in front of him, and he looked up into Dean's smiling face.
"I don't want to see him."
"Shit" Dean jumped up off the stool and pushed around Courtney. "Cas?"
Dean let off a nervous laugh. "Seems so. You guys got here quick. How did you know?"
They all ate in silence for several minutes, before Cas said "Dean I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything."
He found Dean down a far aisle, on the floor and covered in blood, a knife protruding from his stomach.
"What? No I'm not." Dean replied, stepping toward Cas again.
When Dean looks back at Gordon, Gordon rolls his eyes. "It's always hard to get a steak cooked right."
Dean moaned and thew his head back. He closed his eyes and felt the most amazing hot wet feeling envelope his straining cock.
"Hello. Nice to meet you" Courtney said, still staring at Sam. Suddenly she burst out laughing, doubling over to hold her stomach. After a minute, she stood up, wiping tears from her eyes. "Oh my god, I'm so sorry. You just look so serious!"
"Shut up" Dean said, not even looking at Sam. He slid a box of pizza toward himself and set a couple pieces onto his plate.
Cas shook his head. "I don't know that song." He said quietly.
Cas stares at him for a minute, and then another minute, and then he shrugs with his hands spread out in front of him and says "I just need time, Dean." And then he's down the steps and to his truck and Dean doesn't even know what to make of that.
"You alright?" Dean asks.
"Shes really great. We stayed up half the night talking and drinking. She has some great stories. And shes smart. Like, really smart, Dean. I didnt plan on, you know, but it just sort of happened."
"You can't always be there, things are gonna happen that are out of your control. That does not, nor will it ever, make you a bad father. She's gonna be fine, and you're here now and that's what's important."
He knows that it's probably not right, that this is putting too much pressure on Dean, but when Dean grabs him and pulls him into a hug, he can't help but feel warmed by it.
He walks over to the sliding glass door and opens it, stepping out onto the back deck. As soon as he steps out, that damn chicken is back. The same little fucker who kept following him out front.
Dean started to thrust his hips, knowing Cas wasnt going to stop, so he might as well embrace it.
Though that was kind of true, his voice didn't compare to Dean's. And it was embarrassing, getting up there in front of all those people. He'd been considering taking off anyway, as he'd come here to spend time with Dean, and that obviously wasn't happening, so maybe this was as good a time as any.
He updates them on Claire and says she's healing well and they've told them she should be able to go home today but she won't be back in school for at least a few days. Emma promises to get her work for her, and yet again Cas is so grateful they're in their lives.
Cas didn't know how much longer he would last. The feeling Dean was giving him, his body pressed against him, his hard cock rubbing against his leg, and his hand wrapped around his cock moving at a quick pace, it was all too much.
"Just... let me go Sammy. Please. I need to." Dean said quietly.
"Cas, wait!" Dean threw his hand forward, grabbing ahold of Cas' arm. "I wasnt going to see her. I just... Wanted to talk to somebody, other than Sam. Somebody who wasnt invested in this like he is."
Cas is sitting in a chair with his head in his hands when they walk in. They approach, and Dean says "Cas?" quietly.
"Oh my god, this is weird." Emma says. "I was just telling Claire about this place today. I couldn't get rid of the craving until I had some." Emma says, looking innocent as ever.
Dean stayed in bed a while longer, but he set the bottle of liquor on the floor and didnt drink from it again.
"Sure Cas, sounds fine." Dean said.
So, in a reverse of last weekend, Dean follows him onto the porch. He says "Cas" and when Cas turns around to look at him from the top of the steps, he says "do you need anything?" And he doesn't know if he means physically, or emotionally, or relatively, but he probably means them all and just wants to give Cas whatever he needs.
Dean grabbed Cas' hand and rushed them from the room. He made it to the hall before he had to stop and lean against the wall. The laughter had taken over again.
"I should've been here as soon as you called." Cas can hear himself say, voice muffled. "I should've... the restaurant was loud and I didn't even know my phone had rung until I got my wallet out. It's no excuse, I should've been here. She was in pain before she left but she said it was cramps and she was fine. I should've made her stay home. I should've known something else was wrong." He's rambling and he doesn't even care because he feels like shit.
A little while later, Cas insists they leave to get some sleep because Claire needs to sleep anyway. Dean agrees, and Emma fights it until Claire is yawning, eyelids drooping, and she finally relents.
-'I cant'
"It was a long time ago." He can hear the pleading in his own voice. The desperation for Cas to just
"No, you're not doing anything wrong. Theres something wrong with me. I'm trying so hard to control this, but at times it creeps in before I know what's happening." Dean replied.
"You're a major space case, and that usually means something happened. So what is it? Dean tearing down on you hard again?"
"It wouldnt have been your fault" is of course Dean's reply, because the self sacrificing beautiful man can't see that there was nothing he could've done that wouldn't have caused Cas pain. He had to make a decision, and made the best possible one he could at the time.
"I thought you might be getting hungry" Cas shrugged.
"Ahh. Still didn't know. So what the hel- eck happened?" Claire asks.
"Hmm?" Dean says. "Oh, yeah, I heard." He wipes his hands off, and looks at Emma.
"You look uncomfortable Dean. You should relax a little" he said, smiling, throwing Dean's words back at him.
Kissing him, Dean pulled on Cas' arm harder, wanting him back on top of him.
"Better?" Dean asked, with a smile in his voice.
Dean stepped foward again. Cas was trapped. He supposed he could have pushed past Dean, and doubted Dean would stop him, but he didn't.
Cas gathers himself, and forces his own smile. "Yes, that's fine. We're happy to have you." He says, and is proud of how steady his voice is.
"I threw it past you." Dean muttered, taking another drink.
Attempting to calm himself, Dean opened his eyes and looked around his room.
"What's wrong?" He asked.
As Dean collected his clothes from his room, and proceeded on to the shower room to get cleaned up, Cas stood in the kitchen for short while thinking about what just happened. He was very happy, but that worried feeling kept nagging a hole in his stomach.
They laid like that for a while before Dean started to doze off.
Dean brought his hand up, resting it on the back of Cas' neck. He leaned his head forward until his forehead was pressed against Cas'.
Dean held his hand out to stop Cas from coming any closer. "Just, give me a second, okay?"
Dean smiled then, and leaned forward, pressing a light kiss to Cas' lips. "You're amazing" he whispered, pulling back.
"Dean, you couldn't help what happened." She says grabbing his hand. "There's nothing you could've done that wouldn't have ended poorly. You just took the option that resulted in the least amount of pain."
Cas held the bottle between his fingers for a moment, warming it up. He wanted to make this as comfortable for Dean as possible.
Without a word, Cas grabbed Dean by the ass and lifted him up against himself, setting him on the desk.
"Well, I figure either you're lying to scare me away" she said, staring at Cas. "Or you're telling the truth to scare me away."
Cas rolls his hips, and an unbidden groan escapes Dean when their erections meet. His hands tighten on Cas' hips even more, urging him to do it again, and when he does, pleasure courses through Dean's body.
Warning: explicit sexual content
The girls are looking at each other and grinning, and Dean turns back to grab the food with his own smile on his face. He lays the plates full of food out on the table, then takes his own seat.
Courtney and Cas followed suit, clinking their glasses together and downing the shot.
After a moment, Dean's stomach growled. Cas stood back up straight and turned around. "You're hungry."
Dean ground down again, desperate for more friction. Cas thrust his hips up, giving Dean what he wanted.
When Charlie arrives through the still unlocked door, she takes one look at Cas, drops down onto the couch next to him, and pulls him into a hug.
Dean hesitates, but when Cas doesn't say anything else, he nods back once and leaves around the side of the house.
Emma sighs. "I was just talking about my new friend Claire. She just moved here, and she's awesome."
"Wow, that's really admirable." Cas says.
Cas wakes slowly from his doze, and stares down at the top of Dean's head. He's warm and fulfilled, couldn't be happier.
Cas closed his eyes again, feeling Dean's closeness with every sense he had.
He stepped closer to Cas, hooking his thumbs into the waistband of his pants, and slid them down. Cas stepped out of them. Then Dean did the same to his own, until they were both standing there in nothing but their underwear.
"What the hell, Dean?!" Sam said, then left.
Dean shook himself mentally. "What? Oh, I was just complaining about the movie Sam picked."
Once Dean was safely in the Impala, he took a deep steadying breath, started the car, and pulled out of the garage.
Dean gripped tight to Cas' hand as he felt him moving inside him. Slowly, the pain faded away, and was replaced by pleasure.
"Okay." Cas says quietly.
Cas reached down and slid his own bottoms off, exposing the rest of himself, and throwing them to the floor as well.
Dean deepened the kiss, using his other hand to cup Cas' face and tilt his head back.
Dean woke up slowly. With his eyes still closed, he felt around next to him, searching for Cas, but finding nothing.
Only one part of that stuck out. "Your shop?"
When he pulled back, Cas looked at Dean and nodded. "Okay" he said.
Suddenly there was a noise, and both jumped apart to look at the doorway, attempting to look casual.
'This is nice. Really nice.' Dean thought to himself.
Cas slowly walked towards Dean, with a look on his face that could frighten the most powerful of creatures. Dean stood there immobile, not sure what was coming. Did he piss Cas off that much?
"The only person worth talking to in the hell they call school around here." Claire replies with snark.
He's fucking forward into Cas' fist, and back as Cas' cock runs between his legs, over his perineum, catching on his hole, and the extra stimulation has Dean rocketing toward the end quickly.
