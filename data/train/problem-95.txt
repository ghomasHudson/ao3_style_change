With that, John began to stroke harder, latching onto one of Sherlock’s nipples and sucking it while laving his tongue over the hardening nipple in the way he knew Sherlock loved.
But John stepped forward and knocked the large bin away with an easy swing in midair, and Sherlock watched the muscles flex beneath his think jumper at the movement while the trash bin hit the brick wall with a clang.
John walked in a few moments later, and seeing Sherlock’s sheet-clad body, his arousal, so long ignored, began to swell.
She couldn’t be any older than nineteen in the depiction, and without realizing, John stepped closer to examine the curious features of the girl.
The corset was an emerald green, bringing out the green in his eyes as he stared at himself in the large mirror.
John flipped open the box and unceremoniously poured the contents out on the bed, and Sherlock turned his head away, releasing a breathe he hadn’t realized he was holding.
Pushing the first one in, and not getting a reaction from the overwhelmed detective, he pushed the next two in with quick succession, angling them so they were perfect to rub against Sherlock’s prostate.
- job, Sherlock bounded off of the couch where he had been lounging and ran to his bedroom, throwing off his dressing gown and tattered pajamas in a minute and going to his bed, crouching down and pulling out the small black box where he had carefully placed his sex toys the day before after cleaning them.
Looking about the many plants, he spotted a white rose, completely pure form blemishes and beautiful, despite the snow whipping around only feet away. The rose was a part of a bush full of white roses, but this one was the largest and most perfectly formed.
The pink and white panties left very little to the imagination, but somehow they made Sherlock almost form that much more erotic: practically calling out for sexual attention.
“J-John, I’m close,” Sherlock breathed, and John nodded, aiming to rub directly into Sherlock’s prostate.
Sherlock sat in his leather armchair in front of the fire, and pondered sex by himself. More specifically sex with John.
Grabbing his phone, John went upstairs to dress for the day and then went downstairs to begin making breakfast for himself and his sleepy, well fucked detective, a self-satisfied smile on his face when he unlocked his phone and looked at the picture of his nude Sherlock.
John was sitting in his armchair in 221B, drinking his tea, reading the newspaper and trying to ignore the nervous prickling at the nape of his neck. The flat was quiet, calm, and utterly ordinary.
"J-John, do you not like this?" Sherlock asked after another moment of silence, taking John's expression to be one of complete shock and eventual disgust. John shook her head, putting down the book she had been reading and dashed over to Sherlock, taking her into her arms.
Molly motioned for Sherlock to stand, and fitted her green bodice over her arms and torso, sewing it up in the back while Sherlock fiddled with the fabric, making huffing noises all the while. Molly rolled her eyes at her mistresses annoyed air, and continued dressing her, picking up the pace lest Sherlock dart from the room half-dressed, as she sometimes did when she was lost in her mind palace, dashing around with a skirt and chemise when her brilliance struck her.
John started to undress for a moment, but decided to wait, taking off his jacket and unbuttoning the top few buttons on his white shirt, taking off his boots and lounging back onto the bed, pleased that the servants had been able to fix the room so quickly.
The two men laughed, scooping up the little girl the cradle between them, nuzzling into her and each other's embrace. They were a family, and ridiculously happy.
After a moment of stillness in which John continued to peer at that adored visage, Sherlock woke with a gasp, his ever changing eyes meeting John’s and his face turning absolutely scarlet, much to John’s internal amusement. Even Sherlock’s nose was not unaffected, the small appendage turning pink, and John wanted to kiss it.
“Good boy,” John whispered, striding forward to tangle his fingers in Sherlock’s curls gently, and Sherlock pressed up into his hand, feeling warmth spread throughout his body at the touch and his kneeling position. John walked behind Sherlock, reaching down to pull off his coat and suit jacket, running his hands down Sherlock sinewy arms and smirking slightly at his shiver.
After a few more moments of stroking his cock while delving a finger slowly in and out, Sherlock added another, gasping at the tightness of his soft channel around his own fingers and reveling in the new sensations.
he watched his lover selfishly take his pleasure for once. He was always lavishing attention on Sherlock, and now the younger man wanted to return the favor.
And while John was once a decent soldier and competent Captain, she knew that society would only allow so much.
“I can’t believe- I just- this is amazing. Are you two together now?” She asked, her eyes full to the brim with hope. John, feeling overwhelmed by the attention they were now receiving from multiple people due to the girl’s outburst, simply nodded, grasping Sherlock’s hand tighter in his own.
Mycroft refused to acknowledge her rank, calling her John with a dismissive air of the upper class, and John gritted her teeth against the barrage of insults that she wanted to yell to their pompous sovereign.
She had her lab, and her garden for samples, and her microscope and library, but all of her studies and books added up to nothing if she couldn't travel to the places she read about, apply the science she had been researching.
When John had suggested going to pride, Sherlock was floored. A few months ago, Sherlock never thought John would be willing to date a man, and now he wanted to go to pride, despite being B-list celebrities who were bound to be seen and outed, in order to show Sherlock off to the world as his partner in every way.
“Your father stole from me! He is getting better than he deserves” the creature in darkness snarled lowly, “He will never leave this tower!”
“What’re you smiling about, love?” John asked with a yawn, his nose crinkling sweetly, and Sherlock watched him with a dazed look.
Sherlock did not even glance at her guard, but John seemed uncaring of this fact and continued: “She had always wanted a feminine daughter, since Harry was more masculine and utterly uninterested in gowns or propriety. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but my mother wanted ball gowns, and makeup, and a happily ever after like in the fairytales.” John huffed a facetious laugh.
,” he cried, biting his lip after a moment to stifle his echoing moans as he found his sweet spot, gently rubbing circles around it and biting down to keep quiet, lest John hear.
“I’m not even qualified to be on the King’s Guard, Lestrade. In case you forgot, I’m not a man,” John said, rolling her eyes at the ludicrous law that only men could be admitted into the Guard. When she joined the army she was accepted, unwillingly, because they needed soldiers. Desperately. But the King’s Guard are an elite group of men who are fighters, soldiers and knights at the top of their skillset.
“So there, Sherlock, now, answer my question,” Moriarty demanded, smiling crookedly as the crowd outside grew more rowdy and increased in volume, wanting bloodshed.
Until he opened his eyes: those cerulean eyes locking with Sherlock’s own, and Sherlock felt his all the air leave his exhausted body.
Light Praise!Kink and fluff abounding. Also possessive!John is here to stay :) Comment with a kink you would like to see! Kudos appreciated.
Sherlock glanced up with a quirk to his lips at John’s sentimental question, deducing John’s intentions to take them to Angelo’s, and gave the appropriate response, “starving.”
“I think they were, Lestrade,” Molly said gently, “but as they never admitted their feelings, the curse remains unbroken.”
“Stand up, love, it’s time to go,” John instructed gently with a smile, and when Sherlock stood up, he straightened his tie and smoothed back his recalcitrant curls, pressing a kiss to the detective’s forehead, and two to his flushed cheeks.
During his travels to London, he was able to obtain the lace for Katherine and new gloves for Mycroft, but finding a place to buy a rose at this time of the year was practically unheard of. Still, Siger searched in every village he came across, hoping to please his youngest and, within the confines of this thoughts, favorite child.
Mrs. Hudson moved on to hug Sherlock as Lestrade came forward, hugging John tightly and clasping his hand against his back with a few pumps, “I am so happy to see you, mate. It’s been a while.”
Michael watched John’s face closely as he shook himself from his imaginings, and refocused on Michael.
“Shh, sweetheart, go to sleep. I know you’re tired,” John whispered into the curly hair, kissing the top of his head and watching the embarrassed flush grace those magnificent cheekbones and trail down that long neck. Sherlock half-heartedly glared and John’s chuckle, and the two men quickly fell into a comfortable, dreamless sleep, wrapped up in one another.
"Ahh, Oh, John, this feels-" Sherlock cut himself off with a moan, arching his back to envelope all of John faster, the two men moaning in unison.
No matter how many escape attempts she tried, bribes she made, and even, at one shameful moment of weakness, begging, she was not allowed to leave the castle under for any reason for the foreseeable future.
After all, it was Sherlock and John. All they ever needed was one another: Sherlock and his conductor of light. John and his young lover.
“Yes, this is Lestrade- wait- what? How-“ Lestrade looked at Sherlock’s knowing grin and sighed, “yes, I’m bringing the team over. Did you happen to find the Belington Rose? Yes, alright, ta very much,” he clicked off the phone and dropped it back in his pocket with a sigh.
As he was taking off his fine clothing, changing into the simple trousers, shirt and cloak he had worn to the castle all those weeks ago, Mrs. Hudson came by to wish him goodbye.
“I’m afraid it’s his story to tell, dear. Now, that’s quite enough chatter.” She proclaimed, motioning for the enchanted objects to begin clearing the table for Sherlock’s departure, “off to bed with you.”
“Moriarty, have you seen my little brother around in the past three days?” Mycroft inquired, interrupting their laughter from a crude joke, and watched as Moriarty’s cold, dead eyes turned to meet his own. Mycroft did not flinch or look away, but he felt a sense of foreboding from the empty stare.
Looking at the picture, which was actually quite good due to the quality of smartphone cameras, Sherlock’s mind turned with possibilities.
“Alright everyone, Bank of England, stat” Lestrade ordered gruffly, ignoring Sherlock’s glee and dismissing the young detective with a wave of his hand.
The maternal voice was coming from just over the side of the bed, and as Sherlock blearily scoots over and looked, he saw a pink and white ceramic teapot smiling up at him as if this was the most normal interaction in the world.
Sherlock felt his eyes dilate further at John's explanation, feeling his body tense as he grew nearer and nearer to orgasm as John explained the delicious torture he had in store for the bound and helpless detective.
John saw the tenderness in Sherlock’s changeable eyes, and he tried to fight back the tears that had already been stinging his eyes, but found he was unable too when Sherlock was opening him up, entering him in a way he never had been before.
John sat down, the bulge in his pants barely constrained, and looked at Sherlock's form meaningfully. Sherlock blushed in realization.
The temptation of Sherlock, innocently resting on the bed, his arse taunting John with its blatant invitation, was simply too much for John.
And then he was fully conscious, looking into John's amused eyes across from him, only to realize his foolishness. What John must think of him now, Sherlock thought deprecatingly, biting his lip where his face was all but hidden.
"J-John, I-I can't-" Sherlock muffled a moan, biting at his plush lower lip as John finally pulled the plug free from his stinging slightly swollen rosebud, watching the adorable pucker try and clench around an object that was no longer there. Sherlock felt his insides were achingly empty, and his body shivered as his secret place sought out something to fill it once again.
She heard the princess gasp quietly. Inwardly, John was crowing that her simple praises and a chaste kiss could undo the brilliant, capable woman such as the one before her and transform her into a stammering, blushing youth.
“Good morning, John,” murmured the sleepy eyed detective, who was peppering John’s chest with kisses in order to wake him further while sprawling his entire body on top of John’s. Their naked flesh was touching in every crevice, but neither man felt particularly aroused as the night before was extremely…. Stimulating.
, please!” Sherlock begged, his back glistening with sweat. John reached a hand up to toy with the curls on the back of his head, and pulled up sharply, and delicate follicles being teased causing Sherlock to shatter beneath him as he came, rocking wildly against the sheets in ecstasy as he stained the sheets beneath him with his release.
,” Sherlock groaned, his hips rocking without his coherent knowledge as he chased the sensations of rocking against the plug and stimulating his sweet spot inside.
“Such a good little one, always wet for me, ready for me to sink deep inside at a moments notice, there's a good boy, Sherlock,” John voiced over Sherlock’s whimpers as John began to slowly sink inside his entrance, the lingering cold from the ice enveloping his throbbing cock and causing a groan to pass unbidden from his lips.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at John’s obliviousness, and screwing up his courage, began unbuttoning his shirt slowly.
Rolling over, John lined his cock up with Sherlock hole, nudging at it lightly; his lubricated head meeting with Sherlock wet, slightly opened entrance, the two slick entities rubbing against one another.
Between Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, and Molly, Rosie was never wanting for people to love and care for her, so John's presence was unneeded.
John, realizing they were coming to an end of their play, tilted his hips, angling them to meet Sherlock’s prostate directly. John began rubbing against Sherlock’s sweet spot and smiled at the slutty moans, cries, and whimpers the once haughty detective now released into the living room.
In the same instant, red petal blossoms began to sprout from the top of the stem, stretching up slowly as Sherlock gasped, almost dropping the rose but clutching it tightly at the last minute. The entire rose bud began to glow, exactly like the enchanted rose, a promise of future blossom.
“Thank you, dear,” she smiled sweetly as John handed her the cup of tea where she sat in the desk chair, and the three of them spent the next half an hour chatting about the weather, Mrs. Turner’s married ones, and finally, John and Sherlock.
Before Sherlock realized, John was pulling him out of the cab, in the door to their home, and up seventeen creaky steps into the sitting room.
Sherlock exclaimed as his spanked arse hit the cold wood of the chair seat, the dildo completely inside of him and the head of the infernal contraption tilted to nudge at his sweet spot.
John smiled cheekily, “It’s just- I’ve never seen you at a loss for words.” John continued to stroke his thumb back and forth across the cheekbone, watching in fascination as the alabaster skin beneath his calloused hand began to turn rosy and the detective’s eyes close against the vulnerability.
That reminded John: “Why are you so fascinated with bees?” He called across the expansive room to Sherlock, who was crouched low and sprang up at his voice, hitting his head on the latter beside him. The beast winced in sympathy, and stared, bemused, as the normally graceful boy displayed odd behavior in his presence once again.
“Where did you go shopping anyways?” John asked, his mouth swallowing down the last green curry and wiping his mouth, offering satisfied hum at the good food before turning his full attention to Sherlock.
you’re perfect love. Whatever you’ve planned, I am sure it is wonderful. Come out here to me,” John coaxed, and watched with complete amazement as Sherlock tiptoed out nervously, his face flaming. But he wasn’t naked, no.
The rest of the room had been cleaned as well, the paintings removed and a fresh smell surrounding the space from the candles and clean rugs and bedding.
John accidentally stepped on Sherlock’s foot to his great amusement, and Sherlock stumbled once or twice, having gotten lost in John’s eyes, but that was what made the moment perfect.
Sherlock ignored the howl of a lonely creature coming from the castle, refusing to feel pity for the beast who had imprisoned and attacked him.
Sherlock thought to himself as he took deep breathe, and peered around him, taking in the shadows in the darkness and, for the first time, feeling a bit of unease.
He didn’t want to break away. He wanted to consume John, crawl inside of him and never leave his heart, be protected and protect him, every day, forever.
The bed itself was stripped down to only a clean white fitted sheet and some matching pillows, and in the center of the room a tray held a series of medical instruments and decidedly
Sweat dripped down her neck as John lunged forward again, burying her lance deeply into the target before her as she practiced on the training grounds in the castle.
In the back of his mind, the detective had assumed that John would dole out his favorite punishment. Being splayed over John’s lap and completely exposed in their sitting room while John spanked him like a child caused his cheeks to blush pink in humiliation.
“Please, just, please-“ Sherlock trailed off, biting his lip and watching John’s growing erection in his dress pants, leaning forward to breathe in the scent of arousal. John smelled like gun powder, tea, and like the masculine scent that was naturally his. It was intoxicating.
Sherlock buried his face further in the pillow for a moment until John spanked his right arse cheek with a sharp smack, and he tilted his head to the side in submission, releasing a whimper as John leant down again and settled his head between Sherlock’s legs as if it was his dearest place.
Sherlock was silent for a moment longer, loathing the fact they were having this discussion of allegiance and loyalty while she was
John chuckled at Sherlock’s mortified expression, and subsequent indignant behavior, and moved forward, baking him up predatorily until the back of his legs hit the bed and he fell down, allowing John to tower over him, still holding the black box and waggling his eyebrows suggestively.
Sherlock stared at the beast in horror and pain, he could not believe that the beast had tried to kill him. Seeing the beast lost in surprise, he darted past him, yelling, “I don’t care what I promised. I won’t stay here another minute!”
“Alright?” Sherlock asked, lining himself up, and John shakily nodded, reaching a hand up to gently push Sherlock’s curls from his forehead.
“Alright, that is just fine, we will have you out in just a mo’. If you could remove your gown and lay torso down on the bed, I’ll take your temperature,” John said, walking over to the sterilized instruments laying on the table and glancing back to Sherlock.
John’s many achievements as an Army captain were played as badges on his right chest, and the scarlet red strip running down his pant legs only made him stand out further as a distinguished soldier. His beret was tilted slightly on his head, making the shock of blonde hair peaking through even more breathtaking.
Finally, after what felt like an age to Sherlock and far too soon for John, Sherlock felt the tip of the plug being pressed against his slick hole, his body accepting the intrusive object without question to fill the ache left from John’s fingers.
“You’re absolutely right Mrs. Hudson, we owe our freedom to Sherlock, who is truly beautiful in every way,” he pronounced, and Sherlock, whose face had lost some of its high color, turned rosy once more as he turned away to hide.
, but only if that is what you desire, hmm,” John hummed, his attention rapt on Sherlock’s rosy cheeks, an unfamiliar shyness emanating from Sherlock’s face as he nibbled at his pink lips, his eyes still wet with tear tracks drying on his lovely face.
“Ta then,” John said, turning to walking towards the living room, tearing his eyes away from his detective on the case, “let me know when we need to leave.”
John's body had grown soft since her time in the army, her breasts naturally large and pressing into Sherlock's back.
Sherlock shook his head in denial, “but Mycroft said that it is weak to succumb to sentiment. That it is better to only be logical.”
Sherlock woke up the next day with a strong arm wrapped around his chest, pushing him into John's sleep-addled body.
And now she couldn’t sleep- it evaded her since a feeling of unease woke her in the middle of the night. She saw the bright glint of metal, and felt a choking moment of utter anguish.
John sighed, pulling his hand away from Michael’s to run it over his face, “yes, yes I do care for him. I’m sorry, he isn’t interested in relationships so I figured-“
Now, after two months, 221B was restored to its former glory; the Bison skull was remounted, the smiley face on the far wall held its comforting bullet holes, and the flat appeared to be brand new. The two Baker Street residents sat in their armchairs, staring at one another while simultaneously thinking of an excuse, any excuse, to break the heavy silence.
“Sherlock? Are you sure you’re okay? You look sick, mate,” Lestrade said, walking over to Sherlock with a creased brow and his usual paternal concern. Sherlock wanted desperately to shake the man to leave him alone, that he was
“What, even you, the beautiful genius who far exceeds us all?” The beast asked sarcastically, pushing his plate away and Sherlock could se his infamous temper beginning to flair.
“But-but I thought…” Sherlock trailed off, gazing around the cold cell, and the beast huffed in exasperation.
John watched the winking pucker for a moment before raising his hand and smacking down on the sensitive entrance with a sweet
“Kind? He was not kind when he turned away my request for dinner! Or said he didn’t even want to try and know me,” John knew he was being petulant, and that it was his own fault that Sherlock didn’t like him, but he still wished he could do something, anything, to try and make this work. Sherlock might be his-
As Sherlock stared at the blinking document in front of him, a niggling idea began to bloom in the back of his mind. Blossoming traitorously despite Sherlock's many attempts to push it away.
Sherlock nodded and straddled John’s lap tentatively, resting his bum on John’s pressed together knees and leaning forward to gently brush his lips against John’s.
Siger noted with a shiver that had nothing to do with the chill of the wind. Shaking himself from his gawking, he turned to the gazebo and walked cautiously inside, feeling an intruder although he did not see any signs of life.
, John realized with a wicked smile, a naughty thought popping into his head as he stared at his detective splayed out on the bed, ready and willing for whatever John would choose to do with him.
“See something you like, then?” John asked teasingly, walking forward a few paced until his was chest to chest with Sherlock, his eyes darkening with a challenge. Before Sherlock realized what he was doing, he was falling to his knees, looking up to John.
John deftly adjusted himself in his trousers, staring at Sherlock pouting mouth in anticipation of those sweet lips, but he quickly coated his fingers in lube to remind himself of the exam.
Now, however, there wasn’t anywhere for him to go, and it seemed he was surrounded by adults, and a child, who wanted nothing more than to help him, but he simply could not wrap his head around the reality of his situation.
“No, and you’re trespassing. Do you know what I do to people who trespass?” The creature stepped closer, and Siger bumped his back into the rose bush, realizing with a shock of panic that he had nowhere to run.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, already feeling overheated in his clothes as John looked up with a grin on his face and an utterly besotted look in his eyes.
,” John growled, landing a few more smacks to Sherlock’s sit spots, just to ensure he would feel their sting during dinner, his tender, soft arse cheeks now glowing a light crimson and standing out beautifully against Sherlock’s ivory skin.
In the middle of the day, there were thousands of tweets with #Johnlock trending, and people kept stopping them to congratulate the men on their relationship.
The pale haired man jumped up with a filthy grin and chaos in his eyes, lifting the empty bin to hurl it at Sherlock and John.
John pretending to think for a moment, rocking back on his heels and clasping his calloused hands behind his back,” hmm, while you
Quickly, without giving himself time to think about it, John brought up the first clamp to Sherlock’s right nipple, pressed it open and then attached it, watching it fall closed and relishing Sherlock’s pained gasp.
“Nothing,” John coughed, self-consciously, giving the haunting statue one last glance before hurrying down the hallway to catch up to Lestrade. As she walked, she tried to shake the young woman from her mind, but nagging curiosity left her to wonder: what might the color of her eyes be? What color would those curls be in the sunlight? What color is the unblemished skin?
But no matter how hard he tried, he could still picture those cold, almost black eyes from his dream.
“You.” Sherlock answered, gently setting down his violin and bow on the desk and walking towards John, leaning down at the same time John leaned up, their lips meeting in a synchronized kiss; moving gently against one another like whispers being traded back and forth.
A note was sitting on the kitchen table addressed to Sherlock, and he picked it up, a confused expression marring his face for a moment as he took in the impromptu message.
John finally sat back to appreciate his hard work, watching the slightly gaping hole proudly while listening to Sherlock’s breathless whine as he attempted to suck in enough oxygen despite the confining corset keeping him at John’s mercy.
"Ohh, okay, well I am the master's ward, whatever that means," she babbled, and Sherlock was struck by the fact that this teacup, this teacup used to be a
John came moments later with a groan, pouring his seed down Sherlock’s creamy throat with a guttural moan, and Sherlock swallowed him down, savoring every last bitter swallow, his eyes closing in pleasure.
In a rush, Sherlock flipped John, pulling down her pajama bottoms and began roughly palming her through her panties, rocking on top of her; John, already on edge from eating Sherlock out and her delicious sounds and reactions, causing John to come with a cry.
There Sherlock sat in his armchair, his nipples clamped like a wanton slut, moaning for it with his head thrown back as he began to reach a hand down to stroke his own cock.
This was the kind of love people searched for, knowingly or not, sometimes their whole lives long. And Sherlock had stumbled upon it, almost destroyed it, practically lost John to the curse, and yet…
, Sherlock thought wildly, bracing himself and exiting the bedroom to prepare for the upcoming case.
“Your mouth should be illegal, my little slut,” John growled, carding his thick fingers through Sherlock’s curls and throwing his head back in abandon, moaning as Sherlock works his pink, glistening mouth along John’s throbbing manhood.
Sherlock turned so his head was facing outwards, slightly away from John and sighing happily as John continued sure strokes down his chest and twirling in his hair; he felt completely safe.
It was a marvel to be sure, but Sherlock was grateful to be with someone who was proud to be with him. With a final swipe of pink lip-gloss, Sherlock nodded at his reflection in the mirror and walked out of the bathroom, searching for John.
“Sherlock, look at me,” John’s voice distantly echoed where Sherlock was lost in his mind, but he ignored it. He couldn’t
He glanced down, wanting to break that gaze that seemed to stare into his very soul- if he even had one of those left- and saw that Sherlock was tending to his wound from the wolf.
Sherlock let out a whine at that, leaning forward on his knees to initiate more contact, needed to feel John after his frightening encounter, but John pulled away, standing a few feet from Sherlock with a set expression on his face.
With a grumble, Sherlock grabbed his laptop and sat on his bed, opening a new document and beginning to write:
“John please-“ Sherlock whimpered, feeling unaccountably shy at being stripped away to his most vulnerable with John inside of him, controlling his pleasure and now, asking Sherlock to open his heart.
, and while John should have been surprised he could remember the date, he wasn’t. Anything to do with Sherlock Holmes was significant to John.
John gave him a wicked smile, leaning down to kiss Sherlock’s sternum once again, continuing to roll his abdomen against Sherlock’s prick, and reveling in Sherlock’s whimpers.
Once they were settled in the cab, Sherlock pressed his cold nose against John’s neck, breathing him in and feeling safe as John wrapped his strong arms around him.
Sherlock was desperately horny, aching and needy, but John was determined to do his work rather than, well, do Sherlock.
After receiving no response from the detective, who had his eyes closed and was refusing to acknowledge his lover, John grinned wider and began to tickle lightly up his abdomen with his fingertips, causing the detective's eyes to fly open and a little hiccuping laugh to escape his mouth.
If you've seen Pride and Prejudice (2005) then you'll remember Elizabeth Bennet's sexual awakening scene in the museum. Sexual content ahead. Comment with any criticism/critiques.
“Keep reading, sweetheart,” John commanded, not unkindly, as he reached beneath the bed to pull out their toy chest. Sherlock listened to the rustling behind him, and with a nervous gulp, turned the pages to the final poem and began, blinking several times to focus on the words:
After a moment longer, they were alone in the dining room, Mrs. Hudson closing the door behind her, and the silence echoed in their wake. Sherlock and John turned to each other, sky blue meeting gray, and they found they could wait no longer. John rushed forward, pulling Sherlock down by the neck and capturing his lips in a punishing kiss, lingering slightly when he pulled away to tease the younger man after his eating performance, licking his lower lip and feeling a shock of electricity rush down his spine and into his growing erection.
And on and on and on…. Horribly lewd messages that set Sherlock’s body aflame further- his blood pumping steadily to his groin and his reddened hole- the pulsations resonating over the held open pucker, nerves dancing, causing Sherlock unending awareness to his bum.
The beast led him down the passageway and then to the right. Sherlock knew they were headed to the North Wing, but he allowed the beast his game of confusion, and smiled at the feeling of his hands being held so gently by a fierce some beast.
“What should we have for dinner, love?” He asked, and Sherlock flopped down in his chair in annoyance. He didn’t care about something as trivial as
his mind supplied unhelpfully. John shook his head, walking out onto his balcony and watching as Sherlock mounted his horse and rode off into the night, his alabaster skin matching the freshly fallen snow. Even from a distance, Sherlock was a graceful vision. Without John's conscious thought, a howl tore itself from his throat, admitting to the sky what a lonely and saddened creature he was.
"I will help you out, however," John cooed, reaching behind him to lift up a small gag from their toy box, "this should keep your wagging tongue in check, at least for a while."
John’s cock gave a twitch at that, and he shook his head, rolling his eyes at his apparently insurmountable arousal where Sherlock was concerned.
One by one the buttons were separated, exposing more and more of Sherlock pale, hairless chest, and John sucked in a quick breath when a hardened pink nipple was uncovered as his shirt fell to his sides.
“John? What-” Sherlock began, but John just reached up to stroke his cheekbone lightly, leaving room between their bodies so Sherlock didn't feel uncomfortable.
“Philip! Shh, it’s alright” Sherlock placated with calming gestures, waiting for Philip to stop neighing and bucking in panicked bursts. Once Philip had calmed with Sherlock stroking his chestnut mane, he realized that there was no rider on top of the creature.
“Yes” Sherlock announced, doing as the beast said, and John was struck by the trust and kindness Sherlock bestowed on everyone he met. John never would have trusted or forgiven someone who had treated him the way he had treated Sherlock. A pang of guilt ran through his chest, but he pushed it away in favor of giving Sherlock his surprise.
Sherlock thought as he stroked around the path of matted hair, but pulled away his hand as if burned once he realized what he was doing.
John then stood up suddenly, his large, calloused palms cradling Sherlock’s plump backside as he began to walk them towards the bedroom, with his manhood still nestled deeply in Sherlock’s body.
,” he teased in a pouting voice, “Let’s see if we can get your arse to be the same shade as your cute, blushing face.”
Sherlock stood up and stretched, feeling a pleasant throbbing coming from his backside and his still hardened nipples and realized that, perhaps, he could get used to this.
When nightfall came, there was no Mycroft in sight, and Siger had sent Katherine away to stay in London with a distant cousin for her protection. Now, Sherlock paced at the door, waiting for Moriarty to come, and tugging his hair, frustrated at his inability to come up with a solution.
"John, I need it, give it to me," Sherlock whined, annoyed at John's lack of attention in the early morning at 221B.
Once he determined his love was ready, he leaned up and captured John’s trembling lips with his own, kissing John for a moment before John tentatively began to kiss back.
“I wish there was another way,” said Sherlock, wringing his hands further in agitation, “I don’t wish to marry Moriarty, but you cannot go to the asylum.”
As she began to descend the grand staircase, her brother glided up to meet her and escort her down. He took note of her tiara, and a soft look passed over his face for a moment before it fell into calculating indifference again.
After about a mile, Sherlock viewed an edge of grey in the distance. As he galloped closer, he realized that it was a large stonewall with a rusted iron gate. Just beyond, down a stone pathway a huge castle stood, decorated by gargoyles and dark flying buttresses with sharpened stone decorating the outer walls. The dark grey against the darkened night sky makes the castle seem completely deadened, as if no one had ever resided in the cold building with it uninhabitable atmosphere.
“Let’s take it once more,” John said, and ignored Sherlock whine as he slowly inserted the long, glass rod back into Sherlock’s bottom, leaving just the tip peaking out between Sherlock’s ripe bottom.
John took the suggestion, rocked on his feet for a few moments with a ridiculous grin on his face, and pounced.
Last night, with John, Sherlock remembered, smiling a besotted grin into his pillow and releasing a contented little hum of pleasure, butterflies erupting in his stomach. John had been so tender, so careful with him. Sherlock had never felt so vulnerable, and yet safe at the same time. A juxtaposition of sentiment.
John turned to face the princess, grabbing her by the wrist to stop her gliding steps: “I am saying this because I know what it is to have expectations upon you that you do not want- and I am saying that sometimes you must follow your heart instead of your perceived duty.”
Sherlock had never much been interested in others in a physical manner, always preferring his books to dreary companionship and therefore never building any romantic connections. Despite Moriarty’s many attempts back in Sussex, Sherlock was entirely uninterested in him and his poorly laid innuendos. Intellectual abilities were attractive to Sherlock, it was true, but sentiment was a necessity in a romantic relationship, and Sherlock knew that he needed affection. Moriarty was cold, his smiles never reaching his eyes and his actions never kind.
This is what adrenaline feels like, Sherlock realized with a grin, hopping up and glancing down, grateful that his trousers were no longer experiencing a lingering tightness, and he raced out of the gallery feeling utterly alive and like he could fly.
Sherlock sat up after another moment, taking off his shirt and wriggling out of his pants, ignoring John’s laugh at his ridiculous movements to escape the tight riding pants Mrs. Hudson insisted he wear. Sherlock gave a mock growl, his cheeks blushing as he watched John peruse his naked flesh lazily, his member a deep red and leaking with interest.
“Really, John? Even for you, this is a bit romantic,” Sherlock scoffed, attempting and failing to ignore the way his heart raced at the poem John chose.
“I do love you,” John murmured between kisses, adoring Sherlock’s naked, sleep warmed body beneath his own, “I absolutely adore you, even when you’re a git.”
John had started taking his laptop to work with him, as Sherlock continued to break his passwords (the last being LeaVeOFFWaNkEr, which had briefly amused Sherlock before he logged in and began updating the many mistakes on John’s blog), and now Sherlock was forced to use his own laptop and walk to his room. Tedious.
Although Sherlock may not deserve to receive pleasure from his punishment, John decided that, just this once, he would show mercy to the flustered detective who was taking his punishment so well.
John spanked his arse swiftly, adoring he handprint that blossomed on Sherlock’s naughty bum in the next instant, “behave, Sherlock.” Then John moved Sherlock slightly off of his lap and got up, motioning for him to follow John to his chair.
She pulled and tightened, not so much that Sherlock was in pain, but enough that it slightly restricted his movement and caused his spine to straighten and his heretofore unmentioned waistline to be defined.
“So,” Sherlock said, still breathing hard, with a bright grin gracing his sweet features, the color still high on his cheeks, “I finally found something I love more than reading.”
Once their laughter had completely died out, the two men lay side by side in their bed in Baker Street, and with a little smile John looked over, meeting Sherlock's ever-changing eyes with his own. With that heavy look that passed between them, the mood shifted ever so slightly into something more serious, unspoken.
John never looked directly at her, but Sherlock could feel her presence across the room and felt her breasts tightening, her heart racing, and her nipples hardening. What was happening?
He upturned Sherlock as he sat down, forcing the younger man over his lap in the next moment, Sherlock’s head resting on the couch and his legs dangled to the side of John’s lap limply.
for John to mark and claim, lost in the unadulterated hedonistic pleasure only an unconscious man can truly achieve.
John’s breathing was already labored, and his eyes were half shut from exhaustion and pain, but he smiled at Sherlock, reaching up to stroke his face.
“That’s right, darling,” John grunted out as he began to rock, “your pleasure is mine. You belong to me.”
The doorbell. John sighed in annoyance while Sherlock sprang up, running to the door to collect their food and feeling grateful for the interruption, breathing a sigh of relief.
“Keep them closed one moment longer” the beast announced, pulling back curtains to let light in the space, and Sherlock took a deep breath.
The cabbie stopped in front of the flat an coughed, getting Sherlock attention from where he was brooding in the back of the taxi. With a sigh, Sherlock paid, stepping out with his purchases in his hand and moved to open the door to the flat.
With a smirk, John sat up briefly, tearing off his clothes in anticipation as he sat astride Sherlock’s thighs. Once he was naked, he settled back down, forming his body against Sherlock’s back, his cock settling between Sherlock’s plump cheeks, rubbing against the strip of silk separating them.
Sherlock smiled widely, eyes sparkling with slight arousal. John has had plenty of sex. And since Sherlock knows John, and trusts him, John is the perfect candidate to take Sherlock’s long overdue virginity.
After a few moments of cleaning and sounds of movement, she heard Molly cry, “Sherlock,” while gasping in a scandalized manner. Sherlock grinned into her arms without lifting up her head.
“Come here, love, let’s have a cuddle” John smiles, taking Sherlock’s hand and leading him to the, now shared, downstairs bedroom. John looked to Sherlock for permission before deftly undressing the detective into only his pants and then undressing himself likewise.
Grasping his leaking, erect cock firmly, he began tugging it and groaning, just remembering Sherlock’s sweet, oversensitive reaction’s to John’s teasing, causing him to come from a few words and some light pressure against his cock.
“That’s alright dearie, you finish your cry, and then we will see about getting you some proper food,” the teapot, who had introduced herself as Mrs. Hudson, soothed.
Meanwhile, Moriarty found himself walking down a dreary hallway, finding claw marks abundant on the art and destroyed curtains, and he grinned, his eyes flashing at the promise of a kill.
John didn't know what to make of the young man, he was beautiful, that was certain. John had never been attracted to the same form as himself, but Sherlock was ethereal with his tall body, lean but muscled frame that was evident even under layers, and his virescent eyes that shown with his intellect. His face was picturesque and seemed to be carved from marble, and John had never hated how beastly he was until Sherlock's face was twisted in horror, looking at his revolting face.
“Well, that is just a risk we will have to take,” John teased, drawing one finger in and out now with aching slowness, nudging lightly against the bottom of Sherlock’s prostate and causing the man to squirm slightly in his awkward position.
Moriarty had thrust his recovered sword into John’s side. It was already darkening his cloak with blood.
Finally, as the last maid curtsied to leave with a quiet, “your highness.” Sherlock immediately threw her chemise from over her head and stepped into the hot bath, sighing as she sunk down beneath the steaming water and the foaming soap.
Finally, after dancing until their feet were sore, just after the sun had gone down on the beautiful day, John and Sherlock said goodnight to their guests, and left the party while the music was still playing, John leading Sherlock to their bedchambers to celebrate their wedding night.
,” Sherlock gasped, writhing on the table as John plundering his tongued-open hole mercilessly with his tongue. Reaching ever deeper into Sherlock’s pink passage and stroking it just beneath Sherlock’s sweet spot.
Suddenly overwhelmed, Sherlock felt a stinging in the back of his eyes, “It’s just, I used to be made fun of for my appearance. My mama said it was because other’s were jealous, but I never realized until just now that maybe she was right.”
Shortly after that incident, John and Sherlock left their giggling parental figures who were still sharing embarrassing stories about their childhoods, their faces just beginning to fade from the lingering mortification.
A few meters away, the commander of the King’s guard- Thrymn- watched John with a critical eye as he sharped his longsword, tracking John’s movements and observing her skill at close-hand combat. She had passed the tests for speed, agility, and fighting on horseback. John took down a man- Anderson- twice her size on the training grounds the day before, and despite Thrymn’s unwillingness to even test a woman, she was exceeding his high-set expectations for one of his guards.
Sherlock walked over to the full-length mirror hanging on the wardrobe, and his mouth dropped in shock. He had never appeared so… Regal. He was standing tall, appearing even taller due to the boots and the slim cut of the jacket. The jacket’s tassels sparkled in the candlelight and the blue from the shirt brought out the blue in his eyes, making them seem even larger.
As the despondent beast looked impassively out the window, he viewed the firelight coming from just outside the iron gates, and with his advanced hearing could make out the sound of men shouting.
your cunt” John declared in a shocked voice, and Sherlock blushed violently, hiding her face in the crook of John’s neck.
“Yes, I am, I just-“ Sherlock bit his lip, but continued, “I wish I could see my father. Just to make sure that he is okay.” Sherlock turned away for a moment, before the beast caught his arm and gently pulled Sherlock around the face him once more.
“I, John, take you Sherlock, to be my lawfully wedded husband,” John spoke confidently, squeezing Sherlock’s hands where they were intertwined between them, both men laughing when they heard Rosie ask in a child’s whisper how much longer until they could have cake. Giving themselves a moment to get their overwhelming emotions under control, the two men then took a breath in unison.
Sherlock stood immediately, walking over to John and taking his hand, John led them to their bedroom.
This will be the final scene for those of you who are not interested in Explicit content, and I hope I've wrapped up the story nicely for you. I am changing the rating to Explicit for the final chapters, because Sherlock and John deserve some physical and emotional intimacy and I want to give it to them. I'm taking requests on what you all would like Sherlock and John to do in the sex scenes, if not, I'll be left to my own imaginings, which may be dangerous :)
Her jaw literally dropped. She stood up in a rage. “Are you mad? You don’t love me! You don’t even know me! I can’t believe you would just say that. You can’t go around just saying that!” By the time she started throwing about words like “pig” and “creep,” I decided to judge the whole endeavor a failure—and not only that, more trouble than it was worth. I drove her home in extremely irritated silence and we never spoke again. I suppose the only good thing that came from it was that she learned at an early age a valuable lesson regarding the lengths a sexually charged male will go to, to sleep with her. I’d like to think it saved her from many mistakes she otherwise would have made later on in her life.
He twitched and ran a hand over his own crotch. I firmed my grip on the back of his head, beginning to breathe loudly. I loved watching him touch himself, especially when it was in response to something I said. Like he just couldn’t control it.
Mary’s anger left her then, in one emptying rush. She realized, with a terrible pain in her heart, that she’d done to Anna what her own father had done to her. Although she’d understood (after she finally met him) why he’d stayed in England while her mother was in America, she’d still grown up without him. That had been very, very hard. Not only had she had just one parent to raise her, but her whole life had been swathed in secrets, right down to the color of her eyes. She had never been able to find her own identity.
He’d planned to do it after he’d met with Sherlock’s parents, he really had, but Mary had discouraged him on the ride home. “Don’t do this,” she’d said. “We’ve finally gotten to a good place, you and I. We’re happy in our little life together, with our daughter, in our home. It’s peaceful, it’s normal. And we love each other, John. Neither of us is perfect, but we’ve learned to live with that.”
John ignored him. “Sherlock, you need to masturbate. This I’m telling you as a doctor, not as your friend or—or—well, you just need to. It’s essential for testicular health.”
“You’re the one who married Mary,” Sherlock accused. “If you were in love with me, you should have said something, you shouldn’t have gone off and tied yourself to a woman you didn’t—“
When it was over, they stayed against the wall, their foreheads pressed to one another’s, panting, coming back to themselves.
Lestrade checked the clock in the break room as he poured himself a tall cup of coffee. Three-fifty-eight.
John awoke a few hours later. It was early afternoon judging by where the sunlight was shining on the cabin walls. It took a moment for him to realize it was not diffused through the clouds. It beamed bright and yellow and John craned his neck to look out the window which hurt his back and his shoulder as they were very stiff. Sleeping on the floor had not been a good idea. But he saw that the latest storm had passed and the sky was blue and the sun was shining. He stared at it and his eyes watered from the brightness.
He was acting like I hadn’t said anything at all to refute those ridiculous ideas. I didn’t know what else to say, so I opted for a more direct approach. I grabbed his face and kissed him.
Sherlock was upset, even though he knew he had no right to be. That was one of the rules, now that John was a father; if John’s daughter needed him, at all, for anything, John would be there—she was his first priority. Still, Sherlock didn’t much like going out to interview potential kidnappers by himself…. It wasn’t that he was frightened (he was
I might come back to this one later, but this was where I originally planned on ending it so I've marked it complete for now. Thanks for reading :)
into it. Sherlock pulled John’s hips closer to his, not exactly pressing them together, but letting them touch, and he could feel John’s erection growing. He smiled as he moved to kiss down John’s jaw line and into the crook of his neck. John’s breath was loud and ragged in his ear, magnified a thousand times. “Sherlock,” he whispered, and Sherlock felt a shiver down his spine at the sound of his name.
cried on his shoulder… yet, Sherlock hadn’t seemed bothered by it. In fact, he tightened his grip on John’s shirt in response.
John huffed a laugh. “Honestly, Mary is so preoccupied with… whatever it is she’s working on, right now, that I doubt she’ll even notice I’m gone.”
Molly smiled. “Well, good for her! It’s nice to see creativity in young people.” She grabbed another clip and went back to work. When he didn’t respond, she looked up again and sighed at his expression. “Sherlock, this is perfectly normal. She has friends. She enjoys music. Every little girl dreams of being a rock star at some point—what’s the matter with it?”
Sherlock was at the kitchen table, perched over his microscope, a plate of fresh biscuits next to his pile of slides. He didn’t look up. “John.”
Anna glanced over her shoulder to send a look Sherlock’s way, and he pretended to be very interested in the teapot. “I hope so,” she said.
John and Sherlock strolled leisurely along the path, the gravel crunching under their shoes. They’d gone for a walk to take a break from the hospital (at Mary’s suggestion—well, more like “demand,” as John was getting a little too over-protective of the baby. “She
“Oh, I know what you did,” John interrupted, his voice rumbling low. And then, he lowered his gun, just slightly, and pulled the trigger.
Sherlock set his violin back into the case and broke the spell. He clasped the case closed and, without looking at her, said, “Thank you.”
“Mary never planned on stopping the raid. She never tipped Moriarty off to set up an ambush, she didn’t care what happened to him—she was there for the
“But of course you can stay,” Molly interrupted. She didn’t know where the answer had come from, but it came out before she could stop it. Perhaps because Sherlock had kicked him out, she’d suddenly felt a little sympathetic.
John just looked at me, stupidly. As if I was stupid. Which I was, of course—I should’ve known “why.” I was the omniscient Sherlock Holmes, for God’s sake. But I didn’t. All I could think of was that he kissed me, and I liked it. Sentiment, sentiment, sentiment, clogging my neurological pathways, demanding my attentions for non-deductive pursuits. How was I supposed to bloody deduce anything in this state of mind?
Sherlock looked at him, bewildered that anyone could be concerned with anything other than the fact that John had just been blown to bits. “I…” he began, his voice thick with crying. He whispered, as if not quite believing his own answer, “I gave it to John.”
She stomped up the stairs—loud enough to be heard in the adjoining flats, probably—all the while knowing it was immature, but not being able to help herself. It was just so un
I was caught off guard. This whole situation, everything, it was just so brand-fucking new. I was so lost. “Erm... I don’t...”
John froze as he caught sight of the photo in front of him, the one of him and Anna when she was a baby. And then his eyes moved to the other pictures of her, at various ages, holding sports trophies, playing violin, buried in the sand at the beach…. Suddenly, he turned around and made for the stairs. “John?” asked Sherlock, as John ascended to the next floor. He hopped up and went after him. “John, where are you—“
“You’re too old for this, Sherlock,” Mycroft drawled as Sherlock limped into the sitting room. “This gallivanting around, chasing down criminals.”
John watched him as they walked. “You know, you can always give me a ring, if you need my help on a case. You know, my expertise.”
Molly held out a petri dish, and Sherlock carefully laid the flesh inside it. His eyes were bright and focused, and there was an energy in his movements that Molly hadn’t seen in many years. “You’re different,” she observed. “More like your old self. It’s nice.” She flushed. “Erm, not like I didn’t like you before—“
John had caught Sherlock smirking at that, and had growled low. “See how you like it!” he’d barked, and practically threw his blubbering child into Sherlock’s lap. But to John’s surprise, Sherlock made a silly face and lifted her up above his head, and she stopped crying. “Well, bloody hell,” John had said, in awe. “We should have you around more often.”
been talking about him, hadn’t I? I’d based my fake love on my relationship with him. Sure, I’d embellished that last bit, about how I wanted him but never said anything because he wasn’t gay, and so what good would it do to let him know if it would only cause trouble? That’s the part that wasn’t real. That’s the part I could deny. It wasn’t true.
Sherlock turned to them, the remains of his delight still on his face. “Oh, nothing,” he said, struggling to control his expression. “Just that Mummy has been complaining about Daddy’s weight, and Daddy isn’t allowed biscuits anymore, but she’s seen him sneak them from the tin he’s hidden under her crib.” Sherlock’s eyes sparkled. “Apparently, Daddy told her not to tell Mummy, that it was their little secret.”
“You’re looking for an iron box, about as long as your forearm, and three times as tall,” Mary told him, when he’d finally dressed. “Should be directly below us; I moved it out here a short time ago. Just swim down and hook this onto it.” She pulled a length of cable from the winch. “Then give it a tug, and we’ll crank it up.”
!” Sherlock exploded, suddenly unable to control his anger. “For God’s sake, don’t you know me by now?
A beat passed, and then Molly began to stutter. “Well, I—I apologize. I don’t know what to think, I—John. My God. You’re alive.” She said it neither happily nor unhappily. “I would hug you, but…” she awkwardly pulled the shirt down in an attempt to hide her body. “Just, wow. Oh my God.” She looked to Sherlock for help, for some idea of how she was supposed to react. Unfortunately, Sherlock had nothing to give her.
“There was no one to remind me,” I replied, loftily. I flopped down on the sofa and opened my laptop. “Now, did you hear about this murder in Wembley—“
Molly breathed again. “Oh my God, Sherlock, I thought—well, it doesn’t matter.” She sighed. “What happened?”
“It is, Sherlock.” John closed his notebook and uncrossed his legs. “Last week we didn’t have a case, and you were running five different experiments
Now they had to return home, to the flat where they lived together. They had to figure out how to go from here, how to live life with the knowledge they had both learned in that office. They had to reconcile the two truths, the two worlds; one where they were friends, only friends, and Sherlock avoided his feelings, and John tried to provoke him into feeling
, she thought bitterly. They gave her new identities, constantly—new people to be, with whole histories and backgrounds and personalities. Even if they were false, at least she had them, at least she knew who she was, even for a brief time.
Sherlock shook his head. “Well, brother, unfortunately for us both, that’s not true.” He told him about the threat they’d received at the morgue.
He watched as Sherlock swallowed, looking very stricken, even through the heavy mist that now filled the bathroom.
“Actually,” Sherlock interjected, his voice seeming to boom over the crowd. “My name is Holmes. Sherlock… Holmes.”
Yet Mycroft seemed wholly convinced of Anna’s abilities to fool the most intelligent criminal in the world. Molly doubted Mycroft had seen something that she and Sherlock hadn’t, so the only explanation was that Mycroft was using Anna for an entirely different purpose.
John was beside himself on the cab ride to 221B. He kept pointing at things and saying “Would you look at that!?” or “Just as I remembered it.” Sherlock ignored him, for the most part, lost in his own thoughts. When they finally got to the flat, it seemed as if they’d been traveling for ages.
Sherlock lingered in the shadows as the pallbearers brought the casket down the aisle and out the front doors. John was one of the bearers, of course, and it was the closest Sherlock had been to him since that almost-cab ride all those years ago. He could see the wrinkles around his eyes and mouth. He could see—
John knew Sherlock was trying to be a good friend, but he was sick of attempting to explain human nature to him, of teaching him to have normal human responses—especially in situations where John was the one who needed him to have a normal human response. “Well, you can start by not telling me when to go to bed, or when to get up, or to stop drinking, or to
,” I said, just to make him uncomfortable. Unfortunately it didn’t seem to work; if anything, John looked immensely satisfied. He was probably congratulating himself for figuring I was gay all along.
Mycroft had rolled his eyes. “She may be smart, but she’s also desperate. She’s come out of hiding, married John Watson, of all people, pet of my brother Sherlock Holmes-who, as we all know from my pleading for your leniency in regards to the case of Mr. Magnussen’s unfortunate demise, holds a detestably special place in my heart. If she’s not trying to manipulate her way up the chain of sentiment and into the government’s secret vaults, then my name isn’t Mycroft Holmes. She’s desperate, she’s exposed, and she’s proving that she will do anything to get at that key. So give it to her.”
“So what are we going to do about Anna?” John finally asked, turning around. His demeanor had grown very cold. “We going to share her, switch off weekends? She’s a child of divorce, now, is she?”
Anna looked around and caught a glimpse of a scrawny wooden table in her periphery, just a few paces back and to the right. A plan quickly formed in her mind. She drew both of her legs up and kicked out as hard as she could; the shock wave sent the attacker stumbling backward a pace. She kicked again. He stumbled back again, and then he tripped and fell backwards—right onto the table. It smashed with a satisfying
But that’s what happened; I no longer had an interest in the physicality of a romantic relationship. I wanted John to be with me, certainly. To live with me in the flat, eat his meals with me, solve crimes and blog and read the paper and watch telly. I wanted him to do those things with me, and not anyone else, until the day we died. But kissing? Hugging? Holding hands? Sex? The thought of those brought a sour taste to my mouth, one that I had to swallow to keep down.
closed, somewhere… below him? It had made the glass rattle in the picture frames. He crept further down the hallway and stopped at a door to his right, which was slightly ajar. His heart pounded in his chest as he reached a hand inside his jacket to grab his gun, then the handle of the door. He steeled his nerves and flung it open.
Mrs. Hudson wiped her eyes. “It’s quite a thing, how he loves that girl. I would never have thought him capable… but I was wrong, wasn’t I? All that time, he had it in him.” She smiled.
What I did think about during the ride was how to make John understand. He was determined—adamant, in his John-Watson way—to not give up. I didn’t know how to make him do it, only that I had to, somehow. Otherwise, he would never leave me alone to recover from this.
Suddenly, John was leaning down next to me. His shoulder pressed against mine, his hands on his knees. “What do you see?” he murmured gently, right next to my face. I swallowed and glanced at him. He was smirking, clearly one hundred percent aware that he was turning me on just by being close to me.
I chose the latter. It was easier to give him what he wanted than to explain why I didn’t want it too.
Sherlock gave him a disgusted look. “Absolutely not. That road is impossible to navigate, even for the best of drivers.”
“When I was twenty-five, I was assigned to kill an MI6 agent. I knew nothing about him except for his home address and his physical description—average height, blond, blue-eyed. That was nothing out of the ordinary; they only ever told us what we needed to know to kill, and it wasn’t much. The night that I went to his home I was on my guard, because he was intelligence, too, so I figured he’d be more alert than my usual targets. I thought I’d made it successfully through the house without waking him, but as soon as I stepped into his bedroom he ambushed and disarmed me and demanded to know who sent me. He was so angry, but unsurprised, as if he’d been expecting something like this to happen. I was about to give him my practiced ‘Fuck if I tell you’ response when I noticed a long, thin chain round his neck, and at the end of it a delicate half moon of lapis lazuli.”
Sherlock laughed to himself, as if he had a secret. He sat up and continued to smile fondly at Anna. She looked up at him, and smiled back.
Sherlock wrote something down on the notepad at his hand, then readjusted his face back onto the viewer. “My opinion obviously carries no weight in your decision, so why bother asking?” He didn’t wait for John to answer. “I’ll tell you why; you are clearly trying to provoke an angry response from me, one which I have no interest in giving you. So I will choose to remain silent on the matter.” His face was impassive, his demeanor calm.
Anna shivered at the thought of lying to Moriarty; it was a frightening prospect that she was in no way ready for. Getting caught in a lie by Sherlock would result in shouting and pale-eyed glaring and attempted grounding, but getting caught in a lie by Moriarty would most likely result in her death.
Mrs. Hudson’s glare suddenly became a twinkle. “Oh love,” she said, chuckling again and turning back to the sink. “I’ve got
“If you say ‘I told you so,’" Sherlock said by way of greeting, “I’ll smother you to death with this blanket.” He pulled it up closer around his chin, staring at Mycroft from the couch.
“Home” was a place that John, for most of his life, hadn’t associated with anything good. “Home” as a child meant the house he lived at with his alcoholic parents and ill-tempered, destructive, eventually-to-be-alcoholic herself older sister. “Home” in the military was an empty flat in London that, unlike war, couldn’t offer a sufficient distraction from the demons he’d garnered in his childhood. “Home” two days ago was a place that he shared with his wife and daughter, in a life that he didn’t feel he deserved, nor really even knew if he wanted, anymore.
“And how am I supposed to convince everyone else that you should be in there?” Lestrade’s voice was angry, all of a sudden. “You’re not a police officer, you’re not a lawyer. You’re not a—“
Sherlock blinked at him, aghast. “That was back when I thought you were actually in love with your wife!”
Somehow, Anna knew. It wasn’t that she remembered the woman’s hair, or her eyes, or the sound of her voice. She’d been too young, to still remember those things. No, she knew because of the way the woman was looking at her, like she’d been thirsty for ages, and had just come upon a pristine pool of water, and was desperately hoping it was not a mirage.
“I don’t know what to do,” Sherlock told Mrs. Hudson as she brought some left-over apple turnovers to the table. “If he’s not drinking, he’s sleeping, and if he’s not sleeping, he’s crying… and I don’t even have to
“I hate this, Sherlock,” he’d sobbed, his head in his hands. “I hate not being able to do anything. I hate that I just assumed that he would take care of things... how I just left him… I hate that he covered this up for me, and didn’t tell me he was going to do it. I hate it. I should have some of the blame. I should be in jail, with him.” And so on and so forth. And Sherlock had run out of sympathetic responses to give him.
“Of course you will, Annalise,” Moriarty replied calmly. “Because if you don’t, I’ll kill them both. And then
It had never been like this, never, not with anyone. My speech was stuttered. My thoughts were verging on incoherency. I felt that whatever John did now, whatever he said, I wouldn’t be in control of my responses. I didn’t particularly like not being in control. In fact, it was fucking frightening. But I didn’t want to stop.
Anna had corrected, absentmindedly. She was wary about this plan—so many things could go wrong. Really, what it came down to was her ability to lie; the better she was at it, the less suspicious Sherlock would be.
“Please talk to me,” John said quietly, through the door. He thumbed a splinter at the base of the frame. “I’m not angry, I’m not upset. I just want you to talk to me.”
came back from the dead, he thought he should to go down and break the news to her without John there. Otherwise, the poor woman would probably have a heart attack.
Sherlock shifted in the chair and John snapped away from his trance. He suddenly was very tired. He wanted to curl up on the floor in front of the heat and go to sleep, right there on the floor. That would be comfortable enough. There were no blankets on his bed any longer.
Sherlock stared at her, throwing socks and underwear on top of the few clothes. “No, you’re not,” he replied in disbelief, realizing that if she actually wanted to leave there was nothing he could do to stop her (short of chaining her to the radiator, which he did briefly consider).
He heard John come up behind him, felt arms slide over his waist and pull him into a hug. John rested his head between Sherlock’s shoulders and sighed. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I’m not trying to make you jealous.”
Anna glanced over at Lucy, then at the fish, then back at Sherlock. “Am I in trouble?” she asked, her voice shaking.
Sherlock reached for his shoulder and pitched backward, losing his balance and falling into the water. “Sherlock!” John and Anna both screamed, and John rushed to the side of the boat.
“You....” He looked at me uneasily. “You didn’t just have a panic attack to get out of talking to me, right?”
he go? Molly didn’t want to know; the problem was too big to fathom. Looking at Mycroft sitting in the chair opposite, she was suddenly struck with a sense of pity for him; in his position, he had to consider this issue constantly and make decisions based upon it. Maybe it wasn’t up to her to judge him for those decisions… and maybe that was a relief.
“I don’t like this…“ muttered John as they rounded the first corner. Anna glanced behind her to see if anyone was following—no one was—and immediately ran into Sherlock, who had stopped abruptly. She caught her balance and then saw, with what felt like an iron fist clenching her heart, three armed guards pointing guns at them. And in the middle stood Jim Moriarty, his hands clasped in front of him, an ostentatious gold and velvet crown resting on his head.
John sat up, rubbing his eyes. He wished that Molly had a fireplace—it was the perfect morning for a cozy fire and a hot cup of tea. He stood and went over to the window, taking in the sight of the bright white snow, so far untouched by human beings; pristine, picturesque. In a few hours the plows would be out, then the cars, then the children, and the whole thing would be a pile of black, pebbly slush. But for right now, it was perfect. Magical.
John’s thrusts are indelicate, he doesn’t even wait for Sherlock to get used to the sensation. He digs the pads of his fingers into Sherlock’s hips and fucks him. He fucks him and fucks him, grimacing and sweating, and Sherlock is shaking under his hands, and moaning, “Yes, yes, please, John, John,
Anna turned to look at Sherlock. His music was melancholy tonight… he didn’t usually play so emotionally. Something about the way he was standing and swaying to the music, ever so subtly, moved her. She thought about all that had happened in the last few weeks, and all that had happened tonight… in that time, she hadn’t really given a thought to how Sherlock was reacting—she’d just focused on lying to him, convincing herself that she was doing it all for him in the long run. But now she thought about it, and realized with guilt that Sherlock probably thought she was pulling away from him in her teenaged state. He probably felt like he was losing her.
Sherlock smiled back at him, one of those few, genuine, ear to ear grins that he so rarely employed.
Sherlock smiled again and John waited for him to get on his trousers and boots and coat and hat and gloves so that they could go out to the barn. John was still very skeptical about the whole thing and thought Sherlock was bluffing this time. He was prepared to be amused by his failure. When they got to the barn he stood at the door to her stall with his arms folded and watched.
. As they got closer, he could see that they were moving slowly, but he could hear them talking to each other, their tones cheerful and energetic. He wondered how far they’d walked, if they’d been able to take a cab part of the way. The tube didn’t exactly run between Sherlock’s and Molly’s buildings, and though they weren’t that far from each other, it was still several miles…
This was the first fic I'd ever written; it started out as a few unrelated, short scenes that I wanted to get out of my head and down on paper, but it gradually grew and took shape as I kept writing. Encouraged by the feedback on my other fics from this lovely AO3 community, I decided to refine this first story and share it, too. It's gone through countless edits and rewrites, and though there are several chapters that I'm still not completely happy with, as a whole I'm proud of this work—if for no other reason than the fact that I finished it.
Molly thought for a long while about how to phrase it, twirling her hair round her fingers. Finally, she explained it this way:
Isn’t this what Major Sholto had advised him to do? Tell John the truth? Ever since their conversation, which had been all of one day ago, Sherlock had thought nonstop about it. About the possibility that he could, in fact, be “in love” with John Watson. “In love” was not something he’d ever felt before, not even remotely, so he was already at a disadvantage for not having anything to compare it to. And of course, the whole “sociopath” thing—that was a significant disadvantage as well. Could he ever be in love? Did he have the capacity for it?
Anna smiled and plugged them into her computer. “Thanks, I’m excited to use them,” she said, hoping he'd take the hint.
John’s eyebrows folded over as he realized that Sherlock hadn’t actually addressed the most disturbing part of the question, the “else.” “Marry someone
And she could see why he loved John. Good-natured, funny, loyal, practical—he provided a much needed balance to Sherlock’s whims and moods and exhausting intellect. The two of them played off each other well, bantering like some great comedic duo…
“Of course she knows,” he snapped. Sex was everywhere, and she was thirteen. It would have been impossible for her not to know. “I have not sheltered her from the realities of the world, not in the least.”
He spent half the night wrapped in a blanket on the sofa, Googling “what is love,” reading everything from blog posts to scholarly articles (ignoring the frequently appearing videos of an apparently popular song from the nineties), trying to get a handle on what it meant. There seemed to be quite a range of feelings encompassed in the understanding of that word, which was not at all helpful. It seemed to be quite subjective. Sherlock grit his teeth and dove deeper into the research.
“No,” Mary choked. “We’re leaving, we’re gone. You can have him.” She shot a scathing glare in John’s direction. “Good fucking luck.”
“She’s up to something,” Sherlock grumbled as he made the first incision into Mr. Thompson. The sixty-nine year-old, obese man had clearly died of a heart attack, but as Sherlock was reminded by Molly Hooper almost daily, determining the cause of death was not the only purpose of an autopsy. There needed to be examinations of internal organs and weights and lengths recorded and other such boring tasks to accomplish.
What I needed to do was convince him of my feelings, separate from my physical desires. In short, to put five years of subconscious emotion into perfect words. No problem, right?
“So what do you need me for, then?” John thought about it, and then gave her a wry smile. “You want me to kill him
“Why didn’t you help us before, as we had originally planned?” Sherlock asked, avoiding her question. “That was a nasty little trick, Mary. Letting us think that Moriarty had won again.”
“When you said I ‘didn’t have to do that.’” He passed round the edge of the table and stood in front of the next body. “I thought you meant, kiss him. I thought you were upset that I kissed him in front of you, as if you thought I was trying to show you that I was clearly over you.”
“If you didn’t want to turn me on,” John said, using the opportunity to kiss his way down my throat, “you shouldn’t have been so brilliant.” He slid his hand up to push my shirt out of the way, and put his lips on my collar bone. “It’s your own bloody fault, you know.”
They’d turned the corner before Mycroft said anything more. “I know about you and John,” he announced, when they had done.
“Hey, Sherlock—“ Lestrade had called out, as Sherlock turned to leave. “Scotland Yard is having our holiday party on New Year’s Eve this year—you’re welcome to join. You’re sort of an honorary member down here, anyway.”
,” he breathed, his vision going a bit fuzzy with the intensity of the feeling. He wasn’t going to last long like this, and he didn’t know how far along Sherlock was, but he certainly didn’t want to be the only one coming so soon. John leaned forward and slid his right hand around to the front of Sherlock’s pelvis, finding his stiff cock there, and gripped it firmly.
“Oh, I won’t,” he told her, with wheezing sound that she was sure was an attempt at a chuckle. “It takes more than a bullet wound to kill Sherlock Holmes. Just ask your father.” He glanced to where John was sitting.
It was a military funeral, which was another unexpected thing. Sherlock didn’t think John would have much cared for the extravagance of it, but he supposed it was necessary given John’s history in the war. The empty coffin was buried in a military cemetery, as well, in one half of a double-plot section—the other half being for Mary, when she too passed away. Sherlock spent the remainder of the burial in a rage that that woman, who was in his mind just as responsible for John’s death as Moriarty, still had a place beside him after she died. “It’s for show, Sherlock, you know that,” Mycroft had whispered to him, as they lowered the coffin into the ground. “The fewer people who know, the better.”
John felt a sob push up through his throat, and a sort of tenderness that he hadn’t felt since the day the thing had happened. “I promise, Sherlock.”
“It’s about damn time,” said Lestrade’s voice, on the other end of the phone. “Haven’t you got my texts? Two more bodies, Sherlock. Two.”
Sherlock stood up and walked to the wall, opening up each oven and carefully examining it for pie. He kept thinking he’d got them all, but then he realized he’d skipped one, somehow, and moved down to check it, then realized he’d skipped another on the other side. He felt frantic, overwhelmed.
It wouldn’t have been a surprise; no man had more control over himself than Sherlock Holmes, and he rarely let go of that control—the only time John had seen it completely gone was when John was being beaten to death and had watched Sherlock sob outside the glass wall. The memory of it came flooding back, and John felt his heart twinge with sorrow. It may have been thirteen years ago, but to John, whose life had not progressed much in that time, it still felt like it was yesterday.
John’s face was sad again. “I thought I’d go to Molly’s, see if she’ll put me up until I can find a place.” He glared sideways at Sherlock.
He looked at John’s hands, stuck in the pockets of his bomber jacket. That’s what he should have done,
When John comes, it’s blinding. He can’t see anything for a few seconds, just black first and then white, and he knows it’s because he’s shut his eyes so very tight. It’s blinding and it’s enveloping his entire body with spasms of pleasure, and he shudders and yells out something incoherent. He doesn’t even notice until afterward that Sherlock has come too, all over the bed, that he’d leaned down with his shoulders on the mattress and reached one hand back to pump himself to climax. John finishes coming and pulls out and collapses next to him, his eyes still closed and breathing so heavily that his spit is escaping in strings from his mouth. He finally opens his eyes and there are Sherlock’s grey ones, heavily-lidded and watching him, while he tries to catch his breath, too.
“I’m surprised, I didn’t expect you back until the second. How was the trip?” he asked. (Polite. Social. The previous two hours had made him a master.)
,” groaned John, the bags under his eyes impossibly dark. Anna sat on his lap, screaming her head off, as she’d been doing for the past two hours since Mary had gone out for the evening.
“Don’t be absurd, Anna,” said Sherlock, turning the page. “If you’re going to be spending time with them every weeknight, I have every right to want to meet them.”
Mycroft stopped moving and gazed at him, as if he could see directly through his petulance. “You know as well as I do the reason for that.” He sat back and picked at his fingernails, expanding on it anyway. “
Sherlock slipped past the Watson family members he’d only seen once before (at the wedding) and exited the room, unnoticed. He acknowledged Major Sholto with a head nod—which was reciprocated—and moved to stand next to him.
John let out a relieved sigh after she and Anna had left and the door was firmly closed behind them. It had been a stressful few days, but not in the way John had envisioned. He’d expected to be annoyed by Sherlock’s presence, by all his usual oddities: the hours spent awake in the middle of the night, talking to himself and pacing around; the way he left his dirty clothes in a pile outside the bathroom door while he showered (and became cross if he came out and no one had picked them up for him); the way he grazed for food in the refrigerator at odd times of the day, eating with the door wide open and his bum sticking out, paying zero attention to labels such as “FOR DINNER” or “MARY’S LEFTOVERS” (“I was going to eat that for lunch tomorrow! John! Control him!”); the random tramps they’d begun to find in their sitting room, lined up as Sherlock gave them each instructions and payment for their espionage services… the list went on and on.
John gave a nervous giggle and shook her head in agreement, that yes; this place was truly a marvel.
“If I didn’t know any better, I would say you had feelings for this monster,” Moriarty accused, and Sherlock flinched.
“Well darling, as you know, there is a ball tonight to raise Fairlyn’s spirits during this dark time, and you simply must attend. There will be many eligible suitor’s for you to choose from- after all, we must get you married before the bloom has quite gone off the rose,” Mrs. Hudson clucked to herself as she pulled out three massive ball gowns.
John stroked through his mussed curls, knowing how overwhelming someone’s first time could be, and simply laid with Sherlock, caring for him with kisses and whispers of sweet nothings.
- Sherlock still brought out the deepest sentiment John was capable of feeling; the protectiveness and possessiveness growling inside of the army doctor every time he looked at the detective.
“Breathe, and try to relax, it will make the sensations less painful,” John whispered into the sunny bedroom, and Sherlock nodded in agreement, taking a panting breathe and focusing on his muscles, loosening them one by one.
As John basked in the afterglow, but it was over all too soon when he heard the muffled sigh coming from Sherlock. John glanced over and saw Sherlock, eyes still closed and his breathing still deep, but he was rocking gently, thrusting his hips against the pillow he held.
Sherlock continued to observe John, looking up and down his form appreciatively and getting distracted from his case files every few minutes.
“Nonsense,” John argued, “this method is the most effective as it allows the instrument to measure the core temperature. You will have to hold very still, but you’re a big lad, and I am sure you can handle it.”
Sherlock tilted his head in confusion but acquiesced without question, as he often did for John, and followed the man to the coach, sitting on the opposite end and staring out the window into the London night while clutching his tea like lifeline.
He looked… Wonderful. At that thought, Sherlock glanced away from the mirror with a wince, remembering all the times he had been made fun of for his appearance. In an odd way, the beasts obvious self consciousness about his form made Sherlock more conformable, understanding the feeling of being judged for your looks. While their situations were very different, Sherlock still understood what it means to be isolated and alone because of it.
Siger wondered to himself for a moment, the question giving him pause. After a few minutes of observing the surroundings, and feeling confident that he was alone, Siger dismounted Philip and pushed on the huge iron gate roughly, hearing a screech that indicated it had not been used in many years.
The statue depicted a young woman with sharp cheekbones and her collarbones could hold a drink, they were so defined. Her curled tresses ran down her neck and curled just above her small breasts in unruly ringlets. Her eyes were narrowed, much like a predator in the jungle, but she had softness about her features that made the disjointed parts quite… lovely.
Once they had tended to their horses, a young, stammering page guided them both to the council chambers for an audience with the king.
“Leave now, and never return. You will not harm Sherlock or his family any longer,” the beast growled, pushing him away and looking up, seeing Sherlock standing on the balcony just above, looking down him with apprehension and fear in his eyes.
With a shiver, Sherlock nodded for the saleswoman to begin unlacing, which she did with a salacious grin, “so, this is not a purely selfish endeavor. You’re doing this for your lover?” She guessed, and Sherlock nodded, looking away from her knowing eyes in the mirror as she nodded with a giggle.
Then the beast grabbed Moriarty around the neck, hauling them both to their feet and holding the small man in the death grip as Moriarty panted and kicked out.
Sherlock, overwhelmed by John’s soft rocking, the two of them making love in the sun lit bedroom, felt a stinging in the back of his eyes that would not be denied.
The light surrounding him was transforming to a deep scarlet, twirling with the gold to create the intermingling of passion and life. John’s cloak wrapped around his mangled body, and bright beams shot out from his hands and feet.
Sherlock looked at John for a moment, and the silence that descended replaced the giddy atmosphere of the bedroom with a softer tonality, and John was suddenly aware of the warring colors in Sherlock's expressive eyes, how they too were so fickle in their color choice; always fluctuating between a deep blue, emerald and grey, much like the emotions of the man himself, always changing, subtly. How a man so emotive had often claimed the title of high-functioning sociopath was startling to John now. He only has to look into his eyes to see the deep running emotions of that neglected heart.
It was a heady feeling, and despite himself he felt a lump forming in the back of his throat as he watched families, lovers and friends go by, all proudly proclaiming their pride in themselves and each other.
Sherlock agreed while grumbling, and he stripped off his clothes, getting into the large bath that was attached to his chambers and trying to ignore the many objects in the room who were preparing for his night with John. Sherlock was horribly nervous and spent most of the time in the bath scrubbing his skin practically raw and untangling his curls.
“Talking” hands hooking under Sherlock’s panties, gently pulling them from her body, and leaving her bare and vulnerable for the first time in her life. Sherlock looked away, self-conscious. John had never been with a woman, what if Sherlock’s genitalia was not enough?
Michael nodded sympathetically, reaching out to grab John’s free hand across the table and squeeze it lightly, “I’m sorry, but thank you for your service.”
Once upon a time, in a land nearby, a boy was born with dark curly hair, and inquisitive virescent eyes that startled his mother and father the moment they laid eyes on their beautiful newborn.
John drew back the curtains to let in the dim sunlight, wanting to see Sherlock fully, and laid down on the bed.
“Fuck me John, please, I’m yours,” Sherlock said shyly, as if he was not being fucked in pink panties while tied to the bed, unable to escape from John’s member unless he allowed it. John shivered from the overwhelming feeling of control settling over his shoulders.
“Naughty boy, alright, suck me,” John commanded, and Sherlock licked a stripe up the length before beginning to swallow John down, slowly, teasingly rubbing his tongue along the head while his throat constricted and swallowed around John’s manhood.
“You had your chance, we were going to have a lovely evening, but you decided you wanted to be difficult,” John said with a reprimanding sigh, stroking over Sherlock’s flank and secretly reveling in Sherlock’s mortified struggles to escape his iron clad hold on the wriggling detective.
Sherlock collapsed in his arms as soon as he was near enough, and tears began to soak through John’s shirt in the next instant from the adrenaline and fear warring in Sherlock’s overworked mind.
The once dark palace now stood in all it’s light glory, the gargoyles changed into statues of saints and artists, the once desolate landscape full of color and life; the sun broke through, indicating the sunrise of a new day, and the clouds that had always seemed to permeate the castle were no more.
John smiled at him, his eyes gleaming, and he leaned forward to kiss Sherlock languidly, sending a shockwave up his spine.
“Beautiful boys get to come,” John commanded, pressing fully down against Sherlock’s aching erection and marveling at the shout and subsequent wetness that began to spread over his abdomen.
Together they went to the tavern in town, and Mycroft curled his lip in disgust at the drunken debauchery surrounding them, women throwing themselves at drunken men, the smell of yeast heady in the air at rain pelted the outside, causing the tavern to be overflowing with people from all walks of life searching to escape the storm.
” The word had never sounded so exquisite before, but John felt feverish at the single word, his hands clenching and unclenching around his silverware, his eyes tight with concentration on willing away his pulsing erection.
“Not much,” Mrs. Hudson admitted, “but Sherlock has to leave to save his father, and potentially marry another, and John gave Sherlock his freedom to return home.”
Every day, every single day, she plotted to find a new way around her brother’s overbearing rules and regulations, stealing unassuming servant dresses in the servant’s quarters and scouting to find a perfect place to scale the stone walls surrounding the palace.
In the aftermath, in the wake of swirling half-consciousness, Sherlock laid on John’s stomach, with John stroking up and down his back as they tangled their legs together, basking in the glow and endorphins from their intense joining. After a moment John gently rolled Sherlock over, ignoring his grunt of dissatisfaction, and cleaned off their stomachs with a rag, leaning down to mop lightly at Sherlock's leaking hole and ignoring his brilliant blush and kicking feet.
some more,” Mrs. Hudson finished with a salacious wink that had both the men pinking beneath their collars, before she was gone, closing the door with a click.
Jealous Sherlock and caring John in this chapter, beginning to explore kinks in the next. Pure fluff.
After a few moments of the torrid teasing, Sherlock’s cock exploded untouched, the man arching off the bed in beautiful abandon. John harshly tugged at the beads in a swift motion, watching them spill from the pink opening, angling them to slip past Sherlock’s sweet spot as they retreated from his spent arse.
With a groan, and an exasperated eye roll, John quickly flipped the entwined men over, pushing a bright-eyed Sherlock into the bed with a chuckle.
, John thought with a shrug, laying down and closing her eyes, putting princesses and phantom curls far from her mind as she succumbed to sleep.
“Yes, Sherlock, for one,” she said, “but also to show your involvement in the kingdom when the king meets with foreign dignitaries and commoners- you’re such a recluse that very few people know what you look like. You are more than just a girl, you’re a symbol for the realm of feminine beauty and poise-“ Mrs. Hudson cut off as Sherlock rolled her eyes and shot a highly unflattering hand signal to her nanny of more than twenty years.
He checked the bindings absentmindedly to make sure they were hurting Sherlock, and peered at his well-fucked lover. Sherlock was flushed red and panting, his eyes wet and delirious from the overstimulation and the powerful orgasms that had occurred within minutes of one another.
Sherlock only smiled, turning his head to hide his face beneath John’s smooth chin, and whispered against his neck, “it’s our song. Beauty and the beast.”
Sherlock mumbled when John laid down beside him, and rolled over to rest on his chest, still unconscious and exhausted and craving John’s warmth.
John had been unbearably hard when he was spanking Sherlock earlier that day, and with the nipple clamps and dirty talk following, he knew he wouldn’t last long now, his need for Sherlock rising ever higher.
John looked down at him, cradling his back gently with rugged hands as he began to rock slowly, slowly, in and out of Sherlock’s body, careful to not press anymore than half of his length in his inexperienced lover’s arse.
, and allowing his self-loathing to spread throughout his body, feeling sickness rolling in his stomach at the memories of all the times he had shut himself away from John without realizing it.
One finger, then two, and then three- stretching, nudging, seeking. All went questing in Sherlock arse, drawing in slowly and withdrawing too soon, leaving the young detective feeling quite unsatisfied and frustrated under the capable hands of his controlling lover. His arousal was a constant thrumming in his abdomen, and no amount of wiggling allowed him any relief.
While the princess had charmed John entirely, she had not considered that the princess would loathe her due to her position as bodyguard and “babysitter.” It made sense the princess was resentful- John understood the frustration of being overlooked and bossed around.
Still, it was mortifying to be reminded, but Sherlock bit back the rest of his protests, knowing they would only lead to a punishment.
“And I, you sweetheart,” John answered with a final peck, the two men resting their forehead’s together in the silence of the flat, the only sounds emanated from the bustling city of London just outside their window.
John came home from the surgery one afternoon, massaging her aching shoulder with one hand and holding her briefcase and in the other, along with a bouquet of flowers.
John lifted on finger up, pressing teasingly against the pink wetness of the winking entrance, before pushing slowly inside, watching Sherlock’s face as he pressed down against John’s questing finger, seeking out his pleasure.
Sherlock, heart beating rapidly, dashed down the hallway to her chambers, almost running into the librarian on the way and ignoring his cry, “Princess Sherlock!”
John thought, licking his lips and looking Sherlock up and down, his creamy skin glowing in the ebony suit.
Sherlock was taking new cases once again, and consulting with Scotland Yard with the help of Graham Lestrade-
Sherlock followed the beast back down the spiral staircase, observing his capture closely for anything he could notice. Beyond the tattered pants and velvet cloak, his master’s mannerisms- walking on hind legs, ability to communicate, and his use of clothing- indicated to Sherlock that he is human like. Just like the candelabra.
you’re going to come soon, aren’t you? That’s a love, going to come all over my uniform like a good, beautiful boy,” John remarked, “after this I’m going to have you stand in the corner with your hands on your head, your red bum on display for all to see.”
“They will, sir. This-“ she lifted the pair from Sherlock’s hand and lifted them up for him to see fully, “ is a thong.”
“Papa! Sh’lock! Cake now?” She demanded, and Sherlock picked her up with a laugh, allowing her to wrap her legs around his waist as he carried her, holding John’s hand tightly as they walked back down the aisle from whence they came.
Sherlock leaned back, his blue-grey eyes widening and his pupils dilating in arousal, before nodding, turning on his heel and walking towards the bedroom to undress. He loved that John always took control, allowing him to relax and let go of his usually rigidly held control.
While Sherlock nuzzled into him, timidly placing a wet kiss against the side of John's neck, John looked out the window and suppressed a sigh, holding his infernal lover and contemplating his options.
Sherlock, who had gone still with shock and trepidation, holding his hands up in a placating manner, which was belayed by their shaking. He hadn’t realized the murder was still armed. Mistake. Potentially a fatal one.
They all went to the armory, brooms and hairbrushes, dressers and chairs, and picked up whatever weapons the objects could wield, before heading down to the entranceway.
That castle was huge, and while it appeared uninhabited, the deeper he explored down the winding hallways, the more signs of life he was visible. Chairs and tables lined the halls from when the castle was still in use, but most of the places on the wall where paintings had been hung were now missing.
John slide down Sherlock’s body, as Sherlock watched in confusion and delight, wondering what John was doing but grateful that she was still touching her.
But what if John hadn't imagined the way Sherlock had flushed in the cab when John had praised him with a fond “amazing” after his deductions before turning away from John to peer out the window. What if Sherlock had only rejected John at Angelo’s because he simply didn’t understand human entanglements and romantic liaisons?
John took his hands, marveling at how right they felt, even resting on his paws, and Sherlock marveled at the soft fur tickling his fingertips.
“If you’re not with us, you’re against us!” Moriarty said with a maniacal grin, and the crowd cheered in agreement. A group of Moriarty’s gang grabbed at Sherlock and Siger and drew them forward to the cage meant for the asylum, Sherlock fought back, kicking at his captors shins and aiming for their eyes, but all he received in return was a punch in the stomach and a cut on his neck from a knife.
Sherlock, still clutching the white rose, turned slowly and stared at the door, the silent challenge lying in his wake.
John started to stroke Sherlock’s cheekbones, cradling his head between John’s calloused palms and holding him tenderly but firmly, “you haven’t wasted anything Sherlock. I want to be with you, in
He felt like he could run across London, solving every murder case in his wake in only moments. This singular focus, which he had only actively achieved the one time in college he had tried cocaine, was remarkable.
John stood with military precision- her back straightened and her uniform utterly perfect. Her long blonde hair was plaited and in a bun, the only perceived flaw in her appearance was the small blonde fly-aways that circled her head in the candlelight. Like other guards she wore trousers, but Sherlock could imagine John in a beautiful dress while fitting in perfectly with the stuffy elite.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and shook his curls, watching as glitter fell around the pavement beneath them.
“I adore you,” John said plainly, watching in satisfaction as a typical blush stained Sherlock’s cheeks as his small, pink tongue peeked out from behind his lips to begin licking the honey away, his eyes turning downwards in a bashful fashion but a small smile gracing his lips.
"Feminine, I know," Sherlock finished, her flush now traveling down her graceful neck and John leaned up slightly to kiss the edge of that beautiful blush, making Sherlock gasp.
Suddenly it was over, and Sherlock felt a cold glass rod, at least eight inches long, pressing into his slackened hole.
Sherlock nodded, turning to walk back the way he came. When he reached his bedchambers, he fell asleep the instant his head hit the pillow, only one word echoing in his mind.
“He isn’t a beast” Sherlock called out in frustration, “he was a man! He is a good person, please, I’ll do as you ask, I’ll m-marry you. Just don’t hurt John,” Sherlock pleaded.
John held his breath, feeling unaccountably nervous but knowing that Sherlock, usually uninterested in John’s dating habits due to his own apathy, would not likely be homophobic, or biphobic as it were.
Lost in his revelry as he was, John didn’t notice Sherlock’s nervous expression darkening until the man leapt to his feet in a flurry of dressing gown and foul-temper. John tensed in surprise for a moment, before recognizing that Sherlock was out of his comfort zone and therefore lashing out.
John was having an admittedly horrible day. A two year old had been sick on him in the morning, and he had been sneezed on twice as the flu season worked its way through the population of London. As the clock ticked slowly towards the end of the workday, John sighed and put his head in his hands.
Moriarty turned around, walking straight up to the cage and leaning in, “you’re in love with the beast. You’ve fallen in love with him, despite the fact that I am your intellectual and physical equal, you fall for a monster like him,” Moriarty growled, his anger palpable, and Sherlock shivered from the chill of the night around the cage.
Sherlock corrected himself with a sigh, his internal voice beginning to sound an awful lot like a certain army-doctor.
Sherlock lead Philip just inside and pulled the Beast, who was regaining consciousness, to the floor of the foyer, ignoring his groan of pain and calling for Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade to help.
Pulling out his illegal handgun from the back of his pants and aiming, John fired in the next instant before the murder even had time to register John’s action or release the safety on his own weapon.
John reluctantly pulled away, and rolled off the bed to go to the loo. Meanwhile, Sherlock grabbed his phone and checked his messages, groaning when he saw his brother’s name light up.
Sherlock needed freedom like he needed air, and he would find a way to have it, away from this castle and from his husband to be. Always optimistic, his Sherlock, John thought with a bittersweet smile.
"Where were you yesterday Lestrade? You told me you would meet me there?" Sherlock asked, and Lestrade looked down, biting his silver tinged lip, and Sherlock gasped in realization, "you were with Molly weren't you! I hope you two didn't scar Rosie with your goings on; a candelabra and a clock, honestly," he muttered with a childish expression of distaste, and Lestrade only chuckled back in response, sticking a small tongue out at Sherlock in response, which was the point Mrs. Hudson told them to stop teasing each other at the table.
Reaching hand out, he gently drew Sherlock down to lay beside him, looking into his changeable eyes that were smiling back at John.
Sherlock’s mind was racing, trying to absorb the new information and catalogue it in his mind palace, which he wanted to restructure too look similar to this castle with more light and a slightly cheerier atmosphere.
The sentimental moment was broken, however, by a slight buzzing noise emanating from Sherlock bum as John lifted his glass to his lips, taking a drink while Sherlock's mouth fell open.
Mrs. Hudson waiting in silence, and so he went on: “The man told me to wake up, he seemed to know me” Sherlock whispered, blood flushing his cheeks in remembrance of the gently spoken
“I mean, have dinner with me. With music, and dancing,” John elaborated, and watched the realization dawn on Sherlock’s face.
Encouraging his horse to move closer to the dreary gates and castle, Siger spotted a beautiful white gazebo just beyond the doors of the castle, maybe a hundred yards ahead. The gazebo did not fit the architecture of the gloomy and Gothic castle, but rather stood out as a snowflake against a grey sky. Squinting his eyes to get a clearer look, the enclosure appeared to have plants of some kind.
As he grew, due to the endless love and support from his parents, Sherlock learned to ignore the harsh criticisms against his appearance, and grew more beautiful within as well.
“I can’t leave the castle because of the unrest in the kingdom and my own "frailty," and now I apparently can’t even be trusted to leave my
The black babydoll was sheer and simple, with lace overlay delicately cupping her small breasts and held up by lace straps. Her underwear, black panties that rose up slightly on her arse and have them a more rounded shape, were comfortable and nice. Overall, Sherlock enjoyed the lingerie; it made her feel sexual in a way she had never felt before.
Sherlock shifted awkwardly where he stood at the crime scene, lightly hopping from foot to foot and using his coat to cover his burgeoning erection. The natural heat of the June day paired alongside the unusually high humidity levels made wearing his thick Belstaff nearly unbearable in the oppressive heat.
John felt his stomach tighten at the look of dejection on Sherlock’s face, and after a moment, an idea came to mind.
"Sherlock what the hell took you so-" John trailed off, her mouth gaping as she took in the sight of her soon to be lover.
“We have to get up, John,” Sherlock tried to level his voice, and put on his usual impassive mask. But John stared down at him, his midnight blue eyes shining as if Sherlock was more brilliant than the Van Buren Supernova, and Sherlock’s resolve to have a productive morning crumbled under the weight of affectionate, saccharine kisses.
John walked back over to the instrument table, knowing that Sherlock would be able to hear what he was doing and deduce his intentions fairly quickly.
“I love you Sherlock, and even if you don’t want to be with me, I promise it’s just the two of us. No more dating, no more secrets,” John quieted as she grew closer, taking Sherlock’s clammy hands into her own and giving them a squeeze, “just us.”
He had planned to lose his virginity by going out to a random bar in London, finding the least annoying man present, and committing to a brief anonymous sexual encounter. But the longer he contemplated the act, the more anxious he felt, feeling nervousness clawing up his throat and clenching down against his windpipe in a vice grip.
“What If I go to work, but I take the afternoon off and meet you at the crime scene or where you are then?” John asked casually, watching as Sherlock’s eyes brightened and he beamed, and while his grin would have been off-putting to anyone else, John saw the child liked excitement in Sherlock’s eyes at the thought of John joining him.
Sherlock’s large hands clawed at the armrests as he tried to control his pleasure, failing fantastically. The throbbing of his arse around John’s cock causing him heart palpitations, his skin positively dripping with sweat as he wriggled around on his possessive lover’s erect member, feeling helpless to escape the sensations as he was held down.
Sherlock broke away from John’s ridiculous spinning with a laugh, nodding and trying to get his recalcitrant giggles under control at his husband’s idiocy.
John leaned up to gently trail his lips over the plump lips of his detective, sucking lightly on his lower lip and nibbling slightly, smirking at Sherlock’s tentative returning kisses. How the man was still so shy despite their many sexual adventures together so far, John would never know, but he found Sherlock’s bashfulness endearing.
Sherlock waited a moment to ensure John was not following him before he opened the box, his heart speeding up as he viewed the items he had ordered discreetly three days ago. He pulled out some lubricant, a string of anal beads, three dildos, varying in size and function, and a small anal plug. Sherlock laid it all out precisely on the side of bed and felt unaccountably nervous.
“Y-yellow, I’m sorry,” Sherlock panted out, scrabbling his hands over John’s biceps to hold on, clenching his eyes shut and trying to control his transport, his arse tensing, trying to push out the foreign, painful manhood against Sherlock's will.
John fed Sherlock his dinner, every once and a while the food would miss Sherlock’s mouth and dribble down his chin; profiting John to coo embarrassingly about how adorable Sherlock looked with marinara sauce coating his face, and causing Sherlock's arousal to swell ever higher in response.
He trailed one hand from his mouth down to his chest, settling on a nipple and, feeling brave, beginning to tug lightly, wetting the nipple with the saliva from his mouth and wishing someone would suck on them, tug at them lightly with their teeth, soothing the ache with their tongue.
“Sherlock, oh, god-“ John called into the living room of 221B as Sherlock leaned forward to latch onto his nipple, suckling it, while John continued to plow into his willing hole.
John pulled Sherlock up, and Sherlock licked his lips, capturing John’s lingering release and swallowing it hungrily, peering at John with half-lidded eyes as if he had just received release, and not John.
Sherlock stared for a moment longer before his anguished sobs could no longer be contained. He collapsed against John’s chest, burying his face in the soft fur and began pounding his fists on John’s body half-heartedly: “No, John please. Please, don’t leave me,” Sherlock choked out, his hands staining John’s torn shirt with his own blood.
to be taken. John looked down and saw Sherlock's cock becoming erect rapidly, and he mouthed at his tight balls momentarily, basking in Sherlock's overstimulated cries for more, while his body tried to squirm away.
There was blood staining the fingernail markings from the force of the scratches and when Sherlock touched the blood, it was recently dried and cold.
“What…?” Sherlock gasped as the plug like object settled inside of him, and he wiggled his hips around for a moment, testing out the large plug holding him opened, teasing at the corners of his sensitive rim.
“Father, go get a drink and give me a moment,” Mycroft ordered and Siger nodded, turning away as Mycroft began his stroll over to Moriarty, steeling himself.
Adjusting his half-hard cock in his trousers after a moment of looking at the picture hungrily, John walked over to the kettle to make himself a cup of tea.
John smiled, his heart aching at the sweetness of Sherlock at his most exposed, and he leaned up to wipe the teardrops from Sherlock’s face, all the while gazing at him as if he was everything while continuing to make love to him, nudging against his prostate in a rhythmic motion and trying to stem the stinging in the back of his own eyes.
He moved over to the privacy screen and began undressing, putting on the new clothing and ignoring the chattering of the objects- that is,
John was feeling somewhat boastful that he was too large for Sherlock to take fully his first time, but he pushed the wicked thought away, his mind swimming with images of Sherlock.
Sherlock was fending off the wolf who decided to try and attack Philip, hitting the animal in the head and sides with the tree branch until the animal gave up with a growl and also went to attack the beast.
Without conscious thought, Sherlock rolled off of John after a moment and kneeled between his legs, looking up at him with widened eyes.
John was intoxicated by Sherlock, and he wanted to utterly ravish him until he could no longer form the letters to his own name.
“I’ve never loved anyone the way I love you, and I never will,” John said simply, and felt a few droplets of lingering tears hit his chest where Sherlock was resting his head.
“Captain Watson, I am reinstating you to your former command and am inviting you to join the King’s Guard. Will you pledge fealty to your king and vow to protect him, his family, and the realm above all else?”
" Sherlock yelped at the overwhelming sensation of the ice entering his body, quickly melting due to his body’s rising temperature. The ice-cold water trickled out of his stretched hole and ran slowly down the crevice of his arse to pool beneath him on once clean, medical sheets. Sherlock tried to escape to no avail, help by John's hands on his hips at first and then by John instructions to "stay still or else."
The beast and Sherlock were on tentatively better terms; Sherlock agreed not to run again and the beast stared at him for a moment with an unreadable expression before nodding in agreement and turning away, disappearing around a corner in a flurry of his scarlet cloak.
He was scanning the text for a specific section when Sherlock entered the library with a huge stack of books carried in his leanly muscled arms.
“We will go slowly,” John whispered, as if to himself, as the wet heat clenching around the tip of his cock was teasing him to the threads of his control.
Crouching down and leaning in, John watched in fascination, adoring the sight of his spreading blush and the untouched nipple clamps marking him as John’s.
John stifled a naughty grin by taking a swig from his beer while adjusted his trousers subtly. It was going to be a long afternoon.
He loved the way they rubbed just right against his sensitive pucker, causing it to throb slightly. Sherlock suddenly couldn’t wait for John to get home.
Sherlock shook Mycroft's pompous voice from his head, just as annoying as he remembered, but realized he was right.
John reached down to flip Sherlock’s dress shirt over his sweet, upturned bum, and began in earnest.
Sherlock secretly loved her beautiful gowns, she just hated that she was paraded about in them for men's pleasure. She wore her gowns for
Looking at the pornographic photo for a moment longer, John looked back to meet eyes with his lover, who was begging to have his release.
Sherlock thought with a contented sigh, happily swaying in John’s arms to the beautiful music in the candlelight, feeling utterly safe with the once terrifying beast. The scene was like a passage in his sister’s romance novels, but far more lovely, because it was real.
And John Watson may be a stoic British man, but he is not a coward. And he wasn’t nicknamed Three-Continent’s Watson for nothing.
…. Sherlock’s mind raced, trying to find a way to deflect attention from his moan. Deflect attention.
The sensations were driving John to distraction, but he clenched his thigh muscles to keep from moving further, sensing he was at Sherlock’s limit by the pleasure warring with pain in his stormy eyes, his cock having softened slightly.
Sherlock wiggled around, clenching and gasping as the plug tickled his already frazzled nerve endings and remained locked, immovable, inside his most private place, the place that only John had ever explored. And now, John had connected nearly all his sexual desires and experiences to his aching bum, causing his hole to become ravenous for John's touch on a daily basis. And John knew it.
Calmly and silently, John stood from the couch and walked towards Sherlock. He went slowly, but with purpose.
decent," John defended. "I'm a helluva nice guy. I'm too goddamn nice. I  let people walk all over me. I've had enough. I've especially had  enough of Sherlock Holmes."
Not a care in the world. You don’t worry about starving to death, about your loans and your debt coming to get
Sherlock beamed. He'd asked her to say it earlier, just to hear how she would pronounce it, and she'd ignored him. "Thank you. That was lovely."
“No,” John said earnestly. “You’ve changed my life. I…I was so alone before. I was so unhappy. You can’t ever know.”
Mycroft sighed. "He gave it to me. He gave it to the police when he turned himself in for battery and assault. Attacks where the victim is targeted specifically because of their sexual orientation fall under the hate crimes category. As such, I can insure a lengthy jail sentence, if you want."
John blinked. Then he shook his head and pulled the stool out beside him and patted the seat, rewarding Sherlock with a half-smile. “Yeah, okay. Sit.
and rotting in the ground. He hadn't  visited the grave in years. John was dead and Sherlock had just
Sherlock couldn’t wait to call him and gloat. To think, Mycroft had gotten a bigger share of the inheritance because his parents had naturally assumed Mycroft would settle down and get married first. Sherlock decided he was owed some heirlooms…
Sherlock taunted, “Come on then. I’m waiting.” He took his cigarette out of his mouth and tapped it, letting the ash drop on the floor.
Sherlock wiped his face with his shaking hands. He hadn't been called 'boy' in thirty years. "What kind of experiment…?"
Mycroft rolled his shoulders. Composure regained, all hope for the truth was lost. "I'm afraid there's nothing to be done now. It's just going to have to play itself out."
