“But?”
It was a few minutes later - Dean counting sheep and getting nowhere knowing that Cas was
Dean didn’t do Christmas, but then again, neither did Cas - not really.  He played Christmas songs every so often and one year he put up lights to shine through his little apartment window, but besides that, Christmas had always been something that other people did.  People with loved ones.  Families.  Not Cas.
Dean leans against the door jamb and watches.  This is a familiar scene in his life, but here in Dean’s head,
“If something were to happen to me,” Cas said, eyes brimming, “would you take him in?”
By the time he’d brushed his teeth and used Cas’s mouthwash, he felt halfway human, even if his head was still pounding.
He felt exposed and raw and mortified, knowing that Cas was right at that moment reading the contents of his soul, a poetry book that amounted to a 25-page love letter, and he hated that he had done it to himself.
“Of course,” Sam said genially, a little too loud in the quiet of a closing office.
The occupants of the backyard turned to look.  Charlie was there, playing with Willow.  Gilda was in a shawl and smiling at Charlie.  Bobby was halfway through a burger, and Mary - Mary was turned toward Cas.
“No, actually,” the man replied, looking contemplatively at the cover. “This is a gift for my co-worker. Apparently she’s a huge fan but has been too busy to grab a copy for herself.”
Sam straightened.  His nose was red, but his eyes were dry.  His cuffs, however, were suspiciously damp, and none of the spilled dog food seemed to have moved.  He cleared his throat.  “I guess congratulations are in order, then,” he said.  His smile was wobbly.  He moved toward Cas first and engulfed him in a huge embrace.  “I had almost lost hope for you two,” he said, and by the time he turned to Dean, he was openly weeping.
“What the hell - did he say that? He
Dean’s soft, relieved laugh came out of the blue, but it was more than welcome because Cas was on the verge of crying from the hopes that Dean understood.
Dean wanted nothing to do with that particular train of thought.  Eileen had already rejoined the conversation at the commotion, but Gilda was looking at Dean with a frown.  It was the first frown Dean had ever seen on her face, and her sincerity touched Dean.
Cas moved closer.  “Ah,” he said, smiling a little.  “When I say I was productive these past few weeks, I mean I neglected the novel my editor’s expecting and started on a new one.”
“I do say so.  Good night, Dopey.”
Dean freezes just as he opens the fridge. He blinks at Cas. “What?”
“Got eyes in the back of your head?” Dean asks, grinning when Cas turns just to glare at him.
Cas scratched his brow. He realized suddenly that they were no longer just talking about Cas’s spare room, and that maybe they were beginning to uncover the source of Dean’s frustration with Cas’s house hunt. “Dean, you’re - you’re much more important to me than any of the things you just mentioned. Purchasing a house doesn’t change that.”
hadn’t stalled me at the door?”  Dean was grinning.
Dean leaned down further and nudged their noses together.  His hands spanned across Cas’s ribs.  “No,” he said firmly.  “I don’t deserve it, but you’d say yes.”
“Charlie adores you,”  Cas said calmly, “despite my best efforts to warn her away from your idiocy.  It would take a lot to get her to hate you.”
“I was under the impression you don’t remember much from that night.”
Cas was smiling when he answered. “It’s fine, Dean. The wind’s only slightly worse than a regular storm.”
“I met your
Dean took a deep breath. The pungent scent of alcohol and sweat filled his nostrils, but underneath he also smelled Cas’s detergent, sweet and clean. He took another deep breath.
Dean hadn’t told her all the details.  He’d fudged some of them on purpose, actually, but the gist had remained the same: Charlie had been upset for some reason, and Dean had gone to see her.  He tried to smile, but it probably came out more like a wince.  “Didn’t open the door, actually.”
They slid into the front seat. “Then I’ll tell the realtor to look for some properties near you,” Cas said, knowing full well it wouldn’t appease Dean but still wanting to see his reaction.
“I don’t know how to make those things.”
Dean couldn’t stop the oath that fell from his lips.  “Yeah,” he said, unable to stop himself from sounding desperate.  “How?  How do you want me to touch you?”
Claire was still glaring at them on the front step of the house. She hadn’t released Dean’s wrist yet. “What the fuck is in the house, then?” she demanded.
Dean settled at the counter, leaning against it as they stared each other down. It was obvious Cas was waiting for his judgment, but Dean had no idea why. “I’m not gonna disagree with you, Cas. You weren’t happy there. You sure you’re gonna be okay cash-wise, though?”
Charlie’s face was bright red.  She pulled her legs up onto the couch and hugged them to her chest.  “I thought you were introducing me to your boyfriend,” she said a little defensively.  “You never
“Listen, Cas,” Dean said, clearing his throat, “now that we know Jack’s gonna be sticking around, you should know something.”
“Honestly?  Nothing.  Nothing for sure.”
Cas opens his mouth but he can’t find anything to say.  He had known this moment would come eventually, his eyes having been glued to the TV now for weeks, but here in the moment he can’t quite comprehend it.
Dean hung his head. “Why do I have to be so good at cupcakes?” Sighing heavily, he started the car and pulled out into the road. He took Cas’s hand and lifted it to his mouth. He kissed Cas’s wedding band.
Dean took a swallow of coffee.  It scalded his throat, but he managed to ask, “Yeah?  Why’d you come back then?”
When he wandered, dreamlike, back into his bedroom, he found Cas in one of his T-shirts, sitting up against the headboard, staring at his lap.  Waiting for Dean.
Dean closed his eyes.  His hands were fists at his sides.  “With the way this conversation’s going, I’d be glad with whatever ‘sense of the word’ you want, dude.”
“Oh.”  Dean blinked.  “Okay.”
Dean made a disgruntled noise of agreement, then lifted the toast to his mouth. Every movement looked painful.
Dean opened his mouth, ready to argue, but then closed it just as suddenly, deflating. He sighed and ran a hand over his face. “Cas, I don’t mean to be a dick.”
“Cas and I are together!” Dean blurted out.
for a whole year, then I raised a gun to the
“I don’t have the vacation time.”
A few hours later, Dean found his car keys and donned his coat - thick, dark blue, a gift from Sam and Eileen that Cas always silently thanked them for because Dean looked so good in blue and Dean always seemed more confident in it.
it read.
“Just forget it,” Dean continues roughly.  “Please.”
He shouldn’t have looked at Dean, but he did.  His eyes caught the twist of Dean’s lips.  “You haven’t been out of the house or office in weeks,” Dean said derisively.  “You expect me to believe you?”
The two shook hands politely and exchanged pleasantries.
Swallowing hard, Cas murmured, “Try to sleep, Dean.”
Dean and Cas babysat for the weekend while Sam and Eileen took a much-needed break.  Dean and Cas too needed a break, but their break didn’t consist of wine-tastings and beach towns;  they’d been granted two weeks of leave by Bobby, and they’d been spending it learning and relearning each other in Cas’s home.  Dean had retrieved his belongings from the FBI evidence lockup, but he hadn’t been able to get his apartment back.  Luckily, it hadn’t been a difficult choice for Cas to offer his home to his best friend.
“It wasn’t a question,” Cas says.  The fingers of both hands tap along the sides of his mug as he watches Dean.
“We aren’t even dating,” Dean said faintly.
Cas nodded.  Licked his lips.  “In that case, do you want to come over on Christmas Eve?”
Aaron sounded mollified.  “Alright.  Well.  What’s this thing you wanted to talk to me about?”
” Dean groans.
“I’m not here to convince you,” Cas said, still feeling a little breathless. “I’m actually here to ask Dean if he’d settle for my company instead.”
Once he closed the door behind him, he found himself staring down a wide-eyed Castiel, still sitting at the dining table. Dean felt as terrified as Cas looked, and Cas looked terrified enough to bolt. Why
“You haven’t even looked at me since Amara partnered us up.”  It was only the slightest bit accusatory.  Mostly he sounded curious.
Sam was frowning at him.  “Charlie just got up and left suddenly.  She looked upset.  Cas went after her.”
When Cas came back to Dean’s bedroom, he was sans coat and holding a glass of water and a plate of toast. Dean had hauled himself up into a sitting position, his covers pulled across his lap and over his shoulders.
Fifteen minutes later, Cas returned.  His expression was grim, and he was staring straight at Dean.
Dean didn’t move from his step on the backstep of the house, not because he didn’t want to greet Cas, but because he was scared his knees might buckle if he tried.  He watched Cas approach instead, knowing his cheeks were heating at the way Cas’s mouth twitched downward when he looked at Dean.
Dean’s face turns red.  “What’d you just say?”
“What if I told you I don’t care?”
Dean gave Cas a reproachful look, but at least his hands were moving toward the pie.  “If you say so.”  He cut out a slice and placed it on Cas’s plate, rolling his eyes at Cas’s indignation.  “Stop it, you big baby,” Dean said.  “I’ll live if I don’t get the first slice of pie.”
Mary smiled at him, oblivious to the tension.  “Hey,” she said.  “Sit down.  Cas was just saying he was gonna go off on a writing trip.”
But that had been two days before, and Dean hadn’t called or messaged him since.  He was beginning to feel a little abandoned, though logic protested that Dean was probably being kept busy by Mary’s list of chores.
Cas smiled, though he was a little disappointed.  “No,” he said.  “Are you going to head home?”
“I know everything I need to know, Dean,” Cas said.
“You’re gonna hate yourself in the morning,” Cas murmured once he was done, leaning close to fix the covers. “Sleep it off. I’ll be in the living room if you need me.”
dream - and Cas in his dreams is always a little less stiff, a little more affectionate, a little more open.  “How would you put it then?” he asks, curious despite knowing that it’s just his subconscious supplying the conversation.
“I haven’t done that already?” Cas’s brain felt detached from his tongue. He had no idea where these words were coming from.
Dean pressed his cold nose to Cas’s cheek again.  “You should probably join me for bedrest,” he said, his voice a rich murmur.
Cas turned to face Dean, leaning an elbow against the railing. “Care to share?”
Dean laughed.  He planted himself on Cas’s thighs and leaned over the love of his life.  “And if I called your bluff?”
Twenty minutes later, Dean’s phone rang.  He answered it quickly, relieved; both Aaron and Charlie seemed to be intent on asking him questions rather than getting to know each other, and the sooner he was out of there the better.
this weekend but he hasn’t been answering my messages.  I think he blocked me on social media, too.  Do I - uh, need to know anything?”
“So you’re thinking about it.”
Cas ran a hand over his face. “I’m too drunk for this,” he said. He stretched his arms over his head in a excruciatingly slow stretch, then walked over to join Dean on the couch, oblivious to the way Dean was silently saying his first prayer to a deity in years. Cas sat down and sighed heavily when he looked at the tree. “It’s worse from over here.”
“Charlie needs it.”
“I’m not avoiding you,” Dean interrupted, holding up a finger to stop Cas from going any further.
“No,” Cas said quickly. “I just - I want to make sure you know.”
needed and wanted Dean) so Dean had taken to spending his free time wandering the floor, chatting up the interns and drinking more than one felon’s share of coffee.  The agents had been briefed, of course, to be careful around Dean, and Castiel was confident enough in his colleagues not to worry about security, but still -
“Whatever.”
Dean was a liar and a dumbass, and if he returned to an empty apartment instead of one crawling with cops ready to arrest him for being a creep, he’d be lucky.
Dean smiled sadly. “I get that. Sort of. But it’s still gonna be a while before I can wrap my head around it.”
There’s a long pause.  Cas lifts his eyes to watch Dean’s expression, but it doesn’t waver.  The only sign of nerves is in the way his throat moves.  Cas acknowledges the word with a small smile and a lingering kiss to the center of Dean’s chest.  Later, he’ll murmur the word over and over and over into Dean’s hair, his hands on Dean’s ass, encouraging him, and Dean will swell and break with it.
The preparation of breakfast takes either five seconds or five minutes.  Dean’s head is still fuzzy, and it seems like between one blink and the next he’s finished folding Cas’s omelette and toasting Cas’s bread.
On Saturday night, with Mary Ellen asleep in the guest room, Dean kissed Cas’s neck under their covers.  “You know,” he said conversationally, “There were times when I was gone that I really thought I would go insane.”
“I shouldn’t have left.”
Dean closed his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest.  He tried to keep his voice steady and detached.  “Dunno.  Went on a trip.  Don’t even know where he is.”
Dean’s breathing was deep and controlled, his eyes still squeezed so tightly shut they were trembling.  Cas could see the amount of tension in his muscles and despite himself, imagined how it must have felt to keep from crying out when his shoulder was at the vey least dislocated.
They went back to work hand in hand.
The ambivalent mask failed, so Cas covered his eyes with a palm. “Dean, if you tell me you have a family hidden somewhere, I swear to god - “
Cas gripped his gun a little more tightly.  He didn’t move, knowing he was listening to the orders of a felon rather than to the director of the FBI and wondering why it didn’t feel more wrong.
“So,” she said.
As he opened the door, he looked back at Cas, in case it would be the last time. Dean committed it to memory: Cas wearing his white button-down, rumpled from his seat belt; tie undone; eyebrows furrowed as he watched his best friend abandon him to the silence of a liar’s apartment.
And on top of that,
” Dean scolded.
Dean’s mouth went dry. He shoved past Cas before his addled brain got him in trouble. “I’m exhausted, dude. Can we do this in the morning?”
Claire stood up abruptly. “Fine!” she said loudly, waving them away. She opened the register to start counting the day’s profits. “Fine. Just stop being gross.”
“I know,” Dean says. He closes the fridge and then pops the top off of his beer to take a long swig. When he’s done, he just looks at Cas and blinks.
Eventually Cas pushed his beer to the side with determination. He pushed his palms flat against the table like he was willing them to stay still. “Also…” he said. He raised his eyes to Dean. There was pink in his cheeks even though he hadn’t touched a drop of beer. “I was hoping to spend more time with you.”
Cas’s peaceful Saturday was going downhill very quickly.  “What am I trying to do?”
around to see it, but that’s hardly ever true nowadays - because,
“Oh?”
Dean’s eye-roll seemed audible.  “You wouldn’t even have come close to closing those last four cases without me.  Like it or not, I’m
They smiled at each other for a beat, two beats, three beats too long - then Cas had to tear his gaze away before he gave himself away. He put his fingers on his keyboard even though his monitor had gone to sleep.
The way Cas said it - quiet, hesitant, maybe even a little nervous - made Dean look a little closer. He saw it then: the tiniest bob of Cas’s throat. The subtle lift of his chest as he took a steadying breath. The way his eyes danced between Dean’s, searching for an answer.
Dean smiled, huffing a laugh into the air between their chests and licking his lips at the sight of Cas’s dick disappearing and reappearing between their joined hands.  His own erection was impatient in his shorts, but the desire to get off was nothing compared to the desire to let Cas spill all over their hands for the first time.  He pressed a kiss to Cas’s sweaty temple and studied the bow of Cas’s back, the muscles that tightened every time he shoved his hips forward.  He couldn’t see Cas’s face, but he could imagine it just fine: a mess of pleasure and frustration in every clench of his jaw, every lick of his lips, every furrow of his brow.  The sounds Cas was making against Dean’s neck were obscene - quiet grunts and swallows between breaths that shook that sent shivers down Dean’s spine.
The Impala was parked by the curb outside, covered in the lightest layer of fine snow. Dean cooed at the car as they approached, reaching out to her roof and apologizing for leaving her out in the cold.
They were in the Impala ten minutes later. It was twenty minutes after that when Claire began getting suspicious. “I know I’m not from here, but I know this isn’t the way to the courthouse.”
“Didn’t I tell you to sit down?” Cas asked, mostly because it was too much to see Dean moving around Cas’s kitchen like he belonged there.
Cas kissed Dean’s neck. “I was joking, my love.”
“It’s called philanthropy.”
Cas put his hand on the table, palm up. There was affection written in every inch of his expression. “Let’s finish the tree today, then go from there.”
“You sounded sad.”
Cas kissed him. It tasted like salt, and Dean was still crying, and honestly he had no idea what was happening, but Cas was patient with him, kissing his cheek when Dean did nothing but stare.
“Not without you.”
“So,” Dean said eventually, peeling off the label of a Gatorade bottle while Cas mopped up the remaining egg yolk with his toast. “Finally used your key.” A frown at the edge of his mouth spoke of his lingering hangover.
Dean is suddenly aware of the shallowness of his breath.  He closes his eyes and tries to get it under control before the dream slips away.  When he feels calmer, when Cas’s skin beneath his palm is hot to the touch, he opens his eyes.
Cas murmured in the affirmative. He stood there at Sam’s door long after Sam had left.
“They do come with instructions, Dean; you probably threw them out.” Cas took the bottle and corkscrew from Dean and nudged him away. “Go get the glasses.”
“I’m never hearing the end of that, am I?” Dean said.  His happiness was something alive, vibrating so hard under his skin he was sure Cas felt it through the hands around his face.
Cas’s best friend rubbed Dean the wrong way.  “He’s being really fucking difficult, alright?”
Cas had some time ago left Dean to his drinking and gone to speak to Eileen’s parents, and he had been conveniently replaced by Dean’s mom.  He nudged her.  “Who’s that?” he asked.
, but Dean.  His Dean.  The Dean he thought he’d never see again.  Cas covered his eyes with the palm of his good hand and tried to breathe through the mess of confusion and sharp-tipped joy in his heart.  “I don’t understand any of this.”
I’m not perfect, and I know I lecture you more than I should and I’m always irritable, but - “ He sighed, and God, this time it was the most beautiful sound in the world.  “I need to know,” he continued, voice beseeching, eyes wide, “do I really not have a chance?”
Cas took a deep breath.  “Happy New Year.”
Their second kiss was just as soft as the first one, though this time the softness was rooted in tenderness rather than nerves.  Dean hadn’t had the time or the composure to really enjoy the last one; Cas had been on his way out the door to help Jody, and Dean had let the words spill out on the bunker’s spiral steps in the last few moments before Cas reached the door.  So yes, last night’s kiss had been tender and sincere, but it had been born of shock and awe and ended before Dean could properly get into it.
They took sips.  Cas put his glass down and was suddenly reminded that he and his best friend were very much alone in his apartment, about to celebrate the coming of Christmas together, and if things went according to plan, by the time Dean left, he’d be leaving as something rather more than just Cas’s best friend.
“He’s fine,” Cas soothed, putting some bread in the toaster. “Eileen picked him up, and she messaged me when they got home.”
Cas was already warm with his sweater and three portions of scotch whiskey, but Dean’s words warmed him in a different way.  “You are the greatest friend I’ve ever had, Dean.”
Cas looked at his shoes. “Yes, well, when your best friend nearly faints in your kitchen, celebrations kind of take the back burner.”
Dean rolled his eyes.  “I’ve had 16 years to think.”
Cas frowned.  “Is that a joke?”
Dean wanted to run into a wall repeatedly until he knocked himself out.  “Jesus, what was I thinking?”
“I didn’t get you a present,” Dean blurted out. Not surprisingly, saying it out loud didn’t make him feel any better.
Amara chuckled.  “It’s not just you in here.  You think I don’t keep track of how often the elevator doors open?  Whoever you are, come out.”
Three weeks later, Dean parked in front of Mary’s place and stamped out the disappointment he felt at not seeing Cas’s car.  Dean had not heard from his best friend since Cas had left town, but he’d harbored hopes that maybe Cas would show up and surprise Dean.  Because Dean was ready to see Cas.  He had been ready to see Cas for a few days.
Cas looked unsure. “Job search, I suppose. I might explore a different field, something more suited to my tastes.”
“Sammy picked it out,” Dean said. Revealing that tidbit wasn’t in the plan, but apparently he was on a mission to ruin Christmas in as few words as possible.
“I shot her,” Dean said, almost immediately.  “She was aiming at your heart, Cas.  If I hadn’t shot her, the bullet would have -”
Dean had been thinking about that too. Without the gifts, without the music, without the lights - it was just a dinner for two alone in Cas’s apartment. On top of that, Cas was wearing a new sweater, and he’d bought Dean’s favorite whiskey. There was also an apple pie baking in the oven, if Cas was to be believed. Dean looked at his whiskey. Cas had bought new glassware, too.
Dean turned to Cas.  His eyes were intense even in the darkness. “Whatever you do, stay behind this desk and
Cas was distracted by Dean’s lips. He’d never allowed himself to dwell on the thought of them, but now he could barely concentrate on anything else. “What offer are talking about?”
“It’s enjoyable for me,” Dean said, his tongue loosened by the alcohol. “Just gotta put a bow on you and you’d look like a present.”
The business trip was only supposed to last a week, but a hurricane knocked out the power for most of New England and stranded Cas in his Boston hotel.
Cas pressed his palms into his eyes.
Cas had called a few hours prior and canceled their movie night. “It’s our busiest season, and one of my accounts hasn’t met participation, so I have to work into the weekend. I apologize, Dean.”
Dean’s previously perfect life didn’t seem so perfect anymore, not when Dean could count, off the top of his head,
Cas started fostering Jack a year later, and it was apparent very early on to Dean that fatherhood was Cas’s calling. Yes, he was always tired, and yes, he didn’t have nearly as much time for Dean as he did before, but Jack was thriving and Cas was happy - and because of that, Dean was happy, even if it meant losing Cas’s attention to fatherhood.
Dean’s smile didn’t waver.  “If you say so, grumpy.”
“He should know I don’t mean it like that - “
“I don’t know if you remember, Cas, but uh - I’m a few states away.”
is all Dean said.
“Dean,” Sam said, a reprimand. “Were you just never going to pick up the phone?”
An awkward silence fell. Cas put his hand on the door handle and opened his mouth to say thanks, but Dean put a hand on his arm to stop him.
Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “I fucked up, alright? I did. And I’m sorry. But I didn’t keep this from you to hurt you. Dean Campbell is anonymous for a reason - so I can be Dean Winchester in peace.”
Cas begins to dice the onion. He’s never been great with a knife but this time, with Dean’s eyes on the back of his neck, he’s somehow even worse. It takes forever, and by the time forever has passed, Cas’s eyes are irritated from slicing the onion.  Dean snorts at him when Cas turns around, eyes squinted, to wash his hands and rinse out his eyes.
“It worked, didn’t it?” Dean said.  He was leaning in.
Cas was twisting the tool into the cork. “That’s fine. I’ll drink it out of the bottle if I have to.”
Dean hopes his fans won’t give him too much shit for what he does next: he pulls Cas in for a rough hug as Cas walks to the touchline to be subbed.  He doesn’t look Cas in the eye, and shoves him away before either of them do something stupid like cry.
Charlie was still staring at him in horror.  “Dean Winchester,” she said.  “You are not seriously telling me that you didn’t know.”
“Cas, will you be alri - “
Dean lifted a hand in goodbye as Cas got out of the car, and he waited until Cas was in the building to leave. It was sweet and entirely too wholesome and entirely too much, and Cas knew immediately he was in trouble.
“For the Winchester comment,” Dean said. “For interrupting. C’mon, you remember.”
The meal was perfect. The toast was a little on the charred side, and maybe the bacon was a little too crispy for Cas’s taste, but he ate it all in Dean’s apartment while Dean watched from the seat opposite him, and Cas found he had nothing to complain about.
“We’re going to tell them in person?”
Dean snorted. “Yeah, like that’s going any better. I’m not even sure Claire’s going to make it in time for the opening,” he said. He’d recruited Claire to work for him for the summer, but she was struggling to work out her schedule.
“Not particularly.”
“Why would I?” Cas asked. It was close enough to the truth, and the more people who believed Dean to be unavailable, the better it was for Cas. It was selfish, but Cas couldn’t bring himself to feel bad about it.
“This past year shouldn’t even have happened,” Cas interrupted, pausing in his actions to direct a scathing look at Dean.  “You should have been at your own goddamn desk in this office
Dean was leaning on the door frame. He was the only one in the whole office dressed casually - flannel and jeans - but he looked comfortable. Cas was filled with warmth just looking at him.
“Yes, Mom,” Dean mocked, but he already sounded a little less nauseous, so Cas didn’t bother getting upset with him.
Cas groaned.  He removed the hand that had been gripping Dean’s arm with all the force of a vice grip and wrapped it around Dean’s, directing Dean to squeeze a little harder, stroke a little faster.
“Tomorrow.”
“Clear enough?” Dean asks softly, staring at his socks again.  He’s dropped his hands and linked them together in front of him. He’s still leaning against the counter. Cas would be angry with him for looking so goddamn cool but he’s too busy trying to process the fact that Dean has just kissed him.
Cas knew that the Roadhouse was a bar and grill just off the freeway, but that was about it. “Haven’t been,” he said.
It suddenly made sense to Cas why the director so often summoned Dean to her office and why Dean was so willing to go.  Cas waited for a denial but did not get one.  “Right,” he said, once the concept sunk in.  He felt sick.  He looked away, searching for a folder on his desk - any folder - that would give him a reason to leave his desk, leave this office, maybe even leave this whole goddamn forsaken world.
“I’d love that,” Cas said.
Cas closed his eyes.  “I hated you so much only because I… cared for you so much,” he said.  He wanted to say so many other things:
It was a mortifying experience performing for a one-man audience, especially because the one man in the audience was the subject of said performance. Dean stumbled over the most personal parts and butchered the rest, but by the halfway point he learned that Cas didn’t care about the quality of the performance - in fact, after every mangled poem, instead of speaking Cas would just kiss Dean stupid, pushing him up against the end of the couch. By the end of it, Dean was reading poetry with an arm wrapped around Cas, who was busy kissing Dean’s throat.
“Mom?  Hey, Mom… yeah, no, I’m great.  Cas is - Cas is great too.”
“Oh.”  Dean should have been comforted by this fact.  Dean should have had all of his fears about Daphne breaking Cas’s heart allayed.  Dean should have felt like laughing, maybe calling Cas to congratulate him.
Dean detangled his hand from Cas’ and stood up, but not before touching two fingers to Cas’s cheek.  “Be right back,” he said, then grinned before walking away.
Her mouth was grim when she stepped in a little closer to Cas and murmured, “And keep an eye on him.”  She stepped back.  “He has a tracker on his ankle,” she said so that Dean could hear her.  “An alert will be sent out automatically if he tries to leave, but even so agents are checking on it constantly as a precaution.  Alerts will be sent out to a dozen special agents, including you, when he steps outside of any areas outside of the agreement.”
Dean made a noncommital noise as he tipped his bottle back. “You don’t have to do that, man.”
Blindly, Dean reached out a hand in Cas’s direction, smiling when Cas took it.
Cas put a hand on Dean’s back. “Two hours,” he said. “Just a two-hour break, that’s all.”
“If only I could be so lucky.”
“Earlier I said marriage wasn’t in the cards for me,” Cas explained, smiling widely, apparently pleased that he was making Dean cry so much. “I don’t want you to misunderstand - it’s in the cards if it’s you.”
Dean’s dizzy with Cas’s touch.  He touches Cas’s face because he can’t stand not touching him.  “You started it,” he says, all he can think of to say.
Dean scowled.  It wasn’t a nice emotion, irritation, but it was at least better than the sadness Dean had wallowed in immediately following his epiphany.  “Finally answering
“You’re lucky it’s too cold to be irritated,” Dean grumbled, even as he stepped in a little closer.  His elbow brushed Cas’s as he dialed Sam.
Cas handed over his phone with a theatrical sigh. They put their heads together for the next 10 minutes coming up with Cas’s next move.
Dean looks up at him through his eyelashes with a slightly exasperated look. “Where I’m gonna live is not really the most important issue at hand right now.” His eyes dip down to Cas’s lips then back up to Cas’s eyes. It’s an invitation if Cas ever saw one.
“Damn.  Alright.  You think, uh, Gilda might be free?  I don’t want to interrupt the newlyweds.”
Dean conceded that fact.  “Good point,” he said, and Charlie gave him a bright smile.
“I’m sorry,” Dean breathes, desperate.  “I wish you’d forget it.”
he texted Cas.
Cas smiled. Sam and Eileen were having a small wedding, so the groom’s party really only consisted of Dean and Cas. They’d had an impromptu bachelor party at their local haunt, and Sam had roped Dean into a drinking game. “Was the drinking game worth it?” Cas asked.
With a sigh, Cas slung an arm over Dean. His hand spread warm and expansive across Dean’s back. Their shins bumped.
There was a silence that lasted a beat too long.  Dean’s reply had notes of bitterness: “‘I sell out the government,’ as you put it, and yet you think I’d be concerned about a conflict of interest?”  He took a deep breath and added, “I’ll sleep with who I want to, thanks.”
“Hello to you too,” he said, once she had let go.  “I’m surprised you even agreed to see me.”
at the sight of those forearms.) It was only when they stepped back to look at the tree that they realized the issue.
“Should I keep going?” Cas asked.  Dean watched, mesmerized, as Cas’s throat bobbed.
“You’re quiet tonight,” Dean said eventually, after a second portion of lasagna.  “Everything okay?”
There was silence from the bedroom.
Dean turned to meet Cas’s gaze. It was piercing even in the dark, and Dean knew what Cas was trying to say.
When they drew back, their breath came up between them as puffs of steam. Cas’s eyes were still closed. His lips shone. Dean touched the bottom one with his thumb, gratified when he felt Cas’s smile.
Claire hadn’t been able to get a flight in time for the opening, but she’d helped by taking over the social media accounts from Cas, who admittedly had had trouble keeping up with concepts like “the algorithm” and “engagement.” Many customers who came in on the first day were there thanks to her.
It was when Dean was pulling out his credit card to pay that the idea came to him. He smiled apologetically at the cashier and asked for a small favor. “Oh, and a pen, too.”
“Guess it’s better I didn’t end up coming with,” Cas said, and he hated that he sounded a little sad.  He’d been thinking about it even more since Dean had driven away, and now that Dean was there and Cas was definitely
and waited for Cas’s judgment.
He grinned in greeting at Cas. “Hey,” he said. He looked at Cas’s outfit, rumpled after a day at the desk. “Gotta say, I prefer you in an apron.”
Dean mumbled something unintelligible.
“Dean, please do not tell me you’re still going to subject Charlie to your experiments.  Have you told her about Aaron?”
“Please share my bedroom with me.” It took courage, but he said it. “I’ve been in love with you for years.” He touched Dean’s waist. They were still holding hands. “I don’t know how else I can explain it to you.”
“I take it you’re feeling better if you’re making jokes about vomit.”
“Why are you following me?” she said shakily.
“Jesus.  Why do you people speak in riddles?”
His bedroom is not an escape.  Sam’s call went to voicemail and Dean can’t be bothered to return it.  He sits instead on his bed and stares at his hands, stunned.
“Here already?” he asked, wiping his hands on a dish towel.  “You need to stop using your phone while driving.”
“At least it’s furnished,” Cas comments.  The furniture is mismatched and a little beaten, but it will do.
“Whatever,” Dean said gruffly.  “I get it - I’ll cool it for a while if it makes you feel better.”
“You don’t have to believe me,” Cas said dismissively.  He checked his phone.  “Bobby’s coming by to babysit you.”
Cas couldn’t say it out loud.  He could barely think it.  The implications were overwhelming.  He took a deep breath.  And like Dean wanted him to, he assumed.  “Will you sit down, at least?”
Aaron cleared his throat.  He seemed a little disgruntled, but that wasn’t Dean’s problem.  “We should all go out sometime,” Aaron said, looking around at the circle.  He was smiling, but it seemed a little hard around the edges.  “Get to know each other.  I’d love to get to know Dean’s family a little bit more.”
“Thanks,” Cas mumbles as he wipes his face.  When he’s finished blinking away the moisture in his eyes, Cas is finally able to focus on Dean, who’s watching him intently.
Dean grabbed a fork, but paused when he looked at the food. His mouth twisted. “Cas, I don’t mean to be a dick, but - looking at this much food makes me want to hurl again.” He poked at the bacon and turned a little pale.
Cas was about to announce his exit and orchestrate a quick escape from the building when Sam said, “Uh, well, he didn’t really mention
“It sounds like the goddamn apocalypse over there, Cas.”
Dean was on the couch, too busy admiring the way the lights looked on Cas’s face to care about the lights on the tree. “Both,” he said.
“Last week,” Cas said.
“Jesus, you’re a cocky bastard.”
Cas’s mouth was slack against Dean’s collarbone; another moan ripped loose.
“You’re just one dude, Cas,” he said as they left the third house (it was a decent size but needed a fair amount of repairs). “What do you need with a whole house?”
Dean had assured Cas it was fine - “No harm done; don’t work yourself too hard” - but then he’d ended the call and felt something that he identified as
“Took a Lyft,” Cas said, taking the bottle. He didn’t usually drink, but Dean smelled of smoke and cologne and Cas needed something to kill his nerves.
“Al - alright.”
when he confronted his father years ago: full of fear, full of the knowledge that a part of his life was about to end but ready for another part to begin regardless.
Then Cas pushed the thought away -
The breath Dean released rose up as steam in the freezing air. “It’s kind of a plan that should have happened at midnight.”
Cas spent the whole week throwing himself into his work, trying not to think about Dean and Sam’s invitation, but when Friday rolled around and Sam poked his head in to remind him about the barbeque, Cas couldn’t ignore it any longer.
“Why?” she asked suspiciously, looking between Dean and Cas, both in aprons. “You two need a witness for your wedding or something?”
There was a long pause.   “…You’re jealous,” Dean observed.  There was no expression on his face.
Cas looked stunned at Dean’s reaction.  He swallowed hard, but his next words were more confident, buoyed by Dean’s touch.  “Dean, I know - I
“Marginally,” Cas answers.  “But that’s not saying much since all I was doing was answering work emails.”
“Dean?”
Once he’s sure the dream won’t slip away from him, Dean indulges some more.  He’s always amazed at how accurately his brain can recreate Cas.  Everything is perfect about his appearance, from the fresh bedhead down to the scar running up Cas’s leg from when he tore open his shin on a hike.
There was a rush of cold air that stole Cas’s breath away. Dean was at the open window, letting the cold in. He looked toward the door when Cas came in; his jaw was set. At Cas’s confused squint, he shrugged. “Overheated,” he explained. His robe had been tossed over a chair.
Cas, that’s a whole fucking apartment’s worth of shit - you want me to get it here in three days?”
Cas stared at the hand in Dean’s shirt for a long moment.  Dean didn’t know whether he wanted Cas to move away or to lean in more, but he knew that if Cas didn’t make a move in either direction soon, Dean would combust.  He was about to say so, had opened his mouth to say so, but then Cas was taking a steadying breath and tugging the shirt up, eventually getting Dean to lift his arms so he could remove the shirt entirely.
“Shut up and watch
Dean received a message from Charlie in the early evening on Thursday, four days after Cas left.  He was already dressed for bed despite it barely being 8pm when his phone lit up and buzzed on his nightside table.
Cas sent him a picture of a sandwich five minutes later. It was a sad sandwich, but it was a sandwich nonetheless, so Dean just sent a thumbs-up and got back to his own work. For the rest of the week, Cas sent Dean pictures of his food, and Dean did the same for Cas.
Cas turns around.  “You were the one rushing me out of the bathroom.”
Cas touched his thumb to Dean’s bottom lip and dragged it down, a habit that he’d already formed in the short time they’d been together.  “I was scared of who I thought you were becoming.  Thoughtless.  Selfish.  I thought I’d encouraged you to be that way.”
“What do you mean he forgot - “
scaring her to death.”
“Just text him or something,” Sam said. He did a cursory glance over his desk and then patted his pocket for his phone. “I’m sure he’d be glad to hear from you.” He walked out from behind his desk and patted Cas on the shoulder as he walked past. “I’ll see you tomorrow?”
Cas squeezed his eyes shut and pulled the covers over his head.  He didn’t bother answering.
“Sit down and drink my coffee,” Cas snips, pulling down two mugs from the cabinet.
When Cas woke, it was with the distinct sense that he was forgetting something, but his bed was so warm and comfortable that he couldn’t be bothered to care.  He reached around blindly for his phone to check the time.  He hit something else, something warmer.
“Just thinking about something Sam said,” Dean admitted.
implied that he had a problem and that to solve it he needed to get laid, like sex is the only solution to his problems.  The world already glorifies sex, which is something he can’t relate to - ”
“We could...try,” Dean said lamely.  He extended a hand.
“Things didn’t work out with your brother.” Cas knew himself well enough to know that he had to say it without preamble; he couldn’t, however, bring himself to say Dean’s name.
Cas cooks dinner to give Dean a break.  Cas is not a great cook but Dean always clears his plate with relish and claps a hand on Cas’s shoulder before clearing up and starting on the dishes.  Cas lets him handle the dishes to avoid the judgmental look Dean had cast on him the first time he saw Cas washing up.  “You’re using too much water,” he’d said, wincing.
“I really do.”  The details of Sam’s wedding were alcohol-fuzzy.
Later that night Cas texted Dean after two glasses of wine.
In the background of the call, Cas heard raucous laughter.  He became very suddenly melancholy.  He bit down on a sigh.  Dean’s voice was closer now, like he was cupping his hand against his mouth.  “You - uh.  You been drinking, bud?”
“Tempted to dock your pay before you even start,” Dean grumbled. He was avoiding Cas’s eyes.
“Not to you.  Because you care about him no matter what.  But it’s a big deal to him, Dean, and you shouldn’t treat it like a joke.”
“Were they spoilers, Cas?” Dean demanded.
“Anyway,” Dean said, after clearing his throat.  He looked around quasi-casually.  “I should probably go.”
“With my neighbors stuck in their apartment.”
Dean bowed his head.
and now here Dean was doing it again, like Cas was nothing more than a punching bag to turn into tatters.
Dean snorted. “What, do you want me to nap with you then?”
Dean’s eyebrows rose.  His mouth dropped open, just a little.  Then, taking her hand in his, he laughed.  He couldn’t help it.
“Jesus,” Dean said out loud.
Dean and Cas looked at each other. Cas shrugged.
“Did you actually read it?” Dean let a little surprise leak into his tone.
“Never mind,” Dean interrupted. “Eileen, you’re my last hope.”
They stopped at a park on the way back to Dean’s apartment. Baby’s trunk was full of gifts, evidence of a successful Christmas shopping trip, and so it was with satisfaction that Dean leaned against the hood of the car and pulled out his burger from the takeout bag.
“Novak, if you really believed they were… doin’ the do on the side… you would have said something earlier.  You’re too good of an agent to let that slide.”
As he does, the memory of Cas’s gaze saturates his thoughts, and he dreams, but he dreams the kind of dreams he has when he’s awake:
Cas’s cheeks were aflame, but he was biting back a smile.  “You’re incorrigible.”
“They’re… Christmas-themed.”
the message read.  That was certainly ominous.
Dean had had to track Aaron down on Facebook to get his number again.
Cas and the other agents ducked behind cars and approached Dean and his companion silently.   The pair was bent over the open hood of a car, murmuring to each other.  Within the next few seconds, they were surrounded by a small troop of armed agents.
The stay-at-home order continues. The four weeks that the governor’s data had projected at the beginning passes as cases have not shown a decline. Quarantine edges into months. Cas’s hair gets long and Dean laughs every time he catches sight of him. Then one day he runs his hands through it in passing, and neither of them laugh.  Dean just quirks a smile and takes his coffee and goes into his room to start work, and Cas collapses into an armchair because he’s in love with his best friend and can’t stand it.
was all Charlie replied with.  That was an easy enough request to comply with: since Cas had left, Dean had been steadily working his way through the nearest liquor store and had a few six-packs in the fridge already.
Cas’s ex from two years ago.  The relationship had been Cas’s only real serious relationship, and it had ended only because she had moved away to be closer to her ailing parents.  A bolt of cold dug into Dean’s stomach.  It wasn’t that he disliked Daphne - no, she’d been sweet and kind and understanding - but she’d also left Cas in the most pain Dean had ever seen him in.  “That’s.  That’s something.”
“When I’m bored,” Mary admitted.  “Which is a lot.”  She sent Dean a pointed look.  “Planning Sam’s wedding was the highlight of my year, you know.”
Charlie’s eyes were a little damp.  “Is that why he left?”
Dean was fiddling with a corkscrew at the nearest countertop. He had flour across the front of his grey T-shirt and a hand towel hanging from the back pocket of his jeans. His apron and hat were hung up by the back door, and his hair looked mussed, like he’d run a hand through it after he’d hung up his hat.
Then he remembered.  He wasn’t in his bed.  He wasn’t alone.
It wasn’t really an answer to Cas’s question, but Cas didn’t want to embarrass Dean any further, so he didn’t press. He decided to take the burden on himself instead. He thought back to the night before, to the way Dean had stared at Cas when they were alone, to the earnest way he’d said, “
Dean offered him a beer. “You drive here?”
“Feel better,” he said quietly, and Dean was so amazed he couldn’t respond, not even when Cas tacked on, “Good night, dick,” at the end of his sentence, right before leaving the room.
He drew back after the first few seconds, smiling despite Dean’s shock. “Yes, you,” he confirmed. His hands went to Dean’s tie. His voice was thick when he spoke again. “So no, in case it isn’t obvious, I do not want you to ‘fuck off.’”
“Hey,” he greeted.
A long, awkward silence followed. Neither moved. Cas’s coffee mug was warm only because of his hands, still gripping the ceramic so tightly he could imagine it cracking.
He started getting up, but Cas grabbed his hand before he could walk away. If Dean was going to leave him anyway, Cas might as well say it all. “I’m never going to have that apple pie life, Dean.”
Aaron opened his mouth.  Closed it.  Opened it again.   “I don’t understand,” he said, laughing a little bit.  Disbelieving.  “You - you messaged me and introduced me to your friends - “
“It’s not,” Dean says. There’s a trace of anger in his voice, but Cas knows it’s not directed toward him.
Cas lingered nearby in a sweater and a hastily procured scarf, shoving his hands in his pants pocket as the cold sunk in. He had the distinct impression that Dean was stalling somehow.
But Cas isn’t interested in abandoning it.  His eyes are narrowed.  “You only
Cas settled against the arm of the sofa and smiled. “You know I never regret spending time with you.”
Dean looked down at the stretched neckline. He cleared his throat. “You planning on making a habit of that?”
Mary opened the door before Dean even lifted his hand to knock.  “Saw you from the front window,” she explained, then let them in.
“You jackass,” he breathed.
“And I’ll turn up the heat.”
Dean grinned at Cas. Cas smiled back.
Cas floundered a little bit for a topic.  And landed on the worst one possible.  “I think he’s sleeping with the director.”
As Dean pulled out into traffic, he tried to puzzle out what bothered him about Aaron’s answer.  It was phrased strangely, somehow, like Aaron had run the sentences through a series of languages on Google Translate and then turned it back into English.  The reply had made perfect sense, but something about it wasn’t quite right.
Dean wrapped his arms around Cas’s back and drew them even closer together.  “You’re stuck with me forever then.”  There was a smile in his voice when he said, “Making out until we’re senior citizens.”
Helpless, absolutely wrecked, Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Sammy had just gotten married to the best woman on Earth a few hours prior. A few yards away, the people Dean loved were dancing to “The Cha-Cha Slide.” And now Cas was asking Dean to take on the biggest honor of his life in the same sentence that Cas was talking about his inevitable death. Dean’s eyes welled up.
“A better response would have been ‘We’re not kidnapping you, Claire,’” Claire pointed out, “y’know—instead of debating the definition of kidnapping.”
Charlie’s smile soured a little, but she shrugged.  “It’s comfortable, and it gives something for people to talk to me about.”
When Charlie called, Dean had already chugged half of his drink in a preemptive maneuver to make the coming conversation a little easier.
“Well, yes - or no - “
The lounge was half an hour away, and two blocks from Dean’s bar of choice.  He’d
Cas looked at Eileen for help, but she just bit down on a cheeky smile and sat back to observe.
Dean turned away and left, throat tight, knowing that soon, too soon, Cas would turn back to the papers in his hand and flip to the second page in the stack, where he would see the dedication:
“Can we see Santa at the mall, dad?” Jack asked, tongue between his teeth as he scribbled with his crayon.
His best friend kissed him back.
Aaron nodded.  “Yeah, that’s a good idea.”
He would have cringed if that line had been used on him, but the man merely nodded politely at Dean. “It is.”
He called Sam.  “Hey, Dean,” Sam said.  He sounded exhausted.
In this moment it’s almost as if Dean is thinking the same thing about Cas. His eyes dance between Cas’s. His throat bobs. Cas is about to ask what’s wrong, but the words die on his tongue when Dean suddenly puts his bottle down and then lifts a hand to fit around Cas’s jaw. His hand is cold and slightly wet from the condensation. A shaky thumb grazes Cas’s mouth.
He cleared his throat. “Poetry? Honestly I don’t read too much of it.”
Dream Cas blushes like Dean hoped he would.  “Flatterer,” Cas mumbles.  “What do you want this time?”
A joyful smile overtook Cas’s expression. The tears in his eyes overflowed, so what else could Dean do but kiss him?
A hand on his arm startled him.  He looked toward the newcomer and felt both his eyebrows and heart rate rise.
“I didn’t,” Cas said.  He laid his palm on Dean’s chest and let the warmth of his skin sink into Dean’s.  “I still wouldn’t be able to stand not being with you.”
Cas took Dean’s hand and tugged him down onto the couch where Dean immediately boxed Cas in with his arms, eliciting laughter from both of them. The light from the fire made Dean’s eyes shine even brighter.
Cas was helpless. He was hopeless. He didn’t care. “Who else would remind you to eat your vegetables?”
But then he walked out and saw Dean flipping through channels while lounging on his couch and he thought, for the first time,
Cas relaxed his hold on Dean’s shirt, frowning when he saw the damage. “Sorry,” he murmured.
“This past year has been - “
Dean shook his head, pressed his eyes shut tight.  “Alright.  What is it?  You okay?”
passed by the place dozens of times but had never paid it much attention, mostly because the crowd that seemed to gravitate toward the glass double-doors was made up of college kids and twenty-somethings, and while Dean liked to think he wasn’t
Cas put his beer bottle down with a forceful
Cas reached up to touch Dean’s face.  “It’s your own fault you forgot your key.”
Dean pinches the bridge of his nose, trying for irritated but in reality wanting to sink through the floor, maybe fold into himself into such tiny pieces he can float down into the drain with the water leaking from the faucet.  “If denying it were a plausible option, trust me, I’d take it.  But it’s obvious, isn’t it?  All I
“What?” Dean said, with considerably more emotion than Cas.  “Since when?  Okay.  Okay, I’ll be right there.”  He ended the call.  “I’m so sorry, you guys - I gotta go help Sammy.  Willow’s gotten out of the house and they can’t find her.”
Dean sent, and though he immediately regretted it after he sent it, there was a vicious part of him that wanted Cas to know that Dean was upset.
Dean laughed.  It felt nice to laugh again.  He kissed her on the forehead.  “Charlie, you’re a treasure and anyone would be lucky to have you - but no.  I just - I dunno.  Can’t get any sparks going.”  He pulled away and put a strand of hair behind her ear.  “Tried with Gilda, but yeah, nothing going.”
Cas leaned back in his chair - expensive, definitely worth it, and made him look way smoother than he felt - and twirled his pen between his fingers. He felt a restlessness working his way into his veins. “I work here. I don’t know what else you’d expect.” He was flirting - or at least trying -  and he knew it, but he couldn’t help it when Dean was grinning at him like that.
he’s asexual or whatever, dude, what’s the point?”
“I wouldn’t be calling you if I knew, jackass.”
Dean let out the sigh he’d been holding only when Aaron traipsed off to hand Charlie a beer.  Then Mary’s back door opened and Dean had to clench his fist to keep from scowling at the sight of Daphne in her usual sensible shoes stepping softly into the backyard.  An unfamiliar woman followed her, looking about the backyard with a soft, pleasant smile on her face.  Cas followed, then Mary, who had a dark look on her face.
“When things calm down,” Dean murmured, voice hushed velvet, “we need to talk.” There were spots of pink high in his cheeks.
He took Dean’s mug along with his own - though they were both nearly full - and Dean watched helplessly as Cas carried them to the carafe.  Cas’s mouth was set as he refilled his mug, then Dean’s, but then Dean saw his best friend’s throat bob dangerously, and he knew he couldn’t take it.  He’d hurt Cas once, then once again, so much so that Cas had
“Sam,” he said, a little unsteadily, his grip on the doorknob very tight.
Red bloomed high on Cas’s cheeks.  “I love you,” he said again, seemingly out of nowhere.  He sniffed, then laughed a little at himself.  “Sorry.”
“So.”
Cas is frowning, still concerned.  Dean wants to brush away the furrow between his brows.
Dean caught Cas’s expression and paused, licking his lips. He cleared his throat and put the bottle down. “So, uh—things have been pretty good over here,” he said, business-like. “Claire’s been stepping up. Was thinking of taking Kaia on part-time, so long as they keep their hands to themselves on company time.”
Dean let out a triumphant laugh and jabbed a finger in her direction. “Knew you were too smart for Sammy.”
“Because your food order was called.  You didn’t do a thing.”  He tugged down the hand that Dean was raising to get the attention of a waiter.
“An unauthorized field trip?” Claire asked dryly. “You could be charged with kidnapping. You know Jody’s a sheriff, right?”
Dean’s fingers began to itch.  “Say that again?”
A silence stretched on.  Then Bobby asked what Cas could tell he’d been dying to ask since sitting down: “How is he?”
“Hah!  Knew it.  A mother always knows.”
“What’s real?”  Dean leaned down.  He waited for Cas to look at him, then he kissed him.  He would never get tired of it.  “Babe,” he said, indulgent in the afterglow.  “You know me.  You know I’d never make a decision like this without knowing it’s what I wanted.”
Dean stared. A flush was spreading up his jaw. “What do you mean you have two weeks?”
“I dunno,” Dean said, looking at the door and watching the passersby who peeked through the glass. “Maybe you wanted to talk to those women or something.”
That thing was a person.
“But you were!” Dean said.  Then, “...Weren’t you?”  He felt a little hysterical.  “I was setting you up with Aaron and you
Cas sighed.  It was a beautiful sound.  “You’re manipulating me.”
“I want to know,” Cas insisted.
The yard was clean and well-kept, separated from the neighbors’ yards by a tall wooden fence. Along the fence various herbs had been planted, and Cas could smell rosemary amidst the smell of smoke from the grill.
Dean was beaming. He was absolutely radiant. Cas couldn’t believe that his words had made him so happy. Dean was taking in Cas’s face, every detail; Cas would have felt self-conscious but Dean’s expression was so hopeful, more hopeful than Cas had ever seen him in their years-long friendship.
Dean waved away Cas’s concern. “Don’t worry ‘bout it,” he said. Truthfully, he’d purposely dodged the question, but apparently making friends meant getting to know each other. “I’m a - an editor. I freelance, mostly.”
“Yeah, okay,” Dean said again.  He was staring straight at the road.  His knuckles were pale against the steering wheel.
Dean didn’t know where to begin apologizing to Cas.  He didn’t even know what to apologize
Dean’s mouth twitches upward, though his eyes remain closed. “You couldn’t pay me to leave after that, Cas.”
“You were the bait,” Cas said, suddenly understanding, suddenly terrified for the Dean of three years ago.  “He asked you to become - you were a traitor to the FBI, just like she was.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas said, sounding sincerely, profoundly sorry.  He put his mug down and dragged his hands down his face.  “I just - I can’t pretend like nothing’s changed, Dean.”
” he sighs in defeat.  “Fuck.”
Dean made a valiant effort to get up too.  “Let me help.”
Cas puts it away slowly, but he does put it away.  When it’s back in his pocket, he looks back up at Dean, all wide blue eyes and concern.  “Are you feeling okay?  Or… did you… want to talk?”
“And you didn’t wake me up?” Cas said indignantly.  “What kind of houseguest are you?”
“I’m tired, and I’m tired of your so-called philanthropy.  If you want to help Charlie with her nonexistent problems, go right ahead, but don’t be surprised if she throws you out too.  Now please leave.  Lock the door on your way out.”  He walked into his bedroom, closed the door, and didn’t come back out.
XIV.  	Her name was Mary Ellen, and she was two years old.  She had her mother’s eyes and her father’s nose.  She was wearing a onesie that said,
“Of course,” Dean blurted out.  “Yeah.”
They seated themselves in the Impala a while later, and Dean drove them out onto the freeway. Cas didn’t ask where they were going, and even if he had asked, Dean would have had no answer. He’d just wanted to give Cas time to think in a space where nothing was expected of him, and that space was here, in Dean’s car, where all Cas needed to do was exist.
They fell asleep like that.
“You handed me an unpublished manuscript supposedly written by Dean Campbell but dedicated to me. It’s full of poetry. That’s all I know for sure. So to answer your question, no, it’s not ‘pretty obvious.’”
Dean grabbed the painkillers immediately and shook out two pills into his palm. “Any antacids?”
The words soothed a little of the hurt, but that’s all Cas would allow himself to take from Dean. “I appreciate the sentiment, Dean. But I’m not going to ask you to find out.”
“Oh,” Cas said, as if he understood. He swallowed the knot of nerves in his throat.
“So you
A long silence on Dean’s end followed.  “Mom, we’re -”  He sent Cas an apologetic look.  “We’re figuring it out, alright?  It just happened - “  He sighed.  “Yeah, alright.  Yes.  Yes, ma’am.  Uhuh.  Love you too.  Happy new year.”
Cas had turned to watch Dean - because he could now.  “He knows.  I was on the phone with him when you knocked.”
“He’s not into sex.  Big deal.”
But Dean is shaking his head.
It took a few seconds for Dean to react. Worry and hope crossed his face, and it was only after a deep, shaky breath that Dean’s free hand came up tentatively. He touched two fingers to Cas’s cheek, his expression wondrous when Cas didn’t flinch away. “You’re serious.”
VI.  	It was Cas’s first time out of the house without having to walk into an office and see Dean.  It was a Saturday morning, and it was quiet, and it was nice not to have the presence of a felon at the back of his mind.  He was in a good mood.  Coffee in his favorite diner didn’t hurt, either.
She smiled at him in greeting and sat next to Cas.  “It’s nice to see you made it,” she said, taking a dainty sip of whatever godforsaken concoction she ordered.
“I don’t want to sleep with anyone,” Cas corrected, if a little quietly. “It’s not you.”
“Wh - now?”
Cas thought carefully about his next move, but decided eventually, “I’m coming in.”
, Dean thought desperately.
“What the hell was I supposed to say, Benny?  ‘
What if?
Blindly, Cas reached for Dean’s left hand, still a fist by Dean’s hip.  When he found it, he wordlessly guided it to the elastic of his borrowed pajama bottoms.
“I don’t want to bother them on a Friday night.”
The waiter came by with another round of champagne.  Dean took a long draft of champagne.  “See?” he said, placing the empty flute in front of him.  “I love champagne.”
Aaron was staring at her like she was an alien.  Dean knew the feeling.
“I dislike lying to you.”
Aaron gave Dean a curious look.  “Yeah, why?”
“Will you do me a favor?”
“Jeez, Cas,” Dean said.  “You’re making me feel like shit for leaving you.”
It succeeded in one way - Cas became a fan - and backfired in all the rest - Cas consequently became obsessed.
“Why did you call?” Cas asked.
Dean leans in and meets the press of Cas’s lips with his.  The first touch is tentative, but instantly Dean is warmed from the inside out. Every slow press and pull, every new bit of heat, every delighted laugh Cas makes between kisses makes Dean’s stomach flip.  It soothes the tension in Dean, unknotting the fear and mortification of a rejection that was never a rejection, in a dream that was never a dream.
“Shut up,” Dean said.  He leaned in again.
“Yeah, on the floor. Cas had to carry you to the bed.”
“Holidays get lonely sometimes,” Cas said honestly.  “Not a big deal.  There are people worse off.  I still have people in my life who care about me.”
Cas cast a skeptical gaze at the hand. “Are you feeling alright?”
“Great,” Dean said quickly, too loudly in the quiet air.  “I’ll order a pizza and we can stay up and watch a movie or something.”
“Hello, Dean.”
He nudged Cas with an elbow and said, “Spit it out already.”
The way he said it made Cas’s breath come a little more quickly.  “I’m not sure I know what you mean,” he said slowly.
“Save it,” Dean muttered, shoving through the door.  “I’m not gonna force mom to deal with my bad mood, so don’t put me in one.”
“You wouldn’t know what to do without me,” Dean says confidently, kicking Cas’s foot underneath the table.
Dean wanted to scream into a pillow.  He wanted to punch himself repeatedly in the face and
but it sounded hollow.  There was no way Cas had missed Dean as much as Dean had missed Cas.  “Not as much as I missed you, dude.”
“We’re doing that again,” Dean murmured, thrilling in the way Cas licked his lips.
The freeway was Dean’s second home, but it offered no comfort that night.
“I do,” Cas murmured.
Cas looked over his shoulder. Sure enough, he could see Sam craning his neck to watch them walk away. He froze as soon as he made eye contact with Cas. Cas laughed as he looked forward. “You’re right. I should have known.”
Cas’s palms stroked Dean’s back. “Can I entice you back to bed for a nap then?” he murmured into Dean’s hair.
Dean laughed as he searched for a knife.  “I drove here from Lawrence, Kansas - if anything, I’m bothering
Then January 24 came around, and Dean was a year older.  On that day he came out of his room in the morning and sat down at the kitchen table, staring at his phone.  Cas stabbed at the eggs in the frying pan.
“He’ll come around,” the realtor said when she caught Cas watching him. “I’m glad he at least walked in the door.”
Eventually Cas starts joining him for breakfast, but Dean is still without fail the one standing at the stove every morning with a spatula in his hand.
Cas’s mouth went slack.  His lips were swollen already from the tears.  “Yeah,” he breathed.
“This morning,” Dean repeated. “It’s 8PM, Cas.”
Dean shrugged.  “I’m just - Sammy’s done pretty well, hasn’t he?  Gorgeous wife, decent neighborhood, a goddamn puppy.  Damn.  It’s his dream come true.”
Behind Dean, the tap drips a steady rhythm, a bizarrely normal counterpoint to this bizarre reality he’s walked into.  He feels like his world is shaking apart, one breath at a time, and the tap is counting down to its destruction.  “How am I supposed to answer that, dude?”
Cas thought of the smile on Dean’s face on that night and decided he wanted to see it again. “I think we both need to take a break,” he said, getting up from his little plastic table. “You from baking, me from eating.”
He walked out of the restaurant and left Charlie and Aaron staring after him.
He moves toward the doorway, brushing past Dean, but Dean stops him with a hand to the arm.  “Hold on a minute,” Dean says.
Aaron had said.
Dean has to consciously close his mouth.  His throat is itchy.  He swallows painfully.  “What do you - “
Dean called about a day later, sounding exhausted.  “It’s been so long since I’ve been home for the holidays.  Forgot how crazy things got.  I swear there’s 50 people downstairs.  Oh,
“Dean?”
“Then I want to hear it even less.”
Cas takes one step forward.  He licks his lips.  “I don’t know if you noticed, Dean,” he says, in the manner of a man trying to remain composed but on the verge of mania, “but you weren’t the only one who wanted that kiss.”
“Because you didn’t want to expose a felon to one more scandal?  What difference would it have made?  Hypothetically speaking, you’d have cleaned up the bureau of a corrupt director if you’d exposed them. Ain’t exactly a bad thing.”  Bobby let Cas mull it over for a few more moments, then he added, “Y’see, you don’t actually believe what you’re trying to sell me.”
“These aren’t just engagement rings, are they?” Claire demanded.
Cas was at home when he received the message, trying to relax after a long week. He’d had trouble adjusting to his previous 9-to-5 routine and had been looking forward to a good night’s sleep, though one he expected would be plagued, as per usual, with dreams of Dean.
“You are, as always, smarter than you give yourself credit for.”
He let the conversation lapse into silence as he cast his mind for a way to soothe his wounded pride.  Eventually he called for another flute of champagne, and when the waiter brought it to him, Cas’s face pinched, but he didn’t say a word.  Dean counted that as a win.
