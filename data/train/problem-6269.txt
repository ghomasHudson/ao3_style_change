After half an hour of both men ending up in laughing fits and a couple of squashed toes on Tony’s side he’s pretty sure the Captain will never be compared to Fred Astaire. He is however, getting the general gist of slow dancing; though Tony is not going to volunteer to teach him anything more energetic. ‘Alright Capsicle how about you have a go at leading me now?’
‘Get out Steve.’
‘Will do, boss, and Agent Natasha is calling in.’
‘Look we’ve worked out how strong a blast you can contain, now we’re reaching the stage where it’s too strong,’ Tony says, tone close to when he’s facing a problem with one of his inventions. ‘So what we need to do is find a different way of containing it.’
‘Err… yeah alright,’ is the reply, the lawyer looking flustered for possibly the first time Peter has seen.
He’s actually considering trying to hide behind Steve and Bucky right now. Not sure he’s ready to tell Tony the full story yet, he settles with saying. ‘I just got a bit distracted for a few days. I’m back on top of everything now, Mr Stark.’
‘Damn it,’ Quill curses, finishing lacing his boots. ‘I’m more worried about who is going to be helping Drax though.’
‘Has Wade come back yet?’ Peter asks as he stands and stretches, grimacing as his back pops.
‘I’ll get you another one later,’ Peter promises and the trickster grins, mollified, and follows them out. ‘Why do I get the feeling you planned for that response?’
‘I mean apart from the fact he’s an idiot,’ Rocket agrees.
‘Nat you can’t believe the books he has here,’ Peter grins, sitting up straighter and showing her the one he’s currently working through, ‘like not just stuff on old legends like Loki would be able to tell you about. He’s got stuff on different dimensions, and on all these different beings and stuff, and then there’s the stuff on different
Even from here Tony can hear Thor’s battle cry. ‘BRING ME THANOS!!’
Tony simply nods, still looking down at the gun in his hands.
Stay safe everyone. Love always,
‘Right let’s go see the Doc,’ Tony says, letting the helmet fall back into the rest of the suit.
‘Wanda?’ Another voice adds, this one so much softer, as though it’s coming from miles away. Little more than a whisper.
‘Forget Black Panther I want to see Thor and Loki! They’re literally
‘No, I was finding somewhere to hide it in preparation for when I got it.’
‘You were trying to give alcohol to an
Loki laughs so hard he starts to choke on the mead he was drinking. Thor gives his brother a few helpful slaps on the back, which only serves to send him flying forward into the table and nearly face planting his plate of food. The two brothers begin squabbling over Thor’s attempted life saving manoeuvre, and Valkyrie just shakes her head in fond exasperation.
Tony tries to ignore the knot in his stomach and sends a message to Happy. He wants the man to be on standby should Peter need help. Because if Tony knows Peter like he thinks he does, he’s going to help and from the sounds of things he may end up in over his head. He’s not sending him in without more tools. Even if he was intending on holding this particular one back until he wasn’t around to help the youngster anymore.
Tony still hasn’t moved from when he stood up, and he rubs the back of his head thinking. ‘The kid seems to be sensible about the situation, and looks like he’s got a good read on it. For now let’s trust his judgement and I’ll get Happy to give him some pointers.’
MJ frowns. ‘You really didn’t know about this did you?’
‘Just this once, Captain America. I need to make sure you were paying attention during my lesson.’
‘Wong is at Kamar-Taj doing some more research and I am unsure how long he will be, I’ve put some spells up around the Sanctum that will alert me if anything enters and decided it would be better for me to be here so at least one of us will be on time.’
The tension at the table spikes, and he knows the man is watching him intently. Part of the giveaway is the forgotten chimichanga halfway to his open mouth. ‘Would-is-would you like it to be? I mean… would you
was the call you took earlier that had you hiding in the bathroom for the whole of first period?’
‘Each base would have to be able to run independently should the need arise,’ Rhodes points out. ‘Let’s say the organisation is compromised like SHIELD was before, every base would then be shut down unable to access the others. Fail safes would have to be in place so they could continue running and be able to keep information out of enemy hands until the team were able to contact them.’
Please do let me know what you think, if you disagree with any of what I've put across in the story and if there's anything you'd like to see in the future. Next chapter: everyone is finally back!
‘In the main office, boss.’
‘And you didn’t think anyone could be worse than Tony in the medical wing,’ Rhodey rolls his eyes.
‘We’ll keep you updated on any changes,’ T’Challa reassures him. ‘Shall I tell Fury where you have gone when he returns?’
When everyone is back inside, changed into warm clothes and sat snuggled up in groups under blankets with hot drinks they decide to let the Barton children choose the next film. Tony isn’t surprised when Disney is the pick of the day, and they put Hercules on. Peter ends up threatening to web Wade’s mouth shut if he doesn’t stop singing, at which point Wanda joins in with Barton’s children and he covers his head with a pillow.
Tony wants to punch Hammer
Knowing he’ll only complain in the morning if Tony doesn’t, he folds Steve’s clothes before putting them on the chair and heading to the bathroom to finish getting ready for bed himself.
‘Right, yeah.’ Peter doesn’t look up as the mercenary fills him in on what he’s found; there’s nothing that points directly to where Tony is being held, but he’s got information on weapon movements and a couple of drop offs. ‘I went to a couple last night, but no one was talking much, mainly because they don’t know shit. HYDRA’s not stupid, Baby Boy, they aren’t going to tell their secrets to the regular foot soldiers. But I did get the locations of a few destinations and origins of the weapon loads so I’ll check them out and get back to you.’
‘What do you mean you were on a school trip?’ Tony demands. ‘You didn’t tell me you were on a trip today.’
‘Rhodey-’
‘Sam got knocked out when the attack happened, the paramedics are seeing to him now and he’s just come round. But…Clint they took,’ she feels her throat close up and forces the words past the painful lump, ‘they took Bucky and Wanda.’
Stay safe out there everyone!
(See the end of the chapter for
She looks up at Steve. ‘What do we do, Steve?’ she asks.
‘You,’ she whispers, tears falling down her face and she can’t help the feeling of despair that fills her. ‘
‘High maintenance,’ Steve mutters and comes to join him on the sofa. ‘How much has he annoyed you?’ he asks Natasha.
A/N: Hi everyone. I wanted to update mid week but work got a bit insane so I'm doing a double update this weekend instead. I'll probably do the same next weekend as well and then see how many more chapters I have left to write, I'm about halfway through writing at the moment.
‘So what are you doing wandering around most of New York in the past two days?’
Loki laughs. ‘And she’s entertaining in her own right.’
Thor looks the female up and down. She looks almost human, were it not for the antennae that are growing from her head, and the too large eyes; her voice sounds very innocent, as though she were actually a child rather than the grown adult she appears.
‘You want the entrance on the south side,’ a voice says behind them, ‘used to be the old food delivery entrance from what I can gather.’
Rhodes chuckles as he follows Tony out of the dining area, leaving a blushing Wanda with Vision.
Let me know what you thought of these two chapters and Tony's relationship with Peggy. I thought it strange he didn't go to her funeral as he must have seen her quite a bit as a child.
‘They’re not dead,’ she rolls her eyes. ‘Well one of them isn’t. Just starting your program up now; soon we’ll have all of the dirty little secrets they’re hiding here.’
‘Like hell you two bird brains are! Give me to the end of the Yule celebrations alright?’
. And I promise when you aren’t blind drunk, or hugely hungover, I will
‘Still be nice to pick one or two of them off before we have to face him,’ Tony says. Then he frowns as he notices something odd. ‘Say Doc, you wouldn’t happen to be magically moving your hair would you?’
‘How did we end up with both super soldiers on the same team?’ Natasha mimics.
‘Kid think very carefully how you phrase the next thing that comes out of your mouth,’ Tony warns him.
‘Whilst the chefs appreciate the sentiment,’ Loki interrupts, ‘they would like some of their labours to be left for them to sample as well.’
Thank you so much again to all of you.
‘I’ll come with you,’ Bruce says, following behind them. ‘I might be able to give some suggestions to the doctor and can start getting him set up while our friend here goes to find the doctor.’
to be able to do it again?’ Peter demands.
Tony mock-glares at them as Wanda sniggers. ‘Introducing you two? Biggest mistake of my life.’
They climb the stairs and Peter unlocks the door to the apartment he shares with his aunt, and Tony has to marvel at how the two most talkative people on the team are being silent. ‘Aunt May I’m back,’ he calls, though his voice isn’t as strong as usual.
Bucky shoots him a glare. ‘I’m being serious, Steve. He’s working himself too hard and none of us are able to give anything back at the moment. If we don’t find a way to get Tony to realise we can help him out, he’s going to crash and burn. I’m not sure how we’ll be able to pick up the pieces if he does. I’m also not sure how well the team will hold together if he does.’
Steve watches, laces still untied on his second skate, as Natasha glides around the ice like a ballerina, Wanda not far behind her, though a little less graceful than the older woman. Peter is being kind and helping Sam get his balance, the teenager skating backwards like a pro; once the older man is more comfortable, he skates off attempting to catch Wanda and the two end up spinning in ever faster circles, hands clasped in front of them.
There’s been enough snow overnight to warrant a snowball fight. At least as far as Peter is concerned there has been anyway. Laura decides to stay inside with the three kids and May, Mama and Rhodes stay in with them to watch some films and relax. The others all head outside.
Tap. Then he lifts his finger for a second. Taps and rests it on the reactor for a split second, two quick taps, and then again with the tap and rest before lifting it for a second. Tap, two tap and rests, tap. Lift. Three tap and rests. Lift.
‘You can’t be serious.’
Whatever Vision is about to reply with is lost in the loud, ominous cracking sound that comes from across the other side of the street. Screams sound as the side of a building starts to lean over onto the street, the scaffolding around it doing nothing but bending under the weight.
‘Are you ever going to learn to duck those punches?’ Bucky huffs in frustration as he pulls back before giving him a black eye. Again.
‘I know,’ May admits, voice quiet.
‘Because that is exactly how you’d get Ben to give you an extra bag of candy,’ May shakes her head, exasperated. ‘I think I need to speak to Tony about how to handle you.’
Sam had never found training to be the most interesting of activities when he was in the military, it was born out of necessity and only had brief moments of comradery. Training as part of the Avengers is very different. It’s still done out of necessity, but with the wide variety of gear and abilities available in the team it’s never boring and usually has more laughter than frustration.
‘You- what- but –Spidey,
‘What are you looking so smug about?’ Sam asks, eyeing him suspiciously.
‘To be fair,’ Sam tries to defend the absent soldier, ‘he was going to walk by it after joking about how we could win it twice over with him and Steve. But the guy manning the stand heard and said he didn’t believe him, and that he was all talk. I don’t think he realised who we were until after he’d made a couple of jabs at Bucky. Steve and I tried to talk him out of it, but he just shrugged off his jacket and made a point of not using his metal arm and lifted the thing above his head.’
‘What are you hiding?’ he asks in amusement, folding his arms over his chest.
say another word.’ She doesn’t give Sharon a chance to do anything as she drags the older woman behind her with her powers, heading towards a corridor at the other end of the area.
‘Who the hell are you and what are you doing in our home?’ Tony demands.
‘-but I
know, Pete,’ he presses another kiss to his lips, ‘I’d know, and I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself. Besides you deserve more than a quick first time before we have to go and meet people. I want to take you out and wine and dine you before bringing you back and laying you out on a bed covered in rose petals and having you come so many times even your spidey stamina wouldn’t be able to hold up.’
‘Oh wow and you thought
Wanda glances at Strange, hoping for some idea as to what she’s talking about; but she’s too tired that she can’t read his mind. The look on his face doesn’t fill her with confidence. If she had to guess, she’d say he was scared.
‘Sam is, I’m just a bit bruised. I think Wanda’s in bad shape too. Where did you guys come from?’
‘He doesn’t want Doctor Strange to join us for Yule and Christmas,’ Peter sighs.
‘You’re the goddamn target, Tony!’
‘So? Can we meet him now?’ she grins.
‘Have you tried making her a banana split?’ he asks. At the disbelieving looks he receives he adds. ‘What? When MJ’s having her time of the month and being unreasonable we know to take her to have a banana split and if it’s really bad we let her choose the film.’
‘Could you not put in something that could fry the circuits of any air con system?’ she suggests.
to like to him,’ he points out. ‘Plus he’s so eager to help everyone and make them happy I’d find it hard to believe he wouldn’t fit in somewhere.’
Steve’s head shoots up at those words. ‘Wait, what? You care about him as in… what more than a friend?’
Thank you so much for all the support for this story. I hope you continue to enjoy my writing.
‘Then I suggest you release
The man raises an eyebrow and gives him an assessing look. ‘No reason,’ he shrugs, ‘just…you know big party, expensive suit,’ he gestures to what he’s wearing, ‘just thought you might have gone for the first person you found wandering outside hoping to get a pay out.’
As they pull away he hears the satisfying click of the cuffs and feels some of the tension leave his shoulders as Bucky rubs the skin around his wrist. ‘Welcome back to America, Barnes. I hope you didn’t pack for a short stay.’
‘Bruce said he doesn’t like playing,’ he continues, ticking everyone off on his fingers, ‘you two were out, Wade isn’t here, and apparently Peter doesn’t know how to play and wasn’t interested in learning-’
‘He’s beautiful,’ Pepper says.
‘Nope,’ Tony grins at him. ‘And we all know you’re terrible at following orders in the field if you don’t agree with them. This way we skip the arguments.’
‘Tony took me off?’ the woman looks shocked.
Tony nods, and Peter thinks that might be a smile of pride on his face. ‘He’s in the room next to yours, Pete. See you in a couple of minutes.’ He walks up the stairs and leaves them in peace. Peter looks back at Wade and raises an eyebrow. ‘Well, you coming? Dinner smells amazing and there is no way I’m being late because you can’t get your ass in gear. When there’s super soldiers at the table you have to fight to get your portion.’
‘But it was fine! Honestly. I mean yeah there was the one moment when I thought about calling him, but I didn’t need to. It’s not like I was trying to do too much, I promise I would have called if it got too dangerous.’
‘Is that all of them?’ Tony groans, leaning back in his chair.
‘I’m in the quinjet,’ Clint replies, ‘I’ll get to you as soon as I can.’
‘I took her to Homecoming,’ Peter rolls his eyes, ‘and I’m bi.’
move to hurting
‘You think that scares me?’ Ross growls.
‘I also know what Justin Hammer looks like,’ Vision says, standing up, ‘and I’ll be able to scan the area for him once we arrive.’
‘To defying the odds,’ Rhodes raises his glass.
‘I simply wanted to know if he wanted coffee,’ Vision manages to sound a little sheepish.
Thor lands next to Steve from where he’d been outside helping Tony and Rhodes. He hangs his head. ‘I apologise, T’Challa,’ his voice is grave, ‘they managed to reach their ship and their magic user was with them and concealed them from our sight.’
‘I’ve a question for you, Peter, which I meant to ask when you gave this presentation in class,’ the woman is evidently Peter’s history teacher. ‘Why did you decide to choose Sergeant Barnes as your project? What was it about his story that appealed to you?’
need to stop talking about everyone else when we actually get some
‘You’ve only got this focussed because Peter was threatened,’ Steve growls. ‘As soon as someone mentions Peter you forget everything else.’
By the time they’d emerged from their room the couple had discovered everyone else at various stages of eating breakfast, and Wanda and Peter had taken it upon themselves to be the leaders in the decorating ‘mission’. FRIDAY had been instructed to play every Christmas song ever written and there were already separate piles for which rooms the decorations were going in to.
‘Nat? Tell our cat I may need him to catch a mouse,’ he says as he leaves; Natasha, face serious once more, nods and walks in the opposite direction. It takes everything inside Tony not to look back as he leaves the park.
He’s actually surprised to find Wade easy to talk to, and he enjoys their conversation as they clear the table and take everything back into the kitchen. ‘Don’t think I haven’t noticed the way you look at him,’ he says as he fills the sink to wash everything that won’t go in the dishwasher. Out of the corner of his eye he sees Wade tense from where he’s filling said appliance.
Peter opens his mouth to answer when FRIDAY interrupts. ‘Boss? We’ve just had a large group land in the grounds; energy signatures are comparable to those of the Bifrost, and two of the lifeforms are showing as being Thor and Dr Banner.’
‘I thought out of everyone Steve was going to be the laying-down-the-rules father figure, but you blew him out the water,’ Bucky sniggers.
‘Brother!’ Thor leaps to his feet and hurries to the man’s side; he’s still looking decidedly blue and waves his brother away when he gets close.
‘I agree,’ Carol says. ‘The stones must have chosen them for a reason. They should decide.’
‘What are you? Sherlock Holmes?’
are,’ she sobs. Then comes the rage; the anger that someone has taken her friend from her and she suddenly jumps onto his back, digging her fingers into the soft parts she can reach just like he’d taught her to do.
‘May I ask FRIDAY for a scan of your hands? I spent some time in the Healing House when I first learned my magic.’ There’s a few moments where the two magic users look at each other before Strange nods. ‘FRIDAY, may I have a scan of the doctor’s hands please? And do not alert the others to what you are doing.’ After a few seconds a scan appears in front of Loki, who starts looking through them as if he’d been using technology all his life.
me to do, I haven’t agreed anything,’ the teenager huffs.
‘For making sure that Pepper was going to have the dance with me,’ he clarifies. ‘And I’m sorry for what I said before.’
Love always,
Waving goodbye to Ned as Mr Stark climbs into the driver’s seat, Peter makes his way to the other side of the car and climbs in the passenger seat, pushing his bags through the gap into the back. Without caring about the large numbers of people around them Mr Stark speeds off, Peter only just able to secure his seatbelt by the time they reach the end of the road.
he thinks to himself. Then, taking a deep breath, heads towards the door he’s just seen Wanda use. As he walks, he takes in the scans that Karen shows on his HUD. ‘What are you planning to do?’ Karen asks.
His teacher just shakes his head. ‘I’m sure Tony Stark will discuss that with you when you next see him, Parker. Now hurry on to your next lesson before you get another detention for being late.’
Bucky nods and takes the seat opposite him, glad of the coffee table between them to act as some sort of barrier. He’s still not sure he really wants to be asking for this, but he needs to know. ‘I- you took over Clint’s mind when you first arrived here didn’t you?’
‘Rhodey!’ he coughs. ‘Rhodey!’
‘Sounds like a proper superhero holiday,’ the merc offers him the box of tacos that’s been waiting for his arrival. ‘Should I be warning the fire department? Or will it more likely be a horror film scenario that goes down? Ooo maybe I should start placing bets on who’d be the first to be killed.’
has chosen.’
‘The fact you gave me an honest answer and not the one you thought I wanted means I’ll follow Tony’s lead and trust you on this,’ she says after a few moments of silence.
‘I’ll get someone on it,’ Tony says, typing some commands into his watch. ‘Is there anything we can do while you go off on your epic quest?’
the hand gel.’
painful death.’
‘A favour is it Mr Parker?’ Bucky laughs, holding out his hand. ‘Alright you’re on.’
‘Why would you want to wear something so bright that everyone can see you coming from-’
‘With the amount of food we’re making I’m sure we’ll have enough to eat for the whole year!’ Bucky laughs. ‘Still feels strange having all this to eat after growing up like we did, don’t it Stevie?’
‘He’s walked in on us enough times as well,’ Steve laughs, though Tony knows the exact moment he catches sight of them because he starts turning red. ‘On second thought, maybe we should have a word?’
‘Do we have any mint choc chip?’ he asks with his head in the freezer.
‘Yeah, I wasn’t looking where I was going,’ he mutters. Briefly he considers shaking off the arm, but finds he’s too grateful for the gesture.
,’ Steve pouts.
‘You’re literally linked to his brain and you don’t know where he is?’ Tony raises an eyebrow.
‘Tony, stop, this is getting ridiculous. At this rate you aren’t going to be in any shape to take on HYDRA or Hammer when we find them.’
‘FRIDAY?’ Steve adds. ‘Can you get hold of T’Challa? I think we’re going to need to go with the Wakanda plan.’
‘Oh come off it Jacques knew exactly what he was doing.’
Something is wrong.
‘Right. No Bucky and no Steve,’ Tony nods. ‘Now we know Bucky’s name: Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes. With a bit of searching this is what JARVIS picked up.’
project. But that’s something I need to work out and not for you to worry about.’
‘Alright?’
‘You got all that Nebula?’ Strange asks.
how many there are around though,’ Clint points out.
‘Oh, thanks,’ Steve says, blinking at the complete change in helpfulness from this nurse compared to the last one.
His spidey-sense rings out with a name.
‘Steven Grant Rogers I swear to God if you say you are not going to fuck me through that mattress because I’m still recovering I am going to-’
‘Tony you sure you’re alright?’ Bruce asks from across the car.
reason I come down here right.’
Loki has to restrain himself from looking at Thor. ‘Yes he did. More so with actions he took after my first visit to Midgard. What I came to realise was that it was my rage and my hurt that had taken me to where I was and it could take me no further.’
‘Clint and I’ll wipe the floor with you,’ Natasha grins.
Before Tony can intervene Peter’s darted in front of the advancing assassin and put himself between him and the mercenary. His arm is out, hand up in the universal gesture for ‘stop’. The atmosphere in the room has suddenly gone tense.
‘Err,’ Peter looks between her and Tony and gulps. ‘Miss Natasha can you pass the bread please?’
He glances up as the familiar sound of repulsors fills the lobby of the building where the leader’s brought him, and Iron Man comes into view through the blasted out glass doors.
‘Pepper,’ Rhodes is obviously not happy with this, ‘you cannot say what Tony can or cannot do anymore.’
‘Are we talking about Loki or someone else?’
Bucky can’t even begin to describe the emotions wrestling in Loki at that moment.
‘I’m suggesting we agree to a better arrangement,’ Tony says.
‘So,’ Thanos groans, ‘it is my daughters that will be the end of me?’
‘No,’ she replies, finding the fight returning to her again. ‘Agatha is here. I need to face her.’
‘You alright, Reindeer Games?’ Tony asks, kneeling down next to the god.
I did it for Peter.
to be the one to accompany you,’ Peter grins.
‘On your-oomph!’
? Dude you murdered people in front of me, and you think
‘Alright children,’ Tony says as he enters, ‘settle down please, I haven’t had my morning coffee.’
‘Hey!’ he hears Bucky stumble in surprise, obviously being part way through an attack when he disappeared. Hoping his senses aren’t lying to him he lets go and falls squarely onto the man’s shoulders, sending them both falling to the floor and webs the man’s arm down.
‘Thankfully not that often,’ Bucky laughs, ‘it tends to be hidden compartments where people have stored information they don’t want us to find. Between all the different team members we tend to be able to find anything that someone has tried to hide.’
‘Not really that different are you? If he deserves happiness, why don’t you?’ Sam lets go of Bucky’s collar and returns to his work, leaving the man to his thoughts.
A/N: Merry Christmas everyone! Hope you enjoyed your extra two chapters.
Another solider, this one obviously the one in charge, exits the plane followed by a man in handcuffs, then the final two soldiers.
Rhodes nods. ‘And I can understand the Guardians wanting to keep on Gamora’s trail.’
‘Wait!’ Strange shouts after him. Bucky feels white blinding pain shoot through his head and he stumbles, falling to his knees and, dimly, he can hear an answering shout of pain from behind him.
‘Because we’ve just finished Clueless and Wanda doesn’t want to start Bring It On until we’ve got ice cream,’ he replies as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world.
‘Because we’ll do it together,’ is the reply.
‘You alright?’ Wade just nods, but there’s a strange look in his eyes that Peter can’t place. ‘Well I’d say whoever we find first. Clint and Natasha are used to working together so they’re going to be tough anyway; but Tony and Steve are going to be ridiculous to beat working together.’
‘Shotgun!’ a series of voices call out at once, making Peter turn bright red.
‘Of course,’ he says, blinking as if he’s surprised she’d doubt his answer. ‘Do you trust me to be able to help if it goes wrong?’
Bucky smiles and nods as the elevator doors close and they go up to rejoin the rest of the team.
‘The one to actually do, obviously,’ he rolls his eyes at the snickers from around the table.
‘So we need to get them all back?’ Tony asks, studying Strange carefully. ‘This all part of that plan, doc?’
‘We’ve taken out criminals together, and I’ve taken out a supervillain wanting to steal the Avengers’ stuff and you’re worrying about my
Clint claps the teenager on the shoulder with an expression of mock-sympathy. ‘That explains it all.’
‘Well which is it? Yes or no?’
can’t move that quickly.
To say that Natasha and Wanda had not been impressed to get a phone call from Bucky to add to their list of decorations was an understatement. They’d ended up going to pick up Peter from school and then dragged him around the shops for the last minute purchases.
‘Finally! We were starting to think we’d have to send out a search party,’ Bucky greets them as they walk back into the common area.
‘Dad I don’t need to go to-’
‘I’ll get Happy to pick up Pete. FRIDAY?’
Matt takes his hand with what he thinks is a genuine smile. ‘Thank you Peter Parker.’
‘Trying to help you,’ Strange replies, raising a single eyebrow in annoyance. ‘Although if that’s the thanks I’m going to get you can forget about it, Stark.’
Rosie makes a gurgling sound and points at one last picture before her head falls back against his chest.
‘Take it,’ Loki spits, ‘I do not
‘The kind of project that is Avengers’ business only,’ Natasha’s voice has a teasing lilt, but there’s a hard edge to it. ‘If I told you about it I’d have to kill you.’
‘Then why don’t we get started?’ Vision suggests with a smile.
‘Screw you, Wade.’
‘Tell me what happened. You’ve obviously over exerted yourself with your magical abilities. Again.’
The beams snap and debris falls down towards them. Something solid catches him in the midriff and sends him flying backwards. Bucky’s head hits concrete and his visions blurs, both from the dust blossoming around him from the falling structure, and from the struggle to remain conscious.
‘Seriously?’ Steve just rolls his eyes, unable to keep the small smile from his face as he pulls Tony against his side.
‘He will come back,’ the Symbiote gestured at Wade. ‘He wouldn’t leave you when I tried to drive him away, thisssss will not keep him away either.’ And with that he’d disappeared, leaving Peter to wonder when murderous aliens had become almost-friends.
‘Over here!’ he hears someone shout, the sound going fuzzy.
Tony lets himself smile. ‘Do you trust me, Cap?’ There’s a heartbreakingly long pause, so he adds. ‘Do you trust me to get you all back home safely at least?’
, rings unspoken between them.
. So I asked Aunt May if I could have a drink with them and she said yes ‘cause we figured Spidey stamina and all that a few drinks probably wouldn’t touch me.’
, Steve sighs, unable to get the smile to leave his face.
‘Try and turn it off for one night, Nat,’ Tony sighs, ‘you deserve this break as much as the rest of us.’
Steve doesn’t really have anything to say to that, but luckily for him the elevator doors open and the step out into the short hallway that leads to the entrance to Tony’s ‘Cave of Wonders’.
‘Merry Christmas, young witch, did you sleep well?’
‘First off: who are you and how did I not notice you skulking in the back of my lab?’ Shuri points one of her tools at him. ‘And secondly: what are you talking about?’
‘I thought you guys were supposed to be moving to live somewhere else right?’ Ned asks as they collect their books.
Fuck me this hurts.
‘Why was he- you know what never mind. Where’s everyone else?’ she asks.
‘The Mind Stone stays here,’ Tony says, looking at Shuri, ‘until you know for certain whether or not there is hope for Vision. Then we can decide where to go from there.’
The three of them return to the common area to a chorus of shouts. Tony looks at Steve and takes pity on his boyfriend, who looks like he’s caught in the middle of World War Three and isn’t sure which side he should be on. Sam looks like he’s trying to keep the peace with Steve, and the two are stood in the middle of the room; Wanda’s in front of Wade on one side, hands glowing threateningly, with Vision halfway between her and the two soldiers. Opposite them are Bucky and Rhodes, looking like they want to tear someone apart; Loki is still on the sofa where they left him, a faintly amused smile on his face, Thor hovering behind him looking between the two sides and obviously unsure what to do or who to support. Valkyrie is sat at the bar with a bored expression on her face, a half empty bottle of whiskey dangling from her fingers, and a stressed looking Bruce sat next to her.
‘Tony’s getting temperamental,’ Clint tells Steve.
Love always,
She doesn’t react outwardly, not even a sigh. Which she knows is going to worry Tony even more, she’s normally a lot less guarded around him when they do this. The thing is she thinks Tony is the only one who is going to be able to help her with this particular problem, but she’s not entirely sure she’s ready to face it.
‘Pretty simple as well,’ Bucky agrees, ‘and wouldn’t need a lot of storage space.’
‘To walk on, yes, but you don’t walk on them for long,’ the red head explains. ‘When you get onto the ice you’ll push your feet out to the side and glide along on them.’
‘Touch my arse again,’ the newcomer says, in a
‘If we’re going to be based here we need to keep working on getting it cleaned up,’ Hope points out, as she sets a platter of sandwiches on the table, ‘and we need to know if any of it is going to fall down on our heads.’
‘You said you were Tony from R&D,’ Steve ignores his best friend.
to? Shit I can’t believe I’m having this conversation with a fucking teenager.’
‘Course you can,’ he smiles as the teen wraps his arms around him in thanks. Well it’s not like he was going to be able to resist the puppy eyes anyway. ‘You want me to clear it with May?’
‘Yes thank you Wade,’ Natasha rolls her eyes. ‘Just hurry it up guys, I’d say I’m more than halfway done here and I don’t really want to be waiting around for you.’
Tony bursts out laughing. ‘No! Why would you think that?’
‘Couple of hours I think. How’s the rest of them doing?’
‘I hate you. You’re more annoying than Wade.’
‘Wait you have my Christmas present?’
‘That. Was. Awesome!’ Ned says when Peter takes his seat again.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Well what would you say if I said I thought they were real, hmm?’ Tony counters.
Peter takes it and lets the man pull him to his feet and sit him back on the couch. ‘Tony, I saw something in Venom’s memories that-’
‘Then maybe you shouldn’t be such a damned hypocrite and stop holding back during training so we-’
‘What is it that worries you about Tony Stark, Captain?’ T’Challa asks calmly.
‘Which means you’ve thought about it,’ Bruce sighs in a way that is as long-suffering as any sigh Pepper ever gave him.
‘And you’re still a psychopath, good thing neither of us change right? Otherwise, the readers wouldn’t know what was happening!’
‘Err…oops?’ Bucky offers.
‘We’ll be fine, Steve,’ she winks at him, ‘nothing we haven’t done before.’ As she disappears into the jet and the door closes behind her, Steve waves to Bucky sitting in the front seat and piloting the jet. He waits until it’s out of sight, a bad feeling in his stomach, then turns and follows Tony and a still grumbling Peter back inside.
‘Well, well, well look who finally found their way home,’ Rhodes says at the same time.
‘You seriously made this?’ Quill asks holding his up in front of him. ‘Dude that’s awesome!’
‘Hey it’s my wedding day I can do what the hell I like.’
‘You got the Secretary and the Council to rewrite the Accords?’
Wanda can’t respond, she’s too tired, Strange gives her an alarmed look and she has a sinking feeling they’ve screwed up royally. That
if he doesn’t have anything to do. All that’s going to do is make him force himself out of the med bay faster than he normally would.’
‘Rocket was playing with a bomb,’ Scott sighs. ‘When he dropped it he obviously set it off.’
‘Thanks for the distraction, Deadpool,’ the woman says, inclining her head towards the entrance, eyes never leaving Hammer.
‘What? No!’
‘Is that even going to fit anywhere in the facility?’ Rhodes asks as they walk up. ‘Now I see why it wouldn’t fit in the truck.’
pay attention? This is the third time I’ve tried to speak to you.’
bad.’
Ok forget being nervous, now Peter’s terrified. ‘What? But when is it being sent? I mean what will it say?’
‘Oh, hit a sore spot have I, Wilson?’ the clash of axe meeting sword rings out briefly before they part again. ‘Come on, don’t tell me you didn’t think I’d know about you and Spider-Man? I mean it’s pretty obvious. I just don’t know how he puts up with you. Especially that face. Sure you aren’t giving him nightmares?’
promised
‘They seriously think you’d struggle to arm wrestle a girl?’
‘And if I tell you to go fuck yourself?’
‘Just promise me you’ll be careful Tony,’ Pepper looks worried.
‘It’s highly unlikely in any case,’ Nakia adds. ‘There aren’t
‘Lila what did we say about asking those questions?’ Laura chastises her daughter, then looks apologetically at the teenager. ‘I’m sorry.’
‘Is he still sulking?’ Rhodes asks as he walks into the common area later, eyeing the disgruntled Winter Soldier sitting in the corner.
He taps a finger on the report as he thinks. ‘Why not? Inform him I am pleased with his work so far, and warn him what will happen if his improvements do not continue.’
‘I guess… since we hadn’t got round to it when he was alive, I didn’t see the point once he was gone. It just seemed pointless giving you that knowledge when it wasn’t going to change anything.’ When he’s quiet for a moment, May speaks again. ‘Hey. Peter? It wasn’t your fault, alright? You were doing something that would have made him so proud of you, you still are. God knows I’d rather you just stayed in building Lego with Ned, but you spent too much time with Ben to do that when you’ve got these abilities. There is nothing you could have done to save him, Peter. I’m just glad he had you there so he wasn’t alone.’
‘We won’t let them take you, Bucky,’ Wanda says, placing a hand on his arm.
‘Bye, Dad,’ Peter says quietly and, waving, heads off to join his friends.
‘It’s not about EDITH, Pete.’
‘Now, now, soldier,’ Hammer says, a self-satisfied smirk on his face, ‘let’s not be rude.’ Then he does something that makes Steve’s blood run cold. He takes out a red book and opens it, leafing through the pages.
Rhodes glares at him. ‘FRIDAY how many all-nighters has Tony pulled in the past week?’
the ceremony. I’m still waiting for something to go wrong,’ Steve groans.
‘Come here,’ Sam sighs, coming to stand in front of him wearing a matching black suit, ‘honestly, Cap, I thought you’d done this millions of times.’
‘Sam I killed Tony’s parents I couldn’t-’
you doing anyway? You can’t
‘It’s a different type of ice cream made with fruit,’ Ned explains, putting another bowl in front of him. ‘Here’s another one for you.’
‘Well you’re not wrong, Spangles.’
‘Steve?’ where’s Steve. If this is going to be it for him he wants to see his soldier.
She shakes her head. ‘No,’ her voice sounds a little tired. ‘No, I just want to see everyone.’
‘Yeah it’s me, Tony. Stay with us alright? Just breathe with Steve for me. Come on, Tony, breathe.’
‘You never asked?’ Peter responds.
‘Hmm… that’s true. Sucks to be you I suppose.’
-Listen to me, Winter Warrior- he shouts through the link. Bucky’s punch goes wide and he blinks in surprise.
May’s frown deepens. ‘Mr Stark you know I’m not happy with Peter being Spiderman. I’d be much happier if he stopped. But I know he’s not going to do that. Especially not with you helping him.’
he actually feels. ‘I’ve never been very good at letting people help,’ he points out quietly. ‘Just ask Nat: “doesn’t play well with others” remember?’
Steve lets out a shaky laugh and nods. ‘Tony-’
‘Gee thanks,’ the man rolls his eyes. ‘Steve it was going to be
Pepper chuckles. ‘As I said I spend more than enough time with Tony as it is. Besides he organised the SI donation and made it clear that if I didn’t choose to dance with you he’d fire me.’
‘Don’t worry, Steve, I’ve no intention of stealing your man. I’m not sure I’d be able to cope with him as well as you do,’ Loki reassures him with a smile.
‘Of course he agreed to it,’ T’Challa says calmly. ‘Secretary Ross needs to believe he is in charge or none of you will be able to go home. What will happen is we will extract Sergeant Barnes and return him here if it looks as though the healing process will not be completed.’
‘When Tony asked me what had happened he was furious. I’ve truly never seen him that angry. He asked me for the name of the coffee shop, and I told him but asked him not to do anything or it could make the situation worse. He reluctantly agreed once Colonel Rhodes gave me his support. The next time he took Wanda to her demonstration at the military base he stopped at a different café on the way home. Apparently it took a good ten minutes of arguing and cajoling before he managed to get her to go in, it was only when he told her he used to stop there regularly with his mother that I think she agreed.
‘What?’ Bucky demands. ‘And you’re only telling us this now?’
The room fades to night around them and Tony can see Bucky sitting on a motorcycle, in front of them lies a very familiar stretch of road. After a few minutes they can hear the rumble of a car engine, and a pair of headlights coming along the road. Wanda and Vision are already fast at work, red tendrils snaking from her fingers and the mind stone glowing brightly on his head. The car races past them and memory-Bucky pulls out, giving chase.
‘Because as far as Fury is concerned he’s untested,’ Clint points out, ‘and we’re all busy so can’t interfere as much.’
‘Fine?!?’ Sam demands. ‘Tony take a look at your chest. We thought you were going to drown.’
‘He’s made it clear that nothing is going to happen until I’m old enough though,’ and Tony really has to bite his lip to stop from laughing at the petulant tone in the teenager’s voice.
‘What are you talking about?’ Loki demands, voice a little strained. ‘My brother is not on this world, as you can see, so I’m not sure-’
‘And tried to kill him! Before that you would have been happy to leave him to rot in a cell in a government facility somewhere. You didn’t even give a damn if he was innocent or not.’
‘They’re memories. Repressed memories, or ones that were taken from you during your original captivity as the Winter Soldier, but still memories. They must have begun to return as your mind has continued to heal.’
‘Whatever you say,’ Strange laughs, floating along behind his team to their base.
‘You know of him?’ Thor asks. ‘Is he on the team?’
‘Without killing him.’
‘Distract him or train him?’ she raises a challenging eyebrow. ‘You’ve not told him yet about changing your will have you?’
‘Don’t worry, Nick you get a free pass since you’ve arrived halfway through,’ Tony laughs.
‘I may have known Steve since we were kids, Tony,’ Bucky murmurs into his hair, ‘but if I have to protect you from him I will.’
She sees the uncertainty in Tony’s eyes and the way he tries obviously not to look at them down the camera; behind her Bucky is all but growling, and she can feel the hostility from both him and Steve. Daring a look back she almost wishes she hadn’t, because the looks on both of the soldiers’ faces are terrifying.
'Only one person would be stupid enough to try and speak to me this early in the morning,' Tony grumbles, face covered by one hand. 'Put it through, FRIDAY,' he gives the call enough time to be patched through and then continues. 'Ross what do you want this early? I've not even had my first mug of coffee so it better be life or death.'
‘Peter!’ he looks over at Wanda’s shout and leaps up to give her a hug as she runs over to him. ‘How long have you been back?’
‘Omelettes,’ Tony mumbles. ‘In my defence I’m better now.’
‘I know,’ he replies, suddenly finding there’s tears in his eyes. They don’t even start falling before Pepper has pulled him into a tight hug. ‘Honestly, Pep,’ he laughs into her shoulder, ‘how did I survive before I knew you?’
‘I mean…it’s just like a bucking bronco right? Maybe I can steer it?’ the youngster responds. ‘Woah! Hey this thing is really crazy!’
‘What the hell is that?’ Steve asks.
‘Wait! We can’t take this one, we’ve been looking at all those-’
‘Shit.’
‘I want to be
There’s no actual question in anything she says, but Peter knows there’s one anyway. He looks at his hands resting in his lap and sighs. ‘Deadpool turned up.’
Peter catches sight of the two new arrivals to the room. ‘Tony? Can I stay here? I think it’s going to be safer.’
Loki says.
‘Way to get morbid Point Break,’ he rolls his eyes.
‘Fury?’
Peter feels a weight on his shoulders and looks to see Bucky, metal arm sitting around his shoulders in a move that he’s sure is supposed to half intimidate Flash and half show Peter his support. ‘That all it is, Pete?’ the Winter Soldier asks.
‘Somehow I am not surprised,’ Strange chuckles.
‘I’ll wound you properly if you don’t stop eating all the sliced fruit,’ Valkyrie mutters. ‘And leave my mead alone!’
,’ Peter moans.
‘Wanda,’ Vision’s voice has a note of warning.
and you disappeared! Are you a super baby or something?’
‘Then Flash decided to try and make out Peter isn’t as involved with the Avengers as he actually is,’ MJ continues.
Steve’s right. Thor’s down on the floor, Mjolnir resting out of reach as he struggles to hold the sword Thanos is pressing towards his chest away from him. His left arm has the gauntlet, which has fused to his arm, and is laying useless at his side.
‘Do what you want, Rogers.’
‘It makes me wonder if Gamora and I would have been like that had she still been here,’ the blue skinned woman admits.
The Cloak wraps around him and starts dragging him further into the Sanctum.
‘Ah ha!’ Tony finds the brick he’s been looking for, pulling it out to reveal a key hung on a hook inside the space behind it.
A/N: Hi everyone. I hope you continue to enjoy this story. There's a couple more weeks of double chapter uploads left and then I'm afraid it'll be down to a single chapter a week. Sorry!
‘Yeah well I’ll start asking every new person who walks in if their name is Wade Wilson,’ Weasel says, deadpanned.
So now that's over: thank you for everyone who is still reading and commenting. Please do let me know what you think of this chapter. No one guessed who the old man was Tony was talking to! I feel slightly proud of this.
Her frown deepens. 'You can explain a few things to me,' her tone turns hostile, and Tony blinks in surprise.
‘No way kid I need you next to me to keep me standing. Steve fusses too much, at least you know when to let me stand on my own feet again,’ he gives the teenager a warm smile, the boy practically glowing with pride.
‘Aww you’d tear down your lab just to stop little old me? I feel so special. This is much better than flowers and chocolates. I do think the traditional gifts are just so boring now aren’t they? So unimaginative.’
, he muses to himself.
‘Why?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Makes sense that he wouldn’t understand about the guy that brings gifts to everyone who’s been good,’ Tony teases the trickster, earning himself an eyeroll.
Peter thinks, hurriedly pulling the mask down before turning to face Deadpool. ‘What do you want now? I’d quite like to swing around and do a quick sweep before going home.’
Tony and Peter arrive back at the facility, but their talk is cut short by an attack.
Wade doesn’t respond, just pushes Peter’s mask up to his nose and presses a kiss to his lips. ‘I got my very own spider-kiss!’
Steve sees Bucky nod and can’t do anything as the man raises his gun.
‘Wouldn’t dream of it,’ is his soft reply, and he stretches out his arm along the back of the seat, his fingers just brushing the hair at the top of Tony’s neck. The other man says nothing, simply leans his head back and closes his eyes.
‘Yeah, that’s the one. Turns out it was experimentation to make latent mutant genes come to the front. They, uh, tried lots of different ways to get my gene to work.’
As they all head towards bed they are a little lighter than they were before. Now they’ve got a few more avenues to investigate it feels as though there’s a little more hope.
‘Yeah I worked it out. Doesn’t take a genius,’ Bucky smiles sadly. ‘I’m not going to lie and say it didn’t hurt, but I get it. Was only a matter of time before someone chose you over me again,’ he laughs a little. ‘Just like with Peggy. Seems all the dark haired beauties with the mind of their own and a take-no-prisoners attitude prefer blonds. You’re a lucky man, Steve Rogers.’
‘Papa Stark rears his ugly head,’ Bucky sniggers.
Peter tries not to let his nerves show, reaching for the sauce instead. ‘Is that what this is?’
‘Take a closer look at the badge, Pete,’ Tony answers, ‘what does it say?’
‘Loki what happened?’ Sam speaks up and Loki looks around the room, meeting the worried gazes of the team.
‘Nuh uh,’ Wade shakes his head. ‘Fury wanted me to take this so that it wouldn’t immediately be traced back to the Avengers and alert HYDRA that we’re onto them. We get out before all the mayhem kicks off they are
Peter just smiles, standing on his toes to press a kiss to Wade’s lips, and it takes everything inside him not to chase the younger’s lips as he pulls away. ‘Just send me a text or
‘Baby Boy? You alright? Do you need-’
A/N: Hey everyone! I hope you enjoyed FINALLY getting to the Stony! Hopefully this makes up for all the crap I put Tony through in the last few chapters.
‘What?’ the inventor looks up in surprise. ‘But the doctor’s said it was impossible, that my chest would likely collapse if the reactor is removed; it’s basically holding me together in more ways than one.’
‘If you’re ready, we’ll go,’ Matt gestures to the stairs behind them and they follow the vigilante up and out of his apartment, letting him fill them in on the site as they travel across the rooftops.
Valkyrie looks at Loki with a raised eyebrow. ‘Was it always this entertaining preparing for the feast on Asgard?’
Rumlow looks the most smug Steve has ever seen him. ‘It would be our pleasure, Mister Stark. What exactly would you need us to do?’
spider you know. And why won’t you say that to Natasha?’
‘Uh huh,’ she smiles, ‘so whose fault was it when-’
A blinding smile creeps onto Steve’s face, and he puts his other hand up to frame Tony’s face. ‘There you are.’
‘That is genuinely the worst argument I have ever heard,’ Tony says. ‘Justin Hammer tries to build things, that doesn’t mean I want to be in the same room as the guy.’
‘Yeah, after Ross tried calling you,’ Peter yawns.
Peter’s heart sinks at the news. ‘And she doesn’t want to accept help from Tony it seems,’ he muses to himself. ‘Hmmm,’ he taps the table as he thinks. ‘Hey, FRIDAY? Has SI been looking into any products to do with food production?’
‘Care to enlighten those of us not considered a genius?’ she jokes.
‘So what happened to you?’ Bucky asks.
‘Excuse me,’ they turn around in unison at the female voice behind them, ‘I couldn’t help but hear you mention Thanos. Did you say you are trying to defeat him? What has he done?’
Tony shoots him a look out the corner of his eye. ‘Not helping, babe.’ Then he sighs. ‘Fine you two get this monstrosity out the gates, I’m not going to try and manoeuvre it in this small space, then come back and get the “normal” one onto the back of the truck,’ he air-quotes the normal part of his sentence. ‘Rhodey I think I got an idea of how to do this. Then you,’ he points at Bucky, ‘can call Nat and Wanda and explain to them that they now need to add outside tree decorations to their list of things to buy.’
‘There’s more? But you guys already spoiled me with all those sets,’ Peter starts to protest.
‘You know, Francis, not only would the
‘I…’ Wade shakes his head. ‘Look, thanks Stark but this,’ he sighs, pointing to his head, ‘there’s a whole lot of crazy up here starting with the looks department.’
‘Hey! What about me? Am I just an ornament now or something?’ Sam demands, flying down to take out some others who are making a move towards Steve’s back.
‘Yeah, I’ll fill you in on most of it on the bus,’ Peter laughs, ‘and I want to hear all about you.’ Mr Harris calls for them all to collect their bags and head out.
‘Why not just get them now?’ Rocket asks.
Bucky asks, ignoring Strange’s question.
‘Shall we perhaps leave that until tomorrow?’ Steve suggests, wiping his arm across his forehead. ‘I mean we have just cut down a tree that’s probably three times as tall as us, and twice as thick as the Hulk.’
‘Everything is absolutely fine,’ he reassures her, ‘I don’t know why you assume the world is ending every time I call you.’
‘Tony,’ Loki says in warning as four figures appear down the path he’d just gestured to. His daggers materialise in his hands and he slips into the familiar defensive position.
‘You’ll have to do better than that if you want to catch me Deadpool!’
Peter winks at her and turns to face the approaching man, who stands nearly a head and a half taller than him. ‘Bring it on, tough guy. Just don’t go crying to Mommy when I wipe the floor with you.’ That earns him a chorus of laughter from the surrounding people and bets start being played as he drags Wanda over to the table.
‘No problem, Captain,’ the cheerful voice responds, ‘just following orders.’
Tony gives a barking laugh. ‘Don’t try to make me feel better, kid.’
‘What he told you is true,’ comes the reply.
‘You mean apart from when you saved my life by stopping Rumlow from shooting me?’
‘Thanks again, Tony,’ he says as he passes the inventor to follow the teen.
As always, here's your sneak peek:
‘What film?’ Steve asks.
‘He’s alright,’ Wanda says, though her tone betrays her edge of doubt, ‘FRIDAY would know if he wasn’t right?’
‘Sir! There’s been intruders!’ of course one of the few guys to actually make it into work today decides to reappear at this moment and warn him.
‘That doesn’t mean you have to
‘He is,’ Loki smiles up at him, blue eyes dancing as they take their places in the lines.
‘Double burger with extra cheese and bacon.’
‘Oh really? Why?’ he asks, hoping his voice sounds casual.
‘So much wrong with that sentence,’ Betty says.
‘Huh,’ then after a pause he asks. ‘So what else is on the family calendar protocol apart from my morning coffee?’
‘Is he conscious?’ she asks, heart pounding in her chest as Vision puts another guard through the wall.
‘Don’t say it,’ Tony cuts him off before he can open his mouth.
‘Hey, no harm,’ Peter reassures him before the guard can hyperventilate. ‘I’ll see if I can find out what happened. You’re just doing your job.’
‘Any idea how long we have?’
Tony laughs. ‘I imagine they’ll be worse with Wade here this year.’
‘So basically,’ Rhodes summarises with a heavy sigh, ‘they’ve disappeared into thin air. No one knows anything about HYDRA. No one has seen anything, heard anything,
‘All those in favour?’ Natasha asks. The table is unanimous.
Tony turns to look at the figure hunched on the ground, metal hand on his knee and the other tangled in his dark hair. To anyone else he looks like the epitome of despair, but Tony’s spent the best part of two months with the guy and he notices that the tension in his shoulders is just a little less than usual. Almost as if a weight has gone, a small one, but a weight all the same.
‘Now what are you doing?’ Mama walks out the kitchen, hands on her hips and fixes them all with one of those “I know you’ve all been misbehaving” looks that mothers always seem to have.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony feels that everything goes in slow motion as he sees Thanos lift his hand, the concealed knife now in plain view, and he sends it flying towards Peter, whose face is no longer covered by the mask of his suit.
‘Shit, Tony.’
‘How often do you find secret passages?’ Betty asks.
Natasha shakes her head with a sad smile. ‘No. Unfortunately this is as much about making alliances as it is about having fun. How about we try and convince Tony to throw some more parties? Even that gala was nothing compared to the ones he can throw when he puts his mind to it.’
The girliest screech Tony has ever heard has him banging his head on the bottom of the boiler the next morning.
Head swimming slightly, Steve opens the fridge door and pulls out the milk. ‘Tony told you to have my coffee ready?’
He’s not quick enough and the Titan flips them so he’s pinning Thor to the ground, the axe between them as Thanos tries to drive the blade into his brother’s chest, and Thor struggles to keep it away.
‘And make sure the soundproofing is on.’ Then he makes his call. ‘Your Majesty,’ he greets the man on the screen.
‘Ok, where’s the suit?’
‘What?’ Steve looks up at the gauntlet and sees Tony’s right. Somehow Thanos has gotten the stone from Strange.
Tony’s brain knows that Steve means well. But his gut reacts to the words and he turns on the soldier. ‘Did you not just listen to a word I said? The suit stays with Peter.’
‘Hey! I’m gonna get you too!’ Wade continues his song.
‘Might I ask why you find it so abhorrent to take on your birth form?’ Vision asks.
The grin on the teenager’s face could have split it in half. ‘Are you serious? Dr Banner that’d be so awesome! I’ve loved reading your papers for years! Like how did you even think to try using gamma radiation with-’
of all people,’ he can’t keep the bitterness out of his voice. ‘Especially to let him carve me up worse than those bastards did in the cave; and no one is going to want someone with a cold piece of metal for a heart, so there’s the playboy out the window. Soon I’ll only be of any use with the suit, and even then-’
‘How did you get out?’ Bruce demands. ‘What the hell happened to your hand?’
‘So if you’re from Stark Industries I’ve got to ask: is it Matt you want to speak to or his horned friend?’
If you motherfuckers think for one minute I am going to let Tin Can do his big sacrifice play, you got another fucking thing coming. Fuckwits.
‘Good to see you up and about, Reindeer Games,’ Tony says from the sofa. ‘Can I get you a drink?’
‘Whatever you say Mr Stark.’
Tony hits the floor hard, trying to roll so the
‘Ah you’ll be fine Pete,’ Tony waves him off, ‘you’re on a school trip you’re not going to be anywhere near the kind of shady spots Clint likes to spend his free time in. Your teachers have more sense than that and you’ve got better taste.’
The two adults laugh. ‘Go see Clint, kid, I’ll bring your suitcase up.’
‘I’ll go,’ Bucky stands up, ‘plus I’ve got experience with jail breaks.’
Tony’s reply is cut off by a pair of excited voices running past their door screaming: ‘Merry Christmas!’
‘What would you like to do this afternoon?’ Vision asks as they walk along hand in hand. ‘I believe there is a special exhibition going on at one of the galleries, shall we have a look?’
screwed up royally.
arguing.’ With that he speeds off towards the bulky looking alien. ‘Heads up, tough guy, let’s see what you’re- oomph!’
‘And that’s
Sam chuckles. ‘Don’t try and pull the wool over my eyes, Quill, I’m a trained councillor and I’m used to dealing with this group of craziness. You telling me you’re not finding it a bit overwhelming when it’s your first Christmas since being taken from Earth and since your mom died? Not to mention the fact that this team excels at being over enthusiastic and loud at the best of times.’
squad you will follow that order or shall I report you for insubordination?’
‘So, you agreed so that you could get me to spill my secrets not to help find Wanda and Bucky?’
Steve sighs, letting Tony’s hand fall from his. ‘Alright. Long story short, something seems to have gone wrong when the arm was being attached to his brain and now it only works intermittently, it’s causing him huge amounts of pain that even the strongest painkillers can only take the edge off, and there’s an infection set in that the doctors can’t get under control.’
Tony doesn’t say anything at first, waiting for the sink to be filled before turning off the tap and pushing up his sleeves. ‘I’ve also noticed the way he looks at you.’
‘No you’d be right there. Alright young man, you’ll do. Now come sit next to me and entertain an old woman, all I hear from these two is technical mumbo-jumbo. I’m hoping a sensible soldier like you can actually talk about something I can understand for a change.’

‘We need to find a way to get the team’s profile up with the public. We need to get them seen and appreciated as individuals rather than just as part of the team. Kind of like Cap is.’
‘Yeah, just tired,’ he mumbles, leaning into his boyfriend and fighting back tears. ‘I just want to sleep and forget about all of this.’
Steve and Natasha share a brief glance.
‘You faced it? Out of your own free will?’ he asks as they watch memory-Peter and Loki turn to leave the room.
of what is troubling you.’
‘Yes, sir,’ he says meekly, following the orders he’s been given and landing on the grass, sprinting towards the helicopter. Some of the wreckage is starting to burn and he leaps forwards to get the bodies out, when several men surge out and he finds himself busy just defending himself.
‘Can we stop now? My head hurts.’
Peter gives her a sheepish grin. ‘One of them tried. Once. Didn’t dare to do it again.’
‘He’s using the Time stone,’ Wong says, coming up to their group. ‘I’d guess he’s using it to look into the future.’
‘No it’s not… it’s just, he’s a bit older than me.’
‘Please find his off button,’ Steve mutters to him.
‘Don’t you worry, Peter, I made sure there’s plenty of food made for tonight’s dinner,’ Mama Rhodes reassures him.
‘Oh, err, you’re welcome? Though I don’t think you would have been in that situation if I hadn’t of been there in the first place.’
‘Peter, you know there issss a way to defeat him,’ Venom says.
‘Errm…I’m looking for Sergeant James Barnes, I was told he was brought up here?’
Wanda has a small smile on her face as she pulls away, trusting him to keep his promise. No one’s ever done that before. He decides he quite likes the feeling as the four of them head towards the parked car, Tony’s arm staying protectively around Wanda’s shoulders, just in case.
‘Tony?’ Steve’s question cuts her off; the soldier is looking at him worriedly. ‘What’s wrong?’
Love always,
Peter laughs. ‘True.’
‘Bucky I need to go with Tony to speak to the Council, can you take Pete down to the training room? I was supposed to spend the morning with him.’
‘What are you doing?’
‘We are not having this argument,’ he crosses his arms over his chest, ‘and anyway Wanda didn’t exactly run screaming when she saw them either so that just proves my point!’
He looks back towards their opponent as he hears a grunt of pain from Steve, seeing the soldier has been thrown against the side of a building and is climbing to his feet, a little disorientated. The big alien picks up a fallen lamppost and swings it towards the blond in an arc.
‘I thank you good lady,’ Thor says, the relief evident in his voice and features.
Tony smiles and puts his hand on the boy’s shoulder. ‘Because I know you, Pete. There’s not one thing you’ve put your mind to that you’ve failed in yet. You remember when you said you just wanted to be like me, and I said I wanted you to be better?’ The boy nods. ‘You already are, in every way. There’s no one else who could be my heir in anything Pete, either in SI, in the Avengers, or as a man.’
