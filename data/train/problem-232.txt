Hazel splashed through the water, turning around and around until her head was spinning. Water, water, all around and the blue sky above. No sign of John.
“I’m a genius, John. Sex isn’t that difficult to understand.” The eyeroll claimed its own physical space. John thought he could see sparks go up where it collided in mid-air with the sinister emanations being put out by that lecherous grin.
“Oh, come off it, Bill!” John said, batting the other boy’s hands away from his face. “I’m not under any evil enchantments.”
And Sherlock pressed close, then - and then, pressed closer still. His hand found John’s, open and already waiting. Their fingers folded together, each hand one half of a prayer.
“Hmph,” he said scornfully instead, opening his book to where he had left off, in the middle of gruesome account about a man and his dubious, dangerous usage of a Snarfalump. There were an awful lot of tentacled plants, Sherlock noted.
John’s lungs contract with breath stopped and his body tense and stopped and his brain tries to catch up but then that stops, too.
Sherlock set his cup down and pressed his hands together, a gesture that let John know - with a little flutter of excitement - that Sherlock was about to explain A Thing.
Things Sherlock clearly didn’t have any problem with, as he peered around John’s bedroom through the window.
"Well,” John allowed, “maybe he's a fighting-evil, heroic kind of detective. Maybe he's the only one in the world."
It was a terrible expression on him because it made Sherlock’s insides feel all pressed together like that, all tight and unhappy.
"Come to think of it, I think it was both," Bill said contemplatively. "John has two mothers and one of them is a dwarf and the other one is a house elf."
Little square boy from Nowheresville, country bumpkin from a town where the people are vastly outnumbered by cows. You look at him and you think cornfields and open blue skies and goddamn sunshine.
His heart was still pounding after the lights went back on, his breathing just a little bit faster. The daylight was especially bright when he stepped outside. Oh
” said Bill, nodding sagely. “And like, if you stopped being seen with him the rumours would stop, you know? For both your sakes.”
“Next one I throw’s gonna be a rock!” John called up, “Don’t think I don’t mean it!” and started searching for something suitably-sized.
The man has a razor-gaze, and just one look up and down is enough to make an incision line and make John want to spill his insides out. All that sin bubbling up inside of him, pouring out.
"Yes, it is spiked," Sherlock says. "But not with very good alcohol. Come on. I'll get you much better stuff."
Hazel wailed, loud and long, pitched in the tones of sheer heartbreak. It was a sound that only a mother can know.
Wet hands cupped John’s face then, and Sherlock pressed their mouths together, touching light and soft.
She touched it with trembling fingers, and breathed out deeply. “Oh thank goodness, it’s dried. Does it hurt?”
Someone who was, somehow, sublimely unafraid of what might be going on, out in that dark night. Who possibly knew the answers to the mysteries that John had lived with his entire life.
The plastic of the bouquet rustles in John’s hand, his palm sticky with the bare and bleeding stems. He sucks in a deep breath. They are both quiet then, looking down at the name etched in smooth black marble. The leaves whisper all around them as the wind twists its way through the cemetery trees.
He had never felt this way about anyone before, not even the girls he’d had crushes on throughout his young life. No one had ever made him feel like he had lightning crackling underneath his skin and storm brewing in the core of his body.
The wall now looked strange in its emptiness. The nail remained as a black dot, like a fly floating in milk; a sea of white.
"Think about how good it's going to be, when you're all stretched and ready for a fucking," Sherlock says, focused on the slide of two fingers, the tightness of John's body around only two fingers.
Sherlock with all the knowledge in the world like he’s holding out a shiny red apple, and just a little taste couldn’t hurt. Just one little taste like the forbidden touch of tongue inside his mouth. The rush in John’s body like running too close to the edge of the cliff, never knowing if the next step is fall or fly.
John is sitting cross-legged on Sherlock’s bed, cold beer in his lap, held in place by his legs. Victor is lolling about on the other side of the bed, long limbs half-dangling over the edge, and not particularly caring, three sheets to the wind already. He’s humming a tune to himself that’s very familiar, but John has trouble placing it.
It was natural, of course, for a pleasant little cottage house near the shores of West Wittering beach, populated by a family of four (six if one included the dog and cat), to come upon its fair share of sand. Particularly during the summer months, and particularly when that family of six included a quite rambunctious young girl and a very active small boy along with the dog and the cat.
“Some girls,” Sherlock says, “can climax from pure stimulation of their nipples alone.”  John inhales sharply, his chest already caught in rapid rise-and-fall of his elevated respirations. Sherlock gives one nipple a sharp pinch to watch his mouth fall open, hear the sort of sound that pours out.
The day after Sherlock had solved Lestrade’s latest little puzzle, he swanned into the living room, dropped into his chair and said to the air, “I want you to pose nude for me.”
“There’s a button on it, what does it do? Does it explode?” Sherlock asked. He was suddenly very intrigued, with his thumb stroking over the raised part of the paw pad.
Her lipstick was so bright one of the chaperones would make her wipe it off later. She grinned at him and said, “Come on, snake, let’s rattle!” as if it were Sadie Hawkins but it wasn’t. “I could tell you’d wanna ask me, so I saved you the trouble.”
Sally only laughed a little, quietly and not unkindly. “You’re an interesting one, John,” she said. “Who are you?”
An impossibility he didn’t want to think about; the phantom feeling of hands upon his skin, the often-revisited dream weight of someone on top of him…
“We’ll start out with a  slow song. That ought to be easy enough for you,” said Sherlock, as he took John by the hand and pulled him up from his seat. “A simple box step. Four count: 1, 2, 3, 4. Come on, put your hand on my shoulder. Ready?”
If he had the Galleons he’d pay a magical painter to paint a portrait of that look, for those blah days when he needed cheering up.
The sound of the front door slamming shut awakened Hazel in bed one night. They always locked the front door at night, and so she froze, the muscles in her arms and her chest hard and tense, listening in the darkness.
“You cheated,” John accused, breathless, still giggling. “You must have. I could have kept running forever.”
John shudders, fear and intrigue in his eyes at the suggestion. No one has ever told him that was possible, no doubt; Sherlock himself had to learn it from fast girls and faceless adolescent fumblings. John's hips shift and rub beneath him, despite the fact that he's just come. John's mouth remains slightly open, inviting, even after Sherlock withdraws his hand.
John was certain that anyone who cast an eyeball at him could see the glow in his cheeks and the absolute perversion in his mind. His sin was written all over his face. The evidence of his crimes was tattooed all over his skin, everywhere he’d been kissed.
His lips were soft against John’s, and John remembered belatedly that he should close his eyes or something. Sherlock’s lips parted and he exhaled; his breath was a warm sea breeze, wafting inside of John’s mouth.
John poked at him with one foot, but Sherlock only grinned and hooked an arm under one of his knees. “Trust me, John. I know what I’m doing.”
Because Sherlock? (Could it be Sherlock, really, Sherlock, suddenly, Sherlock?) - well, whoever it was, standing in front of him, Sherlock-clone or Sherlock’s long-lost-twin brother or not-Sherlock, what-have-you - there was no denying that he did look ridiculous.
John wasn’t afraid of the dark - not since Mummy had explained the truth about monsters and the good forces that fought them -  but he did wish that he’d brought a torch.
“Come help Mummy with dinner, John,” Hazel said. “You can make animals out of the dough and then we’ll bake them.”
Occasionally there were advertisements in the Lost and Found section of the Classifieds for missing pets, but they only ran for four, maybe five days at the most.
Sherlock settles himself over John, pinning him down with his weight and trapping him against the bed. John laughs and shoves at him now and they wrestle, half-playfully, half for serious, not knowing what’s at stake but Sherlock thinks that the stakes must be very high indeed, when he knows John always favors his left shoulder, when he looks at John flushed and laughing above him and when he hears himself say, “How about one day I take you far away from here.”
Takes John's peepers off and lets them drop into the front seat. Wouldn't do to get them twisted or broken; John might get in trouble with his mama.
The knocking didn’t come again, and John lay awake in bed for at least another hour, just to make sure.
of the last bell sounded out like an alarm clock, the halls suddenly filled with clamoring students, metal lockers clanging, everyone fighting to get their books, their bags, running out to catch their buses.
But now, right here, right now, in this space, there is only the sound of John’s panting breath and the warmth of John’s body pressed against him, shivering with the fervor of tiny earthquakes.
The sun shone through the window, casting rainbow flecks of color upon the parishioners. Bits of green and blue upon the carpet, drops of red upon the parishioners.
” that strange croon of his name that lulled him, Sherlock’s hands gentle upon him, petting him, and - it was just as before. His hips had stilled in their movement, John’s mouth was uncovered, and Sherlock was simply nuzzling the side of his face, moving down to that sensitive place on his throat that made John shiver, no reason to fear.  The place of dreams.
There was the burning sensation of fullness but the pain wasn’t like before because he’d been stretched (
For another moment, John stared at him as if Sherlock had begun speaking in very rapid French. Then his lashes fell to veil his eyes, his lips parted, and something indefinably alluring happened to his posture.
And so they were. They were only a block or two away from his house now, and John had never been so relieved.
“I assure you, Mr. Holmes, I am not trying to poison Mr. Watson,” Madam Pomfrey said, with such supreme calmness that John greatly admired her.
Sherlock did not appear to share his very legitimate fears, but then again, Sherlock had not broken anybody’s nose. (Pity, that.)
The three points of pleasure lit up inside his brain like a Christmas tree. John writhed freely under Sherlock’s weight, the burn and squirm of humiliation in his stomach mingling with the heat of his desire. It was all just pure molten arousal, in the end, and Sherlock was the one doing this to him. Caught off-guard, he yelped when Sherlock suddenly pinched his nipple hard, and the pleasure turned into an equally bright spike of sensuous pain. Looking down, he caught Sherlock’s eyes fixed upon him, his gaze unflinching and unabashedly lustful. Sherlock hummed against his chest with a little smile, and nibbled ever so gently at the nipple he still had in his mouth.
“And after you’re all better,” Madam Pomfrey said, “then perhaps you’ll be in a suitable enough state to meet with your Head of House to discuss your punishment.”
John’s face as red as the T-bird but the shame not enough to stop him. Cheek pressed against the cool metal of the car; head down, ass in the air , presenting himself.
Their new flat was in Birmingham; it was considerably smaller than their lovely cottage, and the rent was a touch high, but Tom managed to transfer his position to a bank in town. Hazel found work at a clinic two stops away from home. It would take the children a little while to integrate into the school system, but children were nothing if not resilient. They would adapt soon, and make new friends.
I’m alive, get off of me, you prat!” was what John tried to say, but it came out sounding much more like, “Mmmrph mmmff mmmff, mmf mfff mf me, mmmo mratfff.”
“I could,” Sherlock said, which earned him a look so incredulous and a laugh so loud that John had to be smacked on his arse for impudence. Which, of course, only made him laugh harder.
John nodded along, very seriously. He tried not to notice the cross hung above the door, with Jesus’s wooden face, small and sorrowful.
“Well, that’s not very nice,” John agreed, mouth twisting into a moue. “But it doesn’t mean it’s evil or Dark Magic. I’ve seen him do it. He doesn’t like…read your mind or anything. There are clues! And he figures them out. He sees stuff that we don’t look at. He’s not evil, he’s just really…brilliant.”
Breath catching, Sherlock snatched up the camera and closed in. Strong, vulnerable, battered--if John could see what he looked like asleep, he would understand he had nothing to fear from any camera.
But no one even glances at them once. John licks the cool rim of his glass, and then his own lip, hears the catch in the stranger’s throat. He is getting away with something terrible.
He kissed her on her soft pink mouth - not too long, nice and sweet - and bade her goodnight. He watched her unlock the door, and waited to be sure that she was safely inside. It was the gentlemanly thing to do, after all.
John swallowed, shifting in his seat on the worn red cushion of the pew. His slacks were scratchy and hot against his thighs. He turned his eyes heavenward, and met instead the suffering Christ, forever nailed to his cross. Jesus’ eyes were downward cast, toward the realm of mortals. Forever sad about this whole sorry state of affairs. John felt awful glad he wasn’t seated further towards the front, in that particular line of view.
Jeanette was different from all the other girls that John had known. The first time he met her she was smoking behind the school while the rest of her class was in gym. “Hey, bean,” she said, smiled like she wanted to sell him something, said, “Don’t be shy,” and beckoned him over. “Wanna try?” She’d waved a Lucky Strike at him, smudged pink with her lipstick.
He’s going light-headed from the lack of air, from the slow accumulation of carbon dioxide in his blood. Euphoria slips in, into his brain, slides smooth through his body, his body shivering, quivering hot.
Sherlock leaned back on the sofa, lush with satisfaction. He was still fully dressed, with only his black trousers pushed down past his hips. John was completely naked, tied up prettily and glorious.
“Okay,” John hums agreeably. “Maybe then you’ll have time...to get hard and we can do it all over again.”
Every slow, powerful stroke of his cock drove the breath from John. There was something sublime in being forced to breathe with the rhythm of Sherlock taking him. As Sherlock sped up, the thrusts came faster, harder, their bodies smacking together. John found himself struggling for enough air. He couldn’t move, he couldn’t breathe properly, while Sherlock played with John’s body however he wanted; the sharp awareness of his own helplessness seemed to make his sense of everything else keener. Sherlock’s cock felt bigger and more vibrant inside him than it ever had before, every rub against his prostate flashed brighter, each thrust drove him closer to the precipice of orgasm. John moaned and writhed, he raked his hands over the backs of Sherlock’s shoulders and keened with desire for
here,” John said, “I guess he left.” He tried not to sound quite so disappointed, and so he shrugged after he said it. He had been the one who had fallen asleep, after all. Sherlock probably had better things to do with his time than to sit around and watch over an unconscious person.
then Jesus opened his eyes -  John wanted to scream - eyes like a winter lake, eyes like the incoming frost oh God, oh god, God was seeing him, he was being
John took his time with the third button; his nail scraping against the smooth plastic back of it, his thumb pushing it slow through the buttonhole. His thumb caressed the smooth fabric of Sherlock's shirt before he peeled it delicately open, with almost surgical precision. His hands were slow, and his breaths were shallow.
“And now what are you doing?” Mycroft asked from the doorway. Sherlock scowled at him, at his height and at his shiny Head Boy badge.
He kisses John on the neck, sucks hard to leave a bright red mark that will purple into the shape of his mouth.
By the time Sherlock let their wrists go, the blood had stopped dripping. “And there’s one more part to seal it,” Sherlock said. His hands touched lightly on John’s shoulders. John found himself looking into large, luminous eyes, the colour of sky over ocean, or perhaps the colour of ocean after a storm. John sucked in a quick little breath. Sherlock’s face was very close.
Sherlock didn’t even miss a beat. "And now you should put fresh dittany on it," he insisted. It was clear that there was no approval for what Madam Pomfrey had done; if anything, she should have done it fifteen minutes ago. "It won't hurt as much."
“Fall means that winter’s not far behind,” reasoned Sally. “It all means the same thing, being cooped up and miserable. For the next six months! Not allowed to go anywhere. Not allowed to have any
It was nearly bedtime before the Ban on Bill-words was lifted. Both John and Mike were saddened to see it go, although they had missed Bill-words a little, tiny bit. Bill celebrated the lifting of the ban by making as much noise as possible, although admittedly he had been doing that already, with the way he had been rummaging through his wardrobe, his bedside table, and then his trunk.
But today John had looked at him and had used that tired word, friend, and had declared it in front of everyone, as if Sherlock was the exact same as those who bantered and giggled with him, as if Sherlock were the type to trade Chocolate Frog cards and debate the Cannons’ chances this season. John had spilled blood for Sherlock, both his own and that of Sherlock’s enemy - that had to count for something. It always counted in barbarian, vampiric, and piratic circles.
With both palms flat against the warmth of John’s chest, holding him still against the cold metal, Sherlock had been braced for any number of possible reactions. Nonresistance, primarily, due to the initial shock.
“Well, yeah,” John said, and that had been clear to him from, well, the waist up. “But I’ve never met any boys with tails before.”
“They might,” said Mike. “They’re Slytherins, so they’re all mes--” He cut himself off at John’s sharp look. “Sorry, John.”
When she looked up again, Harriet and the girl were splashing at each other. John was playing by himself in the waves, looking down into the water and watching the waves and sand carve new paths around his feet.
John was running out of options. He was almost all the way to the end of the car and the train would start moving soon regardless of whether or not he found a seat. Biting his lip, he opened the compartment door, and breathed relief when he saw it was empty save for one boy sitting by the window.
“Have a seat. Let me put the kettle on, and then I’ll tell you some things about what you don’t know.”
“It’s against the rules,” John said, “You know that.” He knew that. “You’re a stranger, I don’t know anything about you.”
On Wednesday, Sherlock made four people cry on four different occasions. It was not at all a nice or good thing to do.
John looked at him, this Head Boy who loomed over him, his uniform pressed and perfect. His robes were certainly the very expensive type. A golden ray of sunlight struck his Head Boy badge and reflected off of it, temporarily blinding John for a moment. He was a seventh year and the smartest, brightest boy in all the school, and he had the power to probably take away 100 House points if he wanted to. Probably.
John made a strangled sound of distress and grabbed at the jar, which grated with the sound of heavy glass scraping against wood as John pulled it towards him and clutched it to his defiant little body.
And so the days passed cheerfully. John and Harriet spent a day hunting frogs (technically toads) where the first one to catch a frog meant that the other had to kiss it, to see if it might turn into a person. This then turned into an afternoon spent hunting the dog, as an overexcited Gladstone saw a rabbit and chased it into the woods.
She pushed open the bathroom door and screamed at what she found: John, her little boy, completely submerged in the water.
“Do you drink coffee, Sherlock?” she asks. “I could put on a pot.” She looks at him then, her scrutiny stone-steady. “John’s too young for coffee.”
tie. He’s going to pick out John’s outfit and fling it onto the bed at him, bark at him to get up and dressed and John will know that mostly Sherlock is cranky because he wants breakfast and there will be the smell of burnt toast in the air and if he stays in bed, if he keeps his eyes closed, Sherlock will come storming in, any minute now…
John's body clenches around him in waves of sensation, milking his cock. He's faintly aware of the splatter of warm semen on his skin, smearing between them. It's all too much and it's like nuclear fission inside of him, the splitting of the atom, exothermic reaction and all behind his eyelids is flames and light and his body surrenders and he's coming with a harsh shout, spilling his seed deep inside the tight, perfect clasp of John’s little body.
“Say, I got school in the morning,” he said, instead. “I really really need to be getting to sleep.” It was the truth but why couldn’t the truth at least sound a little cooler? “And...it’s the middle of the night. You should get home before something bad happens to you.”
had boasted of a current record of over 26 years without a single reported untimely student demise - much to Sherlock’s chagrin.
penetrating shallowly into his hole.  The dirtiness of it brings John nearly to his knees, the forbiddenness of it, this evil thing they are doing in public-private space under too-bright lights and John is moaning, spilling, all the sin spilling out.
The World’s Largest Hand Dug Well is located in Greenburg, Kansas. It extends 109 feet into the ground and measures 32 feet in diameter. Built in 1887, they call it a “masterpiece of pioneer engineering.” It was built entirely by farmers, cowboys, and drifters. They would start work at sunrise, banded together in crews of 12 to 15 men, carving into the earth with shovels and picks, hauling dirt with half barrels, systems of pulleys and ropes. At sundown they collected their pay, anywhere from fifty cents to a dollar a day.
If John thought that the Hogwarts Express was big like elephants and gods were big, well, Hogwarts castle itself was big like it had been built to house elephants and gods and elephant-gods.
John glanced down at the photo again, still wide-eyed,  his flush deepening now, warm upon his cheeks.
- all the way in deep where he thought nothing could ever go. The pain still there but it had, transformed, into sensation. Between his legs he was painfully hard, and now his body had become accepting, insides fluttering, clinging to the pull and drag of it, the rub of it against that place inside of him that made him spark white-hot. He was so hot, he was a flame, flickering with pleasure with every jolt, every push, wanting to cry, to sob, but in a good way.
“I could have a concussion,” Sherlock returned. He raised a hand expectantly for John to help him regain his lost footing and dignity. “You're a doctor. Help me.”
The kiss was soft and nearly shy, like the first few that they had shared. That had surprised John, the first time; he had always expected kissing another man to be monumentally different and strange. He’d braced for everything he knew about himself to shatter. He’d expected to be left with broken pieces of his old identity at his feet. It had almost been more of a shock when it had turned out to be a simple kiss. No fanfare had gone off afterwards, no confetti or banner dropping from the ceiling to declare, “
John wakes up, and is unsure that he has woken up at all. He’s back in his room, he’s back home, and it’s all so normal and right. It’s the day of the trial again, right before it all started. In a few minutes, Sherlock is going to come into his room, complaining loudly about having to wear a tie. He’s going to rummage through John’s closet, questioning (insulting) his sartorial choices, and refuse to be seen with him if he matches
They lay together, just the two of them; complete in their togetherness, euphoric in their completion. No room for ghosts between them. For the first time in months, John’s mind was a quiet and comfortable place.
“I wasn’t expecting anyone else,” says the impeccably-dressed stranger. The coat is different, too, close-up. John notices him then. Close-up, he is a man worth noticing. A young Chinese man in his mid-30s; with dark, dark eyes and high cheekbones and warm golden skin. He’s striking in a fitted black suit.
John had never wanted anything like this before Sherlock, not even that time in uni when one of his more exciting girlfriends had suggested it. Any sort of penetration had seemed unmasculine and wrong. Jesus, what had he been missing out on? When Sherlock pushed a second finger into him, John didn’t feel any less of a man. He just felt like a man whose blood rushed with pleasure and the powerful intimacy of having someone else inside him.
The boy rolled his eyes. “Obviously. Do you think I’d still be here if I weren’t stuck?” He held out a small, wet hand. “Help me out.”
“Did you?” Sherlock asked him. “But you must have. But you didn’t. But maybe you did. Did you John?”
They look at each other awkwardly, both of them dressed up and holding bouquets, as if they were two teenagers who have shown up on the same girl’s doorstep, to pick up the same date.
John found himself staring up at the Head Boy, a Slytherin, tall and imposing. His eyes widened for a moment, wondering if he was in trouble, before he considered the fact that he had every right to be here. It was a free hallway, after all.
“You haven’t had tea for a while,” not-Sherlock said. It was true: never finishing the pot of tea, always pouring out the second cup. Tea made John think too much. Too many cases mulled over tea, blog entries tapped out to a hot cuppa; and then there were quiet moments besides: the two of them at home at any given evening, Sherlock’s tea going cold while he worked on an experiment but insisting that John make it for him regardless, every time. And then, in the empty time after: too many cups of tea brewed just for the sake of something resembling normal, and then the fear that one cup, John all by himself, would become normal again. There were the evenings where he sat looking into the steam, into the cup, like it could tell him what his future held, like he could watch the past play out, until it went cold in his hand. He would end up pouring it down the sink. He had felt himself all poured out. It was such a waste.
“No?” Sherlock said. John shook his head again, making small, pleading noises, pitched with desperation. John was feverish with need, sick with it. It made Sherlock feel sick, almost, a swirling feeling in the pit of his stomach and the depths of his chest, with how much he wanted him.
“Now,” Sherlock commanded, feeling his own orgasm cresting. The sound of his order came out low and breathy, sharp and scorched with need. “Come for me, John, do it,
Hazel threw open the door; her mouth opened with a yell. There was nothing there. The rain struck her in the face with hundreds of tiny blows; the wind howled back, trying to push the door out of her grip.
He places his hand over John’s hand, and gives it a gentle squeeze. “I’m happy you could make him happy in all the ways I couldn’t.”
. Although to be fair, Sherlock generally thought all ideas to be good, especially when they were his own. Mycroft often took the opposite stance, because he was contrary like that, and utterly unreasonable to boot. He was a terrible old bore whose whole purpose in existence was to stifle genius, and Sherlock had told him so. When that hadn’t worked, Sherlock had whinged and he’d whined, he’d pouted and thrown a strop, and finally, as a trump card, he’d resorted to telling Mycroft what Victor Trevor had done to his inkwell, with just a hint of tears glittering in his wide, pale eyes.
Sherlock scoffs, but does not light the cigarette in his hand. John puts a record on. He has an excessive amount of Elvis albums: all four of them. Who needs the Christmas album?
Sometimes the enemies came from within one’s own ranks. Victor Trevor had stolen all of Sherlock’s books and hidden them again, and although it had taken Sherlock only fifteen minutes to deduce all the possible hiding places, this time he had baked
- and I think it’s obvious who - has been going around spreading terrible rumours about you. That’s why people are acting so weird.”
John had thus far believed in Sherlock, but Bill and Mike were genuinely concerned for him. It wouldn’t do to make them worry unnecessarily, especially over something so unduly frightening.  So for the next week, John watched Sherlock closely, to look for possible signs of him being a Reincarnation of Pure Evil.
“No. I’m fine. Yeah. I don’t know.” John shakes his head. He coaches his own breath, the way he would for his patients with anxiety disorders. Inhale. Count to ten. Hold it. Hold it. Slow exhale.
It was strange to see the table here now, in this intrepid new world of the upside-down, but no stranger than anything else John had encountered that day. (Was it still the same day? Or had time turned on its axis as well, like a giant hourglass? Had it tipped over and stopped, grains of sand sitting still, the flow gone static?) The table called to him with magnetic attraction, north pole to south pole, and John found himself answering its alluring beckon, aware of the feeling of motion before he was even aware of the movement of his own feet.
In that moment there was no God, only Sherlock’s eyes wide and black as an abyss; his voice cocooning them both.
“I’ll move eventually,” he mumbles, voice rumbling deep in his chest. “Let me stay inside you for now. For the next day or two.”
The Hogwarts Express must travel very fast. The trees and buildings looked so very blurry through the window; it all made John blink rapidly.
Sherlock gasps, thrusts up harder at the feeling of John squirming helplessly upon his cock, fighting but not-fighting, rubs his dick inside of John in a way so
“Um, thanks?” said John. He wrinkled his nose with consternation, and clutched the bundle of hospital blankets tighter to his chest.
Sherlock looks at John's face as he thinks on Irene, the openness of his emotion, the crinkle of his distressed brow, the flushing of his cheeks, the unhappy moue of his kissable, soft mouth. The smallness of him huddled in the passenger seat, but the smallness is not fragile, it is a volatile thing; vulnerable and explosive at once. The unknown chemical properties of John Watson. How wrong it is of Sherlock to want him, wholly, the wholesomeness of John. To take something so pure and contaminate it. He would be like water to pure sodium compound; exothermic reaction. He will consume him until there is nothing left. John does not know his own dangerous allure.
“John, please,” Sherlock said, “Don’t waste your breath. If you wish for this crowd to understand you, you must speak excruciatingly slowly and use very, very small words. You’re also using logic, which seems beyond them. ”
float out, background music for the stable-the-horses, backseat bingo crowd. Later on, the DJ will play,
“Don’t even tell me,” John groans, easily deducing what Victor’s looking at. He flings his numb arm across his eyes to block out the light, although by some miracle he doesn’t have a hangover.
Still, he did not stop the gentle flutter of fingers over his mouth, nor the tracing of his lips with the pink rubber end of his pencil.
“Hurray!” cheered John, and he hugged the slug to him briefly, getting slime on his robes. Then he looked dubiously at the other slugs in the jar. “You don’t suppose they’re related, do you? Like...those aren’t his mummy and daddy or brothers or sisters or friends in there?”
Dark blue eyes look at Sherlock, at his leather jacket, his styled hair, his lack of books. Nicotine stains on his fingers and the faint smell of gasoline around them from his motorcycle outside. Sherlock had been wrong; John does not have her eyes, not these ones, tired and muted as stones deep in murky water. Sherlock imitates a polite smile, and says, “Pleasure to meet you,” as he is nobody’s fool, and even brushes a light kiss over the back of her hand.
“Whatever you like. Pretend the camera isn’t there. Relax. There’s no one here but me. And If you don’t like it, we can have a do-over.”
John didn’t even bother to ask Sherlock how he knew his future career plans when he had little to no idea himself. That wasn’t all that important. The more pressing question was whether it was worth asking Sherlock to be his partner again. The likelihood of Sherlock saying no again was as high as the highest point of a Bouncing Bulb’s trajectory (which was, to John’s experience, quite high). He didn’t want to the bumbling partner who sabotaged Sherlock’s perfect grade.
Sherlock’s face was so close; eyes filled with heat. John’s voice shriveled up in his throat. Ice and broken glass eyes. The expression on his face was pure hunger, needy and honed. As though Sherlock might like to devour him whole. John’s breath caught, his pulse quickened, as with terror, while a golden honeylike pleasure pooled in his belly. He was so hard he could feel it pressing against the zip of his trousers.
Victor looks at him with so much sorriness in his eyes that John wants to punch something. “You’ve never been with another man before. What makes you think you want something more from me?” He takes a step back, a deep breath. He folds his arms against his chest. His voice is softer, quiet and careful when he speaks again. “I’m...not him. I can’t be him for you.”
“You liked this last time,” he murmured, enjoying John’s little shiver as Sherlock rolled and flicked at the nipple in between his fingers. “Shall we find out just how much? What I can make you do with the right stimulation?”
The pressure on his throat releases and John gasps, lungs filling with a rush and the sudden flash of oxygen to his brain like electric shock, surge of pleasure straight to his dick just as Sherlock slams up hard, making John choke on the thrust, and his orgasm crashes over him. Body shaking, squeezing and clenching around Sherlock’s cock inside of him, nearly sobbing with the pulse of his own prick and the sheer rapture of breathing, lungs filling and depleting, inhale and exhale, inhale, exhale. He collapses, spent and panting, soft overwhelmed sounds in between with warm drops of semen on his own skin and some on the carpet.
“You’ve tried asking of course. You’re curious. Think of all the times you’ve wanted to know about something that everyone else takes for granted. Why does curfew exist? Why do the rules exist? And what
,” Harry hissed, and grabbed John’s wrist to drag him along. “Come here - oh my god, is that blood?” Her face paled as she lifted his arm up, noting the streaks of red down to his elbow. “Bloody hell,” she swore, and John gasped at her bad language. “There’s so much! Did you cut yourself? How did you do that?”
Marvel of marvels, nature that made John Watson. How random the recombination of genes, the exchanging of alleles, the coding of DNA. One egg, one sperm, mother that sips alcohol even as she runs the Hoover downstairs, white-collar father whose hands get too heavy with the drink, the two of them who had exchanged curses and insults just as easily and perhaps with even greater passion than they had swapped bodily fluids. Both of them very ordinary, normal, boring, and yet: John.
He suddenly noticed a pile of scrolls on the desk, and nodded towards them. “Oh! Are those my transfer papers?”
John nodded, very solemnly. “I know it’s silly, and it doesn’t make sense. I knew that monsters weren’t real, but when the lights go out, it’s hard to remember that.”
Victor pokes around the flat while John sips at his awful tea and watches him, rediscovering Sherlock through another’s eyes. Victor laughs at the bullets in the wall, (“You need to be more careful with your firearms, John. Although I was always the better shot of the two of us.”), examines the letters (“Oh! He still does the knife thing.”), tsk’s at the mutilated game of Cluedo (“Never play with him. A sore loser and a cheater if he thought he could get away with it. I never let him get away with it.”), and picks up the skull (“Why, hello, Billy.”).
Sherlock thought little of Jeanette and spoke even less of her. He had always been quite vocal on the topic of John’s girlfriends. He seemed to take a strange delight in pointing out what he considered their fatal flaws.
“I’ve never been kissed before,” John admits, breath tumbling out, words pouring out of him like he’s in confession.  Realizes how uncool that is to say the moment he’s said it; Sherlock with his eyes that could figure you out and a mouth that could undo a person like tugging out just the right string of a knot.
Sherlock’s hand went to the side of his robes. John realised, with a horrible tightness in his throat, that Sherlock was going for his wand.
"Oh god," John said, the words strangled in his throat as Sherlock rubbed the flat of his tongue over his tight, closed hole. He shivered and attempted to spread himself open further, hips tilted up, knees bent and feet flat on the bed.
John shuddered hard, squeezing his eyes shut as if he could block it out. He was stunned by the hot sensuality of it, the electric flutter in his stomach and the blossoming heat. It was not something he had ever dreamt about, or would have ever allowed himself to think about. It was not a thing he had known to want. He was so embarrassed he could have just died on the spot -his face must have been bright crimson.
John dropped to his knees in the seat of the chair. “Why would you do that?” His anger had suddenly fizzled up. He was completely disarmed, and thusly he was disarming. That voice. It was the breathy, wondering voice and the wide-eyed look he turned on Sherlock when he’d made a particularly brilliant deduction, when he solved the case simply by observing the way the suspect tied his shoes.
and John winced three times. “You’re only in your first year, so it’s all House point deductions and detentions, really. And you don’t think people fight in this school
And so he opened his trousers slowly, pushed them down over his slim hips, for the simple benefit of watching John watching him, John’s gaze fixated upon him. He had always basked in just this, the personal glory of John Watson’s attention; he flourished under it, and came to be more of himself. His pants were given the same treatment, his movements easy and sensuous. He took himself in his own hand, stroking his cock to the sight of John bound in his bed, shifting and completely at Sherlock’s mercy.
And then John took another breath and drew upon some of that renowned Gryffindor courage. “Sherlock, do you want to be my Potions partner?”
to support. One time he had a fit so bad that he pitched a vase and although it didn’t break it ended up putting a dent in the drywall. Momma covered it up with a painting of daisies. Some nights when John and Harry lay in bed, they could hear her crying, muffled, through the cracks in the walls.
Sherlock was very curious, for a stranger. “As one does at a library,” John replied, sticking a smile on his face.
“We should keep you tied up,” Sherlock suggested, perhaps a bit too brightly. But, surely, it was a bright sort of idea.
Sherlock drifted around the table until he was standing behind John, while John studied himself with new eyes. “Do I need to explain to you,” he whispered, fingers gliding lightly over the back of John’s bare neck, “all the things I can imagine you doing with that mobile little tongue?  How that look of absent concentration on your face reminds me of the way you look at me when you’ve forgotten anything else in the world exists?  How unguarded your neck and collarbones look in that robe when you keep them covered all the time, so that I could simply walk up behind you to touch,” he trailed his fingertips slowly down the slope of John’s trapezius, “and nibble,” he lipped quickly at the shell of John’s ear, “and then slide it down…”
Hazel shook; she could not stop shaking. She put her face in her hands. There was an ocean in her tears, the ocean on her tongue, heavy and bitter with salt.
Irene says, openly giving John the onceover; his hair damp from his after-practice shower, the way his shirt clings to him, and for the very first time, Sherlock almost wants to shove her off of him. Her gaze flicks back to Sherlock, and she giggles, a sound both delicate and flirtatious, lips curling up in amusement.
“Well,” John says encouragingly, “It’s not too late. You’re still plenty young enough for a career change. How’s your flogging arm?”
,” Sherlock sighed. He rolled over, finally, because it was starting to get hot with his face buried in the pillow for so long.
What was he doing with this boy, this boy who calls his mother mama sometimes, all soft and entreating to get what he wants.
Sherlock didn’t think that anybody had ever believed in him so completely before. Usually people did not believe in him at all, and, if they had half a brain - like Mummy or Mycroft - they believed in him with some reservation, and rightfully so.
Then he ducked his head and smiled a bit sheepishly. “Bad news for me, it turns out you have to be a little more specific than just saying
He lifted up, slid his hand underneath John’s head, cradled it - his precious head, the fragility of his skull, his wonderful brain inside, still intact, still functioning and whole, still thinking his John-thoughts and managing all the minute, infinite processes required to be John Watson. It was a romantic misconception, really, to say that people loved with the heart. The heart was merely an organ -albeit an entirely necessary one - its sole purpose for the circulation of blood throughout the body. It was the brain that housed one’s thoughts, one’s personality in the frontal cortex, and one’s emotions in the limbic system, the capability for love buried in the hippocampus and amygdala; in the anterior thalamic nuclei and the septum; the habenula, the limbic cortex, and the fornix.
John's eyes are dark like the hue of the skies outside, and if Sherlock were more foolish, or if he wanted to sweetly lie, he might say that they, too, hold the stars of night. But stars are useless gaseous balls millions of miles away that hold no significance at all and so Sherlock says nothing. Later, in the backseat, he kisses John's eyes closed.
Something terrifying had awakened in John, something dangerous and untameable. But he could not go back to that static, unlit life.
He didn’t know where they drove, or for how long, only it was far, far, farther than he had ever known, farther than he could ever go.
Upon Governor’s White return three years later, it was no longer a colony, but rather a ghost town. The village was completely deserted, stripped of its people. The buildings had collapsed, and “the houses taken downe.” He found the letters CRO carved on a tree near the water’s edge. The settlement had been enclosed by a palisade of tall, sharp wooden stakes to make a fort, as if to keep out possible intruders, or to protect from enemy attack. But at the right side of the entrance, the word CROATOAN had been carved on a post “without any cross or signe of distress” near it. White and his men continued to search but never found a trace of the colony.
It was a very bad idea. He was scared of what he might do if Sherlock were to enter his bedroom, scared of what he might want.
“That doesn’t even make sense,” Sherlock said, although he was appalled at his own slightly petulant tone.
“Sherlock was being bullied, Professor,” John said. “I had to step in! That’s how the fight started.”
“Why are you defending him so much anyway?” asked Bill peevishly. “You don’t even know him. We’re your friends, he didn’t even want you for a Potions partner.”
“Right, then,” said Madam Pomfrey. She got up briskly, dusting the front of her robes with her hands. “Now, I do have some other students to see. There’s that nasty case of Vesuvian Vomitus that’s been going around this season.”
“Mr. Watson,” Professor Hudson said, which caused John to snap to attention where he sat. “I really did not expect this sort of behaviour from you. From Mr. Powers, perhaps, but not you. You have such a promising career at Hogwarts. Certainly you wouldn’t want to jeopardise that?”
Victor laughs, and John watches him laugh, and he feels something warm stir in his chest and John thinks, maybe this could be all right.
He pushed it in slowly, sliding along John’s tongue, drinking in the sight of John’s mouth wrapped around his cock. He rubbed it back and forth on the flat of John’s tongue, hissing at the soft wet slide on the underside of his cock, the way John’s tongue fluttered, just slightly, as he rubbed against it.
Of course Sherlock saw it too. Eyes narrowed with calculation, he reached up to stroke a thumb over one of John’s nipples, already pink and peaked with arousal. John arched into the touch, and then gasped as Sherlock leaned down to take the other nipple into his mouth, flicking over and over it with his tongue. “Oh,” John breathed, the touch so hot and wet, his nipple stiff in Sherlock’s mouth, “Oh, more of that.”
“Everybody breaks curfew sometimes. At least those of us who know how to have fun do. We can’t all be goody two-shoes like Watson over here.”
“I’m sure you have already heard what they say about him. And now, by extension, what they say about you. You’re the type to make friends easily, and yet you have chosen to align yourself with someone so suspect, whose presence in your life has already drastically affected your potential popularity and happiness during your time here at school. You could easily find another friend, Mr. Watson, one who is less complicated and difficult. I imagine people have already warned you to stay away from him.”
Sherlock stops in the middle of the field, a dark outline against the sky, black leather jacket and hair aglow with the orange light of the dying sun behind him.
She grabbed a clotted-cream and strawberry-filled chocoball off John’s plate, popping it into her mouth. “Harry!” John protested. Those were his favourites, and he’d been saying them for last.
John froze, waiting for her words like a bullet to the head. Would he have to beg her to spare his life? She could destroy two lives with an ugly word.
John, feeling a tight squeeze in his chest, forgot how to breathe. He could feel the grey mesh of the screen underneath his fingers, and could not recall when he had reached out to touch it. He was captivated by Sherlock - made captive by his words, his voice, his gaze. He supposed had always been captivated by him, ever since the very start.
Sherlock does, and he listens to the giggles flourish into gasps, with John’s little body clenching in waves around him.
“It’s not funny,” John said, putting himself between Carl and Sherlock. “Stop it. And give Sherlock his books and homework back!”
“There’s nothing wrong with Sherlock,” his mother had insisted, which Sherlock all of thirteen had known meant there was something very wrong indeed.
And so John did. He let Sherlock examine his fingers, and he told him how the fingertips turned all wrinkly and old when he sat in the bath too long. He giggled when Sherlock touched his legs, and let him peel a plaster off one knee to sniff at the scrape beneath it. He had to stop Sherlock from licking it, however, because he wasn’t sure if licking was good for healing cuts and scrapes. Instead he let Sherlock lick the bruise on his shin, since that was just skin, and the tickling, wet sensation of Sherlock’s quick tongue made him laugh.
“Aww, don’t be jealous, baby,” Jeanette said, and chucked him on the chin. “You know all my lovin’s for you.”
“Chocolate mice!” Mike said brightly, and pushed two plates towards his mournful Housemates. “Chocolate mice for everyone!”
“You’ll just have to work harder at it I guess,” John said. “Maybe you could steal a car or something,” he offered helpfully. “Just don’t smoke, though, Momma would have a fit.”
) open, and Sherlock sank into him, the softness of that place, the moist pink earthenworks of his body.
“You’re not a hero!” John told him, his hands balled into fists at his side. “You’re…you’re a bully, is what you are!”
It was not that Hogwarts wasn’t grand - for it was - and even he, at eleven years old, could sense the powerful magic tied into it, rooted into its foundation, drenching its walls. It was that he had forgotten about
John, with all his needy whimpers as Sherlock’s fingers find both his nipples and start by gently stroking, then plucking. How the tissue becomes erect between his fingers, stiffening and filling with blood. The nerves that can be stimulated by touch or strong emotion, pilomotor reflex - simple science, really, but what is the science of the scrunch of John’s nose when he moans? What is the science of the silky skin between Sherlock’s fingers, the feel of the hardened little nubs as he rubs them, and rolls them, and every now and then twists them? The way they look, pink and swollen and obscene. The way John looks when Sherlock latches his mouth over one and teases with his tongue before sucking hard, while his other hand strokes and plays with him. Sherlock wishes he could see. It must look obscene.
Not to amount to anything is easy - but to be nothing, now that was an ambition. To be negative space. To be the nothingness in space, consuming all.
John hopped up on the wooden workbench against the wall of the garage. From there he watched Sherlock work, watched the visible flex of lean muscles underneath his thin white shirt. Sherlock was always good with his hands, at taking things apart and putting them back together. John liked the way that Sherlock looked when he was working, deep in concentration and lost in the machinations of the engine - but also he liked the way Sherlock looked when he was bent over, blue jeans pulling tight over the curve of his ass.
“Well, guess…guess I’ll see you around, then,” John mumbled, hiding his face. In that instant, Sherlock wanted to take it all back. Yes, please, be my partner, come sit right here next to me, I’ve saved this seat for you.
After breakfast, John watches Victor clean up the dishes, something Sherlock never used to do. He watches the lines of Victor’s back through his soft grey t-shirt, thinks about the way Victor clutched at him like a man drowning.
Right. There was a cab, and they had to get back home, and this was why Sherlock had despised alcohol, he realised, because it completely disrupted his proper thought processes.
His voice cracks a bit on the word all. He clears his throat, once, twice, coughs. Presses a fist to his forehead.
John was jostled about so easily. His eyes and lashes glistened with the tears of frustrated desire. His throat and chest shone with sweat in the light, his cock flushed red and leaking drops of precum onto Sherlock’s white shirt.  Sherlock loved to fuck him with all the lights on, so that he could drink in the details of him, observe every reaction, catalogue every twitch and shudder. Sherlock grabbed at him with his hands, squeezing, snatching at him possessively. He thrust hard into him with his cock, burying himself into tightness and heat.
his Housemates didn’t like him now, but he wished that they would, even if it was just a little bit.
“Not even I could have guessed you would turn out to be such a little cockslut,” Sherlock said. He was wickedly amused and shamelessly aroused.  “Imagine what your girlfriends would say if they could see you like this. Letting yourself be used for my pleasure. Your tight little hole hungry for my cock. You’re positively greedy for my cock inside of you, all tied up and gagged and still begging me to fuck you until you come.”
Sherlock, who was usually less than impressed by everything, appeared even less than less-than-impressed with the two Gryffindors who were currently displaying their bravery by hiding behind the smallest boy of their year. He arched an imperious brow.
As John walked toward it, the table seemed to increase in size - not in the logical way, of course, that all things increased in size as you approached, but in the illogical way, as in the table seemed to be stretching and growing. Half of the table was set out for tea: dainty porcelain dishes, gleaming forks and spoons, dishes of clotted cream and butter and jam that glistened like wet rubies. Clutter sprawled over the other half: scientific glassware and heavy textbooks, slides and petri dishes, mould samples in green and orange and blue, rotting specimens and putrid human remains. It was highly unsanitary and highly inedible. It was enough to make any normally-functioning person sick. It was enough to make John homesick.
“My mom was talking to Mrs. Morris who was talking to Mrs. Anderson. He’s in big trouble, grounded for sure,” Molly told Sally, with great authority.
John liked the nights where he worked the last shift and it was up to him to close. Sherlock would visit him then and they could watch the pictures for free, although John reckoned they did more necking than watching, theater dark and empty save for them. The movie drowned out their soft kissing noises and occasional bursts of laughter, John’s gasps of quiet surprise, Sherlock’s voice low and wicked in his ear. They were supposed to have seen
Harriet was playing with that little neighbour girl… Lara or Laura or Cara or something. Hazel had left her with specific instructions to look after John, and at the moment it seemed that the three of them were involved in a splash fight.
John shook his head. “Not ones that people usually see. And certainly not ones that teach classes. Boring ones or otherwise. Most people don’t even believe in them.”
“John,” Victor says, hand on his elbow. “John.” There are hands on his arms. “Do you need some air?”
wearing one because Bill didn’t want to look stupid wearing one alone,” Mike explained. “As you can see, he still looks stupid, but now we look stupid together.”
The sunny afternoon had become overcast evening, the sky now blue-gray and swathed with clouds. Further down, the edge of the sky was ablaze with orange light, the bottoms of the clouds streaked with red. The sun was already touching the horizon. Soon it would dip below; it would only be a matter of minutes.
A few days later, the sand would be back. John was scolded time and time again, and he would protest, “But Mummy, I do!” every time she told him to clean off before bed. She told him she didn’t fancy him turning their house into the bottom of an hourglass. When he came in from outside, he was marched straight upstairs for a bath. New house rules were put into place: all shoes to be taken off outside, and left in the foyer.
Later that night, sleep comes to him much easier, the way it does to those who know that tomorrow will be okay.
He pressed his face against the soft white cotton of Sherlock’s shirt and breathed him in greedily, savoring the moment.
about him,” Bill continued. Bill, as John noted before, was very blasé about ghosts, while John still rubbed his arms up and down to try and get the goosebumps to go down.
Tidepools, John knew, were full of interesting things, like shells and clams and see-an-enemies and little crabs. He nodded with understanding. It made sense that Sherlock would want to look at them, because John wanted to look at these things too.
Sherlock spits in his own wet hand now, his and John's saliva intermingled, impossible to separate. He wraps his hand around himself and begins to stroke, looking down at John, laid out on his own bed, on sheets soft from multiple washings. John's eyes on him, on the movement of his hand, on the pull of his dick. The flicker of tongue as John licks his lips, breathing heavy, watching. The glistening wetness of John’s mouth after he's licked his lips.
He tightened his hand when John whined, attempting to thrust up into it. Sherlock’s other hand pushed down on John’s hip, keeping him still.
Sherlock had never understood what the big fuss was all about. Hair, after all, always grew back. As did fingernails. And if any teeth had ever been lost, well, they’d only been
John clutches at Sherlock’s waist, his whole body pressed to Sherlock’s back with the wind whistling past, the thrum of the motorcycle rumbling beneath them.
He orders a Coke, without the straw. He might not be able to order beer but he’s gonna drink his Coke like a man, goshdarnit.
Tulsa: “Oil Capital of the World.” The city sprawls out with beautiful buildings in Art Deco style, erected as tribute to the power of man, uplifted by the gods of industry. The ornate facades and bold geometry reach towards the sky - joyful, joyful, ever joyful for the progress of mankind.
And there, beneath John’s fingers, there it was: the answering pulse, the push of an artery against his fingertips, the answering beat of Sherlock’s functioning heart, the blood coursing through his body.
Sherlock didn’t know what it was like to spend Sunday mornings with his sister scouring the paper for coupons to make sure they had enough for groceries that had to last through the week, or what it was like  to eat meatloaf for weeks because hamburger was 50% off at Wegman’s because it was about to go off  and they’d bought it in bulk to freeze.
“No,” Sherlock agreed. “Never again.” He kept John locked into the circle of his arms, desperately tight. John dreaded the moment when he’d have to let go again.
Was fear the word for this feeling? The prickle along John’s neck, the rabbit-jump of excitement in his stomach and chest and throat; yes, he was afraid, not just for himself but for both of them.
Victor’s Sherlock was like that: wild, reckless, self-destructive. “Stole Sebby Wilkes’ motorbike once for an all-night joyride. I think we may have dumping it in the river, but don’t worry: Wilkes was a grade-A twat if you ever saw one.”
” that escaped John’s mouth. Liking the sound of that, he did it again, this time angling better, rubbing hard against where he know John’s prostate to be, and the “
Mouth pressed into a thin line, John set his tea carefully down on the floor next to his chair. In the next moment, the tea went flying as John did too, launching himself at Sherlock.
But John was safe, which was the important thing. He did not seem negatively affected by his bouts of sleepwalking at night, did not seem to even remember them come morning. He was as fairly well-rested as one could expect a small boy to be. She was the one who could not sleep, twisting about in the sheets, readjusting her pillow over and over, laying right laterally, and then laying left. There was a sickness that swam about in her stomach, and it sloshed from side to side. The feeling wriggled and twisted, as if her gastrointestinal system had become home to a vat of quivering eels.
The sound of his pulse in his own ears drowned out anything else, and then Sherlock drowned out everything else, as he took John into his arms.
The bathroom is small but uncommonly clean; two dark wooden stalls and a row of three gleaming urinals, brown and off-white tile on the walls just this side of ugly. It’s much too bright inside the stall, and there are men’s voices just outside as the evening gets later and the bar gets busier, and the man’s mouth is upon his, open, kissing, insistent, urgent hot press of lips to his, John lets it happen, happens to kiss back with everything inside of him, all the sin bubbling to the surface.
In Missouri there had been Graham Cave, a wide sandstone arch 100 meters into the hillside; the haunted Lemp Mansion (deemed not all that haunted by Sherlock); and the Patee House, one of the stops of the Pony Express. In the gift shop, John had picked up a figurine of a small man in a cowboy outfit riding a small horse.
“See?” said Mike, and Bill seemed appeased, for the time being. “We came as soon as we heard you were in the Hospital Wing because of Sherlock Holmes,” Mike explained.
“It’s for Sherlock,” Victor says, grabbing the third drink. They sit with an empty barstool between them.
. It screams loud to Sherlock: painful, put-upon domesticity by a woman desperate to keep up appearances.
“Anyway, if we could smoke it, snort it, pop it, inject it - we tried it. And it was great fun, and as a result I don’t remember a large portion of my uni career, but I do remember that it was great fun.” He sighs and makes a reach for his beer on the nightstand. It’s just beyond arm length - he barely brushes it with his fingertips. He gives up. “It was all fun and games, in fact, until one day, Sherlock discovered heroin.”
“If you have so many opinions,” John snapped without looking up, “you should use them on your own blog.”
“America, somewhere, I think,” John said, with a vague little wave. And then he seemed to realise something. “Oh! Batman’s not real! Did I forget that? He’s not real like
“They’re in the ocean,” the boy said, which made sense. If they were swimming like Harry, and the boy had gone exploring like John, it could take a while before they noticed that their little boy was missing. It also meant that it would take more time for John to find them than to try and help the boy out himself.
“Oh, come on, I know I’m no Sherlock, but give me a little credit here,” Victor says. “Who was the text from? Bad news from your sister or…?”
Sherlock’s lips were cool against his, cold from the night air, surprisingly soft. John was being kissed, at last, for the first time, and the ache deep down in the marrow of his bones became a surge: at once both rushing satisfaction and desire for more, so much more.
“Yes, Ma’am,” said Bill and Mike in unison, beatifically. They beat a hasty retreat, and John hedged a little bit closer to Sherlock in their absence.
Something moved, just out of the corner of his eye. He whipped his head around, but there was nothing there. What was that unknown shape hunched over, just up the street? His heart squeezed, he held his breath. Why, it was only a mailbox. Trick of the dark. His mind was getting fanciful. Just like Momma said, all those tales of terror had filled up his head with ghosts and ghouls, and now they’d all come crawling out.
“Relax,” Sherlock pants. His breath is warm and moist against the side of John’s face. “Just relax. It’s going to be all right.” His  grip on John’s throat is iron-strong, fingers clenching, immovable. His other hand is splayed on John’s stomach, holding him tightly in place as he fucks him.
John opened his mouth to speak, and in doing so apparently deleted his entire vocabulary in an instant. His tongue dried up inside his mouth and his vocal chords failed him. His brain stuttered, he couldn’t even get his mouth to stutter because it hadn’t even gotten to that stage, and his heart was puttering away in his chest.
She trails her crimson nails up Sherlock's thigh. "C'mon Sherly, you're in orbit. Just tell her three little words, the easiest lie. You've done it before, haven't you? That's what all the little girlies say."
me now,” John mumbled, head in his hands. Mike tsk’d and piled John’s plate up high with food, which was his answer - and reasonably so - for most of what ailed people in life.
"I don't want her...or any girl...or nobody to mean anything to you," John says, panting, small fists tight in Sherlock's shirt.
One day, John is going to beg for it; he will whine that Sherlock is going too slow. He has a voice for begging, a voice for tempting one into sin.
“Well, what do we do now, Socks?” he asked the little brown owl in her cage. Socrates blinked at him but had no reply, a true insult to the fabled wisdom of her species.
And so this is event horizon. There is no return. And the sun could spin in backwards rotation, for all Sherlock suddenly does not know.
“Let me tell you,” said Sherlock. “You’ll graduate school, you’ll go to college - maybe you’ll become a doctor, because you want to help people. You might want to leave, you might dream of travel, but one day you’ll meet a girl, perhaps she’ll be a nurse, and you’ll get married. You’ll have a child or two, and settle down once again, just working your life away, in one of these places where nothing ever happens to you.”
He lines himself up and pushes forward, the little hole unyielding at first. John lets out a whimper of genuine distress for the first time and Sherlock feels heat coil up tight inside of him. He drapes himself over John now, slips an arm underneath his small body to hold him. His dick presses forward, insistent, unyielding. John wraps his arms around Sherlock's shoulders, blunt fingernails of one hand scratching at the back of Sherlock's neck. The little hole is tight, it tries to keep him out, and John squirms beneath him, trembling but not fighting. He’s trapped and this is as inevitable as the setting sun. For then there's a sudden give and Sherlock’s pushing inside, slow and steady, inch by inch, heat all around him and John whimpering in his ear.
“Pity,” John said. He closed his eyes and shuddered, tilting forward, his forehead resting against Sherlock’s shoulder. “I like you without.”
John opened his eyes and he was standing in a forest. Trees all around him, so tall that they blocked out light. A voice whispered to him with great urgency,
Respectable, decent white-collar job. Any parent would be proud. John, with his caring, careful hands that cover Sherlock’s and linger there.
“That’s terrible,” John said, and truly he was horrified. This seemed like a sort of magic in itself, but it was all things that could be solved through logic - a magical
Sherlock gave John a funny look, the same way that he’d looked when he wasn’t sure if John could count to three or not. “I’m a boy,” Sherlock said slowly.
John had no leverage like this. He felt like he’d just been swaddled, or maybe scooped up in a net. He grabbed for the back of the sofa, intending to pull himself out of his awkward position, but Sherlock casually batted his hand away. Though he pulled at his trousers a bit more, the big git made no attempt to remove them. John kicked his legs in protest, but he might as well have been hobbled; his rucked-up jeans all but bound him at the knees.
“Hm,” Sherlock looked doubtful. Normally it would be easy to refuse something so ridiculous, but John seemed so excited and Sherlock had a very clear image of what a disappointed John look like, and how it somehow made
people that lived in it, and breathed in it, and touched it and thought their sluggish, stupid thoughts in it. It was all indescribably horrid, and he realised that that he had to spend the next seven years of his life locked up with morons.
He stroked John until John was whimpering and trying to wriggle away. John shook his head, eyes wide and pleading; it was far too much. Sherlock held onto him tight, one hand on his hip, his own dick snug still in the warm clasp of John’s body. John’s dick was flushed red and raw-looking, twitching in Sherlock’s hand. It was surely oversensitive. He stroked John until John was actually nearly crying, and then until Sherlock could see tears drip down his cheeks, until John was begging for mercy through his gag, and Sherlock kept touching him, kept stroking until John shuddered again and his dick spurted with one final pathetic dribble that was more precum than anything else.
But tadpoles, Mummy said, only fared well in ponds and lakes, and were not very strong swimmers in the ocean. All it would take was a strong tide to sweep him out to sea, and he’d be lost forever.
“I’m Sherlock Holmes,” the boy declared, as if this were a very impressive thing. John and Socks both blinked at him, nonplussed.
“I wish you had told me company was coming, John,” she murmurs, withdrawing her hand. “I could have baked a pie.”
“Particularly not the type so vicious where both parties end up in the Infirmary,” Professor Hudson finished, levelling onto John a look so disappointed that he sunk down even further into his already sinky cushioned seat.
The lights flickered in the library, indicating that it was due to close soon. John looked up from where he sat, cross-legged on the carpet between the aisles of books, deep into the stacks. There was no sign of the librarian. He had a few more minutes, he reasoned, he could at least finish the story.
“Sherlock!” came a familiar little voice, breathless, and Sherlock’s head snapped up to see John Watson, with his hair mussed and his robes streaked with grey stripes of dust. His shoes were untied.
John turns his face, presses a kiss to the inside of Sherlock’s palm. Sherlock sucks in a breath between his teeth.
When a bullet enters a brain, the entry wound is neat - a small round circle of penetration, a miniature black hole, a window into the mind. The blood trickles out in small rivulets, rich and dark, as if one’s thoughts were leaking out. It is the exit wound that flowers into a starburst of gore, the shattered bits of bone and dripping grey matter painting the wall.
“Oh come on, John,” Carl said, “We all know about our little Sherlock here. He’s Dark spawn, and someone has to be the hero.”
Sherlock has no interest in architecture. He doesn’t much care for the fact that Tulsa is considered the birthplace of Route 66, brought into existence by businessman Cyrus Avery, the Father of Route 66. He has no interest in buying ice cream to pose for a picture underneath the giant neon sign that reads:
Sherlock felt so real: the solidness of his chest, the strength of his arms. John thought there was no place in the world that he’d rather be. Sherlock’s arms tightened around him, natural and possessive. John was imbued with a sense of belonging: this was where he belonged, this was who he belonged to.
“Are we done here?” John asked, his own gaze unwavering, although he was starting to get a cramp in his neck from looking up so much. “I have to get to dinner eventually, and you’re standing in my way.”
“No, Sherlock,” Mycroft sighed. “Slug in the Common Room, no experiments in the dormitories. That’s final.”
Sherlock is outside. John can see him through the large front window: a dark figure vivisected by the white slats of  vertical vinyl blinds. It’s still dark out and he is half-lit by the yellow glow of the recessed lights outside their room. He seems to be enjoying the beautiful view of the parking lot.  A light wraith of smoke curls out from his cigarette.
[small announcement, to be deleted later:] Guys, there's gonna be a week hiatus coming up so that everyone who ordered a book can get their PDFs (which are still being put together - but we're aiming for Monday) and have the advantage of reading the finished story first. There's about 2.5 parts left in the story and it might ruin your enjoyment if I break them up, so tune back in next week for the THRILLING CONCLUSION of this sordid little tale.
And then he was stumbling backwards, pushed against the wall by the kitchen door. The bite of the camera against his back vanished; he heard the thump of it being set on one of the shelves. Their mouths parted briefly, long enough for John to look up into Sherlock’s face and see the dark take over Sherlock’s eyes, his full lips curled back from his teeth like...something feral and gorgeous. Oh. Sherlock’s hands seemed to engulf his wrists, locking almost painfully tight upon them, forcing John’s hands back against the wall. John’s stomach clenched with the thrill of capture. Another ferocious kiss, and John lost the floor, hoisted up off his feet between Sherlock and the wall. Without thinking, he wrapped his legs around Sherlock’s waist and locked them together, all too eager for the feel of Sherlock against him.
Anatoly Kamanev was the leader of a drug trafficking ring, current operational headquarters: Paris, France - City of Light. A man with many connections, a solitary spider in a web of his own, spinning his silk, growing fat from his captures; in all respects, a powerful, dangerous man.
Now, John Watson - there’s a boy you can hang your hopes and dreams on. Hitch a star to this boy and he’ll take you places. He wants to be a doctor, he tells Sherlock, as he bandages up the laceration across Sherlock’s knuckles, mindful of the bruising.
John’s body beneath him, his scars and his marks. The slim muscles of his arms, the soft flatness of his stomach, that sharp intake of breath when Sherlock nuzzles against his navel. Right here the umbilicus formed, a scar of separation from his mother, the severing that began at birth and has continued throughout John’s life.
“Professional dominatrix,” Victor says, and shakes his head. “And here I am, a barrister. My parents never told me there were more career paths out there than doctor or lawyer. Clearly, I’ve wasted my life. ”
Local farmer Frank Stoeber began slowly knotting his way into fame in 1953. In just four years, the ball of twine  weighed 5,000 pounds, stood 8 feet high, and had 1,175,180 feet of twine on it.
He feels his body being jolted, tossed about and invaded, wet sounds of their bodies moving together; he feels the intoxication of hypoxia, the sheer ecstasy of complete surrender; how safe he is in that moment, how treasured, completely used and taken over, blackness on the edges of his vision and then seeping in, teetering on the razor edge of unconsciousness, the low drum of blood in his ears and the quietness of his lack of breath and lungs burning and Sherlock’s cock inside of him, hard and fucking him and he can’t breathe, he’s suffocating slowly and everything is all right, shh, it’s all right can’t breathe but it’s all right—
“And you?” John asked. “Mr. This-is-all-transport is a gay sex expert?” He grinned down at Sherlock, making no attempt to hide his disbelief.
She considered locking the door to John’s room - but then, what if he woke up, and was afraid? What if he needed to come to his parents’ room? She considered taking him back to sleep with her and Tom, but John was getting a bit big for that. Tom would say that she was babying him again. She settled with closing the door tightly, and then she went downstairs to double-bolt the front door, checking and re-checking the locks that John could not reach. There. That would ensure, at least, that if John wandered, he would stay within the confines of the house.
“Be quiet,” he whispers, insistent, but right now Mrs. Watson is well into drink three or almost-four and he slots his fingers slightly to let all of John’s sounds leak out between, like sunlight sliding through Venetian blinds.
It happens honey-drip slow, John’s eyes bright wide open and watching Sherlock’s face come close the whole time like waiting for the moon to eclipse the sun, going cross-eyed from looking until Sherlock becomes a blur of pale skin and dark hair and Sherlock is closing his eyes and John wonders whether he should close his too and then, contact, then - oh my god, this. For the first time in his life, another person’s mouth is pressed to his.
Sherlock raised the gun and considered for a moment - the brain or the heart? - as Kamanev put a bloody hand out, imploring, and Sherlock’s hand did not tremble, although he felt like it did, and he gently squeezed the trigger, and Kamanev’s mouth fell open, and all likely thoughts of his wife and children stopped in a burst of gore, splinters of bone and gobs of brain on the floor.
It was enough to make John wonder whether he had put his uniform on backwards that morning, or perhaps he had gotten some eggs in his hair from breakfast, or perhaps someone had hexed something truly awful, like a troll’s face, onto his back.
Regardless, John found new friends and if he thought at all about the boy that he’d met on the train, the boy that he’d wanted to be his Housemate, he made no indication of it. Sherlock hadn’t seen him between classes at all. During mealtimes Sherlock watched John laugh it up with his new mates, sitting with his back to the Slytherin table.
“Because he’s a psychopath,” Sally explained, as if she were speaking to a particularly intelligent piece of dusty fluff. “Psychopaths get bored.”
“You’re not distracting me that easily,” John said when he pulled away,  and he nipped playfully at Sherlock’s lip as punishment. He was smiling and his eyes were bright and his cheeks were flushed and he was panting a little, soft little huffs of breath between them. It was enough to make a man want to kiss him again. Devious.  “Now you go. When did you know you first wanted me?”
John was soundly scolded for not wiping his feet when he came in from play, and reminded that he must always bathe before bedtime. She changed the sheets. She dusted and she swept, and hoovered corner to corner, listening to the satisfying sound of tiny grains rattling about in a plastic tube.
“It’s going to be a heck of a time cleaning up,” said John, bending down to pick up some of the larger pieces of broken glass.
Sherlock turned to him, and the moonlight was on his skin, and the night was in his hair, and the slight curve of a smile rested on his full lips and despite the glacial color of his eyes John felt everything but ice.  He shifted uncomfortably in his seat, shifted his gaze to the movie screen.
"Demanding, aren't we?" Sherlock said, arching a brow. He pushed his fingers in hard then, a nice direct thrust to John's prostate that made him cry out, sharp, hips jerking up and precum dribbling out.
And so one afternoon he had tested his theory, the school hallway overly warm with the late rays of the day. Sherlock knows the anatomy of the school like a Bio lab dissection; its ins and outs, its organs and functions, its nervous and circulatory systems. He knows the schedule of its metabolism: what places would be empty and when, where one could disappear and where one could be alone.  He had waited for John at his locker after football practice, where he knew John would stop to grab his books and homework, ever the good little student, before hightailing it home. And oh, what a vision, oh, worth the wait: John’s hair all wet copper-gold from his shower, his skin still damp and flushed pretty-pink-warm, the front of his cotton shirt gently cloying to all that damp skin.
Those awful small, clutching hands. Those eyes. So large and pale, fixed upon her with a cold, unblinking stare. Hazel shuddered. She felt frost forming in her bone marrow.
Tonight was a favor to Harry, John says later, when they are back in the car and parked. This is fine.
John had never been picked last for a sports team before. He had never had to eat lunch alone. He’d always been invited to birthday parties, he got Valentines on Valentine’s Day, and he had always had mates on the playground. His new rapid decline in social status left him reeling, adrift in a strange place where almost no one wanted to sit next to him in class. As if he had somehow contracted a mysterious, infectious disease, or a miasma of stench clung to him, of which he was woefully unaware. He understood
Sherlock walks straight into the cornfield. In the late summer and fall it would be a forest of tall green stalks, same as John was used to, but this early on in the year the sweet corn is no higher than three feet. It rustles as Sherlock wades through, a man with intent.
Sherlock jumped up, shouting with shock. (It might have been a scream, even.) His cigarette dropped onto the carpet and John was suddenly an accessory to arson.
"Oh," says Sherlock, as if with epiphany. "Right here," he says, very lightly trailing his fingers over the obvious shape of John's erection through the layers of fabric. Very lightly he traces the shape of it, teasing, gentle brushes and suggestions of pressure, and then John gives a strangled little cry as he pushes his hips up and his whole body shudders hard as he comes with just that, the slightest touches from being so uncontrollably overstimulated.
Sherlock picked up the camera and sidled around behind his chair. “What’s wrong with documenting your face while you sleep?” He liked touching John, he liked having John near, but just now John was planting one foot firmly on the leather chair with a throttling kind of look in his eye. Sherlock drew his arm back, just in case John got strategic and went for the camera again. “I
“Thank you,” John said, for the gift of the very pretty stone. He looked down at his hand and then up at Sherlock’s pale and pretty eyes. “I thought you weren’t coming back.”
When Sherlock used to peeve him he went for walks to keep from strangling his flatmate. When Afghanistan loomed close, gunfire and heat and nitrile gloves smeared with blood, he grounded himself in the chaos of London.
“Those awful gits put them somewhere high so I couldn’t reach and I didn’t see them for a while. Bad news for them,” John said, straightening himself a little, “I am a Master of the Summoning Charm.”
He got hard. That was a relief. Of course he was a teenager and sex was on the menu and Jeanette was gorgeous, and he wanted her, but somehow it was still a relief that he could.  He was excited, erect, aroused. He wasn’t deficit or bent or broken. He loved the way she kissed him and the softness of her body. He was still all right.
“I used to believe in ghosts, when I was little,” John offers, when the credits roll. “Deathly afraid of them.”
Through the glass he saw him, those glittering feline eyes, the inky black hair and clothes, the sharpness of his face. The young man from last night.
“You must have a very good reason now, to subject yourself to the horror of such awful decor,” John said, cuddling on top of him. It was not a bad position for him to be in, all things considered. It was particularly nice to consider the way their bodies rubbed together whenever John shifted around.
It was just as well that he couldn’t find it. Sarah had a lot to tell him, like he was a nice boy, and she really, really liked him, and they’d had a swell time together, but...
“What’s a pact?” John asked, as this had not clarified anything for him. He had only just started school this year, after all, and had never heard these words before.
“S-so then control me, why don’t you,” John said, face hot but managing the words - mostly sounding smooth, he thought, with only the slightest stutter.
Sherlock had grown up with someone else to clean his gutters, to fix the leaks in the roof. He had never had to huddle three to a bed with his mother and sister when the heating sometimes went out in December. He had never learned how to do plumbing and shingles and plaster at the age of 14 because his family couldn’t afford to call someone to do the work, and it was his duty, anyway, as the man of the house.
Madam Pomfrey, however, did not seem to be aware of this sort of very crucial medical equipment. John was very disappointed, until Sherlock - forgetting his promise to behave - needled her about her inability to properly provide for her patients until she eventually came up with a small bag of Bertie Botts’ Every Flavour Beans that had been left behind by a previous patient. Sherlock deemed this as acceptable and dismissed her. It would have been amazing that she actually left when told, if not for the fact that she was only too happy to do so.
When Sherlock closed his eyes and thought of John, that first night replayed against his eyelids. The night lit intermittently by police flashers; John’s head tipped sidewise with those wry forehead wrinkles cast in flickering blue shadow; John’s eyes the gleaming black of a winter lake.
He gave John a shove to push him to the side, and then made to kick at Sherlock again. In this he made his fatal mistake: he turned his back on John Watson.
John pretends to be asleep when Sherlock slides back into bed. Sherlock traces his fingers over John’s skin as if absorbing him, like there is something here that needs to be preserved. John squeezes his eyes shut and does not think he can stand it.
Sherlock has been bored of Kansas since Missouri, and he is sick of corn - or so John gathers, as these have been the main sources of complaint for the past hour or so. John likes Kansas. It reminds him of a home that he had, once. The farmlands roll on forever in waves of green and gold, the air rich with the smell of cornfields and sorghum in the sun. At the next place they stop John buys a placard that declares, “There’s No Place Like Home!” bordered with sunny-yellow stalks of corn.
Greg Lestrade was notorious for his Gryffindor Spirit and ardent House Pride. Rumour had it that two years ago, when Slytherin had beat Gryffindor in the last Quidditch match of the season, it had taken three Prefects and a Professor to keep Lestrade from throwing himself into the lake. He was also the most brutal and tyrannical Quidditch Captain Gryffindor had seen in seventy-eight years, they said - it wasn’t a true Greg Lestrade practise unless one team member was sent to the Infirmary for exhaustion.
Harry hugs him suddenly, tight and fierce in a way that she hasn’t since he was eleven years old and afraid of the dark.
” and he suddenly found that he couldn’t, was nauseous at the notion of continuing even though he was hard for her and she was lovely and warm and wet.
Sherlock licks until John is near-sobbing, writhing and whimpering and making the softest little broken sounds. John is arching up, body drawn tight. The leather of the seat crinkles beneath him, his carefully-styled hair ruffles against it, all his put-togetherness coming undone.
John can feel his own heart beating when Sherlock kisses him. His heart thrills up in his chest, galloping like he’s just run an 8 minute mile. Sherlock’s lips are dry but his tongue is hot and wet. John feels like he could run forever.
They lie on the small twin bed facing one another, both of them gone quiet. Sherlock places a hand on John’s cheek.
Sally shook her head, regarding him with a look of near pity. “I don’t mean to offend, John. I just wanted to give you a bit of advice. It’s not too late. You need to stay away from that guy.”
“Not helping, Bill!” John cried. It was really quite a feeling, to have one’s fragile little ego, only recently rebuilt, shatter into a million pieces. He’d never quite experienced anything like it.
“Okay, that’s all. I wanted you to know. I have to go now, goodbye!” Sherlock said. He flashed Mycroft one of his quicksilver smiles, turned on his heel, and ran out of the room again - a small tornado of a boy, leaving a bemused brother in his wake.
John had arrived home from school on a Thursday, at the same time the postman (Mr. Daley) arrived at the Watsons’ front gate. “Mail for you, Johnny my boy,” Mr. Daley said, with a large smile, and John didn’t need Sherlock to deduce what it was, judging from the size of the envelope.
Sherlock lets it go on for as long as he can stand it, until he can’t stand it no more, and he grabs John’s hands by the wrists and pins them above his head, rocking into him. John opens his mouth for Sherlock’s tongue, hot and wet and alive. He likes the way Sherlock pushes it in deep and the way it moves; likes the way that Sherlock moves against him.
John moaned, low and long, a sound of pure sensuality. He gasped and his body shook with uncontrollable tremors, and then, with a deep-bone shudder, he was clenching around Sherlock once more.
“You may keep that unsightly creature in the Common Room,” Mycroft continued. “Merlin only knows what sort of unhygienic things you bring into your dormitory already without adding that to the pile. I found a nest of dead horklumps under your bed the other day. How long had they been there?”
He nudged his nose up the arc of John’s throat, brushing along the skin, tracing delicately. He breathed him in; the warm musk of John - imagined he could still smell that sharp, sour note of adrenaline in sweat.
So John got with Jeanette. He thought of it as going undercover, which was how he had rationalized Liza and Suzy and Pamela.  Of course, he had not actually gone under the covers with any of them. With Jeanette it was a real possibility. She was what they called a “fast” girl. She was like a Mercedes Gullwing Coupe or maybe a Chevy Corvette. And she had a heck of a classy chassis.
Sherlock runs the flat of his tongue against the underside of John's dick, all wetness and heat but no actual suction, no actual relief. The tips of his fingers skim the other side of it, stroking along the glans, feather-light touches against the hardness of it. His other hand rests on the trembling plane of John's stomach, over the cotton of his pressed button-up shirt.
She looked at Sally, then John. A quiet settled over the three of them like a breath being held. They all knew that the Moran boy had gone missing just over a month ago, and that was a fact.
His smile wilts at the edges. “Well, I guess that’s one thing she doesn’t have to worry about any more…”
John wants to say no. Say the same thing that he’s been telling Mrs. Hudson for the past few weeks, that he’s just very busy and doesn’t know when he’ll find the time. He could tell the truth and say that he just can’t. Victor would understand.
“We’re wearing moustaches because Bill wanted to protect his identity so he could keep hanging around you.
That insidious whisper, Sherlock’s tightening embrace, the words blooming inside John’s brain, “You’ve wanted this for a long time - right from the very first moment we met. You didn’t know it, but I could always see it in you,  from the very start. You simply didn’t know how to ask. You were meant for this. For me. This is inevitable.”
Hazel did not answer. She clutched John’s small, wet body to hers and carried him to shore. She did not put him down until they were high up the beach, firmly on dry land.
Sherlock eats his caramel fudge & pistachio cone and comments how the neon sign isn’t actually neon; it is in fact, filled with argon. John snaps a picture of him with pale-green ice cream on his face while he’s talking. When Sherlock reaches for the camera John quickly pushes the ice cream into Sherlock’s face as a defensive maneuver and then snaps another picture while he still has his life.
He wasn’t the only one who felt that awe. Sherlock's kiss was full of the wonder that he still had for this, in every press of lips amazement that John was his to touch, his to have; in every touch of tongue a discovery. He squeezed and rubbed John's body, enjoying the realness of him, the solid firmness of his thighs, the lush curve of his arse; all this was his, to reach for whenever he wanted. John warmed and softened under his hands, making little noises into the kiss that made Sherlock want to press into him and draw out more. His breath was hot against Sherlock’s wet lips when he drew back for breath. With each parting, John grew more urgent, sucking Sherlock’s bottom lip and the tip of his tongue, while Sherlock rubbed up and down his inner thighs. When they finally separated for air, Sherlock smiled and reached to undo the button of John’s fly...then stood and backed away.
And there was nothing quite like slipping a Horned Slug into your robes to make you stop and question your decisions up to this very vital, slimy point in your life.
“I think he likes you,” John said, still laughing as Sherlock attempted to disengage the slug as it stubbornly clung to his leg. It was a rather cute slug, as far as slugs went, patterned with spots - so that it was like a slimy little legless leopard. John wondered if there were any slugs that came with zebra stripes, but so far he had not seen any.
He rolled his hips to see John shudder, to feel the tightness of his wet, slick hole fluttering around him.
He looked back up. The cross was the right way up, just as it had always been. The eyes of Jesus were painted blue, very blue, with a dot of black for the pupil and an even tinier dot of white for the shine. John could see that they’d even painted on eyelashes. They must have used a very tiny brush.
John let Sherlock slide an arm around his waist and pull him close. “I’m sure you can,” John said, and they shared a wry smile. Sherlock could think of many things, and none of them were usually any good. “But it’s...really. It’s not you.”
John cracked open one eye to take in his expression, which apparently inspired insolent laughter. He collapsed against Sherlock in a fit of giggles. Sherlock really didn’t see what was so terribly amusing, and hated alcohol even more.
John considered this, and it made a lot of sense. He giggled a little, then, because the situation was kind of silly once he thought about it that way, and Sherlock giggled too.
“John,” Sherlock said, and cupped his face with one hand. His eyes suddenly so dark, his skin almost glowing, moon-drenched in the darkness. He ran his thumb over John’s lower lip - smearing the wetness of saliva, his and John’s mixed together. “This is what you want.”
“Do you know what I want to do to you right now?” he asked, pitching his voice to a low, authoritative rumble.  “Right now, I want to pick you up out of that chair and kiss you breathless.  Then, I want to put you on your back, spread out across the table with me standing between your legs while I tug each article of clothing off you, one by one.
And the types of discussion that followed perhaps didn’t require any complicated concepts, but John always felt illuminated, all the same.
John felt himself at the cliff’s edge, about to fall into the unknown. He was on the edge of uncharted waters. But he knew, already, there was no stopping, he’d already gone too far, it was, as Sherlock said-
Sherlock hedges John against a wall and kisses him underneath a picture of an even younger John playing softball, presses him against a field of vinyl dandelions repeated over and over on buttery yellow. Sears catalogue 1949. When their hips press together John moans into his mouth and the heat in Sherlock’s body is so intense he is certain he could melt linoleum, set all the vinyl flowers aflame.
Oh, it was just John. Her darling little boy, John, in his pyjamas, having climbed up the stairs and headed towards his own bed. It was funny, how the quiet, strange hours of the middle of the night turned the ordinary into the extraordinary, turned one’s little loved ones into fearsome strangers. She wanted to laugh at her own silliness, until she realised that she had heard the front door close, and that John had not responded to her voice.
“They will be sad, for a little while,” Sherlock admitted. “But then they’ll have another little boy, just like you. And then they’ll forget, the way humans always do.
“Were you or were you not at Pop’s on Main today?” John asked him. “Looked an awful lot like you. Same hair and everything.”
“Dubious,” said Sherlock, but he looked vaguely pleased at the thought. Well, at least John thought he looked pleased. He wasn’t frowning or looking sullen or anything like that. He looked at John in that odd, unsettling way he had, and his lips quirked just a tiny bit.
“Low tide,” Sherlock said. “When the tide comes in the cave fills up with water, so I could swim in, but the water’s too low when the tide goes out.”
“Okay,” John said, unable to help the warm flush that rose to his cheeks and the little flip in his stomach. Him! On the Quidditch team!
He shoves through the double doors of the gym; tightness in throat and chest, tightness in muscles of arm coiled, ready to contract in burst of motion. To act. To separate. To cleave in twain.
“Go to the bedroom and wait for me,” Sherlock told him when they parted. He didn’t really plan to do anything in the meanwhile. He only wanted John to be waiting.
In London, Sherlock says, on Cannon Street, there’s a stone set in the foundations of the city and people say that if ever that stone moves, London will crumble to dust.
When Sherlock pulled back, he reached for the lube, spilling it over his fingers in two generous squirts. He spread it over his own erection, needy and heated. He inserted the tip of the tube into John, squeezing it until the lube overflowed, dripping out of his tight hole, slick and wet and glistening obscenely. John shifted, moaning softly at the feeling of being filled with lube, cold and wet, but Sherlock was fascinated by the sight of his hole, shining wet and dripping. He slid his fingers into the mess just to feel the slide of it, and the excess lube that trickled out was warm with John's body heat, as if he had produced the liquid himself in preparation to be fucked.
He crawled on top of him, hands gripping wrists, John’s wrists pinned to the bed. John’s hips tilted up, rubbing himself against Sherlock’s thigh, like a dog that didn’t know anything other than his own need for release. Sherlock kissed him some more for it, heated and wet, tongue shoved in deep like he was trying to lick the back of John’s throat.
His logic was sound. Even just a mile seemed impossible at this rate, in this growing darkness. But there were some things that were beyond logic, the uncomfortable
John is rubbing away the red stamp of lipstick on Sherlock’s cheek, he is smearing it with his thumb, he is kissing his own imprint over it, soft press of lips, shape of his mouth, one kiss after another, until his mouth finds Sherlock’s mouth. He holds Sherlock there and kisses him then, kisses him until they both have to learn again what it means to breathe.
“But you like reading about the mysteries, the unexplained. You're like me, John. Curious. Sometimes you can't sleep, and you lie in bed facing the window, don't you? You’ve heard the unexplained noises that happen in the night. You wonder what might be out there.”
Sherlock’s eyes gleamed pure silver for a moment when the light shone on them, like John had seen Buttons’ - his cat’s - eyes do, in the dark.
It didn’t make any sense. He’d been certain he’d placed it into his pocket earlier that day. He’d worried it over and over in his fingers as if he were trying to polish brass into gold.
With the heat of Sherlock's erection pressed up right between his thighs John quivers and spreads his legs. Never done it before but boy's got good instincts.
She was not a stupid girl. The bruise on his shoulder, his mysterious stalker; she glared at him with knowledge and silent accusation. She knew the answers, too.
the special broadcast reminded all citizens - children, especially - to obey curfew, and to lock their doors at night.
He was burning up with all the restlessness of the day, cooped up inside, on account of his punishment, avoiding both Harry and his mother, on account of his embarrassment. Every cell, every molecule of him seemed to be vibrating with unused energy; a boy on the verge of explosion, or implosion - whichever came first.
Carl’s eyes widened and his mouth dropped open, and John added that expression to the list of things that he wanted to have commissioned.
On Tuesday, they had Potions class. Most people chose partners but Sherlock worked alone.  Sherlock’s copy of
It had been like this when Sherlock had first come home, returned from the land of the not-dead. They had not kissed then. Instead John had touched him, fingers unwavering, trailing down Sherlock’s face. John’s breaths had been shallow. His hand had been steady, and his pulse had raced. Every touch had significance, every breath had counted, and Sherlock had measured the heartbeats in the seconds that they were together, cataloguing each detail. John had been so still; as always, he was the calm and unblinking eye when life stormed around him. Only his fingers had moved, re-learning the angles of Sherlock’s face, like a blind man trying to see. Each one of them had been cataloguing the other.
John found Sherlock sitting on his bed when he got home, having clearly let himself in with the spare key the Watsons kept in the flowerpot. “Did you have a good time at the dance?”
Nothing makes any sense at all when Sherlock finds him after practice, school hallways empty and Sherlock’s eyes on him like frost and fire. There’s a look in Sherlock’s eyes that’s like a coyote after a lean winter gone on too long.
“Sherlock, please,” John begged, hands on the back of Sherlock’s neck, nuzzling against the hollow of his throat. “Please.”
No one said anything about gangs. That was a big-city fear, not realistic for their little town, with its population of 8,655.
Saliva filled his mouth, fog filled his mind. And in his body, a pulsating heat, an insistent throb. Spurt of fluid from the tip of him. He was covered with a sheen of sweat and terrified, trembling, stretched open, writhing, lost. No way to run away from the sensation, could only sob and give in to the bright white flashes.
“Are you going to sit and let me take a picture of you?” Sherlock asked, peering down at him through the lens of the camera, which stared at John like a giant bug’s eye.
“Just text me,” John says, inputting his number into Victor’s phone. Victor has an iPhone, and John is inordinately thankful because he knows how to work those. It wouldn’t do to look completely technologically inept in front of his new friend.
“I’m not hungry anymore,” John replied, gathering up his books as well as a few pumpkin pasties. “And I need to study.”
“You always walk slower to your first class, when normally, you practically run to everything. This past Tuesday you yawned five times during the lecture portion of Potions. It’s
Now he was in his room, arranging and re-arranging his things. He didn’t want it to necessarily be too neat, like some kinda square, but he didn’t want Sherlock to think he was a slob, either. The bed was neat and tidy, sheets and covers tucked in with the hospital corners just as Momma had taught him.
"Yes, but it has a much slower action time, and I simply do not have the time to sit here, applying direct pressure, while young Mr. Watson slowly heals."
“You’re always right. Doesn’t it get annoying?” John asked him. “You’re annoying, Sherlock. It’s very annoying.”
Her cheek will touch his cheek.  She will smell of lavender or roses. Her lips will be rouged red or pink.
“But it’s not just something trivial like that,” said Sally. “Do you know why they say those things about him - that he meddles with Dark Magic and things like that?”
John had been the one to choose California as their destination. The reason for his choice, however, was unbeknownst to Sherlock, although most things did not stay unbeknownst to Sherlock for long.
It sounded just as dumb aloud as his mother always said, and he fidgeted in his seat, looked down at his scabbed-over palms. His knees stung. Surely he should be nearing home by now? The ride seemed to be going on for longer than he remembered, even though the road was familiar.
“Sacred Wonder-full Anti-evil Guardian,” said Bill. “It should ward off bad luck, Curses, nightmares, and minor skin problems. And it will protect you from the Evil Eye.”
Sherlock shook himself off like a dog, splattering John with great big drops of seawater. John giggled, holding his hands up to try and shield himself from the sudden unexpected shower.
There was  a sudden growl of an engine rumbling to life. John froze. It came from somewhere down the street, he thought, hidden in the void between the streetlamps. He hadn’t even registered that there was a car there. Who could possibly be in it? The roads had been empty since the sun had set. Everybody was meant to be at home. The gasoline fumes of the engine wafted through the air, mixing in with the scent of damp earth and fallen leaves,  that wood-burning smell of autumn.  The tires crunched up gravel as it approached. Two yellow beams pierced through the darkness, as the car rolled towards him, with its glowing golden eyes.
It’s too much to process, all at once. The world is spinning around them. He pushes Sherlock off of him, energy uncoiled.
In London, Sherlock says, when the wind blows from the East, the river brings with it the smell of the sea.
Greg shrugged. “Ah, well. Like we say every year, there will always be next year.” He grinned. “And we’d have much better chances, you know, if we have an unbeatable winning team.”
Batman,” John corrected. “His real name is Bruce Wayne and he’s a millionaire and he's a superhero. He fights villains, and solves crimes, and keeps the city safe."
And yet John sometimes heard the revving of engines down his street. Deep into dark summer nights, while he slumbered under the blanket of August heat, the vibrations on the gravel reverberated into his dreams. From his open window the hooting and the hollering, the wild yells they trickled in, those fiendish sounds, that sometimes morphed into a howling that did not seem it could have come from the mouth of anything human.
The Wiltshire countryside boasted rolling green hills, dotted with trees. Hazel had never been so happy to see trees and hills in her life.
The moon - as seen through tinted windows - was heavy and full, low in the sky and closer than John had ever seen it.
” Sherlock said, his name so quiet, almost reverent, like a prayer upon those faintly pink lips. “You won’t be struck down by lightning if you were to take your crucifix off the wall, you know. You don’t need that to watch over you.”
“They only don’t work because it’s our John,” Bill protested. “He only recognises us because he’s so close to us!”
John chanted inside his head. Of course it was probably Ravenclaw. That was what made sense. He wondered what the hat saw when they placed it on your head. Did it see all your thoughts, picked through the type of person you were? It must. What did the inside of Sherlock’s brain look like?
Flash. One after another. Sherlock stalked closer, blithely ignoring John’s free arm waving in impotent rage. He was as bad as the paparazzi that hounded them on a regular basis. He was as bad as that Milton Lester, Kitty Riley’s personal photographer, who lay in wait for them in the alley beside Angelo’s and hid in the bins outside of Tesco’s.
Hazel screamed. She did not intend to scream. She could not help it. The horror burst from inside of her, it rushed out of her throat and flooded loudly out of her wide-open mouth.
"Obviously, I'm taking pictures of you." He danced back another step, holding the camera high so John couldn’t reach it. He snapped another photo, just in case it got something interesting. “So you can have a better photo than that catastrophe of a blog avatar you’ve been using.”
In the end he could not will his feet to move. They seemed heavy, stuck to the pavement, with the trees whispering around him and those headlights shining bright like yellow moons growing ever closer and surely it would just drive on by, surely it had not come for him -
to peer at John curiously when he entered, and then, after giving him a sort of up-and-down, closed its eyes again.
Sherlock felt an answering tumbling in his stomach that may or may not have had to do with the cabbie’s driving.
But kissing Victor is good, so good - still good in all his sobriety, and they stay up late together one night heckling a stupid romantic comedy and Victor likes all the restaurants John shows him and Victor says ridiculous things to make him laugh and Victor understands about Sherlock and for the first time in what feels like forever John wants something again and Victor understands him. All in all, that’s more than John has had with his last four or so girlfriends, so that’s good.
“I like...I like it, Sherlock,” John says, the words panted out. Sherlock likes how John’s voice catches, just so, on his name. He likes how John arches his body forward, offering it up for the touching, the grabbing.
“What did you want to show me?” John asks when he catches up to him. “Well, other than the fact that you’re the best looking scarecrow for miles around.”
John heard whispers that rippled out from around him, and he knew they had to be about him. And yet it seemed that they were all talking about someone else. The voices landed on distant shores.
"You’re a good man, Greg," John said. And then, to further extend his outlandish gratitude. "I think I love you, Greg."
Sherlock also had fins attached to his ears, which John could see now, now that the two of them were closer. They’d been partially covered by his dark hair before.
“Do you still want me to delete the photos, John?” Sherlock asked him, words pressed to sticky, sweet skin. He marked the curve of John’s shoulder with a line of wet kisses, scraped his teeth over his collarbone.  His hand spread warm on John’s chest, rubbing and exploring. Index and middle finger found a nipple, grazing it delicately before he rolled it between his index finger and thumb.
Two fingers slid in easy, pulling the sort of moan from John that told Sherlock of the burn that he must feel and yet he pushed back, asking for more, greedy for it. Two fingers spread apart and into the vee of them Sherlock slid his tongue, flickered it in and out. John’s thighs shook and Sherlock could feel the muscles quiver beneath his hand. Sherlock’s dick twitched in response to every small whimper, the both of them burning with the knowledge that John would get more when Sherlock was ready for it, not when John thought he was, no matter the amount of pleading or begging.
John smiles, pulls him in for another kiss, this one softer. Feels Sherlock’s skin warm, his shirt slightly damp with sweat.
When both wrists were fastened, John tested his strength, yanking hard so that the chains rattled, but it all held fast. His breathing was fast, pupils dilated at his own vulnerability.
“You already have the kettle on,” noted Sherlock. “I like chocolate biscuits. I’ll have those.” And then, as an afterthought, “Professor. Please.”
On Jeanette, however, Sherlock had no witticisms or snarky observations to share.  John might say, “I’m thinking of taking Jeanette down to the roller rink. What do you think? Is that all right?”
He’s heard it since he was a child, and wondered why his mother forbade him from the windows at night, why she barricaded his bedroom door. He wondered why, when he asked about the ocean, he was always quickly shushed.
“Did you just call me fat?” Victor mumbles, face still buried in John’s neck. John can feel his voice rumble through both their chests, low and rough with early morning, thrumming with satisfaction. Morning-After voice. “Good morning to you too, starshine.”
John wanted to point out. Then again, psychopaths were probably eleven at some point in their lives. They didn’t just pop out of their mothers, fully-grown and in their thirties, and start murdering people.
Their bodies pressed close, then - and wanted closer still. They pressed against one another, hands and hearts entwined. Their breaths slowed and evened out together - rising, falling together - soft and sighing in the night.
”, with a smiling skull printed on the label. Next to that there was an identical bowl full of pills labelled, “
“I don’t need your help,” Sherlock snapped, snatching his books right out of John’s hands. “I don’t need anybody’s help.”
“Well, it’s not every day that one comes back to her office to find a Mexican standoff awaiting her,” said Professor Hudson as she arrived.
Sherlock bit his lip. Torn between temptations, he looked over at John, who’d rolled up onto one elbow to watch him as suspiciously as he could manage in his sensory fog.
And that was all right. That was fine. It was exactly as Sherlock had predicted and he was, as always, right, and he couldn’t care any less, really, it wasn’t like people ever existed for any real purpose other than to be great disappointments to him. Sherlock pounded the mortar with the pestle so hard that the whole lab bench shook and glass vials rattled, pulverising the snake fangs into fine dust. And at no point did he look down to the empty seat beside him.
Sherlock took his pleasure, greedily, easily. The sight of John so lost to sex and sensation made him helplessly aroused, made the dirty lust burn hot inside of his body, his own heart pounding and breath smouldering in his lungs. He rammed himself in deep, and John groaned and pushed back, wanting deeper, needing it, all the while moaning like a whore. John had always been like this, meeting him halfway, two thirds of the way, all the way; he wanted everything Sherlock could give him and then he always begged for more. He had always been miraculous, in his own way.
This of course prompted Sherlock to immediately clap his hand over John’s mouth, since he’d promised Madam Pomfrey 1.) not to make a commotion 2.) not to disturb John 3.) not to kill John, and although Sherlock was fairly sure he could get away with breaking the last two rules without ever being found guilty, if John screamed she might think he was guilty of all three.
“You shouldn’t have had so much to drink,” chastised Sherlock. “Your metallisation…metbatolism..metabolic rateof alcohol can’t be very high, due to your small stature.”
It takes time, and patience, but Sherlock is nothing if not methodical. One by one he could catalogue all of John Watson's responses, stimuli and response, cause and effect.
John looked over at Sherlock, who only nodded impassively. He had seen people be nasty to Sherlock several times already, and it was hard to believe a stern talking-to from a teacher and a deduction of House points would make it all stop so easily.
“Tea and biscuits,” Sherlock ordered as he sat down, sinking down an inch or so into the comfy sofa.
“Sherlock, wait,” John said, breathless, pulling back. He felt dizzy, almost, hot all over. Just like a flick being switched he was suddenly aware of his own nudity; he’d never been naked like this before, even in the gym showers and the boys’ locker room everyone dutifully averted their eyes. And strangely, in the dark, it seemed like he could feel Sherlock’s eyes even more, could see them bright, burning when they looked at him. He felt too exposed, vulnerable, flushed pink all over and wanting and embarrassed by it all. It was too much, too soon.
John turned around instinctively at the sound of his name, to find Sherlock standing there, his dark hair outlined by golden sun in the early morning light.
The water would feel so nice right now. The wet sand would be cool, squishing between his toes. And over on the side of the beach, jutting out into the water, there was a cave, its open mouth inviting exploration. Caves, John knew, were always full of exciting things, like dragons and pirate treasure. Or even dragon pirate treasure.
“Although I wouldn’t worry so much about hurrying to dinner,” he said. “I don’t imagine there will be a seat for you, anyway.”
He could hardly remember what had happened at school that day, what classes he’d gone to, if he’d learned anything. He’d looked down at the lines of notebook paper, at the Battle of Georgetown and at Shakespeare, at all those letter equations and a diagram of the cell,  and all he could think about was the touch of Sherlock’s lips on his own.
“For the last time, it’s Madam Pomfrey, Mr Holmes,” Madam Pomfrey corrected. “Not ‘you incompetent woman.’ The same goes for ‘you silly woman,’ ‘you idiotic woman,’ or anything else of that nature.”
voices raising up to the rafters, and Jesus was beautiful and bleeding but no one saw him bleeding, John felt too hot, sick, sick to his stomach and the Stations of the Cross were pressing in around him, the blood on the crucifix, on the Lord, blood of the covenant drip, dripping down in thick scarlet rivulets, getting caught in Jesus’ long dark lashes,
I do,” John was quick to reassure. He reached for her hand again but this time she did not give it to him.
Hazel started awake in the guest room, with great surprise. She had been woken by the first early rays of sun, for it was morning. She had slept the whole night through.
After Bill and Mike left, John fell back asleep, as the potion had a definite soporific effect on him. He woke up at one point to find that dinner had appeared and then he, subsequently, made some of it disappear. He was thankful for the sleeping, because otherwise it would have been unbearably boring.
John was inclined to agree, although he didn’t know if being a great Beater made up for being a horrible person.
“Not that one, you incompetent woman!” Sherlock practically shouted. “That potion stings! You’re going to hurt him!”
“Not where people can see,” John says, the words stuttering as he’s begun to pant softly in the spaces between syllables. Sherlock bites him underneath the Adam’s apple in retaliation, worries the soft, vulnerable skin between his teeth, and sucks hard.
"Of course it’s taken.” Sherlock moved in to occupy the space freed up by John’s sway-back. It may have been his imagination, but the air felt warm. Perhaps he should experiment sometime to see if John left a human-detectable heat trail. He was certainly warm enough in bed. “That and any other references to Bond movies. I know that, and I don't even like Bond."
The mothers nodded, the children as well. Then the mothers went back into their neat white houses with their pastel doors painted in springtime colors, with their green lawns and picket fences. The children resumed their play. The police car turned the corner and resumed its slow roll down onto the next street, first the siren, then the announcement:
“There’s two ways we can go from here. It’s not too late for it to just be a drunken hookup. A one-time kind of thing.”
“Say your name, your whole name, and say ‘I agree to the contract,’” Sherlock said. “That’s a special thing you have to say. Oh! And you have to say, ‘I do it freely.’”
just said that I should try out for the Quidditch team next year, because I have an ‘excellent build for a Seeker.’”
“The way I figure it,” said Bill, “about 20% of Gryffindor House is on your side, 20% of Gryffindor is on Powers’ side, and the remaining 59% hate you both equally. The other 1% being us, of course, who are your true friends and will stand by you no matter what poor, awful decisions you make or bad company you keep.”
“It can,” Hazel said, although she knew she was as wide awake then as she was now. More awake, even, made hyper-alert with adrenaline and fear. She closed her eyes and let Tom tuck her head underneath his chin.
“I believe I have some apologising to do for yesterday,” Sherlock said, his voice deep in his chest. Blue eyes flickered open, as if awakening from a deep and pleasant sleep. And there, there it was: the exact look of amazement that had first captivated him, right from the very start.
Mycroft was the one who found him, all of fifteen and sprawled out on his own bed with the needle still partially dangling out of the point of connection in his arm, into skin, into vein, Sherlock staring at the ceiling with pinpoint pupils - miosis, not to be confused with meiosis - taking in nothing, taking in everything. He had been proud of himself, briefly, having managed to score his first hit off of Maryanne’s brother who lived in the city, who had access to drugs but needed information more, needed to know which of his buddies was screwing him over (it had been Fred). He remembers Mycroft’s look of complete shock then, and that odd twist of satisfaction that Sherlock had felt at being still all full of surprises. He remembers not remembering anything at all.
"No, you don't," Sherlock said, "You don't have to tell your Mummy anything. You don't have to tell anyone anything, if you come with me. No one will tell you what to do, anymore."
In July of 1953 an arsonist started a wildfire in Mendocino National Park in California. It burned for over two days, destroying 1300 acres and claiming 15 lives. Fourteen volunteer firefighters and one Forest Service employee had been burned to death, trapped by the dense brush and the steep terrain.
“Don’t,” said Sherlock sternly, grabbing his wrist and pulling it away, pinned it down to the bed. His grip was iron. John tried to tug at it and found that his sham of a struggle was useless, and what was worse, that only excited him more.
John turned, an inexplicable dread thudding in his heart. Then he saw Sherlock’s face, and was struck, suddenly, by his sharpness, his peculiar beauty, his wicked good looks - not for the first time, but the first time he allowed himself to think such things - and gasped softly.  Sherlock smiled a (gently) feral smile, at him, just for him, and a pang of want strummed a chord through his chest, and a feeling like warm, sticky caramel trickled down his insides.
"Sherlock," John says; he's balled up tight, his muscles tense, fingers undoubtedly white with the way he grips Sherlock's body. "Kiss me," John says; both a plea and a demand, and Sherlock kisses him twice, once for each meaning of it. He slides his tongue into the wet heat of John's mouth; John's soft tongue slipping against his, just the way Sherlock has taught him to.
He slid a finger in next to his tongue, the slide of it eased by saliva alone. He crooked it just right and felt John’s body jerk in response, heard the catch in his throat and the high-pitched noise that was reflexive and couldn’t be caught. He rubbed and pushed with just one finger, his tongue licking along the edge of John’s hole, his own body burning with the pleasure of John opening up for him, with the sounds of John alternating between soft curses and the building, uncontrollable whimpers singing into his brain.
It looked like a picture in a book, so clean and bloodless, or like an anatomy model one might see in a museum. John almost wanted to touch it, to reach out with his hands and feel the intestines, the stomach, the lungs, the--
Chiming, overlapping, trilling: every door in the neighborhood was open, every house alive with the sound. The mothers stood on their porches, ringing, ringing golden bells, hailing their children back. Their voices joined together, chanting,
Sherlock’s got a new car. His other car was a bit older; hot rodded because back then cars weren’t made with so much power. (Towards the late 1950s-1960s they started making more powerful cars; the 1960s was the era of the muscle car. ) The 1958 Ford Thunderbird was the first T-bird model to have a backseat...you can bet Sherlock saw that and was like, “Oh hell yeah.”
Then they were stopped. They were on a cliff, looking out at the large moon and the vast black curtain of night. The city was below; glimmering and full of lights. The sky was above, glimmering and full of stars.  The sky opened. Before them, there was a giant movie screen, unlike any John had ever seen before.
When Sherlock decided to move again, he fucked him at a leisurely pace, thrusting his cock up into slick, luxurious heat. His thrusts were slow and careful, pulling out barely an inch or two at a time, relishing in the drag of his cock along the tight grip of John’s insides, just barely rubbing against the sensitive bundle of nerves inside of him. John keened and whined, trying to raise himself up so that he could drop himself down hard onto Sherlock’s cock. His insides needed to be filled up so badly. Sherlock squeezed the flesh in his hands and prevented it, holding John tightly still.
Sherlock’s eyes gleamed in the darkness, like the eyes of a cat, pale and glittering, catching the ambient light. Shadow. Shadow. Light again.
"Am I interrupting something?" John says tightly; in about .45 seconds his expression has gone from shocked to quietly furious.
"You promised," Sherlock reminds him, placing a kiss against a rib, and then on the soft flesh of his stomach. John nods and Sherlock works his pants off, underwear and all, fancy polished dress shoes on the floor and then John is completely exposed, for the first time in front of him, if not for his socks.
Sherlock shrugged. “Sleep with her, don’t sleep with her, knock her up. Hell, have twins. None of my beeswax.”
He shifted down quickly, shoved John's legs open himself and forced his thighs to spread. Grabbed one cheek of his arse and squeezed it hard, round and firm in his hand, and held him open as he licked a hot, wet stripe up the crack of John's arse.
There were a number of reasons that John could be missing. He could have simply fallen ill, and gone to the Infirmary rather than attend classes today. There was that Vesuvian Vomitus going around, after all - only Sherlock had already expressly advised him how to avoid it. Or worse, something might have happened to him en route to class; poor John could have fallen victim to any of the unknown horrors that prowled the school hallways. Then again, this was unlikely, as the most recent edition of
“Faster,” John will always be the first to urge, although Sherlock with his grip already on the throttle has never known what it’s like to take it slow. The world blurs past them in inconsequential streaks. John is a demon for speed. When all of him clutches to Sherlock’s body like this there is nothing that reminds Sherlock more of the fact that today could be the day that they die.
What a strange day he was having. As he walked through his school’s black-and-white tiled corridors, he could hear his own steps out of rhythm. It seemed that he was always half a step behind or a step ahead of everybody else.  It was as if he were moving through a dream; everything just slightly moved half an inch to the right. He might wake up any moment and find himself, once again, in his own bed, ready to repeat the morning.
quite brilliant,” John said with a little smile. He normally did not like to brag, especially not about fighting, but Carl was such a wanker. “I think I broke his nose!”
By now, however, the students had already split up into their groups, working in pairs and threes; divvying up the tasks amongst them, taking notes and gathering ingredients.
“Have you heard these songs? Have you listened to what your children are listening to? These songs that tell of the allure of the dark. They say, ‘Tonight is Right for Love.’ They say, ‘I Need Your Love Tonight.’ They make the darkness romantic. They encourage rebellion. They tell our children to break the rules.”
one harrumphed, but did not comment, as he had occupied himself with far more interesting task of making the dressing.
As John launched into yet another tirade about people who did not finish their course of antibiotics and how the human race would all be wiped out by an epidemic of superviruses that we ourselves created, Sherlock picked up his violin and
Sherlock coughed delicately, as if he begged to differ. John had to think about it. While violence had resolved the problem of Carl’s yammering rather quickly, the problem of Carl being a complete pillock still remained. It was, admittedly, not a long-term solution.
Before he could even gather his thoughts properly, Sherlock laughed.  “Relax, I’m only teasing,” he said.
“Well, it can’t be forever,” said Mike. “Once we graduate we won’t be able to keep people from messing with it.”
“It’s actually the middle of Kansas. That’s a specific kind of nowhere,” Sherlock corrects him, right before he gets out of the car.
John jerked back from the flash going off in his face, cursing as hot tea splattered down the front of his jumper and jeans. “Fucking
John makes Sherlock stand next to the twine ball for a picture. Sherlock makes a face like one would expect Sherlock Holmes to make when standing next to an enormous ball of twine.
The cab reeked of mango-sherbert scent air deodoriser (Tropical Breeze, on the label), layered on top of the stale scent of cigarette smoke in attempt to cloak it. Sherlock closed his eyes and recalled the Rorschach-blot-pattern of blood and brain on the wall, thought about the surety of the gun in his hand, and he felt nothing.
“I’ve been in these rooms for seven years. This is the first time you’ve ever commented,” John noted, with amusement.
"Shh," said Sherlock, and sucked a kiss on his thigh as he slid his fingers out. "I'll give you what you need."
Blood. There was a trickle of blood running down Jesus’ heavenly, handsome face, but that was impossible,
John can feel the oxygen slipping from his body, slowly depleting from his bloodstream. Redness fills his vision when he closes his eyes. Sherlock’s hand is so warm and strong. Sherlock’s body so solid beneath him, his embrace tightening and John is hyperaware of their bodies moving together, his body being filled, aware of the rub of Sherlock’s cock along his insides, pressure in all the right places, the head of Sherlock’s dick rubbing against his prostate, dragging wickedly along it, making all the nerve endings sizzle. He whimpers, the only sound that he can make with the limited air that he has. His panting has been completely reduced to tiny breathless noises.
Sherlock’s mouth was on his, swallowing his breath, his sounds. John opened for him, mouth and body both, wet, Sherlock’s cool tongue flickering, licking into his mouth. He tasted something coppery, dark loamy earth underneath, again that perfumed scent of flowers drying. Metallic taste of lust in the back of his throat as Sherlock began to rock into him once more.
,” John said, because Sherlock was, all of him, a mer- well, boy, with a tail, with everything. Sherlock preened, twisting his tail so that all his scales gleamed handsomely in the sun. His smile was sharp and white.
“Fine, thank you. Yourself?” John responded, ever polite; his good manners second nature. Momma had raised him well, after all. Sherlock smirked, clearly amused, and John could only groan inwardly at his own square-ness.
John looked up at him, and steeled himself. He had always been brave, unafraid. He took a step forward, and didn’t tremble, although he had the dizzying feeling of taking a footstep towards a cliff. As when one looks down from a great height and is overcome with the impulse to jump. And another step, and another - moving both too slow and too quickly, as if in a dream.
He brings John’s hand to his own mouth, kisses each of the dirtied fingers, gently laps them clean. His own fingers reach out and he rubs the semen over John’s skin, staining the purity of him with white.
hurt. I wouldn’t be surprised if one day we’ll be standing around a body and Sherlock Holmes’ll be the one who put it there. ”
Sherlock pulled back so that he could look at him. He was rewarded with the sight of John’s face nearly slack in bliss, eyes closed and lashes fluttering, mouth parted in a little ‘O’ to suck in air for the moans that escaped him. Sherlock skimmed his fingers down the edge of John’s jaw, down his throat, teasing the curve of a collarbone. John leaned forward, following the touch. Sherlock closed the distance and kissed him, slow as the trickle of traffic through London streets, until his John was reaching for him again, fingers brushing their way through his curls.
There had been a time when John had stopped Sherlock from touching him anywhere below the waist. There had been a time when John had reminded Sherlock “just kissing.” Now here he was, standing practically naked in Sherlock’s garage, being fondled and clutching at Sherlock’s shoulders, moaning for it. Wanting more than just touching.
Sherlock has turned away. He is spectacularly irritated at a world that allows him to run out of smokes. He flicks open his lighter and snaps the wheel with his thumb, running his other fingers through the flame. He can feel John’s eyes on him.
He was on the opposite side of the train from the platform, so he could not wave to his parents even though he knew for sure that they were waving at the train as departed, saying goodbye to him and Harry, calling out that they loved them. It was the first time John had ever been away from his parents. There was a funny feeling in his throat and as much as he swallowed, he couldn’t seem to get rid of it.
“You want to know more than just what you’ve been told. You want something more than everything you know.”
there were probably more idiots in Hogwarts than all of the owls, house elves, and local population of Magical fauna combined.
, reads the letters arching over the gate. Over the entrance, painted green letters reiterate “THE BIG WELL” - just in case anyone missed it - with a giant arrow pointing down.
wallpaper and berber carpet splattered with telltale flowers of blood. It was John stirring the sugar into Sherlock’s tea in the morning, with the same hand that had fired a gun the night before. It was bickering over whether or not one could perform dissections of necrotic severed limbs upon the kitchen table, and savage battles of rolled-up newspapers to determine who had power of the remote control for the evening.
John, completely bound up, was unable to do anything except take it. He moaned, wet and loud even through the gag, shuddering hard every time the head of Sherlock’s dick pushed against the swollen nub of his prostate.
The pain did only last a second, because then Sherlock was licking the bite wound with soft flickering tongue, cool and wet, soothing away the hurt. John watched, fascinated, as his own blood dripped out. Sherlock’s mouth was smeared with red.
“I wasn’t waiting,” Sherlock snapped, but his hands on John were quick, impatient, and his kisses immediately greedy, as he undressed him with the rushed urgency of someone who has already wasted too much time.
"It's like I told you," Sherlock  tells him, one finger moving in and out. "You're going to be tight," and he feels his own body shudder at saying those words, "So we'll take our time. Stretch you open, nice and wide, until you can take my cock."
“I could have told you that,” Sherlock said to John. “You can tell by the way they twitch their noses.  Also, you should stay away from apricots, if you know what's good for you.”
“What kind of sweets do you have?” he asked Madam Pomfrey, because this was a staple of every hospital or doctor’s visit he’d ever had. He was certain that there was a supply closet somewhere in every hospital and clinic that was purely for shelving sweets, while the bandages and plasters and needles all lived somewhere else.
She threw herself, running, down the beach, kicking up bursts of sand. She ran straight into the water, legs pumping, churning the waves up around her. The water weighed down her robes and her nightgown, and still she kept running. She did not stop until she reached John’s side, panting, and snatched him up into her arms with a half-swallowed sob.
Sometimes, people said such awful things, that it was like they had this knife or an icicle or some very sharp object that they could stab straight into your heart. John’s face scrunched up and his lower lip trembled, ever so slightly.
“You’ll have a new home, with me,” Sherlock said. “You’ll sleep on a bed of soft sand, and seaweed will a pillow make, and I’ll cover you with a blanket of waves. I’ll curl up around you and keep you warm.”
turned solely upon him. John fought back a sob of lust. It was like Sherlock was peeling him down into the sheets of a CT scan.
Sherlock makes a noise that is somewhere between confusion and disgust; a typical ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about but I am almost certain that it is stupid but I refuse to admit I don’t know what you’re talking about’ Sherlock kind of sound. John sings not-so-quietly to himself for the next 10 miles, until Sherlock threatens to throw his souvenir collection out the window if he doesn’t stop, and then John switches to humming underneath his breath. Then somewhere around Miami (the Oklahoma one, not the beaches one), Sherlock mutters, “...doin’ fine, Oklahoma...Oklahoma, O.K.!”
“Little flutter bum’s got you completely snowed, man,” Vic laughs, flicking his lighter open and closed, over and over again.
“Do you think people are acting strangely towards me today?” John asked them in Charms class, as they were practising the Summoning Charm.
He gripped John by the hips, then, finally began to fuck him in earnest. He thrust up with harsh, quick, jabbing strokes, bouncing John upon his lap. He dug his fingers into the firm flesh of John’s arse, loving how easily he could move and manipulate his smaller body. How he could hold John and shove inside of him, pushing into all that velvety heat.
And so he whispers in between kisses, “The name is Sherlock Holmes” and John is whispering back “John, John Watson” their names melding together in the same breath, introducing themselves to each other, playing at being lost, playing at finding each other, playing at being older, after all this time, waiting all this time, the desperate hope that no matter the time or place, that they would find each other.
Sherlock was looming over him, spreading him again, looking at him, hissing with satisfaction at what he’d done. John could see his face now, could see that predatory glint in his eyes and in the darkness, a slow spread of a smile, all gleaming
“But I do. I loathe it. And you all hate it too, don’t pretend like you don’t,” Sally continued, although she had lowered her voice a bit.
As he closed his eyes, he could hear the rumble of an engine coming to life, the sound of tires rolling down an empty street...
Couldn’t think, couldn’t finish a thought, and the thrusting wasn’t slowing down, it was merciless. Crimson blooming in his mind, and heat all inside his body, thought of, (
had come from.) She let him kiss her there, and it was all sweet and soft and not like kissing Sherlock at all (and his stomach knotted up funny, thinking of Sherlock) and although it seemed that they both enjoyed it he couldn’t help smiling with relief when she said, “Just kissing, John,” because she was a good girl, you see.
slug. We fed him and we’re going to train him and we gave him a name.” He reached into the jar and pulled out Rachmaninoff from where it had been nestled, as its slimy brethren attempted to slowly climb the glass walls. “And he likes you. We can’t stew him! Just look at this cute, adoring little face! We must save him!”
Sherlock’s skin, on the human boy part of him (and not the fishy boy part of him) was warm and soft, just like John’s. His hands, John noticed now, had thin, transparent webbing between his fingers, up to the first knuckle. There were lines across his neck like John had seen on pictures of sharks. They fluttered, a little, with Sherlock’s laughing breath, when John asked to touch.
"Point," Sherlock said. He carefully placed the bottle down onto the table with its goo-filled brethren. He then turned and, without warning or provocation, shoved a great glass terrarium full of Horned Slugs onto the floor. John watched it happen with fascinated horror; how it slid off the table, and then toppled. It shattered with a loud crash, showering glass shards and slugs all over the floor.
Sherlock buried his face into John’s neck and breathed him in, that hot, humid smell of sex - like the waves of heat that radiated off the ground in heavy summer when it rained. It filled his nostrils and tickled the back of his throat, making him salivate.
“Oh, it’s so nice to have friends,” remarked Professor Hudson, quite pleasantly, as she turned to the remaining three boys. The next thing she said, however, while still in that pleasant tone, sent a horrid little chill wriggling down John’s spine like an icy caterpillar.
“In analogous response, however,” Sherlock says, voice pitched low and rough with desire, "I bet the sensations travel straight to your dick. When I touch and squeeze them, do you feel your body clench? Do you feel your balls tighten? You've gotten so hard for me that it almost hurts, doesn't it?"
There had been a gun in his hand tonight, and a gun held against John’s temple. There had been a man who was no longer, nothing where a man used to be, and a blank nothingness inside Sherlock where sickness used to be. The scent of hot fresh blood and the heat of intestines was familiar but right now there was only summer rain heat flooding his nostrils, the sound of John moaning in sheer pleasure beneath him and John’s insides around him, hot and tight and perfect, and Sherlock's limbic system was lighting up in all of its complexity, all the axons firing electrical signals like stars flaring in the dark.
A chase ensued. Sherlock pressed the shutter haphazardly as he pursued an elusive-yet-loudly-protesting John around the room. John was not making himself an easy target, pulling out various pieces of furniture to block Sherlock’s path and tossing various objects in his general direction.
“One, I want it to be private, and two, I hate having my picture taken, it never comes out right. Now stop it!” John said. Sherlock reached up with his other hand to tilt the camera down and aim it at John. John ducked back, a hand flung up in front of his face.
Thank you so much to prettyarbitrary for the last-minute beta!! all my love and hopeless devotion to Archia, for all the hand-holding, the hair-stroking, reassurances, murmurs of love, and the late-night inspiration...
started up. That was only John - sleepwalking again. The drawn-out howling, those doleful, animal cries - that was the dog.
The only problem was that it was very large, and the shelves towering and arranged in labyrinthine formation, which made it very difficult to find anybody inside it, nevermind a Slytherin first year who usually did not want to be found.
He doesn't trust himself to speak. If he talks he might say something ridiculous, he might say let me, let me fuck you, he might beg. If he stops kissing John long enough to let him talk, John might say no.
John wanted to know how Sherlock knew that he’d named it, but Sherlock was clearly magical (extra-magical, really) and instead he told him, “It’s Gladstone.”
“Just call it an ‘it’,” Sherlock said, managing, at last, to pull the slug off his leg and placing it upon the table. It slowly began to inch towards Sherlock again.
John moaned openly, whorish and unashamed, burying his face into his own arm, teeth scraping against his own flesh. He squirmed wildly from the stimulation and Sherlock stopped his licking to bite him for it - although it was for himself as well - teeth sinking in to the flesh of one arse cheek, that satisfying sensation of flesh between his teeth. John arched, cried out, head hitting the pillows hard. The curve of his body was mathematical and the sound of his voice was musical, screaming out one pure note that was pitched perfectly midway on the scale of pleasure and pain.
Her words were stolen away from her, strangled in the grip of a sharp wind. She could not tell if the water on her face was tears or rain.
Victor breaks away, his hair mussed, cheeks flushed and lips reddened from kisses. His dark eyes shine in the light of the living room lamps. But he looks at John and he hesitates, although John can feel his erection pressing against him, something that thrills him and terrifies him all at once. Victor sucks in a breath and says, “Stop if you don’t really want this. ”
Sherlock wiped his gun with a handkerchief and tucked it away. He took a step away when the whole world spun around him, the ground beneath his feet suddenly wavering, and he collapsed with palms against the grit of gravel, breath too fast and the buildings warping illogically around him, concrete walls bulging, pressing in too tight.
Hazel had left John in the bath 20 minutes ago, and now she was returning to check on him. He was old enough to bathe himself, but he still needed reminders to scrub and wash behind his ears. Such activities were often forgotten when one was busy splashing around and playing battleship with the sponges.
“You don’t have gills,” he said, and he stroked, very gently, along the sides of John’s neck. His fingers were slippery like little fish. John giggled at the tickle of them sliding, smooth against his skin.
“Look at you,” Sherlock said, because he knew John was looking. His voice had that roughness to it that came out only during sex, that John knew so well. John’s blood ran hot all through his body, and a small damp spot formed underneath Sherlock’s fingers, right where they insisted on pressing and rubbing the material against the sensitive head of his cock - the wetness of his own excitement.
He is old enough, now. Old enough for this wanting. To know what that flip in his tummy means, and to know when he’s being flirted with, even when it comes from another boy. A man. The slight curl of a lip, inviting; the intense appraisal through dark lowered lashes. The slow drag on the cigarette, and the shape of those full lips kissed together on the exhale, surrounding John in a wraith of smoke.
Red juice dripping. He was lost, he was losing himself. This was sin, he’d given himself over to the licking flames of hellfire, his sins had found him out, and there was a cold scrape of sharpness over his skin like the dull edge of a knife.
No room for bursts of blood and brain inside Sherlock's head now, no room for emptiness; all his empty spaces had been filled with John, the warmth of him seemingly endless.
Sherlock’s tongue was inside his mouth and Sherlock’s hands seemed to be everywhere, as if they wanted to probe every crevice of his body, touching and rubbing him in too many places, and John’s skin was tingling, buzzing all over with too much sensation. Greedy. All-consuming. As if Sherlock couldn’t get enough of him. Touching, squeezing, running up and down the sensitive insides of his thighs, making him shudder with frightening intensity; he could feel himself twitch and leak inside his pants, and it was too much, he was spiralling out of control.
Rocking, and then small shifting movements, in and out. The tightness of his body was giving away, he was opening, yielding. Hot, whimpering. His body opening more and more, need unfurling in the pit of his stomach, dark flower blooming. Slick slide out and then the easy glide back in. And again. Sherlock moving into him, inside him, and he was so close, closer than John had thought possible, climbing right up inside of him, his cock pushing into the softness of his organs, rearranging his insides. John’s face pushed against his pillow, clutching at it, at the sheets, the linen summer humid and damp from his panting breath, his sweat, his open mouth.
Moves back against Sherlock, out of instinct and animal hunger. He’s a teenager and this is sex, this is everything, touching and kissing and friction until he feels like he wants to crawl out of his skin with wanting.
He gave John a sudden, winning smile, disconcerting and unsettling from the very solemn boy who had been sitting there before him up to this point. “Well, of course it’s yours,” he said, very nicely. John found his voice rather soothing. “I only mean to look at it a little. May I? Please. John.”
Afterwards they panted, shivering in a way they could not allow themselves to before. They were breathing together, coming back to themselves, coming back to each other. They were in this moment; everything was in this moment, the press of their sweat-slicked bodies against each other, locked together by flesh and metal and their arms around one another, their mouths finding each other in open, trembling kisses, neither of them focused enough to make it anything more refined than rubbing of lips and tongue. And they inhaled each other's breath, shared carbon dioxide and oxygen between them, and each of them thought,
At the end of the night, Victor slips him his number on a napkin. “I had a good time, John. That’s rare for me, especially...well, you know. These days. Let’s do this again sometime.”
” reads the sign in the shape of the panhandle state. John makes Sherlock pull over so that they can get out and take pictures of it: John hanging off of the panhandle in one shot, Sherlock standing next to the sign, arms crossed and scowling in the next.
John whimpered, looking ruined, almost not daring to hope but his expression desperately hopeful nonetheless. His eyes were nearly black with arousal. He was obviously close again, every inch of him, every muscle and nerve straining for orgasm. He could do nothing but shudder and moan weakly with every thrust to his now-oversensitised prostate. Saliva trickled from the corner of his forced-open pink mouth and his eyes rolled heavenward; he was absolutely and completely overwhelmed.
In Glastonbury, in England, Sherlock says, there is one high hill, the Tor, and it's said that this was the place that King Arthur built Camelot.
Hazel began to feel better when they hit the M27, and the feeling only improved the longer that they drove. Highway in front of her, the ocean further and further behind her.
“Of course, I don’t sleep a lot if I can help it,” Sherlock amended. “Sleep is boring when there are so many other things I’d rather be doing. Normal people like you, however, need the rest, and you don’t sleep much because you’re homesick.”
John was lovely like this; hands chained above his head, collar around his neck, wearing the marks of Sherlock’s mouth above and below the collar. He wore Sherlock’s ownership with such natural grace. His mouth parted with soft panting. His lips were full, plush and soft-looking from the force with which he’d been kissed. The hint of red inside, the light tease of tongue, it was like an invitation.
“I came to see you,” Sherlock answered him now. His voice warm and low; it jolted something strange inside of John that made him swallow reflexively. “I enjoyed our little chat...how have you been?”
John considered this. “Yes,” he said, “that I do,” and undid the next button, torturously slowly, smiling to himself.
inside, wet with lube, welcoming and wanting, and Sherlock didn’t stop pushing until he was in all the way, his balls against the curve of John’s arse. His weight on top of John held them both down, the chain kept John’s legs up in place; they were the two of them locked together.
John stopped, stunned, as he often was, by the usage of the saccharine relationship term. Success. Sherlock took a picture.
She leaves them with the promise of tea later in the afternoon if they’ve both been good (although John is not sure what constitutes ‘bad’ behaviour, as shooting at the wall had merely garnered a very severe scolding).
“Well, if you ever want to grow up, you should stay away from Sherlock Holmes,” Bill said decisively. “It’s not just the looks, John. Sherlock does creepy stuff. Everybody knows he did experiments on his playmates. Just ask poor Morwen, she lost
“How badly do you want to come, John?” Sherlock asked him, breath hot in his ear. “You feel so good around me. Your insides are so hot, and every time you get close you squeeze so nicely around my cock. I like the way you shiver. Maybe I’ll keep you like this for another hour, hm? How does that sound?”
“Yes, I’ll take sex tips from you, the man who’s had seven different girlfriends in the span of nine months.” Sherlock’s broad hands fanned out to slide up and down John’s thighs, creating a warm friction peppered with gentle squeezes.
Sherlock’s thumb stroked gently over the inside of his wrist, tracing over the vein - taking his undoubtedly-quickening pulse. John held his breath.
“Oh, you should have heard him. He was a hundred percent young Hollywood. You know I always said he should have concentrated in Theatre. Impersonating people was his favourite thing.” Victor pauses and corrects himself, “Well, you know, after being right.”
“That seat’s taken too,” she said, eyeing him the way one might a bug that had crawled up onto a picnic basket. A particularly large, yucky bug in a Gryffindor scarf. That it did not deserve to wear.
Sherlock scowled at her, and probably thought a lot of rude things, but to his credit, he did not say them. He was only rude with his eyes. His eyes were being downright shocking, and John thought if that look translated into words they would be the type to make his aunt Agatha have one of her famous conniptions.
He can feel the stretch of John's body around two slick fingers; watches, with fascination, the sight of the virginal little hole taking something in for the first time. John whines with discomfort, but no real distress.
he’d built little nests in metal drums in the backyard. In the first set he made a miscalculation and built the kindling up too high, leaned in an inch too close as the flames shot up quick and licked at his face; he remembers the light, the intense heat. It had been an experiment; he was operating underneath controlled conditions, he was most certainly not a budding little arsonist, but this was difficult to explain to the screaming maid who had found him, a lit match in his hand and one brow singed off.
John had been busy at the clinic lately. Winter brought with it influenza season, as well as an endless stream of runny noses, colicky and feverish babies, adults presenting with vague complaints of “not feeling well”, and the stubborn elderly patients that fought him with each inoculation. The clinic was understaffed, more so than usual, as doctors and nurses had yet to develop immunity to the disgusting illnesses that surrounded them daily. As a result John was shackled to long hours of forced overtime, feet plodding up the stairs to 221B after every shift, arriving home full of boring war stories about other people’s bodily fluids.
By the time John made it down, Harry was already seated at the table, jamming breakfast into her mouth. His plate was noticeably empty of bacon, with one sad little half-piece left.
“John!” Hazel said, kneeling in front of him. She did not like the high note that her voice ended upon when she said his name, and she grasped him by his small shoulders to hold him. She was afraid to shake him, because she had heard somewhere that one must not wake a sleepwalker. “John, it’s Mummy, Johnny, darling.”
He looked at himself once again at the mirror and smiled at his reflection. Then he frowned. His hair was
“But you know it’s true,” Bill continued doggedly. “John, here are the facts. You are used to having loads of friends. Holmes is used to having none. You can’t continue on like this. It disrupts the natural order of things! It’s not right. Is that what you want? To be against nature?”
Being off balance like this left him breathless and dizzy, stripped of control and left dependent for stability. Then the old fighting instinct kicked in, to push Sherlock off and regain control, scold him for cheating
“Of course not,” Bill reassured him. “They hate Carl Powers, too. And Sherlock Holmes, of course, but that’s nothing new.”
They play 20 questions with each other, trying to divine each other’s backstories. But it only takes the stranger one question (“Korea?”) to figure out that John is a soldier. A war veteran, in fact. John tells him he was shot in the shoulder to make it interesting, but then later forgets and favors his left leg, feeling the pangs of a phantom injury.
John swore (and it was the most he’d ever sworn - he was raised better than that). He’d landed hard on the pavement, and his body thudded with pain. His palms were skinned and bleeding, with little pebbly bits he had to pick out. His trousers felt sticky and damp at his knees, scratched up gray and dusty on the outside, sore enough to let him know that he’d skinned both knees as well.
John tucks the picture away into his journal for safekeeping. Nearby, two kids are manning a stand that is already taking advantage of the gullibility of tourists.
“John...I know you’re a bit afraid of me and I understand your hesitation,” Sherlock said, in velvety, gentle tones, “but you still answered when I knocked. You were waiting for me.”
It didn’t matter. Little thing was dreaming. She tried not to think about how he’d gotten out of the house. She tried not to think about the idea of her little boy, wandering all alone on a beach at night. He could have been snatched up by a stranger, he could have walked straight into the water. She shuddered.
Sherlock all of thirteen when this story was in the papers, clipping out the pictures of black smoke printed out in flat ink in shades of gray. There was one picture in particular that was quite popular, of an innocuous Shell station, sitting in the bright July sun, while smoke billowed and filled the background. No actual photographs of the fire itself. Sherlock had guessed arson as opposed to natural means, that summer not particularly dry and they had reported a smaller fire extinguished prior to this one. “Death in Grindstone Canyon” read the article in
“John,” Sherlock said again, reaching up for him now, tugging him back down onto the bed. He began to tug at his clothes, unbuttoning his shirt frantically, running his hands over John’s skin as if he were searching him for gunshot wounds.
Sherlock wriggled out, slipping his cock out first and then sliding himself out from between John's legs. While he could have easily stayed inside of John all night, the chain digging into his back would have made it slightly uncomfortable for actual sleep. He unchained John next, grabbed a few Kleenex from next to the bed. He wiped them both up but paid special attention to John, cleaning up the semen on his belly and then in between his legs, unable to help a hiss at the sight of his own cum dripping slowly out of a reddened, used hole, still wet with lube.
Because he was being chased. Something was after him. No time to look over his shoulder. He didn’t dare.
John shakes his head, hair ruffling on the sheets. "On my..." he takes a shuddering breath. "On my dick." He flushes even more, blood filling capillaries in his cheeks, red under softness of skin, response to arousal, to embarrassment. The first time his mouth has formed that word, one little syllable dirty and at once innocent, forged in the heat of John Watson's mouth.
“No...not an animal. I don’t know what it was. It was like a child...but not. It was something else.” Hazel shook her head. “It sounds crazy, I know. And it was...touching him, Tom. I saw it.”
John dropped his head back on the cushion and stared at the ceiling, unable to actually look Sherlock in the eyes with what he was about to say. “Sherlock, either stick another finger in or fuck me, because I’m losing my mind here, and I really can’t wait.”
with Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore is playing on the telly. “Oh, this cheesy old film,” John says, even though he rather likes it.
On Liza’s utter ignorance masquerading as purity: “Don’t kid yourself, kid. She wants it, she’s just too much of an idiot to know what it is that she wants.”
Sherlock could not pinpoint the moment when he fell asleep, when his thoughts slipped gently and blurred into dreams. John’s voice was a murmuring hum in the background, fading. Sherlock’s thoughts slowed and smoothed themselves out.
“Anyway. I come home to our flat one day, and there he is, laid out in the middle of our sitting room floor, face-down and blue. Luckily I knew CPR. Respiratory arrest, not cardiac. Not yet. But if I had been five minutes later, or even one minute later, who knows how long he was down - bastard would have never gotten the chance to meet you and fuck up your life as well as mine.”
“Well. I suppose that’s all right,” said Sherlock. He then reached over to turn down the fire on the cauldron, as he suddenly felt overly warm.
Thank you to all of you who accompanied me on this journey and made it so fun and entertaining along the way!! Your encouragement bolstered me and I'm endlessly grateful for all your support!
