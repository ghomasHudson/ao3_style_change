There was the million-dollar question. He had dealt with one too many entities that did everything out of their own sick and twisted pleasure, for their own entertainment and amusement. How could he, a simple human being, be sure that he would walk away untouched, with his love in his arms, safe at last?
He was internally battling whether he should've asked or not to the celestial being what he wanted for their late lunch, when he was beaten to the conversation. "I do not need to consume food to sustain myself."
Next up is everyone's favourite trickster with a very specific rendition of a specific song that gives a certain Samuel nightmares...
Bobby huffed out a laugh at his disbelief: “How many Arethas do you know? Show some respect! Granted, I thought she’d have better taste. Then,” he added, pointing off in the distance, “there’s old Missouri somewhere over there, she’s knitting Lord knows what for her son and granddaughter. Probably gonna bake you a pie if you swing by. Who else? Oh, Ellen reopened her roadhouse nearby with her husband and we’re all gonna meet there eventually, for your welcoming party. Jo’s here too, off somewhere with Charlie and Kevin.”
Many used it to express gratitude or affection, typically placing their lips on someone else’s cheek for no longer than a handful of seconds. Between romantic or sexual partners the act was used to convey desire, lust, and passion. All of that could be called ‘
That was a recurrent theme, in his and Cas’ relationship: the first time it had happened, was when they met in that barn, after everything that went down in Hell, sparks literally flying in the air as he unleashed part of his power; he had stabbed the angel before he was even able to ask a single question, thanking the countless years of training for his sharp reflexes. And, for the first time in a long while, his body had reacted differently than usual.
Dean was so lost in his own mind, constructing a plan to tell John Winchester what had kept him occupied in the least dangerous way, that he did not realise there was a woman next to Baby. Middle-aged redhead, with her hair wrapped tightly in a bun and a grey suit, she looked at him with disdain in her eyes, as if he was nothing more than a piece of dirt in her way.
“Well, you see…” he began, mouth suddenly drier than the Nevada Desert, unaware of how in the world he was supposed to tell to an All Mighty Being that he was interested. “Every time you don’t get something you tilt your head to the side in the most adorable way possible and honestly it’s not fair!”
“It ain’t your car anymore, Sammy,” Dean said, failing to keep the smile off his face. And, really, who could blame him? He had the love of his life shirtless and on top of him, while simultaneously he was embarrassing his annoying little brother.
He knew, logically, that the sight in front of him was real, that he was there, in his arms, alive and human and as well as one in his position might have been. He was breathing, and his heart was beating, and his eyes were open. And the people that surrounded them were real: Rowena, in her red dress, always so put together and curated to the last detail, as she looked down at them with concern and hope; Eileen, watching them carefully as she held onto Sam’s old and ragged flannel, almost as if she needed to ground herself, the magnitude of everything that had just happened too much; Sam, whose hair definitely needed to be trimmed down, worrying over him like the giant moose he truly was, his eyes widened as he checked both him and Castiel for injuries; Jack, wearing hand me downs mixed with his own clothes, in the most Winchester way possible, as he crouched down to help as best as he could with his human strength, completely foregoing the supernatural abilities in order to feel all of the emotions he’d have to forget to be a celestial being.
Dean wondered how he would react at the news: one thing was for Dean to sacrifice himself, giving his own life up for Castiel’s; another was putting something that was so fundamentally Cas’, his angelic grace, his very being, up for debate. He remembered all those years prior, when the angels had fallen and when he had become mortal, a shell of who he used to be.
And for the first time in forever, he felt like he was doing something right. Like something good might finally happen. Like he was on the right path.
They had work to do and Cas knew it very well. Mom had passed into the alternate dimension with the Devil and they had to rescue her! And there was the Spawn to also deal with. Their work was far from done. Yet Castiel simply laid there, sleeping and unresponsive.
he asked himself while looking at the papers and maps in front of him. It was a suicide mission, especially if done alone, but he had no other choice. This creature had been killing left and right, breaking every possible trail and pattern it might have used. Once was a Mexican girl of 19, then an African American man of 66, a suburban soccer mom who drove a minivan. Nothing clicked, nothing made sense. The only thing they had in common was the weirdest markings left on the floor, next to where their corpses were found. They were scorched on the ground, shaped so that they resembled feathers on wings. No book or old papyrus had any input on what that might mean. And, since he could call no one, he did what he did best: planned a battle and prayed to whoever might’ve listened that he wasn’t going to die that day.
“Well, then,” he said, removing almost painfully from their tight embrace, “If you need me, you can pray to me and I will be able to hear you.” Not many prayed directly to him anymore, humans choosing to take a direct and bold route that lead to an empty chair nowadays. But Castiel doubted he could miss the Hunter’s voice ringing in his ears if it did happen.
I… I was joking! There is no need for the glowing eyes! Dean. Dean, please, hold your husband back. Please. Mine is only mindless teasing.
“Are you trying to tell us that every single angel and demon ever killed is back on Earth?” he eventually asked, almost looking pained to do so.
“Heya Sammy!” he exclaimed, unsure of what to do. He knew that, if he got outside of the blood inscriptions on the floor or even messed them slightly, they would have to start all over, as Rowena had yelled at them multiple times to not get inside until everything was ready. And he also knew that now that he had grabbed the first ingredient, he couldn’t put it down without ruining his chances at the spell.
Dean didn’t know if it was his second nature at this point, or if it was his own way at showing affection, but he had discovered, back when Sammy was a toddler, that food was one of his love languages. He took so much pride in the knowledge that someone he cared about could enjoy something he had cooked. And, after years on the road with only take out and quick microwavable meals in tiny dirty motel rooms, the bunker’s kitchen had been a blessing.
He wasted no time in linking their hands together, in placing the ring on the calloused finger of the hunter’s left hand, in closing the distance between them.
He felt like he had drowned on solid earth, just as all those years prior when he had been shoved out of Hell, the first time they met.
“JACK!” he yelled, clutching at his chest as he tried to will his heart to go back at a human speed, “What did we say about knocking?”
“Sweetheart!” Dean lamented, dropping his head in the palm of his hands to hide his blushing cheeks away from Castiel’s gaze. That cosmic wavelength had a way of making Dean flustered like a teenager dealing with their first crush, an ability that he used and abused whenever they were alone. It was Dean’s Achilles Heel, his very personal Trojan Horse.
Still, Dean felt the nerves clutch his stomach the more he thought about what had just happened. He had been in the Empty for no longer than half an hour, chatting amicably with an entity that could have easily killed him without a second thought, but he didn’t really know how much time had passed in the real world.
Dean knew that he was being a coward, yet he couldn’t bring himself to care. If he remained still, unmoving, the moment would draw out longer than it should’ve, just like everything else when it came to his and the angel’s relationship. Longing gazes that went on for ages, casual touches that lingered on the excessive side, a hand on his own forehead when the angel was healing him and another on the angel’s cheek when he was looking into his eyes, assessing that everything was normal and alright, even for a brief moment. Those were fixed points in the equation, as Sam loved to tease him on from time to time.
And sure enough, there they were. Sam and Jack, two demonic children, carrying a dead body. He desperately wanted to believe that there was something good about the kid, but he just couldn’t. Not when he saw his biological father in him, not when he saw Castiel in his kindness. That kid had gotten a close look at Cas’ soul, closer than Dean ever would, closer than he could now.
Or perhaps he had already realized it and was trying to soften the blow, for whatever reason. The Angel had left twenty minutes ago, claiming to go and find some other books that might’ve helped them. After all, Dean’s library didn’t have much on demons and the Bible the motel gave each room didn’t exactly came with an exorcism instruction manual. He had simply zapped out, leaving Dean alone with his thought that turned darker and darker by the second.
I’m not here to complain about the wedding that could’ve been, and would’ve been awesome, if I got free reins. But, at least I threw on my own the bachelor’s party and that was lit. On fire. And we did need firefighters afterwards, otherwise the building would’ve burnt down. And I know what you might think: "Were the firefighters planned?"
was the wrong one. He was, after all, the messy son, the least favorite, the fuck up, the one who didn’t get the proper connection between point A and point B. His leads were all wrong, his research method was laughable and, hell, even the way he decapitated Vamps wasn’t proper or efficient!
“You don’t get it, Sam. I don’t care about the risk, not anymore and definitely not about this. I haven’t in a while, but now it’s for a different reason. I know this is going to work, it has to! And I don’t give a single flying fuck about dying, because I cannot fathom living in a world where Cas’ dead. The Empty took him from me, I didn’t even have the time to tell him I loved him back, that he was gone forever! I had to stay right here and watch the man I love get taken away from me, after years of keeping my mouth shut because I couldn’t believe he felt the same and because I couldn’t let myself risk his friendship and because I was afraid of everything. So, pardon me for trying to get him back.”
Except that, there was a way. He had fought and bleed and died to arrive where he was, in the arms of his Angel.
He felt the way Cas’ hand moved downwards, going to rest at his lower back, both basking in each other’s presence.
Castiel had absolutely no idea of what he was supposed to do, and so he decided to follow the Hunter’s lead, pushing his mouth slowly against his and savouring the feeling.
"BULLSHIT!" he screamed at the angel, jumping up from his sitting position and moving closer to the other man.
During the drive back, Dean chose to remain silent, focused entirely on the road, even though there were nobody else but them, his jaw clenched so tightly that it hurt. Sam had tried to talk to him about what had happened, to understand why he was acting so lost, as if they had no way of winning anymore, but Dean couldn’t speak. How could he, when all he truly wanted to do was drink until his head stopped working and until his heart stopped aching? How could he talk about it, when all that would come out of his mouth would be strangled cries of agony at the knowledge that he was alone, away from the person he truly loved and that, by some miracle, apparently loved him back?
“The price was my life,” he explained, tuning out the insistent knocking and the faltering of the seal, unable to withstand the blunt force of Death’s vengeful path. All that mattered in that moment, were the green eyes that bore into his very being, seeing him and recognising him and loving him. All that mattered was
“Listen, Castor," Dean was aware that that wasn't his name, but sounded rather similar and he was way too preoccupied to care, "I literally have no fucks to give right now about you or the hunt. Where the fuck did you leave my car?”
They had officially lost everything. He had officially lost the reason he got up in the morning, his best friend, his Angel. And He had to answer, Chuck had to give him a sign that it was all going to come back to what it used to. He had to, both he and Sammy had fought too hard and too long and they deserved a break, they deserved happiness finally. He deserved happiness, even if it killed him, even if Castiel would never hold his hand or stay the night just talking about nothing with him.
Castiel could not comprehend her second thought, but he assumed the hunter knew what she was talking about. Nevertheless, he willed the poor girl's feet to hurt a little less, making her situation more bearable.
Despite his initial rigidness, he had loosened up, figuratively and literally: he seemed more comfortable around Dean, asking questions and challenging him, and he had also loosened up his tie, leaving it to hang somehow awkwardly around his neck, revealing the muscles and the veins and the flesh.
Dean was done praying, he knew better than that. There was no one in the Universe who could get him Castiel back, nor anyone wanted to. No one had ever listened to him, except the one good Angel that was now no more.
Dean braced himself for the inevitable pain that was sure to come any minute now, his cheeks already stinging at the memory. He knew better than to cry, than to break down like the pathetic son of a bitch he was. And he most definitely knew best than to let himself go when there was company around. Years spent with his no-nonsense father and then in Hell had left their imprint on him, teaching him their lessons.
"Got it. Black eyes: maybe stay and fight if you have the higher ground. Other freaky colors, run to the opposite direction as fast as you can. Do they have any correlation to any of these demons Buffy had to kill in order to save the world in almost every season finale?" he asked smugly, pretty sure the angel wasn't going to know how to reply.
He also looked sinful and worthy of eternal damnation, but that was a recurrent appearance for the former angel, at least to Dean’s eyes.
They had been driving for a while now, Castiel contemplating whatever as Dean looked for a place to eat. Having been in town for the past two weeks, he did have a pretty vast knowledge of its diners and fast-food chains, but he did not know what the angel liked. Probably something fancy and posh.
The angel nodded slowly, before loudly sighing and exclaiming: “I can take you back to your accommodation, if that would make you feel better. Or I could simply remove the memories of this conversation in order for you to return to your regular world, which would be more preferable from my point of view."
“Because after everything that you’ve done, you owe us, you son of a bitch!” he couldn’t keep the voice as steady as he wanted it to be, but he still hoped it would convey his message upstairs. He needed to be heard, he needed help to fix this mess, he had been a good little soldier all of his life, he knew he had earned this. At least this. “So you get your ass down here and you make this right, right here and right now,” he kept on commanding.
His had been an incredibly idiotic idea, but at least they knew that the Spawn couldn’t be killed easily. And at least now they had another issue to worry about, effectively putting his mind off of Cas and Mom’s fate for a short while.
A loud crashing never meant good things in his experience, not when he had to deal with monsters on the daily in his life, rude and loud ones that liked to create a mess with their inhuman strength, and definitely not when his father would come back in the middle of the night, smelling like cheap beer and cigarettes, uncaring if he woke him up as he slandered around their tiny, rented motel room. Sam never woke up during those nights and Dean thanked whoever was upstairs for letting him be a heavy sleeper, safe and sound on his bed. He would then keep watch under his own covers, making sure his breathing wasn’t too loud as he waited for his father to go to sleep, those few times when he actually stayed with them instead of leaving them in the middle of nowhere. And only when the old man had taken the sack, he would let himself relax, falling into a nightmare filled sleep that drained him to no end.
"Hi! What can I get you?" she asked, and the practised smile on her lips turned from slightly fake to one of relief as Castiel's work went into fruition. He could not help himself from smiling back, earning a curious glare from the hunter, who then began ordering for both of them, despite Castiel's complaints. He did not particularly bother listening to the order, conscious that it would not matter.
And, for as much as Sammy pouted that their life was way too erratic and unpredictable to keep an animal, he knew deep down that this was a step into the right path. They had saved the world for the last time. They could finally write their own story, instead of following along to some lamely written garbage.
But he had to go overboard, the fucking Angel. He blinked repeatedly at him, badly attempting to wink and adorably scrunching his nose up as he did so. “I thought this human mannerism would be easier to perform” he admitted defeated, wrinkling his brows with an upset expression.
He turned his head as much as he could, his feet still locked in place, unmoving, able to see Cas’ face all around him as the Shadow just laughed from their throne, undoubtedly enjoying his spectacle of pain and regret. “You should see his memories, all the times he thought you didn’t love him. Oh, just how perfect it was! It’s a shame that angels and demons don’t relieve their lives when they’re here, asleep, I’d have so much to torture him with!”
“It’s alright, my beloved,” Castiel continued as another loud knock ruptured their bubble, their moment of happiness and sorrow. Nevertheless, Castiel tried to reassure his beloved hunter, finally asking the secret question he had kept silent for too long. The question he was dying keeping and the question he was dying just to have it answered. “Will you marry me?”
He didn’t know how to tell Matt that he couldn’t tell the difference between shampoo and conditioner. For all Metatron inserted into his brain, all that Dean talked about various side-jobs he used to have and Sam talked about lore, no one had ever told him how to take care of his body; he had to go trial and error style, ie seeing how long he needed to wait until a shower was necessary and how long until he could go without eating with his depleting grace before he felt dizzy. So, no, he wasn’t mad at Matt for asking this, but he couldn’t exactly say out loud that he used the cheapest store-bought brand and didn’t think twice about it, he had other things to worry about.
“What the hell do you mean, Cas? You help every damn time we need information, collecting and searching for lore on our cases, you keep me and Sam from ripping each other to pieces. Hell, when you were fully human you helped me and Sam while working at Gas-N-Sip.”
“What?” Dean questions, not hearing Cas from where he was. Cas could see Dean was still wearing his case clothing; his jacket was splattered with blood and his face looked muddy and not the most pleasing to look at, but still Dean. Cas wondered why he hadn’t gotten cleaned up yet, and furthermore if he was the reason why. Leaving that train of thought, Cas motions to his head, his arms feeling unpleasantly heavy even though they should be lighter with all the blood loss from the djinn.
“I apologize, Dean.” Cas never knew John Winchester, and he was happy for that. He had learned how he had treated Dean as a child and into his adulthood; if Cas would have met him only one of them would have walked out of that conversion alive, and since John never believed in angels he never would have had an angel blade. Cas knew who would have left bloody and vindicated. “But John never felt like he had a son, so he never thought of himself as a father, and the same for Chuck. That’s where they went wrong.
With all that—Cas’s fallen angel history, unable to really focus on anything other than trying not to let the apocalypse happen, raising a child after he came back from the dead, and wondering if his best friend was in love with him as much as he was—Cas decided to skip the introduction into his horrible haircare life and let the “professional” do what he did best.
“Cas,” Dean growled this time, looking like he did when he was high off endorphins from a hunt. Cas could only manage a responding “Dean” before the Righteous Man himself crossed the last few inches of space and—
“Our kid,” Cas snarked back, not having the energy to wonder why Dean and him both said “our” and still Dean looked taken aback by it, “who was also God for a substantial amount of time.”
“I think that’s enough for tonight, kiddo. Your dad wants you.” Dean stood up from the floor, allowing Jack to whine for a moment before turning Dean’s hair color back to normal and ambled over to Cas. Cas reached down and grabbed Jack to hold him on his hip; he looked back to see Dean was still staring at him.
They weren’t going anywhere fancy; Dean had asked earlier if Cas would like to go to the bar tonight, it being happy hour and a celebration of a case that Sam and Eileen had just gotten back from. It had been a particularly large nest on the East coast, so they had met a few other hunters there to help with the mission. Cas had been surprised that Dean didn’t tag along until the day after Sam and Eileen had left.  Dean had entered the kitchen with Jack hot on his heels saying they were going to the double feature he had promised Jack. Dean’s hair had been a mixture of different colors of purple and Jack had such a wide grin on his face Cas was scared it would get stuck there.
Dean paused for a moment, and Cas thought he had done something wrong (his brain currently wasn’t tracking anything except Dean’s body so someone may need to assist him) when Dean pulled at Cas’s curls again and a heavier, deeper moan responded to the action. Cas felt a smile form from Dean’s lips before he teased Cas’s mouth open with his tongue with no opposition from Cas.
If Cas had even the inkling of hope that something would shift or change between them after Dean saved him, it was a bitter fantasy by the time he was up again. Dean doesn’t make a mention of that night; Cas would think it was purely his imagination and additive of the poison that conjured that scene in his bedroom, and to make Cas question if he should go back for more venom, if not when he awoke for the second time and saw a chair pulled up to the side of his bed and his hair in more disarray than when he woke the first time. When he first journeyed out of his room Dean was nowhere to be seen, and Cas surmised that he didn’t say those two words that he promised himself to keep stored within his chest cavity as Dean wasn’t around to kick him out.
“Hi, Cas.” The room was surprisingly not harboring an awkward tension between them, but an anticipated feeling; neither of them knew what was exactly going to happen. “Did—did something happen to Jack or…”
Dean finally stood and grabbed his knife once more. “Then there is your answer, Cas, to how you help around here besides mundane work, though we all know that you don’t have any obligation to help to prove your worth; you’ve earned this rest a thousand times over.” He looked at Cas again, but this time Cas could see his walls crumbling down for the moment, a fragile second in which nothing else mattered except an understanding that Dean had heard what Cas said and that he couldn’t respond to it yet. Was never taught how to respond. “You say we are both Jack’s fathers. That means when I am away, you take care of him when I can’t, and vice versa. It’s one of the most important jobs to have, do you hear me? Being here for him and us makes you worth everything.”
Cas was, pardon his language, fucking estatic that Dean was going to be gone for two weeks; it gave him time to figure out how his hair had turned purple on him somewhere between the shower and the mirror (Cas had protected The Fish while they first started walked on land and yet he was in consternation about this new development). He had his hair hidden under a beanie cap, which would have been great except it was mid-August and therefore Dean had thought he was getting sick.
“And what is one of the things that… you want?” Dean asked, letting the last part of the sentence settle on his lips like a prayer. Dean caught Cas’s eyes like a lure baiting its catch, and Cas was oh too willing to bite.
Cas nodded. “Of course.” His voice had turned quieter, a melodic tone which only showed when he talked to Jack. Some days he still couldn’t believe that Jack had come back, that he wanted to come back and live with Cas and Dean and Sam in the bunker when he could do anything else. Cas had asked Jack that question once, a few weeks after Jack had come back; they were in Cas’s garden, a small plot of land above ground behind the bunker which he had tiled and picked the rocks out of before planting a few vegetables. Jack had been watering the plants, sunlight streaming through his hair and setting a few of his blond highlights aflame as he exclaimed about all the different bugs he could see in the raspberry bush. It wasn’t a question Cas had thought he would pose that day, but it slipped out.
“I capisce,” Cas responded too late, the door to the Bunker already closing behind Dean’s fading form.
Jack smiled. “Okay, but I am counting.” Cas watched him count the time under his breath as he left to go to the car before turning and making his way back to Matt. “Yes?”
Cas took the manilla folder from Sam’s outstretched hand, opening it to see a djinn case; currently, there were three victims, none of their bodies found yet and all within a few days of one another. It felt hopeful, for a djinn case, and Cas promised to call if anything else came up and vice versa. He rounded up Jack before leaving, engulfing him in both his arms and his wings, and gave him a kiss on the forehead. “Be good, okay. Listen to Uncle Sam and don’t freak out Dean too much with your new hair.”
“I—,” Cas retried once more, licking his lips and watching as Dean followed the motion. Cas felt a heady feeling coarse through him, wondering if he had been wrong about Dean’s rejection of him, and realized that for the first time he wanted to be wrong.
Cas leaned forward onto Dean’s body, laying Dean onto his back despite him being the one with knowledge of how these things went, but Cas couldn’t care at the moment. All he felt was an all consuming want, and for once he would indulge. Cas pulled away from Dean’s mouth, breaking the kiss and allowing Dean to suck in a lungful of air while Cas explored other areas he had been eyeing forever, his hands surprisingly still despite his pulse lodged in his throat. He sucked underneath Dean’s jawline, eliciting a delicious groan from Dean and another hair pull to bring him back to eye level.
Settling in the passenger seat of Baby, Cas heard a chime from his phone. He pulled it out of his (very small and unusable) back pocket and unlocked it. He realized it was from Claire, a photo of Jack carrying around a container about as heavy as him of ice cream. His face was smeared with chocolate, and Cas mentally rewrote his action plan of how to get him to bed with a couple of liters of sugar crammed into his body before he remembered that he would be staying the night with Claire since she was watching him and lived a few hours away.
“Can I get an Hennessey, one stout, an IPA, and for my shy but devastatingly handsome friend here—” Dean nudged Cas, leading off the sentence with a silent question as to what he wanted. Cas would have liked to ask if he could order a ‘what did you just say’ to the comment of him being handsome, but he couldn’t seem to even manage that as his brain short-circuited for a moment. Dean cleared his throat, and Cas’s brain thankfully started to manage neurotransmitters to his mouth once more.
Cas closed his mouth, realizing he had caused more harm to Dean than he thought. He never meant to hurt Dean in any way; his mission from Heaven (though now not taking orders from them) had been to protect Dean. He needed to do better.
“Now,” Matt started, turning Jack around in the chair to look straight at the mirror situated in front next to all the hair products, “styles? Do you want to leave it longer? Just a trim so it’s healthy, or something else?” Jack’s response to that question was usually a very well known head tilt and squinty eyes; Cas had learned that, for all the time Jack had been God and needed to make tough decisions in a cutthroat manner, when he wasn’t on the clock managing all humanity, he was more reticent about his answers. But this time Cas could see the proverbial light bulb light up instantly, and he could see Jack smiling by way of his reflection in the mirror.
Blowdryer being hung up, Jack waited impatiently while Matt unclasped the cape and then bounded off the chair, running over to where Cas sat against the back wall to show off his new haircut.
Dean watched Cas for a moment, and then returned to his carrot halfway cut and the soup currently in the making, something which meant more to Cas than Dean could ever imagine.
With Cas’s brain finally calling the shots now instead of … other areas, he realized that he had almost kissed Dean. Dean Winchester, The Righteous Man, his best friend, and—and the love of his life, every life. He both wanted to smite the people who stalled their (probably not little) makeout session, but it also allowed him finally realize how much Dean made him feel, and what exactly he wanted.
Cas hadn’t asked for jeans, since he a few handed down from Sam and hemmed beyond belief, but Dean insisted, so he wore them. He had commented to Dean, once he put them on and walked into the kitchen to show him, that they were tighter around the thigh area, and then promptly made a note not to say that again as it caused Dean to choke on his beer that had just taken a sip of and cough out a common phrase of ‘fuck’.
“Yeah, Cas?” Cas felt the breath from Dean’s mouth touch his lips, and Cas felt that this feeling should be illegal; he would do anything to continue this emotion, a thrumming, all inducing want that he would fight wars for. Cas finally understood why some kings had. Their eyes met once more, and Cas realized that Dean now stood in front of him, backing him against the wall and powerless to Dean Winchester.
Dean scoffed. “We both know that is bullshit. John never cared about me, and Chuck never cared about you.” Dean picked up the knife again, fidgeting with the remembrance of John Winchester.
“Hey!” Jack tried to look affronted, but broke the act by smiling. “Do you think Dean will like it?”
“That.” Dean’s eyes tore into Cas’s own. “That wasn’t your fault. It was my own. And you help here now; I see how you, you know," he gestures to Cas' body," being here, around, affects us, and that includes Jack. You are a shield for him while he grows up and you’re teaching him to be someone who will be kind to this world. You love him.”
Castiel tries to ignore Meg’s words, he does not know what Dean really thinks although deep down he knows that Dean can’t love him as he does. Castiel doesn’t turn away his eyes from Meg until he’s in front of her and stops walking.
Rowena’s in the bunker with Sam and Dean and they’re talking. They’re all standing around the big table next to the stairs.
Everyone looks at Michael when his eyes emanate light, he tries to open the book with his power, his hand stretched out towards the book, the latter also lights up, he struggles but nothing happens, not even an archangel like him can open the book.
Dean smiles. He and Castiel seem a little closer, Castiel’s heart is about to explode with emotion, as well as Dean’s.
Sam concludes the message and turns off the phone. Dean approaches and hands him one of the beer, then he leans on the table.
Sam looks up and sees Chuck standing in front of them. The others do the same. Michael turns to look at him in the face, he is the closest to Chuck. Chuck looks at them all, then stops his eyes on his son.
Jack closes his eyes and lights up completely, we see a blinding light. When it goes down by his side we see black smoke taking the form of Amara.
Dean is sitting on a chair, Sam is leaning against the table where their initials are engraved and they’re waiting for Rowena who should arrive at any moment. Dean has a glass in his hand and drinks something that is obviously not water. Sam looks at Dean, he’s always worried.
Jack and Dean are sitting at the table reading books trying to find a way to stop Chuck. Michael is walking back and forth, he’s also consulting some books.
The blade is polished in Lucifer’s hands when he kills Gabriel, his body resting on his brother, then he extracts the archangel blade. Gabriel falls to the ground, dead. Lucifer is heading for the battlefield now. Quickly we come back to Chuck who has two angels in his hand, these two angels are suspended in the air by the darkness (as if it was a black smoke, clearer than the demons’ one). Chuck directs two angel blades to them, stabs them, then their bodies light up and fall to the ground.
Dean looks around for the last time, he doesn’t see anyone but now he knows what to do. He knows what he wants to do.
We’re in Dean’s room when he comes in through the door quickly and walks up to his dresser. He opens the top drawer and isolated in a corner there’s Dean’s jacket, folded perfectly. The jacket he wore during Castiel’s death, the jacket he wore when Castiel told him he loved him. The jacket he was wearing when Castiel left his bloody handprint on him. Cas’ blood. Dean takes his jacket and smiles a bit. He stays a few seconds in his room to think, then he hears steps approaching, moves away from his thoughts. Sam enters the room after knocking once.
We’re back on Jack, Sam and Dean. Dean watches the waiters at the bar serving people at the tables, Sam is looking at some kids riding their bicycles. They’re all alive, they’re all back.
Dean walks to the diner. Sam is shocked by Dean’s answer. It’s definitely not what he expected, but Sam realizes that Dean is worse off than he thought. He’s trying very hard to punish himself, but he’s also trying to keep his mind busy, distracted, because if he lets himself go for even a second, he’ll collapse. And Sam knows that. Sam follows Dean into the diner.
Sam pulls the blade out of Lucifer’s back and now he’s lying on the ground. Gabriel looks at Sam. Sam’s jaw is tight.
Sam remains silent to think, Dean continues to browse the book. Sam observes the room around him and notices a spell bowl on a shelf next to some books. His expression changes completely, it’s like a light bulb went on.
Sam, Eileen, Cas and Dean enter the bunker by the armored door (in this order). Dean closes the door behind him. They climb down the stairs. Sam places the bag, which he carried on his shoulder, on the table (the one with their initials).
The camera is fixed on the book when a door opens and Death enters the room. She walks up to it, then stops and turns to Sam and Dean.
Dean takes a sip of beer and gives Sam his back, he’s trying to leave, get out of this conversation, but Sam still insists.
She’s worried, she’s playing with the rings between her fingers, she does not wear a wedding ring. Both Sam and Dean notice that.
Dean is sitting on the chair, he’s focused on what he’s reading. It’s surrounded by a lot of Men Of Letters books. He flips through a few pages, and he frowns. He’s looking for something. His right hand is bandaged because of the burn that Meg caused him. Sam enters the room and approaches Dean.
In the distance we see Sam and Dean showing the badges to some cops who let them pass. They head towards the boy.
Dean gives Sam a pat on his chest and gets out of the car, Sam stays a few seconds inside, sighs and gets out. He doesn’t know how to approach with Dean, how to convince him. Dean also seems too cheerful. They walk along the driveway. Sam rings the bell of the house, a woman comes to open the door.
Sam looks in front of him. Jack is standing, the wind in his hair. Chuck turns to look at him, lets Sam, Dean and Castiel go back to breathing. Around and behind Jack, angels and demons still fight against the monsters of Purgatory, Jack begins to walk towards Chuck. Castiel and Dean get up off the ground, now the two of them and Sam are on Chuck’s left, holding each other up. On their faces there’s some blood and some wounds but they’re good. Chuck takes a few steps towards Jack, there are a lot of bodies on the ground around them.
Michael is next to Lucifer in front of him, Gabriel next to Raphael while behind them angels and demons fight against Chuck.
Sam takes the plate with the bacon off the counter and puts it on the table. Dean stares at it, then shakes his head.
Sam raises his head and in front of him there’s Gabriel who smiles and then snaps his fingers. Sam looks at himself and touches his stomach, his arm, everything is as it should be, nothing is broken and there is no blood. Sam looks at Gabriel and smiles back, Gabriel helps him to get up while the music presses.
Before the episode starts there is the classic recap of the season but with a normal song, as if it was an ordinary episode.
Dean raises his head and looks at Jack and then at Sam, he’s broken, he scrapes his throat and then he talks.
Now everyone is fighting. No one is behind, everyone is busy. No one waits any longer for Chuck to kill angels and demons to step forward and fight against him. They’re all against everyone. Samandriel fights a monster. Balthazar fights two monsters. Everyone has an angel blade in their hands. Ruby, Gadreel, Crowley, Abaddon (who’s having fun), everybody is fighting against something. Castiel is also fighting a monster, his powers are diminishing more and more so there’s not much he can do but fight with the blade. After a few strokes, Castiel stabs the monster with the blade.
Dean’s face was flushed, his lips thoroughly swollen and slick with spit. Cas knew he looked just as debauched, if not worse, and he felt a shudder roll through his body like a thunderstorm, his body reacting more and more and his brain losing any coherent thought the longer he feasted on Dean.
“Ready to go?” Dean’s head peered around the corner of Cas’s door. Cas’s eyes involuntarily drew toward him by way of the mirror he was in front of, and he quickly snatched his attention back to his own attire before Dean caught him staring. He gave himself a onceover for the last time (fifth time, but who was counting?), checking that the gel in his hair was indeed keeping his curls from falling forward into his eyes (he really needed a haircut, but his extra cash he had lying around had mysteriously disappeared and Dean said it would be a few weeks before Charlie could hotwire more money into their account), before turning around to face Dean.
His confession ended up taking place in Dean’s Man Cave, an old western playing in the background. Cas entered the room with a bowl of popcorn, even though he wasn’t hungry, so he could do something with his hands. His speech was memorised in the back of his head but he didn’t know how well it would do in the real life setting. His emotions tended to fluctuate around Dean. Everything tended to fluctuate. Dean looked up and, when seeing Cas, grabbed the remote to turn the volume down, a low rumble playing in the background like a crackling fire during the holidays. Cas felt bad for interrupting as Dean was dressed down to comfort and seemed sated, but he promised himself tonight, so he steeled his nerves and stopped next to the couch.
As Jack went into his room, Cas finally took stock of what he was wearing; a squeeze of his pants fabric told him he was wearing Dean’s sweats as well as a cotton tee shirt. As he went to take off the shirt and into one of his own sweaters, the junction at his left elbow pulsed in a dull, rhythmic pain for a moment before fading out. Cas looked down to see he had missed the bandage around the inside of his forearm and elbow from where he supposed the needle for his blood “donation” had been.
Dean gave Cas a chase kiss on the check. “I know angel, but my point still stands.” Cas gave a hmph noise and slotted that argument away for when he was in a better mindset to argue with Dean, preferably when he had a shirt on so he wasn’t so distracting.
"Didn't think so" he said then, after having lost 10 years due to stress, "You though can see this as a date, if you want. A WORK DATE!" he said all too quickly, correcting his mistake with a non-threatening situation. "Yup, cause I'm totally straight as an arrow!"
The hunter became enraged, he leapt up to his feet and looked at Castiel with a bewildered expression. His breathing became uneven, his heart rate sped up in a non-pathological way and his movements became erratic. “Hell no!” he yelled, his blown wide eyes betraying his fear. Castiel did not know how to deal with the hunter in such a state, so he simply waited for him to calm and gather his mind. It was not a situation that demanded his immediate intervention, unlike a similar one that had happened earlier, and the hunter managed to control himself.
,” his mind said, a cold rush going down his back at the prospect of everything that might go wrong with his words.
But, most importantly, I did unspeakable things with the man, Dean Winchester himself, during the short time he was a demon. Triplets all over the States mourn your monogamy, my friend. As do a few of us.
“What are you talking about?” he asked as a million questions began to fill his brain, the task at hand forgotten over curiosity. How come she knew who he was? He was a nobody hunter, his father was the one that people recognized. He’d still be no one when he died in a death monster related, most likely in a couple of years, while John Winchester carried on his legacy. Perhaps she knew him in relation to his father, he wondered as she laughed at him.
"Since you are conducting the vehicle, I would claim that it would be appropriate to leave you to choose the destination."
“…I forgot to mention,” Castiel continued, punctuating each word with a kiss or a small bite that he was sure would leave a mark, “your brother helped me today and he and Eileen are staying here for the night. I supposed it would be alright with you, right?” he then asked rhetorically, directly against Dean’s lips, before ducking down and capturing them with his, not giving him the time to answer even if he wanted to.
Suddenly, an idea made its way through Dean’s brain. “You know what?” he asked conspiratorially, leaning away from the Impala and moving to stand in between Cas’ open legs, placing his hands on his hips once again.
“I’m perfectly fine” he claimed, assuming a defensive stance and crossing his arms. But despite how much he tried to maintain composure, his body betrayed him: he was slightly shaking, right leg bouncing and eyes unfocused. Mastering all the kindness he could, Castiel softly spoke to him, while maintaining an authoritative tone: “No, you are not. Your vitals suggest you need to sleep in order to properly function.”
The entire situation felt rather ridiculous: he was a celestial being, a soldier of Heaven that was born on the second day, and was now tied by a strange bundle of fabric to a chemically moved, mechanically engined vehicle, next to a noisy and sarcastic hunter. He prayed his brothers and sisters were not watching, otherwise, he would have never '
They had discovered, on the many nights they spent awake, that in giving him new taste receptors to make his life on Earth more human despite still being an angel in all his glory, Jack had also activated some of Jimmy’s old nerves that had gone dormant, useless to the purpose of a vessel. Amongst those nerves, lying somewhere, was the fact that he was a ticklish man, which translated into a now ticklish angel.
His first big gig alone, completely alone. And it was pretty big. He just wanted to hear those words, once in his life before it was too late. And, in their line of work, any day could've been too late. He hoped that maybe, since he had worked so hard, that might’ve been the time.
He thought about his own room, how it was one of the biggest ones in the bunker, with an ensuite and with enough space to comfortably fit a king-sized bed. They’d have to go mattress shopping in the near future, in between all the countless conversations they’d have to have eventually, but, for now, Dean couldn’t help himself but dream, allowing himself to do something he had considered forbidden for too long.
He had fucked up with Castiel’s life for the last time, perhaps their dungeon would be the last thing he would see before getting dragged downwards. Either way, he deserved the punishment, whatever it might be.
Not physically, at least. He could feel the rebar pierce his skin, simultaneously holding him together long enough while breaking him apart, but it didn’t hurt. It was almost like a comforting presence, a reminder that his job was done and that he could rest now.
“All of them?” he asked, panicking a little inside. He had thought that his work was done, for good, but it the Empty was now, well,
None of them had been sure about what would happen once the spell was completed. Rowena had only theorised of different possible scenarios, but there was only one way to find out whether or not she was right.
Understanding it might be useful, she had claimed, but he found no use of that. He didn’t need to know why he couldn’t remember shit from time to time, or why he felt the way he did. What he needed was a way to be normal, in his own fucked up definition of normality, but that wasn’t possible, so he retorted in the oldest trick in his book, keeping his eyes dry and his mouth shut.
he said, putting emphasis on his words by making the lights flicker a little as he spoke. If he didn't know better, Dean would've rushed to grab the salt from his bag. "You would most definitely need one, which I am not going to procure you and I am most certain you cannot retrieve one by yourself."
he had claimed in the softest voice possible, blushing into oblivion, all the while Dean stared dumbfounded. Perhaps it was the lack of processing his brain did at the moment that delayed irrevocably the realization.
"Shapeshifter." He had said the first thing that came into his mind, mentally assessing the details to make the lie more plausible.
Some words of Castiel had bothered him profoundly, yet he could not understand which, and therefore could not apologise for those. The hunter had left their conversation in the vehicle abruptly and motioned him to follow inside the small red building. The large glass windows showed a clear view of the few humans inside, which were all doing the same activity with different variations of food.
Yet there was no trace of him anywhere. Dean was so sure that he was up there, he could feel his presence in the air itself. There was no way Jack would have let him in the Empty and there was no way his feelings were wrong.
He couldn’t believe his eyes as he did: there he was, propped on the hood of the Impala, newly shined with some heavenly magic, with his legs dangling off the floor. He was lacking his usual trench coat, but Dean kept religiously a clean one in the car since that horrible day with Billie and the Empty, just in case he needed to hold it while he cried and begged for the pain to stop, and he was sure that it was still there, tucked in the corner of the hood where he had left it before his last hunt. Cas had a contemplative look on his face, but his expression was serene and tranquil, as a few little bees flown in front of him. He was at peace.
Dean was already moving to grab his jacket from a nearby chair, where he had left it before starting the rite to get into the Empty, but Eileen stopped him, placing a hand over his own and squeezing once, tight. “I’ll go with you too,” she said, looking Dean in the eye with overwhelming understanding and affection.
And so he drove, angry with the world and angry with himself, ‘cause he couldn’t stand up for himself, ‘cause he was useless, ‘cause he could drive himself into a ditch and no one would care. Those fights between his father and brother were proof enough of that, ‘cause no matter how many times he’d break them apart, they’d already been clawing at each other’s throats in minutes, ‘cause he never did a good job in the first place, ‘cause he was useless.
Instead, Dean grabbed one of the spare hair-ties he always kept around the gear shift, quietly handing it to her with practised ease. He silently watched from the corner of his eyes as she tied it around her hair in a bun, pulling out some strands to frame her face better.
At least, Sammy had found happiness again, a shining light at the end of the grim tunnel that was their lives. She understood the pain, the trauma, the waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat and pouring a salt ring around the bed. She understood the life and she might be what Sam needed to settle down, to help the new generation of hunters make the world a better place, to live the normal life he had always dreamed of, mixed with all the weird stuff that they had grown up with.
his father always said. So cry he didn't, never, not since he was really young and stupid. Especially not in front of Sammy. They already had enough problem as it were, he didn't need a sissy chick-flick brother. His little brother used to look up at him; Dean couldn't let him down by being a pathetic and weak and whiny boy.
“Holy fuck” he whispered, both because of the new revelation the Angel had dropped on him and because he was terrified of said Angel figuring him out. He straightened up, rubbing the remaining sleep off his eyes that hadn’t fallen off due to the shock of seeing Castiel in such a dishevelled state. “Listen up, wings:  I haven’t had my first cup of coffee yet. Can you please drop those kind of bombs later?”
“I’ll go to Heaven as well,” Jack declared, crunching down to grab Miracle’s collar and to ruffle his fur with his hands, “and he’ll come too, so he can stay with my mom while I see if I can fix this with Naomi.”
“It’s Garth we’re talking about, he doesn’t have a bad side,” he told her curtly, before slowly easing Baby inside, parking her in her own designated spot just as Claire grabbed the remote from his hand to close the door once they were inside, “And he’s my dentist too! Can’t a man have dignity left!”
“Thank you for telling me.” Dean nodded but didn’t pick up his knife yet, he instead, looked up to face Cas from across the counter. Cas could see that Dean still had some dark coloration under his eyes, clearly still not getting enough sleep, and Cas flexed his hands instinctively, knowing that if his grace wasn’t slowly fading he could help Dean sleep better.
Reaching the kitchen, Cas had found Sam drinking a smoothie with Jack, the kitchen a mess and half the smoothie contents on Jack’s clothing, but Cas hadn’t had it in him to reprimand him. Sam had noticed him, and before he could say anything Jack turned around and scrambled off the chair, almost toppling Cas over with a hug.
Dean looks away from the book just for a second. Then he comes back to look at it. Sam’s arm is bandaged, it’s been two days since they faced the Empty. Sam sits in front of Dean. Dean seems to be in a good mood compared to the last two weeks.
From here on, we see flashbacks, figuring out what happened while Dean’s talking in voice over. There are the scenes from before, when Lucifer and Micheal saw each other, what happened with Death, Jack’s weirdness.
Is Dean hallucinating? Maybe he’s dead and this is Heaven? Dean opens his eyes wide, but he doesn’t turn around, he looks at the ground for a few seconds, feeling too much fear that that’s just an hallucination or another Lucifer’s joke. Castiel laids his hand on Dean’s shoulder, his touch is always gentle, delicate. Dean closes his eyes when he feels that touch. He decides to turn slowly as to reopen his eyes. Suddenly he is healed, there’s no more broken bones, no blood on him and finally Dean’s eyes and Castiel’s meet.
Lucifer punches Gabriel who was backing away. Raphael fights Michael. Raphael seems to get the better of the fight. He hits Michael again and again, and it actually seems too easy. Michael falls to the ground, there’s blood on the sides of his mouth.
Meg squeezes a fist at Ruby, she starts to choke, falls to the ground on her knees, her hands to her throat, coughs, she tries to breathe.
Dean attacks Meg, who seems to be much stronger than him. Sam runs to get his angel blade. Meg smiles as she fights them. She punches them both, from the cheek of Dean runs blood. Sam takes the opportunity, she’s distracted beating Dean as he hit her with the angel blade. Meg blocks Sam’s arm before he can go any further, his hand surrounding Sam’s wrist. Sam screams when Meg burns his wrist, he drops the blade on the ground and backs off. In the meantime, Meg also burns the knife in Dean’s hand, so he is forced to drop it. Then with a hand movement she throws them both on the ground. Sam bumps his head and loses consciousness. Meg laughs. Dean runs to Sam.
Dean asks this question but he already knows that Sam has no answer. Sam is sorry. Then Dean goes on, he’s calmer now.
They stat walking again towards the Impala. Chuck gets up and tries to chase them. Dean tries to look right in front of him, he tries to focus on the car in front of his eyes and not on what just happened.
He can’t stop talking, someone from behind stabs him with something that Sam can’t see. Sam’s shocked, Dean wants to step in, but he promised his brother he’d let him. When the demon’s body falls, we can see who killed him. It was Meg.
Dean tries not to cry, Sam wipes the tear that has just come down from his cheek, Eileen smiles, she’s touched and lays a hand on Sam’s arm to comfort him. Castiel and Jack look at each other and smile. Dean raises his bottle to make a toast.
Chuck straighten his arm to his son. His eyes are illuminated. There’s some panoramic footage as we see Chuck killing Michael, he becomes white light too. Chuck falls to his knees, exhausted. But he still has two cards left to play. He stands up and stretches his arms to the sky. Thunder rumbles as Chuck absorbs the darkness of the clouds (as Amara once did). Amara is still inside him and he also has her power at his disposal. Chuck’s eyes become black. Now the sky is cleaner, almost without clouds, there is more light but the sun has disappeared anyway. Chuck has regained his strength and powers. He turns to everyone.
Sam and Dean are quiet for a few seconds, facing each other. Sam looks down and nods, defeated. Then he turns to his brother for the last time.
Chuck is getting up in the meantime, he passes a hand on his clothes to clean them, then points his eyes directly to the angels in front of him: Castiel and Gabriel. Chuck laughs.
We see a montage of all the seasons, from the first to the last one. We see the best moments, the most important characters, everything they’ve been through and we’re they are now. We see the funniest moments, all the jokes, the tears, the suffering. We see everything that Sam and Dean and then Jack and Cas, Bobby, Crowley, Rowena and the others, have been through to be where they are now. To have a family. In the middle of the video there are some clips of Dean and Sam who get into the Impala (it’s the present). Dean starts the engine, the sun is setting. After that others clips of the 15 years. Then Sam and Dean (now) driving and feeling free. Free to make their choices, free to live the life they want, the life they chose, with the family they created.
“Yeah, he told me that,” Bobby said, taking out another beer for himself. “But Jack’s in charge now and he also pulled him up here. I’ll tell you only once, that son of yours. You raised him good.”
He followed Miracle out of his room, trying to let his mind wander to all the food that was in the kitchen, ready to be prepared.
“It’s not like there was a Renaissance festival happening, nor any LARPing for the matter. Besides, we were on a hunt!” he defended himself, turning around to face her as the garage door slowly opened. No matter how many times he oiled and changed the gears that pulled it up, the damned thing was still slow, but Dean had gotten used to it during the years, having it as a kind of winding down moment from a drive, no matter how long or short.
The ringing in his head got louder, drowning down everything outside of his pitiful brain, while he tried to shut his already closed eyes even tighter, willing the images to leave him alone, to let him go.
But he didn’t want to hide anymore. He had bled and fought and died for this peace, and the only way he was getting his very well earned happiness, was with his Angel alongside him.
But he was not Sober Dean at the moment, and his mouth ran before his brain could catch up. “I mean that we really went to town and also stop tilting your head like that!”
I wish I could say it was planned, ‘cause that would’ve been awesome, but it wasn’t. We’re just that in sync! It’s like we’re the same person with slightly different backgrounds!
“Oh, stop tilting your head! I’m fine. Stop worrying and let’s get back to work!” the hunter quickly said, colour creeping up in his cheeks for reasons unbeknownst to Castiel. There were many reasons for such blood rush, but he could not link any of those to their current debacle.
What…? Don’t fucking deny it, Dean, you never once told me or made me think you were bi. I thought you were homophobic for the longest time, you jerk!
It was his fault, and he would have willingly taken his place in a heartbeat. But before he was able to suggest the exchange, he would have to convince the Shadow to listen to him.
For there was Dean Winchester, lying limp on the floor with a halo of blood trailing around his head. He looked peaceful in his unconscious state and Castiel rushed at his side, assessing whether or not he was still alive and well.
But his heroic and egoistic actions didn’t grant him immunity to the shitshow that, Dean was sure, was about to go down the moment he opened his mouth.
The Shadow, clearly aware of what that picture was doing to him, kept on talking, shaking Dean to his core and unveiling notions that he could have not even conceived: “Here! It all started when
But the moment was fleeting. The air was too clear and it smelled too nicely, the birds were too chippy, loud enough to animate the back of his thoughts without being intrusive or lousy, and the calming scenery in front of him was too beautiful for this to be a cruel joke on him.
And so he picked up his axe, like he had done too many times, and he started working. He let each blow resonate, deep inside of him, he heaved against the trees with all his strength. He had done this too many times, it had become mechanical at this point, yet this time it was different.
Therefore, he continued on his speech, never letting his own eyes fall from Dean’s, memorizing over again all the lines that showed a life well lived, a human worth dying for.
“How was your weekend?” Dean asked softly, even if he already knew everything that had happened, just wanting to steal a few more minutes alone from their family with his husband, even if it made him selfish.
But, before he could spiral down once again into the never-ending black hole that was his mind, Jack pulled him out: “Dean? Dean!” he called, bringing his attention back to reality, as all of the eyes in the room landed on him expectantly.
After all that he and Sam had done, they deserved a win. They deserved peace, they deserved to have a family. They had fought so hard and they had earned, only to have it all taken away in the span of a moment. And he knew that someone must have been listening, otherwise Cas’ entire work would have been pointless, and Dean wouldn’t allow that.
The stranger simply tilted his head to the side, probably in confusion, and to Dean that was possibly one of the cutest scenes he had ever seen.
A puzzled look appeared on his face, wrinkles forming on his brow. "Assuming the host has not been murdered by the possession. Which is the most likely situation."
He knew, deep down on the rational side of his brain, that Sam would’ve understood, if only he managed to talk about it. He had just lost Eileen, after all. They shared the same pain.
The first time I called Dean Dad, he choked on his coffee! It was the second cup of the day, and he wasn’t that awake yet, but he wasn’t murderous. Second cup is usually where you can start to ask little things, like ‘
I mean, I always thought he was kinda butch and overcompensating, but that came with the territory, really, growing up the way we did. As I said before, Dad was a piece of shit and Dean raised me, he was brother and mother and father, all in one, since the age of 4.
Cas had to open his eyes and ask to be shotgun on their drive back to the bunker and Dean had to begrudgingly give in to the request, not even having to think about it, but still pretending to for Sammy’s sake. He loved when Cas was shotgun, he would always toy and fret with the seatbelt as if he didn’t know what to make of it, and whenever a particular song that he knew came on the radio or on one of Dean’s tapes he would whisper all excitedly at him:
And Castiel’s heart broke immediately, figuratively obviously, but the pain his newly found knowledge caused was more than psychosomatic.
“Which is why we got back,” Sam explained, placing a hand on his shoulder and squeezing him in a tight hug, still eyeing Dean suspiciously, “but I wasn’t expecting to find books all over the main room and blood everywhere!”.
That’s enough! Jack, son, pass me the holy water. I knew we should’ve had Devil’s Traps laying around.
“She said that I was still too young to rule over the Universe,” he continued, looking every bit the millennial/Gen Z that he was. He still had a lot to learn and, well, was actually just three years old. Amara had been right on her judgment.
“See, you–” he said, trying to keep his voice level and trying not to yell up at the silent skies, “you left us. You left us. You went off. You said… You said the earth would be fine because it had me… and it had Sam, but it’s not, and we’re not.”
Dean couldn’t care less if the world burned to the ground and collapsed on its axis, as long as Cas was alright, back with him.
When Castiel had come back with several books that they might have needed in their conjoined research, after a rather short period of absence, the hunter emanated such a powerful state of distress that he had to comfort him. He had paused their work, all but ordering the hunter to eat something for he was stubborn.
He just had to shoulder this, like he did everything else, bury his emotions down and keep them under lock and key. That was the only way to work.
“I just need coffee” he yelled, his breath increasing in rapidity and his eyes blown wide in what Castiel realized was fear.
He and his siblings, they would probably never experience that raw joy, that visceral pain. And so he was content to just watch them being, trying to assimilate as much as he could.
The hunter huffed out a breathy laugh: he had asked himself the same question since he was a child and his father told him to grow up and stop acting childishly. "Fuck me if I know, it's just the way it is sometimes." He then added hastily, trying to change the subject as soon as possible, "But anyway, what were we talking about?" Just because he wasn't bothered by the angel seeing him like
He had to admit, though, that the hunter was also a good man and seemed at least discrete at his job. He had managed to track down the demon all by himself with relatively small knowledge and had also reacted fairly well at the new information that was delivered upon him. Based on previous knowledge, humans tended to ignore the supernatural, but even those who embraced it were shocked and surprised at the prospect of demons, when facing them for the first time.
It was Sam, once again, who managed to pull him out of his thoughts, even when the wariness and shakiness in his bones remained. “Okay, perfect! Then, we got to deal with, you know, the demons and angels that are back,” he said, clapping his hands and looking around the room, probably scanning through his mind for some sort of aid in their next step.
And now that the words were out of his mouth, he couldn’t stop repeating them. It was a chant, the sting of
On those rough nights, he'd remember her and he'd ask for that little extra help from above. He had done it also that day, while getting ready for the fight.
And how could've he asked Sam for help, when his little brother was off, happy and free to do whatever he wanted without having to save the world or without Dean dragging him down?
He expected to be greeted by someone or something. He had died enough times to know how this worked. He had gone through the system a lot during the years and never once did they skip this passage.
“Yes, I think so! But. Wait, did you just call me son?” Jack asked, his expression open and hopeful.
Then Angels and Demons became suddenly more real than he had believed, almost as if they had stepped out of his nightmares and memories out of the blue, and he had lost the little faith he had in him. He had stopped praying for things to go well, for the people he loved to stop dying.
He didn’t know where he was now, didn’t know how many miles he had put in between himself and the cramped motel room they were staying at. All he knew was that he had taken his leather jacket and his keys with him before he left. Those, besides his necklace and his car, were the only possessions he needed. Everything else stayed in the Impala at all times, after all.
If this was Falling, he could not blame his former siblings, he thought treacherously, horrified by his own mind. Yet he never wished for this to stop.
Nevertheless, he soldiered on. He was a Winchester, after all, not just some random coward off the side of the road. “’Cause you’re an angel,” he began, already cursing his foolishness. Had he forgotten the tiny detail of Castiel’s new form, all due to his stupidity? “Were, sorry.”
Truth is, all I had to do was tell Cas I wanted to give this speech ‘cause I deserved, by birth right even, to embarrass him in front of his wedding guests and the place was mine. I did have to organise part of this, ‘cause one thing we know about Dean and Cas is that they don’t plan shit, but it was fine.
Sam, Dean, Castiel, Rowena, Gabriel.. everybody watches Jack take Chuck’s power once and for all. Jack leaves him and Chuck falls to the ground. Jack emanates light from his eyes, from his veins. He looks at Sam, Dean and Cas and snaps his fingers. A powerful snap, heard by them all. Everyone in the battlefield is healed, they look at each other, at their clothes and understand that they no longer have any wounds, same for the angels and demons still alive. All the monsters of Purgatory dissolve in the air. There aren’t any dead bodies on the ground anymore. Castiel walks away and goes to give a hand to Rowena and the other angels nearby. Sam and Dean look at each other. The battle is over. Chuck is defeated. Jack is the new God.
Meg smiles at Sam. She was the last thing, or person they expected to see. Meg is satisfied when she speaks, in a certain way she managed to fool Castiel and all the angels when they had proposed  her to be summoned to earth for fighting God.
Lucifer makes a disgusted face as he crosses his arms to his chest and looks at Gabriel. When Gabriel died a few moments before, there was no wings’ shape around his body and Lucifer realizes that only at this moment.
Sam looks at Dean, he didn’t expect such a speech from his brother, especially not in front of everyone.
Chuck lets go of all his power, a shock wave hits everyone, demons, angels, humans. Everyone finds themselves on the ground, while the nearest angels and demons become dust (Dumah, Naomi and Uriel). The shock wave also knocks down some trees in the distance, and a gust of wind arrives even to Jack whose eyes light up and go out all the time. Everybody’s down. Then Michael joins Chuck. He looks around.
Sam and Dean go towards Lucifer, he, with his power, throws Dean against the wall and Sam against the library making it fall. Michael while Lucifer is distracted tries to take the book from his hands but Lucifer teleports first across the room. Michael throws a beam of his power to Lucifer but he moves again and he is not hit.
Then a noise. In the middle of the field, the black slime that brought the angels and demons to the fight makes its way. They begin to disappear, some try to escape but the Empty takes them back. Sam and Dean’s eyes are full of terror. There’s nothing they can do, not even Jack can do something, God doesn’t have any power on the Empty. Dean crazily looks at all the angels and demons disappearing to find Castiel. When he finds him with his gaze, Castiel is already looking at him, but it’s already too late. The Empty takes Castiel back, one last look at Dean before going back to that place, before suffering for ever, before dying, again.
It seems that nothing happens but then in front of them, a black slime begins to appear and becomes a portal. Everyone is hopeful. We see the portal getting bigger and bigger and through a profile shot we see someone coming out of it, one step at the time. Castiel is here. The portal closes behind him.
The battlefield empties.. Rowena, Balthazar.. They are all brought back. That was the deal. We don’t know if some of the demons and angels manage to escape. Surely, we don’t see the Empty taking them all. Sam and Rowena look at each other when she disappears, for last. Dean looks at Jack, who’s also upset. Dean asks him for help with his eyes. Chuck’s trying to get on his knees to stand up.
It’s been a day since Dean had to transport Sam’s body into the Impala and the bunker, Eileen helped him get Sam to the infirmary and lay him on a cot. Not that it’s the first time he’s transported his brother like this, but it certainly doesn’t get any easier.
Sam is scared and frustrated, it can’t happen again, not Lucifer again. Dean is still at the top of the stairs. Lucifer could not have entered in any other way since shortly before Sam and Dean had reinforced the wardings in the walls, also to protect themselves from Chuck.
Thank you guys for reading! I’ve written these scripts with all my heart and I really hope you liked them. Please, let me know what you think of ‘em, you can contact me on twitter too (@xfraahx).
Then he walks out the door where he came in. Sam is worried, he exchanges a look with Eileen. She beckons him to follow Dean. Sam runs after his brother. They are both in the hallway, Dean was going back to his room.
Sam doesn’t have time to answer, Ruby throws herself back into the battle. Balthazar is fighting, we also see Anna, Zachariah and Abaddon, all of them fighting monsters. They kill some of them. Anna puts her hand in the forehead of a monster and kills him. Gadreel and Samandriel are the closest to Chuck. Everyone tries to get close to him. Rowena watches four leviathans approaching her. She became a demon when she died, but she still remembers all her spells. She runs to the bowl that Sam and Dean first used to call Chuck. She kneels down and sets the bowl that was upside down. She puts some dirt in it. The house where Jack was born is destroyed, after the demons dismantled it piece by piece to weaken Chuck, throwing nails and material against him. Rowena walks up to a piece of glass from a broken window and cuts off her hand, she squeezes her hand and blood falls into the bowl. All this happens very quickly as the leviathans approach. She lights a match and throws it into the bowl. Then she reaches out her arms to the leviathans and very quickly makes her hands clap with each other.
Sam smiles back at her. The music increases. Castiel and Dean are surrounded by monsters. Dean holds the machete in his right hand, Castiel holds the angel blade with his left hand. Dean and Castiel’s back touch each other as they circle around to keep their guard high as vampires and leviathans and other monsters come closer and closer to them.
Chuck smiles at Sam and Dean, who are increasingly upset. Then silence, Chuck left leaving Sam and Dean immersed in their loneliness.
Dean looks at his brother. Sam looks at Cas’ handprint. Dean gets up off the table and looks the other way like he doesn’t want Sam to look at the mark that Cas left on him, like it’s personal, intimate.
Amara greets Sam and Dean, gives a quick look at Jack, he nods and Amara disappears. Castiel is still helping the angels and demons on the ground to rise up, as Balthazar and others. Dean looks at Castiel and a little smile shows on his face, he tries to hide that. Sam looks around.
Thank you for reading! Do not forget to read the last episode’s script. You have no idea of what’s gonna happen!
The three of them go into the barn. It’s empty, there’s nothing in it. Sam puts the bag on the floor and Eileen helps him take it all away. Dean looks around for a second and squeezes his jacket between his hands. He closes his eyes, then reopens them and turns to Sam and Eileen. They put the ingredients into the bowl, just like Nick did the year before to bring Lucifer back. Dean also adds his jacket sleeve. Then he cuts off his hand, the blood falls into the bowl and immediately puts a gauze on the wound. Sam gives an angel blade to Dean and another one to Eileen. Sam lights a match and throws it into the bowl, then says a few words in Latin while Dean continues to be on alert and looking around, Sam and Eileen are behind him.
Black screen. We hear the armored door of the bunker open, Sam and Jack enter and going down-stairs, they call Dean multiple times. Dean did not answer all night to Sam’s calls.. Sam keeps calling Dean worried. Dean comes out of the dungeon, red eyes for crying, he still has the jacket with the handprint that Castiel left him. Dean walks towards Jack and Sam leaning on the furniture almost as if he can’t stand on his own. They gather to talk under the metal staircase, near the large table in the main room.
Dean notices other bloodstains left on the asphalt, one of them is a trail, with the torch following it until it stops. The trail no longer continues, the blood disappears. There is no trace further on.
Castiel tries to look at them both the same way, he tries not to dwell on Dean. He never thought he’d see him again, he didn’t think he’d have to deal with what he confessed to him.
Rowena opens her eyes wide, then looks to her left where Crowley throws down a monster’s body after killing him. He gets close to Rowena.
Becky is in her house, she sees her husband and her children, the four of them hugging and smiling. Stevie is in her and Charlie’s apartment, the broken plate still on the floor, she looks around.
Chuck thought he killed every creature he ever created. Now there’s a burn on the spot where the beam of light hit the ground. Sam and Dean aren’t close to Chuck, but still watched the whole scene. There’s a close-up of Dean trying to get off the ground, his leg hurts, but the plan has to go on. Dean rests his weight on the knee that’s still intact, while the other leg is stretched laterally. He looks down and spits blood. There is still some thunder in the background. He wipes his mouth with the sleeve of his jacket when someone appears behind him.
Castiel looks around, there’s not much he can do. Dean’s left arm is stretched out along his side, as is Castiel’s right arm.
Dean takes his brother’s head in his hands. Behind Meg it opens a portal of black slime, like the one that took away Castiel. She takes with one hand the body of the demon she killed before and drags it with her, then turns to Sam and Dean before going.
Sam is always sympathetic, he still doesn’t understand how Cas summoned the Empty. Dean has completely stopped talking, his jaw is closed while he watches the road in front of him. All they hear is the sound of Baby’s engine running down the street, a sound that on this occasion becomes almost deafening. Dean knows he’s never gonna be ready to talk about it, but maybe he can share his pain with his brother. He takes a deep breath and then starts talking again.
Dean stops and turns slowly to look his brother in the eye. Dean puts the beer bottle on the table and approaches Sam as he talks.
Jack’s sitting in the kitchen, he’s eating a snack. Sam and Dean haven’t been in touch yet, he’s worried. Jack raises his head when he hears a noise. He stands up slowly from the chair, walks beside the kitchen counter where three very small plants are placed, as soon as he passes them they wither but he doesn’t notice that. He comes out of the kitchen and heads for the hallway.
For all he and the Shadow had talked about, they didn’t mention anything about Cas’ wellbeing once he was mortal and human. They hadn’t said anything about him coming back in one piece, fine, alright. Just graceless, that was the only point that mattered.
He knew, rationally and logically, that silence didn’t always mean bad things, that Castiel’s brain was probably still rebooting and wrapping around his new reality, that he had said those words and sacrificed himself all those days back for a reason. All of that he knew.
. Exasperated already at the possible childish behaviour, he cracked open his eyes and panicked immensely at the sight in front of him.
"You gotta pull the handle and manually open the door. Then you get in and sit," he said with a newly found fondness in his voice that rarely appeared during casual conversations, especially not with strangers. He hadn't used that find in while, couple of years at least.
