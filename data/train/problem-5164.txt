Dean does know. “Where’s Cas?”
Cas nods absently, fingers reaching out to touch the leather band again.
“You can have it if you want,” Dean finds himself saying.
Cas nods. “That is where I draw the line.”
Dean shouldn’t have been surprised. Cas has a lot of opinions on both 90s power ballads (for) and the enduring legacy of the papacy (against), so he really should have seen the Sinéad O’Connor appreciation coming.
“Yeah, and let’s just say he had a few suggestions for what I should give you in return. I don’t think you’d enjoy any of them,” Cas says, visibly fighting back a smile. “They all involved pink hearts and/or copious amounts of glitter.”
Cas stares at him, blue eyes narrowing almost imperceptibly. “Is it?”
He’d always assumed if this happened, their first kiss would be slow, maybe even somewhat hesitant, but he’d forgotten to take into account that: a) They’ve been waiting over 12 years for this and b) Cas is an impatient fucker at the best of times.
Dean gestures at the ring. “We kind of did this whole thing a little backwards, didn’t we?”
Dean snorts. “Are you kidding? They’ve been yanking you around for years, you don’t think I’ve learned to pick up on what your face looks like when you’re tuning in to one of their broadcasts?”
Maybe he should just stop assuming things about him and Cas.
Dean’s officially done. After three straight hours of researching Vetala migration patterns, his brain is fried. He takes a deep breath, pushing the laptop aside and dropping his head down onto his pillow.
“Good. Ok, I’m beat. I’m going to take a shower and turn in.” Sam starts to walk towards his room but stops a few steps away. Dean can’t see his face but he knows his brother, and his body language is practically screaming ‘I don’t know whether or not I should tell Dean what I’m keeping from him.’
“Scout’s honour,” Dean promises, though, of course, that’s bullshit. When has he ever passed up the opportunity to wallow in guilt or self-hatred? He sits back in his chair, waiting for Cas to go on.
Dean makes his way over to the library, and sure enough, Cas is sitting at the table, eyes focused down as he runs his fingers over the names carved into the wood. Dean has noticed him doing that when he thinks nobody’s looking; as if he’s trying to puzzle something out and the answer can only be found in the mess of initials and names etched there.
“This because of the whole wavelength of celestial intent thing? Your thoughts transmit on a different frequency or something?”
Though considering Cas is a fallen angel who’d turned his back on heaven and God a long time ago, perhaps Dean should have tried a different approach; sacrilege isn’t exactly high up on his list of concerns.
Dean sinks back against the wall, still struggling to catch his breath. He glances over at Cas, eyeing his rumpled shirt and dishevelled hair with a rush of satisfaction. “You know me,” he says, his voice several octaves lower than he’d intended. ”Big talker. All for talking.”
Cas sighs, rolling his glass between his hands. “It told me that’s what drew it to me. People usually make it easy when it can read their desires out of their minds,  but with me…it had no idea. Finally, a challenge.”
Dean gives him a once-over. “You look like hell, Sammy. Rough day at the office?”
It is important, though. Dean knows that. It means something to have Cas accept it from him. To see it on his finger when he’s poring over research with Sam. To hear it clink against the bottle when they’re drinking in the kitchen the next evening.
“I think he’s in the library,” Sam says, running a hand through his hair. “Like I said, Dean, this was a rough one, especially for him. Maybe you should go talk to him?”
“It wasn’t so bad...least you didn’t look like a lumberjack,” he says, grinning wryly.
“Yeah, but look around, Cas! Look at all the books and information we have here. Instead of hoarding it, we should be making it available for everyone who needs it. It could save lives.”
Cas looks unconvinced but carries on anyway. “It made me feel like there was nothing for me here, and that perhaps you would prefer to think of me as a fond memory, rather than having me around as a constant, festering disappointment. And that uh...you believe everything I touch always goes wrong.”
Cas looks up at him surprised. “How did you know that?”
John Winchester taught him that, although he probably never meant to.
“More of a suggestion, I suppose. You’re welcome to take me up on it if you would like.”
Ever since he ditched the trench coat, Cas has been eager to experiment with his new look. It’s been innocuous for the most part - who knew Henleys came in so many colours? - but there have definitely been a few uncomfortable moments. Like that time Cas had picked up a blue linen shirt and Dean had been struck with the vivid reminder of a burned-out broken Cas from a miserable future that never came to be, and he’d had to force himself to bite his tongue. What exactly was he supposed to say? ‘Nah, man, don’t buy that shirt. I’m worried it’s a slippery slope from billowy sleeves to amphetamines and nihilism?’
“I don’t actually know." Dean rubs a hand over the back of his neck, thinking back to that time.
Dean doesn’t have time to respond before Cas returns with the whiskey, but he smiles and shoots Sam a quick thumbs up. Sam nods, taking the glass from Cas and leaning back in his chair.
“Well, I spent almost three decades drowning it in whiskey, anger and -“ he had been about to say sex but had managed to cut himself off. It doesn’t exactly feel right to casually toss that out in front of Cas “-whatever other distraction I could get my hands on. You’ve seen how well that worked out for me.”
Cas pulls out his old ring, examining it closely. “This looks a lot like the one Mary used to wear,” he says, holding it in his palm.
Yeah, Dean had come to the same conclusion at some point over the past couple of years.
“Oh, he did now, did he?” Dean asks neutrally.
And hell if that doesn’t sound familiar. Dean can relate.
That’s not entirely true. Sirens may twist things and use your worst fears against you, but that doesn’t mean the things they bring out of you aren’t real. At least on some level. But Cas looks so morose right now, fuck if Dean’s going to point that out.
Cas may still be trying to get the hang of human idiosyncrasies, but even he has to know that.
The lights are all off, other than the solitary dim table lamp in front of him casting shadows over his face. Angel or human, Dean’s always seen Cas as being something bigger than him, something more. He can’t remember the last time he saw Cas look so small and defeated.
“Sam found that mixtape you made for me in my car and for some reason, found it absolutely hilarious,” Cas says, tilting his head to look at Dean more intently.
“Good. Uh, great.”
Several moments pass with both of them just looking at each other and Dean wonders what Cas is waiting for. Oh, right. Him. Because Cas is selfless and good and always puts whatever Dean wants first, and, God, is that a pain in the ass sometimes. He wraps his hand around the back of Cas’ neck and pulls him close to press their lips together.
Oh. Ok, then.
He didn’t miss Cas’ minute flinch when a hunter called a few weeks ago with a question about angelic vessels and consent. Cas had answered all her questions calmly, but he’d been quieter than usual the rest of the day, his brow slightly more furrowed. Nothing anyone who didn’t study him as closely as Dean did, would ever notice.
“It’s not like you knew it all when you started,” Cas pointed out. “You learned through experience.”
What the fuck do you say to that?
A few weeks later, Sam and Cas head out on a hunt together. Another hunter had called asking for their help with a Lamia that had been running around, wreaking havoc in Wisconsin. There’s no need to send in the cavalry for a B grade monster of the week, and since Jack's planning on sticking around the bunker for a few days, Dean opts to stay behind with him.
“It heard me and Sam talking at the bar. About you,” he clarifies.
Dean reaches into his drawer, digging around for the box where he still keeps the jewellery and hands it over to Cas.
“And uh - well that you know about my feelings for you,” - the table must be splintering now - “and that you’d keep tossing me trinkets and tokens, not enough that it ever had to mean anything to you, but enough that it would keep some semblance of hope alive in me- ”
Cas is already halfway in Dean’s lap before he seems to realise the library chairs aren’t going to support the weight of two full-grown men. He changes course, pulling Dean up by his shirt before pushing him up against the wall and kissing him again. Their movements are surprisingly in sync and there’s none of the fumbling and awkwardness Dean had assumed there’d be.
“Cas didn’t want me to tell you but...”
“Oh, I’ll take you- hey, Sammy! Thought you were headed to bed?”
He’s not sure what to say to Cas.  Back when he was an angel, a siren wouldn’t have even have fazed him. Since he lost his grace, he’s gotten a little banged up on a few hunts, hazards of the job and all, but sirens are much worse than cuts and bruises. They get in your head. Force you to face stuff you truly don’t want to, the darkest most painful thoughts you’d never dare say out loud.
“Hell, man, you don’t think I get that?” Dean asks, his fingers digging roughly into the mattress (it’s memory foam - it’s going to remember that.)  “All the people I couldn’t save, the people that I got killed? It doesn’t go away. That guilt, it’s always there.”
He might still be clumsy about it all, but hell, he’s pretty sure Cas can handle that. After all, their whole relationship has been about following each other through the dark, a little clumsiness is to be expected.
Thus began the slow arduous process of combing through decades of research and digitising files in order to create the database Sam insisted would revolutionise the hunting world.
"His feet are on my table," they both say at the same time.
“Just finishing up the dishes. I assume you’re here to see Dean? I’m pretty sure he headed right downstairs when he got home. Not even a ‘hi mom’ at the door,” she recounted.
They cleaned up and Castiel offered to make them omelets. They fed them to one another straight from the pan, forgoing plates altogether. Once they’d finished that, they moved to the couch to idly watch TV. It was the picture of domestic bliss.
“I was wondering where you’d disappeared to,” Michael said, flashing one of his trademarked smiles as he leaned down to give his girlfriend a peck on the lips. Anna smiled back and pushed him playfully into the recliner catty corner to the couch.
Cas positioned himself and drew a phrase. He made a face, and assumed Gabriel had written this prompt. Before Charlie started the time, he signaled to Dean that the phrase had three words.
Dean curled up in the center of the bed, his gaze soft in the direction of the closet. He just wanted to be asleep. He didn’t want to think about the day he’d had, and he didn’t want to think about the day to come.
After two and a half movies, almost everyone had passed out. Castiel could be found sound asleep with his head resting on his couch buddy’s shoulder. He didn’t mean for it to happen, he just zonked out and ended up using Dean as a pillow. Charlie most definitely would have snapped a picture had she been able to stay awake long enough for it to happen. Soon enough, though, Castiel was nudged out of dreamland. He yawned ferociously as he stretched his arms above his head.
Halloween was Castiel’s favorite holiday. There were no family obligations, there was free candy everywhere, and you could dress up as literally anything you wanted. It was especially great this year because it fell on a Friday night, and as per usual, Naomi was out of town until Sunday morning. For the past few years, Balthazar had taken him to the best parties in their slice of Chicago. Cas was a bit wistful that he wouldn’t be back at his old stomping grounds for the holiday, but he had something planned to keep him from thinking about that. He was just finishing up a phone call with his old friend.
“I never had much experience getting cookie
“Yeah? And what do you tell him?”
They swayed a little off beat to Maroon 5’s 'Love Somebody’. It was perfect. At the end of the song, Dean leaned in and kissed Cas long and sweet.
Currently, Castiel was on the main floor in the kitchen, helping Ash play bar-tender. He hadn’t been able to mix drinks since he left Chicago. He was a little rusty at first, but he got warmed up and he was having a great time. Dean had been Castiel’s first customer, but had since wandered off to enjoy himself at the party.
"Yeah," he replied, taking his eyes off the screen and focusing on Cas.
,” he revealed, a hard poke to Dean’s chest to emphasize his point. Dean smiled triumphantly, a glint in his eye telling Cas that Dean knew exactly what he was doing when he planned his proposal.
"Can't I stay up a little while and watch a movie with you and Cas?" Aiden pleaded. Dean and Cas shared a look.
“What are you doing here?” Dean asked, referencing the party around them.
Castiel buried his face into Dean’s shoulder when the man added a third finger. His throat making noises on its own volition. He knew Dean liked it when he was vocal, and damn did he enjoy when Dean was confident.
wonder of the world.” Dean’s jaw dropped in mock-offense. Castiel kissed the offended look right off Dean’s face. Castiel removed his boyfriend’s boxers and took Dean in his hand and pumped a few times, causing Dean to moan into his mouth. And
Michael chuckled.
“Ok, so maybe I didn’t think you two would get together, but that’s only because my good friend over here,” he marched across the room and threw his arm around Balthazar, squeezing him tightly in a side-hug, “had taken a liking to Castiel, and I couldn’t bet against this face, could I?” Gabriel asked, using his free hand to squeeze his colleague’s face into a pucker. Balthazar tolerated it for maybe a second before pushing Gabriel off of him.
“JESUS!! Jo! What the hell are you sneaking up on me for?”
be defensive about it. His whole life, he was told what he was doing - what he was feeling - was wrong. Now, someone was challenging him on his relationship with Balthazar, and Castiel didn’t know how to react. He wasn’t mad at Dean for asking, he really wasn’t, but years of being conditioned to lie and cover up his real relationship with Balthazar took over before he could really think about it.
“You need to quit
“Tempting...but why go for the whole kit-and-kaboodle on the very first round? How about we wager a shot,” Gabe counter-offered.
“Moooom,” Dean groaned.
Cas growled and took a seat in the waiting room. He bounced his leg and nervously chewed his nails. He waited for an entire hour before he was informed of anything.
"Um, Cas. I need to tell you something," Dean said carefully. Cas tried to control his fear but those words shook him to his core.
"Holy fuck," Dean hissed, watching his cock disappear into Cas. He looked up into his lover's eyes, seeing adoration, lust, bliss, and so much more. Once fully seated, Cas leaned down and kissed Dean passionately. After adjusting, he slowly started to move his hips in circles, causing Dean to buck up a little for more.
“Morning, mom,” he replied.
“Turn the light off on your way out?” Castiel asked, burying his face back into his pillow, hoping that nobody got
do??” Dean shot back.
“There’s nothing I want more,” he replied, following his boyfriend into the bathroom.
“Do you want to tell me why?” he prodded.
“You most certainly will not be doing that. I was way too cold when I woke up this morning. I should’ve known better than to banish my personal heater in the middle of winter.”
The tight-knit group of Dean, Charlie, Sam, Alfie, and Balthazar stayed well into the night, celebrating and having a good time. Balthazar had even snuck a flask in with him, and was gracious enough to share with the graduates. Dean was tense around him when he had first arrived, but after Balthazar had apologized for the Halloween debacle, they seemed to get along fine; however, Castiel did notice Dean’s arm tighten ever so slightly around him while Balthazar was in proximity. Before long, the others bid their farewells and it was just Dean and Cas.
"Don't deny it. You did something stupid, didn't you?" She have him a challenging glare and lifted an eyebrow.
, and he’s too...bossy,” Balthazar complained.
,” Castiel replied, failing at his attempt to play it off as a joke. He finally made eye contact with Mary, noticing her skeptical look. “Bad joke?” Castiel tried brushing it off. Mary shook her head and resumed scrubbing the dishes. After a moment of silent cleaning between the two, she spoke up again.
Castiel braced himself. This was it.
Did Cas really just say yes to this? He just met the guy last night, in the back if a cop car, for God's sake! There was just something about Dean that Cas couldn't say no to. He heard a thump behind him and turned to face Dean. Cas looked at him for the first time in proper lighting and couldn't believe this man was more beautiful than he had been before. Cas couldn't take his eyes off of him, from his messy hair to his work boots.
He secured Dean’s wrists to the headboard nonetheless, tugging slightly to make sure it wouldn’t fall apart completely. He smiled to himself when it held up and Dean bit his lip when they made eye contact. Cas leaned down and kissed him once more.
“What was that for?” Cas asked.
Dean walked in a moment later but didn’t join them on the couch. He decided to take a nap, he only got about three hours of sleep last night, after all. When he laid down on his cot, he realized how tired he actually was. Within minutes he was out like a light.
“I could do without the attitude,” she started. “You do know why I'm punishing you, correct?” She inquired.
“Naomi…” Bart started to pacify.
“Think about what?” Charlie asked coyly. She giggled as if she knew something Dean didn't. She fell back on Dean’s bed, the springs creaking in protest at the sudden weight.
“Bartholomew, this is not the place for this conversation. I don’t know what Castiel got into, but I won’t stand here and be accused of-of what? Child abuse? By my own husband?”
“I’m the idiot,” Dean said, “I caused this,” He gently ran his thumb over his boyfriend’s closed eye.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Castiel said, “I can’t believe I forgot, I-”
They made eye contact and Cas strode up the their booth. Dean’s face split in the biggest smile when he noticed what Cas was wearing.
“Life is pain, Cassie. Anyone who says differently is selling something,” Balthazar quipped.
True to his word, Castiel had gone home that weekend. With Naomi being gone the following week, everyone had had the chance to calm down and put some distance between themselves and that night. There weren’t any formal apologies, but things returned to normal in the Novak household. They all silently agreed to not bring it up.
When Alfie had first mentioned night games, Cas thought they sounded dumb. He grew up in the city where you either hung out at a club or someone’s house/apartment. You didn’t go running around outside at night. That would’ve been
,” Dean said, mocking the last word, “you know we haven’t had sex in a
“I gotcha good,” Castiel whispered, laughing to himself.
It’s wine,” he said, swirling it around the cup for dramatic effect before swallowing it and checking the bottom, “
to game night so everyone can embarrass me infront of them. And I told you, I am not getting that involved,” Balthazar explained.
Through watery eyes, Castiel looked up at his boyfriend.
"Wow. That's....different."
“If you’re going to bed, at least don’t fall asleep in your costume,” Dean said, surprising Castiel. He picked his head up from the pillow and stared at Dean. After a moment, he pushed himself off the bed and walked up to his boyfriend.
"You bitch," he spat out, "you take that back," he warned.
"Please, Cas. I need you," Dean whispered into Cas's mouth. Cas started gaining speed, gliding up and down on Dean's cock, ripping moans from the both of them.
“I-I don’t know. I texted him when we started making dinner, and he hasn’t even opened it.”
After some persuasion, Castiel was convinced to go out with Balthazar. First, they stopped at Cas' favorite burger place, and Balthazar insisted that he pay for them both. Knowing that his friend wasn’t going to take no for an answer, Castiel acquiesced.
Dean can't help but moan softly as Cas's strong hands kneed his sore muscles. Dean doesn't know when, but sometime during the massage, he falls asleep.
“Oh! Children….Children of the Corn! No wait, that’s four words. Rope? Double dutch? Shit, uuuhhhhh jump rope?”
"Shut up and watch your show," Dean says. Cas chuckles and steals Dean's beer to take a sip. Dean takes the bottle back and sets it on the end table. As it turns out, Suits was a great show. Both men continue to watch the marathon long after their daughter goes to bed.
“What are they doing now?” Sam asked, handing Charlie a steaming mug and joining her by the window.
Confused, Castiel tried to recall the night before. He had snuck out and gone to Ash’s party. Getting there was a bitch, too, since he didn’t have his keys or his phone. He ended up walking almost three of the fifteen miles it took to reach Ash’s house. Luckily, someone from school had noticed him and offered him a ride.
Cas shut the door of the fridge and started walking towards the check out aisles, Dean quick to catch up to him. They met Jo at aisle four.
“Are you implying that you’re teaching me a lesson?”
"'Night Cas. I love you," Dean whispered.
"Caaas," Dean complained, running his hands through his hair. This man was going to kill him. How could he be so cruel as to leave Dean dripping, fully erect. Cas emerged out of the closet, wearing only boxers. Dean approved of the new outfit. Then he noticed something in Cas's hands.
And that's the way Cas cleans up his messes.
“Alright. That’s a little more complicated, but I think I could pick up on it pretty easily,” Cas said, “What’s next?” he prompted. Dean grinned wide. This was his favorite night game.
“What’s this I hear about you getting a C on your calculus test?” She put her hands on her hips and looked at him expectantly, looking for all the world like an actual concerned mother. Castiel, of course saw right through her “concern”.
“Yes, quite possibly the most notorious night game. You split up depending on how many people are playing total. Robbers should outnumber cops
” Castiel shouted, not able to get out anymore as Dean swiftly smacked his butt and tossed him onto their bed. Cas panted quietly, catching his breath as he steadied himself.
to fall in love with Dean! But I’m fucking elated that I did, and that I’m lucky enough that he loves me back! Who are you to stand there and lecture me about love? At least there’s someone out there who genuinely fucking cares about me! I’m not so sure you could say the same,” Castiel snapped, finding his voice. He stood up sharply, causing his chair to fly out behind him.
A lightbulb seemed to go off in Dean’s mind as both he and Castiel replied simultaneously, “Ash.”
“Hey,” he answered, not being able to keep the disappointment out of his voice.
At her coworkers’ hums of approval, she pressed on, “ok, so instead of picking teams like we usually do, I thought it would be a bit more fair to our new-comers if we played one round as a sort of free-for-all. Then, the top two players can be, like, team captains and pick the teams we’ll have for the rest of the night,” she suggested. When she heard no protests, she went to grab the supplies they’d need for the first game.
Cas mentally ran through the argument in his head. If he was completely honest, he wasn’t paying much attention to what either of them had said.
He thought there would be breakfast waiting for him, but all that was there were dirty dishes. Dean was a little confused, but shrugged it off as he reached for the cereal box. He cursed under his breath when he pulled it from the cupboard and realized it was empty.
Cas is still looking down at his hands. Dean understands. It’ll take more than one vaguely reassuring pep talk to deal with this and even still, it’s not like what Cas is feeling will ever fully go away. He’ll learn to deal, though. They all will.
Dean swallows. No one else had ever noticed, but that’s exactly why he’d bought it. He’d only ever seen Mary’s ring in photos, but when he’d come across this one at a pawn shop, it had been a punch in the gut. Maybe it was stupid, but he had so little of her, and anything that brought her a little closer to being something real, rather than a faded half-remembered ideal, was something he clung tightly to.
“Fair assumption to make,” Dean says carefully.
“You know, I used to wear jewellery all the time when I was younger,” Dean says in what he hopes isn’t a blatantly obvious attempt at changing the subject. “Nothing fancy, just a ring, a couple of bracelets.” There was also the amulet Sam gave him, but he's trying to avoid sensitive subjects right now, and bringing up that damn necklace and all the fucking baggage it holds for both of them, won't exactly help with that.
“Yeah, ok, Sam. I get it. How bad was it?”
“You can’t use this as an excuse to wallow in guilt or fall down a well of self-loathing,” Cas says, squinting at Dean.
“Sam didn’t tell me anything” - he tightens his grip around Cas’ wrist - “but you can if you want to? You may not have meant it, but maybe it’d make you feel better to get it out there? Trust me, that whole ‘conceal, don’t feel’ approach is bullshit. ”
“Yeah, alright, McCoy.  I’ll go talk to him.”
He checks the library again but it’s empty; Cas must already have gone to bed. Dean turns out the lights and heads back to his own room to do the same. He’s just drifting off to sleep when he hears a buzzing beside his head. He picks up his phone from where he must have dropped it on the pillow and checks the display.
Sam glares at him. “Dean-”
“So I guess I should have noticed when he wasn’t ignoring this dude,” Sam continues. “ But, I mean, we weren’t expecting it to be a siren. And come on, you know Cas has been different ever since he gave up his grace. He wears band t-shirts and jewellery now,” Sam says, throwing up his hands and wincing when the bag he’s still carrying hits him in the face. “I just figured he wanted to give other human things a try.”
Even the guilt I feel over you, Dean wants to say. You’re sitting right in front of me, and I still feel the guilt for every time I couldn’t save you. For every time I failed you.
“Cas, you didn’t know, ” Dean says quietly. “Heaven was jerking you around just as much as it was me, as it was Jimmy. None of us had any idea what we were getting ourselves mixed up in.”
“Well, yes. After it managed to slip me the venom, it didn’t need to read my mind. All those dark thoughts…” he looks up at Dean. “I’m not sure what Sam told you, but I didn’t mean any of it. I’m only sorry that he had to be there to hear it.”
I'm trying, Dean thinks. I'm fucking trying.
Cas pinches the bridge of his nose. “I know that. It doesn’t help though.” He sighs. “You know, Nick called me a monster when I told him about what I did to Jimmy.”
Sam sighs. “It wasn’t a Lamia.” He turns around to face Dean. “It was a siren.”
“Dean,” Cas says sternly, and Dean has to look up at the fire in his tone. “You promised.”
Right no spiralling into self-loathing. Well, guess he’s going with option b, then.
Cas looks up as he hears Dean’s footsteps approaching, and quickly moves his hand away from the carvings. The layout of the bunker kind of makes it hard to sneak up on someone if they’re in the library, and, for once, Dean’s grateful for that. Cas has dealt with enough surprises for one day.
Sam shoots a look at Cas when he turns to get another glass. He’s clearly exhausted and wants nothing more than to pass out on the nearest available flat surface, but of course, he’d still check in and make sure Cas was ok. God, his little brother is such a thoughtful and kind person and Dean’s never been more irritated by that than he is now. Of all the times for him to reprise his interrupting moose routine…
“I’ll join you,” Michael said, getting off of the couch and heading towards the door. Castiel closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He put on his shoes and followed after his brother.
“Drink up, boys,” Charlie said, laughing as she took the box off her waist.
Dean looked to the empty towel rack and hung his head.
“Castiel,” he started. The teen rounded on him.
#4 Cas is still pissed at him.
“You’re perfect,” Cas whispered as he caught his breath. After a moment, he slipped out and went to get out of bed to retrieve a washcloth, but Dean stopped him.
“In this economy? You can’t tell me you don’t have a side hustle.”
“So...Kansas?” Balthazar prompted. Castiel sighed and looked at his bare room.
“Where’d you go?” Dean asked in a whisper. Castiel contemplated whether or not to make something up as he pulled off his jeans and crawled into Dean’s bed. The taller boy lifted his arm, allowing Cas to lie under it. Once Cas' back was pressed fully against Dean’s chest, he spoke up.
Gabriel chose a cup and knocked it back, “water,” he complained, “nothing.” Dean leaned forward and selected one.
As they loaded their waffles with syrup, Charlie spoke up, “so where's Cas?”
"Mmm...most definitely. But the real thing is so much better." Cas replied, rising up to kiss Dean again. Dean grinned into the kiss and his hand traveled down to remove Cas's offending pants. Well, technically they were Dean's but either way, he wanted them off.
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean thrusted faster, finally coming as he all but shouted his boyfriend’s name. Dean flopped on his back to the side of Cas, breathing labored. They both had dopey smiles on their faces. Dean rolled onto his side and ran his fingers through Cas’s hopelessly debauched hair.
Dean broke the moment of silence.
Dean poked his husband's side and Cas just laughed.
Dean was furious. How could you treat a child like that? How could Cas' father stand around and not say anything about the way Naomi was talking about his deceased wife? How could he stand there and watch Naomi slap his son, and say nothing about it? Dean also felt bad for Cas. Dean had always had a supportive family. When his father died, their friends and family all got closer and helped them through it. He couldn't imagine how alone Castiel would be feeling.
“Jump in...jump suit...jump up. Wait, shit, it’s three words,” Jo reminded herself. The rest of the group was cracking up and the ever-increasingly frustrated look on Balthazar’s face.
“I’m not seeing a good enough reason to get involved in this,” Balthazar said. Gabriel rolled his eyes.
“So...for the bet...you’re not gonna rat us out, are you?” Dean asked again, having forgotten he’d asked a first time. Balthazar pulled up to his apartment building and put his car in park.
Dean snapped open his eyes and looked around the room. A couple people were sleeping on their beds, he could hear a few others rustling around he kitchen.
“The keys are on my nightstand. Just pick me up for school tomorrow,” Balthazar said casually.
“Just come back home, Castiel. I can talk to Naomi,” his dad offered. Castiel shook his head once again, this time with much more force.
“Alright, your father and I are catching the redeye out to New York city. I still can’t believe we didn’t leave this morning, but what’s done is done. You’re still expected to follow house rules and be back by your curfew if you go out. We’re putting a lot of trust in you with this. Your father just barely talked me out of calling Michael to come spend the weekend with you,” she said. Castiel’s eyebrows shot up. He hadn’t known that. He sent out a silent thank-you to his father.
“How do you think I’m feeling? Shit, why didn’t we do this sooner?” Castiel pulled out and pushed back in slowly, effectively ending their conversation. They moved like that, slowly and carefully for a while, both adjusting to their new position.
"Yeah, well. The world will never be short of bigoted assholes," Dean quipped. "But, yeah. Noah also kind of helped me see that I wanted to be a fireman. Like, I always had this thought in the back of my head that if I could save
Cas had to admit, coming home to an incomplete house proved a little frustrating, especially when he could’ve purchased a fully furnished home. But once Dean was finished with his home-improvements, Cas had to admit that he found the personal additions touching (especially their en suite with a Jacuzzi tub and a double-headed shower. That’s right...a shower with
“Because at Cas’ last job he got the boot for kissin’ me, and at this job Ms. Rosen got the boot for kissin’ Mr. Shurley,” Dean replied. Finally, the dots connected.
“Yeah, I don’t get it either,” he agreed.
"Ok."
Cas could tell that this was the center of the party. The place was packed and Castiel assumed there was an open bar somewhere with the stench in the air. The blond guided them through the crowd, stopping once to grab a couple drinks.
“They fucking better not have,” Dean said, scratching at the back of his neck.
"Maybe," Dean didn't look up from his computer, typing in something on a word document. Cas rolled his eyes.
“Well, I believe we were too busy having sex to talk about my occupation. We haven’t talked about a lot of things. For example, my brothers, Michael and Lucifer run the Holy Hell network on TV. It was weird that an entertainment enterprise didn’t have a television channel, so my father let them develop it.” Cas told him.
“It’s ok, I get where you’re coming from,” Castiel said. There was another long stretch of silence between the two as the next episode played automatically.
“Sam,” Mary said, “come with us.”
On Monday at school, he ranted about Naomi’s intrusiveness to Ash during their computer class. Halfway through Castiel’s rant, Ash interrupted him.
"Do you have a preference on music?" Dean asked. He was trying to be courteous, because he usually just put on rock and told the passenger to shut his cake hole.
“I could ask myself the same thing,” Castiel replied, snuggling in closer.
hit him with that plate before
“It’s ok. I said some shitty things, too. Call it even?”
Dean laughed. “Dude, you just said ‘tickle his fancy’. What year did I time travel into when I stepped in your office?” A broad smile on his face.
has gotten into you?” Castiel stopped on the fifth stair.
As he lay in bed in the dark, his alcoholic buzz faded quickly, and all of his failures that night came to the very front of his mind. The first tear trickled out as he lived through Dean going into that bedroom with Amara over and over. He couldn’t get it out of his mind. With the floodgates opened, he let himself cry. He supposed he was due for a good emotional release, anyway. Castiel shoved his face into his pillow and just let it out.
completely forgotten about her. Which was pretty shitty considering how close they’d gotten in the past couple months. “If it’s any consolation...I haven’t told anyone outside of who was directly involved.”
“Oooh, what about
“So? You can borrow some of mine,” he offered.
Work.
“And how do you think you’re making him feel now, attacking his dad like that?” she reasoned. Dean clenched his jaw and looked down at the ground. “Honey, I know you’re protective, but this is Castiel’s family. They’re gonna have to sort it out on their terms.”
"Rock, paper, scissors!" They shout. And with Dean showing scissors and Sam showing rock, Sam claims the tank on the left.
“Do you feel nauseous at all?” she asked. Cas tried to shake his head, but decided very quickly that that was a bad idea. He was very sore.
“Yes, I know, but my father places him above-“
“Um, I was having dinner. Then I came out. Naomi-” he cut himself off. Yes, he remembered, but he wasn’t quite ready to relive it. Mary nodded her head and gave him a gentle smile.
Five minutes later found Cas setting the table for their dinner.
“Well, there’s snacks in the dining room if you guys get hungry,” Charlie said, going to set up the first game.
Dean could see his boyfriend’s excitement tenting his boxers. He pulled those down as well, Cas’ dick springing out from under the cotton fabric. Dean threw the underwear carelessly on the floor, positioning himself so he could kiss Cas’ stomach, hips, inner thighs. His wet kisses left a trail of sensitive skin to the cold air.
“Hey,” Charlie said as she peeked her head in the door. Dean looked up and gave a strained smile.
“No fucking way,” she whispered to herself. She walked around the couch to get a better look. It was, without a doubt, condom guy. Also known as Cas. And by her surroundings, it was a
“He’s been openly flirting with me. And I am a guy. And I know
"She works at the station. She's the tech lady. Do you think you'll be able to survive until Monday without me?"
“Don’t get smart with me,” Naomi warned. Castiel almost laughed at her choice of words. Now wouldn’t that be a travesty: if Castiel were “smart”. When he didn’t offer her an explanation outright, she prompted, “Well? What do you have to say to that?”
“Naomi?” Mary asked.
“Who is it?” Filtered a (barely) falsetto voice through the door. Cas swung open the door to reveal Dean.
“Why would I even want to? His shitty fucking advice nearly stopped me from even going to college. From getting out of that shitty neighborhood. From ever meeting you in the first place!” Dean was raising his voice now, offended that Castiel would even bring the man up. “I already paid for his shit, Cas. I thought we were done with that.”
"Yes, you were, and I'm still angry at the lack of maturity you showed. God, I felt like I was arguing with a child." Cas said. "A child with a colorful vocabulary," he added a little quieter.
“I didn’t know you were in this class,” Dean said, slightly thrown.
Anna took a moment to think about the best starting place for this conversation. “Thanksgiving,” she said.
He just wasn’t willing to think about any of that at the moment. His current task was procuring alcohol, specifically gin. He found some in the butler’s pantry off the kitchen. After taking one too many pulls off of that, he wandered into the kitchen. Someone tried to pull him into a dance, but he managed to wiggle out of it. He downed another half of a cup of juice and decided to go outside for some fresh air.
want to talk to Balthazar, and I
“And what’s this about?”
"Then why did you name your sons after angels?" Naomi asked.
He was tired of this. Every time she and Cas got into an argument, he would ask what happened and she would make herself the victim. He was ashamed, but he’d be lying if he said he didn’t believe her
“It wasn’t that big of a deal. And you drink
Cas smiled like an idiot at his phone.
“What was what?” Sam deflected.
All three kids perked up at that, not expecting this conversation to be a confessional.
“You think I needed that whole couch to myself?” Charlie asked incredulously. It took Dean a moment to fully understand what she meant, but when he did, he let out a sigh and shook his head disapprovingly.
“Oh! I could suggest bringing a certain dish and you can make a jab at it?” Dean suggested. Castiel didn’t seem to be a fan of that one.
“Um, we can’t...both stay in my room?” Dean asked, having assumed that that was the plan. Mary practically snorted, shaking her head.
Castiel collapsed on top of Dean, unbothered by the mess between them. They lay like that for a while, catching their breath.
He huffed and turned on his heel, grabbing his bag on his way out of the classroom. He didn’t say anything to Gabriel, and hoped his boyfriend could tie it up without revealing their trick.
After two days of only leaving Dean's side for the bathroom and occasional food, Cas was advised to go home and take care of himself.
you were dating. It doesn’t count.” Jo said.
“Technically, no. They’ll figure out tomorrow whether or not it goes to trial,” Sam explained. Dean furrowed his eyebrows.
"I got you something," Dean said as he walked backwards towards his chair, never breaking eye contact with Cas. Dean picked up the box and walked back over to his husband, "I'm sorry," he said as he handed Cas the box.
Castiel smiled lazily up at him. He looked perfect. Sweat accumulating on his skin, almost shimmering in the light of the setting sun. Castiel could die a happy man. Dean leaned down and kissed Castiel for several long moments. When the feeling returned to Castiel’s fingers and toes, he pushed Dean’s shoulder, rolling him onto his back.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean woke up to his ringtone, and tried focusing his eyes on the clock while he answered. It was already noon.
Cas sighed. How was he supposed to plan an accidental encounter if he didn’t know where to do it?
“I don't think so. I haven't seen Michael since Christmas. I'm not sure he even knows our address, let alone who attends my high school,” Castiel said.
the faculty slut,” Dean assured him, “and don’t tell me you don’t love everyone thinking you have a sexy mystery lover.”
“Who has a secret?” Gabe asked as he walked into the room.
“I asked you to do it over an hour ago,” Naomi said, “this is not open for discussion. Vacuum. Now,” she demanded, turning on her heel and striding out of the bedroom. Castiel rolled his eyes and put his earbud back in place.
"What do you mean, unground him?" She shouted. "He's crossed a line and it will not be tolerated!"
"Uh-huh." Cas poked Dean's side and Dean smiled.
“How was your day?” Cas asked. Dean came around from the kitchen table and started to lay down the spider web printed plastic cover on the counter.
Castiel sighed deeply. It really wasn’t too difficult of a request. He could eat one meal with her, especially if his father, Michael, and Anna were there as a buffer. Maybe Bart was right; maybe Naomi was trying to reach out and get to know him. Castiel couldn’t say that he loved her method of doing so, but maybe one meal wouldn’t be so bad after all. He was just about to agree when his phone vibrated next to him on the bed.
Once Cas was satisfied with his smattering of hickeys, he went back up to reunite their lips once again. Dean was hungry for Cas' kisses. He bunched up the back of Cas' shirt, his hands squeezing, itching to be all over his boyfriend. They moved down, collecting the hem of Cas' shirt so he could finally remove it. Cas obliged, lifting his arms when he needed to, only breaking the kiss long enough for Dean to get it off of him.
“Yo, Cas, did anyone ever tell you it’s impolite to have your phone out during a movie?” Asked a certain redhead.
“No, son. You get to get dunked.” Rufus said, his voice the closest to gleeful as Dean had ever heard it. The other man clapped his hand on Dean’s shoulder and wandered around, greeting families.
They went back to sipping their respective drinks and fell into a pleasant conversation. Whenever they fell into silence, it never felt loaded or uncomfortable. Castiel couldn’t remember the last person he felt like this around.
“Damn you guys are pretty good at this,” Charlie commented. She apologized to her teammates when they gave her an exasperated look.
“Cas,” Dean said, looking at Castiel as if he might disappear if he spoke too loud. Castiel clenched his jaw. It’s been five years. Shouldn’t he be over Dean already? He’s had time to recover, he has a boyfriend now. So why didn’t he go home with Joseph?
Once inside he let out a deep breath. He looked down and noticed his hands were trembling. He didn’t regret a word he said to Naomi, but he hated the look his father had on his face when he told him to go to his room. Castiel was not looking forward to the “talk” they were going to have.
“Yep, we’re gonna go downstairs now,” he interrupted, grabbing Cas' hand and leading them towards his room. Cas raised an eyebrow but decided not to pry. The boys set their backpacks down and Dean flopped onto his bed. Castiel just shook his head and went towards the futon under the window.
“Where have you been?” Castiel asked, obviously worried, “the snow is really coming down now, I kept imagining you in a ditch somewhere just-” Dean cut him off by wrapping his arms around Cas’ neck. Castiel hugged back immediately, burying his face in Dean the crook of Dean’s neck.
. He felt like he was letting
“I literally
“Excuse me?” Jo said.
“I love you, too. Goodnight, Dean.”
“Yeah. Hey, what are you eating?” Dean asked.
“Oh, no you don’t!” Dean yelled after him. He scooped up some snow and chased after Cas. He caught up and shoved some down the back of Cas' sweater. The younger boy shrieked at the frigidness. He whipped around, his eyes ablaze as they centered on Dean.
“Um, I-I think you need to contact my dad...have him deal with the medical...stuff. I don’t really know. But...Anna, please don’t let Naomi know where I am. I can’t...please,” Castiel begged. Anna was quick to assure him that she had absolutely no desire to involve Naomi.
gets to take home the bottle,” Castiel countered.
“You’re WHAT?” Balthazar screamed. “You can’t be! You’ve almost completed your junior year, they can’t pluck you up and drop you in some other school for your senior year!” He protested further. “It’s not fair to-"
Castiel just laughed. “Only slightly. Thank god it’s Friday,” he replied, getting up and walking towards his backpack. He picked it up and slung it over his shoulder. Debating whether he should, then ultimately deciding he
Cas whispered something to Aiden before leaning down and giving him a peck on the forehead as well. Cas walked out of the boy's room and Dean shut the door before turning towards Cas. He took his boyfriend's hand and detoured to shut the TV off before heading to the bedroom.
One day after school, Castiel stopped by Dean’s room to ask him what he needed from the store, and if they wanted to plan out a few dinners in advance.
The next morning, Cas woke up to wet kisses along his neck.
“What the hell?”
Today had been a particularly warm day, and Castiel had been craving something cold and sweet since lunch. He pulled out his phone and texted his boyfriend.
“Me and Balthazar are friends, Dean. Just because I moved doesn’t change that fact,” Castiel said.
“Anna. I’m looking for Castiel. He left his phone here, and I’m worried about him. Is he with you?”
“What?” Charlie asked, “What do you mean? You were going on and on about her just yesterday!”
Dean opened his mouth to argue before he shut it and seemed to register what his little brother said. It’s not like Mary was standing guard; he really could just walk out.
Dean stepped up to Cas with a grin.
Sensing his boyfriend’s confusion, Dean spoke up.
Castiel said. Dean looked over at Charlie and the two shared a confused look.
Cas woke up to the sounds of sniffling in the bathroom. He turned to look at the clock, blinking several times to try to clear the fuzz that seemed to have glazed over his eyes. Once it cleared, he could see the clock that read 5:48. It was still early, but he couldn't fall back asleep with those noises coming from behind the bathroom door. All in a rush the night before came back to him. The fighting, the words, the anger. He flung back the sheets and padded over to the door, knocking quietly.
kidding me?” he shouted, leaving the two idiots in favor of getting some fresh air in the backyard. Both boys stared after Castiel, watching him exit the back door onto the patio.
“Oh, honey, you don't have to do that, I'll be fine on my own,” Mary said.
“How long ago was what? The last time we had sex?” Castiel asked bluntly. Dean blushed and grabbed the back of his neck.
“Have fun with
"Oh, shit dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get you all sad." Dean looks over at the back of Cas's head. Dean reaches over and grabs Cas's hand, intertwining their fingers.
The boys began at a relatively good pace, balancing the nuts with ease.
“I’m sorry,” Cas whispered. He just couldn’t bring himself to explain any further. Castiel felt Dean nod against his own head. They kissed once more before Cas turned back around to resume his position as the little spoon.
“And I’d appreciate it if you kept my name out of your lectures!” he said sternly. Dean was confused for only a moment before he looked over and saw Gabriel enter his room. Dean set his jaw and stood up out of his chair.
“It’s my stupid tie!”
“How about we grab something to eat? I’m starving,” Balthazar said, picking up on the discomfort Cas was feeling after he had brought up Naomi. Cas nodded, and they went out in search of food.
. They shared a
Balthazar still couldn’t believe he let Dean talk him into suggesting this game. That man owed him, bigtime.
When they reached Balthazar’s floor, the boys removed their shoes before the brit took Cas' hand and led them to his room. There, he shut the door and removed his shirt before flopping onto his queen sized mattress.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean yelled out as he entered their apartment, shrugging off his jacket and unlacing his boots. “Sorry I’m late, I was-” Dean’s explanation died on his tongue as he took in the sight before him.
gotten into an argument, Dean never should’ve left Cas stranded at a party.
“Oh, I’ll get you back,” Dean promised. They kissed for a few more minutes before finally settling down. They got under the covers and cuddled up together.
. Dean sighed in resignation.
of me, then…” Bart trailed off, not quite able to say the words out loud.
To his surprise, he had a text from Charlie.
“Castiel, don’t be ridiculous,” Michael tried to reason. Cas let go of Anna’s hands and stood from his bed.
The last ping pong ball in the box was expelled by none other than Charlie, the host celebrating by giving Balthazar the middle finger.
Dean smirked as he shot out of the opening gate. He timed his power up perfectly, and he was now in front of the pack. He grinned as he received a random item. Three green shells. He could work with that. Wario tried passing him, but with an armored nudge, Peach had Wario spinning out and falling off the edge. He was able to maintain his lead as he finished his first lap.
said she could make it. I hadn’t even had time to ask,” Balthazar insisted.
. With lovely fantasies of himself in a dorm room, he swung the front door open and was met with two smiling faces.
“It means that I asked him what the

opened up to you and that’s what you say? ‘I’m not your mom’? Seriously? That was really personal information, Dean."
"Well, because you-"
“Bartholomew,” she started, the first hint of a genuine emotion he had seen on her face in a long time, “we both know I’m not one for heavy lifting,” she said solemnly. Bart gave a watery smile that quickly betrayed him. He placed his hand over his wife’s on his face as a tear slipped down his cheek.
“Hey, babe, guess what!” Dean started excitedly as he entered their shared apartment. He kicked off his shoes and hung up his jacket. As he walked into the living room where his boyfriend was sitting, he answered his own question, “I got the job at Middlefield High School!”
“Ok, so what did you want to talk about?” the redhead asked, sliding over to the next computer and typing away at that one.
“No,” Dean restated, “I didn’t.”
The pair made their way back to the Winchester house, Dean honest-to-God
“Castiel,” Bartholomew said gently, trying to calm his son down.
“Look, I’ll get straight to the point,” Castiel started, never the one for small talk, “Have you been speaking with your father again?”
voice starting to tell me bad things, too. I was holding the knife on my wrist, ready to cut a long, vertical line when a knock on the door made me jump. I ended up giving myself this scar,” he said, rolling up the sleeve on his left arm to reveal a cut about five inches long, “my mom was the one that had opened my door. She screamed, I looked down at all the blood on my arm, and that’s the last thing I remembered before I passed out,” Alfie said.
“Dean,” he said happily, “I was jus’ talkin’ ‘bout you.”
Dean huffed, “He’s more our family than his. At least we actually give a shit about him.”
Anna assumed she was speaking to Dean, who let out a short laugh,
“You better wipe that smile off before I wipe it for you,” Dean threatened sitting up on his bed and facing Sam as the younger boy took a seat on the futon.
“I’ll take a chocolate shake,” Dean said, choosing to go with his go-to choice. Cas nodded and looked over the menu one more time.
,” she explained, reaching for the bottle of wine to refill her glass. Castiel smiled...maybe Anna
With Balthazar, sex was just a form of relief. Relief of stress, relief of aggression, relief of teenage hormones.
“Gotcha,” Dean whispered into his ear before thrusting into him, pressing him impossibly close to the wall. Castiel let out a cross between a moan and a whimper.
“For listening to me cry about my mom like some sort of baby,” Castiel answered despondently, averting his eyes.
to do about it?”
“Good morning Dean,” Castiel greeted from the couch, a yawn taking over the last syllable of the sentence.
"Ew, first the kitchen, now the living room? Is it your personal goal to gross me out?" Dani complains from the recliner.
"Now, how do I want to do this?" He asked. "I could lay beside you and open myself up while we continue to make out. Or I could lay on the opposite side of the bed and give you a show," Cas suggested, playing each scenario out in his mind.
Castiel had been a well behaved child all his life, but something - no
Hope you like game nights, because this isn't the last one ;)
Cas made sure he didn’t linger too long on his boyfriend, instead zoning back into what his colleague was saying.
“You rigged the seating arrangement so Cas would have to sit next to me.” Dean stated more than asked.
“Alright,” Castiel said, smelling the alcohol on Dean’s breath, “I think somebody needs to go home.”
that?” Castiel asked back. They had just gotten those tests back on the last day of school before break. And it’s not like he failed; the teacher had told them that this test was going to be the hardest of the year, so he was actually pretty happy with his grade.
In the lobby, Dean watched as Naomi left with an officer. He connected the dots and jumped into action. He had to go see Cas. Before he could get too far, Mary stopped him.
“That’s...oddly specific. Why not?” Dean asked. The boys moved back into Dean’s room and they both flopped down on the bed.
It was a Monday in every sense of the word. Dean woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Late. Which was a wonder because the buzzing of his alarm was giving him a headache. He fumbled around blindly until he found that awful machine. He slammed the snooze button and dragged himself out of bed. Oh how he wished he could burrow back under the covers and continue his blissful unconsciousness.
shared a bed on many occasions...but those occasions were a bit different. Castiel awkwardly crawled under the covers, and made sure to stay as close to the edge as possible. Just as he was plugging his phone in, he received a text.
“Why did you go in that bedroom with Amara?” Castiel shot back. He smirked to himself, satisfied with his comeback. He looked back to his bed and thought to himself that it actually seemed like a very nice place to be. He’d had quite a bit of alcohol and he’d been
“Nothing. Just...forget about it,” Dean said dismissively. Charlie wasn’t taking that for an answer. She conveyed that to him through her signature
Dean slid off of the bed and walked towards the open bathroom. He went up to a sink and splashed some cold water on his face. He jumped when he heard Jo’s teasing voice.
“Well, since both teams are tied 2-2, we’ll play one more as a tie-breaker,” Charlie announced. “This one is called the Cup of Fun.”
ago and
“Does it work for everyone else?” Dean checked.
"Why me? Why can’t you do it?"
"That’s ok. If your free tomorrow, we could do it after I get off work." Dean smiled. “That’d be awesome, Cas. Um, does like seven work? I remember how to get to your place so I’ll see you then. I have to get back to the lot before Jo hot-wires my car and drives back herself.”
Dean came with a shout, Castiel following with his second orgasm of the night not long after. Once they had cleaned up, Castiel’s head found its favorite spot on Dean’s shoulder.
They stood there, pressed close together as they traded hungry kisses. Castiel was getting feisty, biting at Dean’s bottom lip. The older boy smiled as he grinded against Cas, feeling just how excited his boyfriend was through his dress slacks. Dean kissed along Cas’ jaw and down to his neck, trying to start a hickey, but moving on when Castiel pushed him lower.
"Clean the house!" Charlie all but shouted. "But that's not enough. Buy him something. Like...has he mentioned anything he's really wanted?"
He slicked his fingers up and thrust his index into Castiel’s waiting hole. Cas groaned, biting his own lip. This was harsher than Dean usually was, but fuck if it wasn’t turning him on. Cas pushed back onto Dean’s finger, opening himself up. Dean leaned forward and smothered Cas’ shoulders in open-mouthed kisses.
“He seemed rather distracted that morning. I think he was stressed about his evaluation.”
“Castiel I am not guilting you into-”
Dean nodded and took a swig of his beer.
Holy shit, he was gorgeous.
Castiel made a face and defended, “It would get me away from Naomi. And I don’t know how the legal stuff will shake out. What if I have to go back there with her? Or I get sent to a-a foster home or something? At least if I take the deal, I’ll have a place to live and some money.”
Dean was
, he thought bitterly,
“May I?” he asked. Castiel nodded and the older brother tied the silk correctly. He smiled and clapped his younger brother on the shoulder. Castiel gave a tight smile in return, and they climbed into the car together.
“Apply pressure to the cut, but don’t move his head,” she instructed. She opened a pack of sterile wipes and cleaned the drying blood off of his face. She checked him for any other injuries, but found none. Cas was without shoes and his socks were soaking wet, but as she peeled off his socks, she didn’t see any signs of frostbite. She took the gauze out of her son’s hand and starting to clean the cut.
"Have fun, don't get too drunk," Cas advised him. Dean laughed and said he wouldn't before heading out the door.
Cas kept his sights on Peach's pink motorcycle. He was able to dart ahead to second place in no time. As he approached his second lap, he was blindsided by a red shell. He groaned in frustration as he watched Toad fall off the edge. When he was replaced on the map, he had dropped down to 7th place! He needed a miracle. The next item cube he crashed into gave him just that. He smirked as he used his power up, turning his character into a speeding bullet, taking out characters left and right. To Cas's satisfaction, Bowser just so happened to be one of those characters. At the end of the bullet' run, he had managed to make up a lot of lost ground. He returned to second place.
“So Castiel’s father picked him up?” Mary asked from the living room. Dean finished climbing the stairs and took a seat on the couch.
Cas finally took his eyes off of his computer and stared, dumbfounded, at Dean’s spiel.
“You’re just like your mom,” he said quietly, “couldn’t take a compliment for shit,” he chuckled.
Castiel nodded as much as he could with Mary’s hand on his cheek. She turned his head gently this way and that, her concern for Cas causing the teen to break down into tears.
that would make me have respect for you? All you’ve done for me was make my life a living HELL since the moment you started seeing my father!”
“I’m seriously not in the mood. I
“Cas?”
"Ok, now that we’ve played a game, the real fun starts. Now we have rankings. It goes in the order you ran out of cards. I’m president, Jo is vice, Benny is speaker, Gabe is vice scum, and Meg is scum."
Dean wasted no time wriggling his wrists so he could grab a fistful of Castiel’s hair. Cas returned his focus to his thrusts as Dean finally found purchase. In an absolutely wrecked voice, Dean encouraged Castiel, saying some of the filthiest things he’s ever said in bed. Dean could tell Cas was getting close when the man whimpered into his ear. And, yeah, ok, that was undeniably hot. Dean in his oversensitivity, clenched around Cas even harder as a second orgasm ripped through his body. He really pulled at Cas’ dark locks, and between Dean’s dirty talk, his tightness, and the hands in his hair, Castiel came harder than he thought he ever had in his life. A deep groan accompanied his climax, his hips stilling as he pulsed into Dean.
Both men were surprised when the door opened and Charlie walked in. Castiel immediately removed his headphones and gave her a questioning look.
“Don’t be unrealistic, Balthazar. She’d never call me ‘honey’,” he quipped. They laughed at the thought of that conversation.
With his drink in hand, he ducked out of the kitchen and retreated back to Dean’s bedroom. He felt a little guilty about commandeering Dean’s room, but Mary wouldn’t hear anything about Castiel sleeping on a couch. So, for the time being, Dean was crashing in the den.
About an hour later, Sam and Alfie climbed into the car after their classes ended; they knew instantly that Dean wasn’t happy.
He observed his barely recognizable boyfriend. There were tubes everywhere, bandages were wrapped around his head. His face was covered in bruises. He looked awful. Castiel took his hand and leaned his head on Dean's arm.
Once he poured everyone some tequila (whistling the entire time he was doing so), Gabriel raised his glass to give a toast, “to destroying friendships, one game at a time!”
"That's a whole entire day and a half." Cas mock whined. He gave a half smile. "You better get your shoes on. You wouldn't want to be late for your date," Cas said, Dean stood up and pulled Cas with him. The shorter man wrapped his arms around Dean in a hug.
“Or I’ll have to do this,” in one fell swoop, Balthazar wrapped an arm around Castiel’s back and kissed him hard. Castiel closed his eyes and relished this moment. He knew that he might never get a moment like this with Balthazar again. They jumped apart when they heard footsteps climbing up the stairs.
"Shit, Cas, I promised Charlie I'd grab dinner with her tonight."
"Hi, Balthazar."
Needless to say, Dean was not in a good mood when he arrived at his coworker’s house.
are the adult! He’s seventeen, and there is
Castiel’s arms were draped on Dean’s shoulders, tightening as they moved together. Cas pressed himself against Dean as he bounced up and down, his cock trapped between them. From this angle, Dean wasn’t able to do much beyond kneel there and enjoy the ride - which he did...thoroughly. Cas was angelic like this, moving above him and taking so much pleasure from his cock.
“Naomi?” he asked, obviously confused, “What are you-how did you-”
Charade
“Yeah, well at least I didn’t lose the very first game of the night,” he shot back. “How about we make our little head-to-head more interesting?” Dean rolled his eyes.
“Your match-making not working out the way you wanted it to?” Gabriel teased.
“That’s Anna,” Michael said, “she is a feisty one, I tell you what. But she does keep me in line,” he said.
trying to beat out of his chest. He took the stairs one by one and eventually found himself in the kitchen.
“Benny!” Dean said, a smile on his face.
“That was great.” Cas said drowsily.
"Dad, it's Saturday. I was just dropped off by Sarah's mom. You know, because I spent the night there?"
Dean was obviously just being nice, there was no reason for him to point that out. And now Dean looked a little crestfallen and slightly embarrassed. Great. Before Castiel could stammer out an apology, the teacher addressed the class.
," Cas mocked in a high pitched voice, "just kiss me, Winchester," he growled. Dean wasted no time complying. He threaded his fingers through Cas's hair and kissed the breath out of both of them. Cas reacted by grinding their hips together, letting Dean know that Cas was just as excited about these turn of events.
"What are you doing home?" He asked, checking his watch. "Has Naomi keeled over?" He joked.
“No, I’ll go. Can I crash at your house tonight?” Dean asked.
“Sleep first,” Cas mumbled, dozing off on Dean’s chest. Dean smiled and kissed the top of his boyfriend’s head. He could do that.
“No,” Castiel said. A small amount of relief passed through Alfie’s red-rimmed eyes.
"Cas, this is Jo. A fellow firefighter."
with hickeys on
“I am so sorry about what happened back in Chicago. I never got the chance to apologize, and I feel incredibly bad for it -
As if on cue, Charlie popped her head into the classroom.
“What, you can’t handle one little joke?” he challenged. Gabriel, in fear that one of his coworkers was going to punch the other, stepped in.
"Ok," Dean hung his head and went back downstairs.
It took an embarrassingly long time to remember. Dean was already at home in his bed before it hit him. He was going to Cas’s later that night. Suddenly he didn’t feel so tired. He hopped out of bed and into the shower. After getting clean, he forwent replacing his contacts and put on his black framed glasses instead. He usually didn’t wear them in public, but around the house he had no objections towards them. He moseyed out into his bedroom and walked into his closet. What the
“What do you want?” Dean asked, already over this entire interaction. Sam’s demeanor shifted, his words coming about a bit more timid.
“Nice to see you with clothes on, hot stuff,” she said with a wink. Cas’s face grew red.
“A girlfriend?” Dean asked rather loudly. Balthazar stared at him and lifted an eyebrow. “I’m happy for you, Balthazar! I know you’ve been looking for someone to fill your time,” Dean went on, a look between pleading and triumph warring across his face.
When he did, Castiel could see stars. He let out a loud moan, his breath hitching and becoming more ragged by the second. Dean kept pounding in at that angle, Castiel powerless to stop him. Dean nuzzled into his neck and nipped at the sensitive skin.
He put on his shoes and jacket, and the pair left the Winchester household. Charlie excitedly chattered next to him about the upcoming semester, but Dean really wasn’t present. She seemed to understand and continued to keep talking at him, accepting the occasional ‘uh-huh’ and head nod. Dean was grateful she at least wasn’t forcing him to talk.
"Mmm, gonna tie me up, huh?" Dean asked cheekily. "What else are ya gonna do?" He asked.
it,” Castiel tried to reason.
"Good morning starshine," Dean said he placed another kiss to Cas's lips and pulled back again, "the earth says hello,". Cas raised an eyebrow and Dean laughed.
"Where the hell did I put those things?" Dean says aloud. Cas can't help but smile at Dean's distressed features, and can't get it under control when Dean turns to look at him.
“How the hell have you never heard of night games?” he all but shouted. Castiel put his hands up in defence.
“I love you,” Dean professed. Cas snuggled closer to his boyfriend.
“Upstairs?” he questioned. There were only two bedrooms upstairs and those were occupied by his parents and...oh no. She wasn’t seriously implying….
Dean sighed. “Would you please stop calling him that? His name’s Cas.
“We got into a pretty big fight today. He kicked me out.” Cas said, pinching between his eyebrows with his index and thumb.
“I told him that I didn’t have time to cuddle with him.” Cas said ashamedly.
These questions and more circled around his head so fast, he wasn’t able to hold on to a single one long enough to ask it. He also couldn’t handle his father just staring at him like that.
“Mmm, why are you still wearing clothes, darling?” Castiel asked as he pulled at Dean’s shirt. Dean wiggled out of his overshirt and helped Cas take off the t-shirt underneath.
“Whatever. But just so you know, I don’t really like this Cas guy,” Gabe snarled.
“So, what subject did you get?” Cas asked.
"I will give you one more chance to say the right thing," she said, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath.
Castiel nodded, and reached into his pants pocket to find it empty. Then, he remembered that he had left his phone in his room before dinner. He brought his hands to his face to conceal the tear or two that slipped out.
“The presents. Those weren’t all from you guys,” Castiel said.
"Anything but rap. I can’t stand rap." Castiel deadpanned. Dean laughed and put on some AC/DC.
“Ok,” Bart finally acquiesced, “but if you change your mind, you know where to find us,” he stood up and clapped his hand on his son’s knee before making his exit.
"You did something WORSE than accuse him of cheating? Do you realize how gone you guys are on each other? What the hell were you thinking, Dean Winchester!?" Charlie was pacing now, taking turns at glaring at Dean and the ground, trying to figure out how stupid her friend was.
“And then what? What do I say to them?”
“It’s a toss up between
“Your dad owns Godsend?” Dean asked incredulously. “How has that not come up?”
“Who gives a shit Dean?!” Charlie interrupted. “He accidentally punched his best friend in the face! He’s probably apologizing,” she tried to reason. “I have literally never seen you like this, and I’ve been by your side through some pretty serious shit. So what gives?”
“I’m tinkering with a new hot chocolate recipe,” Sam said, indirectly inviting Charlie inside and away from those two idiots.
“And how do you expect me to bet against this debonair casanova?” Gabriel asked. Balthazar chuckled and threw his arm around the shorter man. The redhead had just about had it with these two, and it wasn’t even eight in the morning.
“You said ‘me and her’ but it’s ‘she and I’,” Castiel explained.
Castiel watched as Dean belted out these notes, the quality and pitch so perfect, Castiel knew they were made just for him. He remembered the day he and Dean broke up.
They hung up and Dean finished off his cereal before muddling around, waiting for Cas.
"Hey, bug." He whispered to his sleeping eight-month-old. "Daddy really fucked up tonight." Dean said quietly as he flopped down in the recliner next to the crib. He leaned back and covered his face with his hand. "I'm so stupid. What is wrong with me, Dani? Why do I always mess up so horribly?" He asked softly. "I just wish Daddy and Papa could talk this out, bug. I didn't mean any of it, I hope he knows that. I hope he knows they were just empty words spoken out of frustration. I hope he knows I still love him...no matter what." Dean leaned forward, cupping his face in his hands. He honestly thought he might be sick.
Balthazar smiled and basked in the triumph of getting his friend out on the town
“Growing up, I was taught that misbehavior earned disciplinary action. It’s about time you learned a lesson,”  Naomi said sternly. Castiel took a step back. Sure, he’d been threatened with the ruler before, but it was never this serious. She had never actually been holding one.
“Why not?” Castiel challenged.
“Right,” he whispered, capturing Cas' lips in his once more before exiting his bedroom and walking towards the bathroom.
“I’m sure you’re overreacting,” Michael modulated.
“You’re right. I should be happy I even have a job at all. 24 and unemployed was bad enough, I wasn’t shooting for 25. These past few months have been...awful,” he admitted with a laugh.
“Woah, Charlie...did you...did you do all of this?” he asked.
“So you really thought me and Charlie were a thing?” Dean asked, chuckling at the mere thought.
Anna rubbed a soothing hand up and down Michael’s back. She
Dean let out a deep breath and the tension bled out of his shoulders. He looked in the direction of their bedroom and finished his food halfheartedly before clearing everything off the table. He knew he was acting kinda shady, but he wasn’t cheating on Cas. He’d have to be the absolute dumbest piece of shit on Earth to do that...again. And he fucking paid for the first time! It wasn’t fair that Castiel got to bring it up whenever he thought things weren’t perfect. Dean had grown up a lot since then, and he didn’t deserve to have it thrown back in his face.
Castiel packed up his things and made his way towards the parking lot. After reaching his car, he shivered as he unlocked the door and hopped inside. Turning the key in the ignition, his car started making very curious noises.
“I’m tired of waiting around for my money,” Gabriel complained.
“That could work. I’m interested to see how she’d handle the party if she thought we were in the middle of a fight,” Cas said. “So what do we want to fight about?”
“Uh, yeah. Sure,” he said. He racked his mind for any reason why he wouldn’t be free, but he came up empty. There was a lingering thought that he might be forgetting something, but he chalked that up to the nerves of his evaluation. He knew that he really shouldn’t be this worried; he was a decent teacher, and he had gotten most of the kids to actually engage with the material. He was just worried because this was the first time he’d be evaluated at a full-time job.
They switched over to the act-it-out category once everyone had the chance to be the guesser for the animal category. Jo’s team had 21 points, while Charlie’s took the early lead with 26. They took a moment to refill their cups and grab some snacks.
” Dean trailed off, leaning in to finally capture Cas’ lips with his own. The English teacher sighed into it, wrapping one hand around Dean’s neck as he deepened the kiss. After a few long moments, Castiel pulled away.
Castiel whined in displeasure, but stood up anyway, stepping out of the tub. Dean smiled as he looked at the dark purple mark on his boyfriend’s ass.
entered.
“See you tomorrow.”
“I just asked how you liked it here so far.”
“Ok! Uh, Cas, please just...“ Dean drops his head into his hands. He can’t listen to any more of this. Maybe that makes him a coward but, Jesus.
The bracelet is new, though.
“Dean, these hunters have no idea,” he said, pacing by the war room table as Cas and Dean looked on bemused. “The simple stuff we take for granted.”
He’d already given the amulet to Cas for his pointless mission to find God, everything around him was going to hell - it was the goddamn apocalypse. Not like his body was his own anyway; Michael had already put down a deposit to reserve it for the prom. Why bother dressing it up for him?
“He must have taken it off before he agreed to say yes to me,” Cas continues.  “The significance of that would never have occurred to me at the time, but now…” he trails off, rubbing the skin on his ring finger.
“It’s not your fault, Sammy. That’s just the job. Sometimes you eat the bear, sometimes the bear eats you.”
Dean glared at him. “Sam, it’s 3 am! Can we do this in the fucking morning?”
Cas pauses for a moment, looking down at his hands. “Jimmy used to have a strip on this finger that was paler than the rest of his skin. I never gave it much thought back then, but it must have been from his wedding ring.”
He’s serious about that. Despite his recent forays into the world of fashion, Cas has thus far refused to wear a single scrap of flannel. Dean had tried to tell him that, for a hunter, that was tantamount to sacrilege, but Cas had been entirely unfazed.
“Maybe we uh…maybe we try to do better now,” Dean says hesitantly, watching Cas. “Maybe we just do the best we can. It won’t fix anything that’s happened in the past, but for the folks that are still around…” He trails off. The people that are still around, deserve better.
Cas is still staring at him. “Yes,” he says slowly, “like that. I’ve been told that when someone tries to read my thoughts, all they seem to pick up are colours. I suppose that hasn’t changed since I lost my grace.”
“Ok, good. Don’t be a dick about it, Dean.”
The case turns out to be trickier than they’d expected, and it takes Sam and Cas almost a week to track the monster down and deal with it. Sam fills him in on everything that’s going on, but he hasn’t heard much from Cas, other than a few perfunctory replies to some of his texts.
Dean looks up, quirking an eyebrow at Cas, and next thing he knows, Cas is leaning in, one hand resting lightly against the nape of his neck, and the other cupping his jaw. He stops inches away from Dean’s face and just stares at him. Dean’s never had the intensity of those blue eyes focused on him from this close and it’s more than a little overwhelming. Turns out that’s not an angel thing, just a Cas thing.
“So how did it know how to target you? No offence, dude, but it’s not like you’re exactly easy to read.” Dean deserves a medal for saying that with a straight face because damn if that ain’t one hell of an understatement.
“Essentially, yes,” Cas says, looking impressed. “Though, if you want to be more specific it - ”
Cas raises an eyebrow. “In that case, we should continue to discuss this at another time when we are less likely to be interrupted by whatever random unsuspecting family member happens to be wandering around. I do have more to say.”
Dean reaches out for Cas’ hand where it’s still lying on the table, rubbing his thumb over the battered silver band on Cas’ finger. It means something that he took it. That he’s wearing it. Maybe not the same thing that Jimmy’s ring used to mean; what he and Cas have is something different, something so incomprehensible Dean’s been afraid of what it would do to him if he looked too closely at it.
“Out with it, Sam. What’s going on?”
Sam scoffs before turning around and marching to his bedroom. Dean lets the smile drop from his face, pausing in the hallway for a minute.
3 MESSAGES FROM CAS
“So yes, between Sam’s overly saccharine gift suggestions and this,” Cas continues, holding up his hand and pointing to the ring, “it assumed I was married to a man named Dean and proceeded accordingly.”
“Dean, I’ve been around for billions of years. I saw humanity come to be, watched over the earth for millennia. In all that time, there’s no one else I’ve ever wanted to 'do this whole thing' with. It never even occurred to me to want it before you, and I must admit, after you…” Cas grins wryly. “You seem to be unaware of this, Dean, but you cast a rather formidable shadow. It would be cruel to try to force anyone else to live in it.”
“How dare you?" Dean gasps, eyes widened in mock outrage. "When am I ever a dick?”
Dean doesn’t respond, just looks at Cas. They sit there for a moment before Cas sighs, rubbing a hand over his face.
“Sirens are a bitch,” Dean ventures, watching Cas over the rim of his glass. “Believe me, I know. They get in your head, read your mind - “
“I’m not sure; I wasn’t there for a lot of it. We really didn’t see the guy coming. You know, a surprising amount of people flirt with Cas on a daily basis,” Sam says, the ghost of a smile appearing on his face. “I used to think he never picked up on it, but I think, for the most part, he just chooses to ignore it.”
“Wait what?” Dean puts down his glass, confused.  “Sam said it got to you, at least I thought that’s what he said…he definitely implied it, I think…”
Dean snorts. Cas is such a dick, sometimes.
“Yeah, ok...” Dean's a little confused. It’s not like he doesn’t understand that hunts don’t always go the way you plan, but it was just a Lamia. They can be a pain in the ass to deal with, but that doesn’t exactly seem like something that would warrant an urgent, late-night heart-to-heart.
But Cas doesn’t need to hear that right now.
“I mean you know me, Cas. Better than anyone.”
“Hey,” he says, reaching out to grab Cas’ arm. “Look at me.”
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas says with such sincerity that you’d swear Dean had given him something important rather than a cheap old ring covered in scratches from when he used to use it to pop open bottle caps.
Cas laughs. It’s not a laugh so much as a small smile accompanied by an exhale, but Dean will take it. “I do. I find I’m able to parse out your feelings on pretty much everything except for when it comes to me. Too much personal investment there, I suppose.”
Cas looks at him carefully for a moment before sliding the ring on. Looking down, he smiles. “I like it.”
“It couldn’t read my mind.”
A few weeks ago, Sam had come home from a hunt with Max Banes, buzzing off of cheap gas station coffee and a new life mission.
Dean smiles to himself as he types his response.
Dean stares at the screen until it goes dark. He knows he’s in so far over his head with this whole thing and that there are a hundred different ways he could still mess it up, but he also knows with a certainty he’s rarely felt before, that he’s not going to.
But he’s looking now, and it doesn’t seem so complicated anymore.
“Honey, you’re home!” he calls out, walking up the steps and dropping down into a chair beside Cas.
Dean had seen how Jimmy looked at Amelia. He’d loved her too much to ever disrespect her like that.
“Dean, when have we ever done anything the way it was supposed to be done? That’s pretty much the only reason we’re here in the first place,” Cas says, sounding amused. “Though, there are a couple of steps we missed that I would very much like to circle back to.”
“I know I’m not a monster. I know that I never meant to cause harm to Jimmy. I thought I was doing God’s work, fighting for the greater good, but that doesn’t change what happened. Or the price he paid.”
“You have to know how much you fucking mean to me.”
There’s no other alternative, though. Losing yourself in anger and guilt won’t change anything; all it’ll do is perpetuate an endless cycle of rage and drag the people you love, the ones you should be protecting, into your pointless crusade.
Sam grimaces, the straps of his duffel slipping down over his shoulder as he turns to greet Dean. “Yeah, you have no idea. We handled it but…Well, you know.”
Cas squints at him. “But it’s yours?”
Sam stands in the archway, looking between the two of them. If he has any sense of what they were just up to, he doesn’t let on. “Yeah, I was, but I figured I’d join you two for a nightcap before I turned in.”
“Like how you still hear angel radio sometimes?”
Dean doesn’t say anything. They may not talk about what went down with Jimmy, but that doesn’t mean Dean doesn’t notice how much it still haunts Cas. Cas is pretty good at hiding how he feels a lot of the time, but Dean’s learned to see the cracks in his stoic facade.
Dean makes a noise of protest - why the fuck was Cas spilling his secrets to that asshat anyway? -  but Cas waves him down.
Cas is ignoring the tomes in front of him, choosing instead to focus on the braided leather bracelet around his wrist, a look of intense concentration on his face as he stares down at it.
Dean has to laugh at that. “Yeah, you never do, do you?” Because Cas is selfless and good and god, why the fuck is he here? Why does he bother? He can do so much better and yet he’s voluntarily hitched his wagon to Dean fucking Winchester and is expecting absolutely nothing in return. What could he possibly be getting out of any of this?
Dean’s going to kill Sam. No, that’s not good enough - Jack will just bring the asshole back. He’ll give him a perm while he’s sleeping. Or buy him a subscription to that clown fetish magazine he saw once in that Gas n’ Sip in Iowa.
“Why did you stop?” Cas asks looking through the various trinkets.
“Not me,” Sam says evenly.
Dean groans inwardly. Sam’s never going to let him live this one down. He can already hear the jabs:
“Ok, but why didn’t you -” Dean pauses. “Did it go after you?”
Cas complies but Dean can tell he really doesn’t want to.
“It’s not like I wear it anymore.” Dean shrugs. “It's fine.”
It’s not like Dean had spent years watching out for the signs that Cas was about to run out and do something stupid. Or like he spent endless hours analysing every tiny move Cas had made and wondering if there was any way he could have stopped him.
“So, really branching out with your new style now, huh?” Dean asks, swinging his legs over the edge of his bed to face Cas.
Right now, Cas is slumped over in the chair wearing sweatpants and a Sinéad O'Connor t-shirt. Dean had tried to talk him out of buying it, but he’d just rolled his eyes and said, “I enjoy her, Dean,'' and clicked the button for next day delivery.
Cas looks like there’s nothing he wants to do less, but his desire to not talk about whatever the hell went down is warring with his confidence in Sam’s ability to keep it a secret from Dean. From the defeated look on his face, Dean knows which one wins out.
They had both started the day in nice, clean suits, but as the day wore on, they became more and more disheveled. Their jackets were the first to be discarded, stopping only when their sleeves had been rolled up and Dean’s tie somehow ended up around his head. The couple was lying on the hammock Bartholomew had insisted on getting the first weekend they had at the house. Castiel was skeptical about the piece of outdoor furniture, but after actually trying it out, he had to say his father was right.
is an ‘uh-rain-ment’,” Dean retorted. Sam rolled his eyes.
“Hey, hey, calm down, deep breaths, c’mon,” Dean soothed. When he heard his boyfriend’s breathing return to normal, he continued, “do you need to get away for awhile? You’re welcome to come here,” he offered. He heard Cas sigh on the other end of the line.
Not only was he hit so hard in the head he had to go to the ER, but now his father was trying to convince him to lie so that Naomi wouldn’t even get in trouble for sending him there!
went to church before his father married Naomi, and now Bart would act like it was the highlight of his week.
“Mmmmm, Dean,” Castiel whined, and holy shit, Dean could listen to that all day long. It wasn’t long before Castiel’s breath became labored and Dean knew his boyfriend was getting close. He picked up his pace and encouraged Castiel by humming around his cock, sending vibrations up Castiel’s spine. With a whimper and the nails on his right hand digging into Dean’s shoulder, Castiel came, shaking through his orgasm. Dean pulled off and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
Cas shifted his attention briefly to Dean, a stern look on his face. He looked back at his screen.
“And you know you can talk to me. About anything,” Dean added on. Castiel nodded, a little ashamed of how he’d handled this year’s anniversary. That was probably the worst one since the very first.
"Please just fuck me so I won't be able to walk straight." Cas pleaded.
At first, he just drove around, trying to calm himself down so he could think. Long after the sun had set, he made his way to Dean's house.
When he arrived back at Dean’s house, he found his boyfriend on his bed, watching Netflix on his laptop. He was lying on his side with his head pillowed by his folded arm.
“Dean-o! Get some action this morning?” Gabe asked with a wink, striding over to the couch.
The couple stayed in the hammock, trading stories and enjoying the moment they were in. Castiel could live the rest of his life feeling like this. He laced his fingers in Dean’s and asked the dreaded question, “so when does Mary want you home?”
Throughout the day, they barely left the bed. They only took breaks to eat and pee, and they'd taken a shower together at one point. It was absolute bliss.
After all the wrapping paper was cleaned up, Sam insisted they all watch a movie together. Dean, looking the happiest Cas had seen him in days, agreed wholeheartedly and went to the kitchen to make popcorn. This scene of near perfect domestic bliss made Cas think about his own family. His heart clenched as he wanted nothing more than to be with his father, Anna, and Michael over the holiday. This was the first time he’d ever been away from them, and although he wasn’t on the best terms with most of them, he still yearned to go back to those simpler times.
“On a Saturday?”
“You need to vacuum the living room,” she repeated.
? Surely, no parent was that overbearing.
"No, I like it." Cas runs his hand through Dean's hair. "And I like you." Dean smiles. "But at least buy me dinner first." Cas leans in an places a chaste kiss to Dean's lips.
friend.
“It's all my fault,” Castiel said hoarsely.
Dean was very
"I'm sorry, Dean. That's as much as I can keep down." Dean took the bowl and set in on the end table. When he sat on the end of the couch, Cas laid down with his head in Dean's lap. Cas decided it was a good place for a nap. Dean didn't complain, he just ran his fingers soothingly through Cas's hair, pulling him into sleep.
"I can assure you, I am not a serial killer."
I'm sorry for such a long break, it seems my personal life decided to take a shit on me. This chapter is a little short, but bear with me, I'll make it up. Things are better now so I should be getting into a more frequent posting schedule. Thanks for keeping up :]
"Now, don't get all huffy at me, I was just asking." Dean moved until his whole body was on top of Castiel's. He braced his forearms on both sides of his husband's head and leaned down to place a chaste kiss to Cas's lips.
“I don’ know, you’ve been flirting with my boyfriend for
Cas pulled him close and hugged him tight. Dean hid his face in Cas's neck and just cried. He felt stupid, weeping about this when it happened almost twenty years ago.
It didn’t take more than a handful of thrusts after that for Dean to spill all over his chest. Castiel fucked into Dean harder, chasing his own orgasm. He gave two more powerful thrusts before grinding his hips into Dean and coming harder than he had...probably ever.
“For a kiss,” Dean bargained cheekily. Castiel laughed and leaned down to kiss him roughly. They forgot about the tie for a few minutes as they just traded kisses, not able to get enough of each other. Soon enough, Castiel remembered his task and pulled back. Dean pouted, but Castiel ignored him in favor of tying up his hands. It wasn’t anything fancy, Castiel not exactly experienced in doing the
“You sure? It’s really no trouble,” Balthazar said, stooping under Dean’s other arm to prop him up between the two.
“What about you?” Castiel asked, “Have you met anyone?”
"Wait, does this mean I have to break up with my other two boyfriends because that might be a deal breaker," Dean asked teasingly. Cas punched him in the arm.
Within a few minutes, Dean was on the edge, breathing heavily as Cas continued to bob up and down on his dick. Cas' hips were still grinding into the mattress, seeking any form of friction available. With his right hand, Cas cradled Dean’s balls. He felt them draw tight and with only a tug on his hair as a warning, Dean was spilling into Cas' mouth.
“Where did you
"Daddy, is Cas still here?" The young boy asked innocently, opening his father's bedroom door. The men looked at Aiden as a giant smile broke out on his face.
Castiel wakes up on a lazy Sunday morning; the soft patter of rain splashing the windows. It's darker than normal, but this lighting just seems to make Dean even more breath-taking. Cas smiles and admires the man sleeping next to him, noticing all of the freckles that stand out in the dim lighting. The white sheets are a perfect contrast to his tanned body, intensifying his natural beauty.
“What do you want me to do?”
Shit.
“He used to. Not specifically for this, but to talk about how he was dealing with his mom’s death in general. He actually wasn’t in therapy anymore by the time the first anniversary rolled around. At one point, he stopped going because he didn’t think he needed it anymore. He kept saying he was fine, and I guess he just stopped talking during the sessions that he even bothered to show up to. He definitely
They were both sitting half a foot from each other on the couch, feet propped on the coffee table, the third round of cocktails down. They had already blown through the Batman movie. Now, a booing old lady was reprimanding Queen Buttercup on screen. They had both been quoting every other line, of course. Cas was really glad he didn’t wimp out of this…date? Was it a date? Oh, he hoped it was.
“Try telling that to HER!” Castiel cut him off angrily. He took a deep breath and looked at his screen. Balthazar sat completely shocked. Castiel sighed deeply. “I’ll talk to you tomorrow,” Castiel said dejectedly, closing his laptop before Balthazar could say anything else.
a mother," he snarled. Without warning, she raised her hand and slapped Cas across the face.
Either Cas was going to regain his freedom, or his father was going to be pitted against him. He saw the latter as the more likely outcome.
“Dean.
“And a C on a high school math test is what ‘matters’?” Castiel asked, putting air quotes around the last word.
Cas finished his sentence sheepishly. Dean chuckled.
“What look? Tell me why my look is special,” he demanded of Charlie.
“This place is huge!” Dean commented in wonder. Castiel just sort of shrugged back.
Your feedback is awesome! :]
“He had no right! None!” Castiel shouted.
“And just where do you think you’re going?” Naomi called after him. Would she ever have a discussion with Castiel that didn’t involve at least one conversational cliche?
Dean straightened up and handed Cas his papers with a shy smile. Castiel returned the smile and resumed making his way to his classroom. He made eye contact with Charlie, who had a devilish look on her face. He hadn’t known her for long, but he knew that that look meant trouble.
“Yep, and do you remember what happened?”
“What’s going on?” she chanced, hoping he’d be ready to explain his mood now. She was confused, Cas had been here a few hours ago and everything seemed normal. Happy, even. Which was a feat for two teenage boys stuck at home for the holidays.
“Are you wearing any underwear?” Dean asked.
racing up his spine. Just then, he heard the distinct sound of whistling coming from the hallway outside Dean’s room. He jumped off of Dean’s desk and pointed an accusatory finger at him.
“I’m sorry Cas, I-”
“I know that, I really regret saying it. I didn’t mean it to hurt you,” Dean avowed. “Please come back and watch the movie,” Dean begged. After a moment of consideration, Castiel returned to the couch with Dean.
Dean slid up behind Cas and wrapped his arms around his boyfriend’s waist. He kissed the bare skin of Cas’ shoulder, traveling up to nip at his neck. Castiel let him, knowing that they would hardly be able look at each other that evening.
Castiel looked over at Dean, who was already looking at him. He saw nothing but happiness in those green eyes.
“Cas?”
“Yes, I figured as much seeing as you are both men and you are in a relationship,” Balthazar responded after it was clear Dean was waiting for a reply.
"Cas," he started, "you're not a bad cook. Or a baby in a trench coat. You're not a corporate douche bag. You're not a mindless desk jockey. You're not just like your family. I know you aren't....that you'd never use your office hours against our marriage. You're not...." Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath, "definitely, under no circumstances are you or would you ever be a slut. I shouldn't have said any of that, but I can't make you forget I did. I just want you to know I didn't mean any of it and I hate myself for even thinking any of those things. I get it if you want me out of your sight, hell, I don't wanna see myself for a while, but please.... just...know that I love you, Cas. I always will." Dean finished his apology. His cheeks were stained with tears, but he got it all out in the open. Now he just had to wait for Cas to respond. The shorter man walked over to the bed, grabbed a pillow and gave it to Dean.
He quickly put away all of the items that needed to be refrigerated. After looking at the clock, he figured that he’d let Future Dean deal with putting the rest of the items away. Quickly, he used the restroom before he headed out. He passed through their bedroom and noticed the laundry basket still overflowing. Confused, he walked out to their washer/dryer in the shallow hall closet and cursed when he saw that it had gone unused. Castiel never put in a load.
