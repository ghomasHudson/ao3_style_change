have work to do, and as much as I like you, I like having my job more."
“I’m staying up, though, just in case.” Castiel murmured, dropping his eyes to his knees.
Stretched out on Castiel’s couch, laptop open on a brain-draining presentation and nursing the ends of fall allergies, Dean decided he could only deal with North American wars for so long and closed his computer. Castiel was seated on the floor, leaning against his armchair and engrossed in grading, mumbling to himself on occasion while marking up his students’ essays.
“My point still stands.” Castiel said with finality, punctuating his point by jabbing his forkful of sweet potato and leek at Dean before transferring it to his mouth.
Dean saw at work. Dean’s ribcage hurt from laughing, his work all but forgotten on his lap as he watched Castiel chuckling on the floor.
at it.”
still misjudge rising or baking times. Sometimes the yeast doesn’t bloom and the loaf falls flat.” He tipped over the bowl, forming it into a circle like Dean did. “Or the kneading is too much or too little, or the humidity inside is too low or high. It takes plenty of time and practice, and while I have come far in my skills, they do not shield me from error.”
. This place is supposed to have the best hot chocolate in the whole town." Dean pointed to a coffee shop.
The sight of the big white limo seemed to take his breath away again, and he didn't know why, because he was here, he wasn't in the club nor was there Alistair waiting for him, nothing bad had happened, and he had a feeling nothing bad will. Or was it just his hope? He couldn't slow down his rapidly beating heart, especially when Castiel leaned forward and actually opened the door for him. He managed only one shy glance before he ducked his head and climbed inside, wishing he could have at least offered the man a smile, or a 'thank you'.
"Fuck!"
"I can get it for you."
"Must be nice. To have a brother."
"You... You have some chocolate here..." He said as he put the chocolate on the corner of Castiel's lips and then leaned to kiss it away. Castiel watched him, enjoying the game they were playing and grinning because of it like a damn idiot; then his eyes slipped back on the bottle and back at Dean, like he was indicating it was Dean's turn.
"Uugghh..." was Dean's confused response that had Azazel throwing his head back in laughter. When he first took Dean in, he knew those cute freckles and that prefect little ass would attract the crowd, but he had no idea he would end up being his golden goose. When he first stepped on that stage with Azazel's words "Do it for Sammy." echoing in his head, and he delivered, dancing so beautifully, gracefully, arousingly, he had the whole crowd up on their feet. And then he started accepting private dances, and then private 'meetings' and... Azazel didn't know what to do with all that money. Sure, he had to set aside a little for Dean's needs and eventually he learned he couldn't allow much misuse of his little golden boy, not because he cared, but because it cost him a lot.
"That's why I am calling. I got a call from a colleague from Mercy West. He says they just administrated a patient fitting Dean's description. No ID on him, so he is listed as John Doe. Castiel... It's bad."
"De…" He tried once.
Lingering.
He looked so peaceful, snuggling into the pillow with both his hands under his cheek. So peaceful and so adorable. His hair was all over the place, sticking out and just calling for Dean to run his fingers thought it. His face was slightly flushed from sleep and he had the cutest pout on his lips. God, how Dean wanted to kiss him. But no, not before they talked. So he gently woke him up, explained the doc was there, then turned to walk out, thinking Cas would follow. But Cas didn't. There was an odd look on his face, almost sad, and Dean felt the overwhelming urge to hug him and just hold him. But what if that scared Cas, what if it was something Cas didn't want? God, this would be so much easier if they just talked.
A spark of determination flashed in his eyes, and he raised his head to look at Castiel, motioning for him to come closer. He took the towel Castiel brought over and placed it on the bed next to Gabriel before he instructed Castiel to help him roll the omega to his stomach, right on top of that towel. Gabriel cried out as they turned him, the pain sharp enough to break through his daze.
have him checked out, just in case." Ketch said with a sneer, then turned to the new guy. "Mickey, cuff him."
He blushed slightly, his eyes definitely falling on her rainbow pride pin, an odd glint in his eyes as he caught his lower lip between his teeth. He seemed like he wanted to say something, but was holding back for whatever reason. "I know I wouldn't mind." He said too shyly, his words a quiet whisper.
Shit.
"I am afraid I don't have much time to stand about. Please hand over our property, so that I may take take my leave." This Kipling guy seemed impatient, and Castiel took a step back to glance at the laptop on his couch. Kipling must have taken that action as an invitation, so he just walked right into Castiel's home, going straight for the computer.
The weather was getting worse, but thanks to many donations, the shelter had better heating and more blankets and more supplies. And more people too. A few nights Castiel gave up his tent bed, giving his spot to an elder or someone who was hurt.
"Oh, Dean..."
Suddenly, without many warning at all, the alpha snapped his hips up, his semi hard cock kind of slotting between Gabriel's asscheeks, but what was really important was that jostle and that sharp movement that caused something inside of him to crack. Something warm and wet spread over his thighs and everywhere around, and for only a moment, Gabriel thought it was blood.
"Hey, buddy, how about you take a break, stretch your legs?" Dean tried, approaching Cas who was still sitting outside, in the yard, fingers working that keyboard to the death.
So they started walking, Dean throwing glances at Castiel, and he noticed, but chose not to say anything or even look back until they reached Castiel's apartment building. "So I um... I guess I'll see you tomorrow, huh?" Dean asked, and Castiel felt a bit playful, so he decided to answer with a hint of tease in his voice.
"Yeah, he just ran past me. I... I lost him. I'm sorry, Bart."
His first dance went well. That strange feeling was present again as he was on the stage, which was really weird. Feeling of being watched while he was dancing on a stage with the intend of being watched was an oxymoron all by itself, but he still couldn't shake that skin-crawling inkling that something was wrong. Still he had no time to dwell on that. He had another dance to finish up, a bit later then usual and he hoped Benny would wait up for him.
His mind was trying to draw him back, to tell him that he should feel scared and that he should hide and definitely not let whoever that was into their apartment, not unless they were some form of authority. That he should just be wary and as small as possible. But his instincts, something he never felt before, were telling him to be a fucking alpha and defend his territory. His home.
"You sure?"
"I am, Cas. I felt drawn to you since the moment I saw you. And you are funny and interesting and intelligent, and so easy to talk to. And you have the most amazing blue eyes, I swear, when you look at me, it feels like you can see all the way to my soul." Dean said, having no idea why he was getting so sappy all of a sudden, but stopped caring as soon as he saw Cas smile.
"Hey, and if they did, then Gabriel could move in with Sam and you could move in with me and..." Dean trailed off, suddenly blushing and hiding his eyes and Castiel was caught in awe. Not only did his omega want him there, but he was so shy about it, and hopeful.
But he had time before that, so after he ate, he decided to head out to see Sammy. Crowley let him borrow another one of his books - The Master and Margarita, by Mikhail Bulgakov. Dean never really cared about books and reading, but Sammy loved them since he was a kid, so Dean would bring one and read to him every time he would visit. He would read, even if most of the times he had no idea what he was reading. Still, when Dean started on this book, he found that he liked it, and laughed his ass of at the mention of a character called Azazello who "turned out to be short of stature, a fiery redhead with a fang, in a starched shirt, a good-quality striped suit, patent leather shoes, and with a bowler hat on his head. His tie was brightly coloured. The surprising thing was that from the pocket where men usually carry a handkerchief or a fountain pen, this gentleman had a gnawed chicken bone sacking out."
"Yeah, yeah, I have a spirit of an old lady with a bunch of cats. Shuddup." Dean replied blushing, but managed to make Cas smile, so he figured it was worth the embarrassment. Still, the moment he left the house, just like a few days ago, some sort of dread crept inside his chest and didn't let go until he came back.
Dean hung up, and motioned for Cas to sit at the table while he served chicken legs with crispy skins and mashed potatoes with a simple lettuce salad for Cas. Dean ended up eating some of it too, but only because Cas offered some. Still, all throughout dinner, Cas seemed even more quiet and somewhat distant, contemplative, probably considering Charlie's offer, though Dean had no idea what was there to even think about.
"What do you mean you can't issue me a new Card? I need it, I lost... I don't have my driver's license nor my ID, and I need the card to..."
"Fuck... " Dean let out, and it sounded like he was cursing, because damn, that voice, but then after a few breaths he managed to add "... Me... Fuck me, Alpha. I need you... To give it to me... Hard... And fast... Ppplease..."
So Castiel got to work, resetting the plates, careful not to ruin the swans, because he did not know how to make those. He set them up on one end of the table opposite each other so that he could lift his head at any given moment and stare into those beautiful green eyes. He reset the table five times before he finally set up all the cutlery right, soup spoon next to dinner knife and not the forks. His hands shook as he moved the plates, and made a million little corrections to the glasses, moving them apart and then closer together.
Suddenly, the doors of his apartment swung open with a loud bang, someone stumbling in, their breaths rumbling loudly through the silence of the place. But then they paused, sniffing the air, then proceeded to Dean's bed room, silent and stealth, like a good predator would.
"Come on. Let's get out, go grab a bite to eat. We can decide later what to do after." Dean said and Castiel nodded after a moment. He could use some air, some time out of this apartment.
Dean watched as Castiel closed his eyes heavily and how his (still trapped) cock twitched in interest. There was something between a hum and a moan rolling somewhere deep in Castiel's throat and Dean reached, hooked his briefs and slid them down, releasing the throbbing caged animal. His eyes slipped up to meet Castiel's gaze once more, to see that lust in his dilated pupils and those shaking parted lips. Dean refocused on the task at hand, leaned in and placed one wet kiss on the top of the head, and it felt so good to hear Castiel's breath hitch at that. Slowly, Dean opened his mouth and took him in, twirling his tongue gently around the stiff cock. He took him in as much as he could and then slowly started bobbing his head.
"Where is that remote?" Dean heard him ask and came closer to help him look.
"We can make it like in the movies. We could get popcorn and Pepsi, or licorice..." Castiel started with a smile on his face.
"And then one day, he wandered into the tavern. James. The minute I saw him, I felt drawn to him. His scent… It was so… familiar. He smelled like… Almost like home. Almost." Something heavy settled in Castiel's chest when he heard Dean say these things, but he would not interrupt the omega, no matter how much it hurt to listen to him speak like that about the man who tortured him.
"Gabriel..." Sam strated, his voice laced with concern.
Still, Dean's behavior was eating him up, and he blamed himself. He told Dean they would talk after dinner and they didn't. He assumed Dean is confused about his behavior and didn't know how to act around him. Castiel loved it when he was relaxed and himself this morning, and the laughter they shared, but then Dean must have remembered he was paid to be there, and for a reason, so he snapped back into... The escort he is supposed to play.
Unintentionally, Castiel started rocking them back and forth as he shushed Dean and told him he had every right to fall apart and that he is so proud of him for being so brave and for holding it together like he did. Like he still does. He told him, over and over how sorry he was that happened to him and that it wasn't right. That something like that could never be right. And then he took a deep breath before he added one last important thing.
The rose lingered on his lips which he dared not move and then moved to the corner of his mouth, slowly tracing it's way to Dean's jaw, just like he imagined Castiel's lips would do. It made him tremble, but for the first time in a good way, feeling goosebumps as the rose brushed down his neck.
Castiel would spend a good chunk of his night thinking about Dean, starting with his smile and his piercing eyes. He was curious about him, wondered if Dean chose that shelter just because he wanted to see Castiel. Wondered what happened between him and Meg, or if he was the one to give that generous donation Balthazar mentioned.
Shit. If that's the case, and Dean was reading this whole thing all wrong, maybe Cas didn't even like him, maybe he was just putting up with him? Dean basically forced himself into Cas' life by taking the only thing that Cas ad outside his home - the shelter. Cas never said anything, nor showed that it bothered him that Dean was there, but what if he did mind? What if he still hated Dean over what he did? Over that damn article?
Watching Cas work was mind-blowing. The guy typed, and typed and typed and would just keep on typing, and Dean was pretty certain if it weren't for him bringing him food and water and reminding him to take breaks, Cas wouldn't stop. But even with Dean fussing around him, Cas took miniature breaks and then dove right back in. He swallowed down the sandwiches Dean made and no, Dean certainly didn't have any thoughts about the fact that Cas could stuff so much in his mouth at once. The man drank one offered bottle of water after another not looking away from the monitor and with the other hand still typing away.
At least from women.
"I am glad you liked it." Castiel said, trying to keep his voice even. He watched as Dean's smile dessipated and his brows furrowed in a mix of confusion and concern. He bit his lip and his eyes flickered between Castiel's plate and his mouth.
“Do you?” Cas asked, sucking a hickey into his skin.
"Hey, hey... Cassie, you okay? What's wrong?"
It won't... fall apart?
With one smooth motion, he removed his own shirt, only braking the kiss for a split second before he latched back on, snaking his hands under Sam's shirt. The alpha hummed into the kiss, and shook under Gabriel's touch. His hands reached, slow and uncertain and finally landed on the omega's forearms, too fearful to touch anywhere else. The notion didn't escape Gabriel and made something stir inside his chest. Not wishing to dwell on that feeling, he instead grabbed Sam's hand and put it on his hip, more closer to his ass then anywhere else. The alpha understood and moved his hand, tenderly caressing the omega's asscheek, this time making Gabriel him into their kiss and proceed with a lot more passion.
"Rewind it again!" Castiel said and watched as Dean got into the car, his head turned away from the camera until it wasn't. There was clear panic in his expression as he turned but then his head got slammed into the window and Castiel fucking growled like a wild animal making the room extremely silent. Guilt and rage hit him in waves and he couldn't focus and he couldn't even move and thank God nobody tried to reach him, talk to him or touch him at that moment because he could have ripped someone's head off.
"I assure you, your Majesty, I am not a thief. It was just something I learned as a child, a parlor trick, really. I have never stolen a thing in my life." Lord Samuel defended, and Castiel could tell he was truthful. Nevertheless, to ease the alpha more, and to contribute to the light conversion, Castiel decided to tease the tall alpha a bit, just as the meal was being served.
"Very funny Dean. And it's Sam."
"I want you. I want to feel you. I want to... Connect, to... To feel you inside of me." Dean hid his eyes, his freckles turning red along with his skin as he blushed like crazy. Cas stared at him, his expression one of shock and disbelief. "I... I just want... More." Dean added shyly, lowering his head. Finally Castiel snapped out of his shock, reached and cupped Dean's face lifting it up to meet his gaze.
Sam's advice had been spot on because Dean was about to run out the door to go find Cas and apologize again and again and grovel maybe and... Yeah. Dean needed to think this through first. Maybe get a shower while he was at it.
"Did I..." Castiel started carefully, trying to ask if he hurt the omega, but Dean cut him off, speaking while also trying to catch his breath.
“I… I don’t know.” Dean said not meeting Castiel’s gaze. Did he think Castiel wouldn’t want to free him? Did he still have doubts about Castiel’s intentions? Perhaps it didn’t occur to him to ask? Even with the knowledge that Castiel would not harm him, not once did Dean ask for food or water or anything else, happy to get what was freely given. In fact, all he ever asked for was Castiel’s real name.
Castiel swallowed and nodded. Some of the snow caught in his hair fell onto his forehead. Dean automatically brushed it aside without a second thought, and the stutter in Castiel’s breathing vibrated through the thick layers between them.
Dean didn’t answer, moodily stabbing his pie instead.
Claire was standing in front of Castiel’s desk, arms crossed and scowl set in place. Cas was pinching the bridge of his nose, looking exasperated. “Can you please
What if he had? What if he’d pressed his lips to Castiel’s, just as he’d dreamed about? Would Castiel jerk back in shock or lean into it, sighing in pleasure, wrapping a warm hand around the back of Dean’s neck and brushing his fingers through—
Castiel, as it turned out, was in his classroom, and after Dean popped in to say good morning and shelved his own books, he went over to see if Castiel wanted help again.
“The Roadhouse?”
Dean, dining on a pastrami sandwich on the other side of the desk, suppressed a laugh (mainly because he didn’t want to choke: he’d taken too big a bite). “When’d he email you?” he mumbled.
“Did you get to meet her, before she moved out?”
Dean pushed the door to the stairwell open, holding it for Cas. “So, how was it?” he prompted as they descended, running one hand down the railing, the other toying with his car keys.
Dean grunted a thanks, stabbing the closest noodle. “I don’t know what I’m gonna do.”
Dean straightened up in his chair. “Novak?” he repeated.
Dean hung up the phone with a groan, wrapping his blanket more tightly around himself and returning to the soup bubbling on the stove. He’d wait it out.
Castiel sighed.
“That’s one word for it.” Dean drizzled maple syrup over his bacon, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
He drifted to sleep that night with the cat by his side, warm and comfortable under the sheets and yet cold and yearning for another person’s—Cas’s—warmth to envelop him.
that privilege—”
He plugged the laptop into the ancient monitor, holding his breath and sending up a silent prayer until the old screen hummed to life. He leaned back in his chair and logged into his school email, and immediately regretted it as the numbers in the Inbox started zooming upwards.
have you even been to? Birthdays and work not included.”
Dean leaned his forearms against the desk. “So? What was it?”
Dean shifted his body, sitting up and leaning against the back of the sofa. He rubbed his eyes, yawning a second time. “What time is it?”
Instead, Castiel was offering his—his
“Yeah, but it’s harder.”
“…So I—”
Dean chanced a look beside him at Castiel, who was frowning at the TV screen, fork halfway to his mouth.
“Thirteen-year-olds are
Cas gave a jerky nod, focusing a bit too hard on his plate.
“—But,” Cas gave him a firm look. “I get to choose what we watch tomorrow.”
“Oh, look at that, you’d’ve sold me,” Castiel deadpanned.
a two hour block of nothing. The good part, Dean pointed out, was that at least their lunch blocks lined up.

Dean thought he saw Charlie snapping a photo of something out of the corner of his eye, but he couldn’t care less, honestly.
in college, what happened?”
Thank
Castiel didn’t answer right away, but let out a deep sigh of relief and slumped against the back of the sofa, his shoulder pressing into Dean’s. “Yes, she’s at a friend’s house,” he answered, texting back a reply and tossing his phone on the couch cushion beside him. “She said we ‘need not worry,’” he said, closing his eyes and making half-hearted air quotes.
Castiel raised an eyebrow, but there was a small smile at the corner of his mouth.
“Thank you,” Castiel said, giving him a grateful smile before turning back to the roster. “I can do the first half, if you can do the second.”
“What was your original point?” Castiel coughed, wiping his mouth on his shirtsleeve.
“Thank God for Cas,” Dean mumbled when Baby’s wheels crunched onto the snowless gravel drive.
And he
Dean jerked out of his moping. “Jo, when have I

“Power’s back at my place,” Dean said, resting his head on Cas’s chest, right over his heartbeat.
“What was the point of Star’s character?” Castiel asked forty-five minutes later as the credits rolled, reaching down to grab his drink. “She was very….
He woke slowly and drowsily, sunlight drifting through the window despite a faint chill in the air. Cas’s chest pressed against his back, his bare skin soft and sleep-warm. Dean traced a vein on the back of one of Cas’s hands, snuggling back farther into Castiel’s embrace.
Dean hesitated. “Text me when you get home, then. So I know you aren’t dead, obviously."
He knew what Cas was saying: the words made sense in his head. He wanted to know if it was real, if what he felt was real, if
The air was musty and stale and there was definitely a large cobweb attached to one of the cabinets, but overall it was in pretty good shape compared to years past. At least, it was better than the year Dean returned to find the largest, nastiest nest of brown recluse spiders tucked in one of the back corners. Not only did it have at least
Actually, no, Cas would probably kiss him if he did that.
“Lisa,” Dean said automatically around a mouthful of lamb.
Dean nodded. “Good.” He contemplated Cas for a moment. “You know what?” he said decisively, nodding, “You need a fun weekend.”
Castiel was seated on the porch, legs criss crossed in the rocking chair—how did he do that in a
frog as the thumbnail.
Standing in his doorway and keeping an eye on both classes, he fired off three more texts before ringing the front office.
Dean’s eyes were alight and he was grinning broadly.
“Grading your essays,” Dean interrupted from the doorway. Claire jumped and turned. Castiel looked up, and something like relief passed over his face. Dean raised his eyebrows at Claire. She rolled her eyes again and grabbed her bag off the ground.
“Oh, um.” Castiel looked around at the mess on the floor. “Fine, I think. Although I may have brought too many books,” he frowned at the cardboard boxes off to the side.
“You ain’t wrong about that,” Dean sighed, drizzling dish soap in the hot water. “Star coulda been pretty cool.”
Charlie crumpled up her gyro’s tin foil wrapper. “I’m just saying—”
The more he let his thoughts stray
“I went to college, Dean. Quite a few.” Castiel circled a final something and set the paper aside. “I was the only one who could blow smoke rings that lasted longer than five seconds,” he continued conversationally, sliding another essay from the stack at his elbow.
, whereas Dean thought they should finish
“Oh.”
“Dean,” Castiel murmured softly, rubbed his bicep. “You should probably go to bed. You need a good night’s sleep.”
“Which is why you ask
Most people looked more peaceful in their sleep, and Cas was one of those people. He was uptight during workdays, tensed up like a rabbit on alert. Now, though, the frown lines between his eyebrows smoothed to soft skin, his back and shoulders relaxed to soft, sloping curves instead of the sharpness he carried at school. His cheek squished into the pillow, lips parted with gentle exhales, locks of unruly hair curling across his forehead.
“Don’t blow up your computer this year!” she added, walking backwards towards the door with a cheeky grin.
Dean sat up fully and scooched forwards, leaning towards him. “I think it’s pretty cool, Cas,” he said earnestly. “What else did Bram Stoker fuck up?”
“You fuckin’ fibber,” Dean mumbled around a mouthful of warm chocolate pecan pie. “This is a good ass pie crust!”
Deep-cleaning a high school History classroom at ten a.m. on a Monday was not Dean’s ideal way to spend his mornings—mainly because it included fishing dead cricket spiders out of windowsills and clearing cobwebs from dark, spooky corners he
By a quarter to eight, everyone who had arrived gathered in the living room, making small talk or eating. Jody and Donna were chatting with Mary, with Alex (their daughter) playing darts with Jo nearby. Garth was trading work stories with Sam, their wives doing the same nearby. From Jess’s hand-miming, she was retelling one of the “I slipped and fell on my shampoo bottle in the shower” ones.
Castiel smiled softly. “Yes, she handed me a tin of cookies and spent a considerable amount of time telling stories about working here.”
Castiel shifted to the side so Dean could open the drawer by his hip.
Castiel’s handwriting was lovely. A weird observation, but Dean caught himself watching Castiel’s small, even script titling each file before he placed a small, neat checkmark next to the name on the list. He had to give himself a small shake before focusing on his
His phone buzzed.
Jo was gazing at him. Or, well, in his general direction, at least.
Castiel’s lips parted just a little when he exhaled, his body angled towards Dean’s, looking unsure and hopeful all at once. “Dean,” he said softly.
He hummed appreciative thanks and filled his cup, noting the quote from

Dean blinked. “So…what?”
Albert squawked, leaping off the banister and flapping vehemently to get away. Dean lunged for him—
“How many are left?” he mumbled, half-asleep on the couch. They had switched to coffee by seven-thirty, barely awake. The hour hand had just creeped past eight o’clock, but it felt like much later.
It didn’t. It was...wonderful. Dean still ached to reach out and reel Castiel in, still felt that fire burning when Castiel caught his eye and they’d dissolve into laughter, still wanted to hold him close, safe and warm and
“Hey, can’t go wrong with too many books,” Dean replied.
Dean stopped by the school the next day after realizing he’d left a few boxes of backup books at home the day before—books with

The air was biting when he stepped outside, his eyes watering almost immediately. His hands shook getting the keys in the ignition, a panicked thought going through his head at the freeze affecting his Baby.
Castiel’s laugh rumbles through his chest and Dean can’t help but chuckle along.
“You can order pizza and we’ll be close to done by the time it’s here.”
“Jesus, Sam, you think I’d say
He was flipping his keys in his hands again.
Dean chuckled. “That, I can agree with. I don’t know anyone who enjoyed seventh grade.”
Most of the time now, they’d spend a good few hours grading and planning or whatever needed to be done, and then order takeout or finish off the leftovers in the fridge while bickering over television shows.
“Oh, Dean,” Castiel murmured, utterly lost in him.
being the only one with the skills to maintain and run the school’s website.
Castiel’s laugh was the best thing Dean had ever tasted.
“Since I said it did,” Charlie answered, releasing him and readjusting her backpack straps. “Are you excited for the school year?”
Charlie nudged the plate of cookies at him and patted his elbow sympathetically. “You’ll live, little Padawan.”
Castiel frowned for a second in confusion before opening his mouth. “I—” he began, then “Oh.
“Marcy will not hurt you, I can guarantee it,” Castiel said calmly, pushing the snake’s body towards Dean and pulling fake plants out of the tank. “Pull her body towards you a bit more—” he set his hands on Dean’s trembling ones, guiding the boa’s body onto Dean’s legs. “Gently, just lift and drag her backwards—that’s it, good!”

since snakes couldn’t regulate their own body temperature.
“I won’t scare him off, Charlie,” Dean said, bending down to grab the bag of trash and toss it in the waste bin. He still had some classroom stuff to do—mainly online work—but he figured he should probably wait around for the new guy. “What’s his name?” he asked, walking over to his own desk and sitting down at his desktop.
(See the end of the chapter for

“I was excited for this semester,” Castiel said, leaning back into the squishy cushions, brow furrowed. “My year-round students were doing well at the end of second term. I hope they still have the drive after break, especially after an extra week of vacation.” He sipped his hot chocolate. “What about you?”

“Well, shit.”
Castiel laughed. “Yes, I gathered as much. I assure you, the feeling is mutual.”
Yeah, Dean wasn’t doing well controlling his
Dean nodded and hummed a thank you, beelining for the French press and pouring himself a generous amount before filling a bowl and dropping into the chair in front of Cas. Petunia immediately began winding around his ankles, her fluffy tail brushing his kneecaps.
The last, tiny bit of Dean’s heart that was still in one piece melted there on the spot, and he thought to himself—not for the first time—that yes, he was absolutely, unequivocally gone for Castiel.
To which Dean had replied, “You’re an optimistic idiot, Cas. I’m helping.”

“Seeya Dean! Don’t be a stranger, now!”
In his mind, heat flooding through his body. “Um—” he managed. What was he supposed to say?
His cheeks were pinking, eyes resting on Dean’s face for a split second before darting away again.
“Anything explicit, you mean.”
“No—no. Do not start that date bullshit again.” Dean pointed his fork at his brother. “It’s not a date. Besides, I don’t like him that way.”
“Kevin likes APUSH,” Cas interjected.
He set his drink on one of the side tables and clapped his hands. “Okay!” he said loudly, grinning as everyone’s heads turned in his direction. “Who wants to play a truly terrible round of Cards Against Humanity?”
However, reading the exact same thing over and over again, just in different words, wrung the brain out more than Dean had predicted. By their third break, Dean was regretting offering to help Cas out, and too tired to feel selfish about thinking it.
Everything was blurring together from exhaustion: the room, the shifting orange-yellow-red glow of dying embers, the ceramic in his hands….he could feel his body sinking into the squishy softness of the couch cushions and his grip going lax on the mug.  He felt a warm hand gently take his cup and heard it
“Because of work?” Dean asked dryly.
“Yes.”
They sat there together, slowly sipping at their drinks and savoring their shared comfort. Small bits of conversation floated between them, easy and soft as they’d ever been. The fire crackled and popped, occasionally spooking one of the cats.
Jo sent back double of the same emoji. Dean replied with three more.
The new guy smiled back and shook his hand, his grip firm. “Castiel Novak.”
Cas nodded, still smiling. “I’d love to.”
He’d be fine.
pinged onto his screen.
“What, you ain’t impressed?” Dean asked, feeling the small, flickering curl of anticipation in his gut. The small mudroom was already cramped as it was, and the foot-and-a-half of space between him and Castiel made it feel like a shrunken sardine can.
Although he did enjoy spending his lunch with Cas nearly every day, Dean’s Wednesday lunch blocks were solely dedicated to eating donuts with Donna and ignoring their jobs for the half-hour period. Donna got the goods from the bakery in town and Dean brought loaded sandwiches from the deli, side of chips and a drink included.
“I’m flattered.”
He was about to knock on Castiel’s half-closed door when he heard the hiss of angry voices from inside.
you liked the market!”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel said with a soft smile. He was dressed in a soft, worn gray long-sleeve with a hole at the hem and pajama pants patterned with owls. He looked warm and cozy, the oversized clothes falling in folds around his wrists and pooling around his ankles, his hair an absolute mess. Of course, he was holding a steaming mug of tea.
He shuddered slightly, setting his bag down on his desk. “Heya pal,” he said, patting the blemished surface. “How’d summer treat you?”
Castiel raised an eyebrow. Dean was starting to hate how he could do that. “You didn’t hear Petunia yowling at nine this morning?”
,” Castiel replied dryly, turning to the side to finish peeling off his own layers. He was still trying to maintain a stony facade, but pale pink flushed the back of his neck.
Dean raised his eyebrows. “You’ve never been?”
Dean nudged Castiel’s thigh from his position on the couch. “Cas.”
“What was her name again? Louise?”
“Sorry, Ellen,” he called back, holding his kneecap and sitting down on the nearest stool.
Dean could almost smell the herbal shampoo he used.
“You know those are for the
Dean thought, internally sighing while sprinting after Albert, currently zooming around the lawn like a tiny, feathered balloon that had been filled with air and accidentally let loose.
Most of these had their doors thrown wide open to customers; bookstores and antique shops (Jess dragged them into one of her favorites, and she and Castiel ended up spending ten minutes discussing prices for wood-carved bees. They ended up buying said bees) restaurants and delis, pottery shops, little art galleries, and the occasional clothing store.
He just stood there, freezing his ass off on the porch. And stared at Cas: this geeky, snake- and snail-loving man with a bone-dry, snarky sense of humor and tousled hair, who would wax poetic about fantasy and rant about politics; who would let the lonely kids eat lunch in his classroom; who would treat every living thing with the love and respect and kindness they deserved.
“I don’t think Kaia tries to hide it.”
“Dean? You don’t sound alright, what’s wrong?”
Dean shrugged, leaning against a table.  “They’re music legends for a reason.”
“I’m not getting out of this, am I?”
Dean grinned. “So? Wanna get drinks with the crew after? Jo’s a good deal nicer after a few rounds.”
“She likes the fireplace,” Castiel said, turning off the stove and reaching to grab two mugs off the shelf above his head. “And you, apparently.”
“I’m making hot chocolate, if you’d like some.”
“Uh-uh.” Dean cut him off. “None of that. You’re literally planning back up lessons three months in advance, dude, seriously?” He raised his eyebrows. “I get the stress, man, really, I do. But working yourself into a corner ain’t gonna make it better; it’ll make everything go south real quick.” He softened his tone at Castiel’s expression. “Listen. Everyone fucks up at some point, even the best of us. God knows I have.”  He paused. “Pushing yourself ain’t bad, Cas.  You just gotta know when to step back and say ‘fuck it’ sometimes.”
Castiel started spooning wet food into the cats’ food bowls, speaking to the meowing felines in a low voice. Dean watched him from the sink, still reeling from ten seconds ago, when he—for the second time that day—had very nearly kissed the man now kneeling on the floor, sternly telling his cats to “watch your personal space; crowding each other isn’t nice.”
Figuring he should save some hot water for Cas, Dean twisted the knob to
” Dean said mournfully, sitting up to eat.
Thursday passed almost too slowly, the excited buzz of Halloween simmering in the air. Friday felt twice as long as it should have, the anticipation almost tangible. Decorations had been up all week—fake cobwebs stretched across the tops of doorways paper skeletons taped to the walls and purple and orange streamers dangling from the cafeteria ceiling. Charlie wore her Gryffindor robes, complete with a replica of Hermione’s wand tucked behind her ear. Donna had donned a shimmering witch’s hat and convinced a reluctant Jody into wearing one, too.
Lebanon in itself was a tiny place, and the downtown was a reflection of that. Most of the shops and stores lining the street were small and locally owned, selling handmade and homemade goods to loyal regulars and the occasional (rare) tourist.
“I’ve got the rest of the series, if you want it,” Sam said.
Dean left around one that afternoon, after helping clean up the kitchen after breakfast and feed the chickens.
had something simmering on the stove.
a morning person (the monster). Every day, without fail, he was already seated at his desk with a soft smile and a mug of tea when Dean poked his head in to say “hey” before unlocking his classroom.
Dean and Castiel had moved in together two summers ago, after Sam had pointed out how Dean rarely spent any time at his own place anymore—and Cas had mentioned Petunia and Cleo starting to get glum when Dean wasn’t around.
he could put on instead of teaching. Granted, their accuracy was questionable, but it was a great excuse for not lecturing when someone had a hangover.
a qualified AP teacher; he knew how to grade a paper.
Feeling rather brave, Dean set his spoon down and sent back a reply:
Castiel stood, setting his plate down in the sink to deal with the next day. He bent down to pet Cleo, who was busy winding around his ankles. “Dean likes you, did you know that?” he said to her, scratching behind her ears. Cleo purred, leaning into his palm.
“Recreational marijuana, not cigarettes, but yes,” he replied, eyes still skimming the essay and completely unperturbed by Dean’s disbelief. “I also had the keg stand record four times in a row.” His eyes flicked up to Dean’s again. “I have a high alcohol tolerance. And stamina, when it comes to sucking and swallowing for extended periods of time.”
If Dean were brave and brash, he’d say he knew what it was. And if he were even braver and brasher than that, he’d lean in and press his lips to Castiel’s.
“I did tell you I had heat,” Castiel said, very

Castiel shifted his hand, tangling their fingers together.
Deciding to wait until he was packed up and fully ready to go, Dean went back to his emails.
idea.”
“Oh.”
Second and third period seemed to go by even slower; Dean’s leg wouldn’t stop jiggling beneath his desk and he kept glancing at the clock every five minutes, like it’d make time move faster.
Castiel tossed a crumpled piece of paper at him.
Castiel had sighed and closed his eyes. “Ninety-two percent of giraffe sex is between giraffes of the same gender.”
Charlie contemplated him for a few seconds. “You should
Castiel’s senses nearly went into overdrive when he stepped through the door, blinking to adjust his eyes to the low light and sudden rush of sound. Closing the door—the creak lost to the swell of sound within—Castiel stayed by the wall, aiming for a window and scanning the heads rather desperately for a familiar face.
At least, Dean didn’t
The impact
“Yes.”
“Oh fuck,” Jo said, eyes widening. Jess hummed in agreement.
He had turned his back for
“Yeah, no shit.” Dean seated himself on the floor across from Cas. “You should organize this, though,” he said, flipping through the nearest stack. “I’d do it by class, and then A-day, B-day mini-groups.” He glanced at Castiel again, noting his button-down and slacks. “I’ll start sortin’, you go change into sweatpants or something and grab a few drinks.”
“Huh,” Dean had said.  “Any crime?”
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, attempting to will away the headache at the back of his eyeballs. “Shit,” he mumbled, pinching the bridge of his nose. His neck ached from the awkward angle he’d slept in, and he could feel every vertebrae crack like bubble wrap when he stretched his back.
It’s beautiful and blessed, and Castiel could stay here forever.
“It’s not
“Am I
“Damn, Cas,” he said, when he finally managed to speak again. “You were actually
The mug in Dean’s hands—patterned with some Shakespeare soliloquy, just like this morning—had long since been emptied. So had Cas’s. There was no real reason for them to be here together, but Dean couldn’t bring himself to stumble off to bed. It wasn’t just the tiredness; he didn’t want to drag himself from Castiel’s side, closing and locking that last door of possibility and chucking the key down a drain.
“It’s good to finally meet you,” Sam replied. “We’ve heard a lot about you from Dean.”
“Yeah, you’re a damn heavy sleeper,” Dean said, and Castiel gave a small, tired smile. “Would you rather she call or not?” he asked.
He was taping student name cards on each desk when his door creaked open and one of his favorite people bounded inside, small blue backpack swinging from one shoulder and short red hair swishing behind her.
Cleo purred, moving to curl up by Dean’s side, right under his arm.
Dean blinked and walked the rest of the way to Cas’s desk, plucking a Twix from the little plastic cauldron Cas had set out at the beginning of the week. “Oh.”
Dean peered at the mug’s decal. “Me neither, man. Hey, Is this an earth science pun?”
pies instead of just one. What else were they gonna do, anyways? “Nah. I’m all for pastry—where’s the cling wrap?”
Dean huffed a laugh, half-annoyed and half-amused. “Merry Christmas.”
“Dean? Are you still listening?” Sam’s voice drifted back to him, seemingly completely unaware of his brother’s not-so-impressive personal epiphany. “Because I think you need to admit that you and Cas—”

Dean gaped at him. “You

“Well, breadmaking takes practice.” Castiel said, gingerly squishing the flour and butter together. “Even

The last of the PowerPoints didn’t take as long as he’d expected, so around four o’clock Dean tackled his inbox. Unsurprisingly, it was cluttered with emails. Staff meeting notices and winter sports reminders, Donna’s weekly lunch options for next Wednesday, and parents asking why their student didn’t have a perfect grade (every time Dean got one of
Castiel chuckled, shuffling the syllabi into order in his arms and heading to his own desk to stuff them in his bag.
Dean glared at him. “Really? That’s it?”
Castiel nodded slowly, a small crease forming between his eyebrows.
There was an outraged screech from Albert as Castiel snatched him off Dean’s back with both hands, holding him overhead like a prize trophy.
Dean chuckled, giving Petunia a pat on the head before following Castiel to the guest room. Once he was in the shower, he tipped his head back and let the hot water stream down his chest and shoulders, shuddering at the warmth. Castiel’s cottage, however old and small, had surprisingly decent water pressure and insulation, something Dean was savoring after four days in his freezer of a house.
Dean took  it. “Thanks, man,” he said, surprised, and twisted the lid off.  “You didn’t have to—” A wonderful aroma of cloves, cinnamon, and orange wafted out into the chilled air. “—never mind, you
a student didn’t suddenly need help on an assignment.
“It’s weird science facts and jokes,” Castiel had explained, rolling over to his desk to pull out a notecard and rolling back to the table where they’d sat. “Earth science is a rather boring subject for many students, so figured they would enjoy something like this. It makes class less stressful and more interesting, I think.”
“Cas,” Dean said, “what lesson plans are you making right now?”
“Thanks—don’t get me wrong, I love a good loaf of sourdough or brioche or whatever, but it takes for-fuckin’-
Castiel’s lips twitched upwards.
when the ceramic hit the metal sink, and moments later, he felt Castiel’s hand on his shoulder again.
The teachers (and a few of the students) had caught on to Dean and Castiel’s relationship, but most of them were unsurprised, something Cas found incredibly humorous and Dean found confusing.
Dean thought.
Castiel blinked and stood aside. “Of course, sorry.”
Dean’s eyes matched the rain-drenched leaves; vibrant and green. Rainwater dripped from his brow into his lashes, his hair tangled from running his fingers through it.
Charlie answered cheerfully.
Castiel collected his own work and stood up, arching his back and rolling his shoulders. “If you’d like to get the bratwurst from the downstairs freezer, that would be helpful.”
“I most definitely didn’t,” Castiel said, pulling the file cabinet towards him and sliding the folders in.
where that damn puzzle piece was and where it should be.
Dean grinned. “She told me she was done after this year. Ready to retire.”
Teaching Cas to make a decent pie crust was easier said than done.
“My brother and his family are actually coming this year, too,” he sighed to Dean the Friday before break, during their thirty-minute lunch period. “Meaning I get to play mediator between them and everyone else.”
Castiel rolled his eyes, but Dean didn’t miss the rosy blush creeping into his cheeks.
Dean stared at him for a moment, flabbergasted, before the metaphor clicked. He burst into laughter.  “Oh you
“All good things, I promise.” Castiel answered, a faint smile ghosting his lips.
Dean rolled his eyes, tossing the crumpled sheet of paper back at him. “Oh, shut up.”
“They look lovely—

Dean frowned. “The hell are you talking about?”
a warm, welcoming glow nestled between his darkened neighbors.
It didn’t.
Jess reached towards the end of the table and slid his phone towards him. “You left it on the couch before you went to bed. I think.” She frowned. “I don’t remember too well. I was pretty drunk.”
“Both, but mainly the dogs.” Castiel swirled soapy water around a coffee mug. “It was a fitting death, though—this is the last mug—but I don’t think I’d wish it upon anyone.”
“Jesus, the look on his face. I’ll cherish that forever.” Dean murmurs, his cheek resting on top of Castiel’s head again. Castiel hums in agreement, closing his eyes when Dean presses a kiss to the top of his head.
“Cas thought it was hilarious,” Dean grumbled to Charlie during lunch two weeks later.
He made use of the shower before heading home, washing away the last of his exhaustion and melting the remaining stiffness from his back. For a small, old cottage, Castiel’s place had
Castiel’s smile widened just a little bit more, before he turned back to the tank and started stripping it of fake foliage.
There was something about holding someone he loved close and simply

and shit—” he opened the fridge, sliding the dough onto a shelf. “—just can’t ever get it right.”
“Almost loses her shit, or spends the whole time mournfully watching Kaia?” Dean finished knowingly.
“Only if you want to,” Dean added hurriedly.
Castiel sighed again, running a hand through his hair and mussing it up even more. “She had a really bad shed. I completely forgot to boost the humidity in her tank—I don’t know why—and I didn’t notice the regular shedding signs, and I guess—”
Considering the small size of the kitchen, Dean was pleasantly surprised with how well he and Cas managed to work together. They bumped elbows every now and then and occasionally had to squeeze past one another to reach a misplaced whisk, but they maneuvered around each other with ease, making contented conversation.
Cas snapped a photo of Dean with Marcy draped across him, before letting her slither back into her freshly cleaned tank. Dean immediately sent it to Sam, knowing it’d freak him out.
he hooted, sinking completely into the couch cushions again. “Stamina? Keg stands?
“Most likely,” Castiel said, joining Dean in the kitchen. “Older movies weren’t very good at creating well-rounded female characters. Women were generally reduced to one-dimensional love interests.”
Dean sank back against the couch pillow again. “Huh. Well, you learn somethin’ new every day.”
“Sammy? You good over there?”
“Actually,” Dean said, “It’s not.”
influenced space shuttles or not (in Castiel’s opinion, they very much did).
“Yeah, well, he’s Kevin.” Dean huffed a laugh. “He said his holiday plans were SAT prep at the local coffee shop.”
“What was school like for you?”
Then Dean tilted his head up to see Cas’s face, and Cas looked down at him, and Dean wrapped his hand around Cas’s neck and kissed him.
Dean couldn’t help but laugh. Castiel was standing in the middle of a pumpkin patch, legs planted wide and hair tousled from the chilly breeze, raising up the Frankenstein of gourds like an Olympic medal.
He found himself mistaken, however, when two strong arms wrapped around his waist and a sleepy body curled against his back.
“Mmff,” he groaned, closing his eyes and letting the drink warm him from the inside out. “You’re amazing, Cas, you know that?”
Cas was in the kitchen when Dean passed by on the way to the guest room, leaning against the countertop and flipping through a recipe book.
Dean nodded, still petting the cat. “Good to know. Where’s Cleo?”
“That was a horrific way to die,” Castiel said conversationally while the two of them stood at the sink, scrubbing dishes. He swiped foamy white circles around a plate and passed it to Dean to rinse off.
Dean snorted, twisting the lid back on tight. “Alright, smartass. Ready to go?”
Charlie sucked the pie filling off her spoon, eyebrows raised. “Yes?”
Dean’s breath caught somewhere between his lungs and his throat.
“Or when Cleo brought a dead finch inside and left it on your chest?”
“Be nice, you two!” Ellen yelled sternly from the hallway. “Someone come get this damn chili!”
mixing the two things into a “game of chess, sex, and war.” “It’s cute. Last night, he—”
Dean slid his hands into his pockets, looking around at the piles of folders and binders and boxes creating a semi-circle around Castiel. “You want help?” he asked.
Dean folded the corner of the page he was on and set the book on the coffee table, feeling drowsiness down to his bones. He yawned, stretching his arms above his head, feeling his muscles loosen and relax. Maybe it was time for bed; he didn’t remember a single thing in the most-recently-read chapter of his book and they
Castiel wasn’t looking at him, but at the ashy fireplace, the last few curls of smoke drifting away. “Can I ask you something?”
Jody nodded, adding a little shudder. “Preteens are terrifying.”
“Night, Cas,” Dean said quietly, his hand falling from Cas’s wrist.
history, not the stuff in the textbooks written to brainwash teenagers into blind nationalism disguised as patriotism.
For example, the golden-colored feathers streaked with a rich maroon that one of the chickens, named Meg, had on her neck.
“-ean?”
He could feel it buzzing in the air, and he thought Cas could feel it too: something anticipatory and strong, building and growing the longer they were there, together, half in deep leep and half wide awake.
Dean spluttered, hastily picking the book up and stuffing it onto the shelf.
Cas shot him a look. “No, of course not. And I only have two alarms set, not three.”
“Which one is it?” Castiel moved closer, looking over Dean’s shoulder to read the side of the mug. Dean felt his breath catch in his throat. “Ah— ‘the rotation of the earth really makes my day’—yes, Charlie gifted that to me for Christmas.”
Dean could feel the blush heating his face, but he honestly couldn’t care.
“Hangover?” asked Mary’s voice from his doorway.
“So, what’re
“Mmm,” Castiel hummed, patting Dean’s butt. “You shower. I’ll do the sheets.
The last dredges of tension between them had dissolved in front of the fire, melted away and replaced with something else. He had been comfortable with how they were—close, happy,
“If you met my brother and his wife, you would too,” Castiel answered dryly.
Dean could feel the warmth radiating off Castiel’s body, the softness of his sleeves where it touched his arm. The barest press of his thigh, the faintest scent of honey on his hair.
Dean had picked up on a lot of what Castiel had said about snakes.
Charlie gasped.
Five words should not make Dean want to kiss his best friend.
“Charlie, what the hell—”
They ended up watching the last episode of season six before heading to bed. It wasn’t that late by any means, but Dean was still catching up on lost sleep and, at Castiel’s insistence, shuffled off to the guest room just after ten thirty with a “night, Cas,” and a fresh hot water bottle.
a rather nice evergreen color. And soft, too.
“Shit, Cas, I’m sorry!” Dean gasped, spitting snow out of his mouth and shaking it out of his eyes.
Claire snorted. “‘A lot to do’—really? Like what?”
Castiel smiled at that. “I know the feeling,” he said, closing his notebook and rolling away to stuff it in his bag. “When I taught junior high we’d get celebratory drinks after each grading period.” He straightened up, zipping his bag. “All we have to do is talk to parents and students, right?”
Sammy, “useless artifact” his ass), otherwise he’d have no updates about when the heat was due back on.
“Sadists,” Charlie replied sagely, taking the remote and putting on
Castiel gave a hollow laugh. “I honestly don’t know.” He turned his body to rest against the back of the couch. “But if she does, I need to be available.” His eyes were focused on his phone, like he was waiting for it to light up at any moment.
“Dean, hello,” he said, quickly standing. He’d ditched the sweater vest and slacks today, wearing a navy blue knit pullover—
By the
Donna nudged her with her elbow. “Oh come on, Jodes, you didn't hate 'em!”
Charlie inspected the bottom of another overgrown squash for mold and dumped it into Dean’s hands, squatting to peer at a different one. “What about carving?”
Dean and Cas both jumped. Dean dropped his fork.
Dean blinked, looking down at Castiel, completely conked out against him. He sighed.
He turned to look at Dean, who was watching him with a soft, shy smile.
Dean sighed. “Well, his rooster’s an asshole.”
“Jesus, fine!”
Cas made a noise in the back of his throat and went back to crumbling the dough together. “I prefer bread. It’s much easier.”
“Hmm?” Dean realized he was watching Cas’s hands neatly shuffle the files into order. “What?”
Atta boy,” Dean said, leaning down to grab his neglected lunch. “I’ll pick you up at twelve this Saturday. Be ready or I swear, Cas, I will drag your pretty ass out half-dressed.”
). The desks needed to be separated and organized from their wobbly stacking against the back wall; there were posters to be taped onto the walls and computers to be set up….
Luckily, the essays were at most three pages long and shared the same prompt, so Dean knew what to look and grade for. The evening dragged on into mind-numbing repetitiveness, reading and marking and setting assignments aside for the next one. Read, mark, switch. Read, mark, maybe add a note or two, switch. Move one of the cats from the coffee table. Read, mark, switch. Refill water glass. Ten minute break. Stop the other cat from knocking over stack of paper.

past when he should’ve been out the door. “Shit,” he mumbled.
His students did damn well, too: shy-face freshman turning boisterous and enthusiastic by the time the semester ended; harried juniors with too much on their plate learning to take steps back one by one and finally relax; tired seniors only there for the credit starting to participate when Dean provided
but I didn’t actually think I was right,” Charlie continued.
Like he wanted Dean to stay.
Dean pressed a kiss between Cas’s pecs. “Well yeah, a little,” he mumbled. “I like bein’ around you.”
“Ah,” Castiel mumbled vaguely, nodding and looking around the floor. “Have you seen my pen?”
Castiel chuckled.
Dean swallowed. “I’m gonna go queue up another movie,” he said, trying not to let his eyes flick down to Castiel’s lips. He took a step towards the living room. “Any recommendations?
“Mff,” Dean grunted in response. “Isn’t that a myth? Cas told me somethin’ ‘bout that…”
He made do on his promise to let Sam know he was home safe, and set about cleaning his house.
“Hey, is Cas coming to New Year’s?” Sam asked, entering the living room with two beer bottles in his hand.
“’Course.”
“Okay, back on track,” Dean muttered to himself.
“You always go for the Quasimodo ones?” Dean asked, patting Castiel’s pumpkin.
“I do hope she’ll try,” Castiel answered, frowning and looking concerned.
Castiel flipped him the bird, eyes watering from laughter as he kept hacking up tea. “Fuck you, Dean,” he wheezed, but he was smiling.
(because Dean likes Queen, okay?) drifted from his laptop, loud enough to be heard over the pop of grease from the bacon, but low enough that (hopefully) it didn’t wake Cas up.
His phone buzzed again.
But as a human…it’s breathtaking.
Hypothermic, freeze-your-insides cold.
“My back kind of does, though.”
His phone buzzed on the countertop while he had broccoli cheddar soup in the microwave.
“Well,” Castiel said, a bit more gravelly than usual, “considering you nearly fainted when faced with an
They lapsed into comfortable silence again, quiet scritch-scratches from their pens and the shuffles of paper filling the quiet.
And, apparently, he was horrible at pie crusts.
His phone buzzed a minute later:
Charlie snickered. “
Movies, card games, teenage nieces, and oh, yeah. Castiel using him as a pillow.
Castiel shrugged. “I wasn’t exactly in with the popular crowd. Being publicly outed by a teacher at a private Christian school didn’t do anything for my image either.” He glanced up again with a stiff smile, but his expression was guarded and a little hesitant.
“Dean, you are currently living at my house.”
Cas took it and punched his number in, and then handed over his own cell so Dean could do the same.
“I….” Dean gazed at Castiel, half-convinced this was a dream, that he’d wake up under his own covers and grasping at what could be.
“This one,” Castiel said a little breathlessly when he made it back to Dean, gently cradling the pumpkin to his chest with both arms. “I’m getting this one.”
Dean kissed him in lieu of an answer.
Dean shrugged. “Pretty close. He’s out in Kansas City. How ‘bout you, you got any family close by?”
“Halloween is the modern-day Christian appropriation of a Pagan holiday, Dean, we shouldn’t really be celebrating it,” Castiel mumbled, but the tired smile at the corner of his mouth was reappearing.
Castiel capped his pen. “Change of scenery?” He shrugged. “I guess I wanted to teach an older age group, and when this position opened up, I jumped at the chance. Plus, middle school was enough the first time around,” he added.
“Well yeah, no shit. What else?”
Charlie Bradbury, head of IT and one of Dean’s best friends since college, worked in the media center and led the Computer Science courses, along with supervising the technology and graphic design clubs.
“Oh, hello,” he said, looking nervous as he quickly reached over to the table and tapped the keyboard, pausing the song. “I’m sorry—is the music too loud? I can turn it off,”
“She’d rather see the world go up in a nuclear explosion.”
“What’re you looking for?” Dean asked.
“Okay, neither of them,” Dean said sarcastically.
“Well, I
Sam’s exasperated sigh came through over the phone.
“Well, lucky for you, I am
“Back To School Night is tomorrow, right?” Castiel asked after a few minutes, tugging a notebook from his bag.
Fortunately, before the tense, awkward silence turned uncomfortable, Cleo decided to knock a pile of dirty measuring cups off the counter with a loud clatter.
Something small and happy bloomed just a little in Dean’s gut at the sight of Castiel’s lopsided, happy grin as he started to plod back through the patch towards Dean, his eyes crinkling just a little at the corners.
. “You know the place, right?”
Sam laughed, the bastard. “And where would you be if we hadn’t pushed you?”
Dean chuckled. “Yeah, she did the same thing to me at the beginning of my first year. Sat me right down and rattled off  'round fifty different things about teaching."

emails, he thought about replying with the list of their child’s missing assignments. He didn’t—but it was a tempting thought).
Castiel inhaled his tea and choked.
Dean swirled the last of his whiskey around the glass, broodily watching the amber whirlpool before draining the glass.
“Wait, you’re picking him up? At his house?”
Dean sighed, rubbing his temples, and got to work.
“Very funny.  Yes, I own comfortable clothes,” Castiel replied. “Oh—here.” He unzipped his bag, pulling out a rather large thermos wrapped in a tartan cloth. He handed it to Dean, his cheeks turning a little pink.  “It’s, uh, apple cider. I made it myself.”

Castiel glared at him. “Dean, I have so much to do this weekend. I have the coop to clean, Marcy’s vet appointment, homework to grade—”
Cas snickered.
Dean scoffed. “‘Course! You know how much I love spending my week with teenagers who have no respect for authority and think they know everything—”
Dean shook his hand. “Yeah, you too, Cas. Anytime.”
when Castiel began to nod off. Dean could tell what it looked like; Sam could barely make it through a Disney film without falling asleep (the only one he didn’t knock out in?
He got Castiel’s faint snicker from upstairs in return.
“Cas!” he said breathlessly, skidding into Castiel’s room and making him look up from his book.
Cas’s lips twitched upwards, a coy spark in his eyes. “So?” he said, looking Dean in the eyes. “Are you going to ask me for my number?”
He gasped out loud, overwhelmed and wonderstruck, because Dean was right.
The rain was beautiful.
However, Dean’s little nugget of triumph was very quickly squashed when the first thing he saw in Castiel’s deep freezer was Marcy’s supper.
The obvious

assigned. He had fourth period free and used it for tutoring during the last weeks before exams—and if not that, then his classroom was open as a study hall for any students who needed to get work done for other classes (or take a nap). Game night? Working late? Dean tried to work around it, giving every one of his students another option, a Plan B, the stuff Dean himself never really got when he was a kid.
Cas thought
before ducking back inside his room.
Castiel returned the wave before sliding into the driver’s seat, watching Dean’s old Chevy swing out of the parking lot.
Charlie nodded, chewing. “Yup. I think he’ll stop by today, but he just moved here and you’ll be working together.” She tried to give him a stern look, but it was offset by her cheeks being stuffed like a chipmunk’s. “Be nice.”
Two hours and three heavy metal albums later, Dean was still scraping squashed fly—or cockroach, or stink bug, who knew—off the wall.
Charlie made a noise of skepticism.
they're...they're almost there, folks....
They were finally back in school, second semester in full swing as if the extra week of break hadn’t happened. Dean’s classes were doing wonderfully; the first day back was a bit bumpy as usual, but by the second week things were running as smooth as they could. The students were every bit as driven as Dean could’ve hoped for—one student in particular had a new spring in her step, and it probably had something to do with the fact that she was holding Kaia Nieves’s hand.
Dean’s reply buzzed in a minute later.
swirled in there.
Dean, who’d chosen that moment to take a sip of his beer, inhaled the wrong way and accidentally spat half his beer down his front. “Well, when you put it like that,” he choked out, attempting to wipe his shirt clean.
Castiel smiled softly, pressing a feather-light kiss to the corner of Dean’s mouth and bumping their foreheads together. “I suggest we go to bed, and I’d like to ask you to join me.”
They saw a few of their students walking around, some of whom said hi, others offering a brief smile or wave. Sam and Cas, as Dean had expected, got along wonderfully. They walked a little ahead of him and Jess, deep in conversation about something ancient and most likely boring. Cas mentioned Athenian democracy while looking at olive oils (what the two had in common, Dean had no idea), and Sam jumped in eagerly with an “I
“You’re rewatching—which Indiana Jones is that?—and drinking,” Charlie called from the kitchen, grabbing two forks from the dishwasher and making her way into the living room. She plopped herself down by Dean, handing him an entire pie. “Scooch.”
“I—what—why do you have a
Dean grinned and started towards the door. “See you tomorrow, Cas.”
Dean nodded. “Yeah. Smartass got a full ride to Stanford, too.”
list.
“So, what is your consensus on snakes, now that you’ve got first-hand experience?” Castiel asked while they rummaged through the wood shavings.
Cas tried to hide his smile. He wasn’t very successful. “Does eleven work?”
“Screw you, Bradbury!”
Castiel raised an eyebrow.
Dean also knew he liked Castiel more than a guy should like his best friend. He knew that warm, pleasurable feeling in his gut, the heavy, happy hurt in his chest he felt when he thought of him. He felt it at every text notification, every grin and deep rumbly laugh, every time Cas went on an animated spiel about a book series or favorite species. He felt it when Castiel rode shotgun in the Impala, how he ducked his head, blushing, whenever he brought Dean a homemade goodie or a book off his bookshelf.
(See the end of the chapter for
shift, too—”
enjoyed himself—not that he’d admit it.)
“Yeah, no kidding,” Dean huffed a laugh, resuming his attention to Petunia’s fluffy ears. “Cold showers in winter ain’t the most comfortable thing in the world.”
“Spill, handmaiden,” she said in lieu of a hello, closing the door rather loudly behind her and completely ignoring Dean’s indignant spluttering.
To be honest, her retirement probably had had something to do with the senior pranks (a few of the seniors had filled multiple classrooms with either sticky notes, rubber ducks, or large googly eyes), or the spitball contest after lunch in the boy’s bathroom, or nearly fracturing her hip at the annual Faculty DodgeBall Tournament on the faculty's last required school day—why Mildred had even wanted to participate in that, Dean didn't know. School spirit, maybe?
“Charlie,” Dean interrupted glumly, flopping back on the couch cushions with the pie dish and waiting for his friend to figure it out.
too hungover to be dealing with this.
“Castiel coming?” Charlie said from his elbow. Dean jumped, whacking his knee on the cabinet under the countertop.
He put as much effort into his teaching as he did with the environment he taught in: As someone who’d never gotten a solid, steady schooling, he did his best to form the curriculum and such to be as flexible and workable to everyone, trying to cater to most, if not all, of his student’s needs. He’d get funny stickers (the students actually did better on assessments when they got funny stickers) to stick on the corners of written assignments. He uploaded photos of the textbook onto the class page just in case one of his students needed a digital copy of them. He kept blankets folded neatly in baskets by the bean bags in the corner of the room (not the spider one, the other back corner!). His assignments were given on Monday and due Sunday night (but not considered
Castiel sighed, watching Dean effortlessly shuffle the deck, eyes following the
“I’m assuming you’re not talking about my ass?”
Dean loved his family—the weird, thrown-together, half-blood-half-not one he had. Sure, he had Charlie and Garth, Jody and Donna and Benny, all of whom he held very close to his heart. But the people right here, right now? They were his family.
“Jones?”
He stood up, grunting at the twinge in his bad knee, and hung the dustpan against the back wall.
Castiel thanked him again at the door, pressing a carton of fresh eggs into his hands before he left. “I owe you, Dean,” he said, “and I have chickens, I won’t run low.”
The air was heavy with the smell of woodsmoke and cocoa and though it was sweet and somnolent, Dean could feel the weighted, unsaid things dangling between them. They were a constant undercurrent of tension, pulling the strings between them taut, waiting for the snap.
hated autumn? (But he’d said it was his favorite season.) What if Dean managed to majorly screw this whole thing up and his friendship with Cas would be ruined forever? (That would be a stretch: Cas was a reasonable guy.) What if— “Hey, Cas!”
“I don’t—how the fuck would I know?” Dean flopped into one of the kitchen island chairs, slumping onto the granite countertop. “Damn you, Samuel.”
“I don’t think Claire knows how to say it,” Dean replied, fixated on one slowly burning chunk of ash.
“Good to know.” Castiel held out his hand. “It was nice meeting you, Dean,” he said. “And thank you for helping me with my classroom.”
He was
“Even in the middle of the night?"
Dean smiled again as he ordered Chinese when he got home, remembering how they shared their meal the other night. Maybe Cas wanted the soup for himself, but let Dean have it? The nice thought quickly turned up a sour feeling because yeah, Cas did that to indulge him, thinking he was a homeless man. Dean just plopped down on his couch, leaving the food intact, suddenly not feeling all that hungry with the guilt weighing him down. He curled up on it and just laid there, not bothering to even drape a blanket over himself. Maybe he didn't feel like he deserved one? Maybe he didn't feel like he deserved to spend the night in his soft, memory foam bed?
Dean's eyes widened as he came to the realization and he ran after Castiel, managing to catch a glimpse of him heading for the room next to their chambers, the one that once belonged to Queen Beatrice. "Cas, wait!" He shouted after the alpha, but was not heard. The door shut just as he was about to reach them, the bold locking into place.
"I really am sorry for insinuating that you were following me." Cas said as the two walked back to the shelter.
And then it hit him. Mr. Novak wanted it to feel like a date. The wanted to go through the motions and have that feel like he seduced Dean into his bed tonight.
"Where?"
Besides, it wasn't as if he planned to stay like this. Just... For a few days. Just to let his mind relax and not to worry about... Well, everything. Being around Dean didn't help at all. He found himself enjoying the time they spent together talking while working or cooking, that the hours simply passed by.
As if nothing happened, Dean started talking again. "Well, I'll let you settle in, but I do expect you for the welcome breakfast in an hour. The others will be there too, and you'll get to know them... - Dean focused on Castiel again - ...and if you like how the breakfast goes, I wouldn't mind making more..." Gabriel didn't know if the invitation is meant for them both, or just his brother and honestly, he wasn't sure how he should respond to it all.
And he wasn't really panicking, the thought of telling someone everything actually started to feel... Liberating. But he must not have seemed like that because Castiel squeezed his trembling hands and smiled kindly at him.
Not that familiar with slang much, Castiel didn't catch on what Dean was trying to tell him, eyeing the tall man, not sure what to think of him. This was obviously someone who mattered a lot to Dean, but as it seemed, the man has been here for a long time. Needing to know more, Castiel walked back around and grabbed the man's chart, flipping it open.
Dean slowed his advance, and when the bear finally reached Castiel's mouth, he sucked it in, along with Deans finger and closed his lips over it. Dean mouth dropped open and he silently gasped as Castiel's tongue swirled around his finger, licking it clean of any gummy bear residue before releasing it. Dean stared at him and continued to stare as his hand dug around the bad, pulling out another treat and shakily reaching to feed those hungry mouth.
"Ah..." Dean breathed out as he did what he was told, feeling his eyes gathering tears that spilled with ease. He must look ridiculous, red-eyed and crying and oh, great, now his nose was running.
"Listen, I know... I know you said you'd be okay on your own, but... I really want you to stay. At... At least until your leg heals?"And I come up with another excuse for you to stay.
"Oh, do tell, Lady Charlotte." Castiel smiled, showing amusement at their little quarrel.
"Don't get me wrong, I care about you. I care a lot. I just want to make sure this is something you want. That it's not something you're doing as a thank you, that you don't think you...
the inspiration behind some characters." Sam commented smiling at them, and Cas glanced up at him and nodded, slowly coming to see the similarities. Of course he didn't know Dean that well, bit from what he had learned about him from their days spent in the garden was that Dean is such a strong, protective omega, but one that likes to be pampered too. Or at least held.
Castiel opened his eyes, and immediately pulled a grunt, feeling drool on the side of his face. The more clarity seeped into his mind, the more he started to realize a few tings. First, he was in his bed which was ok, but he didn't remember really the moment he actually laid down. Next thing he realized was that there was no tight, constricting shoes on his feet, nor was there a tightness around his waist from the belt. Or any pants for that matter. No, he had nothing but his briefs and his button down shirt on. When did he...?
. Yet, all he did was stand there, surprised, just staring at Dean and trying to process it all. Dean visibly gulped and seemed to hunch into himself even more, probably feeling so embarrassed about this whole situation.
"I am looking for Balthazar Edwards?" Dean asked and could see the kid take a deep breath eying him curiously.
Mr. Novak turned the TV on and set on one side of the two-seater, opened the 'on demand' section and then looked up at Dean. "What would you like to watch?" Dean knew there were many options, and he didn't want to get overwhelmed about this, so he called out the first movie he recognized from posters and billboards.
“Are you… Are you sure?” He said wrenching himself from Cas’ face, but by doing so, he exposed his neck to him and the man latched on, kissing and nibbling, making Dean’s eyes roll to the back of his head. Why was he trying to stop him, again? Oh, right. “Yesterday, you said… You said you needed… And I just want to make sure you’re… Sure. That you want this.”
After dinner and some bathroom time, Cas cozied up on the couch, and went right back to work. Dean felt a bit tired, especially since he hadn't slept well the night before, but he decided to push through and be there in case Cas needed something. Before dinner, every once in a while, the man would ask him questions, bounce ideas, seek opinion and it was no different this time, so it kept Dean awake and alert for the better part of the evening. But around 2 AM, his attention began slipping along with his eye lids. He tried to stay awake, but sitting there, on the couch, staring at Cas, taking in his every feature, it was easy to slip into the dreamworld and imagine being a lot more familiar with those lips.
"'course Sammy." Dean huffed out. "Jesus, for a person that hasn't eaten in 16 years, you sure a freaking heavy."
He was completely lost in that sensation, touches as soft as a brush of feathers on his skin, lips as warm as his heart felt in that moment. It was so much, too much. It was so wonderful, so uplifting... So overwhelming. As those lips continued their movement down his neck to his collarbone, his breath hitched too many times, feeling like he is going to choke on it. Tears started sliding down his face and as if they knew, those hands came back to cup his face, those lips still near but far enough to be heard.
Dean jerked awake, and woke Castiel in the process to, his heart beating like crazy. It looked so real, it sounded so real, but Dean... He would never... He would never hurt him intentionally, he would never do that to Castiel. He had some vague notions about BDSM and knew it was more then just tying someone up and taking them cause they asked for it, but Dean didn't think he could ever do something like that. But it felt so real and not even a bit good, the scream still echoing in his head.
"Open your eyes!" He repeated, the voice commanding, but laced with concern and the part of Dean's brain that usually nudged him to follow commands so that he wouldn't end up hurt or beaten reacted and Dean did as he was told.
"Were too!"
But Cas... It felt like there might actually be something there. And Dean, he wanted to find out what it was so badly, but his own actions set him back and he knew he had to work on this, on earning the man's trust and show him he was reliable and honest.
"Holy fuuuaaaaa..." the omega screamed as the alpha's hot tongue pressed flat against his crack, then swiped up and gathered as much of his slick as it could, before retreating back into the alpha's mouth. The alpha fucking hummed at the taste and Dean got dizzy on that sound alone.
When Castiel's hands didn't move, Dean pulled away and gazed into his alpha's eyes, searching. Not figuring what it was he was seeing, his scent turned, a wave of burnt marshmallows filling the room. "I'm sorry, I... I didn't mean to be pushy, you're... Maybe I should stop..." Dean said and started to pull away.
By the time Dean reached the SSAO, he was completely focused on the information he needed Frank to get for him, so much so that he was caught completely by surprise by Cas' being there. He was having a discussion with Anael, poor guy not knowing he shouldn't argue with her.
For the second time, he reached, set his hand on the knob and turned it, silently gasping when the doors popped open. A thill went down his spine and Gabriel pushed forward, entering the
Dean thought as he howled back, calling out for his mate, quick to scramble back and up the stairs again, hoping the alpha would follow. It was after midnight, but all the apartments were soundproof and Dean tried to be as quiet as possible as he ran up. He pushed his front doors closed, but not all the way, then ran into his bedroom, stripped and threw himself on the bed.
"I want to." And suddenly his heart is pounding and his ears are burning, and
Here is a very special, extra long chapter, a treat for all you readers who stuck around till the end.
With a small gulp, Gabriel lifted his head and slowly turned, sucking in a silent breath at the sight of those mossy eyes and those broad shoulders. Sam...
Ok, maybe this was too much? The plates, the candles, the swans? Maybe he was trying to hard, maybe it would make Dean feel uncomfortable? He didn't want to make him feel like that ever again, not after what... God, he was such a mess. He felt so ashamed and still does, but he doesn't know how else to do this. If he asked Dean out on a date, there was a chance he would say no, maybe not because he doesn't want to, but because he can't, because if he isn't buying his time, someone else is. And Castiel could not handle that. He will not allow that. And it still shamed him that he paid for Dean's company once more, and will continue to do that, but it is better then any alternative.
Dean’s eyes burn for the umpteenth time that night. He doesn’t try to hold them back as they spill over. He never knew. God, he never—
He gets lost in those beautiful forest greens.
, Sam signs before pressing his lips back down to hers. They part, and Eileen waves at Dean.
There’s such an air of confidence around him now. A true sense of omniscience. Contentedness. Of purpose found.
— that he’d be lucky enough to feel this. To have this.
It’s a devouring, all-consuming inferno, and it’s somehow the softest place Dean has ever known. Warm and safe and loved; somewhere Dean can lose all pieces of his armor and not worry about where they land. Dean reaches his free hand to cup Cas’s cheek, licking into his mouth with such wanton desire he doesn’t know how his knees don’t give out right then and there.
Dean smirks. “Mhm. Jus’ enjoyin’ the view.”
“A little after 9,” he says. “Come on. Let’s get you up.”
Dean drops his gaze again to the nephilim-turned-God, and he sniffs as he kicks the dirt with the toe of his boot.
When he’s finished, he slides down the wall nearest him and collapses until he’s sitting with his knees bent so he can rest his elbows there. His eyes are red-rimmed and watery, and at this point he isn’t sure if it’s from the exertion or something else. His face is covered in a sheen of sweat and he wipes his brow, catching the beads trickling down his hairline into his sleeve before they reach his eyes.
Cas has ditched his normal get up in favor of regular clothes. He wears a soft grey v-neck with black lounge pants, and Dean recognizes them as having once been his before giving them to Cas when he was human. It makes the corners of his mouth twitch upwards. The dark blue sweater he wears isn’t Dean’s, so he figures Cas must have picked it up somewhere along his travels over the years.
to rescue you from hell,” he grits out, splaying his other hand across the span of Dean’s cheek to hold his gaze, “I would do it all over again.”
It’s the breaking of the dawn for the hopes of tomorrow.
“Think I have for a long time.”
He doesn’t realize he’d been walking until he comes to a stop, dirt swirling around his legs. Nothing hurt: not his hip, not his knees, his back, or chest.
“Hello, Dean.”
It’s only when Dean’s lungs begin to scream that he breaks, parting from Cas’s lips to press their foreheads together, both panting in unison.
Cas doesn’t miss how the gold flecks in Dean’s eyes sparkle in the ambient lighting.
“Of course.”
Dean stretches out a hand, palm face down, almost like he’s trying to calm a traumatized victim, to show that he’s not a threat.
Dean lifts his chin, a bashful smile tugging at the corners of his mouth and eyes. He places the guitar back on the ground, letting it rest against the patio table next to him.
, but then Dean’s eyes are flicking between his, to his lips, and back again.
Cas’s hand settles on Dean’s thigh, giving it a gentle squeeze before stroking back and forth over his knee with his thumb.
Cas shakes his head, lifting his gaze to the ceiling. His eyes begin to burn, and he sets his jaw as he closes his eyes. He refuses to let Dean see him cry—because he still feels like it’s his job to protect him, grace or no— so he turns his back to Dean to grab his tumbler of scotch and knocks it back.
The same neon lights in the windows, the same sign. Everything is exactly the same.
Jack nods, lips pressed into a thin smile, and it’s enough for Dean because he turns back to face Castiel, legs moving again, still ever so slowly.
Cas slants his chin, lips trailing on the outer shell of Dean’s ear before pressing the softest of kisses there.
“Me too,” he murmurs, and he wraps his free arm even tighter around the soft, curved line of Cas’s waist for emphasis.
“You don’t want any?” He tries going for nonchalance. But he can tell with the weight of Dean’s footfalls that it doesn’t work. He rotates on his heel to face the man as he approaches.
“So…” he begins, focusing a sidelong glance at Cas as he kicks at the ground with the toe of his boot. “On a scale of one to ten, how pissed are you at me?”
Cas lets his thumb trace a large circle around the wound, and Dean shudders at the soft touch.
And then Cas slides out and shuts the door behind him.
“You did.”
“Good Lord,” she marvels. “Some first impression there, Castiel. Burning out a woman’s eyes? Oh!”
He hears Sam snort fondly from across the room. Dean lifts his head and gives a look, like Sam is the weirdest dude in the world.
He hates himself even more for letting himself go. The shame runs into the marrow of his bones. Encapsulates every tendon, every nerve, every fiber of his being.
“And I dunno, man, but I think...I think after he saw us and Mom last year, I really do think he’d want you to be happy. Whatever that looks like.”
Cas gives Dean a small smile as he flits his eyes to him and then back again to the sky.
The knot releases with a resounding pop. Dean blows out a breath in relief as he rolls his shoulder back and forth.
“You are?” Sam blinks. “I mean, Dean...it was kinda obvious to everybody for a long time.” It’s not accusatory: is that gentle, soft, ‘confidant’ tone he uses when shit gets serious. Dean can’t decide if he hates it or takes comfort in it.
He tries to pass it off nonchalantly. He really does. But Cas sees straight through him, just like always. The pressure in Dean’s chest releases when Cas smiles at him through fanned eyelashes.
“Or you didn’t want to see it...or you just weren’t ready to.” Sam offers, and there he goes, kids gloves ripped off. Dean rolls his eyes and is about to reach over and throttle the guy—
“Look at me,” comes the soft plea. He hates how sad Dean’s voice sounds; how guilty and rough and burdened.
“She made copies of you in Heaven. Hundreds. Maybe thousands. And she forced me to kill every single one of them to condition me to kill you.” Cas doesn’t flinch as tears roll down his face. Doesn’t make a move to swipe them away.
“No,” he murmurs gently as he kisses the bolt of Dean’s jaw, licking at the hollow beneath his ear. “Let me take care of you.”
“It’s funny,” Cas says as he looks into the fire, “because as an angel, I wasn’t familiar with the prodigy of human emotions. But knowing what I know now, having been on Earth for as long as I have, it…”
“I’m not angry with you, Dean,” and it’s sincere, but guarded at the same time. His gaze falls to the space between them.
They’re sitting on the patio furniture Sam and Dean had purchased for the roof a few months ago. Dean insisted on building a portable fire pit, especially for those cold winter nights to keep them warm while watching the sky or cooking on the grill. Their chairs are aligned side by side, and a king-sized throw provides them protection from the late autumn chill.
“‘n then I thought I lost you again in Purgatory.” Dean’s eyes spill over again. He lets them. Lets them flow like rivers because Cas deserves to see. He deserves to know how deep this goes.
“You carry all of your tension here,” Cas muses, voice low. His thumbs rub circular patterns at the base of Dean’s neck, then reaches to lift Dean’s right arm outwards. Cas returns his hands to beneath Dean’s shoulder blade and rubs vigorously.
“A’right. Think I got it,” Dean whispers under his breath before clearing his throat. The slow bloom of Cas’s smile makes the butterflies in Dean’s stomach flutter.
“Try to relax, Dean,” Cas murmurs gently. “This will help release the knot.”
.” He drops one hand from Dean’s face to place it over his heart, feeling it thrum beneath his fingers. “Please try to forgive yourself.”
Cas’s mouth twitches up, eyes crinkling at the corners. “Our kinds of dumbasses, I suppose.”
“Yes. It’s me.”
Cas tries to stifle a whimper as Dean’s tongue flicks languidly against his own, mapping the peaks and valleys of his mouth. His heart aches,
.” And he’s chanting it over and over like a mantra until his body finally gives in, breaking down into sobs.
Tears cascade down Dean cheeks as he lifts his gaze to search Cas’s. The unabashed adoration he finds there makes his heart plummet leagues inside his chest.
“Well that’s good,” he cuts Cas off, “‘cause I wasn’t really plannin’ on talkin’. Not really my wheelhouse.”
Dean pries his eyes open, sort of. They’re so puffy and dry that he’s only able to see through slits. His vision is cloudy, but he can make out his brother’s outline, and he can feel one hand on his bent knee and the other gripping his elbow.
Cas inhales deeply, and turns to place Dean’s glass in front of him on the island. He can’t help but map the freckles dusted across his cheeks.
But Cas is human; and all he can do now is hold Dean.
“Don’t,” Dean says again. “Don’t do the whole brave-face thing. Not with me.”
He won’t tell Sam that though.
So he sees to it to check the wound every day, tracking the progress of its healing and closely monitoring Dean’s recovery. The pink, puckered skin is still raised slightly, promising a gruesome scar in the future. But it’s nearly fully closed up, and there’s no sign of infection.
He is fucking delicious.
And that’s all it takes for the winds to leave his sails. Deflated. The memory is still fresh in his mind, even after all this time. And despite Cas’s best efforts, yeah. It still stings. He lets his eyes fall to the names scratched into the mahogany of the table. He stares at them, at their initials, at Jack’s name, at his and Mary’s.
He opens his mouth, pressing his tongue softly to the bow of Castiel’s lips. And when Cas lets him in, another pitiful sound escapes Dean’s throat.
Dean almost dies (again) when Cas blushes and ducks his chin with a roll of his eyes.
Dean nods around the neck of his beer as he takes a long swig. It’s cold and soothing down his throat, and closes his eyes to relish it.
His throat is constricted now. Nausea settles like a harsh weight in his stomach, and he can feel his chest aching and squeezing around his heart. His mind is racing, ruminating, and he’s driving down the interstate on autopilot. He feels dissociated, like he’s floating out-of-body above from where he sits.
“Say it again?” And it’s like he has no control over the words that tumble out of his mouth anymore. Cas finally meets Dean’s eyes again and leans in close.
The nausea in the pit of his stomach grows stronger, feeling like fingers gripping the entirety of his insides, and he licks his lips because his mouth has suddenly gone completely dry. It rolls once, twice, and then Dean is running out of the car to the sink before vomiting violently. He heaves and gags until there’s absolutely nothing left, and he runs the faucet to clean the mess.
Cas collapses on top of Dean’s chest as Dean’s arms wrap around him.
He takes a heavy breath, eyes downcast with guilt. “I’m sorry I can’t heal the rest of it.”
When Dean dies on a Thursday in November, Cas is there to welcome him at the proverbial pearly gates.
He considers how Cas was there when it was born. When they all were. It still throws him for a loop even after all these years.
There are stars everywhere.
“Oh, Dean,” Cas pants, his other hand coming to cup the nape of Dean’s neck. Dean’s tongue rolls over the angel’s slit and he moans at the taste.
“Sorry, sorry,” he rushes. “I’ll get you some ice and a cold compress for your face. Come on,” and then they’re walking into the bunker stride for stride. Sam clangs the garage door shut, and the sound reverberates through the bunker halls. Dean winces.
In that moment, Dean doesn’t know where his body ends and Cas’s begins.
A pause. Dean mulls it over for only a moment.
Dean’s breath saunters, and Cas can feel a warm wetness trickle down the slope of his neck, seeping into his shirt.
Cas smiles. “Of course.”
matter,” Dean grits out through clenched teeth. “The fact that I hurt you...
Cas cranes his neck back from the sheer bliss of having Dean buried deep inside of him, before bending to rest his forehead against Dean’s chest. He peppers open-mouthed kisses to the sweat slicked skin, marking a trail from the top of Dean’s rib cage, up his sternum, to the column of his neck. Cas’s tongue licks a hot line from the crook of Dean’s neck to his earlobe as he begins to rock in harmony with Dean’s thrusts.
Sam smiles and nods once. “Yeah,” he says with a small chuckle. Because he knows. Of course he knows.
Dean drops his head into his hands while choking back a sob, and he runs his fingers through his hair before roughly pulling at the strands.
“Thank God for that kid,” Dean says, and then he rolls his eyes at himself. He lifts his head to search the angel’s face, because he still stands rigid, unmoving.
Just like him.
He closes his eyes at the memory before shaking his head, willing it back into compartmentalization.
Cas blinks quizzically. “Wha-” but he trails off when Dean grazes the stubble of his cheeks with the soft pads of his thumbs.
Cas reaches up Dean’s sides to cling to his shoulder blades, and he lets himself be moved when Dean presses him against the counter. Dean’s tongue is a butterfly caress against Cas’s mouth, and he opens to let him inside.
On the fretboard, underneath his thumb.
Dean heaves a breath, letting his eyes wander back to the stars. They twinkle, almost like an encouragement. Dean has the corner of his beer label peeled off when he feels a hand cover his.
Dean shrugs. “Ah, you’re missin’ out,” he chastises, and lowers the guitar in his hands to look it over again.
“Before. Sounded like Enochian.”
“Earlier...it wasn’t because of you. Okay? I just...I kinda spun out. I freaked out. All of my shit just came running for me all at once in different directions. And I just didn’t know what to do or how to handle it, and I just...sorta lost it.“ he trails off then, but only for a moment.
Need claws in Dean’s gut, the need to be closer, the need to have, and he reaches his fingers around Cas’s neck to pull him up.
