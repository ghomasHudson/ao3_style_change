They barely hit the bed and Cas is pulling his cotton pajama pants off. He hikes Deans legs up and spreads them. The silver plug is moving in and out ever so slightly - as Dean’s rim clenches and release in anticipation of Cas’ thick cock.
“Uhm, what about you? What are you studying?” Sam awkwardly covers the sudden spike in his libido, he feels like he did when he was a gangly teenager going through the worst part of puberty. He is suddenly so horny he fears he might push this woman up against the wall and have his way with her.
Dean heard the door to the room slam shut seconds after hearing Sam yelling about food. He hoped Cas had gone with him since he could use some alone time. He had not been able to stop thinking about
Humans were barely given a thought, their isolated planet alone in its disobedience-Lucifer's playground. It required more intervention than most in creation, but he never had any regard for it. Neither did he for any other- he existed to complete his mission. Whatever the Lord commanded.
So probably not PTSD or whatever. If Dean could open up to him about torturing souls on the rack what the hell happened in that place that he couldn’t talk about?
Cas freezes for a second his mind derailing as he thinks about it. Did Dean tell Sam about what happened? That seems unlikely. “Your brother is nothing if not consistent.” He decides that is both vague and honest enough.
There have been reports of strange things happening in the Lowell house, a fraternity, on the campus of a sleepy town in California and it sounded like the perfect case after the week they’d just had.
"So, this is Purgatory, huh? And you boys spent a whole year down here?" Bobby asks as they scale a small hill.
Sam starts to think he should say something when he finally whispers “It was my fault Sam. I am sorry.”
He was taking the shape of a well-dressed distinguished gentleman when he smiled predatorily at his summoners. His eyes ticked down at the trap, and he spoke calmly. "Oh, come now. Can't we do this civilized?"
"How-…how do you… Sam. How do you know about that?" Castiel feels exposed. Vulnerable. Is he so compromised that everyone can slip past his defenses? See his most shameful acts.
"Dean. Even if she manages to hide from Crowley- her soul is marked for Hell," Cas says, walking closer to Dean.
Sam gets in and steels himself for the task at hand, getting to the bottom of the Benny thing. Then he will worry about their Angel friend.
Before he can get any more information from her, Shane's screams ring loudly mixed with those of Hayley, and Artemis turns into a run towards the open space.
Fields of carnage and black wings. That woman from before. Searing spikes driven into his head. Demands that he kill Dean Winchester repeated with each new agony. A strength that could weather it all.
The brothers make their way out of the complex- the slow way- and when they reach the Impala, they walk up to a blood-soaked Cas cradling a very obviously dead Alfie in his arms. Sam's powers faded out again on the way over, and he wonders what a dead body would have given off before shaking off the morose thought.
"Hey, Cas. Are you okay? "Sam tries to break the angel's concentration. He isn't sure if the ritual is something that Cas would be able to pick up on- the way he is scrutinizing him, he's almost sure he knows something is up.
He puts his glasses back on and pulls Ruby's knife from his belt. "No matter what happens, you stay inside that circle. You understand me?" he says before sneaking back into the barn.
. They had always fought, sure, but Sam always knew Dean would do anything for him. Now he wasn't sure Dean would pick him over the vampire if it really came down to it.
Dean becomes aware of the presence in the room. His hindbrain goes on alert an instant before he hears
Cas answers him with a searing kiss that leaves him feeling dizzy. When Cas starts taking his trench coat off and before Dean loses all ability to think, he stops them for a second.
The moment is short-lived though as a fist firmly connects with his jaw. Lancing pain shoots across his face and he tastes blood from where he bit his own tongue.
Finally, both naked Cas turns his full attention to the plug. He tugs on it lightly and then releases it. Watching with hungry eyes as Dean’s greedy hole sucks it back in. Dean moans and jerks his hips off the bed. “Caaaasss”.
"Thank you, this is acceptable," Cas says, nodding and giving her a smile that makes Dean feel uncomfortable. He figures it's just cause he rarely gets to see the Angel smile and dumps his duffle on one of the singles.
, the lines highlighted his lean muscular body and his hair was just as messy as always- he was gorgeous. Dean ran his hand over his mouth and did one last sweep over the creature in front of him. His eye caught on
“Yes, Dean.” Cas answers and his voice is rougher than normal- his vessel seems to be having a harder time controlling itself around Dean lately.
"Where would I run? All I wanted was one last meal, some good tunes, and maybe... "she lets that hang in the air before shaking her head. "Just my luck that you guys are... "Then she looks him in the eyes "I don't want to die."
He made his way over to his notes with a travel mug with more caffeine than he ever dared to consume even during finals. He sat down and stared at his last few lines; he could feel he was close to something. He just knew it. He moved a post-it note from one spot to another and stared.
In the bunker, Dean is disappointed to see Cas isn't back yet, and he slumps down onto his bed, suddenly more exhausted than he's ever been. He glances at the chair he leaves for Cas in the corner- he's long since given up trying to convince the guy to stop watching him sleep. At least it's less unsettling when he sits down to do it.
“That’s it, easy does it. “John cheers Jack on “Perfect! You’re a natural kid- just like your old man!”
?” Sam looks at John expectantly for a second “And um, no they’re not married in the traditional sense. I mean it's legal now, but they don’t need that. Cas always said they have a profound bond. I used to tease Dean about it- but they really do. And they have two kids- besides the paperwork would be a nightmare since they’re both technically dead. They had a small Enochian ceremony last year, Cas says it counts way more than a marriage license” Sam finishes with a chuckle.
She has been haunting his dreams ever since he cast this spell. Not so obvious that he's really noticed, but she has been there in the background every night. He had thought she might have been Naomi before he had seen her through the eyes of Samandriel and Cas.
Dean is glaring daggers at her and Sam follows his gaze to see what has his brother looking so pissed.
Inside Dean isn't doing much better, he's poured more wine tonight than they serve at sorority reunions, he's sure. This family is crazy; it makes him feel a little better, at least his dysfunctional family cared about each other.
“Come on, man- I almost died, doesn’t that get me bacon?” Dean gripes, but he takes the warm liquid anyway. Sipping carefully.
He looks up at Sam and empties the remainder into his glass. His eyes are blood shot and puffy. He looks like shit warmed over.
“I guess I should thank you?” Cas says still looking slightly stunned. “You were defending my honor.” He looks at Dean with a pleased smirk- one he gets when he thinks he’s figured out some great perplexing
Cas’ face is inches from his and he finally has the former angel's attention- and those eyes are so expressive. Dean can read the confusion and uncertainty in them so clearly.
“Why aren’t you guys sleeping in the same room? Its cause of your snoring, isn’t it?” he felt like he needed to address the news he had just received and this seemed like a natural opening. He wanted to seem accepting and let Dean know that it didn’t faze him-
kitchen. He’s teaching Dean’s son how to make French toast. His son who is the most powerful being in the world, who could end them all with a thought and is asking about making a pie instead.
Dean woke up coughing again, blood stains on his pillowcase having become the norm lately. His body ached in ways he didn't know it could. He feels like he slept on the worst pull out couch despite his memory foams best attempts at comforting him. His mind feels muffled like he's hungover, and his skin is starting to look sullen. He hasn't felt great since starting the trails, and it seems to be getting worse, not better.
"Sentinel- this is important- take heed." the frail woman turns his focus back to the group, and he starts to understand what he hears- its Greek. Ancient Greek.
They both remember the last time Cas got censured by heaven. That had been a terrible time for everyone involved-, especially Castiel. Sam was very sure it had involved torture severe enough to crack the most stubborn creature he’d ever known. He didn’t like to think of what that would look like. His mind had enough horror in it to drive an average man insane.
thing to happen to him. Sam was expecting to suffer from the tension between the two till the world eventually
"I suppose the same thing the demon tablet does. Shut the gates of heaven." Cas says, looking at his hands.
that Dean and Cas were meant to be together. He’d spent almost every day with both of them for years now and it was obvious. There was no one out there who would be better suited to make his brother happy. Cas just
“Oh yes, I fed them, clothed them, educated them in the way of the Lord. They gave me a medal for it.” Ms. Holt replies proudly.
of Cas down his throat. He spent a lot of time practicing this move and Cas never fails to appreciate his determination.
“Sure you don’t want to take the rest of that pie with you? You two seemed very taken with one another” Sam teases getting up.
“Sam, you feel like filling them in? That drive took it out of me. I need to take a leak, have some serious quality time with my memory foam, and some coffee made by Cas. Not necessarily in that order.” Cas makes strong coffee.
He knew the spell had worked- he had watched as the chain had railed against it pulling so tight he had held his breath, not knowing which force would prevail. The chain had broken in a furious burst of black energy that had gone careening straight towards to crystal. He had barely had time to warn Dean.
Dean tries not to think words like “gorgeous” or “adorable” so he shakes his head and nods at Sam who knocks on the door.
His hand still feels the ghost of the rough callouses on his own. He feels like he might start hovering above the ground if he doesn’t keep this bubbling feeling down. He smiles softly when they reach the Impala and Dean pats the front bench next to him.
He thinks it might just be a visual representation of their "profound bond," as Castiel calls it, but he needs to be sure. They had been destined to meet after all. Castiel saved the Righteous man from hell – it had all been foretold in prophecies, so a string of fate would fit.
"Exactly. They were appointed to keep us focused. They redirect those who stray, those who become distracted." Sam catches Castiel's eyes flitting to Dean as he says that. "There were few since there was hardly a regular need."
"What does that mean?" Castiel has been with the Winchesters long enough for the idea of fate to make his hair stand on edge.
He has the window rolled down, and the Fall air is brisk, only refreshing him further. He focuses on breathing deeply and slowly feels the tension leak out of his shoulders for the first time since he got back from Texas. He hates himself for casting the stupid spell. It helped them save Cas, but the lingering effects are driving him mad. He’s not sure he can cope with the deluge of emotional and metaphysical information blasting him from every corner during his waking hours. Then only to face dreams filled with cryptic prophecy and intrigue. He’s almost past the point of caring about Benny – it all seems so insignificant now. He resents the urgency that underlies everything- he doesn’t even know what he’s worried about. “The line is ending” comes to him unbidden for the millionth time. He shakes his head and grips the wheel tighter.
“You hurt her feelings- with the whole room thing man, it wasn’t exactly subtle. She and Cas always bunk together, they’ve bonded you know. It’s not like she
Seeing as how he was the family patriarch it was hardly surprising at this point. Bobby had once told Castiel -when he appeared again after he
Cas smiles softly, “I do find myself imaging what it would be like to have a family with you, you would be a wonderful father Dean.”
“Well our guy didn’t have much to add either, he’s gonna be fine though so that’s good,” Sam says trying to steer the conversation back to the case. “He pretty much told us what we already knew. Big fireball shot out of the fireplace and tried to crispify him.”
“California? I don’t know Sam. Now isn’t really a good time to go that far away from home base. Shit is coming down the pike and we should get ready.” Dean grumbles unhappily and shoves the rest of his bacon in his mouth chewing angrily.
"No, my wife is. Her family owns the place. I'm just one of those, uh – what you call 'em…" he pats his portly belly- "trophy husbands," he laughs.
Dean takes hold of Sam's face and tries to get him to open his mouth so he can look down his throat. Sam wrests himself free of his overprotective brother and is about to ask him a million questions when he hears flapping.
Dean decides. It’s like he knows what Dean is thinking and he doesn’t make him say it. So, they drive along the highways for hours just holding hands and listening to John’s old cassettes. They stop for fuel and food making small talk and smiling at each other like besotted teenagers in a Rom-com. Dean would be embarrassed if he wasn’t so happy. And wow, is that a new feeling. His chest feels light and his mouth hurts from all the grinning but he can’t help himself. A waitress in Grand Junction brings them complimentary pie because she assumes they’re newlyweds. Dean just rolls with it and Cas gets this deep pink flush across his cheeks when Dean takes his hand and asks her “It’s that obvious huh?”
Instead of heralding the discovery to allow the Dominions to claim the Sword for their Prince, he had simply contemplated the creature. It was a stark contradiction. The dark depravity of his actions in this place only highlighted his virtue.  In the mire, he was a beacon of goodness.
“Dean” Cas looked at him with a clearly astonished face doing that god damn head tilt that made his stomach drop. “I love you too. I have loved you for years.” he sounded so cautious, like Dean would bolt if he said the wrong thing that Dean had to reassure him.
"And? Did she help?" Sam asks, sitting up straighter in his chair, he had wanted to look for her too, but he had to stay to make sure Dean was doing okay.
“Oh, yeah, 'cause the most freaky thing was the vocabulary. What about the bloody high five or the chest-burster?” Dean looks at Cas with incredulity- sometimes his view on things was astounding. “Anything else on the film, like director's commentary, sequel, maybe?” he directs at Sam.
"I can see now that perhaps that was the wrong way to go about this. "Naomi says coolly. "That was my hubris. You were so malleable after we got you out of Purgatory. I thought I could wipe you clean." She sighs, like a mother who has discovered her child disobeying.
So this is still taking on a life of its own. It was supposed to be a ficlet... Next part coming probably later today. If you liked it -Kudos and comments are like food to me... please feed the author.
He had been relieved that he was sitting, he would have sunk to the floor if he hadn’t. His mouth had gone dry and he couldn’t seem to release the air out of his lungs.
Dean had refused to give up his ties with Benny, and they had a screaming match over the phone during his drive back.
It had taken all her focus to tease out the hold of the older brother from the seraph’s grace. They had bled together in a twisted affront to all things Holy. Saving the Righteous man had not been a task for such lowly being. Castiel’s essence could not withstand the power of that soul. Forging it had taken millennia of careful manipulation, adding in stronger and purer blood to the lineage. Cultivated by forces far above even her. It was an unforeseen aberration to have
Roughly translated, "Pull back the curtain, show me what I seek, reveal unto me that which is hidden."
It’s in a diner in Montana, after their waitress- “Cindy” slipped her phone number into the bill fold that Dean catches him.
“And I like talking about my kids. I still call then that- my kids.” Ms. Holt says looking at Mary with a pleased smile.
apart had settled it. She cared about Cas, could maybe someday feel something like love for him. They were family.
"She is something, young and ancient- it was a sight. Not working with a full deck but still useful. She
This wasn’t like the purgatory souls either, this time Cas didn’t seem to have awareness of it- or if he did he was getting better at lying. He seemed scared and that alone was enough to get Sam terrified.
"Montana state trooper, 20-year vet. Checked his pulse, saw his insides spilled out all over the place, pronounced him dead with a capital "D." Sam says, giving Dean a look that meant he knew he had his brother's interest.
"I do not know Sam. You do seem to be "spacing out" as Dean put it- quite frequently. Are you sure you are alright?" Cas squinted at him after letting his arms fall back to his sides from their air quote position.
“You are my soul mate Cas. I just married you, babe. I don’t ever want to be without you again. Heaven wouldn’t be paradise for me if you weren’t there and right now we don’t know what happens to you …after.” Dean can’t say it. Cas’ mortality still terrifies him.
at the bar they take on a witch in Idaho, things take a turn for the worse and Cas ends up being kidnapped.
“So I’m gonna see their futures? Do I tell them about it?” Kevin asks, he still doesn’t think he believes this guy.
"Sorry, Meg, we have to finish what we started." He says, nodding to the pocket with the tablet in it.
about. He gets that purgatory was a royal showdown between all the things that go bump in the night. And that his brothers' unlikely band was caught in the crossfires- but something about that feeling he got made him think it wasn't a concern for
"Sam, help me muss this crud… ": Dean starts sternly, and Sam senses anguish coming from his brother that takes him by surprise with its intensity.
Dean gives off a flash of offense at that, but then his aura settles back into its anxious pattern, and Sam almost snorts.
Choosing to ignore the dig, Sam pours the ingredients into the bowl, mixing it with his hands. The crystal is hanging from a chain around Dean's neck, and it starts glowing as they start chanting the words.  Sam dips a piece of rope into the liquid, letting it get soaked all the way through. When the crystal is glowing bright white, he nods to Dean.
He turns to ask his questions- he has a thousand- only to stare at his bedside lamp. He reaches out and turns it on with a shaking hand. There is blood on his palm, and he gingerly touches his ear, more blood.
“Dean. Of course, he cares! The guy is in love with you- anyone can see that. Geez I swear you two idiots are perfect for each other. ” Sam shakes his head as he helps Dean out of his coat.
"How'd you guess" Dean rolls with it, years of experience making the switch in tactics easy; he's hoping Cas plays along too; he can be awkward on the best of days.
Cas tells him about how he had run away from Dean to lure the worst of purgatory after him. Away from Dean. He tells him about how he had to keep fleeing and how the vampire and the hunter would stay on his trail. How they always kept getting closer. How he tried to stay one step ahead.
He needs a few hours of shut-eye and some time to settle in with all the news from today.  He relaxes under his covers a few minutes later and runs through all he’d learned so far. His brain constantly getting stuck on the fact that Dean is married to an Angel.
this happiness. His touch stone, his anchor. His foundation. Cas is smiling at him with watery eyes. Clearly not unaffected by the sight of
. He wasn’t. He still had a blood connection to her, still looked like her father and is the last tie she has to her parents. It made them family. And Jody and Alex had become family. Now she had Dean and Sam too.
"Sam, we've been over this. The guy saved my life that might not mean anything to you – but it's a little detail I am partial too." Dean shoots at his brother. His features scream of brisk irritation and finality. But his light is still soft and radiant; he is still sending out emotions that are doing more to confuse Sam than help at this point.
Cas' hand remains. Dean’s muscular thigh is warm and solid under it. The noise Dean made has his body in overdrive. His arousal is a heavy thing roiling in his belly, threatening to spill out and over. He didn’t think about what he was doing he just wanted the rocking to stop. Now he is staring at Dean who is licking his lips and he is pretty sure his erection is never going to go down again.
Cas appeared next to him a second later and immediately sank to his knees on the other side of the unconscious prophet. He reached out his hand and placed it on his chest, and Sam watched as Cas' grace flooded Kevin's body, restoring his missing aura. Cas glowed so brightly Sam had to close his eyes.
Cas feels like he is flying even though he no longer has wings as he nods and leans forward. Those final few inches that's taken them years to cross.
They toss her to the ground at the feet of a man. And Sam knows him too. It's the rich older man who had given her his staff. The crowd grows and surrounds them.
They spend the day interviewing people and meet up at a local bar for dinner to compare notes. Sam already has drinks ordered for them when Dean and Mary walk up to join them.
for him to almost die, but he can’t shake the feeling that he doesn’t trust her with him. Not thinking about it any more than that he blurts out:“Your key. Cas is bunking with me.” As he tosses the other key to Sam.
Sam. I tried so hard.” Cas says in a voice so low that if the bar had had any other customers Sam isn’t sure he would have heard him.
“Dean…” Cas said sounding rather breathless. He abruptly shoved the young man away and straightened up. He was trying really hard to reign in his own emotions at that moment. He was frustrated with how aloof Dean had seemed since they got to town and at being caught so unaware by a boy no less. The teenager had come on to Castiel so fast and so aggressively that he wasn’t entirely sure what was happening until he was pushed up against a heavy wooden desk. He had little prior experience with situations like this but it had seemed like everyone was interested in him tonight. There had been the girl slipping her hand to his rear in the hallway earlier, another young man had whispered obscene suggestions in his ear when he had been out back by the fire pit.  And now this. It seemed like Dean was implying that they were in some sort of relationship. Where they?
“I suppose you were like a mom to them? “Mary asks softly, she tries not to let her mind wander to how she never got the chance to be that for her own sons.
"What? No, why?" Dean takes his eyes off I-29 for a beat looking at Sam and then adds, "Really, Sam- this again?" His aura is swirling a little- getting darker, and it bristles? That is the best way Sam can explain what he senses from him, at least.
"Yes, thank you, Sam. It was a sad day for heaven; Samandriel was a good soldier." He sounds like the old Cas- but something tugs at Sam's instincts, insisting that he's not.
They finally roll into Lebanon less than 22 hours later- record time even for him, and he feels nervous and giddy as he pulls into the garage.
"I guess it's the woman I kept seeing. I think she's an angel." Sam answers, he's still making sense of all he saw- when he almost drowned in Castiel.
“He couldn’t get out without Dean- he just used him. And now- now he’s topside and unsupervised, and we’re supposed to what? Just pretend that we aren’t letting a vamp do whatever he wants?”  He spins around and looks at Cas. “He killed a hunter Cas!”
Dean’s reaction is beyond his control as he swallows thickly, staring unapologetically at the wide expanse of tan, wet flesh on Cas’ back. He watches as his muscles roll under his smooth skin.
"We found Crowley, Alfie isn't going to last much longer, get your ass over here, or we go in without you!" Dean growls and tells Sam where they are outside before hanging up on him.
"I am never not serious, Samuel." The Guardian says in a tone that belies nothing but seriousness, and, at that moment, she reminds him of Cas when they first met, and he smiles.
“You think your mother is a danger to me? Dean, I can assure you that I can take care of myself. Mary is a skilled hunter but I am an Angel.” Castiel says with some venom in his voice.
He made a great FBI agent, could pass for any authority they needed and he spoke every language known and unknown to man. His combat skills were excellent and he was a phenomenal marksman- which never ceased to turn Dean on. Cas firing a gun like a straight-up gangster cowboy always led to some vigorous sex afterwards.
Castiel's eyes go wide in alarm. He looks shaken. His eyes flick from Sam to Dean, but he can't seem to make eye contact with Dean for long.
The two younger men make their way back inside the cabin and Cas finally lets his eyes move back to Dean’s.
"And this is Cas. Castiel, he's um, well he's an Angel," Dean says, inclining his head toward Cas at his side.
He has never had a good handle on his temper. Life has treated him so very unkindly that he is full up on anger and it doesn’t take much for that to boil over. A decade and change in Heaven has only started to calm him.
He repositions himself between his husband’s thighs and licks a path up his leg. All the way up- and Dean shivers. Cas darts out his tongue and puts some pressure on the tight muscle and Dean chokes out:
Cas feels like he is blaspheming with his lips as he kisses down Dean’s straining neck. He is lost to his Father’s entire creation- it all whittles down to
“I guess it worked out since they were twins- I mean, if you were going to mess up, that would be the best case. They would have the same DNA, so it shouldn’t make that much difference.” Kevin pipes in trying to be analytical about this.
That he can be millennia old, have watched the first fish wiggle out of the mud. Seen Mount Vesuvius erupt in all its fiery fury. Marveled at mans’ ingenuity in harnessing electricity. The invention of peanut butter and jelly. And this is what finally takes his breath away. He smiles.
Sam was paralyzed, for a completely new reason and failed to help in any way. His mind was racing with questions and theories.
Several minutes later Sam is drinking whiskey straight from the bottle Dean keeps under the back seat for “emergencies”. He doesn’t even remember making it down the stairs. He has never wanted to be anywhere
Sam frowns in suspicion but reaches for the doorknob with shaking hands. He’s is soaked to the bone and the house is freezing. He puts a little pressure on the golden latch and it gives easily swinging open smoothly.
"I translated a few sentences on the tablet- it's not making any sense, though. But maybe it will once it's all done."
“Relax babe, you didn’t even know we were getting engaged let alone married!” Dean reminds him gently taking his face in both of his strong hands.
“Boys!” Mary gasps as the waitress lays down the bill looking a little taken aback by the conversation. She looks over at Mary clearly not sure how she fits in with the group of men but smiling at her in a friendly way. She turns her attention back to Dean who is avoiding eye contact with her at all costs. She frowns as she turns to leave, regretting leaving her phone number on the receipt.
“Just what is it you think I did?” Dean tries to buy some time- Cas realizes that Dean only just figured it out himself and he can read him too. He looks cornered and scared. And that means he is likely to lash out in anger.
that’s where they watch TV. But they look so peaceful. Snoring softly in each other’s arms and he is tempted to snap a picture but then cringes. He does not want to see that again. He settles for teasing them from now until the end of days.
Nothing he came up with changed anything. There was really one, and only one answer that fits. He cursed his grey matter for latching on to this. For playing with it like a riddle that he had to solve. For not being able to let it go like everyone else seems to have.
Cas swallows again and opens his suddenly too dry lips to answer- he isn’t sure what he is going to say yet. He sticks his tongue out to wet them and Dean tracks to motion with his eyes. Deans' other hand shoots up and his fingers land on his plump bottom lip, his eyes go wide in disbelief. Before Cas has time to ask Dean what is going on he hears Sam yelling from somewhere close by.
"I am not able to restore you completely; whatever ails you is not natural," Cas said, feeling worried that even the excessive application of grace had not purged the rot from Dean's body.
Sleep comes faster than he expected, and his dreams are filled with colors and a strange ethereal line stretching back through time. There is a beautiful woman at the end of it with the saddest eyes he has ever seen. He wakes up feeling like something important is about to happen, and he doesn't like it.
had meant, but as far as he figured, Dean was getting laid regularly so he tried to think what else could have him looking this smug and tired. As he studied his older brother something caught his attention and his eyebrow shot up as his mouth turned into a teasing smile.
Mary looks worried “Okay, they're the battery for this thing. So, what happens when the battery is drained?”
"Dean, we should get him inside. We don't know if someone is coming for him, and we are exposed out here."
Sam spent the few moments between caring for Dean and his unconscious friend, looking into his second most burning question- that red cord. It was hard not to stare at it, and Dean was bound to notice once Cas was out of the woods.
He dives down and slips his tongue back into the gloriously warm and pliant mouth below him. He groans at the feel of Cas
“Cas, I know what you said. About not being an Angel anymore. But it’s not like you’re human. I mean not all the way. You fell yeah- but not like any of the others
It filled Castiel with a clarity he had never known, and he felt something. He was so shaken by that realization that he almost missed the wretched man reaching for him.  Instinctually he reached back.
He felt a rush of unreasonable jealousy bubble up from the pit of his stomach when he contemplated the connection. That feeling they shared had been so soothing - it had felt like his soul was somehow refreshed by it.
"Hey, Cas. Sammy wants you to tell him what his dream meant last night. What was it, Sam? Was it R rated cause Cas can't help you there?" Dean teases, "Oooh Cas, if his hair was falling out, tell him it means he should get a haircut or risk going bald!"
Cas just tilts his head a few degrees, it translates to “What is your question Sam” without saying a word. Economical bastard.
“You mean you two idjits finally got your heads’ outta your asses? Never thought I’d see the day.” Bobby says glancing back and forth between the two staring at each other. He slowly breaks out into an extremely rare smile and slaps Dean on the back. “Congrats son. I’m happy for you, always knew you and that Angel were up to something.” He turns to look at Cas who shifts nervously under Bobby’s full attention.
“He came here with me, now one last time, get your hands off him.” Deans’ voice was pure ice and he was proud of how even it came out when he was having an internal crisis. He just realized he was in love, with the best friend he has ever had and he was ready to murder the entitled asshole touching him.
. Like someone had hit the pause button. The ghost and Dean were frozen were they stood under a large oak tree. The tree had been weaving through the brisk night breeze just a second ago but was utterly dormant now. Sam realized at that moment that he couldn't move either. He was like the mosquito stuck in amber, except he was conscious. He tried to speak, but nothing happened, then he realized with a mix of abject horror and fascination that he wasn't breathing either. He didn't need to. He couldn't move his eyes - so he was restricted to what was already in his field of view. He took in the leaves- suspended mid-air from their lazy tumble towards the ground. The wind had stopped and not a sound could be heard.
. They were fated to be together but a lot of stuff kinda went sideways and I honestly didn’t think it was still in the cards for those knuckle heads. Just goes to show- Fate will not let you get out of your predestined love affair no matter how much you screw up. First off Cassie was supposed to pick a chick vessel- cause we all thought Dean was strictly into the ladies. Turns out Cas can work with anything- never gave him enough credit.
All his combined experiences, nothing has ever felt as miraculous as this. This tiny piece of metallic ornamentation. Mined in the deep dark depths of the earth.
they were still fighting. He grunted and placed the coffee on the table, and stormed to the bathroom.
"Perhaps my unique path has altered me." Castiel muses, he remembers being brought back after Michael had obliterated him in Stoll. He is unique. He has no vessel. Not in the true sense. He has a body that is wholly his. His flesh is a part of him just as his grace is. He often muses on his precarious straddle of both human and host. He is neither and both.
He heads to the kitchen to start the coffee when he's done and smiles when he sees that Castiel had beat him to it. At least some things were going well. The angel may not need to eat or drink - but damn can he make a brew. He knew it had been Cas because the guy always put Dean's mug next to the pot when he makes it. If he had no other redeeming qualities, Dean would still keep him around- it was that good.
” Cas moans from above him, he strokes his fingers through Deans hair, it’s a light but demanding touch.
He is loose now, Cas’ tongue still pumping mercilessly in and out as Dean comes down from his climax.
It's strange to see him as just a person. A human.  He's aging- she had noticed more lines around his eyes and some gray at his temples. He ate, wore regular clothes and slept now too.
"What do you mean? We told you." Sam tries desperately -if he tries hard enough, maybe Cas will let it be.
good pie.” His voice is deeper than normal and he takes a sip of his coffee to try and get his body to calm down.
He wasn’t a writer- he was just making a detailed record of things to come like a science report. That’s what he told himself as he was forced to witness the future of the guys he lived with.
Sam felt the beginning of panic trying to edge into the front of his mind. He had to take a few steadying breaths to calm himself. He had no idea how he was supposed to handle this. His brother was still acting weird- thankfully not as alarming as Cas- but still, something was off there too. Their best friend who happened to be a human-shaped nuclear weapon was being made to dance to some unknown entities’ tune and Sam had to bring this all to Dean’s attention. It pissed him off thinking about how he’d have to explain about the spell.
They finally get to California in the next chapter and things start to get weird... want to know what happens- let me know! Thanks for all the lovely feedback and encouragement so far- you guys are rock stars!
"So, what really bothered you was the imbalance of power you perceived? That's oddly insightful. But still, way off, they have a connection that we can't understand; the rules are different for that kind of thing." Sam explained- thinking that this all reminded him of something, but he just couldn't put his finger on it, but he was done staring at Dean's blushing aura talking about something unimportant.
to calm down when he saw the expression on the prophet’s face. “And wait- why do you owe Charlie money?” he choked out around another fit of laughter.
"Cas, hey, are you ok?" Sam asks when he notices the angel wince in pain and breathing harshly; his eyes are enormous and frightened-looking. The light that surrounded him is dull now and pulsing a deep blue- almost black.
“What?! No, god no.” Dean sputters out, Jody’s turning beat red and can’t seem to be able to settle on where to look and Sam doubles over laughing. “Cas. I’m marrying Cas Bobby.” Dean gets out looking over at Cas who is smiling softly at him and Dean can’t help but return it.
He had hung up, realizing that they would never agree on this. Sam had been convinced something was wrong, Dean would never pick anyone, much less a monster, over family!
Dean's aura flashes brightly and extends in the direction of Cas, almost delicately reaching for the pulsing indigo of the other man. Sam is briefly awash in an intense emotion- one he can't place in its' short duration, and it makes him frown. Despite the tender play of Dean's strange shadow, he's gruff when he yells at Sam to help him break the door down.
He is suddenly so hard his cock is pressing into the zipper of his jeans painfully. He can feel Cas’ lips ghost along the shell of his ear and he moans. He doesn’t even feel shame –
Ms. Holt is breathing harshly “I refuse to listen to this when I can smell the sin on each and every one of you!”
“Oh yeah, there was the time Lucifer exploded Cas, then drowning, then purgatory- then Lucifer again this last time. I think that’s all.” Sam explains, his face was jovial but his eyes darkened at the end.
“You have got to be kidding?” Sam mumbled. He glanced back at the dive bar across the lot – no doubt where the flavor of the day had come from and resigned himself to a night of drinking.
“Mmm, never really thought about it like that,” Dean says, leaning back and shrugging as the kid keeps looking.
Well there we go- I have one more chapter in mind before we call it good on this.  Let me know if I disappointed or satisfied? I thought about dragging it out with John storming out before he could get set straight but I honestly don't have a ton of free time right now and didn't want to lose you guys with too long of a wait.
for it. Ever since he and Cas got together he had watched that hardness wear away, little by little. They really were good for each other; they just fell into it so effortlessly and with such sincerity that it astounded Sam.
Dean is dimly aware that something is off. There is a willful need gripping him and it’s not entirely natural. Sure, he is so done with waiting, with tiptoeing around this, but the desire spurring him on feels bigger than it should. It feels urgent, somehow wild.
He looks up and spots his tie a few feet away in the door way leading to the room they use to watch TV. His frown deepens.
Cas squints trying to remember what happened. He remembers Dean looking at him like that. The same question in his expression when he was finally free of Lucifer. But that was months ago.
His emotions started boiling- the disappointment of Dean not intending this to mean something combined with Dean beating himself up over not protecting him was too much.
“I hear you. I left him with Mom- I hope he talks to her but I’m not holding my breath.” Sam says shaking his head. “What was he yelling about last night?”
“Never been more sure of anything in my whole life Babe. Just be gentle with me- I ain’t exactly done this before.” He blushes and then pulls his bottom lip into his mouth chewing it nervously.
"You'll never get it if you still don't." Dean shoots his way, he is holding steady with the irritation, and there is another emotion threatening to make itself known, but he can't parse it out yet.
“The Sword and the Scabbard must join. You must see it done; you are the only one.” She turns to walk away from him again. “The final trial requires it.”
“Never thought I’d say this- but yeah, I kinda am actually.” Sam says a little more seriously then he meant it to sound.
He rolls his eyes at her “I kinda hate that I know what all that geek talk meant. You, Sam and Kevin…God, I need to hang out with normal people.” He chuckles as Charley seems to calm down a little.
"More like Hercules. The tablet says, "Whosoever chooses to undertake these tasks should fear not danger, nor death, nor …a word I think means getting your spine ripped out through your mouth for all eternity." Kevin explains.
“My whole life I thought I was just supposed to take care of Sam. That I was never cut out for all this Nicholas Sparks stuff. After Hell- heck I wasn’t sure I still had a heart. Seeing you in that barn. God, Cas- you were magnificent. You scared the shit out of me. And only partly cause you were a friggin’ Angel. The other part was how hot thought you were. That was the real shocker. Hell, my dick fell in lust with you at first sight. And you were a
“Hey, Cas. Gave us quite the scare there- always so dramatic.” Dean teases, despite feeling overwhelmed with too many emotions to name. His aura is also doing what Sam would describe as an imitation of the Aurora Borealis.
“Um, yeah sorry. I’m not sure what he’s thinking but you shouldn’t take it too personally. It’s just that it was
"She would be unlikely to survive childbirth in those circumstances, that was more blood than a human could live without" Cas pipes up and draws Dean back into the present. "Come on, man, that was sweet how her hero got to deliver the baby, it's a bonding moment don't ruin it."
"You are one of Adrasteia's line, the first male I've seen; that's why I didn't place you sooner, Seer." She shakes her head, looking him up and down. "I guess strange times call for strange designs."
Dean loves Cas like this. Turns out all that badass, don’t fuck with me energy he had when they first met was still there. Beneath the surface and it bleeds through when they are like
"Cas, have you ever heard of the Guardians? They're old and can dream walk, I guess, or time travel I'm not sure-they guard "The Line"?" Sam asks the angel, angry at himself for not having anything more to go on. He doesn't even know who the woman was he was sent to watch or what any of it meant.
“Cas, you already got me the best gift in the world. You said yes, and you didn’t freak out when I sprung a full-on wedding on you. That’s the most amazing thing I have ever gotten. You don’t have to get me anything. Besides my gift isn’t exactly from Costco either.” He says his flush getting even darker as he finishes.
“Cas, I think he has a hold on Dean. Like he’s put some kind of spell on him.” Sam leans forward and folds his arms on the tabletop. “I’m worried about Dean.”
An ear-piercing howl awakens him. No, not quite howling- but something akin to it. Only this sound is physical; it makes him want to retch, and he dry heaves when he hears the chorus start again. There are scuffling sounds, sounds of things tearing, ripping.
Kevin could tell when Dean didn’t want to talk about something- and he really didn’t want to pry into their relationship. He had let Dean know that he knew and was okay with it. He was satisfied.
How is he supposed to face him? Oh man, he needs to leave, he needs to get in the car and drive as far away as possible. Then he remembers Sam took off with the Impala.
saddened John. His youngest had always been so God damn stubborn. He was sure Sam would find a way to get out of hunting and make a life for himself. He had hoped that his example would eventually have lured Dean out as well. He understood that Dean would always need to be around Sam.
In the kitchen, he finds a bunch of people sitting in a circle playing spin the bottle. Wow, people still do that at this age? He watches for a minute and the bottle lands on a blonde girl with her back to him and the jock across from her smirks at her, leaning over to claim his reward. Sam watches in absolute horror as the women’s hair is pushed out of her face just before their lips lock.
But seriously- feedback is always motivating and I will be working on this for the next bit since I have some free time! ;)
Sam stares. His mind is trying to pick something out that Cas just said, but the reaction Cas’ being had is fascinating him, and it slips away.
"Yeah, pretty neat, right? They aren't all as cool though," Dean says as he pulls the spell out of his back pocket.
Dean works his hand into Cas’ boxer briefs and pulls out his obscenely hard cock. He leans forward under Cas’ guidance and licks at the slit – already wet with anticipation.
I was just doodle-ing and tried to draw John for the first time ever.(Do be kind.) And I haven't seen episode 300 yet but I know what happens- mostly. So no spoilers. This is just a little something I wish had taken place instead. I could not let the chance for John to meet Cas-our Cas- go by.
So for those who have only this part of the story bookmarked/ subscribed. The final installment- the long ago promised smutty time stamp is now complete- find it in the series as "Profound Ties"
for me Cas.” Dean swallows loudly and wipes his free hand over the day-old stubble on his chin. “I mean it was
Feeling a new sense of appreciation for cupids-he still doesn't like the handsy fuckers- but this shit sucks.
“Cas, hey look at me”: he says in a low voice, but Cas keeps his eyes trained on his lap where he is playing with his tie, a nervous habit he picked up since becoming human.
Dean smiles at him and it’s a real smile, one that makes him look years younger and makes his eyes dance.
Finally, the sun was dipping below the mountains, and they ran over the ingredients and Latin phrases one last time.
Sam rushes over the last few steps and yanks back the white plastic to find a boy no older than 12, head underwater in the full tub, thrashing for his life. His legs are bound together with a leather belt. And his arms are pinned to his body with a belt, too.
Mary takes over driving in Utah after they go through a drive-through. Dean is still asleep now cuddled up against Cas who alternates between soft looks and steely stares out the window. Mary wants to ask Sam if that is normal -if they do that but she doesn’t want to disturb her oldest son. He looks so peaceful, the way she remembers him looking when he was 3 sleeping next to John on the couch downstairs.
"It worked, though, right? I mean, he's not chained anymore?" Dean's voice sounds near panic- some of his control slipping, and Sam's impressed. He's privy to the utter turmoil that Dean is feeling in this moment, and the fact that he can sound so near calm is beyond what Sam thinks himself to be capable of.
Dean feels like his skin is on fire. He is fairly certain he’s blushing from head to toe. His brain seems to have abandoned its’ post. Cause all he can do is stare- wide eyed and slack jawed at this gorgeous creature in front of him. Cas is being so direct and it’s kinda working for Dean. His pants are very loose and he needs to close his robe before he embarrasses himself.
“Um, very perceptive of you…” Sam encourages her to keep going after shooting a worried look at Mary and Eileen.
AN: the case from this episode is based very heavily and in some parts word for word on the Buffy episode "Where the Wild things are". I don't own BTVS or SPN I just like to play with the characters.
it. He literally saw Dean in Hell, being the worst version of himself, and the guy still follows Dean around with heart eyes. He has given up actual armies and literal paradise for Dean. Sam knew Dean would never accept love if it was any subtler than that.
“Chinese mythology?” Dean asks, “You lost me, kid- I thought we were talking about Judeo Christianity here.”
“Guys, we found something. Why is your neck blue, Dean?” Kevin frowned at them when they entered the library.  Dean reached up and started wiping at his neck “Long story. What have you got?”
Sam has been reading. Trying to find any clue as to what happened to the other twin's family through the ages, but it's an impossible thread to follow. Missouri's been helping Kevin try to focus his "gift" all day so he can figure out the next trial and after a dinner, of way too oily cheese pizza from the gas station outside town, his head is killing him.
“Can’t wait to meet 'em.” John says taking in the wide grin on Dean’s face as he tells them about the pictures of Jack Cas has sent him from the exhibit. At that Dean seems to falter for a second, his face slackens and then he looks at Sam who nods at Dean. Something passes between them unspoken.
“Castiel, my friend. Look at you. You got your man! Good for your feathers” Crowley finds a seat next to Donna and gives her an appreciative once over. “Oh, before I forget- I brought a date.” He snaps his fingers and suddenly
Castiel has come to think of his very long existence in terms of before and after- Dean. It's blasphemy he is aware, but it does not change anything.  He has searched his heart on many occasions, and he's concluded that his existence only gained meaning in the after.
They lost Shane and Zeus with him, leaving a very traumatized mother and son behind. At least the curse was broken. Dean thinks as they watch the flames consume what's left of Prometheus in the rear-view mirror.
In all the ages, he had never witnessed a more beautiful sight. He had recoiled at the unbidden thought. Reason won out, and he calmed- he had never laid eyes on the Most High. He would not need to strike himself down for such irreverence.
“I’m not letting you do this! There has to be another way. Damnit, Dean!” Sam storms out of the room, intent on finding a way out of this. He’s been working on a theory ever since the Guardian mentioned the trials. That was the first indication that his visions had any bearing on what they were working on.
like they are kissing and there is no more talking for a bit. He stares at the bubbles in his glass as they float up to the surface. He feels like his heart is bubbling with joy just like that right now. He always knew Cas was perfect for his brother, but he never knew just
“I see. Thank you for your help in that.” Castiel is staring at Sam, looking with his extra senses, Sam can feel the probing grace.
“Dean. I love you too. I have for a long time. It was always you.” Cas says, and he feels like his blood is warming him with every beat of his heart as the feeling spreads through him.
“I know. “Sam replies. Dean’s aura is a swirling mix of colors again, and Sam gets drenched in Dean’s mess of emotions. It’s a roiling stew of concern, fear, anxiety, and it’s going to make Sam dizzy if he can’t reign it in.
“Nothing new. He is still angry about me almost dying. He is blaming himself.” Cas admits looking down at his hands. He knows Dean doesn’t want Sam to know what happened between them but it would be nice to have someone to talk to about it.
“Yeah, I am giving you away Pop, so let’s get this show on the road huh? “she slips her arm around his shoulder and drag him back to the hallway before he can get out a protest. Dean laughs out of sheer joy and some relief that this is working out.
“Cas? Is that really you man? Dean what happened?” Sam gets out in rapid fire as he falls to his knees next to them and reaches out to grab hold of Cas’ shoulder.
"You're not gonna tell me? Seriously? How am I not team Winchester? Fine. Whatever it is, you okay dying over it?  You don't want to say, fine. But remember, I spent time in your brother. I know his sad, little thoughts and feelings.
He was so focused on analyzing the minutia that he missed the big friggin rom-com happening right in his face. Looking back it makes everything seem glaringly obvious.
“Come on Sam- it’s a salt and burn. No need to take everyone.” Dean grouses from the sink his back is rigid, he still hasn’t forgiven Mary for lying to them and nearly getting Cas killed.
Dean and keeps pumping his cock in steady firm strokes. He can feel Dean’s orgasm build- his balls tighten and his hips sputter before he is coming. Painting his hand and the sheets with his seed.
He had been distrustful of John’s reaction when he was told about Dean’s marriage and family- and it turns out he was right to be. Maybe John had just been pretending around other people, or maybe he thought he could handle a gay son. But now coming face to face with the reality he reverted back to the John he knew and remembered.
"What line? What do you mean, its' ending?" Sam is suddenly anxious; he feels responsible for something- deep in his heart; he knows she is telling the truth, but he has no idea about what.
“Dean you looked so beautiful, I was sure I was going to end up smiting several people for undressing you with their eyes last night. I have never felt so…
Sam had found a tome supposedly written by a fallen angel who chronicled the Flood. Abner had mentioned that the Guardians had acted as intermediaries between God and the Old ones. He had not been able to figure out what came of that or who the Old ones were.
“Get this, it wasn’t always a fraternity, look.” Sam says excitedly pointing at his screen “ Between 1949 and 1960, the Lowell… 'Home for Children' … housed upwards of forty adolescents: runaways, juvenile delinquents, and emotionally disturbed teenagers from the area.”
"That we can! Speaking of-I think I found us some schmucks. Demon signs ten years ago in Shoshone, Idaho. Big time mojo. Meet the Cassidy' s-small time farmers who struck oil a la Hillbillies style in '03. "
Mary starts laughing nervously. It’s hard for her to think of her boys as men, let alone men with needs and desires. She is pretty sure that sound was not something heard outside of a bedroom very often and she is a little concerned about Dean’s relationship with food at this moment.
"They are breaching the divide. Every minute they get stronger and draw closer. There is but one way to end this, and the time is almost at hand Sentinel. You must prepare the Blade and the Scabbard. It will be difficult for there is much suffering to bear witness to before the ripening. You must find the sacred place for the Iungo; the soothsayer will help."
I am sad to let this one go- it made me so happy. But alas now I have to focus on finishing Medical school. I will see you all on the other side of board exams. All my love!
. Which was a whole other mystery. Sure, purgatory was no picnic. He had wanted to get the heck out of there as fast as he could. But having been in Hell himself he really didn’t think it was the worst place they’d ever been.
Sam smiles as he slings his arms around Eileen to his left and his mother on his right pulling both women in for a short hug. “Come on- we need to crash for a few hours before we head out”.
“Wow, just wow. I mean we have seen some shit, Dragons, fairies- and I know we didn’t think Angels were real a few years back but this? This is
"This was not possible, Castiel. You should have remained entirely unaware of my direction. In all of time this has never happened." Naomi tells him. He sees fear pass in her eyes- briefly – but he caught it.
might be the one to leave a sock on the door tonight. He glanced over at Dean who was talking to Cas in a booth across the room. At least it seemed like he wasn’t going to get lucky tonight.
"All in good time, boy. Would you care for some Posca, it's rather good?" She gracefully lowers herself to the pillow and pours the warm spiced wine into a cup.
“Thank you, Dean.” Mary walks over and joins her sons at the table. “Where’s Cas?” she wants to show them that she cares about the Angel and asking after him seems like a reasonable place to start. Dean clears his throat and shifts in his chair.
"Seriously?" Sam gives him a bitch face from across the table and follows it with an eye roll. "Sometimes, you're incredibly insensitive; you know that?"
Before Dean finishes his pie and third beer, Cas abruptly says goodnight and zaps to wherever it is that he goes when he isn't with them. Sam gets a sense
He was still mulling things over. He knew he was going to have to have a serious talk with Dean and maybe even Cas soon. He hadn’t mentioned the cord or the nagging idea that it was the cause for all these vision quests. He still didn’t understand why the spell would have triggered this either- it had nothing to do with his original question no matter how he tried to force that to fit the puzzle.
“Oh, yeah great idea. Cas. Room” Dean gets out before bending slightly and picking Castiel up. Cas wraps his legs around Dean and they start stumbling down the dark hallway and into the first door they find. Never breaking their kiss.
. But them getting horizontal is just part one of the grand plan- they were supposed to have a kid. “A Child born of true love between the Righteous man and his Protector, who will bar the gates of Hell and ring in peace between the heavens” that’s a quote from the prophecy by the way- no way I can make
Cas tugs Dean to him using the belt of his dead guy robe. He goes, sliding into the space between Cas’ legs. He closes the distance and kisses Cas innocently. It’s just a light brush of lips but he feels it all the way down his spine. Cas makes a soft happy sound and pulls Dean flush against him. Cas has an unfair advantage- his mojo means no refractory period and the guy can get hard in no time.
The guy looks about as good as Dean feels. His face is pale, and there are dark circles around his eyes.
He was sure that the symbology of a chain, as he understood it, meant slavery or bondage. Some restriction from being free. He also knew that heaven wasn’t what they sold you in Sunday school, so maybe that was just an angel thing? But he was sure the terror and defeated expressions he’d seen on Cas’ face was a strong enough hint that this was something else. Cas didn’t always look like that before he hopped on angel express. That was new.
"Not really, I will let you know, though, or you might have to come visit me in a padded room after all," he tried to lighten the mood before hugging her goodbye.
Sam and Mary stand back and watch as tiny vines, spread like creepy fingers from under the door. They watch helplessly as the door itself fuses into the doorframe, becoming one. Sealing off the room.
He wasn’t finding anything else that fit, though. He figured if it were symbolic of an older spell, he’d need occult texts, maybe even help from an actual witch since he had no idea how many potential spells there were that had their own unique calling card.
They come seconds apart. Dean coats their chests in his spendings and Cas empties deep inside Dean. Dean will never get his fill of that either.
“What does this mean? What is it that you want to happen here?” Dean chokes out and he swears his Man Card is getting revoked for wanting to talk about
This bunker the boys found is truly a remarkable place. He was really surprised when Sam had filled him in on Henry and how that had come to be. He thinks it's going to take him a very long time to get right with that. He spent most of his life being bitter and feeling rejected by his father, he’s not sure how to reconcile that with what he’s learned.
Dean huffs in frustration- his bubble burst, and his energy finally resolving as relief settles in his gut. Sam watches them closely and frowns a little when the light around Cas reaches for Dean's, and his aura settles down in its usual calm. Fascinating.
“Um, John. John Winchester. Who are you?” John says, trying not to jump to any conclusions. His mind is still reeling from the whiplash that was last night. He doesn’t remember anyone mentioning a teenager living in the bunker. He knows Cas now, and the only other person he is aware of is their baby Jack.
“Um, right. Ok” he bends down and fireman carries the crazed dude to the porch which is where he decides to snap out of it.
"Dude, what is up with you? You have been giving me the queer eye all day, and now you are staring at me like I have a tail- or something. What gives?" Dean asks.
Benny had found him and Bobby merely hours after they popped back from Hell. The place was huge and wild and riddled with monsters and leviathan. But he’d found them quickly.
Later that week they were driving back from Nebraska after dealing with a good old fashioned haunting. Cas and Kevin had stayed behind to work on translating a spell they wanted to use on Metatron.
This chapter is mostly catching up with cannon- I had to include these two episodes for plot progression.
Dean and Sam pack up the Impala, and Castiel decides to check on the state of Heaven before he meets them in Kansas.
“Morning Dean. I was wondering how much longer you would fight your appetite” Cas says with a poorly hidden smirk.
Carl had been killed by a hellhound. Dean had almost left thinking they'd missed their shot. Then Cas convinced him more than one family member had made a deal since Carl had made his for his wife. Alice had told him the story of how they'd met, and it fit the bill. They were expecting the rest of the Cassidy family to come in for the funeral, so it should be easier to figure out who else made a deal, with them all under the same roof.
It was hard keeping his distance all these years but now that he’s had a taste. He has never been very strong, and right now his resolve is crumbling like a sand castle in the tide. Getting swept up in everything
“No clue. One of the files just had a note written in the margin about room 7B and the word "weird" with three exclamation points.” Sam shrugs as he starts skimming the file.
"When you um, woke up…I got a glimpse of some stuff." Sam looks uncomfortable, sensing that Castiel is disturbed by his insight.
Sam had checked on Cas after dinner, and they had decided that looking for the tablet was their first course of action. Cas was still clearly upset about what Dean had said and the realization that he'd have to make the final choice between Heaven and Earth soon. Sam texted Dean since he still hadn't come back.
gesture and started chewing his lip as he watched Cas intently. Cas’ lifted the top up and his eye brows shot up at what he saw. He reached in and took out a ring, plain silver an exact copy of the ring Dean always wore. He lifted it up between his thumb and forefinger and looked at Dean with a carefully neutral expression on his face.
Its agonizingly delicious to feel the fluttering in his muscles clench around him as if to draw him over the edge with a physical pull. They move together one more time before the pleasure crashes down over them and Cas bites down at the base of Deans neck. Dean screams out what sounds like Cas’ name in an abstract way and bites down on Cas’ neck in turn.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"Hey, uh Cas, buddy. Could you pop in? Me and Sam wanted to talk to you about something important. We're outside at Rufus'." Dean's prayer sounds as awkward as ever, but Sam smiles when he sees that now-familiar pink light.
"You were lying on the floor naked, severely dehydrated and hypothermic, cardiac arrest was imminent," Cas scolds, taking the now empty glass and placing it on the table.
"He is injured, I have tried healing him, but I can't get it all, it's not a natural ailment, it afflicts his very being. His soul." Castiel says, sounding guilty like it's his fault.
“Make me yours. I wanna be yours.” Dean punches out between thrusts as he actively fucks himself back on Cas’ cock making his own heavy member slap wildly between their bodies. Cas had to let it go to get a better grip on Deans’ shoulders.
. He isn’t expendable. She needs to know that before I can trust her again.” Dean says and he looks so
“You want me to write novels?” Kevin asked irritation coming through his voice and his frown deepened.
I apologize for the delay and the short chapter. I went through the whole thing- cleaned it up, fixed some continuity errors and it took all afternoon. I plan to write more tonight and some tomorrow so feedback will be greatly appreciated and motivational! <3
Dean gets the feeling that he’s been sleeping for a while. His limbs feel dead, and when he wiggles his toes, they send thousands of tingling sensations up and down his legs. His stomach feels hollow, and his bladder is bursting.
“Ok, well whatever. Just go easier on Mom ok. And stop using Cas as an emotional punching bag. The guys’ had a rough go of it.” Sam says standing and walking over to the door.
He stops dead in his tracks at the sight. There on the couch is Dean and Cas. Tangled in each other. Their hair sticking up wildly. Purple marks visible on both their throats and naked as the day they were born. Well in Deans case anyway.
He remembers the expansive training room in which he had been forced to murder Dean over and over.  Eleven hundred and seventy-three times to be exact. Each time he succumbed to the torture and did as he was commanded a part of him shattered. Something deep in his grace fractured with each blade he thrust into the man he saved from the clutches of Hell all those years ago.
“He- um, woke up, and I think he’s usually filtered or something, but since he was dazed- he was just all angelic, and my brain short-circuited.”  Sam thinks that’s about as close to an explanation as he’s got right now. He can’t really bring himself to look at Cas, not again, he needs to let what he saw settle a bit.
"Sorry. Have we met?" Dean hates it when they are on uneven footing- owing the guy is bad enough, but he's got the beat on them, and he doesn't like it.
Dean gets worse. His body overheats and then spikes so cold in the next instant that he can't even wear clothes. He stays in bed and alternates between snuggling up with all the blankets Sam could find and kicking them all off to feel a breeze on his overheated skin. He coughs up bright red blood in alarming quantities and can't keep food or water down.
“Yes, it does. Doesn’t it.” Mary interjects sounding apologetic. “Sorry for asking this but the children you cared for… were any of them ever sick or did something ever happen to any of them?” Mary hedges trying to keep the woman on their side.
Sam can tell he's putting up a front, his aura shrunk in on itself. He was more affected by the traumatic Hellhound encounter than Sam was- seeing as it was his flesh being ripped up. As he watches, Cas' light automatically reaches over towards Dean's, and it seems to soothe the cowering energy. He's fascinated and wonders if Dean can feel it. Cas is still standing at least two feet from Dean and doesn't seem to be aware of what he's doing either. But Dean's light slowly starts to recover.
He didn’t see anything explicitly mentioning the meaning of the symbology. Still, he did find a paragraph that implied heavily that spells would manifest in a manner consistent with occult symbology. It did, however, make an exception stating that some truly ancient magic would not be this accommodating. Of course- there was always an exception. If the spell was from the time of magic, if it was powerful and old- it might have its own identifying symbol—a name tag of a sort- unique to the witch or wizard who crafted it.
"The Guardians, they are old. Far older than me. They exist outside time and space. They are agents of balance. I have not heard of them since the Flood. Tell me what you saw." Castiel leaned forward a fraction and was now squinting at Sam with his full concentration. It always makes Sam squirm to be at the receiving end of that- he has no idea how Dean can stare back for minutes at a time and seem entirely calm.
Thanks for sticking with it...sorry for the crazy posting schedule. I am hoping to complete this in the next three weeks. It's looking like we might be halfway...still working out the details. Please let me know if you have any thoughts-do you hate it or love it or what did you have for breakfast :)  <3
“Urhg. Fuck! Cas. Cas…. aah!” Dean says before his vocabulary fails him entirely and he is making only guttural sounds of pleasure. Cas works his tongue inside
"No! Look whatever gets your motor going – as long as its between consenting adults- but their whole master-pet thing on top of different species thing. It gave me the heebies. I mean, the power dynamic is all whacked, and she's a dog, Sam!"
“I…I don’t know man. He just woke up.” Dean says gruffly, Cas knows he is trying to give him a minute to collect himself and he is thankful that Dean can read him so well.
"Uh. It was weird- I don't think it was a dream exactly. It was like a vision or something." Sam starts, and Dean puts the breakfast on the table and joins them.
“I do by the way…"return your feelings" “he says with a low voice and he crashes their lips together.
Sam could see that Dean was being vulnerable- this happened so rarely that he chose his words carefully “So what…are you guys getting serious?” Sam knew they could never be casual- they had such a strong connection and he always figured once Dean let himself
“I um. I want to give you your wedding gift.” Dean says, and a deep flush covers his cheeks and disappears beneath his high collar.
“Cas babe, that was an expression – he meant you got me to commit. He wasn’t talking about sex.” Dean explained trying to keep from laughing at Cas and flashing back to that memory.
He hands Cas his set of glasses and instructs him to keep the family in the house when they hear a howl outside. He goes after it but runs into Noah and his youngest daughter, heading into the woods with a shotgun instead. They'd been intent on shooting the "wolf" that killed Carl.  He persuades them to let him come along.
Dean just sighs in exasperation, and his colors swirl wildly, making it hard for Sam to focus on his brother. The light changes colors in rapid succession and flares unpredictably until it seems to settle. Dean surges a sense of indebtedness when he pictures Benny. It's a bone-deep sense of gratitude that Sam isn't sure he's even capable of.
He was impressed on the second night, slightly baffled on the third but the fourth night was just ridiculous. But there it was- Dean’s Chewbacca sock. He was tired of having to kill time while Dean was banging a new floozy every night. They had a case to work on and he needed a full night’s sleep.
have implied that it was to Amelia- and there was a pang of disappointment that it wasn’t the truth. He also felt that voice that liked to point out when he was being a hypocrite start to say something, but he shut it down before it could.
Sam had just brought Bobby back from Purgatory and something was bothering him. He was distracted at the time but now, now that he had a minute he could think about it.
“You’re telling me. I’m still waiting for the other shoe to drop.” Dean nuzzles into Cas’ neck. “Enough about that- there's sure to be plenty of drama and intrigue at breakfast tomorrow. He doesn’t know what Jack is. So, let's enjoy the peace for now, whadda ya say?”
Mary can’t stand it any longer and shoots up to get in the woman’s face before Sam has a chance to “Well, someone should! You traumatized and abused these children, who are now, undoubtedly extremely disturbed adults. You ruined lives, Mrs. Holt. Not to mention the fact that what you did has manifested itself as a murderous presence that threatens more lives. You have a lot to answer for!”
“Mmm. The bonding I can’t speak to- since I have never shared that with anyone or know any who have. I believe we were very uniquely suited for it though, it took with surprising and delightful ease. And as for the sex, I have been told I am a skilled lover.” Cas deadpans from his hiding place, nestled in his husband’s shoulder.
That thought is beyond terrifying. Especially since Kevin still doesn't know everything it says. It might have instructions on how to auto-destruct earth for all they knew.
“Thank you, Sam. I’m glad you know now, but could you please leave. Your brother was busy fellating me and I would like him to finish.” Cas deadpanned from behind Dean who turned so red Sam could swear he was glowing.
His what? What are they to each other? He knows Cas loves him. He said so. He knows Cas kissed him back but does that mean what Dean wants it to mean? Was it just a reflex? Does Cas even care about physical stuff? He knows Cas had sex when he was human, but he’s all juiced up again. Does that change things? Why did he seem so angry? Was he just frustrated cause of the whole cockblocking Sam thing?
He hadn't known what to do the first time it happened; they had been outside Milwaukee after barely escaping the police. There had been a series of murders that turned out to be a deranged warlock who could use glamour spells to look like anyone. He'd used Sam's appearance to seduce his last victim.  They had been up since the night before, but there had been a Clint Eastwood special on TV. Dean had insisted Cas "needed" to see the one that was playing.
Cas now had more than one, Dean had teased him about his ever-growing collection of clothes – they had had to drag a second dresser into their room just last month. And here he was, wearing the exact one that put this whole plan into motion. Dean had to chuckle a little and shook his head as he reached out to adjust it just a little.
"It's all over you- like a magical stench. It's like having garlic breath after eating Italian. Not everyone knows what they're smelling, but anyone can tell it stinks," she gently chided him.
Dean's aura flashes a pinkish hue, and he gets a sense of embarrassment and concern from his brother.
Both brothers are more tactile then he thinks they’d like to admit- always touching the people they love in a way that reassures them they really are with them. Cas finds the touch grounding and he slumps against Dean when he sees his wings burned into the ground around them. He feels like he can’t breathe again.
"Get your mind out of the gutter, Samantha. I fell asleep on the couch, and the creeper just sat there all night, again. I must have slumped over a bit. "Dean frowns when the crick in his neck doesn't release.  As Sam watches Cas sidles over and wordlessly reaches out to place his hand against Dean's neck, there's a brief glow again and both their aura's roar to life and blend into each other as Cas heals the stiff muscles. Sam is distracted by the warm emotions and the blinding red cord when Kevin finally rejoins them.
“Mary is right, it’s not your fault. You were under the influence of some powerful magic.” Eileen signs.
“No- thanks tho, Babe. Come with me to the kitchen and I’ll make us some sandwiches?” Dean offers instead.
“It’s’ good to see you boys. Now somebody mind explaining to me just what the hell is going on?” Bobby says as he steps back to look Sam and Dean over.
He drained his second cup of coffee in nearly one pull and asked for a refill from their cute waitress. She was clearly giving him the once over but Dean barely noticed.
“This is fun!” Jack beams at John. “Can you make pies? Pop loves pies and I’d like to make him one for his birthday.”
He has been getting visions and even had a visit from The Arch Angel, as in only one left. The whole angel, demon, leviathan tablet thing was over. And foolishly he had expected that to be the end of this crazy chapter of his life- but no. He wasn’t done being all
“Dean,” he says and his voice is so low it even surprises him. It's pure sex. In that one word is so many things. He knows that his lover understands and hears them all. There is love there- unspeakable love and fierce loyalty and now-
“Yeah, campus security didn’t have much either. Just some weird stories-kids doing dumb stuff like playing spin the bottle and breaking the bottle- some minor cuts and a weird incident with a girl cutting off her hair in the bathroom last weekend. Like Natalie-Portman-style with a straight razor.” Dean embraces the change of subject- breezing right past his slip up.
"No, thanks." Sam can't imagine drinking something warm in this heat, and he begrudgingly sits down across from her. He finds himself trusting her instinctually even if the hunter in him remains weary.
Sam lets out a breath he didn't realize he was holding as his mind races to make a thousand connections- he's starting to understand but there are still some things he needs to puzzle out. "Thanks, Missouri! This is great stuff- let me know if you learn anything else!" and with that, he hangs up and starts to scribble notes furiously.
There was a burst of light, and then the demon was lying on the floor- her chest burst open like something had broken out of her rib cage.
“He’s okay, Dean. I mean, when he’s healing you, his grace fades a little, but it comes back after a while, and it hasn’t stopped him from lighting up around you.” Sam blurts out, realizing too late that he shouldn’t have said that much.
on her way. She was not a smooth liar and she had no idea what this was about. She figures most of them are still sleeping off the booze from last night. They had celebrated her arrival in classic style by drinking most of the fancy whiskey she brought as gifts.
“Cas” Dean gets out and he has a tear running down his cheek again. He looks grateful and vulnerable.
"I'm starting to think I was being naïve. When I thought we'd get through whatever this thing that's coming at us is. But I'm starting to think we're… I'm not getting out of this unscathed."
He feels a soothing hand on his shoulder, the cool burn of grace submerges his frantic mind and calms it. Easing him out of the storm, that is Cas.  He starts breathing steady and slow. His eyes flit open, and he stares into the blue depths of the utterly unfathomable creature.
Several hours later Sam comes back from his supply run. He really hopes that Cas and his brother actually used the time he gave them to talk cause this was starting to wear on him.
. Take what he doesn’t deserve but what has been given to him regardless. He expected to feel at least a tingling of doubt, of questioning the wisdom of giving in to this. To overthink it at least in passing. For this leaves him vulnerable. This means if Cas ever does leave again- he won’t survive it. Not
Walking back to the car he starts feeling wrong about letting Cas bunk with Mary. He knows she didn’t actually
Later, Cas is standing in front of a hot grill, anxiously flipping steaks and trying not to smite the whole thing when Ellie walks over.
Dean smiles nervously at Cas and leans into him. “So you do not want to have babies with me?” Cas asks looking at Dean sideways.
They reach the angel at the same time, Dean falling to his knees and cradling Cas' face between his hands.
“How is Mary handling everything. This must be bracing for her.” Cas asks after Dean opens his own beer and then he starts slicing the tomatoes.
“No, no you’re not wrong. I want you too Cas. I just wanted to make sure that we are on the same page here. I don’t think I can go back- if we do this. This changes things. I can’t do this with you and just be your friend, your brother. You hear me?” he hoped that Cas got it. He wasn’t ready to say the L word - not yet. But he needed Cas to understand that this meant something to him, that they were going to be
“I believe that I am in love with you Dean. And based on my understanding of human interactions I believe you wanted to have intercourse with me last night. This leads me to suspect that you return my feelings. Is this true?” Cas finishes that weighty statement with his signature head tilt and squint.
for me Sammy. I can’t imagine not being with him and sometimes that scares the shit out of me. He just keeps
kitchen is his oldest son. His pride and joy. His perfect boy. On his knees. Betraying everything John held dear. He raised him better than this. Goddamit he wasn’t a perfect father -far from it- but he did better than to deserve this.
The God of the pantheon. King of the Gods, wielder of lightning. His light was near blinding even after all the lightning bolts died down. He emitted power that made Sam's teeth hurt.
Dean dreams of forever that night. Picking up a cat at the shelter because he knows it’s something that would make Cas happy. Showering together after spending the day digging in the dirt outside, planting flowers for the bees that Cas raises. Going on hunts together and never picking up another faceless body for comfort after a hard day but losing himself in the arms of his lover. He dreams of picking out a ring at a pawn shop and nonchalantly slipping in on Cas’ finger after pancakes. Of how Sammy will freak out over the “big step” but knowing that Cas was always going to be it for him. Of Mary calling Cas her son in law and of Sam’s kids calling them uncles. Of Claire teasing him for being the world’s lamest stepdad. Of Jody quietly telling him, she is proud of him. He doesn’t have a nightmare that night.
She also knows more about the tablets, then she has revealed thus far. Only stating that they hold immense power- over all the realms- and should be kept safe in Heaven.
“Are you asking me to “go steady” Dean Winchester?” Cas deadpans with his absurd air quotes that he is using correctly for the first time ever. Dean loses it. He bursts out laughing and it’s the real kind, the laugh that boils up from your stomach and has you fold over out of sheer delight. Cas joins him and soon they are both gasping for air trying to calm down.
Dean rolled his eyes and barked: “Can it Sam!” before Sam could say a word, “We are not doing this right now. If you don’t want me to spit in your French toast, you’ll drop it.”  And with that he turned back to the stove and started laying the bread out.
Across from his tent are others, pulled in a half-circle around a large fire pit. He can hear people talking, but he doesn't understand the language. It's rough and guttural but flows beautifully. He thinks it might be Arabic. The sun is high in the sky, and he is most certainly in a dessert. It must be at least a hundred and ten degrees; his brow is dripping sweat, and his back feels sticky already. He is grateful for the lack of pants.
“Oh my god! No way!!! Are you freaking serious?” Sam says way too loudly as he looks from Dean to Cas and then to Jack.
Heading down the hall in his running shorts, he detoured on his way to the kitchen. Going to the library instead when he saw the lights were on. It was probably Castiel, and he'd check in with him, let him know about Missouri, so he didn't accidentally smite her.
. She told him how she had felt so confused and lost trying to fit into the lives of her two grown sons. Strangers to her. Sons who had lived – longer than she ever had, who had died – multiple times, who had saved the world –
“I treated them as I would my own flesh and blood-“ Ms. Holt continues. “I gave them hugs and praise when they were good, and punished them when they were
It's been working for them; their friendship felt more solid than it had in years. He just wished he could get back to that with Sam. The kid was keeping things from him; he was sure of that, and the whole Benny thing had made things go sideways. At least he and Cas were good.
“So, they never left the life? There was never anyone special?  I mean I know there was Jess for Sam, he took that hard. It broke my heart to watch him suffer like that. But did he ever try again?” John asked Mary over coffee later that day.
"Urgh" comes a weak sound from one of the shower stalls, and Cas follows it. He finds Dean curled up on the floor, shivering and barely conscious. Cas bends down and scoops Dean into his arms, something he would never dare to do with an alert Winchester, and carries him swiftly back to his room.
“What do you got there?” he asks, pointing at something in Cas’s hands grateful for the distraction. Cas lifts it to show an old film real.
"You okay?" Dean asks a little concerned about her behavior; he's only known her for a week, but this does not seem like a typical night, and she has lost a lot of people in a short time.
“Name’s Gabriel. Might’a heard of me?” the stranger said casually standing up and walking over to stand right in front of Kevin.
"Hey, Cas, listen … it's Dean. He's in a bad way- do you think you could come back and see –" before he finished his request Cas was standing in the hallway next to him. "Thanks, man- he's in the bathroom," Sam indicates the door to their communal restroom with a nod of his head. Just knowing Cas will take over the watch for a while makes him feel lighter, and he watches Cas take off towards Dean- the red chord pulsing rapidly as he goes.
"Yeah, exactly. Only it's not just shifters. I see other magic and people's aura or something. It's hard to explain- I am still trying to make sense of it all," Sam tries, dancing around the subject as delicately as he can.
. I mean I cared about people before, Lisa and Ben. But it was different. It was almost like a job. Like I did it because it was the right thing to do, I went through the motions with them. I did love them. I would have done anything for them- but I dunno. It was never like what we have.” He smiles softly and takes a moment to rub his palm along Cas’ cheek in a reverent sort of gesture.
. Cas had seemed to want to pretend like nothing happened between them what was is he said, “Sam doesn’t need to know”. And here he was practically dry humping the guy in the back seat.
"He zapped ahead of us, place is Angel-proofed, so he's waiting for us to take out the warding before he can go in" Dean relays, still sounding pissed off but wanting to get to work.
"You can hide from the spell? How do you do that?" Sam asks, there's no point in lying to this woman, she could always see through all the crap.
“Yeah, shitty mattress. I miss the memory foam already.” He lies easily and sits down at the table. Mary is lacing her boots on the couch and shoots him a sheepish look.
He knows a red string is prominent in Kabbalah, but he’s pretty sure that wards off evil and have seven knots if he remembers what Brady had told him when he was still at Stanford. Brady had been into every trending fad- even religious ones, which was almost painfully ironic since Sam’s learned he was possessed by a demon the whole time. So, he wasn’t putting much stock into that belief.
I just have to say - you guys have been amazing. I have never had so many people engage and give feedback and it is incredibly rewarding. I always like sharing my stories but I struggle feeling motivated to go through the trouble sometimes but this has been so great! Thank you to everyone who subscribed, bookmarked, kudo'ed and especially commented. I love you all!
He usually hates it when people talk during movies, but Cas is hilarious, his dry commentary about inaccuracies and his confusion about the cheesy plots are often more entertaining than the actual film. It's one of his favorite past times, and it makes him feel like he's just a regular guy hanging out with his weird friend. It soothes something in his chest that he doesn't look at too hard.
Dean slaps at his hand, gulps down his food so he can talk, "Hey Samantha, if you want people food-get your own!"
"Where are we? When are we?" Sam has time-traveled before, perks of being friends with an angel, and he can tell this is real.
tie on that door and the hickey poking out from Dean’s collar the next day- he might’ve been slow to catch on too.
He doesn't get why everyone seems so worried about this chick back in the desert and her baby drama. The world looks relatively stable to him at the moment- they still have the tablets to figure out, but no one is actively out there trying to end everything. So, he tries to take his mind of his constant worry for his brother with spaghetti westerns, junk food, beer and his best friend. It's a winning combination- works every time.
"It sure gives your whacky visions context- but I still don't understand what we make of it," she finishes.
Kevin tried to think if he had missed any signs- he hated how distracting this whole “prophet” gig was. He was Kevin Tran-
“I can’t say that it was how I had hoped for us to make love either.” And Dean can’t help but blush when he hears Cas say
When he takes Dean into his mouth his husband curses loudly “Fuck Cas!” and lifts his hips off the bed in a display of wanton abandon. He sucks him down his throat and swallows once, twice. Then he pulls off till just the head remains. He runs his tongue around it swirling it like it’s the best thing he has ever tasted. And heaven help him if that isn’t the truth. He loves doing this to Dean. It makes him so pliant, so open, he loses himself in the pleasure he is able to draw out of him. Once he has Dean slick with spit and pre-come he pops off. Dean makes a sound noting his displeasure.
Sam starts hyperventilating. Clutching at his head as it is inundated with so much, too much. He feels blood begin to trickle out of his ears, and he hears Dean’s alarmed yelling. But all he can do is try to breathe as his entire being is engulfed in Castiel.
“Yeah no, I mean same here Cas. You’re every bit my brother as much as Dean is. Um, I meant the first part. “ And he shoots Cas one of his soft questioning looks. He is trying to be delicate but he might just have to come out with it and ask directly.
Dean takes his place in front of Cas again and beams at him. “I now pronounce you husband and husband. Ok now you kiss…not that you need to be told.” She finishes lamely cause Dean and Cas are already devouring each other’s mouths like they
Dean wanted to stop by Kevin's first for some "demon bombs," and Sam saw an opening. He suggested they split up- he would start to scour the town looking for possible locations for Crowley's base. And if he happened to find a spot to do the ritual, that would just be- fortuitous. He felt a strange urgency to get to the bottom of this before it bites them in the ass like everything else seems to. Dean and Cas took the car, and he started for the abandoned warehouse district near the rail yard.
He mumbles something about her being a smart ass and pushes the raspberry and dark chocolate drink over to her.
Sam is suddenly flung past the landing on the second floor and dragged into the bathroom from earlier by an invisible force. The spirit pulls him into the bathtub and pushes him under the water. He fights to sit up but its hard to fight against something you can’t see. He struggles and rages against it- he can see the shapes of ghostly children looking down at him.
"I told that brother of yours that I ain't' a magic eight ball, I can only read your thoughts and energy. I can't read him and the other one by talking to you."
They hadn't really talked to each other since he got back from Texas. There wasn't much to be said-unless Dean felt like being straight with him, and he wasn't waiting around for hell to freeze over.  Sam had to figure this out before Dean did something reckless. Again.
“Naw. Wait. You really think he likesss me??” Dean asks with such a hopeful look on his stupid face that Sam almost chokes.
“Man, that was a long ass day,” Dean says sighing before taking a big gulp of his cold beer and working his tie loose.
He felt like he was having a mental break or that he ate some special mushrooms- like that one time in high school when he accidentally did just that. When he spent the whole night talking to a mermaid in the bathtub that turned out to be a koi fish in a pond in the back yard of some doctor's house. The man had called the cops and Sam had to run- if John ever found out he had let his guard down like that, there would have been hell to pay.
and it took me a while to trust that.”  He flicked his eyes up to meet Sam’s with a small shrug. He seemed lighter- like those words had been weighing on him.
"The beasts can be any number of things. I will have to look into it. I do not like the sound of them." Cas adds clearly thinking about a million things he knows about, trying to make this all make sense.
"He's lucky to have your help Cas, we knew this might be a suicide mission, I just wish it was me." Sam tries to make the burden lighter for Cas. Knowing that Cas will admonish him for the last part, he instead changes the subject "So Meg, huh?"
“Hello, Dean.” He says when he stops in front of the hunter. Sam watches almost out of habit now as the cord flames bright as they get closer to one another. It wakes in him a sense of urgency – like he needs to figure it out- but it also makes him smile because he gets a sense of peace and contentment when it flares. He’s not sure whether to attribute it to the cord or to the two men who always seem to lighten when in each other’s company. Sam thinks it’s terribly sweet that his brother and his best friend share their burdens with each other on such a deeply spiritual level. He’s sure they aren’t even aware of it, or Dean would no doubt find a way to tamp it down.
