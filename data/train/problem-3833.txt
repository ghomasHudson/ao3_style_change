He sees Dean shift in his seat, looking uncomfortable all of a sudden and that drives him out of his thoughts.
There are so many things they need to discuss but for now they just lay in the safety of Castiel’s bedroom and because Dean can sense him, driving himself insane with his thoughts he presses a kiss in his shoulder and presses closer to him. After a while he feels him sag against him and that’s how he falls asleep.
Sam wants to give it a go but Dean won’t let him, even if Aphrodite claims he has a pretty good grasp on it, but she did call Sam the good looking brother so what does she know.
“He does that for everyone?”
“Thank you” he says and something ugly curls in Dean’s chest, nudging at the back of his mind.
“Shut up”
Castiel gets up and sits on the ugly brown couch next to him reaches across and kisses him deeply, making Dean gasp and he slips his tongue in his mouth and Dean lets out a moan, low in his throat. Castiel pulls away slowly and Dean flushes remembering where he is. The other man watches him and Dean knows he looks like an idiot, eyes unfocused, cheeks red and lips parted, breathing heavily.
Dean glances at Gabriel, who frowns at him, and he just shrugs in response before following Castiel, who is already inside the cinema.
“So you don’t kill me. A deal is a deal.”
Right. Dean recognizes the name but only vaguely, and honestly what does Sam expect from him? He always goes on and on about his job and his colleagues, and not that Dean isn’t interested but it’s so much he can retain.
For a second he feels defeated, his shoulders dropping. Then he jumps up annoyed with himself for feeling like this, because that is what this man wants. He glances at the letter and wants to tear it apart and burn it.
“No” he repeats louder and walks past him in the elevator that is opening on this floor and he gets in.
“I said no.” He gets up, abandons his open laptop and heads to his room. “Help Donna with the case,” he shouts just before he rounds the corner.
“Yes” Then he looks at Crowley a little defensively “But that is not why I wanted to talk to him. I noticed after I started talking to him” he felt like he was lying and he had no idea to whom or why.
When Dean doesn’t say anything, he says “I’ll wait here”
deserve it. He bullies everyone he can, and Kevin, especially Kevin and no one does anything. Ever. Or whatever they do is not enough” he shouts and then shags back on the seat. He frowns crossing his arms and looks at Dean almost challengingly.
He pulls back slightly and then he rests his forehead in the other man’s shoulder, breathing deeply, breathing
Novak looks at her a moment longer before saying, with amusement “You googled me”
Dean is wheezing, gasping hands gripping Bobby's jacket as he cries.
He crosses the street and heads to the station. He walks in and heads to the counter. A woman with short hair in a police uniform is there talking to another polish officer. Dean stops in front of them and clears his throat. They turn to look at him and he offers them a smile.
“I am a prostitute”
“Hi, Castiel” Donna says brightly, glancing between him and Dean a bit confused.
“Oh, man,” she sighs but her whole face lights up, “I really hope they keep me after the school year’s over, I mean, I know it’s pretty early and they will tell me in March but ugh, it’s so much fun”
He wants to reach out and touch him, hug him, but he just stands there looking at green eyes, with the table separating them. Castiel feels a certain comfort and reassurance in the knowledge that there is something between them, even though deep down he knows it’s not really there.
He sighs softly and follows him. He stands at the threshold and takes everything in. The kitchen is large and open and grey and Dean loves it. He knows Cas doesn't cook, or he does, he just hates it and he can’t help but think it's a shame with a kitchen like that. His eyes land on Cas, who is watching him and he feels a part of his previous thoughts and weight leave him, even if Cas’ eyes seem to bore into him. He is used to it by now.
Dean nods, tying his laces, “I’ll be back after five. I have to do the check up at the clinic and I need to stop at the store for food. Any requests?”
“Mr. Winchester” He turns his head and looks up at Talbots’ face, who just glances at him, before going back inside her office and calling “Well, come in”.
“So I don’t think you-”
He returns smirking at Dean, who now ignores him pointedly, handing the beers to a woman. He thinks her name is Carmen, Karren something like that, she is a regular on Tuesdays, coming after work with some others, Dean assumes they all work together. When he turns around, he finds Benny behind him eyebrow raised, with the same smug look he has since he saw Dean today.
He exits the building, raising his backpack higher in his shoulder and frown as the sun hits his eyes. It’s the middle of September and even though Dean knows that the weather is going to turn colder and rainy by the end of the month, and he should enjoy the sun and warm (for Chicago) weather, he can’t help but scowl and resent it, wanting the colder days.
He doesn't have flowers like the others, his parents have hydrangeas, Eileen and Sam have lilacs and Claire has white roses. But he doesn't have any. Some days he will wake up, go outside and some will be blooming up, but by the next day they are all dried up.
Then, after a pause. “You will get him Cas”
“I freaked you out”
“Well, if-”
“Yeah right” Sam earns a punch in the shoulder for that and he winces.
“It’s just work” he says quietly, sighing and chews on his lip and Dean doesn't stare.
“Well, I apparently” he says dryly. “Is it good?” he asks after a bit.
He gets up and goes to the other side of the bed, as Dean drinks the orange juice, leaving the empty glass on the night stand. Castiel, turns off the main light, the room being illuminated only by the lamp on his side, it’s dim and cosy, makes something tingle inside Dean, who lays down and turn on his side to look at him. The other man is staring at the ceiling in concentration and Dean knows there are a thousand thoughts crossing his mind, it makes him want to ask him, but he doesn’t have the courage to, not tonight. Instead he moves his hand, stopping for just a second mid movement, before finding Castiel’s.
“Dean” is said in surprise and who can blame him, Dean
“A little” he replies.
He takes a couple of seconds, he snakes a hesitant arm around Cas, who seems to realize his fear and leans down kisses his temple and says in a deep murmur, “I’m still here”
The talk with the wife gives them nothing but a description of a great, quite, small town life. Big surprise there.
“No, I believe you” the guy says and Dean looks at him better this time. He is tall, probably just a little shorter than Dean, with blonde hair and pale blue eyes, that Dean glances at for a moment before returning his gaze to the beer bottle, because something jabs at his chest painfully. He is handsome though. And interested. For some reason though that makes the pressure in Dean’s chest contract.
it, that other people knew about it before him.
Cas nods and drinks from his glass and scrunches his nose, reminding Dean oddly of a cat, “It’s cold”
Dean raises his eyebrows at him and Castiel huffs. “What? Best burger in Washington, DC and you are ordering it with a side salad?”
There is pause, where Cas freezes, but then he chuckles lightly and says with something like astonishment in his voice “You’ve noticed” Dean just shrugs in reply, even if Cas can’t see him and brings the mug to his lips taking another sip.
When the door opens, and Dean sees the face of the other man, he releases a shaky breath and swallows thickly. He wants to say something but he doesn’t know what, he doesn’t know how, his mouth suddenly dry. So, he just stands there staring, first at the shock disbelieving expression of Castiel’s and then watches as the shock fades and turns into something sharp, heat and barely contained want.
He sighs content, then he remembers something and sits up, watching Cas face. He has his eyes closed a peaceful expression on his face, his features soft. Dean can’t help but place his hand on the side of his face lightly, drag his thumb against his lips, feel the vibrations as Cas hums in question, opening his eyes.
“It’s just going to take some time. You yelled at me the other day about all that-” he sees Jack shrink away, “and you had every right to do that. I’m glad you did it.”
She just rolls her eyes at him and says “It’s just because I was in a hurry and-”
An hour before Dean plans on leaving, Sam and Jo come in, both looking tired. But Jo, does perk up when she sees him and snorts, sharing a look with Benny.
“Complicated?”
Dean raises his brows in surprise and takes in all of the man’s face. He is amused and teasing and so fucking hot, Dean can feel his stomach tighten. He doesn't ignore the comment on his vocabulary though.
He follows him down the corridor and they stop at a half-closed door. Dean sees Cas back tense and realises he is not the only one shaking. He squeezes his hand and after a few seconds Cas squeezes back. After a moment he turns around and stares at Dean with something that is gone in an instant. Cas sighs softly, and kisses him again. This time not as desperate. It’s deep and slow, and Dean loves kissing Cas. Especially on his neck,
me, when he both know he can’t with his schedule or he wants to come here for Christmas to spend it with me” he voice raises and he can feel a headache forming. He doesn't know if it’s because of their conversation or thinking about Sam and
Dean had for some time. But then he turned fifteen and it was like a switch had flipped.
It’s a two story building right next to the police station, with the white paint chipped in various places and doors that creak.
“He is a prostitute” he says at last and then adds hastily. “I met him, when I went for information down town and then in the library and then we short of see each other at places.”
be doing. You grieved and now, after, you need to live. That doesn't make you bad, it makes you human.”
Dean never had that, but if there is a one thing he is good at, is pretending. Growing up he had always been the odd one out, the kid that moved around a lot, with different tastes, and the smart kid brother. He told himself it didn't bother him, that Sam was smart, smarter than him, and he was, is amazing, so it was only natural that others would point it out. That it was ok, if the kids and occasional teachers would just side-line him. He was just Dean. And he came last. Until he realised, albeit a little unconsciously, that if you side-line yourself, if you make yourself the ‘out’ then people would notice you, even for a brief moment, they would. And that they wouldn't have high expectations of you. It didn't matter if you fulfilled them or not. And so, it went, until it reached a point where it didn't hurt as much and then hurt turned into a numbness. Or so Dean thought, as far as no none touched him.
When he comes back out, Sam behind him, head down, barely glancing at Castiel when Dean introduces them. They say their goodbyes to Becky, who gives Castiel her phone number, and he promises to call her, which Dean ignores, buries is it deep inside his mind and ignores it. Like Sam is ignoring everyone for now.
They get inside the apartment, thank god for heating floors, and Dean opens his laptop, as Oli drinks some water and goes to lay in his bed. He needs to work on the bills before sending them to his accountant. He still has two hours to kill before he needs to leave so he watches some TV, plays some more with Oli, heats yesterdays leftover stew, eats it and leaves.
Dean swallows and it takes him almost an entire minute before he sits down awkwardly and wanting the earth to open and swallow him. He leaves the bag in front of his feet, but fists the strap in his hands tightly. Hannah doesn't comment just goes back to typing, the sound of the keyboard making Dean’s nerves raise and he tries to ignore it as much as he can. After a minute or two, realizing tapping his foot nervously is not the best way to pass the time, and that he is probably annoying Hannah, he gets his phone out and starts a crossword game.
Castiel nods and turns to Gabriel “Have fun” he says and begins to walk towards the cinema.
There are things though he can’t stop, like how he flinches if someone as much as raises his hand to touch him. Or the days where he doesn’t once make a sound.
“How are you?” The question throws him off and he frowns at her titling his head. She has that tone, the one she used after Mick died, it makes something cold run down his spine.
As they walk further into the house, he notices the open space, where on the left at the end, is the main door of the house and sees a stairway on the left, leading upstairs and swallows thickly. He follows Cas further on the hallway, and sees him turn right, in what Dean can see is the kitchen, but instead of following him he turns and looks around him. On the opposite side there is an opening and he can see a couch inside the room and nothing much from where he stands. He eyes dart around the hallway not that there is much to see  they are bare apart from two.
“So, Castiel was telling me they have a problem with the wedding cake,” Sam starts and Dean blinks. Right, the guy is getting married and if he remembers correctly (from what Sam has told him) to a woman.  He needs to get a grip and maybe stop eye fucking him, like he is sure he is doing now. He turns his eyes to Sam, “The baker canceled at the last minute.”
He looks back down on his screen. He thinks that he should at least find one class interesting, just one. The project he did with the other students didn't help at all, the other members were stressed but happy, excited even, about the degree, the university and Dean was just sitting there trying to think of a good thing to say about any subject. He came up empty. He likes marketing a bit, especially the psychology aspect of it, but in an ok-that's-good kind of why, not the light up face Sam gets when he talks about some of his subjects at school or law. Literature is ok, he guesses, he likes Steppenwolf that they finished last week, but it all feels… empty. Milton is nice, better than some of the other professors he has, but there something about her way of teaching that makes it a little dull or maybe it is just him.
“Can I help you?”
“Yours is already dead.”
“Could be better.” Castiel responds resting his back at the elevator wall.
“That I can’t do whatever I want and get away with because you are not donating to the school and I’m on scholarship.”
or whatever other crap they wrote along those lines. Still, Dean doesn't understand, he hasn't understood all through summer when he got their letter, which made him drop his favourite mug, not that it mattered that much at the time.
“Okay” Dean says and opens the blanket, over them.
“I don't know, Winchester. For the heck of it” Dean raises his eyebrows at her in question, both at the name and her words. “I like to remember peoples’ names around here” she responds grinning, eyes twinkling.
“Oh, yeah let’s talk about Deans’ shitty life” he says sarcastically. “What do you want to know? How I ended up doing this? Or why?”
“I’m sorry” He sighs a little, looking down at his plate. “It’s just no one… I still feel like… I don't know, I’m working on it. It is why I go to Crowley every week” He says the last part with a fake annoyance and Anna laughs a little.
“That's it?”
He gets the book out and leaves it next to his laptop, it takes a moment to realise that Milton is not in the lecture hall, which is strange, she is usually there already, Dean thinks she has another class before them. He frowns and looks at the clock. It is a minute past eleven. Perhaps something happened, she is allowed to be late once, Dean muses. When the clock shows past five, someone asks aloud if the class is cancelled but no one knows. Then the side door opens and a man with messy dark hair, holding a trench coat walks in and sets his laptop bag on the desk.
“Hi” Dean nods and doesn't know if a sound left his throat or he just formed the word with his lips.
“Ugh” he groans. This is a bad idea and Novak is an asshole for planting it in his head in the first place. Ok, that’s lie. He is an asshole for making the idea seem so possible, for putting Dean in this position where he needs to make a choice like that.
“What?”
He has never felt more alone, more abandoned, maybe the last time he did feel it so much was when he was hunting alone before he went to get Sam from Stanford.
“I guess is still the beginning, and I’m trying to find a rhythm”
“Dean, I don't understand what Kali has to do with anything”
Once the message is done he hangs up.
“We can see how it goes” Dean offers, pulling back “Doesn’t have to be any big commitment”
“I love a good love story.” She hands him the papers and he folds them and puts them in his pocket.
He doesn't go out with Benny, but alone. He feels weird all week, as if there is something on top of his skin that he cannot wash off. Other times he feels like everything slows down and he is waiting for something to happen, but he doesn't know what. He notes down his feelings on the notebook he has for Billie – yes, he has one of those now, on her insistence – but he is not sure he is going to talk about it with her this week. Some other time.
for some time now and a tremor goes through him. He wants to leave, but then he looks at Cas eyes, and can’t bring himself to move. So, he does the only thing he knows.
“I got custody of Sam five years ago, just before we moved here” he tells him, which doesn’t answer the question, but is all Dean can offer right now and Castiel appears to understand that.
Next week he walks in Novak’s’ class just before the lecture starts. He keeps his head down, in his notes and laptop screen. It’s their last week on Camus and they have to write the essay on Stranger and Dean dreads it, although he feels more confident than the other two times he had to write an essay in literature class. They received their tests at the beginning of the class and Novak told them if they had any questions to see him during his office hours.
“Maybe it’s something about their relationships.” Adam says shrugging.
Sam gives him a side glance and rolls his eyes, “You are never going to change, are you?”
After standing in front of the door a little awkwardly, he sits on a chair and places his hands on his knees. He sees some magazines on the table in front of him, but he doesn't think he is able to read anything right now.
“I’d rather be expelled than-”
He looks outside at the building and thinks about Anna and how stressed out she was this morning when he saw her. The lead she had on the Asmodeus case led to nowhere. He snorts when he thinks about the name, much as he did the first time, when she announced it to him a year ago. Anna can be really creative when she wants to, especially when it comes to naming cases. But when she is stressed and frustrated she is a force to reckon with, which is why everyone avoids her this past week.
He pushes himself a little deeper into the pillows and sighs softly at the man in front of him, who has been apologising to him for the last five minutes. Dean had tried to interrupt him, but he was determined to finish his long apology. Which Dean can understand, when he was nineteen, he had almost hit someone with Baby, but he was more nervous about what dad was going to say than anything else and he doesn't want to think what that means. So, he lets the man do his thing and just lays on the hospital bed and waits. Not that he can leave, he tried.
“Mum died and-”
He gets to his car and drives to his house in those twenty minutes that tonight seem like hours.
He looks up and finds Cas eyes, blue and kind and full of love and his eyes sting.
His heart stutters and stops.
“Cas?” he drags the name and gives him a devilish smile.
They cold air feels good against his skin, almost freeing. He leans against the wall, puts his hands no his knees, cursing under his breath. He collects his thoughts and starts walking towards the motel.
He nods. “The spells.”
He sits up abruptly, pushing the duvet away from him, rubbing at his eyes and then looks at Castiel expectantly. It’s cold and he wants to wrap himself in the covers again and lay down.
“I am coming for about two weeks in January, in between the semesters”
He thinks about Chuck's worlds.
“Yes”
“Did you tell Gabe?” he shakes his head negatively.
“What?” he asks defensively.
“Will you arrest me?” he asks and gives him a grin, that soon vanishes when he sees Cas expression. “Cas-”
“I’m offering” he says seriously, looking worried and dejected, like he has no right to be. “Besides you won’t be any good to, ugh, Sam, if you have an accident”
"The kid brought you back in 2020."
It’s Benny behind the counter again and Dean orders the same coffee as last time but doesn't get something to eat even though his stomach complains. Benny hands it to him and only then does he turn around and sure enough there is Cas, sitting at a table by the windows looking outside. He swallows and glances at the door, before looking at him again. He looks tired and
” and that “
“Somebody must have seen them.” Castiel laughs a little at that.
He nudges him with his foot, and Cas makes a sound. “I sometimes can’t breathe either” he tells him, and Cas gives him one of those small smiles, that Dean loves more than he can admit.
He removes his own boxers and Castiel rests his hand on his thigh right next to his cock and Dean can feel it throb and that’s unfair. He doesn't touch him, he just stares down at him; they stare at each other and before it gets to the point Dean can’t take it, because he feels naked and exposed in way that has nothing to do with having lost his clothes, and waiting in a way that is almost maddening with all that lust, Castiel gives him a kiss, soothing and comforting, in a you are not alone way.
Dean places the photograph down.
“Excuse me, we want those doors” the nurse says sternly and glares at him, but Cas isn’t paying any attention to her.
“Sorry, didn't mean to wake you” Dean says, feeling a bit bashful. “She scared me is all”
Miracle helps. She helps so much. Dean has moved her bowls in his room after the first week. She sleeps at the end of his bed and in the mornings she jumps on him and licks his face. She is so soft and sweet and Dean pours as much love as he can give to her.
(See the end of the chapter for
He places his arm on the bed and pushes down, trying to find leverage so he can get up but he can’t. His chest flutters and he bites down on the inside of his wrist to keep the sounds in, or not as loud as they start to become.
Sam's gone, probably to get breakfast. He yawns and closes his eyes. Hears the door unlock and close softly, familiar footsteps walk into the room. He hopes he got pancakes from the shop down the road, with a ton of syrup.
For some reason it irritates Dean, but he instantly thinks it’s absurd to be irritated by that, so he forces a smile, and steps out of the line to wait for his order. The other guy, Jesse, according to his nametag, hands him the muffin and the coffee after a minute or so.
“Perhaps. But he wasn't killed in this room.” He says with verdict. He moves around a little, seeing the room. It is a standard hotel room. It has a painting of a field at the opposite wall from bed. Castiel stares at it.
When he puts Auden down an hour later, he comes to the conclusion that he prefers him to Eliot, who he finds a bit dry. Not that Dean is an expert, in fact this is the only time he has read poetry outside the few times he had to for school. He does agree though, that they are both hard to understand and Dean feels like all that he understands are wrong anyways. Doesn't matter, is just for him, he reasons.
“Ok,” Dean says confused “What this has to do with me?”
“Nugh” he starts, then tries again “No going upstairs?” he asks cheekily, despite his dishevelled state.
It’s how he finds himself in bed with a guy named Matt on Monday. The sex is good, but after Dean feels hollow, like he did after some scenes in his early twenties, although then it was due to poor chooses, his self-destructiveness and a few other reasons. Yet, the hate for himself when he wakes up next morning is all too familiar, and he feels guilty like he cheated.
“You don’t owe me anything” Dean rushes out. This isn’t an obligation; Dean isn’t looking to be
“Don’t bullshit me kid”, Jo presses her lips together, her shoulders slumping. “Is that what you told her?” he continues nodding towards the back where Ellen is.
Castiel closes the door softly and swallows thickly, closing his eyes for just a moment, just enough so he won’t bang his fist against the wood. He turns to Claire who is staring at the door and he takes a steading breath to calm himself and hopefully stop the trembling of his hands
“No,” because that makes no sense at all.
“Well, you shouldn’t” Dean says, “We, ugh, we knew what” the rest die in his mouth, but Castiel looks at him in understanding and Dean wants to reach out and touch-
“The Darkness, she is the new god by the way, can’t do anything but your little spell-”
“No, goodbye” she flashes him a smile and goes back to typing in her computer.
“When I went with a black eye for my interview, they only asked whether I was well” Castiel says surprising them both. “I don’t really remember if they asked about the fight”
“We are not talking about it” he says and walks towards the door.
“Good” Dean says shrugging, and Sam gives him this concerned look that despite the fact that Dean knows is from a good place, irritates him, “I’m good.”
Dean doesn't like hanging around the main streets of the
And he turns around and leaves.
Eventually he picks himself up and takes a shower before crawling under the covers that smell like vanilla.
She stops typing on her laptop and sighs dramatically, “I hate grading. I just ugh”
“Well, maybe you can try… you know, to see someone” She says tentatively.
“Ok” he whispers. “Ok”
Dean had waited, he had waited from the moment Bobby told him that Cas was in heaven helping. He knew it would take time for him to help Jack, but perhaps he would find just a moment to come say hello. Just see Dean.
“If you ever need anything” Dean looks behind him surprised, the man just shrugs and goes back inside the shop without another word.
“I-” he starts unfocused. He is drowning, worse than when Michael was forcing him underwater. “I need to go.”
“The offer still stands for Sunday.”
There is Jack as well. Jack who stares at Dean in the eyes with admiration and love and Dean looks back at him the same way. What surprises him is the guilt he finds in both of them, not in him, Dean swims in guilt especially when it comes to the kid. Is the guilt Jack has and Dean tells him so one night in the kitchen, both of them eating cooking crunch cereal.
His phone rings making him jolt. He grabs it with his hand, cursing and squints at the screen, what the hell?
He removes the trench coat and blazer from Castiel’s shoulder, kissing his jaw, fingers working around the tie. He gets destructed several times, by Castiel’s hands mapping his body, but he gets it off as well and then he unbuttons the shirt and dives in kissing his neck more freely and as far down as he can, enjoying the small sounds Castiel lets out.
“If it happens, it happens” He says shrugging.
Dean has been waiting in the car for almost thirty minutes when he gives up and goes up the building to Sams’ office. They are suppose to be having lunch together, because Dean is now Eileen’s replacement, since she left for the conference and Sam has been moping all weekend and will probably continue to mop until tomorrow night, when she will return. Hence the late Monday lunch together. Not that Dean minds, it’s just that due to his work, Sam can’t have a strict schedule all the time, which is why Dean called before he left his apartment to make sure; everything was fine then but apparently something came up.
It takes them fifteen minutes to decide on what pizza to get and another forty for the it to arrive and by the time, Dean is back to being completely relaxed and enjoying himself without restrains. He has taken a second pill, cause he can feel his nose twist and he feels like all the other times he is around Cas, lightheaded, heart beating fast and ridiculously happy and warm. And maybe, just maybe he doesn't want to leave.
Dean licks his lips giving the tablet back to Sam, “They don’t think they deserve love. Not the victims, the wives and I’m guessing the husband.”
He doesn’t know how Cas meant it and that’s one of the worst parts. He has met angels who have fallen in love with humans, met one that was obsessed with one, but Cas…
“Hello, I’m Anna” she extends her arm and Dean shakes it a bit mechanically.
Sam raises his hand in mock surrender “Ok, whatever you say”, he clicks something on his laptop and after a beat asks “What we eating?”
“Cause, I am not used to someone sleeping next to me and and” he swallows with some difficulty “I didn't mind. I didn't mind that he was there, I thought I would, but I didn't and-” he closes his eyes tightly and reopens them staring at his hands.
“It’s fine” Novak responds without breaking eye contact with Dean.
“Sorry” and then realizes how stupid he is because “I already have her phone number” he lets a subconscious laugh and glances up and sees Sam giving him a look, that Dean dismisses. He needs to get a grip right the fuck now, because Sam doesn't need to know that his older brother gets flustered around hot guys, not that he is flustered but-
“Shush”
She nods and he introduces himself, “I’m agent Morison.”
Cas doesn't say anything, just shakes his head smiling and continues driving.
He crosses the street, which separates the library from the literature building and gets inside heading to the elevator. He has to wait for about half a second for it to reach the ground floor, something that makes him want to turn around and leave, but he stays put. He gets in, along with the other two people waiting with him and presses the button for the eleventh floor and waits.
Cas turns to him and smiles, “Really good, although, I don't want to do it again. All those people that wanted to talk to me after, more so than usual” he frowns.
Dean frowns at her, anger simmering in his stomach and something else, something he isn’t going to admit. “Whatever.” It’s meant to be dismissive, but from the looks they are giving him he knows he didn't succeed.
Which is why he blurts out unabashed, with half formed thoughts that finish once his mouth stops moving, “When did I fall in love with Cas?”
“Don't be. You have nothing to be sorry for”
“I am angry at you” he shouts now, and for a moment he feels good, but then he looks at Cas and sees an understanding, which throws him off a bit, and there is something else there, he isn’t sure what, but it makes him feel vulnerable and open and the anger flares up. “Shut up. Just shut up”
That is, until he lifts his eyes and finds Novak a few tables over reading a book. He swallows, his traitorous heart missing a beat. He doesn't mean to stare, there is just something magnetizing about looking at the man as he is absorbed in whatever he is reading his expressions changing subtly – you have to pay attention to notice -, as he reads along, sometimes mouthing words or his tongue darts out to wet at his lips. At one point he scowls on a page and Dean stifles a laugh. When he closes the book around his finger, not to lose the page and reaches for his mug, Dean averts his eyes to his keyboard and wills to whomever is listening not for Novak to notice him. It must fall to deaf ears – not surprise there – because he does feel eyes on him and after a second or two, he does raise his head and looks back at the man.
The words are etched on his skin for days.
“Just make sure you watch your diet. You need to eat. Full meals, vegetables and fruits as well. I understand that you may be… busy” Dean barely catches himself from rolling his eyes at her “and neglecting your diet, maybe skipping a meal or two, for months, but it can’t go on. Malnutrition is dangerous, ok? I will give you a meal plan before you leave, follow it”
There are lights and voices and then darkness.
and I needed to feel something different, I needed not to be in control, which ok yes, I know I have all the control, but I didn't know it then. There were so many things I didn't know. Not that I learned them with him. Not the right way, anyways”
“What?” he asks oblivious and titling his head.
When he returns, and he feels heavy and there is lump in his throat. He lays under the covers. After a minute or two, he feels the need to get up again and check. But tells himself he is being paranoid, there is no one there.  Eventually it passes and he just lays there breathing, hands still shaking, mind numb.
Sam doesn't know what Dean does and it’s for the best. All he is aware of is that he works at a garage down town and it’s all he is ever going to know if Dean can help it. He doesn't need him worrying, or
“It smells like shit”
“It’s not for everyone. But, you like it” he says seriously, with that tone he uses when he wants to get something through to other people.
It’s why she is the hardest person to face.
“Come on” he tells Oli and nudges him, “go”
“I hope you have good reason for calling me at this hour” he grunts
He knows the reason behind it, he is standing inside the heart of it. He is sitting in the waiting room outside of the program administrator office, uncomfortable plastic chair and all, for his turn. He plays with the corner of the papers he is holding and sighs for the hundredth time since he sat down, he thinks of rereading all the information he is holding but it’s pointless, he already read it at least ten times. As a student who graduated high school six years ago, with not impressive grades, he has to take some extra credit classes, to help him
“Hey,” Sam says with a tentative smile, his brows furrowing slightly glancing at Cas and back at Dean.
.” All three of us, he doesn't say. “He would disappear for days, then weeks. Sometimes we would go to a motel, he would pay for some days, give me money in case he wasn't back by then and take off.” He swallows and takes a sip of the now lukewarm coffee.
Then more bitterly, “You always have.”
“Is that how we are going to be?” he asks, his mouth down turned and looking at Dean with desperation that has the older man soften and shake his head. “Because, because I don’t want that. I want us to be better and I forgive you and I know you forgive me too. So?”
says. “I will get the papers ready. It was good to see you Castiel” She is a terrible liar.
“What time is it?” he mumbles, stretching subtly under the sheets; eyes closing again.
“Excuse me, sweetheart” he sends her an apologetic smile and she just shakes her head laughing softly, giving him a one shoulder shrug. He turns and finds Jo staring at him eyebrows raised, hands on her hips, her hair no longer on a neat ponytail but framing her face and he knows the moment Ellen sees her she is going to have a word with her about it.
He doesn’t.
He chuckles humorlessly. “You’ve got nerves, I’ll give you that.”
“I know you don’t want to talk about it, but at least try. The not eating, the drinking-” he stops sighing, “It’s not what he would have wanted.”
“I wasn't all the way asleep. She climbed on top of you?”
Castiel knows that Caesar is a bigger workaholic than he is and that Jesse had been trying to convince him to go somewhere for months. Although he is a bit surprised that Anna let him take a leave now with the case they have been working on. Although, knowing both of them, Anna probably was glad he went on vacation. He remembers her being worried about him spending so much time in the office.
Raises his hand and Dean doesn't flinch, but his face much do something, because Cas looks at him with eyes full of grief and takes his face in his palm, moving his thumb across his cheekbone and Dean realizes he has been crying.
“You were featured in ABA. Three times” Dean says and nods towards the bookcase, where the magazines are. Cas huffs and shifts.
“Who are you?” the nurse asks louder this time, as if they hadn’t heard hear her before, frowning at them.
“I know.” Sam says and takes a seat across from him. “We’ll get him back.”
“Dean,” he starts “I don’t want to make-”
“You always had an
“Dean” and he knows that tone and what will follow “you haven’t fixed the heater”
He laughs softly at that and she offers him a big smile. “So, you going to tell me what’s that?” he looks at the envelope and Anna’s smile vanishes and her expression hardening.
He looks up at dark blue and his eyes water. He blinks, trying to get a hold of himself.
“If I had to guess,” he starts and suddenly Dean wants him to shut up, “Sometime before he started working with Crowley.” Then he adds after a second, “Not completely, just the beginning of something.”
Dean nods at him, getting out of his stupor. Then he remembers “Sam doesn't know”
“I didn’t do anything” when Dean opens his mouth ready to retort, ha relents “Ok. You are welcome. It was the least I could do”
“It’s ok. Family is…” he looks at the ceiling, feeling uncomfortable. “A touchy subject”
, is already up there.
“I will be outside”
“Why are you doing this?”
Dean grins at him and Bobby rolls his eyes.
He just shakes his head, bids her goodbye and ignores her and the look that passes her face. Not that she knows anything.
“No. Only the bratty ones”
He makes another coffee and drinks it, and turns on Netflix and watches a movie. He falls asleep half way through. He remembers to text Benny and tell him he won’t come in today, and then sees he has two missed calls from a number he doesn't recognize and almost has a heart attack. He wouldn't call, he reasons. He can’t get your phone number, that he doesn't quite believe, but he is certain that it’s not him.
century literature class, as he collects a stack of paper that he puts in a drawer to be forgotten.
It is outside of town. Next to a lake smaller than the other ones, but still big enough. That at times fish appear, but mostly it’s empty.
“Dean-”
“Please go to Charlie and ask her to run it for prints or anything really and check the cameras in the building” Inias gets up, muttering something under his breath and looks at Castiel frustrated. Castiel nods at him in understanding, there is nothing more he can offer right now.
“If you could please let some people downtown know about the clinic. I know, I know not everybody would appreciate it but, we are trying to reach people and it’s not really that effective. But someone who is not a
“Shut up they love me”
When he gets into Castiel’s car, settling on the passenger seat, he scrunches his face, his stomach turning at the heavy lavender smell. He casts a glare at the flower shaped car scent that is dangling from the mirror, as Castiel pulls out of the university grounds and into the main street.
, he thinks,
Dean offers him a small smile and sits up sitting in front of Cas, who runs a hand down his arm and takes Deans’ hand in his.
She is expecting him to start asking questions, but Dean’s mind has forgotten how to do this since he saw her and he all he wants is to ask Sam if this is what he looks like, small and defeated and like he is aching everywhere, exactly how he feels.
He hears footsteps approaching and opens his eyes, looking as Castiel walks towards him.
Eventually, he reaches and takes it into his hands turning it over, it just has his name printed on the front side, and that alone makes his stomach turn. He swallows and runs a finger across the letters.
After a while though, he stops trying and just takes him into his mouth and moans, rather loudly, but god he’d been wanting to do that since last week, feel the throbbing heat stretch his mouth.
“He is in the system” She says as if reading his mind. He gets up and follows her out of the room. The image of the man, is on the screen.
Anna frowns slightly, but after a second her expression clears and she smiles, “Winchester? Sam, has mentioned you. You must be Dean” she says sounding somewhat excited. For what Dean doesn't know and he really wants to know what Sam has been saying about him.
Castiel presses his palms over his closed eyes and sighs. He can feel exhaustion fill his body and wills himself to get up. He opens his bag and puts his laptop inside, trying to forget about the rest of the essays he has to grade and turns off the lamp on the desk. He makes a mental note to remember to tell Meg to send the email about the talk on Kafka to the students in his 20
There is a huff.
“You too. I’ll see you tomorrow”. He says turning around, going to the elevator. When inside he lets out sigh, feeling the muscles on his back ache. He had stayed up for the last two days trying to locate Gordon Walker, who had kidnapped and killed a girl.
Sam seeming to get his distress, pushes his shaking hand away and clicks the button but nothing happens. He presses again harder frowning, glancing warily at Dean, but In The Light continues to play and Dean swallows soundly. His throat dry, his chest contrasts with every breath he takes and there are goose bumps all over his body.
Apparently the answer is Michael flying over the town trying to pin point where the curse is stronger, hence where the next victim will be. Only problem is he picks it up in five different places.
“I don’t care.” She rolls her eyes at him and he ignores her, skimming through the list of ingredients of both spells. Pretty basic, they have almost everything in the Bunker.
“The car, its…” he can’t say it.
“Cas” he breaths, forgetting for a moment, then “Cas. We need, need” he is silenced by another kiss.
Dean sets a plate in front of him and then sits opposite of him passing him a fork. They eat and make idle small talk. Castiel learns that Dean lives with his brother Sam, who is studying law and that he is a mechanic and a bartender on the weekends.
He starts praying too and when he realizes, he stops. Stands up, dusts off and heads back to the bunker.
“I ne-” his throat closes and he tries again “I need to go. Be somewhere.”
“Good. I ugh, I bought the bar”
He is just standing there at the foot of the bed, looking at him with a soft expression like he never left.
“I’ve read thousands of essays, I think I’d know” his tone doesn't leave room for arguing and Dean finds himself deflating and wanting to explain himself. He half wants to say
Things have been slow for a while. There has been a murder in the last fifteen days, which gave Castiel time to think and processes the case from different angles. He went over everything, trying to catalogue every detail, but it’s like he is making a puzzle with half the pieces. He doesn't have enough clues and so he has to wait, which means more people have to die. It keeps him up at night and Crowley comments on that making him do breathing exercises before he sleeps, but he just can’t get himself to relax.
God, he so angry with himself. The reason he does this job is to catch these people and all his has is a big nothing and this letter, these words.
He goes to the kitchen and sees Dean sitting on a chair drumming his finger idly on the table. He knows Dean hasn't eaten anything all day, it’s how he gets when something is bothering him or he is sad. Like that Tuesday when they learned that radiotherapy was in fact useless.
He nods, not having enough energy to talk and walks inside. He sees Inias’ report and contemplates staying to read through it, but decides against it, it would take him twice the time and he could do it in the morning. Instead, he takes his trench coat from the coat stand and puts it on, taking his car keys, from atop of the desk and walks back out.
When Carmen is satisfied, and that takes a while, she moves from on top of him and he feels her get settled somewhere between their feet. Cas is already snoring softly beside him and Dean closes his eyes and before long he is asleep too.
“’night, Cas” and it should be weird, but it isn’t and when Cas replies gruffly “Good night, Dean” something settles inside Dean making him sigh in content.
“The guilt about not feeling guilty”
His heart jumps a little in his chest, he has never seen Dean like this before, well not that he has seen much of him outside his apartment. Nevertheless, Dean is always composed, or at least, Castiel has found this past few months, he wears a mask that gives people the impression that everything is fine and under control. So, seeing him in a chair with dry tears in his face and eyes so sad that make Castiels’ throat close up, makes him feel helpless and protective and he really doesn't want to dwell on that.
Novak nods and walks back in his office and Dean stares at the half-closed door, unsure.
Gets into baby and drives the three blocks to the motel in furry. When he gets in his room his hands shake from the anger. There is so much anger in him, white hot and alive, more alive than he has been in a long time. It presses at the front of his head, behind his eyes, it makes his nose burn. Fights to get out.
“What?” he asks, going for nonchalant but it comes off slightly too defensive.
“It’s about me forgiving myself.” Dean says with a small smile that is just in his eyes and Jack nods.
“But never did?” Dean asks scoffing.
After five minutes of silence and Dean constantly fidgeting and huffing, which is absolutely understandable if you ask him, Cas sighs a bit tiredly.
He looks at the coffee shop in the corner, and before he has a second thought, he throws his half-finished coffee on the bin and walks inside. It is Thursday, the day after he has that regular guy that pays pretty well, so he can indulge a little, even though Sams’ books seem to get more expensive as time passes.
“I miss working with you as well” he says sincerely. He misses Anna, she has a way with working cases that nobody else has.
Thankfully the door opens yet again and Dean never felt as relived to see the doctor walk in. He glances at her and then turns his gaze towards the window.
He closes his eyes momentarily and wets his lips. He slowly turns to his right, as if scared to look, clenching the sheets with his hands. And sure enough, he is greeted with a freckled back and light brown hair.
“You are supposed to follow him” Hannah tells his and nods towards the door.
A few people chuckle, others are just too stunt to do anything else other than stare, Dean is one of those, but for entirely different reasons.
, where he makes that sound. He draws back and blinks. Cas grabs him from the back of his neck and kisses him again, and maybe he is not the only one that likes their kissing.
“He adores you,” Jo finishes and she looks regretful now, making Dean feel guilty in return.
“Ok.” Dean doesn't think he will use it, but if it makes Castiel feel better. “I will be…” he gestures towards the door awkwardly.
“Are we done?” He asks trying, and probably failing, to not look exasperated. “Everything is in the report, that we have gone over about fifty times now”
anything special, the most impressive thing he’d done was take custody of Sam, really that's all he did (even if it was just the shitty attorney that did all the job and really Dean was impressed – he cried for like five minutes in the courts’ toilets – when they won that one) and if he has to work double shifts and sometimes hold two jobs, so what? Sam was the one that did the hard work, kid studied so much sometimes he forgot to eat or sleep properly. Dean was just there to cook, remind him to sleep and provide the money. It wasn't that impressive; he had done that for almost two decades. And he wasn't particularly pleased when Talbot, had said during the interview that “
“Yes, and you know he did” Sam says voice rising.
“I am fine” he repeats emphasizing it.
“You married her, Kali, and now-”
“Yes one of the three,” says Sam setting his coat and placing in the coat hook under the bar.
He makes a sandwich, just ham and cheese and eats it along with the coffee and when he is done, he brews another one, but uses a thermos instead of a mug. He makes his way back to the bedroom and changes into a pair of jeans, an undershirt and a long-sleeved shirt and grabs a pair of socks form the drawer on his way out.
It’s not far, hardly a three minute walk, but it feels like eons to Dean. It’s stiff and awkward, as if they are stuck in the kitchen again and he feels the need to scratch his skin out.
happened.
On Friday, he walks into literature class and immediately finds Novak’s eyes. For a moment he thinks the other man knows what he did on Tuesday and shame curls in his stomach along with panic. Then he realizes how ridiculous he is being and walks towards his seat with far more confidence than he actually feels; they only break eye contact when Dean finally sits down and starts getting his things out of his back, and thinks his heart will either burst or give out, and Novak turns his eyes to his laptop screen, typing something.
The bartender keeps glancing back at her in awe, as some others who have noticed her do as well. Dean glances at her to but his eyes are hard and his mouth stiff.
He parks the car in the garage and gets in the house, using the door that joins the garage with the rest of the house. He has yet to get used to living there and sometimes he misses his apartment, not that he considered it any more of a home than he does this one, but it was small and he didn't feel as lonely as he does in this one. He goes to the kitchen and drinks a glass of water, and then another half and heads upstairs to his bedroom.
“Dude, you got to stop doing that”
Castiel stares at him for a few seconds. “I should probably go to the bar. They are still there”
“No” he says and his voice sounds strange in his ears.
“I knew you’d like the kitchen” he says with a smirk, rolling his shoulders. He is nervous too, Dean realises and somehow that makes him relax and not feel totally helpless. He is not alone in this.
He finds it fourteen years later in a folder, searching for a book on angels. Bobby looks at him for a long moment before going back to reading.
Dean knows Sam isn’t stupid.
Dean rolls his eyes again and he knows he ought to act more respectfully, but he can’t bring himself to it. There is a part of him that wants to see how long it takes until the always composed man crumbles.
After twenty minutes of three different radio stations, a disagreement on Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller and Dean not managing to sit still for more than five seconds, they finally reach the restaurant. And Dean has to admits it’s nice. It’s homey and not overly busy, which he enjoys. He hates overcrowded restaurants.
Dean rolls his eyes and says simply, hating himself for the sting it causes him, “You married Kali.”
The door opens and Novak comes in, muttering something under his breath while walking at the desk and getting his laptop out, removing his trench coat and Dean tries not to stare too much. Especially when he runs his hand through his hair, that are a bit wet form the rain, sighing. He watches though as the man glances at the students in the front every few seconds, before going back to his laptop and frowning the power point. When they don't stop, he looks at them concerned and walks near the first row, control in his hand.
The next evening before dinner, he writes the word down on a piece of paper, looks at the letters, crumbles it and throws it on the bin.
“They have nice muffins and coffee” he raises his cup for emphases.
“Come on, Castiel. I don't mean any harm” And Castiel really hates him right now. He turns and goes to the door, opening it and pausing slightly to say “Goodbye, Arthur”, before he slams it shut. He breaths through his nose to calm himself, and heads to the elevator. He hates the conference rooms they have. They make him nervous.
It's the end of September and even though it’s not that chilly outside Castiel feels the need to wrap the trench coat around him, but he resists the urge and walks towards his car. He doesn't know if Dean drove here, but he hopes he didn't, not in this state. He unlocks the car and sees Dean walk around to the passenger side and slip in. Ok, so he didn't drive, he feels somewhat relieved about that and he closes his eyes tightly for a moment, as if to collect his thoughts and emotions.
“I know this is not how you want to spend the day Castiel, but I want it to be perfect” Arthur says flashing him one of those smiles. I’m-an-asshole-I-know-better-than-anyone-smiles, as Hannah calls them.
. Dean knows that the case is weighing down on him. He sighs, moving his weight between his legs before deciding to walk towards him, not that he has much of a choice if he is honest. And he isn’t. He ignores the flatter he gets in his stomach, chest, everywhere and sits down.
Dean looks away.
“What happened the other times?” Billie asks and Dean breaths heavily. “Dean?”
“Hey ya Cas” Dean says grinning, rolling his shoulders slightly and taking a sip from his coffee. God, he loves this coffee.
“What?” asks Cas incredulously.
Dean can feel himself blush and shifts in the bed, he
Today is one of those days. He rolls in bed so he is on the other side, which is cold, and breaths in. He is having dinner, a mini party knowing mom, at their house in the evening and he is already dreading it.
“It’s ok,” she tells him voice soft, his eyes meet hers and he gives a slight nod. “I get it. I have lost family too.”
“Yeah, what did you think Dean?”
There is a tense silence after she leaves and even though he is breathing Dean feels like he is holding his breath, maybe it's the way Cas is looking at him.
“Mhm” Crowley wrights something down again. “I have to say I am proud of you”
“First. A Sort of Introduction” He responds, relaxing slightly and looking a little relieved. Like he was scared Castiel would judge him for his choice of book.
He is wearing his green blue checked pajama pants and a simple black shirt, hair everywhere as usual, but he looks worried. He looks at Dean worriedly.
“Yes” he lets out, after a few seconds of him trying to collect his thoughts, it’s croaky and barely holds back a wince.
“Jesus” Jo says, “You are talkative”
“Yeah, maybe she has gone crazy.” Dean directs to Michael sardonically. “That’s why she has warded herself so well.”
“How are you?” She asks and Castiel returns her smile, some of his irritation from before leaving him.
“Why did you fight?” Sam asks Castiel.
“There is the Christmas festival.” Adam suggests taking a huge bite from his pizza. Dean doesn’t know where he finds the appetite.
“Shh, it’s ok, sweetheart” something gets stuck in Deans throat at the endearment and his eyes water yet again from complete different reasons. Castiel, lays him down on his back and Dean grips his arm.
nothing bad. He sighs. This is just peachy.
Dean doesn’t know what makes him do it, it might be the silence or the soft look on Castiel’s face that makes his stomach flip and his chest ache or, that he is just a small petulant man, but he blurs
“I’m Dean” he introduces after glancing at Castiel to check that it’s ok.
Right. The baker. Long brown hair.
“I’ll just get my stuff then”
“Dean, fuck” Castiel groans, hips stuttering, coming and a second later Dean follows him.
“Enough Sam” he practically seethes out and he feels something pound in his chest, but at least now he can breathe a little better. But there is still something buzzing in his ears. God, he wants to hang up and forget the last five minutes.
She had given him a look full of understanding, sympathy and something that was awfully like pity. Sam and mom would give him the same look sometimes when they think he is not looking.
“Ok, then” Dean responds and has to fight a grin.
“Don’t be”
“Well, you invited me-” he doesn't finish, his words getting swollen by Novak, who takes Dean’s face in his hand and it’s big and warm and when his tongue finds its way into Dean’s mouth and their tongues touch, it’s familiar in a way it isn’t ought to be and exciting and so
“She was a really bad date, set up by my brother” he says at last with exasperation and Dean knows him well enough to know there is more to this story, than just a bad date.
And he wants, god he wants-
“Dean”
"2154, earth year"
He looks back up at his face and finds a guarded expression there that confuses him, “Hey, Cas.”
Sam huffs again and Dean closes his eyes.
“If you saw a child, a nine, an eleven-year-old, steal food for the same reasons, would you think he was any less of a person or a bad person”
Dean fights not to roll his eyes and just continues to smile at her, fake and big and she just nods indifferent and moves on to the other form. She presses her lips together and turns to her computer screen typing something and then reading through.
Dean presses his lips. “Yeah, well it’s passable”
“No” Hannah responds and walks to stand next to him. “No form of identification on him” she sighs softly and continues. “The room wasn't booked. It was going to be occupied today, the cleaning staff found him. Also, nobody saw him going up.”
“Ok-” and he presses his lips together and looks to the side, like he is afraid that Dean will laugh with what he is about to say. Then looks back at him with a determined face and say “I don't like fries.” And alright that wasn't what Dean expected.
he is circling Deans hole, before pushing just a bit and oh hell
“Don't act like you don't like it.” He raises his eyebrows at that. “I know it wasn't easy in the beginning, and you hated both Gabriel and me, but now I know you actually like going there now and it has helped.”
He feels heavy, has been feeling this way since yesterday. It was a particularly long night, then again, most nights seem long these days and Dean has a strange, he wouldn't necessarily call it bad, feeling in his chest.
“You came here with Inias?” He asks her as they head towards the doors.
and how
is complicated.
“Asshole” he breathes once he is sure he can produce words. Cas just smiles and leans down and kisses him and Dean groans against his mouth and it feels good, so good.
you” and he can practically see the puppy eyes, making something inside him stir.
“You have nothing to lose.”
“It wasn't a crush” she exclaims, “Just... I admire her work”
His hand curls into a fist and his jaw clenches. He
“Ok, Castiel” She answers with a slight shake of her head and a tone that indicates that she would in fact stay.
His legs are numb, his hands twist on his sides and he grips the comforter.
Dean blinks, willing his brain to work, “The test” then clearer “It’s about the test”
“It’s good to have you back.” He says over whatever Cas was going to say, because he can’t hear it now.
“Castiel” she says, the names rolling weirdly in her mouth.
“I know” she replies simply and leans her head against his shoulder. “You should come this Sunday for dinner, Gadreel is cooking” she says in a lighter tone. “Gabe will come”
Jack watches Dean unblinking for a moment too long that has Dean look away.
“No, I know that, but it doesn't hurt to check” It’s gives them something to do and not sit around helpless.
It’s not one of the phone numbers they had given him or Dean would have saved it in his phone. So it was probably one he got on his own.
When Toms’ breathing is back to normal, Dean gets up and goes to the bathroom, closing the door behind him. He showers a second time today, but now the water is hot and Dean sighs under it, his muscles relaxing. He is fast but not too fast, he doesn't like staying for longer than he has to, besides they didn't agree for a second time tonight. He rests his head on the tiles breathing deeply for a moment before turning the water off.
“I was supposed to rebuild you,” Michael says after a moment, like this is perfectly acceptable conversation to have over waffles, at nine in the morning is a small town in Pennsylvania, hunting freaking Aphrodite.
“Thank you, for informing me, however there is no need. And thank you for not talking to him” he deadpans.
“Ok” he says picking up his bag. “Is there anything else?”
He pulls away, Dean immediate misses the warmth, “Come one” he tells him, moving to climb the stairs and Dean follows him.
“Right” he says tightly, around a hurricane of emotions, it’s too early for this, it will always be too early for this.
“It’s a turtleneck sweater,” Benny corrects, “Since when do you wear turtleneck sweaters?”
“Ok. Dean. Well his office is on the third floor, homicides. You’ll find it. Elevator is over there” She responds smiling at him. She still seems suspicious but Dean couldn't care less right now.
He is not fond of Matisse’s style but that painting always makes him feel something in the centre of his chest, that is both familiar and not, and something wells in his eyes and for a moment he is oddly reminded of his mum. A distant, frayed memory of a morning in a kitchen he hasn't seen since he was four.
She asks him why he is here and he responds that he felt like it and that he has been thinking about it since March. Next she asks him what he wants to achieve with this. It takes him an eternity to answer, his mind blank and feels far away. In the end all he gets out is “I don't know”. She again doesn't seem to mind.
“Yes, do you want me to stay?”
He frowns at him but pulls a chair and sits opposite of him. He shifts slightly until he sits comfortably in his chair. A silence falls between them, it is a little awkward, and Castiel searches for something to say. Anything. But he finds nothing. God, he sucks at this. Then Dean finally aks, trying to sound conversational.
“How have you been?”
“Mhm” Crowley says and Castiel knows this is him encouraging him to continue.
“Why didn’t you choose Harvard?” he asks him curiously, after a moment.
it. And do what I told you and the exercises”
“Hey buddy” he says voice scratchy, running hand on the top of Olis’ head, “Eileen is going to walk you, ok? Be good for her” he says watery. Oli moves a bit on top of him and Dean chuckles despite himself. He hears the front door open then close, and and a “Dean”.
Dean freezes momentarily, stomach tightening with guilt and nerves, “Sorry, I know, it’s just a lot you know? I’m trying to settle”
“I am sorry to inform you” and she doesn't sound sorry at all “but the Egyptian to Byzantine art class is full, so you have to take either biology, mythology or twentieth century literature”
Perhaps Sam doesn’t know the same for Dean.
“I was just going” Dean says distractedly, getting ready to leave.
Right.
Castiel nods already walking towards the door.
Something moves in Dean’s stomach, and he scolds at himself, what did he expect anyways, an apartment like his? Novak is a sensible guy, he would live in sensible house.
He arrives at the apartment almost twenty minutes later, leaving his shoes and bag at the small hall, next to Sams’ jacket on the floor and really he should have learnt to put it on the hangers by know. He goes to the kitchen and drinks a glass of water and he notes to himself to take a bottle with him when he goes to university from now on. He moves to the bathroom to take a piss, stripping of his clothes, and washes his hands, before going to his room to put on sweatpants and an almost completely faded Motorhead t-shirt. He goes back to the kitchen and makes a sandwich, eating it to the way to the living room. He takes his laptop and settles on the couch, opening it up and after some debate he finally brings himself to google psychotherapists near me.
Dean is annoyed and nervous and embarrassed and he has rolled his eyes so many times he is sure he is going to develop an eye problem.
Dean chuckles and Cas fake frowns at him, before shooting him a small, a bit pained smile.
He feels Castiel stopping himself from bulking his hips and he moves, sucking just the tip and teasing the slit with his tongue. He hears Castiel groan and he can’t help the smirk forming. He leaves open mouth kisses all the way down his length, until he reaches his balls and takes one into his mouth. His hand coming up to work his cock leisurely, making Castiel arch and moan, one hand moves to grip Dean’s hair tightly and it’s his turn to moan. He tries to drag it as much as possible but he only has enough self-control.
“Dean”
Castiel blinks a couple of times and feels like he is in a trance, he registers Anna looking behind her. “What?” she asks looking back at him.
Dean finds his eyes, all blue and pained. "You can feel longing," he pushes, "and I know you can tell apart what each longing means"
“I’m looking for Detective Novak.”
He takes a deep breath and a sip from his coffee, for a minute he doesn't know how to answer her question, his thoughts are a little fuzzy. He tries to get them in order and when he starts to speak he looks down at his cup.
. He swallows thickly at that and shifts a bit in his seat. There is an itch in his hands, his skin, that he can’t quite place and it’s bothering him. He feels confused and vulnerable and he wants- he swallows and tries to focus on Bob Dylan.
He is numb, dragging himself to his room, his muscles ache and he wants to scream but something has deserted him. He wants to be angry but he doesn’t have the strength to feel anything. He removes his clothes hastily as if they are burning him and he gets into his bed and cries.
“They are not” he protests, as they move to the living room and settle on the couch and Oli on his pillow.
Cas’ knows or at least knows that something bad happened, or that Dean wasn't very careful on who he let to do stuff with when he was younger. He knows that something was done to him in that context. It is still fresh on his mind the first time Cas tied him, not for that, but because Cas had to go to the living room as he forgot the lube there and Dean freaked. As in, started shaking and wouldn't calm down for an hour kind of freaked.
“I love you too, very
“What’s not true?” this time it is too innocent.
“Permanency, or the absence of it” he says and looks up at Dean. “and loneliness” this conversation is getting heavier than Dean expected. “I mean, I like living alone. It’s just sometimes, I get this feeling, like I will
“Would you like to have lunch?” Castiel suppresses the urge to roll his eyes.
His face must do something because Michael frowns at him straightening in his seat and Sam looks around worriedly. His whole body locks up and Dean has to blink away the blurriness in his eyes.
“What?” he spits, looking at her incredulously, squeezing the lemon he is holding into the mixer.
Novak nods at him, “Yes, Camus wants to show that society is threatened when things happen for no reason at all and there is no meanings in events.” He finally looks away from Dean and continues going over the themes, and Dean releases a breath he didn't know he had been holding.
Novak turn his head to look at him over his shoulder, saying “Shut up” and then he fucking
When they reach the bunker the dog is there, sleeping on top of Dean’s bed. He doesn’t know why that surprises him as much as it does. He doesn’t know why a tear escapes him when he sees her.
“Yeah?”
“He was just worried and he sometimes tutors me, so he is not a complete stranger” he says, lie rolling off his tongue smoothly.
He crosses his arms self-consciously and sits on a chair.
He bites his tongue just enough to hold himself, so what he is thinking wont come out of his mouth and he turns around slowly.
God, he is tired and last night didn’t help and he really needs to stop thinking about that. He sits up on the couch and his eyes fall on the TV playing a movie, he rolls his eyes, of course The Shinning, trust Sam to pick a movie. Not that Dean doesn’t like it, but he needs something lighter today.
Novak presses his lips together, seems to mull it over, “Yes, but it has to do with other skills as well. People don't excel in their jobs just because they have a degree or several. In fact, there are people that are great in their professions, without going to university”
Dean bites his tongue just hard enough so he doesn’t roll his eyes and says, “What is it Sam?”
“Would you like to have pizza?” Castiel blurts and Dean turns so fast to look at him, he loses his balance slightly.
“You already thanked me” Castiel tells him. Dean can feel his skin prickling under his gaze.
He hears Sam chuckle, and smiles faintly despite himself.
“Slow night?”
“Good”
“Ok, ok whatever you want”
“I am fine” He says a little too fast. His eyes dart around the room. It hasn't changed much in the two years he has been coming here. The decoration is the same, the bookcase is the same, the furniture, the way Crowley sits in his chair. Yet, it feels different.
So, he nods once and Castiel nods back at him, collects his stuff and together they walk to the parking lot.
On Friday, Sam is making him go to lunch with him and he promises that this time nothing unexpected is going to happen. Dean knows that Sam just wants to know how everything went with Balthazar this morning and he really can’t blame him.
He sighs and rubs a hand across his face. “Alright”
They reach the Bunker a day later and Sam has Dean eat a burger before forcing him to sleep. And ok yes, Dean does need it but the spell comes first.
“Dean” he says in that way of his and something unravels inside him like always when Cas says his name like that, and like always he has no idea what it is.
His hand twists in his side, he knows he shouldn't. He has hundreds of reasons as to why, but then he listens as Dean moves around in the apartment and closes his eyes tightly. Maybe just this once, its not like Dean
“Yeah, I got that. But I think your friend wanted a little bit more explanation. Or your friends” He observes the people going inside the auditorium
“What? I didn't go to college so I can’t talk?”
“But I liked the pain. Still do, how fucked up is that?”
Dean presses his lips together and after a moment says, “Cas got it for me. And if you must know I like it.” It’s true, when he had saw it first, he thought it was a joke. Dean rarely wore sweaters, he preferred layering, and definitely not turtlenecks, but the thing was warm which earned it like six points. Plus, he looked good.
“A really
“He is here now” she says apologetically.
Dean makes a face, “It’s one o’clock”
“Did they?”
“No.” Dean says, “But, you can get expelled, and then what Sam? Hm?”
“Every Friday afternoon” he continues, pushing through the pressure on his chest “I was never going to the library or study group. Just therapy, with Billie. That’s her name”. His palms are sweaty so, he wipes them on his sweatpants, worrying his lip between his teeth.
Dean shifts in his sit, looking uncomfortable. He looks at the side and huffs a laugh.
He doesn't do well with people, he is only really good with them on the interrogation room. It is also where he feels most confident when talking with others. Otherwise he is rather blunt and social setting trouble him, especially with people he doesn't know. And the fact that the DA is Arthur Ketch, doesn't help matters either. Not that if it was anyone else he would feel better, to be honest. After the events of three years ago, he would hate anyone who took the position of DA.
The stay like that for a while, just staring at each other. Then Castiel begins to walk towards the exit and after a beat he hears Dean get up and follow him out the building.
Deans’ head shots up and grins. “For a Friday. What are you doing here?”
“What about it?” Novak asks looking confused and glancing at the photograph.
“Goodbye, dad”
Dean frowns at him “Cas-”
“We both want the best for you and I am his friend, it’s natural for him to talk to me about what’s troubling him”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” he grits gripping the counter with one hand.
“Sam- What even? How?”
love. Human way. They way Dean wants it to be because he is selfish like that.
Castiel says softly. “He didn't seem to want to converse” and after a pause “with anyone”
They are talking about Jo and even though Castiel has never met her and only knows her by what Dean has told him, he feels a few tears in his eyes.
Sam has taken into cataloguing the Bunker’s items creating a full archive, since they have both silently agreed to take a break from hunting for at least a couple of weeks. For the first few days he just drops hints at Dean to help him and Jack and finally come out of his room. He seems to be under the impression that it will help Dean, but the older man refuses every time.
“What?” he breaths, before he says something stupid, like
He looks at Cas, who looks back at him, surprised and with a little sadness. “Ok yes. But there are bigger problems out there and besides, I was so busy after the first two grades of school that I didn't have time to, to look out windows” he says in a rush and crosses his arms in the end.
“So” Dean starts fed up, not really knowing how to finish and looks at the other man to fill the empty space. He is really out of his depth here. It is so stiff and forced and he wants to high tail it out of there as fast as possible. Instead he grips the cup tighter and clenches his jaw until it hurts.
“You shouldn’t say things lightly.” Then after a small pause. “Or make deals that are going to hurt the people you claim to love.”
Dean feels like he should be angry at that, but with the way Cas is looking at him with so much worry and care, he can’t bring himself to say anything. It’s too much and it has been too long. He swallows.
He takes a shuddering breath trying to clear the fog in his brain and says “Naked.”
Finally, they avert their eyes and go back to their respective books and only glance at each other from time to time. And Dean doesn't ignore that giddy feeling going through him at that, no matter how silly it is.
“Yes and no” he answers sobering up “When should I do another check up?”
He is just starting the third episode of the Alienist, - after booking an appointment with Billie Thani - when he hears the door of the apartment open and after a few seconds he sees Sam walk past him saying a muttered “Hi”, before going to his room.
Dean’s mind goes blank for just a second and tries to think about that day. And then suddenly it comes back to him all at once, like a bucket of ice in his face and he shifts in his seat. He feels the cold, heaviness of a gun in his hands, that just last week he learnt how to use, without the help of dad. He thinks of Sam, who was eight months old and was so small and oblivious, and all seven years old him could think was that when mum picked him up he seemed so light, but actually was quite heavy. That after a while that heaviness became grounding, comforting. It meant that at least one of them ate well.
Dean reaches for his wallet and gives him a five-dollar bill and takes the receipt and change from Benny. He goes and waits in the corner, like he saw the other people do. He sees a bald guy with a beard, coming around the corner with a tray, and as he heads towards the coffee machine, he says something to Benny and they both laugh.
He reaches and starts unbuttoning Castiel’s shirt all the way through, and sees as his hands tremble slightly, and he knows it’s not because of nerves. Next, he reaches for his slacks, unbuttoning, but stops when Castiel kisses his cheek, then his forehead then he moves down, giving a chaste kiss on his lips, then his jaw and then his collarbone, until he reaches his lower stomach and Dean is only able to release small trembling breaths. He is gripping the other man’s shoulder and it is as if that’s the only way Dean won’t lose it. Castiel unbuttons his jeans and starts sliding them down his legs, but stops because he is still wearing his shoes, he removes those first along with his shocks and then ends it with his jeans; Dean lays back staring at the cream ceiling and lets himself just feel big hands trailing his body.
“You sure?” she asks, “It’s office hours you are not bothering him. He just sometimes gets too absorbed in his work to-” she stops as the door opens and Novak comes out looking down at the papers in his hands.
“Excuse you”
They get out of the car and Cas unlocks a door, that Dean realises leads to the actual house and steps through. Dean watches him for a second, frozen in the threshold, before taking a hesitant step forward.
He grimaces at the thick air and he starts getting dressed hastily.
Jack shakes his head negative, protest on his lips and Dean smiles, a real smile. “You need to call me out on my bullshit.”
“I can ask her. But I can’t guarantee she will say yes.” he says, already knowing that Gilda will say yes, but better not risk it. He gets his phone out and shoots her a text. “Done” he says and smiles.
“A hospital and a bakery”
. Shut up.”
“I’m not going to go with you.” Castiel tells him seemingly to make things easier. Dean’s displeasure must show on his face, something that he doesn’t want to acknowledge, and the other man adds “Not if you don’t want me to”
About an hour later, he texts Eileen and asks her if she is free for an hour today to walk Oli, because he feels so bad about that and she responds she can be there in fifteen. Dean is so glad she doesn't ask. He goes to the front with him, gets the leash, bags and toys out and on bench so she can take them. Then goes back to bed, with Oli following him.
The first thing Dean notices when he enters the clinic is how clean it looks. It makes him feel a little weird. There is soft music playing in what he assumes is the waiting room, that has a counter and some comfortable looking chairs and some plants. There is a woman sitting in one of the chairs, reading a magazine.
“You don't have insurance” Dean bites his tongue so he doesn't have to respond. He hears Cas sigh and turns to look at him. “It’s not a big deal, trust me”
He absolutely earns the small slap in his ass.
“The third part, Into the Millennium, ends with drafts and notes as he tried to work out the ending”
“Dean?” he closes his eyes at the rumble of his name.
or- he doesn't know. He knows though, that Cas can sometimes get too absorbed into work and forget about things, but he never forgets about Dean. Also, Dean misses him, more than he is willing to admit.
“Dean?”
There is an awkward silence where they all stare at one another.
They stay until closing time and Ellen has to shoo them away. Jo whines at her, but when Ellen suggest she helps her with closing, at which she tells her no and shuts up, but does stay to help her. By the time he gets to the apartment he can barely keep his eyes open and he just plops down to his bed, knowing he will have a headache tomorrow.
“There is nothing to admire Cas. Nothing admirable” his lip curls in a snarl and a tear escapes his eye and he really hates himself for this, last night and everything else. “So, you should cut the whole saint thing or whatever the fuck you think I am”
find it endearing, “You really want to talk about Auden?”
Castiel’s knows it’s not the man they have been looking for, he lacks the certainty with which the crimes are being committed, as well as the sense of commitment into something like that. He knows that this bit was left in the security footage by the serial killer to through them off. It also betrays the arrogance the man feels and that he knows he is a step ahead of them and that he thinks it will stay that way, which makes Castiel hate the man even more.
“No?” she looks at him like she has already won and they both know she has, because there is no way Dean is not taking those spells. He won’t be able to go on without at least trying, even if he fails again and again.
The drive back to the bunker is silent, the air inside baby is thick. They are still victorious but with losses. Can’t have everything, that’s something Dean knows deep into his soul. It has been curved there since he was a kid. Which is why he is so angry with himself, at the cruel hope that had taken residence in his chest since Jack brought everyone back but not the one Dean-
“Cas. Cas come on. I can’t. No more”
“It needs consent too.”
“Look at you” he marvels and it’s almost too much. Castiel moves one of his legs, so it’s between Dean’s, trapping his cock there between them and Dean stutters, letting out shaky breaths.
“What?” he frowns at her even more confused.
“Claire” she says voice smaller than before and she glues herself to Castiel’s side.
He doesn’t know the moment he fell in love with him. He just realized one night that it was there. That it explained his behavior in the past years. That the overwhelming feeling, the urge to touch, to be next to him, in the same space as him, to be able to look at him, not that he did often, but it was that he could, simply turn his head and see, were love. Was him being in love, so in love that it evoked other emotions and thoughts that Dean never dared voice not even to himself.
“Now, the thing that interests all of you and the question I am always being asked is work load. For every piece of literature that we do, you will have to answer typically one or two questions, in a form of essay, small essay with a word limit of a six hundred words each, and at the end of each work you will have to write one essay that has a word limit of two thousand words, you can find all these in the course notes.”
“Dean” he hears him say and can he please stop saying his name like that or at all.
And maybe it’s too much of a trust and he should confirm this, they both should, but Dean can’t anymore he needs-
He shouts good night and shuts himself in his room.
? If there is one thing that Dean learned in his induction week is that if you have a problem you contact the lecturer if it’s academic (otherwise the administration office) and only if it’s not in the handbook or website, the programme leads are to be contacted as a last resort or if you are in real trouble. And if they can’t solve your problem then you move up, or better yet they refer you up.
in their case – all it does is freeze them in a place where they each live content in the known, silent conversations, that barely scratch the surface, are just enough to lessen the longing. Even if for Dean they were so precious, so theirs. Something no one could take away from him. He is aware deep in his mind, that he would never get tired of looking at Cas, of having that with Cas.
“Shush”
They leave the room, saying goodbye at the officers by the door and get into the elevator. Castiel presses the button from the ground floor.
“No.”
“Has she ugh, resurrected more?” Sam asks hesitantly, warily, doesn’t look at Dean but his whole body goes rigid, shoulders squaring and his chin drops, like he is ready to fight or grasp a wild animal.
He gets a text from Hannah saying that the envelope was left in the reception, by a woman they haven’t identified and an officer brought it up. He sighs, his mood dropping and Dean looks at him carefully, like he is trying not to upset him as well as figure out what happened, but he doesn't ask or make a comment and Castiel is grateful for that. He guesses that Dean knows the general subject of the message and Castiel tries not to think about what he does at nights. Usually he is good at avoiding those thoughts, but having him sitting in front him, a breath away, makes it hard.
He exhales soundly, petting her head softly when she lazily lifts it to look at him. He lets her lick his hand before heading to the bathroom for a shower.
“I will give you the black with bitter almond, Gabriel brought it from Paris a month ago and it has become my favourite” he says decisively and opens a cabinet getting a container out.
“I’ll give you my phone number.” He lowers his hand to watch her. “Practice.” She insists.
He doesn't know if he likes therapy or not. But he does like Billie, or likes that she gives him a certainty, for what he doesn't know.
The first year and a half was difficult, they hardly saw each other with their working hours, but now Dean only stays at the bar until closing time, only a couple of nights a week. He didn't like it at first partly because he was worried, although he did trust Pamela and Benny to close up and that they could run things when he wasn't there, and partly because, well, he actually likes his job. But Cas,
“You can’t tell anyone I told you” he says seriously, maybe the most serious Dean has heard him.
He removes his fingers and reaches for a tissue in the nightstand to wipe them and Dean kinda wants to hit (just his arm, lightly) him, kinda wants to kiss him stupid.
“What do you want to watch?” he asks Dean, without looking up from where he is browsing.
For a few seconds Dean freezes, fear crippling through his body, heart racing, all he can hear is the blood in his ears and there are tears in his eyes that he wipes hastily getting up. Bobby was supposed to be a-
“You know, you should learn to accept help”
“I think that we both know, what you fear is. Being left behind. First with your dad and mom, especially your mom, since she kept leaving you behind and coming back, though in a more figurative way than the others. Gabriel for some time and then he came back. Then Mick and now you let Dean leave, because you are not certain you can keep him around and you believe that he will leave at another point. Isn’t it why you closed off and became cold?”
He glances up at her, “Wha’?”
At this point he is just walking, not looking at the books. He walks until he reaches the one end of the library with the stairs that lead to the third floor. He turns around, ready to walk back, when in his peripheral vision he sees him. And he turns, rather abruptly, to make sure it really is him.
“Every shitty motel room across the country” he answers and Castiel’s face freezes, before frowning down at him.
going like a mantra in his head.
“Did something happen?” he asks needlessly, there is an emotion that rushes all through Dean which he can’t name, that makes him want to heave.
He opens the bunker’s door and they are outside. He doesn’t think about the dream. In fact he tries not think about anything the whole day.
It shakes, it rattles in his chest and spills from his mouth, “I love you.” Someone squeezes his chest in the aftermath and Dean stops breathing for seconds after. “And-” he can’t go on.
“You saying you don't want to?”
“Just peachy.” He shrugs watching as Cas rolls his eyes and goes back to his book.
“I saw Arthur one the hallway before I left” She explains “You going for lunch?” when Castiel nods she continues “Mind if I join you?”
What is probably as bad as those words is Cas’ face when he said them. Dean has never been looked at like that, and something about it makes him warm and he feels something humming under his skin and he hates it. He hates all those things that go through him, every time he thinks about it or Cas, so he tries to ignore them.
“Dean” Cas looks so lost and hurt and distressed and Dean can’t look at him right now.
“Well, we good always sacrifice a pig.” At Sam’s blank stare Michael shrugs, “Greek gods seemed to like that, I don’t believe that has changed.”
“He noticed, about the window thing and I told him. Well not the whole truth I’ve never told anyone about it. Gabriel knows but, well he was there. It was strange and liberating, because I couldn't tell him everything then, I mean about the shutting me in the basement thing at times when I would argue for what I liked, but I felt that given time I could tell him that”
“Do you want a ride?” Castiel asks cautiously, as if he is afraid he will spook Dean and checks his phone.
When seconds pass with nothing happening but him looking at her as before, she starts to relaxes marginally. Her palms open and lay on top of the counter, next to the full cup of tea.
“Dean.” Sam tries a few minute later and Dean grips the steering wheel until his palms burn.
, in his thighs and suddenly Dean can’t draw a single breath and he knows he is red as a tomato.  Yeah, today is a shitty day.
Castiel makes a low sound, which Dean has barely enough time to register before the other man reaches forward and kisses him. It’s hard and sloppy and passionate and all the things he has been waiting for all week. They stumble, still kissing, until they are both inside and the door is shut behind them. They break apart, and Castiel says low and huskily, making Dean whine.
“We liked some of his writing” Alfie butts in, from next to her.
“It’s just… You look different, I don't know how, but you do”
“It’s nothing, dear” The girl turns and heads out, giving Dean a small smile.
“So, I know you said you are stressed and want to get away, but how are the wedding preparations going?” he asks, because he needs to keep at the front of his mind that the guy is getting married.
“Castiel”
He stares dully out the window, finger tapping his thigh at a high tempo, telling Castiel which way to go.
“And I don’t?”
Dean grips the wrist of the hand that is holding his face and leans forward. Burring himself in his chest. He is trembling. He missed him so much.
“Don’t be.” He doesn’t cry, not over men.
“What was that?” he asks a little confused and amused.
“Well, as long as he is tested why not?” she shrugs and gives him a too innocent smile.
Still nothing from Cas, that hurts, more than it did before, because Dean needs him. He almost cries again, but instead puts the movie back on and this time watches it and then falls asleep.
Serving tables like Jo, on the weekends or some nights after finishing his shift at Bobbys’, and then when he was twenty-two, he decided he wanted to work behind the bar full time and two years later realized he wanted to own his own place. It all feels so distant and fresh, and he has a hard time wrapping his head around everything.
