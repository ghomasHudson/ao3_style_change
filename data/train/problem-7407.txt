“What? Why?” he demanded.
There was that coy smile again.
then.
He felt only slightly less responsible for the fact that Nat and Pepper had chosen to tag along. Of course, they had missed the initial argument, and probably wouldn’t have been dragged into the silliness of it even if they’d been there - officially speaking, it had been their own choice to come. But Steve still felt like the awful afternoon they were about to suffer through was somehow on him. That it had been triggered by him. That he could have stopped this whole thing a long time ago…
“You should come to the university in Ammerek,” one of the Varians announced, when he’d finished laughing at Tony’s story. “I would
“And, also,
So, as usual, he didn’t say anything. He just stood there and watched as Tony slowly melted into sleep, thinking all the things he wasn’t allowed to say.
“What’s Ambience, by the way?” Steve asked quickly, before Tony could reach the door. Tony paused mid-stride to look at him. “I, uh, missed that bit.”
And then Tony looked back to Steve, and saw that Steve was okay, that he was safe – that he was right

forgotten that Steve was standing just behind him, watching everything he did…
Steve had tried several times to stop bouncing his feet.
“... I don’t even know,” Rhodey frowned. By now he seemed more tired than high, which Tony took as a sign that things were moving in the right direction. He glanced at Pepper, intending to ask the same question - but found her lost in the middle distance, a comfortable smile on her face, and figured that was an answer in itself.
In a fit of pique, Steve threw the covers aside and sat himself up, shuffling to the edge of the bed before he asked himself where he was going.
But, in amongst all that, there
“Hang on, wait a minute - start again,” Tony said, waving a hand in front of him. “We’re

...He missed seeing Tony smile-

“Do you know anything about a ‘special project’?” Steve got back to the point, his voice cold. “Something your boss – Adam, is it? – Something big he might be working on?”
Why he was doing it.
with what he wanted to do with Steve. That just because it was the same ‘act’, sort of, didn’t mean it was the same thing. That what Obie did was unwanted, and violent, and motivated by a desire for control and his own self-gratification – that Tony wasn’t like him, for thinking this way now.
And Steve
“So, wait -
When he looked back up, there was an innocent sort of courage in his eyes, different to that fierce defiance Steve usually came up against…

The door felt heavy when Steve tugged it open a crack.
Adam’s eyes widen in alarm, at whatever the announcement had been. He saw him glance, forlornly, at the smartphone he didn’t dare lunge for-
be chastening himself for in the morning-
Even in that moment, at his most overwhelmed and emotional, Steve knew he didn’t want to stay here. He knew this wasn’t the only place he’d ever think of as home, and he knew that sometimes it was right to leave home - and he knew that this wasn’t where he would be happiest, wherever ‘home’ was to him.
The closest he could manage was,
And then, for a few moments, there was just the feeling of Steve’s body, pressed close against him.
“Okay, I just… To be honest, I need to drink, and I’d really rather not do it when you’re here,” he tried… and watched her consider that carefully…
“Okay, Captain Rogers, just take a deep breath for me,” Stape was speaking in the tone of a doctor now, his hesitance forgotten as he rushed over to Steve’s side-
As he tasted more of Steve’s blood.
just suit him better.
And Tony genuinely didn’t know which part of that he felt bad for. Only that he found himself in the middle of an uncomfortable personal crisis, on top of everything else…
And Steve swallowed, his eyes lighting up with the most endearing burst of exhilaration. And then he gave a little nod.
He’d collected two and a half pints within an hour of Tony’s call, telling himself it was because the med lab was likely to be deserted at this time of the morning…

He saw the thought flicker behind Steve’s eyes, the nervous pursing of his lips. Tony raised his eyebrows,
“There’s nothing like that in the guide - but I can find those details for you,” Freddie answered obligingly. “I can’t be sure how well the details will translate into Terran sensibilities, but I will bring everything that we have. You may also be interested in attending the Hans Zarkov Annual Flower Show this afternoon - you’ll find the leading experts on the Bulsaran Ecosystem there.”
He could barely feel his own body anymore, he was so focused on what Steve was feeling-
He could imagine how Steve would feel, strong and solid and soft and giving, under his hands-
Because Steve was here.

Tony looked away.

To be as sweet or as submissive or as presumptuous as he felt like being, without ever wondering what it said about him.
And any of those things
Thoughts about Steve, obviously, and repeated reminders not to think about him - all of which was taking up far too much space-
“You were amazing tonight,” Steve whispered, waiting until Tony looked up at him to take his hand. “You were so brave, and so strong, and so
, I wasn’t even thinking about them, really… and it didn’t have anything to do with you, and I’m sorry I took it out on you.”
…And Steve put his feet up on the bench beside him

everything about Tony, he knew every different, wonderful quality about him, he could
And he just keeled over.
“Eh, aimless curiosity, I think,” Tony blushed, tilting his head so that Steve could see the paperwork in front of him. Accounting records, or personnel files, or something dry like that.
He didn’t break his rhythm as he shifted back just a little, so that he could lower his head and press a soft kiss to the inside of Steve’s thigh-
And then Steve pinched his lips together, bashful and hopeful and touchingly vulnerable, and gathered himself in that courageous way of his-
Tony didn’t even know if he was supposed to be avoiding it.
“I think… well, it would’ve been a different ending, certainly…” Tony mused –
himself. He hated himself for how he’d ruined his own life, he hated himself for what he’d done to Tony
something immediate and primal, something that was no part of the person he used to be… Something that could claim priority from his conscious mind at moments like these, whether he wanted it to or not.
Oh, the smell of him…
“But not every day?”
And he thought of Tony’s hands. Tony’s beautiful, clever hands stroking him like this, his eyes locked on Steve’s, his lips full and slightly parted.
…That was a far more nebulous, overwhelming sentiment than ‘I’m sorry I stole your car’.
. This mission is not one of your private planes!”
Bulsara - when you see what this festival has to offer - you’ll understand that it’s an opportunity you would never have declined. No one would.”
Dejectedly, he looked at the file...
It was a low, humming sort of energy, the kind he was barely aware of but that somehow kept him from sitting still. By late afternoon he’d fallen into that strange grey area where he was both tired and full of adrenaline, his legs throbbing gently with exertion and still rebelling against rest.
But it wasn’t
Because they still hadn’t talked about Bucky.
“And you
“It’s just that I’ve spent so long imagining...” Steve sighed, glancing down at his hands. “If… If I hadn’t stopped you from hurting Bucky, if Bucky had hurt you… If
“Because I’m a vampire,” he replied, without even thinking about it. Because it was just in Steve’s best interested to dispense with the question, and this was the quickest way to do it. “We don’t need to breathe at all.”
...But to convince himself of that, he’d have to think about it.
“Why, what would you rather do?” Tony sighed. He knew from too much experience that it was always better to engage a drunk than try to argue with him.
But thank you so much to everyone who's still reading - I really hope you enjoy it!
And then remembering how casually Nick Fury had strolled through Tony’s living room - how little he’d thought of that violation…
“Okay, this is really sounding more like an Avengers thing,” Rhodey suggested, forcefully.
And, weirdly enough, it was the advice he was given as a very small child that came floating back to him
Actually, he’d have done it if he thought it would save him even a minute of time.
And when he tried to… He found he couldn’t even remember what half of these words were for. He couldn’t be sure he was remembering any of them right. He couldn’t remember whether they were things Obie told him
The day had passed more pleasantly than any day since Steve and his team had come back home.
The one thing Tony had said that he couldn’t immediately answer.

...And, more alarming, the thought wasn’t
Once he woke up in a ‘recovery room in New York City’, assumed to be the same man who fell into the ice 70 years earlier, already completely briefed in the details of the era… Then he already was that person. He had established his identity and the foundation for his future plans. The only thing left on his official list was ‘leave SHIELD and go to Tony’-
Oh God, he
sort of kindness that caught Steve completely off guard.
...Well, it was
But there was still a hesitation in her. An electricity in the pause she left…too long…
He looked
“...No, I do,” he confessed, shyly.
Steve wondered what that would look like…
Tony smiled to himself, wondering how it had taken him this long to work out… And realised-
Well, except for ignoring it.
I can say to you now, because I can’t ask you to forgive me and I can’t ask you to understand me and you already know I was reckless and selfish and wrong. I don’t have any right to say any of the things I… I know you won’t believe me, and you must think – and every time I try, it just comes out all wrong, and… there are so many things I can’t explain, I just-”
“Yes, hi, pleased to meet you” Tony jumped in energetically, taking a tiny little sidestep… trying to put himself between Steve and their sudden guests. “It’s Maribelle, right?”
Steve woke up, and immediately knew that something had happened.
And he was just
And then it was like that little light inside him just died. Like cool water thrown over glowing embers,

I was an ass to him, too - but-” And then Bucky saw him pinch his lips together so tightly that he had to wonder if he’d drawn blood.
But he could feel Tony moving closer. Steve scrabbled to shift his mind out of daydream-mode, as all of his muscled tensed in preparation for something… for
escalating effect of the drugs, he really had been yelling at himself to get Tony and go. He had a very simple two-point plan, which he’d been repeating to himself over and over for the last two minutes, just hoping he could keep his head clear enough for long enough to say it. He’d forgotten the wider context, he couldn’t let himself be distracted by more details than that, he just had to 1) Make Sure Tony Said It Was Okay To Leave, and 2) Leave.
perfectly human - or, at least, he was sure that he would always have thought Steve was incredibly hot, right now… But the depth of feeling that Tony was capable of seemed to be increasing by the day. He wondered if it was possible that he actually felt attraction differently now. If he maybe just experienced
they can’t!” Steve outright yelled. “The whole world doesn’t just wait for you to decide you’re ready! You can’t just leave a team mate and the whole strategy team upstairs getting angry because you’ve decided you want to have this conversation right now! Not any time in the last three days, no, you want to talk to me
He almost panicked, it was just
He sat up again, and made himself look at the file reader. It was a homemade device that looked like a tablet computer, except that this had been specifically designed as the most hack-proof piece of equipment on earth. The USB stick blinking patiently, the screen awake but blank, waiting for the download to complete… Tony stared at it anyway. He would
But there were upsides to it.
And then he just… carried on talking.
…Oh, God, but that would mean-
And Steve didn’t step away.
He knew that all of Hydra’s internal systems had been frozen within minutes of their arrival in Siberia - because Tony had written that virus, and Tony was sure it had worked. As far as Steve was concerned, that detail was an absolute certainty. Anyone who’d received a report that Hydra were under attack would’ve soon discovered that they no longer had a list of contacts, that their communication systems were down in any case, that all their professional access privileges had been revoked - that any information they wanted to grab for had already been deleted.
. The casual contempt with which he simply dismissed anyone who dared to aim for Tony.
When the portal closed behind them there was a moment of deafening silence. A sudden isolation and stillness that almost buzzed around their heads.
And then Steve had gone and said that he’d just… got to like him.
get its head kicked in to prove his point. That he had no right to dismiss anyone else's suffering, just because everyone seemed quite happy to dismiss his.
. That he’d babbled, and ended up in an agonising and protracted discussion about the nature of blood donation, and whether he trusted Nick-
And then Steve noticed, and turned to face him… The most endearing expression of hurt confusion on his face…
And he did love Steve, and everything
when he talked about Operation Rebirth...But Tony could hear the sadness in it.
His legs, tense and almost trembling, spread wide under Tony’s hands-
“Because it’s not just the sunlight thing, you know,” Tony added suddenly, taking a step towards Steve. “It’s…
appealing idea that maybe his father had done something similar. That all this time Tony had been taking his fathers’ shifty gestures as some indication of Steve’s nature, when in fact they were a sign of Howard’s own guilt and inadequacies...
He reached the door in two long strides, putting perhaps a tad too much enthusiasm into opening it-

He found himself turning the paper over - immediately recognising his fathers handwriting on the back.
Tony frowned at the screen.
And he’d thought it now.

...But then, he’d never been in love before.
Suddenly, Tony wanted to demand answers in a far more urgent way. He wanted to ask Steve to start again, to question every detail with this new sense of purpose…

hit him. His expression flashed open in shock and hurt, his lips parting as though he’d just stopped mid breath. He looked like a child. And then he dropped his eyes, his shoulders slumping slightly in a way that was most unlike him, and for a moment Steve could only feel overwhelmingly sorry for him.
Tony watched as JARVIS dutifully transcribed his ramblings onto several different holographic screens - so far titled ‘The Death of Mr and Mrs Stark’, ‘Hydra’, ‘Aliens’, and, diplomatically, ‘Steve Rogers’ and ‘Time Travel’.
,” and he paused, to narrow his eyes sceptically at Steve, before he carried on, “
“Well, no, you don’t – have to…” Tony cut in just a bit too quickly, faltering when Steve’s gaze snapped to meet his. “…It’s an interesting concept, I mean. And, uh, I think you’re right, for what it’s worth…” He trailed off, awkwardly.

Century social events that Steve was regularly pressured into, ‘galas’ were amongst his least favourite. Everyone had always seemed too preoccupied with how they looked, or who they were networking with, or who they were seen by, to actually have fun. Everything seemed too contrived, too controlled… too judgemental.
this was all for the greater good. Maybe he’d part convinced himself that he really was the hero of this story… But Steve could see that, just below the surface, Stape knew full well he was in this for selfish reasons.
He was done with thinking about this, for one evening.
The guy strummed the lute-lele again, in a random note that seemed to have nothing to do with his tuneless intonation.
“Steve-”
Oh… Steve wasn’t expecting that to feel good.
“None of what?” Tony pressed, without the slightest trace of fear in his voice.
both real pieces. But taken as a whole… It could all be true and all fall into place and all be a part of this thing between them. This one complete picture, that did make sense…that was so much more beautiful than an easier puzzle would’ve been…
He’d not even thought about…
Like the rest of the palace, it had been decorated in a burst of uncoordinated post-mission enthusiasm. Delicate webs of silver lights had been hung from every eave, encasing the patio area in a shimmering curtain, like the willows that framed fairy-tale images of enchanted lagoons. In one of her many whimsical impulses - which had also included covering the front lawn in glitter, and filling all of the flower pots with glow sticks - Shuri had drained the swimming pool and filled it with brightly coloured plastic balls. With a single element altered, or on another night, it might have looked contrived, or messy, but somehow everything had come together to create an intimate, magical atmosphere in the garden… Something authentic, and fun, and unique to this one moment in time.
Steve swallowed hard, a hot, salty taste coating his tongue. His next breath trembled. At
It might have been easier if Steve had just had ‘a plan for world domination’. Tony would have thought he was crazy, but at least it would be simple to explain.
His hand reached out and took the flyer down from the fridge, just following an instinct to be as close to Steve as possible, to grab at whatever part of him was within reach. Tony ran a fingertip over the familiar sweeps and curves of Steve’s handwriting as he thought about him…
...Did he really want to do any of these things? Or was it only that he hated the thought of not being

there was something more.
“We think that, to start with, they
But he knew it wasn’t for him to put this on.
Steve thought back to the stoic generals and politicians of his era. The sombre way they took responsibility for everything, out of some universal sense of honour…whilst never really taking responsibility for anything at all.
That’s why he didn’t want to hear the truth about this company, why he felt compelled to defend them…
But Tony brought one hand to the centre of Steve’s chest, the gym bag still dangling carelessly from the other, and told him in a kind,
“...Loki’s attack is going to arrive in May, 2012,” Steve confirmed, carefully. “Which we may be able to stop altogether - and we can certainly better prepare for-”
“And you know you’ll never get everyone on Earth to do that…” Steve prompted.
“I do hate the word unnatural,” Steve conceded, with a little wince.
It was a physical thing, as much as anything else. A change in the basic processes of his body… If he let himself, Tony would be able to remember the last vial of blood that wasn’t Steve’s. That sour taste, like a natural warning against poison. He couldn’t swallow it
Mindlessly, he looked down to the stack of manila files on his coffee table. The cold, heartless details designed to summarise the lives and deaths of his closest friends.
Pepper jumped to immediate, shocked attention, her mouth literally falling open as she stared at him.
Just a bit too far away.
He didn’t even know where that particular thought had come from, other than maybe it was just one of those things he was never allowed to think, taking its turn to stretch its legs along with all the other ugly human impulses.
“Tony?” He pressed, swallowing down a bitter taste. And then, at last, Tony glanced up at him… and there was just something about his face. A slight shadow under his eyes, a softness in his skin… something…
So, suffice to say I was a *little* bit optimistic when I said the work situation had calmed down, and once again dates got rearranged, so - once again - I am very sorry for the delay in this update 🙈🙈🙈
“Any questions?” Tony asked, snapping Steve out of his thoughts.
“You’re saying you can make a Varian truth serum?” Steve summarised, one eyebrow raised.
“Being a vampire… drinking

The shapes and sounds and sensations around him didn’t feel the same anymore, they didn’t mean anything to him.
There had never been any way for him to fix this, on his own.
The vampire susceptibility to sunlight might have been exaggerated, but Tony still knew that it made Steve uncomfortable to be out during the day. So, as keen as they both were to continue their investigations, Tony had managed to convince Steve to wait until after sunset-
He just pulled Tony in to kiss him.

He was happy that Steve could have a proper shower in a clean bathroom, that he’d been able to change into clean clothes, that Tony could send him back to his team with a rucksack full of fresh supplies and personal items.

Something in Steve responded to that, and he found himself shuffling closer, instinctively putting an arm around Tony’s shoulder even as the rest of him seethed. Tony relaxed against his chest-
“Well, I’d heard of you, before. Obviously. I do keep up with the events of planet Earth.” Adam answered, calmly, after a pause.
And Steve pushed

fears… Tony hadn’t faced those himself yet. Tony wasn’t sure he wanted to face them, ever – he couldn’t bear Steve to know them. He couldn’t stand the thought of Steve trying to argue with them, of having to
And, of course, lasted exactly as long as it took for Tony to catch up with him.
“Yeah, I’m okay,” Tony nodded – surprised by how easy it was, so quickly…
Steve actually breathed out a little laugh. And Tony thought to himself…
Which had left Steve with a seemingly
Gingerly, he held his outfit out in front of him. As he’d suspected, every inch of the floor length tunic was covered with those thick metallic sequins, arranged in spirals of silver and blue and purple and red…
His mind was working on autopilot by now, just shuffling through all the giddy anxieties he’d spent the whole day on. Most of it had lost all meaning hours ago.
Unthinkingly, Tony committed himself to those final few steps, and let himself fall into the couch as a deadweight. His legs throbbed in muted protest, and his eyes stung under the change in the light - but Tony couldn’t quite understand it as ‘tired’.
… took a lot less mental effort. It felt less
it that way… But he suddenly realised how it would’ve come across – how it would’ve made Tony feel. And now he understood exactly why Tony thought he wasn’t sorry… even why Tony thought he didn’t care about his feelings… Because Steve had done something personally hurtful, and then treated Tony like someone whose reaction he was simply trying to placate.
And possibly take another moment to berate himself for ever getting into this ridiculous situation, just for good measure.
He’d tried telling his brain to be quiet – which proved as effective and as frustrating as yelling at the weather.
“My question is this,” Tony announced, theatrically. “If
And he realised Steve was just staring at him.
He just felt so bad for how he’d phrased everything – so guilty at the thought of what Steve might be thinking, right now. That instinct that something was off centre, not working properly, not right… and his natural inclination to
Even if literally no one else understood why.
And then Tony sighed, a happy, relaxed sound that was somehow in
and realised that he’d either have to be confused forever or prove Obie right about something.
“...I’ve heard that word before,” Steve murmured, pursing his lips as though he was repeating it in his head.
“Tony” He whispered sharply, and waved him over to see.
Time seemed to slow down, and stretch… The whole world faded further out of focus, as Steve was brought closer into himself… and Tony… the two of them together, still connected in this other, separate thing…
...And he sort of knew that there would come a point, pretty soon, when there was no putting it right.
But it was too late now. Tony had already fallen into the details of it - which he could remember with the same eerie clarity as that adrenaline fuelled mission. The way Steve had put his entire body into every movement, holding Tony against his chest with such fierce determination, kissing him with a frantic sort of passion, as though he simply couldn’t love Tony enough… The promises and praise that Steve whispered against Tony’s throat, his voice raw and powerful and…
. It had taken him so long to figure out the language and the culture and the norms of the 21st Century, especially in the months before he even had any friends to talk to.
“Maybe, if it had
And only then did Steve recognise the
“Varians” He whispered to Tony, gesturing to two small, blue-skinned men in white coats, walking away from them, over to one of the computers… where three more, similarly professional looking Varians were already standing…
Because he was trying to think of anything he could say to distance himself from what he’d just said-
“And, it’s like suddenly there’s no context,” Tony continued, with a gentle smile. “Like, okay, everything I thought I knew was wrong… so what do I know now?”
And then Steve’s phone buzzed.
A flood of relief that Tony was here crashed right into a wall of concern – because Tony wasn’t where he

And then a sudden, cold dread swelled up in Tony’s stomach, up into his chest, flooding his entire body.

“Would you like a blanket?” Someone asked from behind the couch, in a friendly, casual tone of voice. Steve glanced up to see a Varian woman with a polite expression on her face, offering him one of the fleecy throw blankets that decorated some of the chairs.
Steve was almost glad of the stab of indignation that he felt. It was perversely comforting to think that their entire relationship hadn’t changed as a result of his recent revelations.

There was a sharp twist of pain in Tony’s chest - some of it familiar, some of it new… He swallowed hard, and wondered again what ‘getting over it’ really looked like.
“Tony wasn’t your wife, Steve,” Clint reminded him viciously. “He wasn’t even your friend - you hadn’t spoken to him for five fucking years before he died. So don’t talk to me like our pain was the same. It’s not even the same now. Nat

And Tony raised his head to look at Steve again before he spoke. So that Steve would see him smile when he said.
A revelation that was, for the moment, secondary to the actual thing he was thinking.

That he didn’t have to stay in control, right now.

Meanwhile, Steve was slowly,
If he should try to tell Tony how much it really meant, to have a safe haven out there somewhere - to have someone who cared about keeping him safe.
Well, before that chance had passed.
“Yeah, of course,”
This time, Tony opened his mouth willingly. This time he fought

noise when he smiled at that, which was vaguely embarrassing.
…Of course, a much larger part of him knew that was a total lie. And
“Oh Jesus Tony-” Steve gasped, cut off when Tony kissed him again - messy and demanding, this time. Steve kissed him back just as hungrily, pushing Tony’s lips further apart, devouring his mouth as he carried on rutting against him, teasing that compulsive pleasure ever closer to the surface. He grabbed shamelessly for every inch of Tony that he could reach, clawing frantically at his clothes, groping at his ass and thighs as Tony writhed in his lap.
He knew that he

And he tried not to hold his breath as Tony took it, and flipped it over, and smiled again.
Everything came much more easily, now.

He checked his phone again. Still 3:43am. Still no update.
And, oddly enough, it was the exact same image that flashed up in his mind. Him, naked and pleading and offering himself up… Steve, stroking his hands over Tony’s skin… Strong, and commanding, and kind…
Maybe it was better to let Tony do the talking…
…And all the ideas he suddenly had of
Tony was just…
And Tony knew that he should
“...Am I what?” He asked, glancing at the desk.
After all this time overthinking it and trying not to think about it and worrying about it and pretending he wasn’t worried about it – and it had just happened.
Oh yeah. Steve had such wonderful, strong arms, and being held in them was such an exhilarating, safe feeling, unlike anything else in the world…
, before he added, “And there is the hurt it caused me” And he held out his right hand,

Steve’s hands ran under Tony’s shirt, seeking out more of him, delighting in the sensation of Tony’s skin under his hands and the way he writhed up against Steve’s touches and the soft little sounds he made against Steve’s lips.
Of course he was sad that he would never again know the simple confidence and excited novelty of his youth. Of course there was a part of him that was harmlessly jealous to think of where that Bucky was going, what adventures he and another Steve Rogers had to look forward to, what things they were about to discover for the first time…
And then he saw Tony sit up, his eyes snapping to a fixed point somewhere beyond the balcony railing. He turned to look, even though he already knew.
Except that, this time, Steve was

So, there was nothing else he could do-

So he didn’t bother to dramatically throw himself into the couch this time, having finally figured out that it wouldn’t calm him down. Instead, he tried to make himself stand still for a moment, coming to an awkward, agitated stop in front of the fireplace. He
And only then did Steve recognise how defensive he’d sounded… Angry even…

in the workshop. The rest of the room was in a state of total chaos. His appointments with Bucky were always either Med Lab appointments or workshop appointments, and Tony had never bothered to tidy one if they were going to be spending all evening in the other. He’d had no reason to think anyone would be coming down here tonight, he’d made no effort to tidy away any of the debris from his latest project – he couldn’t even remember what his latest project was, right now.

He thought of the first time he made Tony laugh, and the first time Tony kissed him, and the first time Tony drank his blood… Steve thought of all the hopes and fear he’d felt in those moments.
Tony watched in slow motion as Steve realised that Tony had come for him. He

Followed pretty quickly by a surge of relief, when he recognised Nick Fury.
At the time, Steve had been too focused on the individual challenges to think about the bigger picture. He
And then his phone rang.
Standing right there, taking up so much more space than Tony had been expecting…
If there was any chance that Tony would let him say how grateful he was for all of this…
And… God, this seemed like such a big moment, and the only person he wanted to tell was Tony… and he wasn’t sure he should. And that was weird, right? To have committed himself to someone and not be sure he should mention it to

those people got exactly what they deserved. He was glad that he didn’t have to spend the rest of his life wishing that revenge upon them, that he could comfort himself with the thought that they’d suffered-
The brief fire of his interest seemed to burn out, his words melting back into that warm, sleepy tone as he settled back against the wall.
It wasn’t about Clint. It really wasn’t. And it certainly wasn’t about

It meant having to wonder if Tony really meant all the things he’d said. If Tony really

He was aware of the voices around him, and the feeling of movement when he was wheeled from one room to another, but he felt like he was floating through it, in a dream. He had to concentrate a little to keep himself pliant and unresponsive when they were taking him out of his uniform and checking him for injuries and putting him into his faux-1940s outfit - but, luckily, at that point the doctors were more interested in watching the monitors than Steve’s face. He drifted away again when he heard two consultants discussing his ‘encouraging recovery statistics’, and was reassured that they were buying his performance.
And then Tony was just standing there, his phone still pressed against his ear, a stupid grin plastered all over his face.
In fact, his attention had been snagged by the tone that Tony had slipped into at the end - the sharp edge on his sentences, the hint of genuine bitterness when he mocked the original plan to post Hydra’s files online…
He’d have been too scared of what might happen if he put it out there, the unintended consequences it would cause.
Wanda looked up, right at Steve, her jaw set in steely defiance. Steve felt a spike of adrenaline, a primal sort of temper that he hadn’t felt since he was scrapping in a schoolyard in Brooklyn.

And then, to make everything so much worse, an excitable assistant rushed over to give them their ‘ceremonial robes’ for the event.
And then, just as it was reaching that tipping point, Tony saw it - like a life preserver thrown into a stormy sea-
“No, you were doing it to put him in his place,” Steve shot back. “You were doing it because you wanted to prove that Tony doesn’t know everything, that he’s not as smart as he thinks he is, that he doesn’t see the bigger picture - not like you do. You did it because you thought he was reckless and arrogant, and because it never occurred to you that you didn’t have the right to punish him for that. You did it because you thought you could teach him a lesson, for committing the
“Oh God please, please Tony please,” Steve babbled mindlessly, even as he was registering the heavy metallic sound of a zipper being pulled. He realised in time to look up and see Tony’s pants hanging open, slung low over his hips, while Tony worked a hand over his cock.
“Sergeant Barnes, sir,” JARVIS explained – and Tony felt his spine jolt up from under him.

The thought that maybe, just maybe, Tony might feel

Tony huffed a frustrated breath and set the data case down on the coffee table. He did his best to ignore the prickle of apprehension that rushed over his skin, as he reached into his pocket and curled his fingers around the weight at the bottom of it.
“Wow.”
He had just been so…
And it was the same woman as had killed people for the KGB… Steve had always known that…

“No, we probably have to wait until they’re actually doing something down there, for it to be any use looking at it.” Tony sighed, obviously thinking the same thing Steve was.

“I don’t know – that’s one of the things that just starts coming up, after a while. I can’t find an explanation for it, either.” Tony shrugged. “That, and Genesis Day, which I can’t tell if that refers to an actual day, or a drug, or what…”

“Yeah, sure,” Steve shrugged, still beaming at the prospect. And then he glanced towards the kitchen, “I mean, uh, I’ve been trying to lie low, so I don’t have much in-”
“Eyes open baby, come on,” Tony’s voice came from just beside him. Steve blinked, his vision already obscured by purple shadows, sleep closing in around the edges.
“Drink?” Tony asked, an edge of humour on his voice. Steve managed a joyless smile. He pointedly did not watch Tony walk over to the bar. Instead, he took an
Tony’s hips rocked into him of their own accord; an entirely reflexive, corporal reaction that he was then powerless to stop. As soon as he moved, that same searing pleasure engulfed him, that same physical longing consumed him - Steve’s face lit up with that same beautiful excitement. Tony had no choice but to surrender to that sensation, simply following his body as he chased it, quickly building into a fast, deep rhythm.

Somewhere, it occurred to Tony that they were
Instantly, Steve snapped back to focus on the photographer again, a literal growl rolling from somewhere low in his chest. Tony’s blood flashed hot at the sound of it, but he ignored that reaction in favour of a more pressing concern-
“Is that so?” Steve grinned in response. As it turned out, Selvig was an easy man to like, and Steve had rather enjoyed his company for the last three days.
“So, any questions?” Maribelle asked.
And that threw Tony, for just a second.
Immediately Steve felt the entire world

That Steve would have to make choices now, choices that he wasn’t prepared for - choices he would never be able to take back…
Rhodey gave a little shrug at that, like he didn’t really get it but was happy to go along with it, and finally got out of the car – sprinting a few steps ahead of Tony, so that he could open the door for him. Tony was glad of that little gesture. Not that the sunlight was actually

“I don’t mean for getting upset,” Steve clarified. “Actually, I’m sort of glad I got upset, and that I let you see it. I think it… helped, with a lot of things. I think

I think that’s because they’re obviously changing the concentrations at different times of the day.

capacity – how could he know whether Steve had just been permanently high since the first time Tony grabbed his wrist? Tony didn’t know what this bond was or how it worked or even if it was all in his own head – and how could he ask Steve whether he was in his right mind or not? How could Tony trust the answer?
He saw Tony’s face soften into a blank expression that was so hard to read… But so very pretty.
But Tony decided to push on with this first. For whatever reason, it felt important that he did this bit
“Well, it’s a
Hoping that he’d be able to think of things to talk about, hoping that he looked okay… hoping Tony would kiss him…

Partly, it was because he suddenly couldn’t be bothered explaining himself to either of them.
Tony stood in front of the mirror, and straightened his collar for maybe the hundredth time. The skin on the back of his neck was starting to feel raw by now-
Steve wanted to wonder about that - but the headache kicked in before he could even begin. The whole thing felt too huge, too shapeless… Thinking about any one part of it felt hopeless. Faintly ridiculous, somehow…
Which was fine.

“Why?” He asked very quietly, unable to meet Tony’s gaze.
God, he wanted to find the words for this. If he was going to have this breakdown, and all the consequences that came with it – he’d always wanted to much to find some way to say
“Let’s try shots” Steve suggested, as Tony walked away. This would be easier with less actual fluid to drink, he reasoned. And then he felt someone looking at him, and already knew it was her. He sighed, and downed the drink.

Trying to work out some way to keep Tony, trying to think of the right things to say… with a horrible feeling that he’d already gone past that point. That there were a thousand times he would have said something else, if he’d only known. That he’d already missed a hundred opportunities to help Tony, to show Tony that he cared… to make Tony like him.

The next time he ‘met’ Nat it would be in a timeline that he was staying in. That version of Nat would be the person Steve formed a relationship with, the ‘real’ one, the

“That’s really not your fault, and you don’t have to feel bad about it,” Tony whispered. “I’m
On the other side of the door was a much larger room, filled with rows and rows of work benches. The people sitting at them were all like the woman Steve had seen before – small, and slight, with blue tinted skin and eyes just a little too high on their faces. They were all working wearily, looking hunched and tired and thoroughly miserable, as they robotically took little handfuls of red beads from somewhere behind them, and put them in a little bowl, and ground them into dust. Two tall, muscle bound men were patrolling the room, one on the left and one on the right, walking up and down with a certain menace… like sharks circling in a tank. When Steve looked closely, he could see they both had a rifle slung over their back, and a gun on their hip.
“It feels like my fault,” he admitted sadly, subconsciously snuggling closer into Tony as he said it.
“I think, maybe, when everyone has calmed down-”

“You don’t get to pick and choose which things you do on your own, Steve,” Tony replied, coldly. Steve felt it like a kick to his chest. For a second, he was too breathless to answer.

“You’re such a child,” Steve chastised, playfully.
. And it was nothing like the nerves he had to power through at the beginning of every mission, or the queasy feeling he got before press conferences and government meetings and other things he just wanted to be over. It wasn’t that cold anxiety that still stalked him through personal conversations; it wasn’t the fear that something was about to go wrong. This was an electric, vital nervousness. A barely tempered excitement at the idea of something going

had you forgotten that story?” Tony asked with mock incredulity. “I laughed for about an hour when Steve first told me that story. I’m literally never going to let him forget it.”
He must’ve gleefully relived every moment of yesterday at least a hundred times - the moment that Tony said ‘I love you’ more than any of them.
Involuntarily, Tony looked back at the waiter, following him as he stepped down from the stage and made his way through the dining room… Past women in gauze cocktail dresses and men in lace bodysuits and the many people who had chosen to pair their tailored dinner jackets with booty shorts….
That he

And then Steve smiled at him, seemingly reassured that Tony understood what he was saying, and added,

And, oh, his hand was on the back of Steve’s neck, so tender, and loving and-
“But that doesn’t change the fact that we have to start thinking about Loki,” Tony continued, “and maybe this offer is part of that-”
Tony felt the oddest stirring of sympathy. He told himself that it was just as likely to be Nick's first awkward attempt at being polite… but he couldn’t help reading it in a frightened tone of voice.
Steve tried for a reassuring smile, but he knew it hadn’t reached his eyes. He was still being dragged back into those rapidly unfolding thoughts…
Steve still felt like a pledge of fidelity was something for him to make, rather than for him to negotiate with Tony. It still felt weird, that they were supposed to have a discussion,

That this might all be the result of the inhibited intoxication that was still flowing through him… A feeling that had only grown stronger since Steve had turned up, increasing at about the same rate as Tony was losing himself. Scientifically speaking, it was highly likely that Tony was under the influence of something right now, that his choices and thought processes were all being influenced by that…
But –
However, much to his own surprise, Tony had found he rather liked it. Which wasn’t to say that he wanted to do it for any

that he should have to deal with this, that he’d be pushed into giving bad responses when he’d never consented to being asked.
He flopped out into his bed with a dramatic sigh, and then laughed at his own ridiculousness. He was well aware of the high he was drifting through, and even aware that it was unusual and unlike him and possibly outright weird - but he was still too soaked through with it to care. Right now, everything in his life seemed to have fallen into some magical, perfect balance-
The computer said something else, something being initiated… it just bounced off of the outside of Steve’s head.

He knew something was

“Um, okay, sure,” Tony nodded. “Someone should probably get up there, anyway…” And then Tony rolled over him, to reach for his clothes… and really, it was just the feeling of Tony’s skin on his again. A physical jolt, that pushed Steve into blurting out,
“I am,” Nick confirmed, and handed him another manila folder. Steve frowned as he took it.
“Gosh, Steve, this is all just so much…” He mocked, without malice. Steve grinned.
“Oh, well, I uh… said I’d call, when… everything was done,” Steve explained, nervously. “So…”
All those nights he’d spent imagining how uncomfortable and nervous Steve must be, asking himself if Steve was cold or hungry or hurt…
When they finally landed in New York, Steve spared the most fleeting observation that he was probably supposed to check in with Fury - with absolutely zero intention of acting on it, of course.
“You thought Nat was beautiful, the first time you met her” Steve interjected, in a superior tone-
Somewhere, he already knew it was sad to get all excited because he got to play human for a moment. All the things that he thought would be fun became uncomfortable, when there was nowhere for him to go with them.
“Tony…”
“Would you like to try some terrible food done really well?”
Even then, somewhere, he knew…
“...And I
Steve swung around as he said it - turning just in time to see Tony’s carefree expression freeze in shock at Steve’s outburst.
“But?” Steve guessed.
“Really?” Tony interjected sceptically.
“And you don’t think I wanted to?” Steve demanded.
And suddenly, Steve’s mouth was dry again.
“Why?” Steve’s voice was warm, and heavy.

“And you deserve this…” Tony whispered - delighting in the awed gasp he got in response.

all the thoughts running through Tony’s head…
“Well, the true answer to that question would take more time than you’re willing to spare,” The Ancient One smiled. “But, simplified down to the terms you’re thinking in - yes, I can see to the end of all live timelines. I know how things will work out for you.”
And still not enough to drown it out.
Tony literally braced himself for it – he
He tossed the pen aside and watched it roll under one of the shelving units, knowing that no one would think anything of a stray pen even if they were to find it, frostbitten and useless, in a few years time.
When he first found out that SHIELD had been infiltrated by Hydra, that his bosses and colleagues and
“Yeah,” Tony nodded, shyly. “Yeah, I’ll call you. And… I’ll find some way to see you again, and we can talk some more…”
But now, having contemplated every possible approach to Soviet military history and quasi-organic biology and complex neurological theory, Tony was forced to conclude that he had run out of diversions. There was nothing left to distract him from the aching fatigue in his back or the dull pounding of his head…
He pushed into Steve so easily. A comfortable friction rolled languidly along Steve’s back, a snug feeling of contentment swelling in him as Tony filled him up. It felt
God, the sounds Steve was making-
He wasn’t sure whether one of the winter soldiers had actually taken a shot at him, or if maybe he’d just slotted that into the narrative… But he could very clearly remember the fierce look that had flashed up in Steve’s eyes. The way he seemed slow into his temper, as though he was gathering the power of it into the centre of his chest.
And with that, Tony let out another howl of laughter, once again losing his footing and disappearing from view.
Steve was sure that Tony
Or, go out there and
People looked up at them.

“Yeah, okay, I’ll see what I can.. Yeah, okay,” he nodded -
And it wasn’t until he was pulling his t-shirt over his head that it dawned on him…
… I think the Varians have given the humans a truth serum, and they’re trying to turn it into some sort of… relaxation… drug, or something…” Tony trailed off momentarily, wondering if
But then he got to an expensive looking envelope, with an
“I don’t remember” Steve answered automatically – getting vaguely distracted by his slowly developing enlightenment… “I don’t know if I even looked at his, actually.”
He actually preferred the idea of being sober, and nervous, and awkward when Steve arrived… it felt more real. It felt more like getting to do it as himself.
But, back to the point,

At least, he did immediately think of Natasha, and the heartbroken panic of her final moments, and the sheer scale of her sacrifice.
He could so easily

Groaning petulantly, Steve threw himself into his bed again, for what would probably be another twenty minutes of irritably staring at the ceiling, before the tension got the better of him and he started to pace again…
Steve closed that voice down with an irritated huff, already stretching out his shoulders again.
And he didn’t actually
Steve had spent the last few nights trying to find a photograph of Tony Stark. He knew there wouldn’t be any after 1992, and he’d heard that Stark Industries had been

All resistance, all pressure, all pain. All that frustration and longing and disappointment… just gone.
“...And then I started wondering if they’d bugged my house,” Tony carried on explaining himself - which only added to Steve’s heartbreak over the whole thing. “And then I started wondering if they were following me, and then I started thinking that maybe they bugged

As much as I like to build suspense towards the end of every chapter, I also appreciate that MCD is a major tag for a reason, and a topic that makes a lot of people uncomfortable. So, rather than having anyone being anxious that I've woefully mistagged or something, I'd rather just let you know in advance - none of the major characters die.
This fic now includes some truly incredible art by Snowzapped, which is featured in Chapter 5 - if you haven't seen it yet, I fully recommend you check it out. It's amazing.
Steve laughed again. He wasn’t sure what else to do with this revelation.
So that was… Okay.
If he really was about to be violated in such an awful, personal way, by people who didn’t even

But not why he wasn’t panicking about it yet.
And yes, of course - that would obviously hurt Thor’s feelings, and Steve would hate that. He would never have admitted to Thor that he’d used Asgard as an emotional pitstop… And that in itself suggested there was something unethical about it.
It still wasn’t anything like the mental break he’d had the night Obie bit him, when Tony found himself screaming words that hadn’t gone via his head. It wasn’t like the day that he’d finally snapped and kicked Obie out of the house forever, his head entirely numb even as he was throwing things at the doorframe. Both of those times, Tony had essentially stepped outside of his own body, into a dizzying, terrifying freefall of pure feeling-
Steve began to feel the difference as they reached the top of the stairs.
Tony immediately went to unfasten Steve’s jeans, his movement blunt and clumsy. Then he curled his fingers over Steve’s waistband, jerking his pants and underwear down over his hips in one rough tug. Steve had to break the kiss so that he could shuffle his way free of his clothes, Tony grabbing at him the whole time. And then Tony let his hand stroke over Steve’s stomach, revelling in how smooth and warm and

Tony saw Steve set his jaw.
Nat’s sentence was cut short with a startled gasp, as the repulsor blast lit up the air around them. The wall exploded into dust, leaving a clean, round gap.
“He did?”
His first attempts to say something were completely swallowed up by a grief-stricken, heart-felt sob, his shoulders shaking with the effort of it, his whole body pressed down under the weight of it…

He just
he had his own answer to it, still, it made him flinch.
He would deal with everything else when he woke up.
There were a handful of moments in Tony’s life that he knew he’d remember forever. Moments that defined a place and a time and a feeling, moments that perfectly symbolised an idea bigger than themselves...
From Steve’s perspective it had only been ten years since the war, and five whole years since the first snap. Steve’s body was a hundred years old, and it was forty years old. Steve’s mind felt ancient and weary, and it felt vulnerable and clueless and new, all at once.
“The thing is…” Tony began, sounding a little strained now. “I don’t want to hurt you.”
There was only that awful, urgent knowledge that Steve was about to hurt himself-
Rolling though his body, like a caress…
And, on top of all that, there was the growing recognition of just how worried he was about Tony. All the things he’d heard for the first time last night, that just seemed to get worse and worse, the longer they had to settle in his head. All the things he didn’t know… all the new concerns that had started to occur to him-
And, before Steve woke up, Tony had been considering a whole range of possibilities. Steve was a very different person to him, after all. Maybe he would feel entirely different to how Tony would feel… It wouldn’t be the first time they’d had completely different reactions to the same thing.  So, Tony
And he

say it.
“Oh Steve, I love you,” he gasped, just because he liked saying it. He felt Steve’s lips brush over his skin when he whispered Tony’s name, dragging his palms over Tony’s sides as he moved lower down Tony’s body. He ran the flat of his tongue over Tony’s nipple, sparking an electric shock that ran through his ribs, leaving a trail of fizzing sensitivity in his wake. Whimpering, Tony made a subconscious attempt to wriggle further up the bed, lifting his hips as Steve slowly worked his way down over Tony’s stomach. His fingers threaded roughly though Steve’s hair, tugging at it – eliciting a needy little moan that Tony took a special note of-

“Oh I,
“Greetings, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS welcomed him after the fact. But Steve was still staring at the unguarded entrance to Tony’s lab.
The tightening in his chest was starting to get obstructive. His vision was blurring at the edges-
And it turned out, that was as much as he needed to remember. Steve followed that basic instruction, and watched the tiny little device come alive and melt into shape, pouring itself into one of the USB ports until it filled it almost invisibly.
to, Sir?”
He glanced down at Steve again and found that he was every bit as wrecked as Tony felt, still gulping for air, his face flushed and sweaty and streaked with tears - and lit up with pure, unashamed joy…
But then he got as far as really thinking about it.
Instead he just nodded, allowing himself one final look at Tony Stark before he left.
“I really hope Zan has been distracted by something” Tony murmured eventually, his voice almost slurring, it was so warm and soft and happy. And Steve smiled into his hair, and hummed an agreement…
conversation was complicated, really. It was hard to find the words for, and a bit awkward in places… but still, it was nice. He wasn’t uncomfortable, talking like this…
Tony gave another yelp of surprise, which this time softened into a contented hum as Steve’s lips settled against his skin. He let his body melt closer into Steve, shifting his weight and lifting his head so that Steve could trail kisses down along his throat.
Why thinking about this in a minute would be any better than thinking about it now. What good could come of distancing himself from it or rationalising it or rewriting it…
“God, you are glorious like this,” Tony observed, honestly. He rolled his palm again, quicker and harsher this time, and again, and again, just

Even without his fears that he’d put his foot in it or gone too far or said the wrong thing… he knew he’d just said

How many daydreams he had, that could only happen if it was just the two of them.
Bucky’s eyes widened in an amused sort of intrigue – but he didn’t question it. Of course he didn’t. He just smiled,
To recall the flash of claret red that he’d just seen… to wonder what it was…
“Yeah…” Tony agreed, “And hungry, and my back hurts. And my eyes hurt…”
If nothing else, it was nice to think of Tony being relaxed in his company.
Tony swallowed. He unclenched his fists. He fought the threat of trembling, as he finally turned around.

And Steve knew, even then, that this would be… different, to how it usually was.

Perhaps the two nights spent hiding in their suite had acted as a sort of buffer. Perhaps it was just that he’d been too concerned with his own fucked up sex life (or lack thereof) to think about what anyone else was doing. But somehow, Steve still managed to be shocked when they walked into Maribelle’s party and there was a woman casually sucking her boyfriend off at the bar. As you do.

“I said-” But Steve was cut off as people began to pack in at all sides, jostling the two of them through an arch way, and into yet another building.

Steve’s entire body tensed with a static electric excitement, strong enough to push him onto his feet.

“I’m sorry you had to watch Bucky die. I’m sorry you had to make that horrible choice to crash that plane, to say goodbye to Peggy – for how frightened and sad you must have been,” Tony said softly – like he

Like there was just too much blood pumping through him,
And then, eventually, Steve recognised that there was come in his hair.

And then there was the giddy little dip in the pit of Tony’s stomach, as Steve dropped to lay him out on the mattress and crawled over the top of him. When he looked down at Tony it was with a feral sort of hunger, something primal, and superior, all at once. Tony felt his shoulders soften under the heat of it, his limbs falling open and his head tilting up again-
Somewhere, Tony already knew there was another word for that. There must be. He could feel it so clearly, so distinct from everything else in the world… Whatever Steve was to him now, whatever bond they shared - there was a name for it. Steve was... something more than a partner or a provider or a protector… something that no one else on Earth would understand. But Tony knew it.
And Tony just… followed.
, the reaction is this. When the water’s only 25%, people react like that – do you see what I mean?

He let his head fall back, arcing up against Tony’s hand as he ran it slowly up along the centre of Steve’s chest, sliding beneath the robe to caress the warm skin beneath-

…He didn’t even remember thinking that.
“I’m glad I could help,” Tony told him, sincerely.
And then Tony
But he
“Tony-”
Steve’s shoulders sagged in relief. He didn’t really know what he’d been scared of seeing - but, whatever it was, it was the opposite of a page of neatly ordered test results...
Steve could feel Tony’s cock, pressed hard against his hip. He could feel that intention coiling in Tony’s muscles. And then Tony moved against him, sending a low friction shivering up his back.
And his blush deepened slightly, and his body language became more self-conscious
“Why shouldn't he be?” Wanda piped up - which did,
“Well, no – I just don’t know how to say any of this yet,” Tony clarified. “And I will think about it, and figure this out, and do this better, I promise. But, what I mean right now is…”
“They’ll find you,” Steve shouted, desperately – already knowing it wouldn’t work. That Stape couldn’t even hear him anymore.
He could tell from the way the CEOs eyes had widened, the way the politico was glancing around for an excuse to shuffle away-
There was a harmless resistance to leaving his comfortable haze - but no resistance to the world he was coming back into.
Steve was already smiling when he opened the door - a smile that softened somewhat, when he saw the state Tony was in.
And Tony’s smile warmed, his eyes still alive and amused and fixed right on Steve.

speaking… Stark hadn’t bothered with any of the thousands of people who’d begged for his help in the last twenty years… And Steve wasn’t judging that. He wasn’t. He just had to keep in mind that Stark hadn’t done anything to justify this level of obsession. That, as important and generous as Stark’s help was, it didn’t make him any better than a lot of people Steve knew. That there was no reason to think they’d get on, if they did spend time together…
And God, Steve felt awful for feeling good about that.

Steve twitched again, sharper this time. The hunger was so much more vivid, so much more painful, now that he’d had that little taste of it-

Steve looked at Tony.
And then Tony bounded down the stairs to meet him, and threw his arms around Steve’s neck, and let Steve guide him up into a warm, unhurried kiss…
He didn’t fit into the boxes he’d been assigned.
From his spot at the edge of the huge infinity pool, Steve could watch the sun setting over the ocean, staining the sky and the water with a thousand shades of candy orange and pink... If he were to swim over to the other end of the pool, he would be able to look down over miles of unspoiled white sand, dotted with the lush green of palm trees.

And then there was the briefest flash of something like panic – like he might literally be consumed by this feeling, overwhelmed by it, carried away on it so far and so fast that he’d never find his way back-
“Good. So you should be.”
“Yeah, see you Tuesday,” Tony answered on autopilot, watching quietly as the doors slid shut behind him.
The all-important life choices that held it all together. The reality in between.
“Seems like a lot of risk, for an interesting conversation” Tony muttered.
He just
“I’d tell you to drink water, but the water here is full of drugs” Tony joked, weakly. “And apparently the alcohol here is hangover free anyway, so…” But Steve had just stopped, a few feet from the bedroom door… and Tony could see him thinking … “Are you okay?”
“Why not?”
He remembered how it felt to have more anger than he had strength to act on it. To be filled with such outraged disgust at some injustice or cruelty, and have no outlet for it. To already know, as he was clenching his fist, that he

Tony decided to go and change his shirt before they left for the evening – mainly as an excuse to get out of Steve’s way for a few minutes.
Belatedly, Tony realised that his chest hurt. That his breaths had been coming shallower and shallower, until there just wasn’t enough air-
But by the time he’d worked out how to turn around, she was gone.

He looked over to see if Tony was listening to him – his best guess was that Tony was trying very hard to…

And then he walked over to the couch, and took a seat, and looked up at Tony though his eyelashes-
“No, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t just…” Steve started, and seemed to lose himself in the middle of it – obviously so much more interested in something else.
He loved that Steve wanted him.

And Steve didn’t know what about it was so endearing, exactly. Maybe it was simply that it was so very
A fizzing confusion began to rub through the fog in Steve’s mind. He began actively searching for some sense in what Bucky was saying, trying to form the questions that would help him work out what the hell Bucky was getting at-
Most of the furniture had been taken away, leaving an abundance of space in the middle of the room that was entirely covered by blankets. Layers and layers of them, in every possible colour and texture, covering every inch of the floor. The couch had been pushed back against the far wall and draped with white cotton sheets. Standing next to it was a little wooden cabinet, the top of which was littered with items that Steve couldn’t make out from here – but he could guess.
...He wasn’t expecting that.
The heat of him
And Tony thought he’d have known Steve was lying right now – at the very least, he’d have known he was uncomfortable saying this. But Zan didn’t. Unless Zan was a better actor than even Natasha, Zan believed him… Which, Tony realised, didn’t really have anything to do with how good a liar Steve was… As long as he was basically
And Steve knew he should look up at whatever had snagged Tony’s attention - but he just couldn’t look away. Tony was

Tony’s mind stirred very slowly.
And then he saw that tiny pearl of perfect, crimson blood roll over the curve of Steve’s fingers… He could feel Steve watching him watch. Tony’s mouth watered in anticipation, his teeth burning almost pleasantly in his jaw, his gaze drawn to the vein throbbing just under the surface of Steve’s skin. He could feel Steve’s heart beating in his own chest.
for that high, a physical ache, a primal urge to feel his teeth sinking into Steve’s skin.
,” Tony begged, grabbing roughly at Steve’s shoulders, trying to pull himself into Steve’s lips. Steve moaned, his hips bucking upwards as he sucked hard against Tony’s skin-
It was only as he was saying it that Steve started to think about all the work that had gone into this plan - how many sleepless nights and personal sacrifices had come good...
Tony took a little breath and dropped his arm, telling himself to get a grip.
I like Tony-”
“You should shower.”

That felt… important.
But, with a lot of careful thought, he finally took that step, and came to a heavy stop just behind him. Tony started talking before he even turned around.
“Oh, thanks…” he yawned, thinking about the question as he answered.
3) Tony makes mention in this chapter that he thinks Adam might be mentally ill. He does not say this in a derogatory way, but just to reassure you, this is not going to be the full discussion of this point, and it's not going to be given as Adam's whole motivation (I'm really not a fan of the whole 'X has a mental illness, we can tell because they behave unconventionally, that explains everything!' trope... and it was only when I realised where the chapter break was going to be that I thought maybe it would raise concerns like that... anyway, having already over explained too much, the point is that it's not going that way.)
But not in time to stop Tony from leaping up and grabbing his legs, pulling Steve in after him.
...There was no harm in acknowledging that.
For the time being, Tony had completely forgotten the project that had so consumed him - vaguely aware that JARVIS was working on it and happy to leave it at that. Right now, he was perfectly content to bathe in the strength of Steve’s body, and the kindness in all of his teasing little touches, and the way he shivered as Tony traced idle patterns on his chest...
“Yeah…” Steve exhaled, dropping his eyes as he tried to think of how to put it all into words.
good Steve,” Tony breathed, his voice low and jagged. “You’ve been so good for me, I’m so proud of you…” And he looped one arm under Steve’s chest, lifting him back onto his knees as though he were weightless. Steve collapsed into him, trusting Tony to keep him upright, already tilting his chin up, baring his throat.
Begrudgingly, Steve turned and picked up the offending scrap of paper - not actually expecting to find any further details. He was already thinking ahead, wondering how he was going to explain what a Mortal Blessing was when he didn’t really know himself-
And he

…That there was
…And he was talking in a different tone now. An interested, animated tone… Not friendly, but not exactly unfriendly either. Not the warm voice he’d once used, when he raced to share some new theory with Steve – but not the cool, closed off voice he’d been using since Thanos. The same voice he might’ve used in an SI meeting, or in front of a group of MIT students.
Steve let go of a surprised little giggle, as everything just sort of fell into place in his head.

“Every year, Bulsara honours the greatest heroes of the galaxies at a grand festival. The celebrations last four full days, and feature the greatest spectacle and sensory experience anywhere in reality. Billions of people compete to get a ticket - and, this year,” he paused for dramatic effect, almost hovering with excitement, “the grand council has selected the Avengers to be our guests of honour.”
He thought of

“It’s okay, it’s going to be okay…” Tony assured, taking a confident step forward, screwdriver already in hand. He popped another panel free, and dropped his head to look at it. The examination table shook as Bucky’s metal arm crashed into the side of it, flailing against Steve’s restraint. “It’s alright, two seconds, we got this…” Tony murmured, his eyes sharply determined as he twisted the screwdriver

“What’s this?” Tony asked, taking it, gingerly
Tony would’ve liked to ask why they ever needed to so bluntly dissect his personality - what even gave them the right - if he was obviously capable of fixing their mess regardless.
And then, he said goodbye.
Bucky had been almost as excited as Steve was by this latest turn of events.
He might not have the

have thought, if he hadn’t fallen in love with Tony Stark. What he might’ve been thinking about, if he hadn’t been thinking about… things he could never tell Tony when he asked, anyway. Steve could never even talk to Tony as a friend, because he could never work out how to act as though that was all he wanted. It meant every conversation was never quite natural, that there was so much of himself he had to hide even as he was trying to be open. It meant there were so many things he couldn’t quite explain…
Steve allowed himself to grin, thinking of all the mysteries that his younger self would unravel with the help of his friends - thinking that, however many weird and wonderful possibilities he considered, he would never come up with something as strange as the real explanation.
“Come here.” Steve whispered, sliding down off of the couch so that he could put his arms around him, letting Tony rest his weight against his chest. Indulging in the closeness of him, for a few moments. “How much more do you have to do?” He asked, nodding at the experiments.

He did feel a bit better for this, too.
The pain of this was so sharp that it pushed through into total, mindless bliss.
It was only now that Steve realised just how much he

as the doors unlocked. Steve put his ear to the wood and strained to listen. Then he opened the door a crack, to check. And then he looked at Tony. Tony nodded.
A flare of heat scorched up Steve’s back and then consumed him, pulling his skin tighter, tensing his muscles into this compulsive feeling-
he still hurt by Steve’s behaviour in the last seven years – wherever it had come from?
He suddenly
He had finally become everything he’d always hated. Or, maybe he’d always been like this, and he’d simply been in denial… whatever. The point was, there was no running from it anymore. He was every bit as warped as all the vampire fetishists he loathed; he was every bit the bloodthirsty monster than the fairy tales made him out to be. He had literally come all over his own hand, at the very thought of Steve wanting Tony to bite him. There was no going lower than that, no coming back from it, nothing more to say.
“Well… At least I feel better about the rest of the plan” Tony suggested, scanning his screen one last time before he put the file reader back into his pocket. And he glanced up at Steve, and Steve smiled at him.
“Since I came up here you mean? Yeah, a bit” Steve answered – talking too quickly.

By now, Tony had his face buried in his hands, laughing so hard that his shoulders were shaking… And Steve felt a fit of giggles growing under his words, just at how
Okay, so he still hadn’t acknowledged that he apparently had several very vivid fantasies about biting Tony, buried somewhere in his subconscious. Put simply, he just wasn’t ready to go there yet.

He watched as Bucky gingerly lifted the makeshift bandage. And then he felt Steve just dissolve in relief beside him, as they both recognised-
He heard the sound of the explosion bouncing off the walls around him, echoing back on itself.
So, Tony had sent Pepper a half-assed lie about having bumped into a hot blonde in the lobby, simply because it seemed like an excuse she wouldn’t risk checking on. And then he’d poured himself a scotch, and resigned himself to toasting the New Year alone in the dark-
“And I notice, you’re both much better, for being here.” Adam added, matter-of-factly.
Tony’s hand reached out for one of the bags – jolting briefly at the shock, as he felt it moving under his palm.

Steve threw his head back and laughed at that, taken in by the delivery and taken by surprise.
That low throb of adrenaline spiked up along his back, same as it always did when he saw Tony. Fight or flight – Steve didn’t know which.

And then at last, he carried on.
A few images flashed through Tony’s head, like the flickering end reels of his father’s old home movies. Random moments from all the other parties they’d had at the Tower. Clint singing a Bryan Adams song into an upturned bottle at Steve’s birthday party. Nat and Sam doing shots at last years New Years Eve party.
He didn’t even know who he was jealous of – Tony, for having that easy charm, or the women he was talking to… Because Tony was smiling at them.

Steve gripped himself tighter, working himself off in shorter, sharper motions, but every sensation simply frustrated the need he was trying to sate-
” Steve’s voice was so dark, so unashamedly needy. Tony flinched at the sound of it, feeling every nerve light up as he felt Steve move inside him.
Except that his eyes happened to catch on one of the items on his desk - a scrap of paper, yellowed with age, that had been hidden in the middle of one of the unsteady piles of correspondence, until Tony’s sudden movement sent it sliding into view…
And Steve had worked out that Tony was trying to stall. That he was trying to throw Adam off. That he was building to something more than this one point…
“You are just… So clever.” Steve sighed, with a smile. “At everything. Including defending yourself from a world that’s always treated you unfairly, and held you to a different standard – and abused your trust, over and over again. And it’s like… No one ever says a nice thing about you without an ulterior motive, so you don’t trust those things, and you’ve learned to deflect them
And then there were the meetings with Ross - Tony was
“I’m not saying all of this is right, or fair, I’m just trying to explain-”

“Oh God yes please Tony yes,” Steve barked, trying to jerk back against him, his eyes stinging and his mouth suddenly dry. He let out an especially undignified howl of protest as Tony pulled away from him completely, which broke down into a pleading whimpering, as one second without contact became two, and then three…

And then the doors of his private elevator slid open.

that every one of those seemingly small operations had ramifications for the wider plan, that every interaction was a potential benefit or a chance to get caught out - that’s why he hadn’t thought about it.

In the end, this mission that they’d spent so long thinking about and worrying over had probably taken less than five minutes, start to finish.
A roar of laughter burst out of Tony’s chest, taking them both by surprise.
He tried to fight the fears of what might happen, the nightmare mental images and the unanswerable questions about how bad it would feel. He knew that sitting here panicking about the outcome would only make it more likely – it would stop him thinking clearly, eat into the time he could have used to think of other things-

Tony stroked his hands over Steve’s back, revelling in the shape of him, rocking very gently against his lap. Steve’s breath hitched, and then broke into an urgent whimper that Tony instantly wanted more of. He brought his hands to Steve’s chest again, pushing against him very gently, silently urging,

Steve and Bucky were sitting in the breakroom, sharing a few moments of comfortable silence as they cooled down from the morning workout. Bucky was lounging in the easy chair – the one he and Sam were engaged in permanent warfare over – indolently flicking through his phone. Steve was lying flat out on one of the couches, staring up at the ceiling…
“I think…” Tony purred, as he slowly ran his eyes over Steve’s chest, “...That you should open the rest of your gifts in the bedroom.”
Not that Steve had got much of a look… But it was enough to know that Stark was wearing a black shirt, and that his eyes really
He followed Steve’s movements as though they’d rehearsed this a thousand times, as though every part of this was already carved into his muscle memory, into his most basic assumptions. He pushed his weight up onto his knees, and parted his legs, and lowered his head…

He broke the kiss by accident, throwing his head back and gulping for air. And Tony just smiled at him for a second… and then glanced above Steve’s head, to where his hands were pinned… and then met Steve’s eye again, one eyebrow raised.
“Hangover free alcohol?” He clarified.

They both knew this would be their best chance to get out of the building.
Steve was driving himself mad with the repetition of it, but every attempt he’d made to stop himself had proven even more stressful. Without that, it was just the endless cycle of ever more horrible thoughts.
“Where’d they go?” Steve asked, as Rhodey looked around them in a casual way.

It was like the first lie in after a busy week, like finally falling into a favourite armchair after the long walk home… Like finding his natural resting position, after so many years bracing his shoulders. Every inch of him tingled with perfect, satisfied relief.

And it helped that he was finally starting to believe in the happy ending of this story - that he
Tony’s brow pinched into a frown. The strangest thoughts cropped up, randomly, in his head,
Tony made it back to his own house just as the outdoor lighting flickered into life. Automatically, his brain supplied the mundane little detail that it must therefore be 6pm…
But more than that, it was the overwhelming freedom of being able to say it back. Being safe enough, and sure enough, that he could just let it fall out of his mouth-
“That’s him.”
“What’re these?” Steve squinted at them.
“I can’t,” he whispered, delighted. And Tony smiled.

And then he looked to the door,
Unfortunately, none of that helped when it was boring.
Tony found himself literally stunned for the second time in two minutes.
A static charge started to build on the surface of Steve’s skin, his lungs burning as the air around him thinned.
“So, how did you find out about this place?” He asked, casually.
He didn’t remember thinking about that at all. He didn’t remember preparing himself, or deciding he was ready…
“You remember, when he first agreed to see you, and he was
Which meant Tony would have to wait a few minutes for the effects to take hold and level out. There was just no other way.
The part of him that knew, one day soon, this whole thing would be over… and he’d never see Tony again.
Thank you again for reading!
He thought of
And then Tony picked it up again, and closed his hand around it, hiding it from view.
Steve had spent the last few weeks over-thinking everything that had

“Well, there was this guy, with this really tiny lute, and he just kept hovering around Steve like a fly, and not really

And Tony
But that’d been too complicated. So he’d just followed Tony into the unknown, and spent the last few hours hoping that maybe they were just on the other side of the planet – that maybe they
“Would you believe me if I told you that I’d been on worse dates?” Steve managed to joke – whispering too, for some reason.
There had been a whole range of…
…Like he already knew how this worked, just the same as Tony did.
“I dunno, because they used to work for Thanos?” He suggested, sounding weary “Because they’re actually Loki in disguise, because it’ll turn out later that she blames us for the death of her mother and this is all part of a plot for revenge… because they work for whoever’s running this place, because someone here is keeping an eye on us… probably would’ve made more sense… than those other suggestions…” He trailed off, defeated.
Jesus, this was terrifying.
Tony kissed him again, still trying to encourage Steve to a more urgent pace-
And, sure enough – just like Tony said – after a while, she seemed to run out of words. Eventually, she just looked up at him, her whole body still alive with a desire, a
In all the time he’d been nursing this fantasy, throughout all the guises it had taken, Tony had never really considered that it would mean him
And, yes, there was still that dark voice in his head. The one that whispered that everything had changed, that there were new and more terrible anxieties to concern himself with, that it wasn’t about his trivial worries of being made vulnerable or getting his friends hurt. Not anymore. A creeping, cold feeling, somewhere under his skin, trying to warn him that he had to
Tony could hear Steve talking to Bucky, like it was echoing from miles away.
“Wait,” Nat implored. “Please.”
He had far more important things to focus on, better uses of every second of his time – quite enough to be upset and worried about at the moment, without getting distracted by this silly little keepsake.
Before long, they’d walked beyond the last of the stalls and stages, past the most reclusive of the picnickers, into a sandy landscape of empty shrub land. The grass beneath their feet yellowed and thinned, as they walked beyond the limits of what was worth maintaining…
And he wished he hadn’t thought of the word.
Oh, everything felt…
Every inch of his body clenched in panicked urgency, his hands grabbing for Tony’s shoulders in a physical, almost frightened impulse to

“So, there was a night that we spent in a basement, under a warehouse in Chicago, in like 2012, I think? That was about the most wonderful night of my life.” Tony said, taking his hand back subtly –
That Tony would’ve thought…
Tony sighed, heavily. Of course, he knew that would be her answer. Right now, he could see and process every detail, he could immediately understand the person Pepper was and the relationship they had-

“You liked the chains.” He whispered – not a question. And God, he actually saw the way Steve’s eyes darkened, he saw the way his breath shocked still in his chest. The way he swallowed softly before he answered, so quietly that Tony barely heard him,

All the background reading he’d done about Bucky, about the history of Hydra and their work… and their various bases…
“You did?” Steve frowned, suddenly confused - obviously baffled as to why that would be a bad thing… “How?”

“No, I don’t,” Steve agreed on a downward breath.
“But they
“How come?”
“...I always wanted to tell you how...
“So - whatever is or isn’t going to happen with Loki, and Ultron, and Thanos, and any other alien or impossible threats that’ve slipped my mind - none of that is going to happen for a few months, at least?”
So, he arranged his features into a professional expression, as he strolled across the echoey basement and through the workings of Operation PEGASUS. He pretended to be politely interested in the set-up, while he scanned for access ports and familiar faces and - as always - his nearest exits and potential weapons.
“Oh my God, it does!” Sam exclaimed joyfully. Steve let go of a pointed sigh.
Steve sighed again, more frustrated this time.
Tony felt as though he knew so many things, now.
…five, six, seven…
Oh, he felt very tired, all of a sudden…
“Sir, I’m afraid he’s insisting.”
“No, I’m sorry, it’s okay” Tony assured him, his voice softer now. “It’s good, you

And his best plan was to do it in the most intimidating way possible. Tony could be reasonably sure that these people would scare easily… That, faced with something genuinely

He shook his head more violently, deliberately looking away from the page.
Steve felt his thoughts abandon him completely, his breaths moving higher in his chest and his heart beating hard against his ribs, as he tried to take Tony in. Tony’s eyes blown so wide they were almost black, his lips parted in an open hunger.
Perhaps, when he got to thinking about it, Tony would judge Steve for this, or decide that he wasn’t a very nice person because of it… But he would never take it personally.

Eyes burning, he took a quick glance around the workshop. There were unsteady piles of papers stacked on every surface, upturned boxes thrown at random across the floor, holographic displays full of nonsensical observations layered ten deep on every wall-
- and I realise now that you were all wrong to help me,” he announced-
Steve shoved the phone back into his pocket with a bit too much force, screwed his eyes shut, and told himself not to think about it. He curled his hands into fists, digging his fingernails hard into his palms-
All of this had run through Tony’s brain so quickly that he was still able to answer on the second ring.
Oh, and he was shouting now too…
Tony just allowed it to happen. He let it carry him forward, all the way into Steve’s arms-
By now Tony had reached the curve of his waist. Much to Steve’s immediate dismay, he shifted even further back, kneeling between Steve’s legs so that he could finish opening his robe. A wave of cool air rolled over Steve’s skin, burning over the wet patches on his stomach. Steve gasped, and bucked up against nothing-

And then Tony fired the gauntlet, deliberately aiming a foot to the left of her, blowing a hole through to what he knew was an empty stairwell. The guard shrieked, throwing her gun aside as she flinched away from the noise. She looked up at Tony, wet eyed and open mouthed, and Tony made sure to fix her with a dark stare before he barked at her,
Tony thought frantically – they had to
Tony felt Steve suddenly stiffen, and stand up straighter. When he turned to look, he saw that Steve was glancing back toward the doors, his brow creased in concentration. And then Steve turned back, and realised that Tony was looking at him, and before Tony could ask, he said,

Maybe that’s why he had picked up on Steve being protective of him-

At first, Tony was too excited about the new lead to really think about what it was…

“...And he said it back,” Tony tried for a nonchalant shrug, but he was still smiling too much.

...And, out of nowhere, Tony heard himself think,
“Okay, that’s it. I’m going to bed,” he snapped out loud, standing up and slamming his hands down on the desk to punctate his point.
“Hey JARVIS?” He called, casually, his eyes still fixed on the elevator.
But he couldn’t help it if the initial emotional reaction was just a horrible fear that he’d ruined things between them-

.” He said instead, pointedly leaving it there, before he changed the subject completely.
It was getting harder and harder to silence that little voice each time - but that didn’t mean Steve wasn’t still trying.
“No, I’m fine,” Tony hissed, once he’d checked that he hadn’t knocked the Bunsen burner over in his panic.
“And I’ll try to put as much time aside for this as I can, without tipping anyone off,” he hurried on, before Steve could say anything personal. And then he remembered, “oh, and speaking of tipping people off - Agent

choice wasn’t about his commitment to Steve.
He didn’t know how long, trying to think of how bad the worst-case scenario could possibly be – and really, what was the point of that?
“Oh, yeah, Bucky said something like that,” Steve mumbled, painfully aware of how uncomfortable this was-
“So, we meet him together, and tell him that
“I’m s-s-sorry,” he hissed, under his ragged breathing.
He thought, idly, that this might be easier if he

Nick stopped to allow the room to settle into a more sober atmosphere. Steve noticed Tony put his phone away.
Steve still didn’t allow himself to think about that. He’d come too far to tempt fate by celebrating early. He didn’t even let himself acknowledge that it was probably the
“Please, I need you to listen to me, literally everyone in this building is in danger right now.” And then, as the colour was draining from her face, he added. “And I promise, everything is going to be alright, but I need you to do exactly as I say right now, okay?”
Again, it was mostly surprise - because that just wasn’t the sort of joke that Steve made.
In the meantime, Tony took a second to scan their surroundings. Much to his surprise, he found that the driveway was now entirely deserted. He very cautiously counted that as a positive. Of course, he couldn’t be certain that no one had been watching when it actually happened... but, in his experience, when people witnessed the drama they usually stayed around to witness the aftermath too. If he was lucky, the few straggling by-standers had all gone back into the party, or off to their cars, before this little...episode.
Not that.

Without another thought
“I’m sorry,” came out as barely a whisper. Tony didn’t even know if Steve had heard it, before he gasped,
“Clint?” Steve demanded, immediately and angrily, “why Clint?”

“Thank you,” he breathed.
The taste of him, spreading over Steve’s tongue as Tony gently teased his lips further apart-
And if Steve had been capable of rational thought, he’d have been able to put that last one into context. He’d have remembered the reasons Tony had for saying that, the things they’d said to one another since then – all the reasons Tony was so very different to those other people.
Whatever their differences, he certainly didn’t want Tony to get hurt. Or Clint, obviously. Or anyone. And it seemed to him that SHIELD was being far too lax about this whole undertaking, given the people involved and the people they’d lost already. Nick was going to prep Tony for this mission with only ‘undecided agent’ listed as his back-up, and didn’t seem to have any contingencies planned for when his communication was cut off, or if he was ambushed – they didn’t even know what had happened to the previous two agents, for God sake-
