Dean laughed. “That’s Jo’s little brother, Ellen and my Uncle Bobby’s kid. He’s four.”
Castiel tried to ignore what the word ‘mouthful’ coming out of Dean’s plump, pink lips did to him and chuckled lightly. “Yes, my parents were quite… eccentric.”
Cas chuckled. “Most people would agree with you. Some people call me Cas, though.”
Dean bit his lip to keep from swearing. He was turning into a freaking girl.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas, fortunately, seemed to like being manhandled. Dean pulled him to the front, where
The sandy-haired teen grinned sheepishly. “I convinced Dani to reconsider kicking me out. She stuck to her original plan, though, after a week, when she found me making out with her sister.”
“He tells me stuff!” Dean said defensively, and Sam rolled his eyes.
Dean didn’t even try to feign ignorance. He had surmised from Castiel’s quick realization that these night-terrors had happened before. “No. I think I woke him up; at least, his eyes were open. He wasn’t seeing me though; he was looking in my direction like he was afraid for his life. But after I started talking to him, he seemed to come out of it. Once he realized what had happened, he started saying he was sorry, and I just held him, the idiot.” Dean scoffed, rolling his eyes at Gabriel’s sudden glare. “He’s an idiot because he seemed to think I’d be upset with him for what happened. But, anyway, I pulled him into my lap and started singing, and that calmed him down pretty quick. Next thing I knew, he was asleep.”
“Sammy, I’mma go piss,” Dean slurred, half-hopping half falling off of his barstool. Sam’s brow furrowed worriedly, but Dean just gave him another grin. “I’m a big boy, Sammy, I can do it myself.” He turned to wink at Jo. “Unless you wanna help me, sugar.”
, Dean thought crossly, scowling at the pair on the sofa. Castiel was arguing very animatedly about the pros and cons of
Ellen walked back behind the bar, carrying a tray with steaming food on it. “Are you two fighting already? He just got here, Jo, can’t you keep your trap shut for even a little while?” She tried to sound stern but just looked at the two fondly.
“I was hoping you would have a suggestion, since Gabriel tells me you have lived here for most of your life.”
Dean gulped, but he had to admit, at least to himself anyway, that the hand on his wrist felt sinfully good. “I, um… I mean, we didn’t…?” He faltered, unsure how to phrase his question.
“Then you come into the office last month and
Dean took a long drink of his coffee and dug around for his cell phone. Flipping it open, he sighed.
“Shh, Cas,” Dean murmured, clutching Castiel to his chest. He rubbed small circles into the small of his boyfriend’s back, pressing soft kisses into Cas’s hair. “You had a nightmare, but you’re okay baby. I’ve got you. I’ve got you.”
Cas whined as his cock sprang free, hard and leaking pre-come. “Dean,” he cried, desperate. “I need you, please.”
Sam rolled his eyes. “Don’t talk with your mouth full. And I know it’s the first day of school, jerk; otherwise, you would still be veg’d out on the couch, dreaming about your latest conquest.”
Dean put up six fingers, knocked one down for Gabriel, another for Michael, two more for the twins… “And not your sister, so…” Only one finger left. “So, it’s the quiet brother.”
“No.”
“As my girlfriend,” Sam clarified, rolling his eyes again. “I guess there’s a difference. Anyway, I’ve been working up the courage to tell you ever since then, but you’ve been pretty busy lately and I haven’t really gotten the chance. Of course, that’s awesome for me, because I could hang out with Jess without you interfering, but she was getting more annoyed that I hadn’t told you yet.”
Cas looked confused. “Wait, he isn’t…?” and Dean muttered into Gabriel’s shoulder, “M’not gay. Cas’s just a great kisser and sexy as hell.”
Jo groaned, grabbing two mugs from behind the bar and filling them to the brim. “Pick up your plates and follow me,” she instructed, sashaying along to the REO Speedwagon song that was playing.
you won’t take my amazing suggestion of just kissing the daylights out of her, we need a plan B.”
“Joanna Beth!” Ellen looked furious.
Dean snorted. “It sounds like you’ve got a crush on the guy,” he said teasingly, grinning at his little brother.
Dean rolled his eyes. “I just kinda assumed, since you hardly ever talk about him, and I got to call him something, since you won’t tell me his name. What’s with that, anyway?”
Sam closed his eyes and rubbed his temples, hoping like hell Dean wouldn’t freak out. “Jess and I have been seeing each other since May.” He glanced up at his brother’s shell-shocked expression warily. “We didn’t want to get anyone’s hopes up, because it was mostly a dare from one of Jess’s friends, and we were just playing along. But then,” Dean noticed Sam’s expression change from rueful to one of hopefulness, “we hit it off, and it wasn’t a dare anymore. So we just kept going out, and you didn’t really notice, because you do what you always do every summer – ”
“Yes, ma’am,” Dean responded sheepishly. He took Castiel’s hand, a smile gracing his lips. “Ellen, I wanted you to meet my boyfriend, Castiel Novak.” Cas’s entire body seemed to radiate happiness, that’s how hard he was smiling.
Sam nodded. “Yeah, it’s his mother’s maiden name. He got it legally changed about four months before he moved here. He used to be Dr. Gabriel Novak in Los Angeles. He was actually pretty prestigious, but at the height of his career he resigned and moved here.”
“Dude, really? What, are you twelve? She isn’t even that hot,” Sam complained, pointedly not looking at the large bulge in his brother’s jeans. He chanced a wary look at Dean’s face and said hesitantly, “So, I talked to Adam today.”
Fortunately for Dean, that was all Sam seemed to want to know. “Well, if she’s the reason you’re making breakfast again, she’s a keeper, dude.” He grinned and went back to shoveling his food into his mouth.
Jo raised an eyebrow at the touch, but didn’t comment on it. “Oh, didn’t Dean tell you? That’s why he likes his job so much, because they’re all at the same level.”
Dean paled, breathing in sharply. “I, uh..” he stumbled over his words, trying to find an explanation, but it seemed he didn’t need one.
“Not that I’m not thrilled to be getting homemade breakfast, but what the hell are you doing up at eight AM on a Saturday? Isn’t this your self-mandated day of sleeping in and generally not giving a rat’s ass? I don’t think you’ve made Saturday breakfast since my I graduated from law school,” Sam commented, eyeing his brother curiously while dosing his pancakes with a liberal amount of strawberry syrup.
*short for para-educator
Dean straightened his posture and put a serene smile on his face, going into what Sam jokingly referred to as ‘teacher mode’. As soon as the final bell rang and parents began shuffling out (most going tearfully), Dean locked eyes with Gabriel, who held up ten fingers, followed by another five.
Castiel pretended to gag as he retrieved the syrup from the cupboard. “That is disgusting, Gabriel. You really need to diversify in your eating habits. Honestly, how haven’t you developed diabetes yet?”
Sam didn’t disagree. “Plus, his family is loaded. Sorry, I took the liberty of going through this in my office today.” He blushed faintly.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Drink at the bar, pick up a different girl every night, and never come home before two, if you come home at all.” Dean’s face turned bright red, and Sam grinned, continuing. “So you didn’t notice me not being home as much. I knew you’d get all big-brothery and annoying the moment I told you, so I sort of just… didn’t.
Sam wrinkled his nose. “Don’t be gross. You know I don’t swing that way. I’m much more into curvy blondes,” he murmured dreamily, before freezing, realizing his slip-up too late.
Gabriel gave his brother a pointed look. “If Dean’s allowed to call you Cas, I can still call you Cassy.” He smirked at his baby brother’s blush, and continued. “I’m just worried for you, little bro. It isn’t going to be easy for you, so newly out and everything, to be with someone who’s still working on inching himself out from miles inside the closet. I’m serious, Cassy; I could have found Narnia in there before I found Dean. I just don’t want you to get hurt. I know Dean, and the only things he’s ever committed to is his brother and his job.” Gabriel cracked a grin and added, “And his car.”
“Damn, man, could you warn me next time you’re going to break out the sex voice? I’d like to be prepared,” Dean gibed, a grin gracing his lips. “And, yeah, I’d love to go out, Cas.”
“I’m Robbie!” The small boy announced, turning his soft brown eyes on Castiel. “This is my Uncle Dean.” Dean winced slightly when Robbie’s chubby hand ‘patted’ (Dean preferred to call it smacking) his head a few times.
that was what Cas would go with. Dean scowled; he just
Dean smiled guiltily.  “Ellen knows,” he revealed, biting his lip.
Dean sat up slowly, every movement causing his head to pound a little bit harder every time. “Fuck,” he whimpered, cradling his head in his hands.
“He’s nineteen, Sammy. Almost as old as I was when I got saddled with his scrawny ass,” Dean reminded Sam sternly. Babying Adam wouldn’t help him in the long run.
Ellen held up a hand, effectively shushing the man. She grimaced. “I don’t wanna know all the kinky stuff you two were gonna get up to. And Jo is gonna get an earful when she gets to the bar for her shift tonight, you can bet your ass. But right now, you’re in charge of my baby, Dean, and I expect you to behave like it. So, next time, save the sex for when you aren’t babysitting. Capisce?”
, but his mouth wouldn’t obey. He couldn’t do anything other than stare and let out breathy gasps as Dean unbuttoned his fly, a sexy little smirk on his lips.
Reluctantly, Castiel gripped Dean’s shoulders and pushed back. “Food first, sex later. Do you have popcorn? I want to watch a movie,” Cas decided, already scanning Dean’s DVD selection for something interesting.
Dean rolled his eyes as he got to his feet. “You’re pretty bossy for someone so unemployed,” Dean teased, pressing a light kiss to Castiel’s forehead and mussing his already-wild hair.
Sam blushed and sputtered profusely, glaring at his brother. “Shut up,” he grumbled after a few minutes. “What do you want?”
Dean hummed as he walked through the front door, smiling in a way he hadn’t for a while. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d been in this good of a mood at the end of a school day. Dean had a fresh pie waiting at home that Ellen had sent over, which made him intensely happy.
“Don’t be so nervous,” Dean said quietly, his green eyes earnest. “It’s just a date, Cas. Nothing to freak over. Just two friends having some dinner.” He winked, and Castiel thought he might start hyperventilating.
Castiel wrinkled his nose. “That is abhorrent, Gabriel,” he admonished, frowning at his older brother, who just stuck out his tongue.
run around my house naked? That privilege is reserved for me and me only.” Before Dean could do much more than open his mouth, Gabriel was already halfway down the hall. “And close the door! There are other people in this house, bucko. Don’t want to scare any innocents.”
get one
Castiel gripped tighter. “I hate waiting to see you,” he whined into Dean’s neck, and he heard the larger man chuckle.
Castiel quirked a brow, amused. “Divine?”
“Really,” Gabriel deadpanned.
Gabriel chuckled. “Cassy said good morning,” he teased, eyes sparking with mischief.
Cas allowed a fond smile at the mention of Dean’s precious Impala. They had started talking about his beloved car earlier and Dean wouldn’t shut up about it. Castiel personally thought that it was adorable. “I know what I’m doing, Gabriel,” Castiel said quietly, looking his brother in the eyes. “I’m not a child that needs his big brother to save him anymore. I appreciate it, I really do, but I don’t need it anymore.”
this man was beautiful, but before Castiel could pull the shirt up and off completely, Dean shoved him away.
Dean grinned, grabbing at Gabriel. “Hi, Gabe!” He hiccupped. “I’m kinda drunk. Can I crash here?”
“Why’s Uncle Dean all pink?” Robbie stage-whispered, and Cas raised a brow, fighting the urge to laugh. “Because he’s constipated,” Castiel replied, somehow keeping a straight face.
Dean sighed, quickly losing his good humor. His mind replayed the events of today, and he shook his head sadly. “Okay, I need a favor, but you can’t tell anyone who you’re doing this for or why. Capisce?”
that’s pretty well off,” Dean purred suggestively, pressing light kisses down Cas’s neck.
“Why do you have to question everything? Just let it be and enjoy the ride.” Dean stole a forkful of Sam’s pancakes, smacking his lips. “That strawberry’s not half-bad, Sammy, but you can’t beat good ol’ maple.”
“Do you at least have some decent tunes?” Dean made a face when Cas turned on the stereo and a pop station came on. “I can’t believe I made out with someone who listens to this trash. You’re lucky you’re sexy.” He grinned jokingly, reaching for Cas’s hand.
Dean was about to fire off another question when one of the other teachers, Mrs. Masters, interrupted. “Recess is almost finished. We should collect the children.” And although it was phrased like a suggestion, Dean knew it was an order. Mrs. Masters had the ability to make Dean’s life and career a living hell if she really wanted to, and Dean was pretty sure she just plain enjoyed having him under her thumb. It irritated him to know end, but he just forced a grin and mock saluted. “Yes, ma’am!” He stressed the ma’am enough to be insulting, but not enough for it to be obvious it was intentional. Gabriel would usually have scoffed and made fun of Dean for being so unimaginative, but today his heart really wasn’t in it, so they rounded up their class without a word between them.
“Fine, he’s a cute monster.”
Dean jerked in surprise, nearly dropping the box of popcorn he had grabbed out of the cupboard. A proud grin spread across his lips. “That’s great, baby! Where at?”
Dean sighed, tightening his grip on the smaller man and resting his chin on Cas’s shoulder. “This is a lot more fun than dinner,” he cajoled, a grin pulling at the corners of his mouth as he remembered his initial shock at Castiel straddling him, which soon turned to immense pleasure. They hadn’t moved from their spots, parked outside of Gabriel’s apartment building, for forty-five minutes.
Sammy did not disappoint. “What the hell, Dean! This took up time and favors I could have used on something else, but I did it, for you. Not to mention the websites I had to get Charlie to hack, which could get me arrested if anyone ever found out. I mean, I don’t mind doing you favors, man, but don’t make it seem important if it’s just something trivial.”
That shocked Dean out of his reverie. “What?”
Gabriel smirked. “And here I thought you already were
Dean shot his boyfriend an apologetic look. “Cas, this is Robbie, Ellen and Bobby’s son. Sorry, Cas, Jo just dropped him off with a note pinned to his t-shirt that said I was babysitting.” Dean glanced at Robbie and muttered, “Your sister is a butthead.”
“Are you Uncle Dean’s friend?”
“Hey!” Dean protested indignantly. “I’m a wonderful person to be around. Aren’t I, Cas?”
Castiel hummed appreciatively, watching Dean’s backside as he exited the apartment. From his perch on the little island, Cas could clearly see his brother’s worried expression. He groaned. “What?” He snapped exasperatedly.
Dean gave his brother an exasperated look. “It’s not that unbelievable,” he said gruffly, avoiding Sam’s gaze. Unfortunately for him, being able to look at his gargantuan of a brother in the eyes might have been helpful in aiding Dean to escape a hug from said gargantuan that nearly squeezed him to death. “Dammit, Sammy!” Dean protested, wriggling in the tight embrace like a child who was embarrassed to be seen hugging his mother.
Dean poked Gabriel’s thigh with his big toe. “Sorry, buddy,” he muttered, his face as red as a tomato, which Castiel apparently thought was the most adorable thing ever, if the soft kisses he bestowed on Dean’s skin were any indication.
“I suppose I am, yes.” Once again, Castiel locked eyes with Dean, who smirked at the smaller man.
The ‘Dean-is-straight’ thing was bothering Cas, too; why had Dean offered to ‘get out of here’? Why had Dean done anything at all in regards to Castiel, other than ask why Cas was staring? Castiel sighed, rubbing his eyes. “Well, I was watching him sing,” he explained, resigned. This was going to be a long night.
Gabe tried (and failed) to look innocent. “Fine, I won’t tell you how wild she is in the sack.” He winked as Dean grimaced. “Pre-cougars are awesome, man, you should try them sometime.”
Castiel’s eyebrows knitted together, clearly bemused. He looked at the blonde, who was clearly at least twenty, and back to Ellen and Dean. Ellen burst into laughter. “Don’t look so unsettled, boy. I had Robbie when Jo was sixteen. It’s been known to happen you know.” She fixed Cas with a stare that had him blushing, and she laughed again. “Honestly, when I got together with Bobby, we thought I was long past breeding age. But then I got pregnant, and well, we wouldn’t trade Robbie for the world.” She smiled, nodding to a picture stuck up behind the bar of a towheaded little boy with a mischievous grin.
“If you tell me what the hell is going on with you today. You’ve snapped at three kids, broke a paintbrush, and you’ve pretty much been giving death stares since you got in,” Dean replied, his eyes flickering between the kids and Gabriel’s face.
Dean gave an eye-crinkling grin. “What can I say, Samantha? Maybe I’m just happy.”
Gabe snorted. “As if. No, never Michael. He’s too proud to ask anything of anyone, even if he was dying.” Dean waited for Gabriel to share which of his brothers it had been, but after standing in relative silence for the better part of three minutes, he decided to go back to guessing.
and I was a little pissed. Jess was, too, because she was tired of being a secret, and she wanted to meet you.”
?” Sam inquired, groaning in delight as he took his first bite of strawberry-covered fluffy goodness. “Dean, you have to cook more often.”
Gabriel sighed, running a hand through his blond hair. “We’ll talk when I get back from work, okay? But I’m going to need some answers, Castiel.” He glanced at his baby brother again sadly, and then he shook his head. “Sleep, bro. I gave you some meds while you were sleeping; they’re probably going to make you pretty out of it.” He started walking towards the door again, but quickly turned and kissed his little brother’s forehead before leaving abruptly.
Dean grinned. “You got our baby cousin to do something illegal?”
Gabriel sat against the wall in the hallway, listening to his best friend croon a rock ballad to his baby brother, hands balling into fists. He knew this would happen; why didn’t Cassy listen to him? Gabriel should never have taken Cassy’s word that the nightmares had stopped; he should never have believed that a simple bout of puppy-love and adoration would be enough to erase his baby brother’s terrors.
“Dammit, Sammy! Did you steal my tie?” Dean Winchester hollered, tugging on a sock and hopping into the kitchen.
Sammy had argued) with none other than bitch face number thirty-two in place. The one that said,
in public yet, and holding hands with a dude screamed gay. But the disappointment that crossed Cas’s face was too much for Dean. He hated that look, and if he was honest with himself, Dean wanted to hold Cas’s hand, too. The feel of it, thin and warm, in his own, was comforting.
Dean blushed beet-red. “Sorry, Ellen, I, uh… Got a little carried away. See, today was-,”
Dean rolled his eyes. “What, did I teach you
Dean waited patiently for his friend to continue explaining, but he was met with silence. “And?”
“You’re gonna burn the eggs!” Dean chuckled at his brother’s admonition, returning his focus to the scrambling eggs in the frying pan. He lowered the heat, scooping a healthy amount onto his syrup-soaked plate, at which point Sam pretended to gag.
Dean chuckled. “Then you’re gonna have to let go of my hand,” he remarked, biting back a laugh at the distasteful look that crossed Castiel’s face. “Maybe we should just stay in here,” the smaller man decided, squeezing Dean’s hand lightly. Dean just shook his head, grinning from ear to ear, bringing Cas’s hand to his lips.
Cas acquiesced, gripping Dean’s legs while Gabriel lifted him up by the armpits. Together, they maneuvered through the apartment, Cas listening to the soft snores coming from Dean’s dead weight with a fond smile on his face. By the time they reached the couch (Gabriel’s apartment was laid out in the weirdest way; the door opened to the kitchen, which had a hallway of bedrooms, which led to the living room), Gabriel looked disgusted. He dropped Dean’s torso onto the blue cushions, while Cas laid his legs down gently.
“Are you his
Dean sucked in a shocked breath when he heard Castiel’s rough voice through the phone’s speakers. “Hello, Dean. I got your number from Gabriel and was wondering if you would be interested in going out tonight.”
Dean couldn’t decide whether to laugh, cry, or just gape at his best friend. This was not something Gabriel was comfortable with, showing affection and protective instincts for his siblings. Hell, half of what their friendship consisted of was bitching about their brothers. “Gabe… I’m not gonna hurt Cas. I really like him, and I know I haven’t done anything more than one-night stands in over two years, but I think I’m ready. Cas is different… He’s special.”
Castiel chuckled. “Nothing, nothing.” He took Dean’s hand, threading their fingers together, and led Dean to his car. At Dean’s groan, Cas looked up. “Is there a problem?”
As soon as Dean opened the door to Gabriel’s apartment, he was attacked by a very nimble, very nice-smelling octopus. Its limbs wrapped themselves around Dean’s body, and Dean hummed happily, gripping the body that was seemingly suctioned to his. “I missed you,” he breathed into messy black hair, nuzzling cinnamon-scented locks.
Dean cried out, pushing his palms over his ears. “Dammit, Gabe,” he hissed, his head hurting worse than ever. Gabe merely rolled his eyes and snapped, “Drink your coffee. You’re no fun hung over.”
Dean slipped from the bed, careful not to jostle Castiel too much, and padded down the stairs in his boxers. He quickly found the bathroom and sighed in relief, dropping his boxers.
“Not the important things, Dean. He gives you bits and pieces and hypotheticals, without ever really saying anything substantial. I’ve been curious about this guy ever since you brought him over for the first time.”
“Dean, we are going to have to leave the car eventually.”
Dean’s eyebrows knitted together. “You have what?” He asked cautiously. “Cause, seriously, Sammy, if you got some sort of STD, I really don’t wanna know about it,” he joked nervously, jiggling his leg to try to ease some of the tension in the room.
Dean eyed his best friend warily. “You okay to be here?” He gestured to the empty classroom. “You could take the day. The first day is easy enough; I’d be alright on my own.”
“C’mon, you,” he muttered, giving the smaller man a small smile. “Let’s go eat.” Dean bumped his hip against Castiel’s, which effectively stopped the laughter.
, Dean thought as he did his head count to make sure everyone had arrived. “Hi, everyone!” he announced in his most soothing tone. “Welcome to kindergarten! I’m Mr. Winchester, and that is Mr. Gabe, but you can call me Fitch.” He winked conspiratorially, and a few of the kids giggled. One boy looked confused and raised his hand, much to Dean’s pleasure. “Go ahead and tell us your name while you’re at it, soldier.”
Dean sifted his fingers through his hair, shifting his weight to his other leg. “Well, if it helps, it might not be a one-time thing,” he muttered, a faint blush creeping up his neck.
Cas groaned breathily at the brushes of Dean’s hand against the hard planes of his stomach. He bucked his hips up, seeking friction. He cursed silently; he hadn’t been this turned on just from making out since he was a kid. But there wasn’t time to question it anymore, because Dean’s hips were responding to his and he couldn’t breathe
Dean blushed, glaring at Cas half-heartedly. “Make that a Dr. Pepper,” he amended, giving the waitress a charming smile and reaching over the table to take Cas’s hand again.
When Castiel woke up again, it was too bright and his whole body ached. “Well, well, well,” muttered a familiar voice. “Sleeping Beauty finally arises.” Castiel turned his head, gasped at the pain from the sudden movement, and looked at his furious older brother. “So, are you going to tell me what the hell happened?”
Dean, who had been very uncomfortable and embarrassed in his previous predicament, felt all traces of mortification fade and morph into something akin to anxiety with a dash of annoyance thrown in. Despite the fact that Adam was their father’s lovechild (who had been dumped on them when Adam was ten) Dean loved his youngest brother fiercely. But Adam calling so soon (they had just spoken to him on the phone a week ago) was never a good sign. “Yeah?” Dean asked, trying and failing to be calm. His muscles tightened involuntarily, his heart beat a little faster, the works. Sam, when he was in a teasing mood, called it Dean’s big-brother reflex. Dean called it fuckin’ annoying, but they had agreed to disagree. “What did he want?”
“What’s up, fuckers?” Jo greeted Dean and Castiel, grinning.
Sam scowled, but his face darkened to a nice tomato-y color. “Shut up, Dean,” he growled. “And I wasn’t
Adam rolled his eyes, dropping into the seat beside Cas. He grinned at Dean. “Hey, he finally told you about Jess!”
Cas chuckled, replacing the movie. His next question was hesitant. “Dean?”
Dean frowned. “What, Sammy?”
Cas groaned, biting Dean’s shoulder through the thin t-shirt. “You’re a dirty, dirty tease,” he growled, pulling the cloth away roughly and sinking his teeth into the bare flesh of Dean’s shoulder.
,” he sang along, folding his arms across his chest and nodding along to the beat. About halfway into the song, Dean had this weird feeling someone was watching him. Thinking he was being discreet, he let his eyes wander over the array of tables, frowning about halfway through when he spotted a pair of electric blue eyes staring at him. Dean locked eyes with this stranger, who blushed profusely and looked away. Scowling, Dean marched across the bar to confront the man with the startling blue eyes. What he found was a gangly bunch of limbs connected to a thin torso with a handsome face, what looked like permanent sex hair, and those eyes. Dean wasn’t sure whether it was the drunken haze or what, because while this man should decidedly not be attractive to Dean, he was. Immensely.
Castiel’s eyes darkened with lust, fixed on the half-naked man in front of him. He wanted to say something, tell Dean to hurry, tell him to touch him, to tell him something,
Jo snorted. “Yeah, but Mom has her favorites, the ones she ‘allows’ in. She’s a lot nicer to her favorites, and sometimes she’ll let them get away with free drinks.” She smirked at Dean, who threw up his hands in mock-frustration.
Gabriel studied Dean severely. After a few minutes, he sighed, his entire body relaxing. “All right,” he allowed, a hint of a smile tugging at the corners of his lips. “You can continue your relationship with Cassy.”
“Dean, quit fuckin’ up my hair!” Adam whined, extricating himself from his brother’s embrace. He grinned at Castiel, sticking out his hand. “Nice to meet ya, Cas. Don’t believe anything Dean said about me; he’s just jealous that I got the good looks of the family.”
“Who’s Robbie?” Castiel asked politely, a small smile gracing his lips.
…” Gabriel grinned, pumping his fist in the air before yelling at the top of his lungs, “Yeah, Cassy, GET SOME!”
The door pulled open, and Gabriel stood in front of him, in pajamas and with definite bedhead, looking pissed. “What the… Dean? What are you doing here, man?”
Cas nodded, frowning slightly.
Thankfully, the waitress chose that moment to interrupt them with her unique brand of cheeriness. “Hi, how are you guys tonight? Geez, so cute, I’m sorry, but I just had to tell ya. You two are just adorable. Can I start you off with some drinks?”
to try these, Gabriel! Please, it’ll make me feel better, too.”) on the coffee table, harrumphing.
Castiel stepped in, offering helpfully, “I’m Gabriel’s brother. I’ve recently decided to move, and since Dean is friends with my brother, and Gabriel is a terrible friend, he has foisted me off on Dean as an attempt to familiarize me with my surroundings. Dean told me that I would have to visit the Roadhouse to truly start to ‘fit in’.”
“Let’s go eat, chucklehead,” Dean muttered, giving Castiel’s hand a final squeeze before releasing it. Cas grumbled as he got out of the car, scowling adorably.
“Morning, sleeping beauty!”
Sam smiled, relieved. “Thanks, Dean, I was wor- wait, what do you mean
Dean frowned. “He’s a person, Adam, treat him like one,” he snapped, feeling irrationally angry.
Sammy spotted them. Dean motioned to Cas and gestured, before shrugging. Sammy would get the message. Thankfully, his little brother thought he was as straight as a lance. He would make some assumption, and, if by chance Dean ended up doing the walk of shame home, Sam would just assume he found a girl to go home with.
Gabriel smiled fondly. “Yeah, Cassy always did fall asleep fastest to music. Our mother used to play for him when he was a baby. She even had Father buy a new piano strictly for Castiel’s room, because it soothed him so well.” He watched his brother’s back, rising and falling with each steady breath. “Of course, that stopped after a while, but Cassy still loves to be sung to.”
Your nephew is in the next room!”
“Sorry, sweetheart, but I really don’t want to get puked on. But, I’ll offer you an alternative: go to Gabriel’s without arguing, and we can pick up where we left off tonight tomorrow night.” He wagged his eyebrows suggestively.
Dean obeyed grumpily, although he had to admit the coffee was divine. The coffee Sammy made wasn’t bad, but this was food of the gods. He only looked up again when he heard his name. “What?”
When Sam picked up the phone, he was not pleased. “
Dean rolled his eyes, not amused. “Gabe, you saw me two weeks ago,” he said dryly. “How was the cruise, by the way?”
Sam rubbed the back of his neck, not taking his eyes off of the television screen. “He, uh, needs a place to crash. His girlfriend kicked him out, and he was laid off a few days ago.”
“Don’t sweat it, dude. Being in the closet is nothing to be ashamed of. Not everyone can be as flamboyant as me.” Gabriel grinned and handed Dean a cup of steaming hot coffee. “I mean, until recently, dear Cassy was, too. But that’s a story I’m not touching with a ten-foot pole.” Dean’s eyes narrowed – Gabriel’s joking tone slipped and his eyes were murderous. Before Dean could ask, Gabe’s eyes flickered behind him and his grin was back in place. “Good morning, Cassy!”
“Da- Dangit, kid, your mom’s gonna kill me for corrupting you,” Dean whined, pleading with the four-year-old.
“He’s out with Jess, I imagine,” Dean replied, cheeks beginning to hurt from smiling so much. He couldn’t help himself; no matter how much he bitched about his brother, Dean loved having him home again. “And stop callin’ me ‘mom’, dumbass. I’m much to macho to be someone’s mom.”
“Dammit, Robbie!” Robbie Singer parroted, grinning at his uncle.
“Is there anywhere I can take you?” Castiel asked politely, smoothing back Dean’s sweaty hair gently. He glanced over at the parking lot where Dean’s Impala was conveniently missing. “I think your companion is gone.”
Jo rolled her eyes, but she couldn’t stop a fond grin from forming. “Not even if you were the last man on earth, Deanna,” she taunted. Dean flirting and Jo shooting him down was Jo and Dean’s way; it had been going on since Dean turned fourteen and suddenly remembered that Jo was a girl.
, he thought, knowing his energy wouldn’t last forever. The pain was steadily getting stronger as the adrenaline from fight-or-flight response wore off. It had taken all of his willpower to make it to the one person who may still like him enough to care.
Castiel rolled his eyes. “Shut up, Dean, you’re drunk,” he said sweetly, getting in the driver’s seat. He waited patiently for Dean to get in, him grumbling the entire time.
one to know?!”
The man raised an eyebrow. “Uh-huh… And?”
Dean couldn’t resist. He sidled up to his boyfriend, sliding his arms around Castiel’s middle. “You’re a cute little housewife,” he whispered teasingly, pressing a kiss to Cas’s neck.
Sam’s lips twitched up into a slight grin. “Just checking in. We haven’t really hung out in a while, you always seem to be busy. Is it that bar chick you took home a few weeks ago?”
“Well, thanks, handsome. I’m Dean,” he drawled with a slight slur, grinning in earnest and taking the seat opposite Castiel.
“So, who pissed in your Cheerios?” Dean asked under his breath, crossing his arms while he monitored an impromptu soccer game.
“So what’s been up, bro?”
Gabe sighed loudly. “Could you two be any more annoying?” Secretly, he enjoyed watching Cassy be so animated and happy about something, but it was his job to complain. He looked at Dean and lifted an eyebrow. “Shouldn’t you be getting back to Sam, anyway? I thought you two did the whole movie thing after your bar tradition.”
“Dean, wait up!” Castiel called, running down the hallway. He skidded to a stop, face flushing as he took in the scene before him. “Um, hello, Gabriel.”
Dean flinched at the loud voice, letting out an groan upon recognizing it. “What the hell, Gabe?” He rasped, his throat dry and aching. “The fuck am I doing here, man?”
Dean scowled and shook his head. “You got a problem, buddy?”
Sam shrugged. “Regular doctors, sure, but I’m pretty sure that most of that money goes to pay off loans from school. But, Dean, Gabriel was so popular, he was able to pick and choose his clients. I’m pretty sure you’ve got to be pretty important to be able to do that. I looked him up online, and there was one woman who was willing to pay him two grand for a diagnosis.”
“If it helps, I just found out now,” Castiel offered, trying to fight a smile.
“Ungh, ugadeneaaaaa,” Cas moaned unintelligibly, not believing his eyes. Dean’s pretty pink tongue licked the pre-come from Castiel’s cock, traced the vein on the sensitive underside, and just when Cas thought he couldn’t handle any more, those pretty pink lips swallowed him up, and what didn’t fit in Dean’s mouth, Dean’s hands worked.
Dean was about to ask for bleach to clean the image from his brain when the classroom door burst open and kids started to pour in, most still clinging to their parents’ hands.
Gabriel sighed, his bare feet smacking the tiled floor as he padded over to his baby brother and threw an arm around his shoulders. “Well, then, baby bro, you better buckle up, because you’re in for one hell of a bumpy ride.”
Dean was ready for the challenge of charming the pants off of her, but his baby brother chose that moment to walk out of his office, grinning like the big giant he was. “Dean! How’d it go, dude?”
“Okay, okay,” Dean muttered, lifting Cas by his hips and sliding him over. His heart melted at the triumphant little grin on the other man’s lips, and it was almost enough for Dean to decide to kiss Castiel into submission, but he opted instead just to grab Cas’s hand, rubbing his thumb over the smooth skin on the back of Cas’s hand. “I’m going to take you to the best little diner. The pie is divine.”
. He could feel his cock hardening in his pants, and he moaned, feeling like a horny teenager.
Castiel felt his heart melting, a sappy grin tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Let’s go, before Jo thinks we’ve actually been eaten by a demon.”
Dean grinned. “Garth is a third-grader. He’s in one of the other classes Gabe helps out with, and he’s kind of a problem kid. He needs a freaking para*, and we have an opening, but nobody’s signing up.” He scowled, frustrated with the school system, but shook his head. “Anyway, Garth’s mom doesn’t get off work until fifteen minutes after school is over, and she’s got a half-hour commute from where she works to the school. So Gabriel asked me if I’d let Garth start hanging out in my room until his mom gets there. He’s a little weird, but he grows on you.”
“Shut up,” Cas mumbled, methodically cutting up his pancakes and sticking little bites into his mouth. “We weren’t that loud.”
“Let me take care of you, baby,” Cas whispered, kissing Dean’s lips gently before flipping their positions. Dean’s last coherent thought was how beautiful Cas looked with his lips wrapped around Dean’s throbbing erection.
Dean shook his head, grinning. “Thank God my parents went with something normal,” he blurted, then quickly looked down, cursing himself for being a jackass, the alcohol for lowering his inhibitions, and every god on the planet for letting him make such a comment.
Dean giggled, looking at Castiel with pouty lips. “It’s’a only night I’ma ‘lowed to drink, man,” he slurred, grinning. “Leas’ til summer, anyway.”
Jo Harvelle, who was like the boys’ sister, poured them both shots of whiskey and fixed Sam with a smirk. “Don’t even try to get out of this one, Sam,” she teased, giggling. Jo worked as a bartender/waitress at the Roadhouse while she finished up her degree at the local college.
“Fuck, baby,” Dean whimpered, his hand snaking into his boxers, gripping his still achingly hard cock. He hissed at the touch, starting to jerk when Castiel’s hand brushed the tip and Dean cried out.
Castiel sighed good-naturedly, a small smile pulling at the corners of his lips. “It wasn’t my fault,” he protested jokingly.
*The song Dean is singing to Castiel is Angie by the Rolling Stones, a personal favorite (:
“Dammit, Robbie!”
The response he was getting from Castiel nearly drove Dean insane. He longed to finish his game, to tease Castiel good and proper, until the man was driven senseless with want, but it was too much. “Dammit, Cas,” he groaned, releasing Castiel’s hips and tearing the shirt off of his boyfriend’s chest. His eyes roamed hungrily over Cas’s chest, but he didn’t linger there; what he was looking for was a little farther south.
, he told himself, turning his head to face Castiel. “Hey,” he said softly, using two fingers to lift the other man’s chin gently. “I admit, it’s not something I’ve really done, at least, not for a damn long time.. But last night was amazing.” Dean wasn’t sure what the deciding factor of his decision was; whether it was Cas’s blue eyes flooding with warmth, or the way his mouth was just begging to be kissed, but the next thing he knew, his lips were brushing over Castiel’s and it was perfection.
“And one for my big brother, everyone’s favorite kindergarten teacher!” Sam shouted, laughing at Dean. While Dean was already half-smashed, Sam was still pretty sober, despite his brother constantly throwing drinks his way. It was too easy to pass them off to someone else while Dean took his own shot; when Sam’s brother was tipsy, all of his observational skills disappeared.
Dean opened his mouth to question the boy, but he was interrupted by the front door opening. “Hello, Dean. I’m sorry I’m late, but I go-,” Castiel’s eyes widened, gaze trained on Robbie. “What do we have here?”
Dean grinned. “I’m gonna meet my new class today. I’m excited, so sue me.” He dipped his toast into Sam’s egg yolk, much to his little brother’s disgust (“Dammit, Dean! You’re an ass, I was going to eat that!”) and Dean laughed. “Meet you at the Roadhouse around five?” He asked hopefully. The Roadhouse was a bar owned by Ellen Harvelle, who had been something of a mother to the boys for many years now. It was also one of the best burger joints in town, and the Winchesters’ hangout.
“I KNEW YOU WERE INTO HER!” Dean crowed, pumping his fist in the air victoriously. He got a manic gleam in his eye that Sam immediately distrusted. “Now we’ve just got to set the two of you up… And since I’m
Dean swore and untangled his limbs from Castiel’s, giving the smaller man a placating kiss on the forehead. “Sorry, Cas, I completely forgot. No wonder Sammy was so pissed at me.”
Gabe groaned again. “Ugh, fine. I’m a little hungover. My brother showed up last night, beaten to a bloody pulp. I cleaned him up, made sure nothing was broken,” (before becoming a teaching aide, Gabriel was a doctor) “gave him some meds to help with the pain, and got drunk as hell after he finally fell asleep.”
“Dean, I – ,” was all the warning Cas could give before he came down Dean’s throat, Dean swallowing it up the best that he could. Once he swallowed every drop, Dean crawled back up beside Cas, pressing kisses on his face, while Castiel threaded his fingers through Dean’s hair. “Dean, that was… I don’t think I’ve ever come so hard in my life.”
Sam’s eyes narrowed, lips thinning even more. “Not the point, Dean. What the hell is going on? You were like a man on a mission when you came into my office last month. You wouldn’t have done it for something so unimportant that it could be solved in a month.” Sam’s eyes softened slightly and he tucked a lock of hair behind his ear. “Look, if you’re in some kind of trouble… I can help you. But I need to know, Dean, you have to talk to me.”
Gabriel opened his mouth as if to reply, but snapped it shut, thinking better of it. He scowled briefly, looking annoyed by his indecision. Dean furrowed his brow. “Uh, you okay, buddy?”
“My brother,” Dean muttered, scowling. Damn Sammy for demanding Dean hand over his keys. He sighed, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. Well, he really didn’t want to go home and have Sammy wake up to find him like this, so… “My friend’s place, if you don’t mind… Gabe, he’ll let me crash on his couch. 702 South Elm, apartment two.” And for some reason, that had Cas’s lips quirking up into a grin. “What’s so funny?” Dean barked weakly.
“That’s a great idea! Okay, little lady, since you sit next to Kev, it’s your turn.” Dean smiled encouragingly at the small brunette next to Kevin.  The little girl didn’t hesitate to introduce herself as Bela Talbot, and Dean had to cut her off (politely, of course) or else she would have gone on to tell her life story. He listened as the rest of the kids introduced themselves, checking their names off of the roster: Jamie, Cameron, Sara, Kim, Levi, Lucas, Ben… Dean grinned when as the last kid, a little blonde named Lilith, was done introducing herself. This year was looking to be pretty good.
“Growin’ like a weed and testin’ every limit put in front of him. Of course, his father seems to think it’s adorable; says it’s just like lookin’ at you round that age.” Ellen scowled, as if her four-year-old son’s bad behavior was all his fault. “He does like that golf set you sent over, though,” she admitted with a grudging smile.
Gabriel beamed. “That’s wonderful, Cassy!” He hesitated. “You aren’t going to, well… What you did previously?”
“I don’t know how much you remember from last night, Dean, but if it was not something you had wanted… we don’t have to act on it,” Cas said quietly, staring at his lap.
“No,” Castiel whispered. Gabriel made an angry noise and turned suddenly, slamming his fist into the wall, leaving a dent. “Dammit, Castiel! You can’t just fuckin’ show up here, half dead, expect me to take care of you, and not tell me a damn thing about what happened! This is too much, man.” Gabriel made to leave, but Castiel grabbed his wrist, despite the fact he knew it would hurt like a bitch.
said that, even if it was true, Gabriel rolled his eyes. “Yeah, yeah; help me toss him on the couch, will you? He weighs a ton.”
Robbie turned back to Dean. “Does that mean Cas is my uncle, too?”
Gabriel gave Cas a warning look. “When is Dean going to introduce you to Sam?”
yours.” Gabriel gave his brother a knowing smirk, and Castiel blushed from his toes to the top of his head.
Dean rolled his eyes. “No, ma’am, wouldn’t dream of it.” He grabbed Cas’s hand and pulled him over to the bar. “Cas, this is Ellen, the only woman in her right mind who’d take on my uncle Bobby.” He pulled the dark-haired woman into a tight embrace, placing a kiss on her forehead. “How’s Robbie doin’?”
“Don’t be embarrassed,” the angel murmured softly, placing a comforting hand on Dean’s wrist. “You didn’t do anything too bad.”
Dean’s eyes were as wide as saucers now. “What the fuck, Gabe,” he muttered, mind boggled. “I hate hospitals, and even I wouldn’t have quit that damn job. I could have put you through law school, like, twice!”
“Less talkin’,” he muttered, grasping at Castiel’s messy hair and pulling his head back down so their lips met once more. The kissing was sloppy and wet, definitely not Dean’s best, but it just felt so
“Gabe!” Cas whined, making a face. “I don’t want to hear about your sexual activities.”
, Cas thought with narrowed eyes,
“Please?” Cas whispered, and damn, if that wasn’t the hottest thing Dean had ever heard.
“I’m not a big fan of it, either, baby. But, uh, can we move this into the apartment? Cause you’re kinda heavy,” Dean joked, kissing Castiel’s forehead.
Ellen nodded, satisfied. “So, what can I get you boys?”
Dean ruffled Robbie’s hair. “Be good while we get lunch ready, okay?” The child nodded absently, too in to the Power Rangers show he was watching. Dean chuckled, walking into his kitchen to find Castiel humming as he pulled out a loaf of bread.
Gabriel chewed his lower lip thoughtfully. “Cassy, you know I love Fitch; you’ve heard me talk about him in my work stories.” Castiel nodded, smiling slightly at Dean’s nickname. Gabriel continued. “But are you sure you want a relationship, even if it’s a purely physical thing, with someone so deeply in the closet?”
etc. It was not a face Dean was fond of. But, he figured, he probably deserved it. Sam had supported him ever since he had dared to desire the dream of teaching, and Dean had just ditched part of a ritual that Sammy had started to help Dean get back to himself after teaching had proved more stressful than Dean had prepared himself for. So, yeah, Sammy had a right to be pissed. “In my defense, I have to bring up the hot-chick clause,” Dean threw in helpfully, hoping to get even the slightest grin. The hot-chick clause was a rule that the brothers had put in place when they were nineteen and fifteen, respectively (Dean had been doing it for longer, but it was the first time Sammy had recognized it as a real excuse) when Sammy had met a hot girl who wanted to
Gabriel looked at him sharply. “How do you know he’s quiet?”
) he revealed his secret. That’s if Sam was still talking to him after Dean’s revelation, anyway. “That’s great, Sammy! I always liked Jess, although she’s definitely out of your league. It’s a good thing you’re the second best-looking guy around here.”
Both men whipped around to see Ellen standing in the doorway with a wry grin on her lips. Castiel froze. “It’s not what it looks like, ma’am, I swear,” he started to protest, but one look at Dean’s relaxed posture stalled him.
Castiel grinned from ear to ear, clutching the little note as he glided into the kitchen, humming a Lady Gaga song under his breath. His grin, if possible, widened when he smelled something heavenly. “Pancakes!”
Ellen crossed her arms. “Yes, I do. It was a little hard not to notice when the damn boy was checking out every good-lookin’ man in my bar when he was a teenager, and then he brings you in, and with the way you two were behavin’, I could just tell. And while I’m happy for you two,
Castiel woke to a cold space in his bed where Dean should have been. He mewled as he stretched his limbs, trying not to focus on how disappointed he was that Dean had slipped away while he slept. It was only as he was searching for a pair of clean boxers that Castiel noticed a note stuck to his dresser with Blu-Tack. He grinned; Dean was such a teacher.
Dean felt a knot in his stomach, because even though he didn’t want to remember what he had asked of his little brother, he knew what this file contained. It was only confirmed when Dean took a seat across from Sam, eyes locked on the folder that had his brother’s messy scrawl across it:
Dean leaned his forehead against Castiel’s sweetly, brushing his lips against Cas’s, careful not to let it go too far this time. He smiled at the raven-haired man ruefully. “Gabe has my number; call me later, and we’ll make plans, okay?” Dean glanced at the clock on the oven and blanched. “Shit, it’s late, I really gotta go!” He kissed Castiel one more time, threw a happy grin in Gabe’s direction and bolted out the door.
“Michael?” Dean asked hesitantly.
Dean walked back into the living room, finding only Castiel, who had moved from his perch on the chair to one side of the couch. “Hi,” he said, embarrassed, deliberating between the chair and the couch. After a few interminable minutes, he sat down in the seat next to Cas, smoothing down his rumpled jeans nervously.
Dean shook his head and strode back into the smoky bar, glancing up at the stage where a local band was covering some old rock songs. He leaned against a wall and smiled, recognizing the song instantly. “
“So, you new here, Cas?” Dean asked warmly, shifting closer.
Dean sagged in relief, throwing a thankful smile in Castiel’s direction. Ellen set the plate down, staring at the two men surrounding her daughter thoughtfully. “Boy, I know you aren’t gonna come in here and not greet your aunt Ellen properly.”
Dean pouted, nipping Castiel’s lower lip. “No fair. Whenever I’m hungry, you tell me to suck it up.”
Dean strode into Sammy’s office like a man on a mission. He gave his patented ‘I’m-adorable’ grin to the secretary, who rolled her eyes, already familiar with Dean’s antics. “Hello, Mr. Winchester. Mr. Winchester is just looking over a case, but I’m sure he’ll make time for you.”
Ellen stood off to the side, drying a plate with an exasperated look on her face. “Jo, you done spewin’ profanities?”
Cas furrowed his brow, looking sad. “Well, at least let us walk you to the front,” he reasoned, although Gabriel was positive it was just a way for Cassy to get some more time holding Dean’s hand. Nonetheless, Gabe followed the pair through the hallway and into the kitchen, slightly regretting his decision when Dean went to give Castiel a kiss goodbye and Cas did some freaky shit with his tongue that had Dean growling and lifting Castiel up by his thighs onto the island to get a better angle.
Castiel glowered, attempting to fix his hair, but he soon gave up. It was going to be a mess, anyway, so why bother? “I think I’m going to look for a job today.”
“Dean, I’m
Gabriel raised a brow, an amused smile playing on his lips. “Oh, Dean, you are in for it, buddy,” Gabe crowed, not bothering to lower his voice at all. “You came here, drunk as a skunk, babbling about what a great kisser my baby brother is.”
Dean’s brow furrowed, while Castiel beamed. “I’ll have a Coke,” he ordered, while Dean murmured something about a beer. Cas raised an eyebrow. “What about no drinking?”
Dean hesitated, biting his lip. “I’d normally take you to my car,” he nodded to his ’67 Impala with a mixture of love and pride, “but I sorta got someone with me, so…”
interrupted his disjointed thoughts; he was finally on the right floor.
Gabriel smiled wryly. “Sorry, Dean-o, but you’re a little gay.” He looked at Castiel and mouthed incredulously, ‘Cas?’
. He forced himself to close his eyes. “Touch me, Dean,” he ordered in a rough voice, allowing himself to gaze at Dean again.
Sam chuckled. “I’m still shocked that you’re a teacher, no matter how amazing you are at it. You and kids, who would’ve guessed.” He sighed, moving his hand to the papers in front of him. “Well, I have it.”
“Are you going to tell me how the fuck you got Dean Winchester, ultimate straight dude, lemme tell you, Cassy, to fuck you?” Gabriel exclaimed impatiently.
Gabe sighed, throwing a dirty look at Dean. “If I could tell you, I would. But it isn’t my place to tell. Besides, I only know the outline. He refuses to tell me the specifics.”
Sam scowled. “You already had guardianship of me, so it wasn’t that big of a deal. Dad sent money every month, plus you were working part-time while you went to school. But it’s different for Adam. He wasn’t raised like us, or even with us for that matter. Then he lost his mom and was thrust into a life with two brothers he hardly knew…”
Dean’s face flushed lightly. “Yeah, that name a yours.. Well, it’s sorta a mouthful,” he admitted sheepishly.
Dean planted wet kisses on Castiel’s hips, everywhere but where Cas wanted him. Castiel tensed when he felt hot breath blowing on the head of his dick. His eyes locked on emerald green ones, then dropped to plump lips that opened, a tongue snaking out and –
Ellen rolled her eyes, deftly removing the baskets of burgers and fries from the tray and sliding them in Dean and Castiel’s direction. “Jo, get those boys a drink and a good table before the rush starts.”
Dean grinned around Castiel’s cock, loving the sounds that were coming from his lover’s lips. Dean’s free hand snaked down to fondle Cas’s balls, and Castiel mewled. When Dean hollowed out his cheeks, sucking hard, it ripped a scream from Cas’s lips.
“It’s okay that I alluded to my employers that we are friends, right?” Cas’s voice wavered slightly, revealing how nervous he really was.
, he thought thankfully. Dean bit his bottom lip, contemplating. “Hey – you, uh, wanna get out of here?”
Dean was so thrilled to hear from Castiel, he wasn’t even upset about Gabriel sharing tidbits about Dean to his brother. “Okay, sounds great. I’ll pick you up at Gabe’s around six.” Castiel agreed with a happy noise that made Dean’s stomach flip-flop.
“You can call them monsters, but ‘mud monkeys’ is out of the question?” Gabriel demanded, indignant.
Castiel Novak knocked on his brother’s door, using what little strength he had left. He moaned at the pain such little motions caused, curling into an even tighter ball. He could feel the blood soaking through his shirt and jeans, and he whimpered. They must have done more damage to his body than Castiel had realized.
Castiel bit his lip. “Yeah, I am.” He glanced at Dean, who smiled, and the knot in Castiel’s stomach loosened.
“Alright, Dean. What do you need?”
Dean blushed, beaming. “Hell yeah!” He leaned over, pulling Cas into a bone-breaking hug, nuzzling his face into Cas’s neck. Cas sighed contentedly, hugging him back, but when Dean started to kiss Castiel’s neck, Cas pushed him away, albeit reluctantly.
Castiel blushed again. “It was, ah, good. The singing. Better than them, anyway,” he jerked his finger up at the mediocre band on stage, which earned him a slight smirk from his handsome stranger.
Dean beamed, despite Sam keeping him in the dark for almost four months. He knew that if he didn’t make a big deal about Sam’s deception, Sammy might not get so angry when (
“Hey, Dean-o,,” commented Gabriel Milton, Dean’s teaching aide, saucily. “How was your summer, hot stuff?”
“Cassy? What are you doing with
Dean grinned. This felt so…
Dean thought miserably. He sneaked a peek at Cas, who was watching him with a mixture of concern and amusement on his face. All traces of the lust that had previously occupied that beautiful face were gone, and Dean groaned, wanting to hit himself.
“Seriously, if you aren’t going to watch anything good, at least let me catch up on all the hospital gossip. Come on, I bet Dr. Sexy has already had, like, four flings that I know nothing about!” Dean whined, to no avail. His younger brother just smirked and muttered under his breath about Dean being a girl, before turning his attention back to the show.
Dean groaned. “Please tell me you didn’t sleep with her.”
Ellen waited until Dean was out of earshot to take Castiel’s hand in her own. “I’m not usually one for big emotional speeches, but I think I need to do something of the sort right now. I’m pretty sure being a secret isn’t how you want your relationship to go, and I know it isn’t how Dean wants this to go, either, but just promise me you’ll give him time, okay? Dean is a good boy, but he’s very touchy about his sexuality. He hasn’t had very good experiences with coming out, and his brother means the world to him. Even though I know Sammy would accept him for who he is in a heartbeat, Dean isn’t as sure. It might take him a while to tell people, but he’ll get there. I just want to make sure you’re in it for the long haul, and you aren’t going to skip out on my boy after you get fed up of waiting.”
Sam cringed. “Dean– ,” he piped up, only to be cut off by his brother’s incessant planning. “Dean!”
Gabriel rolled his eyes, reaching around to grab another plate from the cupboard. “I have to share?” He whined, but gave his little brother a generous helping anyway. He drizzled chocolate sauce over each individual pancake, before holding the bottle out to Castiel. “Want some?”
,” he snickered, smirking at Dean. “Now where’s Sam? He promised me a steak dinner if I got here before Christmas.”
Cas growled, burying his face in Dean’s shoulder. “No,” he mumbled petulantly, clinging tighter. “I like it right where I am.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Cause parents don’t want their kids teacher to be a drunk,” he said in a ‘duh’ tone. “Plus, five-year-olds are fuckin’ annoyin’ with a hangover.” He flashed a conspiratorial grin in Cas’s direction.
It had been two weeks exactly since Dean met Castiel (not that he was counting; only chicks did crap like that) and Dean couldn’t remember being happier. He had taken Cas out on three more dates since the diner; once to an amusement park a few towns over, once to the movie theater in downtown Sioux Falls, and once to Dean’s house to watch movies on a night when Sam had informed Dean he wouldn’t be coming home (to which Dean spent the next twenty minutes alternately heckling his brother and digging for information on the girl). This was most likely the reason he was up at an ungodly hour on a Saturday, whistling as he cooked breakfast.
, he thought with anticipation. With luck, they would have Gabriel’s apartment to themselves, so they could fool around without Castiel’s elder brother interrupting every five minutes or just being a general nuisance.
Ellen stared at Castiel thoughtfully, a grin forming on her lips. “I’m glad, Cas. I’m glad it’s you he’s taking a shot with.”
Dean scowled at his brother, snatching his cell phone off of the coffee table. “Shut your cakehole, Sammy. It’s a classic.” He furrowed his brow, not recognizing the number calling. He pursed his lips, flipping the phone open. “Hello?”
best-looking?!”
Castiel’s brow furrowed. “Isn’t anyone allowed to come in?”
“Why are you always pickin’ on me? Sammy gets free drinks, too!” He complained, while Castiel chuckled, laying a hand on Dean’s arm.
Castiel grinned lustfully, raking his eyes over Dean’s body. “I thought you’d never ask.” He stood, holding out his hand. Dean hesitated, before grabbing Cas’s wrist, trying to make it look as though he was leading some drunk out of the bar. No one needed to know what was really going on.
“What the fuck?” Castiel heard his brother roar. He felt arms around him, picking him up, but the details were lost on him; the pain was too intense.
Dean grinned when he finally took the time to realize what Castiel was wearing for bottoms. He silently thanked every deity he could think of for sweatpants as he shoved them roughly down Castiel’s legs.
Gabe grinned. “Great, even with the terrible company.” At this, he grimaced. Dean sighed. Gabriel’s family was an enigma. His parents were filthy rich, but had always been distant, relying on their eldest, Michael, to take care of his six younger siblings. Despite Gabriel’s insistence that he hated the lot of them (except one brother and his only sister), Dean knew differently. He knew that Gabriel really just wanted his family to get their heads out of their asses and just love each other. A big happy family was a dream both Dean and Gabriel shared, although neither would admit it. This was why it was so very difficult to deal with Gabe after another failed family trip/outing.
Dean fought the urge to grimace, instead pasting a sheepish grin on his face. “Yeah, that would be Cas.” And once thoughts of Castiel started playing in his mind, like a home movie Dean would never get tired of, his fake smile was a lot less fake and much more mushy.
After Ellen left with Robbie, Castiel and Dean traded the most amazing blow jobs Cas had ever had – or given. They fell onto the couch, blissed out in their post-sex haze, and quickly dozed off. It was an hour before Castiel woke to find his boyfriend pressing kisses to every bit of bare skin he could get to.
“I know of one particular
“Whatever, Sammy,” Dean chuckled, rolling his eyes. “Uh, I’m gonna get off here, okay? I’ll be home soon.”
“That’s Castiel Novak. He’s my friend, and we were gonna watch a movie, before some asshole interrupted us,” Dean said smoothly, smirking at Adam. He risked a glance at Cas and smiled. The smaller man visibly relaxed.
“Is that when you can’t poop?” Robbie inquired, eyes wide. Cas nodded gravely, a wicked glint in his eyes, as Dean glared menacingly. Robbie, meanwhile, continued. “Mommy has medicine for that,” he said earnestly, giggling behind his chubby hand.
Robbie giggled. “That’s a funny name. Cass-tee-el.” He sounded it out, wrinkling his nose.
Dean sighed softly. “Can’t we just kiss some more?” He jutted out his lower lip, which made Castiel grin in amusement and want to press gentle kisses all over Dean’s face.
. “Why the hell would he quit a job like that? What do doctors make, Sammy, a lot, right?”
Dean’s cheeks flamed, and he kicked the bathroom door shut so he could finish emptying his bladder.
“Thank you. Sorry,” he whispered, his eyes feeling very heavy.
Ellen smiled at them both fondly. “Dean, you go pack up Robbie for me, will you? I want to have a little talk with Cas, here.”
.” Castiel chuckled as Dean paused what he was doing, his boyfriend’s lips millimeters away from Cas’s. “Not that this isn’t wonderful, because it is,” Cas backtracked quickly, grinning at the frown on Dean’s lips, “but I’m starved.” As if to emphasize his point, Castiel’s stomach rumbled noisily.
“Yeah, Cas?”
Dean licked his lips.
Jo groaned. “You wouldn’t,” she muttered, wrinkling her nose. “You aren’t the one he’s constantly trying to screw with. He’s a monster.”
Dean snorted. “Jeez, you’re such a kid, Sammy. But, hey, why not?” He gave his little brother a happy grin before scrambling the eggs, attempting to whistle along with a Zeppelin song.
Once they were safely hidden away in the alley, Dean loosened his grip on Cas’s hand. He opened his mouth to say something, but before he could ask what was happening, he was shoved forcefully against the brick wall, and Castiel’s lips were on his own, teasing, tasting, and nipping gently.
Dean shook his head with a small grin. “I should’ve known you would be one of those people who’d drive a crap car,” he said mournfully, looking at Castiel’s Fiat 500. “This is like something Sammy would drive.”
“This had better be pie of the gods,” Cas said darkly, reaching for Dean’s hand as soon as he was able. Dean hesitated; he hadn’t done anything
Sam, however, watched his brother warily. “Well, then you might still want to look into this. Gabe, man… He’s been hiding some pretty important details about who he is. Did you know Milton isn’t his real last name?”
Castiel smiled. “That sounds agreeable, if it wouldn’t be too much trouble.”
deactivated during this, Dean, and you know it. This is like, the only time we actually hang out anymore, since my little firm’s been building and since the school has given you more responsibilities. And you blew me off for a one-night stand?” Dean’s little brother was indignant.
Gabe scowled. “No one, idiot,” he muttered gruffly, popping a golden candy into his mouth. He took his sweet time crinkling the plastic wrapper before groaning. “Could you quit with the staring? I can
Dean scowled. “I’m a grown man, Sammy, I don’t have to answer to you,” he grumbled rebelliously, before softening his tone. “I’m sorry man, I know, I should have called you, or at least said something before I left. I saw someone I liked and we sort of left together. I was drunk as hell, and a little focused, y’know?” He said the last bit with a smirk, and he could almost hear his brother’s disgusted look (or what he called ‘bitch face #13) through the phone.
Gabriel had just finished rinsing his dishes and was on his way to his bedroom for a well-deserved mid-morning nap when he heard his brother speaking through the thin walls. “
“I don’t want to wait,” Dean murmured, nipping lightly along the soft skin of Cas’s neck. “We’ll be real quick, I promise.”
Dean scowled, stealing a piece of toast off of Sam’s plate. “Isha fus daya coo, oo bish!” Dean said around the toast precariously placed between his teeth while he tucked in his forest green button-up shirt.
“Uh, yeah,” Dean mumbled, cheeks flushing pink. “It’s kind of hot, when you get all gravelly and serious.”
Sam looked taken aback, doing a double take at the clock on the wall. “Well, shit. I must have lost track of time.” He frowned slightly. “Wait, who’s Garth?”
“I could definitely go for some burgers and a soda,” Dean said hopefully, looking at Cas for agreement.
Sam was not amused. “The hot-chick clause is
Castiel recoiled as if he had been smacked. He picked up his fork and pushed at the mushy remains of pancake on his plate. Gabe sighed. “Look, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that. But if you get to keep your private life, well, private, then can’t I do the same? It’s just a fling, anyway. If it gets serious, I’ll bring her home to meet the cavalry, but I don’t want you scaring away my girl. You already did that enough last night.” Gabriel poked the sullen man’s arm, grinning.
Dean drummed his fingers on his thighs, suddenly nervous. What was he doing, sitting,
“Wanted to do this all night,” Cas gasped, his rough voice even more so. He had one hand pinning Dean to the wall, while the other caressed Dean’s cheek and Dean felt like he was in heaven.
Cas’s breathy statement was met with a low whine and a jutted out lower lip, which Castiel brushed his thumb over. “We’re making out in your car like we’re in high school,” he whispered, fighting the urge to grin at the gorgeous man with grabby hands who had kidnapped him from his brother’s apartment under the ruse of a date. Instead, Castiel had been greeted with a kiss that quickly morphed into groping. When Dean looked ready to whine again, Castiel chuckled. “Not that I’m not enjoying myself, because I am, but didn’t you mention a restaurant when we were on the phone, earlier?”
Once the simpering girl left, Castiel gave Dean a wide smile. “She thinks we’re adorable.”
He could hear Castiel chuckle. “So, going out?” Cas prompted in that slow, sexy voice, and Dean stifled a groan.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean grinned. “You were that bored? You know, you could have just called in your super-hot secretary for a… how do I put this delicately for your virgin ears? Oh, I know! You could’ve gotten your head out of your ass, called that beautiful lady into your office, and kissed her senseless.”
Castiel giggled, until he heard Jo’s voice yell, “I heard that, Deanna!” Which, of course, made him laugh harder. Dean rolled his eyes, grumbling, but he couldn’t resist watching fondly as Cas chortled.
Dean scoffed. “Kind of like you used to do with me, when you talked about your life before you came here?” Gabe blanched, and Dean continued angrily. “Must be a family trait.”
“Of course I have some. It goes well with caramel on ice cream.”
Dean’s grin became a little sheepish. “Well, when I first became a teacher, one of my kids couldn’t say ‘Winchester’, so he called me Mr. Fitchser, until all of the kids were just calling me Fitch. I decided I liked it, so that’s been my class name ever since.” Kevin’s lips stretched into a shy smile, and Dean filled with pleasure. He glanced down at his roster. “Are you Kevin Tran, then, son?”
Castiel looked into Ellen’s eyes sincerely. “I’m in this for as long as Dean wants me,” he said truthfully. “I haven’t met anyone who makes me feel like Dean does in a long time, and I want this to go somewhere. I knew before we went on our first date that Dean hadn’t come out of the closet yet, and I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t okay with letting Dean tell people in his own time.”
Dean was halfway back to Castiel’s bedroom when he heard the soft cries. The hair on the back of his neck stood straight up, and he raced back into the room, only to find Castiel tossing and turning, the sheet twisting around his legs. “No, no,” Cas cried, his arms raising to protect his face from some unknown threat.
Sam released Dean with a goofy grin on his lips. “Dean’s in loooooove,” he singsonged, and he reached in to pinch his brother’s cheeks with an evil look in his eyes.
Dean glanced at Sam, pausing between bites. “Nothing, really. We got a new kid transferred in, but that’s about it. Why?”
Castiel pursed his lips, sitting down carefully in his favorite armchair. “We didn’t- I mean, we might have, but – Gabriel, this really isn’t any of your business,” he sputtered, avoiding his brother’s eyes.
Dean frowned, smacking the back of Adam’s head without any real force behind it. even if his baby brother was a jackass, Dean was too happy to see him to care. “I raised you better than that, Adam.”
. Dean gulped, oddly turned on.
“Dean!” Cas cried indignantly, attempting to smooth down his raven locks. “Actually,” he said tentatively, “I’m no longer unemployed.”
“Dean,” Cas said sternly. This adorable, sexy, drunken man was going to be the death of him. “What did I say?”
Gabe made an annoyed sound in the back of his throat. “Ca- my brother likes prefers anonymity.”
Dean’s thoughts continued in that direction until he heard his name, distantly. He shook his head, blinking. “What?”
Dean relaxed a little, giving Cas a light kiss and an apologetic grimace before jogging into the living room. “Robbie! Your mom’s here!”
Castiel froze, eyes locked on Dean’s. His expression morphed, and he looked horrified with himself. “I’m so sorry, Dean,” he whimpered, curling into himself, tears streaming down his face. Dean sighed, thankful that Cas was back to himself, but worried about the smaller man. He crawled onto the bed, pulling Castiel into his lap.
“Dude, I have my own. Why would I want yours?” Sam retorted, watching his brother scramble to get ready in time, amused.
Hi guys, it’s been,,,,, seven years, holy shit. So earlier this year, I thought to myself “I will never write for the supernatural fandom again” and then, of course, 2020 completely derailed my plans. I’m back in my spn phase, and currently rewriting this au, coincidentally. I’m gonna make it into a new story, because it’s going to be reworked so much, but I figured I might as well post what’s been sitting in my google docs for years to here. Enjoy?
Sam rolled his eyes. “Yeah, but the maple is helping you along to a heart attack at thirty-five. Fruit is healthy
Gabe grinned dreamily. “Ah, yes, Mrs. Johnson. What a lovely woman.”
“Too much info, dude,” Sam whined. “And my name is Sam, not Sammy. I’m twenty-seven years old, I’m not a baby.”
Sam’s head snapped up, clearly surprised. “Dammit, Dean, I didn’t expect you to be home so soon,” he said quickly, running an impatient hand through his hair.
Castiel averted his eyes, lips thinning with displeasure. “No. I think I will look downtown. There seems to be a cluster of delightful looking shops that I could look at. I was going to start there, and maybe save up to go back to school.” He glanced up at his brother shyly. “Maybe doing something I want to do, for a change.”
The brothers were about six episodes into a Dr. Sexy marathon (which Sam was thoroughly enjoying, not that he would admit it to anyone) when a loud Foreigner song started to play. It jolted the boys out of their trancelike state, and Sam snorted. “Seriously, dude? Foreigner?”
’, Dean tossed the smaller man onto the bed, grinning predatorily at the flushed face. “I’ve wanted to do this for a while,” he sighed, peeling off his tee and tossing it over his shoulder before kicking the door closed behind him.
you and I had in common.” His eyes flashed dangerously, but after a moment, Gabriel seemed to shrink into himself, making him seem smaller than he already was. “But I understand how you feel. I wish Castiel would just
It had been a long drive from his apartment to his brother’s, three towns over. He wasn’t sure he was going to be able to make it off of the elevator. His side was killing him; he’d lost feeling in his legs during the beating, honestly, he was surprised that they were actually doing what they were told. He could feel the slick blood dripping down his skin in various places, and he resisted the urge to vomit. He had never been overly fond of blood, especially not when it was pouring out of his skin in copious amounts. A
Dean immediately looked wary. “I thought you liked him, Ellen,” he said cautiously, reluctant to leave Castiel alone.
Castiel gave the child a genuine smile, kneeling down to Robbie’s level. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Robbie. My name is Castiel.”
“What about Robbie?” Castiel managed to gasp, feeling his resolve crumble. He knew that Dean knew he was Castiel’s weakness; all Dean had to do was start kissing him and eventually he would agree to whatever Dean wanted.
Dean could feel Castiel’s body relaxing, and he sang softer. “
Castiel raised his eyebrows. “Why is that?”
Gabriel leaned against the door frame, smirking. “Nice ass, Dean-o. But could you, you know,
“What’s corruptin’ mean, Uncle Dean?” the little towhead asked, blinking his big puppy-dog eyes innocently.
“Gah, you just ruined it,” Dean cried dramatically, grabbing his own plate and  smothering it in maple syrup.
