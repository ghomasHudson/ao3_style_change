And Sam’s about to answer, except then suddenly Mary says real carefully, as if she’s trying not to step on any toes, that “Cas is a good angel,” and that “[she]’s sure that he’ll make a great man” and “Sam, I know that I left all of a sudden that night but it was so unexpected and my feelings were overwhelming” and “Cas is going to make a wonderful addition to our family, maybe even a husband” and “[Mary] just needs Dean to know this so that [they] can all be on the same side.”
Dean’s still begging, still begging even when Lucifer returns, and Lucifer kicks him then, his boot making contact with Dean’s head and that’s all the damage that he can inflict because Sam presses his hand to the sigil on the blood-soaked wall and in a blinding flash of white light, Lucifer’s been vanquished.
“Cas, come back,” Dean begs then, and Cas moves, reaches for Dean and removes Dean’s hands from his knees and holds Dean’s hands in his own.
Instead, Castiel goes to stand in front of Dean's room and slowly, very slowly, he turns the knob and lets the door creak open and he says, "I want to know what happened to you."
She runs her fingers through his hair, soothing his scalp and, “I’m not,” he says. “I’m not tired, Ai. Really, I’m not.”
For a moment, it seemed like something might happen. Whatever it was, Cookie was unsure, but she narrowed her eyes as best as she could, so that she wouldn’t miss a second of it. Dean swallowed then, clenched his jaw, and took a step forward. His mouth formed a word—
“You can’t let it go, can you?” Sam says and he looks at Dean as if Dean is the pettiest thing that he’s ever seen in his life. “You’re still thinking about those two years when Lucifer possessed him.”
Dean lets out an exasperated sigh. “You’re not supposed to always start with the negative, alright?” he tells her. “Good dreams. You’re supposed to ask about them first.”
Dean nods along, and he’s still smiling, even if it’s only softly, and his eyes are fond like August summer and he says, “I missed this.”

“Bad dream,” Cas says when they’re back in bed and Cas is sitting propped up against the headboard. Dean goes and grabs a spare towel and starts to mop up his hair and skin.
Cas is wrong. After they reject the demon’s proposal as Crowley’s replacement on the throne, Dean pulls him by the hand back to the Impala and wordlessly hands him the keys.
“I told you, Dean,” the city man was saying, in that awfully gravelly voice of his. “I’m fine with what we have at the bunker. I don’t need to buy anything.”
because that stupid selfish bastard can’t just keep leaving Dean like that (hasn’t he told him that enough times?).
“Cas says that you got your act together,” Sam says. “Says you became the perfect devoted husband after I left. Says that you’re thinking of adopting a kid and maybe a cat and guinea pig, too, and that you cook him breakfast every morning and deliver it to him in bed.”
Cue Sam and Dean warily circling the bed, Sam with a net clasped between his fingers, Dean with a bottle of holy water all ready to spritz away every ounce of Satan that the kitten contained. Hell, they were traumatized men, hardened from years of fighting Halloween battles, and they weren’t letting the twisted holiday mess with them this year. With a jerk of his head, Dean motioned for his brother, and after a bit of a struggle (notably chasing the little devil as it evaded Sam effortlessly), the kitten was finally ensnared.
It’s a bit of a challenge cooking the rabbits. The angel watches him move with curiosity burning in his eyes, clueless as to why Dean won’t eat them raw. When Dean asks him for his angel blade so that he can get to skinning them, the angel’s silent.
, and he wonders if it’s another command, if that’s what the letters on the phone screen mean because they say
“Oh, yeah?” Dean says then, angrily, and, “Why’s she here now, huh, Sam? Seems like she couldn’t wait to get outta there last time we saw her.”
“I could erase all of his memories,” Castiel had said, when he had first brought Insufferable Dean back to their plane of existence. “And give him some of…Dean’s memories. I—I built his body back up in perdition…I could…emulate it. He could…be Dean.”
The dentist stands by politely while Dean talks to Cas, when he tries to explain to him that she isn’t trying to bore holes through all of his teeth—she’s just trying to scrape away the gunk.
He can tell Sam is worried. He’s left a few times, visiting Eileen, but never for long. He keeps coming back with things; food and movies and stories, all presented with an over eagerness that makes Dean feel tired. One time, he comes back with a dog—
is forever,’ he says, and the words come surprisingly easily, in the end. He thinks maybe he’s known it for a while, even if he hadn’t imagined in what form; that he and Cas are intertwined, branded into the depths of him along with the handprint on his shoulder. He swallows, slides his palm so it rests on Cas’s neck. ‘I just—I need some time, too.’ He pulls back ever so slightly so that he can look into Cas’s face and pleads for him to understand, tries to put everything that he doesn’t know how to say yet into his eyes.
Dean nods, can do nothing else, but his heart sinks. He thinks of the awful certainty on Castiel’s face, the clarity in his words.
He wants to ask Jack how he’s been, if he still thinks about them, if he misses the bunker. Instead, he clears his throat and says ‘So, how do we find him?’
The sympathy in his face even before receiving an answer makes Dean grit his teeth. He’s most of the way through the bottle and still isn’t drunk enough for this shit. ‘I told you, it was to save me. It was the only way either of us would get out.’ He feels that age-old guilt and self-hatred creeping up in his chest and knows that he’ll have nightmares later that night.
and suddenly knows with absolute certainty that it can’t happen, that he couldn’t bear it. Not after everything they’ve been through. Cas deserves better than him, but he deserves more than what heaven can offer him, too. Dean wants to show Cas the best parts of being human, to wipe his last experience of it from his memory. Wants him to know what it’s like to have a real family, not whatever heaven told him he had.
‘Dean.’ Cas says again, and his voice is a low rumble this close to Dean’s ear, making him shiver. ‘I never… never expected to see you again, and had I known—that is, I don’t expect-’
Dean looks down at the knife that he is cleaning, nods without looking up. It’s the same opinion he’s voiced himself after all, on enough occasions. How could he ever begrudge Sam that? Not when he deserves it more than anyone. ‘Yeah. Yeah, you’re right.’ He forces a smile. ‘You’ve been waiting long enough.’
I’ll see you tomorrow.’ Dean turns impatiently to him and his brother relents, his face set in worry. ‘Say hey to Eileen for me.’
He has no right to ask him to stay, to ask him to give up the most treasured part of himself for someone who can’t even acknowledge the truth between them, but when he tries to tell Cas that it’s his choice, the words turn to ash in his mouth. What comes out instead, the words jumbling over each other, is: ‘Don’t go.’
Sam follows his gaze and some sort of comprehension comes over his face, though there’s no way for him to have guessed all of it. ‘Look, you don’t have to tell me what it was, but… I know how special Cas is to you. How special you are to him. I know how much you must be hurting. You don’t have to pretend you aren’t.’
Dean tries to work out what the look in his eyes is, wonders how much he knows about what happened in the moments before Castiel was taken. Presumably everything—he
The light ahead of him is gradually growing into a definable shape, and he feels his pace pick up, half-running without even looking beneath his feet. He can see a room of some kind; a sort of parody of a room really, with only three walls, boxed in by the darkness like a kid’s dollhouse. As he gets closer, his steps falter.
his mind answers, unbidden. It’s true. He pictures Castiel on the night that they met, a terrifying figure who sparked with alien power and spun Dean’s world on its axis with his every word. That Castiel had no concept of love beyond the one inscribed into him by God’s word, had no thoughts beyond those he was directed to have. Now, while still technically an angel, Cas loves lots of things. Jack, coffee, books, burgers. (Dean?) Sometimes, it’s easy to forget that he’s still an otherworldly being; especially during late nights at the bunker, the remains of a pizza between them, his smiles tired but wide and crow’s feet crinkling at the corner of his eyes when he looks at Dean. As much as he prefers this Cas, the fact that he is responsible for this transformation sits uneasily in the pit of Dean’s stomach. They have dragged him down from Heaven and tore away at his angelic-ness bit by bit, until he bleeds and cries just like the rest of them.
Dean knows it will be Eileen without having to look. He had caught Sam texting her over and over on the way home, seen the grimace on his face. He nudges his brother’s shoulder. ‘Go on. You should go to her.’
‘Dean…’ Sam’s face is full of pity, which only annoys him more. ‘You may not think that you’re worth that, but Cas does. He always has. I don’t think he’s ever believed anything more.’
Dean thinks back to before the angels fell, when Cas was readying to return upstairs forever; tries to look past his own painful memories and remember the peace in his friend’s face, the resolution. Heaven, now that Jack has put things to right, is Cas’s home again: pure and peaceful and just, the way that he always wanted it to be. Even if—and Dean stands by this—every single one of his angelic siblings is a complete dick, Cas has only ever wanted to stand by them, to bring them together. Now the world has finally stopped destroying itself, he can.
And maybe that’s why he loses his concentration, and the witch successfully presses his grubby hand up against the front of Cas’ briefs.
Rowena promises him that his memories will come back. Except there’s a catch. Sam has to avoid anything that could trigger recollections of anything major that might’ve happened in the past year. If he fails, “You’ll go mad,” Rowena tells him, rubbing her hands together with a wicked smile. “All those thoughts would come flooding back at once—we wouldn’t want your wee head to explode now, would we?”
After an awkward silence, Castiel spoke up. “I’m here now,” he said and he shifted on his feet. “You promised Sam and Dean you would tell them what’s happening in Sioux Falls if I came.”
. “We’ll let the townsfolks know that the gas leak is fixed in the morning. Do one last sweep for ghouls and clear out before the real FBI gets in.”
It hadn’t taken days or weeks to get to that point. The very first night that Dean had found him, he’d slept with Cas’ hand in his own, afraid that if he didn’t, Cas would be gone. The second night, tired of sitting up against scratchy tree trunks, he’d asked Cas to lie down with him, had asked Cas to wrap his arms around him so he’d know that Cas was there.
Sam’s voice is strained when he answers, maybe a little bit disapproving, but mostly it sounds as if he is trying to coax thoughts out of Dean, persuade him to think otherwise.
When he plops down into the seat opposite, Dean clears his throat and looks guilty. Cas is in his lap, straddling Dean (they’re really taking this disguise thing seriously), and now that Sam has a good view, are those
“It’s been years, Cas,” he says. “Years and I’ve been with you. I’m—I’m not bringing a girl home. I’m not bringing anyone home.”
Dean had always gone. Not because he was welcome but because Ai had made him, and he’d sit at the steps of the old courthouse where the council was holed away, trying to make himself as inconspicuous as possible.
When he's on the edge of release, with a hand clenched on Dean's shoulder, the angel tells him to look at him.
(about Sam, of course), and Cas is shivering because the brush of Dean’s lips against his ear probably tickles a lot. Just as they must’ve planned it, the shower water drowns out their conversation.
from the gravel biting into him. He can smell the chalky dry dust that Sam’s disturbed with his movements.
“Does it bother you?” Sam says and they’re still watching Cas, both of them, and the agitated man is showing his true colours, is touching Cas in ways that should make Dean’s mouth go dry, and this man wants Cas so bad that it shows.
Cas pushes at his chest, and it’s nothing, that touch, too weak, lacking force, but Dean sets him down.
They stand awkwardly by the door. They’re drenched and dripping wet over the kitchen tiles so Dean is going to nudge Cas and shuffle them outside except Cas is shivering.
“God, Cas,” Dean groans more often than not during those sessions, panting hard while Cas maneuvers. “How many goddamn positions are there? Some of them don’t seem that safe.”
Soon enough, they’re both naked and Dean’s trying to preserve Cas’ modesty by averting his eyes, except Cas is still dizzy and stumbling. Dean catches him around the waist and Cas presses up against his front and then holy shit, they’re skin on skin.
Cas looks at him then, exhales a breath that’s shuddery and warm and tickles Dean’s nose, and Dean swallows and tightens his grip on Cas’ shirt, except how tight can his grip be when his hands won’t stop shaking?
On the seventh night, Cas wakes up and he’s not delirious anymore and when he realizes that Dean’s got his arms around him, Cas jolts and pushes away.
Throughout it all, the angel never promises anything to Dean, maybe because he has no intention of letting him go.
Cas smiles wider, watches Dean as if he knows what Dean’s thinking. And then the angel’s hand on his shoulder drops. Instead, the angel cradles Dean’s face, and in his gaze, there’s nothing but adoration.
“They think you might still be Michael, okay?” Sam says and he runs stressed fingers through his hair and then disappears to do a hundred more tasks.
angel at the wall, all remaining doubts flown just at a peek of wings (and even if it isn’t, he’s not sure that he could pull himself away).
“Hello!” Jack said, right before he took in the scene of his father bloody and unconscious in the demon’s arms.
Sam watches as the two hug it out, foreheads pressed together. Part of him’s relieved that Dean’s taking the initiative to soothe out his own problems, but another part of Sam finds it kinda weird that Dean’s said ‘I love you’ twice now.
“I know I haven’t been here when you’ve needed me,” she begins, “but Dean…Castiel, I wanted to let you know that I’m completely fine with—I love you, Dean. You’re my son. I know that my behaviour lately has been—I’m sorry. I hope you’ll forgive me.”
Now, Ai prods him into finishing most of his meal, boxing up the leftovers for him with quiet threats in case he doesn’t finish. He walks her back to the women’s barracks in silence, carrying her mysteriously heavy hand bag. They stop a few times so that she can talk to the other women heading home for the night, but this place will never be home and Dean knows that.
Sam tries to be gentle. They all have the same story to tell: seduced by a handsome man on the dance floor, always wearing a different face (Sam, Dean, and Cas frown at that), but always picking up victims with numerous tattoos.
But then Castiel looks quizzically down at his chest and pulls the knife out as if it doesn't even hurt.
Belphegor paused and Castiel swallowed, twice, as if completely parched. “I don’t understand,” Castiel said and his voice shook despite himself. “Dean and I…we’re not…I don’t understand why you’re talking about us as if we’re…”
“I’m sorry,” Cas blurts. His voice comes out in a squeak. Cas narrows his eyes at that and mortified,
When Castiel stiffly crouched down to the level of the chair to allow the demon to kiss him, it seemed that this was all that was to happen, nothing more than a quick smack of lips to seal their demonic deal. But Belphegor’s hands which reached up to clasp Castiel’s face diverted their course of action at the very last instant. Instead, they wrapped around Castiel’s throat, dragged the man up and away, out of the devil’s trap, and threatened to squeeze the life out of him.
And oh, how swiftly Dean Winchester’s face fell! How utterly strained and painful his smile looked! And then, oh lord! Mrs. Christian had an epiphany and for what felt like the hundredth time that week, her body shook as homophobic shock overtook her. How had she not seen it before? How had she not noticed how thin their fake-dating pretence was? This godless man, Dean Winchester, was an
“I wish my boy had stayed away,” she says and she doesn’t sound like herself. Her voice is soft, vulnerable like he’s never heard before. “I wish that if he had to go to the angel, he would’ve stayed with her, instead of coming back.”
as always, feedback and kudos are always super appreciated! thank you so much to everybody who's been commenting on this fic <3 your support means a lot! <3
is. And I don’t know when we fell in love, okay? Maybe it was when I thought the leviathans killed you and I couldn’t stop dreaming about it. Or maybe it was when we were in purgatory and you’d watch over me when I slept and you’d run your fingers through my hair and I wouldn’t say anything because maybe you didn’t know that that’s not how two straight dudes are supposed to act. Hell, Cas, maybe it was even that first day when you yanked me out of the pit, and you had me believing in you from the moment I laid eyes on you—I don’t know. I just know I’ve been in love with you for more time than I can count, and I—it doesn’t matter now. It doesn’t because we’re finally together now and you’re living with me and Sam so I don’t have to miss you every second of the goddamn day that you’re gone. I don’t have to make you a mixtape to convince you to stay. You’ve always been there, Cas—when my brother was possessed by Lucifer, when the Mark of Cain made me a murderer, when Mom came back from the dead. All of it, Cas. All of it. And I’m fucking grateful. I
Using Sam’s young memory, they’d looked for another clearing, for two more distinctive trees whose trunks could have been gnarled together, at the base of which Sam had remembered that Cas’ head had rested. Yet an hour of wandering had yielded no results. The only clearing with trees like those had been the one that Bobby had already pointed out.
“Unappreciative,” Dean grumbles under his breath, when he spots Cas furiously tapping away on his phone without a care for Dean’s efforts. After Dean tells him that his sandwich is ready, Cas absentmindedly pats the table, motioning for Dean to deliver.
Dean places the back of his hand to Cas’ cheek then, to his forehead, and there’s sweat there and that’s when Dean sees how delirious Cas looks.
. Sam frowns at him when he sees Dean standing so close to Cas, and it’s not just a hand on the shoulder anymore. Sam watches him, watches how Dean’s got an arm slung around Cas as they observe the latest crime scene, and maybe Sam has an epiphany then. Maybe that’s what gets him to say, “How about Jack and I head over to the graveyard? Save some investigation time by splitting up.”
“Where is your phone?” Cas asks and then Cas is moving, away from Dean, struggling to turn around and Dean moves, too, turns so that his back is against the closet wall and Cas’ back is flush against Dean’s chest.
They’re pressed up together in bed. Cas’ fingers are still running through his hair. Dean’s still pining for another Cas.
“Jack, what happened?” Castiel said, and he came closer, and Mrs. Christian shrieked as both of the city man’s feet disappeared inside her stomach. But it seemed that the men were neither able to see nor hear her, save for Jack who once again looked their way, and his fixation on this particular area of the floor where the two ladies were sitting only had his fathers even more concerned.
“I was dreaming,” he said again, with more confidence, and smiled bigger and brighter. With a flourish, he pointed to all the dishes that Mrs. Christian had knocked to the floor. “I guess I must have been sleepwalking. But it’s, um, okay now because I’m awake, and that means you don’t have to worry about me!”
Six months gone by. Six months since Dean held Cas’ body in his arms, the world going to shit all around them. The portal had reopened and he hadn’t even noticed. He’d been too focused on cradling Cas in his arms. Too focused on running his fingers through Cas’ hair and begging him to stay when he’d already been gone. With Cas’ head resting on his shoulder, holding Cas had felt like holding a child.
It’d felt like a slap in the face hearing the panic in Sam’s voice, when he’d asked. As if he hadn’t been sure that Dean
Eventually, as the minutes tick on, Dean forgets about the prisoner. Eventually, Dean’s pacing his cell, because of course he’s already itching. Because of course he’s already fucking desperate and needy and thinking about
And Cas expects Dean to go on. Cas wants Dean to ramble, like he just did himself, but Dean doesn’t. Dean holds it in, and Cas grits his teeth, feels a weight settle back onto his shoulders and air that won’t leave his lungs and, “Stop it,” Cas says. “Stop doing that, Dean.”
“Well, maybe the drawing’s wrong, Cas,” Dean says and he presses in closer, until his chest is flush with Cas’ back, and he puts his other hand on Cas’ other shoulder, too, holds Cas in place between the table and his own body. “Maybe it’s something you’ve seen before but you just don’t know it.”
—and hell, as if he’s going to do that, when it’s dark and night’s here and…he doesn’t know where he is?
“Revoke your consent,” Sam says just as Cas’ body spasms and Lucifer tries to take the reins again. “Cas, come on. It’s not worth it. We’ll find another way.”
Dean Winchester twiddled his thumbs, or well, Mrs. Christian was quite sure he would have, judging by the nervous expression on his face, if he had not been holding the city man upright in his arms.
—at least, not until Cas had broken that rule. At least not until Dean had tried to show that he was willing to give a piece of his heart to him when he had handed him the mixtape.
And maybe that belief helps him. Maybe it grows and grows the more that he thinks about it, because that stupid, damn hope that he has returns, and maybe—maybe that changes him. With every step that he takes, it’s only with his convictions strengthening. With every step, it’s with that immense grief that he’s been carrying alleviating its burden somehow, its weight, because tonight, he’ll see Cas,
At first, the council had tried to assign him to the hospital ward, noting his aptitude on the nurse portion of their medical exam. But Sam had hastily intervened, too afraid of what the sight of blood might do to him. Sam must have remembered what had happened when they’d first gotten here, two weeks in. Dean had been standing in the middle of the road, gently being steered by his brother towards the soup kitchen when he’d seen Bobby and the other hunter carrying back a dead comrade. With a mop of messy black hair and an angel blade sticking out of his chest, it was no wonder that Dean had lost it.
Cas picks up a leftover penny from the bar counter and starts to fiddle with it. He shifts on the rather hard stool and for the first time, Sam observes that Cas doesn't pretend that his ass is hurting.
“C’mon, Cas, you need hair gel. You can’t go looking like that on your date. You’ve got a freaking bird’s nest on your head.”
Dean falls and from afar he hears Sam shout and then Dean’s lying crumpled at the altar that is Lucifer’s feet. Dean tries to get up, and his eyes are still shut tight because the image of the devil is still out there, somewhere beyond the safety of his eyelids, and he reaches out with his hands, tries to push against the wall for leverage so that he can get up and run, but his hands meet fabric and it’s not the wall. It’s the devil’s knees.
Dean swallows. Dean swallows, clutches Cas' shirt like a lifeline, and then, when their fingers are finally entwined, Dean exhales as if, for the first time in his life, he's finally breathing.
There's quiet then, quiet again like before and then Dean is pressing closer, pressing closer as if such a thing is even possible with the way that they are crushed against the wall, and his nails are digging in again, into Cas’ back, and Castiel doesn’t know why, but both of them start to pant, start to gasp for breath.
He falls onto his back. His wings crumple at his sides. For a moment, Dean freezes. For a moment, all Dean sees is Cas’ body, his wings burnt into the ground, his legs bent in death.
“C’mon,” Dean says, heart fluttering inside his chest, and he offers his hand. “Sweetheart, back to bed.”
The rest of the way there, Rob continues with his digs. How does it feel to love an angel, he says, when an angel did this to your own mother? And Dean can’t
“I’m…” Dean says and he swallows and Cas is already retracting his hand from across the table so Dean grabs it and keeps it in place.
Tuesday night had also been when all the big shit had gone down—the classic showdown, really. Rowena working her magic while Crowley got the crap beaten out of him. Mom and the British Men of Letters. The only downside had been that Sam had gotten knocked out at some point, a dying Castiel the only thing that he’d seen before he’d blacked out. When he’d woken up, things had seemed fine—Dean had been locked up tight in a friendly, brotherly hug with Cas; Crowley had been bitter (probably because he’d been a punching bag). And Mom.
But it hadn’t been animals. When Dean’s distress had magnified at the thought that Cas had been bitten and mangled in death, Sam had reassured him that Cas had looked the very picture of peace, that he’d been well at rest.
“Hey, what did you do to my dad, you big meanie?” Jack said angrily and his eyes began to glow, in the same terrifying gold colour that had made Cookie and Eve invisible in the first place. A strange sound rang over them then, loud vibrations and a feeling of intense pressure, and the last thing Cookie saw was Belphegor’s
, it’s not exactly the easiest to make yourself a forgettable face. But even then the guard grabs him by his necklace again. Inspects it carefully as if he doesn’t know that it’s the infamous Dean Winchester.
They’re on a hunt, pursuing Sam’s favourite mythical monster—not that he’ll kiss and tell—and Sam’s starting to suspect that something may be more amiss in this little town than they’d originally thought.
There are no lights on. Not along the walls. Too dangerous, they’d decided, early on when they’d been constructing the barricade. Night was when demons moved quicker, when the battles between the forces of heaven and hell grew more vicious and human causalities were the highest. So why draw their battles closer with light, the camp had reasoned, when both sides were so prone to using human camps as shields.
When Dean lets his eyes flutter open again, Cas isn’t watching him like he expects. Cas is peering over his shoulder, as if he expects some monster to come swooping down. In the distance, Mary and Monique stand unmoving, frightening shadows in the scarce moonlight.
Cookie, for her part, seemed to be taking quite an interest in Dean Winchester and Castiel today. Over her wire-rim glasses that made her look like a librarian, she was peering intently at them, to the point that even Dean Winchester, despite his gruff and brutish ways, was smiling back at her nervously.
,” he says even as Dean crumbles to the floor. The vial that he’s been holding shatters. “This closet’s making you claustrophobic, Dean. You can breathe. I
After that, it was relatively quick. After Sam handed over a blanket that Dean and Cas shared whenever they went to bed (or well, whenever they fell asleep in the car, which was often), the police’s sniffer dogs found them in a jiffy.
The second Halloween at the bunker had proved to be just as trying. Fifteen vengeful spirits had emerged from their resting places, all hellbent on courting Cas. Dead women had stalked Cas everywhere, tearing the bunker apart with their squabbling as they’d fought each other for his affections. That Halloween, Dean had been especially grumpy, and after Cas had wondered aloud if the spirits could simply be put to rest if he went along with their flirtations, not only had Dean found, salted, and burned all of the women’s remains, he’d also accomplished the said task within a whopping total of thirty-one minutes. In fact, Dean’s research skills had been so admirable that day that Sam had been green with envy for the six hundred and sixty-six hours that had followed this remarkable feat.
The hysterical man ends up in their motel room the next day because he’s a victim being hunted by some weird ass bird monster that none of them have ever heard of and don’t know how to kill.
After that, it hadn’t taken them long to return. The council had decided that it wouldn’t send a good message to the other angels, if they left Cas out there in the woods without doing what they always did to angel corpses. Within hours of returning to the camp, Sam and Bobby had gone back to Cas, for a second time, with other soldiers in tow. Under the moon, they’d marched, following Bobby’s lead, who even at night could navigate the land without ever getting lost.
As if on duty, Cas swiftly changes into the shorts and t-shirt that Dean gives him. Trench coats aren’t allowed in beds. Cas isn’t sure when this rule was invented.
Heck, Cas smiles and he’s dazzling, stunning in a way that Sam’s never noticed before, full flirty while glancing from the waitress to his menu, and that’s when Sam realizes with horror that the waitress kind of resembles their mom—she’s tall, Sam’s height, with light-brown hair that could be almost blonde, and a chubby round face that Mom probably had when she was a kid.
“I don’t like getting my hands dirty, brother,” he says and his fingers around Cas’ neck tighten, “but for Dean Winchester, I’ll give you the courtesy.”
And Dean squeezes his eyes shut. Dean’s a goddamn writhing mess because the angel presses his lips to Dean’s neck, kisses him there, sucks little bruises into his skin, and no matter how Dean struggles to steer himself onto the right path, all he can think of is Cas, all he can think of is rocking their bodies together, getting some friction for his aching hard dick.
Cas expects Dean to be annoyed. Maybe even angry. But he’s not expecting the worry in Dean’s eyes. He’s not expecting Dean’s hands to grasp at his face with a desperation that Cas only ever knows if he is on the brink of death. All Cas has is a small cut on his cheek and Dean’s behaving as if it’s something more.
The curiosity sets in when Dean’s in the middle of fixing up breakfast. It’s not for himself—peanut butter and jelly is special to someone else in this bunker—so Dean glowers a little when he sees what that special someone is doing.
Dean’s eyes seem to roll in their sockets, a brief loss of control as a piercing pain drills through his skull.
“Wasn’t so bad now, was it?” the dentist trills after she’s done and Cas glares at her—he hadn’t found the taste of the fluoride mouthwash appealing.
“I was ashamed to tell you,” Cas says, “so the only way to stop myself from telling you was to stop speaking. I’m—I’m sorry. It’s been so long that I no longer remember how to speak with you anymore.”
Sam hadn’t reprimanded Dean for stealing the Impala, for crashing it, but now Sam’s lips are pressed into a tight line.
It’s moments later that they reach the forge. It’s not empty. Felipe’s not there, but Dean sees his brother, Alejandro. Dean’s dormitory foreman is hurriedly working on angel blades—melting them down, more bullets in case the angel attack that Aarif talked about comes to fruition.
“And Dean, look at Cas, man. He’s sweating buckets. Back up a bit there, huh? Get out of his ass. You’re crowding him.”
They drive home in silence. Sam offers to sit in the backseat but Cas just shakes his head, smiles again, and takes his place like before, as if he knows exactly where he belongs. For hours they go, for hours it’s only the sound of Baby’s wheels on smooth road, and every few minutes, Dean can’t help himself, keeps glancing at the rear view mirror as if to make sure Cas is really there, as if to make sure he’s not dreaming, but Cas never catches his eyes, never looks his way.
“It isn’t your fault,” he snaps and the towel falls to the floor. The dried blood on Cas’ chest is nearly gone. But before Dean can do anything about what remains, Cas lets his grace spill out, small wisps that will do little than clean his body.
“I don’t think so, Dean,” Cas says and starts up the Impala’s engine. Cas drives them home. “I think we can trust the other hunters to take care of it. I’ll call the network tonight.”
And memories of Cas, running his fingers over his naked and shivering body, tattooing him, wedding him, and when Dean looks down, they're there: angel marks covering his entire body, the evidence of what he had done so willingly.
Dean’s grip on Castiel’s coat is desperate. He’s attached himself to Castiel from behind, and he only moves forward because he has to whenever Castiel takes a step.
The longer that the angel’s away and the longer that Dean’s stuck here, the more openly hostile that he gets. Sometimes he forgets that the angel could turn him to ash at a mere whim, but maybe the angel just finds Dean’s frustration amusing.
So, thumbing a finger down the length of Cas' wings, Dean taunts, "I thought you promised Lord Alastair that I wouldn't be able to walk, your highness."
Castiel moves, the urge to run away, and he does. Slowly. Slowly he leaves that room, that same place where he’s seen Dean sit every evening in idleness, the place where he’s spied on Dean without guilt (and he thought without feeling) and he’s making his way down the hall, as if he even really knows this place, this fake, fake place created and resting maybe in Amara’s mind, this place that is not his.
When he wakes up, his head’s feeling kind of funny and he doesn’t really know where he is. There’s a faint memory then, just for a second—a flash of red, bouncy curls and matching lipstick—a whisper of
Dean doesn’t answer right away. Cas can hear him shifting, the jingle of the Impala’s keys in his hands. He must still be in the car. Sam and Gabriel are probably waiting for him. But before Cas can say good-bye, Dean says, “I just want you to be safe.”
Because Cas remembers the last time. Because Cas goddamn knows that Dean’s always been a coward. Because the last time and the time before that and the goddamn time before that, they’d been nothing to each other, nothing like this and now Dean won’t stop kissing him, touching him and Dean can see Cas’ ancient mind working infinitely to figure it out but he still can’t.
When Castiel lifts his own shaking hand and presses it gently to Dean’s face, Dean leans his head and presses his cheek back into Castiel’s touch.
It’s night and they’re in the motel room and Dean’s got his back to Cas again. Sam’s in the other bed right next to them, but it must not matter to Cas because Cas slides up, presses right up against Dean and wraps his arm around Dean’s waist.
Dean takes a shaky breath. Takes her hand. Looks her steadily in the eyes. “Dad’s dead, Mom,” he says, stresses it by punctuating every syllable, “and that monster’s not Cas.”
“Hell no,” Dean snarled, one hand curled into a fist that seemed ready to throw a punch and, as if she’d been expecting this, Belphegor smirked and said, “Suit yourself,” a split second before her eyes closed and her body slumped in the chair, apparently willfully unconscious once more (if only Cookie had the power to do that when Eve was crying).
“Yeah, I’d listen to your brother, Sam. I mean it’s not like everybody’s got a magical healing cranium like you when they take a fall. Another hit like that and, uh”—Belphegor grimaced—“Cas might not survive.”
“He won’t let me out of the house, Cas!” Insufferable Dean cries hysterically over the phone. “He says you’re dangerous!”
to find her. I need to take her back from Castiel. I need to keep our family together. Baba died the same day Mom left. All I had—all I had were my two sisters. And then she went through the g-gate. A-a year ago. We’ve had victims come back years later…changed. Is that—is there a cure to the angel madness, to the claiming marks? Has Castiel promised to release your mother? Is—is that why you’re here, carrying out a mission for them, the angels? Because then…I’d do it, too. I’d do it in a heartbeat.”
this is another tumblr fic. that I published very recently, so you may have already seen it :P I'm still working on figuring out how to compile my shorter drabbles into a coherent story but hopefully, that one will be next and there will be less repetitive content!
“Don’t try to save me,” Cas tells him one day, tiredly, when he’s been passing in and out of consciousness. “I…deserve it.”
. Dean knows that about himself. He’s hopeless because he’s got a lot of feelings swirling inside his chest and he’s not sure how he’s going to survive the next twenty-four hours without blabbing
Beside him, Dean stiffens, shifts even closer until their thighs press together. Cas has the urge to reach out and take Dean’s hand, finds that his chest is aching, finds that he can barely breathe when Jack’s innocent face is staring at him with such fiendish eyes.
Instead, “Traditionally,” Cas says, “the bride would be deflowered on her wedding night. Are you going to deflower me tonight, Dean?”
“Oh, Cookie!” Mrs. Christian had cried and she had thrown her arms around the cook as she had wept. “You don’t have any idea how terrible this morning was for me!”
They aren’t seated for long before a beaming waitress comes over to take their order. The menu is vast and Cas crinkles his nose with confusion, so Dean orders a pizza and says, “We’ll share.”
And then all of the hunger, all of the exhaustion and cold hits him at once as Dean tumbles to the ground.
Here's the first real chapter! Still a little on the short side but they only get longer from here :P
It’s not that because for some reason, Dean just knows that Cas is going to be there tonight, so what has Dean barely keeping himself together is because of what Sam and Bobby had done to Cas six goddamn months ago.
?, but Sam was too overjoyed to care. He pulled the two into a hug, and after that, it was all smooth sailing.
And then Cas is cutting Dean off, and Sam cowers and shakes in his seat because Cas is talking about Sam.
“Sam’s napping,” Dean says, clears his throat awkwardly, like he’s been doing a lot, and Cas doesn’t say anything. Of course he knows. Sam’s pretending to sleep.
It’s so quiet in the room that they can hear static—Castiel’s afraid that if he speaks, Dean will run.
And then Sam learnt exactly why it didn’t matter whether Belphegor had a weapon. In a sudden move that took the younger Winchester by surprise, Belphegor cruelly shoved Castiel headfirst into the nearest object, which was unfortunately a concrete wall. Blood erupted from Castiel’s head, gushing down as Castiel slumped unconscious in Belphegor’s arms. Cookie turned to Dean in her horror, and Dean seemed frozen, as if he’d just witnessed a murder.
It’s somewhere when she’s making a second braid for her own amusement that the clocks in the men’s block sing five. In another hour, the others will be returning from the work day. Another hour after that, and Dean’ll have to go back to the wall.
When Dean enters their bedroom, Cas is curled up on his side, back facing away from the door, still wearing Dean’s old fed suit from the night before—probably still wearing the shirt that they tried to get the blood out of but couldn’t.
Dean can’t help it, every time they fucking talk about it, every time he feels the grief, the fury, at what Sam did back then.
Dean huffs. Brings his knees up to his chest and hugs them. He stares at his feet before he mutters, “Kinda hard to be exhausted, angel, when all I do is sit on my ass all day.”
This time when Dean runs, it’s a lake that comes up, the angel from the wall curled up at its sandy shore. Dean approaches him warily, but tonight, he doesn’t look menacing at all. There are no massive fur coats to hide behind. There’s no goddamn smirk adorning the angel’s features.
“Look at him, Dean,” Sam chastises again. “Look at Cas’ hard situation. He’s all flushed and shivering. You made him so hot, it’ll take him forever to cool down.”
No one had been able to make sense of it all, how Cas’ body could have been transported from the clearing to there. Bobby had craned his neck, stared out into the distance, as if concentrating hard enough could deliver him the answers to this particular mystery.
anymore. He gives Dean a smile even, maybe because there aren’t enough hands to get what needs to be done today or because he’s been too afraid to ask too much of people when they expect a break. So Alejandro nods and says, “Yeah, kiddo, I got something,” and he sends Dean off to do laundry.
Talking on the phone and texting a lot isn’t exactly a symptom of any bewitchment, except for maybe the curse of twenty-first century America.
And Sam feels truly sorry for the guy. Or well, grudgingly at first—it’s a little hard to acknowledge that they fucked up again, missing the witch a second night in a row—and then truly sorry when he remembers the shattered tile in the bathroom where the dude’s head had collided. Dean’s victim only sobs harder when he complains about how his pitcher of beer was knocked over onto Cas, and Sam’s not sure if he’s more sad about the fact that Dean pushed him into a wall while attempting to rescue their formerly angelic brother, or if he’s just miserable that he has to pay for more beer.
“If…if that would make you happy, Dean,” said Castiel, and his voice was quiet and unmistakeably sad, “then I’ll go.”
“We’ll find a way,” Sam keeps telling him. “We’ll start the universe back up again, bring Eileen back. Cas. Everyone who Chuck disappeared.”
“Things aren’t good right now,” Dean says and he mumbles it into Cas’ shoulder. “You left. I was stupid and you left me at the wall.”
Cas is sitting up, panting, drenched in sweat, and he’s moving, heaving himself out of bed, taking a few laboured steps towards the door, and he should be strong enough now, Dean knows, except he’s going to fall tonight.
,” Dean had said with a lump in his throat. “I was and I never told him and now it’s too fucking late.”
Dean takes quick, heaving breaths. Dean panics in the darkness and, I’m drowning, he says. I’m drowning.
"I'm scared, alright?" Dean says. "I'm fucking terrified. I'm not good enough for you. I'm not good enough, Cas, and I don't wanna drag you down with me. I don't—I ruin everything I touch. Cas, I can't—and what if—what if it's all a game, huh? To Chuck? What if he—
His breath hitches in his throat. His heart stutters in his chest like it always does, whenever he sees the angel beyond the wall. Before he can even think, he puts his hand to the grate, clawing madly. Because Cas is there, except he’s on the
and Cas had noticed that), and Sam with satisfaction gets his own matching friendship ring. When Sam sees that Dean and Cas’ rings are engraved, he gets the same engravings, too—they ought to be all identical, right?
Moments later, Dean finds himself being forced up by the council’s guard, Rob. Dean sways and stumbles off the stage—he’s weak from the pain. Behind them, Aarif’s commanded to get Mary. There’ll be no executions tonight, plans cancelled, not when there might be an angel attack imminent. Instead, the citizens are escorted to the safety bunkers, the second time in too short of a time, and the forces are gathered, the soldiers readied to be launched.
“Dean, the many angels in Heaven that I slaughtered is not exactly a fond memory of mine and I’m not sure that it makes me ‘dating material’ as you would say.”
“I know.” Dean’s voice is soft, “but this is the only time we can talk. The rest of the damn day—god, I can’t believe we’re pretending to do what we did for years.”
But Cas doesn’t ask. Cas stays quiet instead. He keeps looking at Dean and Dean’s own eyes can’t do anything but stare lovingly back.
something. Something that Ai won’t say. And it’s the part of the story that Dean never hears. It’s what chills him every time, because he has to remember their conversation about Mom, where Ai had wished Mary dead, and even though it’s been three days since Sam’s call, Mom hasn’t returned and Ai thinks it’s better that way.
As Jack Kline skipped back through the door in the side of the hill, he let it swing shut behind him, but before it could, Mrs. Christian grabbed the handle.
Demons have been raiding entire towns, possessing citizens and ordering them to massacre each other. Crowley says that a lesser demon has been trying to steal his throne and now a civil war has erupted.
But then Sam cowers when the clouds turn dark and thunder rumbles everywhere. He shuts his eyes and tries to keep them out, when the memories turn into his nightmares.
But finally, “Oh,” Castiel said, and his shoulders dropped. “I suppose…that would be okay, Dean. With me. Um, pretending that is. Pretending that I love you. And want to be with you. But pretending, of course. Because you don’t really want me…I understand that. We would be pretending…of course.”
There’s a growl from Lucifer and Lucifer’s writhing, his face contorting with rage as Dean squeezes his eyes shut and keeps rasping out Cas’ name, keeps trying to call to him even when Lucifer’s fingers are trying to crush the life out of him.
i'm super sorry for the delay. i got hit with a bunch of writer's block and this chapter is so, so long that i had to do what i really don't like to do, which is split this chapter into two parts again. i won't be reformatting the two parts into one chapter like i did with chapter six though, so "saturday" will be two separate chapters because put together, i think it might hit like 20k and that is madness. when i started this story, i was so confident that the whole thing would be under 20k so, uh, i guess the story really got away from me haha
. Murmurs more praise as he scans their horizons while Cas quivers against him. For god knows how long, he stays and lets Cas warm his cock, searching for wandering eyes, telling Cas how good he is.
And Dean remembers that, and there’s a hollow feeling inside him, remembering the last couple of months, where Cas had been sicker than Dean’s ever seen anyone be sick, and even now, Cas feels too light in his arms, maybe even lighter than the last time, and it’s terrifying to Dean. It’s goddamn terrifying—they have to find him a cure.
Cas has spent so many years letting Dean manipulate his body that for a moment, he remains tense. For a moment, he forgets to ease up, forgets to play the gentle creature that Sam and Dean are accustomed to, and perhaps it is stubbornness on his part, but he stays where he is.
At night, the chill’s something other. Dean tries not to think about the camp, about being warm and fed and sheltered. Curfew had always been an hour after sunset, and soon after, the start of Dean’s shift at the wall. And then…hours of waiting. Hours before Dean would get what he wanted, when the angel would show up and Dean could indulge in fantasy.
There’s a long silence then, one that threatens to swallow the room, and then Dean’s aware of how late it is and maybe he’s just giving up because he crawls in under the sheets and he just tries to sleep.
“We’re getting a divorce, Sam—you know that,” Dean mumbles and his stomach tangles into a thousand knots with that thought. “It’s just for the case.”
and his face isn't blurry like Cas'. It's sharp and radiant. It's so fucking beautiful that maybe Dean ought to look away, and then there's opportunity to do that, because there’s holy light leaking out of Cas' eyes and Dean can’t help but squeeze his own eyes shut. There’s heat coming from the angel, there’s some strange godly deepness resonating from within him as he says,
Dean scrambles for him. Dean’s so quick that it’s a miracle that he doesn’t bowl the angel right over when he throws his arms around him, and then Cas pulls his own arms around him, too, warm and encompassing. There’s no more wall between them. There’s nothing, and Dean breathes him in. It’s been too long. It’s been months. And now, they’re finally
Dean fumbles for him in the dark, grabs onto him and hangs on for dear life. Cas keeps his arms at his sides, resists every instinct to take a hold of him. Dean buries his face into the crook of his neck and gasps. Dean clutches the lapels of Cas’ coat in his fingers and mumbles about Michael, how he’s still here, how he’s still dragging Dean down.
everything to keep himself from tearing Cas' clothes off and sinking into the heat of his body, fucking him raw until he’s begging for release, until he's begging for Dean to touch him, to touch his
The soldier’s already nervous on his own. When Mary wanders towards the gate, he doesn’t know what to think. But it’s his indecision that’s his downfall. Before the soldier knows it, Dean’s on him, disarming him, knocking him out cold.
“Yeah, yeah, I know,” Dean says. “I know you can take care of yourself. But we all need breaks, okay? You were just kidnapped by demons. So let yourself relax. Put a little monotony in your life, even if it means doing laundry.”
Cookie clutched at her cane, thoroughly confused. What had Dean said to him? What kind of conversation had prompted Dean to ask Castiel to leave the dungeon? Stupidity no doubt! She had such an overwhelming urge to smack the boy on his head that she almost rose to her feet, but Eve was grasping her hand so tightly that she couldn’t get up. Ugh.
Dean swallows and runs his hands over his face, looks towards the cave’s mouth to see if he can still make out the angel leaving, but he’s vanished. The snow coating the ground ensures that it doesn’t get completely dark, moonlight bouncing off like a mirror. But it’s hard enough to see at the back of the cave so Dean has to feel around for Mom, and when he presses his hand to hers, he jolts when he realizes how cold she is.
Dean’s right. There’s a farm on the other side and a house in the distance. When the old lady who owns it opens the backdoor, she sees two men, one bloody and limping and she must be wary because she calls her husband.
At the bunker that night, Dean sits Cas down on his bed in that little room and lifts his shirt up and patches the wound there.
Dean realizes that he’s so distracted that he doesn’t even feel the painful throbbing in his freezing hands.
Well, that's it! I hope it wasn't too boring or weird. I admit I lost steam the further I got into this chapter and I never envisioned Belphegor having such a prominent role haha. You know when you're writing the story and the characters have to go through some motions before you can get to the exciting stuff? That was what this chapter was all about. I'm so sorry I couldn't welcome you guys back with something better!
“My petunias are growing very nicely,” Cas tells him with a toothy grin that soon enough falters, “but the pumpkins have died again.”
Maybe it's just the nature of dreaming. Maybe it's the reality when the angel says that lies don't belong in dreams, because Dean can't hide his frustration anymore. When Dean wakes up, his old plan to woo the angel into submission will be in fucking shambles. And then he'll never be able to get away.
Cas was still hugging Dean when they got to the bunker. Hell, he was really going for those brownie points. And when Sam ushered them inside, the two toddlers were holding hands in a death grip, determined to be together.
Cas is gone for all of five minutes before the dentist comes out and tells Dean, “There’s a problem.”
, there’s—god, he doesn’t know. All he can do is shiver. All he can do is squeeze his eyes shut, just for a moment, because damn it, goddamn it, it’s too much.
Oh, how Mrs. Christian had wept when she had learnt that her husband had foolishly reserved a burial plot for himself in the section meant for homosexuals! That had been one of their most terrible quarrels in the months leading up to his death. When Mrs. Christian had finally resigned herself to accepting his error, she had made enquiries to see how she herself could be interred with her husband upon her death, only to discover with irritation that Woody Farmer had made the same foolish mistake and had made arrangements to be buried in the same plot as Mr. Christian, leaving her no choice but to pick the spot adjacent to her husband as she had been told in no uncertain terms that there was “simply no more space in [her] husband’s plot” for her. When she had demanded why Woody would do such a thing, Mr. Christian had explained to her that it had been a bargain, a two-for-one deal that neither Woody nor Dick had been able to resist, and as money had been tight when her husband had passed, she had reluctantly let it go.
Cas holds him so well. Dean’s curled up with his back to the angel’s chest and it doesn’t seem like he has to worry that Cas will leave him.
At first, he’s okay. It’s only a year that he’s lost, after all, and Dean tells him that he didn’t miss much. Somehow—reason probably being nothing short of a miracle—there had been no calamities, no apocalypses, and Cas had even fallen to become human.
“Great,” Dean said and he slapped a hand down onto the city man’s shoulder. “We’ll start tomorrow then. ’Sides we got that movie night planned for today, anyway.”
to see Dean, because maybe Cas had meant those words that he’d said last time, about not being able to meet Dean anymore, or
“Why’d you leave me?” Dean says and his voice cracks and he says it because it’s at that moment that he just has to goddamn
“But look, agents, it wasn’t all just me, alright? The woman tried to be all caring for the bird but she got impatient, too. The bird ran away once because of his PTSD, I guess, and she got so mad that she stopped caring about it. She was so self-absorbed, agents! She started ignoring the bird and
Dean shifts, presses closer, lets Cas continue talking. Cas leans back, ever the slightest, and for a moment, his back makes contact with Dean’s chest. Dean reaches up and presses a hand to his shoulder. Rubs it up and down the length of Cas’ arm in what he hopes is a comforting gesture. Then he gets back to work.
When Cas turns to him and sees him looking, Dean licks his lips and pushes down the gnawing feeling in his chest again.
In the morning, Sam sees Dean’s face. Sees the hurt and pain and he doesn’t know what’s happened, only knows that it’s day and Cas still hasn’t come out of his room. So Sam goes and knocks and Cas finally hesitantly makes his way down to the kitchen for breakfast, and Dean can’t look at him, feels worse than dying, when Cas brushes past him to get to the peanut butter.
They don’t leave the cave. A week—or at least, what Dean thinks is a week—goes by, and the angel shows no signs of wanting to move. Instead, he’s always gone. Dean never sees him while light is out, but he must stay near, because once or twice a day, there’ll be food at the entrance. Usually a dead rabbit. Sometimes berries and mushrooms or strange-looking fruits that Dean’s not quite sure are edible, or even meant for humans. On one occasion, the angel brings him a deer, and maybe the reason he doesn’t do it again is because he hears Dean cursing, about how the dead animal’s only gonna rot because Dean’ll never be able to eat that much on his own. As if to appease him, that same evening, Dean finds a giant boulder at the mouth of the cave, cracked open to reveal glittering amethyst inside, and a single black feather. Because Dean can’t kick the fucking boulder to show his sentiments in return, he stomps the feather into oblivion and kicks it back outside.
Dean shakes his head. ‘It’s not fair. That isn’t a choice. I can’t ask him to give up his grace, not even for—for this.’
that’s what’s bothering me.’ Dean snaps at him, but he knows the truth is plastered over his face. He finds himself looking at the discarded jacket on his bed, at the corner of the red handprint still imprinted there. He swallows.
The days pass, and Dean sleeps constantly, feels less and less like dragging himself out of the darkness of his room. His dreams are fractured, memories reappearing and twisting in his head. Jack is often there; sometimes as an uncertain boy sat across the table from him, other times a godlike entity that stares at Dean through glowing eyes and throws him into nothingness. A few times his parents appear, eyes heavy with worry. Mostly he sees Cas; Cas consumed by souls, Cas standing in a lake, Cas murmuring
Dean rolls his eyes and tries to loosen the tightness in his chest. ‘I’ll be fine. C’mon man, she wants to see you.’
‘Billie. She trapped us, down in the basement. We had no way out, and Cas, he—’ Dean feels his chest contract and takes a long breath, jaw set. ‘He saved me. And now he’s gone. The Empty took him.’
‘It’ll get you out the bunker.’ Sam offers, ignoring Dean’s glare. ‘And the owner likes classic cars.’
But Dean can’t stop. His research is at the back of his every thought, swirls around his head before he goes to sleep. If he stops, he will be lost, and Castiel will be truly gone, and all of this will have been for nothing. Sometimes it feels like it’s all that’s holding him together.
Sam appears in the doorway, bag slung over his shoulder, and Dean feels rather than sees the weight of his gaze. He sighs. ‘Sam, go.’
but this is a lifetime, a sacrifice of a different kind. He needs something; deserves some kind of reassurance that Dean isn’t dragging him into a mortal life on earth where he will be alone, again. Dean knows this, and yet even after two months, it’s still too much; everything is tangled up inside him and he isn’t
Dean spends hours going through the bunker’s books, until his eyes are red and a headache pulses around his temples. The Empty isn’t mentioned anywhere.
Dean made him sound like that, crushed the feeling out of his voice. He feels the same hollow sensation that he’s been living with for weeks; except this time, he has put it there himself. He’s a coward.
‘He, uh, he said-’ He stops. Somehow the admission had stumbled out by itself, made easier looking at the blankness of the wall behind them instead of into Sam’s face. Yet his whole body seems to fight against saying it, as if by saying it aloud, it will set the words loose into the world, making it real. Making it something that he has to confront. He closes his eyes, forces the words out. ‘He said he loved me, Sammy.’
Jack gives him a long look. ‘Castiel had made peace with himself, when he chose to initiate that deal. I’ve found a way out for him, but he has a big decision to make.’
His phone buzzes insistently on the floor from where he had thrown against the wall on its third ring. He picks it up, thumbing away a piece of broken glass. ‘Sam?’ His voice is a hoarse rasp and he clears his throat, scrubs a hand over his mouth.
It’s a done deal almost as soon as Dean pulls up in Baby, who is promptly bestowed with so much admiration by the garage owner that he almost starts feeling jealous.
Dean looks around them, at the two corpses by their feet and the bag of weapons by the door and the smear of blood on Sam’s face. It isn’t a life that anyone would choose.
Dean feels a wash of relief at not being pushed away, grips him closer. ‘Thank God,’ he mutters absently, only catching the irony in his words a second later.
who has spent his entire time on earth sacrificing everything for other people? Who has lost his home and his powers and, on more than one count now, his life, all for Dean and Sam? If they really are finally free to take their own paths, Cas deserves to choose for himself; however limited his options. And the only place where that can lead, now, is heaven.
‘Why d’you have to do it?’ he finds himself demanding aloud as if Cas can still hear him, his voice thick. ‘Why d’you always have to
Sam doesn’t say anything for a moment, and Dean can sense him working through his words in his head. He feels oddly nervous, considering he hasn’t really admitted anything himself.
Dean winces at the words but waves a hand to the chair in the corner; the one that Cas has sat in so many times as they went through their endless cycle of fighting and grudgingly apologising.
Dean feels a flash of guilt for having been too absorbed in his own grief to even ask his brother about Eileen. ‘I- Yeah. Yeah, we will, Sammy.’
although still trapped, and there’s a way to save him, and all of this has been for something. Except that it means ripping out Cas’s very being.
Dean slumps down into a chair at the table, takes another swig of beer. The bunker is quiet but for the usual soft creaking in the walls, a breath of wind outside the door. He looks at the place that has become their home, remembering; the spot where Kevin and Sam had played endless games of chess, where he and Sam had gotten to know their parents in all the wrong order, where Cas—
He has ended up supporting himself against the car, Jack’s arrival and his news proving far too much for his body on a couple hours of sleep. His mind whirls. Cas is
dog, the one that Chuck had stolen away. Sam names him Miracle, and he immediately makes himself at home in Dean’s room, appearing at the foot of his bed each evening. Dean grumbles and complains until Sam goes to bed, then lets the dog curl up against his chest for the night, his ears tickling his chin.
‘But what was the deal? What did Jack mean about letting himself be happy?’ Sam probed, his face pinched in that annoying nosy-little-brother way. ‘There’s something you’re not telling me.’
Dean pretends not to notice how his chest constricts at the words, the tilt of his head, which reminds him so much of Cas that it hurts a little. ‘Jack. You finally back to remembering we exist?’ His voice is tight. Two whole months.
‘The one and only,’ Dean somehow manages, utilising a lifetime of repressing emotions in order to batter down the panic rising in his throat. He steps forward again, aching to reach out and reassure himself that Cas is real, but stops when Cas takes a step back instead.
Dean rests his elbows on the table, steeples his hands beneath his chin and begins to pray to their new God.
He doesn’t know how much time has passed by the time he stumbles to his feet. His limbs are cramped and painful from being tensed for so long, hands trembling from being caged around his face. He doesn’t have to touch his face to feel the stick of dried tears. His stomach churns.
Dean ignores it and takes the opportunity to step forward and grab his shoulders, yanking him into a hug. He feels warm, and solid, and alive. After a moment, his arms tighten around Dean’s back, and he sighs into his shoulder.
Sorry for the delay in updating, this chapter was a real struggle for some reason – I’ll try to post the next update sooner! Thank you so much to the lovely people who have left comments ♡
The vice that had formed around his chest and the hot spike of tears have faded, leaving something hollow and empty. He wonders if it will ever go away.
‘Yeah. He uh, he does shit like that now.’ Dean feels an unexpected flash of fondness for the fact that Jack and Cas’s dream space is the bunker’s kitchen, of all places, but it’s quickly buried by everything else. He wonders exactly what Cas’s reaction had been to Jack’s transformation, if he had had any idea of how things were going to go. ‘But Cas, I—you gotta know, we’ve been trying
He feels himself starting to drown in the darkness and the silence and the pit of memories that is ever waiting at the back of his mind, and clenches his fists against his sides. He doesn’t have time for this, not when Cas’s future is on the line.
hits Dean like a brick wall. He skids to a halt right at where the darkness turns into worn bunker flooring and feels the rush of adrenalin that has been pulsing through him since he arrived in the Empty flood to his head.
‘Uh, thanks.’ He muses on that for a second, wondering exactly what for, before pushing it to the back of his mind. He takes off in the direction of the light, refusing to let himself look back at where Jack is standing, motionless.
Eventually his brother pulls back to look at him, keeping one hand on his shoulder. ‘Wow.’ He doesn’t look nearly surprised enough. More like relieved, Dean thinks suspiciously. ‘Dean, that’s… how do you feel about it?’
, a complete mess of a human being. What he couldn’t explain was his own reaction. His inability to move away, the weird energy that seemed to crackle between them when they were alone. He dealt with it by turning it into a joke, would roll his eyes and complain, ignoring the way that it sometimes made his heart flip and sent a flush down his neck. He knows that Cas isn’t this way with Sam. He has seen his brother’s little knowing looks, usually full of amusement, then sometimes something much worse; something soft and understanding, even sad, that makes Dean feel unsettled.
He knocks softly at the door, and Dean knows what is about to happen even before it does. He grunts in an affirming sort of way, knocking back another mouthful of whisky, and tries not to think about the last time that he drank from it; clinking glasses with Cas while he smiled warmly at him. His stomach twists again.
It’s over. Chuck is gone—and Jack with him in a way, to a place that they can’t follow. No more grand plans, or angels and demons following in their footsteps. Their lives are their own once more.
-like way, and blinks. ‘I- have you been listening to me? What are you doing about Cas? Unless you’re too
Sam knows the moment that he sees him, stops dead when Dean appears in the doorway. He wonders what he looks like, if his face is as wrecked as he feels.
He finds more and more cases for them, finds answers in police reports when he can’t in the bunker’s collection of lore.
‘It doesn’t matter.’ Dean cuts in, his heart jumping. ‘He’s gone. It took him, because of me. He said it would be forever.’ He hears his voice falter on the last word and grimaces
Dean can feel his eyes burning into the side of his face and looks away. He knows Sam had heard him afterwards, begging Jack to fix it all as he walked away, demanding why he couldn’t fix the Empty too. Had seen him behind the building after Jack disappeared without a word, his knuckles red where he’d punched the wall again and again, eyes hot with tears. He wonders if his brother can tell how hollow he feels, like his insides have been scooped out; if it’s obvious how he feels like their victory is something that happened to someone else.
Now is the moment that they should—normally, would—pull apart, but neither of them moves. Cas is caught so tightly against his chest that when he lets out a breath, it is hot against the side of Dean’s neck. As if a switch has been flicked, the moment is suddenly irretrievably altered, and Dean becomes extremely aware of the way that their bodies are pressed against each other. He freezes, and they breathe together slowly, neither wanting to look each other in the face. Dean feels something melt away inside his chest from the feeling of his arms encircling Cas’s shoulders and desperately doesn’t want to move a second forward in time, when all of this will inevitably be ruined again.
Cas is watching him, his decision teetering on a knife point, and Dean forces himself to push it all aside, lets himself be guided by the fragile thing inside him that he’s tried so hard to bury. He lets go of Cas’s arms and shakily reaches up to his face; cups his hand around the edge of his jaw, his thumb almost brushing his bottom lip. Cas’s skin is warmer than he expects, and his eyes are huge, impossibly blue, pupils darkening. He looks almost scared, like he’s waiting for the jig to be up and all of this to vanish into smoke.
Sam opens his mouth to argue, but his phone starts to buzz on the table beside them. He snatches it up and stares at the screen for a moment, lets out a relieved huff that seems to relax his entire body.
‘Sounds about right.’ Dean says with false bravado, biting out anything that will stop him descending into panic again. ‘That l- caring about me is a one-way ticket to emptiness. Makes perfect fucking sense, actually. He never did learn.’
. In some ways he would understand more if it was Sam that had been chosen, his gentle little brother, who had made plenty of mistakes but had always been a fundamentally good, selfless, kind person. Instead, Cas rebelled for Dean. An angry, messy alcoholic who was more comfortable pulling the trigger of a gun than being an actual human being. And in return for Castiel’s loyalty, Dean has done nothing but hurt him, cut him out of their lives, froze out his efforts to be close with him even though it made his chest ache each time. But it’s better this way, he’s always told himself. He and Sam are better off by themselves, unable to hurt anyone around them. And Castiel, for all his mess-ups, deserves better than whatever he has to offer.
‘I’m fine. I just need to get him back.’ Dean finds himself saying, except instead of the firm statement that he intended his voice comes out embarrassingly plaintive, even wobbly. He goes to take another drink to cover up the slip, but Sam is already pulling him into a hug with one arm, patting his back comfortingly. Dean remembers doing the same thing whenever Sam had burst into tears when they were kids, and is slightly perturbed by the role reversal as his face is smushed into his brother’s shoulder.
Dean can feel the panic sliding up his throat, spreading coldly over his insides. ‘No. It won’t be like that, Cas. I promise. The bunker is your home.
‘I—all of it, Dean. The hunting, the constantly being sure one of us is going to end up dead, losing everyone around us.’ Sam runs his hand through his hair agitatedly, leaving a splotch of blood on his forehead. ‘I want us to have actual lives.’
Dean thinks of the fight that Castiel underwent to get his grace back before, the last time that he fell. The miserable few months that had been his experience of humanity, abandoned by his friends and turfed out without a roof over his head. He swallows. ‘And if he doesn’t?’
He reads it again, and again, and again, the paper slowly creasing beneath his fingertips, and then suddenly he can’t anymore, because his vision has blurred. He angrily goes to scrub at his eyes then gives up and lets out a sob into his hands; a horrible, desperate sound in the relentless silence. He cries for Cas, who had opened his heart so many times and was at peace with receiving scraps in return. He cries for both of them, and the way that the world had conspired to keep them apart again and again; the way that it had done it forever. Most of all, he cries for himself, and the fact that, at the same time that he was convincing himself that he’d warped their relationship in his own head, Castiel was rooms away, staring at his greatest secret amid a collection of love poetry.
‘Dean, the last time I was human…’ Cas shakes his head, and the hurt in his eyes is almost too much to look at. ‘I can’t do that again.’
Everything in him recoils at the statement, as if he has cut a part of himself open, but he sets his jaw. If Cas was able to say it so easily to his face, the very least he can do is acknowledge that it happened.
He sinks into the chair by the desk, feeling every loss that they have had to face this year like a physical weight on his shoulders. The papers in front of him rustle with the movement, escaping onto the floor, and he is reaching to scoop them back when one catches his eye. It’s a ripped page from a book, the paper soft and yellowed—which is the main reason it distracts him, really, because Castiel treats his novels like some sort of sacred texts, getting a grumpy look on his face when they are left dog-eared or cracked open at the spine. Dean lifts it towards him, peers at the text at the top identifying it as John Clare poem.
He’s heard the words come out of Cas’s mouth before, always in what he thought were his last moments. He’d told Dean and Sam that they were his family, that he loved them. Once he’d stared into Dean’s face as he said it, eyes fierce, and Dean wondered if … but this is different. It’s laying the quiet space between them bare, putting into words the thing that Dean had accepted was never going to be acknowledged. It feels like he’s broken an unspoken rule, pressed a reset button on everything they understood about each other.
‘We will.’ Sam says, with a confidence that Dean wishes he shared. ‘Cas always finds his way home.’ The
There’s a long pause where Dean tries not to show the fact that his stomach has dropped into his boots. ‘So, what. You’re just gonna leave? And go where?’ He realises as soon as he says it that he knows exactly where, that
His brother knows him well enough to know when he’s fighting a lost cause (sometimes), and clambers inelegantly to his feet, confiscating the rest of the whiskey bottle as he goes. He pauses at the door, face contemplative. ‘It might not feel like it right now, Dean, but you’re lucky. Lucky to be loved like that by someone.’ He smiled sadly. ‘We both are. Now we just need to fight to get them back.’
Dean feels his frustration building, the same pain that he’d felt when he’d left Cas behind in purgatory, the first time. It’s unfair, but it’s easier to deal with than the storm of guilt that is pressing down on his chest, so he embraces it. ‘So, you’ve had a way out all along, while I’ve been—while we were grieving you. And instead of sharing that with us, you’ve been sat doing what, reading fucking
It’s not until later that night, when the three of them have retreated into their rooms and Dean is drinking himself into oblivion on his bedroom floor, that Sam confronts him.
to this, Dean. Half of our lives, probably more. I want to decide what I do with the rest. See places, learn stuff. Have—maybe have a family, some day.’
‘Forever?’ Cas asks, and Dean knows he’s asking about more than just a place to live. Perhaps his happiness really was in
The agitation in his voice makes it sound like Dean has sunk a knife into his chest, not called out his name. He jumps to his feet as if burned, eyes comically wide. His hands splay at his sides as if he isn’t sure what to do with them.
Dean inches closer than he’s ever dared before, until Cas’s eyelashes are flickering inches from his own, and he feels the softness of his sudden exhale on his chin. His heart skips a few beats and he closes his eyes for a moment, breathless. Cas tilts forward ever so slightly so that their foreheads meet, and he feels something inside him break a little.
Cas corrects him, making Dean grit his teeth. ‘I’m sorry, Dean. But this isn’t an easy decision for me.’
Dean takes in his familiar profile and messy hair and the slight curve of a smile on his face and feels his breath catch in his chest. He never thought he’d see any of it again.
Cas watches him and Dean knows he recognises it, like he always does, like he’s looking past Dean’s face and into whatever secrets he hides inside. Moments pass and Dean
Sam’s voice is unexpectedly heated, and Dean looks up in surprise. ‘After everything we’ve been through with Chuck, don’t you see what this means? How important it is? Cas used his free will, out of love for you.’ Dean winces slightly at the words, spoken so casually. ‘Just like he always has, from the beginning.’
‘Won’t.’ Jack admits. ‘I don’t want to world to become what it did before. Heaven, hell, earth, they all need rules to allow them to work, to stop them tearing each other apart. And that all starts with allowing angels to wreak havoc down here.’
‘He’s gone.’ Dean wonders at how level his voice is. He sounds gruff and angry, which he supposes is better than choked with useless emotion.
‘Well, he shouldn’t have.’ Dean doesn’t know why he sounds angry, again, when he just wants to curl up in the corner. ‘I’ve never asked him to. I’d rather be dead than keep having him—having anyone die for me.’
The relief that rushes through him leaves him feeling like his strings have been cut, his knees trembling.
His brother pulls a face, but he is turning back to the phone, unable to mask the delight in his face as he taps a reply. Whatever she responds with makes him bark a laugh and then he is away, a spring in his step as he heads into his room to grab his bag.
Eventually, Dean suggests that they start hunting again. He kills a vampire and remembers how at home a knife feels in his hand. When they rescue a set of young children one day, returning them safely to the police, he feels a flicker of something in his chest that has been dormant for weeks.
It’s when they’re in a dusty corner of Ohio, cleaning their knives after ganking a pair of werewolves, that Sam comes out with it.
Dean stares at him, feeling like he’s been punched, though he doesn’t really have a right to. ‘Did you…ask him not to tell us?’ He doesn’t get a reply, which is an answer in itself. ‘Cas, I thought you were
‘Well, good for him. Now he’s dead—forever, apparently—and I didn’t get a choice in any of it. Didn’t even get a chance to say anything.’ He didn’t mean to let the last part slip out, but slams his mouth shut too late. He braces himself, takes another swig of whiskey.
‘You—’ Dean forgets who Jack is for a moment and advances on him, wrench in hand, his fists clenched. ‘You’re telling me Cas is alive, he’s free, and you just didn’t bother to tell me? What, me praying to—all the times I’ve spoken to you, that wasn’t enough?’
He doesn’t know what this is yet, still doesn’t understand how his own desires can ever align with an angel’s.
Sam edges cautiously around the door like an overgrown deer, his expression so nervous that it would be comical at any other time. ‘Dean? Can we-’ he pauses as he takes in the almost-empty bottle, and frowns disapprovingly. ‘Can we talk?’
He has thought plenty about finding Cas alive and what he’d really meant and the decision that he was going to have to make and what Dean is meant to say about it. Less so about what Cas would think of him turning up out of nowhere, fresh out of answers on how to address their last interrupted conversation.
But Cas is… Cas. A literal angel, whose friendship is something that Dean still doesn’t understand, years and years on. He used to lie awake at night questioning it: why
bleed and cry, emptied out his heart through a sheen of tears that made Dean freeze in panic, and then he was gone, forever.
There’s a long pause and Dean glares at him, having reached his emotional limit. ‘I’m gonna go to bed.’
‘Please.’ It’s downright selfish, and he hates himself, but he’s crowding forward to grab Cas’s arms, gripping so hard that he has folds of trench coat between his fingers. His heart is hammering in his chest. ‘Stay with us. Stay with me.’ Something desperate is crowding up inside of him, the sort of confession that he has only ever allowed himself to make when Cas wasn’t there to hear it. ‘I
He doesn’t. ‘He said something to you, didn’t he?’ he says, peering into Dean’s face. ‘Before he was taken. That’s what’s bothering you.’
Dean listens to his soft footsteps down the hall and, despite himself, finds himself mulling over his brother’s words. He doesn’t think he’s often thought of himself as lucky before.
Dean is distracting himself by working on the Impala, back from a weekend visiting Jody. His mouth hurts from smiling for them all, he and Sam’s family, who know what’s wrong but don’t have the words to help.
The whole thing sits awkwardly in his memory, like a speech from a stranger. He doesn’t think this is how it’s supposed to feel; pain and fear and confusion, instead of the blissful happiness that had settled on Cas’s face. He ought to be grateful for such open, fearless honesty, but instead it terrifies him, makes him want to run until he doesn’t have to think about it anymore.
Without anyone else beside him, the darkness becomes everything. It feels crushing, disorientating. Dean goes to reach for the knife in his pocket, then comes to the prompt conclusion that it probably isn’t going to work on anything here. If he’s honest, he thinks he’d rather the screams of hell or the bleak, colourless miles of purgatory to such total emptiness. It’s a grim destination for beings that are supposed to be immortal. He thinks about the fact that Cas has spent two entire months here alone, all because of him, and his stomach clenches.
‘Not like this he hasn’t.’ Sam refutes him, with rather unjustified certainty for someone who wasn’t actually in the room at the time. ‘Wait, that means…’ He frowns, then understanding floods his face. ‘Permission to be happy, that’s what Jack said. And he let himself be happy by…’
Sam walks towards it, then appears to think better of it and folds himself up on the floor beside Dean instead, face set in a rather determined way. Dean feels a sense of foreboding, but barely has time to prepare himself before Sam launches into it.
‘He’s perfectly comfortable, I made sure. But removing an angel from the Empty comes with a cost.’ He pauses. ‘It might help if you spoke to him yourself.’
Cas goes very still and doesn’t speak for a moment. His hands loosen around Dean’s back and he steps away slightly, extricating himself from Dean’s arms. ‘Yes.’ He says, and the word is odd; stiff.
Dean traces the place on the table where Cas’s name is scratched into the wood, lets the splinters catch at his fingers until they have broken the skin.
The words thrum brokenly in his chest the same way that they had that night, as if they have a heartbeat all of their own. They still don’t feel real. He half expects to eventually find Cas and discover that he has no memory of the event, that Dean has crafted the entire thing in his head, from the tears in Cas’s eyes to the page of poetry in his room. It would make more sense than the way that Cas had peeled back Dean’s very soul in a few words, as if it were easy, or the way that his voice had trembled as he said the phrase that Dean hadn’t even dared let enter his most private thoughts. It would be a damn sight easier to believe than the idea of Cas thinking about the concept of love as something for himself, rather than a fascinating human oddity to tilt his head at until Sam and Dean roll their eyes at him.
The offer barely warrants an answer, of course; his mind was made up before Jack had even spoken. ‘Do it.’ Dean says simply, and no sooner have the words left his mouth than his world disappears around him, and he is falling deep, deep into darkness.
Whatever it is that has somehow made Cas stick around, though, is something that Dean puts off examining too closely. He’s an ancient being who has been present for the earth’s history, has seen actual miracles and magic and wonders. Whatever his time with Dean and his brother means, it’s a blip in his life; one filled with blood and betrayals and loss. If he does love them—him—it has to be an incomprehensible, self-sacrificial sort of love, between an angel and the humans he has sworn to protect. Dean has spent enough time with angels to know that their concept of emotions is light years away from anything mortal. It certainly doesn’t extend to Dean’s scrambled idea of love; an image that is now far from his old dreams of a family and a white-picket fence, simplified to dinners and old movies and having the same person to come home to and wrap himself up with each night. How could a being that can turn off their need for food or sleep at will possibly be consumed by what humans call love, with all its messy feelings and misunderstandings?
Cas is everywhere, from the plants that he’d started collecting on the sideboard to the worn chair where Dean has sometimes found him reading, his feet tucked up underneath him like a kid. He is there in the place on the floor where a different Dean, with the mark burning on his arm and the taste of blood in his mouth, had punched and kicked him to a pulp. Where he hadn’t fought back once, even when he lay broken on the ground; just wrapped his fingers around Dean’s wrist and pleaded with him not to leave.
Baby: Dean. Please tell Mary to call me. She’s not picking up. The doctor has done something to your memory. You can’t seem to remember where the bunker is located. I’m very worried, Dean.
Dean makes an unhappy sound low in his throat, wants Cas to know that he feels the same, and he looks down at his feet, clenches his jaw. But Cas’ fingers travel there. Cas’ fingers massage the tension away and then he opens his arms, lets Dean settle in against his chest.
But after he’s out of there, he shakes. He shakes violently and he stumbles through the back door of the soup kitchen like he’s lost. He’s not supposed to be here. He’s not on the job anymore. But Ai takes one look at him and ushers him inside.
For hours, Dean prays that the goddamn soldiers from the camp will find them, because at least the camp means
robe and he’s breathing harshly, through his nose, and he’s staring at Castiel with desperate, desperate eyes.
And it’s true. Dean’s dizzy. As if to prove it, another hunger pain wracks his body and he clutches at his stomach. The angel tilts his head, tilts it in a way that painfully brings up memories of Cas rushing through Dean’s mind. Dean swallows and looks away, shivers when the angel holding his hand brushes his thumb across Dean’s knuckle.
When it starts feeling too warm, he undoes the buttons on the trench coat that he’s wearing. But a moment later, he’s gripping the pyre just to keep steady.
Cas starts walking through the current, sure and steady, through rushing rapids that go up to his waist. Dean tenses, nails digging into the bed's mattress as he watches, as second by agonizing second, the angel gets nearer, hair damp and clinging to his forehead. And then at last, with his wings dripping water onto the soil, he's finally
, ever since Tuesday night two weeks ago when Dean suddenly decided to block the King of Hell’s number, Sam’s life has been
“Just missed it,” Dean says, panting, and they stare at each other and wonder how Cas is naked and wielding a knife
There’s a bright white light as it shatters, a thousand pieces raining down to earth, and in a split second, the universe and everything in it comes back in an instant.
“He fucked me, Sam,” Dean says and god, the fury. The fury. “He fucked me like I was nobody and he left.”
And god, Dean’s there pounding at the grate. And god, it works so well, and Cas must know it does, because Cas keeps moving away, slowly, slowly and it just drives Dean mad.
that he’ll yank until he’s pressed up against the angel, an arm encircling his waist as the angel’s wings hide him from view.
Sam’s up and sitting in his bed, pretending to load his gun with witch-killing bullets, and when Dean and Cas see him, they freeze.
And Cas wants to say something but hearing Dean’s complicated love confession makes Cas’ heart stop.
It happens that he hears whispers, eventually a break to the endless silence, and then it grows into chatter, loud, loud excited conversation in Enochian. There are smatterings of light in places, flashes, and every flash illuminates a fearsome form, taller than mountains, some bodies with multiple heads, other with more wings.
But these weren’t the things on her mind at first. As soon as the demon opened its eyes, fright overtook her, and combined with Eve’s senseless sobbing, Cookie couldn’t help but look to the Winchesters in her apprehension, maybe because she was hoping very hard that if they intended to worship the entity before them, they would at least be able to control it—enough to prevent the massacre of the entire town and all its residents. And it was because of these concerns that Cookie Baker noticed that things were clearly not right from the get-go, because Cookie had never seen three men more at unease with themselves than she saw that day.
It’s what he says because of course it’s his name that comes unbidden to his lips. He calls out again and again, prays to him, to help him, to save him, until eventually there’s nothing leaving his mouth except the most pitiable of all sounds.
After all the public punishments had been carried out, after all the executions that Dean had never been allowed to go to, at the end of the month, the camp had held a celebration by the square bonfire, an extra meal for every hungry mouth that showed up.
Those are the astonished words that follow him even as he makes it up to the doorstep of the women’s barracks.
Sam takes a moment to respond. Even after thousands of texts over the years, Sam’s not exactly sure how to emulate Dean best. Sure, his brother swears a lot and says a lot of things that don’t really make sense, stuff like, “You don’t take a joint from a guy named Don, and there’s no dogs in the car,” so it’s no surprise that Sam’s having a little trouble.
If Dean saw what his words did to Castiel, he didn’t let on, but if Cookie’s suspicions were correct, the poor boy was in fact hopelessly oblivious of how much Castiel loved him. Dean came closer to his friend, pressed his hand to Castiel’s arm and maybe, in a moment of weakness, moved it to clutch Castiel’s face. Castiel looked back at him sombrely, such heartbreak evident in his eyes that Dean's hand on Castiel’s face gentled, his thumb stroked Castiel’s cheek, and then he smiled. He smiled at Castiel, and it was painful and forlorn, thought Cookie, because it seemed he couldn’t keep his smile in place. The corners of his mouth quivered, and
He hides. He calls in sick for work so that he doesn’t have to leave the safety of his home (he’s taking no chances!), and he curls up into bed with ice cream and wine and rewatches
But Dean hadn’t paid him any attention. Not when he’d still loathed him and Sam for what they’d done to Cas’ body. For what they’d done by extension to Dean.
It seemed, however, that once again, she had not missed much in the way of their conversation despite having had a mental breakdown just now. Cookie had arrived with their lunch, and she was smiling warmly at the pair holding hands across the table. At her arrival, the two pulled their hands away, though did so in such a lingering fashion that Mrs. Christian wondered if they wanted to let go at all. After Cookie once again departed, neither man moved to pick up a fork or take a sip of their milkshakes, and then, after what felt like an eternity, Castiel reached across the table and placed his hand on the side of Dean Winchester’s face and, smiling fondly, said, “Thank you, Dean. For the backstory.”
But it’s Sam’s glance at him every time that it happens that makes Dean’s heart skip a beat, makes his hands clammy and makes him feel anxious; it gets to him (it’s a goddamn warning to keep himself from Cas).
Samuel Winchester, by all accounts, was not a bad man, thought Mrs. Christian, and in fact reminded her of her late husband on account of his giant body, but now seeing him holding a shotgun, she could not idly wonder if there was not some family drama afoot. Perhaps he had come, outraged at his brother’s homosexual lifestyle, and was here to set him straight. But then Mrs. Christian remembered that Dean Winchester had spoken of his brother being possessed by the devil and Mrs. Christian slumped against her husband’s tombstone for the third time that night.
Belphegor grins, starts moving ever so closer, as if he intends to kiss him. Cas should smite the creature before him, should turn its body to dust, but it’s
But the city man did not budge. Instead, he reached for Dean Winchester’s hand, and at this, the freckled hoodlum’s face softened. He crouched down beside the city man, balanced his free hand on Castiel’s knee while keeping his other hand firmly entwined with the city man’s, and there was a strange expression on Dean Winchester’s face, and Mrs. Christian reasoned, that perhaps it was simply the angle of his head at just that moment but it looked as if Dean Winchester wanted nothing more than to kiss Castiel right there and then.
for days. All the while, Castiel’s aggressive packages don’t stop, although they start getting really weird, enclosed with things that are uncool like pictures of Impalas, and some dude named Sam Winchester. There are even manuals on how to get out of something called a “djinn dream” when you’re really in some major denial.
He keeps calling Cas to their cases. Keeps smiling like an old lover’s come home whenever Cas poofs in.
Dean’s awake and he thinks that Sam’s asleep but he’s wrong so Sam hears everything that Dean whispers to the night.
The bird monster lingers, continues to circle the room but looks indecisive, doesn’t go after Sam but isn’t able to find the three men hidden in the closet either—its sense of smell must be deficient.
It’s what he demands of Sam when he finds him. Sam is in the library as usual, on his laptop where the Wi-Fi never seems to fail, but he gets to his feet when Castiel storms into the room.
He shakes his head, when she pauses to hear his answer, and it’s true. He’s wide awake. He’s thrumming with energy, god knows why, and maybe there’s a bit of impatience to it. Maybe he just can’t wait to be himself.
, Cas says, and his voice is lower, richer. Cas talks and his wings seem to quiver with that same corrupt joy, with an excitement that Cas just can’t seem to keep under lock and key. Cas moves closer to the grate, willingly catches Dean’s eyes this time and stares deep into them as if he can see straight into Dean’s soul.
And maybe they would’ve given up their search, would’ve concluded that the darkness was too thick that night and that they would come back tomorrow at first light, but just then, a straying soldier had run out of the trees.
Cas smiles but it falters and then he says, “I was wretched to you on our wedding day,” and he has his hand fisted in Dean’s shirt and he’s upset, Dean knows.
So it’s what he’s thinking about when curfew sets in and he’s marching to the wall for duty. It’s what he’s thinking about as he shivers in the cold, because it’s snowing just like last night, and it feels so much like a dream that it makes Dean’s feet move a little faster, so damn eager that is he just to get to a six by twelve inch grate. Just to glimpse blue eyes because even though Aarif’s lips never moved to form
“I’m dizzy,” Cas says and he’s breathless and he slumps against Dean’s chest, buries his face into the crook of Dean’s neck, and Dean closes his eyes and wraps his arms around Cas’ waist.
“How’d the devil’s trap break—Dean—I swear I fixed it last night when Jack—” Sam pulled out a gun from his back pocket but Belphegor simply grinned. Castiel was her body shield.
They video chat for hours, Eileen listening patiently while doing her nails or brushing her pet poodle, Doug, and she keeps insisting that she should talk to Cas, maybe see if they have some sort of misunderstanding, some sort of miscommunication, but Sam just vehemently shakes his head every time because he’s afraid Dean and Cas’ anger will get redirected at her.
Oh, the horror she felt rushing through her veins at the sight of them! Oh, the tears that welled up in her eyes as she recalled her frightening conversation with Cookie just mere hours ago when she had relayed what devilish things she had heard them say! Mrs. Christian began gathering her cleaning supplies hurriedly—she could not stay so complacently in the presence of evil—but to her horror, before she could scurry away, the two evildoers were before her, two tombstones down. Oh, she was so afraid of what they might do to her should they spot her! Who was to say what they were capable of after the sun went down, when the moon was full and shining bright in the sky? So Mrs. Christian sobbed, as quietly as she could, and crouched behind her husband’s gravestone, embracing it with all her might. Good god, if only her husband were alive to protect her!
Cas meets his eyes this time, leans in just a little closer, so slight that it shouldn’t even be happening—the way that Dean’s heart’s beating faster, the way that it’s speeding up with his nerves at the barest of the angel’s actions—and Cas carefully brings his own hand up, presses it against the sigilled grate against Dean’s own.
Dean’s angry but he’s even guiltier so it doesn’t take him more than a heartbeat to switch the light off.
After that, it seemed the pair had no trouble pretending that they were courting. Soon enough, their catastrophe of a date seemed to turn itself on its head, and by the time their pie arrived, Dean Winchester was even jokingly referring to Castiel as his “sweetheart.” And then, when the bill came, to Mrs. Christian’s utter horror, Cookie pulled a length of mistletoe from her pocket and held it above their table, winking at Dean Winchester again in that same knowing way that she had done when he first arrived at
That’s what Sam says when Cas is gone, when Cas has locked himself up in a new motel room for the case because he can’t stand to be around Dean anymore.
Whatever Woody was thinking, Mrs. Christian could make no sense of it. She was once more distracted by the shop bell, and then speak of the devil for the city man walked in! He was sans trench coat today as well, again wearing garments that she recalled having seen on the elder Winchester brother before. These were far more proper, however—ironed and crisp, suitable for acquiring a wife.
, Cookie Baker, greeted the two, and soon enough to Mrs. Christian’s utter consternation, Dean Winchester and Castiel were both seated in the booth opposite hers.
Right around opening, they stomped in through the front door. Mrs. Christian remarked that for the first time, the city man wasn’t wearing his trench coat. Today, he was clad in jeans that she vaguely recalled the elder Winchester brother wearing on more than one occasion (they were ratty, so Mrs. Christian had frowned at them), and a worn T-shirt that read
But Sam gets no response. Instead, a minute later, he hears voices. Cas and Dean. Dean must’ve come back from the doctor.
Cas bites his tongue. He burrows under their blanket, and maybe the cold that washes over him isn’t just the absence of Dean’s body against his—maybe it’s something deeper.
Mrs. Norris only has enough decency to not come barging in when Dean loudly rambles about how showers are private affairs.
Cas had done that, night after night. In Cas’ arms, that’d been the only time that the bloodlust in Dean’s veins had settled, too used to fighting and killing as they made their way through that pit of monsters. And other nights when Dean hadn’t been able to settle, when nights came where leviathans swept down to try and take his angel away, Dean had slept with his arms tight around Cas’ waist, nose buried in his neck, breathing in the scent of him.
And upon hearing promises of sending Dean to hell, Dean’s heartbeat thuds in his ears. Dean’s frightened out of his wits. Dean gives a strained smile, nods vigorously as if he’s totally down with his neighbour’s obsession with Satan and death, and then takes one step backwards before he chickens out and runs away.
“You came,” he says and his voice cracks and he sounds as if he worried about it all day, as if he didn’t think that Dean’s
worse this time, as if before, it’d been nothing but the prick of a needle, and it goes on longer, and
Another awkward five minutes later, Dean’s standing in the doorway, is done his inspection and ready to move on to the next block, and Cas realizes with horror that if he undoes the buttons of the coat to hand back to Dean, he’d really just be stripping in a very unsexy fashion.
Belphegor rolled her eyes, but when she looked at Castiel, instead of lust, it was pity that marred her visage.
So, “Lemme look at you,” he says, with worried fingers. He pulls the edge of the fur away, the edge of the coat. He undoes the straps that hold Cas' sheer dress together, and Cas stands still and patient, as Dean’s hands run over smooth and unblemished skin, no bullet wounds in sight, nothing left to indicate that Cas is hurt.
And it’s somewhere between there, when the applause is still far from dying down, that Dean leans in and surprises Cas with a kiss, and because everybody sees it, the room bursts into cheers.
The one seat left open, below the platform in front of them. The one that sits in the middle of a devil’s trap and a circle of holy oil, ready to be lit by a servant of the council as soon as it’s occupied. The seat that Dean’s been in many times.
that will break the long nightmare that has been his life since Michael came here, but Dean moves around him as if on tiptoes.
A gnarled wooden crown had sprung forth from the earth and had molded itself to Cas, but the colour had been dull. There’d been no electric current running through it to make it burn blue.
At the city man’s proclamation, Dean Winchester stiffened. His face seemed to fall, before he picked himself back up again.
tonight, his halo crackling with wicked electricity, and he’s not the shivering naked little bird from before. He's not
“You were going to die, Dean,” Cas says again and his voice cracks in his hysteria. “You were going to leave me in this shithole.”
No watchtowers. There had been, once upon a time. It’s what Bobby had told them. But having watchtowers had just made it easier for the angels. They’d flutter in, hidden amongst the shadows of the towers where moonlight couldn’t touch them, and they'd whisper, whisper, whisper.
But at long last, after several minutes of Mrs. Christian observing the irritable scene before her, the town’s resident lesbian and owner of
Belphegor sneered. “Guess that’s pretty easy now, huh? Not an angel anymore, are you, Cas? I gotta say you were pretty foolish. Fell for…
The only times that exist after that are times where Dean’s restless, when the ticking clock in the library feels like hours upon hours folded over one another infinitely, and all Dean can do is flip through book after book, from dawn to dusk, just until the darkness swallows up the earth and cloaks it in night again.
It’s a day where Dean’s gone from the bunker and Cas is loitering in the kitchen, blatantly ignoring Sam, Dean having been asked by Mary to accompany her to a doctor’s visit. It’s not really for Mary, Sam knows, because Dean had recently revealed that he hadn’t gone to the doctor in the last thirty-two years, unlike Sam who went for his yearly check-up, and Mary had been appalled, and possibly even more appalled when Dean had insisted that he wasn’t gonna go
—at Cas, at Mom—because how is Dean going to adjust to this blow when he finds out he might have to call his best friend “Dad”?
Oh, how nervous she was! Though she knew they had no reason to suspect where she had been this morning, she still shuddered to think what they could find out, perhaps by using some terrible form of black magic! But still, she let them into her shop, and anxiously hovered at the till waiting to see what they were looking to purchase, prepared to write it down to discuss with Cookie later, should they perhaps be materials for a demon summoning spell or something similarly wicked.
, and then tenses, expecting it, expecting Aarif to flinch and reveal black eyes, but Aarif still doesn’t react. Rob starts reaching for his pistol. “Why we stopping?” he says.
See, at first Sam tries to resist, for the sake of his sanity. But he can’t help but notice the way that Dean and Cas start sneaking around. Late at night, into each other’s bedrooms. Usually Cas tiptoeing into Dean’s, not emerging ’til morning. So it makes Sam wonder what they’re discussing, what they’re hiding that could be so triggering for him, because they’re obviously only meeting each other to have conversations that they don’t want Sam to hear.
The one where both Dean and Cas sign up for a dating website, not knowing that they’re actually just flirting with each other, and then proceed to get jealous.
, he promises. Ten minutes and he’ll go back to duty. For ten minutes, he prays that Cas’ll be safe.
